During the latter decades of the 20th century and into the 21st century, [[society]] has undergone an accelerating pace of change in [[economy]] and [[technology]].  Its effects on the [[workplace]], and thus on the demands on the educational system preparing students for the [[workforce]], have been significant in several ways.  Beginning in the 1980s, government, educators, and major employers issued a series of reports identifying key skills and implementation strategies to steer students and workers towards meeting the demands of the changing workplace and society.

The current workforce is significantly more likely to change career fields or jobs.  Those in the [[Baby boomers|Baby Boom]] generation entered the workforce with a goal of stability; subsequent generations are more concerned with finding [[eudaimonia|happiness]] and fulfillment in their work lives.  Young workers in North America are now likely to change jobs at a much higher rate than previously, as much as once every 4.4 years on average.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeannemeister/2012/08/14/job-hopping-is-the-new-normal-for-millennials-three-ways-to-prevent-a-human-resource-nightmare/#1cb0e4da5508 ''Job-hopping is the new normal for millennials'', Forbes Magazine, August 14, 2012].

==Background==
Since the early 1980s, a variety of governmental, academic, non-profit, and corporate entities have conducted considerable research to identify key personal and academic skills and competencies they determined were needed for the current and next generation.  The identification and implementation of 21st century skills into education and workplaces began in the United States but has spread to Canada,&lt;ref&gt;[https://c21parentguide.wordpress.com C21 - A Parent's Guide to 21st century learning].

Until the dawn of the 21st century, education systems across the world focussed on preparing their students to accumulate content and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Care|first1=Esther|title=How Education Systems Approach Breadth of Skills|url=https://www.brookings.edu/research/how-education-systems-approach-breadth-of-skills/.|website=Brookings|publisher=Brookings}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, schools focussed on providing literacy and numeracy skills to their students, as these skills were perceived as necessary to gain content and knowledge. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Care|first1=Esther|title=How Education Systems Approach Breadth of Skills|url=https://www.brookings.edu/research/how-education-systems-approach-breadth-of-skills/.|website=Brookings|publisher=Brookings}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent developments in technology and telecommunication have made information and knowledge ubiquitous and easily accessible in the 21st century. Therefore, while skills such as literacy and numeracy are still relevant and necessary, they are no longer sufficient. In order to respond to technological, demographic and socio-economic changes, education systems began to make the shift toward providing their students with a range of skills that relied not only on cognition but also on the interdependencies of cognitive, social, and emotional characteristics. &lt;ref&gt;Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee, The Second Machine Age: Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies (W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;  

Notable efforts were conducted by the US Secretary of Labor's Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills (SCANS), a national coalition called the Partnership for 21st Century Skills (P21), the international [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]], the American Association of College and Universities, researchers at [[MIT]] and other institutions of higher learning, and private organizations.

Additional research has found that the top skills demanded by U.S. [[Fortune 500]] companies by the year 2000 had shifted from traditional reading, writing and arithmetic to teamwork, problem solving, and interpersonal skills.&lt;ref name="Cassel &amp; Kolstad"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cassel|first1=R.N.|last2=Kolstad|first2=R.|title=The critical job-skills requirements for the 21st century: Living and working with people|journal=Journal of Instructional Psychology|date=1998|volume=25|issue=3|pages=176–180}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2006 [[Conference Board]] survey of some 400 employers revealed that the most important skills for new workforce entrants included oral and written communications and critical thinking/problem solving, ahead of basic knowledge and skills, such as the reading comprehension and mathematics.  While the [[The three Rs|‘three Rs’]] were still considered foundational to new workforce entrants’ abilities, employers emphasized that applied skills like collaboration/teamwork and critical thinking were ‘very important’ to success at work."&lt;ref name="Conference Board"&gt;{{cite book|title=Are They Ready to Work?

A 2006 report from MIT researchers countered the suggestion that students acquire critical skills and competencies independently by interacting with popular culture, noting three continuing trends that suggest the need for policy and pedagogical interventions:"&lt;ref name="Jenkins"&gt;[http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED536086.pdf Jenkins].

According to labor economists at [[MIT]] and [[Harvard University|Harvard’s Graduate School of Education]], the economic changes brought about over the past four decades by emerging technology and [[globalization]], employers’ demands for people with competencies like complex thinking and communications skills has increased greatly.&lt;ref name="Murnane &amp; Levy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murnane|first1=Richard J.|last2=Levy|first2=Frank|title=Teaching the New Basic Skills: Principles for Educating Children to Thrive in a Changing Economy|date=1996|publisher=Free Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They argue that the success of the U.S. economy will rely on the nation’s ability to give students the "foundational skills in problem-solving and communications that computers don’t have."&lt;ref name="Levy &amp; Murnane"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Levy|first1=Frank|last2=Murnane|first2=Richard|title=Dancing with Robots: Human Skills for Computerized Work|publisher=Third Way|url=http://content.thirdway.org/publications/714/Dancing-With-Robots.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the [[Common Core State Standards Initiative]], an effort sponsored by the [[National Governors Association]] (NGA) and the [[Council of Chief State School Officers]] (CCSSO),   issued the [[Common Core Standards]], calling for the integration of 21st century skills into K-12 curricula across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Common Core State Standards Initiative |url=http://www.corestandards.org/resources/frequently-asked-questions |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The skills==
The skills and competencies that are generally considered "21st Century skills" are varied but share some common themes.  They are based on the premise that effective learning, or [[Deeper Learning|deeper learning]], a set of student educational outcomes including acquisition of robust core academic content, higher-order thinking skills, and learning dispositions.  This [[pedagogy]] involves creating, working with others, analyzing, and presenting and sharing both the learning experience and the learned knowledge or wisdom, including to peers and mentors as well as teachers.  This contrasts with more traditional learning methodology that involves learning by rote and regurgitating info/knowledge back to the teacher for a grade. The skills are geared towards students and workers to foster engagement; seeking, forging, and facilitating connections to knowledge, ideas, peers, instructors, and wider audiences; creating/producing; and presenting/publishing.  The classification or grouping has been undertaken to encourage and promote pedagogies that facilitate deeper learning through both traditional instruction as well as [[active learning]], [[project-based learning]], [[problem based learning]], and others.  A 2012 survey conducted by the [[American Management Association]] (AMA) identified three top skills necessary for their employees: [[critical thinking]], communication and collaboration.&lt;ref name="Critical Skills Survey"&gt;{{cite book|title=Critical Skills Survey|date=2012|publisher=American Management Association|location=New York|url=http://playbook.amanet.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/2012-Critical-Skills-Survey-pdf.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Below are some of the more readily identifiable lists of 21st century skills.

SCANS focused on what they called "learning a living" system. In 1991, they issued their initial report, ''What Work Requires of Schools''.  The report concluded that a high-performance workplace requires workers who have key fundamental skills:  basic skills and knowledge, thinking skills to apply that knowledge, personal skills to manage and perform; and five key workplace competencies.&lt;ref name="SCANS"&gt;[http://www.academicinnovations.com/report.html SCANS report 1991].

Retrieved 2016-03-08&lt;/ref&gt; What they term [[participatory culture]] shifts this literacy from the individual level to a broader connection and involvement, with the premise that networking and collaboration develop social skills that are vital to new literacies.  These in turn build on traditional foundation skills and knowledge taught in school:  traditional literacy, research, technical, and critical analysis skills.

Participatory culture is defined by this study as having: low barriers to artistic expression and civic engagement, strong support for creating and sharing one’s creations, informal mentorship, belief that members' own contributions matter, and social connection (caring what other people think about their creations).&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt;
Forms of participatory culture include:&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt;
*Affiliations — ''memberships, formal and informal, in online communities centered around various forms of media, such as message boards, metagaming, game clans, and other social media).''
*Expressions — ''producing new creative forms, such as digital sampling, [[Skin (computing)|skinning]] and [[modding]], fan videomaking, fan fiction writing, [[zines]], [[mash-ups]].''
*Collaborative Problem-solving — ''working together in teams, formal and informal, to complete tasks and develop new knowledge (such as through Wikipedia, alternative reality gaming, spoiling).''
*Circulations — ''shaping the flow of media (such as [[podcasting]], [[blogging]])''.

The skills identified were:&lt;ref name="Dede"/&gt;

*Simulation 
*Appropriation
*Multitasking
*Distributed Cognition 
*Collective Intelligence

The 21st century Internet centered on material created by a small number of people, [[Web 2.0]] tools (e.g. Wikipedia) foster online communication, collaboration, and creation of content by large numbers of people (individually or in groups) in online communities.&lt;ref name="Dede"/&gt;

In 2009, Dede created a category system for Web 2.0 tools:&lt;ref name="Dede"/&gt; 
*Sharing (communal bookmarking, photo/video sharing, social networking, writers’ workshops/fanfiction)
*Thinking (blogs, podcasts, online discussion fora)
*Co-Creating (wikis/collaborative file creation, mashups/collective media creation, collaborative social change communities)

===World Economic Forum===

In 2015, the World Economic Forum published a report titled ‘New Vision for Education: Unlocking the Potential of Technology’ &lt;ref&gt;http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEFUSA_NewVisionforEducation_Report2015.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; that focused on the pressing issue of the 21st-century skills gap and ways to address it through technology. In the report, they defined a set of 16 crucial proficiencies for education in the 21st century. Those skills include six “foundational literacies”, four “competencies” and six “character qualities” listed below.

'''Foundation Literacies'''
*Literacy and numeracy
*Scientific literacy
*ICT literacy
*Financial literacy
*Cultural literacy
*Civic literacy

'''Competencies'''

*Critical thinking/problem solving
*Communication
*Collaboration

'''Character Qualities'''
*Creativity 
*Initiative 
*Persistence/grit
*Adaptability
*Curiosity
*Leadership
*Social and cultural awareness

===National Research Council===

In a paper titled ‘Education for Life and Work: Developing Transferable Knowledge and Skills in the 21st Century’ &lt;ref&gt;http://www.leg.state.vt.us/WorkGroups/EdOp/Education%20for%20Life%20and%20Work-%20National%20Academy%20of%20Sciences.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; produced by the National Research Council of National Academies, the National Research defines 21st century skills, describes how the skills relate to each other and summaries the evidence regarding 21st century skills. 

As a first step toward describing “21st century skills,” the National Research Council identified three domains of competence: cognitive, interpersonal, and intrapersonal while recognizing that the three domains while different, are intertwined in human development and learning. These three domains represent distinct facets of human thinking and build on previous efforts to identify and organize dimensions of human behaviour. The committee produced the following cluster of 21st century skills in the above mentioned 3 domains. 

'''Cognitive Competencies'''

*Cognitive processes and strategies: Critical thinking, problem solving, analysis, reasoning and argumentation, interpretation, decision-making, adaptive learning
*Knowledge: Information literacy, ICT literacy, oral and written communication, and active listening
*Creativity: Creativity and innovation

'''Intrapersonal Competencies'''

*Intellectual openness: Flexibility, adaptability, artistic and cultural appreciation, personal and social responsibility, appreciation for diversity, adaptability, continuous learning, intellectual interest and curiosity
*Work ethic/conscientiousness: Initiative, self-direction, responsibility, perseverance, grit, career orientation, ethics, integrity, citizenship
*Positive core self-evaluation: Self monitoring, self evaluation, self reinforcement, physical and psychological health

'''Interpersonal Competencies'''

*Teamwork and collaboration: Communication, collaboration, cooperation, teamwork, coordination, interpersonal skills
*Leadership: Responsibility, assertive communication, self presentation, social influence with others

==Implementation==
Multiple agencies and organizations have issued guides and recommendation for implementation of 21st century skills in a variety of [[learning environment]]s and [[learning space]]s.  These include five separate educational areas: standards, assessment, professional development, curriculum &amp; instruction, and learning environments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.p21.org/storage/documents/p21-stateimp_curriculuminstruction.pdf P21 implementation guide].  Retrieved 2016-03-09&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hanoverresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Best-Practices-in-Implementing-21st-Century-Skills-Initiatives-Membership.pdf Hanover Research, Best Practices in Implementing 21st Century Skills Initiatives].  Retrieved 2016-03-11&lt;/ref&gt;

The designs of learning environments and curricula have been impacted by the initiatives and efforts to implement and support 21st century skills with a move away from the [[Factory model school|factory model school model]] and into a variety of different [[school organizational models|organizational models]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nea.org/home/46989.htm NEA 21st-Century Learner, summer 2011].

Retrieved 2016-03-11&lt;/ref&gt;  Hands-on learning project-based learning have resulted in the development of programs and spaces such as [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] and [[makerspaces]].  Collaborative learning environments have fostered flexibility in furniture and classroom layout as well as differentiated spaces, such as small seminar rooms near classrooms.  Literacy with, and access to, digital technology has impacted the design of furniture and fixed components as students and teachers use tablets, [[interactive whiteboard]]s and interactive projectors.  Classroom sizes have grown to accommodate a variety of furniture arrangements and grouping, many of which are less space-efficient than traditional configurations of desks in rows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bobpearlman.org/Articles/ET%20Bob%20Pearlman%20article.pdf ''Making 21st Century Schools - Creating Learner-Centered Schoolplaces/Workplaces for a New Culture of Students at Work'', Bob Pearlman, EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY/September–October 2009].

[[File:Alexandros Mourouzis.jpg|220px|thumb|right|Portrait of Mourouzis, by [[Nikiforos Lytras]].]]
'''Alexander Mourouzis''' ({{lang-el|Αλέξανδρος Μουρούζης}}; {{lang-ro|Alexandru Moruzi}}; died 1816) was a [[Grand Dragoman]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] who served as [[List of rulers of Moldavia|Prince]] of [[Moldavia]] and [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Prince]] of [[Wallachia]]. Open to [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideas, and noted for his interest in [[hydrological engineering]], Mourouzis was forced to deal with the intrusions of [[Osman Pazvantoğlu]]'s rebellious troops. In a rare gesture for his period, he renounced the throne in Wallachia, and his second rule in Moldavia was cut short by the intrigues of [[France|French]] diplomat [[Horace François Bastien, baron Sébastiani|Horace Sébastiani]]. Through his mother, he was a member of the [[Ghica family]] an Orthodox [[Phanariote]] family of [[Albanians|Albanian]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ghika.net/Histoire/Question_Orient.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
[[Image:Alexandru Moruzi at Curtea Nouă.jpg|thumb|300px|Alexander Mourouzis welcoming the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] ambassador in [[Curtea Nouă]].]]

A member of the [[Mourouzis family]] of [[Phanariotes]] and the son of [[Constantine Mourouzis]] (one of the few Ottoman-appointed Princes to die in office),&lt;ref&gt;Penelea Filitti, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; he was educated to speak six languages in addition to his native Greek. Alexander was [[Grand Dragoman of the Porte]] under [[Ottoman Dynasty|Sultan]] [[Selim III]], in which capacity he helped mediate the 1791 [[Treaty of Jassy]], ending the [[Russo-Turkish War (1787–1792)|Russo-Turkish War of 1787–1792]].&lt;ref&gt;Penelea Filitti, pp. 60-61.&lt;/ref&gt; Selim rewarded his service by appointing him to the throne in [[Iași]] (Moldavia) in January 1792,&lt;ref name="Penelea Filitti, p. 61."&gt;Penelea Filitti, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; and transferred a year later to the throne of [[Bucharest]] (1793–1796), where his first year in office coincided with a [[bubonic plague]] outbreak (which he dealt with by [[quarantine|quarantining]] and confining the ill to the village of [[Dudești, Bucharest|Dudești]]).&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p. 199; Giurescu, p. 106; Penelea Filitti, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dismissed owing to intrigues at the Ottoman court, he was reinstated in Bucharest (1798–1801). In 1799, he passed a resolution ending the labor conflict at the cloth factory in Pociovaliște (presently part of Bucharest).&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp. 190-191.&lt;/ref&gt; After reforming its system of worker employment and payment, as well as hiring [[Transylvanian Saxons|Saxon]] experts from [[Transylvania]] to manage the industry, he denied the workers' request to institute two weeks off for each week of labor, and ordered activities to be resumed, while stressing that it was imperative to respect the Ottoman demand for [[textiles]] (''see [[Labor movement in Romania]]'').&lt;ref name="Djuvara, p. 190."&gt;Djuvara, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the employees did not receive payment, but worked in exchange for [[tax exemption]]s.&lt;ref name="Djuvara, p. 190."/&gt;

Over the following year, Mourouzis had to deal with the incursion of Pazvantoğlu's rebellious troops in [[Oltenia]], which resulted in the plundering and burning down much of the city of [[Craiova]].&lt;ref&gt;Ionescu, p. 254; Penelea Filitti, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; News of the Craiova's destruction reached Bucharest and Mourouzis forbade fleeing the city; however, this did not prevent the [[boyar]]s from sending their wealth into [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] lands for safekeeping.&lt;ref&gt;Ionescu, pp. 254-255.&lt;/ref&gt; Mourouzis built fortifications on the road to Craiova and on the banks of [[Olt River]]; he attacked Pazvantoğlu's troops, who used the city's ruins as [[barricade]]s &amp;mdash; after several days of fighting, Pazvantoğlu and his troops fled Craiova and returned to [[Vidin]].&lt;ref&gt;Ionescu, p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt; Powerless against the latter's destructive attacks, he asked to be relieved of his position, and, in a highly unusual gesture, paid off Ottoman authorities in exchange for his own replacement.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p. 282; Penelea Filitti, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the insistence of the [[First French Empire|French Empire]], he was again appointed Prince of Moldavia (1802–1806 and 1806–1807), but was ultimately dismissed through another French intervention at the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]] - on August 12, 1806, [[Horace François Bastien, baron Sébastiani|Horace Sébastiani]], the [[French Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire]], called on Selim III to punish [[Constantine Ypsilantis]]' pro-[[Imperial Russia|Russian]] activities in Wallachia, and to prevent a Moldavian-Wallachian-Russian alliance.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt; This last event constituted one of the causes for the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1806-1812|Russo-Turkish War of 1806–1812]].

[[Mustafa IV]] ordered Mourouzis to be sent to the [[galley]]s, but he was pardoned soon after.&lt;ref name="Penelea Filitti, p. 61."/&gt; He died at his home in [[Istanbul|Constantinople]], and rumor had it that he was poisoned.&lt;ref name="Penelea Filitti, p. 61."/&gt;

==Achievements==
Mourouzis was an [[Enlightenment prince]], whose time on the two thrones was connected with [[modernization]]. The prince belonged to the [[Freemasonry]], having affiliated with two separate [[Masonic Lodge|Lodges]]: in 1773, he was a member of the one active in the [[Transylvania]]n city of [[Sibiu|Hermannstadt]], and, after 1803, belonged to the Moldavian Freemason branch in [[Galați]].&lt;ref name="Penelea Filitti, p. 61."/&gt; His Western contacts and his political ideals were probably connected with the goal of uniting the two [[Danubian Principalities]] under a single prince, as a symbolic legacy of [[Dacia]]: an 1800 [[atlas]] published in [[Vienna]] referred to his two rules as a single leadership of "the two Dacias".&lt;ref name="Penelea Filitti, p. 61."/&gt; As local legislation was primarily based on [[Byzantine law]], he acknowledged the importance given to the ''Hexabiblos'' of 14th century [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] jurist [[Konstantinos Armenopoulos]], and ordered it to be translated into [[Romanian language|Romanian]] &amp;mdash; although it failed to become official law in Wallachia, the ''Hexabiblos'' was widely used for reference by the [[Sfatul boieresc|Bucharest Divan]].&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p. 351.&lt;/ref&gt;

During his rules in Bucharest, Mourouzis notably rebuilt the princely residence of [[Curtea Nouă]], instituted a [[boyar]] office as centralized [[tax]] collection in the capital city, and increased the water supply by tapping sources in the [[Cotroceni]] area.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p. 52; Giurescu, pp. 21, 111, 337; Penelea Filitti, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; His interest in waterworks was also manifested during his stay in Moldavia, where he tapped water and built a [[reservoir]] for the capital Iași&lt;ref&gt;Maiorescu; Penelea Filitti, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; (through a system leading up to [[Golia Monastery]])&lt;ref name="Maiorescu"&gt;Maiorescu&lt;/ref&gt; and provided [[Focșani]] with water from over the [[Milcov River (Siret)|Milcov River]] (achieved following an understanding with Wallachia's [[Alexander Ypsilantis (1725–1805)|Alexander Ypsilantis]]).&lt;ref name="Penelea Filitti, p. 61."/&gt; It was in 1793 that the first modern [[retailing]] firm was inaugurated in Wallachia, maintained by the Frenchman Hortolan.&lt;ref name="Penelea Filitti, p. 61."/&gt;

Under his rules, Wallachian and Moldavian ships for navigation on the [[Danube]] were built at newly created [[shipyard]]s.&lt;ref name="Penelea Filitti, p. 61."/&gt; He also organized the first [[mail delivery]] system in Moldavia.&lt;ref name="Penelea Filitti, p. 61."/&gt; Like his father before him, Alexander Mourouzis founded schools and donated six-year [[scholarship]]s for disadvantaged children.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p. 208; Penelea Filitti, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the educational institutions he created was the [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[seminary]] in Iași's [[Socola Monastery]].&lt;ref name="Penelea Filitti, p. 61."/&gt; He took a personal interest in scientific education, and attended experiments in [[physics]] at the Moldavian capital's Princely School.&lt;ref name="Penelea Filitti, p. 61."/&gt;

During his first reign over Moldavia, Mourouzis notably passed a resolution clarifying the surface of land which boyars were required to allocate to peasants working on their estates. It is the first document to divide agricultural workers into the three traditional categories, based on the number of oxen owned, of ''fruntași'' ("foremost people"), ''mijlocași'' ("middle people") and ''codași'' ("backward people").&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, it was recorded that associations of ''fruntași'' could function as [[Leasehold estate|estate leaseholders]] in the service of boyars or Orthodox monasteries.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp. 258-259.&lt;/ref&gt; This right was suppressed in 1815.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In cultural references==
Mourouzis was the recipient of a [[panegyric]] authored by the Moldavian boyar poet [[Costache Conachi]], who praised the prince's achievements in hydrotechnics.&lt;ref name="Maiorescu"/&gt; Comments made on the poem, published by the [[Romantic nationalism|Romantic nationalist]] [[Gheorghe Sion]], were the subject of an 1873 disagreement between him and literary critic [[Titu Maiorescu]]. The latter placed Sion's essay among his examples of "inebriation with words" (a term which he and the ''[[Junimea]]'' society had coined as a definition for incoherent and needlessly subjective criticism).&lt;ref name="Maiorescu"/&gt;

[[Image:Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres - Roger Delivering Angelica.jpg|thumb|''Ruggiero Rescuing Angelica'' by [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres]]]]
'''Angelica''' is a princess in the epic poem ''[[Orlando innamorato]]'' by [[Matteo Maria Boiardo]]. She reappears in the saga's continuation, ''[[Orlando furioso]]'' by [[Ludovico Ariosto]], and in various later works based on the two original ''Orlando'' pieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Angelica|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Angelica-fictional-character|website=britannica.com|accessdate=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[narratives]] are part of the [[Matter of France]], a cycle of [[legendary history]] stories based on the adventures of [[Charlemagne]] and his [[paladin]]s.

==''Orlando Innamorato''==
In ''Orlando Innamorato'', Angelica is introduced as the daughter of Galafrone, the king of "Cathay", or "China".{{Refn|group="lower-alpha"|[[Cathay]] commonly refers to [[China]] not India.}} But this seeming inconsistency can be resolved.
Boiardo considered Cathay to be a city, and "Cathay was a city in India inferior or [[Serica]]" according to the [[Mappamondo Borgiano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ross|2004|pp=603–4}} (notes on "Cathay")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://beyondthirtynine.com/a-chinese-beauty-in-a-renaissance-poem-at-the-time-of-leonardo-da-vinci/|title=A Chinese Beauty in a Renaissance Poem at the time of Leonardo Da Vinci|author= Paratico, Angelo|date=29 October 2016|publisher=Gingko|quote=citing Ponte, Givovanni}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ponte1972"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ponte|first=Giovanni|title=La personalità e l'opera del Boiardo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TZUWAAAAMAAJ|year=1972|publisher=Tilgher-Genova}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Refn|group="lower-alpha"|Galafrone's realm is vast, with Cathay as its capital city. Albraca a fortress, a day's journey west.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cavallo|2013}}, p. 47, p. 49 and notes 15, 16 (on p. 283).&lt;/ref&gt;}} She comes to Charlemagne's court with her brother Argalia (who assumes the identity of a knight named Uberto dal Leòne).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ross|2004}} (tr.), ''Orlando in Love'', I.i. and p. 671. note to I.i.25.&lt;/ref&gt; All the knights are smitten with her, especially the cousins [[Orlando (character)|Orlando]] ([[Roland]]) and [[Renaud de Montauban|Rinaldo]] (Renaud), but the protective Argalia will only allow her to marry a man who can best him in a joust. When Argalia eventually falls to the [[Saracen]] knight [[Ferraù]], Orlando and Rinaldo threaten to destroy each other over her. As the Saracens lay siege to Duke [[Naimon]]'s estate, Charlemagne promises Angelica's hand to whichever cousin fights best for him. The battle is lost, however, and the characters go on to further adventure: Rinaldo and Angelica drink from magic fountains twice, each time leaving one madly in love and the other indifferent, while Orlando loses his wits to his passion.

==''Orlando Furioso''==
Boiardo left his epic unfinished, but the action was taken up in ''Orlando furioso''. Angelica is continually sought throughout the world by Orlando, Rinaldo, and the best knights from various countries. She eventually finds herself naked and chained to a rock in the sea, offered as a sacrifice to a [[sea monster]] called the [[Orc (monster)|orc]] (a situation identical to the perils of [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]]). She is rescued by the [[Africa]]n knight [[Ruggiero (character)|Ruggiero]], who gives her a ring of invisibility. Later, pursued by the maddened Orlando, she uses the ring and vanishes. She ultimately falls in love with an ordinary [[Moors|Moor]] soldier Medoro and returns with him to Cathay; the lovesick Orlando requires the aid of his cousin [[Astolpho]] to recover his senses.

The '''Archaeological Site of Alto da Vigia''' ({{lang-pt|Estação Arqueológica de Alto da Vigia}}) is an [[archaeological site]] associated with [[Rome|Roman]] interventions in the [[Portugal]], situated along the Praia das Maçãs in the [[Freguesia (Portugal)|civil parish]] of [[São João das Lampas e Terrugem]], in [[concelho|municipality]] of [[Sintra, Portugal|Sintra]].

==History==
The existence of a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[sanctuary]] dates to the 2nd to 3rd century A.D., when the lands overlooking the coast were dedicated to Sun, Moon and [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]].&lt;ref name="MASMO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://museuarqueologicodeodrinhas.cm-sintra.pt/escavacoes/1/alto-da-vigia.html |title=Excavação Alto da Vigia |publisher=Museu Arqueológico de São Miguel de Ordinhas |year=2015 |accessdate=29 March 2016 |language=Portuguese |location=Sintra, Portugal}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time a circular [[temenos]], an open air religious space, was used by holders of high imperial positions in the territory.

Little is known about the intervening years, although a Moorish settlement occupied the lands sometime in the 12th century.&lt;ref name=MASMO/&gt; The group eventually disappeared, and the area was abandoned. Much of the stonework was used by locals to build their own residences or used in public construction.&lt;ref name=MASMO/&gt;

The re-discovery of these ruins date back to Valentim Fernandes in 1505; and Francisco d'Ollanda, around 1541, with the latter including designs and observations of the structures, which he observed were a Roman sanctuary.&lt;ref name=MASMO/&gt; The identification of these ruins, corresponded to the first archeological discovery in Portugal. Its importance was largely recognized by the number of local, national and international visitors during the Renaissance.&lt;ref name=MASMO/&gt; Among the illustrious visitors were members of the Portuguese Royal Family, namely King D. [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel]], and later, the Infante D. Luís, brother of King D. [[João III of Portugal|John III]].&lt;ref name=MASMO/&gt; 

These descriptions suggest that the site was visitable during the 16th century, at a time when the structures were largely submerged in the sand.&lt;ref name=MASMO/&gt; Yet, local memory helped the stories to continue, and the existence of a Roman sanctuary along the Sintrense beach remained in the minds of locals, even as its specific location could not be identified.&lt;ref name=MASMO/&gt; Various studies and scientific work finally identified its presence on a small hilltop escarpment overlooking the Praia das Maçãs, known locally as the ''Alto da Vigia'' and ''Alconchel''.&lt;ref name=MASMO/&gt; A team from the Archaeological Museum of São Miguel de Odrinhas began excavations in 2008, alongside a tower structure, unearthing a monumental Roman sanctuary.&lt;ref name=MASMO/&gt;

==Architecture==
The site is situated above cliffs overlooking the beach of Praia das Maçãs, on barren lands. The complex includes a Roman sanctuary and a tower dating from the 16th century.&lt;ref name=MASMO/&gt; In addition, there were also identified vestiges from the Islamic epoch, totally unknown until their discovery, although the toponymy ''Alconchel'' (''al-concilium'') may have alluded to its presence.&lt;ref name=MASMO/&gt; 
Architectural artefacts from the Moorish period correspond to a [[ribat]] (or ''convent'') that included various halls, with a [[mirhab]] oriented towards the southwest (in the direction of Mecca).&lt;ref name=MASMO/&gt; The remaining materials associated with the Moors are residual, and include ceramics from the 12th century (likely associated the final phase of occupation), as well as shells and fires (suggesting a link between the coastal activities and food for these locals.&lt;ref name=MASMO/&gt;  In addition to the buildings, an area of graves were identified without any artefacts linked to the Islamic presence.&lt;ref name=MASMO/&gt; The structures of the ribat also reused many of the architectural elements of the Roman epoch, that identifiable by the inscriptions, already identified by Fernandes and d'Ollanda during their excavations in the 16th century.&lt;ref name=MASMO/&gt; 

The importance of the sanctuary during the Roman period is reflected in the votive inscriptions, expressing health to the Emperor and long life to the Empire.&lt;ref name=MASMO/&gt; These wishes are not normally associated with particular devotees, nor by local or provincial elites, but suggest that they were contracted by members of the Imperial class, namely governors of [[Lusitania]] or Imperial [[Legatus|legates]], by way of the Senate of Olissipo.&lt;ref name=MASMO/&gt; The inscriptions were dedicated by Sextus [[Tigidius Perennis]], governor of Lusitania, to the ''Soli et Lunae'' in 185 AD; between 200 and 209 by [[Junius Celanius]], a governor, to the ''Soli aeterno Lunae'' and by [[Caius Julius Celsus]], ''procurator province Lusitaniae'' in the late 2nd century.

During excavations an inscription was recovered that attests to the importance of the local, since it was dedicated to the Sun and the Ocean, by a procurator of Agustus Cesear, and his family.&lt;ref name=MASMO/&gt; In addition to the altar and funerary inscription, there were other Roman architectural elements discovered on the site, including a framed pots, fragments of columns and altars and large blocks for construction.&lt;ref name=MASMO/&gt;

'''''Brandy &amp; Mr. Whiskers''''' is an American [[cartoon series|animated]] [[television series]] created by cartoonist Russell Marcus for the [[Disney Channel]]. It follows the lives of the titular characters--respectively, a pampered-yet-spunky [[Mongrel dog|dog]] and a hyperactive [[rabbit]]--who get stuck in the [[Amazon Rainforest]] together. The show originally aired from August 21, 2004 to August 25, 2006 and reruns continued until June 21, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/brandy-and-mr-whiskers/episodes/|title=Brandy and Mr. Whiskers|publisher=Brandy &amp; Mr. Whiskers|language=English|accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Premise==
A pampered dog (Brandy) and an easily excited rabbit (Mr. Whiskers) face a new life of challenges together when they fall out of an airplane and become stranded in the Amazon Rain Forest. They make new friends: Loa, the boa constrictor; toucan sisters Cheryl and Meryl; and Ed the otter. Stories follow the titular duo as they attempt to adapt to their new surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YX_daEhlnbsC&amp;pg=PA564|title=Encyclopedia of Television Shows, 1925 through 2010|edition=2nd|last=Terrace|first=Vincent|publisher=McFarland|year=2008|isbn=9780786486410|location=United States|pages=132|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season One===
Brandy and Mr. Whiskers start getting acquainted as they begin their new lives in the Rainforest. They build a tree house to live in, using debris that fell out of the plane's cargo compartment. A big part of the series is Brandy's desperation to getting back to her home in [[Palm Beach, Florida]]. In the meantime, both she and Mr. Whiskers work together and build an unlikely but genuine friendship despite having a lot of differences, adapt by exploring the environment, and making friends with the native animals. Brandy makes attempts to get the jungle to become a civilized society by introducing elements such as [[fashion]], [[hygiene]], and shiny rocks, their type of currency. Mr. Whiskers prefers to mix things up by using the powers of invention and imagination to occupy his time, but it usually causes havoc in the jungle and affects his popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/brandy-mr-whiskers/episodes-season-1/194648/|title=Season 1 guide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season Two===
As Brandy and Mr. Whiskers get more settled in the jungle, a lot of changes are put in order. They redecorate the tree house by giving the interior a more "homey environment", which includes flowery wallpaper, tasteful decor and an indoor bathroom (this was after Mr. Whiskers' new "dream house" was destroyed). The native animals also become more [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] as they have now established a new [[market economy]] in the Amazon. Brandy and Mr. Whiskers discover the mall in the first episode of season 2, "Get a Job". They develop [[clothing]], consumer products, [[restaurants]], [[theme parks]], TV commercials, a [[boy band]] called '''"Sugartoad"''' and a [[shopping mall]]. The adaptation has also lowered Brandy's desire to getting back home as she grows to truly accept her new life in the Amazon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/brandy-mr-whiskers/episodes-season-2/194648/|title=Season 2 guide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characters==
===Main===
* '''Brandy Harrington (of the Florida Harringtons)''' (voiced by [[Kaley Cuoco]]): Brandy is a classy pampered princess yet tomboyish short-tempered [[Mongrel dog|dog]] who was owned by a wealthy person. While on her way to a spa for the first time in an aircraft's cargo room, a mishap with Mr. Whiskers (a rabbit she came across inside) caused the two of them to fall straight into the Amazon Rainforest. But after she callously traded Whiskers to Gaspar for a map back home, she realized that she cares for Whiskers deep down and rescued him. Brandy prefers to make the most out of any situation and she attempts to improve her own standing by mistreating and abusing the kindness of her friends, though she does care for her friends very much.

Brandy and Whiskers have a friends relationship. They often get into fights. However, she is always on the lookout for escape opportunities. She is prone to act like a drama queen, and can be more annoying than Whiskers at times because of her spoiled upbringing. Brandy thinks she is a spaniel with a pedigree, but in the episode "Pedigree, Schmedigree", it is revealed that she is an unspecified mutt from a dog pound. She has blonde colored and straight dog ears (similar to pigtails), darker blonde skin and blue eyes. She usually wears a pink short-sleeved shirt, red jeans and purple platform sandals. She also wears what appears to be a collar on her neck. She usually acts mean to Whiskers, but deep down she cares about him.
* '''Mr. Whiskers''' (voiced by [[Charlie Adler]]): Mr. Whiskers is a white lop-eared [[rabbit]] with a horrible case of body odor who has not had very many friends during his lifetime. He is portrayed as silly, sloppy, smelly, gross-natured, hyperactive, dimwitted, and an annoying pest. However, he is actually intelligent with a fairly large vocabulary, which is exhibited at special moments. He is also very loving and caring, but he can be clumsy and clueless at times although he can be arrogant and naughty. He often acts selfish, short-tempered and cranky. When he first met Brandy, he was on his way to a zoo in [[Paraguay]] where he was going to be sold for 39 cents, though he soon made a mistake that caused the two of them to fall into the Amazon Rainforest (when Brandy told him turn to on the light switch, he accidentally opened the Emergency Escape Hatch). While Brandy often is embarrassed by his antics, Whiskers does his best to help out Brandy and he does cherish his friendship with her, though she does not always feel the same way. Brandy does not hate Whiskers but just gets annoyed by him. Mr. Whiskers' other best friend is Ed, a river otter with whom he often spends most of his time. He is often seen in an orange jumpsuit.

===Recurring===
* '''Lola Boa''' (voiced by [[Alanna Ubach]]): Lola Boa is, as her name suggests, a pink and purple-striped [[boa constrictor]] who often the voice of reason amongst Brandy's friends. She speaks with a heavy Hispanic accent. While she often has great ideas, sometimes Brandy believes her ideas are not too bright and Brandy secretly believes Lola is gross because she swallows rodents whole while they are still alive. However, Lola remains Brandy's best friend and she is usually there to help her out when the going gets tough, though Brandy's cruel nature is sometimes too harsh for her to even tolerate. A [[running gag]] with Lola is the fact that as a snake, she has no arms or legs. The others constantly make remarks about her lack of limbs, not seeming to notice until she acknowledges her "disability". In the episode "[[List of Brandy &amp; Mr. Whiskers episodes|You've Got Snail]]", Lola's profession seems to be as a nurse.
* '''Cheryl and Meryl''' (both voiced by [[Sherri Shepherd]]): Cheryl and Meryl are cute, twin [[toucan]] sisters that have a grudge against one another and are Brandy's closest girl friends next to Lola. While they care for one another, they often compete and bicker over petty matters, though they do agree with each other in certain rare circumstances. Cheryl and Meryl's fights often lead to catastrophes that divert the paths of the plans concocted by Mr. Whiskers and Brandy. They speak in an African-American [[hip hop|hip-hop]] style, though they are presumed to be from the local area.
* '''Ed''' (voiced by [[Tom Kenny]]): Ed is a [[giant otter]] who is Mr. Whiskers's best friend. Ed is caring and kind, but dim-witted. He and Mr. Whiskers usually come up with friendly plans, but sometimes Ed is the one who does the thinking. Despite the fact that most of their plans cause havoc, he remains loyal to his friend.
* '''Gaspar Le'Gecko''' (voiced by [[André Sogliuzzo]]): Gaspar Le Gecko is the self-appointed dictator/entrepreneur/musical director of the Amazon Rainforest who often serves as the antagonist of the series. However, the only reason he is the leader is because no one else bothered to take the position. He speaks with a French accent, though he is assumed to be from the local area. He has a strong desire to eat Mr. Whiskers and he often tries to make schemes in order to gain an opportunity to do such. Gaspar is one of the few individuals in the Rainforest who has the ability to help Brandy get back home to civilization, though after Brandy betrayed him by going back on his deal in the first episode, he hasn't since offered to help her out again. Gaspar is often seen with his simian henchmen. Gaspar also likes using others (mostly Brandy and/or Whiskers) to get what he wants. However, Gaspar has shown a softer side of somewhat friendship to Brandy and Whiskers when it suits his best interests. He also displays a more sensitive side that he usually keeps to himself, such as liking ballet and little dolls. He is somewhat in love with Brandy. In the episode "What Price Dignity?! (Cheap!)" Gaspar tells Brandy that his mother is coming to visit and says that he will give her this beautiful dress if she pretends to be his girlfriend while his mother is there. However it turns out that Gaspar's mother is a fraud and Brandy finds out the "date" was not real at all.
* '''Margo''' (voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]]): Margo is a stick bug who is rivals with Brandy in the social chain of the Amazon Rainforest. When Brandy first arrived in the Amazon, Margo helped her out by giving her some inside information on where the popular people hang out since she believes Brandy shouldn't hang out with Mr. Whiskers. Despite the fact that Margo hangs out with Brandy in some instances, she isn't afraid of belittling her in order to improve her own social standing. On rare occasions, Margo can be nice and caring, against her normal snobbish, vain self.
* '''The Monkeys''' (voiced by [[Tom Kenny]] and [[Jeff Bennett]]): Gaspar's minions. They are not very smart and do not understand what they are commanded.
* '''Lester''' (voiced by Bob Rubin): A gorilla who is usually seen as one of Gaspar's henchmen. In one episode, he is portrayed as the bully of the rainforest who likes to beat up Mr. Whiskers.
* '''Whiskers's brain''' (voiced by [[Charlie Adler]]): He wears a [[bowler hat]], speaks with a Yiddish accent and constantly leaves his owner's head. He is more like a running gag but has come up numerous times.
* '''Harold''' (voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]) : A [[guinea pig]] who is shown in the second season as the pet of Mr. Whiskers.
* '''Mr. Sloth''' (voiced by [[André Sogliuzzo]]): A sloth who often appears and almost never speaks.
* '''Gabriella''' (voiced by [[Kath Soucie]] and [[Grey DeLisle]]): She is Gaspar's girlfriend. She is often seen accompanied by Margo and the Lemur. Gabriella is an upscale [[basilisk lizard]] who takes care of her appearance and fashion. She is an enemy of Brandy.
* '''The Lemur''' (voiced by [[Tara Strong]]): She is a lemur that is always with Margo and Gabriella. The three always tease Brandy, but always get their comeuppance.

===Minor===
* '''Melvin''' (voiced by [[A.J. Trauth]]): Appeared in "[[Time For Waffles]]". A [[Marsh deer]]. Brandy got the idea she could only get his attention by whitening her teeth (another of Gaspar's plots). In reality, he did like her but only started talking to her when she started talking to him; though her smiling creeped him out. He confessed this when they were being chased by a jaguar and his son. Their pursuers were tracking them by their bright teeth.
* '''The Vic''' (voiced by [[Thomas Lennon]]): A jungle snake who appeared in "Skin of Eeeeeeeevil!!!", "Any Club that Would Have Me as a Member" and "Pop Goes the Jungle". He was the target of Lola Boa's infatuation in "The Skin of Eeeeeeeevil!!!". In his second appearance, the Vic was the head of the jock-like Carnivore Club that Whiskers wanted to join. Unlike most of the other predators seen that chased after Brandy and Whiskers, the Vic and his two friends (a panther and a jaguar) were not foiled but rather left hungry, feeling dejected that they were out-smarted by a plant eater. In "Pop Goes the jungle he is seen eating himself to stop hearing Brandy's horrible singing voice.
* '''Wolfie Lobito''' (voiced by [[Diedrich Bader]]): Appeared in "Wolfie: Prince of The Jungle". Wolfgang Louise "Wolfie" Lobito is a [[wolf]] who was raised by a monkey who was raised by a panther who was raised by a coconut tree.  Whiskers eventually turned him into a gentleman, but by then he was helpless to do anything as he watched Brandy fall off a cliff and into the water. Brandy instantly had a crush on him after he saved her from a similar predicament before. She's seen him around before but never really had a chance to speak to him because she was too shy too. She was friends with him as well before but she had forgotten his name because they hadn't seen each other in a few years. She wanted to date him and kept saying that she was going to make him "the best boyfriend ever" but she never really went out with him. Wolfie's unmannered and impolite attitude got to Brandy so she started teaching him how to be a mannered wolf. Wolfie didn't really like this so Brandy let him choose if he wanted to continue taking lessons from her or just go off on his own. Wolfie  quickly took to this idea.
* '''Mama Croc''' (voiced by [[Kerri Kenney-Silver|Kerri Kenney]]): Appeared in "The Babysitter's Flub" where Brandy and Mr. Whiskers had to babysit her 9 eggs, or else she would eat them. You can tell that she has that "bossy school teacher" attitude and is really sometimes ticked-off and happy at the same time.
* '''Tito the Samba Monkey''' (voiced by [[Nestor Carbonell]]): A monkey who teaches samba lessons and appeared in the episode "[[Rain Delay]]". In the episode Brandy fights against bad weather to reach Tito before Margo; eventually she learns Tito cancelled the lessons due to his sick mother.
* '''Mr. Cantarious''' (voiced by [[Wayne Knight]]): Appeared in "You've Got Snail". A  jungle snail who was discovered to be the underside neighbor of Brandy and Whiskers when Whiskers's ball rolled into his house and smacked into him. When Cantarious refused to give Whiskers's ball back, Brandy and Whiskers did acts of revenge to him, including filling his yard with candy wrappers and having a loud party at night. However, Cantarious got back each time by sliming them with his snail slime, usually somehow orally. (The running gag was Brandy, Whiskers, and anyone else who suffered his wrath running to a river, washing their mouths as they go "Gross, gross, gross!") However, they eventually made peace... but only for a short time when Whiskers offered to lend him salt.
* '''Isabelle''' (voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]]): Isabelle is a giant lizard who appeared in "Cyranosaurus Rex". Whiskers had a crush on her and did all sorts of weird things to impress her like acting ''[[gangsta (rapper)|gangsta]]''. She has a very short temper and lives with her parents. Isabelle didn't like him back and ate him. Whiskers found a new crush inside her stomach and moved on after she threw them up.
* '''Dr. Phyllis''' (voiced by [[Hallie Todd]]): A [[dugong]] who is a physician that helps people with their problems, especially Brandy and Whiskers's problems. She recommends Brandy to be like Mr. Whiskers, and Mr. Whiskers to be like Brandy, which by the way, ticked off Brandy. After Brandy turns the tables on Whiskers into going back to his normal self, they promised to Dr. Phyllis to never say THE blaming word ever again.
* '''Gina''' (voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]]): Gina is an orange [[Coati]] that Whiskers fell in love with. She appeared in "Cyranosaurus Rex".
* '''Tiffany Turlington (of the Texas Turlingtons)''' (voiced by [[Amy Davidson]]) She appeared in "One of a Kind". She is very similar to appearance to Brandy and shares many interests with her. She has the same dog ears as Brandy's, but brown colored and curved. She has tan skin, green eyes, and wears a blue shirt with black pants. Tiffany claimed to be very rich and has claimed to visit many different places. Brandy, feeling the need to prove she's good friend material, lied to Tiffany about the places she'd been too when she really hadn't. While Brandy has a musical leash, she has one with a tracker bug. She dislikes Mr. Whiskers.
*'''"Poncho"''' (voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]]): She appeared in the episode "Mini Whiskers". He is a baby boar who appeared out of a bush (while Whiskers thought was some sort of beast). Brandy and Whiskers take Poncho in, much to Whiskers complaining. At first, Brandy tries to find Poncho's parents. After failing to do so, she goes back to the tree house. Later in the episode, Brandy teaches Whiskers about responsibility, and how others follow you as an example. Poncho is seen following what ever Whiskers does. Later, Poncho's parents find him, and take him home.
*'''Sandy Carington (of the Georgia Caringtons)''' (voiced by [[Sara Rue]]): She appeared in "[[Sandy &amp; Mr. Frisky]]". A fashionable dog who looks just like Brandy, but with orange wavy ears, a mellow yellow shirt, blue [[cardigan (sweater)| cardigan]], a darker blue skirt, and blue sandals. Sandy fell into the rainforest with Mr. Frisky the same way Brandy and Mr. Whiskers fell into the rainforest. She does not blame Mr. Frisky for confusing the hatch for a light switch, whereas Brandy thinks of Mr. Whiskers as a peabrain for confusing the two. Sandy is a nicer, more caring version of Brandy. Not only is she kinder, but better at everything than Brandy. Even Brandy's friends and all the other locals like Sandy and Mr. Frisky more making their polar opposites jealous. Brandy and Mr. Whiskers try to sabotage Sandy and Mr. Frisky's party and when that does not work, they accidentally fling them out of the jungle. They are both rescued and given a TV show, making them celebrities.
*'''Mr. Frisky''' (voiced by [[Charlie Schlatter]]): A rabbit who is the best friend of Sandy Carington. He appeared in "Sandy &amp; Mr. Frisky". He is very active and shares some habits with Mr. Whiskers, however he is far more agile and less devastating than him.
* '''Vlad''' (voiced by [[Tom Kenny]]): A bat that appeared in "[[List of Brandy &amp; Mr. Whiskers episodes|The Curse of the Vampire Bat]]". When Brandy and Mr. Whiskers go to meet a new neighbour (a [[Vampire bat|vampire-bat]] named Vlad), Mr. Whiskers becomes scared because he believes that the neighbouring creature is a [[vampire]], despite the fact that nobody believes that Mr. Whiskers is correct.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2277">{{Nihongo|'''Burikko'''|ぶりっ子||sometimes rendered '''Burriko''' in English}} is a Japanese term for a style of personal appearance and demeanor that is considered childish and cute, sometimes excessively so. The term was [[neologism|coined]] during the 1980s, and is sometimes attributed to Japanese comedian [[Kuniko Yamada]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=1987|last=Cherry|first=Kittredge|title=Womansword: What Japanese Words Say about Women|isbn=9780870117947}}&lt;/ref&gt; though its exact moment of invention is unclear.

[[Image:Joseph Justus Scaliger - Imagines philologorum.jpg|thumb|222px|[[Joseph Scaliger]]'s ''De emendatione temporum'' (1583) began the modern science of chronology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| first = E. G. | last = Richards | author-link = E. G. Richards | title = Mapping Time: The Calendar and History | place = Oxford | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | year = 1998 | pages = 12–13 | isbn = 0-19-286205-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Chronology''' (from [[Latin]] ''chronologia'', from [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wikt:χρόνος|χρόνος]]}}, ''chrónos'', "time"; and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[wikt:-logia|-logia]]'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Chronology|volume=6|page=305}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[science]] of arranging events in their order of occurrence in [[time]]. Consider, for example, the use of a [[timeline]] or [[sequence of events]]. It is also "the determination of the actual temporal sequence of past events".&lt;ref name="wordnet"&gt;Memidex/WordNet, "chronology," [http://www.memidex.com/chronology+humanistic-discipline memidex.com] (accessed September 25, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

Chronology is part of [[periodization]]. It is also part of the discipline of [[history]], including [[earth history]], the [[earth sciences]], and study of the [[geologic time scale]].

==Related fields==
Chronology is the science of locating historical events in time. It relies upon [[chronometry]], which is also known as timekeeping, and [[historiography]], which examines the writing of history and the use of historical methods. [[Radiocarbon dating]] estimates the age of formerly living things by measuring the proportion of [[carbon-14]] [[isotope]] in their [[carbon]] content. [[Dendrochronology]] estimates the age of trees by [[correlation]] of the various [[growth rings]] in their wood to known year-by-year reference sequences in the region to reflect year-to-year climatic variation. Dendrochronology is used in turn as a [[calibration]] reference for [[radiocarbon dating]] curves.

==Calendar and era==
{{Main article|Calendar}}

The familiar terms ''[[calendar]]'' and ''[[era]]'' (within the meaning of a coherent system of numbered calendar years) concern two complementary fundamental concepts of chronology. For example, during eight centuries the calendar belonging to the [[Christian era]], which era was taken in use in the 8th century by [[Bede]], was the Julian calendar, but after the year 1582 it was the Gregorian calendar. [[Dionysius Exiguus]] (about the year 500) was the founder of that era, which is nowadays the most widespread dating system on earth. An [[Epoch (reference date)|epoch]] is the date (year usually) when an era begins.

===Ab Urbe condita era===
{{Main article|Ab urbe condita}}
''Ab Urbe condita'' is [[Latin]] for "from [[founding of Rome|the founding]] of the City ([[Rome]])",&lt;ref&gt;Literally translated as "From the city having been founded".&lt;/ref&gt; traditionally set in 753 BC. It was used to identify the Roman year by a few Roman historians. Modern historians use it much more frequently than the Romans themselves did; the dominant method of identifying Roman years was to name the two [[consul]]s who held office that year. Before the advent of the modern critical edition of historical Roman works, AUC was indiscriminately added to them by earlier editors, making it appear more widely used than it actually was.

It was used systematically for the first time only about the year 400, by the Iberian historian [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]]. [[Pope Boniface IV]], in about the year 600, seems to have been the first who made a connection between these this era and [[Anno Domini]]. (AD 1 = AUC 754.)

===Astronomical era===
{{Main article|Astronomical year numbering}}
Dionysius Exiguus’ Anno Domini era (which contains only calendar years ''AD'') was extended by [[Bede]] to the complete [[Christian]] era (which contains, in addition all calendar years ''BC'', but no ''year zero''). Ten centuries after Bede, the French astronomers [[Philippe de la Hire]] (in the year 1702) and [[Jacques Cassini]] (in the year 1740), purely to simplify certain calculations, put the [[Julian Date|Julian Dating System]] (proposed in the year 1583 by [[Joseph Scaliger]]) and with it an astronomical era into use, which contains a [[leap year]] zero, which precedes the year 1 (AD).&lt;ref&gt;Richards 2013, pp. 591-592.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prehistoric chronologies==
While of critical importance to the historian, methods of determining chronology are used in most disciplines of science, especially [[astronomy]], [[geology]], [[paleontology]] and [[archaeology]].

In the absence of [[written history]], with its [[chronicle]]s and [[:Category:King lists|king lists]], late 19th century archaeologists found that they could develop relative chronologies based on pottery techniques and styles. In the field of [[Egyptology]], [[William Flinders Petrie]] pioneered sequence dating to penetrate pre-dynastic [[Neolithic]] times, using groups of contemporary artefacts deposited together at a single time in graves and working backwards methodically from the earliest historical phases of Egypt. This method of dating is known as [[Seriation (archaeology)|seriation]].

Known wares discovered at strata in sometimes quite distant sites, the product of trade, helped extend the network of chronologies. Some cultures have retained the name applied to them in reference to characteristic forms, for lack of an idea of what they called themselves: "The [[Beaker People]]" in northern Europe during the 3rd millennium BCE, for example. The study of the means of placing pottery and other cultural artifacts into some kind of order proceeds in two phases, classification and typology: Classification creates categories for the purposes of description, and typology seeks to identify and analyse changes that allow artifacts to be placed into sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Greene | first =Kevin | authorlink = | title =Archaeology : An Introduction | publisher =University of Newcastle Upon Tyne |date=November 2007 | location = | pages = Chapter 4 | url =http://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/kevin.greene/wintro/chap4.htm | isbn = | accessdate =2008-01-04 | nopp =true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laboratory techniques developed particularly after mid-20th century helped constantly revise and refine the chronologies developed for specific cultural areas. Unrelated dating methods help reinforce a chronology, an axiom of corroborative [[evidence]]. Ideally, archaeological materials used for dating a site should complement each other and provide a means of cross-checking. Conclusions drawn from just one unsupported technique are usually regarded as unreliable.

==Chronological synchronism==
The fundamental problem of chronology is to synchronize events. By synchronizing an event it becomes possible to relate it to the current time and to compare the event to other events. Among historians, a typical need to is to synchronize the reigns of kings and leaders in order to relate the history of one country or region to that of another. For example, the [[Chronicon (Eusebius)|Chronicon of Eusebius]] (325 A.D.) is one of the major works of historical synchronism. This work has two sections. The first contains narrative chronicles of nine different kingdoms: Chaldean, Assyrian, Median, Lydian, Persian, Hebrew, Greek, Peloponnesian, Asian, and Roman. The second part is a long table synchronizing the events from each of the nine kingdoms in parallel columns. The adjacent image shows two pages from the second section.&lt;!-- Deleted image removed:  [[File:Eusebius Chronicon example.png|thumb|alt=Example pages from the Chronicon of Eusebius.|Chronicon of Eusebius.]] --&gt;

By comparing the parallel columns, the reader can determine which events were contemporaneous, or how many years separated two different events. To place all the events on the same time scale, Eusebius used an [[Anno Mundi]] (A.M.) era, meaning that events were dated from the supposed beginning of the world as computed from the [[Book of Genesis]] in the Hebrew [[Pentateuch]]. According to the computation Eusebius used, this occurred in 5199 B.C. The Chronicon of Eusebius was widely used in the medieval world to establish the dates and times of historical events. Subsequent chronographers, such as [[George Syncellus]] (died circa 811), analyzed and elaborated on the Chronicon by comparing with other chronologies. The last great chronographer was [[Joseph Justus Scaliger]] (1540-1609) who reconstructed the lost Chronicon and synchronized all of ancient history in his two major works, ''De emendatione temporum'' (1583) and ''Thesaurus temporum'' (1606). Much of modern historical datings and chronology of the ancient world ultimately derives from these two works.&lt;ref name=Grafton&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grafton|first1=Anthony|title=Joseph Scaliger: A Study in the History of Classical Scholarship|date=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scaliger invented the concept of the [[Julian day|Julian Day]] which is still used as the standard unified scale of time for both historians and astronomers.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

In addition to the literary methods of synchronism used by traditional chronographers such as Eusebius, Syncellus and Scaliger, it is possible to synchronize events by archaeological or astronomical means. For example, the [[Eclipse of Thales]], described in the first book of [[Herodotus]] can potentially be used to date the Lydian War because the eclipse took place during the middle of an important battle in that war. Likewise, various eclipses and other astronomical events described in ancient records can be used to astronomically synchronize historical events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kelley|first1=David H.|title=Exploring Ancient Skies: A Survey of Ancient and Cultural Astronomy|date=2011|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1441976239|pages=614}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another method to synchronize events is the use of archaeological findings, such as pottery, to do [[Dating methodologies in archaeology|sequence dating]].

In [[media studies]], '''concision''' is a form of [[broadcast media]] [[censorship]] by limiting debate and discussion of important topics on the rationale of time allotment.&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;[http://users.utu.fi/bredelli/C8.htm Finnish Views of CNN, Chapter 8: The Structural Constraint of "Concision" as it is Used in the Discourse Style of American Commercial Broadcasting] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120423095239/http://users.utu.fi/bredelli/C8.htm |date=2012-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media critics such as [[Noam Chomsky]] contend that this practice, especially on commercial broadcasts with [[advertising]], encourages broadcasters to exclude people and ideas that they judge cannot conform to the time limits of a particular program.  This leads to a limited number of "the usual suspects" who will say expected ideas that will not require extensive explanation such as mainstream political ones.


'''The beauty of concision, you know, saying a couple sentences between two commercials, the beauty of that is you can only repeat conventional thoughts. Suppose I go on Nightline, whatever it is, two minutes, and I say Gaddafi is a terrorist, Khomeini is a murderer etcetera etcetera…I don’t need any evidence, everyone just nods. On the other hand, suppose you’re saying something that isn’t just regurgitating conventional pieties, suppose you say something that’s the least bit unexpected or controversial, people will quite reasonably expect to know what you mean. If you said that you’d better have a reason, better have some evidence. You can’t give evidence if you’re stuck with concision. That’s the genius of this structural constraint.'''&lt;ref name="Chomsky"&gt;[https://ohtarzie.wordpress.com/2015/05/10/greenwald-on-chomsky-and-staying-in-the-mainstream-without-compromise/  Greenwald on Chomsky and Staying In the Mainstream Without Compromise]{{cite web |url=https://ohtarzie.wordpress.com/2015/05/10/greenwald-on-chomsky-and-staying-in-the-mainstream-without-compromise/}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, introducing controversial or unexpected statements that do not conform to those conventional ideas are discouraged as time inefficient because the person will be required to explain and support them in detail.  Since this can often take considerable time in itself and digress from the primary discussion topic of the broadcast, this is discouraged.  Alternatively, the explanation could be subject to extensive editing for time which could lead to an inadequate presentation of the subject's thoughts.&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt;

==Illustration==

This media control idea is illustrated in the [[film documentary]], ''[[Manufacturing Consent: Noam Chomsky and the Media]]'', where journalist [[Jeff Greenfield]] explains why a person like Chomsky may be excluded from being interviewed on air because he takes too long to warm up. The film then follows up with Chomsky himself explaining the concept while the film gives examples of controversial statements he has made in the past that would require extensive explanation in an interview.&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt;

The 1999 feature film ''[[The Insider (film)|The Insider]]'' has a dramatization of the media concept where journalist [[Mike Wallace]] goes public on a news show about the censoring of a controversial story on ''[[60 Minutes]]''.  When Wallace sees his interview broadcast, he is furious that his testimony is limited to a curt statement that does not adequately explain his position and the only excuse from the producers he receives is that it had to be cut for time.&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt;

}} "The colours represent creative energy, and the layers of the tower imply that a conlang is built piece by piece, never completed. The tower itself also alludes to the Tower of Babel, as it has long been a tradition to demonstrate a constructed language by translating the Babel legend. The Conlang flag was decided on by a vote between many competing designs, and one of my own contributions to the conlanging world is that I was the person who facilitated this election. The winning design was drawn by Christian Thalmann, who introduced the layers. The idea of including the Tower of Babel on the flag had been introduced by Jan van Steenbergen, and the idea of placing the sun on the horizon behind it by Leland Paul. The idea of having the rising sun on the flag had been introduced by David Peterson, who saw it as representing the rise of conlanging from obscurity to popularity and notoriety."&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A '''constructed language''' (sometimes called a '''conlang''') is a [[language]] whose [[phonology]], [[grammar]], and [[vocabulary]] are, instead of having developed [[natural language|naturally]], consciously devised for communication between intelligent beings, most commonly for use by humanoids. Constructed languages may also be referred to as '''artificial''', '''planned''' or '''invented languages'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ishtar for Belgium to Belgrade |url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=554&amp;_t=ishtar_for_belgium_to_belgrade |publisher= European Broadcasting Union|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in some cases [[fictional language|fictional languages]].  There are many possible reasons to create a constructed language, such as to ease human [[communication]] (see [[international auxiliary language]] and [[code]]), to give [[fiction]] or an associated constructed setting an added layer of realism, for experimentation in the fields of [[linguistics]], [[cognitive science]], and [[machine learning]], for [[artistic language|artistic creation]], and for [[language game]]s. 

The expression ''planned language'' is sometimes used to indicate international auxiliary languages and other languages designed for actual use in human communication. Some prefer it to the adjective ''artificial'', as this term may be perceived as pejorative. Outside [[Esperanto culture]], the term [[language planning]] means the prescriptions given to a natural language to standardize it; in this regard, even a "natural language" may be artificial in some respects, meaning some of its words have been crafted by conscious decision. [[Linguistic prescription|Prescriptive grammar]]s, which date to ancient times for classical languages such as Latin and Sanskrit, are rule-based codifications of natural languages, such codifications being a middle ground between naïve natural selection and development of language and its explicit construction.  The term ''glossopoeia'' &lt;!--, coined by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], {see talk page; can anyone cite a use by Tolkien? Sarah Higley uses the word but does not attribute its coinage to him.}--&gt; is also used to mean language construction, particularly construction of [[artistic language]]s.&lt;ref name="higley2007"&gt;Sarah L. Higley: ''Hildegard of Bingen's Unknown Language''.  Palgrave Macmillan, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conlang speakers are rare. For example, the Hungarian census of 2001 found 4570 speakers of [[Esperanto]], 10 of [[Romanid]], two each of [[Interlingua]] and [[Ido (language)|Ido]] and one each of [[Idiom Neutral]] and [[Mundolinco]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nepszamlalas2001.hu/hun/kotetek/18/tables/load2_39_1.html Ethnic affiliation, attachment of cultures, languages and language systems Hungarian statistical office]&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian census of 2010 found 992 speakers of Esperanto, nine of Ido, one of Edo and no speakers of [[Slovio]] or Interlingua.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sezonoj.ru/2011/12/censo/ Russian census (2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Planned, constructed, artificial==
The terms "planned", "constructed", and "artificial" are used differently in some traditions. For example, few speakers of [[Interlingua]] consider their language artificial, since they assert that it has no invented content: Interlingua's vocabulary is taken from a small set of natural languages, and its grammar is based closely on these source languages, even including some degree of irregularity; its proponents prefer to describe its vocabulary and grammar as standardized rather than artificial or constructed.  Similarly, [[Latino sine flexione]] (LsF) is a simplification of Latin from which the [[inflection]]s have been removed. As with Interlingua, some prefer to describe its development as "planning" rather than "constructing". Some speakers of [[Esperanto]] and [[Esperantido]]s also avoid the term "artificial language" because they deny that there is anything "unnatural" about the use of their language in human communication.

By contrast, some philosophers have argued that all human languages are conventional or artificial. [[François Rabelais]], for instance, stated: "C'est abus de dire que nous avons une langue naturelle; les langues sont par institution arbitraires et conventions des peuples."  (''It's an abuse to say that we have a natural language; languages are arbitrary and conventions of peoples by institution.'')&lt;ref&gt;[[François Rabelais]], Œvres complètes, III, 19 (Paris: Seuil, 1973), cited in Claude Piron, ''Le Defi des Langues'' (L'Harmattan, 1994) {{ISBN|2-7384-2432-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An artificial language can also refer to a language that emerges naturally out of experimental studies within the framework of [[artificial language|artificial language evolution]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Furthermore, fictional and experimental languages can be naturalistic in that they are meant to sound natural and have realistic amounts of irregularity. If a naturalistic conlang is derived ''a posteriori'' from a real-world natural language, a real-world reconstructed [[proto-language]] (such as [[Vulgar Latin]] or [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]]) or a fictional proto-language, it should imitate natural processes of [[phonology|phonological]], lexical, and [[grammar|grammatical]] change. In contrast with Interlingua, they are not usually intended for easy learning or communication, and most artlangers do not consider Interlingua to be naturalistic in the sense in which this term is used in artlang criticism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0908E&amp;L=CONLANG&amp;D=0&amp;T=0&amp;P=5208 "Re: "Naturalistic" for auxlangers vs artlangers?"]  AUXLANG mailing list post by Jörg Rhiemeier, 30 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a naturalistic fictional language tends to be more difficult and complex. While Interlingua has simpler grammar, syntax, and orthography than its source languages (though more complex and irregular than Esperanto or its descendants), naturalistic fictional languages typically mimic behaviors of natural languages like [[irregular verbs]] and nouns and complicated phonological processes.

==Overview==

{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}

In terms of purpose, most constructed languages can broadly be divided into:

*''[[Engineered language]]s'' (''engelangs'' {{IPA|/ˈɛnd͡ʒlæŋz/}}), further subdivided into logical languages (''loglangs''), [[philosophical language]]s and [[experimental language]]s; devised for the purpose of experimentation in [[logic]], [[philosophy]], or [[linguistics]];
*''[[International auxiliary language|Auxiliary language]]s'' (''auxlangs'') devised for international communication (also IALs, for International Auxiliary Language);
*''[[Artistic language]]s'' (''artlangs'') devised to create aesthetic pleasure or humorous effect, ''just for fun''; usually secret languages and mystical languages are classified as artlangs.

The boundaries between these categories are by no means clear.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carolandray.plus.com/Glosso/Glossopoeia.html The "Conlang Triangle"] by Raymond Brown.  Accessed 8 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  A constructed language could easily fall into more than one of the above categories. A logical language created for [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] reasons would also be classifiable as an artistic language, which might be created by someone with philosophical motives intending for said conlang to be used as an auxiliary language. There are no rules, either inherent in the process of language construction or externally imposed, that would limit a constructed language to fitting only one of the above categories.

A constructed language can have native speakers if young children learn it from parents who speak it fluently. According to ''[[Ethnologue]]'', there are "200–2000 [[native Esperanto speakers|who speak Esperanto as a first language]]". A member of the [[Klingon Language Institute]], [[d'Armond Speers]], attempted to raise his son as a native (bilingual with English) [[Klingon language|Klingon]] speaker.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/7.08/mustread.html?pg=8 Gavin Edwards: ''Babble On Revisited'', Wired Magazine, Issue 7.08, August 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=March 2018}}

As soon as a constructed language has a community of fluent speakers, especially if it has numerous native speakers, it begins to evolve and hence loses its constructed status. For example, [[Modern Hebrew]] and its pronunciation norms were developed from existing traditions of [[Hebrew]], such as [[Mishnaic Hebrew]] and [[Biblical Hebrew]] following a general [[Sephardic]] pronunciation, rather than engineered from scratch, and has undergone considerable changes since the state of [[Israel]] was founded in 1948 (Hetzron 1990:693). However, linguist [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]] argues that Modern Hebrew, which he terms "Israeli", is a Semito-European hybrid based not only on Hebrew but also on [[Yiddish]] and other languages spoken by revivalists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zuckermann.org/pdf/Hybridity_versus_Revivability.pdf Hybridity versus Revivability: Multiple Causation, Forms and Patterns], Ghil'ad Zuckermann, Journal of Language Contact, Varia 2, pp. 40-67 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Zuckermann therefore endorses the translation of the Hebrew Bible into what he calls "Israeli".&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1242212397385&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull Let my people know!] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916161700/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1242212397385&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull |date=2011-09-16 }}, Ghil'ad Zuckermann, Jerusalem Post, May 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Esperanto]] as a living spoken language has evolved significantly from the prescriptive blueprint published in 1887, so that modern editions of the ''Fundamenta Krestomatio'', a 1903 collection of early texts in the language, require many footnotes on the syntactic and lexical differences between early and modern Esperanto.&lt;ref&gt;''Fundamenta Krestomatio'', ed. L. L. Zamenhof, 1903; 18th edition with footnotes by Gaston Waringhien, UEA 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of constructed languages often have many reasons for using them. The famous but disputed [[linguistic relativity|Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]] is sometimes cited; this claims that the language one speaks influences the way one thinks. Thus, a "better" language should allow the speaker to think more clearly or intelligently or to encompass more points of view; this was the intention of [[Suzette Haden Elgin]] in creating [[Láadan]], a feminist language&lt;ref name="foer-2012" /&gt; embodied in her [[feminist science fiction]] series ''[[Native Tongue (Suzette Haden Elgin novel)|Native Tongue]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"My hypothesis was that if I constructed a language designed specifically to provide a more adequate mechanism for expressing women's perceptions, women would (a) embrace it and begin using it, or (b) embrace the idea but not the language, say "Elgin, you've got it all wrong!" and construct some other "women's language" to replace it."  {{cite web|title=Interview With Suzette Haden Elgin |last=Glatzer |first=Jenna |work= |url=http://www.absolutewrite.com/novels/suzette_haden_elgin.htm |year=2007 |accessdate=2007-03-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612005757/http://www.absolutewrite.com/novels/suzette_haden_elgin.htm |archivedate=2007-06-12 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A constructed language could also be used to ''restrict'' thought, as in [[George Orwell]]'s [[Newspeak]], or to ''simplify'' thought, as in [[Toki Pona]]. In contrast, linguists such as [[Steven Pinker]] argue that ideas exist independently of language. For example, in the book ''[[The Language Instinct]]'', Pinker states that children spontaneously re-invent slang and even grammar with each generation. These linguists argue that attempts to control the range of human thought through the reform of language would fail, as concepts like "freedom" will reappear in new words if the old words vanish.

Proponents claim a particular language makes it easier to express and understand concepts in one area, and more difficult in others.  An example can be taken from the way various [[programming language]]s make it easier to write certain kinds of programs and harder to write others.

Another reason cited for using a constructed language is the telescope rule, which claims that it takes less time to first learn a simple constructed language and then a natural language, than to learn only a natural language. Thus, if someone wants to learn English, some suggest learning [[Basic English]] first. Constructed languages like Esperanto and Interlingua are in fact often simpler due to the typical lack of [[regular and irregular verbs|irregular verbs]] and other grammatical quirks. Some studies have found that learning Esperanto helps in learning a non-constructed language later (see [[propaedeutic value of Esperanto]]).

[[Codes for constructed languages]] include the [[ISO 639-2]] "&lt;tt&gt;[[Codes for constructed languages|art]]&lt;/tt&gt;" for conlangs; however, some constructed languages have their own [[ISO 639]] language codes (e.g. "&lt;tt&gt;eo&lt;/tt&gt;" and "&lt;tt&gt;epo&lt;/tt&gt;" for [[Esperanto]], "jbo" for [[Lojban]], "&lt;tt&gt;ia&lt;/tt&gt;" and "&lt;tt&gt;ina&lt;/tt&gt;" for [[Interlingua]], "&lt;tt&gt;tlh&lt;/tt&gt;" for [[Klingon language|Klingon]] and "&lt;tt&gt;io&lt;/tt&gt;" and "&lt;tt&gt;ido&lt;/tt&gt;" for [[Ido (language)|Ido]]).

==''A priori'' and ''a posteriori'' languages==

{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}

An ''a priori'' constructed language is one whose features (including vocabulary, grammar, etc.) are not based on an existing language, and an ''a posteriori'' language is the opposite. This categorization, however, is not absolute, as many constructed languages may be both ''a priori'' and ''a posteriori'' depending on which linguistic factors of them are observed.

===''A priori'' language===

An ''a priori'' language (from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''a priori'', "from the former") is any constructed language of which all or a number of features are not based on existing languages, but rather invented or elaborated as to work in a different way or to allude different purposes. Some ''a priori'' languages are designed to be [[international auxiliary language]]s that remove what could be considered an unfair learning advantage for native speakers of a source language that would otherwise exist for ''a posteriori'' languages. Others, known as [[philosophical language|philosophical]] or [[taxonomic languages]], try to categorize their vocabulary, either to express an underlying philosophy or to make it easier to recognize new vocabulary.

====Experimental====
There have been many languages constructed to test linguistic hypotheses (such as the [[Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]]) and/or to explore innovative or invented linguistic features. They are therefore necessarily designed with ''a priori'' features. Examples include [[Ithkuil]], [[Kotava]], [[Lojban]] (and its predecessor [[Loglan]], both of which are also schematic), and even the fictional-setting [[Láadan]].

====Artistic====
Most [[artistic language]]s, i.e. those created for amusement or to serve as natural languages of fictional worlds, are largely ''a priori'' in both vocabulary and grammar. Among classical "fictional natural languages" are [[Klingon language|Klingon]] from the science-fiction franchise ''[[Star Trek]]'' and [[Languages constructed by J. R. R. Tolkien|the languages created]] by fantasy writer [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. Other examples include [[Dothraki]] and [[Valyrian]] from ''[[Game of Thrones]]', '[[The 100 (TV series)|Trigedasleng]] from [[The 100 (TV series)|The 100]], [[Atlantean language|Atlantean]] from ''[[Atlantis: The Lost Empire]]'', [[Kēlen]] by Sylvia Sotomayor and [[aUI (language)|aUI]] by W. John Weilgart. [[Láadan]] is both experimental and artistic.

===''A posteriori'' language===
An '''''a posteriori'' language''' (from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''a posteriori'', "from the latter"), according to [[Louis Couturat]], is any constructed language whose elements are borrowed from or based on existing languages. The term can also be extended to [[controlled language|controlled versions]] of existing languages, and is most commonly used to refer to vocabulary despite other features. In distinguishing whether the language is ''a priori'' or ''a posteriori'', the prevalence and distribution of respectable traits is often the key. They may be controlled, naturalistic or schematic.

====Controlled====
A [[controlled language]] is a version of a [[natural language]] with improvements intended to make it easier to learn and to use, such as reduced vocabulary, simplified grammar, etc. These include:
*[[Latino sine flexione]]
*Controlled versions of English:
**[[Basic English]] 
**[[Special English]]
**[[Globish (Gogate)|Globish]]

====Naturalistic====
Naturalistic languages are constructed languages which largely imitate the grammar and vocabulary of a particular group of related languages within a [[language family|family]], thus being potentially [[zonal constructed language|zonal]], i.e. auxiliary between speakers of these languages.
*[[Occidental language|Occidental]] (also called Interlingue)
*[[Interlingua de IALA]]
*[[Interslavic language|Interslavic]]
*[[Folkspraak]]
*[[Lingua Franca Nova]]

===Schematic===
A constructed language is considered schematic when it features a more original grammar, which is usually precise and regular to avoid ambiguities and other obstacles to an easy study, and a vocabulary coming from languages of different families, to make it as recognizable as possible for potential [[international auxiliary language|international auxiliary]] purposes. For that they can be described as half ''a priori'', half ''a posteriori''. There have been many attempts of developing languages with these characteristics, including:
*[[Volapük]]
*[[Esperanto]] and the [[Esperantido]]s:
**[[Ido (language)|Ido]]
**[[Mundolinco]]
*[[Lojban]] (and [[Loglan]])
*[[Glosa]] (and [[Interglossa]])
*[[Lingwa de planeta]]
*[[Sambahsa]]
*[[Toki Pona]]
*[[Sona language (artificial)|Sona]]

==History==

===Ancient linguistic experiments===
Grammatical speculation dates from [[Classical Antiquity]], appearing for instance in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' in Hermogenes's contention that words are not inherently linked to what they refer to; that people apply "a piece of their own voice&amp;nbsp;... to the thing". [[Athenaeus]] of Naucratis, in Book III of [[Deipnosophistae]], tells the story of two figures: Dionysius of Sicily and Alexarchus. Dionysius of Sicily created [[neologism]]s like ''menandros'' "virgin" (from ''menei'' "waiting" and ''andra'' "husband"), ''menekratēs'' "pillar" (from ''menei'' "it remains in one place" and ''kratei'' "it is strong"), and ''ballantion'' "javelin" (from ''balletai enantion'' "thrown against someone"). Incidentally, the more common Greek words for those three are ''parthenos'', ''stulos'', and ''akon''. [[Alexarchus of Macedon]], the brother of King Cassander of Macedon, was the founder of the city of Ouranopolis. Athenaeus recounts a story told by Heracleides of Lembos that Alexarchus "introduced a peculiar vocabulary, referring to a rooster as a "dawn-crier," a barber as a "mortal-shaver," a drachma as "worked silver"...and a herald as an ''aputēs'' [from ''ēputa'' "loud-voiced"]. "He once wrote something...to the public authorities in Casandreia...As for what this letter says, in my opinion not even the [[Apollo|Pythian god]] could make sense of it." While the mechanisms of grammar suggested by classical philosophers were designed to explain existing languages ([[Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Sanskrit]]), they were not used to construct new grammars. Roughly contemporary to Plato, in his descriptive grammar of Sanskrit, [[Pāṇini]] constructed a set of rules for explaining language, so that the text of his grammar may be considered a mixture of natural and constructed language.

===Early constructed languages===
[[File:68r.jpg|thumb|Page 68r of the [[Voynich manuscript]]. This three-page foldout from the manuscript includes a chart that appears astronomical.]]

A legend recorded in the seventh-century [[Irish language|Irish]] work [[Auraicept na n-Éces]] claims that [[Fénius Farsaid]] visited [[Shinar]] after the [[confusion of tongues]], and he and his scholars studied the various languages for ten years, taking the best features of each to create ''in Bérla tóbaide'' ("the selected language"), which he named [[Old Irish|''Goídelc'']]—the Irish language. This appears to be the first mention of the concept of a constructed language in literature.

The earliest non-natural languages were considered less "constructed" than "super-natural", mystical, or divinely inspired. The [[Lingua Ignota]], recorded in the 12th century by St. [[Hildegard of Bingen]] is an example, and apparently the first entirely artificial language.&lt;ref name="foer-2012"&gt;Joshua Foer, [http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/12/24/121224fa_fact_foer "John Quijada and Ithkuil, the Language He Invented"], ''[[The New Yorker]]'', Dec. 24, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a form of private mystical [[cant (language)|cant]] (see also [[Enochian|language of angels]]). An important example from Middle-Eastern culture is [[Balaibalan]], invented in the 16th century.&lt;ref name="higley2007"/&gt;  [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] grammatical speculation was directed at recovering the original language spoken by [[Adam and Eve]] in [[Paradise]], lost in the [[confusion of tongues]]. The first [[Christian]] project for an ideal language is outlined in [[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''[[De vulgari eloquentia]]'', where he searches for the ideal [[Italian language|Italian]] vernacular suited for literature. [[Ramon Llull]]'s ''[[Ramon Llull#Ars generalis ultima (Ars Magna)|Ars Magna]]'' was a project of a perfect language with which the infidels could be convinced of the truth of the Christian faith. It was basically an application of [[combinatorics]] on a given set of concepts.{{Vague|date=October 2014}}{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} During [[the Renaissance]], Lullian and Kabbalistic ideas were drawn upon in a magical context, resulting in [[cryptography|cryptographic]] applications. The [[Voynich manuscript]] may be an example of this.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

===Perfecting language===
Renaissance interest in [[Ancient Egypt]], notably the discovery of the ''[[Hieroglyphica]]'' of [[Horapollo]], and first encounters with the [[Chinese script]] directed efforts towards a perfect written language. [[Johannes Trithemius]], in ''Steganographia'' and ''Polygraphia'', attempted to show how all languages can be reduced to one. In the 17th century, interest in [[Magical thinking|magical]] languages was continued by the [[Rosicrucians]] and [[Alchemy|Alchemists]] (like [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]] and his [[Enochian]]). [[Jakob Boehme]] in 1623 spoke of a "natural language" (''Natursprache'') of the senses.

[[Musical language]]s from the Renaissance were tied up with [[mysticism]], magic and [[alchemy]], sometimes also referred to as the [[language of the birds]]. The [[Solresol]] project of 1817 re-invented the concept in a more pragmatic context.

===17th and 18th century: advent of philosophical languages===
The 17th century saw the rise of projects for "philosophical" or "a priori" languages, such as:

*[[Francis Lodwick]]'s ''A Common Writing'' (1647) and ''The Groundwork or Foundation laid (or So Intended) for the Framing of a New Perfect Language and a Universal Common Writing'' (1652)
* Sir [[Thomas Urquhart]]'s ''Ekskybalauron'' (1651) and ''Logopandecteision''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/urquhart/index.html|title=Logopandecteision|work=uchicago.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1652)
* [[George Dalgarno]]'s ''Ars signorum'', 1661
* [[John Wilkins]]' ''Essay towards a Real Character, and a Philosophical Language'', 1668

These early taxonomic conlangs produced systems of hierarchical classification that were intended to result in both spoken and written expression.  [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] had a similar purpose for his ''lingua generalis'' of 1678, aiming at a lexicon of characters upon which the user might perform calculations that would yield true propositions automatically, as a side-effect developing [[binary calculus]]. These projects were not only occupied with reducing or modelling grammar, but also with the arrangement of all human knowledge into "characters" or hierarchies, an idea that with the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] would ultimately lead to the ''[[Encyclopédie]]''.  Many of these 17th−18th centuries conlangs were [[Pasigraphy|pasigraphies]], or purely written languages with no spoken form or a spoken form that would vary greatly according to the native language of the reader.&lt;ref name="einstein1884"&gt;[[Leopold Einstein]], "Al la historio de la Provoj de Lingvoj Tutmondaj de Leibnitz ĝis la Nuna Tempo", 1884.  Reprinted in ''Fundamenta Krestomatio'', UEA 1992 [1903].&lt;/ref&gt;

Leibniz and the encyclopedists realized that it is impossible to organize human knowledge unequivocally in a tree diagram, and consequently to construct an ''a priori'' language based on such a classification of concepts. Under the entry ''Charactère'', [[D'Alembert]] critically reviewed the projects of philosophical languages of the preceding century. After the ''Encyclopédie'', projects for ''a priori'' languages moved more and more to the lunatic fringe.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} Individual authors, typically unaware of the history of the idea, continued to propose taxonomic philosophical languages until the early 20th century (e.g. [[Ro (language)|Ro]]), but most recent [[engineered language]]s have had more modest goals; some are limited to a specific field, like mathematical formalism or calculus (e.g. [[Lincos (artificial language)|Lincos]] and [[programming language]]s), others are designed for eliminating syntactical ambiguity (e.g., [[Loglan]] and [[Lojban]]) or maximizing conciseness (e.g., [[Ithkuil]]&lt;ref name="foer-2012" /&gt;).

===19th and 20th centuries: auxiliary languages===
{{main article|International auxiliary language}}
Already in the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' attention began to focus on ''a posteriori'' auxiliary languages. [[Joachim Faiguet de Villeneuve]] in the article on ''Langue'' wrote a short proposition of a "laconic" or regularized grammar of [[French (language)|French]]. During the 19th century, a bewildering variety of such International Auxiliary Languages (IALs) were proposed, so that [[Louis Couturat]] and [[Léopold Leau]] in ''Histoire de la langue universelle'' (1903) reviewed 38 projects.

The first of these that made any international impact was [[Volapük]], proposed in 1879 by [[Johann Martin Schleyer]]; within a decade, 283 Volapükist clubs were counted all over the globe. However, disagreements between Schleyer and some prominent users of the language led to schism, and by the mid-1890s it fell into obscurity, making way for [[Esperanto]], proposed in 1887 by [[L. L. Zamenhof|Ludwik Lejzer Zamenhof]], and its [[Esperantido|descendants]].  [[Interlingua]], the most recent auxlang to gain a significant number of speakers, emerged in 1951, when the [[International Auxiliary Language Association]] published its [[Interlingua–English Dictionary]] and an accompanying [[Interlingua: A Grammar of the International Language|grammar]]. The success of Esperanto did not stop others from trying to construct new auxiliary languages, such as Leslie Jones' [[Eurolengo]], which mixes elements of English and Spanish.

[[Loglan]] (1955) and its descendants constitute a pragmatic return to the aims of the ''a priori'' languages, tempered by the requirement of usability of an auxiliary language. Thus far, these modern ''a priori'' languages have garnered only small groups of speakers.

[[Robot Interaction Language]] (2010) is a spoken language that is optimized for communication between machines and humans. The major goals of ROILA are that it should be easily learnable by the human user, and optimized for efficient recognition by computer [[speech recognition]] algorithms.

===Artlangs===
{{main article|Artistic language}}
Language can be artistic to the extent that artists use language as a source of creativity in art, poetry, calligraphy or as a metaphor to address themes as cultural diversity and the vulnerability of the individual in a globalizing world. 

Some people prefer however to take pleasure in constructing, crafting a language by a conscious decision for reasons of literary enjoyment or aesthetic reasons without any claim of usefulness. Such [[Artistic language|artistic languages]] begin to appear in Early Modern literature (in [[Gargantua and Pantagruel|Pantagruel]], and in [[Utopia]]n contexts), but they only seem to gain notability as serious projects beginning in the 20th century.&lt;ref name="higley2007" /&gt;  ''[[A Princess of Mars]]'' (1912) by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] was possibly the first fiction of that century to feature a constructed language. [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] developed a family of related fictional languages and discussed artistic languages publicly, giving a lecture entitled "''[[A Secret Vice]]''" in 1931 at a congress. (Orwell's Newspeak is considered a satire of an [[International auxiliary language|IAL]] rather than an artistic language proper.)

By the beginning of the first decade of the 21st century, it had become common for science-fiction and fantasy works set in other worlds to feature constructed languages, or more commonly, an extremely limited but defined vocabulary which ''suggests'' the existence of a complete language, and constructed languages are a regular part of the genre, appearing in ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[Star Trek]]'', ''[[Lord of the Rings]] ([[Elvish languages (Middle-earth)|Elvish]])'', ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'', ''[[Atlantis: The Lost Empire]]'', ''[[Game of Thrones]] ([[Dothraki language]] and [[Valyrian languages]])'', ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'', ''[[Dune (franchise)|Dune]]'' and the ''[[Myst]]'' series of computer adventure games.

==Modern conlang organizations==
Various paper zines on constructed languages were published from the 1970s through the 1990s, such as ''Glossopoeic Quarterly'', ''Taboo Jadoo'', and ''The Journal of Planned Languages''.&lt;ref name="rosta2007"&gt;[http://archives.conlang.info/ge/bhaelvhua/vhurtaethuan.html "How did you find out that there were other conlangers?"] Conlang list posting by And Rosta, 14 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
The Conlang Mailing List was founded in 1991, and later split off an AUXLANG mailing list dedicated to international auxiliary languages. &lt;!-- to do: find exact date of Conlang/Auxlang split --&gt;  In the early to mid-1990s a few conlang-related zines were published as email or websites, such as ''Vortpunoj''&lt;ref name="vortpunoj"&gt;[http://revo.bierfaristo.com/vortpunoj.html Archives of ''Vortpunoj''] at Steve Brewer's website&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Model Languages''.  The Conlang mailing list has developed a community of [[List of language inventors|conlangers]] with its own customs, such as translation challenges and [[translation relay]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://journal.media-culture.org.au/0003/languages.php Audience, Uglossia, and Conlang: Inventing Languages on the Internet] by Sarah L. Higley. M/C: A Journal of Media and Culture 3.1 (2000). ({{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050616085932/http://journal.media-culture.org.au/0003/languages.php |date=June 16, 2005 }}, media-culture.org.au site sometimes has problems.)&lt;/ref&gt; and its own terminology.  Sarah Higley reports from results of her surveys that the demographics of the Conlang list are primarily men from North America and western Europe, with a smaller number from Oceania, Asia, the Middle East, and South America, with an age range from thirteen to over sixty; the number of women participating has increased over time.

More recently founded online communities include the [[Zompist]] Bulletin Board (ZBB; since 2001) and the Conlanger Bulletin Board.  Discussion on these forums includes presentation of members' conlangs and feedback from other members, discussion of natural languages, whether particular conlang features have natural language precedents, and how interesting features of natural languages can be repurposed for conlangs, posting of interesting short texts as translation challenges, and meta-discussion about the philosophy of conlanging, conlangers' purposes, and whether conlanging is an art or a hobby.&lt;ref name="higley2007"/&gt;  Another 2001 survey by Patrick Jarrett showed an average age of 30.65, with the average time since starting to invent languages 11.83 years.&lt;ref name="jarrett2001"&gt;[http://archives.conlang.info/bhe/gherque/chivirchein.html "Update mailing list statistics—FINAL"], Conlang list posting by Patrick Jarrett, 13 September 2001&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent thread on the ZBB showed that many conlangers spend a relatively small amount of time on any one conlang, moving from one project to another; about a third spend years on developing the same language.&lt;ref name="avg_age"&gt;[http://www.spinnoff.com/zbb/viewtopic.php?t=28831 "Average life of a conlang"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614035040/http://www.spinnoff.com/zbb/viewtopic.php?t=28831 |date=2011-06-14 }} thread on Zompist Bulletin Board, 15 August 2008; accessed 26 August 2008.&lt;br/&gt;[http://archives.conlang.info/wu/seifi/phirqondal.html "Average life of a conlang"] thread on Conlang mailing list, 27 August 2008 (should be archived more persistently than the ZBB thread)&lt;/ref&gt;{{portal|Constructed languages}}

Each character in '''[[Commedia dell'arte]]''' is distinctly different, and defined by their movement, actions, [[Commedia dell'Arte Masks|masks]], and costumes. These costumes show their social status and background.

'''[[Pantalone]]''' typically wore tight red pants and a matching shirt, a long black cape, black or red pointed shoes, and a belt that had a purse attached. Pantalone also carried a knife and handkerchief, and wore glasses. His hat sat very close to his head, and did not have a brim – very much like a skullcap. He might also wear a [[codpiece]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Lea, K. M. Italian popular comedy. A study in the Commedia dell’Arte, 1560–1620 with special reference to the English stage. 1934. Reprint.

New York: Hill and Wang, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Il Dottore]]''' was dressed almost entirely in black – shoes, pants, shirt, robe, belt, and hat – broken only by a white handkerchief, white ruffled collar, white cuffs on his sleeves, or maybe white socks. The pants came to his knees, as did the full cloak that stood out, like a dress with a petticoat. His hat could either be small and look like a skullcap, or larger and floppy with a wide brim.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''[[Il Capitano]]''' did not have a consistent dress code, but he did have a consistent costume theme. He wore the current soldiers' outfit from a foreign country.  Sometimes his clothes were slashed to show that he had been in battle. His hat was overdone and typically had large feathers sticking out of it. Ribbons and shiny buttons often cluttered his clothes. He always carried a sword, and in the seventeenth century the sword upgraded to a gun. Every Il Capitano costume also included a coat or cloak, that he could fling off in a moment of rage or passion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''[[Innamorati|The Lovers]]''' wore whatever was the latest fashion. They wore a lot of makeup, but tastefully done to match the elaborate outfits. They never wore masks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''[[Pulcinella]]''' always had white baggy pants and shirt, large buttons on the shirt, and a piece under his garments that made his belly appear very large. His clothes were held on by a rope belt, where a dagger and purse would hang. A humpback piece was sometimes used. He also wore a mask that depicted a large, sometimes broken nose. His hat was short and fluffy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Gordon, Mel. Lazzi: The Comedic Routines of the Commedia dell’Arte.

[[File:SAND Maurice Masques et bouffons 07.jpg|thumb|upright|Scaramouche]]
{{Right|[[File:André Derain - Arlequin et Pierrot.jpg|thumb|Harlequin in diamonds, and Pierrot in white]]}}
'''[[Harlequin|Harlequin's]]''' costume has varied over time. At first, in the mid sixteen century, his clothes were light colored and baggy, with red, yellow, and green patches with no particular pattern. His facial hair suggested a younger man for a few years, but then a fuller beard was worn later. He had a black mask and a feathered white hat. About a hundred years later, his signature outfit changed to include white stripes and colored diamonds, or triangles instead of patches. For the next 200 years, the suit got tighter, and a black belt was added. He wore a hat with two points, and his clothes had lots of sparkles. By the twentieth century, all the sparkles, collar ruffles, and large fancy hats were gone. Arlecchino wore a very small hat, the mask was sometimes swapped out for a face-painted diamond, and the costume pattern became entirely made up of diamonds with a small bow or collar.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''[[Brighella]]''' wore a servant's suit of rough off-white fabric, trimmed with green on the sides of his pants and down the front of his long shirt. His mask had a hooked nose, beard, and mustache. His dagger was worn at his belt.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''[[Coviello]]''' had a lighter beige mask with a large nose, and his white costume had bells attached.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''[[Mezzettino]]''' wore servant's clothes with red stripes, but without the common servant's mask.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''[[Zanni]]''' was the main servant, who wore large loose pants and a shirt that had a hood.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''[[Scapino]]''' wore outfits with white and green stripes, and his mask had a hooked nose and pointed beard.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''[[Pierrot]]''' had loose white clothing, with a large matching collar. He painted his face white instead of wearing a mask.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''[[Pedrolino|Pedrolino's]]''' costume was essentially like Pierrot's – white, big buttons, short hat, and white face – but it was way too big for him, and the sleeves covered his hands, to emphasize that Pedrolino was a little person in hand-me-downs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''{{ill|Peppe Nappa|it}}''' copied Pierrot's clothes, but wore them in blue instead of white.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''[[Columbina|Columbina's]]''' costume reflected her current master's, but included an apron. She wore no mask, but instead a bonnet, and her skirts were of different colors.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''[[Scaramouche]]''' wore black clothes without a mask. Defiant eyebrows and a powdered face accompanied the large black mustache. He had a white collar, and a large loose hat that hung down over his neck.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''[[Tartaglia (commedia dell'arte)|Tartaglia]]''' wore a black hat and very thick glasses.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''[[Rosetta]]''' was Pulcinella's maid or wife, who wore a dress with patches, like the early Arrlechino.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''[[Trivelino]]''' was a Zanni who dressed in the Arlecchino fashion.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

[[Image:Noël Coward Theatre 3.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The [[Noël Coward Theatre]] in London]]
A prolific playwright and successful actor and director, [[Noël Coward]] has had a significant impact on culture in the English-speaking world.  ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine said that he had a unique "sense of personal style, a combination of cheek and chic, pose and poise".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,941819-2,00.html "Noel Coward at 70"], 26 December 1969, accessed 8 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Coward wrote over 50 published plays and many albums of original songs, in addition to musical theatre (including the operetta ''[[Bitter Sweet]]''), comic [[revue]]s, poetry, short stories, a novel and three volumes of autobiography. Books of his song lyrics, diaries and letters also have been published.  Some of his plays, such as ''[[Hay Fever (play)|Hay Fever]]'', ''[[Private Lives]]'', ''[[Design for Living]]'', ''[[Present Laughter]]'' and ''[[Blithe Spirit (play)|Blithe Spirit]]'', have entered the regular theatre repertoire.  His stage and film acting and directing career spanned six decades, and his cabaret performances were very popular in the 1950s and 1960s.  Coward won an [[Academy Honorary Award]] in 1943 for his naval film drama ''[[In Which We Serve]]''.  Many of Coward's plays were adapted for film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://infotrac.galegroup.com/galenet/wes_ttda?cause=http%3A%2F%2Fgalenet.galegroup.com%2Fservlet%2FGLD%2Fform%3FlocID%3Dwes_ttda%26l%3D2&amp;cont=&amp;sev=temp&amp;type=session&amp;sserv=no ''Contemporary Authors Online''], Thomson Gale, 2004, accessed 30 December 2008: requires subscription; and [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002021/filmoyear Noel Coward] at the IMDB database, accessed 12 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Coward was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in 1969 and was elected a fellow of the [[Royal Society of Literature]].&lt;ref name=gale&gt;[http://www.gale.cengage.com/servlet/ItemDetailServlet?region=9&amp;imprint=000&amp;titleCode=GAL2&amp;type=4&amp;id=110195 "Noël Coward",] ''Contemporary Authors Online'', Thomson Gale, 2004, accessed 30 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; A statue of Coward was unveiled by the Queen Mother in the foyer of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/230250.stm "Coward statue unveiled"], BBC news, 8 December 1998, accessed 8 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Noël Coward Theatre]] in [[St Martin's Lane]], originally called the New Theatre, was renamed in his honour in 2006.

==Critical reputation and legacy==
The playwright [[John Osborne]] said, "Mr Coward is his own invention and contribution to this century.  Anyone who cannot see that should keep well away from the theatre."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noelcoward.com/ "Noel Coward"], Introduction page to NoelCoward.com, accessed 8 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Kenneth Tynan wrote in 1964, "Even the youngest of us will know, in fifty years' time, exactly what we mean by 'a very Noel Coward sort of person'."&lt;ref name=tynan&gt;Tynan, pp. 286–88&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The Times]]'' said of him, "None of the great figures of the English theatre has been more versatile than he," and the paper ranked his plays in "the classical tradition of [[William Congreve|Congreve]], [[Richard Sheridan|Sheridan]], [[Oscar Wilde|Wilde]] and [[George Bernard Shaw|Shaw]]".&lt;ref name=timesobit&gt;''The Times'', 27 March 1973, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; In praise of his versatility, another admirer said, "There are probably greater painters than Noël, greater novelists than Noël, greater librettists, greater composers of music, greater singers, greater dancers, greater comedians, greater tragedians, greater stage producers, greater film directors, greater cabaret artists, greater TV stars. If there are, they are fourteen different people. Only one man combined all fourteen different labels – The Master."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noelcoward.com/html/quotations.html Seventieth birthday tribute to Coward by Lord Mountbatten] Quotations, NoelCoward.com, accessed 3 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dhaka Nawab Family]] patronised the production of several [[silent film]]s in the 1920s and 30s. In 1931, the East Bengal Cinematograph Society released the first full-length feature film in Bangladesh, titled the ''Last Kiss''. The first feature film in [[East Pakistan]], ''[[Mukh O Mukhosh]]'', was released in 1956. During the 1960s, 25–30 films were produced annually in Dacca. By the 2000s, Bangladesh produced 80–100 films a year. While the Bangladeshi film industry has achieved limited commercial success; the country has produced notable independent film makers. [[Zahir Raihan]] was a prominent documentary-maker who was assassinated in 1971. The late [[Tareque Masud]] is regarded as one of Bangladesh's outstanding directors due to his numerous productions on historical and social issues. Masud was honoured by [[FIPRESCI]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 2002 for his film ''[[Matir Moina|The Clay Bird]]''. [[Tanvir Mokammel]], [[Mostofa Sarwar Farooki]], [[Humayun Ahmed]], [[Alamgir Kabir (film maker)|Alamgir Kabir]] and [[Chashi Nazrul Islam]] are other prominent directors of Bangladesh cinema.

==Dress==

The most popular dressing styles for women are ''[[Sari|shari]]'' or ''[[salwar kameez|shælwar kamij]]'', while men usually prefer western clothing to the traditional ''[[lungi]]''. This area is credited for the revival of the ''[[jamdani]]'' saree due to the many local saree stores selling and promoting these locally hand-made traditional Bengali sarees of fine patterned [[muslin]]. Jamdanis are 100% hand woven and originate from the Mughal era. [[Jamdani]]s are produced by a traditional high quality cottage industry, which is slowly dying out due to the slow production process. A single medium-range Jamdani saree may take as long as 3&amp;nbsp;months to complete.&lt;ref name="troy"&gt;{{Cite journal

In a '''cumulative tale''', sometimes also called a '''chain tale''', action or dialogue repeats and builds up in some way as the tale progresses. With only the sparest of plots, these tales often depend upon repetition and rhythm for their effect, and can require a skilled storyteller to negotiate their tongue-twisting repetitions in performance.&lt;ref name=greenwood&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Ashliman|first= D.L.|authorlink=D. L. Ashliman|editor= Donald. Haase|encyclopedia= The Greenwood encyclopedia of folktales and fairy tales |title=Chain Tale|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w9KEk9wQPjkC|publisher= Greenwood Press|isbn= 978-0-313-33441-2|page= 176}}&lt;/ref&gt; The climax is sometimes abrupt and sobering as in "[[The Gingerbread Man]]."   The device often takes the form of a [[cumulative song]] or [[nursery rhyme]]. Many cumulative tales feature a series of animals or forces of nature each more powerful than the last.

==History==
Cumulative tales have a long pedigree. In an early Jewish [[Midrash]], considered to date from the sixth century AD, [[Abraham]] is brought before King [[Nimrod]], who commands him to worship fire.&lt;ref&gt;See the [[Nimrod#Text of the Midrash Raba version|Text of the Midrash Raba version]]. This is not itself a cumulative tale, though many cumulative tales seem to echo its theme.&lt;/ref&gt; Abraham replies that it would be more reasonable to worship water, which can quench fire and is therefore more powerful. When this premise is granted, he points out that the clouds, as sustainers of water, are more worthy of worship, and then that the wind that disperses them is more powerful still. Finally he confronts Nimrod with the observation that "man can stand up against the wind or shield himself behind the walls of his house" ([[Genesis Rabba]] xxxviii).

There is a similar tale, [[The Mouse Turned into a Maid]], in the [[Panchatantra]], in which the mouse-maid is successively introduced to the sun, the cloud, the wind and the mountain. She prefers each in turn as stronger than the last, but finally a mouse is found to be stronger than even the mountain, and so she marries the mouse. Stories of this type, such as the Japanese [[The Husband of the Rat's Daughter]], are widely diffused.&lt;ref&gt;[[D. L. Ashliman]], "[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type2031c.html The Mouse Who Was to Marry the Sun: fables of Aarne-Thompson type 2031C]"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
In the [[Aarne-Thompson]] classification system, types 2000-2100 are all cumulative tales, including:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/folktexts.html D. L. Ashliman's page of story types]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dakshina Bharat Hindi Prachar Sabha''' is an organisation whose main goal is to improve [[Hindi language|Hindi]] literacy among the non-Hindi speaking people of [[South India]]. The headquarters are located at Thanikachalam Road, [[T. Nagar]], [[Chennai]].

The organisation was established by [[Annie Besant]] with support from [[Mahatma Gandhi]], who became the founder president of the Sabha, who held the post till his death. In 1964, the institution was recognised by the [[Indian Government]] as one of the [[List of Institutes of National Importance|Institutes of National Importance]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dbhpscentral.org/introduction.html|title=Welcome to Dakshin Bharath Hindi Prachar Sabha {{!}} Introduction|website=www.dbhpscentral.org|access-date=2017-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Hindi movement in South India was started in the year 1918 by Mahatma Gandhi. Gandhi saw the need to unite the northern and southern states of the country in the greatest interest of integration of the nation, as Hindi was spoken by the largest section of the people of India. Therefore, he founded the Dakshin Bharat Hindi Prachar Sabha at Madras to propagate the study of Hindi in the then [[Madras Presidency]] and princely states of [[Banganapalle State|Banganapalle]], [[Cochin kingdom|Cochin]], [[Hyderabad state|Hyderabad]], [[Mysore kingdom|Mysore]], [[Pudukkottai state|Pudukkottai]], [[Sandur State|Sanduru]] and [[Travancore]]. The Sabha was inaugurated by Annie Besant on 17 June 1918.&lt;ref name="Hindu_100YearsOld"&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/dakshin-bharat-hindi-prachar-sabha-is-100-years-old/article24188242.ece |title= Dakshin Bharat Hindi Prachar Sabha is 100 years old |date=18 June 2018|newspaper=The Hindu|accessdate=28 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement was inaugurated by the [[Annie Besant]] under the presidency at Gokhale Hall in Madras. The first Hindi class was taken by Gandhi's son [[Devdas Gandhi]]. Hindi training schools were started in Andhra and Tamil Nadu. The number of students increased from 80 in 1919 to hundreds of thousands in subsequent years. Today the movement can claim more than 7000 workers working in 6000 centres, covering the entire area of the five states, viz. Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, with an area of 650,000 square kilometers with a population of about 120 million.

By 1927, the Hindi Prachar Sabha emerged as an independent organization, and Mahatma Gandhi remained its president until his death in 1948. During the silver jubilee celebrations of the Sabha, Gandhi stayed for nearly 10 days on the Sabha's premises.&lt;ref name="Hindu_100YearsOld"/&gt;

Gandhiji desired that the ‘Hindi Prachar‘ in the south should be carried on by involving the local people of the respective area. Until 1920, this Sabha had its office at [[George Town, Chennai|George Town]] in Madras and after some years shifted to [[Mylapore]] and then to [[Triplicane]] where it functioned till 1936. In 1936, the Sabha shifted to its present headquarters at [[T. Nagar]]. Preliminary examinations were held regularly from 1922. The first degree-level examination ‘Rashtrabasha Visharad’ was conducted and convocation held in 1931, which was addressed by Kaka Kalelkar. The Sabha celebrated its silver jubilee in 1946 after the [[Second World War]] and Gandhiji presided over the celebrations. To commemorate his presence during the silver jubilee celebrations in the sabha and mark that historic occasion, it was decided to build a Gandhi Mantap at the celebration spot. Accordingly, a mantap was built and it was inaugurated in June 1963 by [[Morarji Desai]].

A landmark in the recent history of the Sabha was the establishment of the National Hindi Research Library built at a cost of {{INR}} 8.5 million, with financial assistance from the [[Government of India]]. Another important landmark is the building of ‘Mahatma Gandhi Convocation Hall’ (Mahatma Gandhi Padavidan Mantap) exclusively for the use of holding the annual convocation and other functions of the Sabha.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2300">'''Drinkers Masses''', to include '''Gamblers Masses''' (Latin: ''Missa Potatorum, Officium Lusorum''), was a [[genre]] of medieval Latin poetry which parodied the [[Roman Catholic]] [[Latin Mass]] in order to make fun of drinking and gambling monks and clerics. These masses were written between about 1100 to 1700 by [[clerici vagantes]] (''wandering clerics''), with the first example being the gamblers mass (''officium lusorum''), found in the [[Carmina Burana]].  The genre is somewhat related to other medieval ecclesiastic parody, such as the [[Feast of Fools]] and the [[Feast of the Ass]].

[[File:Codex_Buranus-91-giocatori.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Drinking [[dice]] players, from the ''[[Carmina Burana]]'']]

==Description==
These parody masses generally follow line for line the words of the Latin Mass, as well as quotations from the [[Latin Vulgate]]. They are carefully reworded to create a [[parody]] of the Mass, with themes such as [[Dionysus|Bacchus]], the god of wine, and Decius, the god of dice ([[Decius]] was also the name of a Roman emperor), replacing the "[[Dominus (title)|Dominus]]" and "[[Deus]]" (Lord and God) of the Mass. There is much imagery of dice being used in [[gambling]], and of drinking cups, wine, and taverns, ending with losing all of one’s possessions, including clothes, through drinking and gambling.

'''Eskayan''' is an artificial auxiliary language of the [[Eskaya clan]] of [[Bohol]], an island province of the [[Philippines]]. It is grammatically [[Boholano dialect|Boholano]], the native language of Bohol, with a substituted lexicon.&lt;ref name="Ted"&gt;Milan Ted D Torralba ‘The morphology of the Eskaya language’ A term paper submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements in LNG 704 (Morphology &amp; Syntax) The Pontifical and Royal University of Santo Tomas.

[[File:Statue Mariano Datahan.JPG|thumb|right|Statue of Mariano Datahan, inscribed with Eskayan script]]

Eskayan has a number of idiosyncrasies that have attracted wide interest. One of its most immediately remarkable features is its unique writing system of over 1,000 syllabic characters, said to be modeled on parts of the human body,&lt;ref name="bibingka"&gt;Hector Santos.[http://www.bibingka.com/dahon/mystery/eskaya.htm ''The Eskaya Script''] in [http://www.bibingka.com/dahon/default.htm A Philippine Leaf] (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; and its non-Philippine lexicon.

The earliest attested document in Eskayan provisionally dates from 1908, and was on display at the Bohol Museum until September 2006.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

July, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Pinay’s language was "rediscovered" in the early 20th century by [[Mariano Datahan]] (born Mariano Sumatra, ca. 1875–1949), a Messianic rebel soldier who transmitted it to his followers. Datahan had founded a utopian community in southeast Bohol in the aftermath of the [[Philippine–American War]], in order to resist imperial claims and establish an indigenous nation in Bohol, and the Eskayan language and script were seen as the embodiment of this incipient national culture.&lt;ref name="Kelly2013"&gt;{{cite web|author=Piers Kelly |url=https://www.academia.edu/2612659/The_word_made_flesh_An_ethnographic_history_of_Eskayan_a_utopian_language_in_the_southern_Philippines |title=2012. [Excerpt only&amp;#93; The word made flesh: An ethnographic history of Eskayan, a utopian language in the southern Philippines &amp;#124; Piers Kelly |publisher=Academia.edu |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2015-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent research strongly suggests that the Eskayan language was created in the period after Spanish contact had been established.  Evidence of this includes the presence of "native" terms (i.e., not borrowed or calqued) for post-contact cultural categories such as "pope" and "aeroplane". Further, the language makes semantic distinctions that are made in Spanish and English but not in Visayan (such as between "moon" and "month"). It is highly plausible that Eskayan vocabulary was created by taking parallel Spanish-English-Visayan wordlists from textbooks, and replacing the Visayan layer with Eskayan. Finally, the Eskayan script bears strong similarities to 19th-century Copperplate handwriting.&lt;ref name="Kelly2013" /&gt;

Indigenous auxiliary languages with accompanying creation myths are attested elsewhere in the world. One notable case is the [[Damin]] ceremonial language of the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]] which is said to have been the creation of the ancestor Kalthad; another are the [[pandanus language]]s of the Medan region of Papua New Guinea.

== Classification ==
Eskayan is a "sophisticated encryption" of the Cebuano language.&lt;ref name=Kelly2012&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kelly, Piers|date=2012|title=Your word against mine: How a rebel language and script of the Philippines was created, suppressed, recovered and contested.|journal=The Australian Journal of Anthropology|volume=23|pages=357–378|url=https://www.academia.edu/2588920/2012._Your_word_against_mine_How_a_rebel_language_and_script_of_the_Philippines_was_created_suppressed_recovered_and_contested}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shows no lexical similarity to any of the indigenous languages of the Philippines, apart from a very few Cebuano words. Grammatically, however, it is Cebuano.&lt;ref&gt;Cristina J Martinez ''Gahum ug Gubat: A Study of Eskayan Texts, Symbolic Subversion and Cultural Constructivity''. Unpublished manuscript, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stella Marie de los Santos Consul Iniskaya: A linear linguistic description. A Dissertation presented to the Faculty of the Graduate School Cebu Normal University. September, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the words were invented, though with inspiration from Spanish and English vocabulary and phonotactics.&lt;ref name=Kelly2013 /&gt; Some Spanish words had their meanings changed, such as ''astro'' 'sun' (from 'star') and ''tre'' 'two' (from 'three').

Dr. Ernie Constantino (Professor of the Linguistics Department of the University of the Philippines) argued that the Visayan-Eskaya ethnolanguage is only a constructed language whose phonology, grammar, and/or vocabulary have been consciously devised by an individual or group, instead of having evolved naturally. This ethnolanguage would then be comparable to [[Esperanto]] and [[Ido language| Ido]] in origin, though not in purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Lexical Retrieval in L1, L2, L3, and L4 of the Bilingual Eskayan Tribe in Taytay, Duero, Bohol|last = Tubac|first = Angelo|publisher = Unpublished Masteral Thesis. University of San Carlos-Cebu City|year = 2013|isbn = |location = |pages = 13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Writing system ==
{{Main|Eskayan script}}
The Eskayan script has both alphabetic{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} and syllabic components. A basic 'alphabet' of 46 characters accounts for most of the common sounds and syllables used in Eskayan while a broader subset totalling over 1000 is used to represent the remaining syllables. The unusual diversity of consonant and vowel clusters accounts for this relatively large number of composite characters, which even includes superfluous symbols.&lt;ref&gt;Ma. Cristina J Martinez ''Gahum ug Gubat: A Study of Eskayan Texts, Symbolic Subversion and Cultural Constructivity''. Unpublished manuscript, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;
The symbols are said to be based on parts of the human anatomy, though many are clearly based on the cursive Roman alphabet.

== Romanised orthography ==
A romanised form of Eskayan is used in the cultural schools for the purpose of exposition. Although not strictly standardised, this orthography has elements in common with the Spanish system once used for transliterating Cebuano. E.g., the letters {{angbr|i}} and {{angbr|e}} are interchangeable symbols representing the sound {{IPA|/ɪ/}}; the ‘ll’ combination is pronounced {{IPA|/lj/}} and the letter {{angbr|c}} will be pronounced {{IPA|/s/}} when it precedes a front vowel, as in Spanish. A notable innovation in Eskayan romanised orthography is the letter combination ‘chd’ which represents the sound {{IPA|/d͡ʒ/}}.&lt;ref name="classification" /&gt;

== Phonology and phonotactics ==
Eskayan shares all the same phonemes as Boholano-Visayan (the particular variety of Cebuano spoken on Bohol) and even includes the distinctive Boholano voiced palatal affricate {{IPA|/d͡ʒ/}} that appears in Visayan words such as ''maayo'' {{IPA|[maʔad͡ʒo]}} (‘good’). With the exception of this phoneme, Eskayan shares the same basic phonology as Cebuano-Visayan, Tagalog and many other Philippine languages.

The phonotactics of Eskayan, on the other hand, are quite different from those of Boholano-Visayan and Philippine languages generally. This can be seen in Eskayan words such as ''bosdipir'' {{IPA|[bosdɪpɪr]}} (‘eel’), ''guinposlan'' {{IPA|[ɡɪnposlan]}} (‘face’), ''ilcdo'' {{IPA|[ɪlkdo]}} (‘knee’) and ''estrapirado'' {{IPA|[ɪstrapɪrado]}} (‘flower’) that contain consonant sequences like {{IPA|/sd/}}, {{IPA|/np/}}, {{IPA|/sl/}}, {{IPA|/lkd/}} and {{IPA|/str/}} which do not feature in Philippine languages. Furthermore, a significant number of Eskayan words have phonemic sequences that are common in Spanish or in Spanish loans into Boholano-Visayan but appear rarely, if ever, in non-borrowed words.&lt;ref name="classification" /&gt;

== Case system ==
Eskayan conforms to the same syntactic and morphological structure as Cebuano. Accordingly, Eskayan nouns are uninflected but may be marked for case with one of several preceding case markers.

The table below shows the basic case system of Eskayan, with Cebuano equivalents in brackets.&lt;ref&gt;This is modelled on Himmelman's table of Cebuano case marker's in Nikolaus Himmelmann, ‘The Austronesian languages of Asia and Madagascar: typological characteristics’. ''The Austronesian Languages of Asia and Madagascar'', ed. by Nikolaus Himmelmann and Alexander Adelaar. London: Routledge, 2005. Cited in Fuhui Hsieh &amp; Michael Tanangkingsing ‘The Empty Root in Cebuano and Kavalan: A Cognitive Perspective’ Papers from the Tenth International Conference on Austronesian Linguistics. January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eskayan and Cebuano texts, which are always written face-to-face in the bilingual Eskayan books, generally have a one-to-one correspondence. For example:

== Lexicon ==

=== Cebuano influences ===
Despite its structural equivalence to Eskayan, Cebuano has had a very limited lexical influence on the language. In a comparison of core Swadesh vocabulary, there are eight identifiable cognates.&lt;ref name="classification" /&gt;

Eskayan words have a one-to-one correspondence with Cebuano, so that when two words are homophones in Cebuano, they are homophones in Eskayan as well. However, the verbal morphology is quite different: Cebuano has twenty-four verbal affixes which indicate [[grammatical aspect]] and other feature, whereas Eskayan has just five ''(muy-, dil-, pur-, yu-, yi-)'', each of which can substitute for any of the Cebuano affixes. This often makes Eskayan grammar ambiguous, and dependent on the parallel Cebuano text. In addition, some Eskayan verbs are equivalent to specific inflections of Cebuano verbs despite not having any morphology. For example, Eskayan ''imprus'' 'was taken on', which is basic root, translates Cebuano ''gipuslan'', where ''gi-'' indicates that the action is [[perfective aspect|completed]] and performed on the [[agent trigger|grammatical agent]]. This is likely because the prototype for many Eskayan words was an early English–Spanish–Visayan trilingual, with the Visayan (Cebuano) glosses crossed out and replaced with Eskayan.&lt;ref name="Kelly2012" /&gt;

=== Spanish influences ===
Although the Eskayan lexicon bears a marked Spanish influence,&lt;ref&gt;See op.cit Martinez ''Gahum ug Gubat''(132) and Kelly ''The Classification of the Eskayan Language of Bohol''(12)&lt;/ref&gt; the loan-patterns are hard to map.&lt;ref name="classification" /&gt; Some Spanish words appear to have been directly borrowed into Eskayan with virtually no semantic or phonetic alterations. E.g., the Eskayan word ''merido'', meaning ‘husband’, is evidently loaned from the Spanish ''marido'', also meaning ‘husband’. Others retain only a few of the semantic properties of the original. E.g., the word ''astro'' means ‘sun’ in Eskayan but ‘star’ in Spanish. In some interesting cases Eskayan lexical items appear to be borrowed but are assigned new meanings entirely. E.g., the Eskayan ''memorya'' (‘sky’) does not coincide semantically with the Spanish ''memoria'' (‘memory’). One of the most intriguing examples of such an ‘interrupted loan’ is that of the Eskayan ''tre'' (‘two’) seemingly derived from the Spanish ''tres'' (‘three’). Here the semantic property of ‘number’ was retained but the actual quantity it represented was reassigned.&lt;ref name="classification" /&gt;

== Theories and controversies ==
In the 1980s and 1990s, the Eskaya community attracted the interest of local mystics who promoted the notion that their language was of exotic origin.&lt;ref name="survey"&gt;Piers Kelly.  [http://www.esnips.com/doc/df6569b1-bc03-411f-9087-49dd9f2139a3/Survey--Review ''Visayan-Eskaya Secondary Source Materials: Survey &amp; Review'' Part One: 1980–1993] Produced for the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples, Bohol, Philippines. 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the few linguists who have examined Eskayan generally concur that it is structurally Cebuano but lexically innovative, suggesting that Eskayan is an auxiliary language or a highly sophisticated form of disguised speech encoded from Cebuano.

'''''Feed''''' or ''feedmag.com'' (1995&amp;ndash;2001) was one of the earliest [[online magazine| online magazines]] that relied entirely on its original content. 

==History==
''Feed'' was founded in New York by [[Stefanie Syman]] and [[Steven Berlin Johnson|Steven Johnson]] in May 1995,&lt;ref name=rosenberg&gt;{{Cite news| last = Rosenberg| first = Scott| title = More lights go out on the Web| work=Salon| date = 2001-06-10 |url=http://www.salon.com/2001/06/09/suck_feed/}}&lt;/ref&gt; with novelist [[Sam Lipsyte]] serving as one of its editors.

One of the web's earliest general-interest daily publications,&lt;ref name=manjoo&gt;{{Cite news| last = Manjoo| first = Farhad| title = Salon: Last One Standing| work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |publisher=[[Conde Nast]]
| accessdate = 2014-11-15| date = 2001-06-15| url = http://archive.wired.com/techbiz/media/news/2001/06/44464?currentPage=all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feed focused on media, pop culture, technology, science and the arts.  

Feed soon found a devoted following among an alternative readership and was critically acclaimed, but as a small independent publication it struggled to raise sufficient advertising revenue.&lt;ref name=hu&gt;{{Cite news | last = Hu| first = Jim| title = Does a Web zine network make business sense?| work = [[CNET]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]| accessdate = 2014-11-15| date = January 2, 2002| url = https://www.cnet.com/news/does-a-web-zine-network-make-business-sense/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2000, following a sharp downturn in Internet investment, Feed merged with the popular editorial site [[Suck.com]] to create [[Automatic Media]].&lt;ref name=wingfield&gt;{{Cite news | last = Wingfield| first = Nick| title = Pioneering Webzines join forces| work = [[ZDNet]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]| accessdate = 2014-11-21| date = 2000-07-09| url = http://zdnet.com.com/2100-11-522048.html| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20040816163711/http://zdnet.com.com/2100-11-522048.html| archivedate = 2004-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two sites sought to streamline their operations and collaborate with low staffing costs. Their joint project [[Plastic.com]] was founded with only four staffed employees. Despite the faithful cult following and a combined reader base of over 1 million, Automatic Media folded in June 2001, and Feed closed operations.&lt;ref name=rosenberg /&gt;&lt;ref name=usatoday&gt;{{Cite news | title = Online mags 'Feed,' 'Suck' to shut down | work = USA Today| accessdate = 2014-11-18 | date = 2001-06-11| url = http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/news/2001-06-11-net-mags-feed-suck-shut-down.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Founded in 1985 by [[Rupert Neve]], Focusrite's first contracts included a commission from [[George Martin|Sir George Martin]] to build extensions to [[Air studios]]' custom [[Neve Electronics|Neve]] consoles, initially the vintage recording console in Martin's Air [[Montserrat]] studio in the Caribbean – specifically a no-compromise microphone preamplifier and equaliser.&lt;ref name=Mercenary_audio&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Mercenary Audio |date=September 2006|title=Letter from Focusrite to Mercenary Audio |url=http://www.mercenary.com/whynofocusrite.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resulting module, named the Input Signal Amplifier (ISA) 110, consisted of a transformer-coupled microphone preamplifier, 4-band equaliser and high- and low-pass filters. The initial modules were delivered to Air Montserrat in 1987 and were very well received – as a result, Air London ordered several the following year. The ISA 110 was subsequently sold as an outboard system. The ISA130 was added to the range in 1988, a single-channel Comp/Limiter, De-Esser and Expander/Gate developed by Rupert Neve and Trevor Stride.

Focusrite decided to use these designs as the basis of a complete recording console, and the Focusrite Forte console was developed as a result in 1988. The concept was simply to produce the highest-quality recording console available at the time, regardless of cost. The prohibitively expensive design limited the production to just two units, however, after which Focusrite fell into financial difficulties. One console was delivered to Master Rock studios in London and the other to Electric Lady in New York, remaining in use for many years. The original Focusrite logo with its musically inspired italic ''“ff”'' is actually that of the console, standing for "Focusrite Forte" (as well as the musical term "[[Dynamics (music)|fortissimo]]", or "very loud").

Audio industry veteran and co-founder of [[Soundcraft|Soundcraft Electronics Ltd]], [[Phil Dudderidge]] purchased the company's assets in April 1989, establishing Focusrite Audio Engineering Ltd and reissuing the original modules along with some new designs.&lt;ref name=Plan_2_music&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Plan 2 Music |date=September 2006|title=Focusrite Company History |url=http://www.plan2music.com/bastille/www/pages/Focusrite%20Audio%20Engineering_fichiers/index.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company also designed a new console, the Focusrite Studio Console, released in 1990.

Focusrite saw a growing interest in the microphone preamplifier, EQ and dynamics capability of the console, and decided to spin those out into a new range of outboard modules so that the technology could be made available independently of the console itself. This became the Red Range, with distinctive red milled aluminium front panels, launched in 1993. Over subsequent years Focusrite introduced several ranges of outboard audio processors. The Blue range, aimed at mastering engineers, followed, then in 1996 the Green range, a series of lower-priced processors was launched, aimed at musicians and home and artist-owned recording facilities.

The Platinum range followed in 1998, with characteristic silver-fronted rack cases that combined more effective production design, lowering prices, with more advanced circuitry providing additional features, including not only mic pres and processing, but also a range of effects. The company also co-developed plugins and hardware for the popular [[Pro Tools]] range of digital audio workstation (DAW) systems.

At the same time, new derivatives of the original ISA range were developed, providing new features such as variable mic input impedances. The ISA range is still in production, now with the additional of digital conversion as well as analogue signal processing. The ISA design originally included both input and output transformers, the latter to allow driving long studio lines, but with the advent of on-board analogue to digital (A/D) conversion, this was dropped from the design.

Late 2003 saw the introduction of the Liquid Channel. This unit combines analogue and digital technologies to emulate virtually any combination of classic mic preamp and compressor. At the same time, Focusrite launched another plug-in for Pro Tools, the Forte. This emulated the sound of the two key modules from Focusrite's beginnings, the ISA 110 EQ and ISA130 compressor from the original Forte console.

In August 2004, Focusrite acquired electronic instrument manufacturer [[Novation Digital Music Systems|Novation]] which became a subsidiary called Novation Digital Music Systems Ltd.&lt;ref name=news_Aug2004&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Novation Music |date=1 August 2004 |title=Focusrite acquire Novation |url=http://www.novationmusic.com/news.asp?id=24 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051113100516/http://www.novationmusic.com/news.asp?id=24 |archivedate = 13 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant step for the company was the addition of the Saffire Firewire range of audio interfaces, the first being announced at NAMM in early 2005. This range has continued to expand, offering mic/line/instrument preamps and conversion in a number of configurations, and has more recently been joined by the Scarlett range of USB interfaces. Saffire is also available with real-time DSP-powered tracking and mixing capability designed for the home studio environment, providing compression and EQ for tracking, plus monitor reverb; it also includes VRM: Virtual Reference Monitoring technology. VRM allows a mix to be auditioned in a several different emulated environments – such as living room, bedroom studio and professional studio control room – with a selection of monitoring and other loudspeakers, by listening on headphones. The VRM Box is also available, a USB headphone amplifier with DSP software for monitor emulation.
 
Late 2010 saw Focusrite return to the plug-in arena with the release of the Midnight plug-in suite. This utilizes powerful DSP technology to exactly model the classic Focusrite ISA110 equaliser and ISA130 compressor, even including high-resolution front-panel emulations reminiscent of the hardware units. The ISA110 and 130 modules were created for the Forté console in the 1980s.

On 12 December 2014, Focusrite was floated on the [[Alternative_Investment_Market|AIM market]] as '''Focusrite plc'''.&lt;ref name=flotation&gt;{{cite web |publisher=London Stock Exchange |date=24 November 2014 |title=Focusrite PLC - Intention to Float |url=http://www.londonstockexchange.com/exchange/news/market-news/market-news-detail/12159753.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key product history==
'''ISA 110 Mic Pre &amp; Equalizer''' (1987/89) The original ISA 110 module was designed by Rupert Neve to be vertically mounted and fit into the existing rack format of the Neve console at George Martin’s Air Montserrat studio. It consisted of a transformer-coupled microphone preamplifier based around a transformer supplied by Lundahl of Sweden, 4-band equaliser and high- and low-pass filters and was named the Input Signal Amplifier (ISA) 110. The design was based on the 31106 EQ module designed for the A7971 console by Rupert Neve, incorporating suggestions from Sir George Martin and engineer [[Geoff Emerick]]. The first modules were delivered in 1987. The ISA 110 was subsequently made publicly available as an outboard system consisting of rack, external power supply and ISA module, which sold for approximately $7,000 US.

'''ISA 130 VCA Comp/Limiter, De-Esser &amp; Expander Gate''' (1987/89) The ISA 130 was introduced in 1988 for George Martin’s Air Montserrat console. It was again a vertical unit designed to fit into the original ISA rack or into a console. Developed by Rupert Neve and Trevor Stride, it comprised a single-channel, VCA-based Comp/Limiter, De-Esser and Expander/Gate.

'''Focusrite Forté Console''' (1988) The Focusrite Forté console was developed in 1988 as a result of interest in the ISA modules. The concept was simply to produce the highest-quality recording console available at the time, regardless of cost, based around the signal path of the existing modular units.

'''Focusrite Studio Console''' (1990–6) Following Phil Dudderidge’s acquisition of Focusrite in 1989 and the reissue of the original modules, the company re-examined the concept of a recording console, determined to maintain the original signal path of the Forté but employing a revised mechanical design and construction that made it easier to manufacture and install, reducing the cost. The result was the Focusrite Studio Console, released in 1990. Ten Studio Consoles were built, and several are still in use today.

'''ISA 215 Dual Mic Pre &amp; Equaliser''' (1993) Launched in 1993, the ISA 215 Dual Mono mic pre and equaliser replaced the ISA115, and included two horizontal ISA 110 modules (with transformer-coupled microphone preamplifier, 4-band equaliser and high- and low-pass filters) mounted in a case with an internal power supply.

'''The Red Range''' (1993) The Red Range was based on the successful ISA 110 and ISA 130 products and retained the original Focusrite Ltd circuit designs. With two exceptions, the range consisted of combinations of these basic building blocks. The products featured transformer-balanced I/O, and aluminium cases to limit RFI sensitivity. In addition, the range featured solid, milled, red-anodised aluminium front panels that gave them a very distinctive appearance. Red 3 received a TEC Award in 1995 and Red 7 following it in 1996.

'''The Blue Range''' (1995) In 1995, Focusrite launched a special new range aimed exclusively at mastering facilities, with features such as switched-position, easily  resettable controls that could be annotated easily. The Blue range, as it was called, was developed in conjunction with leading mastering engineers.

'''d2 and d3 Plugins – Equaliser and Comp/Limiter''' (1995) In 1995, Focusrite moved into a new area for the company, in the form of a collaboration with [[Digidesign]] (now Avid Audio) on the development of two software plugins for the market-leading Pro Tools digital audio workstation environment. These were the first software plugins to not only emulate the processing capabilities of a piece of hardware, but also their look and feel: Focusrite d2 is a high-quality digital equaliser based on the Focusrite Red 2 Equaliser, whose design can be traced back to Rupert Neve; while d3 emulates the Red 3 Compressor/limiter. Both are still available at the time of writing (April 2013). These plugins included modelling of a suitably red front-panel with controls like those on the physical products, plus a large graph display showing how the plugin was configured – not something that would have been possible to do on the hardware.

'''The Green Range''' (1996) Introduced in 1996, the idea behind the range was to make high quality audio processors available to the project studio owner, with lower price-points than previous Focusrite products. It also employed distinctive sculpted green front panels. Cost reductions were achieved primarily by re-evaluating construction techniques, using a single circuit board and surface-mount components, the latter allowing automated production. Some less-used features were omitted; expensive display components such as analogue meters were replaced by LEDs, while in the mic pre area, Focusrite moved away from the transformer-based approach for these units to offer a transformerless, electronically balanced design.

'''The Platinum Range''' (1998) The Platinum range, with its silver-fronted rack cases, managed to reduce price points still further as a result of extensive production engineering, and while it retained the Focusrite transparency and purity, it also provided functionality to allow a range of effects too – adding a radical new dimension to Focusrite products. Designer Rob Jenkins stated that while previous Focusrite products had been aimed at studio engineers, the Platinum range targeted the recording musician, describing them as "results-orientated", with controls named after their effects rather than their engineering function.

'''ISA 430''' (1999) The ISA 430 brought together the circuitry of the original ISA110, with its transformer-based mic and line inputs, HPF/LPF and parametric EQ section, with the ISA 130 compressor/limiter and expander/gate, designed by Trevor Stride and Rupert Neve, which later appeared in the Red 3. In addition to uniting these two units in the same 2U enclosure, ISA 430 introduced additional features such as an optional 24/96 A/D converter with synch to Pro Tools’ Superclock and other sources. A dedicated insert could be placed in three locations in the signal path (after the preamp, pre-EQ; between EQ and dynamics; and after EQ and dynamics but before the main output). EQ and dynamics sections could be swapped, and the unit could run as a single channel path nor be split into two independent processors with separate EQ and dynamics. An upgraded Class A VCA design was used in the compressor, though the sidechain was identical to that in the original ISA 130. Both a VU Meter and LED bar metering was included, the latter for use with the A/D. An improved de-esser design was included and a "frequency adaptive" optical limiter.

'''Control|24''' (2000) The year 2000 saw the launch of a second joint project with Digidesign: the Control|24 hardware control surface for Pro Tools. This ergonomically designed control surface aimed to include the vast majority of functionality of Digidesign's flagship ProControl, but at a significantly lower price. It also included 16 Focusrite mic pres, allowing it to be used for tracking with no additional hardware, a built-in stereo submixer and flexible surround-capable monitoring.

'''Platinum Penta''' (2001) March 2001 saw the release of the Platinum Penta. Designed specifically to complement a digital audio workstation, the Penta provided front-panel mic and instrument inputs, a Class A mic pre, and a stereo compressor featuring 16 presets accessed by buttons for different common applications, both for individual instruments and the entire mix. It also included a "Tube Sound" emulator and spatial enhancer. At the end of that year, another product in the high-end ISA range was introduced, the ISA220 "Session Pack". This 2U unit included many of the features of the ISA430, including mic pre, mic/line/instrument inputs, parametric EQ, dynamics and optical de-esser, plus an optional A/D. It also included a "Blend" control, which allowed the compressor's input signal to be mixed with the compressor output.

'''Mbox''' (2001) Launched in 2001 was another collaboration between Focusrite and Digidesign, in the form of the Mbox. Digidesign had approached Focusrite to develop a low-cost USB-based audio interface designed to complement the Pro Tools LE entry-level DAW. The dual-channel, USB-powered Mbox featured Focusrite mic pres with phantom capability, line/instrument ins and outs and headphone out, and 24-bit conversion. It featured zero-latency monitoring via a control to listen to a mix of input and playback.

'''Liquid Channel''' (2003) Unveiled at the 115th Audio Engineering Society Convention in November 2003 was the Liquid Channel. This unit combines analogue and digital technologies to emulate virtually any combination of classic mic preamp and compressor. At the front end is an extensive analogue microphone preamplifier, which allows the relationship between mic and preamp to be precisely defined: the first step in emulation. Then a DSP-based sampling/emulation system, licensed from Sintefex Audio, comes into play, which uses ‘Dynamic Convolution’ techniques based on actual measurements of classic compressors, to re-synthesise their behaviour. In addition there is a control to vary the amount of second harmonic distortion. The front panel is entirely digital, and as a result all the unit’s settings can be saved in the unit’s 99 memories. Additional emulations can be added to the 40 on-board sets, and existing sets archived, via USB. The output side includes a 192&amp;nbsp;kHz A/D.

'''Saffire Firewire Audio Interface''' (2005) The Saffire Firewire range of audio interfaces marked a major step forward for Focusrite, the first being announced at NAMM in early 2005. The original Saffire, designed as a compact, portable desktop unit with vertical form factor, included a Firewire 400 interface with on-board digital signal processing, and was based around a 24-bit, 192&amp;nbsp;kHz A/D-D/A. Four inputs were provided, two Focusrite mic preamps and S/PDIF I/O. Eight balanced outputs enabled the creation of separate headphone and monitor mixes or surround-sound monitoring. MIDI I/O was also included. Along with the hardware came SaffireControl, a suite of plug-ins delivering compression, EQ, amplifier modelling, and reverb for the monitor path, along with multiple stereo mix capability, also available on playback in VST or AU format for use with the host DAW system.

'''Saffire PRO 24 DSP Audio Interface''' (2009) In July 2009, a new member of the Saffire range of interfaces was released, with the addition of a completely new feature. The Focusrite Saffire PRO 24 DSP is a 16 in / 8 out FireWire audio interface, featuring real-time DSP-powered tracking and mixing capability designed for the home studio environment. The unit provides DSP-powered compression and EQ for ultra-low-latency tracking, plus monitor reverb; it also includes VRM: Virtual Reference Monitoring technology. This uses dynamic convolution technology, as included in the Liquid series of products, but this time it is used to emulate monitoring systems. As a result, VRM allows a mix to be auditioned in a several different environments – such as living room, bedroom studio and professional studio control room – with a wide selection of monitoring and other loudspeakers, all by listening on headphones.

'''Saffire 6 USB Audio Interface''' (2009) September 2009 saw the Saffire range extend from Firewire to USB, with the introduction of the Focusrite Saffire 6 USB, a two-in/four-out USB audio interface. It includes dual award-winning Focusrite mic preamps as in the rest of the Saffire range. The two-in, four-out configuration is also perfect for laptop DJs who need to be able to cue up material, or send two different signals to either side of a DJ mixer. It also includes MIDI I/O. Saffire 6 USB is supplied with a range of software, including Ableton Live Lite 8, Focusrite sister company Novation's Bass Station synthesizer and over a gigabyte of samples. In addition the package includes the Focusrite FX Suite, which includes a compressor, gate, reverb and EQ for AU/VST operation.

'''ISA One Single-channel microphone preamplifier with independent DI''' (2010) The ISA One included the traditional Focusrite ISA transformer-based preamp from the ISA 110, now with four switchable impedances, in a rugged and portable chassis. The preamp is complemented by a line input and an independent D.I. channel, complete with dedicated gain control, active or passive impedance switch, a TRS Jack output for routing to an amp and an independent XLR output on the rear. Its ideal for both vocal and instrument recording. An optional 24/192 A/D converter card can be added. The unit is also available with the card pre-installed, as the ISA One Digital.

'''Forte''' is a 2 in, 4 out portable USB audio interface for Mac and Windows, designed to deliver analogue sources to DAWs. It features two remote-controlled mic preamps with digital conversion at up to 24-bit/192&amp;nbsp;kHz resolution. Built into a solid aluminium case, Forte features a colour OLED display, touch controls and a single large control knob, with DAW control integration.

'''VRM Box''' is a small square box containing a USB-based bus-powered headphone monitoring amplifier allowing mixes to be monitored at high quality. In addition, software is provided that runs on the host computer to provide the ability to emulate a wide range of monitor loudspeakers in various room environments from studio monitoring to consumer listening. VRM is the same technology as available in the Saffire PRO 24 interface.

'''RedNet''' is Focusrite’s flagship range of modular [[Audio over Ethernet|Ethernet-networked]] audio interfaces that harnesses the power of Audinate's tried and tested [[Dante (networking)|Dante]] digital audio networking system to bring studio quality sound to any modern audio application. Fundamentally RedNet is an extremely scalable, near zero latency audio distribution system that can be used to expand I/O channel count, interface digital components, and/or bridge between Pro Tools|HD or MADI and the Dante audio network. The technology enables a single link on the network to handle up to 512 input and output channels at 48&amp;nbsp;kHz.

'''iTrack Solo''' is an interface for recording instruments and vocals using an [[Apple Inc|Apple]] [[iPad]]. Featuring a Focusrite microphone pre-amplifier and an input to record directly from electric and bass guitars, iTrack Solo is compatible with iOS-based music-making app. It is also fully compatible with PC or [[Macintosh]] computers and is supplied with music making software including [[Ableton Live]] Lite and the Focusrite Scarlett Plug-in Suite.

'''Free verse''' is an open form of [[poetry]]. It does not use consistent [[Meter (poetry)|meter]] patterns, [[rhyme]], or any musical pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Abbs | first1 = Peter | last2 = Richardson | first2 = John | title = The Forms of Poetry: A practical study guide for English | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | edition = 15th | page = 137 | url = https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Forms_of_Poetry.html?id=y0p4QgAACAAJ | isbn = 978-0-521-37160-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preface==
Poets have explained that free verse is not totally free: "Its only freedom is from the tyrant demands of the metered line."&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Charles, "Cadenced Free Verse", ''College English'', vol 9, number 6, January 1948 &lt;/ref&gt; Free verse displays some elements of form. Most free verse maintains the poetic convention of the [[Line (poetry)|poetic line]] to some degree, at least in written representations, {{clarify|text=though retaining a potential degree of linkage.|date=November 2018}} [[Donald Hall]] goes as far as to say that "the ''form'' of free verse is as binding and as liberating as the ''form'' of a [[rondeau (poetry)|rondeau]],"&lt;ref&gt;Donald Hall, in the essay 'Goatfoot, Milktongue, Twinbird' in the book of 0-472-40000-2.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[T. S. Eliot]] wrote, "No verse is free for the man who wants to do a good job."&lt;ref&gt;Eliot quote from the essay, "The Music of Poetry" Jackson (1 January 1942) ASIN B0032Q49RO&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Kenneth Allott]], the poet and critic, said the adoption by some poets of ''[[vers libre]]'' arose from "mere desire for novelty, the imitation of [[Walt Whitman|Whitman]], the study of [[English literature|Jacobean]] dramatic [[blank verse]], and the awareness of what French poets had already done to the [[French alexandrine|alexandrine]] in France."&lt;ref&gt;Introductory Note by Kenneth Allott (ed.) ''The Penguin Book of Contemporary Verse'', [[Penguin Books]], Harmondsworth, England 1950&lt;/ref&gt; The American critic [[John Livingston Lowes]] in 1916 observed "Free verse may be written as very beautiful [[prose]]; prose may be written as very beautiful free verse. Which is which?"&lt;ref&gt;Lowes, Livingston John, ''Nation'' Feb 1916&lt;/ref&gt;

Some poets have considered free verse restrictive in its own way. In 1922, [[Robert Bridges]] voiced his reservations in the essay "[[Humdrum and Harum-Scarum]]." {{Clarify|text=[[Robert Frost]] later remarked that writing free verse was like "playing tennis without a net." |reason=How is Frost's comment a concurrence with 'restrictive'? Seems like a criticism of having no rules.|date=November 2018}} [[William Carlos Williams]] said, "Being an art form, verse cannot be free in the sense of having no limitations or guiding principles."&lt;ref&gt;Free Verse, ''Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics'', 2nd Ed, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yvor Winters]], the poet and critic, said, "The free verse that is really verse, the best that is, of [[William Carlos Williams|W.C. Williams]], [[H. D.]], [[Marianne Moore]], [[Wallace Stevens]], and [[Ezra Pound]] is the [[antithesis]] of free."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1937"&gt;Primitivism and Decadence: A Study of American Experimental Poetry Arrow Editions, New York, 1937&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antecedents==
As the [[French-language]] term ''vers libre'' suggests, this technique of using more irregular cadences is often said to have its origin in the practices of 19th-century French poets such as [[Gustave Kahn]] and [[Jules Laforgue]] in his ''Derniers vers'' of 1890. Taupin, the US-based French poet and critic, concluded that free verse and ''vers libre'' are not synonymous, since "the French language tends to give equal [[Syllable weight|weight]] to each spoken syllable, whereas English syllables vary in quantity according to whether [[Stress (linguistics)|stressed or unstressed]]."&lt;ref&gt;Taupin, Rene. ''The Influence of French Symbolism on Modern American Poetry'' (1986), (translated by William Pratt), Ams Studies in Modern Literature, {{ISBN|0-404-61579-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sort of cadencing that we now recognize in free verse can be traced back at least as far as the [[Biblical Hebrew]] [[psalmist]] poetry of the [[Bible]].&lt;ref&gt; Allen, Charles 'Cadenced Free Verse' , College English , vol 9, no 6 January 1948 &lt;/ref&gt; By referring to the [[s:Psalms|Psalms]], it is possible to argue that free verse in English first appeared in the 1380s in the [[John Wycliffe]] translation of the [[Psalms]] and was repeated in different form in most [[biblical translation|biblical translations]] ever since. 

[[Walt Whitman]], who based his long lines in his poetry collection ''[[Leaves of Grass]]'' on the phrasing of the [[King James Bible]], influenced later American free verse composers, notably [[Allen Ginsberg]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} One form of free verse was employed by [[Christopher Smart]] in his long poem ''[[Jubilate Agno]]'' ([[Latin]]: ''Rejoice in the Lamb'') , written some time between 1759 and 1763 but not published until 1939.

Many poets of the [[Victorian era]] experimented with free verse. [[Christina Rossetti]], [[Coventry Patmore]], and [[T. E. Brown]] all wrote examples of rhymed but unmetered verse, poems such as [[W. E. Henley]]'s "Discharged" (from his ''In Hospital'' sequence). 

Free verse in English was persuasively advocated by critic [[T. E. Hulme]] in his ''[[A Lecture on Modern Poetry]]'' (1908). Later in the preface to ''Some Imagist Poets'' 1916, he comments, "Only the name is new, you will find something much like ''vers libre'' in [[John Dryden|Dryden]]'s ''Threnodia Augustalis''; a great deal of [[John Milton|Milton]]'s ''[[Samson Agonistes]]'', and the oldest in [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer's]] ''[[The House of Fame|House of Fame]]''."&lt;ref&gt;Preface to ''Some Imagist Poets'', Constable, 1916&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, a few pieces in [[Arthur Rimbaud]]'s [[prose poem]] collection ''[[Illuminations (poems)|Illuminations]]'' were arranged in manuscript in lines, rather than prose, and in the Netherlands, [[tachtiger]] (i.e., a member of the 1880s generation of innovative poets) [[Frederik van Eeden]] employed the form at least once' in his poem "Waterlelie" ("Water Lily").&lt;ref&gt;[http://4umi.com/vaneeden/waterlelie.htm De waterlelie]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Goethe]]—particularly in some early poems, such as "[[Prometheus (Goethe)|Prometheus]]"—and [[Hölderlin]] used free verse occasionally, due in part to a misinterpretation of the meter used in [[Pindar]]'s poetry; in Hölderlin's case, he also continued to write unmetered poems after discovering this error.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ELuZzgnE81MC&amp;pg=PR15 Michael Hamburger: ''Foreword''] in Robert Marcellus Browning (ed.): ''German poetry from 1750 to 1900'' (''The German Library'', vol. 39), New York: The Continuum Publishing Company, 1984, p. XV, {{ISBN|0-8264-0282-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The German poet [[Heinrich Heine]] made an important contribution to the development of free verse with 22 poems, written in two-poem cycles, called ''Die Nordsee'' (''The North Sea'') (written 1825-1826).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wcnooASgpFIC&amp;pg=PR17&amp;lpg=PR17&amp;dq=%22free+verse%22+heine+north+sea&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EsVSRB10w-&amp;sig=mbKzidTInCJXeSbDp4_2lx_WJaA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=CUYDS7HcI-LOjAf8guGuAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CAoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22free%20verse%22%20heine%20north%20sea&amp;f=false |title=Songs of Love and Grief: A Bilingual Anthology in the Verse Forms of the ... - Heinrich Heine - Google Books |work=Books.google.co.uk |date=22 November 1995 |accessdate=2013-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were first published in ''Buch der Lieder'' (''Book of Songs'') in 1827.

==Form and structure==
Although free verse requires no meter, rhyme, or other traditional poetic techniques, a poet can still use them to create some sense of structure. A clear example of this can be found in [[Walt Whitman]]'s poems, where he repeats certain phrases and uses commas to create both a rhythm and structure. 

Pattern and discipline is to be found in good free verse: the internal pattern of sounds, the choice of exact words, and the effect of associations give free verse its beauty.&lt;ref&gt;Boulton, Marjories, ''Anatomy of Poetry'', Routledge&amp;Kegan, London 1953&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[Imagists]] free verse became a discipline and acquired status as a legitimate poetic form.&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, William. The Imagist Poem, Modern Poetry in Miniature (Story Line Press, 1963, expanded 2001). {{ISBN|1-58654-009-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herbert Read]], however, noted that "the Imagist [[Ezra Pound]] gave free verse its musical structure to an extent that parodoxically it was no longer free."&lt;ref&gt;Read, Herbert Ezra Pound, ''The Tenth Muse''. Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, London 1957&lt;/ref&gt;

Unrestrained by traditional boundaries, [[Yvor Winters]] described this as "attempts to widen experience by establishing 'abnormal' conventions,"&lt;ref name="autogenerated1937"/&gt; the poet possesses more license to express, and has more control over the development of the poem. This can allow for a more spontaneous and individualized poetic art product.

Technically, free verse has been described as spaced prose, a mosaic of verse and prose experience.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, William Morrison, ''Rhythm of Prose'' (Preface 2nd edition) [[Columbia University Press]], 1917. [https://archive.org/stream/rhythmofproseexp00pattiala/rhythmofproseexp00pattiala_djvu.txt]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5693">'''Great Celebrations square''' is the main square for public celebrations in [[Baghdad]] with a [[stadium]] for the heads of the state in the center of the Parade avenue. The square is home to three important public monuments created by leading mid-20th century sculptors. 

==Description==
In 1986 (two years before the war's end) the Iraqi Ba'athist government began construction of a festival and parade ground in Zawra Park, near the extensive presidential complex in the center of Baghdad. 
The square is located near the Harthiya and in the fortified [[Green Zone]], and the site was specifically selected for its symbolic value. Iraqis generally believe it is the same location where the Muslim Arabs defeated the [[Persia]]ns in 636 CE and this historic event is seen to be the beginning of Islamic domination of the region.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Khalilm S. and Makiya, K., ''The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq,'' pp 10-12&lt;/ref&gt; The site was intended to become the place where military parades and national events would be held. Known as ''Grand Festivities Square'', it comprised a large parade ground, an extensive review pavilion and a large reflecting pool. The surrounding grassy areas hosted Iraqis during military parades. Adding to the festive appeal of the grounds were three refreshments booths that sold ice cream, cold beverages, and candy.

The then leader of Iraq, Saddam Hussein commissioned three major public artworks for the area. These artworks were to be memorials to Iraq's fallen soldiers, a remembrance of Iraq's pain and suffering as a consequence of the Iran-Iraq war and symbols of Iraq's victory in the war. The ''Monument to the Unknown Soldier,'' based on a concept by Iraqi sculptor, [[Khaled al-Rahal]], and situated just beyond the perimeter of the Square, had already opened in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, J. and Blair, S.S., ''Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art &amp; Architecture,'' Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; Another major work, the colossal, ''[[Al-Shaheed Monument]]'' designed by Iraqi sculptor, [[Ismail Fatah Al Turk]], and situated on the river bank had been inaugurated in 1983. Hussein commissioned a third monument, the ''[[Victory Arch]]es,'' another concept by the sculptor, Khaled Al-Rahal, to be built in the same vicinity and it was inaugurated in 1989. 

The Victory Arches mark the entrances to the Square. On the day the Arches were dedicated (8 August, 1989), Saddam rode under the arches astride a white horse. &lt;ref&gt;Marozzi, J., ''Baghdad: City of Peace, City of Blood,'' Penguin UK, 2014, [E-book edition], n.p. &lt;/ref&gt; It is generally acknowledged that Hussein intended to cast an allusion to the slain Shiite martyr [[Husayn ibn Ali|Hussein]], killed in [[Karbala]] in 680 [[Anno Domini|CE]], whose death caused the rift between Shiite and Sunni Muslims. The monument, although presenting a triumphalist narrative in relation to the Iran-Iraq war, has assumed a broader symbolism and represents those Iraqis who fell in any war throughout the country's history.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Khalilm S. and Makiya, K., ''The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq,'' pp 10-12&lt;/ref&gt;

The three monuments  in the vicinity of the square form a visual and symbolic unit.&lt;ref&gt;Makiya, K. and Al-Khalilm S., ''The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Saddam Hussein's Iraq,'' p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of the three artworks was part of a broader Ba'athist government program to beautify Baghdad, instil a sense of national pride, and at the same time immortalise Sadam Hussein's reputation as a powerful leader. &lt;ref&gt;Brown, B.A. and Feldman, M.H. (eds), ''Critical Approaches to Ancient Near Eastern Art,''Walter de Gruyter, 2014 p.xix&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent Developments==

The Square has become a place for public demonstrations and protests. In April-May, 2016, following a protracted political struggle between to end sectarianism in politics, a large crowd gathered at Grand Festivities Square in a non-violent protest. &lt;ref&gt;"Protesters leave Baghdad’s Green Zone as Iraq’s leaders promise reforms," ''The National,'' 1 May, 2016, [https://www.thenational.ae/world/protesters-leave-baghdad-s-green-zone-as-iraq-s-leaders-promise-reforms-1.170635 Online:]; Sridharan,V., "Iraqi Shia protesters leave Baghdad Green Zone but pledge to return," ''International Business Times,'' 2 May, 2016, [http://www.iraqicivilsociety.org/archives/5382 Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gawain and the Green Knight.jpg|thumb|A painting from the original manuscript of ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]''. The Green Knight is seated on the horse, holding up his severed head in his right hand.]]

The '''Green Knight''' is a character of the 14th-century [[Arthurian legend|Arthurian]] poem ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]'' and the related medieval work ''[[The Greene Knight]]''. His true name is revealed to be '''Bertilak de Hautdesert''' (an alternate spelling in some translations is "Bercilak" or "Bernlak") in ''Sir Gawain'', while ''The Greene Knight'' names him "'''Bredbeddle'''".&lt;ref&gt;Hahn, Thomas. "The Greene Knight". In ''Sir Gawain: Eleven Romances and Tales'', p. 314. Western Michigan University Medieval Institute Publications. (2000) {{ISBN|1-879288-59-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Green Knight later features as one of Arthur's greatest champions in the fragmentary [[ballad]] "[[King Arthur and King Cornwall]]", again with the name "Bredbeddle".&lt;ref&gt;Hahn, Thomas. "King Arthur and King Cornwall". In ''Sir Gawain: Eleven Romances and Tales'', p. 427. Western Michigan University Medieval Institute Publications. (2000) {{ISBN|1-879288-59-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'', [[Bercilak]] is transformed into the Green Knight by [[Morgan le Fay]], a traditional adversary of [[King Arthur]], in order to test his court. In ''The Green Knight'' he is transformed by a different woman for the same purpose. In both stories he sends his wife to seduce [[Gawain]] as a further test. "King Arthur and King Cornwall" portrays him as an exorcist and one of the most powerful knights of Arthur's court.

In ''Sir Gawain'', the Green Knight is so called because his skin and clothes are green. The meaning of his greenness has puzzled scholars since the discovery of the poem, who identify him variously as the [[Green Man]], a vegetation being of [[medieval art]]; a recollection of a figure from [[Celtic mythology]]; a [[Christian]] symbol; or the [[Devil]] himself. The medieval scholar [[C. S. Lewis]] said the character was "as vivid and concrete as any image in literature."&lt;ref name = knight&gt;Besserman, Lawrence. "The Idea of the Green Knight." ''ELH'', Vol. 53, No. 2. (Summer, 1986), pp. 219-239. The Johns Hopkins University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] called him the "most difficult character" to interpret in the introduction to his edition of ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight''. His major role in Arthurian literature includes being a judge and tester of knights, and as such the other characters consider him as friendly but terrifying and somewhat mysterious.&lt;ref name = knight/&gt;

==Historical context==
The earliest appearance of the Green Knight is in the late 14th century [[alliterative verse|alliterative poem]] ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]'', which survives in only one manuscript along with other poems by the same author, the so-called [[Pearl Poet]].&lt;ref&gt;Scattergood, Vincent J. "Sir Gawain and the Green Knight". In Lacy, Norris J. (Ed.), ''The New Arthurian Encyclopedia'', p. 419–421. New York: Garland. (1991). {{ISBN|0-8240-4377-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This poet was a contemporary of [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], writer of ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'', although the two wrote in different parts of England. The later poem, ''[[The Greene Knight]]'', is a late medieval rhyming romance that likely predates its only surviving copy: the 17th-century [[Percy Folio]].&lt;ref&gt;Hahn, Thomas. "The Orange Knight". In ''Sir Gawain: Eleven Romances and Tales'', pp. 309–312. Western Michigan University Medieval Institute Publications. (2000). {{ISBN|1-879288-59-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The other work featuring the Green Knight, the later ballad "[[King Arthur and King Cornwall]]", also survives only in the Percy Folio manuscript. Its date of composition is conjectural; it may be a version of an earlier story, though it is also possibly a product of the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Hahn, Thomas. "King Arthur and King Cornwall". In ''Sir Gawain: Eleven Romances and Tales'', pp. 419–421. Western Michigan University Medieval Institute Publications. (2000). {{ISBN|1-879288-59-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in Arthurian literature==
In ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]'', the Green Knight appears before Arthur's court during a [[Christmas]] feast, holding a bough of holly in one hand and a battle axe in the other. Despite disclaim of war, the knight issues a challenge: he will allow one man to strike him once with his axe, with the condition that he return the blow the next year. At first, Arthur accepts the challenge, but Gawain takes his place and decapitates the Green Knight, who retrieves his head, reattaches it and tells Gawain to meet him at the Green Chapel at the stipulated time.&lt;ref name="Wilhelm, James J. 1994"&gt;Wilhelm, James J. “Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.” The Romance of Arthur. Ed. Wilhelm, James J. New York: Garland Publishing, 1994. 399 - 465.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Knight features next as Bercilak de Hautedesert, lord of a large castle, Gawain's host before his arrival at the Green Chapel. At Bercilak's castle, Gawain is submitted to tests of his [[loyalty]] and [[chastity]], wherein Bercilak sends his wife to seduce Gawain and arranges that each time Bercilak gains prey in hunting, or Gawain any gift in the castle, each shall exchange his gain for the other's. At New Year's Day, Gawain departs to the Green Chapel,&lt;ref name="Wilhelm, James J. 1994"/&gt; and bends to receive his blow, only to have the Green Knight feint two blows, then barely nick him on the third. He then reveals that he is Bercilak, and that [[Morgan le Fay]] had given him the double identity to test Gawain and Arthur.

''[[The Greene Knight]]'' tells the same story as ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'', with a few differences. Notably, the knight, here named "Bredbeddle", is only wearing green, not green-skinned himself. The poem also states the knight has been asked by his wife's mother (not Morgan in this version) to trick Gawain. He agrees because he knows his wife is secretly in love with Gawain, and hopes to deceive both. Gawain falters in accepting a [[girdle]] from her, and the Green Knight's purpose is fulfilled in a small sense. In the end, he acknowledges Gawain's ability and asks to accompany him to Arthur's court.

In ''[[King Arthur and King Cornwall]]'', the Green Knight again features as Bredbeddle, and is depicted as one of Arthur's knights. He offers to help Arthur fight a mysterious [[Sprite (creature)|sprite]] (controlled by the magician, King Cornwall) which has entered his chamber. When physical attacks fail, Bredbeddle uses a sacred text to subdue it. The Green Knight eventually gains so much control over the sprite through this text that he convinces it to take a sword and strike off its master's head.

==Etymologies==
The name "Bertilak" may derive from ''bachlach'', a [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] word meaning "churl" (i.e. rogueish, unmannerly), or from "bresalak", meaning "contentious". The [[Old French]] word ''bertolais'' translates as "Bertilak" in the Arthurian tale ''[[Merlin]]'' from the [[Lancelot-Grail Cycle]] of Arthurian legend. Notably, the 'Bert-' prefix means 'bright', and the '-lak' can mean either 'lake' or "play, sport, fun, etc". "Hautdesert" probably comes from a mix of both Old French and Celtic words meaning "High Wasteland" or "High Hermitage". It may also have an association with ''desirete'' meaning "disinherited" (i.e. from the Round Table).&lt;ref name = knight/&gt;

===Green Knights in other stories===

Characters similar to the Green Knight appear in several other works. In [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'', for example, Gawain's brother [[Gareth]] defeats four brothers in different coloured armour, including a "Grene Knyght", Sir Partolope.&lt;ref&gt;Malory, Thomas; Vinaver, Eugène. ''Malory: Complete Works''. p. 185. Oxford University Press. (1971). {{ISBN|978-0-19-281217-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The three who survive the encounter eventually join the Round Table and appear several further times in the text. The stories of [[Saladin]] feature a certain "Green Knight"; a [[Sicily|Sicilian]] warrior in a shield [[Vert (heraldry)|vert]] and a helmet adorned with stag horns. Saladin tries to make him part of his personal guard.&lt;ref&gt;Richard, Jean. "An Account of the Battle of Hattin Referring to the Frankish Mercenaries in Oriental Moslem States" ''Speculum'' 27.2 (1952) pp. 168-177.&lt;/ref&gt;
Similarly, a "Chevalier Vert" appears in the Chronicle of [[Ernoul]] during the recollection of events following the [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|capture of Jerusalem in 1187]]; here, he is identified as a Spanish knight who earned this nickname from the Muslims due to his eccentric apparel.&lt;ref&gt;See the "Chronique d’Ernoul et de Bernard le Trésorier", edited by L. de Mas Latrie, Paris 1871, p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking this into consideration, scientists have considered an association with Islamic tales. The figure of [[Al-Khidr]] ({{lang-ar|الخضر}}) in the [[Qur'an]] is called the "Green Man" because he obtain immortality as the only man to have drunk the water of life which in some versions of the story turns him green&lt;ref&gt;Ng, Su Fang, and Kenneth Hodges.

He tests [[Moses]] three times by doing seemingly evil acts, which are eventually revealed to be noble deeds to prevent greater evils or reveal great goods. Both the Arthurian Green Knight and Al-Khidr serve as teachers to holy and upright men (Gawain/Moses), who thrice tested their faith and obedience. It has been suggested that the character of the Green Knight may be a literary descendant of Al-Khidr, brought to Europe with the [[Crusades|Crusaders]] and blended with Celtic and Arthurian imagery.&lt;ref&gt;Lasater, Alice E.

===Characters fulfilling similar roles===
The beheading game appears in a number of tales, the earliest being the [[Middle Irish]] tale ''[[Bricriu's Feast]]''. The challenger in this story is named "Fear", a ''bachlach'' (churl), and is identified as [[Cú Roí]] (a superhuman king of Munster in the Ulster Cycle of Irish mythology) in disguise. He challenges three warriors to his game, only to have them run from the return blow, until the hero [[Cú Chulainn]] accepts the challenge. With Cú Chulainn under his axe, this antagonist also feints three blows before letting the hero go. In the Irish version, the cloak of the churl is described as grey (glas), which may also mean green.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buchanan|first1=Alice|title=The Irish Framework of ''Gawain and the Green Knight''|journal=PMLA|volume=47|issue=2|pages=315|doi=10.2307/457878|jstor=457878|year=1932}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Caradoc|Life of Caradoc]]'', a [[Middle French]] narrative embedded in the anonymous [[Perceval, the Story of the Grail#First Continuation|First Continuation]] of [[Chrétien de Troyes]]' ''[[Perceval, the Story of the Grail]]'', another similar challenge is issued. In this story, a notable difference is that Caradoc's challenger is his father in disguise, come to test his honour. The [[French literature|French romances]] ''La Mule sans Frein'' and ''Hunbaut'' and the [[Middle High German]] [[epic poem]] ''[[Diu Crone]]'' feature Gawain in beheading game situations. ''Hunbaut'' furnishes an interesting twist: Gawain cuts off the man's head, and then pulls off his magic [[cloak]] before he can replace it, causing his death.&lt;ref name = Brewer&gt;Brewer, Elisabeth. ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight: sources and analogues''. 2nd Ed. Boydell Press. (November 1992) {{ISBN|0-85991-359-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar story, this time attributed to [[Lancelot]], appears in the 13th century French work ''[[Perlesvaus]]''.

The 15th-century ''The Turke and Gowin'' begins with a [[Turkish people|Turk]] entering Arthur's court and asking, "Is there any will, as a brother, To give a buffett and take another?"&lt;ref name = turke&gt;Hahn, Thomas. "The Turke and Sir Gawain". In ''Sir Gawain: Eleven Romances and Tales''. Western Michigan University Medieval Institute Publications. (2000) {{ISBN|1-879288-59-1}}. Online: [http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/teams/turkfrm.htm ''The Turke and Sir Gawain''].&lt;/ref&gt; Gawain accepts the challenge, and is then forced to follow the Turk until he decides to return the blow. Through the many adventures they have together, the Turk, out of respect, asks the knight to cut off the Turk's head, which Gawain does. The Turk, surviving, then praises Gawain and showers him with gifts. ''[[Sir Gawain and the Carle of Carlisle]]'' contains a scene in which the Carl, a lord, orders Gawain to strike him with his spear, and bends over to receive the blow.&lt;ref&gt;Hahn, Thomas. "Sir Gawain and the Carle of Carlisle". In ''Sir Gawain: Eleven Romances and Tales''. Western Michigan University Medieval Institute Publications. (2000). {{ISBN|1-879288-59-1}}. Online: [http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/teams/gawcint.htm ''Sir Gawain and the Carle of Carlisle''].&lt;/ref&gt; Gawain obliges, the Carl rises, laughing and unharmed, and, unlike in ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'', no return blow is demanded or given.&lt;ref name = Brewer/&gt; Among all these stories, ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'' is the only one with a completely green character, and the only one tying [[Morgan le Fay]] to his transformation.&lt;ref name = Brewer/&gt;&lt;ref name = turke/&gt;

Several stories also feature knights struggling to stave off the advances of voluptuous women, including ''Yder'', the [[Lancelot-Grail]] Cycle, ''Hunbaut'', and ''The Knight of the Sword''. The Green Knight parallel in these stories is a King testing a knight as to whether or not he will remain chaste in extreme circumstances. The woman he sends is sometimes his wife (as in ''Yder''), if he knows that she is unfaithful and will tempt other men; in ''The Knight of the Sword'' the king sends his beautiful daughter. All characters playing the Green Knight's role kill unfaithful knights who fail their tests.&lt;ref name = Brewer/&gt;

==Significance of the colour green==
[[File:Michael Pacher 004.jpg|thumb|[[Michael Pacher]]'s painting of a green devil from about the same period as the ''Gawain'' poem. Poetic contemporaries such as Chaucer also made associations between the colour green and the devil, causing scholars to make similar associations in readings of the Green Knight.&lt;ref name = devil&gt;Robertson, D. W. Jr. "Why the Devil Wears Green." ''Modern Language Notes'' (November 1954) 69.7 pgs. 470-472&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In English folklore and literature, green has traditionally been used to symbolize [[nature]] and its embodied attributes, namely those of [[fertility]] and [[reincarnation|rebirth]]. Critics have claimed that the Green Knight's role emphasizes the environment outside of human habitation&lt;ref&gt;George, Michael W. "Gawain's Struggle with Ecology: Attitudes toward the Natural World in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight" 'The Journal of Ecocriticism, vol. 2, no. 2, 2010. pg. 37&lt;/ref&gt;. With his alternate identity as Bertilak, the Green Knight can also be seen as a compromise between both humanity and the environment as opposed to Gawain's representation of human civilization&lt;ref&gt;George, "Natural World," pg. 39&lt;/ref&gt;. Oftentimes it is used to embody the supernatural or spiritual other world. In British folklore, the devil was sometimes considered to be green which may or may not play into the concept of the Green Man/ Wild Man dichotomy of the Green Knight.&lt;ref&gt;Krappe, A.H. “Who Was the Green Knight?” Speculum 13.2 (1938): 206-215.&lt;/ref&gt; Stories of the medieval period also portray the colour as representing [[love]] and the amorous in life,&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlin, Vernon A. "Symbolic Green: A Time-Honored Characterizing Device in Spanish Literature." ''Hispania'' Vol. 51, No. 1 (Mar., 1968), pp. 29-37&lt;/ref&gt; and the base, natural desires of man.&lt;ref name = gold&gt;Goldhurst, William. "The Green and the Gold: The Major Theme of Gawain and the Green Knight." ''[[College English]]'', Vol. 20, No. 2 (Nov., 1958), pp. 61-65&lt;/ref&gt; Green is also known to have signified [[witchcraft]], devilry and evil for its association with the [[fairy|fairies]] and spirits of early [[English folklore]] and for its association with decay and toxicity.&lt;ref name=evil&gt;Williams, Margaret. The Pearl Poet, His Complete Works. Random House, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; The colour, when combined with [[gold]], is sometimes seen as representing the fading of youth.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, John S. "Gawain and the Green Knight." ''College English''. Vol. 21, No. 1 (Oct., 1959), pp. 50-51&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Celtic mythology|Celtic tradition]], green was avoided in clothing for its superstitious association with misfortune and death. Green can be considered in ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'' as signifying a transformation from good to evil and back again; displaying both the spoiling and regenerative connotations of the colour.&lt;ref name = knight/&gt;&lt;ref name = devil/&gt; Given these varied and even contradictory interpretations of the colour green, its precise meaning in the poem remains ambiguous.

===Interpretations===
Of the many characters similar to him, the Green Knight of ''Sir Gawain'' is the first to be green.&lt;ref&gt;Krappe, A. H. "Who Was the Green Knight?" ''Speculum''. (April 1938) 13.2 pgs. 206-215&lt;/ref&gt; Because of his strange colour, some scholars believe him to be a manifestation of the [[Green Man]] figure of medieval art,&lt;ref name = knight/&gt; or as a representation of both the vitality and fearful unpredictability of nature. That he carries a green [[holly]] branch, and the comparison of his beard to a bush, has guided many scholars to this interpretation. The gold entwined in the cloth wrapped around his axe, combined with the green, gives him both a wild and an aristocratic air.&lt;ref name = gold/&gt; Others consider him as being an incarnation of the [[Devil]].&lt;ref name = knight/&gt; In one interpretation, it is thought that the Green Knight, as the "Lord of [[Hades]]", has come to challenge the noble knights of King Arthur's court. Sir Gawain, the bravest of the knights, therefore proves himself equal to [[Hercules]] in challenging the Knight, tying the story to ancient [[Greek mythology]].&lt;ref name=evil/&gt; Scholars like Curely claim the descriptive features of the Green Knight suggest a servitude to Satan such as the beaver-hued beard alluding to the allegorical significance of beavers for the Christian audience of the time who believed that they renounced the world and paid "tribute to the devil for spiritual freedom." &lt;ref&gt;Curley, Michael J. "A Note of Bertilak's Beard." ''Modern Philology'', vol. 73, no.1, 1975, pp.70&lt;/ref&gt;Another possible interpretation of the Green Knight views him as combining elements from the Greek Hades and the Christian [[Messiah]], at once representing both good and evil and life and death as self-proliferating cycles. This interpretation embraces the positive and negative attributes of the colour green and relates to the enigmatic motif of the poem.&lt;ref name = knight/&gt; The description of the Green Knight upon his entrance to Arthur's Court as "from neck to loin… strong and thickly made" is considered by some scholars as homoerotic.&lt;ref&gt;Zeikowitz, Richard E. "Befriending the Medieval Queer: A Pedagogy for Literature Classes" ''College English Special Issue: Lesbian and Gay Studies/Queer Pedagogies''. 65.1 (2002) 67-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

C.S. Lewis declared the Green Knight "as vivid and concrete as any image in literature" and further described him as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
a living ''coincidentia oppositorum''; half giant, yet wholly a "lovely" knight"; as full of demoniac energy as old Karamazov, yet in his own house, as jolly as a Dickensian Christmas host; now exhibiting a ferocity so gleeful that it is almost genial, and now a geniality so outrageous that it borders on the ferocious; half boy or buffoon in his shouts and laughter and jumpings; yet at the end judging Gawain with the tranquil superiority of an angelic being &lt;ref&gt;"The Anthropological Approach," in ''English and Medieval Studies Presented to J.R.R. Tolkien on the Occasion of His Seventieth Birthday'', ed. Norman Davis and C.L. Wrenn (London: Allen and Unwin, 1962), 219-30; reprinted in ''Critical Studies of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'', ed. Donald R. Howard and Christian Zacher (Notre Dame, Ind. and London: Univ. of Notre Dame Press, 1968), 63.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Green Knight could also be interpreted as a blend of two traditional figures in romance and medieval narratives, namely, "the literary green man" and the "literary wild man."&lt;ref name = benson&gt;Larry D. Benson, ''Art and Tradition in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'' (New Brunswick: Rutgers Univ. Press, 1965), 56-95&lt;/ref&gt;  "The literary green man" signifies "youth, natural vitality, and love," whereas the "literary wild man" represents the "hostility to knighthood," "the demonic" and "death."  The Knight's green skin connects the green of the costume to the green of the hair and beard, thus connecting the green man's pleasant manners and significance into the wild man's grotesque qualities.&lt;ref name = benson/&gt;

===Jack in the green===
{{main|Jack in the green}}

The Green Knight is also compared to the English holiday figure [[Jack in the green]]. Jack is part of a [[May Day]] holiday tradition in some parts of England, but his connection to the Knight is found mainly in the [[Derbyshire]] tradition of [[Castleton Garland Day|Castleton Garland]]. In this tradition, a kind of Jack in the green known as the Garland King is led through the town on a horse, wearing a bell-shaped [[garland]] of flowers that covers his entire upper body, and followed by young girls dressed in white, who dance at various points along the route (formerly the town's bellringers, who still make the garland, also performed this role). On the top of the King's garland is the "queen", a posy of bright flowers. The King is also accompanied by his elegantly dressed female consort (nowadays, confusingly, also known as the Queen); played by a woman during recent times, until 1956 "the Woman" was always a man in woman's clothing. At the end of the ceremony, the queen posy is taken off the garland, to be placed on the town's [[war memorial]]. The Garland King then rides to the church tower where the garland is hauled up the side of the tower and impaled upon a [[pinnacle]].&lt;ref&gt;Hole, Christina. "A Dictionary of British Folk Customs." Paladin Books/Granada Publishing (1978) 114-115&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the nature imagery associated with the Green Knight, the ceremony has been interpreted as possibly deriving from his famous beheading in the ''Gawain'' poem. In this case, the posy's removal would symbolise the loss of the knight's head.&lt;ref&gt;Rix, Michael M. "A Re-Examination of the Castleton Garlanding." ''Folklore'' (June 1953) 64.2 pgs. 342-344&lt;/ref&gt;

==Green Chapel==
In the poem ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight|Gawain]]'', when the Knight is beheaded, he tells Gawain to meet him at the Green [[Chapel]], saying that all nearby know where it is. Indeed, the guide which is to bring Gawain there from Bertilak's castle grows very fearful as they near it and begs Gawain to turn back. The final meeting at the Green Chapel has caused many scholars to draw religious connections, with the Knight fulfilling a [[priest]]ly role with Gawain as a [[Confession (religion)|penitent]]. The Green Knight ultimately, in this interpretation, judges Gawain to be a worthy knight, and lets him live, playing a priest, [[God]], and judge all at once.

The Chapel is considered by Gawain as an evil place: foreboding, "the most accursed church", "the place for the Devil to recite [[matins]]"; but when the mysterious Knight allows Gawain to live, Gawain immediately assumes the role of penitent to a priest or judge, as in a genuine church. The Green Chapel may also be related to tales of fairy hills or knolls of earlier [[Celtic literature]]. Some scholars have wondered whether "Hautdesert" refers to the Green Chapel, as it means "High Hermitage"; but such a connection is doubted by most scholars.&lt;ref name = knight/&gt; As to the location of the Chapel, in the ''Greene Knight'' poem, Sir Bredbeddle's living place is described as "the castle of hutton", causing some scholars to suggest a connection with Hutton Manor House in [[Somerset]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Edward. "Sir Gawain and the Green Knight and the Stanley Family of Stanley, Storeton, and Hooton." ''The Review of English Studies''. (August 1979) 30.119 pgs. 308-316&lt;/ref&gt; Gawain's journey leads him directly into the centre of the Pearl Poet's dialect region, where the candidates for the locations of the Castle at Hautdesert and the Green Chapel stand. Hautdesert is thought to be in the area of Swythamley in northwest Midland, as it is in the writer's dialect area, and matches the land features described in the poem. The area is also known to have housed all of the animals hunted by Bertilak (deer, boar, fox) in the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | last =Twomey  | first =Michael  | coauthors =  | title =Hautdesert  | work =Travels With Sir Gawain  | publisher =Ithaca Univ  | date =  | url =http://www.ithaca.edu/faculty/twomey/travels/sggk_frameset.htm  | doi =  | accessdate =2007-06-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Green Chapel is thought to be in either [[Lud's Church]] or [[Wetton Mill]], as these areas closely match the descriptions given by the author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | last =Twomey  | first =Michael  | coauthors =  | title =The Green Chapel  | work =Travels With Sir Gawain  | publisher =Ithaca Univ  | date =  | url =http://www.ithaca.edu/faculty/twomey/travels/sggk_frameset.htm  | doi =  | accessdate =2007-06-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ralph Elliott]] for example located the chapel the knight searches for near ("two myle henne" v1078) the old manor house at Swythamley Park at the bottom of a valley ("bothm of the brem valay" v2145) on a hillside ("loke a littel on the launde, on thi lyfte honde" v2147) in a large fissure ("an olde caue,/or a creuisse of an olde cragge" v2182-83).&lt;ref&gt;RWV Elliott.

'''Han unification''' is an effort by the authors of [[Unicode]] and the [[Universal Character Set]] to map multiple [[character set]]s of the so-called [[CJK characters|CJK]] languages into a single set of unified [[grapheme|characters]]. [[Han character]]s are a common feature of written [[Chinese language|Chinese]] ([[hanzi]]), [[Japanese language|Japanese]] ([[kanji]]), and [[Korean language|Korean]] ([[hanja]]).

Modern Chinese, Japanese and Korean [[typeface]]s typically use regional or historical [[Variant Chinese character|variants of a given Han character]]. In the formulation of Unicode, an attempt was made to unify these variants by considering them different [[glyphs]] representing the same "[[grapheme]]", or [[orthography|orthographic]] unit, hence, "Han unification", with the resulting character repertoire sometimes contracted to '''Unihan'''.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

'''Unihan''' can also refer to the Unihan Database maintained by the [[Unicode Consortium]], which provides information about all of the unified Han characters encoded in the Unicode Standard, including mappings to various national and industry standards, indices into standard dictionaries, encoded variants, pronunciations in various languages, and an English definition. The database is available to the public as text files&lt;ref name="UnihanZip"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/Unihan.zip|title=Unihan.zip|work=The Unicode Standard|publisher=Unicode Consortium}}&lt;/ref&gt; and via an interactive website.&lt;ref name="UnihanLookup"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/charts/unihan.html|title=Unihan Database Lookup|work=The Unicode Standard|publisher=Unicode Consortium}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/cgi-bin/GetUnihanData.pl?codepoint=4E2D|title=Unihan Database Lookup: Sample lookup for 中|work=The Unicode Standard|publisher=Unicode Consortium}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The latter also includes representative glyphs and definitions for compound words drawn from the free Japanese [[EDICT]] and Chinese [[CEDICT]] dictionary projects (which are provided for convenience and are not a formal part of the Unicode Standard).

==Rationale and controversy==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2007}}

The Unicode Standard details the principles of Han unification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode11.0.0/ch18.pdf#G11484|title=Chapter 18: East Asia, Principles of Han Unification|work=The Unicode Standard|publisher=Unicode Consortium}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/notes/tn26/|title=Unicode Technical Note 26: On the Encoding of Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, and Han|first=Ken|last=Whistler|date=2010-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Ideographic Rapporteur Group]] (IRG), made up of experts from the Chinese-speaking countries, North and South Korea, Japan, Vietnam, and other countries, is responsible for the process.

One possible rationale is the desire to limit the size of the full Unicode character set, where CJK characters as represented by discrete [[ideograms]] may approach or exceed 100,000 (while those required for ordinary literacy in any language are probably under 3,000). Version 1 of Unicode was designed to fit into 16 bits and only 20,940 characters (32%) out of the possible 65,536 were reserved for these [[CJK Unified Ideographs]]. Later Unicode has been extended to 21 bits allowing many more CJK characters (87,887 are assigned, with room for more).

The article [https://web.archive.org/web/20131216023226/http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/u-secret.html ''The secret life of Unicode''], located on IBM DeveloperWorks attempts to illustrate part of the motivation for Han unification:

{{quote|The problem stems from the fact that Unicode encodes characters rather than "glyphs", which are the visual representations of the characters. There are four basic traditions for East Asian character shapes: traditional Chinese, simplified Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. While the Han root character may be the same for CJK languages, the glyphs in common use for the same characters may not be, and new characters were invented in each country.

For example, the traditional Chinese glyph for "grass" uses four strokes for the "grass" radical [[wikt:艹|艹]], whereas the simplified Chinese, Japanese, and Korean glyphs use three. But there is only one Unicode point for the grass character ({{U+|8349}}) regardless of writing system. Another example is the ideograph for "one" ([[Wiktionary:壹|壹]], [[Wiktionary:壱|壱]], or [[Wiktionary:一|一]]), which is different in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. Many people think that the three versions should be encoded differently.}}

In fact, the three ideographs for "one" are encoded separately in Unicode, as they are not considered national variants. The first and second are used on financial instruments to prevent tampering (they may be considered variants), while the third is the common form in all three countries.

However, Han unification has also caused considerable controversy, particularly among the Japanese public, who, with the nation's literati, have a history of protesting the culling of historically and culturally significant variants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tronweb.super-nova.co.jp/unicoderevisited.html Unicode Revisited] Steven J. Searle; Web Master, TRON Web&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mojikiban.ipa.go.jp/1292.html|title=IVD/IVSとは - 文字情報基盤整備事業|website=mojikiban.ipa.go.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See {{section link|Kanji|Orthographic reform and lists of kanji}}. Today, the list of characters officially recognized for use in proper names continues to expand at a modest pace.)

In 1993, the [[Japan Electronic Industries Development Association]] (JEIDA) published a pamphlet titled "{{lang|ja|未来の文字コード体系に私達は不安をもっています}}" (We are feeling anxious for the future character encoding system {{JPNO|20985671}}), summarizing major criticism against the Han Unification approach adopted by Unicode.

===Graphemes versus glyphs===

[[File:LatinAgraphemeVariations.svg|thumb|right|The Latin small "[[a]]" has widely differing glyphs that all represent concrete instances of the same abstract grapheme. Although a native reader of any language using the Latin script recognizes these two glyphs as the same grapheme, to others they might appear to be completely unrelated.]]
A grapheme is the smallest abstract unit of meaning in a writing system. Any grapheme has many possible glyph expressions, but all are recognized as the same grapheme by those with reading and writing knowledge of a particular writing system. Although Unicode typically assigns characters to code points to express the graphemes within a system of writing, the Unicode Standard ([https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode10.0.0/ch03.pdf#G2212 section 3.4 ''D7'']) does with caution:

&lt;blockquote cite='https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode10.0.0/ch03.pdf#G2212'&gt;&lt;div&gt;
An abstract character does not necessarily correspond to what a user thinks of as a "character" and should not be confused with a ''grapheme''.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, this quote refers to the fact that some graphemes are composed of several characters. So, for example, the character
{{unichar|0061|LATIN SMALL LETTER A}} combined with {{unichar|030A|COMBINING RING ABOVE|cwith=◌}} (i.e. the combination "å") might be understood by a user as a single grapheme while being composed of multiple Unicode abstract characters. In addition, Unicode also assigns some code points to a small number (other than for compatibility reasons) of formatting characters, whitespace characters, and  other abstract characters that are not graphemes, but instead used to control the breaks between lines, words, graphemes and grapheme clusters. With the unified Han ideographs, the Unicode Standard makes a departure from prior practices in assigning abstract characters not as graphemes, but according to the underlying meaning of the grapheme: what linguists sometimes call [[sememe]]s. This departure therefore is not simply explained by the oft quoted distinction between an abstract character and a glyph, but is more rooted in the difference between an abstract character assigned as a grapheme and an abstract character assigned as a sememe. In contrast, consider [[ASCII]]'s unification of [[punctuation]] and [[diacritic]]s, where graphemes with widely different meanings (for example, an apostrophe and a single quotation mark) are unified because the graphemes are the same. For Unihan the characters are not unified by their appearance, but by their definition or meaning.

For a grapheme to be represented by various glyphs means that the grapheme has glyph variations that are usually determined by selecting one font or another or using glyph substitution features where multiple glyphs are included in a single font. Such glyph variations are considered by Unicode a feature of rich text protocols and not properly handled by the plain text goals of Unicode. However, when the change from one glyph to another constitutes a change from one grapheme to another—where a glyph cannot possibly still, for example, mean the same grapheme understood as the small letter "a"—Unicode separates those into separate code points. For Unihan the same thing is done whenever the abstract meaning changes, however rather than speaking of the abstract meaning of a grapheme (the letter "a"), the unification of Han ideographs assigns a new code point for each different meaning—even if that meaning is expressed by distinct graphemes in different languages. Although a grapheme such as "ö" might mean something different in English (as used in the word "coördinated") than it does in German, it is still the same grapheme and can be easily unified so that English and German can share a common abstract Latin writing system (along with Latin itself). This example also points to another reason that "abstract character" and grapheme as an abstract unit in a written language do not necessarily map one-to-one. In English the combining diaeresis, "¨",  and the "o" it modifies may be seen as two separate graphemes, whereas in languages such as Swedish, the letter "ö" may be seen as a single grapheme. Similarly in English the dot on an "i" is understood as a part of the "i" grapheme whereas in other languages, such as Turkish, the dot may be seen as a separate grapheme added to the dotless "ı".

To deal with the use of different graphemes for the same Unihan sememe, Unicode has relied on several mechanisms: especially as it relates to rendering text. One has been to treat it as simply a font issue so that different fonts might be used to render Chinese, Japanese or Korean. Also font formats such as OpenType allow for the mapping of alternate glyphs according to language so that a text rendering system can look to the user's environmental settings to determine which glyph to use. The problem with these approaches is that they fail to meet the goals of Unicode to define a consistent way of encoding multilingual text.&lt;ref name="tusch01"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode11.0.0/ch01.pdf|title=Chapter 1: Introduction|work=The Unicode Standard|publisher=Unicode Consortium}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So rather than treat the issue as a rich text problem of glyph alternates, Unicode added the concept of [[Variation Selectors (Unicode block)|variation selectors]], first introduced in version 3.2 and supplemented in version 4.0.&lt;ref name="UnicodeVariationSelectors"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/ivd/|title=Ideographic Variation Database|publisher=Unicode Consortium}}&lt;/ref&gt; While variation selectors are treated as combining characters, they have no associated diacritic or mark. Instead, by combining with a base character, they signal the two character sequence selects a variation (typically in terms of grapheme, but also in terms of underlying meaning as in the case of a location name or other proper noun) of the base character. This then is not a selection of an alternate glyph, but the selection of a grapheme variation or a variation of the base abstract character. Such a two-character sequence however can be easily mapped to a separate single glyph in modern fonts. Since Unicode has assigned 256 separate variation selectors, it is capable of assigning 256 variations for any Han ideograph. Such variations can be specific to one language or another and enable the encoding of plain text that includes such grapheme variations.

=== Unihan "abstract characters" ===
Since the Unihan standard encodes "abstract characters", not "glyphs", the graphical artifacts produced by Unicode have been considered temporary technical hurdles, and at most, cosmetic. However, again, particularly in Japan, due in part to the way in which Chinese characters were incorporated into Japanese writing systems historically, the inability to specify a particular variant was considered a significant obstacle to the use of Unicode in scholarly work. For example, the unification of "grass" (explained above), means that a historical text cannot be encoded so as to preserve its peculiar orthography. Instead, for example, the scholar would be required to locate the desired glyph in a specific typeface in order to convey the text as written, defeating the purpose of a unified character set. Unicode has responded to these needs by assigning variation selectors so that authors can select grapheme variations of particular ideographs (or even other characters).&lt;ref name="UnicodeVariationSelectors" /&gt;

Small differences in graphical representation are also problematic when they affect legibility or belong to the wrong cultural tradition. Besides making some Unicode fonts unusable for texts involving multiple "Unihan languages", names or other orthographically sensitive terminology might be displayed incorrectly. (Proper names tend to be especially orthographically conservative—compare this to changing the spelling of one's name to suit a language reform in the US or UK.) While this may be considered primarily a graphical representation or rendering problem to be overcome by more artful fonts, the widespread use of Unicode would make it difficult to preserve such distinctions. The problem of one character representing semantically different concepts is also present in the Latin part of Unicode. The Unicode character for an apostrophe is the same as the character for a right single quote (’). On the other hand, the capital Latin letter "A" is not unified with the Greek letter "Α" (Alpha). This is, of course, desirable for reasons of compatibility, and deals with a much smaller alphabetic character set.

While the unification aspect of Unicode is controversial in some quarters for the reasons given above, Unicode itself does now encode a vast number of seldom-used characters of a more-or-less antiquarian nature.

Some of the controversy stems from the fact that the very decision of performing Han unification was made by the initial Unicode Consortium, which at the time was a consortium of North American companies and organizations (most of them in California),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/history/earlyyears.html|title=Early Years of Unicode|publisher=Unicode Consortium}}&lt;/ref&gt; but included no East Asian government representatives. The initial design goal was to create a 16-bit standard,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/history/unicode88.pdf|title=Unicode 88|first=Joseph D.|last=Becker|date=1998-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Han unification was therefore a critical step for avoiding tens of thousands of character duplications. This 16-bit requirement was later abandoned, making the size of the character set less an issue today.

The controversy later extended to the internationally representative ISO: the initial CJK-JRG group favored a proposal (DIS 10646) for a non-unified character set, "which was thrown out in favor of unification with the Unicode Consortium's unified character set by the votes of American and European ISO members" (even though the Japanese position was unclear).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jbrowse.com/text/unij.html|title=Unicode in Japan: Guide to a technical and psychological struggle|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627072117/http://www.jbrowse.com/text/unij.html|archivedate=2009-06-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Endorsing the Unicode Han unification was a necessary step for the heated ISO 10646/Unicode merger.

Much of the controversy surrounding Han unification is based on the distinction between [[glyph]]s, as defined in Unicode, and the related but distinct idea of [[grapheme]]s. Unicode assigns abstract characters (graphemes), as opposed to glyphs, which are a particular visual representations of a character in a specific [[typeface]]. One character may be represented by many distinct glyphs, for example a "g" or an "a", both of which may have one loop (&lt;span style="font-family:serif"&gt;''a''&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="font-family:sans-serif"&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;) or two (&lt;span style="font-family:serif"&gt;a, g&lt;/span&gt;). Yet for a reader of Latin script based languages the two variations of the "a" character are both recognized as the same grapheme. Graphemes present in national character code standards have been added to Unicode, as required by Unicode's Source Separation rule, even where they can be composed of characters already available. The national character code standards existing in CJK languages are considerably more involved, given the technological limitations under which they evolved, and so the official CJK participants in Han unification may well have been amenable to reform.

Unlike European versions, CJK Unicode fonts, due to Han unification, have large but irregular patterns of overlap, requiring language-specific fonts. Unfortunately, language-specific fonts also make it difficult to access a variant which, as with the "grass" example, happens to appear more typically in another language style. (That is to say, it would be difficult to access "grass" with the four-stroke radical more typical of Traditional Chinese in a Japanese environment, which fonts would typically depict the three-stroke radical.) Unihan proponents tend to favor markup languages for defining language strings, but this would not ensure the use of a specific variant in the case given, only the language-specific font more likely to depict a character as that variant. (At this point, merely stylistic differences do enter in, as a selection of Japanese and Chinese fonts are not likely to be visually compatible.)

Chinese users seem to have fewer objections to Han unification, largely because Unicode did not attempt to unify [[Simplified Chinese characters]] with [[Traditional Chinese characters]]. (Simplified Chinese characters are an invention of the [[People's Republic of China]] and they are used among Chinese speakers in the PRC, [[Singapore]], and [[Malaysia]]. Traditional Chinese characters are used in Hong Kong and Taiwan ([[Big5]]) and they are, with some differences, more familiar to Korean and Japanese users.) Unicode is seen as neutral with regards to this politically charged issue, and has encoded Simplified and Traditional Chinese glyphs separately (e.g. the ideograph for "discard" is 丟 U+4E1F for Traditional Chinese Big5 #A5E1 and 丢 U+4E22 for Simplified Chinese GB #2210). It is also noted that Traditional and Simplified characters should be encoded separately according to Unicode Han Unification rules, because they are distinguished in pre-existing PRC character sets. Furthermore, as with other variants, Traditional to Simplified characters is not a one-to-one relationship.

==={{anchor|GCS|UTF-2000}}Alternatives===
There are several alternative character sets that are not encoding according to the principle of Han Unification, and thus free from its restrictions:
*[[CNS character set]]
*[[CCCII character set]]
*[[TRON (encoding)|TRON]]
*[[Mojikyo]]
These region-dependent character sets are also seen as not affected by Han Unification because of their region-specific nature:
*[[ISO/IEC 2022]] (based on sequence codes to switch between Chinese, Japanese, Korean character sets – hence without unification)
*[[Big5#Extensions|Big5 extensions]]
*[[Government Chinese Character Set|GCCS]] and its successor [[HKSCS]]
However, none of these alternative standards has been as widely adopted as [[Unicode]], which is now the base character set for many new standards and protocols, internationally adopted, and is built into the architecture of operating systems ([[Microsoft Windows]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[macOS]], and many [[Unix-like]] systems), programming languages ([[Perl]], [[Python Programming Language|Python]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Common Lisp]], [[APL programming language|APL]], [[C_(programming_language)|C]], [[C++]]), and libraries (IBM [[International Components for Unicode]] (ICU) along with the [[Pango]], [[Graphite (SIL)|Graphite]], [[Qt (toolkit)|Scribe]], [[Uniscribe]], and [[Apple Type Services for Unicode Imaging|ATSUI]] rendering engines), font formats ([[TrueType]] and [[OpenType]]) and so on.

In March 1989, a [[BTRON|(B)TRON]]-based system was adopted by Japanese government organizations "Center for Educational Computing" as the system of choice for school education including [[compulsory education]].&lt;ref&gt;小林紀興『松下電器の果し状』1章&lt;/ref&gt; However, in April, a report titled "1989 National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers" from [[Office of the United States Trade Representative]] have specifically listed the system as a trade barrier in Japan. The report claimed that the adoption of the TRON-based system by the Japanese government is advantageous to Japanese manufacturers, and thus excluding US operating systems from the huge new market; specifically the report lists MS-DOS, OS/2 and UNIX as examples. The Office of USTR was allegedly under Microsoft's influence as its former officer Tom Robertson was then offered a lucrative position by Microsoft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Krikke|first1=Jan|title=The Most Popular Operating System in the World|url=http://www.linuxinsider.com/story/31855.html|website=LinuxInsider.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the TRON system itself was subsequently removed from the list of sanction by [[Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974]] after protests by the organization in May 1989, the trade dispute caused the [[Ministry of International Trade and Industry]] to accept a request from [[Masayoshi Son]] to cancel the Center of Educational Computing's selection of the TRON-based system for the use of educational computers.&lt;ref&gt;大下英治 『孫正義 起業の若き獅子』（{{ISBN|4-06-208718-9}}）pp. 285-294&lt;/ref&gt; The incident is regarded as a symbolic event for the loss of momentum and eventual demise of the BTRON system, which led to the widespread adoption of MS-DOS in Japan and the eventual adoption of Unicode with its successor Windows.

===Merger of all equivalent characters===
There has not been any push for full semantic unification of all semantically-linked characters, though the idea would treat the respective users of East Asian languages the same, whether they write in Korean, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, [[Kyūjitai]] Japanese, [[Shinjitai]] Japanese or Vietnamese. Instead of some variants getting unique code points while other groups of variants have to share single code points, all variants could be reliably expressed only with metadata tags (e.g., CSS formatting in webpages). The burden would be on all those who use differing versions of 直, 別, 兩, 兔, whether that difference be due to simplification, international variance or intra-national variance. However, for some platforms (e.g., smartphones), a device may come with only one font pre-installed. The system font must make a decision for the default glyph for each code point and these glyphs can differ greatly, indicating different underlying graphemes.

Consequently, relying on language markup across the board as an approach is beset with two major issues. First, there are contexts where language markup is not available (code commits, plain text). Second, any solution would require every operating system to come pre-installed with many glyphs for semantically identical characters that have many variants. In addition to the standard character sets in Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, Kyūjitai Japanese and Shinjitai Japanese, there also exist "ancient" forms of characters that are of interest to historians, linguists and philologists.

Unicode's Unihan database has already drawn connections between many characters. The Unicode database catalogs the connections between variant characters with unique code points already. However, for characters with a shared code point, the reference glyph image is usually biased toward the Traditional Chinese version. Also, the decision of whether to classify pairs as semantic variants or [[z-variant]]s is not always consistent or clear, despite rationalizations in the handbook.&lt;ref name="uax38"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr38/|title=UAX #38: Unicode Han Database (Unihan)|website=www.unicode.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So-called semantic variants of 丟 (U+4E1F) and 丢 (U+4E22) are examples that Unicode gives as differing in a significant way in their abstract shapes, while Unicode lists 佛 and 仏 as z-variants, differing only in font styling. Paradoxically, Unicode considers 兩 and 両 to be near identical z-variants while at the same time classifying them as significantly different semantic variants. There are also cases of some pairs of characters being simultaneously semantic variants and specialized semantic variants and simplified variants: 個 (U+500B) and 个 (U+4E2A). There are cases of non-mutual equivalence. For example, the Unihan database entry for 亀 (U+4E80) considers 龜 (U+9F9C) to be its z-variant, but the entry for 龜 does not list 亀 as a z-variant, even though 龜 was obviously already in the database at the time that the entry for 亀 was written.

Some clerical errors led to doubling of completely identical characters such as 﨣 (U+FA23) and 𧺯 (U+27EAF). If a font has glyphs encoded to both points so that one font is used for both, they should appear identical. These cases are listed as z-variants despite having no variance at all. Intentionally duplicated characters were added to facilitate [[Round-trip format conversion|bit-for-bit round-trip conversion]]. Because round-trip conversion was an early selling point of Unicode, this meant that if a national standard in use unnecessarily duplicated a character, Unicode had to do the same. Unicode calls these intentional duplications "[[Unicode compatibility characters|compatibility variants]]" as with 漢 (U+FA9A) which calls 漢 (U+6F22) its compatibility variant. As long as an application uses the same font for both, they should appear identical. Sometimes, as in the case of 車 with U+8ECA and U+F902, the added compatibility character lists the already present version of 車 as both its compatibility variant and its z-variant. The compatibility variant field overrides the z-variant field, forcing normalization under all forms, including canonical equivalence. Despite the name, compatibility variants are actually canonically equivalent and are united in any Unicode normalization scheme and not only under compatibility normalization.{{efn|name=DisplayProblem|Wikipedia implements a code normalization that makes it impossible to display both characters but both can be accessed at the [https://www.unicode.org/charts/unihan.html Unihan database].}} This is similar to how {{unichar|212b|ANGSTROM SIGN}} is canonically equivalent to a pre-composed {{unichar|c5|CAPITAL LATIN LETTER A WITH RING ABOVE}}. Much software (such as the MediaWiki software that hosts Wikipedia) will replace all canonically equivalent characters that are discouraged (e.g. the angstrom symbol) with the recommended equivalent. Despite the name, CJK "compatibility variants" are canonically equivalent characters and not compatibility characters.

漢 (U+FA9A) was added to the database later than 漢 (U+6F22) was and its entry informs the user of the compatibility information. On the other hand, 漢 (U+6F22) does not have this equivalence listed in this entry. Unicode demands that all entries, once admitted, cannot change compatibility or equivalence so that normalization rules for already existing characters do not change.

Some pairs of Traditional and Simplified are also considered to be semantic variants. According to Unicode's definitions, it makes sense that all simplifications (that do not result in wholly different characters being merged for their homophony) will be a form of semantic variant. Unicode classifies 丟 and 丢 as each other's respective traditional and simplified variants and also as each other's semantic variants. However, while Unicode classifies 億 (U+5104) and 亿 (U+4EBF) as each other's respective traditional and simplified variants, Unicode does not consider 億 and 亿 to be semantic variants of each other.

Unicode claims that "Ideally, there would be no pairs of z-variants in the Unicode Standard."&lt;ref name="uax38"/&gt; This would make it seem that the goal is to at least unify all minor variants, compatibility redundancies and accidental redundancies, leaving the differentiation to fonts and to language tags. This conflicts with the stated goal of Unicode to take away that overhead, and to allow any number of any of the world's scripts to be on the same document with one encoding system.{{improper synthesis?|date=September 2018}} Chapter One of the handbook states that "With Unicode, the  information technology industry has replaced proliferating character sets with data stability, global interoperability and data interchange, simplified software, and reduced development costs. While taking the ASCII character set as its starting point, the Unicode Standard  goes far beyond ASCII's limited ability to encode only the upper- and lowercase letters A through Z. It provides the capacity to encode all characters used for the  written languages of the world – more than 1 million characters can be encoded. No escape sequence or control code is required to specify any character in any language. The Unicode character encoding treats alphabetic characters, ideographic characters, and symbols equivalently, which means they can be used in any mixture and with equal facility."&lt;ref name="tusch01"/&gt;

That leaves us with settling on one unified reference grapheme for all z-variants, which is contentious since few outside of Japan would recognize 佛 and 仏 as equivalent. Even within Japan, the variants are on different sides of a major simplification called Shinjitai. Unicode would effectively make the PRC's simplification of 侣 (U+4FA3) and 侶 (U+4FB6) a monumental difference by comparison. Such a plan would also eliminate the very visually distinct variations for characters like 直 (U+76F4) and 雇 (U+96C7).

One would expect that all simplified characters would simultaneously also be z-variants or semantic variants with their traditional counterparts, but many are neither. It is easier to explain the strange case that semantic variants can be simultaneously both semantic variants and specialized variants when Unicode's definition is that specialized semantic variants have the same meaning only in certain contexts. Languages use them differently. A pair whose characters are 100% drop-in replacements for each other in Japanese may not be so flexible in Chinese. Thus, any comprehensive merger of recommended code points would have to maintain some variants that differ only slightly in appearance even if the meaning is 100% the same for all contexts in one language, because in another language the two characters may not be 100% drop-in replacements.

== Examples of language-dependent glyphs ==
In each row of the following table, the same character is repeated in all five columns. However, each column is marked (by the &lt;tt&gt;lang&lt;/tt&gt; attribute) as being in a different language: [[Chinese language|Chinese]] (two varieties: [[Simplified Chinese character|simplified]] and [[Traditional Chinese character|traditional]]), [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], or [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]. The [[Web browser|browser]] should select, for each character, a [[glyph]] (from a [[Typeface|font]]) suitable to the specified language. (Besides actual character variation—look for differences in stroke order, number, or direction—the typefaces may also reflect different typographical styles, as with serif and non-serif alphabets.) This only works for fallback glyph selection if you have CJK fonts installed on your system and the font selected to display this article does not include glyphs for these characters.

No character variant that is exclusive to Korean or Vietnamese has received a unique code point, whereas almost all Shinjitai Japanese variants or Simplified Chinese variants each have unique code points and unambiguous reference glyphs in the Unicode standard.

In the twentieth century, East Asian countries made their own respective encoding standards. Within each standard, there coexisted variants with unique code points, hence the unique code points in Unicode for certain sets of variants. Taking Simplified Chinese as an example, the two character variants of 內 (U+5167) and 内 (U+5185) differ in exactly the same way as do the Korean and non-Korean variants of 全 (U+5168). Each respective variant of the first character has either 入 (U+5165) or 人 (U+4EBA). Each respective variant of the second character has either 入 (U+5165) or 人 (U+4EBA). Both variants of the first character got their own unique code points. However, the two variants of the second character had to share the same code point.

The justification Unicode gives is that the national standards body in the PRC made unique code points for the two variations of the first character 內/内, whereas Korea never made separate code points for the unique variants of 全. There is a reason for this that has nothing to do with how the domestic bodies view the characters themselves. China went through a process in the twentieth century that changed (if not simplified) several characters. During this transition, there was a need to be able encode both variants within the same document. Korean has always used the variant of {{lang|ko|全}} with the 入 (U+5165) radical on top. Therefore, it had no reason to encode both variants. Korean language documents made in the twentieth century had little reason to represent both versions in the same document.

Almost all of the variants that the PRC developed or standardized got unique code points owing simply to the fortune of the Simplified Chinese transition carrying through into the computing age. This privilege however, seems to apply inconsistently, whereas most simplifications performed in Japan and mainland China with code points in national standards, including characters simplified differently in each country, did make it into Unicode as unique code points.

62 Shinjitai "simplified" characters with unique code points in Japan got merged with their Kyūjitai traditional equivalents, like 海. This can cause problems for the language tagging strategy. There is no universal tag for the traditional and "simplified" versions of Japanese as there are for Chinese. Thus, any Japanese writer wanting to display the Kyūjitai form of 海 may have to tag the character as "Traditional Chinese" or trust that the recipient's Japanese font uses only the Kyūjitai glyphs, but tags of Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese may be necessary to show the two forms side-by-side in a Japanese textbook. This would preclude one from using the same font for an entire document, however. There are two unique code points for 海 in Unicode, but only for "compatibility reasons". Any Unicode-conformant font must display the Kyūjitai and Shinjitai versions' equivalent code points in Unicode as the same. Unofficially, a font may display 海 differently with U+6D77 as the Shinjitai version and U+FA45 as the Kyūjitai version (which is identical to the traditional version in written Chinese and Korean).{{efn|name=DisplayProblem}}

The radical 糸 (U+7CF8) is used in characters like 紅/红, with two variants, the second form being simply the cursive form. The radical components of 紅 (U+7D05) and 红 (U+7EA2) are semantically identical and the glyphs differ only in the latter using a cursive version of the 糸 component. However, in mainland China, the standards bodies wanted to standardize the cursive form when used in characters like 红. Because this change happened relatively recently, there was a transition period. Both 紅 (U+7D05) and 红 (U+7EA2) got separate code points in the PRC's text encoding standards bodies so Chinese-language documents could use both version. The two variants each received unique code points in Unicode as well.

The case of the radical 艸 (U+8278) proves how arbitrary the state of affairs is. When used to compose characters like 草 (U+8349), the radical was placed at the top, but had two different forms. Traditional Chinese and Korean use a four-stroke version. At the top of {{lang|zh-Hant|草}} should be something that looks like two plus signs ({{lang|zh-Hant|艹}}). Simplified Chinese, Kyūjitai Japanese and Shinjitai Japanese use a three-stroke version, like two plus signs sharing their horizontal strokes ({{lang|zh-Hans|艹}}, i.e. {{lang|zh-Hans|草}}). The PRC's text encoding bodies did not encode the two variants differently. The fact that almost every other change brought about by the PRC, no matter how minor, did warrant a unique code point suggests that this exception may have been unintentional. Unicode copied the existing standards as is, preserving such irregularities.

The Unicode Consortium has recognized errors in other instances. The myriad Unicode blocks for CJK Han Ideographs have redundancies in original standards, redundancies brought about by flawed importation of the original standards, as well as accidental mergers that are later corrected, providing precedent for dis-unifying characters.

For native speakers, variants can be unintelligible or be unacceptable in educated contexts. English speakers may understand a handwritten note saying "4P5 kg" as "495 kg", but writing the nine backwards (so it looks like a "P") can be jarring and would be considered incorrect in any school. Likewise, to users of one CJK language reading a document with "foreign" glyphs: variants of 骨 can appear as mirror images, 者 can be missing a stroke/have an extraneous stroke, and 令 may be unreadable or be confused with 今 depending on which variant of 令 is used.

==Examples of some non-unified Han ideographs==
For more striking variants, Unicode has encoded variant characters, making it unnecessary to switch between fonts or &lt;tt&gt;lang&lt;/tt&gt; attributes. In the following table, each row compares variants that have been assigned different code points.&lt;ref name="UnihanLookup"/&gt; Note that for characters such as 入 (U+5165), the only way to display the two variants is to change font (or &lt;tt&gt;lang&lt;/tt&gt; attribute) as described in the previous table. However, for 內 (U+5167), there is an alternate character 内 (U+5185) as illustrated below. For some characters, like 兌/兑 (U+514C/U+5151), either method can be used to display the different glyphs.

==Ideographic Variation Database (IVD)==
{{main|Variant form (Unicode)}}
In order to resolve issues brought by Han unification, a Unicode Technical Standard known as the Unicode Ideographic Variation Database have been created to resolve the problem of specifying specific glyph in plain text environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr37/|title=UTS #37: Unicode Ideographic Variation Database|website=www.unicode.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;. By registering glyph collections into the Ideographic Variation Database (IVD), it is possible to use Ideographic Variation Selectors to form Ideographic Variation Sequence (IVS) to specify or restrict the appopriate glyph in text processing in a Unicode environment.

==Unicode ranges==
{{main|CJK Unified Ideographs}}
Ideographic characters assigned by Unicode appear in the following blocks:

*[[CJK Unified Ideographs (Unicode block)|CJK Unified Ideographs]] (4E00–9FFF) (Otherwise known as URO, abbreviation of Unified Repertoire and Ordering)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.adobe.com/CCJKType/2012/09/uro.html|title=URO|website=blogs.adobe.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[CJK Unified Ideographs Extension A]] (3400–4DBF)
*[[CJK Unified Ideographs Extension B]] (20000–2A6DF)
*[[CJK Unified Ideographs Extension C]] (2A700–2B73F)
*[[CJK Unified Ideographs Extension D]] (2B740–2B81F)
*[[CJK Unified Ideographs Extension E]] (2B820–2CEAF)
*[[CJK Unified Ideographs Extension F]] (2CEB0–2EBEF)
*[[CJK Compatibility Ideographs]] (F900–FAFF) (the twelve characters at FA0E, FA0F, FA11, FA13, FA14, FA1F, FA21, FA23, FA24, FA27, FA28 and FA29 are actually "unified ideographs" not "compatibility ideographs")

Unicode includes support of CJKV radicals, strokes, punctuation, marks and symbols in the following blocks:
*[[CJK Radicals Supplement]] (2E80–2EFF)
*[[CJK Strokes (Unicode block)|CJK Strokes]] (31C0–31EF)
*[[CJK Symbols and Punctuation]] (3000–303F)
*[[Ideographic Description Characters (Unicode block)|Ideographic Description Characters]] (2FF0–2FFF)

Additional compatibility (discouraged use) characters appear in these blocks:
*[[CJK Compatibility]] (3300–33FF)
*[[CJK Compatibility Forms]] (FE30–FE4F)
*[[CJK Compatibility Ideographs]] (F900–FAFF)
*[[CJK Compatibility Ideographs Supplement]] (2F800–2FA1F)
*[[Enclosed CJK Letters and Months]] (3200–32FF)
*[[Enclosed Ideographic Supplement]] (1F200–1F2FF)
*[[Kangxi radical#Unicode|Kangxi Radicals]] (2F00–2FDF)
These compatibility characters (excluding the twelve unified ideographs in the CJK Compatibility Ideographs block) are included for compatibility with legacy text handling systems and other legacy character sets. They include forms of characters for vertical text layout and rich text characters that Unicode recommends handling through other means.

===International Ideographs Core===
{{main|International Ideographs Core}}
The International Ideographs Core (IICore) is a subset of 9810 ideographs derived from the CJK Unified Ideographs tables, designed to be implemented in devices with limited memory, input/output capability, and/or applications where the use of the complete ISO 10646 ideograph repertoire is not feasible. There are 9810 characters in the current standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ogcio.gov.hk/en/business/tech_promotion/ccli/download_area/iicore_compare_utility.htm|title=OGCIO : Download Area : International Ideographs Core (IICORE) Comparison Utility|website=www.ogcio.gov.hk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Unihan database files ==
The Unihan project has always made an effort to make available their build database.&lt;ref name="UnihanZip"/&gt;

The libUnihan project provides a normalized SQLite Unihan database and corresponding C library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libunihan.sourceforge.net/|title=libUnihan - A library for Unihan character database in fifth normal form|first=Ding-Yi Chen|last=(陳定彞)|website=libunihan.sourceforge.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; All tables in this database are in [[fifth normal form]].  libUnihan is released under the [[LGPL]], while its database, UnihanDb, is released under the [[MIT License]].

'''Joint attention''' or '''shared attention''' is the shared focus of two individuals on an object. It is achieved when one individual alerts another to an object by means of [[eye gaze|eye-gazing]], [[pointing]] or other verbal or non-verbal indications. An individual gazes at another individual, points to an object and then returns their gaze to the individual. Scaife and Bruner were the first researchers to present a [[cross-sectional]] description of children's ability to follow eye gaze in 1975. They found that most eight- to ten-month-old children followed a line of regard, and that all 11- to 14-month-old children did so. This early research showed it was possible for an adult to bring certain objects in the environment to an infant's [[attention]] using eye gaze.&lt;ref name="Moore&amp;Dunham"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Moore |first1=C.|last2=Dunham |first2=P |title= Joint Attention: Its Origins and Role in Development |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |year=1995 |isbn=0-8058-1437-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent research demonstrates that two important skills in joint attention are following eye gaze and identifying [[intention]]. The ability to share gaze with another individual is an important skill in establishing [[reference]]. The ability to identify intention is important in a child's ability to learn language and direct the attention of others. Joint attention is important for many aspects of [[language development]] including [[language comprehension|comprehension]], [[Language production|production]] and [[Vocabulary development|word learning]]. Episodes of joint attention provide children with information about their environment, allowing individuals to establish reference from spoken language and learn words. Socio-emotional development and the ability to take part in normal relationships are also influenced by joint attention abilities. The ability to establish joint attention may be negatively affected by [[deafness]], [[blindness]], and developmental disorders such as [[autism]].

Other animals such as [[great ape]]s, [[orangutan]]s, [[chimpanzee]]s, [[dog]]s, and [[horse]]s also show some elements of joint attention.

=== Levels of joint attention ===
Defining levels of joint attention is important in determining if children are engaging in age-appropriate joint attention. There are three levels of joint attention: triadic, dyadic, and shared gaze.

Triadic joint attention is the highest level of joint attention and involves two individuals looking at an object.&lt;ref name=Oates&amp;Grayson/&gt; Each individual must understand that the other individual is looking at the same object and realize that there is an element of shared attention.&lt;ref name="Reddy" /&gt; For an instance of social engagement to count as triadic joint attention it requires at least two individuals attending to an object or focusing their attention on each other.&lt;ref name="Hobson"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hobson |first1=R.P. |editor-first=J |editor-last=Roessler |title=Joint attention: Communication and other minds |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2005 |pages=185–204|isbn=0-19-924563-0 |chapter=What puts the jointness in joint attention?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the individual must display awareness that focus is shared between himself or herself and another individual.&lt;ref name="Hobson"/&gt; Triadic attention is marked by the individual looking back to the other individual after looking at the object.

Dyadic joint attention is a conversation-like behavior that individuals engage in. This is especially true for human adults and infants, who engage in this behavior starting at two months of age.&lt;ref name=Oates&amp;Grayson/&gt; Adults and infants take turns exchanging facial expressions, noises, and in the case of the adult, speech.

Shared gaze occurs when two individuals are simply looking at an object.&lt;ref name="OkamotoBarth2006"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Okamoto-Barth |first1=S.|last2=Tomonaga |first2=M. |editor-first=M. |editor-last=Tanaka |title= Cognitive Development in Chimpanzees |publisher=Springer-Verlag |year=2006 |pages=155–171|isbn=4-431-30246-8 |chapter=Development of Joint Attention in Infant Chimpanzees}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shared gaze is the lowest level of joint attention.

Individuals who engage in triadic joint attention must understand both gaze and intention to establish common reference. Gaze refers to a child's understanding of the link between mental activity and the physical act of seeing. Intention refers to the child's ability to understand the goal of another person's mental processes.

=== Gaze ===
[[File:Click Here. No, Here.jpg|thumb|right|alt= A parent and child engage in joint attention through pointing.|A parent and child engage in joint attention through [[List of gestures#Single hand gestures|pointing]]]]
For an individual to engage in joint attention they must establish [[reference]].&lt;ref name= "D'Entremont"/&gt; Following the gaze or directive actions (such as pointing) of others is a common way of establishing reference.&lt;ref name= "D'Entremont"/&gt; For an individual to understand that following gaze establishes reference the individual must display:
* Recognition that looking is intentional behavior directed to external objects and events. Following gaze serves the purpose of establishing reference.&lt;ref name= "D'Entremont"&gt;D'Entremont, B., Yazbeck, A., Morgan, A. &amp; MacAulay, S. (2007).

Gaze becomes more complex with age and practice.&lt;ref name="Woodward"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carpenter"/&gt; As gaze increases in complexity, individuals are better able to discriminate what others are referring to.&lt;ref name="Heal2005" /&gt; Joint attention is also important for social learning. Gaze following reflects an expectation-based type of orienting in which an individual's attention is cued by another's head turn or eye turn.&lt;ref name="MacPherson"/&gt; Individuals are motivated to follow another's gaze and engage in joint attention because gaze is a cue for which rewarding events occur.&lt;ref name="MacPherson"/&gt;

=== Intention ===
The ability to identify [[intention]] is critical to joint attention. When individuals understand that others have goals, intentions, and attentional states, they are able to enter into and direct another's attention.&lt;ref name= "D'Entremont"/&gt; Joint attention promotes and maintains dyadic exchanges and learning about the nature of social partners.&lt;ref name= "D'Entremont"/&gt; The ability to engage in joint attention is crucial for language development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tomasello | first1 = M. | last2 = Farrar | first2 = J. | year = 1986 | title = Joint attention and early language | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 57 | issue = | pages = 1454–1463 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1986.tb00470.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, D.A.

Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals who are intentional in their actions display regularity in their behavior.&lt;ref name="Mumme"/&gt; Individuals locate objects with their eyes, move towards the object, and then use hands to make contact with and manipulate the object.&lt;ref name= "Mumme"&gt;Mumme, D., Bushnell, E., DiCorcia, J. &amp; Lariviere, L.

Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. {{ISBN|0-8058-4750-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Change in gaze direction is one of several behavioral cues that individuals use in combination with changes in facial and vocal displays and body posture to mark the intention to act on an object.&lt;ref name="Mumme"/&gt; Individuals who seek or follow a joint focus of attention display knowledge that what is in their awareness is also in another's awareness.&lt;ref name="Reddy"/&gt; They believe that they are experiencing the same world as others.&lt;ref name="Reddy"&gt;Reddy, V.

Joint attention plays an important role in the development of [[theory of mind]]. Theory of mind and joint attention are important precursors to a fully developed grasp of another individual's mental activity.&lt;ref name="Heal2005"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Heal |first1=J. |editor-first=J |editor-last=Roessler |title=Joint attention: Communication and other minds |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2005 |pages=34–44|chapter=Joint attention and understanding the mind}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Language comprehension ===
[[File:Wpm02 05.JPG|thumb|right|alt= Two teenagers engage in joint attention by reading a book.|Two teenagers engage in joint attention by reading a book.]]

The ability of children to extract information from their environment rests on understandings of [[Attention seeking|attentional behaviors]] such as [[List of gestures#Single hand gestures|pointing]].&lt;ref name="Woodward"/&gt; Episodes of joint attention provide children with a great deal of information about objects by establishing reference and intention.&lt;ref name="Woodward"&gt;Woodward, A. (2005). Infants' understanding of the actions involved in joint attention. In N. Eilan, C. Hoerl, T. McCormack &amp; J. Roessler (Eds.), ''Joint attention: Communication and other minds'' (pp. 110–128). Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press.{{ISBN|0-19-924563-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joint attention occurs within particular environments. The items and events in that environment provide a context that enables the child to associate meaning with a particular utterance.&lt;ref name="Bruner"&gt;Bruner, J. (1983). ''Child's talk: Learning to use language.'' (pp. 67–88). New York, NY: W.W. Norton &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt; Joint attention makes relevant aspects of the context salient, helping children comprehend what is taking place.

===Language production===
An infant's social environment relates to his or her later language development.&lt;ref name=Rollins&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rollins | first1 = P. R. | year = 2003 | title = Caregivers' contingent comments to 9-month-old infants: Relationships with later language | url = | journal = Applied Psycholinguistics | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 221–234 | doi = 10.1017/S0142716403000110 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Children's first words are closely linked to their early language experience.&lt;ref name=Oates&amp;Grayson&gt;Oates J, &amp; Grayson A. (2004). Cognitive and Language Development in Children. Oxford, UK: Blackwell Publishing. {{ISBN|1-4051-1045-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; For children with typically developing language skills, there is a close match between maternal speech and their environment: up to 78% of maternal speech is matched to the object the child is focusing on.&lt;ref name=Oates&amp;Grayson/&gt; In children with delayed language development, only 50% of maternal speech is matched to the object the infant is focusing on.&lt;ref name=Oates&amp;Grayson/&gt; Infants are more likely to engage in joint attention when the parent talks about an object that the child is attending to as opposed to an object outside of the infant's attention.&lt;ref name=Rollins/&gt; This increased level of joint attention aids in encouraging normal language development, including word comprehension and production.&lt;ref name=Rollins/&gt; When joint attention is present, it plays an important role in [[Vocabulary development|word learning]], a crucial aspect of language development.&lt;ref name=Hirotani&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hirotani | first1 = M. | last2 = Stets | first2 = M. | last3 = Striano | first3 = T. | last4 = Friederic | first4 = A.D. | year = 2009 | title = Joint attention helps infants learn new words: event-related potential evidence | url = | journal = Developmental Neuroscience | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 600–605 | doi = 10.1097/WNR.0b013e32832a0a7c }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relationship to [[Social emotional development|socio-emotional development]]===
Joint attention and the ability to attend to an aspect of one's environment are fundamental to normal [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]] that rely on the sharing of [[experience]] and [[knowledge]].&lt;ref name= "MacPherson"&gt;MacPherson, A. C. &amp; Moore, C. (2007). Attentional control by gaze cues in infancy. In R. Flomm, K. Lee &amp; D. Muir (Eds.), ''Gaze-Following: Its Development and Significance'' (pp. 53–76). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; Infants are highly motivated to share experience. An infant's [[motivation]] to engage in joint attention is strong enough that infants voluntarily turn away from interesting sights to engage in joint attention with others.&lt;ref name="Carpenter"&gt;Carpenter, M. (2011). Social Cognition and Social Motivations in Infancy. In U. Goswami (Eds.), ''The Wiley-Blackwell handbook of childhood cognitive development'' (pp. 106–128). West Sussex, UK: Blackwell Publishing Ltd.{{ISBN|1-4051-9116-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As described in [[attachment theory]], infants need to develop a relationship with a [[primary caregiver]] to achieve normal social and emotional development. A key part of the ability to develop this relationship may be joint attention. In addition to [[language development]], joint attention serves the function of preparing infants for more complex social structures involved in adult conversation. Children's skills in initiating and responding to joint attention predict their social competence at 30 months of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van Hecke | first1 = Amy Vaughan | last2 = Mundy | first2 = Peter C. | last3 = Acra | first3 = C.Franciose | last4 = Block | first4 = Jessica J. | last5 = Delgado | first5 = Christine E.F. | last6 = Parlade | first6 = Meaghan V. | last7 = Myers | first7 = Jessica A. | last8 = Neal | first8 = A.

===Developmental markers in infancy===
At the age of 2 months, children engage in dyadic joint attention and conversation-like exchanges with adults during which each is the focus of the other's attention and they take turns exchanging looks, noises and mouth movements.&lt;ref name= "Goswami"/&gt; At age 3 months, children display joint attention skills by calling to a caregiver when they are not perceivable.&lt;ref name="Reddy"/&gt; When caregiver does not respond in a similar manner, child exhibits a series of responses that were first studied in early 1970s by [[Edward Tronick]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ellen-galinsky/trusting-relationships-ar_b_1123524.html Trusting Relationships Are Central to Children's Learning -- Lessons From Edward Tronick], Huffington Post, 31 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; in collaboration with pediatrician T. Berry Brazelton at the time when the latter was creating the [[Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale]]. At age 6 months, infants display joint attentional skills by:
*Orienting themselves in the same general direction (in their visual field) as another person.&lt;ref name= "Goswami"/&gt; Infants also cease to focus on the first interesting (salient) object they encounter.&lt;ref name= "Goswami"/&gt;
*Following outward directed gaze of adults.&lt;ref name= "Goswami"/&gt;
*Extending more sophisticated behaviors, such as gaze checking, when initial gaze following is not successful.&lt;ref name="Heal2005" /&gt;
*Paying more attention to eyes, responding to shifts in eye gaze direction, and directing their own attention based on another's gaze.&lt;ref name="Woodward"/&gt;

At age 8 months, infants demonstrate joint attention through proto-declarative pointing, particularly in girls.&lt;ref name= "Goswami"&gt;Goswami, Usha (2008)''Cognitive Development: The Learning Brain''. New York, NY:Psychology.&lt;/ref&gt; At 9 months of age, infants begin to display triadic joint attention.&lt;ref name=Oates&amp;Grayson/&gt; Infants also will display joint attention activities, such as communicative gestures, social referencing, and using the behavior of others to guide response to novel things.&lt;ref name= "Goswami"/&gt;

At one year of age, joint attention is displayed through a child's understanding of pointing as an intentional act.&lt;ref name= "Goswami"/&gt; One-year-olds also establish joint attention for objects within their visual field before objects beyond their current visual field. At this age, infants are not yet able to represent their entire environment, only what they can see.&lt;ref name= "Goswami"/&gt; At age 15 months, children [[theory of mind|recognize the minds of others]].&lt;ref name= "Goswami"/&gt; At this age, children also recognize the importance of eyes for seeing and that physical objects can block sight.&lt;ref name="Woodward"/&gt; At age 18 months, infants are capable of following an individual's gaze to outside their visual field and establishing (representative) joint attention.&lt;ref name= "Goswami"/&gt; 18-month-olds also grasp the intentional, referential nature of looking, the [[Mentalism (psychology)|mentalistic]] experience of seeing and the role of eyes&lt;ref name="Woodward"/&gt; and are skilled at following both gaze and pointing with precision.&lt;ref name="Woodward"/&gt; At two years of age, children display joint attention by extending attention beyond the present and understanding that the targets of other's attention extends to the past as well.&lt;ref name="Reddy"/&gt; Two-year-olds are also capable of [[Mental representation|representational thought]] or [[Information processing|increased memory]].&lt;ref name="Reddy"/&gt;

=== Individuals with disabilities ===
Several studies have shown that problems with joint attention are associated with developmental processes.&lt;ref name= Bhat&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bhat | first1 = AN | last2 = Galloway | first2 = JC | last3 = Landa | first3 = RJ | year = | title = Social and non-social visual attention patterns and associative learning in infants at risk for autism | url = | journal = Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry | volume = 51 | issue = 9| pages = 989–997 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2010.02262.x | pmc = 3653974 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Difficulties in establishing joint attention may partially account for differences in social abilities of children with developmental disorders (i.e. [[Autism spectrum|Autism spectrum disorders]]).&lt;ref name= Bhat/&gt; A core deficit noted in [[autism]] is eye gaze.&lt;ref name="Bruinsma"/&gt; Autistic children have difficulty alternating their attention towards a partner and third object.&lt;ref name="Bruinsma"/&gt; This difficulty is attributed to their deficiencies in following gaze, resulting in difficulty initiating and maintaining joint attention.&lt;ref name="Bruinsma"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bruinsma | first1 = Y. | last2 = Koegel | first2 = R. | last3 = Koegel | first3 = L. | year = 2004 | title = Joint attention and children with autism: A review of the literature | url = | journal = Mental Retardation and Development Disabilities | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 169–175 | doi = 10.1002/mrdd.20036 | pmid=15611988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deaf infants are able to engage in joint attention similar to hearing infants; however, the time spent engaged in joint attention is often reduced in deaf infants born to hearing parents.&lt;ref name="Nowakowski"/&gt; Hearing parents of deaf infants often are less likely to respond and expand on their deaf infants' initiative and communicative acts.&lt;ref name="Nowakowski"/&gt; Deaf infants of deaf parents do not show reduced time spent in joint attention.&lt;ref name="Nowakowski"/&gt; Auditory input is not critical to joint attention but similar modes of communication and understanding are vital.&lt;ref name="Nowakowski"/&gt; Furthermore, mothers who are unable to successfully establish regular joint attention with their child rate that infant lower on scales of [[social competence]].&lt;ref name="Nowakowski"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nowakowski | first1 = Matlida E. | last2 = Tasker | first2 = Susan L. | last3 = Schmidt | first3 = Louis A. | year = 2009 | title = Establishment of joint attention in dyads involving hearing mothers of deaf and hearing children and its relation to adaptive social behavior | url = | journal = American Annals of the Deaf | volume = 154 | issue = 1| pages = 15–29 | doi=10.1353/aad.0.0071}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judgement of low social competence can be made as early as 18 months of age.&lt;ref name="Nowakowski"/&gt; In blind infants, joint attention is established by means of auditory input or feeling another person's hand on an object and may be delayed compared to sighted infants.&lt;ref name=Bigelow&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bigelow | first1 = A.

== Other animals ==

=== Definitions in non-human animals ===
Triadic joint attention is the highest level of joint attention and involves two individuals looking at an object.&lt;ref name=Oates&amp;Grayson/&gt; Each individual must understand that the other individual is looking at the same object and realize that there is an element of shared attention.&lt;ref name="Reddy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hobson"/&gt; Triadic attention is marked by the individual looking back to the other individual after looking at the object.&lt;ref name="OkamotoBarth2006" /&gt; Dyadic joint attention involves mutual gaze between the parent and infant.&lt;ref name="OkamotoBarth2006" /&gt; Mutual gaze is marked by both the parent and infant looking at each other's face.&lt;ref name="3OkamotoBarth2006"&gt;Social Cognition Development in First 2 Years. In T. Matsuzawa M. Tomonaga &amp; M. Tanaka (Eds.), ''Cognitive Development in Chimpanzees'' (pp.182-197). Tokyo: Springer-Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt; If two individuals are simply looking at an object, it is referred to as shared gaze.&lt;ref name="OkamotoBarth2006" /&gt;

=== Dyadic joint attention ===
Infant and parent chimpanzees show dyadic joint attention in an affectionate manner by looking at each other's eyes&lt;ref name="2OkamotoBarth2006"&gt;Evolutionary Origins of Mother-Infant Relationship. In T. Matsuzawa M. Tomonaga &amp; M. Tanaka (Eds.), ''Cognitive Development in Chimpanzees'' (pp.127-141). Tokyo: Springer-Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt; Non-human animals such as Japanese monkeys, baboons, and other Old World monkeys seldom engage in dyadic joint attention.&lt;ref name="2OkamotoBarth2006" /&gt; For these animals, the eye contact involved in dyadic joint attention is deemed threatening.&lt;ref name="2OkamotoBarth2006" /&gt;

=== Shared gaze ===
Gaze following, or shared gaze, can be found in a number of [[primate]]s.&lt;ref name="OkamotoBarth2006"/&gt;{{rp|155–71}} Domesticated animals such as dogs and horses also demonstrate shared gaze.&lt;ref name="Ikatura"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Itakura |first1=S. |title=Gaze Following and Joint Visual Attention in Nonhuman Animals |journal=Japanese Psychological Research |year=2004 |pages=216–226 |volume=46 |issue=3 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-5584.2004.00253.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of joint attention is important for animals because gaze shifts serve as indicators alerting the animal to the location of predators, mates, or food.&lt;ref name="OkamotoBarth2006" /&gt;

Chimpanzees are capable of actively locating objects that are the focus of another individual's attention by tracking the gaze of others.&lt;ref name="Tomasello_et_al.&amp;_Emery_et_al."&gt;Tomasello et al. &amp; Emery et al. as cited in (2006).

Tokyo: Springer-Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt; They are not limited to following eye gaze to the first interesting object in their view.&lt;ref name="Tomasello_et_al.&amp;_Emery_et_al."/&gt; They use a number of different cues to engage in shared focus, including head movement and eye gaze.&lt;ref name="OkamotoBarth2006" /&gt; Infant chimpanzees start to follow tap, point, and head turn cues of an experimenter by nine months of age.&lt;ref name="OkamotoBarth2006" /&gt; By 13 months of age, they show following responses to glance cues without a head turn.&lt;ref name="OkamotoBarth2006" /&gt; There is no evidence to support that infant chimpanzees are able to use eye gaze alone as a cue for following responses.&lt;ref name="OkamotoBarth2006" /&gt; By 20 months of age, infant chimpanzees are able to follow an experimenter's cues to a target behind the chimpanzee but infant chimpanzees do not look back to the experimenter after looking at the target.&lt;ref name="OkamotoBarth2006" /&gt; Moving targets are more salient than stationary targets for infant chimpanzees.&lt;ref name="OkamotoBarth2006" /&gt; Chimpanzee infants are sensitive to faces which are gazing at them, but chimpanzees less than three to four years old only look within their visual field when using the experimenter's head turn as their cue.&lt;ref name="OkamotoBarth2006" /&gt;

'''Khayamiya''' (Egyptian Arabic خيّامية Khayyāmiyah) is a type of decorative [[appliqué]] textile historically used to decorate tents across the Middle East. They are now primarily made in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]], along a covered market known as the Street of the Tentmakers (Share'a el Khayamiya, or Souq El-Khaymiya). This street is located immediately south of [[Bab Zuweila]], and has been in continuous use since the [[Mamluk]] era.

==Description==
Khayamiya are elaborately patterned and colourful appliques applied to the interior of tents, serving a dual function of shelter and ornament. They resemble [[quilt]]s, and possess the three layers typical of quilts - a heavy 'back', a background 'top', and elaborate applique over the 'top'. Functionally, they can be compared to [[curtain]]s, though their recent roles have diversified to cater for touristic purposes. These now include cushion covers, fashion, bags, bedspreads, and other applications.

==Design==
[[File:Tent maker in Elkhiyamia street in 2017, photo by Hatem Moushir 1.jpg|thumb|Tentmaker]]
Khayamiya feature hand-stitched [[cotton]] appliqué over a heavy cotton back. This back is intended to be protective and durable against a hot, dry, and dusty climate. The hand-stitching is performed quickly by skilled tentmakers while seated cross-legged, using needles and thread. Small pieces of fabric are cut to size as they are required using large scissors. Khayamiya are usually completed by a single tentmaker regardless of the size of the piece. These can range from basic cushion covers to intricate whole-wall hangings several metres across. Large projects can subsequently take several months to complete. The tentmakers are very protective of their creative innovations, as successful new designs are often copied by their competitive neighbours.

Popular design motifs include geometric and curvilinear arabesque patterns derived from Islamic ornaments, and scenes inspired by Pharaonic art, especially [[papyrus]] and [[lotus (plant)|lotus]] motifs. [[Egypt]]ian folkloric subjects such as [[The miller, his son and the donkey|Goha]], Nubian musicians, and the whirling dervishes are popular touristic [[souvenirs]], as are stylised depictions of fish and birds. Calligraphic patterns, based upon texts from the [[Qur’an]], are often shaped into objects and animals. Khedival panels made in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century typically feature larger blocks of appliqué and wider stitching, though touristic and contemporary khayamiya feature finer and more elaborate handwork.

==Terminology==
The correct spelling is in Arabic, but English approximations of this term are diverse, including Khiamiah, Khiyamiya, Khiamiyya, Khyamiyya, Kheyyemiah, Kheyameya, and Khayyāmia. The Arabic word ''Khayma'' (خيمة), meaning 'tent', is also linked to the Persian خیام Khayyām (which also means 'Tentmaker'). Popular alternative descriptions in English include the 'work of the Tentmakers of Cairo', 'Tentmaker applique' or simply 'Egyptian applique'. Medhat Adel Emam has discussed the origin of the term as it applies to distinctly Egyptian Arabic with Turkish influences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/tradition-vsmodernism-street-tentmakers] Ahmed Ramadan, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Very large decorated 'pavilions' in Khayamiya are known as ''suradeq''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/198606/tentmakers.of.cairo.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historic Khayamiya==
Historic specimens of khayamiya are rare. They were originally made to be placed outside in dry heat and dust, and were regarded as replaceable - hence not highly valued for collection or preservation.

Despite their historic legacy, the 'tentmaker' occupation is now endangered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/tradition-vsmodernism-street-tentmakers|title=Tradition vs.modernism in the street of the tentmakers - Egypt Independent|date=2010-08-21|work=Egypt Independent|access-date=2018-10-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/streets-cairo-tent-making-and-endangered-crafts-around-khayamiya|title=Streets of Cairo: Tent-making and endangered crafts around Khayamiya - Egypt Independent|date=2011-08-13|work=Egypt Independent|access-date=2018-10-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is largely due to competition from imported mass-printed fabrics bearing similar decorative patterns. These printed sheets are now widely used across Egypt as temporary screens for special events, notably during Ramadan, festivals, weddings, and funerals, in place of the original handmade Khayamiya. The majority of Khayamiya created in recent years are marketed to tourists visiting Egypt. In the 2000s, the first international exhibitions of Egyptian khayamiya were held in Australia, the UK, France, and the USA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quiltviews.com/beautiful-quilts-from-the-tentmakers-of-cairo-exhibit] 'Stitch like an Egyptian', exhibition for the [[American Quilt Society]] in Grand Rapids, Michigan, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; These were curated by Jenny Bowker, an Australian quiltmaker and teacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jennybowker.com/tentmakers/|title=Jenny Bowker - quiltmaker and textile artist - Tentmakers|website=www.jennybowker.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Khayamiya in Contemporary Art==
The Egyptian artist Moataz Nasr features Khayamiya-inspired aspects in his contemporary mixed-media artwork.&lt;ref&gt;http://arttattler.com/archivemoataznasr.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Susan Hefuna's installation "I Love Egypt!" (featured in the 18th Biennale of Sydney in 2012) also applies Khayamiya within the context of contemporary installation art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://universes.art/nafas/articles/2011/susan_hefuna/|title=Susan Hefuna - "I Love Egypt!"|website=universes.art|language=en-EN|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2009, the Egyptian artist Hani el-Masri collaborated with the Tentmakers to produce a 5m x 8m interpretation of the [[One Thousand and One Nights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hanielmasri.com/tapestry/web-content/index.html|title=Egyptian Tapestry  ǀ  Hani El-Masri|website=www.hanielmasri.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Algerian artist [[Rachid Koraïchi]] has also collaborated with the Tentmakers of Cairo to create large calligraphic banners, such as his [http://www.octobergallery.co.uk/art/koraichi/the_invisible_masters.shtml Invisible Masters] series. As Koraïchi stated in 2011:

:"When we talk about an Islamic craft tradition, we're not talking about the art of the 19th century that took place in an artist's studio and on canvas. Here we're talking about things that come out of everyday life... It's not a world in which the artist lives apart."
:The culture of the artisan - still present, but steadily disappearing in the streets of Koraichi's native Algeria and surrounding Maghreb countries - offers an insight into how art can be drawn directly from a day-to-day world, yet heightened by the dedication of craft. "If you look at the foundations of western art," Koraichi continued, "it was based on a whole tradition of craft that went into churches; the goblets made by metalworkers and the marbling. It's exactly the same with mosques, in that they were built by those who could work with stone and weaving. These are sources that we can clearly see but the question we have is how to take those disappearing traditions and make them present again in the living moment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/art/rachid-koraichi-a-mystical-winner-of-the-jameel-prize-1.571073#ixzz2CQ630V2i|title=Rachid Koraichi: a mystical winner of the Jameel Prize|work=The National|access-date=2018-10-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tentmaker's Street is not known for the hard-sell hassles associated with touristic shopping in the [[Khan el-Khalili]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2010/sep/14/souks-middle-east-readers-tips|title=Readers' tips to souks|last=|first=|date=2010-09-14|website=The Guardian|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Styles==
There are four main forms of Khayamiya - Khedival, Touristic, Street, and Contemporary.

*[[Khedival]] khayamiya were made between 1867 and 1914. These are usually large appliqued panels in indigo, red, and white on beige canvas, often featuring with vertical blue stripes.
*[[Touristic]] khayamiya were made from the 1890s through to the present day, and were notably popular after 1922. These are smaller and figurative appliques, usually featuring motifs from ancient Egypt or modern Egyptian scenes. They were globally distributed by international travelers as popular Egyptian souvenirs. 
*[[Street]] khayamiya include panels made for outdoor use within Egypt, such as suradeq pavilions or backdrops for public events. These are architectural textiles.
*[[Contemporary]] khayamiya are applique panels made for indoor use.

Contemporary khaymiya can be divided into the following sub-genres:

*[[Arabesque (Islamic art)|Arabesque]] Khayamiya, consisting of elaborate interlinked patterns. This genre dominates this contemporary art form.
*Folkloric Khayamiya, such as the legends of [[The miller, his son and the donkey|Goha]].
*[[Orientalism|Orientalist]] Khayamiya, such as street scenes based on [[Printmaking|prints]] by [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]], or their actual equivalents located in Cairo.
* Bird Khayamiya, often associated with the [[tree of life]], the [[Garden of Eden]], or Pharaonic [[tomb painting]]
* Musicians performing traditional Egyptian or [[Nubian people|Nubian]] [[musical instruments]] and dances.
* [[Calligraphy]] usually based on the Qur'an.
* Pharaonic designs based on papyrus texts from the [[Book of the Dead]] and other ancient Egyptian art.
*[[Commission (art)|Commission]]ed including unique pieces made at the request of artists, designers, curators, and publishers.
*Neo-Khedival panels inspired by the historic appliques of the Khedival period (1867-1914). These started to emerge after 2014, following the publication of Khedival khayamiya in textile journals.

Many of the Presidents of Chile have borne arms; largely via being part of the foreign Orders of Chivalry such as the Spanish [[Order of Isabella the Catholic]] and [[Order of Charles III]], and the Danish [[Order of the Elephant]], and the Swedish [[Order of the Seraphim]].

'''''Mercury Rising''''' is a 1998 American [[political film|political]] [[action film|action]] [[thriller film]] starring [[Bruce Willis]] and [[Alec Baldwin]]. Directed by [[Harold Becker]], the movie is based on [[Ryne Douglas Pearson]]'s 1996 novel originally published as [[Simple Simon (novel)|''Simple Simon'']]. Willis plays Art Jeffries, an [[undercover]] [[FBI]] agent who protects a 9-year-old [[autism|autistic]] boy who is targeted by government [[Assassination|assassins]] after he cracks a [[top secret]] government code.

The film was released on April 3, 1998. It received mostly negative reviews.

==Plot==
{{Long plot|date=December 2017}} 
A [[Code (cryptography)|cryptographic code]] called "Mercury" was created by the [[National Security Agency]] and is allegedly so complex that its creators believe no computer on Earth can decipher it. Originally it was created during the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan Administration]] as a test to keep the United States' highest priority secrets under wraps. One day, the NSA receives a message from a nine-year-old [[autistic savant]] with [[child prodigy|prodigious]] [[mental calculator|math abilities]] named Simon Lynch ([[Miko Hughes]]), who calls a telephone number written in the code which was secretly published in a puzzle magazine by two of the creators, Dean Crandell ([[Robert Stanton (actor)|Robert Stanton]]) and Leo Pedranski ([[Bodhi Elfman]]), to see if anyone could break it. Crandell and Pedranski's division chief, Lt. Colonel Nicholas Kudrow ([[Alec Baldwin]]) sees the boy's ability to decipher the code as a grave liability.  He dispatches assassin Peter Burrell ([[Lindsey Ginter|Lindsey Lee Ginter]]) to murder the boy and his parents, Martin ([[John Carroll Lynch]]) and Jenny (Kelley Hazen).

After shooting Martin and Jenny, Burrell searches the house, fails to find Simon, and leaves at the sound of approaching sirens (Martin was able to call 911 before dying). FBI Agent Art Jeffries ([[Bruce Willis]]), demoted following a diagnosis of delusional paranoia after blaming himself for the death of a teenager in a hostage situation gone wrong, is sent to investigate what is initially thought to be a murder-suicide. While investigating the scene, Jeffries finds Simon hiding in a cache of his bedroom closet and takes the boy under his wing. Jeffries begins to realize the difficulty of protecting, let alone questioning, Simon because of his impaired social abilities as a result of his [[autism]], but the [[Chicago Police Department]] agree to assign a protection detail to Simon. Burrell tries to kill Simon again at the hospital, but Jeffries stops him. He is then forced to terminate an assassin named Shayes ([[Peter Stormare]]) on the [[Chicago 'L']] train. The situation is further complicated by the fact that nobody at the FBI believes Simon is in any danger, and Jeffries is soon framed by the NSA as a kidnapper, with only his best friend and fellow agent Tommy Jordan ([[Chi McBride]]) aware that he did not commit the crime, since Jordan had been in contact with Jeffries when the incident began. Jeffries borrows Jordan's car (which Jordan later reports stolen to conceal his involvement) and takes Simon back to his house. Simon again calls the telephone number written in the code and talks to Crandell and Pedranski. When Jeffries confronts them, a conflicted Crandell arranges a meeting via encoded e-mail at the [[Wrigley Building]]. The next morning, Jeffries meets a woman named Stacey Siebring ([[Kim Dickens]]) in a coffee shop and asks her to watch Simon for him.

Jeffries meets Crandell and the two talk and stroll on a busy sidewalk. Crandell tells Jeffries about "Mercury" and Kudrow, then Burrell shoots him from behind and gets away safely. Jeffries returns to the coffee shop, but Simon and Stacey are gone. He goes outside and spots them coming across the street. Stacey says she and Simon have become friends and Simon agrees. Jeffries and Simon then abruptly leave Stacey. Later in the middle of the night, Jeffries and Simon go to Stacey's house, asking for a place to stay. Stacey reluctantly agrees and tells Jeffries that she was going on a business trip to [[Des Moines]] to make the rent the next morning.

Meanwhile, Pedranski, having learned Crandell's fate, picks up where his friend left off by writing a pair of letters via typewriter: one to Jeffries and the other to the [[United_States_congressional_hearing#Oversight_hearings|Senate Oversight Committee]], revealing Kudrow's unlawful actions. Soon after, Pedranski is murdered by Burrell, who also snatches the letters. However, the assassin neglects to grab the carbon copies Pedranski tossed, which his girlfriend, NSA analyst Emily Lang ([[Carrie Preston]]), takes to the FBI. Jordan discreetly arranges for her to meet with Jeffries to show them both the [[carbon paper]] used to type the letter, which, being covered in Pedranski's fingerprints, is crucial evidence in its own right. After the meeting with Emily, Jeffries tells Stacey to call anyone for an emergency except the police, who were called off at the last minute, and gives her Jordan's number in case of an emergency. While Jeffries introduces himself to Kudrow at his birthday party and demands that Kudrow leave Simon alone, Jordan, under Jeffries' suggestion, arranges for Simon to go into Witness Protection. After the meeting, Jeffries calls Jordan, who explains that the Witness Protection meeting is going to happen, though they are unaware that their [[Telephone tapping|conversation is being monitored]] by Kudrow. When Jeffries returns and finds Stacey and Simon gone, he learns from Jordan that they are not in any danger and will meet them there, just as Jordan is given an order to head to the FBI director's office.

Kudrow tries to have FBI SAC (Special Agent in Charge) Joe Lomax ([[Kevin Conway (actor)|Kevin Conway]]) help turn the tables on Jeffries by using his authority and the fact that Jordan arranged the Witness Protection under false pretenses. He plans to have the NSA take over the protection for the meeting location. After Kudrow leaves, Jordan shows the evidence to Lomax and despite his initial doubts, Jordan confirms that the fingerprint markings on it were Pedranski's, now fully validating the evidence against Kudrow. Jeffries, with Jordan and a small FBI task force's help, sets a trap at the meeting spot. During the battle, Jordan protects Stacey, and the FBI team takes on Burrell, who is killed, trying to escape, when the windows blow out slashing his face open. Jeffries and Kudrow fight on the roof during which Simon walks to the edge of the roof and grabs Kudrow's gun, giving it to Jeffries and allowing him to take control as Jordan and the team come in. In a last-ditch effort to get his victim back, Kudrow grabs Simon, is shot at point blank range by Jeffries, and subsequently falls to his death over the edge of the building.

Jeffries later visits Simon (now living with foster parents) at his school. He embraces the FBI agent as a welcome friend, having finally accepted him as a person he trusts.

==Reception==
Bruce Willis received the 1999 [[Golden Raspberry Award]] as Worst Actor for his performance (as well as for ''[[Armageddon (1998 film)|Armageddon]]'' and ''[[The Siege]]'').{{cn|date=August 2018}} 
Miko Hughes won the category of ''Best Performance in a Feature Film—Leading Young Actor'' at the 1999 [[Young Artist Award]]s for his portrayal of Simon.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

On [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has a score of 17% based on reviews from 35 critics with an average rating of  4.2/10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mercury_rising/|title=''Mercury Rising''|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=December 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="CinemaScore"&gt; {{cite web |url=https://m.cinemascore.com |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film two stars out of four, writing: "''Mercury Rising'' is about the most sophisticated cryptographic system known to man, and about characters considerably denser than anyone in the audience. Sitting in the dark, our minds idly playing with the plot, we figure out what they should do, how they should do it, and why they should do it, while the characters on the screen strain helplessly against the requirements of the formula."&lt;ref&gt;[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19980403/REVIEWS/804030303/1023 ''Mercury Rising'' :: rogerebert.com :: Reviews]&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Berardinelli]] rated it one and a half out of four stars, saying: "The script for ''Mercury Rising'' is exceptionally tiresome and hard-to-swallow. ... Once again, certain standby plot elements -- the high-level government conspiracy and the maverick law enforcement agent -- are recycled, and not to good effect. While Bruce Willis can play the action hero as well as anyone in Hollywood, this particular outing leaves him marooned in situations that are characterized by too little tension and too much nonsense."&lt;ref&gt;[http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/m/mercury.html Mercury Rising - A Film Review by James Berardinelli]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Box office===
The film earned $10,104,715 in its opening weekend in 2,386 theaters. Altogether, the film grossed $32,935,289 in the United States and $60,172,000 internationally for a total of $93,107,289.&lt;ref name="BOM"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1416">The '''Movement Action Plan''' is a strategic [[Conceptual model|model]] for waging nonviolent [[social movement]]s developed by [[William Moyer|Bill Moyer]], a US [[social change]] [[Activism|activist]]. The MAP, initially developed by Moyer in the late 1970s, uses [[Case study|case studies]] of successful social movements to illustrate eight distinct stages through social movements' progress, and is designed to help movement activists choose the most effective [[Military tactics|tactics]] and [[Strategy|strategies]] to match their movements' current stage.

==The eight stages==
Moyer describes the eight stages as:
* Critical social problem exists
* Prove failure of official institutions
* Ripening conditions
* Take off
* Perception of failure 
* Majority public opinion
* Success
* Continuation

Use of such materials may be limited to specific patron groups, especially in private academic institutions.  Music library print collections include dictionaries and encyclopedias, indexes and directories, [[Sheet music|printed music]], music serials, bibliographies, and other music literature.

==Types==
Traditionally, there are four types of '''music libraries''':

#Those developed to support departments of music in university or college settings;
#Those developed to support conservatories and schools of music;
#Those housed within public libraries;
#Those developed as independent libraries or archives supporting music organizations.

==Musical instrument library==
A musical instrument library lends or shares [[musical instruments]]. Examples can be found in [[Canada]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://joesmill.wordpress.com/ |title=Joe's M.I.L.L. |author= |location=Kingston, Ontario, Canada |accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/programs/metromorning/musical-library-1.3524976 |title=Toronto Public Library creates city's 1st musical instrument lending program |work=CBC |date=7 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Perth, Australia]];&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.instrumentlenders.com Instrument Lenders Canada] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611084125/http://instrumentlenders.com/ |date=2013-06-11 }} ... an instrument lending library, situated in Perth County, which supplies instruments mainly to youth at no cost for up to 6 months." {{citation |title=Voices of Youth |author=Perth County Social Research and Planning Council |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Massachusetts]],&lt;ref&gt;"[http://themusary.com/ The Musary], a Hamilton-based nonprofit "lending library" of musical instruments." {{citation |title=Sharing the music: in honor of a late Hamilton resident, lending library brings instruments to students at the Beverly School for the Deaf |author=James Sullivan |date= 15 Dec 2011 |work=Boston Globe }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The South Shore Folk Music Club of Kingston, Massachusetts, maintains an instrument lending library. {{citation |title=For club, it's been 20 years strumming |author=Judith Montminy |date=27 Sep 1998 |work=Boston Globe }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://bark.cwmars.org/eg/opac/record/2715816 |author=Sheffield Bushnell-Sage Library |title=Ukulele |publisher=CW/MARS |location=Massachusetts |accessdate=Oct 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Illinois,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oddmusicuc.wordpress.com/instrumentarium-catalogue/ |title=Oddmusic Instrumentarium |location=Urbana-Champaign, Illinois, US |accessdate=3 May 2012|date=2010-03-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ohio,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.libraryasincubatorproject.org/?p=15789 |title=Guitar Lending Collection at Licking County Library |date= December 2014 |work=Library as Incubator Project |location=USA }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Washington (state)|Washington]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/08/us/breaking-out-of-the-library-mold-in-boston-and-beyond.html |title=Breaking Out of the Library Mold, in Boston and Beyond |date=March 7, 2014 |accessdate=March 8, 2014 |newspaper=New York Times |last1=Seelye |first1=Katharine Q. }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [http://rootnotemusicshop.com/instrumentlibrary/ New Paltz, New York]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hudsonvalleyone.com/2016/09/08/music-for-the-masses-the-new-paltz-instrument-library/|title=Music for the masses: The New Paltz instrument library|last=Ward|first=Terence P.|website=Hudson Valley One|access-date=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the United States.

A '''nation''' is a stable [[community]] of people, formed on the basis of a common language, territory, economic life, ethnicity, or psychological make-up manifested in a common [[culture]]. A nation is distinct from a [[people]],&lt;ref name="black"/&gt; and is more abstract, and more overtly political, than an [[ethnic group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = James | first = Paul |authorlink = Paul James (academic) | title = Nation Formation: Towards a Theory of Abstract Community | url = https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0761950737 | publisher= Sage Publications | location = London | year= 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a cultural-political community that has become conscious of its autonomy, unity, and particular interests.&lt;ref name="Smith1991"&gt;{{cite book|author= Anthony D.

''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'' defines a nation as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''nation''', ''n.'' (14c) '''1.''' A large group of people having a common origin, language, and tradition and usu. constituting a political entity. • When a nation is coincident with a state, the term ''nation-state'' is often used....
&lt;P&gt;...&lt;/P&gt;

[[Ernest Renan]]'s ''[[What is a Nation?]]'' (1882) declares that "race is confused with nation and a sovereignty analogous to that of really existing peoples is attributed to ethnographic or, rather linguistic groups", and "[t]he truth is that there is no pure race and that to make politics depend upon ethnographic analysis is to surrender it to a chimera", echoing a sentiment of [[civic nationalism]]. He also claims that a nation does not form on the basis of [[dynasty]], [[language]], [[religion]], [[geography]], or [[National interest|shared interests]]. Rather, "[a] nation is a soul, a spiritual principle. Two things, which in truth are but one, constitute this soul or spiritual principle. One lies in the past, one in the present. One is the possession in common of a rich legacy of memories; the other is present-day consent, the desire to live together, the will to perpetuate the value of the heritage that one has received in an undivided form", emphasizing the [[Democracy| democratic]] and [[History| historical]] aspects of what constitutes a nation, although, "[f]orgetting, I would even go so far as to say historical error, is a crucial factor in the [[creation (disambiguation) | creation]] of a nation". "A nation is therefore a large-scale solidarity", which Renan says is reaffirmed in a "daily [[Referendum |plebiscite]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.cooper.edu/humanities/core/hss3/e_renan.html |title= What is a Nation? |last= Renan |first= Ernest |website= web.archive.org |publisher= Internet Wayback Machine |accessdate= 27 March 2017 |deadurl= bot: unknown |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110827065548/http://www.cooper.edu/humanities/core/hss3/e_renan.html |archivedate= 27 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is an abstract community in the sense that it is objectively impersonal, even if each individual in the nation experiences him or herself as subjectively part of an embodied unity with others. For the most part, members of a nation remain strangers to each other and will likely never  meet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= James | first= Paul |authorlink= Paul James (academic) |title= Globalism, Nationalism, Tribalism: Bringing Theory Back In |url= https://www.academia.edu/1642214/Globalism_Nationalism_Tribalism_Bringing_Theory_Back_In_author_Sage_Publications_London_2006 |date= 2006 | publisher= Sage Publications |location= London }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the phrase, "a nation of strangers" used by such writers as [[Vance Packard]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Etymology and terminology==
The word ''nation'' came from the [[Old French]] word ''nacion'' – meaning "birth" (''naissance''), "place of origin" -, which in turn originates from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''[[wikt:Special:Search/natio|natio]]'' (''nātĭō'') literally meaning "birth".&lt;ref name="etymonline"&gt;{{cite web |last=Harper |first=Douglas |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=nation |title=Nation |work=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=5 June 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "nation" is sometimes used as synonym for:
* [[State (polity)]] or [[sovereign state]]: a government which controls a specific territory, which may or may not be associated with any particular ethnic group
* [[Country]]: a geographic territory, which may or may not have an affiliation with a government or ethnic group

Thus the phrase "nations of the world" could be referring to the top-level governments (as in the name for the [[United Nations]]), various large geographical territories, or various large ethnic groups of the planet.

Depending on the meaning of "nation" used, the term "[[nation state]]" could be used to distinguish larger states from small [[city state]]s, or could be used to distinguish [[multinational state]]s from those with a single ethnic group.

==Medieval nations==
In her book ''Kingdoms and Communities in Western Europe 900–1300'', [[Susan Reynolds]] argues that many European medieval kingdoms were nations in the modern sense except that political participation in nationalism was available only to a limited prosperous and literate class.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Reynolds, Kingdoms and Communities in Western Europe 900–1300, Oxford, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''The Construction of Nationhood: Ethnicity, Religion and Nationalism'', [[Adrian Hastings]] argues that England's Anglo Saxon kings mobilized mass nationalism in their struggle to repel Norse invasions. Hastings argues that [[Alfred the Great]], in particular, drew on [[biblical nationalism]], using biblical language in his law code and that during his reign selected books of the Bible were translated into [[Old English]] to inspire Englishmen to fight to turn back the Norse invaders. Hastings argues for a strong renewal of English nationalism (following a hiatus after the [[Norman conquest]]) beginning with the [[Wycliffe's Bible|translation of the complete bible into English by the Wycliffe circle in the 1380s]], arguing that [[English nationalism]] and the English nation have been continuous since that time.&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Hastings, The Construction of Nationhood: Ethnicity, Religion and Nationalism. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Another prudent example of Medieval nationalism is the [[Declaration of Arbroath]], a document produced by Scottish nobles and clergy during the [[Scottish Wars of Independence]]. The purpose of the document was to demonstrate to the Pope that Scotland was indeed a nation of its own, with its own unique culture, history and language and that it was indeed an older nation than England. The document went on to justify the actions of [[Robert the Bruce]] and his forces in resisting the occupation and to chastise the English for having violated Scottish sovereignty without justification. The propaganda campaign supplemented a military campaign on the part of the Bruce, which after the [[Battle of Bannockburn]] was successful and eventually resulted in the end of England's occupation and recognition of Scottish independence on the part of the English crown. The document is widely seen as an early example of both [[Scottish nationalism]] and [[popular sovereignty]].

[[Anthony Kaldellis]] affirms in ''Hellenism in Byzantium'' (2008) that what is called the [[Byzantine Empire]] was the Roman Empire transformed into a [[nation-state]] in Middle Ages.

Azar Gat is among the scholars who argue that [[China]], [[Korea]] and [[Japan]] were nations by the time of the European Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Azar Gat, ''Nations: The Long History and Deep Roots of Political Ethnicity and Nationalism'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. 2013, China, p. 93 Korea, p. 104 and Japan p., 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use of term ''nationes'' by medieval universities and other medieval institutions===
{{main article| Nation (university)}}
A significant early use of the term ''nation'', as ''natio'', occurred at [[Medieval university|Medieval universities]]&lt;ref&gt;''see: [[nation (university)]]''&lt;/ref&gt; to describe the colleagues in a college or students, above all at the [[University of Paris]], who were all born within a ''pays'', spoke the same language and expected to be ruled by their own familiar law. In 1383 and 1384, while studying theology at Paris, [[Jean Gerson]] was elected twice as a procurator for the French ''natio''. The [[Charles University in Prague|University of Prague]] adopted the division of students into ''nationes'': from its opening in 1349 the ''[[studium generale]]'' which consisted of Bohemian, Bavarian, Saxon and Silesian ''nations''.

In a similar way, the ''nationes'' were segregated by the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights Hospitaller of Jerusalem]], who maintained at [[Rhodes]] the hostels from which they took their name "where foreigners eat and have their places of meeting, each nation apart from the others, and a Knight has charge of each one of these hostels, and provides for the necessities of the inmates according to their religion", as the Spanish traveller [[Pedro Tafur]] noted in 1436.&lt;ref&gt;Pedro Tafur, ''[http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/texts/tafur.html#ch5 Andanças e viajes]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early modern nations==
{{See also|Nation state}}
In his article, "The Mosaic Moment: An Early Modernist Critique of the Modernist Theory of Nationalism", [[Philip S. Gorski]] argues that the first modern nation was the [[Dutch Republic]], created by a fully modern political nationalism rooted in the model of [[biblical nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Philip S. Gorski, "The Mosaic Moment: An Early Modernist Critique of the Modernist Theory of Nationalism", American Journal of Sociology 105:5 (2000), pp. 1428–68.[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3003771?uid=3739256&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21103778558453]&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2013 article "Biblical nationalism and the sixteenth-century states", [[Diana Muir|Diana Muir Appelbaum]] expands Gorski's argument to apply to a series of new, Protestant, sixteenth-century nation states.&lt;ref&gt;Diana Muir Appelbaum, Biblical nationalism and the sixteenth-century states, ''National Identities'', 2013, [https://www.academia.edu/4879193/Biblical_Nationalism_and_the_Sixteenth_Century_States]&lt;/ref&gt; A similar, albeit broader, argument was made by [[Anthony D. Smith]] in his books, ''Chosen Peoples: Sacred Sources of National Identity'' and ''Myths and Memories of the Nation''.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony D. Smith, Chosen Peoples: Sacred Sources of National Identity (Oxford University Press, 2003) and Myths and Memories of the Nation (Oxford University Press, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In her book ''Nationalism: Five Roads to Modernity'', [[Liah Greenfeld]] argued that nationalism was invented in England by 1600. According to Greenfeld, England was “the first nation in the world".&lt;ref&gt;Steven Guilbert, The Making of English National Identity, http://www.cercles.com/review/R12/kumar7.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Liah Greenfeld, Nationalism: Five Roads to Modernity, Harvard University Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social science==
In the late 20th century, many social scientists argued that there were two types of nations, the [[civic nation]] of which France was the principal example and the [[ethnic nationalism|ethnic nation]] exemplified by the German peoples. The German tradition was conceptualized as originating with early 19th-century philosophers, like [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], and referred to people sharing a common language, religion, culture, history, and [[ethnic origins]], that differentiate them from people of other nations.&lt;ref name=Noiriel&gt;{{cite book|last=Noiriel|first=Gérard|title=Population, immigration et identité nationale en France:XIX-XX siècle.|date=1992|publisher=Hachette|isbn=2010166779}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the civic nation was traced to the [[French Revolution]] and ideas deriving from 18th-century French philosophers. It was understood as being centered in a willingness to "live together", this producing a nation that results from an act of affirmation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rogers Brubaker]], Citizenship and nationhood in France and Germany, Harvard University Press, 1992, {{ISBN|978-0-674-13178-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the vision, among others, of [[Ernest Renan]].&lt;ref name=Noiriel /&gt;

Present day analysis tend to be based in socio-historical studies about the building of [[national identity]] sentiments, trying to identify the individual and collective mechanisms, either conscient or non-conscient, intended or un-intended. According to some of these studies, it seems that the [[State (polity)|State]] often plays a significant role, and communications, particularly of economic content, also have a high significance.&lt;ref name=Noiriel /&gt;

==Debate about a potential future of nations==
{{See also|Clash of Civilizations|City-state|Virtual community|Tribe (Internet)|Global citizenship|Geographic mobility|Transnationalism|Geo-fence|Decentralization|Collective problem solving|Sociocultural evolution}}
There is an ongoing debate about the future of nations − about whether this framework will persist as is and whether there are viable or developing alternatives.&lt;ref name=news&gt;{{cite web|title=End of nations: Is there an alternative to countries?|url=http://mpc-journal.org/blog/2016/11/09/end-of-nations-is-there-an-alternative-to-countries/|publisher=New Scientist|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of the [[clash of civilizations]] lies in direct contrast to [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] theories about an ever more-connected world that no longer requires nation states. According to [[political scientist]] [[Samuel P. Huntington]], people's cultural and religious [[Identity (social science)|identities]] will be the primary source of conflict in the post–[[Cold War]] world.

The theory was originally formulated in a 1992 lecture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aei.org/issue/29196 |title=U.S. Trade Policy&amp;nbsp;— Economics |publisher=AEI |date=15 February 2007 |accessdate=20 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629170348/http://www.aei.org/issue/29196 |archivedate=29 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[American Enterprise Institute]], which was then developed in a 1993 ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' article titled "The Clash of Civilizations?",&lt;ref name="FAarticle"&gt;Official copy (free preview): {{cite web|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19930601faessay5188/samuel-p-huntington/the-clash-of-civilizations.html|title=The Clash of Civilizations?|work=[[Foreign Affairs]]|date=Summer 1993|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629022856/http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19930601faessay5188/samuel-p-huntington/the-clash-of-civilizations.html|archivedate=29 June 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; in response to [[Francis Fukuyama]]'s 1992 book, ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]''. Huntington later expanded his [[thesis]] in a 1996 book ''The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order''.

Huntington began his thinking by surveying the diverse theories about the nature of global politics in the post–[[Cold War]] period. Some theorists and writers argued that [[human rights]], [[liberal democracy]] and capitalist [[free market]] economics had become the only remaining ideological alternative for nations in the post–Cold War world. Specifically, [[Francis Fukuyama]], in ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]'', argued that the world had reached a [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegelian]] "end of history".

Huntington believed that while the age of [[ideology]] had ended, the world had reverted only to a normal state of affairs characterized by cultural conflict. In his thesis, he argued that the primary axis of conflict in the future will be along cultural and religious lines.
[[Postnationalism]] is the process or trend by which nation states and national identities lose their importance relative to supranational and global entities. Several factors contribute to its aspects including [[economic globalization]], a rise in importance of [[multinational corporation]]s, the internationalization of financial markets, the transfer of [[socio-political power]] from national authorities to supernational entities, such as multinational corporations, the [[United Nations]] and the [[European Union]] and the advent of new information and culture technologies such as the [[Internet]]. However attachment to citizenship and [[national identities]] often remains important.&lt;ref&gt;R. Koopmans and P. Statham; "Challenging the liberal nation-state? Postnationalism, multiculturalism, and the collective claims making of migrants and ethnic minorities in Britain and Germany"; ''American Journal of Sociology'' 105:652–96 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.A.

Jan Zielonka of the University of Oxford states that "the future structure and exercise of political power will resemble the medieval model more than the Westphalian one" with the latter being about "concentration of power, sovereignty and clear-cut identity" and [[neo-medievalism]] meaining "overlapping authorities, divided sovereignty, multiple identities and governing institutions, and fuzzy borders".&lt;ref name=news/&gt;

'''Omphalion''' in Greek means "navel (of the earth)"; compare the ''[[omphalos]]'' of [[Delphi]].

==Hagia Sophia==
[[File:Omphalion ste-sophie istanbul 15 oct 2011.jpg|thumb|right|Omphalion at the [[Hagia Sophia]] (2011)]]
One of the most intriguing features of [[Hagia Sophia|St. Sophia]] is a marble section of the floor known as the Omphalos. The Omphalos is located in the south-east quarter of the main square beneath the dome, exactly in the middle of the square. Each side measures 5.65 meters (18.5 feet). Within the square lay 30 circles of various sizes. There is one large circle in the middle; 4 circles of equal size at each corner; 2 smaller circles of similar size occupy the space between each corner circle; 16 smaller circles in-between these. The 3 remaining circles are on the south end and are linked to the 4 larger circles on that end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pedone|first1=Silvia|title=The Marble Omphalos of Saint Sophia in Constantinople|date=2011|page=751}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The most striking feature of the Omphalos is the brilliant [[marble]], with a myriad of types and colors mixed in. Marble was the material of choice for Imperial churches. Strangely, it was believed to be created by earthy matter freezing in water that had sunk into the Earth's crust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barry|first1=Fabio|title=Walking on Water: Cosmic Floors in Antiquity and the Middle Ages|journal=The Art Bulletin|date=Dec 2007|volume=89|issue=4|url=https://search.proquest.com/artshumanities/docview/222978706/B6040F5BF77A497BPQ/7|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design is unusual and has been interpreted in many ways over the years. One interpretation could be that is that the central circle could be the sun, with the solar system orbiting around it. This would fit with the absolute rule of the Emperor. The asymmetry is particularly odd, given when compared to the omphalos at [[Hosios Loukas]] in Greece. This omphalos dates from the Middle Byzantine, some five hundred years after the St. Sophia's if it is indeed an original feature, and is completely symmetrical in design. Stylistically, the interiors of Hagia Sophia have been categorized as a "jeweled style".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schibille|first1=Nadine|title=Hagia Sophia and the Byzantine Aesthetic Experience|date=2014-11-28|publisher=Taylor and Francis|isbn=9781472447951|page=98|url=https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/psu/detail.action?docID=1808795|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The materials utilized were selected to retain and reflect light. The mosaics used [[Tessera|tesserae]] of varying colors, texturized and oriented to reflect the light pouring in from the massive dome. Color was very important as certain colors, and certain materials, conveyed messages of status and prestige. The effect of the sunlight shining through the windows surrounding the base of the dome hitting the tesserae would have been awe-inspiring. Comparatively, the Omphalos is more demure and understated.

Historically, it was thought to mark the spot where Byzantine emperors were crowned during the [[coronation]] ceremony. Evidence of this comes from [[Anthony of Novgorod|Antony of Novgorod]], who wrote a description of St. Sophia in the early 13th century. He wrote "there is a red marble stone with a golden throne placed on it. On this throne the emperors were crowned".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pedone|first1=Silvia|title=The Marble Omphalos of Saint Sophia in Constantinople|date=2011|page=753}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view has been challenged over the years because of the dearth of textual reference from writers and travelers in the Byzantine Era. Hagia Sophia herself has been altered so many times since the sixth-century that the Omphalion disappears and re-appears sporadically in the textual evidence that does exist. We know that it was covered over with carpets by the Ottomans after they converted it into a mosque. The design is unique to Hagia Sophia, with little in the way of direct comparisons. There are two examples from the 11th and 12th centuries, [[Hosios Loukas|Hosios Lukas]] and [[Nea Moni of Chios|Nea Moni]]. The comparison is difficult considering the 500 year difference. All of the marble used in the floors of St. Sophia was quarried around the time of construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schibille|first1=Nadine|title=Hagia Sophia and the Byzantine Aesthetic Experience|date=2014-11-28|publisher=Taylor and Francis|isbn=9781472447951|page=99|url=https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/psu/detail.action?docID=1808795|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Byzantine architecture of the time favored the incorporation of [[spolia]] to celebrate the triumph of Christianity over Paganism, as much of the spolia was sourced from Greek and Roman temples throughout the Empire. Dating of the Omphalos has varied, with some dating it to the reign of Justinian, and some dating it as a later addition, particularly to the reign of Basil I (867-886). The evidence used to argue for this later dating is the seemingly odd placement within Hagia Sophia. However, it is placed in the center of one of the four squares beneath the dome, indicating the placement was not as random as it seems at first glance. Historian Nadine Schibille argues that it fits seamlessly into the original flooring, therefore she concludes that it was an original feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nadine|first1=Schibille|title=Hagia Sophia and the Byzantine Aesthetic Experience|date=2014-11-28|publisher=Taylor and Francis|isbn=9781472447951|page=100|url=https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.proxy.lib.pdx.edu/lib/psu/detail.action?docID=1808795|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Silvia Pedone does not attempt to assign a specific date to it, but she theorizes that it was arranged differently than what is seen today. Some of the smaller circles might have been an addition during re-decoration in the 9th century. The church suffered damage during an earthquake in 1346 that could have damaged the marble. This could account for the asymmetrical design, with repairs altering the overall design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pedone|first1=Silvia|title=The Marble Omphalos of Saint Sophia in Constantinople|date=2011|page=763}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Omphalia==
The word ''omphalion'' is also used to describe other sacred circular marking slabs that were usually located in important or especially sacred churches throughout the Byzantine Empire.

The marble omphalion from the floor of the Church of Hagia Sophia in [[Trabzon]] (north coast of modern Turkey) was brought to [[Thessalonica]] by Greek refugees in 1924.

'''''Prison Terminal: The Last Days of Private Jack Hall''''' is a 2013 [[documentary film]] by  [[Edgar Barens]].

==Plot==
This film tells the story of Jack Hall, a terminally ill octogenarian [[Life imprisonment in the United States|lifer]] at [[Iowa State Penitentiary]]. The film looks at the last six months of Jack's life and the creation of a hospice run by other inmates serving life sentences. The film is a no-nonsense look at the aging population in America’s prisons and how one group helps prisoners die with dignity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Sean P. | last = Means | title = Movie review: Short documentaries speak the truth in small doses | date = 2014-02-06 | publisher = The Salt Lake Tribune | url = http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/entertainment2/57479176-223/program-minutes-violence-aging.html.csp | work = The Salt Lake Tribune | accessdate = 2014-02-10 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140209073747/http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/entertainment2/57479176-223/program-minutes-violence-aging.html.csp | archivedate = 2014-02-09 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Proto-Albanian language''' is the unattested language from which [[Albanian language|Albanian]] later developed. Albanian has evolved from an ancient [[Paleo-Balkan languages|Paleo-Balkan language]], traditionally thought to be [[Illyrian languages|Illyrian]].

==History==
[[Vladimir Orel]] is one of the main modern international linguists to have dealt with the passage from [[Proto-Indo-European]] to Proto-Albanian to Modern Albanian. According to Orel, the study of Proto-Albanian syntax remains in its infancy so there are some limitations to the work. However, there have been developments in the understanding of the historical development of phonetics and vocabulary.&lt;ref name="Orel2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Vladimir Ė Orel|title=A Concise Historical Grammar of the Albanian Language: Reconstruction of Proto-Albanian|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xvKH56aT5mEC&amp;pg=PA1|year=2000|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-11647-8|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939 Academician [[Yevgeny Pavlovsky|E.N.Pavlovsky]] announced his "doctrine of nidality", so called by Soviet biologists.&lt;ref&gt;Natural Nidality of Transmissible Diseases ― By E.N. Pavlovsky, English trans. Urbana,Ill.:University of Illinois Press, 1966,261 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; People can acquire [[zoonose]]s and insect-borne diseases when they occupy at certain times of the year natural [[habitat]] of a certain pathogen ([[Plague (disease)|plague]], [[tularemia]], [[leptospirosis]], [[arbovirus]]es, tick-borne relapsing fever. The [[WHO]] Expert Committee on Zoonoses listed over 100 such diseases.&lt;ref&gt;WHO Tech Rep Ser 378,1967&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;WHO Tech Rep Ser  682,1982&lt;/ref&gt; About natural focality of the diseases is known elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Hubálek Z, Rudolf I, Microbial Zoonoses and Sapronoses. Springer Dordrecht Heidelberg, London New York, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Historically, [[Sanitary]] [[epidemiological]] [[reconnaissance]] implied collection and transfer of all data available on [[sanitary]] and [[epidemiological]] situation of the area of possible deployment and action of [[armed forces]], the same data for the neighbouring and enemy armed forces. The aim for the [[reconnaissance]] was to clear up the reasons of the specific disease origin—sources of the [[infection]] in various extreme situations, including local [[war]]s and [[armed conflict]]s, the ways of the infection transfer and all factors promoting to the [[infestation]]. 
This practice has been successfully used on [[Plague (disease)|plague]]-endemic territory at the time of the [[Soviet–Japanese War (1945)]] in WWII : "Sanitary epidemiological reconnaissance was organized and conducted continuously for the entire depth of the operation. Mobile sanitary epidemiological detachments followed immediately behind the first echelon of tanks and mechanized vehicles of advancing [[Soviet army]] should they encounter any particular [[contagious disease]]. Withdrawing enemy forces had poisoned many wells and water sources".&lt;ref&gt;Loza DF, Gebhardt J Fighting for the Soviet motherland in WWII. p 261, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; 
After the armed forces have become stationary during wartime and emergency of peace time the sanitary epidemiological reconnaissance turns into sanitary and epidemiological [[surveillance]] and medical control of vital and communal activity of the armed forces.&lt;ref name="Beliakov 1976 p153"&gt;Beliakov VD Military Epidemiology. Textbook in Russian. Leningrad, 1976 p153.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mel'nichenko P.I., Ogarkov O.I., Lizunov Yu.V. Military Hygiene and Military Epidemiology. 400 pp., ill. 2005 {{ISBN|5-225-04849-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Difference from Epidemic Intelligence Service==
Sanitary epidemiological reconnaissance as a practice has nothing in common with the [[Epidemic Intelligence Service]] as an educational program of the United States' [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC). The latter was established in 1951 by [[Alexander Langmuir]], due to [[biological warfare]] concerns arising from the [[Korean War]], it has become a hands-on two-year postgraduate training program in [[epidemiology]].

==International recognition==
The use of sanitary epidemiological reconnaissance or similar practices in the armed forces is mentioned elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Security and Public Safety. NATO security through Science. Springer. 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The Polish contingents serving under the [[UN]] auspices focused their tasks among others on ... sanitary-epidemiological reconnaissance ... .&lt;ref&gt;Ilnicki S POLES IN THE SERVICE OF PEACE. 1953-2003  {{cite web |url=http://skmponz.w.interia.pl/art14_eng.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050515182101/http://skmponz.w.interia.pl/art14_eng.htm |archivedate=2005-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The similar practice is recognized by the [[WHO]] and Australia while encompassing chemical, radiological hazards as well.&lt;ref&gt;Rapid Risk Assessment of Acute Public Health Events. WHO.2012&lt;/ref&gt; They call it "All-hazards approach"&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Health Risk Assessment. 2004&lt;/ref&gt; [[US Department of Health and Human Services]] in the page 300 of its manual in&lt;ref&gt;Principles of Epidemiology. Second Edition. US Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/ref&gt;  admits existence of other surveillance systems calling them "early-warning systems of disease potential" with the aim to collect data on indicators of disease or disease potential: animal population (animal morbidity and mortality by a disease that can affect humans, the presence of a disease agent in wild and domestic sentinel animals, vectors of a disease) and environmental data.

==Conduction of the reconnaissance==
There is a definite need in mobile sanitary-epidemiological groups, trained and equipped for the task. Any group for sanitary epidemiological reconnaissance includes: [[epidemiologist]], specialist on infections, assistant of epidemiologist ([[bacteriologist]]-[[lab assistant]]), medical orderly (if necessary, the group will include [[zoologist]] or [[parasitologist]]). These units should be formed up in the deployable medical set-ups.&lt;ref&gt;Volodin AS et al The organizational and methodological bases of medical reconnaissance in extreme situations. Article in Russian.Voenno-medit͡sinskiĭ zhurnal.1999 Apr;320(4):14-21, 110&lt;/ref&gt; Sanitary-epidemiological reconnaissance should result in revealing of the patients and persons, suspected to the specific disease, their isolation and hospitalization.

A sanitary-epidemiological kit is constructed, consisting of two separate units, but each adaptable to use with the other: a portable [[laboratory kit]] and a portable combination lab apparatus. The two units can be useful in the work of epidemiologists during sanitary-epidemiological reconnaissance and sanitary epidemiological surveys.&lt;ref&gt;Christova, A. S. ; Stoyachev, N. N.  PORTABLE SANITARY-EPIDEMIOLOGICAL KIT ARMY BIOLOGICAL LABS FREDERICK MD http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=AD0677078&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the 21st century==
In 2010 at The Meeting of the States Parties to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of [[Biological warfare|Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons]]  and Their Destruction in [[Geneva]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opbw.org/new_process/msp2010/BWC_MSP_2010_WP8_E.pdf The Meeting of the States Parties to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weaponsand Their Destruction]&lt;/ref&gt; the sanitary epidemiological reconnaissance was suggested as well-tested means for enhancing the monitoring of infections and parasitic agents, for practical implementation of the [[International Health Regulations]] (2005). The aim was to prevent and minimize the consequences of natural outbreaks of dangerous infectious diseases as well as the threat of alleged use of biological weapons against BTWC States Parties. It is pointed out the significance of the sanitary epidemiological reconnaissance in assessing the sanitary-epidemiological situation, organizing and conducting preventive activities, indicating and identifying pathogenic biological agents in the environmental sites, conducting laboratory analysis of biological materials, suppressing hotbeds of infectious diseases, providing advisory and practical assistance to local health authorities.

Sanitary epidemiological reconnaissance (inspection) or a similar practice and specific indication in the hotbed  should be performed immediately after the receiving of the information about bio-terrorism attack.&lt;ref&gt;N.

There were compiled the principles of organization of sanitary epidemiological reconnaissance and criteria for evaluating the sanitary epidemiological status of arms force and regions of their dislocation.&lt;ref&gt;Mel'nichenko P.I., Ogarkov O.I., Lizunov Yu.V.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11877">The '''sociology of Jewry''' involves the application of [[sociological theory]] and method to the study of the [[Jews|Jewish people]] and the [[Judaism|Jewish religion]]. [[Sociologists]] are concerned with the social patterns within Jewish groups and communities; [[American Jewry]], [[Israeli Jews]] and Jewish life in the [[diaspora]]. Sociological studies of the Jewish religion include religious membership, ritual and denominational patterns. Notable journals include ''[[Jewish Social Studies]]'', ''[[The Jewish Journal of Sociology]]'' and ''[[Contemporary Jewry]].

==Emergence of the discipline==

===Beginnings: 1930s-1950s===
Sociology of Jewry initially emerged in the United States in the 1930s beginning with the 1938 publication of ''Jewish Social Studies'', sponsored by the Conference of Jewish Relations. The Journal's mission was "to promote, by means of scientific research, a better understanding of the position of Jews in the modern world." And the later publication of ''The Jewish Journal of Sociology'' in 1958 was due to the "few opportunities... for publishing academic and scientific studies of the sociology of Jews."&lt;ref name=Heilman1982&gt;Heilman, Samuel C. "The sociology of American Jewry: The last ten years." ''Annual Review of Sociology'' 8, no. 1 (1982): 135-160.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Growth and development: 1950s-present===
In 1955, sociologist [[Seymour Lipset]] noted that the discipline was underdeveloped, stating that there were far more "Jewish sociologists" than "sociologists of Jews".&lt;ref&gt;Lipset, Seymour. "Jewish Sociologists and Sociologists of the Jews." ''Jewish Social Studies'' (1955): 177-178.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the subfield began to grow in the late 1960s and 1970s. A professional organization was formed, namely the [[Association for the Social Scientific Study of Jewry]] (ASSJ). In 1975, a new academic journal was founded as well, ''[[Contemporary Jewry]]''.

Contributing to this growth was the work of [[Marshall Sklare]], now considered one of the founding figures in the sociology of Jewry.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, Jack Nusan. "The Sociology of Jewry: Blueprints for the future from contemporary designs." ''Contemporary Jewry'' 4, no. 1 (1977): 24-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Marshall Sklare and [[Joseph Greenblum]]’s 1967 study of Jewish identity in “Lakeville” is considered one of the most notable works of its kind. The sociological study of intergroup relations and the theories proposed by [[Nathan Glazer]] and [[Daniel P. Moynihan]] is also thought to have contributed to the growth of the sociology of Jewry.&lt;ref&gt;Dashefsky, Arnold, Bernard Lazerwitz, and Ephraim Tabory. [http://www.booksfree.yolasite.com/resources/Free_Books/Handbook%20of%20the%20Sociology%20of%20Religion.pdf "A Journey of the" Straight Way" or the" Roundabout Path."] Handbook of the sociology of religion (2003): 240-261. Accessed May 8, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Formation of the ASSJ====
The idea for the formation of a professional organization for scholars specializing in the sociology of Jewry first surfaced in 1966; the concept was discussed by [[Werner J. Cahnman]] and [[Norman L. Friedman]] at an American Sociological Association (ASA) conference.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Norman L. "Conception and Birth of the Association for the Sociological Study of Jewry," ''Ethnic Forum'' 6 (1986): 98-111.&lt;/ref&gt; The association was informally launched by Norman Friedman and [[Bernard Lazerwitz]] in 1970; the event, titled "The Sociological Study of Jewry" took place at the ASA annual conference. Sociologists [[Solomon Poll]], [[Mervin Verbit]] and [[Arnold Dashevsky]] submitted a motion to establish a formal group; the motion was voted upon and accepted. The new group, the [[Association for the Social Scientific Study of Jewry]] (ASSJ or ASSSJ) was launched and formally met the following year. The group has since organized annual conferences, established the academic journal ''Contemporary Jewry'', founded the ''ASSJ Newsletter'' and honors exceptional scholars in the field with the [[Marshall Sklare Award]].&lt;ref name=waxmanassj&gt;Waxman, Chaim I."[https://books.google.com/books?id=0s_QAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA134&amp;lpg=PA134&amp;dq=sociology+of+Jewry&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lGnh34psjS&amp;sig=IpTbg8GEyHoMQJ3zw210i3-JDro&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5N9sU9vRGMe2yASH5YGoAw&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwCA The Professional Dilemma of Jewish Social Scientists: The Case of the ASSJ]."

[https://books.google.com/books?id=hNhXAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA207&amp;lpg=PA207&amp;dq=solomon+poll+sociology&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hj3QphEghz&amp;sig=zLFOXhvJahT5XPp0NHuGpJyrEyE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IvNsU66eG5SryAS5q4GAAg&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwBw ''Sociology of Religion in America: A History of a Secular Fascination with Religion''].

Swatos, Jr. Hartford Institute for Religion Research. Accessed May 12, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the ASSJ and ''Contemporary Jewry'' are dominated by sociologists and sociological studies - all but one of the organization's presidents earned a doctorate in sociology, the other received a doctorate in psychology&lt;ref name=Blasi/&gt; - the focus has not been restricted to sociology alone. Studies involving other social sciences and history are included as well, and professionals from those disciplines have joined as members, contributors and honorees.&lt;ref name=waxmanassj/&gt;

==General theories==

===American Jewry===
According to sociologist [[Samuel Heilman]], there are three major theoretical approaches in studying the sociology of American Jewry in particular:
*''Uniqueness of Judaism'' and ''Particularism vs. Universalism'' - a popular theoretical approach towards understanding contemporary American Jewry has been the notion that more than anything else Judaism as a religion accounts for the social situation of U.S. Jews today.&lt;ref&gt;Sharot, Stephen. ''Judaism: A Sociology.'' Newton Abbot: David &amp; Charles, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; The current social and political decisions of the Jewish community are rooted in the response to the inevitable conflict between Jewish religious values on one hand, and secular American life on the other.&lt;ref&gt;Liebman, Charles S. ''The Ambivalent American Jew: Politics, religion and family in American Jewish life.'' Jewish publication society of America, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as [[Milton Himmelfarb]], focus less on the Jewish religion per se and focus on the tension produced by balancing the particularism of the Jewish tradition vs. the universalism of American modernity.&lt;ref&gt;Himmelfarb, Milton. ''The Jews of Modernity.'' New York, NY: Basic Books, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Marginal culture'' - in the 1940s and 1950s, some scholars, such as [[Milton M. Goldberg]], saw Jewish life in America as a successful "marginal culture," following the "[[marginal man theory]]" of [[Robert E. Park]] and [[Everett Stonequist]] popular at the time&lt;ref&gt;Bergmann, Werner, ed. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=N6W7oL3x1qAC&amp;pg=PA163&amp;lpg=PA163&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Error Without Trial: Psychological Research on Antisemitism].'' Vol. 2. Walter de Gruyter, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Community and organizations'' - a third approach stems from the work of political scientist [[Daniel J. Elazar]] and focuses and the underlying dynamics behind the decision making within Jewish community organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Elazar, Daniel Judah. ''Community and polity: The organizational dynamics of American Jewry.'' Jewish Publication Society, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

While other theoretical approaches have been advanced they have not majorly impacted the discipline's research agenda.&lt;ref name=Heilman1982/&gt;

==Applied sociology==
[[Samuel Klausner]], a former president of the ASSJ, noted that the sociology of Jewry is more an applied social science than a theoretical one. For Klausner, theories developed in sociology may help explain any society, not just a Jewish one. The contribution of the sociology of Jewry therefore is the application of the science, such as its methodology.&lt;ref&gt;Klausner, Samuel Z. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=TLSKRqkGMToC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;dq=sociology+of+Jewry&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RGjjdeUVLR&amp;sig=wI1-V_RSkJ3tQNEAZMCv6qNfqeM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=GuBsU4_fO86wyASMg4LACw&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwATgK What is conceptually special about a sociology of Jewry]." ''Contemporary Anarchism''. Ed. Terry M. Perlin. Transaction Publishers. 1987. Accessed May 9, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Others, however, stress that the subfield is a part of general [[comparative sociology]].&lt;ref&gt;Zenner, Walter P. "American jewry in the light of middleman minority theories." Contemporary Jewry 5, no. 1 (1980): 11-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Syllabi collections==

===1946 syllabus===
In 1946, [[Kurt H. Wolff]], a student of [[Karl Mannheim]], published “An Elementary Syllabus in the Sociology of the Jews” in ''[[Social Forces]]'', a notable sociology journal. Wolff's aim was to provide an aid to including material on Jews in courses on race relations, social disorganization, minorities, and/or introductory sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Wolff, Kurt H. "An Elementary Syllabus in the Sociology of the Jews." Social Forces (1946): 451-461.&lt;/ref&gt; Wolff's syllabus focused on three topics:
*Demographic changes following the aftermath of [[World War II]] and the [[holocaust]]
*The "ethnic identifiability" of Jews
*[[Antisemitism]]

Later scholars have noted that Wolff's syllabus on the Sociology of Jewry sought to study external structures but ignored the internal dynamics of the Jewish community.&lt;ref name=Burstein2007&gt;Burstein, Paul. "[http://www.overcominghateportal.org/uploads/5/4/1/5/5415260/sociology_of_jewry.pdf The Sociology of Jewry: Syllabi and Instructional Materials.]" ''ASA Resource Materials For Teaching''. American Sociological Association. Washington, DC. 2007. Accessed May 8, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1992 ASA syllabi collection===
In 1992, Rabbi [[Jack Nusan Porter]] edited the first syllabus collection and curriculum guide on the Sociology of Jewry. The collection was published by the [[American Sociological Association]] (ASA). The collection included individual syllabi on the sociology of Jews from 34 colleges and universities. However, Porter found that many of the syllabi focused exclusively on Jewish life in America. And only 10 out of 34 syllabi were from sociology departments.&lt;ref name=Burstein2007/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Porter, Jack N. 1998. The Sociology of Jewry: A Curriculum Guide. 2nd ed. Washington, DC: American Sociological Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2007 ASA syllabi collection===
[[Paul Burstein]] of the [[University of Washington]] compiled an updated collection of syllabi on the sociology of Jewry. This collection was published by the [[American Sociological Association]] (ASA) in 2007. In his work, Burstein focuses on the following themes:
*Comparative historical approach, examining changing and evolving patterns of Jewish life in the last few hundred years
*Jewish life in North America, though focusing mostly on the United States
*Jewish life in Israel
*The [[Holocaust]]

Burstein notes gaps in specific areas. For example, while Black-Jewish relations in the U.S. is covered in the syllabi, relations between Jews and other groups is not. Also, there are few areas covered outside of American and Israeli Jewry.&lt;ref name=Burstein2007/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1883">'''Songshark''' is a term for a dishonest [[Music publisher (popular music)|music publisher]], whose main source of income is the naivete of new [[songwriter]]s, whom they charge for services a reputable publisher would provide free to their clients.&lt;ref name="Billboard 1918 Feb 16" /&gt;

"Song shark" is the trade name for any individual, or firm who, with the deliberate intention to defraud, solicits business from amateur songwriters, advising them that by having music written to their lyrics, or vice versa, they will have a finished composition which will immediately be "snatched up" by a music publisher. Often, the song shark will himself claim to be a publisher, and will tell the songwriter that his only expense will be in "defraying half the costs of publication."

'''South West Wales Tourism Partnership''' (SWWTP) is the Regional Tourism Partnership (RTP) serving [[South West Wales]]. The Wales Tourist Board, now ''"Visit Wales"'', and part of the [[National Assembly for Wales]] initiated the formation of 4 RTPs across [[Wales]] to receive [[devolution|devolved]] resources and responsibilities for many aspects of [[tourism]] [[marketing]] and development. The partners in SWWTP are all the local authorities and a broad spread of tourism, [[hospitality]], and [[leisure industry]] representatives from across the Region. SWWTP acts as the lead body supporting [[tourism]] in [[South West Wales]].

Key elements within the Partnership’s aims include: "…the need to maximise potential and eliminate wasteful competition for the ultimate benefit of the [[consumer]] and the trade" and "to encourage a greater integration of public and private sector resources by nurturing a distinct regional bias in decision making, reflective of the regional strategy / business plan".{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} The SWWTP drives forward the SWW Regional Tourism Strategy, 'Open All Year'.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8423">The '''Stonecoast MFA Program in Creative Writing''' is a graduate program in creative writing based at the [[University of Southern Maine]]  in [[Portland, Maine]], [[United States]].  Stonecoast enrolls approximately 100 students in four major genres: creative nonfiction, fiction, poetry, and popular fiction.  Other areas of student interest, including literary translation, performance, writing for stage and screen, writing Nature, and cross-genre writing, are pursued as elective options.  Students also choose one track that focuses an intensive research project in their third semester from among these categories: craft, creative collaboration, literary theory, publishing, social justice/community service, and teaching/pedagogy. Stonecoast is one of only two graduate creative writing programs in the country offering a degree in [[popular fiction]]. It is accredited through the [[New England Association of Schools and Colleges]] (NEASC).

The Stonecoast MFA program is a [[low-residency program]]. Ten-day residencies for students, faculty, and visiting writers are held each January and June. Each semester, a group of ten students also goes to Ireland for a smaller residency. Residencies involve an intensive schedule of workshops, classes, readings, and gatherings. The rest of a student's academic work during the two-year program is pursued on a one-on-one basis under the leadership of a faculty mentor.

Founded in 2002 by Barbara Lee Hope, Ken Rosen, and Dianne Benedict, Stonecoast came to national prominence under the direction of poet [[Annie Finch]] who served as director from 2004 to 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120710122548/http://media.www.usmfreepress.org/media/storage/paper311/news/2004/09/20/News/Usms-Stonecoast.Mfa.Experiences.Changes-724254.shtml ''The Free Press Online: The University of Southern Maine's Newspaper'' &gt; ''USM's Stonecoast MFA Experiences Changes'' &gt; By Erik Eisele &gt; Issue date: 9/20/04 Section: News] [[The Free Press (University of Southern Maine)|The Free Press Online]]&lt;/ref&gt; Stonecoast is one of the oldest and best-known of the second wave of low-residency graduate programs in creative writing, following on the first wave of the Warren Wilson, Goddard, and Bennington graduate programs. Stonecoast departed from its predecessor programs in a number of significant ways including more flexibility in cross-genre work, more student input into mentor choice and curriculum, seminar-style classes as opposed to lectures, and more flexibility in third-semester projects. The program received coverage in ''The Atlantic Monthly'' feature on MFA programs focusing in particular on its Ireland residency and popular fiction component.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200708/edward-delaney-mfa ''The Atlantic Monthly'' &gt; August 2007 &gt; ''Where Great Writers Are Made: Assessing America's Top Graduate Writing Programs'' By Edward J. Delaney]&lt;/ref&gt; Other innovative curricular features include a foundation workshop in poetic meter for incoming poets and student-initiated elective workshops on special topics in writing.

Stonecoast has been ranked consistently among the "Top Ten Low-Residency Programs" by ''[[Poets &amp; Writers]]'' magazine since 2011.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3363">'''The Contemporary African Art Collection (CAAC)''' is a private collection created in 1990 by Italian business man, [[Jean Pigozzi]] after his encounter with French independent curator, André Magnin.  Magnin specializes in art from non-Western cultures, and especially sub-Saharan art.  The CAAC came into being at a time when non-Western contemporary art was largely ignored on the international scene.  It was founded shortly after the seminal exhibition ''The Magicians of the Earth'' at the [[Pompidou Center]] in Paris, curated by Jean-Huber Martin.   It was the first truly international exhibition where contemporary works from all over the world were shown on an equal footing.

The CAAC includes several thousand artworks, featuring sculptures, drawings, photographs, installations and videos,  by over 80 artists, living and working in sub-Saharan African countries.  Some of its artists live in large cities and attended art schools.  Others were "self-taught" and some are from remote areas and work within local traditions that they extend and enrich.

The CAAC regularly organizes exhibitions and artwork loans  in major museums and art foundations around the world, such as [[Tate Modern]] (London), Pompidou Center (Paris), Guggenheim Bilbao, [[Metropolitan Museum]] (NY), [[Museum of Fine Arts, Houston]] (Texas),  [[National Museum of African Art]] (Washington), [[Cartier Foundation]] (Paris) and the [[Saatchi Gallery]] (London).  It also has published several catalogues and monographies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3440">The '''''vagina loquens''''', or "talking vagina", is a significant tradition in literature and art, dating back to the ancient [[folklore]] [[Motif (folkloristics)|motif]] of the "talking cunt".&lt;ref name=ozark&gt;{{cite book|title=Unprintable Ozark Folksongs and Folklore: Blow the candle out|publisher=[[University of Arkansas Press]]|author=Vance Randolph, Gershon Legman |year=1992|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S93LdPw2KP0C&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|isbn=1557282374|pages=819–820}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zizek&gt;{{cite book|title=Organs without bodies: Deleuze and consequences|publisher=[[Routledge]]|author=Slavoj Zizek |year=2004|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pp6-1yQbgmgC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|isbn=0415969212|page=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tales usually involve [[vaginas]] talking due to the effect of magic or charms, and often admitting to their unchastity.&lt;ref name=ozark/&gt; Another tradition is a vagina that acquires the power of speech to play the role of [[informant]] and reveal a history of  previous lovers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=vagina loquens|url=http://www.definition-of.com/vagina%20loquens|publisher=Definition Of|accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Talking vaginas are an early theme in [[French literature]], most notably in  the 13th century [[fabliau]] ''Le Chevalier qui faisoit parler les cons et les culs''&lt;ref name=ozark/&gt; and in ''[[Les bijoux indiscrets]]'', the first novel by [[Denis Diderot]]. Published anonymously in 1748, ''Les bijoux indiscrets'' (''The Indiscreet Jewels'') is an allegory that portrays [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] as the sultan Mangogul of the Congo who owns a magic ring that makes women's genitals ("jewels") talk. A comparable ''trope'' that Diderot must have known is found in the ribald ''[[fabliau]]''.&lt;ref name=ozark/&gt;

In American literature, a talking vagina is featured in the [[Ozark]] folktale ''The Magic Walking Stick'',&lt;ref name=ozark/&gt; in which vaginas are made to act as informants. The talking vagina theme is the central trope of ''[[The Vagina Monologues]]''.&lt;ref name=Zizek/&gt;

In [[modern art]] the talking vagina theme is featured prominently in the works of [[Stephanie Sarley]] in a subset of her "Crotch Monster" series. The talking vagina characters are depicted as [[anthropomorphized]] [[vulvae]] reacting emotionally and engaging in various activities.&lt;ref name="huffPostSSarley"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In film, the [[pornographic movies]] ''[[Le Sexe qui parle]]'' (1975) and its sequel (1978), and its non-pornographic remake, ''[[Chatterbox (1977 film)|Chatterbox]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shumate|first=Nathan|title=Chatterbox (1977)|url=http://www.coldfusionvideo.com/archives/chatterbox-1977/|publisher=Cold Fusion Reviews|accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  feature talking vaginas.

On television, [[Joan Rivers]] portrayed [[List_of_Drawn_Together_characters#Princess_Clara|Princess Clara]]'s talking vagina on ''[[Drawn Together]]''.

The '''Newby-McMahon Building''', commonly referred to as the '''world's littlest skyscraper''', is located at 701 La Salle (on the corner of Seventh and La Salle streets) in downtown [[Wichita Falls, Texas|Wichita Falls]], [[Texas]]. This late [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] style red brick and [[cast stone]] structure is {{convert|40|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall,&lt;ref name=Bundy/&gt; and its exterior dimensions are {{convert|18|ft|m|abbr=on}} deep and {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide.&lt;ref name=ARN19980820/&gt;&lt;ref name=WFTRN20091230/&gt; Its interior dimensions are approximately {{convert|12|ft|m|abbr=on}} by {{convert|9|ft|m|abbr=on}}, or approximately {{convert|108|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}. Steep, narrow, internal stairways leading to the upper floors occupy roughly 25 percent of the interior area.&lt;ref name=Bundy/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stowers2008/&gt;

Reportedly the result of a fraudulent investment scheme by a [[Confidence trick|confidence man]], the Newby-McMahon Building was a source of great embarrassment to the city and its residents after its completion in 1919. During the 1920s, the Newby-McMahon Building was featured in [[Robert Ripley]]'s ''[[Ripley's Believe It or Not!]]'' syndicated column as "the world's littlest skyscraper," a nickname that has stuck with it ever since. The Newby-McMahon Building is now part of the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Wichita County, Texas|Depot Square Historic District]] of Wichita Falls, a [[Recorded Texas Historic Landmark|Texas Historic Landmark]].

==Background==
A large [[petroleum reservoir]] was discovered just west of the city of [[Burkburnett, Texas|Burkburnett]], a small town in [[Wichita County, Texas|Wichita County]], Texas in 1912.&lt;ref name=Kelly1982/&gt;&lt;ref name=Olien2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hart2010/&gt; Burkburnett and its surrounding communities became [[boomtown]]s, experiencing explosive growth of their populations and economies. By 1918, an estimated 20,000 new settlers had taken up residence around the lucrative [[oil field]], and many Wichita County residents became wealthy virtually overnight. As people streamed into the local communities in search of high-paying jobs, the nearby city of Wichita Falls began to grow in importance. Though it initially lacked the necessary infrastructure for this sudden increase in economic and industrial activity, Wichita Falls was a natural choice to serve as the local logistical hub, being the seat of Wichita County. Because office space was lacking, major stock transactions and [[mineral rights]] deals were conducted on street corners and in tents that served as makeshift headquarters for the new oil companies.&lt;ref name=WFTRN20010725/&gt;

==Proposal and blueprints==
The Newby-McMahon Building is a four-story brick building located near the railroad depot in downtown Wichita Falls, built in 1906 by Augustus Newby (1855–1909),&lt;ref name=WDT1909/&gt;&lt;ref name=TSOT0721/&gt; a director of the Wichita Falls and Oklahoma City Railway Company.&lt;ref name=OK1898/&gt; The oil-rig construction firm of J.D. McMahon, a [[Landman (oil worker)|petroleum landman]] and [[structural engineer]] from [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], was one of seven tenants whose offices were based in the original Newby Building.&lt;ref name=Bundy/&gt;&lt;ref name=TSOT0721/&gt;

According to local legend,&lt;ref name=Kelso2007&gt;{{cite book|title=Texas Curiosities: Quirky Characters, Roadside Oddities &amp; Other Offbeat Stuff|edition=3rd|chapter=North Texas|page=112|author=Kelso J|publisher=Morris Book Publishing|location=Kearney, Nebraska|year=2007|isbn=978-0-7627-4109-0|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gW9ye7wu0E0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Texas+Curiosities:+Quirky+Characters,+Roadside+Oddities+%26+Other+Offbeat+Stuff}}&lt;/ref&gt; when McMahon announced in 1919 that he would build a highrise annex to the Newby Building as a solution to the newly wealthy city's urgent need for office space, investors were eager to invest in the project.&lt;ref name=WFTRN20010725/&gt;&lt;ref name=TAC20000915/&gt; McMahon collected $200,000 (US ${{Inflation|US|200000|1919|r=-5|fmt=c}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}) in [[Financial capital|investment capital]] from this group of naive investors, promising to construct a highrise office building across the street from the [[St. James Hotel (Wichita Falls, Texas)|St. James Hotel]].&lt;ref name=WFTRN20091230/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stowers2008/&gt;

The key to McMahon's swindle, and his successful defense in the ensuing lawsuit, was that he never verbally stated that the actual height of the building would be {{convert|480|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name=ARN19980820/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fodors2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=WFTRN20021208/&gt; The proposed skyscraper depicted in the blueprints that he distributed (and which were approved by the investors) was clearly labeled as consisting of four floors and {{convert|480|in|m}}.&lt;ref name=Pohlen2006/&gt;

==Construction and ensuing legal battle==
McMahon used his own construction crews to build the McMahon Building on the small, unused piece of property next to the Newby Building, without obtaining prior consent from the owner of the property, who lived in Oklahoma.&lt;ref name=WFTRN20021208/&gt; As the building began to take shape, the investors realized they had been swindled into purchasing a four-story edifice that was only {{convert|40|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall, rather than the {{convert|480|ft|m|abbr=on}} structure they were expecting.

They brought a lawsuit against McMahon, but to their dismay, the real estate and construction deal was declared legally binding by a local judge &amp;ndash; as McMahon had built exactly according to the blueprints they had approved, no legal remedy was available for the deceived investors.&lt;ref name=Stowers2008/&gt; They did recover a small portion of their investment from the elevator company, which refused to honor the contract after they learned of the confidence trick. No stairway was installed in the building upon its initial completion, as none was included in the original blueprints. Rather, a ladder was employed to gain access to the upper three floors.&lt;ref name=ARN19980820/&gt; By the time construction was complete, McMahon had left Wichita Falls and perhaps even Texas, taking with him the balance of the investors' money.&lt;ref name=Pohlen2006/&gt;

==Early occupancy and subsequent abandonment==
Upon its completion and opening in 1919, the Newby-McMahon Building was an immediate source of great embarrassment to the city and its residents.&lt;ref name=WFTRN20010327/&gt;&lt;ref name=WFTRN20040506/&gt; The ground floor had six desks representing the six different companies that occupied the building as its original tenants.&lt;ref name=WFTRN20021208/&gt; Throughout most of the 1920s, the building housed only two firms.&lt;ref name=WFTRN20021208/&gt; During the 1920s, the Newby-McMahon Building was featured in Robert Ripley's ''Ripley's Believe It or Not!'' syndicated column as "the world's littlest skyscraper", which is a name that has stuck with it ever since.&lt;ref name=ARN19980820/&gt;&lt;ref name=TSOT0721/&gt;&lt;ref name=WFTRN19990917/&gt;

The oil industry would ultimately prove to be a [[resource curse]] to Wichita Falls, and the [[Texas Oil Boom]] ended only a few years later. The building was vacated, boarded up, and virtually forgotten in 1929 as the [[Great Depression]] struck North Texas and office space became relatively inexpensive to lease or purchase.&lt;ref name=Stowers2008/&gt; A fire gutted the building in 1931, rendering it unusable for a number of years.&lt;ref name=WFTRN20021208/&gt;

After the Great Depression, the building housed a succession of tenants, including barber shops and cafés. The building changed hands many times and was scheduled for demolition on several occasions, but escaped this fate apparently because a sufficient number of local residents came to its defense.&lt;ref name=TSOT0721/&gt; It was eventually deeded to the city of Wichita Falls. As the building continued to deteriorate, in 1986 the city gave the building to the Wichita County Heritage Society (WCHS), with the hope that it would eventually be restored, making it a viable part of the Depot Square Historic District.&lt;ref name=ARN19980820/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stowers2008/&gt;

==Purchase and renovation==
By 1999, the Newby-McMahon Building had proved to be an excessive burden on the limited capital reserves of the WCHS.&lt;ref name=WFTRN19990810/&gt;&lt;ref name=WFTRN19991018/&gt;&lt;ref name=WFTRN19991020/&gt;&lt;ref name=WFTRN20000806/&gt; The following year, the city council hired the local architectural firm of Bundy, Young, Sims &amp; Potter to stabilize the crumbling structure, amid steadily growing talk of demolishing the building.&lt;ref name=Stowers2008/&gt; Dick Bundy and his partners became fascinated with the history and legacy of the building; they arranged a partnership with Marvin Groves Electric, another local business, to purchase the building.&lt;ref name=Bundy/&gt; In December 2000, the city council voted to allow the WCHS to sell the building to Marvin Groves for $3,748.&lt;ref name=WFTRN20001216/&gt;

On June 11, 2003, a storm swept through Wichita Falls, bringing gusts of wind as strong as {{convert|97|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. A 15-ft (4.6-m) section of brick wall from the McMahon Building complex was knocked down.&lt;ref name=WFTRN20030614/&gt; The damage from this storm was repaired, but full restoration of the building and the adjacent Newby Building was delayed until late 2005. In June of that year, the City Council granted $25,000 in funds from the city's [[tax increment financing]] fund, to be invested in the restoration of the McMahon Building.&lt;ref name=WFTRN20050619/&gt;&lt;ref name=WFTRN20050622/&gt; Restoration of the building is estimated to have cost more than $254,000, the remainder of which was paid by the owners (Bundy, Young, Sims &amp; Potter, Inc. and Marvin Groves Electric).&lt;ref name=WFTRN20050619/&gt;&lt;ref name=WFTRN20050622/&gt;

[[File:Newby-McMahon Building-02.jpg|thumb|alt=|Plaque attached to the Newby-McMahon Building, also known as the "world's littlest skyscraper". This plaque refers to the building adjacent to the "skyscraper" which was completed in 1906, the "skyscraper" building was completed in 1919.]]

With the passage of time, the Newby-McMahon Building has become a monument to a long-gone era. It has survived tornadoes, a fire, and decades of neglect to stand as a monument to the greed, genius, graft, and gullibility of the [[oil boom]] days of [[North Texas]].&lt;ref name=OConnor1986/&gt; The building is currently part of the Depot Square Historic District of Wichita Falls,&lt;ref name=TSOT0721/&gt; which has been declared a [[Recorded Texas Historic Landmark|Texas Historic Landmark]] and listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=WFTRN19990319/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Depot Square Historic District |work=Texas Historic Sites Atlas |publisher=[[Texas Historical Commission]] |url=http://atlas.thc.state.tx.us/viewform.asp?atlas_num=2003001552 |accessdate=July 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building has never met the criteria for the definition of a [[skyscraper]],&lt;ref name=ESN24419/&gt; nor even that of a "[[Tower block|highrise]]" building.&lt;ref name=ESN18727/&gt; After its renovation, the building was home to an antiques dealership, the Antique Wood, which opened in 2006 on the ground floor.&lt;ref name=WFTRN20050728/&gt;&lt;ref name=WFTRN20070326/&gt; Since 2013, besides being a local tourist attraction, a furniture and home décor consignment boutique, Hello Again has occupied the entire building.  At times, floors of the skyscraper have been subleased to various local artisans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McGinnis|first1=Judith|title=Downtown retail future gets boost from the past|publisher=Wichita Falls Times Record News|date=Feb 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Newby-McMahon Building is among several historic buildings featured in the documentary film ''Wichita Falls: The Future of Our Past'', a retrospective analysis of the city's architectural past produced in 2006 by Barry Levy, a public information officer with the city of Wichita Falls.&lt;ref name=WFTRN20061202/&gt;
&lt;!--A document written by Delores Mathews and updated by Ruth E. Reuther gives more of the history of the building.--&gt;
