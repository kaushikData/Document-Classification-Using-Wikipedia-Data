'''Artur Carlos de Barros Basto''' ({{lang-he|אברהם ישראל בן-ראש}}; '''Abraham Israel Ben-Rosh''') was born December 18, 1887 in [[Amarante, Portugal]], and died in [[Porto]] on March 8, 1961. He made a career in the [[military]] and as a [[writer]], who published several works related to Judaism. He was an important Jewish leader and one of the people who established the Jewish Community in Porto and assisted the construction of the [[Kadoorie Synagogue]], the biggest Synagogue in [[Iberian Peninsula]]. Furthermore, he helped the return of [[Crypto-Jews]] to the Jewish people and, during World War II, helped Jewish refugees escape the [[Holocaust]].

==Life and work==

When Barros Basto was still young his dying grandfather revealed to him that he had Jewish ancestors. His family had not kept the Jewish precepts and so he became aware of the existence of [[Jews in Portugal]] only in 1904; the year he read a newspaper article referring to the inauguration of the synagogue [[Shaaré Tikva]], in [[Lisbon]].

Years later, he joined the [[Portuguese Army|army]], and when ordered to attend a course at the Escola Politécnica de Lisboa (Technical School of Lisbon), the young Barros Basto went to the [[synagogue]] of the city in an attempt to be admitted there. The leaders of the synagogue didn’t give him permission but Barros Basto wouldn’t give up.

When the Republic was established in 1910 Barros Bastos was the one who raised the Republican flag in the city of Porto.

During the [[First World War]], as a [[lieutenant]] of the army he commanded a battalion of the [[Portuguese Expeditionary Corps]] in the front of [[Flanders]]. For his acts of bravery and honor on the battlefield he was awarded medals and promoted to [[captain (armed forces)|captain]].

Barros Basto was self-taught, and after learning [[Hebrew]] he lived for a while in [[Morocco]] where he began a formal process of conversion to Judaism (known in Hebrew as [[Giur]]). This process completed when he was circumcised in [[Tangier]] and later subjected to a rabbinical court ([[Beit Din]]).&lt;ref&gt;Mea, Elvira de Azevedo e Steinhardt, Inácio - ''Ben-Rosh. Biografia do Capitão Barros Basto'', Lisboa: Afrontamento, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; After which he changed his name to Abraham Israel Ben-Rosh.

Back in Lisbon, he married Lea Israel Montero Azancot, of the Jewish Community of Lisbon, from whom he had a son and a daughter. He also had several grandchildren and great-grandchildren, his granddaughter Isabel Ferreira Lopes, is the current vice president of the Jewish Community of Porto. He is also great-granduncle of the actress [[Daniela Ruah]].

[[File:Barros Basto e Lea Azancot.jpg|thumb|left|Lea Azancot and Barros Basto]]

In 1921 he returned to Porto with his wife. At that time Barros Basto realized that there were less than twenty [[Ashkenazi Jews]] living in the city. As there wasn’t a synagogue in Porto these [[Jews]] were not organized and had to travel to Lisbon for religious purposes whenever necessary.

Upon learning that reality he began to think about building a synagogue and took initiative in 1923, by officially registering the Jewish Community of the Porto and the Israelite Theological Center in the [[City Council]] of Porto.

The current building of the synagogue was built years later but the community was organized and rented a house on the street Elias Garcia, which started to function as a synagogue. As time went on, more and more people started to appear in the synagogue. They said they were descendants of Jews forced to convert in the 15th century and claimed to maintain alive yet some Jewish practices and rituals, in the secrecy of their homes. These people, the [[crypto-Jews]], began to participate in religious services.

In 1927, he founded and directed the Portuguese Jewish Newspaper called [[Ha-Lapid]].

The claims of the crypto-Jews were proved true by Barros Basto and the committee of [[London]], who found that they did not lie about their origins since they proved to still keep prayers to [[Hashem]] and respect the [[Sabbath]] as their ancestors. It should also be noted that on the Act n. º 68 Directorate (Maâmad) of the Jewish Community of Porto it was written that anyone who could "absolutely prove their Jewish origin." would be admitted into the congregation.

[[File:BBasto002.jpg|thumb|Barros Basto]]

This occurrence sparked  Barros Basto’s interest, who therefore, decided to visit frequently the [[villages]] and [[town]]s of the [[Trás-os-Montes Province|Trás os Montes]] and [[Beiras]] regions, looking for more people interested in returning to [[Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz, Samuel. - ''Os cristãos-novos em Portugal no século XX''. Lisboa: Instituto de Sociologia e Etnologia das Religiões, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; This measure gained the attention of some people, especially some Jewish communities, as is the case of the Community of Portuguese Jews in London, who created the "Portuguese Marranos Committee", an organization dedicated to help people who wanted to return to Judaism.

With the change of regime in the 1930s, Barros Basto was associated with the opposition, and was soon being chased by the army. He started to be placed in locations farther away from Porto, in an attempt to push him away from the Synagogue and the Community.

In 1937, Barros Basto was adjudicated by the Disciplinary Board of the Army and was dismissed from the institution for allegedly participating in circumcision ceremonies (in Hebrew, [[brit milah]]) of the students of the Israelite Theological Institute of Porto, which the Council considered "immoral" act, which is actually a fundamental practice for the Jewish people.

A year later, in 1938, Barros Basto saw the inauguration of his great project, the [[Kadoorie Synagogue]] in Porto. Its construction was started in 1929 when Barros Basto was able to gather funds to buy land and build. This became the headquarters of the Jewish Community of Porto and still retains its religious functions.

During [[World War II]], having been already dismissed from the army, Barros Basto helped hundreds of Jews escape the war and the [[Holocaust]], allowing them to start a new life elsewhere. Recently the Jewish Community of Porto signed a protocol with the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] in order to provide it with thousands of documents and records of individual [[refugees]], who with the help of Barros Basto could then rebuild their lives with a start point in Porto.

He died in 1961, and was, according to his wish, buried in Amarante, the city where he was born. He was wearing the uniform with which he always served his country. On his deathbed he said that one day there would be justice, but this justice only would come in 2012, over 50 years after his death.

==Rehabilitation==

Following a petition presented to [[Parliament]] on 31 October 2011 by his granddaughter, Isabel Ferreira Lopes, the name of Barros Basto was rehabilitated to February 29, 2012.

The petition, which was approved unanimously by all political parties, presents the conclusion that Barros Basto’s dismissal from the army was a matter of political and [[religious segregation]] on account of being Jewish. "Barros Basto was separated from the Army due to a general climate of animosity against him motivated by the fact of being a Jew" - can be read in the document that the LUSA news agency had access to.

In turn, the Resolution of the [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|Assembly of the Republic]] n. º 119/2012, of 10-08, urged the government to undertake a symbolic reintegration of Barros Basto in the Army, posthumously, "by no means in a category lower than the person concerned would have been entitled to had he not been dismissed"[http://dre.pt/pdf1sdip/2012/08/15500/0431304313.pdf]

Isabel Ferreira Lopes, granddaughter of Barros Basto and Vice President of the Jewish Community of Porto stated to LUSA that after the rehabilitation of her grandfather’s memory, the next step was the rehabilitation of Porto’s synagogue: "In the year of the rehabilitation of the founder of the Jewish Community of Porto the synagogue shall as well be rehabilitated.”

The '''Buddhist calendar''' is a set of [[lunisolar calendar]]s primarily used in [[mainland Southeast Asia]]n countries of [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], [[Myanmar]] and [[Thailand]] as well as in [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese populations]] of [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]] for religious or official occasions. While the calendars share a common lineage, they also have minor but important variations such as [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalation]] schedules, month names and numbering, use of cycles, etc. In Thailand, the name Buddhist Era is a [[Calendar era|year numbering]] system shared by the traditional [[Thai lunar calendar|Thai lunisolar calendar]] and by the [[Thai solar calendar]].

The Southeast Asian lunisolar calendars are largely based on an older version of the [[Hindu calendar]], which uses the [[sidereal year]] as the solar year. One major difference is that the Southeast Asian systems, unlike their Indian cousins, do not use apparent reckoning to stay in sync with the sidereal year. Instead, they employ their versions of the [[Metonic cycle]]. However, since the Metonic cycle is not very accurate for sidereal years, the Southeast Asian calendar is slowly drifting out of sync with the sidereal, approximately one day every 100 years. Yet no coordinated structural reforms of the lunisolar calendar have been undertaken.

Today, the traditional Buddhist lunisolar calendar is used mainly for [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhist]] festivals, and no longer has the official calendar status anywhere. The Thai Buddhist Era, a renumbered [[Gregorian calendar]], is the official calendar in Thailand.

==Structure==

{{See also|Burmese calendar#Structure}}
The calculation methodology of the current versions of Southeast Asian Buddhist calendars is largely based on that of the [[Burmese calendar]], which was in use in various Southeast Asian kingdoms down to the 19th century under the names of [[Chula Sakarat]] and [[Jolak Sakaraj]]. The Burmese calendar in turn was based on the "original" ''[[Surya Siddhanta]]'' system of ancient India (believed to be Ardharatrika school).&lt;ref name=yo-354-355&gt;Ohashi 2007: 354–355&lt;/ref&gt; One key difference with Indian systems is that the Burmese system has followed a variation of the [[Metonic cycle]]. It is unclear from where, when or how the Metonic system was introduced; hypotheses range from China to Europe.&lt;ref group=note&gt;(Ohashi 2001: 398–399):  Astronomers of ancient India certainly knew of the Metonic cycle, and may have introduced the concept to Southeast Asia. However, the Metonic cycle, which employs tropical years, is incompatible with sidereal based Hindu calendars, and thus was not (and still is not) used in Hindu calendars. Chatterjee (1998: 151) suggests that the Metonic system was introduced to Burma by Europeans. Ohashi (2001: 398–399) rejects Chatterjee's hypothesis saying that "no other trace of European influence is found in South-East Asian astronomy." Instead, Ohashi (2001: 401–403) suggests that China may have been the source of the Metonic cycle.&lt;/ref&gt; The Burmese system, and indeed the Southeast Asian systems, thus use a "strange" combination of [[sidereal year]]s from Indian calendar in combination with the Metonic cycle better for [[tropical year]]s.&lt;ref name=yo-2001-398-399&gt;Ohashi 2001: 398–399&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epochal date===
In all Theravada traditions, the calendar's epochal [[year 0]] date was the day in which the [[Buddha]] attained ''[[Parinirvana|parinibbāna]]''. However, not all traditions agree on when it actually took place. In [[Buddhism in Burma|Burmese Buddhist]] tradition, it was 13 May 544 BCE (Tuesday, Full moon of Kason 148 Anjanasakaraj).&lt;ref name=my-1-38&gt;Kala Vol. 1 2006: 38&lt;/ref&gt; But in Thailand, it was 11 March 545 BCE, the date which the current Thai lunisolar and solar calendars use as the epochal date. Yet, the Thai calendars for some reason have fixed the difference between their Buddhist Era (BE) numbering and the Christian/Common Era (CE) numbering at 543,&lt;ref name=jce-1995-15-16&gt;Eade 1995: 15-16&lt;/ref&gt; which points to an epochal year of 544 BCE, not 545 BCE. In Myanmar, the difference between BE and CE can be 543 or 544 for CE dates, and 544 or 543 for BCE dates, depending on the month of the Buddhist Era (as the Buddhist calendar straddles the Gregorian calendar—currently from April to April). In Sri Lanka, the difference between BE and CE is 544.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://collect.ceylanka.net/itempage.asp?col=st10&amp;pg=4&amp;prod=SS-LK-00470&amp;dum=6 | title=Vesak 2005 &amp;#124; Ceylon Sri Lanka Stamp SS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Month===

====Types====
The calendar recognizes two types of months: [[synodic month]] and [[sidereal month]].&lt;ref name=jcc-56-57/&gt; The Synodic months are used to compose the years while the 27 lunar sidereal days (Sanskrit: ''[[nakshatra]]''), alongside the 12 signs of the zodiac, are used for astrological calculations.&lt;ref name=ambi-8-9&gt;Irwin 1909: 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; (The Burmese calendar also recognizes a solar month called ''Thuriya Matha'', which is defined as 1/12th of a year.&lt;ref name=ambi-5&gt;Irwin 1909: 5&lt;/ref&gt; But the solar month varies by the type of year such as tropical year, sidereal year, etc.)

====Waxing and waning====
The days of the month are counted in two halves, waxing and waning. The 15th of the waxing is the civil full moon day. The civil new moon day is the last day of the month (14th or 15th waning). Because of the inaccuracy of the calendrical calculation systems, the mean and real (true) New Moons rarely coincide. The mean New Moon often precedes the real New Moon.&lt;ref name=jcc-56-57&gt;Clancy 1906: 56–57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ambi-8-9/&gt;

====Month numbering====
Various regional versions of Chula Sakarat/Burmese calendar existed across various regions of mainland Southeast Asia. Unlike Burmese systems, Kengtung, Lan Na, Lan Xang and Sukhothai systems refer to the months by numbers, not by names. This means reading ancient texts and inscriptions in Thailand requires constant vigilance, not just in making sure one is correctly operating for the correct region, but also for variations within regions itself when incursions cause a variation in practice.&lt;ref name=jce-1989-9-10&gt;Eade 1989: 9–10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jce-1995-28-29&gt;Eade 1995: 28–29&lt;/ref&gt; However, Cambodian (Khmer) month system, which begins with Margasirsa as the first month, demonstrated precisely by the names and numbers.&lt;ref name="cam-cc.org"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cam-cc.org/calendar/chhankitek.php | title=Khmer Calendar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Year===
The Buddhist calendar is a [[lunisolar calendar]] in which the months are based on [[lunar month]]s and years are based on [[solar year]]s. One of its primary objectives is to synchronize the lunar part with the solar part. The lunar months, normally twelve of them, consist alternately of 29 days and 30 days, such that a normal lunar year will contain 354 days, as opposed to the solar year of ~365.25 days. Therefore, some form of addition to the lunar year (of intercalation) is necessary. The overall basis for it is provided by cycles of 57 years. Eleven extra days are inserted in every 57 years, and seven extra months of 30 days are inserted in every 19 years (21 months in 57 years). This provides 20819 complete days to both calendars.&lt;ref name=jce-1995-15&gt;Eade 1995: 15&lt;/ref&gt; This 57-year cycle would provide a mean year of about 365.2456 days and a mean month of about 29.530496 days, if not corrected.

As such, the calendar adds an [[intercalary month]] in [[leap year]]s and sometimes also an [[leap day|intercalary day]] in great leap years. The intercalary month not only corrects the length of the year but also corrects the accumulating error of the month to extent of half a day. The average length of the month is further corrected by adding a day to Nayon at irregular intervals—a little more than seven times in two cycles (39 years). The intercalary day is never inserted except in a year which has an intercalary month.&lt;ref name=ambi-8-9/&gt; The Hindu calendar inserts an intercalary month at any time of year as soon as the accumulated fractions amount to one month. The Burmese calendar however always inserts the intercalary month at the same time of the year, after the [[summer solstice]] while the Arakanese calendar inserts it after the [[vernal equinox]].&lt;ref name=ambi-2-3&gt;Irwin 1909: 2–3&lt;/ref&gt;

====Burmese====
The actual Burmese calendar year consists of 354, 384 or 385 days.

Note: The [[Arakanese calendar]] adds the intercalary day in Tagu, not in Nayon.

====Cambodian, Lao and Thai====
The Cambodian, Lao and Thai lunar calendars use a slightly different method to place the intercalary day. Instead of it in a leap year as in the Burmese system, the Thai system places it in a separate year. Thus, the Thai small leap year has 355 days while the Thai great leap year has 384 days.&lt;ref name="jce-1989-9-10" /&gt;

===New Year's Day===
Since the main purpose of Buddhist calendar is to keep pace with the solar year, the new year is always marked by the [[solar year]], which falls at the time when the Sun enters [[Aries (astrology)|Aries]].&lt;ref name=jcc-56-57/&gt; The date, which at the present falls on the 17th of April, has slowly drifted over the centuries. In the 20th century, the New Year's Day fell on April 15 or 16th but in the 17th century, it fell on April 9 or 10th.&lt;ref name=jce-1989-xx&gt;Eade 1989: 135–145, 165–175&lt;/ref&gt; Thailand and Cambodia no longer use the traditional lunisolar calendar to mark the New Year's Day.

====Ten-year cycle system====
In Cambodia, there is the sequence of year, which numbered from one to ten, used to identify a particular year, called "'''Sak'''" ([[Khmer language|Khmer]]: ស័ក) that means "'''era'''". It begins with a prefix "Aek, tor or trei", which means one, two or three respectively (using [[Indian numerals|numerals]] that were derived from the Sanskrit language) then the suffix "Sak" is added to each prefix so as to form a word of the year. Cambodian use the Sak system to differentiate the twelve animal years that return every twelve year by including the ten-year system along with the animal year system. For instance, in 2017, the ten-year and animal year fall in the year of Rooster,  Nuppasak (era 9),  Buddhist Era of 2561 (based on Cambodian lunar calendar).&lt;ref name="cam-cc.org"/&gt;

==Accuracy==
{{see also|Burmese calendar#Accuracy}}
The Southeast Asian Buddhist calendars use lunar months but try to keep pace with the solar year, by inserting intercalary months and days on the Metonic cycle (in the case of the Burmese calendar, on a modified Metonic cycle). However, the solar year as defined by the Buddhist calendars is really a [[sidereal year]], which is nearly 24 minutes longer than the actual mean [[tropical year]]. Therefore, like all sidereal-based calendars, the lunisolar calendars are slowly drifting away from the seasons.&lt;ref name=ambi-26-27&gt;Irwin 1909: 26–27&lt;/ref&gt; The calendars are drifting one day approximately every 60 years and 4 months.

The accumulating drift against the seasons means the New Year's Day which used to fall on 22 March (near the [[vernal equinox]]) in 638 CE now falls on 17 April in 2013 CE. There is no known internationally concerted effort to stop this drift. Thailand has moved its "Buddhist Era" to the Gregorian calendar under the name of [[Thai solar calendar]]. In Myanmar, Burmese calendarists have tried to deal with the issue by periodically modifying the intercalation schedule in the Metonic cycle. One major downside of this approach is that it is not possible to publish future calendars more than a few years (often even a year) ahead.&lt;ref group=note&gt;(Irwin 1909: 26–27): In the mid-19th century, the Burmese [[Konbaung Dynasty]] tried to address the issue by introducing a new calculation methodology. However, the new solar year it chose was actually 0.56 second a year ''less'' accurate than the version still prevalent in the rest of Southeast Asia. The Konbaung court also modified the Metonic cycle, which did more to re-synchronize the calendar with the seasons than the less accurate solar year.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buddhist Era was first introduced to Southeast Asia along with Buddhism in the early centuries CE. It was not a separate calendar but simply a [[Calendar era|year numbering system]] that employed the organization and calculation methods of the prevailing lunisolar calendars in use throughout the region. In the early centuries CE, the reference civil calendar of the Buddhist calendar prevalent in Southeast Asia was the [[Shalivahana era|Saka Era (Mahāsakaraj Era)]], which is said to have been adopted by the [[Pyu city-states|Pyu state]] of [[Sri Ksetra Kingdom|Sri Ksetra]] in 80 CE. The Saka Era was gradually replaced by the [[Burmese calendar|Burmese Era]] or Culāsakaraj, first in Myanmar in 640 CE,&lt;ref name=hy-1-216&gt;Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 216&lt;/ref&gt; and in other Theravada kingdoms of Southeast Asia between the 13th and 16th centuries.&lt;ref group=note&gt;(Eade 1989: 11): The earliest use of the Burmese calendar in lands part of present-day Thailand dates to the mid-13th century. (Smith 1966: 11): Ayutthaya adopted the Burmese calendar in the 16th century.&lt;/ref&gt; Theravada Buddhist tradition also recognizes pre-Buddhist Anjana Sakaraj (Añjana's Era) since the events of the Buddha's life are recorded in that era.&lt;ref name=my-1-38/&gt;

The tradition of using different reference calendars continued in Siam in 1912 when King [[Vajiravudh]] decreed that the Buddhist Era would now track the [[Thai solar calendar]], the Siamese version of the [[Gregorian calendar]] with the New Year's Day of 1 April. Therefore, the Thai Buddhist Era year of 2455 began on 1 April 1912 (as opposed to 15 April 1912 according to the lunisolar calendar&lt;ref name=jce-1989-166&gt;Eade 1989: 166&lt;/ref&gt;). The Thai Buddhist Era was further realigned to the Gregorian calendar on 6 September 1940 when Prime Minister [[Phibunsongkhram]] decreed 1 January 1941 as the start of the year 2484 BE. As a result, the Year 2483 was only 9 months long, and the Thai Buddhist Era equals that of the [[Common Era]] plus 543 years.

==Current usage==
The lunisolar calendar is used to mark important Buddhist holidays. Many of the holidays are celebrated as public holidays.

{{Buddhism}}
'''Buddhist cosmology''' is the description of the shape and evolution of the [[Universe]] according to the [[Buddhist]] [[Tripitaka|scriptures]] and [[Atthakatha|commentaries]]. 

It consists of temporal and spatial cosmology, the temporal cosmology being the division of the existence of a 'world' into four discrete moments (the creation, duration, dissolution, and state of being dissolved; this does not seem to be a canonical division, however). The spatial cosmology consists of a vertical cosmology, the various planes of beings, their bodies, characteristics, food, lifespan, beauty and a horizontal cosmology, the distribution of these world-systems into an "apparently" infinite sheet of universes. The existence of world-periods (moments, kalpas), is well attested to by the Buddha.&lt;ref name="sevensuns"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Authors|first1=Various|title=Aṅguttara Nikāya 007.

==Introduction==
The self-consistent Buddhist cosmology, which is presented in commentaries and works of [[Abhidharma]] in both [[Theravada|Theravāda]] and [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] traditions, is the end-product of an analysis and reconciliation of cosmological comments found in the Buddhist [[sutra|sūtra]] and [[vinaya]] traditions. No single sūtra sets out the entire structure of the universe, but in several sūtras the Buddha describes other worlds and states of being, and other sūtras describe the origin and destruction of the universe. The synthesis of these data into a single comprehensive system must have taken place early in the history of Buddhism, as the system described in the [[Pāli]] [[Vibhajjavada|Vibhajyavāda]] tradition (represented by today's Theravādins) agrees, despite some minor inconsistencies of nomenclature, with the [[Sarvastivada|Sarvāstivāda]] tradition which is preserved by Mahāyāna Buddhists.&lt;ref name=Gethin&gt;{{cite book|last=Gethin|first=Rupert|title=The Foundations of Buddhism|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-289223-1|pages=Chapter 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The picture of the world presented in Buddhist cosmological descriptions cannot be taken as a literal description of the shape of the [[universe]].  It is inconsistent, and cannot be made consistent, with astronomical data that were already known in ancient India.   However, it is not intended to be a description of how ordinary humans perceive their world;&lt;ref name=Gethin/&gt; rather, it is the universe as seen through the [[Abhijñā|{{IAST|divyacakṣus}}]] (Pāli: dibbacakkhu दिव्यचक्ख्खु), the "divine eye" by which a [[Buddhahood|Buddha]] or an [[arhat]] who has cultivated this faculty can perceive all of the other worlds and the beings arising (being born) and passing away (dying) within them, and can tell from what state they have been [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|reborn]] and into what state they will be reborn.  The cosmology has also been interpreted in a symbolical or allegorical sense (for Mahayana teaching see [[Ten spiritual realms]]).

Buddhist cosmology can be divided into two related kinds: spatial cosmology, which describes the arrangement of the various worlds within the universe; and temporal cosmology, which describes how those worlds come into existence, and how they pass away.

==Spatial cosmology==
Spatial cosmology displays the various, multitude of worlds embedded in the universe. Spatial cosmology can also be divided into two branches.  The ''vertical'' (or {{IAST|cakravāla; देवनागरीः चक्रवाल}}) cosmology describes the arrangement of worlds in a vertical pattern, some being higher and some lower.  By contrast, the ''horizontal'' (sahasra) cosmology describes the grouping of these vertical worlds into sets of thousands, millions or billions.

===Vertical cosmology===
"In the vertical cosmology, the universe exists of many worlds ({{IAST|lokāḥ; देवानागरीः लोक/लोको}}) – one might say "planes/realms" – stacked one upon the next in layers. Each world corresponds to a mental state or a state of being"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thezenuniverse.org/buddhist-cosmology/|title=Buddhist cosmology - The Zen Universe|date=2016-11-01|work=The Zen Universe|access-date=2018-10-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  A world is not, however, a location so much as it is the beings which compose it; it is sustained by their [[Karma in Buddhism|karma]] and if the beings in a world all die or disappear, the world disappears too.  Likewise, a world comes into existence when the first being is born into it.  The physical separation is not so important as the difference in mental state; humans and animals, though they partially share the same physical environments, still belong to different worlds because their minds perceive and react to those environments differently.

The vertical cosmology is divided into thirty-one planes of existence and the planes into three realms, or '''dhātus''', each corresponding to a different type of mentality.  These three realms (Tridhātu) are the Ārūpyadhātu (4 Realms), the Rūpadhātu (16 Realms), and the Kāmadhātu (15 Realms). This Sakwala/solar system or plane of existence comprises the "five or six desire realms". In some instances all of the beings born in the Ārūpyadhātu and the Rūpadhātu are informally classified as "gods" or "deities" ('''[[Deva (Buddhism)|{{IAST|devāḥ}}]]'''), along with the gods of the Kāmadhātu, notwithstanding the fact that the deities of the Kāmadhātu differ more from those of the Ārūpyadhātu than they do from humans. It is to be understood that '''deva''' is an imprecise term referring to any being living in a longer-lived and generally more blissful state than humans.  Most of them are not "gods" in the common sense of the term, having little or no concern with the human world and rarely if ever interacting with it; only the lowest deities of the Kāmadhātu correspond to the gods described in many [[polytheism|polytheistic]] religions.

The term "[[Brahma (Buddhism)|brahmā; देवनागरीः ब्रह्मा]]" is used both as a name and as a generic term for one of the higher devas.  In its broadest sense, it can refer to any of the inhabitants of the Ārūpyadhātu and the Rūpadhātu. In more restricted senses, it can refer to an inhabitant of one of the eleven lower worlds of the Rūpadhātu, or in its narrowest sense, to the three lowest worlds of the Rūpadhātu (Plane of Brahma’s retinue) A large number of devas use the name "Brahmā", e.g. Brahmā Sahampati सहम्पत्ति महाब्रह्मा, Brahmā Sanatkumāra ब्रह्मा सनतकुमार, Baka Brahmā बक ब्रह्मा, etc. It is not always clear which world they belong to, although it must always be one of the worlds of the Rūpadhātu. According to the Ayacana Sutta, Brahmā Sahampati, who begs the Buddha to teach Dhamma to the world, resides in the Śuddhāvāsa worlds.

====Formless Realm (Ārūpyadhātu अरुपधातु)====
The '''Ārūpyadhātu''' ([[Sanskrit]]) or '''Arūpaloka''' ([[Pāli]]) ([[Tibetic languages|Tib:]] ''gzugs med pa'i khams''; Chinese: 无色界/無色界;[[Japanese language|Jpn]]: 無色界 ''Mushiki-kai''; देवनागरीः अरुपधातु / अरुपलोक) or "Formless realm" would have no place in a purely physical cosmology, as none of the beings inhabiting it has either shape or location; and correspondingly, the realm has no location either.  This realm belongs to those devas who attained and remained in the Four Formless Absorptions ({{IAST|catuḥ-samāpatti चतु-समापत्ती}}) of the [[Arupajhana|arūpadhyānas]] in a previous life, and now enjoys the fruits ([[vipaka|vipāka]]) of the good karma of that accomplishment.  [[Bodhisattva]]s, however, are never born in the Ārūpyadhātu even when they have attained the arūpadhyānas.

There are four types of Ārūpyadhātu devas, corresponding to the four types of arūpadhyānas:

=====Arupa Bhumi (Arupachara Brahmalokas or Immaterial/Formless Brahma Realms)=====
* '''{{IAST|Naivasaṃjñānāsaṃjñāyatana}}''' or '''Nevasaññānāsaññāyatana''' (Tib: '' 'du shes med 'du shes med min''; Jpn: 非有想非無想処; देवनागरीः  नैवसंज्ञानासंज्ञायातन) "Sphere of neither perception nor non-perception". In this sphere the formless beings have gone beyond a mere negation of perception and have attained a liminal state where they do not engage in "perception" ([[samjna|{{IAST|saṃjñā}}]], recognition of particulars by their marks) but are not wholly unconscious.  This was the sphere reached by Udraka Rāmaputra (Pāli: Uddaka Rāmaputta), the second of [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]]'s original teachers, who considered it equivalent to enlightenment. Total life span on this realm in human years - 84,000 Maha Kalpa (Maha Kalpa = 4 Asankya Kalpa). This realm is placed 5,580,000 Yojanas ( 1 Yojana = 16 Miles) above the Plane of Nothingness (Akiknchaknkayatana).
* '''{{IAST|Ākiṃcanyāyatana}}''' or '''Ākiñcaññāyatana''' (Tib: ''ci yang med''; Chinese: 无所有处/無所有處; Jpn: 無所有処 ''mu sho u sho''; देवनागरीः अकिञ्चानयातन) "Sphere of Nothingness" (literally "lacking anything"). In this sphere formless beings dwell contemplating upon the thought that "there is no thing".  This is considered a form of perception, though a very subtle one.  This was the sphere reached by {{IAST|Ārāḍa Kālāma}} (Pāli: {{IAST|Āḷāra Kālāma}}), the first of [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]]'s original teachers; he considered it to be equivalent to enlightenment. Total life span on this realm in human years - 60,000 Maha Kalpa. This realm is placed 5,580,000 yojanas above the Plane of Infinite Consciousness(Viknknanaknchayathana).
* '''Vijñānānantyāyatana''' or '''{{IAST|Viññāṇānañcāyatana}}''' or more commonly the contracted form '''{{IAST|Viññāṇañcāyatana}}''' (Tib: ''rnam shes mtha' yas''; Chinese: 识无边处/識無邊處; Jpn: 識無辺処 ''shiki mu hen jo''; देवनागरीः विज्ञानायातन) "Sphere of Infinite Consciousness".  In this sphere formless beings dwell meditating on their consciousness ([[vijnana|vijñāna]]) as infinitely pervasive. Total life span on this realm in human years - 40,000 Maha Kalpa. This realm is placed 5,580,000 yojanas above the Plane of Infinite Space(Akasanknayathanaya)
* '''Ākāśānantyāyatana''' or '''Ākāsānañcāyatana''' (Tib: ''nam mkha' mtha' yas''; Chinese: 空无边处/空無邊處;Jpn: 空無辺処 ''kū mu hen jo''; देवनागरीः अाकाशनायातन) "Sphere of Infinite Space". In this sphere formless beings dwell meditating upon space or extension (ākāśa) as infinitely pervasive. Total life span on this realm in human years - 20,000 Maha Kalpa. This realm is placed 5,580,000 yojanas above the Akanita Brahma Loka — Highest plane of pure abodes.

====Form Realm (Rūpadhātu)====
The Rūpadhātu (Pāli: Rūpaloka; Tib: ''gzugs kyi khams''; Chinese: 色界; Jpn: 色界 ''Shiki-kai''; देवानागरीः रुपलोक/रुपधातु) or "Form realm" is, as the name implies, the first of the physical realms; its inhabitants all have a location and bodies of a sort, though those bodies are composed of a subtle substance which is of itself invisible to the inhabitants of the Kāmadhātu. According to the Janavasabha Sutta, when a brahma (a being from the Brahma-world of the Rūpadhātu) wishes to visit a deva of the {{IAST|Trāyastriṃśa}} heaven (in the Kāmadhātu), he has to assume a "grosser form" in order to be visible to them. There are 17-22 Rūpadhātu in Buddhism texts, the most common saying is 18.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.china2551.org/Article/fjll/dc/200908/10047.html 佛教对于彼岸世界的想像及其对中土的影响——王青]&lt;/ref&gt;

The beings of the Form realm are not subject to the extremes of pleasure and pain, or governed by desires for things pleasing to the senses, as the beings of the Kāmadhātu are.  The bodies of Form realm beings do not have sexual distinctions.

Like the beings of the Ārūpyadhātu, the dwellers in the Rūpadhātu have minds corresponding to the [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyānas]] (Pāli: jhānas).  In their case it is the four lower dhyānas or [[Rupajhana|rūpadhyānas॥रुपध्यान]].  However, although the beings of the Rūpadhātu can be divided into four broad grades corresponding to these four dhyānas, each of them is subdivided into further grades, three for each of the four dhyānas and five for the Śuddhāvāsa devas, for a total of seventeen grades (the Theravāda tradition counts one less grade in the highest dhyāna for a total of sixteen).

Physically, the Rūpadhātu consists of a series of planes stacked on top of each other, each one in a series of steps half the size of the previous one as one descends. In part, this reflects the fact that the devas are also thought of as physically larger on the higher planes.  The highest planes are also broader in extent than the ones lower down, as discussed in the section on ''[[Buddhist cosmology#Sahasra cosmology|Sahasra cosmology]]''.  The height of these planes is expressed in ''yojanas'', a measurement of very uncertain length, but sometimes taken to be about 4,000 times the height of a man, and so approximately {{convert|4.54|mi|km}}.

=====Pure Abodes=====
The Śuddhāvāsa (Pāli: Suddhāvāsa; Tib: ''gnas gtsang ma''; Chinese: 净居天/凈居天; देवनागरीः शुद्धावास) worlds, or "[[Pure Abodes]]", are distinct from the other worlds of the Rūpadhātu in that they do not house beings who have been born there through ordinary merit or meditative attainments, but only those [[Four stages of enlightenment#Non-returner|Anāgāmins]] ("Non-returners") who are already on the path to [[Arhat]]-hood and who will attain enlightenment directly from the Śuddhāvāsa worlds without being reborn in a lower plane.  Every Śuddhāvāsa deva is therefore a protector of Buddhism. ([[Brahma Sahampati]], who appealed to the newly enlightened Buddha to teach, was an Anagami under the previous Buddha&lt;ref&gt;Susan Elbaum Jootla "Teacher of the Devas": The Wheel Publication No. 414/416 (Kandy: Buddhist Publication Society, 1997) [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/jootla/wheel414.html article link at Access to Insight] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204142247/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/jootla/wheel414.html |date=February 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). Because a Śuddhāvāsa deva will never be reborn outside the Śuddhāvāsa worlds, no [[Bodhisattva]] is ever born in these worlds, as a [[Bodhisattva]] must ultimately be reborn as a human being.

Since these devas rise from lower planes only due to the teaching of a Buddha, they can remain empty for very long periods if no Buddha arises.  However, unlike the lower worlds, the Śuddhāvāsa worlds are never destroyed by natural catastrophe. The Śuddhāvāsa devas predict the coming of a Buddha and, taking the guise of Brahmins, reveal to human beings the signs by which a Buddha can be recognized. They also ensure that a Bodhisattva in his last life will see the four signs that will lead to his renunciation.

The five Śuddhāvāsa worlds are:
* '''{{IAST|Akaniṣṭha}}''' or '''{{IAST|Akaniṭṭha; देवनागरीः अकनिठ्ठ / अकनिष्ठ}}''' – World of devas "equal in rank" (literally: having no one as the youngest). The highest of all the Rūpadhātu worlds, it is often used to refer to the highest extreme of the universe.  The current [[Śakra (Buddhism)|Śakra]] will eventually be born there.  The duration of life in {{IAST|Akaniṣṭha}} is 16,000 kalpas (Vibhajyavāda tradition). [[Mahesvara]] ([[Shiva]]) the ruler of the three realms of [[samsara]] is said to dwell here.&lt;ref&gt;Ruthless Compassion: Wrathful Deities in Early Indo-Tibetan Esoteric Buddhist Art by Robert N. Linrothe, Pg.180 [https://books.google.co.in/books?id=AdtYxZoG228C&amp;pg=PA180#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; The height of this world is 167,772,160 yojanas above the Earth (approximately the distance of Saturn from Earth).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/525169/Saturn|title=Saturn {{!}} planet|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-06-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Sudarśana सुर्दशन''' or '''Sudassīसुदस्सी''' – The "clear-seeing" devas live in a world similar to and friendly with the {{IAST|Akaniṣṭha}} world. The height of this world is 83,886,080 yojanas above the Earth (approximately the distance of Jupiter from Earth).
* '''{{IAST|Sudṛśa सुर्दश}}''' or '''Sudassa सुदस्स''' – The world of the "beautiful" devas are said to be the place of rebirth for five kinds of anāgāmins. The height of this world is 41,943,040 yojanas above the Earth.
* '''Atapaअताप''' or '''Atappaअतप्प''' – The world of the "untroubled" devas, whose company those of lower realms wish for. The height of this world is 20,971,520 yojanas above the Earth (approximately the distance of Sun from Earth).
* '''{{IAST|Avṛhaअभ्रह}}''' or '''Avihaअभिह''' – The world of the "not falling" devas, perhaps the most common destination for reborn Anāgāmins.  Many achieve arhatship directly in this world, but some pass away and are reborn in sequentially higher worlds of the Pure Abodes until they are at last reborn in the {{IAST|Akaniṣṭha}} world. These are called in Pāli {{IAST|uddhaṃsotas}}, "those whose stream goes upward".  The duration of life in {{IAST|Avṛha}} is 1,000 kalpas (Vibhajyavāda tradition). The height of this world is 10,485,760 yojanas above the Earth (approximately the distance of Mars from Earth).

=====Bṛhatphala worlds भ्रतफल =====
The mental state of the devas of the {{IAST|Bṛhatphala}} worlds (Chn: 四禅九天/四禪九天; Jpn: {{lang|ja|四禅九天}}) corresponds to the fourth dhyāna, and is characterized by equanimity ([[Upeksa|{{IAST|upekṣā}}]]).  The {{IAST|Bṛhatphala}} worlds form the upper limit to the destruction of the universe by wind at the end of a mahākalpa (see [[Buddhist cosmology#Temporal cosmology|Temporal cosmology]] below), that is, they are spared such destruction.
* '''Asaññasatta अासनसत्त''' (Sanskrit: {{IAST|Asaṃjñasattva असम्जनासत्व}}) (Vibhajyavāda tradition only) – "Unconscious beings", devas who have attained a high dhyāna (similar to that of the Formless Realm), and, wishing to avoid the perils of perception, have achieved a state of non-perception in which they endure for a time.  After a while, however, perception arises again and they fall into a lower state.
* '''{{IAST|Bṛhatphalaभ्रतफल}}''' or '''Vehapphala वेहफल''' (Tib: '' 'bras bu che'') – Devas "having great fruit".  Their lifespan is 500 mahākalpas. (Vibhajyavāda tradition).  Some [[Four stages of enlightenment#Non-returner|Anāgāmins]] are reborn here. The height of this world is 5,242,880 yojanas above the Earth.(approximately the distance of Venus from Earth)
* '''{{IAST|Puṇyaprasava पुण्यप्रसभ}}''' (Sarvāstivāda tradition only; Tib: ''bsod nams skyes'';देवनागरीः पुन्यप्रसभ) – The world of the devas who are the "offspring of merit". The height of this world is 2,621,440 yojanas above the Earth.
* '''Anabhrakaअनभक्र''' (Sarvāstivāda tradition only; Tib: ''sprin med''; देवनागरीः अनभ्राक) – The world of the "cloudless" devas. The height of this world is 1,310,720 yojanas above the Earth.

====={{IAST|Śubhakṛtsna}} worlds=====
The mental state of the devas of the {{IAST|Śubhakṛtsna}} worlds (Chn/Jpn: 三禅三天; देवनागरीः शुभक्षण) corresponds to the third dhyāna, and is characterized by a quiet joy ([[sukha]]).  These devas have bodies that radiate a steady light. The {{IAST|Śubhakṛtsna}} worlds form the upper limit to the destruction of the universe by water at the end of a mahākalpa (see [[Buddhist cosmology#Temporal cosmology|Temporal cosmology]] below), that is, the flood of water does not rise high enough to reach them.
* '''{{IAST|Śubhakṛtsna}}''' or '''{{IAST|Subhakiṇṇa / Subhakiṇha}}''' (Tib: ''dge rgyas'';देवनागरीः शुभक्षिण्ण) – The world of devas of "total beauty".  Their lifespan is 64 mahākalpas (some sources: 4 mahākalpas) according to the Vibhajyavāda tradition.  64 mahākalpas is the interval between destructions of the universe by wind, including the {{IAST|Śubhakṛtsna}} worlds. The height of this world is 655,360 yojanas above the Earth.
* '''{{IAST|Apramāṇaśubha}}''' or '''{{IAST|Appamāṇasubha}}''' (Tib: ''tshad med dge'';देवनागरीः अप्रमाणशुभ) – The world of devas of "limitless beauty". Their lifespan is 32 mahākalpas (Vibhajyavāda tradition). They possess "faith, virtue, learning, munificence and wisdom". The height of this world is 327,680 yojanas above the Earth.
* '''Parīttaśubha''' or '''Parittasubha''' (Tib: ''dge chung''; देवनागरीः परित्तशुभ) – The world of devas of "limited beauty". Their lifespan is 16 mahākalpas. The height of this world is 163,840 yojanas above the Earth.

=====Ābhāsvara worlds=====
The mental state of the devas of the [[Abhasvaras|Ābhāsvara]] worlds (Chn/Jpn: 二禅三天; देवनागरीः अभश्वभारा) corresponds to the second dhyāna, and is characterized by delight ([[Pīti|prīti]]) as well as joy ([[sukha]]); the Ābhāsvara devas are said to shout aloud in their joy, crying ''aho sukham!'' ("Oh joy!").  These devas have bodies that emit flashing rays of light like lightning. They are said to have similar bodies (to each other) but diverse perceptions.

The Ābhāsvara worlds form the upper limit to the destruction of the universe by fire at the end of a mahākalpa (see [[Buddhist cosmology#Temporal cosmology|Temporal cosmology]] below), that is, the column of fire does not rise high enough to reach them.  After the destruction of the world, at the beginning of the vivartakalpa, the worlds are first populated by beings reborn from the Ābhāsvara worlds.
* '''Ābhāsvara''' or '''Ābhassara''' (Tib: '' 'od gsal''; देवनागरीः अभासभारा / अव्भसार) – The world of devas "possessing splendor".  The lifespan of the Ābhāsvara devas is 8 mahākalpas (others: 2 mahākalpas).  Eight mahākalpas is the interval between destructions of the universe by water, which includes the Ābhāsvara worlds. The height of this world is 81,920 yojanas above the Earth.
* '''{{IAST|Apramāṇābha}}''' or '''{{IAST|Appamāṇābha}}''' (Tib: ''tshad med 'od''; देवनागरीः अप्रमानभ) – The world of devas of "limitless light", a concept on which they meditate.  Their lifespan is 4 mahākalpas. The height of this world is 40,960 yojanas above the Earth.
* '''Parīttābha''' or '''Parittābha''' (Tib: '' 'od chung''; परितव्भ) – The world of devas of "limited light". Their lifespan is 2 mahākalpas. The height of this world is 20,480 yojanas above the Earth.

=====Brahmā worlds=====
{{Main|Brahma (Buddhism)}}
The mental state of the devas of the Brahmā worlds (Chn/Jpn: 初禅三天; ब्रह्मलोक) corresponds to the first dhyāna, and is characterized by observation ([[Vitakka|vitarka]]) and reflection ([[Vicara|vicāra]]) as well as delight ([[Pīti|prīti]]) and joy ([[sukha]]).  The Brahmā worlds, together with the other lower worlds of the universe, are destroyed by fire at the end of a mahākalpa (see [[Buddhist cosmology#Temporal cosmology|Temporal cosmology]] below).
* '''Mahābrahmā''' (Tib: ''tshangs pa chen po''; Chn/Jpn: 大梵天 ''Daibonten''; देवनागरीः महाब्रह्मा) – the world of "Great Brahmā", believed by many to be the creator of the world, and having as his titles "Brahmā, Great Brahmā, the Conqueror, the Unconquered, the All-Seeing, All-Powerful, the Lord, the Maker and Creator, the Ruler, Appointer and Orderer, Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be."  According to the Brahmajāla Sutta (DN.1), a Mahābrahmā is a being from the Ābhāsvara worlds who falls into a lower world through exhaustion of his merits and is reborn alone in the Brahma-world; forgetting his former existence, he imagines himself to have come into existence without cause.  Note that even such a high-ranking deity has no intrinsic knowledge of the worlds above his own. Mahābrahmā is 1 {{Fraction|1|2}} yojanas tall. His lifespan variously said to be 1 kalpa (Vibhajyavāda tradition) or 1 {{Fraction|1|2}} kalpas long (Sarvāstivāda tradition), although it would seem that it could be no longer than {{Fraction|3|4}} of a mahākalpa, i.e., all of the mahākalpa except for the {{IAST|Saṃvartasthāyikalpa}}, because that is the total length of time between the rebuilding of the lower world and its destruction. It is unclear what period of time "kalpa" refers to in this case. The height of this world is 10,240 yojanas above the Earth.
* '''Brahmapurohita''' (Tib: ''tshangs 'khor''; देवनागरीः ब्रह्मपुरोहिता) – the "Ministers of Brahmā" are beings, also originally from the Ābhāsvara worlds, that are born as companions to Mahābrahmā after he has spent some time alone.  Since they arise subsequent to his thought of a desire for companions, he believes himself to be their creator, and they likewise believe him to be their creator and lord.  They are 1 yojana in height and their lifespan is variously said to be {{Fraction|1|2}} of a kalpa (Vibhajyavāda tradition) or a whole kalpa (Sarvāstivāda tradition). If they are later reborn in a lower world, and come to recall some part of their last existence, they teach the doctrine of Brahmā as creator as a revealed truth. The height of this world is 5,120 yojanas above the Earth.
* '''{{IAST|Brahmapāriṣadya}}''' or '''Brahmapārisajja''' (Tib: ''tshangs ris''; देवनागरीः ब्रह्मपरिषद / ब्रह्मपरिष्ज्ज) – the "Councilors of Brahmā" or the devas "belonging to the assembly of Brahmā".  They are also called '''Brahmakāyika''', but this name can be used for any of the inhabitants of the Brahma-worlds. They are half a yojana in height and their lifespan is variously said to be {{Fraction|1|3}} of a kalpa (Vibhajyavāda tradition) or {{Fraction|1|2}} of a kalpa (Sarvāstivāda tradition). The height of this world is 2,560 yojanas above the Earth.

====Desire Realm (Kāmadhātu / कामधातु)====
{{Main|Desire realm}}
The beings born in the Kāmadhātu (Pāli: Kāmaloka; Tib: '' 'dod pa'i khams''; Chn/Jpn: 欲界 ''Yoku-kai''; देवनागरीः कामधातु) differ in degree of happiness, but they are all, other than [[Anagami]]s, [[Arhat]]s and [[Buddhahood|Buddhas]], under the domination of [[Mara (demon)|Māra]] and are bound by sensual desire, which causes them suffering.

=====Heavens=====
The following four worlds are bounded planes, each 80,000 yojanas square, which float in the air above the top of Mount [[Sumeru]].  Although all of the worlds inhabited by devas (that is, all the worlds down to the Cāturmahārājikakāyika world and sometimes including the Asuras) are sometimes called "heavens", in the western sense of the word the term best applies to the four worlds listed below:
* '''Parinirmita-vaśavartin''' or '''Paranimmita-vasavatti''' (Tib: ''gzhan 'phrul dbang byed''; Chn/Jpn: 他化自在天 ''Takejizai-ten''; देवनागरीः परनिमित्त-वशवती) – The heaven of devas "with power over (others') creations".  These devas do not create pleasing forms that they desire for themselves, but their desires are fulfilled by the acts of other devas who wish for their favor.  The ruler of this world is called Vaśavartin (Pāli: Vasavatti), who has longer life, greater beauty, more power and happiness and more delightful sense-objects than the other devas of his world.  This world is also the home of the devaputra (being of divine race) called [[Mara (demon)|Māra]], who endeavors to keep all beings of the Kāmadhātu in the grip of sensual pleasures. Māra is also sometimes called Vaśavartin, but in general these two dwellers of this world are kept distinct. The beings of this world are {{convert|4500|ft|m}} tall and live for 9,216,000,000 years (Sarvāstivāda tradition). The height of this world is 1,280 yojanas above the Earth.
* '''{{IAST|Nirmāṇarati}}''' or Nimmānaratī (Tib: '' 'phrul dga' ''; Chn: 化乐天/化樂天; Jpn: 化楽天 ''Keraku-ten''; देवनागरीः निम्मरथी / निम्मरती)– The world of devas "delighting in their creations".  The devas of this world are capable of making any appearance to please themselves.  The lord of this world is called Sunirmita ([[Pāli]]: Sunimmita); his wife is the rebirth of Visākhā, formerly the chief of the [[Upasaka|upāsikās]] (female lay devotees) of the Buddha. The beings of this world are {{convert|3750|ft|m}} tall and live for 2,304,000,000 years (Sarvāstivāda tradition). The height of this world is 640 yojanas above the Earth.
* '''[[Tushita|{{IAST|Tuṣita}}]]''' or '''Tusita''' (Tib: ''dga' ldan''; Chn/Jpn: 兜率天 ''Tosotsu-ten'';देवनागरीः तुषिता) – The world of the "joyful" devas.  This world is best known for being the world in which a Bodhisattva lives before being reborn in the world of humans. Until a few thousand years ago, the Bodhisattva of this world was Śvetaketu (Pāli: Setaketu), who was reborn as Siddhārtha, who would become the Buddha [[Gautama Buddha|Śākyamuni]]; since then the Bodhisattva has been Nātha (or Nāthadeva) who will be reborn as Ajita and will become the Buddha [[Maitreya]] (Pāli Metteyya).  While this Bodhisattva is the foremost of the dwellers in {{IAST|Tuṣita}}, the ruler of this world is another deva called {{IAST|Santuṣita}} (Pāli: Santusita). The beings of this world are {{convert|3000|ft|m}} tall and live for 576,000,000 years (Sarvāstivāda tradition). The height of this world is 320 yojanas above the Earth.
* '''Yāma''' (Tib: '' 'thab bral''; Chn/Jpn: 夜摩天 ''Yama-ten''; देवनागरीः यामा भुवन / यम लोक) – Sometimes called the "heaven without fighting", because it is the lowest of the heavens to be physically separated from the tumults of the earthly world.  These devas live in the air, free of all difficulties. Its ruler is the deva Suyāma; according to some, his wife is the rebirth of Sirimā, a courtesan of {{IAST|Rājagṛha}} in the Buddha's time who was generous to the monks. The beings of this world are {{convert|2250|ft|m}} tall and live for 144,000,000 years (Sarvāstivāda tradition). The height of this world is 160 yojanas above the Earth.

=====Worlds of Sumeru सुमेरू । सुनेरू=====
{{Main|Sumeru}}
The world-mountain of Sumeru is an immense, strangely shaped peak which arises in the center of the world, and around which the Sun and Moon revolve.  Its base rests in a vast ocean, and it is surrounded by several rings of lesser mountain ranges and oceans.  The three worlds listed below are all located on, or around, Sumeru: the {{IAST|Trāyastriṃśa; देवनागरीः त्रायतीस /त्रायतीम्स}} devas live on its peak, the Cāturmahārājikakāyika devas चर्तुर-महाराजिक live on its slopes, and the Asuras असुर live in the ocean at its base.  Sumeru and its surrounding oceans and mountains are the home not just of these deities, but also vast assemblies of beings of popular mythology who only rarely intrude on the human world.
* '''[[Trayastrimsa|{{IAST|Trāyastriṃśa}}]]''' or '''{{IAST|Tāvatiṃsa}}''' (Tib: ''sum cu rtsa gsum pa''; Chn/Jpn: 忉利天/三十三天 ''Tōri-ten''; देवनागरीःत्रायतीम्स) – The world "of the Thirty-three (devas)" is a wide flat space on the top of Mount Sumeru, filled with the gardens and palaces of the devas. Its ruler is [[Śakra (Buddhism)|Śakra देवेन्द्र शक्र ]] devānām indra, "Śakra, lord of the devas". Besides the eponymous Thirty-three devas, many other devas and supernatural beings dwell here, including the attendants of the devas and many heavenly courtesans[[apsaras अप्सरा]] (nymphs). The beings of this world are {{convert|1500|ft|m}} tall and live for 36,000,000 years (Sarvāstivāda tradition) or 3/4 of a yojana tall and live for 30,000,000 years (Vibhajyavāda tradition). The height of this world is 80 yojanas above the Earth.
* '''[[Four Heavenly Kings|Cāturmahārājikakāyika]]''' or '''Cātummahārājika''' (Tib: ''rgyal chen bzhi''; Chn:四天王天; Jpn: 四大王衆天 ''Shidaiōshu-ten''; देवनागरीःचर्तु-महाराजिक) – The world "of the Four Great Kings" is found on the lower slopes of Mount Sumeru, though some of its inhabitants live in the air around the mountain. Its rulers are the four Great Kings of the name, {{IAST|Virūḍhaka विरुद्धक}}, {{IAST|Dhṛtarāṣṭra धृतराष्ट्र}}, {{IAST|Virūpākṣa विरुपाक्ष}}, and their leader [[Vaisravana|{{IAST|Vaiśravaṇa वैश्यवर्ण}}]]. The devas who guide the Sun and Moon are also considered part of this world, as are the retinues of the four kings, composed of [[Kumbhanda|{{IAST|Kumbhāṇḍas कुम्भाण्ड}}]] (dwarfs), [[Gandharva गन्धर्व]]s (fairies), [[Naga नाग (mythology)|Nāgas]] (dragons) and [[Yaksha|{{IAST|Yakṣas यक्ष}}]] (goblins).  The beings of this world are {{convert|750|ft|m}} tall and live for 9,000,000 years (Sarvāstivāda tradition) or 90,000 years (Vibhajyavāda tradition). The height of this world is from sea level up to 40 yojanas above the Earth.
* '''[[Asura (Buddhism)|Asura]]''' (Tib: ''lha ma yin''; Chn/Jpn: 阿修羅 ''Ashura''; देवनागरीः असुर) – The world of the Asuras is the space at the foot of Mount Sumeru, much of which is a deep ocean. It is not the Asuras' original home, but the place they found themselves after they were hurled, drunken, from {{IAST|Trāyastriṃśa}} where they had formerly lived.  The Asuras are always fighting to regain their lost kingdom on the top of Mount Sumeru, but are unable to break the guard of the Four Great Kings. The Asuras are divided into many groups, and have no single ruler, but among their leaders are [[Vemacitrin]] (Pāli: Vepacitti वेपचित्ती) and Rāhu.

=====Earthly realms=====
* '''[[Human beings in Buddhism|{{IAST|Manuṣyaloka मनुष्यलोक}}]]''' (Tib: ''mi''; Chn/Jpn: 人 ''nin'') – This is the world of humans and human-like beings who live on the surface of the earth.  The mountain-rings that engird Sumeru are surrounded by a vast ocean, which fills most of the world. The ocean is in turn surrounded by a circular mountain wall called {{IAST|Cakravāḍa}} (Pāli: {{IAST|Cakkavāḷa चक्रवाल}}) which marks the horizontal limit of the world. In this ocean there are four continents which are, relatively speaking, small islands in it. Because of the immenseness of the ocean, they cannot be reached from each other by ordinary sailing vessels, although in the past, when the cakravartin kings ruled, communication between the continents was possible by means of the treasure called the '''cakraratna''' (Pāli '''cakkaratana चक्ररत्न'''), which a cakravartin चक्रवर्ति and his retinue could use to fly through the air between the continents. The four continents are:
** '''[[Jambudvipa|Jambudvīpa]]''' or '''Jambudīpa''' (Chn/Jpn: 閻浮提 ''Enbudai''; देवनागरीः जम्वुद्धिप) is located in the south and is the dwelling of ordinary human beings.  It is said to be shaped "like a cart", or rather a blunt-nosed triangle with the point facing south. (This description probably echoes the shape of the coastline of southern India.)  It is 10,000 yojanas in extent (Vibhajyavāda tradition) or has a perimeter of 6,000 yojanas (Sarvāstivāda tradition) to which can be added the southern coast of only 3 {{fraction|1|2}} yojanas' length.  The continent takes its name from a giant Jambu tree ([[jambul|Syzygium cumini। गुलाव-जामुन]]), 100 yojanas tall, which grows in the middle of the continent. Every continent has one of these giant trees. All Buddhas appear in Jambudvīpa. The people here are five to six feet tall and their length of life varies between 10 to power 140 years (Asankya Aayu) and 10 years.
** '''Pūrvavideha पूर्वविदेह''' or '''Pubbavidehaपूव्वविदेह''' is located in the east, and is shaped like a semicircle with the flat side pointing westward (i.e., towards Sumeru). It is 7,000 yojanas in extent (Vibhajyavāda tradition) or has a perimeter of 6,350 yojanas of which the flat side is 2,000 yojanas long (Sarvāstivāda tradition). Its tree is the [[acacia]]. The people here are about {{convert|12|ft|m}} tall and they live for 250 years.
** '''Aparagodānīya अपारगोदनिय''' or '''Aparagoyāna अपारगोयन''' is located in the west, and is shaped like a circle with a circumference of about 7,500 yojanas (Sarvāstivāda tradition). The tree of this continent is a giant Kadamba tree. The human inhabitants of this continent do not live in houses but sleep on the ground. They are about {{convert|24|ft|m}} tall and they live for 500 years.
** '''Uttarakuru उत्तरकुरु''' is located in the north, and is shaped like a square. It has a perimeter of 8,000 yojanas, being 2,000 yojanas on each side. This continent's tree is called a {{IAST|kalpavṛkṣa कल्पवृक्ष}} (Pāli: kapparukkha कप्परुक्ख) or kalpa-tree, because it lasts for the entire kalpa. The inhabitants of Uttarakuru have cities built in the air. They are said to be extraordinarily wealthy, not needing to labor for a living – as their food grows by itself – and having no private property. They are about {{convert|48|ft|m}} tall and live for 1,000 years, and they are under the protection of [[Vaisravana|{{IAST|Vaiśravaṇa}}]].
* '''[[Animals in Buddhism|Tiryagyoni-loka]]''' or '''Tiracchāna-yoni''' (Tib: ''dud 'gro''; Chn/Jpn: 畜生 ''chikushō''; देवनागरीः तिरिछन्न योनी) – This world comprises all members of the animal kingdom that are capable of feeling suffering, regardless of size.
* '''[[Preta]]loka''' or '''Petaloka''' (Tib: ''yi dwags''; देवनागरीः प्रेत लोक) – The pretas, or "hungry ghosts", are mostly dwellers on earth, though due to their mental state they perceive it very differently from humans.  They live for the most part in deserts and wastelands.

=====Hells (Narakas नरक)=====
{{Main|Naraka (Buddhism)}}
'''Naraka नरक''' or '''Niraya निरय''' (Tib: ''dmyal ba''; देवनागरीः नरक) is the name given to one of the worlds of greatest suffering, usually translated into English as "hell" or "purgatory". As with the other realms, a being is born into one of these worlds as a result of his [[Karma in Buddhism|karma]], and resides there for a finite length of time until his karma has achieved its full result, after which he will be reborn in one of the higher worlds as the result of an earlier karma that had not yet ripened.  The mentality of a being in the hells corresponds to states of extreme fear and helpless anguish in humans.

Physically, Naraka is thought of as a series of layers extending below Jambudvīpa into the earth. There are several schemes for counting these Narakas and enumerating their torments. One of the more common is that of the Eight Cold Narakas and Eight Hot Narakas.

======Cold Narakas======
* '''Arbuda अर्बुद''' – the "blister" Naraka
* '''Nirarbuda निरर्बुद''' – the "burst blister" Naraka
* '''Ataṭa अतट''' – the Naraka of shivering
* '''Hahava हहव''' – the Naraka of lamentation
* '''Huhuva हुहुव''' – the Naraka of chattering teeth
* '''Utpala उत्पल''' – the Naraka of skin becoming blue as a blue lotus
* '''Padma पद्म''' – the Naraka of cracking skin
* '''Mahāpadma महापद्म''' – the Naraka of total frozen bodies falling apart
Each lifetime in these Narakas is twenty times the length of the one before it.

======Hot Narakas======
* '''Sañjīva सञ्जीव''' – the "reviving" Naraka. Life in this Naraka is 162*10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; years long.

====The foundations of the earth====
All of the structures of the earth, Sumeru and the rest, extend downward to a depth of 80,000 [[yojana]]s below sea level – the same as the height of Sumeru above sea level.  Below this is a layer of "golden earth", a substance compact and firm enough to support the weight of Sumeru.  It is 320,000 yojanas in depth and so extends to 400,000 yojanas below sea level.  The layer of golden earth in turn rests upon a layer of water, which is 8,000,000 yojanas in depth, going down to 8,400,000 yojanas below sea level.  Below the layer of water is a "circle of wind", which is 16,000,000 yojanas in depth and also much broader in extent, supporting 1,000 different worlds upon it. Yojanas are equivalent to about 13&amp;nbsp;km (8&amp;nbsp;mi).

===Sahasra cosmology===
Sahasra means "one thousand". All of the planes, from the plane of neither perception nor non-perception (nevasanna-asanna-ayatana) down to the Avici – the "uninterrupted" or "unceasing" (avici literally means "without interval") niraya – constitutes the single world-system, cakkavala (intimating something circular, a "wheel", but the etymology is uncertain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jayatilleke|first1=K.N.|title=Facets of Buddhist Thought|url=http://www.bps.lk/olib/wh/wh162-p.html|website=Buddhist Publication Society|publisher=Buddhist Publication Society|accessdate=7 May 2015|quote=The early Buddhist texts too do not state that the Major World-System is all there is, in the universe, for the question as to whether the world is finite or infinite (ananto) in extent is left unanswered (avyakata). The later commentarial tradition however goes a step further. One of the synonyms for a “world-system” or loka-dhatu is cakkavala, a word of uncertain etymology meaning a “wheel’, “circle” or “sphere.”}}&lt;/ref&gt;), described above. In modern parlance it would be called a 'universe', or 'solar system'.

A collection of one thousand solar systems are called a "thousandfold minor world-system" (culanika lokhadhatu). Or small chiliocosm.

A collection of 1,000 times 1,000 world-systems (one thousand squared) is a "thousandfold to the second power middling world-system" (dvisahassi majjhima lokadhatu). Or medium dichiliocosm.

The largest grouping, which consists of one thousand cubed world-systems, is called the "tisahassi mahasassi lokadhatu". Or great trichiliocosm.

The Tathagata, if he so wished, could effect his voice throughout a great trichiliocosm. He does so by suffusing the trichiliocosm with his radiance, at which point the inhabitants of those world-system will perceive this light, and then proceeds to extend his voice throughout that realm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Authors|first1=Various|title=Aṅguttara Nikāya 3.

====Maha Kalpa====
The word kalpa, means 'moment'. A maha kalpa consists of four moments (kalpa), the first of which is creation. The creation moment consists of the creation of the "receptacle", and the descent of beings from higher realms into more coarse forms of existence. During the rest of the creation moment, the world is populated. Human beings who exist at this point have no limit on their lifespan. The second moment is the duration moment, the start of this moment is signified by the first sentient being to enter hell (niraya), the hells and nirayas not existing or being empty prior to this moment. The duration moment consists of twenty "intermediate" moments (antarakappas), which unfold in a drama of the human lifespan descending from 80,000 years to 10, and then back up to 80,000 again. The interval between 2 of these "intermediate" moments is the "seven day purge", in which a variety of humans will kill each other (not knowing or recognizing each other), some humans will go into hiding. At the end of this purge, they will emerge from hiding and repopulate the world. After this purge, the lifespan will increase to 80,000, reach its peak and descend, at which point the purge will happen again.

Within the duration 'moment', this purge and repeat cycle seems to happen around 18 times, the first "intermediate" moment consisting only of the descent from 80,000—the second intermediate moment consisting of a rise and descent, and the last consisting only of an ascent.

After the duration 'moment' is the dissolution moment, the hells will gradually be emptied, as well as all coarser forms of existence. The beings will flock to the form realms (rupa dhatu), a destruction of fire occurs, sparing everything from the realms of the 'radiant' gods and above (abha deva).

After 7 of these destructions by 'fire', a destruction by water occurs, and everything from the realms of the 'pleasant' gods and above is spared (subha deva).

After 64 of these destructions by fire and water, that is—56 destructions by fire, and 7 by water—a destruction by wind occurs, this eliminates everything below the realms of the 'fruitful' devas (vehapphala devas, literally of "great fruit"). The pure abodes (suddhavasa, meaning something like pure, unmixed, similar to the connotation of "pure bred German shepherd"), are never destroyed. Although without the appearance of a Buddha, these realms may remain empty for a long time. It should be noted that the inhabitants of these realms have exceedingly long life spans.

The formless realms are never destroyed because they do not consist of form (rupa). The reason the world is destroyed by fire, water and wind, and not earth is because earth is the 'receptacle'.

After the dissolution moment, this particular world system remains dissolved for a long time, this is called the 'empty' moment, but the more accurate term would be "the state of being dissolved". The beings that inhabited this realm formerly will migrate to other world systems, and perhaps return if their journeys lead here again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kloetzli|first1=Randy|title=Buddhist Cosmology: From Single World System to Pure Land : Science and Theology in the Images of Motion and Light|date=1983|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publishe|quote=The divisions of cosmic time outlined in the Kosa are predictably elaborate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thera|first1=Ñanamoli|last2=Bodhi|first2=Bhikkhu|title=Maha-sihanada Sutta: The Great Discourse on the Lion's Roar|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.012.ntbb.html|website=Access to Insight|accessdate=7 May 2015|quote=But it is impossible to find a realm in the round that I have not already [82] passed through in this long journey, except for the gods of the Pure Abodes;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temporal cosmology==
Buddhist temporal cosmology describes how the universe comes into being and is dissolved.  Like other Indian cosmologies, it assumes an infinite span of time and is cyclical.  This does not mean that the same events occur in identical form with each cycle, but merely that, as with the cycles of day and night or summer and winter, certain natural events occur over and over to give some structure to time.

The basic unit of time measurement is the '''mahākalpa''' or "Great Eon" (Chn/Jpn: 大劫 ''daigō''; देवनागरीः महाकल्प / महाकप्प).  The length of this time in human years is never defined exactly, but it is meant to be very long, to be measured in billions of years if not longer.

A '''mahākalpa''' is divided into four kalpas or "eons" (Chn/Jpn: 劫 ''kō''; अन्तरकल्प), each distinguished from the others by the stage of evolution of the universe during that kalpa.  The four kalpas are:
* '''Vivartakalpa विवर्तकल्प''' "Eon of evolution" – during this kalpa the universe comes into existence.
* '''Vivartasthāyikalpa विवर्तस्थायिकल्प''' "Eon of evolution-duration" – during this kalpa the universe remains in existence in a steady state.
* '''{{IAST|Saṃvartakalpa संवर्तकल्प}}''' "Eon of dissolution" – during this kalpa the universe dissolves.
* '''{{IAST|Saṃvartasthāyikalpa संवर्तस्थायिकल्प}}''' "Eon of dissolution-duration" – during this kalpa the universe remains in a state of emptiness.

Each one of these kalpas is divided into twenty '''antarakalpas अन्तरकल्प''' (Pāli: '''antarakappa अन्तरकप्प'''; Chn/Jpn: 中劫, "inside eons") each of about the same length.  For the {{IAST|Saṃvartasthāyikalpa}} this division is merely nominal, as nothing changes from one antarakalpa to the next; but for the other three kalpas it marks an interior cycle within the kalpa.

===Vivartakalpa===
The Vivartakalpa begins with the arising of the primordial wind, which begins the process of building up the structures of the universe that had been destroyed at the end of the last mahākalpa.  As the extent of the destruction can vary, the nature of this evolution can vary as well, but it always takes the form of beings from a higher world being born into a lower world.  The example of a Mahābrahmā being the rebirth of a deceased Ābhāsvara deva is just one instance of this, which continues throughout the Vivartakalpa until all the worlds are filled from the [[Brahmaloka]] down to Naraka.  During the Vivartakalpa the first humans appear; they are not like present-day humans, but are beings shining in their own light, capable of moving through the air without mechanical aid, living for a very long time, and not requiring sustenance; they are more like a type of lower deity than present-day humans are.&lt;ref&gt;''Dīghanikāya दिघनिकाय'', Sutta 27 (''[[Aggañña Sutta]]''), sections 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, they acquire a taste for physical nutriment, and as they consume it, their bodies become heavier and more like human bodies; they lose their ability to shine, and begin to acquire differences in their appearance, and their length of life decreases. They differentiate into two sexes and begin to become sexually active. Then greed, theft and violence arise among them, and they establish social distinctions and government and elect a king to rule them, called [[Maha Sammata|Mahāsammata। महासम्मत]], "the great appointed one".  Some of them begin to hunt and eat the flesh of animals, which have by now come into existence.&lt;ref&gt;''Dīghanikāya'', Sutta 27 (''[[Aggañña Sutta]]''), sections 12-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vivartasthāyikalpa===

====First antarakalpa====
The Vivartasthāyikalpa begins when the first being is born into Naraka, thus filling the entire universe with beings. During the first antarakalpa of this eon, human lives are declining from a vast but unspecified number of years (but at least several tens of thousands of years) toward the modern lifespan of less than 100 years.  At the beginning of the antarakalpa, people are still generally happy.  They live under the rule of a universal monarch or "wheel-turning king" (Sanskrit: [[Chakravartin|cakravartin चक्रवर्ति]]; Jpn: 転輪聖王 ''Tenrin Jō-ō''), who conquer{{clarify|date=September 2012}}.  The Mahāsudassana-sutta (DN.17) tells of the life of a cakravartin king, Mahāsudassana (Sanskrit: Mahāsudarśana) who lived for 336,000 years. The Cakkavatti-sīhanāda-sutta (DN.26) tells of a later dynasty of cakravartins, {{IAST|Daḷhanemi}} (Sanskrit: {{IAST|Dṛḍhanemi}}) and five of his descendants, who had a lifespan of over 80,000 years.  The seventh of this line of cakravartins broke with the traditions of his forefathers, refusing to abdicate his position at a certain age, pass the throne on to his son, and enter the life of a [[shramana|{{IAST|śramaṇa श्रमण}}]].  As a result of his subsequent misrule, poverty increased; as a result of poverty, theft began; as a result of theft, capital punishment was instituted; and as a result of this contempt for life, murders and other crimes became rampant.

The human lifespan now quickly decreased from 80,000 to 100 years, apparently decreasing by about half with each generation (this is perhaps not to be taken literally), while with each generation other crimes and evils increased: lying, greed, hatred, sexual misconduct, disrespect for elders.  During this period, according to the Mahāpadāna-sutta (DN.14) three of the four Buddhas of this antarakalpa lived: Krakucchanda Buddha (Pāli: Kakusandha ककुछन्द), at the time when the lifespan was 40,000 years; Kanakamuni कनकमुनी Buddha (Pāli: Konāgamana कोनागमन) when the lifespan was 30,000 years; and Kāśyapa काश्यप Buddha (Pāli: Kassapa कस्सप) when the lifespan was 20,000 years.

Our present time is taken to be toward the end of the first antarakalpa of this Vivartasthāyikalpa, when the lifespan is less than 100 years, after the life of Śākyamuni Buddha (Pāli: Sakyamuni शाक्यमुनी), who lived to the age of 80.

The remainder of the antarakalpa is prophesied to be miserable: lifespans will continue to decrease, and all the evil tendencies of the past will reach their ultimate in destructiveness. People will live no longer than ten years, and will marry at five; foods will be poor and tasteless; no form of morality will be acknowledged. The most contemptuous and hateful people will become the rulers. Incest will be rampant. Hatred between people, even members of the same family, will grow until people think of each other as hunters do of their prey.&lt;ref&gt;''Dīghanikāya'', Sutta 26 (''Cakkavattisīhanādasutta''), sections 19-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually a great war will ensue, in which the most hostile and aggressive will arm themselves and go out to kill each other. The less aggressive will hide in forests and other secret places while the war rages. This war marks the end of the first antarakalpa.&lt;ref&gt;''Dīghanikāya'', Sutta 26 (''Cakkavattisīhanādasutta''), sections 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Second antarakalpa====
At the end of the war, the survivors will emerge from their hiding places and repent their evil habits.  As they begin to do good, their lifespan increases, and the health and welfare of the human race will also increase with it.  After a long time, the descendants of those with a 10-year lifespan will live for 80,000 years, and at that time there will be a cakravartin king named {{IAST|Saṅkha शंख}}.  During his reign, the current bodhisattva in the [[Tushita|{{IAST|Tuṣita तुषिता}}]] heaven will descend and be reborn under the name of Ajita अजित.  He will enter the life of a [[shramana|{{IAST|śramaṇa श्रमण}}]] and will gain perfect [[Bodhi|enlightenment बोधीज्ञान]] as a Buddha; and he will then be known by the name of Maitreya (मैत्रेय, Pāli: Metteyya मेत्तय).

After Maitreya's time, the world will again worsen, and the lifespan will gradually decrease from 80,000 years to 10 years again, each ''antarakalpa'' being separated from the next by devastating war, with peaks of high civilization and morality in the middle.  After the 19th ''antarakalpa'', the lifespan will increase to 80,000 and then not decrease, because the ''Vivartasthāyikalpa'' will have come to an end.

==={{IAST|Saṃvartakalpa}}===
The {{IAST|Saṃvartakalpa}} begins when beings cease to be born in Naraka.  This cessation of birth then proceeds in reverse order up the vertical cosmology, i.e., pretas then cease to be born, then animals, then humans, and so on up to the realms of the deities.

When these worlds as far as the Brahmaloka are devoid of inhabitants, a great fire consumes the entire physical structure of the world.  It burns all the worlds below the Ābhāsvara worlds.  When they are destroyed, the {{IAST|Saṃvartasthāyikalpa}} begins.

==={{IAST|Saṃvartasthāyikalpa}}===
There is nothing to say about the {{IAST|Saṃvartasthāyikalpa}}, since nothing happens in it below the Ābhāsvara worlds. It ends when the primordial wind begins to blow and build the structure of the worlds up again.

===Other destructions===
The destruction by fire is the normal type of destruction that occurs at the end of the {{IAST|Saṃvartakalpa}}.  But every eighth mahākalpa, after seven destructions by fire, there is a destruction by water.  This is more devastating, as it eliminates not just the Brahma worlds but also the Ābhāsvara worlds.

Every sixty-fourth mahākalpa, after fifty six destructions by fire and seven destructions by water, there is a destruction by wind.  This is the most devastating of all, as it also destroys the {{IAST|Śubhakṛtsna}} worlds.  The higher worlds are never destroyed.

==Mahayana views==
[[Mahayana Buddhism]] accepts the cosmology as above.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ss.ncu.edu.tw/~calin/article2008/4h.pdf 佛教的宇宙觀]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.pchome.com.tw/content/7/64321 蓮花轉生--3界娘子]&lt;/ref&gt; A cosmology with some difference is further explained in Chapter 5 of the [[Avatamsaka Sutra]].

The '''Calles Law''' ({{Lang-es|Ley Calles}}), or '''Law for Reforming the Penal Code''' (''ley de tolerancia de cultos'', "law of tolerance of [[sect]]s"), was a statute enacted in [[Mexico]] in 1926, under the presidency of [[Plutarco Elías Calles]],&lt;ref&gt;Gonzales, Michael J., [https://books.google.com/books?id=se17aQLbKioC&amp;pg The Mexican Revolution, 1910–1940], p. 203, UNM Press, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; to enforce the restrictions against the [[Catholic Church]] in Article 130 of the [[Mexican Constitution of 1917]]. Article 130 declared that the [[Separation of church and state|church and state are to remain separate]]. To that end, it required all "churches and religious groupings" to register with the state and placed restrictions on priests and ministers of all religions. Priests and ministers could not hold public office, canvass on behalf of political parties or candidates, or inherit property from persons other than close blood relatives. President Calles applied existing laws regarding the separation of church and state throughout Mexico and added his own legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Warnock, John W. [https://books.google.com/books?id=ubxBPdk79WkC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;lpg=PA27&amp;dq=cristero+war+priests+killed&amp;source=web&amp;ots=xwnUTes6v1&amp;sig=ubrKIonOQ3KyuzbZ0oANhr3mfww#PPA27,M1 ''The Other Mexico: The North American Triangle Completed''] p. 27 (1995 Black Rose Books, Ltd); {{ISBN|978-1-55164-028-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1926, he signed the "Law for Reforming the Penal Code", which became known unofficially as the "Calles Law." This law provided specific penalties for priests and individuals who violated Article 130 of the 1917 Constitution. For example, wearing clerical garb in public was punishable by a fine of 500 [[Mexican peso|pesos]] (approximately 250 U.S. dollars at the time, or worth $4,250 in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.measuringworth.com/ppowerus Purchasing Power of Money in the United States from 1774 to Present]&lt;/ref&gt; A priest who criticized the government could be imprisoned for five years.&lt;ref&gt;Tuck, Jim [http://www.mexconnect.com/mex_/history/jtuck/jtcristero1.html THE CRISTERO REBELLION - PART 1] Mexico Connect 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Some states enacted further measures in the name of church and state separation. Chihuahua, for example, enacted a law permitting only a single priest to serve the entire Catholic congregation of the state.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Library of Congress "Country Studies" [http://countrystudies.us/mexico/61.htm  Mexico, Religion]&lt;/ref&gt; To help enforce the law, Calles seized Church property, expelled all foreign priests, and closed monasteries, convents, and religious schools.&lt;ref name=oppqlz&gt;Warnock, John W. ''The Other Mexico: The North American Triangle Completed'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=ubxBPdk79WkC&amp;pg=PA27 p. 27]] (1995 Black Rose Books, Ltd) {{ISBN|1-55164-028-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chaturthi''' or '''Chaviti''' ([[Telugu language|Telugu]]: చతుర్థి or చవితి), is the fourth day ([[Tithi]]) of any [[lunar month]] in the [[Hindu calendar]].

==Festivals==
* [[Sankashti Chaturthi]] is the 4th day of the waning [[lunar phase]] after the full moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hindujagruti.org/hinduism/knowledge/article/sankashtachaturthi-vrat.html |title=Sankashtachaturthi vrat &amp;#124; Vowed Religious Observance |first= |last= |work=hindujagruti.org |year=2012 |quote=Chaturthi falling in the dark fortnight is known as ‘Sankashti’.|accessdate=20 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; If this Chaturthi falls on a Tuesday it is called Angarki Chaturthi. On this day, the devotees observe strict fast. They break the fast at night after having darshan/auspicious sight of the moon preceded by prayers to [[Lord Ganesha]]. The Angarki Chaturthi (angarak in Sanskrit means red like burning coal ambers) Devotees believe their wishes would be fulfilled if they pray on this auspicious day. Also ''Sankashti'' means deliverance during troubled times, hence observing this fast is believed to reduce your problems as Lord Ganesha symbolizes the remover of all obstacles and supreme lord of intelligence. Before moonlight the Ganapati Atharvashesha is recited to summon the blessings of Lord Ganesha.

During each month, Lord Ganesha is worshiped with a different name and peeta (Lotus petals). On the Charturti day (4th day after new moon) of each month, the 'Sankashta Ganapathi Pooja' prayer is performed. Each ‘Vratha’ (strict fast) has a purpose and is explained to us by a story known as the ‘Vratha Katha’.  This prayer offering has 13 Vratha Kathas, one for each month and the 13th story is for 'athika' (The Hindu calendar has one extra month every 4 years). The uniqueness of this Vratha is that the story pertaining to that month alone has to be recited.

{{Zoroastrianism}}
{{Lead too short|date=September 2016}}
'''Criticism of [[Zoroastrianism]]''' has taken place over many centuries not only from the adherents of other religions but also among Zoroastrians themselves seeking to reform the faith.

==Zoroaster==
In the early 19th century, a Christian missionary based in [[British India]], [[John Wilson (missionary)|John Wilson]], claimed that [[Zoroaster]] never had a genuine divine commission (or ever claimed such a role),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Sharma|editor1-first=Suresh K.|editor2-last=Sharma|editor2-first=Usha|title=Cultural and Religious Heritage of India: Zoroastrianism|date=2004|publisher=Mittal Publications|isbn=9788170999621|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; never performed miracles, or uttered prophecies and that the story of his life is "a mere tissue of comparatively modern fables and fiction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jenny Rose|title=Zoroastrianism: An Introduction|date=2 Apr 2014|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9780857719713|pages=206–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Stausberg|editor1-first=Michael|editor2-last=Vevaina|editor2-first=Yuhan Sohrab-Dinshaw|title=The Wiley-Blackwell Companion to Zoroastrianism|date=23 Mar 2015|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781118785508|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others assert that all the available Zoroastrian sources regarding Zoroaster only provide conflicting images about him,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=S. Nigosian|title=Zoroastrian Faith: Tradition and Modern Research|date=24 Sep 1993|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|isbn=9780773564381|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially between earlier and later sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Sharma|editor1-first=Suresh K.|editor2-last=Sharma|editor2-first=Usha|title=Cultural and Religious Heritage of India: Zoroastrianism|date=2004|publisher=Mittal Publications|isbn=9788170999621|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
The [[Dasatir-i-Asmani]], while being accepted by Zoroastrian communities in Iran and India as genuine, especially by the [[Kadmi]], it is generally believed to be a forgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jenny Rose|title=Zoroastrianism: An Introduction|date=2 Apr 2014|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9780857719713|page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson argued that the [[Avesta]] could not be divinely inspired because much of its text was irrevocably lost or unintelligible&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jenny Rose|title=Zoroastrianism: An Introduction|date=2 Apr 2014|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9780857719713|pages=205–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kenneth Boa|title=Cults, World Religions and the Occult|date=1990|publisher=David C Cook|isbn=9780896938236|page=48|edition=revised}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Martin Haug]], who greatly helped the Parsis of India to defend their religion against the attacks of such Christian missionaries as Wilson, considered the [[Gathas]] to be the only texts and only authoritative scriptures that could be attributed to Zoroaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jenny Rose|title=Zoroastrianism: An Introduction|date=2 Apr 2014|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9780857719713|pages=207–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Polytheism==
John Wilson attacked the Zoroastrian reverence of the [[Amesha Spenta]] and [[Yazata]]s as a form of [[polytheism]], although the Parsis at the time immediately refuted this allegation and insisted that he had in fact addressed the ''Bundahishn'', a text whose relevance to their practice was remote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jenny Rose|title=Zoroastrianism: An Introduction|date=2 Apr 2014|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9780857719713|page=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Stausberg|editor1-first=Michael|title=Zoroastrian Rituals in Context|date=2004|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004131316|pages=479–80|edition=illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics also commonly claim that Zoroastrians are worshipers of other deities and elements of nature, such as [[Fire worship|of fire]]—with one prayer, the Litany to the fire (Atesh Niyaesh),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John R. Hinnells|title=The Zoroastrian Diaspora: Religion and Migration|date=28 Apr 2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198267591|page=706|edition=illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating: "I invite, I perform (the worship) of you, the Fire, O son of Ahura Mazdā together with all fires"—and [[Mithra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Stausberg|editor1-first=Michael|title=Zoroastrian Rituals in Context|date=2004|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004131316|pages=50, 298–99|edition=illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics have charged Zoroastrians with being followers of [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]], who only claimed to be followers of [[monotheism]] in modern times to confront the powerful influence of Christian and Western thought which "hailed monotheism as the highest category of theology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Maneckji Nusservanji Dhalla|authorlink1=Maneckji Nusserwanji Dhalla|title=Zoroastrian Theology: From the Earliest Times to the Present Day|date=1914|page=337|url=http://www.forgottenbooks.com/readbook_text/Zoroastrian_Theology_from_the_Earliest_Times_to_the_Present_Day_1000035071/369}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics insist that the monotheistic reformist view is seen to contradict the conservative (or traditional) view of a dualistic worldview most evident in the relationship between [[Ahura Mazda]] and [[Angra Mainyu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=S. Nigosian|title=Zoroastrian Faith: Tradition and Modern Research|date=24 Sep 1993|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|isbn=9780773564381|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; and arguing that Zoroastrians follow a belief system influenced by [[Henotheism#Zoroastrianism|henotheism]]. Other Western scholars such as [[Martin Haug]], however, have dismissed the concept of theological dualism as a corruption of Zoroaster's original teachings, gradually added by later adherents of the faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jenny Rose|title=Zoroastrianism: An Introduction|date=2 Apr 2014|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9780857719713|pages=207–208}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics add that the fact that such differing views have proliferated are a sign of the enigmatic nature of the Zoroastrian beliefs regarding the divinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=S. Nigosian|title=Zoroastrian Faith: Tradition and Modern Research|date=24 Sep 1993|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|isbn=9780773564381|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inter-Zoroastrian divisions==
Zoroastrian reformers, such as [[Maneckji Nusserwanji Dhalla]], have argued that literary precedence should be given to the Gathas, as a source of authority and textual authenticity. They have also deplored and criticized many Zoroastrian rituals (e.g. excessive ceremonialism and focus on purity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kenneth Boa|title=Cults, World Religions and the Occult|date=1990|publisher=David C Cook|isbn=9780896938236|page=48|edition=revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Stausberg|editor1-first=Michael|title=Zoroastrian Rituals in Context|date=2004|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004131316|page=43|edition=illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt; using "[[bull]]'s urine for ritual cleansing, the attendance of a dog to gaze at the corpse during funerary rites, the exposure of corpses [[Tower of Silence|on towers]] [for consumption by vultures and ravens]")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=S. Nigosian|title=Zoroastrian Faith: Tradition and Modern Research|date=24 Sep 1993|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|isbn=9780773564381|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Stausberg|editor1-first=Michael|title=Zoroastrian Rituals in Context|date=2004|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004131316|page=471|edition=illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt; and theological and cosmological doctrines as not befitting of the faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jenny Rose|title=Zoroastrianism: An Introduction|date=2 Apr 2014|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9780857719713|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ''orthodox'' versus ''reformist'' controversy rages even on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Stausberg|editor1-first=Michael|title=Zoroastrian Rituals in Context|date=2004|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004131316|page=51|edition=illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Divisions and tensions also exist between [[Zoroastrians in Iran|Iranian]] and [[Zoroastrianism in India|Indian Zoroastrians]] and over such issues as the authority of a [[Priestly caste|hereditary priesthood]] in the transmission and interpretation of the faith, ethnicity and the nature of [[Ahura Mazda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jenny Rose|title=Zoroastrianism: An Introduction|date=2 Apr 2014|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9780857719713|pages=221–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, differences also existed between the Zoroastrian branches of [[Zurvanism]], [[Mazdakism]] and [[Mazdaism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Leaman|editor1-first=Oliver|title=Encyclopedia of Asian Philosophy|date=19 Oct 2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134691159|page=608}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Who is a Zoroastrian (Zarathushti)?==
Much like the question of [[who is a Jew?]], Zoroastrian identity, especially whether it is adopted through birth or belief (or both), "remains a cause for tension" within the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jenny Rose|title=Zoroastrianism: An Introduction|date=2 Apr 2014|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9780857719713|pages=210–11, 220}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Ariane Sherine|title=Zoroastrianism needs to adapt its archaic laws – or die|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2013/dec/08/zorastrianism-adapt-archaic-laws-die-parsi|accessdate=22 June 2015|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|date=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reformers have criticised the orthodox refusal to accept religious converts as one reason for the communities' declining population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=LAURIE GOODSTEIN|title=Zoroastrians Keep the Faith, and Keep Dwindling|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/06/us/06faith.html?ref=us&amp;_r=0|accessdate=26 July 2015|work=The New York Times|date=6 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Predestination==
Zoroastrians have been criticized by Muslim authors for their rejection of [[predestination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Ibn Taymiyyah]]|editor1-last=Memon|editor1-first=Muhammad Umar|editor1-link=Muhammad Umar Memon|title=Ibn Taimiya's Struggle Against Popular Religion: With an Annotated Translation of His Kitab iqtida as-sirat al-mustaqim mukhalafat ashab al-jahim|date=1976|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=9783111662381|page=117|edition=reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tamim Ansary|title=Destiny Disrupted: A History of the World Through Islamic Eyes|date=2010|publisher=PublicAffairs|isbn=9781586488130|page=9|edition=illustrated, reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt; This follows a famous [[hadith]] of [[Muhammad]] in which he negatively associates the [[Qadariyah]] Islamic sect with the [[Magi]]ans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard C. Martin|author2=Mark R. Woodward|author3=Dwi S.

==Patriarchy==
Zoroastrianism has been criticized for the perception that it promotes a [[patriarchal system]], expressed through such avenues as an all-male priesthood and its historical allowance of [[polygamy]]—practiced by Zoroaster himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ghada Hashem Talhami|title=Historical Dictionary of Women in the Middle East and North Africa|date=2013|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9780810868588|pages=186, 372}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dale T.

'''Daniel Waterman''' (born 1962) is a British philosopher, artist, writer, freelance researcher, locksmith &lt;ref name="linkedin.com"/&gt; and [[Ayahuasca]] provider, living in the [[Netherlands]]. He is the author of ''"Entheogens, Society &amp; Law: Towards a Politics of Consciousness, Autonomy &amp; Responsibility"'', edited by [[Casey William Hardison]], and published in 2013.

==Life==
Waterman originally studied gold &amp; silversmithing at the Vrije Academie Psychopolis [http://www.vrijeacademie.org/] in [[The Hague]] and Vakschool Schoonhoven [http://www.vakschoolschoonhoven.nl/], as well as graphic design and fashion and St. Joost Akademie voor de Beeldende Kunsten [http://www.stjoost.nl/] in Breda, from 1982 to 1986. Upon graduation, Waterman began traveling and developed an interest in the relationship between creativity, consciousness and health. In the 1990s he first came into contact with [[Santo Daime]], a [[syncretic]] religious tradition from Brazil. Adherents consume a powerful psychoactive brew that catalyses altered or non-ordinary states of consciousness. Inspired by his experiences with ayahuasca, he subsequently traveled around the Amazon learning about native religious beliefs, mythology and healing practices. Waterman briefly worked as an instructor at the Usko-Ayar school of Amazonian Painting in [[Pucallpa]], Peru, and collaborated with its founder, Don [[Pablo Amaringo]], a mestizo ''[[curandero]]'' turned painter, teaching English, computer animation and drawing skills.

The September 2001 attacks on the Twin Towers in New York left a deep impression, prompting a critical inquiry into the relationship between consciousness, ethics and injustice. This inquiry ultimately led to the publication of a book, "Entheogens, Society &amp; Law: Towards a Politics of Consciousness, Autonomy and Responsibility".

In 2001, having returned to the Netherlands, Waterman founded "Ayahuasca Open Style" a loose association of ayahuasca providers and participants that advocates a secular psychotherapeutic approach to the use of "[[entheogenic]]" technologies. Around this time he also began researching and writing ''Entheogens, Society and Law'' while working as an ayahuasca provider in the Netherlands and abroad.

==Works==
Waterman's first book ''Entheogens, Society &amp; Law,'' (ESL)  published by Melrose Books, Oxford in 2013, constitutes one of the most thorough non-academic critiques of contemporary discourses on [[entheogens]] and [[psychedelics]] to date, presenting an analysis of the role of magical thinking, moral and ideological preferences in the dissemination of conflicting interpretations of psychoactive plants, substances, their uses, users and effects. ESL covers important historical events such as Dutch psychiatrist [[Jan Bastiaan]]'s use of LSD in the treatment of victims of Nazi persecution and the ensuing political  debate in the Netherlands, landmark legal cases such as ''[[Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal]]'' {{ussc|546|418|2006|source=f}} in the US and Santo Daime vs. Netherlands (2001),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mestreirineu.org/law_texts/2001%20Dutch%20Santo%20Daime%20Case%20-%20Abridged%20Judgment.pdf Dutch Santo Daime Case 2001]  – Abridged Judgment&lt;/ref&gt; philosophical arguments, medical ethics, religious arguments, the influence of New Age beliefs, and finally takes a critical look at the role of Judeo-Christian moral concepts in the undermining of the relationship between spirituality and ethics in different areas of society.

Waterman eschews all metaphysics and supernaturalism in the interpretation of the effects of psychoactive plants and substances. His theories are loosely based on the work of Czech psychiatrist [[Stanislav Grof]] who as one of the leading specialists on the clinical administration of LSD formulated theories linking the contents of psychedelic catalyzed states of consciousness to the birth process.&lt;ref&gt;Grof, Stanislav (1975). ''Realms of the Human Unconscious''. New York: Viking.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grof, Stanislav (1985). ''Beyond the Brain''. Albany, New York: State University of New York Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grof, Stanislav (1998). ''The Cosmic Game: Explorations of the Frontiers of Human Consciousness''. Albany, New York: State University of New York (SUNY) Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on literature as diverse as [[Joseph Campbell]]'s "[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]" and [[Otto Rank]]'s "Das Trauma der Geburt", as well as the works of child psychologist [[Alice Miller (psychologist)|Alice Miller]], particularly her ideas about "[[poisonous pedagogy]]",&lt;ref name="miller"&gt;{{cite book|first=Alice|last=Miller|title=For Your Own Good: Hidden Cruelty in Child-Rearing and the Roots of Violence|publisher=Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux|edition=3rd|year=1990|isbn = 0-374-52269-3 |url=http://www.nospank.net/fyog.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Katharina|last=Rutschky|language=German|title=Schwarze Pädagogik. Quellen zur Naturgeschichte der bürgerlichen Erziehung |publisher=Ullstein Buchverlage |year=1997|isbn = 3-548-35670-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Stanley Milgram]]'s research into the nature of authority and obedience,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Milgram |first=Stanley |title=Obedience to Authority; An Experimental View |publisher=Harpercollins |year=1974 |isbn=0-06-131983-X |ref=harv |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MlpEAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waterman posits that ''all'' human experience, including religious and mystical states, can be traced back to the earliest stages of biological, cognitive and social development. He then goes on to posit a relationship between early cognitive and psychological development and culture in the production of ethical intuition and behaviour.

Amongst others, Waterman and Hardison coined the phrase "Responsibility Assignment Narrative." RAN's, they argue, constitute a specific function of language in the context of drugs discourse and policy making whereby key words and narratives serve to conceal the interests of the speaker. Speakers adopt an RAN to avoid responsibility or to blame others. The authors argue that concepts of responsibility — moral, legal and pragmatic — are founded on beliefs about free will and causality. These principle belong to what [[Thomas Nagel]] identifies as ‘[[absurdism]],’ namely the principle that the ‘chain of justification,’ of what causes what, is never satisfactorily resolved either in psychological theory, or in physics. According to Waterman and Hardison:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The construction of responsibility or liability rests therefore in the identification of a range of possibilities, plausible causes or motives, and intuitions about their influence on human behaviour. The positive identification of original causes would require the isolation and separation of influences and events, something that is possible in theory alone. When we refer to responsibility, we refer therefore to narratives that explain and interpret causality, free will and hence responsibility as a basis for particular responses, cultural, legal, political. Our Responsibility Assignment Narrative ... is therefore not a critique of any specific interpretation of responsibility, as much as a critique of particular implementations of concepts such as free will or causality.&lt;ref&gt;Waterman, Daniel &amp; Casey William Hardison (ed.), Entheogens, Society &amp; Law: Towards a Politics of Consciousness, Autonomy and Responsibility. (Melrose Books, Oxford 2013) p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Waterman has also argued against using [[Freedom of Religion]] arguments to defend the right to use "mind-altering" plants and substances. Instead, based on his arguments in ESL, Waterman advocates for inclusion of "[[Cognitive Liberty]]" in covenants on Human Rights. He argues that cognition is the de facto basis for all other rights which are founded on subjective experiences of "happiness" and "freedom" as recorded in the [[United States Constitution]], the [[Bill of Right]]s etc. He also argues that the omission of cognitive liberty in [[Human Rights]] discourse is undermining the ability to apply Human Rights arguments in e.g. cases involving coercive administration of psychoactive substances such as [[Ritalin]] for [[ADHD]].

"Entheogens, Society &amp; Law" was written over the course of thirteen years. It was produced in collaboration with [[Casey William Hardison]] who also edited the work. Hardison spent over nine years in a UK prison on charges of manufacturing a number of scheduled substances.&lt;ref name="bbcsentenced"&gt;{{Cite web

== Ayahuasca Open Style ==

In 2001, Waterman founded Ayahuasca Open Style (AOS) as a secular alternative to religious style ayahuasca ceremonies such those of the Brazilian [[Santo Daime]]. Ayahuasca Open Style ceremonies have been held in the Netherlands (2001 ongoing), Israel (2003-2006), Spain (2006), Czechoslovakia (2007), and the UK (2010). The ceremonies differ significantly from the religious format adopted by traditional ayahuasca shamans and contemporary religious groups like the Santo Daime. AOS ceremonies have no formal structure and no official functions such as "fiscal" (sitter/caretaker) or "commander" (master of ceremonies in the Santo Daime tradition). Decisions concerning the duration of the ceremony  and the type of musical accompaniment are taken collectively based on the preferences and needs of participants. AOS ceremonies are eclectic, incorporating methods from psychedelic psychotherapy, shamanism and a variety of religious traditions. To compensate for the lack of formal structure, participants are given a thorough interview beforehand and invited to share their experiences with other participants afterwards. As of 2012, AOS ceremonies have begun to be integrated with workshops on a wide range of topics including personal development, communication skills, writing and other forms of creative expression, ecology and transitioning and activism. The workshops aim to extend the transformational value of the ayahuasca ceremony by providing an opportunity for reflection and sharing on a wide range of ethical and existential problems impacting the lives of participants.

According to Waterman, the secular anti-authoritarian format of AOS ceremonies eliminates the patriarchal authority encountered within formal psychotherapy, shamanism and religious traditions such as the [[Santo Daime]]. In his book, "Entheogens, Society &amp; Law" Waterman suggests that the question of authority is fundamental to spiritual and ethical inquiry. By recreating the hierarchical structures prevalent in society, the traditional shamanic setting and the religious setting offered by the Santo Daime with its formal functions undermine participants ability to question authority. Consequently, the visionary power of entheogenic traditions is focused entirely on private experience and participants are not empowered to use their visionary experiences to explore the social, political and environmental relevance of their own experiences. The ability to use the visionary experience to acquire insights into almost every aspect of private and public life challenges, according to the author, the basis for the separation of Church and State which is founded on the idea that individuals are incapable of taking responsibility for their lives, either because they are inherently 'sinful' or because they do not possess the means to arrive at the ethical insights that are fundamental to the peace and harmony of society.

== Political Views ==

Waterman is a staunch critic of Israel. Following the Israeli army's incursion into Gaza in 2009 he burned his passport and posted a video on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
| title =Burning my Israeli Passport
| publisher =[[YouTube]]
| date =2009| url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbDHk76VtNg }}&lt;/ref&gt; This earned him scathing condemnation from pro-Israeli activists. Together with his mother, Ruth Kupferschmidt, he co-signed an ad in the New York Times, (August 23, 2014) in which over 300 Holocaust survivors and their descendants unequivocally condemn the Israeli policies re Palestinians as "Genocidal."{{Cite web

'''David Davies''' born 2 March 1794, Steynton, Pembrokeshire, and christened ("registered") at Narberth (20.4.1794), where his father officiated.  Like his father, David became a Welsh Baptist minister. He was the youngest of six known children of Benjamin (d. 1816) and Mary (née Owen). In 1818 he is known to have begun studying at [[Abergavenny]] Baptist College, and to have moved to study at [[Stepney Academy]] two years later. He was ordained, in 1822, as an assistant pastor at [[Evesham]], before becoming pastor of the church. In 1837 he accepted an invitation to become minister of Bethesda Chapel, which his father founded, in [[Haverfordwest]], and in 1839 was appointed head of the St. Thomas Green Baptist Academy there (which he is said to have founded).  About this time he married - his wife being named Elizabeth, from Worcester.  They are known to have had two daughters, born at Haverfordwest: Fanny Owen Davies (born 1839) and Mary A. Davies (born in the early 1840s).  He died on 19 March 1856, Haverfordwest.

Fanny married a James Chance, at Old Swinford, on 27 December 1864.  They ran a workhouse in Kings Norton, Worcs., where she was described as "matron".  James died in 1877 and Fanny remarried to a Charles Cooke, at Epsom, in 1881.  She died in 1883.  Nothing more is presently known of her sister Mary.

'''Doris Duke''' (November 22, 1912 – October 28, 1993) was an American [[Beneficiary|heiress]], [[socialite]], [[horticulturalist]], [[art collector]], and [[Philanthropy|philanthropist]].

The daughter of a wealthy tobacco tycoon, Duke was able to fund a life of global travel and wide-ranging interests. These extended across journalism, competition surfing, jazz piano, wildlife conservation, Oriental art and [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]].

Much of her work centered on her father's estate at [[Hillsborough Township, New Jersey]], where she created many elaborately-themed gardens, furnished with artifacts acquired on her world travels, including one of America's largest indoor botanical displays. She was also active in preserving more than 80 historic buildings in [[Newport, Rhode Island]].

Twice divorced, Duke enjoyed a colorful private life that was seldom out of the gossip columns.

Her philanthropic work in [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] research, medicine, and child welfare continued into her old age, some of it unknown to the public during her lifetime, and her estimated $1.3 billion fortune was largely left to charity. After much legal challenging of the executors and trustees, Duke's legacy is now administered by the [http://ddcf.org Doris Duke Charitable Foundation], dedicated to medical research, prevention of cruelty to children and animals, the performing arts, wildlife and ecology.

==Adult life==
When Duke came of age, she used her wealth to pursue a variety of interests, including extensive world travel and the arts. During [[World War II]], she worked in a canteen for sailors in [[Egypt]], taking a [[One-dollar salary|salary of one dollar a year]].&lt;ref name=nytobit&gt;{{cite news |author=Pace, Eric |title=Doris Duke, 80, Heiress Whose Great Wealth Couldn't Buy Happiness, Is Dead |work=[[The New York Times]] | date=October 28, 1993 |accessdate=May 7, 2008 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/29/obituaries/doris-duke-80-heiress-whose-great-wealth-couldn-t-buy-happiness-is-dead.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; She spoke French fluently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inventory of the Doris Duke Papers, 1798-2003 and undated (Duke University Libraries)|url=http://library.duke.edu/rubenstein/findingaids/uadukedoris|website=Library.duk.edu|accessdate=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945, Duke began a short-lived career as a foreign correspondent for the [[International News Service]], reporting from different cities across the war-ravaged Europe. After the war, she moved to Paris and wrote for the magazine ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]''.

While living in Hawaii, Duke became the first non-Hawaiian woman to take up competitive surfing under the tutelage of surfing champion and Olympic swimmer [[Duke Kahanamoku]] and his brothers.&lt;ref name=pony/&gt; A lover of animals, in particular her dogs and pet camels, in her later years Duke became a [[wildlife refuge]] supporter, an environmental conservationist, and a patron of historic preservation.

Duke's interest in [[horticulture]] led to a friendship with [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning author and scientific farmer [[Louis Bromfield]], who operated Malabar Farm, his country home in [[Lucas, Ohio|Lucas]], [[Ohio]] in [[Richland County, Ohio|Richland County]]. Today, his farm is part of [[Malabar Farm State Park]], made possible by a donation from Duke that helped purchase the property after Bromfield's death. A section of woods there is dedicated to her and bears her name.

At age 46, Duke started to create [[Duke Gardens (New Jersey)|Duke Gardens]], an exotic public-display garden, to honor her father James Buchanan Duke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.njskylands.com/atdukgar.htm|title=The Gardens at Duke Farms| publisher=Skylands Visitor Guide|accessdate=June 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; She extended new [[greenhouse]]s from the [[Horace Trumbauer]] conservatory&lt;ref name="New Greenhouse"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dukefarms.org/page.asp?pageId=282|title=New Greenhouse | publisher=Duke Farms|accessdate=May 7, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070622073346/http://www.dukefarms.org/page.asp?pageId=282 |archivedate = June 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; at her home in [[Duke Farms]], New Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dukefarms.org/page.asp?pageId=4|title=History | publisher=Duke Farms|accessdate=February 11, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080111134008/http://www.dukefarms.org/page.asp?pageId=4 |archivedate = January 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the eleven interconnected gardens was a full-scale re-creation of a garden theme, country or period, inspired by DuPont's [[Longwood Gardens]]. She designed the architectural, artistic and botanical elements of the displays based on observations from her extensive international travels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://wirednewyork.com/forum/showthread.php?t=3779|title=A Great Estate Opens Its Gates| publisher=wired|accessdate=May 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also labored on their installation, sometimes working 16-hour days.&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt; Display construction began in 1958.{{sfn|Mansfield|1999|p=300}}

Duke had learned to play the piano at an early age and developed a lifelong appreciation of [[jazz]] and befriended jazz musicians. She also liked [[gospel music]] and sang in a gospel choir.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

In 1966, Duke was behind the wheel of a rented car when it lurched forward and crushed interior designer [[Eduardo Tirella]] as he was opening the gates of the mansion they were restoring in Newport, Rhode Island. While it was ruled a freak accident by the police, Tirella's family sued and won $75,000 when Duke was found negligent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McPhillips|first=Jody|last2=MacKay|first2=Scott|title=Doris Duke had it all -- and now her foundation is giving a lot back|url=http://www.projo.com/specials/century/month9/0961.htm|accessdate=March 22, 2011|newspaper=The Providence Journal|date=September 26, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Homes===
[[File:Italian Garden at Duke Gardens.jpg|thumb|Duke created the Italian Garden to showcase sculptures that her father had collected, such as this replica of Canova's Three Graces]]
Duke acquired a number of homes.

Duke's other residences were private during her lifetime: she spent summer weekends working on her [[Newport Restoration Foundation]] projects while staying at [[Rough Point]], the 49-room English manor-style mansion that she inherited in [[Newport, Rhode Island]].{{sfn|Mansfield|1999|p=364}}

Winters were spent at an estate she built in the 1930s and named "[[Shangri La (Doris Duke)|Shangri La]]" in [[Honolulu, Hawaii]];{{sfn|Mansfield|1999|p=210}} and at "[[Falcon Lair]]" in [[Beverly Hills, California]],{{sfn|Mansfield|1999|p=270}} once the home of [[Rudolph Valentino]]. She also maintained two apartments in [[Manhattan]]: a 9-room penthouse with a {{convert|1000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} veranda at 475 Park Avenue that is currently owned by journalist [[Cindy Adams]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Swanson|first1=Carl|title=Only on Park Avenue, Kids|newspaper=New York Magazine|date=June 5, 2000|url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/realestate/features/3364}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another apartment near [[Times Square]] that she used exclusively as an office for the management of her financial affairs.

She purchased her own [[Boeing 737]] jet and redecorated the interior to travel between homes and on her trips to collect art and plants. The plane included a bedroom decorated to resemble a bedroom in a real house. Doris Duke had difficulty remaining in one place, and whenever she arrived somewhere, she had the desire to go somewhere else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aimeedeheeren.com |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110142857/http://www.aimeedeheeren.com/ |archivedate=January 10, 2015 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duke was a hands-on homeowner, climbing a ladder to a three-story scaffolding to clean tile murals in the courtyard of Shangri La,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Kam |first1=Nadine |title=Fantasyland |newspaper=Honolulu Star Bulletin |date=November 3, 2002 |url=http://starbulletin.com/2002/11/03/features/story1.htm |format=&amp;ndash; &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=intitle%3AFantasyland&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=2002&amp;as_yhi=2002&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |df=mdy }}{{dead link|date=January 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; and working side by side with her gardeners at Duke Farms.

Three of Duke's residences are currently managed by subsidiaries of the [[Doris Duke Charitable Foundation]] and allow limited public access. Duke Farms in New Jersey is managed by the Duke Farms Foundation; a video tour of former Duke Gardens is available. Rough Point was deeded to the [[Newport Restoration Foundation]] in 1999 and opened to the public in 2000. Tours are limited to 12 people. Shangri-La is operated by the [[Doris Duke Foundation for Islamic Art]]; small personal tours and an online virtual tour are available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shangrilahawaii.org/page.asp?pageId=5] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619070048/http://www.shangrilahawaii.org/page.asp?pageId=5 |date=June 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2016}}
[[File:James H. R. and Doris Cromwell.jpg|thumb|Duke with then husband [[James H. R. Cromwell]] in January 1940]]
Duke married twice, the first time in 1935 to [[James H. R. Cromwell]], the son of [[Palm Beach, Florida|Palm Beach]] society doyenne Eva Stotesbury.{{sfn|Mansfield|1999|p=132}} Cromwell, a [[New Deal]] advocate like his wife, used her fortune to finance his political career. In 1940 he served several months as U.S. Ambassador to Canada and ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate. The couple had a daughter, Arden, who died one day after her birth.{{sfn|Mansfield|1999|p=257}} They divorced in 1943.{{sfn|Mansfield|1999|pages=199, 213–14}}

On September 1, 1947, while in Paris, Duke became the third wife of [[Porfirio Rubirosa]], a diplomat from the [[Dominican Republic]].{{sfn|Mansfield|1999|p=232}} She reportedly paid his second wife, actress [[Danielle Darrieux]], $1 million to agree to an uncontested divorce. Because of her great wealth, Duke's marriage to Rubirosa attracted the attention of the [[U.S. State Department]], which cautioned her against using her money to promote political agenda. Further, there was concern that in the event of her death, a foreign government could gain too much leverage. Therefore, Rubirosa had to sign a [[pre-nuptial agreement]]; during the marriage, though, she gave Rubirosa several million dollars in gifts, including a stable of polo ponies, sports cars, a converted [[B-25]] bomber, and, in the divorce settlement, a 17th-century house in Paris. One of Doris Duke's best friends was Brazilian socialite and "jetsetter" [[Aimée de Heeren]].

She reportedly had numerous affairs, with, among others, [[Duke Kahanamoku]], [[Errol Flynn]], [[Alec Cunningham-Reid]], General [[George S. Patton]], [[Joe Castro (musician)|Joe Castro]], and [[Louis Bromfield]].{{efn|Duke had numerous lovers, as documented by biographer Stephanie Mansfield; these include Duke Kahanamoku{{sfn|Mansfield|1999|p=257}} and Errol Flynn.{{sfn|Mansfield|1999|p=210}}{{sfn|Mansfield|1999|p=217}}{{sfn|Mansfield|1999|pages=229–31}}&lt;ref name=pony&gt;{{cite book|author=Pony Duke|title=Too Rich. Family Secrets of Doris Duke|publisher=HarperCollins, 1996|page=104ff|isbn=0-06-017218-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Duke posted a bail of $5,000,000 for her friend, former Philippine [[First Lady]] [[Imelda Marcos]] after the latter was arrested for racketeering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/03/world/doris-duke-offers-mrs-marcos-s-bail.html|title=DORIS DUKE OFFERS MRS. MARCOS'S BAIL|last=Bohlen|first=Celestine|date=1988-11-03|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-05-08|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
In 1992, at the age of 79, Duke had a [[Rhytidectomy|facelift]]. She began trying to walk while she was still heavily medicated and fell, breaking her hip. In January 1993, she underwent surgery for a knee replacement. She was hospitalized from February 2 to April 15. She underwent a second knee surgery in July of that year.

A day after returning home from this second surgery, she suffered a severe stroke. Doris Duke [[Harry Demopoulos#Duke Estate|died]] at her Falcon's Lair home on October 28, 1993, at the age of 80. The cause was progressive [[pulmonary edema]] resulting in [[cardiac arrest]], according to a spokesman.&lt;ref name="courttv.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt;

Duke was cremated 24 hours after her death and her executor, [[Bernard Lafferty (butler)|Bernard Lafferty]], scattered her ashes into the Pacific Ocean as her last will specified.&lt;ref name="courttv.com"/&gt;

==Net worth==
When Doris' father died, he left a fortune valued at $100 million,&lt;ref name=ny/&gt; with the largest share going to Duke and her mother. Nanaline was a shrewd businesswoman, often compared to [[Hetty Green]], and when she died in 1962, she left her daughter, then estimated to be worth $250 million, a fortune triple what J. B. had left her.&lt;ref name=ny/&gt;

Duke also owned numerous shares in big-name companies, such as [[General Motors]], and had a large financial team of bankers and accountants to manage her holdings (since, despite rumors, Duke had little to no interest in money matters). In addition, Duke had a collection of artwork, which was said to include works by Picasso, Van Gogh, Rembrandt and Monet, as well as her valuable collection of Islamic and Southeast Asia art and furniture. Also in Duke's collection were over 2,000 bottles of rare wine (worth over $5 million) and the extraordinary Duke collection of fine jewels. Her total net worth, including all property, was valued at $5.3 billion.

===Philanthropy===
Duke’s first major philanthropic act was to establish Independent Aid, Inc., in 1934, when she was 21 years old, in order to manage the many requests for financial assistance addressed to her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Doris Duke Biographical History and Archival Collections (Duke University Libraries)| url=http://library.duke.edu/rubenstein/collections/people/dorisduke/#item-14|website=Library.duk.edu|accessdate=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, she established the [[Duke Gardens (New Jersey)|Duke Gardens]] Foundation to endow the public display gardens she started to create at Duke Farms. Her Foundation intended that Duke Gardens "reveal the interests and philanthropic aspirations of the Duke family, as well as an appreciation for other cultures and a yearning for global understanding.".&lt;ref name="New Greenhouse"/&gt; Duke Gardens were the center of a controversy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.savedukegardens.org |title=Duke Gardens, Then and Now |publisher=www.SaveDukeGardens.org |accessdate=March 22, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820103927/http://savedukegardens.org/ |archive-date=August 20, 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; over the decision by the trustees of the [[Doris Duke Charitable Foundation]] to close them on May 25, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Duke Farms Promotes "Greener" Future |publisher=Duke Farms |date=March 2, 2008 |url=http://www.dukefarms.org/page.asp?pageId=523 |language= |accessdate=April 14, 2008 |quote=it’s the final months of the gardens being on display in the greenhouses that have enchanted visitors since 1964 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080328065214/http://www.dukefarms.org/page.asp?pageId=523 |archivedate=March 28, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, Duke created the [[Newport Restoration Foundation]] with the goal of [[historic preservation|preserving]] more than eighty colonial buildings in the town. Historic properties include [[Rough Point]], [[Samuel Whitehorne House]], [[Prescott Farm]], the Buloid-Perry House, the King's Arms Tavern, the Baptist Meetinghouse, and the  Cotton House. Seventy-one buildings are rented to tenants. Only five function as museums. She also funded the construction of [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]]'s ashram in India, [[The Beatles at Rishikesh|visited by the Beatles]] in 1968.&lt;ref name=NCH&gt;{{cite book|title=Beyond Gurus: A Woman of Many Worlds|first=Nancy Cooke|last= de Herrera|publisher=Blue Dolphin Publishing|year=1993|isbn=978-0-931892-49-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
Duke's extensive travels led to an interest in a variety of cultures, and during her lifetime she amassed a considerable collection of Islamic and Southeast Asian art. After her death, numerous pieces were donated to The [[Asian Art Museum of San Francisco|Asian Art Museum]] of San Francisco and the [[Walters Art Museum]] of Baltimore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tingley|first=Nancy|title=Doris Duke: The Southeast Asian Art Collection|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|pages=93–94|isbn=978-0-8248-2773-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duke did much additional philanthropic work and was a major benefactor of medical research and child welfare programs. In the late 1980s, Duke donated $2 million to Duke University to be used for [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] research.&lt;ref name=ny/&gt; Her foundation, Independent Aid, became the Doris Duke Foundation, which still exists as a private grant-making entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inventory of the Doris Duke Foundation Records, 1934-2009 (Duke University Libraries)|accessdate=October 23, 2016|url=http://library.duke.edu/rubenstein/findingaids/dorisdukefound|website=Library.duk.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; After her death, the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation was established in 1996, supporting four national grant making programs and Doris Duke's three estates, [[Shangri La (Doris Duke)|Shangri La]], [[Rough Point]], and [[Duke Farms]].

===Trusts and wills===
Duke was the life beneficiary of two trusts created by her father, James Buchanan Duke, in 1917 and 1924. The income from the trusts was payable to any children after her death. In 1988, at the age of 75, Duke legally adopted a woman named Chandi Heffner, then a 35-year-old [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] devotee and sister of the third wife of billionaire [[Nelson Peltz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,164455,00.html |title=Sarandon to Play World's Richest Little Girl |publisher=[[Fox News]] |date=2005-08-02 |accessdate=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duke initially maintained that Heffner was the reincarnation of her only biological child Arden, who died soon after birth in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.legalzoom.com/legal-articles/article15046.html|title=Top Three Inheritance Disputes|publisher=legalzoom|accessdate=May 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two women had a falling out, and the final version of Duke's will specified that she did not wish Heffner to benefit from her father's trusts; she also negated the adoption. Despite the negation, after Duke's death, the estate's trustees settled a lawsuit brought by Heffner for $65 million.&lt;ref name="Top Three Inheritance Disputes"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.legalzoom.com/legal-articles/article15046.html|title=Top Three Inheritance Disputes|publisher=legalzoom|accessdate=June 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her final will, Duke left virtually all of her fortune to several existing and new charitable foundations. She appointed her butler, [[Bernard Lafferty]] born in [[Creeslough]], [[County Donegal]], [[Ireland]], as executor of her estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-11-05/news/mn-61438_1_butler-made-wealthy-by-heiress|work=Los Angeles Times|title=Butler Made Wealthy by Heiress Dies|date=November 5, 1996|author=Lieberman, Paul|accessdate=September 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lafferty appointed the US Trust company as corporate co-executor. Lafferty and Duke's friend Marion Oates Charles were named as her trustees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dukeminier|first=Jesse|title=Wills, Trusts, and Estates|publisher = Aspen Publishers|pages=93–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However a number of lawsuits were filed against the will. At death, Duke's fortune was estimated at upwards of $1.2 billion.&lt;ref name=ny/&gt; The best-known lawsuit&lt;ref name="nytimes1996"&gt;{{cite news|last=Van Natta|first=Dan|title=Deal Reached over the Estate of Doris Duke|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 11, 1996|accessdate=May 7, 2008|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F02E5D91039F932A25757C0A960958260}}&lt;/ref&gt; was initiated by [[Harry Demopoulos]]. In an earlier will, Demopoulos had been named executor &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/05/nyregion/bernard-lafferty-the-butler-for-doris-duke-dies-at-51.html|title=Bernard Lafferty the Butler for Doris Dukes Dies at 51|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and challenged Lafferty's appointment. Demopolous argued that Lafferty and his lawyers had cajoled a sick, sedated old woman into giving him control of her estate.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Even more sensational accusations were made by a nurse, Tammy Payette, who contended that Lafferty and a prominent Beverly Hills physician, Dr. Charles Kivowitz, had conspired to hasten Duke's death with morphine and Demerol.  In 1996, the year Lafferty died, the Los Angeles [[District Attorney]]'s office ruled there was no firm evidence of foul play.&lt;ref name="Top Three Inheritance Disputes"/&gt;

[[Duke University]] also filed suit, claiming entitlement to a larger share of the Duke assets than the $10 million provided in the will (although Duke's will also stated that any beneficiary who disputed its provisions should receive nothing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courttv.com/archive/legaldocs/newsmakers/wills/duke.html|title=Last Will of Duke, Section 19|publisher=Court TV|accessdate=September 10, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914172504/http://www.courttv.com/archive/legaldocs/newsmakers/wills/duke.html|archivedate=September 14, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Litigation involving 40 lawyers at 10 different law firms tied up the Duke estate for nearly three years. New York courts ultimately removed Lafferty for using estate funds for his own support and US Trust for failing "to do anything to stop him."&lt;ref name="Top Three Inheritance Disputes"/&gt; The [[Surrogate Court]] of Manhattan overrode Duke's will and appointed new trustees from among those who had challenged it: [[Harry Demopoulos]]; J. Carter Brown (later also involved in overturning the will of [[Albert C. Barnes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.barneswatch.org/menu_matisse.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116035542/http://www.barneswatch.org/menu_matisse.html |archivedate=January 16, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;); Marion Oates Charles, the sole trustee from Duke's last will; James Gill, a lawyer; [[Nannerl O. Keohane]], president of Duke University; and [[John J.

These trustees now control all assets of the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation, which Doris Duke directed should support medical research, anti-vivisectionism, prevention of cruelty to children and animals, performance arts, wildlife, and ecology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courttv.com/archive/legaldocs/newsmakers/wills/duke.html|title=Last Will of Doris Duke, Section 8|publisher=Court TV|accessdate=September 10, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914172504/http://www.courttv.com/archive/legaldocs/newsmakers/wills/duke.html|archivedate=September 14, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DDCF also controls funding for the three separate foundations created to operate Duke's former homes: the Doris Duke Foundation for Islamic Art, Duke Farms and Newport Restoration Foundation. The trustees have progressively reduced funding for these foundations, stating that Doris Duke's own works are "perpetuating the Duke family history of personal passions and conspicuous consumption."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Sudol |first=Valerie |title=Famed Duke Gardens To Become Ambitious 'Green' Lab |newspaper=Newhouse News Service |year=2008 |accessdate=May 6, 2008 |url=http://www.newhouse.com/famed-duke-gardens-to-become-ambitious-green-laboratory-4.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928021113/http://www.newhouse.com/famed-duke-gardens-to-become-ambitious-green-laboratory-4.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, these foundations have sold some assets&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newportrestoration.com/pr/CarpetSale08.html|title=Sale of Rare Carpet to Benefit Newport Restoration Foundation Collections Fund|publisher=Newport Restoration Foundation|accessdate=June 4, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921162758/http://www.newportrestoration.com/pr/CarpetSale08.html|archive-date=September 21, 2008|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have closed Duke Gardens. Christie's, New York, published a heavily illustrated catalog of over 600 pages for its auction of "The Doris Duke Collection, sold to benefit the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation" which was held in New York City over three days in 2004.

==In popular culture==
Several biographies of Duke have been published, notably:

* Stephanie Mansfield's ''The Richest Girl in The World'' (Putnam 1994). 
* Pony Duke, her disinherited nephew, and Jason Thomas published ''Too Rich: The Family Secrets of Doris Duke'' (1996).
*  Ted Schwarz with Tom Rybak, co-authored by one of Duke's staff, ''Trust No One'' (1997)

Several films/television shows has been made about her life, including:

* A four-hour made-for-television mini-series, based on Mansfield's book, (starring [[Lauren Bacall]] as Duke and [[Richard Chamberlain]] as Lafferty) was aired with the title, ''[[Too Rich: The Secret Life of Doris Duke]]'' (1999)
* Her life is also the subject of the [[HBO]] film ''[[Bernard and Doris]]'', starring [[Susan Sarandon]] as Duke and [[Ralph Fiennes]] as the butler Lafferty ([[2007 in film|2007]])

{{God|by religion}}
The [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]] view of '''God''' is essentially [[Monotheism|monotheistic]]. [[God]] is the imperishable, uncreated being who is the source of all existence.&lt;ref name="BFaith-74"&gt;{{harvnb|Hatcher|1985|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is described as "a [[personal God]], unknowable, inaccessible, the source of all Revelation, eternal, [[omniscience|omniscient]], [[omnipresence|omnipresent]] and [[omnipotence|almighty]]".&lt;ref name="Psmith106"&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2008|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Effendi|1944|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though transcendent and inaccessible directly, his image is reflected in his creation.  The purpose of creation is for the created to have the capacity to know and love its creator.&lt;ref name="Psmith111"&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2008|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;  God communicates his will and purpose to humanity through intermediaries, known as [[Manifestations of God]], who are the prophets and messengers that have founded religions from prehistoric times up to the present day.&lt;ref name="Psmith107-108"&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=107–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==God==
{{Bahá'í sidebar}}
The Bahá'í teachings state that there is only one God and that his essence is absolutely inaccessible from the physical realm of existence and that, therefore, his reality is completely unknowable.  Thus, all of humanity's conceptions of God which have been derived throughout history are mere manifestations of the human mind and not at all reflective of the nature of God's essence.  While God's essence is inaccessible, a subordinate form of knowledge is available by way of mediation by divine messengers, known as [[Manifestations of God]].  The Manifestations of God reflect divine attributes, which are creations of God made for the purpose of spiritual enlightenment, onto the physical plane of existence.&lt;ref name="BFaith-123-126"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hatcher|1985|pp=123–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All physical beings reflect at least one of these attributes, and the human [[soul]] can potentially reflect all of them.&lt;ref name="GH"&gt;{{harvnb|Saiedi|2008|pp=163–180}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shoghi Effendi]], the head of the Bahá'í Faith in the first half of the 20th century, described God as inaccessible, omniscient, almighty, personal, and rational, and rejected [[pantheistic]], [[anthropomorphic]] and incarnationist beliefs.&lt;ref name="Psmith106"/&gt;

===Oneness of God===
Although human cultures and religions differ on their conceptions of God and his nature, Bahá'ís believe they nevertheless refer to one and the same Being.  The differences, instead of being regarded as irreconcilable constructs of mutually exclusive cultures, are seen as purposefully reflective of the varying needs of the societies in which the divine messages were revealed.&lt;ref name="britannica2005"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | year = 2005 | title = Bahá'í Faith | encyclopedia = Britannica Micropaedia | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica | location = Chicago | pages=797 | isbn = 1-59339-236-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  No single faith, and associated conception of God, is thus considered essentially superior to another from the viewpoint of its original [[social context]]; however, more recent religions may teach a more advanced conception of God as called for by the changing needs of local, regional or global civilization.  Bahá'ís thus regard the world's religions as chapters in the history of one single faith, revealed by God's Manifestations [[Progressive revelation (Bahá'í)|progressively]] and in stages.&lt;ref name="CEBF-PR"&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2000|pp=276–277}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bahá'u'lláh writes on this subject:

&lt;blockquote&gt;All-praise to the unity of God, and all-honour to Him, the sovereign Lord, the incomparable and all-glorious Ruler of the universe, Who, out of utter nothingness, hath created the reality of all things, Who, from naught, hath brought into being the most refined and subtle elements of His creation, and Who, rescuing His creatures from the abasement of remoteness and the perils of ultimate extinction, hath received them into His kingdom of incorruptible glory. Nothing short of His all-encompassing grace, His all-pervading mercy, could have possibly achieved it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hatcher|1985|pp=74–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="glean64"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bahá'u'lláh|1976|pp=64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Knowledge of God===
The Bahá'í teachings state that God is too great for humans to create an accurate conception of.  In the Bahá'í understanding, the attributes attributed to God, such as ''All-Powerful'' and ''All-Loving'' are derived from limited human experiences of power and love. Bahá'u'lláh taught that the knowledge of God is limited to those attributes and qualities which are perceptible to us, and thus direct knowledge of God is not possible.  Furthermore, Bahá'u'lláh states that knowledge of the attributes of God is revealed to humanity through his [[Manifestation of God|messengers]].&lt;ref name="HDBF-GOD"&gt;{{Harvnb|Adamson|2007|pp=186–188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;So perfect and comprehensive is His creation that no mind or heart, however keen or pure, can ever grasp the nature of the most insignificant of His creatures; much less fathom the mystery of Him Who is the Day Star of Truth, Who is the invisible and unknowable Essence...&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Momen|1988|pg=199-201}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="glean60"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bahá'u'lláh|1976|pp=60–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;As our knowledge of things, even of created and limited things, is knowledge of their qualities and not of their essence, how is it possible to comprehend in its essence the Divine Reality, which is unlimited? ... Knowing God, therefore, means the comprehension and the knowledge of His attributes, and not of His Reality. This knowledge of the attributes is also proportioned.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Personal God===
While the Bahá'í writings teach of a [[personal god]] who is a being with a personality (including the capacity to reason and to feel love), they clearly state that this does not imply a human or physical form.&lt;ref name="Psmith106"/&gt; [[Shoghi Effendi]] writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;What is meant by personal God is a God Who is conscious of His creation, Who has a Mind, a Will, a Purpose, and not, as many scientists and materialists believe, an unconscious and determined force operating in the universe. Such conception of the Divine Being, as the Supreme and ever present Reality in the world, is not anthropomorphic, for it transcends all human limitations and forms, and does by no means attempt to define the essence of Divinity which is obviously beyond any human comprehension. To say that God is a personal Reality does not mean that He has a physical form, or does in any way resemble a human being. To entertain such belief would be sheer blasphemy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McLean|Lee|1997|p=67,78}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;From a letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer, April 21, 1939. published in {{cite book |editor=Hornby, Helen (Ed.)  |year=1983  |title=Lights of Guidance: A Bahá'í Reference File  |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust, New Delhi, India  |isbn=81-85091-46-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Bahá'í teachings state that one can develop a closer relationship with God through prayer, meditation, study of the holy writings, and service to humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=117–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] writes

&lt;blockquote&gt;Therefore, we learn that nearness to God is possible through devotion to Him, through entrance into the Kingdom and service to humanity; it is attained by unity with mankind and through loving-kindness to all; it is dependent upon investigation of truth, acquisition of praiseworthy virtues, service in the cause of universal peace and personal sanctification.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hayes|2006|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pup148"&gt;{{harvnb|`Abdu'l-Bahá|1982|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Manifestations of God==
Bahá'ís believe that God expresses his will at all times and in many ways, and specifically through a series of divine messengers referred to as [[Manifestation of God|Manifestations of God]] or sometimes ''divine educators''.&lt;ref name="eor"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia
| last = Hutter | first = Manfred | editor = Ed. Lindsay Jones | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Religion | title = Bahā'īs | edition = 2nd | year = 2005 | publisher = Macmillan Reference USA | volume = 2 | location = Detroit | pages = 737–740
| isbn = 0-02-865733-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In revealing God's will, these Manifestations establish religion in the world. Since the Bahá'í teachings state that God is too great for humans to ever comprehend or to create more than a limited conception of, the Bahá'í scripture instead focuses on the created divine virtues and attributes which are described in the teachings of the Manifestations.&lt;ref name="manifestation"&gt;{{harvnb|Cole|1982|pp=1–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples of divine attributes described in Bahá'í scripture include Almighty, All-Powerful, All-loving, All-Merciful, Most-Compassionate, All-Glorious. The Manifestations of God are analogous to divine mirrors which reflect God's created attributes and thus reveal aspects of God without being incarnations of God's essence.  It is through these divine educators that humans can approach God, and through them God brings divine revelation and law.&lt;ref name="BFaith-115-123"&gt;{{harvnb|Hatcher|1985|pp=115–123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Names of God==
The Bahá'í scriptures often refer to God by various titles and attributes, such as Almighty, All-Powerful, All-Wise, Incomparable, Gracious, Helper, All-Glorious, and Omniscient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Adamson, Hugh C.|title=Historical dictionary of the Bahá'í Faith|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Metuchen, N.J|year=2007|pages=|isbn=0-8108-5096-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baha'is believe the greatest of all the names of God is "All-Glorious" or ''Bahá'' in Arabic. ''Bahá'' is the root word of the following names and phrases: the greeting ''Alláh-u-Abhá'' (God is the All-Glorious), the invocation ''Yá Bahá'u'l-Abhá'' (O Thou Glory of the Most Glorious), ''Bahá'u'lláh'' (The Glory of God), and ''Bahá'i'' (Follower of the All-Glorious). These are expressed in Arabic regardless of the language in use (see [[Bahá'í symbols]]).&lt;ref name="smith_gn"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter | authorlink= Peter Smith (historian)|encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= greatest name |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |pages= 167–168}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from these names, God is addressed in the local language, for example ''Ishwar'' in Hindi, ''Dieu'' in French and ''Dios'' in Spanish.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} Bahá'ís believe [[Bahá'u'lláh]], the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, is the "complete incarnation of the names and attributes of God".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Revisioning the Sacred: New Perspectives on a Baha'i Theology | first = Jack | last = McLean | first2= Anthony A. | last2 = Lee  | isbn = 0-933770-96-0 | ref = harv | year = 1997 | publisher = Kalimat Press | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=HWq67XexIHcC | page= 66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of Greek art}}

'''Greco-Buddhist art''' is the artistic manifestation of [[Greco-Buddhism]], a cultural [[syncretism]] between the [[Ancient Greece|Classical Greek]] culture and [[Buddhism]], which developed over a period of close to 1,000 years in [[Central Asia]], between the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]] in the 4th century BC, and the [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent|Islamic conquests]] of the 7th century AD. Greco-Buddhist art is characterized by the strong idealistic realism and sensuous description of [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic art]] and the first representations of the Buddha in human form, which have helped define the artistic (and particularly, sculptural) canon for Buddhist art throughout the Asian continent up to the present. It is also a strong example of cultural [[syncretism]] between eastern and western traditions.

The origins of Greco-Buddhist art are to be found in the Hellenistic [[Greco-Bactrian kingdom]] (250–130 BC), located in today’s [[Afghanistan]], from which Hellenistic culture radiated into the [[Indian subcontinent]] with the establishment of the [[Indo-Greek kingdom]] (180–10 BC). Under the [[Indo-Greeks]] and then the [[Kushan]]s, the interaction of Greek and Buddhist culture flourished in the area of [[Gandhara]], in today’s northern [[Pakistan]], before spreading further into India, influencing the art of [[Mathura art|Mathura]], and then the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] art of the [[Gupta empire]], which was to extend to the rest of South-East Asia. The influence of Greco-Buddhist art also spread northward towards [[Central Asia]], strongly affecting the art of the [[Tarim Basin]], and ultimately the arts of China, [[Korea]], and Japan.

'''Back:''' [[Herakles]], holding a lion skin and a club resting over the arm. The text reads: ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΣ ΔΗΜΗΤΡΙΟΥ – ''BASILÉŌS DĒMĒTRÍOU'' "of King Demetrius".]]
Powerful Hellenistic states were established in the areas of [[Bactria]] and [[Sogdiana]], and later northern India for three centuries following the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]] around 330 BC, the [[Seleucid]] empire until 250 BC, followed by the [[Greco-Bactrian kingdom]] until 130 BC, and the [[Indo-Greek kingdom]] from 180 BC to around 10 BC.

The clearest examples of Hellenistic art are found in the coins of the [[Greco-Bactrian]] kings of the period, such as [[Demetrius I of Bactria]]. Many coins of the Greco-Bactrian kings have been unearthed, including the largest silver and gold coins ever minted in the Hellenistic world, ranking among the best in artistic and technical sophistication: they "show a degree of individuality never matched by the often more bland descriptions of their royal contemporaries further West". ("Greece and the Hellenistic world").

These Hellenistic kingdoms established cities on the Greek model, such as in [[Ai-Khanoum]] in [[Bactria]], displaying purely Hellenistic architectural features, Hellenistic statuary, and remains of [[Aristotle|Aristotelician]] papyrus prints and coin hoards.

These Greek elements penetrated India quite early as shown by the Hellenistic [[Pataliputra capital]] (3rd century BC), but the influence became especially strong, particularly in northwestern India, following the invasion of the [[Greco-Bactrians]] in 180 BC, when they established the [[Indo-Greek kingdom]] in India. Fortified Greek cities, such as [[Sirkap]] in northern Pakistan, were established. Architectural styles used Hellenistic decorative motifs such as fruit garland and scrolls. Stone palettes for aromatic oils representing purely Hellenistic themes such as a [[Nereid]] riding a [[Ketos]] sea monster are found.

In [[Hadda, Afghanistan|Hadda]], Hellenistic deities, such as [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] are found. Wind gods are depicted, which will affect the representation of wind deities as far as Japan. Dionysiac scenes represent people in Classical style drinking wine from amphoras and playing instruments.

==Early Gandhara creations: stone palettes (2nd century BCE – 1st century CE)==
{{main|Stone palettes}}
The Greeks in Asia are well known archaeologically for their [[stone palettes]], also called "toilet trays", round trays commonly found in the areas of [[Bactria]] and [[Gandhara]], which usually represent [[Greek mythology|Greek mythological]] scenes. The earliest of them are attributed to the [[Indo-Greek]] period in the 2nd and 1st century [[BCE]] (a few were retrieved from the Indo-Greek stratum No.5 at [[Sirkap]]).&lt;ref&gt;Greek Gods in the East, Stančo, Ladislav, Charles University in Prague, Karolinum Press, 2012 [https://books.google.com/books?id=lKJyCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA167 p.167]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Gandhara palette: The so-called palettes or 'toilet trays' of the late second century BC and the first century AD depicting Classical scenes" in The Monuments of Afghanistan: History, Archaeology and Architecture, Warwick Ball, I. B. Tauris, 2008, p.115&lt;/ref&gt;  Production continued until the time of the [[Indo-Parthians]], but they practically disappeared after the 1st century.

==Interaction==
As soon as the Greeks invaded Northwestern South Asia to form the [[Indo-Greek kingdom]], a fusion of Hellenistic and Buddhist elements started to appear, encouraged by the benevolence of the Greek kings towards Buddhism. This artistic trend then developed for several centuries and seemed to flourish further during the [[Kushan Empire]] from the 1st century AD.

===Early contributions of Gandharan artists to Buddhist art (2nd-1st century BC)===
According to some authors, Hellenistic sculptors had some connection with the creation of Buddhist art at [[Sanchi]] and [[Bharhut]].&lt;ref&gt;"There is evidence of Hellensitic sculptors being in touch with Sanchi and Bharhut" in The Buddha Image: Its Origin and Development, Yuvraj Krishan, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, 1996, [https://books.google.com/books?id=kDyJh--iaL0C&amp;pg=PA9 p.9]&lt;/ref&gt; The structure as a whole as well as various elements point to Hellenistic and other foreign influence, such as the fluted bell, addorsed capital of the [[Persepolitan]] order, and the abundant use of the Hellenistic [[flame palmette]] or [[honeysuckle]] motif.&lt;ref name="Krishan"&gt;The Buddha Image: Its Origin and Development, Yuvraj Krishan, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, 1996, [https://books.google.com/books?id=kDyJh--iaL0C&amp;pg=PA17 p.17-18 Note 3]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sanchi====
Around 115 BC, the embassy of [[Heliodurus|Heliodorus]] from king [[Antialkidas]] to the court of the [[Sungas]] king [[Bhagabhadra]] in [[Vidisha]] is recorded. In the Sunga capital, Heliodorus established the [[Heliodorus pillar]] in a dedication to [[Vāsudeva]]. This would indicate that relations between the Indo-Greeks and the Sungas had improved by that time, that people traveled between the two realms, and also that the Indo-Greeks readily followed Indian religions.&lt;ref&gt;Ancient Indian History and Civilization, Sailendra Nath Sen, New Age International, 1999 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Wk4_ICH_g1EC&amp;pg=PA170 p.170]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also around the same time, circa 115 BC, it is known that architectural decorations such as decorative reliefs started to be introduced at nearby [[Sanchi]], 6&amp;nbsp;km away from Vidisha, by craftsmen from the area of [[Gandhara]], a central Indo-Greek region.&lt;ref name="AG"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HP"/&gt; Typically, the earliest medallions at [[Sanchi Stupa No.2]] are dated to 115 BC, while the more extensive pillar carvings are dated to 80 BC.&lt;ref name="Shaw 90"&gt;''Buddhist Landscapes in Central India: Sanchi Hill and Archaeologies of Religious and Social Change, C. Third Century BC to Fifth Century AD'', by Julia Shaw, Left Coast Press, 2013 [https://books.google.com/books?id=jzkyBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA90 p.90]&lt;/ref&gt; These early decorative reliefs were apparently the work of craftsmen from the northwest (around the area of [[Gandhara]]), since they left mason's marks in [[Kharoshthi]], as opposed to the local [[Brahmi]] script.&lt;ref name="AG"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HP"&gt;Buddhist Architecture Huu Phuoc Le Grafikol, 2010 [https://books.google.com/books?id=9jb364g4BvoC&amp;pg=PA161 p.161]&lt;/ref&gt; This seems to imply that these foreign workers were responsible for some of the earliest motifs and figures that can be found on the railings of the stupa.&lt;ref name="AG"&gt;An Encyclopaedia of Indian Archaeology, by [[Amalananda Ghosh]], BRILL [https://books.google.com/books?id=Wba-EZhZcfgC&amp;pg=PA295 p.295]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HP"/&gt;

====Bharhut====
[[File:Bharhut Eastern gateway.jpg|thumb|left|upright|At [[Bharhut]], the gateways were made by northern (probably [[Gandharan]]) masons using [[Kharosthi]] marks, while the railings were made by masons exclusively using marks in the local [[Brahmi]] script.&lt;ref name="Boardman 115"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AC"/&gt; 150-100 BC.]]
Craftsmen from the [[Gandhara]] area, a central region of the [[Indo-Greek]] realm, are known to have been involved in the construction of the gateways at [[Bharhut]], which are dated to 100-75 BC:&lt;ref name="HPL"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Ashoka: The Search for India's Lost Emperor'', Charles Allen, Hachette UK, 2012 [https://books.google.com/books?id=K4vHjbUtf_4C&amp;pg=PT122 p.122]&lt;/ref&gt; this is because [[Stonemasonry|mason]]'s marks in [[Kharosthi]] have been found on several elements of the Bharhut remains, indicating that some of the builders at least came from the north, particularly from [[Gandhara]] where the Kharoshti script was in use.&lt;ref name="Boardman 115"&gt;The Diffusion of Classical Art in Antiquity, John Boardman, Princeton University Press, p.115&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Krishan"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buddhist Architecture by Huu Phuoc Le [https://books.google.com/books?id=9jb364g4BvoC&amp;pg=PA161 p.161]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bharhut torana statues.jpg|thumb|Statues on the architraves of the torana gateway, associated with Kharosthi marks. 100-75 BC.]]
Cunningham explained that [[:File:Bharhut ballustrades with Kharoshti mason marks.jpg|the Kharosthi letters were found on the ballusters]] between the architraves of the gateway, but none on the railings which all had Indian markings, summarizing that the gateways, which are artistically more refined, must have been made by artists from the North, whereas the railings were made by local artists.&lt;ref name="AC"&gt;"These little balusters are of considerable interest, as their sculptured statues are much superior in artistic design and execution to those of the railing pillars. They are further remarkable in having Arian letters engraved on their bases or capitals, a peculiarity which points unmistakably to the employment of Western artists, and which fully accounts for the superiority of their execution. The letters found are p, s, a, and b, of which the first three occur twice. Now, if the same sculptors had been employed on the railings, we might confidently expect to find the same alphabetical letters used as private marks. But the fact is just the reverse, for the whole of the 27 marks found on any portions of the railing are Indian letters. The only conclusion that I can come to from these facts is that the foreign artists who were employed on the sculptures of the gateways were certainly not engaged on any part of the railing. I conclude, therefore, that the Raja of [[Sungas]], the donor of the gateways, must have sent his own party of workmen to make them, while the smaller gifts of pillars and rails were executed by the local artists." in The stūpa of Bharhut: a Buddhist monument ornamented with numerous sculptures illustrative of Buddhist legend and history in the third century B. C, by Alexander Cunningham [https://archive.org/stream/cu31924016181111 p. 8] (Public Domain)&lt;/ref&gt; The Bharhut gateway is dated to 100-75 BC (most probably 75 BC based on artistic analysis).&lt;ref name="HPL"&gt;Buddhist Architecture, Huu Phuoc Le, Grafikol, 2010 [https://books.google.com/books?id=9jb364g4BvoC&amp;pg=PA149 p.149ff]&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure as a whole as well as various elements point to Hellenistic and other foreign influence, such as the fluted bell, addorsed capital of the [[Persepolitan]] order, and the abundant use of the Hellenistic [[flame palmette]] or [[honeysuckle]] motif.&lt;ref name="Krishan"/&gt;

[[File:IndoGreeksTrojanHorse.jpg|thumb|The story of the [[Trojan horse]] was depicted in the art of [[Gandhara]]. [[British Museum]].]]
Later, Greco-Buddhist art depicts the life of the Buddha in a visual manner, probably by incorporating the real-life models and concepts which were available to the artists of the period.

The [[Bodhisattva]]s are depicted as bare-chested and jewelled Indian princes, and the [[Buddhahood|Buddhas]] as Greek kings wearing the light [[toga]]-like himation. The buildings in which they are depicted incorporate Greek style, with the ubiquitous [[Indo-Corinthian capital]]s and Greek decorative scrolls. Surrounding deities form a pantheon of Greek ([[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]], [[Herakles]]) and Indian gods ([[Indra]]).

=== Material ===
Stucco as well as stone was widely used by sculptors in Gandhara for the decoration of monastic and cult buildings. Stucco provided the artist with a medium of great plasticity, enabling a high degree of expressiveness to be given to the sculpture. Sculpting in stucco was popular wherever Buddhism spread from Gandhara - India, Afghanistan, Central Asia and China.

===Stylistic evolution===
Stylistically, Greco-Buddhist art started by being extremely fine and realistic, as apparent on the standing Buddhas, with "a realistic treatment of the folds and on some even a hint of modelled volume that characterizes the best Greek work" (Boardman). It then lost this sophisticated realism, becoming progressively more symbolic and decorative over the centuries.

===Architecture===
[[File:GandharanAtlas.JPG|thumb|left|200px|alt=he Titan Atlas supporting a Buddhist monument, from Hadda, Afghanistan|The Titan [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]], supporting a Buddhist monument, [[Hadda, Afghanistan|Hadda]].]]

The presence of [[stupa]]s at the Greek city of [[Sirkap]], which was built by [[Demetrius I of Bactria|Demetrius]] around 180 BC, already indicates a strong syncretism between Hellenism and the [[Buddhism|Buddhist faith]], together with other religions such as [[Hinduism]] and [[Zoroastrianism]]. The style is Greek, adorned with [[Corinthian column]]s in excellent Hellenistic execution.

Later in [[Hadda, Afghanistan|Hadda]], the Greek divinity [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] is represented holding Buddhist monuments with decorated Greek columns. The motif was adopted extensively throughout the Indian sub-continent, Atlas being substituted for the Indian [[Yaksha|Yaksa]] in the monuments of the [[Shunga Empire]] around the 2nd century BC.

===Buddha===
[[File:Gandhara Buddha (tnm).jpeg|thumb|upright|alt=bronze sculpture of the Gautama Buddha 1st–2nd century AD, Gandhara, Pakistan |One of the first representations of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], 1st–2nd century AD, [[Gandhara]], [[Pakistan]]: [[Standing Buddha (Tokyo National Museum)]].]]
[[File:SFAAMBuddha.jpg|thumb|upright|The Seated Buddha, dating from 300 to 500 CE, was found near [[Jamal Garhi]], [[Pakistan]], and is now on display at the [[Asian Art Museum (San Francisco)|Asian Art Museum]] in [[San Francisco]].]]
Sometime between the 2nd century BC and the 1st century AD, the first anthropomorphic representations of the Buddha were developed. These were absent from earlier strata of Buddhist art, which preferred to represent the Buddha with symbols such as the stupa, the Bodhi tree, the empty seat, the wheel, or the footprints. But the innovative anthropomorphic Buddha image immediately reached a very high level of sculptural sophistication, naturally inspired by the sculptural styles of Hellenistic Greece.

Many of the stylistic elements in the representations of the Buddha point to Greek influence: the Greek [[himation]] (a light [[toga]]-like wavy robe covering both shoulders: Buddhist characters are always represented with a [[dhoti]] [[loincloth]] before this innovation), the [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]], the [[contrapposto]] stance of the upright figures, the stylized [[Mediterranean]] curly hair and top-knot apparently derived from the style of the [[Apollo Belvedere|Belvedere Apollo]] (330 BC), and the measured quality of the faces, all rendered with strong artistic [[Realism (visual arts)|realism]] (See: [[Greek art]]). Some of the standing Buddhas (as the one pictured) were sculpted using the specific Greek technique of making the hands and sometimes the feet in marble to increase the realistic effect, and the rest of the body in another material.

Foucher especially considered Hellenistic free-standing Buddhas as "the most beautiful, and probably the most ancient of the Buddhas", assigning them to the 1st century BC, and making them the starting point of the anthropomorphic representations of the Buddha ("The Buddhist art of Gandhara", Marshall, p101).

====Development====
[[File:PilarImage4.jpg|200px|thumb|left|alt=An Indo-Corinthian capital from the Butkara Stupa from the Turin City Museum of Ancient Art|An [[Indo-Corinthian capital]] from the [[Butkara Stupa]] under which a coin of [[Azes II]] was found. Dated to 20 BC or earlier ([[Turin City Museum of Ancient Art]]).]]
[[File:BimaranCasket2.JPG|thumb|180px|alt=gold relief vessel The Bimaran casket, representing the Buddha, dated from 30–10 BC. from the British Museum|The [[Bimaran casket]], representing the Buddha, is dated to around 30–10 BC. [[British Museum]].]]
There is some debate regarding the exact date for the development of the anthropomorphic representation of the Buddha, and this has a bearing on whether the innovation came directly from the [[Indo-Greeks]], or was a later development by the [[Indo-Scythians]], the [[Indo-Parthians]] or the [[Kushan]]s under Hellenistic artistic influence. Most of the early images of the Buddha (especially those of the standing Buddha) are anepigraphic, which makes it difficult to have a definite dating. The earliest known image of the Buddha with approximate indications on date is the [[Bimaran casket]], which has been found buried with coins of the Indo-Scythian king [[Azes II]] (or possibly [[Azes I]]), indicating a 30–10 BC date, although this date is not undisputed.

Such datation, as well as the general Hellenistic style and attitude of the Buddha on the Bimaran casket ([[himation]] dress, [[contrapposto]] attitude, general depiction) would make it a possible Indo-Greek work, used in dedications by Indo-Scythians soon after the end of Indo-Greek rule in the area of [[Gandhara]]. Since it already displays quite a sophisticated iconography ([[Brahma (Buddhism)|Brahma]] and [[Śakra (Buddhism)|Śakra]] as attendants, [[Bodhisattva]]s) in an advanced style, it would suggest much earlier representations of the Buddha were already current by that time, going back to the rule of the Indo-Greeks ([[Alfred A. Foucher]] and others).
[[File:HanWudiBuddhas.jpg|thumb|170px|left|alt=Fresco describing Emperor Han Wudi (156–87 BC) worshipping two statues of the Buddha|Fresco describing Emperor [[Han Wudi]] (156–87 BC) worshipping two statues of the Buddha, [[Mogao Caves]], [[Dunhuang]], c. 8th century AD]]
The next Greco-Buddhist findings to be strictly datable are rather late, such as the c. AD 120 [[Kanishka casket]] and [[Kanishka]]'s Buddhist coins. These works at least indicate though that the anthropomorphic representation of the Buddha was already extant in the 1st century AD.

From another direction, Chinese historical sources and mural paintings in the [[Tarim Basin]] city of [[Dunhuang]] accurately describe the travels of the explorer and ambassador [[Zhang Qian]] to [[Central Asia]] as far as [[Bactria]] around 130 BC, and the same murals describe the Emperor [[Han Wudi]] (156–87 BC) worshipping Buddhist statues, explaining them as ''"golden men brought in 120 BC by a great Han general in his campaigns against the nomads."'' Although there is no other mention of Han Wudi worshipping the Buddha in Chinese historical literature, the murals would suggest that statues of the Buddha were already in existence during the 2nd century BC, connecting them directly to the time of the Indo-Greeks.

Later, the Chinese historical chronicle [[Hou Hanshu]] describes the enquiry about Buddhism made around AD 67 by the emperor [[Emperor Ming of Han China|Emperor Ming]] (AD 58–75). He sent an envoy to the [[Yuezhi]] in northwestern India, who brought back paintings and statues of the Buddha, confirming their existence before that date:

:''"The Emperor, to discover the true doctrine, sent an envoy to [[Names of India#Tianzhu|Tianzhu]] (天竺, Northwestern India) (Northwestern India) to inquire about the Buddha’s doctrine, after which paintings and statues [of the Buddha] appeared in the Middle Kingdom."'' (Hou Hanshu, trans. John Hill)

An Indo-Chinese tradition also explains that [[Nagasena]], also known as [[Menander I|Menander]]'s Buddhist teacher, created in 43 BC in the city of [[Pataliputra]] a statue of the Buddha, the [[Emerald Buddha]], which was later brought to [[Thailand]].

[[File:The Buddha and nude Vajrapani at Jamal Garhi.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Buddha]] and a naked [[Vajrapani]] in a frieze at [[Jamal Garhi]], [[Gandhara]].]]
In Gandharan art, the Buddha is often shown under the protection of the Greek god [[Herakles]], standing with his club (and later a diamond rod) resting over his arm.&lt;ref&gt;Vajrapani-Herakles:[http://www.exoticindiaart.com/artimages/BuddhaImage/greece_sm.jpg Image]&lt;/ref&gt; This unusual representation of Herakles is the same as the one on the back of Demetrius' coins, and it is exclusively associated to him (and his son [[Euthydemus II]]), seen only on the back of his coins.

Soon, the figure of the Buddha was incorporated within architectural designs, such as Corinthian pillars and friezes. Scenes of the life of the Buddha are typically depicted in a Greek architectural environment, with protagonist wearing Greek clothes.

===Gods and Bodhisattvas===

Deities from the Greek mythological pantheon also tend to be incorporated in Buddhist representations, displaying a strong syncretism. In particular, [[Herakles]] (of the type of the Demetrius coins, with club resting on the arm) has been used abundantly as the representation of [[Vajrapani]], the protector of the Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;"''The origin of the image of Vajrapani should be explained. This deity is the protector and guide of the Buddha Sakyamuni. His image was modelled after that of Hercules. (...) The Gandharan Vajrapani was transformed in Central Asia and China and afterwards transmitted to Japan, where it exerted stylistic influences on the wrestler-like statues of the Guardian Deities (Nio).''" (Katsumi Tanabe, "Alexander the Great, East-West cultural contacts from Greece to Japan", p23)&lt;/ref&gt; Other Greek deities abundantly used in Greco-Buddhist art are representation of [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]], and the Greek wind god [[Anemoi#Boreas|Boreas]]. Atlas in particular tends to be involved as a sustaining elements in Buddhist architectural elements. Boreas became the Japanese wind god [[Fūjin|Fujin]] through the Greco-Buddhist [[Wardo]]. The mother deity [[Hariti]] was inspired by [[Tyche]].

Particularly under the Kushans, there are also numerous representations of richly adorned, princely [[Bodhisattva]]s all in a very realistic Greco-Buddhist style. The [[Bodhisattvas]], characteristic of the [[Mahayana]] form of Buddhism, are represented under the traits of Kushan princes, completed with their canonical accessories.

Winged cupids are another popular motif in Greco-Buddhist art. They usually fly in pair, holding a [[wreath]], the Greek symbol of victory and kingship, over the Buddha.
[[File:CupidsAndBuddha.JPG|thumb|350px|alt=Winged Cupids holding a wreath over the Buddha from Hadda, Afghanistan|Winged [[Cupid]]s holding a wreath over the Buddha (left:detail), [[Hadda, Afghanistan|Hadda]], 3rd century. [[Musée Guimet]].]]
These figures, also known as "[[apsaras]]es" were extensively adopted in Buddhist art, especially throughout Eastern Asia, in forms derivative to the Greco-Buddhist representation. The progressive evolution of the style can be seen in the art of [[Qizil, Iran|Qizil]] and [[Dunhuang]]. It is unclear however if the concept of the flying cupids was brought to India from the West, of if it had an independent Indian origin, although Boardman considers it a Classical contribution: "Another Classical motif we found in India is the pair of hovering winged figures, generally called apsaras." (Boardman)

Scenes of cupids holding rich [[Garland (decoration)|garlands]], sometimes adorned with fruits, is another very popular Gandharan motif, directly inspired from Greek art. It is sometimes argued that the only concession to Indian art appears in the anklets worn by the cupids. These scenes had a very broad influence, as far as [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district|Amaravati]] on the eastern coast of India, where the cupids are replaced by [[yaksha|yakṣas]].

===Devotees===

[[Buner]], [[Swat (Pakistan)|Swat]], [[Pakistan]]. [[Victoria and Albert Museum]].]]
Some Greco-Buddhist friezes represent groups of donors or devotees, giving interesting insights into the cultural identity of those who participated in the Buddhist cult.

Some groups, often described as the "[[Buner reliefs]]," usually dated to the 1st century AD, depict Greeks in perfect Hellenistic style, either in posture, rendering, or clothing (wearing the Greek [[chiton (costume)|chiton]] and [[himation]]). It is sometimes even difficult to perceive an actual religious message behind the scenes. (The devotee scene on the right might, with doubt, depict of the presentation of Prince [[Gautama Buddha|Siddharta]] to his bride. It may also just be a festive scene.)

About a century later, friezes also depict Kushan devotees, usually with the Buddha as the central figure.

===Fantastic animals===
[[File:Ichthyo-Centaur.jpg|thumb|200px|left|alt=stone fragment An Ichthyo-Centaur, 2nd century Gandhara|An Ichthyo-Centaur, 2nd century Gandhara, [[Victoria and Albert Museum]].]]
Various fantastic animal deities of Hellenic origin were used as decorative elements in Buddhist temples, often triangular friezes in staircases or in front of Buddhist altars. The origin of these motifs can be found in Greece in the 5th century BC, and later in the designs of Greco-Bactrian perfume trays as those discovered in [[Sirkap]]. Among the most popular fantastic animals are [[triton (mythology)|tritons]], ichthyo-[[centaurs]] and [[ketos]] [[sea-monster]]s. It should be noted that similar fantastic animals are found in ancient Egyptian reliefs, and might therefore have been passed on to Bactria and India independently of Greek imperialism.

As fantastic animals of the sea, they were, in early Buddhism, supposed to safely bring the souls of dead people to Paradise beyond the waters. These motifs were later adopted in Indian art, where they influenced the depiction of the Indian monster [[Makara (Hindu mythology)|makara]], [[Varuna]]'s mount.

The later part of Greco-Buddhist art in northwestern India is usually associated with the [[Kushan Empire]]. The Kushans were nomadic people who started migrating from the [[Tarim Basin]] in [[Central Asia]] from around 170 BC and ended up founding an empire in northwestern India from the 2nd century BC. After conquering the lands once inhabited by Greco-Bactrians and Indo-Greeks, the Kushan Empire adopted Greco-Buddhist art.

==Southern influences==

===Art of the Shunga===

Examples of the influence of Hellenistic or Greco-Buddhist art on the art of the [[Shunga Empire]] (183-73 BC) are usually faint. The main religion, at least at the beginning, seems to have been [[Brahmanic Hinduism]], although some late Buddhist realizations in [[Madhya Pradesh]] as also known, such as some architectural expansions that were done at the [[stupa]]s of [[Sanchi]] and [[Bharhut]], originally started under King [[Ashoka]].

===Art of Mathura===
{{main|Mathura art}}
[[File:MathuraBodhisattvaSide.jpg|thumb|200px|alt=The Bodhisattva Maitreya, 2nd century,|The [[Bodhisattva]] [[Maitreya]], 2nd century, [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]].]]
[[File:MathuraBuddha.JPG|thumb|150px|left|alt=stone fragment A Bodhisattva, 2nd century, Mathura|A Bodhisattva, 2nd century, Mathura]]

The representations of the Buddha in [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]], in central northern India, are generally dated slightly later than those of Gandhara, although not without debate, and are also much less numerous. Up to that point, Indian Buddhist art had essentially been aniconic, avoiding representation of the Buddha, except for his symbols, such as the wheel or the [[Bodhi tree]], although some archaic Mathuran  sculptural representation of [[Yaksha|Yaksas]] (earth divinities) have been dated to the 1st century BC. Even these Yaksas indicate some Hellenistic influence, possibly dating back to the occupation of Mathura by the Indo-Greeks during the 2nd century BC.

In terms of artistic predispositions for the first representations of the Buddha, Greek art provided a very natural and centuries-old background for an anthropomorphic representation of a divinity, while on the contrary "there was nothing in earlier Indian statuary to suggest such a treatment of form or dress, and the Hindu pantheon provided no adequate model for an aristocratic and wholly human deity" (Boardman).

[[File:AmaravatiScroll.JPG|thumb|300px|alt=Greek scroll supported by Indian Yaksas|Greek scroll supported by Indian Yaksas, [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district|Amaravati]], 3rd century AD]]
The Mathura sculptures incorporate many Hellenistic elements, such as the general idealistic realism, and key design elements such as the curly hair, and folded garment. Specific Mathuran adaptations tend to reflect warmer climatic conditions, as they consist in a higher fluidity of the clothing, which progressively tend to cover only one shoulder instead of both. Also, facial types also tend to become more Indianized. Banerjee in ''Hellenism in ancient India'' describes "the mixed character of the Mathura School in which we find on the one hand, a direct continuation of the old Indian art of [[Bharhut]] and [[Sanchi]] and on the other hand, the classical influence derived from Gandhara".

The influence of Greek art can be felt beyond Mathura, as far as [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district|Amaravati]] on the East coast of India, as shown by the usage of Greek scrolls in combination with Indian deities. Other motifs such as Greek chariots pulled by four horses can also be found in the same area.

Incidentally, [[Hindu art]] started to develop from the 1st to the 2nd century AD and found its first inspiration in the Buddhist art of Mathura. It progressively incorporated a profusion of original Hindu stylistic and symbolic elements however, in contrast with the general balance and simplicity of Buddhist art.

The art of Mathura features frequent sexual imagery. Female images with bare breasts, nude below the waist, displaying labia and female genitalia are common. These images are more sexually explicit than those of earlier or later periods.

===Arts of Western India===
[[File:Head of Buddha Shakyamuni LACMA M.79.8.jpg|thumb|left|A terracotta head of Buddha Shakyamuni, inspired by Greco-Buddhist art, [[Devnimori]], [[Gujarat]] (375-400 CE).]]
[[File:089 Cave 10, Buddha Drawing on Column (33896473480) detail.jpg|thumb|upright|The Buddha in long, heavy robe, a design derived from the art of Gandhara, [[Ajanta Caves]], 5th century CE.&lt;ref&gt;The Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies, Volume 4 1981 Number I [https://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/jiabs/article/viewFile/8536/2443 An Exceptional Group of Painted Buddha Figures at Ajanṭā]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
It has been suggested that the art of [[Devnimori]] in [[Gujarat]], dated to the 4th century CE, represented a Western Indian artistic tradition, based on the influence of the Greco-Buddhist art of [[Gandhara]], that was anterior to the rise of [[Gupta Empire]] art, and that it may have influenced it, and have influenced the art of the [[Ajanta Caves]], [[Sarnath]] and other places from the 5th century onward.&lt;ref name="Schastok 28"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schastok|first1=Sara L.|title=The Śāmalājī Sculptures and 6th Century Art in Western India|date=1985|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9004069410|pages=28–31|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jh1fF8HvJmMC&amp;pg=PA24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Devnimori may also have received some influence from [[Mathura art]].&lt;ref name="Schastok 28"/&gt; At Ajanta, some connections with the art of Gandhara can be noted, and there is evidence of a shared artistic idiom.&lt;ref name="BRILL"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brancaccio|first1=Pia|title=The Buddhist Caves at Aurangabad: Transformations in Art and Religion|date=2010|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9004185259|page=107|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m_4pXm7dD78C&amp;pg=PA107|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site of Devnimori included numerous terracotta  Buddhist sculptures (but no stone sculptures), which are among the earliest sculptures that can be found in [[Gujarat]].&lt;ref name="Schastok"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schastok|first1=Sara L.|title=The Śāmalājī Sculptures and 6th Century Art in Western India|date=1985|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9004069410|pages=24–27|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jh1fF8HvJmMC&amp;pg=PA24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The style is clearly influenced by the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhara.&lt;ref name="JIABS"&gt;The Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies, Volume 4 1981 Number I [https://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/jiabs/article/viewFile/8536/2443 An Exceptional Group of Painted Buddha Figures at Ajanṭā, p.97 and Note 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Indo-Scythian]] [[Western Satraps]] (1st century CE-405 CE) may have played a role in the transmission of the art of Gandhara to the western [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] region, as may also have the southern expansion of the [[Alchon Huns]] in the 6th-7th century.&lt;ref name="BRILL"/&gt;

===Art of the Gupta===
[[File:GuptaBuddha.jpg|thumb|150px|left|alt=Buddha of the Gupta Empire|Buddha of the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] period, 5th century, Mathura.]]
[[File:MathuraBuddhaHead.JPG|thumb|200px|right|alt=large stone Head of a Buddha, Gupta period, 6th century.|Head of a Buddha, Gupta period, 6th century.]]
The art of Mathura acquired progressively more Indian elements and reached a very high sophistication during the [[Gupta Empire]], between the 4th and the 6th century AD. The art of the Gupta is considered as the pinnacle of Indian Buddhist art.

Hellenistic elements are still clearly visible in the purity of the statuary and the folds of the clothing, but are improved upon with a very delicate rendering of the draping and a sort of radiance reinforced by the usage of pink sandstone.
Artistic details tend to be less realistic, as seen in the symbolic shell-like curls used to render the hairstyle of the Buddha.{{clear}}

==Expansion in Central Asia==
Greco-Buddhist artistic influences naturally followed Buddhism in its expansion to Central and Eastern Asia from the 1st century BC.

===Bactria===
[[File:GBA1(trimmed).jpg|thumb|200px|alt=stone Statue from a Buddhist monastery 700 AD, Afghanistan|Statue from a Buddhist monastery 700 AD, Afghanistan]]
[[Bactria]] was under direct Greek control for more than two centuries from the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]] in 332 BC to the end of the [[Greco-Bactrian]] kingdom around 125 BC. The art of Bactria was almost perfectly Hellenistic as shown by the archaeological remains of [[Greco-Bactrian]] cities such as [[Alexandria on the Oxus]] ([[Ai-Khanoum]]), or the numismatic art of the Greco-Bactrian kings, often considered as the best of the Hellenistic world, and including the largest silver and gold coins ever minted by the Greeks.

When Buddhism expanded in Central Asia from the 1st century AD, Bactria saw the results of the [[Greco-Buddhist]] syncretism arrive on its territory from India, and a new blend of sculptural representation remained until the Islamic invasions.

The most striking of these realizations are the [[Buddhas of Bamyan]]. They tend to vary between the 5th and the 9th century AD. Their style is strongly inspired by Hellenistic culture.

In another area of Bactria called [[Fondukistan]], some Greco-Buddhist art survived until the 7th century in Buddhist monasteries, displaying a strong Hellenistic influence combined with Indian decorativeness and mannerism, and some influence by the [[Sasanid]] Persians.

Most of the remaining art of Bactria was destroyed from the 5th century onward: the Buddhists were often blamed for [[idolatry]] and tended to be persecuted by the [[iconoclastic]] Muslims. Destructions continued during the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan War]], and especially by the [[Taliban]] regime in 2001. The most famous case is that of the destruction of the [[Buddhas of Bamyan]]. Ironically, most of the remaining art from Afghanistan still extant was removed from the country during the Colonial period. In particular, a rich collection exists at the [[Musee Guimet]] in France.

===Tarim Basin===
[[File:SerindiaHead.JPG|thumb|150px|left|alt=terracotta Head of a Bodhisattva, 6th-7th century Tumshuq|Head of a Bodhisattva, 6th-7th century [[terracotta]], Tumshuq (Xinjiang).]]

The art of the [[Tarim Basin]], also called [[Serindian art]], is the art that developed from the 2nd through the 11th century AD in [[Serindia]] or [[Xinjiang]], the western region of China that forms part of [[Central Asia]]. It derives from the art of the [[Gandhara]] and clearly combines Indian traditions with Greek and Roman influences.

Buddhist missionaries travelling on the [[Silk Road]] introduced this art, along with [[Buddhism]] itself, into Serindia, where it mixed with Chinese and Persian influences.

==Influences in Eastern Asia==
The arts of China, Korea and Japan adopted Greco-Buddhist artistic influences, but tended to add many local elements as well. What remains most readily identifiable from Greco-Buddhist art are:
* The general idealistic realism of the figures reminiscent of Greek art.
* Clothing elements with elaborate Greek-style folds.
* The curly hairstyle characteristic of the Mediterranean.
* In some Buddhist representations, hovering winged figures holding a wreath.
* Greek sculptural elements such as vines and floral scrolls.

===China===
[[File:NorthernWeiMaitreya.JPG|thumb|left|170px|alt=bronze Northern Wei Buddha Maitreya, AD 443|Northern Wei Buddha Maitreya, AD 443.]]
Greco-Buddhist artistic elements can be traced in Chinese Buddhist art, with several local and temporal variations depending on the character of the various dynasties that adopted the Buddhist faith. Some of the earliest known Buddhist artifacts found in China are small statues on "money trees", dated circa AD 200, in typical Gandharan style: "That the imported images accompanying the newly arrived doctrine came from Gandhara is strongly suggested by such early Gandhara characteristics on this "money tree" Buddha as the high ushnisha, vertical arrangement of the hair, moustache, symmetrically looped robe and parallel incisions for the folds of the arms."&lt;ref&gt;"Crossroads of Asia" p209&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Northern Wei Dynasty|Northern Wei]] statues can be quite reminiscent of Gandharan standing Buddha, although in a slightly more symbolic style. The general attitude and rendering of the dress however remain. Other, like [[Northern Qi Dynasty]] statues also maintain the general Greco-Buddhist style, but with less realism and stronger symbolic elements.

Some [[Eastern Wei]] statues display Buddhas with elaborate Greek-style robe foldings, and surmounted by flying figures holding a wreath.

===Japan===
[[File:AsukaSeatedBuddha.jpg|thumb|left|180px|alt=The Buddha, Asuka period, 7th century.|The Buddha, [[Asuka period]], 7th century.]]

In Japan, Buddhist art started to develop as the country converted to Buddhism in AD 548. Some tiles from the [[Asuka period]], the first period following the conversion of the country to Buddhism, display a strikingly classical style, with ample Hellenistic dress and realistically rendered body shape characteristic of Greco-Buddhist art.

Other works of art incorporated a variety of Chinese and Korean influences, so that Japanese Buddhist became extremely varied in its expression. Many elements of Greco-Buddhist art remain to this day however, such as the [[Hercules]] inspiration behind the [[Nio]] guardian deities in front of Japanese Buddhist temples, or representations of the Buddha reminiscent of Greek art such as the Buddha in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]].&lt;ref&gt;"Needless to say, the influence of Greek art on Japanese Buddhist art, via the Buddhist art of Gandhara and India, was already partly known in, for example, the comparison of the wavy drapery of the Buddha images, in what was, originally, a typical Greek style" (Katsumi Tanabe, "Alexander the Great, East-West cultural contacts from Greece to Japan", p19)&lt;/ref&gt;

Various other Greco-Buddhist artistic influences can be found in the Japanese Buddhist pantheon, the most striking of which being that of the Japanese wind god [[Fūjin|Fujin]]. In consistency with Greek iconography for the wind god [[Anemoi#Boreas|Boreas]], the Japanese wind god holds above his head with his two hands a draping or "wind bag" in the same general attitude.&lt;ref&gt;"The Japanese wind god images do not belong to a separate tradition apart from that of their Western counter-parts but share the same origins. (...) One of the characteristics of these Far Eastern wind god images is the wind bag held by this god with both hands, the origin of which can be traced back to the shawl or mantle worn by [[Anemoi#Boreas|Boreas]]/ Oado." (Katsumi Tanabe, "Alexander the Great, East-West cultural contacts from Greece to Japan", p21)&lt;/ref&gt; The abundance of hair have been kept in the Japanese rendering, as well as exaggerated facial features.

4) [[Shukongoshin|Shukongōshin]], manifestation of [[Vajrapani]], as protector deity of Buddhist temples in Japan.]]
Another Buddhist deity, named [[Shukongoshin]], one of the wrath-filled protector deities of Buddhist temples in Japan, is also an interesting case of transmission of the image of the famous Greek god [[Herakles]] to the Far-East along the [[Silk Road]]. [[Herakles]] was used in Greco-Buddhist art to represent [[Vajrapani]], the protector of the Buddha, and his representation was then used in China and Japan to depict the protector gods of Buddhist temples.&lt;ref&gt;"The origin of the image of Vajrapani should be explained. This deity is the protector and guide of the Buddha Sakyamuni. His image was modelled after that of Hercules. (...) The Gandharan Vajrapani was transformed in Central Asia and China and afterwards transmitted to Japan, where it exerted stylistic influences on the wrestler-like statues of the Guardian Deities ([[Nio]])." (Katsumi Tanabe, "Alexander the Great, East-West cultural contacts from Greece to Japan", p23)&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the artistic inspiration from Greek floral scrolls is found quite literally in the decoration of Japanese roof tiles, one of the only remaining elements of wooden architecture to have survived the centuries. The clearest ones are from 7th century [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] temple building tiles, some of them exactly depicting vines and grapes. These motifs have evolved towards more symbolic representations, but essentially remain to this day in many Japanese traditional buildings.&lt;ref&gt;The transmission of the floral scroll pattern from West to East is presented in the regular exhibition of Ancient Japanese Art, at the [[Tokyo National Museum]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences on South-East Asian art==

The Indian civilization proved very influential on the cultures of [[South-East Asia]]. Most countries adopted Indian writing and culture, together with [[Hinduism]] and [[Mahayana]] and [[Theravada]] [[Buddhism]].

The influence of Greco-Buddhist art is still visible in most of the representation of the Buddha in South-East Asia, through their idealism, realism and details of dress, although they tend to intermix with Indian Hindu art, and they progressively acquire more local elements.
{{clear}}

==Cultural significance==
Beyond stylistic elements which spread throughout Asia for close to a millennium, the main contribution of Greco-Buddhist art to the Buddhist faith may be in the Greek-inspired idealistic realism which helped describe in a visual and immediately understandable manner the state of personal bliss and enlightenment proposed by Buddhism. The communication of deeply human approach of the Buddhist faith, and its accessibility to all have probably benefited from the Greco-Buddhist artistic syncretism.{{says who?|date=July 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13247">'''Harold D. Roth''' is a professor of [[religious studies]] and the Director of the Contemplative Studies Initiative at Brown University. Roth is a specialist in Methods of [[Textual Criticism]] and Textual History, Classical Chinese Religious Thought, [[Daoism|Classical Daoism]], the Comparative Study of Mysticism and one of the pioneers of the new interdisciplinary academic field of Contemplative Studies.

==Biography==
During an academic career spanning over three decades, Roth has done ground- breaking work in three major intellectual fields. In the first, textual criticism, following the lead of the late SOAS professor Paul Thompson, Roth did the first complete textual history of a major Classical Chinese philosophical work, which he published in his first book, ''The Textual History of the Huai-nan Tzu''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roth|first1=Harold|title=The Textual History of the Huainanzi|date=1992|publisher=Association for Asian Studies Monograph No. 46|location=Ann Arbor}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working towards the goal of establishing modern critical editions of all the major extant works of the classical period, Roth developed a distinctive method he called "Filiation Analysis", a technique for determining the broadest range of possibly authentic textual variants using the bare minimum number of editions. This is detailed in his very first publication,  "Filiation Analysis and the Textual Criticism of the Huai-nan Tzu".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roth|first1=Harold|title=Filiation Analysis and the Textual Criticism of the Huai-nan Tzu|journal=Transactions of the Conference  of Orientalists in Japan|date=1982|volume=27|issue=December|pages=60–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is further developed as a model for all classical Chinese philosophical texts in a later publication, "Text and Edition in Early Chinese Philosophical Literature".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roth|first1=Harold|title=Text and Edition in Early Chinese Philosophical Literature|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|date=April–June 1993|volume=113|issue=2|pages=18–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second major area in which Roth has done pioneering work is in reconstructing the lost history and contemplative dimensions of the late Warring States and early Han dynasty tradition that he dubbed "inner cultivation". It is this tradition that was given the moniker "Daoism" by the Grand Historian [[Sima Tan]] circa 110 BCE.  Beginning with three publications in the early to mid 1990s, "Psychology and Self-Cultivation in Early Taoistic Thought",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roth|first1=Harold|title=Psychology and Self-Cultivation in Early Taoistic Thought|journal=Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies|date=December 1991|volume=51|issue=2|pages=599–650|doi=10.2307/2719289}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Who Compiled the Chuang Tzu?",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Harold D. Roth|authorlink1=Who Compiled the Chuang Tzu?|editor1-last=Rosemont, Jr.|editor1-first=Henry|title=Chinese Texts and Philosophical Contexts: Essays Dedicated to Angus C. Graham|date=1991|publisher=Open Court Press|location=London|pages=79–128}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Redaction Criticism and the Early History of Taoism",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roth|first1=Harold D.|title=Redaction Criticism and the Early History of Daoism|journal=Early China|date=1994|volume=19|pages=1–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roth began a detailed textual analysis of classical Chinese texts on inner cultivation demonstrating that they contained a distinctive set of technical terms that could be organized under three philosophical categories: cosmology, psychology/inner cultivation, and political thought. Expanding the work of [[A.C. Graham]], he further determined that these extant sources of inner cultivation could be organized into three distinctive philosophical groupings, "Individualist", Primitivist, and Syncretist and argued these could be considered different phases in the development of this classical Daoist tradition. Roth systematized these arguments in providing the intellectual context for his translation of a short and distinctive text entitled ''[[Neiye]]'' ("Inward Training"), one of 76 works in the Guanzi 管子 compendium, published in his second book, ''Original Tao: Inward Training and the Foundations of Taoist Mysticism''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roth|first1=Harold D.|title=Original Tao: Inward Training and the Foundations of Taoist Mysticism|date=1999|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; and returned to them in a recent article detailed the contributions to the development of the foundational philosophical idea of li 理 (Pattern, Principle) made by this classical Daoist tradition in "The Classical Daoist Concept of Li and Early Chinese Cosmology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roth|first1=Harold D.|title=The Classical Daoist Concept of Li and Early Daoist Cosmology|journal=Early China|date=2012–2013|volume=35-36|issue=Studies in Honor of Li Xueqin|pages=157–184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In developing these theories about the inner cultivation tradition Roth broke new ground in systematically applying the methods of the philosophical analysis of different traditions of mystical experience to the classical Chinese religious traditions. In addition to being summarized in Original Tao, his work in this area is detailed in a number of important other publications: "Evidence for Stages of Meditation in Early Taoism",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roth|first1=Harold D.|title=Evidence for the Stages of Meditation in Early Taoism|journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies|date=June 1997|volume=60|issue=2|pages=295–314|doi=10.1017/s0041977x00036405}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Lao Tzu in the Context of Early Taoist Mystical Praxis",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Harold D. Roth|authorlink1=Lao Tzu in the Context of Early Taoist Mystical Practice|editor1-last=Csikszentmihalyi|editor1-first=Mark|editor2-last=Ivanhoe|editor2-first=P.J.|title=Essays on Religious and Philosophical Aspects of the Lao Tzu|date=1999|publisher=SUNY Press|location=Albany|pages=59–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; and  "Bimodal Mystical Experience in the 'Qiwulun' of Zhuangzi".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roth|first1=Harold D.|title=Bimodal Experience in the 'Qiwulun' of Zhuangzi|journal=Journal of Chinese Religions|date=2000|volume=28|pages=1–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting when he entered the Ph.D. program at the [[University of Toronto]] in 1975, Roth began a fascination with the early [[Han dynasty]]  (139 BCE) philosophical compendium, the [[Huainanzi]]  淮南子, until recently the last great untranslated work of classical Chinese philosophy. Intended as a comprehensive multi-authored text detailing all the fields of knowledge with which the Chinese emperor needed to be conversant, the Huainanzi contains chapters on cosmology and cosmogony, astronomy, geography, rulership, and warfare, to name a few of its major topics. Roth has argued that while the Huainanzi is inclusive of a very wide range philosophical ideas from many traditions, that its overarching intellectual context is provided by the inner cultivation tradition of classical Daoism. After working on the textual history of this major work in his first book, in the mid 1990s Roth developed a project for the first complete English translation with colleague John Major and, eventually, a small cohort of additional scholars that included, most importantly, Sarah Queen and Andrew Meyer. Together they succeeded in finally publishing a complete translation, The Huainanzi:  A Guide to the Theory and Practice of Government in Early Han China&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Major|first1=John, et. al.|title=The Huainanzi: A Guide to the Theory and Practice of Government in Early Han China|date=2010|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an abridged translation, The Essential Huainanzi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Major|first1=John, et. al.|title=The Essential Huainanzi|date=2012|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his work on these translations and to his first book, Roth has published his ideas on the philosophy of the Huainanzi  in a number of publications, including "The Concept of Human Nature in the Huai-nan Tzu",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roth|first1=Harold|title=The Concept of Human Nature in the Huai-nan Tzu|journal=Journal of Chinese Philosophy|date=April 1985|volume=12|pages=1–22|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6253.1985.tb00425.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Nature and Self-Cultivation in Huainanzi's 'Original Way'",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roth, Harold D.|authorlink1=Nature and Self-Cultivation in Huainanzi's 'Original Way'|editor1-last=Chandler|editor1-first=Mark|editor2-last=Littlejohn|editor2-first=Ronnie|title=Polishing the Chinese Mirror: Essays in Honor of Henry Rosemont|date=2007|publisher=Global Scholarly Publications|location=New York|pages=270–290}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Daoist Inner Cultivation Thought and the Textual Structure of the Huainanzi",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Harold D.

Roth|authorlink1=Daoism in the Guanzi|editor1-last=Liu|editor1-first=Xiaogan|title=Dao Companion to Daoist Philosophy|date=2014|publisher=Springer Press|location=New York|pages=265–280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roth has not only been a leader in developing the new academic field of "Contemplative Studies", he is also the person who first coined the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kaleem|first1=Jaweed|title=Contemplative Studies Grow at Brown University- And Beyond|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/10/contemplative-studies-brown_n_6124030.html|website=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combining the disciplines of the relevant Brain Sciences, Humanities, and Creative Arts around the systematic third and first-person study of contemplative experiences, across cultures and across time, this new field presents bold new pedagogies and research techniques that return the unbiased perspective of the experiencing subject to both classroom and laboratory. Inspired by the work of scientists such as Francisco Varela, James Austin, and Richard Davidson, philosophers such as William James and Evan Thompson, and educators such as John Dewey and Parker Palmer, Brown Contemplative Studies has served as a model for research institutes and academic programs at many institutions of higher education throughout North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hinchliffe|first1=Emma|title=Contemplating a New Major? Try Contemplative Studies|url=http://college.usatoday.com/2014/06/03/contemplating-a-new-major-try-contemplative-studies/|website=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roth has helped pioneer the field through such publications as "Contemplative Studies: Prospects for a New Field", Columbia Teacher's College Record (2006); "Against Cognitive Imperialism", Religion East and West (2008); "Contemplative Studies:  Can It Flourish in the Religious Studies Classroom?" Meditation and  the Classroom: Contemplative Pedagogy for Religious Studies (2011);  and "A Pedagogy for the New Field of Contemplative Studies", Contemplative Approaches to Learning and Inquiry across Disciplines (2014). In 2014 Brown University became the first major North American Research University to establish a formal undergraduate concentration (major) in Contemplative Studies. This pioneering multi-disciplinary concentration requires 14 courses including a core set of 5 required courses in relevant Brain Sciences and Humanities. Students then choose a Sciences track that features Cognitive Psychology and Neuroscience or a Humanities Track that features Philosophy of Mind and Contemplative Religious Traditions. Art concentrations within the Humanities Track are also possible.

Additionally, Roth has served these academic fields in a variety of ways. He served on the Board of Directors of the Society for the Study of Chinese Religions for a decade starting in 1993, during which time he has also served on the editorial boards of four international journals of Daoism and Early Chinese Studies. In addition to this he was the founder and Co-Organizer of the New England Symposium on Chinese Thought (1988–93), the organizer of four academic panels at the Association for Asian Studies and American Oriental Society, and the Co-Organizer of the Second American-Japanese Conference on Taoist Studies (1998).  He has been a member of the initial Steering Committees for two groups within the American Academy of Religion, the Daoist Studies Section and the Contemplative Studies Group.

'''''Issues in Science and Religion''''' is a book by [[Ian Barbour]].  A biography provided by the [[John Templeton Foundation]] and published by [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] online states this book "has been credited with literally creating the contemporary field of [[Relationship between science and religion|science and religion]]."&lt;ref name=PBS1&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/forum/june99/barbour_bio.html |title=The PBS Online Newhour  May 28, 1999  |accessdate=2008-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
The book is divided into three parts. The first part is concerned with the history of [[science and religion]], the second with the methods of science and religion, and the third with the issues themselves.

Barbour provides introductions to several [[schools of philosophy]] in order to give the reader knowledge enough to understand how relations between science and religion look from these distinct viewpoints.&lt;ref&gt;''Issues in Science and Religion'' (1966), page 115&lt;/ref&gt; The book also includes several specific, non-philosophical areas of science are employed in its discussion. Several specific concepts and objects are brought up in the discussion generally along with summaries of significant criticisms.

== Part 1: Religion and the History of Science ==
In this part Barbour provides an overview of how scientific discovery has influenced theology throughout the 17th, 18th, 19th and 20th centuries.  The major scientific discoveries made in the 17th century included those made by [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]].  The [[scientific discoveries]] made by Galileo and Newton began to describe and explain the natural and [[physical laws]] by which the earth operates.  These discoveries drastically changed the way that man viewed the world and nature.  This in turn caused shifts in theological thought.  [[Natural theology]] emerged, where God was able to fill the scientific gaps and was responsible for the orderliness of nature.  The idea of God as the "Divine Clockmaker" and the beginning of Deism can also be traced back to the 17th century.

During the 18th century the Age of Reason and Romanticism greatly shaped views on science and theology.  Deism became very popular during this time among many Enlightenment scholars.  Romanticism, on the other hand, led to an appreciation of the underlying spirituality in nature and in man, and God's personal relationship with man and nature.  This in turn led to the concepts of moral and religious experience, which focused on man's intuition and imagination in relation to their religious experience.

The theory of evolution was developed by [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] in the 19th century.  This essentially eliminated the "God of the gaps" that had come about in the 17th century.  Liberal theologians accepted the theory of evolution, and held the opinion that God works continuously through the evolutionary process.  On the other hand conservatives still insisted on [[Biblical literalism]], and they rejected Darwin's theory.  For the most part theologians began to focus more on the human experience for their basis of theology.

In the next two parts of the book, Barbour goes into details of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Barbour, Ian. ''Issues in Science and Religion'' (1966). Part 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Part 2: Religion and the Methods of Science ==
In this section a whole chapter is devoted to the methods of scientific discovery.  Barbour asserts that scientific discovery is based on a critical realism, where it is recognized that scientific theory is not infallible in itself but is based on universal truths.  Due to this line of thinking, as scientific knowledge changes an over-all advance is made.  The next chapter compares the study of science to the study of history.  This chapter focuses on the objectivity of science versus the subjectivity of history.  History is seen as subjective  because one is dealing with the humanities and there is a level of personal involvement.  Although throughout history certain patterns of human behavior emerge, these patterns are never entirely predictable or repeatable.  Where in science, all events that are observed must be repeatable and produce the same results in order to uphold natural laws.  The following chapter examines the methods of religion.  In this chapter some comparisons are made between the methods of science and the methods of religion, in particular regarding experience, community and the use of models to explain an event or concept.  Although there are parallels between the methods of science and religion, there are also difference.  One major difference is the same as the difference between science and history.  Like history, religion is subjective due to the personal involvement required of religion.  The final chapter of this section discusses the language used in religion and science.  This chapter asserts that although there are many similarities in the methods and language of science and religion, the two subjects remain distinctly different in their purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Barbour, Ian. ''Issues in Science and Religion'' (1966). Part 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Part 3: Religion and the Theory of Science ==
The first chapter in this section examines contemporary physics, in particular indeterminacy as shown in the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.  This indeterminacy in the behavior of atoms can be generalized to apply to humanity as a whole.  This argument rests on the unpredictability of a single person and their action.  Barbour concludes this chapter by stating that although physics can be used to explain human freedom to some extent, it will never produce an entirely satisfactory argument for it.  The next chapter addresses how the idea that man is simply a machine that can be broken up into respective systems and thus is completely predictable, is not satisfactory in the scientific world.  It can be seen through science and the study of DNA, that each human has a unique identity and sense of selfhood.  This is supported biblically, in that God's love for each human being is unique to that person. The next chapter expresses varying viewpoints on creation and evolution, from conservative to liberal theology.  In more conservative lines of thought biblical literalism points to the creation of man as a divine point in creation, and therefore rejects the idea of man evolving from other life forms.  The liberal side of theology embraces the theory of evolution, and incorporates it with scripture into a doctrine of continuing creation.  The final chapter in this book examines God's relation to nature.  There are many different views on how God is related to nature.  Those who hold more conservative views believe in God's sovereignty over nature.  Others look at God's role in nature through a historical context, where God has evoked certain responses in nature throughout the course of time.&lt;ref&gt;Barbour, Ian.

Some organizations do not allow the lay leader to give sacraments for example, but do allow them to perform most other portions of the service that are normally the responsibility of the clergy (e.g. giving sermons when the regular clergy are on vacation).

==By denomination==
The Assemblies of God official position paper on Ordination states, "When necessary, the laity can perform all of the functions of ministry except those for which the State requires an ordained minister."

In [[The United Methodist Church]] the lay leader refers to the principal layperson in a local church, district or [[Annual Conference]] who represents and leads the laity in ministry. It is an elected position, and the lay leader will serve on most church committees.   

Various titles are used for lay leaders in different religious organizations, including [[lay preacher]]; [[lay reader]] (in Episcopal churches); [[lay speaker]] (in the United Methodist Church, USA); [[local preacher]] (in the UK [[Methodist]] [[Church body|Church]] and the Uniting Church in Australia); Reader (in the Anglican Church); and [[deacon]], though this last title can also refer to an ordained ministry.

==Responsibilities==
The following list gives examples of things lay leaders may be responsible for:
* acting as [[Church usher|usher]]s
* acting as [[liturgist]]s
* making announcements
* reading scripture
* giving guest preaching [[sermon]]s
* conducting a complete service
* serving or chairing church committees
* congregational advocate and liaison

'''Lenyadri''' ({{lang-mr|लेण्याद्री}}, Leṇyādri), sometimes called '''Ganesa Lena''', '''Ganesh Pahar''' Caves, or '''Suleman Caves''', represents a series of about 30 rock-cut [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] caves, located about 5km north of [[Junnar]] in [[Pune district]] in the [[India]]n state of [[Maharashtra]]. Other caves surrounding the city of Junnar are: [[Manmodi caves]], [[Shivneri caves]] and [[Tulja caves]].

Cave 7, originally a Buddhist [[vihara]], has been adapted as a [[Hindu temple]] dedicated to the god [[Ganesha]]. It is one of the [[Ashtavinayak]] shrines, a set of the eight prominent Ganesha shrines in Western Maharashtra. Twenty-six of the caves are individually numbered. The caves face to the south and are numbered serially from east to west.&lt;ref name ="asi"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gazetteer/&gt;&lt;ref name=Edwardes/&gt; Caves 6 and 14 are ''[[chaitya-griha]]s'' (chapels), while the rest are ''[[vihara]]s'' (dwellings for monks). The latter are in the form of dwellings and cells. There are also several rock-cut water cisterns; two of them have inscriptions. The layout of the caves, in general, are similar in pattern and shape. They generally have one or two sides with two long benches for occupants' use.&lt;ref name ="asi"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gazetteer/&gt;&lt;ref name=Edwardes/&gt;

The caves date from between the 1st and 3rd century AD; the Ganesha shrine situated in Cave 7 is dated to the 1st century AD,&lt;ref name ="asi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Feldhaus p. 143"&gt;Feldhaus p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; though the date of conversion to a Hindu shrine is unknown. All of the caves arise from [[Hinayana]] Buddhism.&lt;ref name ="asi"/&gt;

==Names==
The current name "Lenyadri" literally means "mountain cave". It is derived from 'Lena' in [[Marathi language|Marathi]] meaning "cave" and 'adri' in [[Sanskrit]] meaning "mountain" or "stone".&lt;ref&gt;Grimes p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; The name "Lenyadri" appears in the Hindu scripture [[Ganesha Purana]] as well as in a [[Sthala Purana]], in association to the Ganesha legend.&lt;ref name = "asi"/&gt; It is also called ''Jeernapur'' and ''Lekhan parvat'' ("Lekhan mountain").&lt;ref name = "transport"/&gt;

The hill is also known as ''Suleman Pahar'' ("Suleman hill") or ''Ganesh Pahar'' ("Ganesha hill"). An ancient inscription calls the place ''Kapichita (Kapichitta)''. The caves are also known as ''Ganesh Lena'' or Ganesh Caves.&lt;ref name = "asi"/&gt;

==Geography==

Lenyadri is located at {{coord|19|14|34|N|73|53|8|E|region:IN_type:landmark}}, in the Indian state of [[Maharashtra]] in [[Pune district]].

The circular hill, where Lenyadri caves have been emboweled, raises about 100&amp;nbsp;ft above the plains in the Hatkeshwar and Suleiman ranges.&lt;ref name=Edwardes/&gt;

Lenyadri is the only Ashtavinayaka temple on a mountain and within the precincts of Buddhist caves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ashtavinayak.net/lenyadri/index.php|title=SHREE GIRIJATMAJA - LENYADRI|work=Ashtavinayaka Darshan Online|accessdate=5 February 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122094529/http://www.ashtavinayak.net/lenyadri/index.php|archivedate=22 January 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture===
The Ganesha temple is located in Cave 7, the largest excavation around [[Junnar]], about {{convert|100|ft|m}} above the plains. It is essentially a Buddhist ''[[Vihara]]'' (a dwelling for monks, mostly with meditation cells) in design, an unpillared hall with 20 cells with varying dimensions; 7 on either side and 6 on the rear wall. The hall is large, can be entered by a central door, under a pillared [[veranda]]. The hall is {{convert|17.37|m|ft}} long; {{convert|15.54|m|ft}} wide and {{convert|3.38|m|ft}} high. There are 2 windows on either side of the entrance.&lt;ref name="asi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asi.nic.in/asi_monu_tktd_maha_junnarcaves.asp|title= Lenyadri Group of Caves, Junnar|year=2009|work=Archaeological Survey of India official site|publisher=Archaeological Survey of India, Government of India|accessdate=4 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Edwardes&gt;{{Cite book|last=Edwardes|first= S.

In a later period, the two central cells of the rear wall have been combined by breaking the partition in between to house the Ganesha image.&lt;ref name="asi"/&gt; The old entrance was also widened during the conversion to the Ganesha temple. There are two other smaller entrances to the hall. All entrances bear marks of sockets for fixing wooden doors, added during the conversion,&lt;ref name=Gazetteer/&gt; and still have doors. The hall also has traces of plaster and paintings,&lt;ref name="asi"/&gt; both added during the conversion and renewed in later times - possibly as late as the 19th century.&lt;ref name="wonderm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wondermondo.com/Countries/As/India/Maharashtra/Lenyandri.htm|title=Lenyadri Caves, Junnar - rock cut Buddhist temples|year=2010|publisher=Wondermondo|accessdate=30 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gazetteer of the [[Bombay Presidency]] (1882) records that the hall was plastered and white-washed. The paintings depicted Ganesha's childhood, marriage preparations, battle with demons and so forth, along with scenes of other Hindu deities like [[Devi]], [[Krishna]], [[Vishnu]] and [[Shiva]].&lt;ref name=Gazetteer&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency |accessdate=2010-02-02 |url=http://www.maharashtra.gov.in/pdf/gazeetter_reprint/Poona-III/places_j.html#. |chapter=Junnar |publisher=Govt.

Nine [[Sati (practice)|Sati]] memorials were added on the left wall during the conversion, each is in the shape of a long pillar with an arched top, and to the right of each pillar a hand raised above the elbow, with an open palm, signifies Sati's blessing. While three panels were plain, the other memorials were sculpted. All of them are worn out, but one of them hints that its subject may be the immolation of Sati on her husband's funeral pyre.&lt;ref name=Gazetteer/&gt;

The Ganesha form worshipped here is called Girijatmaja ({{lang-sa|गिरिजात्मज}}).

The features of the Ganesha icon, seen on the back wall of the cave, are the least distinct vis-a-vis the other Ashtavinayak temples. Though the temple faces the inauspicious south, - according to a local tradition - the deity faces north, with his back to his worshipper and his face visible on the other side of the mountain. The [[Peshwa]] rulers even tried in vain to locate the face of Ganesha on the other side.&lt;ref name="pune"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Subramuniya/&gt;&lt;ref name = "F249"&gt;Feldhaus p. 249&lt;/ref&gt; The central icon was covered with brass-plated wooden armour, given as a gift by Junnar. [[Brahmins]],&lt;ref name=Gazetteer/&gt; The armour is not present currently.  After it was removed, Ganesha could be seen with his trunk turned to the left side, facing east, with one of his eyes visible. The icon is covered with [[sindoor]] and is directly formed/sculpted on the stone wall of the cave.

Like all Ashtavinayaka temples, the central Ganesha image is believed to be ''[[svayambhu]]'' (self-existent), a naturally occurring stone formation resembling an elephant-face.&lt;ref&gt;Grimes pp. 110–1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legend===
[[File:Lenyadri Ganesha.jpg|thumb|The sanctum and central icon]]

According to the [[Ganapatya]] scripture [[Ganesha Purana]], Ganesha incarnated as Mayuresvara or Mayureshwar ({{IAST|Mayūreśvara}}), who had six arms and a white complexion. His mount was a peacock. He was born to [[Shiva]] and [[Parvati]] in the [[Treta yuga]], for the purpose of killing the demon Sindhu.&lt;ref name = "Grimes102"/&gt;

Once Parvati (Girija) asked her husband Shiva who he was meditating on. He said he was meditating on "the supporter of the entire universe" - Ganesha, and initiated Parvati with the Ganesha Mantra "Gam". Desiring to have a son, Parvati underwent austerities meditating on Ganesha, for twelve years at Lenyadri. Pleased by her penance, Ganesha blessed her with the boon that he will be born as her son. Accordingly, on the fourth lunar day of the bright fortnight of the [[Hindu month]] [[Bhadrapada]] ([[Ganesh chaturthi]] day), Parvati worshipped a clay image of Ganesha, which came alive. Thus, Ganesha was born to Parvati at Lenyadri. Later, he was named Gunesha by Shiva. Shiva gave him a boon that whosoever remembers him before starting a job, will successfully complete that task. For 15 years Gunesha grew up at Lenyadri. Sindhu, who knew that his death would be at the hands of Gunesha, sent demons like Krur, Balasur, Vyomasur, Kshemma, Kushal, and many more, to kill Gunesha, but all of them were instead killed by him. At the age of six, the architect-god [[Vishwakarma]] worshipped Gunesha and endowed him with the weapons Pasha (noose), [[Parashu]] (axe), [[Ankusha]] (hook) and [[Padma (attribute)|Padma]] (Lotus). Once, little Gunesha knocked an egg from a mango tree, from which emerged a peacock. Gunesha mounted the peacock and assumed the name Mayuresvara. Mayuresvara later killed Sindhu and his army-generals at [[Morgaon]], the most important Ashtavinayaka temple.&lt;ref name = "F249"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Grimes102"&gt;Grimes pp. 102–3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grimes pp.13–14&lt;/ref&gt;

===Worship===
Lenyadri is one of the eight revered Ganesha temples collectively called [[Ashtavinayaka]]. While some believe that order of visiting the temples in an Ashtavinayaka pilgrimage is irrelevant, Lenyadri is usually visited as the 6th temple.&lt;ref&gt;Feldhaus pp. 143, 145-6&lt;/ref&gt;

The caves including the temple lie under the control of the [[Archaeological Survey of India]]. Sardar Deshpande is the priest in charge of the temple's activities.&lt;ref name=Gunaji&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gunaji|first=Milind|title=Offbeat tracks in Maharashtra|chapter=Lenyadri|pages=110–1|accessdate=2009-11-26|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JIjmDLardesC&amp;pg=PA110&amp;dq=lenyadri&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=lenyadri&amp;f=false|publisher=Popular Prakashan|year=2003|isbn=9788171546695}}&lt;/ref&gt; He does not stay in Lenyadri.

==''Chaityas'' (chapels)==
; Cave 6
[[File:Lenyadri Chaitya external view.jpg|thumb|left|Front of Cave 6, the main [[Chaitya]].]]
[[File:Lenyadri Chaitya hall.jpg|thumb|300px|Lenyadri [[Chaitya]] hall, cave No.6]]
Cave 6 is the main  ''[[chaitya-griha]]'' of the Lenyadri caves and one of the earliest examples of a [[Hinayana]] chaitya-griha.&lt;ref name = "asi"/&gt; Its plan is similar to the [[Ajanta Caves]] chaitya-griha, though smaller in size. It has a veranda, pillars and pilasters with animal-capitals, and a shrine with 5 steps at the entrance. The shrine hall is entered by a plain and a socketed-door measuring {{convert|1.8|m|ft}} in width and {{convert|2.79|m|ft}} in height. The hall measures {{convert|13.3|m|ft}} in length; {{convert|6.7|m|ft}} in width and {{convert|7|m|ft}} in height. It has a row of five pillars and one pilaster on each side of the ''chaitya'' or ''Dagoba'' or ''[[stupa]]'' (central relic-shrine), located at the rear of the hall. A start was made on a typical large arched window above the entrance, but this was never completed, and remains a blind recess. 

[[File:Lenyadri Chaitya pillar capitals.jpg|thumb|Lenyadri Chaitya pillar capitals.]]
[[File:Lenyadri chaitya dagoba.jpg|thumb|right|Chaitya dagoba.]]
The Satakarni period pillars begin with a four-plated pyramid structure, then a waterpot base, followed by an eight-sided shaft, above a reversed pot, then a capital in five plates, and on the top the ''amalaka'' or cogwheel pattern. The capital has animal figures like lions, elephants, a [[sphinx]] and tigers. Parts of the pillar are broken. Behind the relic-shrine, are six eight-sided pillars, arranged in a curve. "The stupa consists of a drum with a moulding below and railing above, a globular dome and a [[corbel]]led (with "a projection jutting out from a wall to support a structure above it")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/corbel?view=uk|title=Cobel|work=Oxford Dictionary|accessdate=1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; dome with a railing at the base." The stupa has Buddhist tridents carved on it. A hole is carved for fixing garlands in the front and 5 holes on the top probably to fix a central wooden umbrella and side flags. A 2nd century, swastika-flanked inscription on the back wall of the veranda translates: "A meritorious gift of a chapel cave by the distinguished Sulasadata, son of Heranika of Kalyana [modern [[Kalyan, India|Kalyan]] near [[Mumbai]]]."&lt;ref name = "asi"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gazetteer/&gt;

Between caves 5 and 6, on higher level, is an excavation originally intended either for a dwelling or for a seat, but converted into a cistern following discovery of a rock-fault. On its left side is a bench.&lt;ref name=Gazetteer/&gt;

; Cave 14

This cave, also a chaitya-griha, has a flat roof. However, it has no pillars in the hall that measures {{convert|6.75|m|ft}} in length; {{convert|3.93|m|ft}} in width and {{convert|4.16|m|ft}} in height. It has a pillared veranda; pillars are in octagonal shape. The stupa is in three steps with a base of {{convert|2.6|m|ft}} diameter. The rim has a railing design surrounded by a cylindrical drum with "a square harmika with railing pattern and an inverted stepped pyramidal abacus." A carved [[chhatri]] covers the ceiling. The pillars of the veranda consist of octagonal shafts resting on ''ghata'' base over a stepped pedestal. An inverted [[kalasha]] adorns the top, which also has a corbelled abacus. Inscription on the back wall of the veranda dates the cave to the 2nd century A.D. The inscription translates as: "A meritorious gift of a chapel cave given by Ananda, a son of Tapasa and grandson of Upasaka."&lt;ref name = "asi"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gazetteer/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Lenyadri Group Of Caves.JPG|Lenaydri caves public notice]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other ''viharas'' (monk dwellings)==
[[File:Lenyadri panorama.jpg|thumb|center|800px|Lenyadri cave complex. The caves are numbered from right to left (east to west).]]
;Cave 1

Cave 1 is divided into four parts: a veranda, a middle room, a cell, and a half cell. The veranda has a bench along the right wall. Its front possibly had two quadrangular pillars, traces of one are seen around the ceiling. A rock beam was present over the pillars, above the beam ribs and a rail pattern could have existed. In a recess below the veranda is an earth-filled [[cistern]]. A door with a small window to the left leads into the middle room. The middle room has a bench along the right wall. Towards the back of the middle room, to the left, is the half cell and to the right the cell. The half-cell has a bench along the right wall and to the left, has a square window connecting it to cave 2. A door with grooves for fitting a wooden frame, leads into the cell which has a bench along its right wall.&lt;ref name=Gazetteer/&gt;

; Cave 2
[[File:Lenyadri pillars &amp; a monkey.jpg|thumb|Lenyadri pillars &amp; a monkey.]]
Cave 2 is similar to cave 1 in design. The veranda has two pillars and two pilasters, a bench between each pillar and pilaster with curtains in the back, which have a rail pattern. Over the pillars rests the rail-patterned rock beam, above which is the ceiling. Parts of the pillars and pilasters are broken. In front over the beam project rock imitations of [[rafter]]s. A doorway with grooves for a wooden frame, leads into a middle room, with a bench along the left wall. The position of the hall-cell and cell are exchanged with respect to cave 1 design. Each has a bench.&lt;ref name=Gazetteer/&gt;

; Cave 3
 
Cave 3 has an open veranda and a cell. The veranda has a bench along the back wall. A door leads to a cell, which has a seat in a left recess. In front of the recess, below the seat, are vertical bands. Between caves 2 and 3 there is a seat in the front, in a recess.&lt;ref name=Gazetteer/&gt;

; Cave 4
 
Cave 4 has an open veranda and a cell. The veranda has a bench, along the back wall. A grooved door leads to a cell, which has a bench along the right wall. A broken window is to the left of door and to its right, a small hole, which could have been used to wash feet before entering the cell.&lt;ref name=Gazetteer/&gt;

; Cave 5

Cave 5 is located {{convert|12|ft|m}} lower to left of cave 4. It is divided into 3 parts: veranda, a middle hall and seven cells of varying size, three in the back wall and two in each side wall. Thus it is known as a ''saptagarbha layana'' (seven cell dwelling). The veranda had two pillars and two pilasters with pot capitals of the [[Satakarni]] period (B.C. 90-A.D. 300), of which only the right broken pilaster and a trace of the base of the right pillar remain. In front of the veranda, an open court with two steps lead to the veranda. To the right of the court is a cistern. In the back wall of the veranda, to the left of the door to the middle hall, close under the broken verandah ceiling, is a single line inscription, flanked by the Buddhist trident in the beginning and [[swastika]] at the end. It is translated as: "A meritorious gift of a seven-celled cave and cistern by a guild of corn-dealers." The door also has windows on both its sides. Throughout the middle hall in the front of the cells is a bench. A bench is also built in the back wall of the cells.&lt;ref name=Gazetteer/&gt;

[[File:Lenyadri Temple.jpg|right|thumb|Approach to the Ganesha cave temple (Cave 7), seen at the top left. In the middle, a ''vihara'' located under the cave shrine is seen.]]
; Cave 8

Cave 8 is a difficult-to-reach dwelling. It consists of a veranda with a cell and a half cell in its back wall, both entered through the veranda. The cell has a broken door, a small window, benched recess and a peg hole. The half cell has an open front and a bench at the back.&lt;ref name=Gazetteer/&gt;

; Cave 9

Cave 9 located to the right of Cave 8, can be entered via the latter's veranda. Cave 9 has its own veranda and a hall. The veranda has four Satakarni-period, broken pillars. The hall has a larger central door - with windows on either side - and a side door, both having grooves for wooden frames. The purpose of this hall is unknown and speculated to be a school or study.&lt;ref name=Gazetteer/&gt;

; Cave 10

Cave 10 is located at a higher level than cave 9 and is difficult to reach as its front is broken. An open veranda with a broken ceiling and floor leads to a middle room through a grooved broken door, which has windows on either side. The right wall of the hall has a recess with a seat. A cell to the left of the room has a seat in a recess. A door from the cell leads to a half-cell which has a recess and seat. Traces of painting are seen on the ceiling. Outside the veranda to the left is a cistern.&lt;ref name=Gazetteer/&gt;

; Cave 11

Cave 11 is difficult to reach with a broken front and a hall. To the left of a hall is a cell, lower in height than the hall. The hall has a grooved doorway and a recess with a seat at the back. Outside the hall is a view seat. The cave bears traces of paint.&lt;ref name=Gazetteer/&gt;

; Cave 12

Cave 12 is a small dwelling entered by a door from the veranda of cave 11. It has its own open veranda, which has a partly broken floor and ceiling and recessed benches on the left and right of the door to the middle room. The middle room has a small window to the left of the door and a seat recess in its right wall. In the back wall of the middle room to the left is a half cell - which has a seat recess - and a cell with a grooved door. The floor of the cave has a coating of cement, while the ceiling of the middle room bears painted concentric circles.&lt;ref name=Gazetteer/&gt;

;Cave 13

Cave 13 on a slightly higher level than cave 12, is a small dwelling with an open court and from 2 steps lead to a veranda. To the right of the court is a cistern. The veranda has a bench along its right wall. The front of the veranda has 2 benches, flanked by a plain eight-sided pillar and pilaster; some remnants of these survive. On the right pilaster is a double crescent ornament. A grooved door leads to a middle room, which has a bench along the right wall and seat recess to the left. A window is to the left of door. In the back wall of the middle room a cell (left) - with a grooved bench and a bench - and a half cell (right) are seen. The ceiling has traces of painting.&lt;ref name=Gazetteer/&gt;

; Cave 15

Cave 15 is a small dwelling consisting of a cell with an unproved doorway and a veranda. Though the side walls of the cave are still preserved, the ceiling is half broken.&lt;ref name=Gazetteer/&gt;

; Cave 16

Cave 16 is a small dwelling, on a slightly higher level above cave 15. It has a cell with a bench along its right wall and a veranda, which leads to the cell through a door. The side walls as well as a part of the ceiling are broken.&lt;ref name=Gazetteer/&gt;

; Cave 17

Cave 17 comprises a series of three small dwellings located along a row with a shared veranda. The first dwelling has a doorway flanked by broken windows on either side, leading to a middle room. The back room of the middle dwelling has a cell to the right and a half cell to the left. A window is located to left of door to the cell. The cell also has traces of painting. The half cell has a bench. The second dwelling has a middle room, a half cell to the left, and a cell, reached from the right of the half cell. The middle room has a bench. The half cell has a recess in its back wall, along with a bench. A grooved door leads from the half-cell to the cell, which also has a bench. A window in the right cell overlooks in to the middle room. In front of the doorway is a bench. The third and largest of the three dwellings consists of a middle hall. At the back wall of the hall there are two cells and two seat recesses. Along the right and rear walls runs a bench. The right cell as well as the left cell have grooved doorways, a window to the left of the doorway and a bench along each of their rear walls. In front of the hall door is a bench. In front of the broken veranda are holes for fixing wooden pillars. To the left of the veranda are two cisterns. Between cave 17 and cave 18, there are three other cisterns. In the recess of the first cistern, an inscription reads translated: "A meritorious gift of a cistern by Saghaka a goldsmith, son of Kudira of Kalyana." Another inscription in the recess of the second cistern reads translated: "A meritorious gift of a cistern by Lachhinika (wife) of Torika the Na daka [and] Nadabalika, wife of Isimulasami."&lt;ref name=Gazetteer/&gt;

; Cave 18
[[File:Lenyadri cave inside.jpg|thumb|300px|Inside of a [[vihara]] in Lenyadri.]]
Cave 18 is a dining hall with a front wall and a grooved doorway, on either side of which are windows. A bench runs along the back and side walls. The passage to the hall has 3 broken steps and an open court in the front. A cistern is located to the left of the court.&lt;ref name=Gazetteer/&gt;

; Cave 19

Cave 19 is a cell without a front wall and a bench runs along the left wall. The ceiling shows signs of a dressed stone or wooden screen from the right wall to the end of the bench. To the right is a small cell in the same roof, probably connected with cave 19. The small cell has a bench along its right wall and the grooved doorway. The cave has two cisterns.&lt;ref name=Gazetteer/&gt;

; Cave 20

Cave 20 is a small dwelling, hard to reach as the front is broken. To the right is a passage and to the left a cell with a bench along the entire left wall.&lt;ref name=Gazetteer/&gt;

; Cave 21

Cave 21 is approached through a small crevice from cave 20, in the absence of any direct approach. Its living space has a veranda of fairly large size. There is also an inner cell with a grooved door frame. Seating benches have been cut into shallow spaces both in the cell and in the veranda.&lt;ref name=Gazetteer/&gt;

;Cave 22

Cave 22 adjoins cave 21 on the left and it was also a dwelling unit with a bench for the entire length of the back wall. A window from this hall overlooks another smaller room. An entry through a grooved door gives access to a long corridor and in the back wall of which is an inscription that discloses the name of the donor and the monastic order.&lt;ref name=Gazetteer/&gt;

;Cave 23

Cave 23 has two dwelling units with a long passage with shallow niches with seating provisions on the left wall. A door provides links to the rooms. A {{convert|2|ft|m}} niche in the back wall between the two rooms gives no clue of its purpose.&lt;ref name=Gazetteer/&gt;

;Cave 24

Cave 24 is a long cave with difficult access that leads into a cistern with seating arrangements in the niches. There is a door access to the passage, which also has benches for seating.&lt;ref name=Gazetteer/&gt;

;Cave 25

Cave 25 is longer than cave 24 with several small and big rooms. These rooms also have seating arrangements in niches which display irregular excavations denoting poor condition of the rock, which probably stopped further work on this cave.&lt;ref name=Gazetteer/&gt;

;Cave 26

This is plain cave located below cave 6, which is a chaitya (chapel) cave.&lt;ref name=Gazetteer/&gt;

==Second group of caves==
[[File:Lenyadri Suleman caves.jpg|right|thumb|The second group of caves, on another spur of the same Lenyadri hill.]]
[[File:Lenyadri Suleman caves stupa.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Stupa inside the Chaitya.]]
On another spur of the same Lenyadri hill ({{Coord|19.246667|73.892222|display=inline}}), there are four more caves (not numbered) that face south-south west and are cut into precipitous hill slopes. Based on their unfinished conditions, they are interpreted as early caves. The details are: a small ''chaitya'' with a relic-shrine and a door, with unfinished irregular rock faces. The entrance is decorated with ornamentation that depict relic-shrine, a lotus flower and  geometrical patterns; another is an inaccessible cave with two rooms, a well, and stone beds in three adjoining rooms with an incomplete relic-shrine in low relief; two other adjoining caves have a chapel and a front veranda.&lt;ref name=Gazetteer/&gt;

===Description===
Passing round the east end of the hill, after a walk of fully a mile, or about four miles from the town, in another spur of the Sulaiman Pahar, is a group of caves in the face of the hill, 400 feet above the level of [[Junnar]], and facing S.S.W. They are usually represented as inaccessible, from the precipice in front of them being almost perpendicular; they are very difficult of access, and dangerous to attempt for any one not accustomed to climbing.&lt;ref name="Fergusson 257"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fergusson|first1=James|last2=Burgess|first2=James|title=The cave temples of India|date=1880|publisher=London : Allen|pages=257-256|url=https://archive.org/stream/cavetemplesofind00ferguoft}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Lenyadri Suleman caves Second group Chaitya.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.5|The small Chaitya cave.]]
The most easterly of them is a small Chaitya-cave only 8 feet 3 inches wide, and 22 feet 4 inches in length, or 15 feet 4 inches from the door to the [[Stupa|dagoba]], which is 4 feet 10 inches in diameter and 9 feet 4 inches high. The walls are not straight, nor the floor level. The side aisles have not been begun, and altogether no part of the interior is quite finished, except the upper part of the dagoba. To the top of the architrave or [[triforium]] is 16 feet, and to the centre of the roof 18 feet 2 inches. Outside, the façade is carved with Chaitya  window ornaments, some enclosing a dagoba, and others a lotus flower; while the rail ornament is abundantly interspersed in the usual way. The fronton round the window is also carved with a geometrical pattern. The details of this cave seem to indicate that it is perhaps as early as those at [[Bedsa Caves|Bedsa]] and [[Karle Caves|Karle]], and consequently it is among the earlier excavations about Junnar.&lt;ref name="Fergusson 257"/&gt; 

Next to it, but higher up and almost inaccessible, are two cells; then a well; and, thirdly, a small [[vihara]], with three cells, two of them with stone-beds. Some rough cutting on the back wall between the cell-doors resembles a dagoba in low relief, but it is quite unfinished. Outside are two more cells and a chamber or chapel at the end of a veranda that runs along in front both of the vihara and the cells.&lt;ref name="Fergusson 257"/&gt;

}}
The '''''Liexian Zhuan''''', sometimes translated as '''''Biographies of Immortals''''', is the oldest [[extant literature|extant]] Chinese [[hagiography]] of [[Taoism|Daoist]] ''[[Xian (Taoism)|xian]]'' "transcendents; immortals; saints; alchemists". The text, which compiles the life stories of about 70 mythological and historical ''xian'', was traditionally attributed to the [[Han dynasty#Western Han|Western Han dynasty]] editor and imperial librarian [[Liu Xiang (scholar)|Liu Xiang]] (77-8 BCE), but internal evidence dates it to the 2nd century CE during the [[Han dynasty#Eastern Han|Eastern Han]] period. The ''Liexian Zhuan'' became a model for later authors, such as [[Ge Hong]]'s 4th century CE ''[[Shenxian zhuan]]'' ("Biographies of Divine Immortals").

==Title==
''Liexian Zhuan'' combines three words:
*''liè'' ([[wikt:列|列]], "rank; array; order; line up; list")
*[[Xian (Taoism)|''xiān'']] ([[wikt:仙|仙]], "transcendent being; celestial being; 'immortal'")
*''zhuàn'' ([[wikt:傳|傳]], " tradition; biography; commentary on a classic (e.g., ''[[Zuozhuan]]'')"(—cf. ''chuàn'' (傳, "transmit; pass along; hand down; spread")

The [[Compound (linguistics)|compound]] ''lièzhuàn'' (列傳, lit. "arrayed lives") is a [[Classical Chinese]] term meaning "[non-imperial] biographies". The ''Liexian Zhuan'' follows the ''liezhuan'' [[biographical]] format of traditional [[Chinese historiography]], which was established by [[Sima Qian]] in his c. 94 BCE [[Records of the Grand Historian|''Shiji'' (''Records of the Grand Historian'')]]. Many later texts adopted the ''liezhuan'' format, for example, the Daoist ''[[Shenxian zhuan]]'' and the Buddhist ''[[Memoirs of Eminent Monks|Gaoseng zhuan]]'' (Memoirs of Eminent Monks) (Campany 1996: 25).

There is no standard translation of ''Liexian Zhuan'', and renderings include:
*''A Gallery of Chinese Immortals'' (Giles 1948)
*''Biographies of the Many Immortals'' (Chan 1963)
*''Biographies of Illustrious Genii'' (Ware 1966)
*''Collections of the Biographies of the Immortals'' (Needham 1986)
*''Immortals' Biographies'' (Kohn 1989)
*''Arrayed Lives of Transcendents'' (Campany 1996)
*''Biographies of the Immortals'' (Eskildsen 1998)
*''Biographies of Exemplary Immortals'' (Penny 2008)
*''Biographies of Immortals'' (Pas 1998, Theobald 2010)
*''Arrayed Traditions of Transcendents'' (Campany 2002)
*''Traditions of Exemplary Transcendents'' (Campany 2009)
*''Biography of the Immortal Deities'' (Yap 2016)
*''Lives of the Immortals'' (Strickmann and Seidel 2017)
The difficulty of translating this title is demonstrated by Campany's three versions. Note the modern shift to translating ''xian'' as "[[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]]" rather than "[[immortality|immortal]]"; Daoist texts describe ''xian'' as having extraordinary "longevity" or "long life" but not eternal "immortality" as understood in Western religions (Bokenkamp 1997: 21-23; Campany 2002: 4-5; Campany 2009: 33-34).

==Liu Xiang== 
The traditional attribution of the ''Liexian Zhuan'' to the [[Western Han]] scholar [[Liu Xiang (scholar)|Liu Xiang]] is regarded as dubious, and modern scholars generally believe it was compiled during the [[Eastern Han]] (25-220 CE) (Penny 2008: 653). There are two kinds of evidence that Liu was not the compiler.

First, the ''Liexian Zhuan'' was not listed in [[Ban Gu]]'s 111 CE ''[[Book of Han]]'' ''[[Yiwenzhi]]'' ("Treatise on Literature") imperial bibliography, and the 636 ''[[Book of Sui]]'' was the first [[Twenty-Four Histories|official dynastic history]] to record it bibliographically. However, the ''Yiwenzhi'' does list many works written and compiled by Liu Xiang, including two with similar titles: ''[[Lienu Zhuan|Lienǚ Zhuan]]'' (列女傳, Biographies of Exemplary Women) and ''Lieshi zhuan'' (列士傳, Biographies of Exemplary [[Scholar-official|Officials]]).

Second, some sections of the ''Liexian Zhuan'' refer to events after Liu Xiang's death in 8 or 6 BCE. Eastern Han historical books dating from the early 2nd century CE cite a version (or versions) of the hagiography. Internal evidence shows that some sections of the text were added in the 2nd century, and later editing occurred (Penny 2008: 653). The hagiography contains some phrases dating from the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]] (265–420), but remains the oldest surviving collection of Taoist hagiography (Theobald 2010).

The attribution of the ''Liexian zhuan'' to Liu Xiang occurred relatively early, and it was accepted by the [[Eastern Jin Dynasty|Eastern Jin]] Daoist scholar [[Ge Hong]] (Penny 2008: 653). Ge's c. 330 ''[[Baopuzi]]'' describes how Liu redacted his ''Liexian Zhuan'' in a context explaining the reason Liu failed to produce an [[Chinese alchemy|alchemical gold elixir]] using the private method of [[Liu An]] was because no teacher had transmitted the necessary oral explanations to him.
&lt;blockquote&gt;As for his compilation (撰) of ''Liexian zhuan'', he revised and extracted (自刪…出) passages from the book by the Qin grandee Ruan Cang 阮倉, and in some cases [added] things he had personally seen (或所親見), and only thus (然後) came to record (記) it. It is not an unwarranted fabrication ([or "fiction"] 非妄言也). (tr. Campany 2002: 104, emending Ware 1966: 51) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Ge Hong uses ''ranhou'' (然後,"only thus") to emphasize that the veracity of ''Liexian Zhuan'' biographies is not tainted by Liu Xiang's failure in ''[[waidan]]'' alchemy, indicating that the collected stories are reliable because he could not have invented them (Campany 2002: 104). Internal evidence suggests that Liu compiled the ''Liexian zhuan'' in the very last years of his life. Although his authorship is disputed and the text is dated later than the 1st century BCE, "recent scholars have argued cogently" for the traditional attribution (Campany 1996: 41). He concludes that the ascription to Liu Xiang is "not wholly incredible, but the text we have today contains later accretions and has also dropped some passages" (Campany 2009: 7).

Since Liu Xiang was an orthodox Confucianist and not a Daoist, his ''Liexian Zhuan'' depiction of transcendents' lives represents knowledge from general Han culture rather than a specific religious community. In subsequent generations, his hagiography became widely known as a source for [[Chinese literature|literary]] [[allusion]] among educated Chinese of later periods (Penny 2008: 653).

From a higher perspective, the question of Liu Xiang's authorship "is irrelevant", because the [[received text]] is not the original. The ''Liexian Zhuan'' was transmitted in diverse manuscript copies for ten centuries, until the [[Song dynasty]] 1019 [[Daozang|Daoist Canon]] incorporated a standard edition (Pas 1998: 55).

==Textual versions==
The ''Liexian Zhuan'' exists in many, sometimes dissimilar, versions. For instance, the original text likely contained 72 hagiographies, yet the standard version has 70, and others have 71. The c. 1029 Daoist encyclopedia ''[[Yunji Qiqian]]'' includes 48 hagiographies (Campany 1996: 41).

Two [[Tang dynasty]] ''[[leishu]]'' [[Chinese encyclopedias]], the 624 ''[[Yiwen Leiju]]'' and 983 ''[[Taiping Yulan]]'' extensively quote from the ''Liexian Zhuan'' (Theobald 2010). Analysis of ''Liexian zhuan'' citations preserved in these and other old sources shows that some portions of the original text have been lost from all surviving versions (Penny 2008: 653).

The earliest extant version of the ''Liexian Zhuan'' is from the [[Ming dynasty]] 1445 ''Zhengtong daozang'' (正統道藏, "Daoist Canon of the [[Emperor Yingzong of Ming|Zhengtong Era]], 1436-1450"). Several other Ming and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] editions of the text were published, including two ''jiàozhèng'' (校正, "corrected; rectified") versions (Campany 1996: 40-41).

''Liexian Zhuan'' is also the title of a different [[Yuan dynasty]] (1206-1368) collection of 55 ''xian'' biographies, including the popular [[Eight Immortals]], with [[Woodblock printing|woodcut]] illustrations (Giles 1948: 11).

==Content==
The present Daoist canonical ''Liexian Zhuan'', which is divided into two chapters, comprises about 70 "tersely worded" hagiographies of transcendents (Campany 2009: 7). In many cases, the ''Liexian Zhuan'' is the only early source referring to an individual transcendent (Pas 1998: 56). The collection does not offer anything resembling a full biography, but only a few informative anecdotes about each person. The briefest entries have fewer than 200 characters (Penny 2008: 653).

Employing the traditional ''liezhuan'' ("arrayed lives") biographical arrangement, the ''Liexian Zhuan'' arranges its Daoist hagiographies in roughly chronological order, starting with the [[Chinese mythology|mythological]] figure [[Yu Shi#As Chisongzi|Chisongzi]] who was Rain Master for the culture hero [[Shennong]] (mythically dated to the 28th century BCE), and ending with the [[Western Han]] herbalist and ''[[fangshi]]'' Xuan Su 玄俗. They include individuals "of every rank and station, ranging from purely mythical beings to hermits, heroes, and men and women of the common people" (Giles 1948: 13). The collection includes mythic personages (e.g., [[Yellow Emperor]] and [[Peng Zu|Pengzu]] who allegedly lived over 800 years), famous Daoists ([[Laozi]] and [[Yinxi]] the Guardian of the Pass), and historical figures ([[Anqi Sheng]] who instructed [[Qin Shi Huang]] (r. 247-220 BCE) and [[Dongfang Shuo]] the [[court jester]] for [[Emperor Wu of Han]] (r. 141–87 BCE)) (Penny 2008: 654).

The standard format for ''Liexian zhuan'' entries is to give the subject's name, sometimes [[Courtesy name|style name]], usually native place (or the formulaic "No one knows where he came from"), and often the period in which he or she supposedly lived. Sometime after the 330s, the text was appended with sets of laudatory ''zàn'' ([[wikt:贊|贊]], "[[encomia]]") that are rhymed hymns praising the recorded ''xian'' (Penny 2008: 653-654). Some editions include an old preface, of uncertain authorship and date, that is not included in the Daoist canonical edition (Campany 1996: 40-41).

Two sample hagiographies illustrate some common themes in the ''Liexian Zhuan''. First, many stories focus on the supernatural techniques of transcendents and how they acquired them (Campany 1996: 41). Mashi Huang ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|馬|師|皇}}}}) was a legendary equine [[veterinarian]] during the [[Yellow Emperor]]'s reign.
&lt;blockquote&gt;...a horse doctor in the time of the Yellow Emperor. He knew the vital symptoms in a horse's constitution, and on receiving his treatment the animal would immediately get well. Once a [[Chinese dragon|dragon]] flew down and approached him with drooping ears and open jaws. Huang said to himself: "This dragon is ill and knows that I can effect a cure." Thereupon he performed [[acupuncture]] on its mouth just below the upper lip, and gave it a decoction of sweet herbs to swallow, which caused it to recover. Afterwards, whenever the dragon was ailing, it issued from its watery lair and presented itself for treatment. One morning the dragon took Huang on its back and bore him away (tr. Giles 1948: 13)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Second, hagiographies often didactically represent ''xian'' using their transcendental powers to support the poor and helpless (Theobald 2010). Chang Rong ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|昌|容}}}}) was able to maintain the appearance of a young woman for two centuries by only eating ''[[Rubus crataegifolius]]'' (Korean raspberry) roots:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Chang Rong was a follower of the Dao from Mount Chang (Changshan 常山; i.e., the [[Mount Heng (Shanxi)|Hengshan]], [[Shanxi]]). She called herself the daughter of the King of Yin (Yinwang nǚ 殷王女) and ate roots of rubus (''penglei'' 蓬虆). She would come and go, ascending and descending. People saw her for some two hundred years yet she always looked about twenty. When she was able to get purple grass she sold it to dyers and gave the proceeds to widows and orphans. It was like this for generations. Thousands came to make offerings at her shrine. (tr. Penny 2008: 654) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Researchers have found evidence of anti-inflammatory effects from ''R. crataegifolius'' root extracts (Cao et al. 1996).

Third, like the above "decoction of sweet herbs" and "roots of rubus", about half the transcendents described in the ''Liexian Zhuan'' had powers that ultimately came from drugs. For instance, after Master Redpine took a drug called ''shuiyu'' (水玉, "liquid jade") denoting quartz crystals in solution (Campany 2002: 230), he transformed himself by fire, and ascended to [[Kunlun (mythology)|Mount Kunlun]] where he lived with the [[Queen Mother of the West]]. The text mentions many herbal and mineral drugs, including [[pine nuts]], [[pine resin]], [[Smilax china|China root]], [[lingzhi mushroom|fungus]], [[Angelica sinensis|Chinese angelica]], [[cinnabar]] powder, and [[mica]] (Kohn 1989: 76).

==Translations==
There are no full English translations of the text analogous to the [[French language|French]] critical edition and annotated translation ''Le Lie-sien tchouan'' by [[Maxime Kaltenmark|Kaltenmark]] (1953) (Penny 2008: 654). [[Lionel Giles|Giles]] translated eight ''Liexian Zhuan'' entries (1948), and Campany's annotated translation of the ''Shenxian Zhuan'' (2002) frequently cites the ''Liexian Zhuan''.

'''Tosafists''' were [[medieval]] [[rabbi]]s from France and Germany who are among those known in Talmudical scholarship as [[Rishonim]] (there were Rishonim in Spain also) who created critical and explanatory [[gloss (annotation)|gloss]]es (questions, notes, interpretations, rulings and sources) on the [[Talmud]]. These were collectively called [[Tosafot]] ("additions"), because they were additions on the commentary of [[Rashi]]. The ''Tosafists'' lived from the 12th century to the middle of the 15th century and the Tosafot are a compilation of the questions, answers and opinions of those rabbis. The Tosafot are very important to the practical application of Jewish law because the law will differ depending on how the Talmud is understood and interpreted.

Each generation of the ''Tosafists'' would add to those compilations and therefore there are many different versions of the ''Tosafos''. In addition each compilation of the ''Tosafos'' did not contain everything that was said by the ''Tosafists'' on the subject so compilations will differ in what they say. For this reason some things that were said by the ''Tosafists'' will be found only in obscure versions of the ''Tosafos''.

The final version of these commentaries was published on the outer side of the Soncino edition of the Talmud, printed in [[Soncino, Lombardy|Soncino]], Italy (16th century), and was the first printed edition of the full Talmud. The publisher of that edition was a nephew of Rabbi Moshe of Spires (Shapiro) who was of the last generation of ''Tosafists'' and who initiated a project of writing a final compilation of the ''Tosafos''. Before he published his Talmud he traveled throughout France to the schools where the ''Tosafists'' learned and gathered all of the different manuscripts of that final version of the ''Tosafos'' and printed them in his Talmud. Since then every publication of the Talmud was printed with the ''Tosafos'' on the outer side of the page (the inner side has the commentary of Rashi) and is an integral part of the study of the Talmud.

During the period of the ''Tosafists'' the church enacted a law that prohibited possession of the Talmud under pain of death and [[Disputation of Paris#Outcome|24 wagon loads of scrolls of the Talmud were gathered from all of France and burned in the center of Paris]]. The intention of the church was that the study of the Talmud should be forgotten and once forgotten it would remain forgotten for all generations since there would be nobody to teach it. As a result, the ''Tosafists'' devised a system where they could study the Talmud without the existence of a text despite the vastness of the Talmud. They appointed scholars, each to be expert in one the volumes of the Talmud, to know it by heart and very well, and so through these scholars they would have expertise and knowledge in all of the Talmud. As they would study a particular text in one volume of the Talmud those scholars who were expert in different volumes of the Talmud would tell of anything in the volume of the Talmud that they were expert on that would contradict their understanding of the text at hand. Thus an important aspect of the scholarship of the ''Tosafists'' is to use texts in different areas of the Talmud to disprove certain interpretations of the Talmud (often those of Rashi) and to determine the correct way to understand the Talmud.

==Alphabetical list of Tosafists==

Of the great number of tosafists only forty-four are known by name. The following is an alphabetical list of them; many, however, are known only through citations.

===[[A (HaRA)]]===
Quoted in the edited Tosafot to Tractate Kesubos 14b, 19a, 20b, 21a et seq.

===[[Abigdor ben Elijah ha-Kohen]]===
Flourished in the middle of the thirteenth century; his tosafot are mentioned in the edited tosafot to Ket. 63b.

===[[Asher ben Jehiel]] (RoSH)===
His tosafot, entitled ''Tosefot ha-Rosh'' or ''Tosefe Tosafot,'' appeared in various epochs and works. Many of them were inserted by [[Bezalel Ashkenazi]] in his ''Shiṭṭah Meḳubbeẓet''; those to [[Yebamot]] and [[Ketubot]] appeared separately at [[Livorno]], 1776; to [[Sotah]], partly at Prague, 1725, and partly in [[Jacob Faitusi]]'s ''Mar'eh ha-Ofannim'' (1810); to [[Megillah (Talmud)|Megillah_]] and [[Shevuot]], in [[Elijah Borgel]]'s ''Migdanot Natan'' (1785); and to [[Nashim|Kiddushin]], in the ''Ma'aseh Roḳem'' (Pisa, 1806). They are included in [[Vilna Edition Shas|the Vilna Romm]] edition of the Talmud.

=== [[Baruch ben Isaac]] ===
(see above and Jewish Encyclopedia ii. 559).

===[[Eleazar of Worms|Eleazar ben Judah of Worms]]===
Author of tosafot to Baba Ḳamma, extracts from which are found in [[Bezalel Ashkenazi]]'s ''Shiṭṭah Meḳubbeẓet.''

===[[Elhanan b. Isaac]]===
Flourished at the end of the twelfth century; his tosafot are mentioned by Abraham b. David in his "Temim De'im" and in the edited tosafot to B. M. 11b and Sheb. 28a. His tosafot to Nedarim are referred to by Joseph Colon (Responsa, No. 52); those to Megillah, in Isaiah di Trani's "Ha-Makria'" (No. 31, p.&amp;nbsp;19d); those to 'Abodah Zarah, in "Mordekai" (No. 1364).

===[[Eliezer b. Joel ha-Levi]]===
Flourished in the beginning of the thirteenth century; author of tosafot to several treatises (comp. Michael, "Or ha-Ḥayyim," No. 427).

===[[Eliezer b. Nathan]]===
Wrote about the Persecution of 1096.

===[[Eliezer ben Samuel of Metz]] (Re'EM)===
Author of tosafot to several treatises, of which those to Ḥullin were seen by Azulai.

===[[Eliezer of Toul]]===
French tosafist of the beginning of the thirteenth century, whose tosafot are mentioned by Zedekiah Anaw in his "Shibbole ha-Leḳeṭ."

===[[Eliezer of Touques]]===
(see above and Jewish Encyclopedia v. 120).

===[[Elijah ben Menahem]]===
His tosafot are mentioned in "Haggahot Maimuniyyot," Ḳinnim, No. 20.

===I===
(RI, probably R. Isaac, but not to be confused with Isaac b. Samuel ha-Zaḳen, who occurs most often as RI) His tosafot, in which the older RI is quoted, are mentioned by Samson b. Zadok ("Tashbeẓ," § 336).

===[[Isaac ben Abraham of Dampierre]]===
Brother of [[Samson ben Abraham of Sens]]. Succeeded his teacher [[Isaac ben Samuel ha-Zaḳen]] as head of the school of Dampierre, and as a result is also known as Rabbi Isaac ha-Baḥur, or RIBA ("Rabbi Isaac the Younger").

=== [[Isaac b. Asher ha-Levi]] ===
(see above and Jewish Encyclopedia vi. 620).

===[[Isaac ben Jacob ha-Laban]]===
Pupil of Rabbeinu Tam and one of the earlier tosafists ("ba'ale tosafot yeshanim"). He was the author of a commentary on Ketubot quoted by Isaac Or Zarua' (see Judah Minz, Responsa, No. 10). He is quoted very often in the edited tosafot (Yeb. 5b; B. Ḳ. 72a; et al.).

===[[Isaac ben Meïr]] ([[Rivam]]) of Ramerupt===
Grandson of Rashi, and brother of Samuel b. Meïr (RaSHBaM) and Jacob Tam; died before his father, leaving four children (Jacob Tam, "Sefer ha-Yashar," No. 616, p.&amp;nbsp;72b, Vienna, 1811). Although he died young, Isaac wrote tosafot, mentioned by Eliezer b. Joel ha-Levi ("Abi ha-'Ezri," § 417), to several treatises of the Talmud. Isaac himself is often quoted in the edited tosafot (Shab. 138a; Ket. 29b et passim).

===[[Isaac ben Mordecai of Regensburg]] (RIBaM)===
Flourished in the twelfth century; pupil of Isaac b. Asher ha-Levi. He corresponded with Jacob Tam and was a fellow pupil of Moses b. Joel and Ephraim b. Isaac. His tosafot are quoted by Eliezer b. Joel ha-Levi (l.c. § 420) and Meïr of Rothenburg ("Semaḥot," § 73; "Haggahot Maimuniyyot," Abelot, p.&amp;nbsp;294a). He is often quoted also in the edited tosafot (Ket. 55a; B. Ḳ. 22b et passim).

===[[Isaac ben Reuben]]===
His tosafot are mentioned in the "Shiṭṭah Meḳubbeẓet," Ketubot, 43a. He may be identical with the Isaac b. Reuben who made a comment on Rashi to B. Ḳ. 32d.

===[[Isaac ben Samuel ha-Zaḳen]]===
also known as the Ri ha-Zaken, a French tosafist and Biblical commentator who flourished in the twelfth century.

===[[Isaiah di Trani]] (RID)===
Italian tosafist of the first half of the thirteenth century. The greater part of his tosafot were published under the title "Tosefot R. Yesha'yahu" (Lemberg, 1861–69); and many were inserted by Bezaleel Ashkenazi in his "Shiṭṭah Meḳubbeẓet."

===[[Israel of Bamberg]]===
Lived in the middle of the thirteenth century; mentioned as an author of tosafot in "Mordekai" (to 'Ab. Zarah, Nos. 1244, 1279, 1295, 1356) and "Haggahot Mordekai" (to Shab. xiv.). Extracts from the tosafot of Israel's pupils were reproduced by Bezaleel Ashkenazi (l.c.).

===[[J. Cohen]]===
Supposedly a contemporary of Meïr b. Baruch of Rothenburg, and perhaps identical with Judah ha-Kohen, Meïr's relative. In the extracts from his tosafot to Baba Ḳamma, inserted in the "Shiṭṭah Meḳubbeẓet," he quotes, among many other authorities, his still living teacher, the Kohen whom Zunz ("Z. G." p.&amp;nbsp;42) supposes to be identical with Abigdor b. Elijah ha-Kohen. From the "Shiṭṭah Meḳubbeẓet" to Baba Meẓi'a it is seen that J. Cohen wrote tosafot to the same treatise.

===[[Jacob of Chinon]]===
Lived in the thirteenth century; pupil of Isaac ben Abraham, author of a "Shiṭṭah" ("Mordekai," on Sanh., No. 928). He himself is quoted in the edited tosafot (Ber. 12a; Nazir 53a; et al.).

===[[Jacob ben Isaac ha-Levi]] (Jabez)===
Flourished at Speyer about 1130; a pupil of Kalonymus b. Isaac the Elder (Eliezer b. Nathan, "Eben ha-'Ezer," p.&amp;nbsp;13c, Prague, 1610). He was the author of tosafot ("Haggahot Maimuniyyot," Ḳinnim, No. 16) and of decisions ("pesaḳim"; "Mordekai," Ḥul., No. 1183). He is quoted also in the edited tosafot (to Ḳin. 23a).

=== [[Rabbeinu Tam|Jacob ben Meïr, Rabbeinu Tam]] ===
(see above and Jewish Encyclopedia vii. 36).

===[[Jehiel ben Joseph of Paris]] (d. 1286)===
His tosafot are quoted as authoritative by [[Perez ben Elijah]] (glosses to "'Ammude Golah," p.&amp;nbsp;50a, Cremona, 1556), in "Kol Bo" (No. 114), and in "Mordekai" (Ḥul., No. 924). He is frequently quoted also in the edited tosafot.

===Joseph (or Yehosef)===
Flourished, according to Zunz ("Z. G." p.&amp;nbsp;33), about 1150. Zunz identifies this Joseph with the pupil of Samuel b. Meïr whose glosses are quoted in the edited tosafot (to Ket. 70a), and thinks he may be identical with the Joseph of Orleans often cited in the edited tosafot (Shab. 12a et passim). If so, he must be identified, according to [[Henri Gross]] (''Gallia Judaica'', p.&amp;nbsp;34), with Joseph ben Isaac Bekor Shor. Weiss, however, suggests that this Joseph might have been either [[Joseph Bonfils]], Jacob Tam's teacher, or Joseph b. Isaac of Troyes, one of Rashi's pupils. Thus it seems that in any case the tosafist mentioned in the "Sefer ha-Yashar" must be distinguished from the one mentioned in Tos. Ket. 70a, as the latter was a pupil of R. Samuel.

===Joseph Porat===
Many fragments of his tosafot to Shabbat are included in the edited tosafot.

=== [[Judah b. Isaac of Paris]] ===
(see above and Jewish Encyclopedia vii. 344).

===[[Judah ben Nathan]] (RIVaN)===
Son-in-law and pupil of Rashi, and to a great extent his continuator. It was Judah who completed Rashi's commentary on Makkot (from 19b to the end) and who wrote the commentary on Nazir which is erroneously attributed to Rashi. He wrote, besides, independent commentaries on 'Erubin, Shabbat, Yebamot (Eliezer b. Joel ha-Levi, "Abi ha-'Ezri," §§ 183, 385, 397, 408), and Pesaḥim ("Semag," prohibition No. 79). Finally, Halberstam manuscript No. 323 contains a fragment of Judah's commentary on Nedarim. It is generally considered that Judah b. Nathan wrote tosafot to several treatises of the Talmud, and he is mentioned as a tosafist in "Haggahot Mordekai" (Sanh., No. 696). He is often quoted in the edited tosafot.

===Levi===
His tosafot are quoted in the "Mordekai" (B. M. iv., end).

=== [[Meir of Rothenburg|Meir ben Baruch of Rothenburg, MaHaRaM]] ===
See above and Jew. Encyc. viii. 437.

===[[Meïr ben Samuel]] of Ramerupt===
His tosafot are mentioned by his son Jacob Tam ("Sefer ha-Yashar," No. 252) and often in the edited tosafot.

===[[Moses ben Jacob of Coucy]]===
Author of Old Tosafot to Yoma and of some published in the collection "Sugyot ha-Shas" (Berlin, 1736).

===Moses b. Meïr of Ferrara===
Flourished in the thirteenth century; probably a pupil of Judah b. Isaac of Paris. His tosafot were used by the compiler of the "Haggahot Maimuniyyot" (see Jew. Encyc. ix. 86).

=== [[Moses of Évreux]] ===
(see above and Jewish Encyclopedia ix. 65).

=== [[Moses Taku]] ===
13th Century Tosafist from Bohemia.

=== [[Perez ben Elijah]] of Corbeil ===
(see above and Jewish Encyclopedia ix. 600).

===HaRebbi R' Menachem===
Mentioned in [[Baba Kama]] 2b s.v. "umilta," as well as by [[Hagahot Maimoniyot]] to [[Rambam]]'s laws of [[chametz]] and [[matzah]], chapter 6, note 9.

=== [[Samson ben Abraham of Sens]] ===
(see above and Jewish. Encyclopedia xi. 2).

===Samson b. Isaac of Chinon===
Flourished in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries; author of the "Sefer Keritut." In this work (i. 7, § 1; v. 3, §§ 120, 148) Samson refers to his glosses on 'Erubin and 'Abodah Zarah; he appears to have written glosses on other Talmudic treatises also.

===[[Samuel of Évreux]]===
Author of tosafot to several treatises; those to Soṭah are among the edited tosafot (see Jew. Encyc. xi. 16).

===[[Samuel ben Meïr]] (RaSHBaM)===
Author of tosafot to Alfasi; under his supervision his pupils prepared tosafot to several treatises ("Sefer ha-Yashar," p.&amp;nbsp;85d).

===Samuel b. Naṭronai (RaShBaṬ)===
German Talmudist of the end of the twelfth century; authorof tosafot to 'Abodah Zarah (see "Kerem Ḥemed," vii. 50).

=== [[Samuel ben Solomon of Falaise]] ===
(see above and Jewish Encyclopedia xi. 28).

===[[Simḥah ben Samuel of Speyer]]===
Flourished in the thirteenth century; his tosafot are mentioned by Meïr of Rothenburg (Responsa, iv., No. 154).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6483">'''Mumboism''', also known as the '''Mumbo cult''', was a [[new religious movement]] founded by Onyango Dunde in the early 20th century. Followers of the religion, known as Mumboites, were most active in the [[Nyanza Province|Nyanza]] region of [[Kenya]] near [[Lake Victoria]]. The movement had anti-imperial teachings and was suppressed by the colonial government of Kenya.

==Origins==

Mumboism began during the British colonial era in Kenya, when Christian missionaries were active in the region. In 1913, Onyango Dunde began to preach that he had been swallowed by a serpent in Lake Victoria. The serpent spit him out, and gave him a prophecy that he would spread to his followers:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I am the God Mumbo whose two homes are in the sun and in the lake. I have chosen you to be my mouthpiece. Go and tell all the Africans.... that from henceforth I am their God. Those whom I choose personally and those who acknowledge me, will live forever in plenty.... the Christian religion is rotten.... All Europeans are your enemies, but the time is shortly coming when they will all disappear from the country."&lt;ref name="Pickens"&gt;George F. Pickens, ''African Christian God-Talk: Matthew Ajuoga's Johera Narrative.'' University Press of America, 2004; pp. 133-134. Quoted in Oeching (1992, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==

In keeping with the prophecy, Dunde condemned European culture, Christianity, and the influence of colonialism. He also prophesied a golden age that would arrive with the end of the European presence in the region. Mumboism was popular among the Luo and [[Kisii people]], but its influence spread beyond Africans who were formally followers of Dunde.&lt;ref name="Pickens"/&gt;

Mumboism's teachings have been characterized as a strain of [[millennialism]], anticipating a golden age, perhaps influenced by Christian teachings of a cataclysmic end to the current world's existence. Some teachings were that "water would turn into blood, and only Mumboites would have drinking water, all white people would disappear leaving only Africans as sole survivors, or the Germans would come and cut off the arms of those in clothes (i.e., Europeans and Westernized Africans). [...] The projected utopia would be a time of role reversal, healing, and plenty that could only be effected by traditional sacrifices and rituals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wessinger|first=Catherine|title=The Oxford Handbook of Millennialism|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195301052|pages=389–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years following the end of World War I, many of the [[Kisii people|Kisii]] (AbaGusii) became followers of Mumboism in growing numbers. Some factors contributing to this were frustration with the colonial government due to deteriorating agricultural, trade and health conditions among the [[Kisii people]], fluctuating currency value, and the colonial administration's increasingly burdensome demands concerning taxation, labour owed to the colonial government, and requirements for registration.&lt;ref name="Maxon"&gt;{{cite book|last=Maxon|first=Robert M.|title=Conflict and Accommodation in Western Kenya: The Gusii and the British, 1907-1963|year=1989|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press|isbn=9780838633502|pages=74–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The golden age prophecy of an end to European government appealed to the Kisii, who had openly revolted against the colonial administration in 1905, 1908 and 1914, only to be defeated by the Europeans. Its appeal among the Kisii people was small during times of prosperity, when meeting the colonial administration's demands was easier. During times of economic hardship, its religious and political appeal grew among the Kisii.&lt;ref name="Maxon"/&gt;

The Bogonko clan, the wealthiest and most influential among the Kisii, were adherents of Mumboism. Their position had been undermined by the European presence, and they were leaders of Mumboism particularly among the Kitutu subclan.&lt;ref&gt;Godwin R. Murunga and W. Nasong'o Shadrack, ''Kenya: The Struggle for Democracy.'' Zed Books, 2007; pg. 64. {{ISBN|9781842778579}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suppression===

The colonial administration was threatened by the anti-European message of Mumboism. The colonial government ultimately banned Mumboism in 1954. Much earlier in 1921, it had exiled Dunde and other Mumbo leaders to the holy Islamic island of [[Lamu]] in the [[Indian Ocean]].&lt;ref name="Pickens"/&gt; A 1919 government report had listed important leaders of the movement, some of whom were openly opposed to the colonial government: Mosi Auma of Kabondo, Nyakundi of Kitutu, Omwenga of Wanjare.&lt;ref name="Maxon"/&gt;

The colonial administration had a tendency to conflate Mumboism with other indigenous religious beliefs, such as the cult around the late prophet [[Sakawa]] (Zakawa), who it was said had prophesied European rule, the building of the railroad and the site of Kisii. Mumboism was not the sole religious movement in Central or Eastern Africa to reflect anti-European sentiment. The [[Kamba people]] around [[Machakos]], Kenya, had a millennial cult that developed in the interwar years around the prophet [[Ndonye wa Kauti]], which had parallels with Mumboism.&lt;ref name="Maxon"/&gt;

[[Dini ya Msambwa]] or Nsambwa (DYM), "religion of the ancestral spirits", was another rejection of Christianity that developed during the early 20th century in Kenya. It was founded by [[Elijah Masinde]], among the [[Masaba people|Babukusu]].&lt;ref&gt;Murunga and Shadrack, ''Kenya,''  pp. 64-65.&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet another new religious movement was the [[Karing'a]] movement, influenced by [[Agikuyu]] religious ideal concepts similar to democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Murunga and Shadrack, ''Kenya,'' pg. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nathan Gregory Silvermaster''' (November 27, 1898 – October 7, 1964), an [[economist]] with the [[United States]] [[War Production Board]] (WPB) during [[World War II]], was the head of a large ring of [[Communist]] [[espionage|spies]] in the U.S. government.&lt;ref&gt;Herken 2002, pg. 88&lt;/ref&gt; It is from him that the [[FBI Silvermaster File]]

==Background==

Silvermaster was born to a Jewish family in [[Odessa]], [[Imperial Russia|Russia]] (present-day [[Odessa, Ukraine]]) in 1898. He moved with his family to [[China]], where he learned to speak perfect English with a British accent. He emigrated to the United States and earned his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] from the [[University of Washington]] in [[Seattle]] (where he was "stated to be a known Communist") and a [[Ph.D.]] from the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where his thesis was entitled ''Lenin's Economic Thought Prior to the October Revolution''. He became a [[Naturalization|naturalized]] [[United States|American]] citizen in 1926. He was reported to be in contact with a very large number of [[Communist Party USA]] officials, and was active in a number of Communist [[Front organization|front groups]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ultra-secret.info/PDFs/NKVD.pdf FBI Report]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, op. cit.,  pgs. 21-23 (PDF pgs. 26-28)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Civil service===

From August 1935 to November 1938, Silvermaster worked in the [[Farm Security Administration]].  From November 1938 to July 1940, he worked on the  [[Maritime Labor Board]].  From July 1940 to December 1944, he worked in the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]].

While nominally remaining on the employment rolls of the [[Farm Security Administration]], Silvermaster arranged in 1942 to be detailed to the [[Board of Economic Warfare]]. The transfer, however, triggered objections from military counter-intelligence who suspected he was a hidden [[Communist]] and regarded him as a security risk. On July 16, 1942 the U.S. Civil Service Commission recommended ''"Cancel eligibilities ... and bar him for the duration of the [[World War II|National Emergency]]."'' {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Silvermaster denied any Communist links and appealed to Under Secretary of War [[Robert P. Patterson|Robert Patterson]] to overrule the security officials. Both White House advisor [[Lauchlin Currie]] (identified in [[Venona]] as the Soviet agent operating under the cover name "Page"&lt;ref name="Hanyok00043"&gt;Robert J. Hanyok,

Silvermaster subsequently received two promotions and pay raises.

From 1942 to 1945, he was also assigned to the [[United States Treasury]].  In mid-1945, he joined the [[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]] (later [[War Assets Corporation]]).  In March 1946, he resigned from government.

On August 28, 1950, [[Lee Pressman]] (a member of the [[Ware group|Ware Group]], a precursor to the Silvermaster and [[Perlo group|Perlo]]) said of Silvermaster, "I believe he was with the Maritime Labor Board when I was with the CIO, and in that connection I may have had some business dealings with him" (apparently referring to Silvermasters time with that union 1938–1940).&lt;ref name=huac1950&gt;

===Espionage: Silvermaster Group===

Kathryn S. Olmsted, the author of ''Red Spy Queen'' (2002), points out: "Every two weeks, Elizabeth would travel to Washington to pick up documents from the Silvermasters, collect their Party dues, and deliver Communist literature. Soon the flow of documents grew so large that Ullmann, an amateur photographer, set up a darkroom in their basement. Elizabeth usually collected at least two or three rolls of microfilmed secret documents, and one time received as many as forty. She would stuff all the film and documents into a knitting bag or other innocent feminine accessory, then take it back to New York on the train." &lt;ref&gt;Kathryn S. Olmsted, Red Spy Queen (2002) page 46&lt;/ref&gt; Moscow complained that around half of the photographed documents received in the summer of 1944 were unreadable and suggested that Ullmann receive more training. However, Pavel Fitin, who was responsible for analyzing the material, described it as very important data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://spartacus-educational.com/Nathan_Silvermaster.htm |title={title} |access-date=2014-07-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727044404/http://spartacus-educational.com/Nathan_Silvermaster.htm |archive-date=2014-07-27 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[War Production Board]], Silvermaster was able to provide the Soviet Union with a large amount of data on arms, aircraft, and shipping production. In June 1943, Silvermaster sent a War Production Board report on arms production in the United States, including bombers, pursuit planes, tanks, propelled guns, howitzers, radar and submarines, sub chasers, and the like, to Soviet intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nsa.gov/venona/releases/29-30_Jun_1943_p1.gif |title=1017 KGB New York to Moscow, June 29/30, 1943 |access-date=2007-07-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227074843/http://www.nsa.gov/venona/releases/29-30_Jun_1943_p1.gif |archive-date=2008-02-27 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in December 1944, the New York [[MGB (USSR)|MGB]]&lt;ref&gt;FBI Memorandum L.V. Boardman to A.H. Belmont, [[s:FBI Synopsis on "Operations of the MGB Residency at New York, 1944-45"|''FBI Operations of the MGB Residency at New York, 1944-45'']], November 26, 1957&lt;/ref&gt; office cabled another Silvermaster report stating: "(Silvermaster) has sent us a 50-page Top Secret War Production Board report ... on arms production in the U.S."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nsa.gov/venona/releases/26_Dec_1944_R3_m2_p1.gif |title=1821 KGB New York to Moscow, December 26, 1944 |access-date=2007-07-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227074848/http://www.nsa.gov/venona/releases/26_Dec_1944_R3_m2_p1.gif |archive-date=2008-02-27 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944, Silvermaster was associated with [[Harry Dexter White]] at the [[United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference|Bretton Woods conference]], and his testimony before the US [[Senate Internal Security Subcommittee]] covers "175 pages of interrogation and exhibits" regarding his espionage activities in the U.S. {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

The Silvermaster spy ring operated primarily in the Department of the Treasury but also had contacts in the [[United States Army Air Forces|Army Air Force]] and in the [[White House]]. Sixty-one of the Venona cables concern the activities of the Silvermaster spy ring.  This represents 1% of the total (approx 6,000 cables) and 3% of the (2,000) translated/partially translated VENONA cables.

'''Padre Pio''', also known as '''Saint Pio of Pietrelcina''' ({{lang-it|Pio da Pietrelcina}}), [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|O.F.M. Cap.]] (May 25, 1887{{spaced ndash}}September 23, 1968), was a [[friar]], [[priest]], [[stigmatist]], and [[Christian mysticism|mystic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/saints/pio.shtml|title=BBC - Religions - Christianity: Saint Pio of Pietrelcina|access-date=2017-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; now venerated as a [[saint]] of the [[Catholic church]]. Born '''Francesco Forgione''', he was given the name of Pius ({{lang-it|Pio}}) when he joined the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin]].

Padre Pio became famous for exhibiting [[stigmata]] for most of his life, thereby generating much interest and controversy. He was both [[beatification|beatified]] (1999) and [[canonization|canonized]] (2002) by [[Pope John Paul II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/saints/ns_lit_doc_20020616_padre-pio_en.html|title="Padre Pio de Pietrelcina",- PADRE PIO DA PIETRELCINA|publisher= Vatican News Service|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He stated that by the time he was five years old, he had already made the decision to dedicate his entire life to God.&lt;ref name="Ruffin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ewtn1"/&gt; He worked on the land up to the age of 10, looking after the small flock of sheep the family owned. 

Pietrelcina was a town where feast days of saints were celebrated throughout the year, and the Forgione family was deeply religious. They attended [[Holy Mass|Mass]] daily, prayed the [[Rosary]] nightly, and abstained from meat three days a week in honor of [[Our Lady of Mount Carmel]].&lt;ref name="ewtn1"/&gt; Although Francesco's parents and grandparents were illiterate, they narrated Bible stories to their children. His mother said that Francesco was able to see and speak with [[Jesus]], the [[Virgin Mary]], and his [[guardian angel]], and that as a child he assumed that all people could do so.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

According to the diary of Father Agostino da San Marco, who was his spiritual director in [[San Marco in Lamis]], the young Francesco Forgione was afflicted with a number of illnesses. At six he suffered from severe gastroenteritis. At ten he caught [[typhoid fever]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

[[File:KOS O PIO.jpg|thumb|left|The conventual cell of Padre Pio]]
As a youth, Francesco reported that he had experienced heavenly [[Vision (spirituality)|vision]]s and [[Religious ecstasy|ecstasies]].&lt;ref name="Ruffin"/&gt; In 1897, after he had completed three years at the public school, Francesco was said to have been drawn to the life of a friar after listening to a young Capuchin friar who was in the countryside seeking donations. When Francesco expressed his desire to his parents, they made a trip to [[Morcone]], a community {{convert|13|mi|km}} north of Pietrelcina, to find out if their son was eligible to enter the Capuchin Order. The friars there informed them that they were interested in accepting Francesco into their community, but he needed to be better educated.&lt;ref name="ewtn1"/&gt;

Francesco's father went to the [[United States]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.americancatholic.org/Features/Saints/saint.aspx?id=1147|title=Saints|publisher=The American Catholic|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in search of work to pay for private tutoring for his son, to meet the academic requirements to enter the Capuchin Order.&lt;ref name="Ruffin"/&gt; It was in this period that Francesco received the [[sacrament]] of [[Confirmation]] on September 27, 1899. He underwent private tutoring and passed the stipulated academic requirements. On January 6, 1903, at the age of 15, he entered the [[novitiate]] of the Capuchin friars at Morcone. On January 22, he took the [[Franciscan]] [[religious habit|habit]] and the name of '''Fra ([[Friar]]) Pio''', in honor of [[Pope Pius I|Pope St. Pius I]], whose [[relic]] is preserved in the Santa Anna Chapel in Pietrelcina.&lt;ref name="ewtn1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=santanna&gt;{{cite web|last1=Convento Pietralcina|title=La chiesetta di Sant'Anna|url=http://www.cappuccinipietrelcina.com/la-chiesetta-di-santanna/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140805154534/http://www.cappuccinipietrelcina.com/la-chiesetta-di-santanna/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=5 August 2014|website=cappuccinipietrelcina.com|accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took the [[simple vow]]s of [[poverty, chastity and obedience]].&lt;ref name="Ruffin"/&gt;

==Priesthood==
[[File:PIC 023.jpg|thumb|right|The church-shrine in [[San Giovanni Rotondo]], Padre Pio's own church]]

[[File:Chiesa di Santa Maria delle Grazie, interno (San Giovanni Rotondo).JPG|thumb|right|Interior of Padre Pio's church in [[San Giovanni Rotondo]], [[Italy]]]]

Commencing his seven-year study for the priesthood, Fra Pio travelled to the friary of Saint Francis of Assisi by oxcart.&lt;ref name="ewtn1"/&gt; At 17, he suddenly fell ill, complaining of loss of appetite, insomnia, exhaustion, fainting spells, and terrible [[migraines]]. He vomited frequently and could digest only milk and cheese. Religious devotees and hagiographers point to this  time, when he was suffering physical illness, that inexplicable phenomena allegedly began to occur. During prayers, Pio appeared to others to be in a stupor, as if he were absent. One of Pio's fellow friars later claimed to have seen him in [[religious ecstasy|
ecstasy]], [[Levitation (paranormal)|levitating]] above the ground.&lt;ref&gt;Renzo Allegri, ''I miracoli di Padre Pio'' p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1905, Fra Pio's health worsened to such an extent that his superiors decided to send him to a mountain convent, in the hope that the change of air would do him some good. This had little impact, however, and doctors advised that he return to his home town. Even there his health failed to improve. Despite this, On January 27, 1907, he still made his solemn [[Profession (religious)|profession]].

In 1910, Pio was subsequently  [[ordination|ordained]] a priest by [[Archbishop]] [[Paolo Schinosi]] at the Cathedral of [[Benevento]]. Four days later, he offered his first Mass at the parish church of [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Our Lady of the Angels]]. His health being precarious, he was permitted to remain with his family until 1916 while still retaining the Capuchin habit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/saints/ns_lit_doc_20020616_padre-pio_en.html "Padre Pio da Pietrelcina", Vatican News Service]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On September 4, 1916, however, Pio was ordered to return to his community life. He moved to an agricultural community, [[Our Lady of Grace]] Capuchin [[Monastery|Friary]], located in the Gargano Mountains in [[San Giovanni Rotondo]] in the [[Province of Foggia]]. At that time the community numbered in total seven friars. He went on to remain at San Giovanni Rotondo until his death in 1968, except for a period of military service. Padre Pio celebrated the Mass in Latin, as was the widespread custom of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.messainlatino.it/2009/03/padre-pio-e-escriva-de-balaguer.html|title=Padre Pio e Escrivà de Balaguer refrattari al Novus Ordo?

Fr| date=September 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military service==
When [[World War I]] started, four friars from this community were selected for military service. At that time, Padre Pio was a teacher at the seminary and a spiritual director. When one more friar was called into service, Padre Pio was put in charge of the community. On November 15, 1915, he was drafted into the Italian army and on December 6, assigned to the 10th Medical Corps in Naples. Due to poor health, he was continually discharged and recalled until on March 16, 1918, he was declared unfit for military service and discharged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.padrepiodevotions.org/chronology.asp|title=Chronology|website=Padre Pio Devotions}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all, his military service lasted 182 days.&lt;ref name="ewtn2"/&gt;

==Stigmata==
On September 20, 1918, while hearing confessions, Padre Pio had his first occurrence of the stigmata: bodily marks, pain, and bleeding in locations corresponding to the [[crucifixion]] wounds of [[Jesus Christ]]. This phenomenon continued for fifty years, until the end of his life. The blood flowing from the stigmata purportedly smelled of perfume or flowers, a phenomenon mentioned in stories of the lives of several [[saint]]s and often referred to as the ''[[odour of sanctity]]''. Though Padre Pio said he would have preferred to suffer in secret, by early 1919, news about the stigmatic friar began to spread in the secular world. Padre Pio’s wounds are said to have been examined by many people, including physicians.&lt;ref name = "gerhold"/&gt;

[[File:Padre-Pio-young.jpg|thumb|left|Padre Pio showing the [[stigmata]]]]
People who had started rebuilding their lives after World War I, began to see in Padre Pio a symbol of hope.&lt;ref name="ewtn2"/&gt; Those close to him attest that he began to manifest several spiritual gifts, including the gifts of healing, [[bilocation]], levitation, [[prophecy]], [[miracle]]s, extraordinary abstinence from both sleep and nourishment (one account states that Padre Agostino recorded one instance in which Padre Pio was able to subsist for at least 20 days at Verafeno on only the [[Eucharist]] without any other nourishment), the ability to read hearts, the gift of [[tongues]], the gift of conversions, and pleasant-smelling wounds.&lt;ref name = "garabandal"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Pelletier |first=Joseph A |title=Padre Pio, Mary, and the Rosary |website=Garabandal |url=http://www.garabandal.us/padre-pio-mary-and-the-rosary-rev-joseph-pelletier-aa |accessdate=2008-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His stigmata, regarded as evidence of holiness, were studied by physicians whose independence from the Church is not known.&lt;ref name="time1"/&gt; The observations were unexplainable and the wounds never became infected.&lt;ref name="time2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Freze|year=1989|title=''They Bore the Wounds of Christ: The Mystery of the Sacred Stigmata''|publisher=OSV Publishing|isbn=978-0-87973-422-0|pages=283–285}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wounds healed once but reappeared.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9375317 Padre Pio]&lt;/ref&gt; They were examined by Luigi Romanelli, chief physician of the City Hospital of Barletta, for about one year. Dr. [[Giorgio Festa]], a private practitioner, also examined them in 1920 and 1925. Professor [[Giuseppe Bastianelli]], physician to [[Pope Benedict XV]], agreed that the wounds existed but made no other comment. Pathologist Dr. [[Amico Bignami]] of the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome]] also observed the wounds but could make no diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/pio-padre|title=Padre Pio|website=Answers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Bignami and Dr. Giuseppe Sala commented on the unusually smooth edges of the wounds and lack of [[edema]]. Dr. Alberto Caserta took [[x-ray]]s of Padre Pio's hands in 1954 and found no abnormality in the bone structure.&lt;ref&gt;Ruffin, Bernard. ''Padre Pio: The True Story''; 1991 OSV Press {{ISBN|0-87973-673-9}} pages 160–163&lt;/ref&gt;

He was said to act embarrassed by this condition and most photographs show him wearing red mittens or black coverings on his hands and feet where the bleeding occurred.&lt;ref name="time2"/&gt; At the time of Padre Pio's death, his body appeared unwounded, with no sign of scarring. There was a report that doctors who examined his body found it empty of all blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2006-05-12|url=http://www.padrepio.com/his-life| title =Padre Pio's Cell| website =Padre Pio Foundation| accessdate = 2006-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were both religious and non-religious critics who accused Padre Pio of faking his stigmata, saying he used [[carbolic acid]] to make the wounds. In 2007, ''The Telegraph'' reported on the book, ''The Other Christ: Padre Pio and 19th Century Italy,'' by the historian Sergio Luzzatto. He recounted that in 1919, according to one document in the Vatican's archive, Maria De Vito, the cousin of a local pharmacist at Foggia, testified that the young Padre Pio bought four grams of carbolic acid in 1919. &lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;Quote: Maria De Vito said, "I was an admirer of Padre Pio and I met him for the first time on July 31, 1919...he gave me personally an empty bottle, and asked if I would act as a chauffeur to transport it back from Foggia to San Giovanni Rotondo with four grams of pure carbolic acid. ... He explained that the acid was for disinfecting syringes for injections. He also asked for other things, such as Valda pastilles." {{cite news|last=Moore|first=Malcolm| title = Italy's Padre Pio 'faked his stigmata with acid'| date = 2007-10-24| location =  Rome| url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1567216/Italys-Padre-Pio-faked-his-stigmata-with-acid.html|accessdate = 2012-04-25| work=The Daily Telegraph}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic Anti-Defamation League said Luzzatto was spreading "anti-Catholic libels" and needed to learn more about religion.&lt;ref name="telegraph"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Padre Pio a Fraud, Pope John XXIII Believed |url=http://www.italiausa.com/ra/3563.htm |accessdate=23 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The church dismissed charges that he had faked the stigmata. "The boys had needed injections to fight the Spanish Flu which was raging at that time. Due to a shortage of doctors, Padres Paolino and Pio administered the shots, using carbolic acid as a sterilizing agent.”&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rega (2005), p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/richard-schiffman/padre-pio-stigmata_b_1112113.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Richard | last=Schiffman | title=Did Padre Pio Fake His Stigmata Wounds? | date=2011-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transverberation and visible stigmata===
{{Christian mysticism}}

Based on Padre Pio's correspondence, even early in his priesthood he experienced less obvious indications of the visible stigmata for which he would later become famous.&lt;ref name="stigmata"&gt;{{cite book|last = McGregor, O.C.S.O| first = Augustine| author2 = Fr. Alessio Parente, O.F.M. Cap.| title = The Spirituality of Padre Pio| publisher = Our Lady of Grace Monastery| year = 1974| location =  San Giovanni Rotondo, FG, Italy| url = http://www.ewtn.com/padrepio/mystic/stigmata.htm| accessdate = 2015-01-16}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1911 letter, Padre Pio wrote to his spiritual advisor Padre Benedetto from [[San Marco in Lamis]], describing something he had been experiencing for a year:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Then last night something happened which I can neither explain nor understand. In the middle of the palms of my hands a red mark appeared, about the size of a penny, accompanied by acute pain in the middle of the red marks. The pain was more pronounced in the middle of the left hand, so much so that I can still feel it. Also under my feet I can feel some pain.&lt;ref name="stigmata"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His close friend Padre Agostino wrote to him in 1915, asking specific questions, such as when he first experienced visions, whether he had been granted the stigmata, and whether he felt the pains of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion of Christ]], namely the crowning of thorns and the scourging. Padre Pio replied that he had been favoured with visions since his novitiate period (1903 to 1904). He wrote that although he had been granted the stigmata, he had been so terrified by the phenomenon he begged the Lord to withdraw them. He wrote that he did not wish the pain to be removed, only the visible wounds, since at the time he purportedly considered them to be an indescribable and almost unbearable humiliation.&lt;ref name="stigmata"/&gt;  The visible wounds disappeared at that point, but reappeared in September 1918. He reported, however, that the pain remained and was more acute on specific days and under certain circumstances. He also said that he was suffering the pain of the crown of thorns and the scourging. He did not define the frequency of these occurrences but said that he had been suffering from them at least once weekly for some years.&lt;ref name="stigmata"/&gt;

These events are alleged to have caused his health to fail, for which reason he was permitted to stay at home. To maintain his religious life as a friar while away from the community, he celebrated The Holy Mass daily and taught at school.

[[St. John of the Cross]] describes the phenomenon of [[transverberation]] as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The soul being inflamed with the love of God which is interiorly attacked by a Seraph, who pierces it through with a fiery dart. This leaves the soul wounded, which causes it to suffer from the overflowing of divine love.&lt;ref name = "gerhold"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Padre Pio portret.jpg|thumb|left|A strong believer in [[Christian meditation]], Padre Pio stated: "Through the study of books one seeks God; by meditation one finds him."&lt;ref name="The Rosary pages 79"&gt;''The Rosary: A Path Into Prayer'' by Liz Kelly 2004 {{ISBN|0-8294-2024-X}} pp. 79, 86&lt;/ref&gt;]]
World War I continued and in July 1918, Pope Benedict XV, who had termed the World War "the suicide of Europe," appealed to all Christians urging them to pray for an end to the World War. On July 27 of the same year, Padre Pio offered himself as a victim for the end of the war. Days passed and between August 5 and 7, Padre Pio had a vision in which Christ appeared and pierced his side.&lt;ref name = "gerhold"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ewtn2"/&gt;

As a result, Padre Pio had a physical wound in his side. This occurrence is considered as a "transverberation" or piercing of the heart, indicating the union of love with God. (On 8 August, the [[Allies (World War I)|Allies]] began the [[Hundred Days Offensive]], which led to the armistice with Germany and the end of the war.)
[[File:3rd class relic PIO.jpg|thumb|Many books about Padre Pio included a [[Relic|third-class relic]] (cloth) on a prayer card. This is an older one from when he was only Venerable ... Today he is Saint Pio.]]
As a side-note, a [[Relic#Catholic classification and prohibitions|first-class relic]] of Padre Pio, which consists of a large framed square of linen bearing a bloodstain from "the wound of the transverberation of the heart" in his side, is exposed for public veneration at the [[St. John Cantius Church (Chicago)|St. John Cantius Church]] in Chicago.&lt;ref name="cantius"&gt;{{Cite web| title = First class relic of St. Padre Pio of Pietrelcina at St. John Cantius Church| url = http://www.cantius.org/go/organizations/relic_of_st_padre_pio_of_pietrelcina| accessdate = 2008-01-19| postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many books published about Saint Pio included a small prayer card with a cloth third-class relic.

[[File:Santa Maria Madre di Dio a Fornacelle 6.jpg|thumb|A sculpture of Padre Pio in Italy raised October 28, 2006]]
The occasion of transverberation coincided with a seven-week-long period of spiritual unrest for Padre Pio. One of his Capuchin brothers said this of his state during that period:

&lt;blockquote&gt;During this time his entire appearance looked altered as if he had died. He was constantly weeping and sighing, saying that God had forsaken him.&lt;ref name = "gerhold"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a letter from Padre Pio to Padre Benedetto, dated 21 August 1918, Padre Pio writes of his experiences during the transverberation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;While I was hearing the boys’ confessions on the evening of the 5th [August] I was suddenly terrorized by the sight of a celestial person who presented himself to my mind’s eye. He had in his hand a sort of weapon like a very long sharp-pointed steel blade which seemed to emit fire. At the very instant that I saw all this, I saw that person hurl the weapon into my soul with all his might. I cried out with difficulty and felt I was dying. I asked the boy to leave because I felt ill and no longer had the strength to continue. This agony lasted uninterruptedly until the morning of the 7th. I cannot tell you how much I suffered during this period of anguish. Even my entrails were torn and ruptured by the weapon, and nothing was spared. From that day on I have been mortally wounded. I feel in the depths of my soul a wound that is always open and which causes me continual agony.&lt;ref name="cantius"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On September 20, 1918, accounts state that the pains of the transverberation had ceased and Padre Pio was in "profound peace."&lt;ref name = "gerhold"/&gt; On that day, as Padre Pio was engaged in prayer in the choir loft in the Church of Our Lady of Grace, the same Being who had appeared to him and given him the transverberation, and who is believed to be the Wounded Christ, appeared again, and Padre Pio had another experience of [[religious ecstasy]]. When the ecstasy ended, Padre Pio had received the visible stigmata, the five wounds of Christ. This time, the stigmata were permanent. They stayed visible for the next fifty years of his life.&lt;ref name="ewtn2"/&gt;

In a letter to Padre Benedetto, his superior and spiritual advisor from [[San Marco in Lamis]], dated October 22, 1918, Padre Pio describes his experience of receiving the stigmata:

&lt;blockquote&gt;On the morning of the 20th of last month, in the choir, after I had celebrated Mass I yielded to a drowsiness similar to a sweet sleep. [...] I saw before me a mysterious person similar to the one I had seen on the evening of 5 August. The only difference was that his hands and feet and side were dripping blood. This sight terrified me and what I felt at that moment is indescribable. I thought I should have died if the Lord had not intervened and strengthened my heart which was about to burst out of my chest. The vision disappeared and I became aware that my hands, feet and side were dripping blood. Imagine the agony I experienced and continue to experience almost every day. The heart wound bleeds continually, especially from Thursday evening until Saturday. Dear Father, I am dying of pain because of the wounds and the resulting embarrassment I feel deep in my soul. I am afraid I shall bleed to death if the Lord does not hear my heartfelt supplication to relieve me of this condition. Will Jesus, who is so good, grant me this grace? Will he at least free me from the embarrassment caused by these outward signs? I will raise my voice and will not stop imploring him until in his mercy he takes away, not the wound or the pain, which is impossible since I wish to be inebriated with pain, but these outward signs which cause me such embarrassment and unbearable humiliation&lt;ref name="cantius"/&gt;....the pain was so intense that I began to feel as if I were dying on the cross.&lt;ref&gt;Fortin, Fr. Michael. [http://www.angelusonline.org/index.php?section=articles&amp;subsection=show_article&amp;article_id=3547 ''Padre Pio, A Priest.''] [http://www.angelusonline.org ''The Angelus Online'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Poor health==
In addition to his childhood illnesses, throughout his life Padre Pio suffered from "asthmatic bronchitis." He also had a large kidney stone, with frequent abdominal pains. He suffered from a chronic gastritis, which later turned into an ulcer. He also suffered from inflammations of the eye, nose, ear, and throat, and eventually formed [[rhinitis]] and chronic [[otitis]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

In 1925, Padre Pio was operated on for an [[inguinal hernia]], and shortly after this a large cyst formed on his neck that was surgically removed. Another surgery was required to remove a malignant tumor on his ear. After this operation Padre Pio was subjected to radiological treatment, which was successful, it seems, after only two treatments.&lt;ref&gt;R.Allegri, ''I miracoli di Padre Pio'', p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, he came down with a serious case of "''exudative [[Pleurisy|pleuritis]]''". The diagnosis was certified by Cataldo Cassano, a professor who personally extracted the serous liquid from the body of Padre Pio.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} He remained bedridden for four consecutive months. In his old age Padre Pio was tormented by painful arthritis.

==Controversies==
Because of the unusual abilities Padre Pio was said to possess, the [[Holy See]] instituted investigations of the related accounts. The local bishop, Pasquale Gagliardi, did not believe Padre Pio’s alleged miracles, suggesting that his Capuchin brothers were making a display out of the monk to gain financial advantage. When [[Pope Pius XI|Pius XI]] became pope in 1922, the Vatican became extremely doubtful. Padre Pio was subject to numerous investigations.&lt;ref name="time2"/&gt;

The Vatican imposed severe sanctions on Padre Pio to reduce publicity about him: it forbade him from saying Mass in public, blessing people, answering letters, showing his stigmata publicly, and communicating with Padre Benedetto, his spiritual director. Padre Pio was to be relocated to another convent in northern Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caccioppoli.com/Close%20encounters%20of%20the%20special%20kind%20of%20Padre%20Pio%20with%20inquisition%20(1919-1933).%20St.%20Mary%20of%20Graces.%20House%20for%20the%20relief%20of%20suffering%20.%20(1916-1957).html|title=Close encounters with Padre Pio|publisher=PadrePio|accessdate=2014-05-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The local people threatened to riot, and the Vatican left Padre Pio where he was.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Allen| first = John L.| title = For all who feel put upon by the Vatican: A new patron saint of Holy Rehabilitation| journal = National Catholic Reporter| volume = 1| issue = 18| date = December 28, 2001| url =http://www.nationalcatholicreporter.org/word/word1228.htm| accessdate = 2008-01-19| postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fearing these local riots, the Vatican dropped a plan to transfer Padre Pio to another friary, and a second plan for removal was also changed.&lt;ref name = "ncr"&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Allen| first = John L.| title = For all who feel put upon by the Vatican: A new patron saint of Holy Rehabilitation| journal = National Catholic Reporter| volume = 1| issue = 18| date = December 28, 2001| url =http://www.nationalcatholicreporter.org/word/word1228.htm| accessdate = 2008-01-19| postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1921 to 1922 he was prevented from publicly performing his priestly duties, such as hearing confessions and saying Mass.&lt;ref name="time1"/&gt; From 1924 to 1931, the Holy See made statements denying that the events in Padre Pio's life were due to any divine cause.&lt;ref name="ewtn2"/&gt;

The founder of Milan's [[Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore|Catholic University of the Sacred Heart]], friar, physician, and psychologist [[Agostino Gemelli]], met Padre Pio once, for a few minutes, and was unable to examine his stigmata.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newoxfordreview.org/reviews.jsp?did=0112-baruch|title=New Oxford Review|website=newoxfordreview.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gemelli, Padre Pio was "an ignorant and self-mutilating psychopath who exploited people's credulity."&lt;ref name="NZ"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Vallely| first = Paul| title = Vatican makes a saint of the man it silenced| date = 2002-06-17 |work=New Zealand Herald| url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/2/story.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=2047151| accessdate = 2008-01-20| postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gemelli speculated that Padre Pio kept his wounds open with [[carbolic acid]]. As a result, Padre Pio was required to wrap the wounds in cloth. For many years, he wore fingerless gloves that concealed his wounds. According to believers, the bleeding continued for some 50 years until the wounds closed within hours of his death.&lt;ref name = "ncr"/&gt;
 
According to the historian Sergio Luzzatto, a document found in the Vatican's archive reveals the testimony of a cousin of a pharmacist who said that the young Padre Pio bought four grams of carbolic acid in 1919. The archbishop of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Manfredonia-Vieste-S. Giovanni Rotondo|Manfredonia]], Pasquale Gagliardi, reported this as evidence that Padre Pio could have effected the stigmata with acid. This suggestion was examined and dismissed by the Vatican.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1567216/Italys-Padre-Pio-faked-his-stigmata-with-acid.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Malcolm | last=Moore | title=Italy's Padre Pio 'faked his stigmata with acid' | date=23 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
By 1933, the tide began to turn, with [[Pope Pius XI]] ordering the Holy See to reverse its ban on Padre Pio’s public celebration of Mass. The pope said, "I have not been badly disposed toward Padre Pio, but I have been badly informed."&lt;ref name="ewtn2"/&gt; In 1934, the friar was again allowed to hear confessions. He was also given honorary permission to preach despite never having taken the exam for the preaching license. [[Pope Pius XII]], who assumed the papacy in 1939, encouraged devotees to visit Padre Pio.

In 1940, Padre Pio began plans to open a [[hospital]] in San Giovanni Rotondo, to be named the [[Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza]] or "Home to Relieve Suffering." The hospital opened in 1956.&lt;ref name="ewtn2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="time1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,855088,00.html|title=Religion: The Stigmatist|date=December 19, 1949|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=7 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barbara Ward]], a British humanitarian and journalist on assignment in Italy, played a major role in obtaining for this project a grant of $325,000 from the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]] (UNRRA).

[[Pope Paul VI]] (pope from 1963 to 1978), in the mid-1960s dismissed all accusations against Padre Pio.&lt;ref name="time2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ncr"/&gt;

In 1947, Father Karol Józef Wojtyła (later [[Pope John Paul II]]), a young [[Catholicism in Poland|Polish priest]]  who was studying in Rome at the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']], visited Padre Pio, who heard his confession. Austrian [[Alfons Stickler|Cardinal Alfons Stickler]] reported that Wojtyła confided to him that during this meeting, Padre Pio told him he would one day ascend to "the highest post in the church though further confirmation is needed."&lt;ref name="kwitny"&gt;{{cite book | last=Kwitny | first=Jonathan | title=Man of the Century: The Life and Times of Pope John Paul II | publisher=Henry Holt and Company |date=March 1997 | location=[[New York City|New York]] | pages=768 | isbn=978-0-8050-2688-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cardinal Stickler said that Wojtyła believed that the prophecy was fulfilled when he became a cardinal.&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;{{Cite news | last=Zahn | first=Paula | author-link=Paula Zahn | title=Padre Pio Granted Sainthood | newspaper=CNN | date=2002-06-17 | url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0206/17/ltm.04.html | accessdate=2008-01-19 | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Paul's secretary, [[Stanisław Dziwisz]], denies the prediction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=A Life with Karol: My Forty-Year Friendship with the Man Who Became Pope | last=Dziwisz | first=Stanisław | publisher=Doubleday | year=2008 | isbn=978-0-385-52374-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[George Weigel|George Weigel's]] biography ''Witness to Hope'', which contains an account of the same visit, does not mention it.

[[Pope John Paul II]] (pope from 1978 to 2005) started the [[canonization]] process of Padre Pio and canonized him in 2002.

==Later life==
[[File:KOS San Giovanni Rotondo.jpg|thumb|The Hospital that was built on Padre Pio's initiative in [[San Giovanni Rotondo]], [[Italy]]. (''Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza'')]] [[File:Saint Benedict Medal.jpg|thumb|The [[Saint Benedict Medal]] was a gift Padre Pio often gave as a present to his visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Padre Pio|publisher=Catholica|author=Ylva-Christina Sjöblom|date=2003|isbn=978-91-86428-84-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Padre Pio became a very well-known priest. Franciscan spirituality is characterized by a life of poverty, love of nature, and giving charity to those in need.  Franciscan prayer recognizes God's presence in the wonder of creation. This is seen clearly in St. Francis' [[Canticle of the Sun]]. Franciscan spirituality is focused on walking in Christ's footsteps, understanding God by doing what Christ asked, experiencing and sharing God.

Later Padre Pio became a spiritual director. He had five rules for spiritual growth: weekly confession, daily Communion, spiritual reading, meditation, and examination of conscience.&lt;ref name="ewtn2"&gt;{{Cite web| title =  Padre Pio the Man Part 2| url = http://www.ewtn.com/padrepio/man/biography2.htm| accessdate = 2008-01-19| postscript =  &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Padre Pio was devoted to [[Rosary devotions and spirituality|rosary meditations]] and said:&lt;ref name="The Rosary pages 79"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The person who meditates and turns his mind to God, who is the mirror of his soul, seeks to know his faults, tries to correct them, moderates his impulses, and puts his conscience in order."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He compared weekly confession to dusting a room weekly, and recommended the performance of meditation and self-examination twice daily: once in the morning, as preparation to face the day, and once again in the evening, as retrospection. His advice on the practical application of theology he often summed up in his now famous quote, "Pray, Hope and Don’t Worry". He directed Christians to recognize God in all things and to desire above all things to do the will of God.&lt;ref name="ewtn2"/&gt;

The novelist [[Graham Greene]] had two photos of Padre Pio in his wallet after attending one of his Masses. He said that Padre Pio had “introduced a doubt in my disbelief.”&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Many people who heard of him traveled to [[San Giovanni Rotondo]] in the south of Italy to meet him and confess to him, ask for help, or have their curiosity satisfied. Padre Pio's mother died at the village around the convent in 1928. Later, in 1938, Padre Pio had his old father Grazio living with him in the village of San Giovanni Rotondo. His brother Michele also moved into the village with their father. Padre Pio's father lived in a little house outside the convent, until his death in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author =Ylva-Kristina Sjöblom|title=Padre Pio|publisher=Catholica|pages=10, 85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
[[File:Pamplona - Iglesia de San Antonio (PP Capuchinos) 10.jpg|thumb|A sculpture of Pio of Pietrelcina in the Franciscan San Antonio church in [[Pamplona]], [[Spain]]]]
Padre Pio died in 1968 at the age of 81. His health deteriorated in the 1960s but he continued his spiritual works. On September 21, 1968, the day after the 50th anniversary of his receiving the stigmata, Padre Pio felt great fatigue.&lt;ref name="PioProfile"/&gt;  The next day, on September 22, 1968, he was supposed to offer a [[Solemn Mass]], but feeling weak, he asked his superior if he might say a [[Low Mass]] instead, as he had done daily for years. Due to the large number of pilgrims present for the Mass, Padre Pio's superior decided the Solemn Mass must proceed. Padre Pio carried out his duties but appeared extremely weak and fragile. His voice was weak and, after the Mass had concluded, he nearly collapsed while walking down the altar steps. He needed help from his Capuchin brothers. This was his last celebration of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]].

Early in the morning of September 23, 1968, Padre Pio made his last [[Sacrament of Reconciliation|confession]] and renewed his Franciscan vows.&lt;ref name="ewtn2"/&gt; As was customary, he had his [[rosary]] in his hands, though he did not have the strength to say the [[Hail Mary]]s aloud. Till the end, he repeated the words "Gesù, Maria" (Jesus, Mary). At around 2:30&amp;nbsp;a.m., he said, "I see two mothers" (taken to mean his mother and Mary).&lt;ref name="PioProfile"/&gt;  At 2:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. he died in his cell in San Giovanni Rotondo with his last breath whispering, "Maria!"&lt;ref name="Ruffin"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Ruffin| first = Bernard C.| authorlink = C.

His body was buried on September 26 in a crypt in the Church of Our Lady of Grace. His [[Requiem|Requiem Mass]] was attended by over 100,000 people. He had often said, "After my death I will do more. My real mission will begin after my death."&lt;ref name="PioProfile"/&gt; The accounts of those who stayed with Padre Pio till the end state that the stigmata had completely disappeared without a scar. Only a red mark "as if drawn by a red pencil" remained on his side but it disappeared.&lt;ref name="PioProfile"&gt;

==Reported supernatural phenomena==
[[File:Padre Pio during Mass.jpg|thumb|left|Padre Pio celebrating mass. His Mass would often last hours, as the mystic received visions and experienced sufferings. Note the coverings worn on his hands to cover his [[stigmata]].]]

Padre Pio was said to have had the gift of reading [[soul]]s, the ability to [[Bilocation|bilocate]], among other supernatural phenomena. He was said to communicate with angels and worked favors and healings before they were requested of him.&lt;ref name="Cruz"&gt;{{cite book| last = Carroll-Cruz| first = Joan| title = Mysteries Marvels and Miracles In the Lives of the Saints| publisher = TAN Books|date=March 1997| location = [[Illinois]]| pages = 581| isbn = 978-0-89555-541-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reports of supernatural phenomena surrounding Padre Pio attracted fame and legend. The Vatican was initially skeptical.

In the 1999 book, ''Padre Pio: The Wonder Worker'', a segment by Irish priest Malachy Gerard Carroll describes the story of [[Gemma de Giorgi]], a Sicilian girl whose blindness was believed to have been cured during a visit to Padre Pio.&lt;ref name="wonder"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Kalvelage| first = Bro. Francis Mary| title = Padre Pio: The Wonder Worker| isbn = 978-0-89870-770-0| publisher  = Ignatius Press| pages =210| year = 1999| postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gemma, who was brought to San Giovanni Rotondo in 1947 by her grandmother, was born without pupils. During her trip to see Padre Pio, the little girl began to see objects, including a steamboat and the sea.&lt;ref name="wonder"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.padrepiodevotions.org/2002april.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608004702/http://www.padrepiodevotions.org/2002april.asp|archivedate=2009-06-08|title =THE HEALING OF GEMMA DI GIORGI| accessdate = 2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gemma's grandmother did not believe the child had been healed. After Gemma forgot to ask Padre Pio for [[Actual grace|grace]] during her confession, her grandmother implored the priest to ask God to restore her sight.&lt;ref name=" wonder"/&gt; Padre Pio told her, "The child must not weep and neither must you for the child sees and you know she sees."&lt;ref name="wonder"/&gt;

Padre Pio believed the love of God is inseparable from suffering, and that suffering all things for the sake of God is the way for the soul to reach God. He felt that his soul was lost in a chaotic maze, plunged into total desolation, as if he were in the deepest pit of hell. 

Father [[Gabriele Amorth]], senior exorcist of [[Vatican City]], stated in an interview that Padre Pio was able to distinguish between real apparitions of Jesus, Mary and the saints and the illusions created by the devil, by carefully analysing the state of his mind and the feelings produced in him during the apparitions. In one of Padre Pio's letters, he states that he remained patient in the midst of his trials because of his firm belief that Jesus, Mary, his guardian angel, St. Joseph, and St. Francis were always with him and helped him &lt;ref name="dev"&gt;{{cite web| title = Padre Pio da Pietrelcina Epistolario I° (1910–1922)| url = http://www.padrepio.catholicwebservices.com/ENGLISH/The_Devil.htm
|accessdate = 2008-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his period of spiritual suffering, his followers believe that Padre Pio was attacked by the devil, both physically and spiritually.&lt;ref name="garabandal" /&gt; His followers also believe that the devil used diabolical tricks in order to increase Padre Pio's torments. These included apparitions as an "angel of light" and the alteration or destruction of letters to and from his spiritual directors. Padre Augustine confirmed this when he said:

[[File:Pio of Pietrelcina.jpg|thumb|left|Padre Pio helped by other friars]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;Now, twenty-two days have passed since Jesus allowed the devils to vent their anger on me. My Father, my whole body is bruised from the beatings that I have received to the present time by our enemies. Several times, they have even torn off my shirt so that they could strike my exposed flesh.&lt;ref name="dev"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Padre Pio reported engaging in physical combat with Satan and his minions, similar to incidents described concerning St. [[John Vianney]], from which he was said to have sustained extensive bruising.

On the day of Padre Pio's death, mystic and [[Servant of God]] [[Maria Esperanza de Bianchini]] from [[Venezuela]] reported that he appeared to her in a vision and said, "I have come to say good-bye. My time has come. It is your turn."&lt;ref name="Where are the Mantles"&gt;Brooks, Stevern, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pqwQWYvrpasC&amp;dq Where are the Mantles], pp. 49–51, Xulon Books&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spiritdaily.net"&gt;Brown, Michael [http://www.spiritdaily.net/Esperanza_story.htm The Incredible Story Of Maria Esperanza] Spirit Daily&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;Davidson, Linda Kay and David Martin Gitlitz, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YVYkrNhPMQkC&amp;dq Pilgrimage: from the Ganges to Graceland : an encyclopedia, Volume 1], p. 59, ABC-CLIO 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Her husband saw his wife's face transfigured into that of Padre Pio.&lt;ref name="spiritdaily.net" /&gt; On the following day, they learned that Padre Pio had died.&lt;ref name="Where are the Mantles" /&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google.com" /&gt; Witnesses say they later saw Esperanza levitating during Mass and engaging in bilocation.&lt;ref name="books.google.com" /&gt; Padre [[Domenico da Cese]], a fellow Capuchin stigmatist, reported that on Sunday, September 22, 1968, he saw Padre Pio kneeling in prayer before the [[Holy Face of Manoppello]], although it was known that Padre Pio had not left his room.&lt;ref&gt;The Face of God, Paul Badde, p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sainthood and later recognition==
[[File:Padre Clemente Da Postiglione e San Pio.jpg|thumb|right|Padre Pio with Padre Clemente Tomay, his friend and confessor.]]
Padre Pio was considered holy even during his lifetime. In 1971, three years after his death, [[Pope Paul VI]] said to the superiors of the Capuchin Order about the monk:

{{cquote|Look what fame he had, what a worldwide following gathered around him! But why? Perhaps because he was a philosopher? Because he was wise? Because he had resources at his disposal? Because he said Mass humbly, heard confessions from dawn to dusk and was&amp;ndash;it is not easy to say it&amp;ndash;one who bore the wounds of our Lord. He was a man of prayer and suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.piercedhearts.org/theology_heart/writings_on_saints/prayer_charity_joy_forgiveness_padrepio_omalley.htm|title=By Cardinal O'Malley OFM Cap. Prayer, etc |publisher=Archdiocese of Boston|accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1982, the Holy See authorized the [[archbishop of Manfredonia]] to open an investigation to determine whether Padre Pio should be considered a saint. The investigation continued for seven years. In 1990 Padre Pio was declared a [[Servant of God]], the first step in the process of canonization. The investigation however did not lead to any public factual clearance by the Church on his previous 'excommunication' or on the allegations that his stigmata were not of a supernatural kind. Moreover, Pio's stigmata were remarkably left out of the obligatory investigations for the canonization process, in order to avoid obstacles prohibiting a successful closure.

Beginning in 1990, the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] debated how Padre Pio had lived his life, and in 1997 Pope John Paul II declared him [[venerable]]. A discussion of the effects of his life on others followed. Cases were studied such as a reported cure of an Italian woman, Consiglia de Martino, associated with Padre Pio's [[intercession]]. In 1999, on the advice of the Congregation, John Paul II declared Padre Pio blessed. A media offensive by the Capuchins was able to realise a broad acceptation of the contested saint in society.&lt;ref&gt; Peter Jan Margry, 'Il "marketing" di Padre Pio. Strategie cappuccine e Vaticane e la coscienza religiosa collettiva', in: ''Sanctorum. Revista dell'associazione Italiana per lo studio della santità, dei culti e dell'agiografia'' 5 (2008) pp. 141–167.&lt;/ref&gt;

After further consideration of Padre Pio's virtues and ability to do good even after his death, including discussion of another healing attributed to his intercession, the pope declared Padre Pio a saint on June 16, 2002.&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt; An estimated 300,000 people attended the canonization ceremony.&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt;

[[File:Chiesa San Pio da Pietrelcina.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Sanctuary of Saint Pio of Pietrelcina]] in [[San Giovanni Rotondo]]]]
On July 1, 2004, Pope John Paul II dedicated the [[Sanctuary of Saint Pio of Pietrelcina]] (sometimes referred as ''Padre Pio Pilgrimage Church''), built in the village of San Giovanni Rotondo to the memory of Saint Pio of Pietrelcina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date = 2004-07-02 | url =https://www.theguardian.com/arts/news/story/0,11711,1252387,00.html| title =Guardian Unlimited Arts | work =Monumental church dedicated to controversial saint Padre Pio | accessdate =2006-05-12 | location=London | first=John | last=Hooper}}&lt;/ref&gt; A statue of Saint Pio in [[Messina]], [[Sicily]] attracted attention in 2002 when it wept tears of blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date = 2002-03-06 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1858430.stm| title =Italian statue weeps blood| accessdate =2006-05-12 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saint Pio of Pietrelcina is known as the patron saint of civil defense volunteers, after a group of 160 petitioned the Italian Bishops’ conference for this designation. The bishops forwarded the request to the Vatican, which gave its approval to the designation.&lt;ref name="Patron"&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Italy makes St. Padre Pio patron of civil defense volunteers| date = 2004-03-30| journal = The Georgia Bulletin| url = http://www.georgiabulletin.org/world/2004/03/30/WORLD-1/| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20040911110421/http://www.georgiabulletin.org/world/2004/03/30/WORLD-1/| dead-url = yes| archive-date = 2004-09-11| accessdate = 2010-08-20| postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also “less officially” known as the patron saint of stress relief and the “January blues,” after the Catholic Enquiry Office in London proclaimed him as such. They designated the most depressing day of the year, identified as January 22, as Don’t Worry Be Happy Day, in honor of Padre Pio’s famous advice:  “Pray, hope, and don’t worry.”&lt;ref name="PatronII"&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Saint Pio of Pietrelcina| date = 2009-07-31| journal  = BBC Religions| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/saints/pio.shtml| accessdate = 2010-08-20| postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Padre Pio has become one of the world's most popular saints.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Jan Margry, 'Merchandising and Sanctity: the invasive cult of Padre Pio', in: ''Journal of Modern Italian Studies'' 7 (2002) pp. 88–115&lt;/ref&gt; There are more than 3,000 "Padre Pio Prayer Groups" worldwide, with three million members. The very first St. Padre Pio parish http://www.stpp.church/home.html in the world was established June 16, 2002 in Kleinburg, Ontario, Canada.  There are [[parish]]es in [[Vineland, New Jersey|Vineland]] and [[Lavallette, New Jersey]], and [[Sydney]], [[Australia]], and [[shrine]]s in [[St. Padre Pio Shrine|Buena]], [[New Jersey]], and [[Santo Tomas, Batangas]], [[Philippines]], dedicated to Padre Pio. A 2006 survey by the magazine ''[[Famiglia Cristiana]]'' found that more Italian Catholics pray to Padre Pio for [[intercession]] than to any other figure. (This prayer, more properly understood as a request that the saint intercede to God, is not to be confused with worship, which the Catholic Church teaches is due only to God.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24278009/ "Exhumed body of Italian saint draws thousands". ''Reuters''. 24 April 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was announced in 2009 that a renewable energy statue of Padre Pio was to be built on a hill near the town of [[San Giovanni Rotondo]] in the south-eastern province of [[Apulia]], Italy, the town where he is commemorated. The project would cost several million pounds, with the money to be raised from the saint's devotees around the world. The statue would be coated in a special photovoltaic paint, enabling it to trap the sun's heat and produce solar energy, making it an "ecological" religious icon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/5978928/Italy-to-build-solar-energy-producing-statue-of-saint.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Italy to build solar-energy-producing statue of saint | first=Nick | last=Squires | date=2009-08-05 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 3, 2008, the body of St. Pio was exhumed from his crypt, forty years after his death, so that his remains could be prepared for display. A church statement described the body as being in "fair condition". [[Archbishop]] Domenico Umberto D'Ambrosio, [[Papal legate]] to the shrine in San Giovanni Rotondo, stated "the top part of the skull is partly skeletal but the chin is perfect and the rest of the body is well preserved".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7275514.stm|title=Italy exhumes revered monk's body|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=16 March 2008|date=3 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archbishop D’Ambrosio also confirmed in a communiqué that “the stigmata are not visible.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.zenit.org/article-21974?l=english |title= St. Padre Pio's Body Exhumed |accessdate= 2008-03-06 |publisher= Zenit |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080428175218/http://www.zenit.org/article-21974?l=english |archivedate= 2008-04-28 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that St. Pio's hands "looked like they had just undergone a manicure". It was hoped that [[morticians]] would be able to restore the face so that it will be recognizable. However, because of its deterioration, his face was covered with a lifelike [[silicone]] mask.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/1902770/Pilgrims-flock-to-see-body-of-Padre-Pio.html Moore, Malcolm.

His hands hold a large wooden cross. 800,000 [[pilgrims]] worldwide, mostly from Italy, made reservations to view the body up to December 2008, but only 7,200 people a day were able to file past the crystal coffin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/reuters/2008/04/23/europe/OUKWD-UK-ITALY-SAINT.php iht.com, Faithful await display of Catholic mystic's body]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stripes.com/article.asp?section=104&amp;article=54332|title=Thousands in Italy flock to see exhumed saint Padre Pio|website=Stars and Stripes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldextra.com/content/view/263932/36/ heraldextra.com, Mystic monk is exhumed second time] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080426060706/http://www.heraldextra.com/content/view/263932/36/ |date=2008-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Officials extended the display through September, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23598597-2703,00.html www.theaustralian.news.com.au, Corpse of mystic monk moves the crowd]&lt;/ref&gt;

Saint Pio's remains were placed in the church of Saint Pio, which is beside San Giovanni Rotondo. In April 2010 they were moved to a special golden "Cripta".&lt;ref&gt;[http://corrieredelmezzogiorno.corriere.it/bari/notizie/cronaca/2010/19-aprile-2010/i-fedeli-salutano-san-pio-prima-traslazione-nuova-cripta-1602868921248.shtml Article (in Italian) with photos of ''Padre Pio'' golden Cripta]&lt;/ref&gt;

The remains of Saint Pio were brought to the Vatican for veneration during the 2015–2016 [[Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy]]. Saint Pio and Saint [[Leopold Mandic]] were designated as saint-confessors to inspire people to become reconciled to the Church and to God, by the confession of their sins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.romereports.com/2015/09/30/two-great-confessors-chosen-for-the-jubilee-of-mercy-saint-pio-and-saint-leopold |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151004001910/http://www.romereports.com/2015/09/30/two-great-confessors-chosen-for-the-jubilee-of-mercy-saint-pio-and-saint-leopold |archivedate=2015-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:SwansCygnus olor.jpg|right|thumb|The swan is a symbol of purity and transcendence in [[Vedanta|Vedantic teaching]].]]

'''Paramahamsa''' (परमाहंस), also spelled '''paramahansa''' or '''paramhansa''', is a [[Sanskrit]] religio-theological [[title of honor]] applied to [[Hindu]] spiritual teachers who are regarded as having attained [[Moksha|enlightenment]]. The title literally means "supreme swan," and symbolizes spiritual discrimination. The swan is equally at home on land and on water; similarly, the true sage is equally at home in the realms of matter and of spirit. To be in divine ecstasy and simultaneously to be actively wakeful is the ''paramahansa'' state; the 'royal swan' of the soul floats in the cosmic ocean, beholding both its body and the ocean as manifestations of the same Spirit. The word 'Paramahamsa' signifies one who is Awakened in all realms. &lt;ref&gt;Yogananda, Paramahansa. ''[[Bhagavad Gita (Yogananda)|God Talks with Arjuna - The Bhagavad Gita]]''. Self-Realization Fellowship 1995, {{ISBN|0-87612-030-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Paramahansa is the highest level of spiritual development in which a union with ultimate reality has been attained by a [[Sannyasa|sannyasi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/paramahamsa|title=Merriam-Webster Dictionary |accessdate=2012-06-21 |format= |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
{{original research|section|date=February 2013}}
''Paramahamsa'' is a Sanskrit word translated as 'supreme swan'.  The word is compounded of Sanskrit परम ''parama'' meaning 'supreme' or 'transcendent' (from [[PIE]] ''per'' meaning 'through', 'across', or 'beyond', cognate with [[English language|English]] ''far'') and Sanskrit हंस ''hamsa'' meaning '[[Anserinae|swan or wild goose]]'.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} The prefix ''parama'' is the same element seen in ''[[Parameshwara (God)|Parameshwara]]'', a title for [[God]]. Early English scholars{{weasel-inline|date=February 2013}} of Indian language and religion may have mockingly translated ''hamsa'' as 'goose' in particular, because in English folklore a [[goose]] (the domesticated type) traditionally denotes foolishness and irresponsibility.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} But in Hindic tradition, wild geese, including swans, are noted for characteristics of discipline, stamina, grace, and beauty.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} This is especially said of{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} the [[bar-headed goose]] (''Anser indicus''), whose migratory route from Central Asia to India and back forces it to fly over the [[Himalayas]] twice a year, a feat which makes it one of the highest flying birds in the world.&lt;ref name="Than"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/06/110610-highest-flying-birds-geese-himalaya-mountains-animals |title=Highest Flying Bird Found; Can Scale Himalaya: The Bar-headed Goose Can Reach Nearly 21,120 Feet, New Study Shows |first=Ker |last=Than |work=National Geographic News |date=June 10, 2011 |publisher=[[National Geographic Society]] |location=Washington, DC, US |accessdate=February 15, 2013 |archivedate=February 16, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ESilGnVV?url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/06/110610-highest-flying-birds-geese-himalaya-mountains-animals/ |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

''Hamsa'' may be a religious pun or allegory with a philosophical meaning. One such etymology suggests that the words 'aham' and 'sa' are joined to become 'hamsa'; ''aham'' is 'I' or 'me' and ''sa'' is 'he', together meaning 'I am he'. Here, 'I' refers to the ''jivatma'' or ''jivatama'', the living soul, and 'he' the ''paramatma'' or ''paramatama'' or supreme soul (the alternative spellings are due to differing Romanisations of the Sanskrit words).{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}  This relationship reflects of [[Advaita]] philosophy, which advocates the oneness of ''jivatma'' and ''paramatma''.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} The word ''aham'' is common to many Eastern religions. From ''aham'' is derived ''ahamkara'' or ego.{{clarify|date=February 2013|reason=Which means what? What is the relevance?}}

== Mythology ==
The ''hamsa'' (swan) is the [[vahana]], the mount or vehicle, of the god [[Brahma]]. In the [[Vedas]] and the [[Puranas|Purânas]] it is a symbol for the soul/Soul. The ''hamsa'' is said to be the only creature that is capable of separating milk from water once they have been mixed; symbolically this is the display of great spiritual discrimination. It is symbolic for a spiritually advanced  being who is capable of controlling the breath energy in such a way that he only absorbs pure vibrations from all the different energies the world contains. To the Paramahamsa (the supreme celestial Swan) on the other hand, the whole of creation is God himself, there is nothing else but God alone. This person is a fully realized soul, completely liberated from all bonds with the world, who knows no obligations, no likes or dislikes. He is without any needs because he is completely immersed in God.

== Theology ==
''Paramahamsa'', as a religio/theological title, is applied to an adept class of Hindu renunciates, liberated, realized masters who, having attained the supreme yogic state, or [[nirvikalpa]] [[samādhi]], can always distinguish between the Real (''sa'') from the unreal (''ham'').

The ''hamsa'' [[mantra]] indicates the sound made by the exhalation ("ha") and inhalation ("sa") of the breath.

== Privileged use ==
Some followers believe title cannot be assumed by oneself, but must be conferred by a recognized authority, either another individual swami who is himself esteemed as enlightened, or by a committee of spiritual leaders.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

== Other meaning ==
Paramahaṃsa is also the title of one of the [[Upanishad]]s.&lt;ref group=note&gt;In Sanskrit, a pre-consonantal [[nasal consonant|nasal]] is written with a [[diacritic]] dot (the [[Anusvara]]) above the preceding character. The exact realization of the [[nasalization]] must be inferred from the context. Thus, we have Paramahaṃsa, Paramahamsa, Paramahaṇsa, and Paramahansa as equivalent transliterations.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Philokalia''''' ({{lang-grc|φιλοκαλία}} "love of the beautiful, the good", from  {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:φιλία|φιλία]]}} ''[[:wikt:philia|philia]]'' "love" and {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:κάλλος|κάλλος]]}} ''kallos'' "beauty") is "a collection of texts written between the 4th and 15th centuries by spiritual masters"&lt;ref name="Ware10"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Ware, Kallistos |author2=Sherrard, Philip |title=The Philokalia: the complete text |publisher=Faber |location=London |year=1979 |page=10 |isbn=0-571-13013-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8ViqQ6qYSjIC&amp;pg=PA10}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] mystical [[hesychasm|hesychast]] tradition. They were originally written for the guidance and instruction of monks in "the practice of the contemplative life."&lt;ref name="Ware14"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8ViqQ6qYSjIC&amp;pg=PA14 Ware (1979), pp. 14-15.]&lt;/ref&gt; The collection was compiled in the eighteenth century by [[Nicodemus the Hagiorite]] and [[Macarius of Corinth]].

Although these works were individually known in the monastic culture of [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox Christianity]] before their inclusion in the ''Philokalia'', their presence in this collection resulted in a much wider readership due to its translation into several languages. The earliest translations included a [[Church Slavonic language]] translation of selected texts by [[Paisius Velichkovsky]] (''Dobrotolublye'', ''Добротолю́бїе'') in 1793, a Russian translation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://orthodoxthought.sovietpedia.com/|title=Orthodox Thought|website=orthodoxthought.sovietpedia.com|access-date=2017-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Ignatius Bryanchaninov]] in 1857, and a five-volume translation into Russian (''Dobrotolyubie'') by [[Theophan the Recluse]] in 1877. There were subsequent [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] translations.&lt;ref name="Ware11"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8ViqQ6qYSjIC&amp;pg=PA11 Ware (1979), pp. 11–12.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnson39"&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Christopher D.

''Philokalia'' (sometimes ''Philocalia'') is also the name given to an anthology of the writings of [[Origen]] compiled by [[Basil of Caesarea]] and [[Gregory of Nazianzus]]. Other works on monastic spirituality have also used the same title over the years.&lt;ref name="Palmer2006" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/origen_philocalia_02_text.htm  English translation online here]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Nicodemus the Hagiorite|Nikodemos]] and [[Macarius of Corinth|Makarios]] were monks at [[Mt. Athos]], a mountainous peninsula in northern Greece, historically considered the geographical center of Orthodox spirituality and home to twenty monasteries. The first edition, in Greek, was published in Venice in 1782, with a second Greek edition published in Athens in 1893. All the original texts were in Greek—two of them were first written in Latin and translated into Greek in the Byzantine era.&lt;ref name="Ware11" /&gt;

[[Paisius Velichkovsky]]'s translation into [[Church Slavonic]], ''Dobrotolublye'' (published in Moscow in 1793), included selected portions of the ''Philokalia'', and was the version that the pilgrim in ''[[The Way of a Pilgrim]]'' carried on his journey. That book about a Russian pilgrim who is seeking advice on interior prayer helped popularize the ''Philokalia'' and its teachings in Russia. Velichkovsky's translation was the first to become widely read by the public, away from the monasteries—helped by the popularity of ''The Way of a Pilgrim'', and the public influence of the ''[[startsy]]'' at [[Optina Monastery]] known as the Optina Elders. Two Russian language translations appeared in the 19th century, one by [[Ignatius Brianchaninov]] (1857), and [[Theophan the Recluse]]'s ''Dobrotolubiye'' (1877). The latter was published in five volumes, and included texts that were not in the original Greek edition.&lt;ref name="Ware11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnson39" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="Witte"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Witte, John F. |author2=Alexander, Frank S. |title=The teachings of modern Orthodox Christianity on law, politics, and human nature |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |year=2007 |page=6 |isbn=0-231-14265-X |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=THpyJ0jBeH0C&amp;pg=PA6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Velichkovsky was initially hesitant to share his translation outside of the Optina Monastery walls. He was concerned that people living in the world would not have the adequate supervision and guidance of the ''startsy'' in the monastery, nor would they have the support of the liturgical life of the monks. He was finally persuaded by the Metropolitan of St. Petersburg to publish the book in 1793. Brianchanivov expressed the same concerns in his work, warning his readers that regular practice of the [[Jesus Prayer]], without adequate guidance, could potentially cause [[Prelest|spiritual delusion]] and pride, even among monks. Their concerns were contrary to the original compiler of the ''Philokalia'', Nicodemos, who wrote that the Jesus Prayer could be used to good effect by anyone, whether monastic or layperson. All agreed that the teachings on constant inner prayer should be practiced under the guidance of a spiritual teacher, or ''starets''.&lt;ref name="Johnson38"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uN2vBZdGXwAC&amp;pg=PA39 Johnson (2010), p. 38.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first partial English and French translations in the 1950s were an indirect result of the [[Bolshevik revolution]], which brought many Russian intellectuals into Western Europe. [[T. S. Eliot]] persuaded his fellow directors of the publishing house [[Faber and Faber]] to publish a partial translation into English from the Theophan Russian version, which met with surprising success in 1951. A more complete English translation, from the original Greek, began in 1979 with a collaboration between [[Gerald Palmer (politician)|G. E. H. Palmer]], [[Kallistos Ware]], and [[Philip Sherrard]]. They released four of the five volumes of the ''Philokalia'' between 1979 and 1995.&lt;ref name="MM"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ware|first=Kallistos|title=The Monastic Magnet: Roads to and from Mount Athos|editor=René Gothóni, Graham Speake|publisher=Peter Lang|date=2008|pages=148–149|isbn=978-3-03911-337-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xKsL6gpDJwEC&amp;pg=PA148}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946, the first installment of a ten volume Romanian translation by Father [[Dumitru Stăniloae]] appeared. In addition to the original Greek text, Stăniloae added "lengthy original footnotes of his own" as well as substantially expanding the coverage of texts by [[Maximus the Confessor]], [[Symeon the New Theologian]], and [[Gregory Palamas]]. This work is 4,650 pages in length.&lt;ref&gt;Binns, John.  ''An Introduction to the Orthodox Christian Churches'' (2002).  Cambridge University Press, pp. 92-93. {{ISBN|0521661404}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writings by the Trappist monk [[Thomas Merton]] on hesychasm also helped spread the popularity of the ''Philokalia'', along with the indirect influence of [[J. D. Salinger]]'s ''[[Franny and Zooey]]'', which featured ''[[The Way of a Pilgrim]]'' as a main plot element.&lt;ref name="Johnson41-42"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uN2vBZdGXwAC&amp;pg=PA41 Johnson (2010), pp. 41-42.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teachings==
The collection's title is '''''The Philokalia of the Niptic Fathers''''',&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8ViqQ6qYSjIC&amp;pg=PA367 Ware (1979) pp. 367-368]&lt;/ref&gt; or more fully ''The Philokalia of the Neptic Saints gathered from our Holy Theophoric Father, through which, by means of the philosophy of ascetic practice and contemplation, the intellect is purified, illumined, and made perfect.''&lt;ref name="Palmer2006" /&gt; ''Niptic'' is an adjective derived from the Greek ''Nipsis'' (or ''[[Nepsis]]'') referring to [[theoria|contemplative prayer]] and meaning "watchfulness". Watchfulness in this context includes close attention to one's thoughts, intentions, and emotions, with the aim of resisting temptations and vain and egoistic thoughts, and trying to maintain a constant state of remembrance of God. There are similarities between this ancient practice and the concept of  [[mindfulness]] as practiced in Buddhism and other spiritual traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dowd|first=E.

''Philokalia'' is defined as the "love of the beautiful, the exalted, the excellent, understood as the transcendent source of life and the revelation of Truth."&lt;ref name="Ware13"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8ViqQ6qYSjIC&amp;pg=PA13 Ware (1979), p. 13.]&lt;/ref&gt; In contemplative prayer the mind becomes absorbed in the awareness of God as a living presence as the source of being of all creatures and sensible forms. According to the authors of the English translation, [[Kallistos Ware]], [[G. E. H. Palmer]], and [[Philip Sherrard]], the writings of the ''Philokalia'' have been chosen above others because they:
&lt;blockquote&gt;...show the way to awaken and develop attention and consciousness, to attain that state of watchfulness which is the hallmark of sanctity. They describe the conditions most effective for learning what their authors call the art of arts and the science of sciences, a learning which is not a matter of information or agility of mind but of a radical change of will and heart leading man towards the highest possibilities open to him, shaping and nourishing the unseen part of his being, and helping him to spiritual fulfilment and [[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|union with God]]."&lt;ref name="Ware13" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Philokalia'' is the foundational text on ''[[hesychasm]]'' ("quietness"), an inner spiritual tradition with a long history dating back to the [[Desert Fathers]].&lt;ref name="Palmer2006" /&gt; The practices include contemplative prayer, quiet sitting, and recitation of the [[Jesus Prayer]]. While traditionally taught and practiced in monasteries, ''hesychasm'' teachings have spread over the years to include laymen.&lt;ref name ="Witte" /&gt; Nikodemos, in his introduction, described the collected texts as "a mystical school of inward prayer" which could be used to cultivate the inner life and to "attain the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ." While the monastic life makes this easier, Nikodemos himself stressed that "unceasing prayer" should be practiced by all.&lt;ref name="Ware14" /&gt;

The hesychasm teachings in the ''Philokalia'' are viewed by Orthodox Christians as inseparable from the sacraments and liturgy of the Orthodox Church, and are given by and for those who are already living within the framework of the Church. A common theme is the need for a spiritual father or guide.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8ViqQ6qYSjIC&amp;pg=PA16 Ware (1979), p. 16].&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Principality of Farghana''' (also spelled ''Ferghana'', ''Fergana'', and ''Fargana''), was a local [[Iranian people|Iranian]] dynasty of [[Sogdia]]n origin, which ruled the [[Fergana Valley|Farghana region]] from an unknown date to 819. The rulers of the region were known by their titles of “''[[ikhshid]]''” and “''[[dehqan]]''”. The capital of the principality was [[Ahsiket|Akhsikath]].

== History ==
The principality of Farghana was under Western Turk rule until it was destroyed by Tang China in 657 and after that under the Anxi Protectorate.  It was invaded by the [[Umayyad]] Arab general [[Qutayba ibn Muslim]] during the [[Muslim conquest of Transoxiana]]. Farghana, along with [[Khujand]], was shortly raided after Qutayba's victory over Gurak. In 715, Qutayba completely subdued Farghana, and made it a vassal state of the Umayyad Caliphate.

During the reign of the Umayyad [[caliph]] [[Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik]], the ikhshid of Farghana revolted against Umayyad authority, but was shortly defeated and killed. He was buried in [[Andijan]]. After the death of Qutayba, Ferghana was taken back by Chinese general Zhang Xiaosong (張孝嵩) in 715 . In cities such as [[Panjikant]] and [[Katta-Kurgan|Pai]], the Sogdians revolted; the most dangerous being the rebellion of 720-722 under [[Divashtich]] and [[Karzanj]], who gained the support of the ikhshid of Ferghana, known as [[at-Tar]] (also spelled Alutar). At-tar promised to give them protection in case their rebellion turned into a failure. While the army of Karzanj was staying at Khujand, at-Tar betrayed him, and told the Umayyad general [[Sa'id ibn Amr al-Harashi]] where Karzanj and his army was stationing. Al-Harashi quickly marched towards Khujand, where he defeated the army of Karzanj, brutally massacring over 3,000 Sogdian inhabitants in the city.{{sfn|Litvinsky|Dani|1984|pp=454-455}} He then marched towards [[Zarafshan, Tajikistan|Zarafshan]], where he defeated and captured Divashtich, who was later executed. Sa'id thus managed to restore Umayyad control over Transoxiana, except Ferghana.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|pp=125–126}}{{sfn|Gibb|1923|pp=61–65}}

In 723, a Umayyad army under [[Muslim ibn Sa'id al-Kilabi]] invaded Ferghana, and devastated the countryside. However, an army under the Turgesh ''[[khagan]]'' [[Suluk (Turgesh khagan)|Suluk]] came to the rescue for their Ferghanian allies, and won a crushing victory over the Arabs in the so-called "[[Day of Thirst]]". In 726, Farghana became divided between two ikhshids, one ruling in the north and as a vassal of the Turgesh. In 729, an ikhshid of Farghana aided the Turgesh during the [[Siege of Kamarja]], and two years later the Turgesh was aided by Ferghana during the [[Battle of the Defile]]. In 739, a Turk named Arslan Tarkhan, conquered Ferghana. However, at the same time Ferghana was invaded by the Umayyad general [[Muhammad ibn Khalid Azdi]].{{sfn|Bosworth|1999}} Nevertheless, the ikhshids of Ferghana are still mentioned in sources. Ferghana was in 740 ravaged by another Umayyad general named [[Nasr ibn Sayyar]]. In 750, the Umayyad Caliphate fell, and was replaced by the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. Farghana joined the Chinese side in the battle of Talas in 751.  Nevertheless, Farghana remained out of Arab control from 715 until late 700s.  In 819, the governor of [[Khurasan]], Ghassan ibn 'Abbad, appointed the [[Samanid]] prince [[Ahmad ibn Asad]] as the ruler of Farghana, thus marking the end of the ancient dynasty which ruled Farghana.{{sfn|Bosworth|1999}}

'''Ramashram [[Satsang]], Mathura''' (RSM) is a [[Spirituality|spiritual]] organization established by [[Guru]] Maharaj (Dr. [[Chaturbhuj Sahay]] Ji) in the northern [[India]]n town of [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]].

Paramsant Dr. Chaturbhuj Sahay Ji established RSM in the year 1930 in Etah in Uttar Pradesh, India, naming it after his Guru, Lala Ji Maharaj, Paramsant Mahatma Shri Ram Chandra Ji. At the behest of his Guru, he openly laid out the secrets of methods of spiritual evolution kept closely guarded by the Saints since time immemorial. The main methodology is transfer of [[Soul]] Power. Breaking away from the centuries-old norm, He openly propagated the teachings of his Guru to all, and these methods and principles are applicable to and adaptable by people of any and all religions. Love is the objective of all Spiritual Methods. In this school 'Love' is mingled in all its methods. The central focus is on the Spiritual Master, who is looked upon as a father/ mother figure by all and who by Soul -Power uplifts the aspirants and makes them experience the higher stages of spirituality without aspirants having to make effort for it on their own. Periodic dosage of this transfer of power brings about an altered state within an aspirant. The mind has to be centered before higher states can be experienced; therefore, this school has evolved its own system of meditation, designed not only to bring the aspirants up to the level of receiving and experiencing the Soul Power (the goal of spiritual evolution and the main objective of every religion) but also to make the higher states flow automatically one after the other and even thereafter to keep the aspirant on track.

This is probably the only school of its kind, where the method of transfer of Soul Power has evolved to such an extent that power is transferred not only on one to one basis but from one to many. At the tri-monthly meets known as 'Bhandara', organized by this Satsang, thousands of aspirants receive this power at the same time. Overtly, all are seen only to practice meditation, but each one notices and experiences the altered state upon leaving the Bhandara.

This system of [[Sadhana]]/[[Satsang]] is a synthesis between action [[Karma]] (duty), [[Upasana]] (devotion) and Gyan (knowledge). Aspirants are required to keep in touch with the Master and to meet with the Master at the least once in every three months and to do [[Dhyana in Hinduism|Dhyan]] ([[Meditation|meditate]]) every morning and evening for 15–20 minutes when not in company of the Master till they achieve the desired goal.

Ramashram Satsang Mathura publishes a Monthly Spiritual Magazine in Hindi, called "Sadhan"
Authentic and Official literature about the teachings and messages of Ramashram Satsang is published by Sadhan Press, Dampier Nagar, Mathura

== History ==
The journey began back in around 1873, the year when Param Sant Mahatma  Sri Ramchandra Ji Maharaj  was born in the north Indian province of Manipuri.

[[Latter Day Saints]] teach that the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] began with a '''revelation''' from God. They also teach that [[revelation]] is the foundation of the church established by [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]] [[Christ (title)|Christ]] and that it remains an essential element of his true church today. [[Continuous revelation]] provides individual Latter Day Saints with a "[[Testimony#Religion|testimony]]", described by [[Richard Bushman]] as "one of the most potent words in the Mormon lexicon."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bushman, Richard L. |title=Mormonism: a very short introduction |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=2008 |pages=27 |isbn=0-19-531030-6 |doi=10.1093/actrade/9780195310306.003.0002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to an inquiry on the beliefs of the church, [[Joseph Smith]] wrote what came to be called the [[Wentworth Letter]], the last section of which was canonized as the [[Articles of Faith (Latter Day Saints)|Articles of Faith]]. The fifth, sixth, seventh and ninth articles state the essence of Latter Day Saint belief concerning revelation.

: 5 We believe that a man must be called of God, by prophecy, and by the laying on of hands by those who are in authority, to preach the Gospel and administer in the ordinances thereof.
: 6 We believe in the same organization that existed in the Primitive Church, namely, apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, evangelists, and so forth.
: 7 We believe in the gift of tongues, prophecy, revelation, visions, healing, interpretation of tongues, and so forth.
: 9 We believe all that God has revealed, all that He does now reveal, and we believe that He will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God.

Latter Day Saints believe that the Lord ‘will yet reveal many great and important things’ to His church through modern [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|Apostles]] and [[Prophet, seer, and revelator|Prophets]]; that all leaders of the church are ‘called of God, by prophecy’; and that each member of the church can receive personal revelation to strengthen their faith and guide them in their own lives.

==Doctrine==
{{See also|History of the Latter Day Saint movement}}
The Latter Day Saint concept of revelation includes the belief that revelation from God is available to all those who earnestly seek it with the intent of doing good.

[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] and some other [[Latter Day Saint|Latter Day Saint denominations]] claim to be led by revelation from God to a [[Prophet, seer, and revelator|living prophet]], who receives God’s word just as [[Abraham]], [[Moses]], [[Saint Peter|Peter]], and other ancient prophets and [[Twelve apostles|apostles]] did.  It also teaches that everyone is entitled to ''personal'' revelation with respect to his or her [[stewardship]].  Thus, parents can receive inspiration from God in raising their families, individuals can receive divine inspiration to help them meet personal challenges, church officers may receive revelation for those whom they serve, and Apostles and Prophets may receive revelation for the entire church.  The important consequence of this is that each person may receive confirmation that particular doctrines taught by a prophet are true, as well as gain divine insight in using those truths for their own benefit and eternal progress.  In the LDS Church, personal revelation is expected and encouraged, and many converts believe that personal revelation from God was instrumental in their conversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Continuing Revelation | work=Mormon.org | url=http://www.mormon.org/learn/0,8672,1084-1,00.html | accessdate=August 5, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph F. Smith]], the sixth [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|president]] and [[Prophet, seer, and revelator|Prophet]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS Church]], summarized the church's belief concerning revelation by saying, "We believe... in the principle of direct revelation from God to man."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author =Smith, Joseph F.| authorlink =| coauthors =| year =| month =| title =Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph F. Smith| chapter =41: Continuing Revelation for the Benefit of the Church| editor =| others =| edition =| pages =362| publisher =The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints| location =Salt Lake City, UT| id =| url =http://library.lds.org/nxt/gateway.dll?f=id$id=tchg-pix.nfo%3Ar%3A84ab$cid=tchg-pix.nfo$t=document-frame.htm$an=JD_35744ttl$3.0#JD_35744ttl| archive-url =https://archive.is/20100616090225/http://library.lds.org/nxt/gateway.dll?f=id$id=tchg-pix.nfo:r:84ab$cid=tchg-pix.nfo$t=document-frame.htm$an=JD_35744ttl$3.0%23JD_35744ttl#JD_35744ttl| dead-url =yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also more specifically detailed the importance of the principle of modern-day revelation to the church he then led;
{{quote|"The gospel cannot be administered, nor the Church of God continue to exist, without it. Christ is the head of his Church and not man, and the connection can only be maintained upon the principle of direct and continued revelation. It… is a living, vital principle to be enjoyed on certain conditions only, namely – through absolute faith in God and obedience to his laws and commandments. The moment this principle is cut off, that moment the Church is adrift, being severed from its ever-living head. In this condition it cannot continue, but must cease to be the Church of God and, like the ship at sea without captain, compass or rudder, is afloat at the mercy of the storms and the waves of ever contending human passions, and worldly interests, pride and folly..." (Smith, 362)}}

[[James E. Talmage]], a member of the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]] and noted LDS scholar, attempted to connect this belief with the nature of God and also emphasized the importance of the principle of continuing revelation to his faith:
{{quote|"It is at once unreasonable, and directly contrary to our conception of the unchangeable justice of God, to believe that He will bless the Church in one dispensation with present living revelation of His will and in another leave [His] Church... to live as best it may according to the laws of a bygone age."}}

Latter Day Saints believe that God answers [[prayer]]s. Communicating with God is seen by many Latter Day Saints as an important part of developing faith and coming to know God, resulting ultimately in [[Exaltation (Mormonism)|exaltation]] if the person remains faithful to covenants with Jesus Christ.

===Apostolic revelation===
[[Latter Day Saints]] believe that the need for guidance by Apostolic Revelation in Jesus Christ’s church is as great today as it was when [[Saint Peter|Peter]], [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]], and other [[Twelve apostles|apostles]] wrote the letters that eventually became the [[New Testament]].
{{quote|"Surely the Lord G&lt;SMALL&gt;&lt;!--DO NOT USE (SPAN STYLE="font-size:80%") IT CURRENTLY BREAKS INCLUDING TEMPLATES SUCH AS {Quotation}--&gt;OD&lt;/SMALL&gt; will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets."&lt;ref&gt;Amos 3:7&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[James E. Faust]], then a member of the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]], spoke on the need for continual divine guidance of Jesus Christ’s church in both doctrinal and administrative matters:
{{quote|"Much revelation received, in this time as well as anciently, has been doctrinal. Some of it has been operational and tactical. Much of it is not spectacular. President John Taylor reminds us:

'Adam’s revelation did not instruct Noah to build his ark; nor did Noah’s revelation tell Lot to forsake Sodom; nor did either of these speak of the departure of the children of Israel from Egypt. These all had revelations for themselves.'&lt;ref&gt;''[[Millennial Star]]'', 1  November 1847, p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt;

In our time God has revealed how to administer the Church with a membership of over six million differently than when there were just six members of the Church. These differences include the use of modern technology, such as films, computers, and satellite broadcasts, to teach and communicate new ways to conduct missionary work in various nations; the location and building of temples; and many others."&lt;ref name="James E. Faust 1989"&gt;James E. Faust, “Continuous Revelation,” Ensign, November 1989, 8&lt;/ref&gt;}}

LDS Church [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|president]] [[Gordon B. Hinckley]] further explained:
{{quote|"A growing church, a church that is spreading across the earth in these complex times, needs constant revelation from the throne of heaven to guide it and move it forward.

With prayer and anxious seeking of the will of the Lord, we testify that direction is received, that revelation comes, and that the Lord blesses His Church as it moves on its path of destiny.

On the solid foundation of the Prophet Joseph’s divine calling and the revelations of God, which came through him, we go forward. Much has been accomplished in bringing us to this present day. But there is much more to be done in the process of taking this restored gospel to “every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people”."&lt;ref&gt;Rev. 14:6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gordon B. Hinckley, “The Great Things Which God Has Revealed,” Ensign, May 2005, 80&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Inspired vs. infallible ===
The LDS Church believes apostolic revelation to be [[Biblical inspiration|inspired]], but not [[infallible]].  One leader wrote, "We consider God, and him alone, infallible; therefore his revealed word to us cannot be doubted, though we may be in doubt some times about the knowledge which we obtain from human sources, and occasionally be obliged to admit that something which we had considered to be a fact, was really only a theory."&lt;ref&gt;[[Lu Dalton]], ''[[Woman's Exponent]]'' (Salt Lake City: 15 July 1882), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;  Leaders are still considered regular people with "their opinions and prejudices and are left to work out their own problems without inspiration in many instances."&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce R. McConkie]], ''[[Mormon Doctrine]]'', 2nd edition, (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1966), 608&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Brigham Young]] taught "the greatest fear I have is that the people of this Church will accept what we say as the will of the Lord without first praying about it and getting the witness within their own hearts that what we say is the word of the Lord."&lt;ref&gt;Harold B. Lee, Stand Ye In Holy Places, pp. 162-3, "The Prophet, Seer, and Revelator," Address delivered to seminary and institute teachers, BYU, July 8, 1964&lt;/ref&gt;  Members are taught to rely on the [[Holy Ghost]] to judge,&lt;ref&gt;"here may be some things that the First Presidency do; that the Apostles do, that cannot for the moment be explained; yet the spirit, the motives that inspire the action can be understood, because each member of the Church has a right to have that measure of the Spirit of God that they can judge as to those who are acting in their interests or otherwise" Lorenzo Snow, Conference Report (October 1898): 54&lt;/ref&gt; and if a revelation is in harmony with the revealed word of God, it should be accepted.&lt;ref&gt;You cannot accept the books written by the authorities of the Church as standards of doctrine, only in so far as they accord with the revealed word in the standard works. Every man who writes is responsible, not the Church, for what he writes. If Joseph Fielding Smith writes something which is out of harmony with the revelations, then every member of the Church is duty bound to reject it. If he writes that which is in perfect harmony with the revealed word of the Lord, then it should be accepted. ([[Joseph Fielding Smith]], ''[[Doctrines of Salvation]]'', comp. Bruce R. McConkie, 3 vols., (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1954–56), 3:203–204. {{ISBN|0-88494-041-1}})&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dallin H. Oaks]] explains: "Revelations from God . . . are not constant. We believe in [[continuing revelation]], not continuous revelation. We are often left to work out problems without the dictation or specific direction of the Spirit."&lt;ref&gt;Dallin H. Oaks, [http://library.lds.org/nxt/gateway.dll/Magazines/Ensign/1997.htm/ensign%20march%201997.htm/teaching%20and%20learning%20by%20the%20spirit.htm "Teaching and Learning by the Spirit,"] ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'' (March 1997): 14.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus the current prophet can clarify, correct or change any previous teachings.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ezra Taft Benson]], [http://speeches.byu.edu/reader/reader.php?id=6751 "Fourteen Fundamentals in Following the Prophet"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080202144620/http://speeches.byu.edu/reader/reader.php?id=6751 |date=2008-02-02 }}, 1980-02-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, once a doctrine has been accepted by the church by [[common consent (Mormonism)|"common consent"]], it becomes part of the [[Standard Works]], and then takes precedence over any other revelation.&lt;ref&gt;And if he says something that contradicts what is found in the standard works (I think that is why we call them "standard"—it is the standard measure of all that men teach), you may know by that same token that it is false; regardless of the position of the man who says it. ([[Harold B. Lee]], "The Place of the Living Prophet, Seer, and Revelator," Address to Seminary and Institute of Religion Faculty, BYU, 8 July 1964)&lt;/ref&gt;  Members of the LDS church only consider themselves bound by doctrine found in the Standard Works.&lt;ref&gt;The Church has confined the sources of doctrine by which it is willing to be bound before the world to the things that God has revealed, and which the Church has officially accepted, and those alone. These would include the Bible, the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, the Pearl of Great Price.  (Brigham H. Roberts, sermon of 10 July 1921, delivered in Salt Lake Tabernacle, printed in ''[[Deseret News]]'' (23 July 1921) sec. 4:7)&lt;/ref&gt; Also, though it is not considered scripture, Latter-day Saints also believe the [[United States Constitution]] to be a divinely inspired document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lds.org/ensign/1992/02/the-divinely-inspired-constitution?lang=eng |title=The Divinely Inspired Constitution |author=Dallin H. Oaks |date=Feb 1992 |publisher=''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''See'' D&amp;C 101:76–80&lt;/ref&gt;

===Called of God, by prophecy===
Latter Day Saints believe that all who serve in any position in the church, from [[Apostle (Mormonism)|Apostles]] who lead the entire church to twelve-year-old [[Deacon (Mormonism)|Deacons]] who pass the [[Sacrament (Latter Day Saints)|sacrament]], must be "called of God, by prophecy, and by the laying on of hands by those who are in authority".&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Articles of Faith|a-of-f|1|5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This requirement applies to both hierarchical [[Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|priesthood]] leadership callings (such as [[Bishop (Mormonism)|bishop]]), as well as other priesthood and non-priesthood callings (such as [[Sunday School (Mormonism)|Sunday school]] instructor, organist, etc.).

{{quote|"And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon him: and the children of Israel hearkened unto him, and did as the L&lt;SMALL&gt;ORD&lt;/SMALL&gt; commanded Moses."&lt;ref&gt;Deuteronomy 34:9&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|"And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues."&lt;ref&gt;1 Corinthians 12:28&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Henry B. Eyring]], then a member of the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]], gave the following counsel to those called to serve.  This counsel illustrates many key LDS beliefs concerning those "called of God, by prophecy",
{{quote|"And so, to everyone, man or woman, girl or boy, who has been called or who will yet be, I give you my counsel.

First, you are called of God. The Lord knows you. He knows whom He would have serve in every position in His Church. He chose you. He has prepared a way so that He could issue your call. He restored the keys of the priesthood to Joseph Smith. Those keys have been passed down in an unbroken line to President Hinckley. Through those keys, other priesthood servants were given keys to preside in stakes and wards, in districts and branches. It was through those keys that the Lord called you.

Your call is an example of a source of power unique to the Lord’s Church. Men and women are called of God by prophecy and by the laying on of hands by those God has authorized.

You are called to represent the Savior. Your voice to testify becomes the same as His voice, your hands to lift the same as His hands.

You see, there are no small callings to represent the Lord. Your call carries grave responsibility. But you need not fear, because with your call come great promises.

One of those promises is the second thing you need to know. It is that the Lord will guide you by revelation just as He called you. You must ask in faith for revelation to know what you are to do. With your call comes the promise that answers will come.

There is a third thing you need to know: Just as God called you and will guide you, He will magnify you. You will need that magnification. Your calling will surely bring opposition. The Apostle Paul described it this way: “For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world.”&lt;ref&gt;Ephesians 6:12&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the ways you will be attacked is with the feeling that you are inadequate. Well, you are inadequate to answer a call to represent God with only your own powers. But you have access to more than your natural capacities, and you do not work alone.

The Lord will magnify what you say and what you do in the eyes of the people you serve. He will send the Holy Ghost to manifest to them that what you spoke was true. What you say and do will carry hope and give direction to people far beyond your natural abilities and your own understanding. That miracle has been a mark of the Lord’s Church in every dispensation."&lt;ref&gt;Henry B. Eyring, “Rise to Your Call,” Ensign, November 2002, 75&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Personal revelation===
{{Anchor|Personal revelation}}
While teaching the importance of studying the words of both ancient and modern prophets, Latter Day Saints also emphasize the necessity of personal [[Continuous revelation|revelation]] from God by the power of the [[Holy Ghost]] as the only pathway to true knowledge of Jesus Christ:

{{quote|"But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you."&lt;ref&gt;John 14:26&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|"He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven."&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 16:15-17&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Boyd K. Packer]], then a member of the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]], explained the source and process of personal revelation:
{{quote|"Following baptism, one is confirmed a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in a brief ordinance, during which there is conferred the gift of the Holy Ghost. Thereafter, all through life, men, women, even little children receive the right to inspired direction to guide them in their lives—personal revelation! (See Alma 32:23.)

The Holy Ghost communicates with the spirit through the mind more than through the physical senses. This guidance comes as thoughts, as feelings, through impressions and promptings. It is not always easy to describe inspiration. The scriptures teach us that we may “feel” the words of spiritual communication more than hear them, and see with spiritual rather than with mortal eyes. [See 1 Ne. 17:45.]

The patterns of revelation are not dramatic. The voice of inspiration is a still voice, a small voice. There need be no trance, no sanctimonious declaration. It is quieter and simpler than that."&lt;ref&gt;Boyd K. Packer, “Revelation in a Changing World,” Ensign, November 1989,  14&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In another talk, Packer warned Latter Day Saints against the dangers of over reliance on a rational or [[Theology|theological]] approach to knowledge of gospel principles:
{{quote|"The witness is not communicated through the intellect alone, however bright the intellect may be.

'The natural man,' Paul told us, 'receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.' (1 Cor. 2:13–14.)

Recently the Council of the First Presidency and Quorum of Twelve Apostles issued a statement alerting members of the Church to the dangers of participating in circles which concentrate on doctrine and ordinances and measure them by the intellect alone.

If doctrines and behavior are measured by the intellect alone, the essential spiritual ingredient is missing, and we will be misled.

Personal testimony is confirmed to us initially and is reaffirmed and enlarged thereafter through a harmonious combining of both the intellect and the spirit."&lt;ref&gt;Boyd K. Packer, “Reverence Invites Revelation,” Ensign, November 1991,  21&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Past LDS Church President and Prophet [[Spencer W. Kimball]] also emphasized the importance of personal revelation versus the analytical approach in understanding the message of Jesus Christ:
{{quote|"It should also be kept in mind that God cannot be found through research alone, nor his gospel understood and appreciated by study only, for no one may know the Father or the Son but 'he to whom the Son will reveal him'.&lt;ref&gt;Luke 10:22&lt;/ref&gt; The skeptic will some day either in time or eternity learn to his sorrow that his egotism has robbed him of much joy and growth, and that as has been decreed by the Lord: The things of God cannot be understood by the spirit of man; that man cannot by himself find out God or his program; that no amount of scientific or philosophical research nor rationalizing will bring a testimony, but it must come through the heart when compliance with the program has made the person eligible to receive that reward."&lt;ref&gt;Spencer W. Kimball, “President Kimball Speaks Out on Testimony,” New Era, August 1981, 4&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although Latter Day Saints believe that personal revelation is an essential part of the [[Plan of Salvation (Latter Day Saints)|Plan of Salvation]], leaders of the church emphasize that true personal revelation should never contradict official revelation from the leadership of the church. [[Hartman Rector Jr.]] taught some basic criteria during a speech at [[BYU]] entitled "How to Know if Revelation Is from the Lord" that can help members of the church know whether the revelation that someone receives is actually coming from God. The following excerpt is the conclusion of this speech.

{{quote|"Just by way of review, here is how to know if an idea is from God:
One, is it within the bounds and limitations of your calling, and does it require a service consistent with your calling?

Two, is it consistent with the revealed word of God? The scriptures and the directions of the living prophet of God today--those are the revealed words of God.

Three, is the receiver of the communication a fit receptacle? Is he in condition to receive such a communication from the Lord?

Four, does the communication edify and cause you to rejoice?

Five, does it cause your bosom to burn or speak peace to your soul, or are you left troubled by the communication?

Six, is the communication vivid to the understanding, or does it leave a cloud or a hazy impression?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Rector| first = Hartman Jr. | title = How to Know if Revelation Is from the Lord | work = BYU Speeches| publisher = BYU| date = 1976-01-06| url = https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/hartman-rector-jr_know-revelation-lord/| accessdate = 2015-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[James E. Faust]], then a member of the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]], explained the difference between Apostolic and personal revelation, "The prophets, seers, and revelators have had and still have the responsibility and privilege of receiving and declaring the word of God for the world. Individual members, parents, and leaders have the right to receive revelation for their own responsibility but have no duty nor right to declare the word of God beyond the limits of their own responsibility."&lt;ref name="James E. Faust 1989"/&gt;

===Spirit of prophecy===
The concept of the "Spirit of Prophecy" as found in the LDS church was first described by Joseph Smith, who believed that each individual person was capable of receiving revelation for themselves and those they presided over in their group or family. This enables Latter Day Saints to understand to what extent they are in harmony with the mind and the will of God. The term "personal revelation" is also common parlance.

Two Biblical scriptures that are often used to remind LDS adherents of the importance of seeking personal revelation are [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 19:10, which concludes ": worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy" and [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 11:29, which concludes: "would God that all the Lord's people were prophets, and that the Lord would put his spirit upon them!"  Thus, the spirit of prophecy is understood to be an important gift of the Spirit that is available through adherence to true worship of God, obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel, study of the scriptures, following leaders who have been called by revelation, and understanding the guidance offered by the gift of the [[Holy Spirit|Holy Ghost]]. (See Doctrine and Covenants Sections 8 and 9).

==Practice==
Each Latter-day Saint is expected to use personal revelation to determine how best to apply gospel principles and the commandments in his or her life in a path toward perfection.  It is accepted that not all members will agree on how to interpret the same scripture; rather, each person is responsible to determine how it should be interpreted for himself or herself.

For example, the dietary code called the [[Word of Wisdom]] contains the statement "And again, hot drinks are not for the body or belly."&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;C 89:9&lt;/ref&gt;  Church leaders later clarified the words "hot drinks" to mean [[coffee]] and [[tea]].  The Word of Wisdom is interpreted in various ways within the church.  Although abstinence from coffee, tea, [[Alcoholic beverages|alcohol]] and [[tobacco]] are considered 'absolutes' by most Latter-day Saints, many will drink [[Decaffeination|decaffeinated]] coffee or [[herbal tea]].  A few LDS will even avoid [[Coca-Cola]], [[Pepsi]], and other drinks containing [[caffeine]], but most LDS see nothing wrong with drinking such beverages. Mormons interpret the other parts of the Word of Wisdom relating to the kinds of foods to be eaten and avoided in various ways.  It is considered inappropriate for one person to challenge another person's interpretation, although priesthood leaders such as [[Bishop (Latter Day Saints)|bishops]] may determine when an interpretation is outside acceptable bounds. Rationalization of interpretations is tempered by the belief that each person must answer for their choices at the [[Last Judgment|final judgment]].

Individuals are encouraged to rely on personal revelation and to never take leader's statements at face value without investigating for themselves if they be true. [[Brigham Young]] said,
{{quote|"I am more afraid that this people have so much confidence in their leaders that they will not inquire for themselves of God whether they are led by him. I am fearful that they settle down in a state of blind self security, trusting their eternal destiny in the hands of their leaders with a reckless confidence that in itself would thwart the purpose of God in their salvation. . . Let every man and woman know, by the whispering of the Spirit of God to themselves, whether their leaders are walking in the path the Lord dictates, or not."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/u?/JournalOfDiscourses3,3762|title=Eternal Punishment - "Mormonism," &amp;c.|author=Brigham Young|accessdate=2009-01-31}} [[Journal of Discourses]] 9:150&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[J. Reuben Clark]] wrote that there is only one way that Church members can be sure that leaders are speaking for the Lord,
{{quote|"I have given some thought to this question, and the answer thereto so far as I can determine, is: We can tell when the speakers are ‘moved upon by the Holy Ghost’ only when we, ourselves, are ‘moved upon by the Holy Ghost.’ In a way, this completely shifts the responsibility from them to us to determine when they so speak."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=J. Reuben Clark|url=http://emp.byui.edu/marrottr/ClarkWhenAreWritings.pdf|title=When Are the Writings and Sermons of Church Leaders Entitled to the Claim of Scripture?|publisher=BYU|date=7 July 1954}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

An important revelation presented to the LDS Church by the president of the church is the revelation announcing a [[Perpetual Education Fund]] for fostering educational opportunities among the poor.

==Future scripture==
Many Latter-day Saints believe that new scripture will be revealed or discovered and translated involving prophets among the [[Ten Lost Tribes]] at some time before or during the [[Millennialism|Millennium]] ([[Book of Mormon]], {{lds|2 Nephi|2-ne|29|13}}).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7307">'''[[Spirituality|Spiritual]] opportunism''' refers to the exploitation of spiritual ideas (or of the spirituality of others, or of spiritual [[authority]]): for personal gain, partisan interests or selfish motives. Usually the implication is that doing so is unprincipled in some way, although it may cause no harm and involve no abuse. In other words, religion becomes a means to achieve something that is alien to it, or things are projected into religion that do not belong there. 

Any human being has at least some kind of spiritual sense, developed through personal reflection or undeveloped but evident from lifestyle and communications, which defines the meta-meanings of human existence, the purpose of life, the meaning of the universe and one's own place in it, and so on. This belief system may, or may not be expressed through the categories and concepts of a religion; it could be only assumed, rather than explicit. Whatever the case, such beliefs can be used in a way that they become a source of profit.

If a religious authority acquires influence over the "hearts and minds" of people who are believers in a religion, and therefore can "tap into" the most intimate and deepest-felt concerns of believers, it can also gain immense power from that. This power can be used in a self-interested manner, exploiting opportunities to benefit the position of the religious authority or its supporters in society. This could be considered as inconsistent with the real intentions of the religious belief, or it might show lack of respect for the spiritual autonomy of others. The "good faith" of people is then taken advantage of, in ways that involve some kind of deceit, or some dubious, selfish motive. 

Even although, in his ''Treatise on Toleration'' (1763), the famous French liberal philosopher [[Voltaire]] expressed a distaste for [[religious fanaticism]], he was at the same time convinced that religion could be a useful tool to keep the masses under control. He said famously, "If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him." In his ''[[Épître à l'Auteur du Livre des Trois Imposteurs]]'', a criticism of atheism in which he makes this remark, Voltaire opined that faith in God is a "sublime system" that is "necessary to man": it is, "...the sacred tie that binds society." Similar ideas have been expressed by numerous political leaders, business leaders, and intellectuals for centuries, both right-wing and left-wing. In their utopias of social engineering, early socialistic thinkers such as [[Auguste Comte]] (''Treatise on Sociology Instituting the Religion of Humanity'' 1851-54) and [[Henri de Saint-Simon]] (''New Christianity'' 1825) envisaged a new secular (or "scientific") belief-system, analogous to a religion, which would unite the people humanely, and ensure social cohesion.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Furedi, "Glaube: Wie aus dem Atheismus eine Pseudo-Religion wurde". ''NovoArgumente'', 18 April 2012.[http://www.frankfuredi.com/index.php/site/article/548/]&lt;/ref&gt; This idea is not as unrealistic as it sounds,&lt;ref&gt;Yasmin Anwar, "Highly religious people are less motivated by compassion than are non-believers". ''UC Berkeley News Center'', April 30, 2012.[http://newscenter.berkeley.edu/2012/04/30/religionandgenerosity/]&lt;/ref&gt; but it could be interpreted as an opportunist use of people's faith for political purposes. 

Politicians around the world recognize the power of religion, and therefore they usually try to keep on the good side of religious authorities and believers.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see: Subir Bhaumik, "China and India use Buddha for regional karma". ''Al Jazeera English (online)'', 11 January 2012.[http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/01/2013171148400871.html]&lt;/ref&gt; They are very aware, that religion can be not just a force for social stability, but can also be the cause of enormous animosity among the peoples, if spiritual sensitivities are offended. For example, when in February 2012 protests broke out in various parts of Afghanistan over the improper disposal of Korans at the US military Bagram Air Base, the US government apologized officially (see [[2012 Afghanistan Quran burning protests]]). Some [[religious wars]] and [[crusades]] have lasted a very long time, being pursued quite relentlessly - regardless of the number of casualties, and regardless of who happened to be winning. It creates plenty potential to exploit religious likes and dislikes opportunistically, to advance political, social or business interests.

The term spiritual opportunism is also used in the sense of casting around for suitable spiritual beliefs  borrowed and cobbled together in some way to justify, condemn or "make sense of" particular ways of behaving, usually with some partisan or ulterior motive. This may not be abusive, but it often gives rise to criticisms or accusations&lt;ref&gt;An example is Robert M. Price, ''Top Secret: The Truth Behind Today’s Pop Mysticisms''. Prometheus Books, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; that the given spiritual beliefs:

*are not an organic, sincere or authentic expression of the real nature of the people who contrived them.
*do not really express what people's lives are about, but are in some way an "artificial add-on".
*lack any deeper principled foundation, and are more an "eclectic, self-serving concoction"
*are made to serve partisan interests, contrary to the real intention of the beliefs.

Supporters of traditional religions such as [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Hinduism]] or [[Buddhism]] sometimes complain that people (such as [[New Age]] enthusiasts) seek out spiritual beliefs ''that serve only themselves'', as a form of "spiritual opportunism". Such complaints are often highly controversial, because people are considered to have the right to their own spiritual beliefs (they may not have that right, to the extent that they are socially excluded unless they profess certain spiritual beliefs, but they may only subscribe "formally" or "outwardly" to them). 

Because spiritual beliefs are a highly personal matter in the first instance and concern personal meanings, they are often difficult to criticize because "they just are what they are". As they concern highly abstract, metaphysical principles, it is difficult to prove their inconsistency, even using the criterion of whether people "act according to their beliefs". People can always argue that the personal meaning they attach to something or the personal associations they make, ''cannot'' be adequately expressed in the language of others. If accusations of spiritual opportunism are made, therefore, evidential proof depends greatly on what people are willing to reveal (or "confess") about themselves in what they say and do.

Spiritual opportunism sometimes refers also to the practice of [[proselytizing]] one's spiritual beliefs when any opportunity to do so arises, for the purpose of winning over, or persuading others, about the superiority of these beliefs. In this context, the spiritual opportunist may engage in various actions, themselves not directly related to the spiritual beliefs, with the specific aim of convincing others of the superiority of his own belief system – it may effectively amount to "buying their support".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4340">[[File:AgoraAthens5thcentury.png|thumb|Plan showing the major buildings of the Agora. The Stoa Poikile is number 20]]

The '''Stoa Poikile''' ([[Ancient Greek]]: ἡ ποικίλη στοά) or '''Painted Porch''', originally called the '''Porch of Peisianax''' (Ancient Greek: ἡ Πεισιανάκτειος στοά), was erected during the 5th century BC and was located on the north side of the [[Ancient Agora of Athens]]. The Stoa Poikile was one of the most famous sites in ancient Athens, owing its fame to the paintings and loot from wars displayed in it.  The [[Stoa]] was the location from which [[Zeno of Citium]] taught [[Stoicism]]. The philosophical school of Stoicism takes its name from having first been expounded here, and was derived from the Greek word ''stoa''. Zeno taught and lectured to his followers from this porch.  Excavations carried out by the American School of Classical Studies at Athens over the past two decades have revealed much of the foundations and some lower elements of the stoa on the north side of the Athenian Agora; it had a Doric columnar facade and an Ionic interior colonnade.&lt;ref&gt;Lucy Shoe Meritt,  The Stoa Poikile. Hesperia. The Journal of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, Vol. 39, No. 4(Oct. - Dec., 1970), pp. 233-264.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stoa Poikile was decorated by fresco painter and sculptor [[Micon|Micon of Athens]] in collaboration with [[Polygnotus|Polygnotos of Thasos]]; both artists worked around the mid-5th century BC. The paintings were most probably hung on the inner wall of the stoa. In the time of [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] (2nd century AD), the paintings in the Stoa included:
* The [[Battle of Oenoe]]&lt;ref&gt;E. D. Francis and Michael Vickers, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/30102822 Oenoe Painting in the Stoa Poikile, and Herodotus' Account of Marathon]. The Annual of the British School at Athens Vol. 80, (1985), pp. 99-113&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In 460 BC, Argos rises against Sparta. Athens supports Argos and Thessaly. The small force that is sent by Sparta to quell the uprising in Argos is defeated by a joint Athenian and Argos force at Oenoe.&lt;/ref&gt; (author unknown)
* [[Amazonomachy]] by [[Micon]]
* The taking of [[Troy]] by [[Polygnotus]]
* The [[Battle of Marathon]] by [[Panaenus]] (also ascribed to Micon and Polygnotus who may have assisted in the work)&lt;ref&gt;Francesco de Angelis, “La battaglia di Maratona nella Stoa poikile,” ''ASNP'' 1996 Ser. 4a 1 (1) 119-71.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a contrast between the mythical and historical events portrayed: depictions of Theseus' victory over the Amazonians and the [[Fall of Troy]] are juxtaposed sharply with the portrayal of the historic Battle of Oenoe (conjectured to have occurred in the [[pentecontaetia]] at [[Oenoe, Attica]] on the [[Thriasian Plain]] near [[Eleutherae]]), the first important Athenian victory over [[Sparta]], and the [[Battle of Marathon]]. The Battle of Marathon features most predominantly and as such, displays the confidence and identity of the Athenians in the wake of the [[Persian Wars]], particularly when compared to the two great mythical victories identified above.&lt;!--?not sure what the point is, confusing--&gt;

The Stoa Poikile stood in good repair for over six centuries, possibly gaining additional artwork over the centuries.  It suffered when Athens was sacked in 267 AD by [[Heruli]]ans, although only easily looted items were taken at that time.  The paintings were removed by a Roman governor shortly before 396 AD.&lt;ref name="Synesius 54|url=http://www.livius.org/su-sz/synesius/synesius_letter_054.html|author=Synesius|year=396 CE"&gt;[http://www.livius.org/su-sz/synesius/synesius_letter_054.html Synesius, Letter 54]&lt;/ref&gt; The Stoa itself probably existed for another 50–100 years until it was demolished to gain building material for a city wall.

The '''Thathanabaing of Burma''' ({{lang-my|သာသနာပိုင်}}, also spelt '''Thathanapaing''') served as the head of the Buddhist [[Sangha]] (order of monks) in pre-colonial [[Burma]], until its abolishment in 1938 by the [[British rule in Burma|British authorities in colonial Burma]]. The Thathanapaing was responsible for managing the monastic hierarchy and education at monasteries. The Thathanabaing resided in a royal monastery near the kingdom's capital.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.siamese-heritage.org/jsspdf/1981/JSS_072_0i_AyeKaw_SanghaOrganizationIn19thCenturyBurmaAndThailand.pdf|title=The Sangha Organization in Nineteenth Century Burma and Thailand|last=Kyaw|first=Aye|date=1984|website=Journal of the Siam Society|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, appointees were usually commoners born in the villages, with no blood relationship with the royal house.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Their appointments were made on the basis of their mastery of Buddhist knowledge and literature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Etymology==
''Thathanabaing'', literally 'Keeper of the [[Sasana|Sāsana]]', is the native [[Burmese language|Burmese]] rendition of [[Sangharaja]], or formally ''Mahasangharaja'' ({{my|မဟာသံဃာရာဇာ}}), which is typically rendered into English as 'Primate', 'Archbishop' or 'Supreme Patriarch.'{{sfn|Twomey|1904}} The term "Sangharaja" was popularly used from the 1300s to 1400s, but lost currency in subsequent centuries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By the Konbaung dynasty, Thathanabaing and Thathanapyu (သာသနာပြု) were frequently used.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==History==
According to [[Burmese chronicles]], the office of the Thathanabaing dates to the reign of [[Swa Saw Ke]] (1367-1400).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Sangha and State in Burma: A Study of Monastic Sectarianism and Leadership|last=Mendelson|first=E. Michael|date=1975|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=|isbn=9780801408755|location=|pages=|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; British historians recognize a lineage of primates during the [[Pagan Kingdom]], beginning with the monk [[Shin Arahan]].&lt;ref name="james"&gt;{{cite book|title=Governance and civil society in Myanmar: education, health, and environment|last=James|first=Helen|date=2005|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-35558-2|pages=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Konbaung dynasty===
{{double image|right|Thudhamma Zayat.jpg|160|Pahtan Zayat.jpg|160|The election of the Thathanapaing in 1902 was held at the  Thudhamma and Pahtan [[Zayat]]s near [[Mandalay Hill]].}}

The office, in its last incarnation, was established by King [[Bodawpaya]] in 1784, after the constitution of the Sudhamma Council, a council of four elder monks (''thera''), of which the Thathanabaing was its head.{{sfn|James|2005|p=81-84}} Subsequent monarchs expanded the Council, which varied from 8 to 12 members called ''sadaw''.{{sfn|James|2005|p=81-84}}{{sfn|Scott|1900|p=3}} Council members were appointed by the king and styled ''Dazeitya Sayadaw'' ({{my|တံဆိပ်ရဆရာတော်}}, 'Teachers Possessing the Seal').{{sfn|Scott|1900|p=3}}

The Thathanabaing was appointed by the king and granted supreme authority with regard to religious doctrine and ecclesiastical administration.{{sfn|Scott|1900|p=3}} The Thathanapaing was responsible for the kingdom's religious affairs, including appointment of monastery abbots, monk orders according to the [[Vinaya]], management of breaches of discipline, preparation of an annual report of the order, and administration of [[Pali]] examinations.{{sfn|James|2005|p=81-84}}

The Thathanabaing was charged with managing the functions of two government officials, the ''Mahadan Wun'' ({{my|မဟာဒါန်ဝန်}}, Ecclesiastical Censor), who oversaw the king's charitable functions, ensured monk compliance with the Vinaya, and submitted registers of all active novices and monks, and the ''Wutmye Wun'' ({{my|ဝတ်မြေဝန်}}), who managed the ''wuttukan''-designated religious properties ({{my|ဝတ္ထုကံမြေ}}), including donated land and pagodas.{{sfn|Scott|1900|p=4}}{{sfn|Scott|1900|p=6}}  The Burmese kingdom was divided into ecclesiastical jurisdictions, each of which was overseen by a ''gaing-gyok''. Underneath each ''gaing-gyok'' was a number of ''gaing-ok'', who were in turn assisted by a number of ''gaing-dauk''.{{sfn|Scott|1900|p=4}} Ecclesiastical disputes were settled by the ''gaing-gyok'' and decisions for appeal were made by the Sudhamma Council.{{sfn|Scott|1900|p=4}}

===Colonial rule===
[[File:Procession of Taunggwin Sayadaw.jpg|thumb|Procession of the Taunggwin Sayadaw at his installation as Thathanabaing of Upper Burma in 1903.]]

In 1895, soon after the abdication of the country's last king, [[Thibaw Min]], the Taungdaw Sayadaw, then the Thathanapaing of Burma, died.{{sfn|Long|1906}} A subsequent election elected the Pakhan Sayadaw as Thathanabaing-elect, although the British refused to acknowledge or recognize his title.{{sfn|Long|1906}}

In 1903, the lieutenant-governor of [[British Burma]], [[Hugh Shakespear Barnes]], reinstated the title by ''[[Sanad (deed)|sanad]]'' charter, giving the Thathanapaing nominal authority over internal administration of the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]] in [[Upper Burma]] and over Buddhist ecclesiastical law.{{sfn|Long|1906}} ([[Lower Burma]], which had been annexed in 1852, remained without a religious head.{{sfn|Aung San Suu Kyi|2010}}) The [[Taunggwin Sayadaw]] was appointed, but the position was abolished after his death and no successor was ever appointed.{{sfn|Ghosh|2000|p=38-39}}

{{Sikhism sidebar}}
The 52 [[Hukam]]s are a set of instruction in [[Sikhism]] set by [[Guru Gobind Singh]] in [[Nanded]], [[Maharashtra]], India in 1708.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Balawindara|title=Fifty-Two Commandments Of Guru Gobind Singh|year=2004|publisher=Singh Bros.|page=9|location=Michigan, US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Satbir|title=Aad Sikh Te Aad Sakhian|year=1991|publisher=New Book Company|location=Jalandhar}}&lt;/ref&gt; These edicts sum up the ideal way of life of the [[Khalsa]] and serve as a code of conduct for the Khalsa Panth. Members of the Khalsa (baptized [[Sikh]]s) aim to follow all the 52 edicts though the authenticity and origin of Hukams can be questioned and they seem to be made in more modern times as the style of Punjab is quite modern but many of them come from older writings such as [[Bhai Nand Lal]]'s Tankanama.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2150">'''Thubten Kunga Ling Center''' (TKC), is a Buddhist Center in [[Deerfield Beach, Florida]].  TKC follows the [[Gelugpa]] tradition of [[Tibetan Buddhism]], which is the lineage of the [[Dalai Lama]].  The center offers classes on meditation and Buddhist philosophy. The resident teacher is Venerable Lhundub Tendron. 

Tubten Kunga Center is located at 201 SE 15th Terrace, Suite 206, Deerfield Beach, Florida 33441

==History==

Tubten Kunga Center was founded in 1994 by Jacqueline Keeley. TKC then became part of the [[Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition]], the international network of Tibetan Buddhist centers founded by the Lama [[Thubten Yeshe]] and Lama [[Thubten Zopa Rinpoche]].

==Teacher==

Our resident teacher, Venerable Tendron, comes to us from the Kadampa Center in Raleigh, NC, and the Chenrezig Nuns Community in Australia. Following Lama Zopa Rinpoche's advice she received ordination from Geshe Lhundub Sopa in 2002 at Deer Park in Madison.Following ordination she moved to CNC to begin her life as a nun and her in-depth studies of the Dharma. After completing the Basic Program in 2007 and becoming an FPMT registered teacher, she returned to Kadampa Center to assist with teaching and coordinate the spiritual program. When Chenrezig Institute offered the Master's program on the Middle Way, she hurried back to CNC to deepen her understanding. In 2013, she made a side trip to Taiwan during which she received full ordination. Most recently she spent 2 years caring for her father before his death in 2015. She brings to her teaching practical experience from trying to implement the teachings within her very American mind and the hectic atmosphere of our Western culture.

[[File:Duc De Berry - Besessener.jpg|300px|thumb|[[Jesus]] drives out a demon or '''unclean spirit''', from the 15th-century ''[[Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry|Très Riches Heures]]'']]

In [[English Bible translations|English translations of the Bible]], '''unclean spirit''' is a common rendering&lt;ref&gt;For instance, in the [[King James Version]], [[Wycliffe's Bible]], [[Tyndale Bible]], [[New Revised Standard Version]], [[American Standard Version]], [[International Standard Version]], [[World English Bible]], [[New English Translation]]; "foule sprete" in the [[Coverdale Bible]].&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] '''''pneuma akatharton''''' (πνεῦμα ἀκάθαρτον; plural ''pneumata akatharta'' (πνεύματα ἀκάθαρτα)), which in its single occurrence in the [[Septuagint]] translates Hebrew ''{{lang|he-Latn|[[Ruach|ruaḥ]]  [[Tumah|tum'ah]]}}'' ({{lang|he|רוח  טומאה}}).

The Greek term appears  21 times in the [[New Testament]] in the context of [[demonic possession]].&lt;ref&gt;The term appears 21 times counting both singular and plural. J. Reiling, "Unclean spirits," in ''Dictionary of Deities and Demons in the Bible'', henceforth abbreviated ''DDD'' (William B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1999), p. 882 [https://books.google.com/books?id=yCkRz5pfxz0C&amp;pg=PA882 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also translated into English as '''spirit of impurity'''&lt;ref&gt;As in the [[New International Version]].

The association of physical and spiritual cleanliness is, if not universal, widespread and continues into the 21st century: "To be virtuous is to be physically clean and free from the impurity that is [[sin]]," notes an article in ''[[Scientific American]]'' published 10 March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Sherman and Gerald Clore, "Clean and Virtuous: When Physical Purity Becomes Moral Purity," ''Scientific American'' 10 March 2009, accessed [http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=embodied-metaphor-moral online] 20 April 2009; also [[WebCite]] [https://www.webcitation.org/5gB7t0WDy archive].&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholarship&lt;ref&gt;Clinton Wahlen presents an overview of this scholarship in ''Jesus and the Impurity of Spirits in the Synoptic Gospels'' (Mohr Siebeck, 2004).

In the New Testament, the Greek modifier ''akatharton'', although sometimes translated in context as "evil,"&lt;ref&gt;At Mark 1:23, for instance, the [[New Living Translation]] has "evil spirit," but glosses "Greek 'unclean'."&lt;/ref&gt; means more precisely "impure, not purified," and reflects a concern for [[ritual purification]] shared with or derived from Judaism, though reinterpreted.&lt;ref&gt;''DDD'', p. 882, with additional citations. See also [[Ritual washing in Judaism]], [[Tumah]], and [[Mikvah]]. Connections and differences between Judaic impurity and Christian are explored extensively by Wahlen, ''Jesus and the Impurity of Spirits'', introduction, pp. 1–22.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[early Christianity]], the [[catechumen]] was routinely prepared for [[baptism]] by [[exorcism]] even when demonic possession was not suspected; in the case of adult [[Religious conversion|converts]], the "unclean spirits" to be driven away might be identified with the gods of other religions.&lt;ref&gt;Indicated, for instance, by [[Tertullian]], ''Apologeticus'' 23.15-16.

The [[Magic in the Greco-Roman world|syncretic magical practice]] of [[late antiquity]] drew on Hebraic elements, and spells from the Greek Magical Papyri evoke and attempt to command Jewish angels, demons, and other beings regarded as spiritually powerful.

Exorcism is the most thoroughly attested [[Magic in the Greco-Roman world#Jewish magic|Jewish magical practice]] of the [[Second Temple]] period. The exorcistic technique of [[Incense|fumigation by incense]] depends on the aerial conception of the unclean spirit: the occupation of air by [[odor]] or [[smoke]] (i.e., airborne particulate matter) was supposed to drive off or displace an unclean spirit.&lt;ref&gt;Gideon Bohak, ''Ancient Jewish Magic: A History'' (Cambridge University Press, 2008) p. 88 [https://books.google.com/books?id=DpJlOHceIjMC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;dq=%22Of+all+the+Jewish+magical+practices+of+the+SEcond+Temple+period,+exorcism%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES online]; for an extensive discussion of Jewish exorcism, see pp. 88–118 (limited preview).

{{see also|Christian demonology|Miracles attributed to Jesus#Exorcisms}}

The exorcism of demons and unclean spirits is one of the major categories of [[miracles attributed to Jesus]]. In the [[Novum Testamentum Graece|Greek New Testament]], 20 occurrences of ''pneuma akatharton'' (singular and plural) are found in the [[Synoptic Gospels]], [[Acts of the Apostles]], and the [[Book of Revelation]].&lt;ref&gt;''DDD'', p. 882.&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase may be used instead of ''daimonion'' (50 occurrences)&lt;ref&gt;''DDD'', p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt; or a verbal form of ''daimonizesthai'', "to be possessed by a demon" or "to be or act as a demoniac,"&lt;ref&gt;Verbal form at Matthew 4:24; 8:16, 28, 33; 9:32; 12:22; 15:22; Mark 1:32; 5:15ff; ''A Dictionary of Biblical Tradition'', p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; as indicated by usage in parallel versions of the same story.&lt;ref&gt;Compare {{bibleverse||Mark|6:7}} and {{bibleverse||Matthew|10:1}}, where Jesus gives his disciples power to cast out "unclean spirits" (''pneuma akatharta'') with the parallel passage at {{bibleverse||Luke|9:1}}, where the word ''daimonia'' is used; also {{bibleverse||Mark|7:25}}, "unclean spirit," and {{bibleverse||Matthew|15:22}}, ''daimonizetai''; see ''DDD'', p. 882.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout [[The Gospel of Mark]], the terms ''pneuma'' (with a pejorative modifier) and ''daimonion'' seem to be equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;John R. Donahue and Daniel J. Harrington, ''The Gospel of Mark'' (The Liturgical Press, 2002), p. 80 [https://books.google.com/books?id=xZAIsUZOwSQC&amp;pg=PA80&amp;dq=pneuma+%22unclean+spirit%22+akatharton+OR+acatharton&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=1&amp;as_miny_is=2009&amp;as_maxm_is=12&amp;as_maxy_is=2009&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES online.] For a table on Mark's demonological terminology, see Clinton Wahlen, ''Jesus and the Impurity of Spirits in the Synoptic Gospels'' (Mohr Siebeck, 2004), p. 120 [https://books.google.com/books?id=6hrBXnXakq4C&amp;pg=PA120&amp;dq=%22summary+of+demonological+terminology+in+Matthew%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES online.] Throughout his book, Wahlen seeks to refine scholarly perception of the term ''pneuma akatharton'' and to distinguish its usage in the synoptic gospels.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the narratives pertaining to the [[ministry of Jesus]], [[temptation]] to [[sin]] is not the primary role played by demons, but rather the causing of disease, disability, mental illness, and antisocial behavior; they defile and compel their human hosts to suffer both physically and spiritually. Although healing and exorcism are distinguished,&lt;ref&gt;See {{bibleverse||Matthew|4:24}} and {{bibleverse||Mark|1:32}}.&lt;/ref&gt; they often appear in close association, and some afflictions are caused by demonic possession: the inability to speak at {{bibleverse||Matthew|9:32}}, blindess at {{bibleverse||Matthew|12:22}}, deafness at {{bibleverse||Mark|9:17–29}}, [[epilepsy]] at {{bibleverse||Matthew|17:18}}, and fever and other diseases at {{bibleverse||Luke|4:39}} and {{bibleverse||Luke|8:2}}. [[Mental disorder|Mental illness]], however, was the most common result.&lt;ref&gt;''DDD'', pp. 237, 239.&lt;/ref&gt;

The exorcism of an unclean spirit was the first act of Jesus's public ministry:&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey W. Bromley, ''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia'' (William B. Eerdmans, 1994), p. 789&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;They went to [[Capernaum]], and when the [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]] came, Jesus went into the [[synagogue]] and began to teach. &lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;The people were amazed at his teaching, because he taught them as one who had [[authority]], not as the teachers of [[Halakha|the law]]. &lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;Just then a man in their synagogue who was possessed by an unclean spirit cried out, &lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;"What do you want with us, Jesus of [[Nazareth#New Testament times and associations|Nazareth]]? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are — the Holy One of God!" &lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;"Be quiet!" said Jesus sternly. "Come out of him!" &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;The unclean spirit shook the man violently and came out of him with a shriek. &lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;The people were all so amazed that they asked each other, "What is this? A new teaching — and with authority! He even gives orders to unclean spirits and they obey him." &lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;News about him spread quickly over the whole region of [[Galilee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Mark|1:21–28}}. This is the translation of the [[New International Version]], with one exception: the NIV translates ''akatharton'' as "evil," with a note pointing out that the Greek means "unclean."&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although "clean" and "unclean" were categories that served as markers of identity for Jews, distinguishing them from other nations and expressing [[Land of Israel|Israel's]] special "[[vocation]] to [[sacred|holiness]]," Jesus dismissed Jewish purity [[Religious law|laws]] and in {{bibleverse||Mark|7:1–23}} told his disciples they could violate them. He touched those who were in ritual terms "unclean," including [[Leprosy#Rome|lepers]], and healed them.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy A. Lenghar, "Clean and Unclean," ''Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible," pp. 262–263.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jesus is said to have directly granted his [[12 Disciples|12 disciples]] the power to cast out unclean spirits and to heal.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Mark|6:7}}, {{bibleverse||Matthew|10:1}}, {{bibleverse||Luke|9:1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At {{bibleverse||Luke|9:49–50}}, [[John the Apostle]] reports that he and his fellow disciples have asked a man to stop casting out demons in the name of Jesus "because he isn't one of us," but Jesus replies that the man should be allowed to continue, since "anyone who is not against you is for you."&lt;ref&gt;Translation from the [[Contemporary English Version]].&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere, Jesus appoints 72&lt;ref&gt;Or 70 missionaries in some [[manuscript]]s.&lt;/ref&gt; [[missionary|missionaries]] who also have the power to cast out demons.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|10:17–20}}; ''daimonia'' in the missionaries' terminology (10.17), ''pneumata'' in the words of Jesus (10.20). At {{bibleverse||Mark|16:17}}, the newly resurrected Christ says that the ability to drive out demons (''daimonia'') in his name is a sign of the [[belief|true believer]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Haeckel Batrachia.jpg|left|thumb|Frogs of the [[amphibian]] class Batrachia ([[Ernst Haeckel|Haeckel]], 1904); [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] compares three ''pneumata'' to [[frogs]] (Greek ''batrachoi''), an [[Kashrut|'''unclean''' animal]]]]

===Animals and liminality===
The attribution of animal-like qualities to demons continues from the Jewish tradition; like demons, [[Unclean animals|animals may be classified as "unclean."]] {{bibleverse||Revelation|16:13}} describes "three unclean spirits like [[Frogs in popular culture|frog]]s" (''pneumata tria akatharta hôs [[Batrachia|batrachoi]]''); frogs are unclean as animals for food in the [[Kashrut|Jewish dietary code]].&lt;ref&gt;This and more on frogs in the Bible from Victoria Andrews, "Frogs," in ''Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible'' p. 472 [https://books.google.com/books?id=P9sYIRXZZ2MC&amp;pg=PA472&amp;dq=frogs+unclean+dietary+kashrut+OR+jewish&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES online]; also "Clean and Unclean," pp. 262–262. It has sometimes been argued that frogs are clean; see discussion by Seth Daniel Kunin, ''We Think What We Eat: Neo-structuralist Analysis of [[Israelite]] Food Rules and Other Cultural and Textual Practices'' (Continuum International, 2004), pp. 47–48 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Rggvu8zvtGIC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=frogs+unclean+dietary+kashrut+OR+jewish&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES#PPA47,M1  online.] See also articles on [[Frogs in popular culture]] and the [[Egyptian pantheon|Egyptian goddess]] [[Heqet]].&lt;/ref&gt; The association of unclean spirits with [[liminality|liminal]] areas such as ruins, cemeteries, and [[desert]]s also continues from Judaic belief; {{bibleverse||Revelation|18:2}} speaks of the future ruin of [[Babylon (New Testament)|Babylon]] as "a dwelling place of every unclean spirit and a haunt of every unclean and hateful bird."

Both animalism and [[Liminality#In places|transitional, liminal sites]] (marked in '''bold''' following) are involved in perhaps the most famous manifestation of an unclean spirit in the New Testament, the [[Legion (demon)|Gerasene demon whose name is Legion]]:

[[File:Healing of the demon-possessed.jpg|left|thumb|Medieval illustration of Jesus casting out the '''unclean''' [[Legion (demon)|Gerasene demon]]]]
{{cquote|&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;And they ''[Jesus and his followers]'' came to the other '''side of the sea''',&lt;ref&gt;For the connection of demons to the sea, see for instance [[Abyzou#Origins|Abyzou: Origins]].&lt;/ref&gt; as  into the [[Jerash|country of the Gerasenes]]. &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; And when he was come out of the boat, straightway there met him out of the '''tombs''' a man with an unclean spirit ''(pneumati akathartoi)'', &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;who had his dwelling in the tombs: and no man could any more bind him, no, not with a chain; &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been rent asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: and no man had strength to tame him. &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;And always, night and day, '''in the tombs and in the mountains''', he was crying out, and cutting himself with stones. &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;And when he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and worshipped him; &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;and crying out with a loud voice, he saith, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the Most High God? I adjure thee by God, torment me not. &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;For he said unto him, Come forth, thou unclean spirit ''(pneuma akatharton)'', out of the man. &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;And he asked him, What is thy name? And he saith unto him, My name is Legion; for we are many. &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country. &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;Now there was there on the '''mountain side''' a great herd of [[Pig|swine]] feeding. &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;And they besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them. &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;And he gave them leave. And the unclean spirits ''(ta pneumata ta akatharta)'' came out, and entered into the swine: and the herd rushed '''down the steep bank into the sea''', in number about two thousand; and they were drowned in the sea. &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;And they that fed them fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And they came to see what it was that had come to pass. &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;And they come to Jesus, and behold him that was possessed with demons sitting, clothed and in his right mind, even him that had the legion: and they were afraid. &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;And they that saw it declared unto them how it befell him that was possessed with demons, and concerning the swine. &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;And they began to beseech him to depart from their '''borders'''. &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;And as he was '''entering into the boat''', he that had been possessed with demons besought him that he might be with him. &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;And he suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go to thy house unto thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and how he had mercy on thee. &lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;And he went his way, and began to publish in [[Decapolis]] how great things Jesus had done for him: and all men marvelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Mark|5:1–20}}, quoted here in the [[American Standard Version]].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Pigs#Pigs in religion|pig]] is a suitable recipient because it is an unclean animal. "It was certainly not very kind to the pigs," the philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] remarked, "to put the devils into them and make them rush down the hill to the sea."&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertrand Russell]], "[[Why I Am Not a Christian]]," republished in ''The Collected Papers of Bertrand Russell'' (Routledge, 1996), vol. 10, p. 190 [https://books.google.com/books?id=oEoi0HnF7j0C&amp;pg=RA1-PA190&amp;dq=%22instance+of+the+Gadarene+swine%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=3 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; The need for the demonic ''pneuma'' to transmigrate into another body is expressed also at {{bibleverse||Matthew|12:43}}, where desert is a haunt for the restless spirit:

{{cquote|When an unclean spirit comes out of a man, it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it.&lt;ref&gt;Translation from the [[New International Version]], except that ''akatharton pneuma'' is translated as "evil spirit" but glossed as "unclean."&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===''Pneuma poneron''===
[[File:John Collier - Priestess of Delphi.jpg|thumb|''Priestess of Delphi'' (1891) by [[John Collier (Pre-Raphaelite painter)|John Collier]]; the [[Pythia]] was inspired by a '''''pneuma''''' rising from below]]
The phrase ''pneuma poneron'' (πνεῦμα πονηρόν, "evil spirit") is used several times in the Septuagint, the New Testament&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|12:45}}; {{bibleverse||Luke|7:21}} {{bibleverse||Luke|8:2}}, and {{bibleverse||Luke|11:26}}; {{bibleverse||Acts|19:12–13}} and {{bibleverse||Acts|15–16}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and also in [[Church Fathers|patristic texts]] as an alternative to ''pneuma akatharton''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward John Hamilton, ''Rational Orthodoxy'' (New York, 1917), p. 445.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Divination|divinatory]] [[Trance#Origins and history|trance]] of the [[Pythia]] — the female [[Oracle of Delphi|oracle]] of [[Apollo]] at [[Delphi]] — is attributed by the 4th-century [[Church Fathers|patristic authority]] [[John Chrysostom]] to a ''pneuma poneron'':

{{cquote|The Pythia is seated on [[Sacrificial tripod|Apollo's tripod]], her legs spread. An evil spirit (''pneuma poneron'') rises from below, enters her [[vagina]], and fills her with madness. Her hair is disheveled, and foam flows from her mouth: she is like a [[Maenad|bacchante]]. And it is in such a state that she speaks.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Chrysostom]], ''[[Homily|Homilies]] on the [[Pauline epistles|Epistles of Paul]] to the [[Corinth#Roman era|Corinthians]]'', Homily 29 on [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1 Corinthians]], as translated and cited in Giulia Sissa, ''Greek Virginity'' (Harvard University Press, 1990), p. 23. [[Origen]], ''[[Contra Celsum]]'' 3.25 (pre-dating Chrysostom), makes a similar remark; see under [[Unclean spirit#Pneuma pythona|Pneuma pythona below]].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Chrysostom uses the phrase ''pneuma poneron'' frequently in his writings; it is typically translated "evil spirit." The nature of the vapors that inspired the Pythia has been the subject of much debate; see [[Pythia#Science and the Pythia|Science and the Pythia]]. For the Greeks, the Pythia was characterized by [[sexual purity]]; her [[virginity]] is asserted in some sources, but in others she is said only to have dressed as a virgin and to have lived chastely, and was either an old woman or a married woman who gave up her family and [[Carnal knowledge|carnal relations]] to serve the god.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara E.

====''Pneuma pythona''====
The phrase ''pneuma pythona'.' (or ''puthona'') means "Pythonian spirit" or "divinatory spirit," and occurs only once in the New Testament. In {{bibleverse||Acts|16:16–18}}, after [[Saint Paul|Paul]] and [[Silas]] visit a woman of [[Thyatira]], they are greeted on their way to [[synagogue]] by a "working girl" (''paidiskê''), a slave who has earned a reputation as a gifted diviner; she is said to have a ''pneuma pythona'', not ''akatharton'' or ''poneron'', though the spirit is presumed to be evil. Through her employment she earns significant income for her masters. The adjective ''pythona'' indicates a connection to the cult of Apollo, regarded as the greatest of the [[Oracle#Greece|Greek oracular gods]]; she is nevertheless inspired to acknowledge out loud that the two missionaries of the "most high god" (''theos hypsistos''; see also [[Hypsistarians]]) know the way to [[salvation]]. For several days, she repeatedly voices this praise of Christianity. Although it is unclear why a Christian would dispute the truth of the ''paidiskê'' 's message, and although Jesus himself had said "anyone who is not against you is for you" (see [[Unclean spirit#In Christianity|above]] and {{bibleverse||Luke|9:49–50}}), Paul eventually grows annoyed and commands the ''pneuma'' to leave her.&lt;ref&gt;Shelly Matthews, ''First Converts: Rich Pagan Women and the Rhetoric of Mission in Early Judaism and Christianity'' (Stanford University Press, 2001), pp. 89–92 [https://books.google.com/books?id=mVg7zeCMxqQC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=%22This+narrative+has+several+verbal+connections+to+the+exorcism+stories%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES online], with additional citations of scholarship on the cultic identification of the ''paidiskê''. It has also been argued that since ''Hypsistos'' was a cult title for gods other than the [[Abrahamic religions#The Supreme Deity|one god of Abrahamic religions]], Paul struck back at the girl as a rival; see Paul Tribilco, "Paul and Silas, Servants of the Most High God - Acts 16:16-18," ''Journal for the Study of the New Testament'' 36 (1989) 51-73. This point of view is discussed and rejected by Irina Levinskaya, "God-fearers and the Cult of the Most High God," in ''The Book of Acts in Its Diaspora Setting'' (Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1996), pp. 98–100 [https://books.google.com/books?id=g3fb8guUfwEC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=%22Trebilco+has+proposed+a+new+interpretation%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0 online]: "The demon was exorcised by Paul, not because of the content of his proclamation, but because the Christian mission did not need allies such as these" (p. 100). Discussion with emphasis on the slave-girl's perspective in Hans-Josef Klauck, ''Magic and Paganism in Early Christianity: The World of the Acts of the Apostles'' (T&amp;T Clark, 2000), pp. 63–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

This encounter differs from other exorcisms in the New Testament. Unlike Jesus, who usually heals at first contact, Paul drives away the spirit only after several days. The girl is depicted as neither physically tormented nor insane. A spell from the [[Greek Magical Papyri]] shows that the possessing ''pneuma'' could be welcomed as a giver of vision:

[[File:Origen.jpg|thumb|left|100px|'''Origen''']]
[[Plutarch]] gives ''Pythones'' as a [[synonym]] for ''engastrimythoi'' ("belly-talkers" or "[[ventriloquist]]s"), a suspect type of mantic who employed trickery in projecting a voice, sometimes through a device such as a mechanical snake. The snake was probably the chosen [[mediumship|medium]] because of its association in myth with Delphi, where Apollo killed the serpent (the [[Python (mythology)|Python]]) to establish his own oracle there. Plutarch and other ancient authors scoff at the notion that the god himself enters the body of a paid mantic for use as a mouthpiece. The early [[Church fathers]], however, attributed the behavior of ''engastrimythoi'' to demonic possession.&lt;ref&gt;Aune, ''Prophecy in Early Christianity'', pp. 40–42.&lt;/ref&gt; Like Chrysostom, the early Christian theologian [[Origen]] finds the Pythia's receptive vagina disturbing&lt;ref&gt;"The prophetic spirit of Apollo, pure from any body of earth, secretly enters through the private parts the person who is called the priestess"; [[Origen]], ''[[Contra Celsum]]'' 3.25 and 7.3–7.&lt;/ref&gt; and uses the gender of Apollo's oracle as a way to disparage the Delphic religion, saying that if Apollo were a true god, he would have chosen a male prophet:&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, ''First Converts'', p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|If the Delphian Apollo were a god, as the Greeks suppose, would he not rather have chosen as his prophet some wise man? or if such an one was not to be found, then one who was endeavouring to become wise? How came he not to prefer a man to a woman for the utterance of his prophesies? And if he preferred the latter sex, as though he could only find pleasure in the breast of a woman, why did he not choose among women a virgin to interpret his will?&lt;ref&gt;Origen, ''Contra Celsum'' 7.5.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The sexual purity of a male prophet is not at issue, but sexual activity renders a woman unfit. The implication of sexual union between the god and a mortal woman is again viewed as a dangerous deception.

===''Pneumata plana''===
[[Image:Daemon.jpg|right|125px|thumb|Demonic ''porneia'' in a 13th-century [[allegory|allegorization]] of [[lust]]]]
In [[First Epistle to Timothy|one of his epistles]] to [[Saint Timothy|Timothy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Timothy|4:1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Paul defines [[apostasy|apostate]]s as those who are drawn to "deceiving" or "seductive" spirits (''pneumasin planois'') and demonic teachings (''didaskaliais daimoniôn''). {{bibleverse|1|John|4:6}} refers to: ''to pneuma tês planês'', "the spirit of error."

These ''pneumata plana'' are also found frequently in the [[apocryphal]] ''[[Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs]]'', where they threaten to lead astray the [[Israelite]]s into varieties of immorality. The "seven spirits of deceit"&lt;ref&gt;''[[Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs#Reuben|Testament of Reuben]]'' 2.1 and 3.2–7.&lt;/ref&gt; are ''porneia'' (sexual sins),&lt;ref&gt;For the term ''porneia'', see definitions under [[Wife-for-life|Expounding of the Law]] and [[Religion and sexuality#Christianity|Religion and sexuality]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[gluttony]], [[anger]], [[hypocrisy]], [[pride|arrogance]], [[lie|lying]], and [[injustice]]; "besides all these, the [[Morpheus (mythology)|spirit of sleep]], the eighth spirit, is conjoined with [[error]] and [[Fantasy (psychology)|fantasy]]."&lt;ref&gt;Jerome D.

===''Pneuma astheneias''===
The phrase ''pneuma astheneias'', "spirit of infirmity" or "spirit of weakness," is unique in the New Testament to the [[Gospel of Luke]], as is the story in which it appears:

{{cquote|&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath day. &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;And behold, a woman that had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years; and she was bowed together, and could in no wise lift herself up. &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;And when Jesus saw her, he called her, and said to her, Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity. &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;And he laid his hands upon her: and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|13:10–13}}, [[American Standard Version]].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Luke the Evangelist|Luke]] is the [[gospel]] writer who was a [[physician]], and while his profession may have motivated his interest, nothing suggests a [[medical diagnosis]]. ''Asthenia'' throughout the New Testament means "weakness" or "powerlessness" of any kind, including sickness. Some have seen the affliction as [[ankylosing spondylitis]], but an alternative interpretation is that hard labor over the years had bent the woman's back. The incident has been examined at length from the perspective of [[feminist theology]] by [[Francis Taylor Gench]], who views it as both healing and liberating; Jesus goes on to say that the woman has been freed from a kind of bondage to [[Satan]]. The breaking of bonds or chains is often associated with freedom from an unclean spirit; in the case of the [[Unclean spirit#Animals and liminality|Gerasene demon (above)]], the demoniac had the physical power to break chains as a result of possession.&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Taylor Gench]], "A Bent Woman, Daughter of Abraham (Luke 13:10–17)," in ''Back to the Well: Women's Encounters with Jesus in the Gospels'' (Westminster John Knox Press, 2004), pp. 84–108, limited preview [https://books.google.com/books?id=mBWhxl5JBpMC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=%22only+luke+among+the+evangelists%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Pneuma alalon''===
The ''pneuma alalon'' is a speechless spirit who renders the possessed mute (Greek ''alalon,'' "without speech"). It thus differs from most possessing demons, who are given to taunts and mockery (''diabolos'', the origin of both "diabolic" and "[[Devil]]," means "slanderer" in Greek). {{bibleverse||Mark|9:14–29}} relates that a boy is brought to Jesus for healing because he cannot speak; verse 25 adds that he cannot hear. This demonic possession manifests itself through symptoms that resemble [[epilepsy]], as is suggested also by {{bibleverse||Matthew|17:15}}, who uses a form of the colloquial verb ''seleniazetai'' ("moonstruck") for the condition.&lt;ref&gt;The event is also narrated by Luke 9:37–49.&lt;/ref&gt; Although traditionally [[Epilepsy#History|epilepsy was regarded as "the sacred disease,"]] Jews and Christians attributed the affliction to a demon. The [[Babylonian Talmud]] specifies that a child's epilepsy was caused by "the [[Šulak (demon)|demon of the privy]]," which attached to the father when he had sex too soon after [[excretion|relieving himself]]; that is, he was impure:

{{cquote|After coming back from the [[toilet|lavatory]] ''(bet ha-kissê)'', one should wait [some time] before sexual intercourse, as the [[Šulak (demon)|demon of the lavatory]] accompanies him.

====Unforgivable sin====

{{Main|Unforgivable sin}}
Before Jesus, exorcism had been conducted by a trained practitioner who offered a diagnosis and administered a ritual usually employing spoken formularies, amulets or other objects, or compounds of substances resembling pharmacological recipes of the time. Jesus's approach seemed radical because it depended on spiritual authority alone.&lt;ref&gt;''DDD'', p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus casts out the ''pneuma alalon'' in front of a crowd who exclaim "Nothing like this has ever happened in [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|Israel]]!" The [[Pharisees]], also witnesses, counter that "the [[Hierarchy of demons|leader of the demons]] gives him power to force out demons."&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 9:32–34 ([[Contemporary English Version]]).&lt;/ref&gt; This accusation leads to the "[[Beelzebub]] controversy." {{bibleverse||Mark|3:29–30}} warns that attributing the power of the [[Holy Spirit]] to possession by an "unclean spirit" is a [[Eternal sin|sin that cannot be forgiven]]. The [[theology|theological]] concept is difficult and subject to varying interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;Mark S. Krause, "Unforgivable Sin," ''Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible'', pp. 1345–1346 [https://books.google.com/books?id=P9sYIRXZZ2MC&amp;pg=PA1345&amp;dq=%22A+phenomenon+also+called+the+%22unpardonable+sin.%22%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In {{bibleverse||Mark|3:20–22}}, Jesus returns home from performing miracles, but a crowd gathers: "There were so many people that Jesus and his followers could not eat. When his family heard this, they went to get him because they thought he was out of his mind. But the teachers of [[Halakha|the law]] from [[History of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]] were saying, '[[Beelzebul]] is living inside him! He uses his power from the ruler of demons to force demons out of people'."&lt;ref&gt;[[New Century Version]] translation.&lt;/ref&gt; In his response to this accusation, Jesus says that speaking out against the Holy Spirit is an unforgivable sin: "Jesus said this because the people were saying that he had an evil spirit in him."&lt;ref&gt;Mark 3:28–30 (Contemporary English Version).&lt;/ref&gt; {{bibleverse||Luke|12:10}} clarifies that "if you speak against the [[Son of Man]], you can be forgiven, but if you speak against the Holy Spirit, you cannot be forgiven."

===Early Christian exorcism===
In the period of [[History of Christianity#Post-Apostolic Church|post-Apostolic Christianity]], [[baptism]] and the [[Eucharist]] required the prior riddance of both unclean spirits and illness.&lt;ref&gt;William Brashear and Roy Kotansky, "A New Magical Prayer Formulary," in ''Magic and Ritual in the Ancient World'', edited by Paul Mirecki and Marvin Meyer (Brill, 2002), p. 13 [https://books.google.com/books?id=xMDHgzjSU_MC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=%22the+ridding+of+demons+and+illness%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=1&amp;as_miny_is=2009&amp;as_maxm_is=12&amp;as_maxy_is=2009&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES online.]&lt;/ref&gt; Because the possessing demon was conceptualized as a ''pneuma'' or ''spiritus'', each of which derives from a root meaning "breath," one term for its expulsion was [[Insufflation#Insufflation vs. exsufflation|exsufflation]], or a "blowing out."&lt;ref&gt;For medieval liturgical examples — the Rheinau Ritual (12th century), Constance Ritual (1482), and the Magdeburg Agenda (1492) — see Bryan D. Spinks, ''Early and Medieval Rituals and Theologies of Baptism: From the New Testament to the Council of Trent'' (Ashgate Publishing, 2006), p. 136 [https://books.google.com/books?id=JVV1IEHV6jkC&amp;pg=PA136&amp;dq=%22unclean+spirit%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES#v=onepage&amp;q=%22unclean%20spirit%22&amp;f=false online] and 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

Exorcistic texts with Christian content have been found in [[papyrology|papyri]] along with syncretic magic spells; in one Greek example of a fragmentary [[Recto and verso|leaf]] from a [[codex]], an exorcism that alludes to the [[Nativity of Jesus|birth of Jesus]] and his miracles appears along with a spell for silencing opponents, an invocation of the [[Serpent (symbolism)|Serpent]], a spell against a thief, a spell to achieve an [[erection]], a "sacred [[stele]],"&lt;ref&gt;In both the [[Near East]] and the [[Greco-Roman world]], a [[stele]] inscribed with images and text might be a focal point of [[Cult (religious practice)|cult practice]]. Magic papyri on occasion contain text to be inscribed on a stele; see for instance [[Georg Luck]], ''Arcana Mundi: Magic and the Occult in the Greek and Roman Worlds. A Collection of Ancient Texts'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985; 2nd edition 2006), p. 139 [https://books.google.com/books?id=g7EKsAdHdL4C&amp;pg=PA139&amp;dq=%22sacred+stele%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES online]; full text in translation with Hebraic elements in Hans Dieter Betz, ''The Greek Magical Papyri in Translation, Including the Demotic Spells'' (University of Chicago Press, 1996), vol. 1, p. 174 [https://books.google.com/books?id=K0hCj5u3HNQC&amp;pg=PA174&amp;dq=%22sacred+stele%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES  online.] Two types of stele are contained in the papyri: a drawing with or without writing, and an inscribed charm.&lt;/ref&gt; and a series of magical letters (χαρακτῆρες). The exorcism is distinguished from other early Christian magic charms that quote Bible verses and [[Psalms]] by its use of [[liturgy|liturgical]] [[antiphony|antiphonies]] and references to Christian [[creed]].&lt;ref&gt;William Brashear and Roy Kotansky, "A New Magical Formulary," in ''Magic and Ritual in the Ancient World'', edited by Paul Mirecki and [[Marvin Meyer]] (Brill, 2002), pp. 3–24, especially pp. 10–11 [https://books.google.com/books?id=xMDHgzjSU_MC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=%22Christian+Liturgical+Exorcism%22+intitle:Magic+intitle:and+intitle:ritual+intitle:in+intitle:the+intitle:ancient+intitle:world&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES online], English translation [https://books.google.com/books?id=xMDHgzjSU_MC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=%22For+those+troubled+by+%5Bevil%5D+dem%5Bons%5D%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES p. 9.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The unclean spirit associated with a particular possession, or feared possession, might be identified as an individual and named. [[Gello|Gyllou]], a type of reproductive demon that appears on [[Aramaic]] [[amulet]]s in late antiquity, is described in a Greek text as "abominable and unclean" (μιαρὰ καὶ ἀκάθαρτος, ''miara kai akathartos''),&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Naveh and Shaul Shaked, ''Amulets and [[Incantation bowls|Magic Bowls]]: Aramaic Incantations of Late Antiquity'' (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1985), pp. 112–113; see also  Karen Hartnup, ''On the Beliefs of the Greeks: Leo Allatios and Popular Orthodoxy'' (Brill, 2004), p. 88 [https://books.google.com/books?id=xnqI8uSeekwC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq=unclean+inauthor:Hartnup&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES#PPA88,M1 online] and p. 144 [https://books.google.com/books?id=xnqI8uSeekwC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq=unclean+inauthor:Hartnup&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES#PPA144,M1 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; and is the object of a prayer to [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|the Virgin Mary]] asking for protection.&lt;ref&gt;Hartnup, ''On the Beliefs of the Greeks'', p. 97 [https://books.google.com/books?id=xnqI8uSeekwC&amp;pg=PA97&amp;dq=%22Therefore+I+pray,+my+Lady%22+inauthor:Hartnup&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=1&amp;as_miny_is=2009&amp;as_maxm_is=12&amp;as_maxy_is=2009&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES online], citing Allatios, ''De opinionibus'' VII, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Spiritus immundus''===

[[File:Holy water dispenser.jpg|thumb|100px|Cask of [[holy water]] at [[Limburg Cathedral]], with a sign reading "Holy water to take away"]]
In his ''Decretum'', [[Burchard of Worms]] asserts that "we know that unclean spirits ''(spiritus immundi)'' who fell from the heavens wander about between the sky and earth," drawing on the view expressed in the ''[[Commentary on Job|Moralia in Job]]'' of [[Pope Gregory I|Gregory I]]. In his [[penitential]], Burchard says that some people wait until cock's crow — that is, dawn — to go outdoors because they feared ''spiritus immundi''. The fear is not treated as groundless; rather, Burchard recommends [[Christ]] and the [[sign of the cross]] as protection, rather than reliance on the cock's crow. The exact nature of these ''immundi'' is unclear: they may have been demons, woodland beings such as [[imp]]s, or ghosts of the unhallowed dead.&lt;ref&gt;Bernadette Filotas, ''Pagan Survivals, Superstitions, and Popular Cultures in Early Medieval Pastoral Literature'' (Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies, 2005), p. 82 [https://books.google.com/books?id=qh1lrIM5nd4C&amp;pg=PA82&amp;dq=%22we+know+that+unclean+spirits%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22we%20know%20that%20unclean%20spirits%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Latin liturgy and exorcism====
''Spiritus immundus'' is the term corresponding to ''pneuma akatharton'' to address the demon in Latin [[exorcism]]s;&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Edward Warren, ''The Liturgy and Ritual of the [[Celtic Christianity|Celtic Church]]'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1881), pp. 210 and 214 [https://books.google.com/books?id=h80YAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA214&amp;dq=%22spiritus+immundus%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=1&amp;as_miny_is=2009&amp;as_maxm_is=12&amp;as_maxy_is=2009&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES online]; Alexander Murray, '' Suicide in the Middle Ages: The Curse on Self-murder'' (Oxford University Press, 2000), p. 476, note 73 [https://books.google.com/books?id=PMa7SYvpcM8C&amp;pg=RA2-PA476&amp;dq=%22spiritus+immundus%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=1&amp;as_miny_is=2009&amp;as_maxm_is=12&amp;as_maxy_is=2009&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES#PRA2-PA476,M1 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; see ''[[Of Exorcisms and Certain Supplications]]'' for text from a modern [[solemnity|solemn]] exorcism adjuring the "unclean spirit" to depart a possessed person. In [[Celtic Rite]], the unclean spirit is evoked and exorcized ''per deum patrem omnipotentem'', "by God, All-powerful Father"; the same phrase is used in both [[Gallican rite|Gallican]] (''exorcidio te, spiritus immunde'') and [[Ambrosian rite|Milanese]] exorcism. The Milanese rite prescribes [[exsufflation]]: ''Exsufflat in faciem ejus in similitudinem crucis dum dicit'' ("Breathe out onto [the subject's] face in the likeness of the cross while speaking").&lt;ref&gt;[[Baptism#Baptism and salvation in Roman Catholic teaching|Ordo Baptismi]], [[Celtic Rite|Sacramentarium Gallicanum]], edition of [[Jean Mabillon]] p. 324; also in an [[Ambrosian Rite|Ambrosian Ritual]] (Ordo xxi) quoted by [[Edmond Martène]], ''De Antiquis Ecclesiae Ritibus'' (1788), vol. 1, p. 80. Frederick Edward Warren, ''The Liturgy and Ritual of the Celtic Church'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1881), p. 220 [https://books.google.com/books?id=k1ArAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA220&amp;dq=%22spiritus+immunde%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Such exorcisms are performed rarely by the 21st-century [[Latin liturgical rites|Western church]]; the more common exorcism involves the ritual preparation of [[holy water]] (''aquae''). The 9th-century [[Stowe Missal]] preserves an early Celtic formula as ''procul ergo hinc, iubente te, domine, omnis spiritus immundus abscedat'' ("Therefore at your bidding, Lord, let every unclean spirit depart far from here").&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Edward Warren, ''The Liturgy and Ritual of the Celtic Church'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1881), p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; In a Latin version of ''The [[Holy Water|Blessing of the Waters]] on the Eve of [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]]'' performed in Rome and recorded at the turn of the 19th–20th centuries, the unclean spirit is commanded ''per Deum vivum'' ("by the Living God").&lt;ref&gt;John, [[Marquess of Bute]], with E.A. Wallis Budge, ''The [[Holy Water|Blessing of the Waters]] on the Eve of [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]]'' (London, 1901), p. 35 [https://books.google.com/books?id=FgEPAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA35&amp;dq=%22Exorcizo+te+spiritus+immunde%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES#PPA35,M1 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; The modern Latin rite to exorcize holy water banishes any "pestilent spirit" (''spiritus pestilens'') or "corrupting atmosphere" (''corrumpens aura''); see [[Holy water#Rituals and uses of holy water|Rituals and uses of holy water]].

{{Western Buddhism}}
The '''Vipassanā movement''', also called the '''Insight Meditation Movement''' and '''American vipassana movement''', refers to a branch of modern Burmese [[Theravada|Theravāda]] [[Buddhism]] which gained widespread popularity since the 1950s, and to its western derivatives which were popularised since the 1970s, and gave rise to the [[mindfulness]] movement.&lt;ref group=web name="Braun2014"/&gt;

The Burmese vipassana movement has its roots in the 19th century, when Theravada Buddhism came to be influenced by western modernism,{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} and some monks tried to restore the Buddhist practice of meditation. Based on the commentaries, [[Ledi Sayadaw]] developed ''vipassana meditation'', which regards ''samatha'' to be unnecessary, and stresses the practice of ''satipatthana'' to acquire ''[[vipassana]]'' (insight) into the [[three marks of existence]] as the main means to attain the beginning of [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|awakening]] and become a [[Sotāpanna|stream-enterer]].&lt;ref group=web name="Braun2014"/&gt;

It was highly popularized in the 20th century in traditional Theravada countries by [[Mahasi Sayadaw]], who introduced the "New Burmese Satipatthana Method". It also gained a large following in the west, due to westerners who learned ''vipassana'' from Mahasi Sayadaw, [[S. N. Goenka]], and other Burmese teachers. Some also studied with Thai Buddhist teachers, who are more critical of the commentarial tradition, and stress the joined parctice of ''samatha'' and ''vipassana''.&lt;ref group=web name="Braun2014"/&gt; 

The 'American vipassanā movement' includes contemporary [[Buddhism in the United States|American Buddhist teachers]] such as [[Joseph Goldstein (writer)|Joseph Goldstein]], [[Tara Brach]], [[Gil Fronsdal]], [[Sharon Salzberg]], [[Ruth Denison]] and [[Jack Kornfield]]. 

Most of these teachers combine the strict Burmese approach with the Thai approach, and also other Buddhist and non-Buddhist ideas and practices, due to their broader training and their critical approach of the Buddhist sources.{{sfn|Shankman|2008}} And while the New Burmese Method is strictly based on the Theravada Abhidhamma and the ''Visuddhimagga'', western teachers tend to base their practice also on personal experience and on the suttas, which they approach in a more textual-critical way.

In a broader sense, modern western Theravada-oriented meditation also include the teachings of Western-born monastics like [[Bikkhu Bodhi]], Bhikkhu Sujato, [[Bhikkhu Analayo]], and [[Thanissaro Bhikkhu]]. They tend to take a more critical approach of the Buddhist suttas, some of them noticing that the Theravada commentaries deviate from the suttas in critical ways.

A recent development is the understanding that ''jhana'', as described in the nikayas, is not a form of concentration-meditation, but a training in heightened awareness and equanimity, which forms the culmination of the Buddhist path.{{sfn|Polak|2011}}{{sfn|Arbel|2017}}

==History==
{{Mindfulness}}

According to Buswell, by the 10th century ''vipassana'' was  no longer practiced in the Theravada tradition, due to the belief that Buddhism had degenerated, and that liberation was no longer attainable until the coming of ''Maitreya''.{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=889}} According to Braun, "the majority of Theravadins and dedicated Buddhists of other traditions, including monks and nuns, have focused on cultivating moral behavior, preserving the Buddha’s teachings (dharma), and acquiring the good karma that comes from generous giving."&lt;ref group=web name="Braun2014"/&gt; 

The interest in meditation was re-awakened in Myanmar (Burma) in the 18th century by [[Medawi]] (1728–1816), who wrote ''vipassana'' manuals. The actual practice of meditation was re-invented in Theravada-countries in the 19th and 20th centuries and simplified meditation techniques, based on the ''[[Satipatthana sutta]]'', the ''[[Visuddhimagga]]'', and other texts, emphasizing ''[[satipatthana]]'' and bare insight were developed.{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=890}}{{sfn|McMahan|2008|p=189}}&lt;ref name="Chapman"&gt;David Chapman, [https://vividness.live/2011/07/07/theravada-reinvents-meditation/ ''Theravada reinvents meditation'' ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th and 20th century the Theravada traditions in Burma, Thailand and Sri Lanka were rejuvenated in response to western colonialism. They were rallying points in the struggle against western hegemonism, giving voice to traditional values and culture.{{sfn|Sharf|1995|p=252}} But the Theravada-tradition was also reshaped, using the Pali scriptural materials to legitimize these reforms. Ironically, the Pali canon became widely accessible due to the western interest in those texts, and the publications of the Pali Text Society.{{sfn|Sharf|1995|p=252}} A major role was also being played by the [[Theosophical Society]], which sought for ancient wisdom in south-East Asia, and stimulated local interest in its own traditions.{{sfn|Sharf|1995|p=253}} The Theosophical Society started a lay-Buddhist organisation in Sri Lanka, independent from power of conventional temples and monasteries.{{sfn|Sharf|1995|p=253}} Interest in meditation was awakened by these developments, whereas the main Buddhist practice in temples was the recitation of texts, not of meditation practice.{{sfn|Sharf|1995|p=253}} 

Lay participation in Theravada countries grew strongly in the 20th century, and eventually also reached the west. Most influential in this renewed interest was the "new Burmese method"{{sfn|Sharf|1995|p=255}} of Vipassana practice, as developed by [[U Nārada]] (1868–1955) and popularized by [[Mahasi Sayadaw]] (1904-1982).{{sfn|Sharf|1995|p=255}} Ultimately, this practice aims at stream entry, with the idea that this first stage of the path to awakening safeguards future development of the person towards full awakening, despite the degenerated age we live in.{{sfn|Fronsdal|1998|p=2}}{{refn|group=note|* Fronsdal: "The primary purpose for which Mahasi offered his form of vipassana practice is the attainment of the first of the four traditional Theravada levels of sainthood (that is, stream entry; sotapatti) through the realization of nibbana, or enlightenment."{{sfn|Fronsdal|1998|p=2}}&lt;br&gt;* Robert Sharf: "In fact, contrary to the image propagated by twentieth-century apologists, the actual practice of what we would call meditation rarely played a major role in Buddhist monastic life. The ubiquitous notion of mappo or the "final degenerate age of the dharma" served to reinforce the notion that "enlightenment" was not in fact a viable goal for monks living in inauspicious times."{{sfn|Sharf|1995|p=241}}&lt;br&gt;* Robert Sharf: "The initial "taste" of nibbana signals the attainment of sotapatti-the first of four levels of enlightenment-which renders the meditator a "noble person" (ariya-puggala)destined for release from the wheel of existence (samsara)in relatively short order."{{sfn|Sharf|1995|p=256}}}} This method spread over South and Southeast Asia, Europe and America, and has become synonymous with ''Vipassana''.{{sfn|Sharf|1995|p=255}}

A comparable development took place in Thailand, where the Buddhist orthodoxy was challenged by monks who aimed to reintroduce the practice of meditation, based on the Sutta Pitaka. In contrast to the Burmese vipassana teachers, Thai teachers taught ''vipassana'' in tandem with ''samatha''. The practical and doctrinal differences have been heatedly debated within south-east Asian Theravada Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;Bhikkhu Sujato, [https://sujato.wordpress.com/2009/11/25/reform/ ''Reform'']&lt;/ref&gt; They have also influenced western teachers, who have tended to take a more liberal approach, questioning the new orthodoxy and integrating various practices and doctrines.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Kornfield (interview), in Shankman (2008), ''The Experience of Samadhi''&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1980s, the Vipassana movement has given way to the largely secularized [[Mindfulness (psychology)|"mindfulness" practice]], which has its roots in [[Zen]] and ''vipassana''-meditation, and has eclipsed the popularity of vipassana meditation.&lt;ref&gt;Matt Nisbet (2017), [https://web.archive.org/web/20181002171906/https://www.csicop.org/si/show/the_mindfulness_movement ''The Mindfulness Movement''], Skeptical Inquirer, Volume 41.3, May/June 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter approach, mindfulness, understood as "the awareness that arises by paying attention on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally", is the central practice, instead of ''vipassana''.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Kabat-Zinn (2013), ''Full Catastrophe Living (Revised Edition)'', p.XXXV&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meditation techniques==
[[File:Meditation Suan 01 .jpg|thumb|right|Insight Meditation Practice at Dhammadrops Foundation, [[Chiang Mai]].]]

The vipassanā movement emphasizes the use of [[vipassanā]] to gain insight into the [[three marks of existence]] as the main means to attain [[Wisdom in Buddhism|wisdom]] and the total liberation from ''dukkha''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Analayo, ''The Dynamics of Theravāda Insight Meditation'', Centre for Buddhist Studies, University of Hamburg Dharma Drum Buddhist College, Taiwan.&lt;/ref&gt; The practices are based on the ''[[Satipatthana sutta]]'', the ''[[Visuddhimagga]]'', and other texts, emphasizing ''[[satipatthana]]'' and bare insight.{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=890}}{{sfn|McMahan|2008|p=189}}&lt;ref name="Chapman"&gt;David Chapman, [https://vividness.live/2011/07/07/theravada-reinvents-meditation/ ''Theravada reinvents meditation'' ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cousins, Lance. The Origins of Insight Meditation&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|[[Buddhadasa]] rejected the reliance on the ''Satipatthana sutta'' as being "vague and muddled," instead relying on the ''[[Anapanasati Sutta]]''.&lt;ref name="Chapman"/&gt; According to Buddhadasa, the aim of mindfulness is to stop the arising of disturbing thoughts and emotions, which arise from sense-contact.{{sfn|Buddhadasa Bhikkhu|2014|p=79, 101, 117 note 42}}}}

The various movements espouse forms of [[samatha]] and vipassanā meditation. The various vipassana teachers also make use of the scheme of the  [[Vipassanā-ñāṇa|insight knowledges]], stages of insight which every practitioner passes through in their progress of meditation.{{refn|group=note|name=insightknowledges|The Dynamics of Theravāda Insight Meditation by Analyo, "The key position accorded to this scheme in each of these three meditation traditions is reflected in the detailed treatments of the insight knowledges in Mahāsi (1994, 13-32) and Pa Auk (2003, 255-277). Goenka covers the same ground in detail in his talks during long courses, which have not been published. Nevertheless, a brief survey of the insight knowledges by another student of U Ba Khin can be found in Chit Tin (1989, 121f)."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;}} The foundation for this progress is the meditation on the arising and passing away of all contemplated phenomena ([[anicca]]), which leads to an understanding of their unsatisfactory ([[dukkha]]) nature and insight into not-self ([[anatta]]).

==Burma==
[[File:GlobalVipasanaPagoda.JPG|thumb|right|[[Global Vipassana Pagoda]], a Burmese style pagoda in [[Mumbai]] where Vipassana meditation is taught in the tradition of [[Ba Khin]].]]
Contemporary [[Buddhism in Burma|Burmese Theravāda Buddhism]] is one of the main creators of modern vipassanā practice, which has gained popularity from the 1950s onward.

===Ledi Sayadaw===
[[Ledi Sayadaw]] (1846 – 1923) prepared the ground for the popularisation of meditation by a lay audience, by re-introducing the practice of meditation, based on the Abhidhamma.{{sfn|Chapman|2011}} 

====S.N. Goenka====
[[S. N. Goenka]] (1924 - 2013) was a well-known teacher in the Ledi-lineage who was taught by Sayagyi U [[Ba Khin]] (1899-1971). According to S. N. Goenka, vipassanā techniques are essentially non-sectarian in character, and have universal application. One need not convert to Buddhism to practice these styles of meditation. Meditation centers teaching the vipassanā popularized by S. N. Goenka exist now in Nepal, India, other parts of Asia, North and South America, Europe, Australia, Middle East and Africa. In the tradition of S.N.Goenka, vipassanā practice focuses on the deep interconnection between mind and body, which can be experienced directly by disciplined attention to the physical sensations that form the life of the body, and that continuously interconnect and condition the life of the mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torana.dhamma.org/introvp.html |title='&amp;#39;Vipassana Meditation: As taught by S. N. Goenka in the tradition of Sayagyi U Ba Khin'&amp;#39; |publisher=Torana.dhamma.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The practice is usually taught in 10-day retreats, in which 3 days are given to the practice of anapanasati, intended to increase consistency and precision of attention, and the rest of the time is given to vipassanā in the form of "body sweep" practice in which the meditator moves through the body in sections, or as a whole, paying attention to the various sensations that arise without reacting to them. According to Bhikkhu Analayo, "this form of meditation has by now become what probably is the most widely taught form of insight meditation world-wide." &lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Analayo, The Dynamics of Theravāda Insight Meditation&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other teachers====
[[Ruth Denison]] (1922 – 2015) was another senior teacher of the [[U Ba Khin]] method. [[Anagarika Munindra]] studied with both S.N. Goenka and Mahasi Sayadaw, and combined both lineages. [[Dipa Ma]] was a student of his.{{sfn|Chapman|2011}}

===The Mahasi ("New Burmese") Method===

====Teachers====
The "New Burmese method"{{sfn|Sharf|1995|p=255}} was developed by [[U Nārada]] (1868–1955) and popularized by his student. [[Mahasi Sayadaw]] (1904-1982) It was introduced to Sri Lanka in 1939, but became popular in the 1950s with the arrival of Burmese monks,{{sfn|Sharf|1995|p=256}} where it gained great popularity among the laiti, but was also severely criticised because of its disregard of ''samatta''.{{sfn|Sharf|1995|p=263}} Most senior western vipassana teachers (Goldstein, Kornfield, Salzberg) studied with Mahasi Sayadaw and his student [[Sayadaw U Pandita]].{{sfn|Fronsdal|1998}} [[Nyanaponika Thera]] (1901–1994) ordained already in the fifties, contributing to the interest in ''vipassana'' with his publications. Prominent teacher [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]] is a student of Nyanaponika.

Ajahn Tong was a Thai master who studied for a short time under [[Mahasi Sayadaw]] before returning to found his own Vipassana lineage at Chom Tong in Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sirimangalo.org/bio/|title=Biography of Ajahn Tong}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Practice====
The "New Burmese Method" disregards the practice of ''samatta'', and emphasises the attainment of ''vipassana'', insight, by practising ''sartipatthana'', paying close attention to the ongoing changes in body and mind. Gil Fronsdal: 
{{quote|An important feature of the “Mahasi approach” is its dispensing with the traditional preliminary practice of fixed concentration or tranquilization (appana samadhi, [[samatha]]). Instead, the meditator practices vipassana exclusively during intensive periods of silent retreat that can last several months with a daily schedule of meditation from 3:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. Two key elements in Mahasi’s method for developing mindfulness are the careful labeling of one’s immediate experience together with the cultivation of a high level of sustained concentration known as “momentary concentration”(khanika samadhi).{{sfn|Fronsdal|1998}}}}

Nyanaponika Thera coined the term "bare attention" for the mindfulness practice of the "new Burmese Method." Yet, Robert H. Sharf notes that Buddhist practice is aimed at the attainment of "correct view", not just "bare attention":
{{quote|Mahasi’s technique did not require familiarity with Buddhist doctrine (notably abhidhamma), did not require adherence to strict ethical norms (notably monasticism), and promised astonishingly quick results. This was made possible through interpreting sati as a state of "bare awareness" — the unmediated, non-judgmental perception of things "as they are," uninflected by prior psychological, social, or cultural conditioning. This notion of mindfulness is at variance with premodern Buddhist epistemologies in several respects. Traditional Buddhist practices are oriented more toward acquiring "correct view" and proper ethical discernment, rather than "no view" and a non-judgmental attitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.mcgill.ca/tcpsych/tag/geoffrey-samuel/|title=» Geoffrey Samuel Transcultural Psychiatry|author=|date=|website=blogs.mcgill.ca|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Other Burmese teachers===

====Mogok Sayadaw====
[[Mogok Sayadaw]] (1899-1962) taught the importance of the awareness of noticing the 'arising' and 'Passing away' of all experience as the way to gain insight into impermanence. Mogok Sayadaw emphasized the importance of right understanding and that a meditator should learn the theory of [[Dependent Origination]] (Paticcasamuppada) when practicing vipassana. The Mogok vipassana Method focuses on meditation of Feeling (Vedanannupassana) and meditation on Mind states (Cittanupassana).

====Pa Auk Sayadaw====
The method of Pa Auk Sayadaw is closely based on the [[Visuddhimagga]], a classic Theravada meditation manual. Pa Auk promotes the extensive development of the four [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|jhanas]], states of meditative absorption and focus. The insight element is based on surveying the body by observing the four elements (earth, water, fire and wind) by using the sensations of hardness, heaviness, warmth and motion.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; Western teachers who work with this method include [[Shaila Catherine]], Stephen Snyder and Tina Rasmussen.

==Thai Forest Tradition==
{{Main|Kammaṭṭhāna Forest Tradition}}
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}
Comparable developments took place within Thai Theravada Buddhism, yet with somewhat different textual, doctrinal and practical stances. [[Mun Bhuridatta]], the founder of the Thai Forest tradition, also sought to re-introduce the practice of meditation. 

While not a lay movement, the [[Thai Forest Tradition]] has been influential in the development of the lay meditation movements. This is a tradition of [[Buddhist monasticism]] within Thai [[Theravāda Buddhism]] which was in part a reaction against this perceived dilution in Buddhism. Practitioners inhabit remote wilderness and forest dwellings as spiritual practice training grounds.  It is widely known among Thai people for its orthodoxy, conservatism, and strict adherence to monastic rules (''[[vinaya]]'').

Perhaps its most widely known representative was [[Ajahn Chah]]; [[Jack Kornfield]], one of the main western teachers of Insight meditation, trained as a monk under [[Ajahn Chah]]. [[Ajahn Sumedho]] is the senior Western representative of the Thai forest tradition, he was the abbot of Amaravati Buddhist Monastery (1984-2010). A well-known American monk in this tradition is [[Thanissaro Bhikkhu|Ṭhānissaro Bhikkhu]], abbot of Metta Forest Monastery in [[San Diego County]]. Western representatives of the Thai forest tradition are known to teach lay practitioners at the monasteries and to visit lay meditation centers to teach.

Another influential scholar-monk was [[Buddhadasa]], who gave his own original interpretation of key teachings, rejecting the classical rebirth-doctrine, and emphasizing liberation from ''dukkha'' in this life.

==United States and western world==
Since the early 1980s, insight meditation has gained a growing popularity in the western world,{{sfn|Fronsdal|1998}} and saw a synthesis of various practices and backgrounds, with the growing insight in its roots and doctrinal background, and the introduction of other modern traditions. A major developments is the popularisation of mindfulness as a technique of its own.

===Establishment===
[[File:Retreat Meditation Hall at Spirit Rock.jpg|thumb|[[Spirit Rock Meditation Center]] founded by Kornfield in 1987]]

[[Jack Kornfield]] and [[Joseph Goldstein (writer)|Joseph Goldstein]] taught a series of classes at [[Naropa University]] in 1974, and began teaching a series of retreats together for the next two years. The retreats were modeled on 10- and 30-day Goenka retreats, but the technique taught was mainly based on Mahasi Sayadaw's practice (with the inclusion of [[Metta]] meditation).{{sfn|Fronsdal|1998}} In 1976 Kornfield and Goldstein, along with Sharon Salzberg and Jacqueline Schwartz founded the Insight Meditation Society in Barre, [[Massachusetts]], followed by its sister center, Spirit Rock Meditation Center in Marin County, California.{{sfn|Fronsdal|1998}} 

===New developments===
Kornfield, and related teachers, tend to de-emphasize the religious elements of Buddhism such as "rituals, chanting, devotional and merit-making activities, and doctrinal studies" and focus on meditative practice. According to Jack Kornfield, 
{{quote|We wanted to offer the powerful practices of insight meditation, as many of our teachers did, as simply as possible without the complications of rituals, robes, chanting and the whole religious tradition.{{sfn|Fronsdal|1998}}}}

Some teachers adhere to a strict 'Burmese approach', in which meditation is equated with ''kasina'' (concentration) meditation, and vipassana is the main aim. Others, like Bhikkhu Thannissaro, who trained in Thailand, criticise the Burmese orthodoxy, and propagate an integrative approach, in which samatha and vipassana are developed in tandem. Kornfield, who trained in both Burma and Thailand, also propagates an integrative approach.

A main criticism of the Burmese method is it's reliance on the commentatorial literature, in which  vipassana is separated from samatha, and ''jhana'' is equated with concentration meditation.Thanissaro Bhikkhu stresses the fact that the kasina-method is marginally treated in the suttas, in which the emphasis is predominantly on ''jhana''. In the suttas, ''samatha'' and ''vipassana'' are qualities of the mind which are developed together. This point is also reiterated by Shankman, arguing that samatha and vipassana cannot be separated. 

Groundbreaking research on early Buddhist meditation has been conducted by Bronkhorst,{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}} Vetter,{{sfn|Vetter|1988}} Gethin,{{sfn|Gethin|1992}}{{sfn|Gethin|2004}} Gombrich,{{refn|group=note|Wynne 2007, p.140 note 58;{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=140, note 58}} original publication: {{Citation | last =Gombrich | first =Richard | year =2007 | title =Religious Experience in Early Buddhism | publisher =OCHS Library | url =http://www.ochs.org.uk/lectures/religious-experience-early-buddhism}}}} and Wynne{{sfn|Wynne|2007}} arguing that ''jhana'' may have been the core practice of early Buddhism, and noting that this practice was not a form of concentration-meditation, but a cumulative practice resulting in mindful awareness of objects while being indifferent to it.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=106-107; 140, note 58}} Polak, elaborating on Vetter, notes that the onset of the first ''dhyana'' is described as a quite natural process, due to the preceding efforts to restrain the senses and the [[Four Right Exertions|nurturing of wholesome states]].{{sfn|Polak|2011}}{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=XXV}} Recently Keren Arbel, elaborating on Bronkhorst, vetter and Gethin, has argued that mindfulness, jhana, samatha and vipassana form an integrated whole, leading to an alert, joyful and compassionate state of mind and being.{{sfn|Arbel|2017}} Polak and  Arbel, following Gethin, further note that there is a "definite affinity" between the four ''jhanas'' and the ''[[Seven Factors of Enlightenment|bojjhaṅgā]]'', the seven factors of awakening.{{sfn|Gethin|1992|p=162-182}}{{sfn|Gethin|2004|p=217, note 26}}{{sfn|Polak|2011|p=25}}{{sfn|Arbel|2017}}

===Mindfulness===
The "bare attention" propagated in the New Burmese Method has been popularized as mindfulness, starting with Jon Kabat Zinn's [[MBSR]], developed in the late 1970s.{{sfn|Fronsdal|1998}}

==Prominent women==
Women have been quite prominent as teachers in the vipassanā movement. Though the formal Theravāda vipassanā tradition has been maintained by an almost exclusively male monastic tradition, nuns and non-monastic female adepts have played important roles, despite being completely absent or only noted in the background of the historical record.  These teachers and practitioners expand the framework of vipassanā to incorporate the immanence of the female body and its innate opportunities for enlightenment through the cycles of its physiology and the emotions of marriage, childlessness, childbearing, child loss, and widowhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elephantjournal.com/2009/02/yogini-sarah-powers-shiva-rea-and-lama-tsultrim-allione-speak-about-the-path-of-women-teaching-yoga-and-buddhism/ |title=Yogini: Sarah Powers, Shiva Rea &amp; Lama Tsultrim Allione Speak About the Path of Women Teaching Yoga &amp; Buddhism. |publisher=elephant journal |date=2012-01-20 |accessdate=2014-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dipa Ma===
The modern Bangladeshi teacher [[Dipa Ma]], a student of [[Anagarika Munindra]], was one of the first female Asian masters to be invited to teach in America.  As a widowed, single mother, Dipa Ma was a householder (non-monastic) who exemplified liberation and taught vipassanā as not only a retreat practice but also a lifestyle.  Her message to women and men was you don't have to leave your family to reach high states of spiritual understanding, and she taught a radical inclusiveness.  She encouraged women who were mothers of young children to practice vipassanā through the daily activities of mothering.  She once said to Joseph Goldstein that "Women have an advantage over men because they have more supple minds... It may be difficult for men to understand this, because they are men."  When asked if there was any hope for men, she replied "The Buddha was a man, and Jesus was a man. So there is hope for you."&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Amy. ''Dipa Ma:  The Life &amp; Legacy of a Buddhist Master'' Blue Bridge Books, 2005, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dipa Ma's [[mettā]] (loving-kindness) meditation instruction was a core component to be practiced after each vipassanā session. It involves five stages, the first of which was the mastery of [[self-compassion]] in mind and heart, then continuing to the other stages. The prayer of the first stage, given in English is as follows:

{{quote|Let me be free of enemies&lt;br&gt;
Let me be free of dangers&lt;br&gt;
Let me be free of mental anxieties&lt;br&gt;
Let me pass my time with good body and happy mind.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Amy. ''Dipa Ma:  The Life &amp; Legacy of a Buddhist Master'' Blue Bridge Books, 2005, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Ilaichidevi Goenka===
Indian teacher [[Ilaichidevi Goenka]], was a wife of the Burmese-trained [[S. N. Goenka]] and mother of six children, began practicing adhittan vipassanā when her youngest child was four years old,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.udaya.dhamma.org/ebook/Sayagyi_U_Ba_Khin_Journal/Interview_with_Mataji.html&lt;/ref&gt; eventually joining her husband on the teaching platform as co-teacher to thousands of students at retreat centers and [[prison]]s all over India as well as internationally. Prisoners who do vipassanā meditation reportedly experience less behavior problems while incarcerated and have lower rates of recidivism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vids.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&amp;VideoID=57844573|title=Featured Content on Myspace|author=|date=|website=myspace.com|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Mataji", as she is lovingly referred to by her students, also used to lead chants with her husband.

===Shambhavi Chopra===
Indian [[Shambhavi Chopra]], a former textiles designer and divorced mother of two who is now co-director of the American Institute of Vedic Studies, writes of her 10-day vipassanā meditation training at a retreat center in Germany in her book ''Yogini:  The Enlightened Woman'',&lt;ref&gt;Chopra, Shambhavi. Yogini: The Enlightened Woman, Wisdom Tree Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and encourages students to explore vipassanā practice and mastery as a devotion to the Divine Mother of all.

==Vipassanā in prisons==
{{Main|Prison contemplative programs}}
Vipassanā movement traditions have offered meditation programs in some prisons. One notable example was in 1993 when [[Kiran Bedi]], a reformist Inspector General of India's prisons, learned of the success of vipassanā in a jail in [[Jaipur]], [[Rajasthan]]. A ten-day retreat involved officials and inmates alike was then tried in India's largest prison [[Tihar Jail]] near New Delhi. Vipassana is being taught in Jail 4 of Tihar Prisons to inmates in two ten day courses every month around the year since 1994 onwards. This program was said to have dramatically changed the behavior of inmates and jailers alike. Inmates who completed the ten-day course were less violent and had a lower [[recidivism]] rate than other inmates. This project was documented in the documentary film, ''[[Doing Time, Doing Vipassana]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prison.dhamma.org/dtdv.htm |title=Doing Time, Doing Vipassana review |publisher=Prison.dhamma.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zenodotus''' ({{IPAc-en|z|ə|ˈ|n|ɒ|d|ə|t|ə|s}}; {{lang-el|Ζηνόδοτος}}; fl. 150 BC) was a [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosopher. He was a pupil of [[Diogenes of Babylon]]. All information about him comes from [[Diogenes Laertius]], everything else has been lost.

==Poetry==
[[Diogenes Laertius]] recorded the epitaph Zenodotus wrote for [[Zeno of Citium]]:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.attalus.org/old/diogenes7a.html#30 ''The Lives of the Philosophers'' by Diogenes Laertius. Book: Life of Zeno, Section 30]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|You made contentment the chief rule of life,

Despising haughty wealth, O God-like Zenon.

With solemn look, and hoary brow serene,

You taught a manly doctrine; and didst found

By your deep wisdom, a great novel school,

Chaste parent of unfearing liberty.

And if your country was Phoenicia,

Why need we grieve, from that land Cadmus came,

Who gave to Greece her written books of wisdom.}}

==Dedications==
[[Chrysippus]] dedicated a two-book treatise on Proverbs to Zenodotus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://attalus.org/old/diogenes7d.html#200 ''The Lives of the Philosophers'' by Diogenes Laertius. Book: Lives of Stoic Philosophers, Section 200]&lt;/ref&gt;
