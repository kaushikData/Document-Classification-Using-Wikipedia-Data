Etymology: Greek; 'allo' = other, and 'chthon' = earth.

In [[limnology]], allochthonous sources of carbon or nutrients come from outside the aquatic system (such as plant and soil material).  Carbon sources from within the system, such as algae and the microbial breakdown of aquatic particulate organic carbon, are autochthonous. In aquatic food webs, the portion of biomass derived from allochthonous material is then named "allochthony".&lt;ref&gt;Grosbois, G., del Giorgio, P.A. &amp; Rautio, M. (2017).

Appraisal Reductions were created in response to [[rating agency]] concerns that, without such an adjustment, cash flow from [[mortgages]] likely to default would be paid to the first-loss class.  The rationale behind appraisal reductions is to support proactively the credit rating of senior [[Commercial mortgage-backed security|CMBS]] [[tranche]]s by reducing cash-flow payments to the subordinate [[tranche]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4336">The '''Archimedean Oath''' is an ethical code of practice for engineers and technicians, similar to the [[Hippocratic Oath]] used in the medical world. It was proposed in 1990 by a group of students of the [[École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne]]. The Archimedean Oath has since spread to a number of European engineering schools.

"Considering the life of [[Archimedes of Syracuse]] who illustrated the ambiguous potential of technology since the Antiquity,&lt;br /&gt;
Considering the growing responsibility of engineers and scientists towards men and nature,&lt;br /&gt;
Considering the importance of the ethical problems stemming from technology and its applications,&lt;br /&gt;
Today, I commit to the following statements and shall endeavor to reach towards the ideal that they represent:
*I shall practice for the good of mankind, respecting human rights{{sup|1}} and the environment.
*I shall recognize the responsibility for my actions, after informing myself to the best of my abilities, and shall in no case discharge my responsibilities on another person
*I shall endeavor to perfect my professional abilities
*When choosing and implementing projects, I shall remain wary of their context and their consequences, notably in their technical, economic, social and ecological aspects. I shall give particular attention to projects with military applications.
*I shall contribute, to the extent of my abilities, to promote equitable relationships between men and to support the development of economically weaker countries.
*I shall transmit, with rigor and honesty, to discerningly chosen interlocutors, any important information, if it constitutes a gain for society or if its retention constitutes a danger for others. In the latter case, I shall ensure that the communication yields concrete action.
*I shall not let myself be governed by the defense of my own interests or those of my corporation.
*I shall endeavor, to the best of my abilities, to lead my company to take into account the preoccupations of the present oath.
*I shall practice my profession in complete intellectual honesty, with conscience and dignity.
I solemnly take this oath, freely and on my honor."

"I commit to keeping completely, to the full extent of my capacities and judgment, the following promises:
*I shall use my knowledge for the benefit of mankind.
*I shall not put my skill to the service of people who do not respect human rights.
*I shall not permit consideration regarding religion, nationality, race, sex, wealth and politics to harm people affected by my actions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4429">'''Arterial spin labeling''' (ASL), also known as '''arterial spin tagging''', is a [[MRI|magnetic resonance imaging]] method for measuring [[perfusion]] using water already in the subject as tracers by setting and tracking magnetic spin. [[Perfusion MRI]] is [[perfusion scanning]] by the use of a particular [[MRI sequence]]. ASL specifically refers to magnetic labeling of [[arterial blood]] below the imaging slab, without the need of [[gadolinium contrast]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first1 = Francis | last1 = Fortin | first2 = Frank | last2 = Gaillard | name-list-format = vanc | url = https://radiopaedia.org/articles/arterial-spin-labelling-asl-mr-perfusion-1 | title = Arterial spin labelling (ASL) MR perfusion |website=[[Radiopaedia]]|access-date=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; instead inferring perfusion from a drop in signal observed in the imaging slice arising from inflowing [[spins]] (outside the imaging slice) having been selectively saturated. A number of ASL schemes are possible, the simplest being flow alternating inversion recovery (FAIR) which requires two acquisitions of identical parameters with the exception of the out-of-slice saturation; the difference in the two images is theoretically only from inflowing spins, and may be considered a 'perfusion [[Brain mapping|map]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://fmri.research.umich.edu/research/main_topics/asl.php |title=Arterial spin labeling |website= [[University of Michigan]] |access-date=2017-10-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The technique was developed by John Detre, Alan P. Koretsky and coworkers in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koretsky AP | title = Early development of arterial spin labeling to measure regional brain blood flow by MRI | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 62 | issue = 2 | pages = 602–7 | date = August 2012 | pmid = 22245338 | pmc = 4199083 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.01.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinical use==
In [[cerebral infarction]], the [[penumbra (medicine)|penumbra]] has decreased perfusion.&lt;ref name="Chen2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen F, Ni YC | title = Magnetic resonance diffusion-perfusion mismatch in acute ischemic stroke: An update | journal = World Journal of Radiology | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 63–74 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 22468186 | doi = 10.4329/wjr.v4.i3.63 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides acute and chronic neurovascular diseases, the value of ASL has been demonstrated in [[brain tumors]], [[epilepsy]] and [[neurodegenerative disease]], such as [[Alzheimer’s disease]], [[frontotemporal dementia]] and [[Parkinson disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Grade M, Hernandez Tamames JA, Pizzini FB, Achten E, Golay X, Smits M | title = A neuroradiologist's guide to arterial spin labeling MRI in clinical practice | journal = Neuroradiology | volume = 57 | issue = 12 | pages = 1181–202 | date = December 2015 | pmid = 26351201 | pmc = 4648972 | doi = 10.1007/s00234-015-1571-z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the primary form of [[fMRI]] uses the [[blood-oxygen-level dependent]] (BOLD) contrast,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Huettel SA, Song AW, McCarthy G | year = 2009 | title = Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging | edition = 2nd | location = Sunderland, Massachusetts | publisher = Sinauer Associates | page = 26 | isbn = 978-0-87893-286-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ASL is another method of obtaining contrast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Detre JA, Rao H, Wang DJ, Chen YF, Wang Z | title = Applications of arterial spin labeled MRI in the brain | journal = Journal of Magnetic Resonance Imaging | volume = 35 | issue = 5 | pages = 1026–37 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22246782 | pmc = 3326188 | doi = 10.1002/jmri.23581 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety==
ASL is in general a safe technique, although injuries may occur as a result of failed safety procedures or human error like other MRI techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Watson|first=Robert E. | name-list-format = vanc |date=2015-10-01|title=Lessons Learned from MRI Safety Events|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40134-015-0122-z|journal=Current Radiology Reports|language=en|volume=3|issue=10|pages=37|doi=10.1007/s40134-015-0122-z|issn=2167-4825}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Beltian body''' is a detachable tip found on the pinnules of some species of ''[[Acacia]]'' and closely related genera. Beltian bodies, named after [[Thomas Belt]], are rich in lipids, sugars and proteins and often red in colour. They are believed to have evolved in a symbiotic relationship with [[ant]]s. The ants live inside special plant structures ([[Domatia]]) or near the plant and keep away [[herbivore]]s.

'''Bode's sensitivity integral''', discovered by [[Hendrik Wade Bode]], is a formula that quantifies some of the limitations in [[feedback]] control of linear parameter invariant systems. Let ''L'' be the loop [[transfer function]] and ''S'' be the sensitivity function. Then the following holds:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty \ln |S(j \omega)| d \omega = \int_0^\infty \ln \left| \frac{1}{1+L(j \omega)} \right| d \omega = \pi \sum Re(p_k) - \frac{\pi}{2} \lim_{s\rightarrow\infty} s L(s)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;p_k&lt;/math&gt; are the [[Pole (complex analysis)|poles]] of ''L'' in the right half plane (unstable poles).

If ''L'' has at least two more poles than [[Zero (complex analysis)|zeros]], and has no poles in the right half plane (is stable), the equation simplifies to:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty \ln |S(j \omega)| d \omega = 0&lt;/math&gt;

This equality shows that if sensitivity to disturbance is suppressed at some frequency range, it is necessarily increased at some other range. This has been called the "waterbed effect."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-245-multivariable-control-systems-spring-2004/lecture-notes/lec5_6245_2004.pdf Megretski: The Waterbed Effect.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2502">'''Born–von Karman boundary conditions''' are [[periodic boundary conditions]] which impose the restriction that a [[wave function]] must be [[periodic function|periodic]] on a certain [[Bravais lattice]].  (Named after [[Max Born]] and [[Theodore von Karman|Theodore von Kármán]]). This condition is often applied in [[solid state physics]] to model an ideal [[crystal]].  Born and von Karman 
published a series of articles in 1912 and 1913 that presented one of the first theories of specific heat of solids 
based on the crystaline hypothesis and included these boundary conditions.  

The condition can be stated as

: &lt;math&gt; \psi(\mathbf{r}+N_i \mathbf{a}_i)=\psi(\mathbf{r}), \, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''i'' runs over the dimensions of the [[Bravais lattice]], the '''a'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are the primitive vectors of the lattice, and the ''N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are integers (assuming the lattice has ''N'' cells where ''N=N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'').  This definition can be used to show that

: &lt;math&gt; \psi(\mathbf{r}+\mathbf{T})=\psi(\mathbf{r}) &lt;/math&gt;

for any lattice translation vector '''T''' such that:

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{T} = \sum_i N_i \mathbf{a}_i. &lt;/math&gt;

Note, however, the Born–von Karman boundary conditions are useful when ''N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are large (infinite). 

The Born–von Karman boundary condition is important in solid state physics for analyzing many features of crystals, such as [[diffraction]] and the [[Electronic band structure|band gap]].  Modeling the [[potential]] of a crystal as a periodic function with the Born–von Karman boundary condition and plugging in [[Schrödinger equation|Schrödinger's equation]] results in a proof of [[Bloch wave|Bloch's theorem]], which is particularly important in understanding the band structure of crystals.

'''Sir Enoch Bruce Levy''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|OBE}} (19 February 1892 &amp;ndash; 16 October 1985) was a [[botanist]] from New Zealand who became widely known for his work on improving pastures.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;&lt;ref name=r2/&gt;

==Biography==
Levy was born in [[Auckland]] in 1892, and lived on a farm until he was 18 years old. He joined the [[New Zealand Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry|New Zealand Department of Agriculture]] in 1911, and studied science at [[Victoria University of Wellington|Victoria University]] in [[Wellington]] from 1926 to 1928. In 1925 he married schoolteacher Phyllis Rosa Kate Mason.

In 1937 he founded the Grasslands Division of the [[Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (New Zealand)|Department of Scientific and Industrial Research]], and was Director of that division until he retired in 1951. During that time he travelled all over New Zealand, helping farmers to improve their pastures based on techniques that he had learned in Europe. After retiring, he worked on improving the turf of golf courses and bowling greens.

Levy was the author of ''Construction, Renovation and Care of the Bowling Green'' (1949); ''Construction, Renovation and Care of the Golf Course'' (1950); and ''Grasslands of New Zealand'' (1951).

In the [[1950 Birthday Honours (New Zealand)|1950 King's Birthday Honours]] he was made an [[Order of the British Empire|Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] for services to agriculture in connection with grassland research.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=38931 |date=8 June 1950 |page=2814 |supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed a [[Knight Bachelor]] in the [[1953 Coronation Honours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=39866 |date=26 May 1953 |pages=3003–3006  |supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Canadian Bioinformatics Workshops''' (CBW) are a series of advanced training workshops in [[bioinformatics]], founded in 1999 in response to an identified need for a skilled bioinformatics workforce in [[Canada]].

==1999-2007==

The Canadian Bioinformatics Workshops series began offering one and two week short courses in bioinformatics, genomics and proteomics in 1999, in response to an identified need for a skilled bioinformatics workforce in Canada. In partnership with the Canadian Genetics Diseases Network and Human Resources Development Canada, and under the scientific direction of Director, Francis Ouellette, the CBW series was established.

For eight years, the series offered short courses in bioinformatics, genomics and proteomics in various cities across Canada. The courses were taught by top faculty from Canada and the US, and offered small classes and hands-on instruction.

==2007-Present==

In 2007, the Canadian Bioinformatics Workshops moved to Toronto, where it is now hosted by the [[Ontario Institute for Cancer Research]]. A new format and series of workshops were designed in the fall of 2007. It was recognized that with the introduction of new technologies and scientific approaches to research, having the computational biology capacity and skill to deal with this new data has become an even greater asset.

The new series of workshops focuses on training the experts and users of these advanced technologies on the latest approaches used in computational biology to deal with the new data.  The Canadian Bioinformatics Workshops began offering the 2-day advanced topic workshops in 2008.

All workshop material is licensed under a [[Creative Commons license|Creative Commons-Share Alike 2.5 license]] and is available on the [http://bioinformatics.ca/ Bioinformatics.ca] website.

The CBW is sponsored by the Canadian Institute of Health Research and the [[Ontario Institute for Cancer Research]].

==Bioinformatics Links Directory==

The Canadian Bioinformatics Workshops also hosts [[Bioinformatics Links Directory]] which contains links to molecular resources, tools and databases. The links listed in this directory are from a myriad of sources, selected on the basis of recommendations from bioinformatics experts in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkq553| title = Providing web servers and training in Bioinformatics: 2010 update on the Bioinformatics Links Directory| journal = Nucleic Acids Research| volume = 38| issue = Web Server issue| pages = W3–6| year = 2010| last1 = Brazas | first1 = M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17891">{{short description|Wave traveling along the phase boundary of a fluid, whose dynamics and phase velocity are dominated by the effects of surface tension}}
{{about|ripples on fluid interfaces|ripples in electricity|Ripple (electrical)|other uses|Ripple (disambiguation)}}
[[File:2006-01-14 Surface waves.jpg|thumb|Capillary wave (ripple) in water]]
[[File:Ripples Lifjord.jpg|thumb|Ripples on Lifjord in [[Øksnes]], [[Norway]]]]
[[File:Multy droplets impact.JPG|thumb|Capillary waves produced by [[droplet]] impacts on the interface between water and air.]]

A '''capillary wave''' is a [[wave]] traveling along the [[phase boundary]] of a fluid, whose [[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] and [[phase velocity]] are dominated by the effects of [[surface tension]].

Capillary waves are common in [[nature]], and are often referred to as '''ripples'''.  The [[wavelength]] of capillary waves on water is typically less than a few centimeters, with a [[phase speed]] in excess of 0.2–0.3 meter/second.

A longer wavelength on a fluid interface will result in '''gravity–capillary waves''' which are influenced by both the effects of surface tension and [[standard gravity|gravity]], as well as by fluid [[inertia]]. Ordinary [[gravity wave]]s have a still longer wavelength.

When generated by light wind in open water, a nautical name for them is '''cat's paw''' waves, since they may resemble paw prints. Light breezes which stir up such small ripples are also sometimes referred to as cat's paws. On the open ocean, much larger [[wind wave|ocean surface wave]]s ([[Wind wave|seas]] and [[swell (ocean)|swell]]s) may result from coalescence of smaller wind-caused ripple-waves.

==Dispersion relation==
The [[dispersion relation]] describes the relationship between [[wavelength]] and [[frequency]] in waves. Distinction can be made between pure capillary waves – fully dominated by the effects of surface tension – and gravity–capillary waves which are also affected by gravity.

===Capillary waves, proper===
The dispersion relation for capillary waves is

:&lt;math&gt;
\omega^2=\frac{\sigma}{\rho+\rho'}\, |k|^3,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''ω'' is the [[angular frequency]], ''σ'' the [[surface tension]], ''ρ'' the [[density]] of the 
heavier fluid, ''ρ''' the density of the lighter fluid and ''k'' the [[wavenumber]]. The [[wavelength]] is 
&lt;math&gt;
\lambda=\frac{2 \pi}{k}.&lt;/math&gt;
For the boundary between fluid and vacuum (free surface), the dispersion relation reduces to
:&lt;math&gt;
\omega^2=\frac{\sigma}{\rho}\, |k|^3.&lt;/math&gt;

===Gravity–capillary waves===
[[File:Dispersion capillary.svg|thumb|right|Dispersion of gravity–capillary waves on the surface of deep water (zero mass density of upper layer, ''ρ′&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0''). Phase and group velocity divided by &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \sqrt[4]{g\sigma/\rho}&lt;/math&gt; as a function of inverse relative wavelength &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \frac{1}{\lambda}\sqrt{\sigma/(\rho g)}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br&gt;{{•}} Blue lines (A): phase velocity, Red lines (B): group velocity.&lt;br&gt;{{•}} Drawn lines: dispersion relation for gravity–capillary waves.&lt;br&gt;{{•}} Dashed lines: dispersion relation for deep-water gravity waves.&lt;br&gt;{{•}} Dash-dotted lines: dispersion relation valid for deep-water capillary waves.]]

In general, waves are also affected by gravity and are then called gravity–capillary waves. Their dispersion relation reads, for waves on the interface between two fluids of infinite depth:&lt;ref name=Lamb&gt;Lamb (1994), §267, page 458–460.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dingemans (1997), Section 2.1.1, p.&amp;nbsp;45.&lt;br&gt;Phillips (1977), Section 3.2, p.&amp;nbsp;37.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\omega^2=|k|\left( \frac{\rho-\rho'}{\rho+\rho'}g+\frac{\sigma}{\rho+\rho'}k^2\right),
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''g'' is the acceleration due to [[standard gravity|gravity]], ''ρ'' and ''ρ‘'' are the [[mass density]] of the two fluids (''ρ &gt; ρ‘''). The factor &lt;math&gt;(\rho-\rho')/(\rho+\rho')&lt;/math&gt; in the first term is the [[Atwood number]].

====Gravity wave regime====
{{further information|Airy wave theory}}

For large wavelengths (small ''k = 2π/λ''), only the first term is relevant and one has [[gravity wave]]s.
In this limit, the waves have a [[group velocity]] half the [[phase velocity]]: following a single wave's crest in a group one can see the wave appearing at the back of the group, growing and finally disappearing at the front of the group.

====Capillary wave regime====
Shorter (large ''k'') waves (e.g. 2&amp;nbsp;mm for the water–air interface), which are proper capillary waves, do the opposite: an individual wave appears at the front of the group, grows when moving towards the group center and finally disappears at the back of the group. Phase velocity is two thirds of group velocity in this limit.

====Phase velocity minimum====
Between these two limits is a point at which the dispersion caused by gravity cancels out the dispersion due to the capillary effect.  At a certain wavelength, the group velocity equals the phase velocity, and there is no dispersion. At precisely this same wavelength, the phase velocity of gravity–capillary waves as a function of wavelength (or wave number) has a minimum. Waves with wavelengths much smaller than this critical wavelength ''λ&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' are dominated by surface tension, and much above by gravity. The value of this wavelength and the associated minimum phase speed ''c&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' are:&lt;ref name=Lamb/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
  \lambda_m = 2 \pi \sqrt{ \frac{\sigma}{(\rho-\rho') g}}
  \quad \text{and} \quad

&lt;/math&gt;
For the [[air]]–[[water]] interface, ''λ&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' is found to be {{convert|1.7|cm|in|abbr=on}}, and ''c&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' is {{convert|0.23|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Lamb/&gt;

If one drops a small stone or droplet into liquid, the waves then propagate outside an expanding circle of fluid at rest; this circle is a [[caustic (optics)|caustic]] which corresponds to the minimal group velocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Falkovich |first=G. |title=Fluid Mechanics, a short course for physicists |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-107-00575-4 |nopp=yes |pages=Section 3.1 and Exercise 3.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Derivation====
As [[Richard Feynman]] put it, "''[water waves] that are easily seen by everyone and which are usually used as an example of waves in elementary courses [...] are the worst possible example [...]; they have all the complications that waves can have.''"&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Feynman|R.P. Feynman]], R.B. Leighton, and M. Sands (1963). ''[[The Feynman Lectures on Physics]].'' Addison-Wesley. Volume I, Chapter 51-4.&lt;/ref&gt; The derivation of the general dispersion relation is therefore quite involved.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Safran (1994) for a more detailed description.&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, first the assumptions involved are pointed out. There are three contributions to the energy, due to gravity, to [[surface tension]], and to [[hydrodynamics]]. The first two are potential energies, and responsible for the two terms inside the parenthesis, as is clear from the appearance of ''g'' and ''σ''. For gravity, an assumption is made of the density of the fluids being constant (i.e., incompressibility), and likewise ''g'' (waves are not high for gravitation to change appreciably). For surface tension, the deviations from planarity (as measured by derivatives of the surface) are supposed to be small. Both approximations are excellent for common waves.

The last contribution involves the [[kinetic energy|kinetic energies]] of the fluids, and is the most involved. One must use a [[hydrodynamics|hydrodynamic]] framework to tackle this problem. Incompressibility is again involved (which is satisfied if the speed of the waves is much less than the speed of sound in the media), together with the flow being [[irrotational]] – the flow is then
[[potential flow|potential]]; again, these are typically good approximations for common situations. The resulting equation for the potential (which is [[Laplace equation]]) can be solved with the proper boundary conditions. On one hand, the velocity must vanish well below the surface (in the "deep water" case, which is the one we consider, otherwise a more involved result is obtained, see [[Ocean surface wave#Science of waves|Ocean surface waves]].) On the other, its vertical component must match the motion of the surface. This contribution ends up being responsible for the extra  ''k'' outside the parenthesis, which causes '''all''' regimes to be dispersive, both at low values of ''k'', and high ones (except around the one value at which the two dispersions cancel out.)

!Dispersion relation for gravity–capillary waves on an interface between two semi–infinite fluid domains
|-
|Consider two fluid domains, separated by an interface with surface tension. The mean interface position is horizontal. It separates the upper from the lower fluid, both having a different constant mass density, ''ρ'' and ''ρ’'' for the lower and upper domain respectively. The fluid is assumed to be [[inviscid]] and [[incompressible]], and the flow is assumed to be [[irrotational]]. Then the flows are [[potential flow|potential]], and the velocity in the lower and upper layer can be obtained from '''''∇'''Φ'' and '''''∇'''Φ’'', respectively. Here ''Φ(x,y,z,t)'' and ''Φ’(x,y,z,t)'' are [[potential flow|velocity potentials]].

Three contributions to the energy are involved: the [[potential energy]] ''V&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'' due to [[standard gravity|gravity]], the potential energy ''V&lt;sub&gt;st&lt;/sub&gt;'' due to the [[surface tension]] and the [[kinetic energy]] ''T'' of the flow. The part ''V&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'' due to gravity is the simplest: integrating the potential energy density due to gravity, ''ρ g z'' (or ''ρ’ g z'') from a reference height to the position of the surface, ''z&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;η(x,y,t)'':&lt;ref&gt;Lamb (1994), §174 and §230.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
  V_\mathrm{g}
    = \iint dx\, dy\; \int_0^\eta dz\; (\rho - \rho') g z 
    = \frac{1}{2} (\rho-\rho') g \iint dx\, dy\; \eta^2,
&lt;/math&gt;

assuming the mean interface position is at ''z=0''.

An increase in area of the surface causes a proportional increase of energy due to surface tension:&lt;ref name=LambCap&gt;Lamb (1994), §266.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
  V_\mathrm{st}
  = \sigma \iint dx\, dy\;  
    \left[ 
      \sqrt{ 1 + \left( \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} \right)^2
               + \left( \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial y} \right)^2} 
      - 1
    \right]
  \approx \frac{1}{2} \sigma \iint dx\, dy\; 
    \left[ 
      \left( \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} \right)^2
      +
      \left( \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial y} \right)^2 
    \right],
&lt;/math&gt;

where the first equality is the area in this ([[Gaspard Monge|Monge]]'s) representation, and the second
applies for small values of the derivatives (surfaces not too rough).

The last contribution involves the [[kinetic energy]] of the fluid:&lt;ref name=LambKin&gt;Lamb (1994), §61.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
  T= 
  \frac{1}{2} \iint dx\, dy\;  
  \left[ 
    \int_{-\infty}^\eta dz\; \rho\,  \left| \mathbf\nabla \Phi  \right|^2
    +
    \int_\eta^{+\infty} dz\; \rho'\, \left| \mathbf\nabla \Phi' \right|^2
  \right].
&lt;/math&gt;

Use is made of the fluid being incompressible and its flow is irrotational (often, sensible approximations). As a result, both ''Φ(x,y,z,t)'' and ''Φ’(x,y,z,t)'' must satisfy the [[Laplace equation]]:&lt;ref&gt;Lamb (1994), §20&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 \Phi = 0&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; and &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 \Phi' = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

These equations can be solved with the proper boundary conditions: ''Φ'' and ''Φ’'' must vanish well away from the surface (in the "deep water" case, which is the one we consider).

Using [[Green's identity]], and assuming the deviations of the surface elevation to be small (so the ''z''–integrations may be approximated by integrating up to ''z=0'' instead of ''z=η''), the kinetic energy can be written as:&lt;ref name=LambKin/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
  T \approx
  \frac{1}{2} \iint dx\, dy\;  
  \left[
    \rho\,  \Phi\,  \frac{\partial \Phi }{\partial z}\; 
    -\; 
    \rho'\, \Phi'\, \frac{\partial \Phi'}{\partial z}
  \right]_{\text{at } z=0}.
&lt;/math&gt;

To find the dispersion relation, it is sufficient to consider a [[sinusoidal]] wave on the interface, propagating in the ''x''–direction:&lt;ref name=LambCap/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\eta = a\, \cos\, ( kx - \omega t) = a\, \cos\, \theta ,&lt;/math&gt;

with amplitude ''a'' and wave [[phase (waves)|phase]] ''θ = kx - ωt''. The kinematic boundary condition at the interface, relating the potentials to the interface motion, is that the vertical velocity components must match the motion of the surface:&lt;ref name=LambCap/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial\Phi}{\partial z} = \frac{\partial\eta}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;  &amp;nbsp; and &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial\Phi'}{\partial z} = \frac{\partial\eta}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; at ''z&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0''.

To tackle the problem of finding the potentials, one may try [[separation of variables]], when both fields can be expressed as:&lt;ref name=LambCap/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
  \Phi(x,y,z,t) &amp; = + \frac{1}{|k|} \text{e}^{+|k|z}\, 
                      \omega a\, \sin\, \theta,
  \\
  \Phi'(x,y,z,t)&amp; = - \frac{1}{|k|} \text{e}^{-|k|z}\, 
                      \omega a\, \sin\, \theta.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Then the contributions to the wave energy, horizontally integrated over one wavelength ''λ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2π/k'' in the ''x''–direction, and over a unit width in the ''y''–direction, become:&lt;ref name=LambCap/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lamb (1994), §230.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
  V_\text{g} &amp;= \frac{1}{4} (\rho-\rho') g a^2 \lambda,
  \\
  V_\text{st} &amp;= \frac{1}{4} \sigma k^2 a^2 \lambda,
  \\
  T &amp;= \frac{1}{4} (\rho+\rho') \frac{\omega^2}{|k|} a^2 \lambda.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The dispersion relation can now be obtained from the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] ''L = T - V'', with ''V'' the sum of the potential energies by gravity ''V&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'' and surface tension ''V&lt;sub&gt;st&lt;/sub&gt;'':&lt;ref name=Whitham&gt;{{cite book | first=G. B. | last=Whitham | authorlink=Gerald B. Whitham | title=Linear and nonlinear waves | publisher = Wiley-Interscience | year=1974 | isbn=0-471-94090-9 }} See section 11.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
  L = \frac{1}{4} \left[
      (\rho+\rho') \frac{\omega^2}{|k|} - (\rho-\rho') g - \sigma k^2
    \right] a^2 \lambda.
&lt;/math&gt;

For sinusoidal waves and linear wave theory, the [[averaged Lagrangian|phase–averaged Lagrangian]] is always of the form ''L&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;D(ω,k) a²'', so that variation with respect to the only free parameter, ''a'', gives the dispersion relation  ''D(ω,k)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0''.&lt;ref name=Whitham/&gt; In our case ''D(ω,k)'' is just the expression in the square brackets, so that the dispersion relation is:
:&lt;math&gt;
  \omega^2 = |k| \left( \frac{\rho-\rho'}{\rho+\rho'}\, g  + \frac{\sigma}{\rho+\rho'}\, k^2 \right),
&lt;/math&gt;

the same as above.

As a result, the average wave energy per unit horizontal area, ''( T + V ) / λ'', is:

:&lt;math&gt;
  \bar{E} = \frac{1}{2}\, \left[ (\rho-\rho')\, g + \sigma k^2 \right]\, a^2.
&lt;/math&gt;

As usual for linear wave motions, the potential and kinetic energy are equal (''[[equipartition theorem|equipartition]]'' holds): ''T&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;V''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=On progressive waves | author=Lord Rayleigh (J.

'''Consumer demand tests''' for animals are studies designed to measure the relative strength of an animal's motivation to obtain resources such as different food items.  The test results are analogous to human patterns of purchasing resources with a limited income.&lt;ref name="Lea, (1978)"&gt;Lea, S.E.G., (1978).  The psychology and economics of demand.  Psychological Bulletin, 85:441–466&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dawkins, (1983)"&gt;Dawkins, M.S., (1983). Battery hens name their price: consumer demand theory and the measurement of ethological "needs". Animal Behaviour, 31: 1195–1205&lt;/ref&gt; For humans, the cost of resources is usually measured in [[money]]; in animal studies the cost is usually represented by energy required, time taken or a risk of injury.&lt;ref name="Dawkins, (1990)"&gt;Dawkins, M.S., (1990). From an animal's point of view: motivation, fitness, and animal welfare. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 13: 1–61&lt;/ref&gt; Costs of resources can be imposed on animals by an operant task (e.g. lever-pressing), a natural aversion (e.g. crossing water), or a [[Homeostasis|homeostatic]] challenge (e.g. increased body temperature). Humans usually decrease the amount of an item purchased (or consumed) as the cost of that item increases.  Similarly, animals tend to consume less of an item as the cost of that item increases (e.g. more lever presses required).&lt;ref name="Duncan, (1992)"&gt;Duncan, I.J.H., (1992).  Measuring preferences and the strength of preferences.  Poultry Science, 71: 658–663&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherwin, (1996)"&gt;Sherwin, C.M., (1996). Laboratory mice persist in gaining access to resources: a method of assessing the importance of environmental features.  Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 48: 203–214&lt;/ref&gt;
Such demand tests quantify the strength of motivation animals have for resources whilst avoiding [[anthropomorphism]] and [[anthropocentrism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nc3rs.org.uk/downloaddoc.asp?id=603&amp;page=759&amp;skin=0|title=Sherwin, C.M. Validating refinements to laboratory housing:asking the animals|accessdate=September 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Using consumer demand tests one can empirically determine the strength of motivation animals have for a definite need (e.g. food, water) and also for resources we humans might perceive as a luxury or unnecessary but animals might not (e.g. sand for dustbathing&lt;ref name="Faure and Lagadic, (1994)"&gt;Faure, J.M. and Lagadic, H., (1994). Elasticity of demand for food and sand in laying hens subjected to variable wind speed. Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 42: 49–59&lt;/ref&gt; or additional space for caged mice&lt;ref name="Sherwin and Nicol, (1997)"&gt;Sherwin, C.M. and Nicol, C.J., (1997).  Behavioural demand functions of caged laboratory mice for additional space. Animal Behaviour, 53: 67–74&lt;/ref&gt;). By comparing the strength of motivation for the resource with that for a definite
need, we can measure the importance of a resource as perceived by the animals. Animals will be most highly motivated to interact with resources they absolutely need, highly motivated for resources that they perceive as most improving their welfare, and less motivated for resources they perceive as less important. Furthermore, [[Argument by analogy]] indicates that as with humans, it is more likely that animals will experience [[Affect (psychology)|negative affective states]] (e.g. [[frustration]], [[anxiety]]) if they are not provided with the resources for which they show high motivation.&lt;ref name="Dawkins, (1990)"/&gt;

Various other aspects of the animal's behaviour can be measured to aid understanding of motivation for resources, e.g. latency (delay) to approach the point of access, speed of incurring the cost, time with each resource, or the range of activities with each of the resources. These measures can be recorded either by the experimenter or by motion detecting software. Prior to testing, the animals are usually given the opportunity to explore the apparatus and variants to habituate and reduce the effects of novelty.

==Terminology==
The rate ([[simple linear regression|i.e. regression line]]) at which the animal decreases its acquisition or consumption of a resource as the cost increases is known as the [[Elasticity (economics)|elasticity]] of demand. A steep slope of decreasing access indicates a relatively low motivation for a resource, sometimes called 'high elasticity'; a shallow slope indicates relatively high motivation for a resource, sometimes called 'low elasticity', or 'inelastic demand.'

The 'break point' is the cost at which inelastic demand becomes elastic, i.e. the cost at which constant consumption begins to decrease.

In human [[economics]] and [[consumer theory]], a [[Giffen good]] is a resource which is paradoxically consumed more as the cost rises, violating the [[law of demand]]. In normal situations, as the [[price]] of a resource increases, the [[Consumer theory#Substitution effect|substitution effect]] causes consumers to purchase less of it and more of [[substitute good]]s. In the Giffen good situation, the [[Consumer theory#Income effect|income effect]] dominates, leading people to buy more of the good, even as its price rises.

==Examples==

===Flooring===
Manser et al.&lt;ref name="Manser et al., (1996)"/&gt; showed that laboratory rats were motivated to lift a door weighing 83% of their body weight to allow them to rest on a solid floor rather than on a grid floor, despite their having been kept on grid floors for over 6 months.

===Lighting===
Baldwin showed that when animals were given control of their lighting with the equivalent of an on/off switch, pigs kept lights on for 72% of the time and sheep for 82%. However, when the pigs had to work for the light by keeping their snout within a photo-beam, they only kept the lights on for 0.5% of the time, indicating that light was
a weak [[reinforcement]] for this species.&lt;ref name="Baldwin, (1979)"/&gt;  Savory and Duncan showed that individual hens kept in a background of darkness were prepared to work for 4 hours of light per day.&lt;ref name="Savory and Duncan, (1982)"&gt;Savory, C.J. and Duncan, I.J.H. (1982.) Voluntary regulation of lighting by domestic fowls in skinner boxes. Applied Animal Ethology, 9: 73-81&lt;/ref&gt;

===Burrowing substrate===
Sherwin et al. examined the strength of motivation for burrowing substrate in [[Laboratory mouse|laboratory mice]]. Despite an increasing cost of gaining access, the mice continued to work to visit the burrowing substrate.&lt;ref name="Sherwin et al., (2004)"&gt;Sherwin, C.M., Haug, E., Terkelsen, N. and Vadgama, M., (2004). Studies on the motivation for burrowing by laboratory mice. Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 88: 343-358&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, it was shown that it was the performance of burrowing behaviour that was important to the mice, not simply the functional consequences of the behaviour. King and Welsman showed that when bar pressing gave [[deermice]] access to sand, they increased their rate of bar pressing as the number of presses to access the sand was increased.&lt;ref name="King and Weisman, (1964)"&gt;King, J.A. and Weisman, R.G., (1964) Sand digging contingent upon bar pressing in deermice (Peomyscus). Animal Behaviour, 12: 446-450&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nest box===
Duncan and Kite showed that hens were highly motivated to gain access to a nest box, particularly immediately prior to [[oviposition]]. The hens would push a weighted door, or walk through water or an air blast to reach a nest box. Duncan and Kite suggested the strength of this motivation was equivalent to that of the strength of motivation to feed after 20 hours deprivation.&lt;ref name="Duncan and Kite, (1987)"&gt;Duncan, I.J.H. and Kite, V.G., (1987) Some investigations into motivation in the domestic fowl. Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 18: 387-388&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social contact===
Several studies have examined the motivation of animals for social contact either with their offspring or conspecifics.&lt;ref name="Wilsoncroft, (1969)"&gt;Wilsoncroft, W.E. (1969). Babies by bar-press: maternal behavior in the rat. Behavior Research Methods and Instrumentation, 1: 229-230&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Van hemel, (1973)"&gt;Van Hemel, S.B. (1973). Pup retrieving as a reinforcer in nulliparous mice. Journal of Experimental Analysis of Behaviour, 19: 233-238&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mills and Faure, (1990)"&gt;Mills, A.D. and Faure, J.M., (1990). The treadmill test for the measurement of social motivation in Phasianidae chicks. Medical Science Research 18: 179-180&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="992">The '''consumption-based capital asset pricing model''' (CCAPM) is used in finance and economics as an expansion of the [[capital asset pricing model]] (CAPM). The CCAPM factors in consumption as a means of understanding and calculating an [[expected return]] on investment.

The CCAPM implies that the expected [[risk premium]] on a risky asset, defined as the expected return on a risky asset less the risk free return, is proportional to the covariance of its return and consumption in the period of the return.The consumption beta is included and the expected return is calculated as follows:&lt;ref name="Romer"&gt;Romer, David. Advanced Macroeconomics, ch. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

r= rf + B(rm - rf)

r  = expected return on security or portfolio

rf = risk free rate

B  = consumption beta (of individual company or weighted average of portfolio), and

rm = return from the market

A '''distributed parameter system''' (as opposed to a [[linear lumped parameter|lumped parameter system]]) is a [[system]] whose [[state space (controls)|state space]] is infinite-[[dimension (vector space)|dimensional]]. Such systems are therefore also known as infinite-dimensional systems. Typical examples are systems described by [[partial differential equation]]s or by [[delay differential equation]]s.

== Linear time-invariant distributed parameter systems ==

=== Abstract evolution equations ===

==== Discrete-time ====
With ''U'', ''X'' and ''Y'' [[Hilbert space]]s and ''&lt;math&gt;A\,&lt;/math&gt;''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''L''(''X''), ''&lt;math&gt;B\,&lt;/math&gt;''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''L''(''U'',&amp;nbsp;''X''), ''&lt;math&gt;C\,&lt;/math&gt;''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''L''(''X'',&amp;nbsp;''Y'') and ''&lt;math&gt;D\,&lt;/math&gt;''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''L''(''U'',&amp;nbsp;''Y'') the following equations determine a discrete-time linear time-invariant system:
:&lt;math&gt;x(k+1)=Ax(k)+Bu(k)\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y(k)=Cx(k)+Du(k)\,&lt;/math&gt;
with ''&lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt;'' (the state) a sequence with values in ''X'', ''&lt;math&gt;u\,&lt;/math&gt;'' (the input or control) a sequence with values in ''U'' and ''&lt;math&gt;y\,&lt;/math&gt;'' (the output) a sequence with values in ''Y''.

==== Continuous-time ====
The continuous-time case is similar to the discrete-time case but now one considers differential equations instead of difference equations:
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{x}(t)=Ax(t)+Bu(t)\, &lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;y(t)=Cx(t)+Du(t)\, &lt;/math&gt;.
An added complication now however is that to include interesting physical examples such as partial differential equations and delay differential equations into this abstract framework, one is forced to consider [[unbounded operator]]s. Usually ''A'' is assumed to generate a [[C0 semigroup|strongly continuous semigroup]] on the state space ''X''. Assuming ''B'', ''C'' and ''D'' to be bounded operators then already allows for the inclusion of many interesting physical examples,&lt;ref&gt;Curtain and Zwart&lt;/ref&gt; but the inclusion of many other interesting physical examples forces unboundedness of ''B'' and ''C'' as well.

=== Example: a partial differential equation ===
The partial differential equation with &lt;math&gt;t&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\xi\in[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; given by
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial t}w(t,\xi)=-\frac{\partial}{\partial\xi}w(t,\xi)+u(t),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;w(0,\xi)=w_0(\xi),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;w(t,0)=0,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y(t)=\int_0^1 w(t,\xi)\,d\xi,&lt;/math&gt;
fits into the abstract evolution equation framework described above as follows. The input space ''U'' and the output space ''Y'' are both chosen to be the set of complex numbers. The state space ''X'' is chosen to be  ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(0,&amp;nbsp;1). The operator ''A'' is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;Ax=-x',~~~D(A)=\left\{x\in X: x\text{ absolutely continuous }, x'\in L^2(0,1)\text{ and }x(0)=0\right\}.&lt;/math&gt;
It can be shown&lt;ref&gt;Curtain and Zwart Example 2.2.4&lt;/ref&gt; that ''A'' generates a strongly continuous semigroup on ''X''. The bounded operators ''B'', ''C'' and ''D'' are defined as
:&lt;math&gt;Bu=u,~~~Cx=\int_0^1 x(\xi)\,d\xi,~~~D=0.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Example: a delay differential equation ===
The delay differential equation
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{w}(t)=w(t)+w(t-\tau)+u(t),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y(t)=w(t),&lt;/math&gt;
fits into the abstract evolution equation framework described above as follows. The input space ''U'' and the output space ''Y'' are both chosen to be the set of complex numbers. The state space ''X'' is chosen to be the product of the complex numbers with ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(&amp;minus;''τ'',&amp;nbsp;0). The operator ''A'' is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;A\begin{pmatrix}r\\f\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}r+f(-\tau)\\f'\end{pmatrix},~~~D(A)=\left\{\begin{pmatrix}r\\f\end{pmatrix}\in X: f\text{ absolutely continuous }, f'\in L^2([-\tau,0])\text{ and }r=f(0)\right\}.&lt;/math&gt;
It can be shown&lt;ref&gt;Curtain and Zwart Theorem 2.4.6&lt;/ref&gt; that ''A'' generates a strongly continuous semigroup on X. The bounded operators ''B'', ''C'' and ''D'' are defined as
:&lt;math&gt;Bu=\begin{pmatrix}u\\0\end{pmatrix},~~~C\begin{pmatrix}r\\f\end{pmatrix}=r,~~~D=0.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Transfer functions ===
As in the finite-dimensional case the [[State space (controls)#Transfer function|transfer function]] is defined through the [[Laplace transform]] (continuous-time) or [[Z-transform]] (discrete-time). Whereas in the finite-dimensional case the transfer function is a proper rational function, the infinite-dimensionality of the state space leads to irrational functions (which are however still [[Holomorphic function|holomorphic]]).

==== Discrete-time ====
In discrete-time the transfer function is given in terms of the state space parameters by &lt;math&gt;D+\sum_{k=0}^\infty CA^kBz^k&lt;/math&gt; and it is holomorphic in a disc centered at the origin.&lt;ref&gt;This is the mathematical convention, engineers seem to prefer transfer functions to be holomorphic at infinity; this is achieved by replacing ''z'' by 1/''z''&lt;/ref&gt; In case 1/''z'' belongs to the resolvent set of ''A'' (which is the case on a possibly smaller disc centered at the origin) the transfer function equals &lt;math&gt;D+Cz(I-zA)^{-1}B&lt;/math&gt;. An interesting fact is that any function that is holomorphic in zero is the transfer function of some discrete-time system.

==== Continuous-time ====
If ''A'' generates a strongly continuous semigroup and ''B'', ''C'' and ''D'' are bounded operators, then&lt;ref&gt;Curtain and Zwart Lemma 4.3.6&lt;/ref&gt; the transfer function is given in terms of the state space parameters by &lt;math&gt;D+C(sI-A)^{-1}B&lt;/math&gt; for ''s'' with real part larger than the exponential growth bound of the semigroup generated by ''A''. In more general situations this formula as it stands may not even make sense, but an appropriate generalization of this formula still holds.&lt;ref&gt;Staffans Theorem 4.6.7&lt;/ref&gt;
To obtain an easy expression for the transfer function it is often better to take the Laplace transform in the given differential equation than to use the state space formulas as illustrated below on the examples given above.

==== Transfer function for the partial differential equation example ====
Setting the initial condition &lt;math&gt;w_0&lt;/math&gt; equal to zero and denoting Laplace transforms with respect to ''t'' by capital letters we obtain from the partial differential equation given above
:&lt;math&gt;sW(s,\xi)=-\frac{d}{d\xi}W(s,\xi)+U(s),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;W(s,0)=0,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Y(s)=\int_0^1 W(s,\xi)\,d\xi.&lt;/math&gt;
This is an inhomogeneous linear differential equation with &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; as the variable, ''s'' as a parameter and initial condition zero. The solution is &lt;math&gt;W(s,\xi)=U(s)(1-e^{-s\xi})/s&lt;/math&gt;. Substituting this in the equation for ''Y'' and integrating gives &lt;math&gt;Y(s)=U(s)(e^{-s}+s-1)/s^2&lt;/math&gt; so that the transfer function is &lt;math&gt;(e^{-s}+s-1)/s^2&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Transfer function for the delay differential equation example ====
Proceeding similarly as for the partial differential equation example, the transfer function for the delay equation example is&lt;ref&gt;Curtain and Zwart Example 4.3.13&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;math&gt;1/(s-1-e^{-s})&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Controllability ===
In the infinite-dimensional case there are several non-equivalent definitions of [[controllability]] which for the finite-dimensional case collapse to the one usual notion of controllability. The three most important controllability concepts are:
*Exact controllability,
*Approximate controllability,
*Null controllability.

==== Controllability in discrete-time ====
An important role is played by the maps &lt;math&gt;\Phi_n&lt;/math&gt; which map the set of all ''U'' valued sequences into X and are given by &lt;math&gt;\Phi_n u=\sum_{k=0}^n A^kBu_k&lt;/math&gt;. The interpretation is that &lt;math&gt;\Phi_nu&lt;/math&gt; is the state that is reached by applying the input sequence ''u'' when the initial condition is zero. The system is called 
*exactly controllable in time ''n'' if the range of &lt;math&gt;\Phi_n&lt;/math&gt; equals ''X'',
*approximately controllable in time ''n'' if the range of &lt;math&gt;\Phi_n&lt;/math&gt; is dense in ''X'',
*null controllable in time ''n'' if the range of &lt;math&gt;\Phi_n&lt;/math&gt; includes the range of ''A&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''.

==== Controllability in continuous-time ====
In controllability of continuous-time systems the map &lt;math&gt;\Phi_t&lt;/math&gt; given by &lt;math&gt;\int_0^t {\rm e}^{As}Bu(s)\,ds&lt;/math&gt; plays the role that &lt;math&gt;\Phi_n&lt;/math&gt; plays in discrete-time. However, the space of control functions on which this operator acts now influences the definition. The usual choice is ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(0,&amp;nbsp;∞;''U''), the space of (equivalence classes of) ''U''-valued square integrable functions on the interval (0,&amp;nbsp;∞), but other choices such as ''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(0,&amp;nbsp;∞;''U'') are possible. The different controllability notions can be defined once the domain of &lt;math&gt;\Phi_t&lt;/math&gt; is chosen. The system is called&lt;ref&gt;Tucsnak Definition 11.1.1&lt;/ref&gt;
*exactly controllable in time ''t'' if the range of &lt;math&gt;\Phi_t&lt;/math&gt; equals ''X'',
*approximately controllable in time ''t'' if the range of &lt;math&gt;\Phi_t&lt;/math&gt; is dense in ''X'',
*null controllable in time ''t'' if the range of &lt;math&gt;\Phi_t&lt;/math&gt; includes the range of &lt;math&gt;{\rm e}^{At}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Observability ===
As in the finite-dimensional case, [[observability]] is the dual notion of controllability. In the infinite-dimensional case there are several different notions of observability which in the finite-dimensional case coincide. The three most important ones are:
*Exact observability (also known as continuous observability),
*Approximate observability,
*Final state observability.

==== Observability in discrete-time ====
An important role is played by the maps &lt;math&gt;\Psi_n&lt;/math&gt; which map ''X'' into the space of all ''Y'' valued sequences and are given by &lt;math&gt;(\Psi_nx)_k=CA^kx&lt;/math&gt; if ''k''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''n'' and zero if ''k''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''n''. The interpretation is that &lt;math&gt;\Psi_nx&lt;/math&gt; is the truncated output with initial condition ''x'' and control zero. The system is called
*exactly observable in time ''n'' if there exists a ''k''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 such that &lt;math&gt;\|\Psi_nx\|\geq k_n\|x\|&lt;/math&gt; for all ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''X'',
*approximately observable in time ''n'' if &lt;math&gt;\Psi_n&lt;/math&gt; is [[injective]],
*final state observable in time ''n'' if there exists a ''k''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 such that &lt;math&gt;\|\Psi_nx\|\geq k_n\|A^nx\|&lt;/math&gt; for all ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''X''.

==== Observability in continuous-time ====
In observability of continuous-time systems the map &lt;math&gt;\Psi_t&lt;/math&gt; given by &lt;math&gt;(\Psi_t)(s)=C{\rm e}^{As}x&lt;/math&gt; for ''s&amp;isin;[0,t]'' and zero for ''s&gt;t'' plays the role that &lt;math&gt;\Psi_n&lt;/math&gt; plays in discrete-time. However, the space of functions to which this operator maps now influences the definition. The usual choice is ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(0,&amp;nbsp;∞,&amp;nbsp;''Y''), the space of (equivalence classes of) ''Y''-valued square integrable functions on the interval ''(0,∞)'', but other choices such as ''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(0,&amp;nbsp;∞,&amp;nbsp;''Y'') are possible. The different observability notions can be defined once the co-domain of &lt;math&gt;\Psi_t&lt;/math&gt; is chosen. The system is called&lt;ref&gt;Tucsnak Definition 6.1.1&lt;/ref&gt;
*exactly observable in time ''t'' if there exists a ''k''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 such that &lt;math&gt;\|\Psi_tx\|\geq k_t\|x\|&lt;/math&gt; for all ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''X'',
*approximately observable in time ''t'' if &lt;math&gt;\Psi_t&lt;/math&gt; is [[injective]],
*final state observable in time ''t'' if there exists a ''k''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 such that &lt;math&gt;\|\Psi_tx\|\geq k_t\|{\rm e}^{At}x\|&lt;/math&gt; for all ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''X''.

=== Duality between controllability and observability ===
As in the finite-dimensional case, controllability and observability are dual concepts (at least when for the domain of &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; and the co-domain of &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt; the usual ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; choice is made). The correspondence under duality of the different concepts is:&lt;ref&gt;Tucsnak Theorem 11.2.1&lt;/ref&gt;
*Exact controllability ↔ Exact observability,
*Approximate controllability ↔ Approximate observability,
*Null controllability ↔ Final state observability.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7728">In [[physics]], '''dynamic speckle''' is a result of the temporal evolution of a [[speckle pattern]] where variations in the [[scattering]] elements responsible for the formation of the [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] pattern in the static situation produce the changes that are seen in the [[speckle pattern]], where its grains change their intensity (grey level) as well as their shape along time. One easy to observe example is milk: place some milk in a teaspoon and observe the surface in direct sunlight. You will see a "dancing" pattern of coloured points. Where the milk dries on the spoon at the edge, the speckle is seen to be static. This is direct evidence of the thermal motion of atoms, which cause the Brownian motion of the colloidal particles in the milk, which in turn results in the dynamic speckle visible to the naked eye.

[[File:MaizeSeed.gif|thumb|Biospeckle laser image sequence of a maize seed.]]

== Information present in the dynamic speckle pattern ==

{{double image|left|THSP HIGH.jpg|200|THSP LOW.jpg|200|Temporal history of speckle patterns of biscuits with high (left) and low (right) molecular activity.||History of speckle pattern of a biscuit with high molecular activity|History of speckle pattern of a biscuit with low molecular activity}}

The dynamic pattern shows then the changes that, if they are analyzed along time, represent the activity of the illuminated material. The visual effect is that of a boiling liquid or the image in a TV set far from tuning.

It can be analyzed by means of several mathematical and statistical tools and provide numeric or visual information on its magnitude, the not well defined idea of activity. Because the number of [[scattering]] centers is very high the collective phenomenon is hard to interpret and their individual contributions to the final result can not be inferred. The measurements that are obtained by means of the analysis tools present the activity level as a sum of the contributions of phenomena due to [[Doppler effect]] of the scattered light as well as other phenomena eventually present (time variations of the refractive index of the sample, etc.) Light scattered with small [[Doppler effect|Doppler]] shifts in its frequency beats on the detector (eventually the eye) giving rise to the slow intensity variations that constitute the dynamic of the speckle pattern.

A biological sample, for example, that is a material that contains a huge number of mobile scattering centers, presents refractive index variations in the materials that compose it with power changes as well as many other effects increasing the complexity in the identification and isolation of these phenomena. Then, the complete interpretation of the activity of a sample, by means of dynamic speckle, presents itself big challenges.&lt;ref&gt;

Figure 1 shows a sequence of [[Speckle pattern|speckle]] patterns in a corn seed in the start of its germination process where the dynamic effect is higher in the areas where the [[scattering]] centers are  expected to be more active as is the case of the embryo and in a break in the endosperm region of the seed. The embryo is in the lower left side and the break is a river-like region in the center. In the crack, the activity is due to intensive inner water evaporation while in the embryo activity is higher due to metabolism of the alive tissue together with the activity caused by water evaporation. In the endosperm, the high right region of the image represents that the relatively low activity is due only to water evaporation.

== Applications ==

Biological tissue is one of the most complex that can be found in nature. Besides it is worsened by the intrinsic variability present between one sample and another. These facts make even more difficult the comparison of results between different samples even in presence of the same stimulus.

Several mathematical and statistical tools have been proposed for the characterization of the activity of a dynamic speckle pattern.
Some of them are:

{{Italic title}}
'''''Entropy: A New World View''''' is a non-fiction book by [[Jeremy Rifkin]] and [[Ted Howard (author)|Ted Howard]], with an Afterword by [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]]. It was first published by Viking Press, New York in 1980 ({{ISBN|0-670-29717-8}}).

A paperback edition was published by Bantam in 1981, in a paperback revised edition, by Bantam Books, in 1989 ({{ISBN|0-553-34717-9}}). The 1989 revised edition was titled: ''Entropy: Into the Greenhouse World'' ({{ISBN|978-0-553-34717-3}}).

In the book the authors analyze the world's economic and social structures by using the [[second law of thermodynamics]], also known as the law of [[entropy]]. The authors argue that humanity is wasting resources at an increasing rate, which if unchecked will lead to the destruction of civilization, which has happened before on a smaller scale to past societies. The book promotes the use of sustainable energy sources and slow [[resource consumption]] as the solution to delay or forestall death by entropy.
Critics: Rifkin's 1980 views assume that entropy is disorder. However, a more modern based on information theory treats entropy as uncertainty. The later approach explains how in some cases entropy increases order. In fact, order spontaneously increases in the world all the time in evolution and also in an economy that is constantly improved. Therefore, Rifkin's book is controversial. See "Entropy God's Dice Game" by Kafri and Kafri.

Such critiques are addressed by properly defining the system under consideration. While biological systems may give the appearance of self-assembling contrary to the Second Law, this illusion disappears when one considers the environment-organism system.  While the constituent atoms and molecules comprising the organism, as a collection, decrease in entropy, the surroundings experience a compensating increase in entropy, consistent with the Second Law.

[[Image:FIM-platinum.jpg|thumb|Field ion microscope image of the end of a sharp [[platinum]] needle.  Each bright spot is a platinum atom.]]

The '''Field ion microscope''' (FIM) was invented by [[Erwin Wilhelm Müller|Müller]] in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Müller |first=Erwin W.|year=1951 |title= Das Feldionenmikroskop |journal= Zeitschrift für Physik |volume=131 |issue=8 |pages=136–142 |bibcode=1951ZPhy..131..136M |doi=10.1007/BF01329651 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a type of [[microscope]] that can be used to image the arrangement of [[atom]]s at the surface of a sharp metal tip.

On October 11, 1955, Erwin Müller and his Ph.D. student, Kanwar Bahadur (Pennsylvania State University) observed individual tungsten atoms on the surface of a sharply pointed tungsten tip by cooling it to 21 K and employing helium as the imaging gas. Müller &amp; Bahadur were the first persons to observe individual atoms directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Müller |first1=Erwin W. |last2=Bahadur |first2= Kanwar |year=1956 |title= Field Ionization of gases at a metal surface and the resolution of the field ion microscope |journal= Phys. Rev. |volume=102 |pages= 624–631|doi=10.1103/physrev.102.624 |bibcode=1956PhRv..102..624M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==

In FIM, a sharp (&lt;50&amp;nbsp;nm tip radius) metal tip is produced and placed in an [[ultra high vacuum]] chamber, which is backfilled with an imaging gas such as [[helium]] or [[neon]].  The tip is cooled to cryogenic temperatures (20–100 K). A positive [[voltage]] of 5 to 10 kilo[[volt]]s is applied to the tip.  Gas atoms [[adsorption|adsorbed]] on the tip are ionized by the strong [[electric field]] in the vicinity of the tip (thus, "field ionization"), becoming positively charged and being repelled from the tip.  The curvature of the surface near the tip causes a natural magnification — [[ion]]s are repelled in a direction roughly perpendicular to the surface (a "point projection" effect).  A detector is placed so as to collect these repelled ions; the image formed from all the collected ions can be of sufficient resolution to image individual atoms on the tip surface.

Unlike conventional microscopes, where the spatial resolution is limited by the wavelength of the particles which are used for imaging, the FIM is a projection type microscope with atomic resolution and an approximate magnification of a few million times.

==Design, limitations and applications==

FIM like [[Field emission microscopy|Field Emission Microscopy]] (FEM) consists of a sharp sample tip and a fluorescent screen (now replaced by a [[Microchannel plate detector|multichannel plate]]) as the key elements. However, there are some essential differences as follows:
#The tip potential is positive.
#The chamber is filled with an imaging gas (typically, He or Ne at 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; Torr).
#The tip is cooled to low temperatures (~20-80K).
Like FEM, the field strength at the tip apex is typically a few V/[[Angstrom|Å]]. The experimental set-up and image formation in FIM is illustrated in the accompanying figures.

[[Image:FIM experimental set up.jpg|thumb|right|FIM experimental set-up.]]

[[Image:FIMtip.JPG|thumb|right|FIM image formation process.]]

In FIM the presence of a strong field is critical. The imaging gas atoms (He, Ne) near the tip are polarized by the field and since the field is non-uniform the polarized atoms are attracted towards the tip surface. The imaging atoms then lose their [[kinetic energy]] performing a series of hops and accommodate to the tip temperature. Eventually, the imaging atoms are ionized by tunneling electrons into the surface and the resulting positive ions are accelerated along the [[field line]]s to the screen to form a highly magnified image of the sample tip.

In FIM, the [[ionization]] takes place close to the tip, where the field is strongest. The electron that tunnels from the atom is picked up by the tip. There is a critical distance, xc, at which the tunneling probability is a maximum. This distance is typically about 0.4&amp;nbsp;nm. The very high spatial resolution and high contrast for features on the atomic scale arises from the fact that the electric field is enhanced in the vicinity of the surface atoms because of the higher local curvature. The resolution of FIM is limited by the thermal velocity of the imaging ion. Resolution of the order of 1Å (atomic resolution) can be achieved by effective cooling of the tip.

Application of FIM, like FEM, is limited by the materials which can be fabricated in the shape of a sharp tip, can be used in an ultra high vacuum (UHV) environment, and can tolerate the high [[electrostatic fields]]. For these reasons, [[refractory metals]] with high melting temperature (e.g. W, Mo, Pt, Ir) are conventional objects for FIM experiments. Metal tips for FEM and FIM are prepared by [[electropolishing]] (electrochemical polishing) of thin wires. However, these tips usually contain many [[Asperity (materials science)|asperities]].  The final preparation procedure involves the in situ removal of these asperities by field evaporation just by raising the tip voltage. Field evaporation is a field induced process which involves the removal of atoms from the surface itself at very high field strengths and typically occurs in the range 2-5 V/Å. The effect of the field in this case is to reduce the effective binding energy of the atom to the surface and to give, in effect, a greatly increased evaporation rate relative to that expected at that temperature at zero fields. This process is self-regulating since the atoms that are at positions of high local curvature, such as adatoms or ledge atoms, are removed preferentially. The tips used in FIM is sharper (tip radius is 100~300 Å) compared to those used in FEM experiments (tip radius ~1000 Å).

FIM has been used to study dynamical behavior of surfaces and the behavior of [[adatoms]] on surfaces. The problems studied include [[adsorption]]-[[desorption]] phenomena, [[surface diffusion]] of adatoms and clusters, adatom-adatom interactions, step motion, equilibrium crystal shape, etc. However, there is the possibility of the results being affected by the limited surface area (i.e. edge effects) and by the presence of large electric field.

'''''Fizz''''' is a novel by [[Zvi Schreiber]] centered on the history of [[physics]]. It tells the story of a young woman from the future named Fizz, who time travels to meet physicists such as [[Aristotle]], [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]], and discuss their work.
Fizz brands itself as an "edu-novel" with similarity to the genre of ''[[Sophie's World]]''. The book claims to target both young adults and adults, with an amateur interest in physics, as well as teachers and students of physics.

== Plot summary ==

Fizz is a young woman from the "Eco-community" - a future sect which abandons science and technology. Her father has left this community and invented a time machine. Driven by curiosity about the physical world, Fizz borrows her father's time machine and visits many past physicists from Aristotle to [[Stephen Hawking]].

Each chapter combines some discussion of physics with some fictional plot and personal development of Fizz. Eventually Fizz returns to the future to choose between life inside or outside the eco-community.

== Reception ==
Only a small number of reviews have been published since publication in July 2011. Fizz won a five star rating from [[ForeWord (magazine)|ForeWord magazine]]'s Clarion review.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.forewordreviews.com/reviews/fizz/&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Association of Physics Teachers]] invited members to consider trying Fizz in classroom pilots in the July 2011 newsletter.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aapt.org/aboutaapt/ennouncer/jul2011.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Flying Saucers from Outer Space''''' (Holt, 1953) is a non-fiction book by [[Donald Keyhoe]] about [[unidentified flying objects]], aka UFOs.

==Adaptation==
In 1956 a science-fiction film credited as "suggested by" the book was made under the title ''[[Earth vs. the Flying Saucers]]'', also known as ''Invasion of the Flying Saucers''.&lt;ref&gt;Screen credits for [[Earth vs. the Flying Saucers]] are:  screen play by [[George Worthing Yates]] and Raymond T. Marcus, screen story by [[Curt Siodmak]], suggested by "Flying Saucers From Outer Space" by Major [[Donald E. Keyhoe]]. Keyhoe's descriptions of UFO reports and Air Force investigations were used to give a realistic background to a fictional story. Keyhoe's recounts of descriptions of UFOs with a stationary central cabin and rotating slotted outer disk inspired the design of the saucers in the movie.&lt;/ref&gt;
The working titles of this film were Attack of the Flying Saucers, Invasion of the Flying Saucers and Flying Saucers from Outer Space. In a letter contained in the film's production file at the AMPAS Library, blacklisted screenwriter Bernard Gordon stated that he wrote the screenplay for this picture using the pseudonym Raymond T. Marcus.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1420">The '''Foundational Model of Anatomy Ontology''' ('''FMA''') is a reference [[Ontology (computer science)|ontology]] for the domain of [[anatomy]]. It is a symbolic representation of the canonical, phenotypic structure of an [[organism]]; a spatial-structural ontology of anatomical entities and relations which form the physical organization of an organism at all salient levels of [[granularity]].

FMA is developed and maintained by the Structural Informatics Group at the [[University of Washington]].

==Description==
FMA ontology contains approximately 75,000 classes and over 120,000 terms, over 2.1 million relationship instances from over 168 relationship types.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sig.biostr.washington.edu/projects/fm/AboutFM.html#contents About FMA – Contents] – The Foundational Model of Anatomy (retrieved 2012-11-06).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Grand Rapids Amateur Astronomical Association''' (or "GRAAA") is an astronomy group located in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]], [[Michigan]]. It was formed in 1955 by an enthusiastic group of individuals led by businessman James C. Veen, with a love of astronomy and science. Veen initially provided a meeting place in his office, but died in an automobile accident in 1958.

The Association participates in public education activities at various metropolitan venues, comet watches, meteor observing, as well as opening their Observatory to the public two nights per month, excluding winter. Besides the public education programs, members involve themselves in many other pursuits from observing programs to astrophotography and CCD imaging.

The Association owns/ operates the [[Veen Observatory]], located S.W. of [[Lowell, Michigan]], situated on private land per a ninety-nine year lease granted by James M. and H. Evelyn Marron. Construction was started in 1965 and the Observatory was dedicated in 1970, originally with a 12-inch Newtonian reflector constructed by the members. The Chaffee Planetarium made considerable contribution to the building, as well as Kent County businesses and a foundation. It is the largest amateur facility in the state of Michigan, with a 16-inch (Borr), 14-inch (Marron), and 17-inch (Hawkins) telescopes, as well as smaller portable instruments including a hydrogen-alpha solar telescope.

The GRAAA is a [[501(c)(3)]] non-profit educational and scientific organization dedicated to advancing the study of astronomy and promoting astronomy and science education. Meetings are held monthly, in the warmer months at the Veen Observatory, and currently (2013) at Schuler Books and Music in the city during the rest of the season.

{{Writing systems sidebar}}

An '''ideogram''' or '''ideograph''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἰδέα}} ''idéa'' "idea" and {{lang|grc|γράφω}} ''gráphō'' "to write") is a [[graphic]] [[symbol]] that represents an [[idea]] or concept, independent of any particular language, and specific words or phrases.  Some ideograms are comprehensible only by familiarity with prior convention; others convey their meaning through pictorial resemblance to a physical object, and thus may also be referred to as [[pictogram]]s.

==Terminology==
{{further|Character (symbol)|Logogram}}
[[Image:Perros No.svg|thumb|"No dogs allowed" sign in Spain. The dog illustration is a [[pictogram]]. The red circle and bar is an ideogram representing the idea of "no" or "not allowed".]]
[[Image:EinKaremVisitationIdeogram.jpg|thumb|Ideograms in the [[Church of the Visitation]], Jerusalem]]
In [[proto-writing]], used for inventories and the like, physical objects are represented by stylized or conventionalized pictures, or [[pictogram]]s. For example, the pictorial [[Dongba symbols]] without [[Geba syllabary|Geba]] annotation cannot represent the [[Naxi language]], but are used as a mnemonic for reciting oral literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Ramsey | first = S. Robert | title = The Languages of China
|publisher = Princeton University Press | year = 1987 | isbn = 978-0-691-01468-5| page = 266}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some systems also use ideograms, symbols denoting abstract concepts.

The term "ideogram" is often used to describe symbols of [[writing system]]s such as [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], [[Sumerian cuneiform]] and [[Chinese character]]s.  However, these symbols are [[logogram]]s, representing words or morphemes of a particular language rather than objects or concepts. In these writing systems, a variety of strategies were employed in the design of logographic symbols.
Pictographic symbols depict the object referred to by the word, such as an icon of a bull denoting the Semitic word ''ʾālep'' "ox".
Some words denoting abstract concepts may be represented iconically, but most other words are represented using the [[rebus]] principle, borrowing a symbol for a similarly-sounding word. Later systems used selected symbols to represent the sounds of the language, for example the adaptation of the logogram for ''ʾālep'' "ox" as the [[letter (alphabet)|letter]] [[aleph]] representing the initial sound of the word, a [[glottal stop]].

Many signs in [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphic]] as well as in [[cuneiform writing]] could be used either logographically or phonetically. For example, the Akkadian sign [[dingir|AN]] ({{script|Xsux|[[Dingir|&amp;#x1202D;]]}}) could be an ideograph for "[[deity]]", an ideogram for the god [[An (mythology)|Anum]] in particular, a logograph for the  Akkadian stem ''[[ilah|il-]]'' "deity", a logograph for the Akkadian word  ''šamu'' "sky", or a [[syllabogram]] for either the syllable ''an'' or ''il''.

Although Chinese characters are logograms, two of the smaller classes in the [[Chinese character classification|traditional classification]] are ideographic in origin:
* Simple ideographs (指事字 ''zhǐshìzì'') are abstract symbols such as 上 ''shàng'' "up" and 下 ''xià'' "down" or numerals such as 三 ''sān'' "three".
* Semantic compounds (会意字 ''huìyìzì'') are semantic combinations of characters, such as 明 ''míng'' "bright", composed of 日 ''rì'' "sun" and 月 ''yuè'' "moon", or 休 ''xiū'' "rest", composed of 人 ''rén'' "person" and 木 ''mù'' "tree".  In the light of the modern understanding of [[Old Chinese phonology]], researchers now believe that most of the characters originally classified as semantic compounds have an at least partially phonetic nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = William | last = Boltz | title = The origin and early development of the Chinese writing system | publisher = American Oriental Society | year = 1994 | isbn = 978-0-940490-78-9 | pp = 67–72, 149 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of ideograms is the [[DOT pictograms|collection of 50 signs]] developed in the 1970s by the  [[American Institute of Graphic Arts]] at the request of the [[US Department of Transportation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aiga.org/symbol-signs Symbols and signs], AIGA.&lt;/ref&gt; The system was initially used to mark airports and gradually became more widespread.

==Mathematics==

Mathematical symbols are a type of ideogram.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mathematics as Sign: Writing, Imagining, Counting |first=Brian |last=Rotman |year=2000 |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=978-0-8047-3684-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed universal languages==
{{See also|Pasigraphy}}

Inspired by inaccurate early descriptions of Chinese and Japanese characters as ideograms, many Western thinkers have sought to design universal written languages, in which symbols denote concepts rather than words. An early proposal was ''[[An Essay towards a Real Character, and a Philosophical Language]]'' (1668) by [[John Wilkins]]. A recent example is the system of [[Blissymbols]], which was proposed by [[Charles K. Bliss]] in 1949 and currently includes over 2,000 symbols.&lt;ref&gt;Unger (2003), pp. 13–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''ignition tube''' is a piece of [[laboratory]] equipment.  It is a [[laboratory tube]] used much in the same way as a [[boiling tube]] except not being as large and thick-walled.  It is primarily used to hold small quantities of substances which are undergoing direct heating by a [[Bunsen burner]] or other heat source. 

Ignition tubes are used in the [[sodium fusion test]].

Ignition tubes are often difficult to clean due to the small bore. When used to heat substances strongly, some char may stick to the walls as well. They are usually disposable.

'''InVesalius''' is a free medical [[software]] used to generate virtual reconstructions of structures in the human body. Based on two-dimensional images, acquired using [[computed tomography]] or [[magnetic resonance imaging]] equipment, the software generates virtual three-dimensional models correspondent to anatomical parts of the human body. After constructing three-dimensional [[DICOM]] images, the software allows the generation of [[STL (file format)|STL]] (stereolithography) files. These files can be used for [[rapid prototyping]].

InVesalius was developed at '''CTI''' (Renato Archer Information Technology Center), a research institute of the Brazilian Science and Technology Center and is available at no cost at the homepage of [https://softwarepublico.gov.br/social/invesalius Public Software Portal homepage]. The software license is CC-GPL 2. It is available in [[English language|English]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese (Brazil)]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[German language|German]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Turkish language|Turkish (Turkey)]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[French language|French]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Chinese language|Chinese (Taiwan)]] and [[Greek language|Greek]].

InVesalius was developed using [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and works under [[Linux]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[OS X|Mac OS X]]. It also uses graphic libraries [[VTK]], [[wxPython]], [[Numpy]], [[Scipy]] and [[GDCM]].

The software’s name is a tribute to Belgian physician [[Andreas Vesalius]] (1514–1564), considered the "father of modern anatomy".
Developed since 2001 for attending Brazilian Public Hospitals demands, InVesalius development was directed for promoting social inclusion of individuals with severe facial deformities. Since then, however, it has been employed in various research areas of [[dentistry]], [[medicine]], [[veterinary medicine]], [[paleontology]] and [[anthropology]]. It has been used not only in public hospitals, but also in private clinics and hospitals.

Until 2017, the software had already been used for generating more than 5000 rapid prototyping models of anatomical structures at [http://www.cti.gov.br/index.php/dt3d-programas/promed.html Promed project].

This '''list of dog diseases''' is a selection of diseases and other conditions found in the [[dog]]. Some of these diseases are unique to dogs or closely related species, while others are found in other animals, including humans. Not all of the articles listed here contain information specific to dogs. Articles with non-dog information are marked with an asterisk (*).

==Infectious diseases==
===Viral infections===
*[[Rabies]] (hydrophobia) is a fatal [[Virus|viral]] disease that can affect any mammal, although the close relationship of dogs with humans makes canine rabies a [[zoonosis|zoonotic]] concern.

*[[Ringworm]] is a fungal skin disease that in dogs is caused by ''[[Microsporum canis]]'' (70%), ''[[Microsporum gypseum]]'' (20%), and ''[[Trichophyton mentagrophytes]]'' (10%). Typical signs in dogs include hair loss and scaly skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Dermatophytosis: Cats and Dogs | work = The Merck Veterinary Manual | year = 2006 | url = http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/71303.htm | accessdate = 2006-11-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Sporotrichosis]] is a fungal disease caused by ''[[Sporothrix schenckii]]'' that affects both dogs and humans. It is a rare disease in dogs, with cat and horse infections predominating in veterinary medicine. The disease in dogs is usually nodular skin lesions of the head and trunk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Sporotrichosis | work = The Center for Food Security &amp; Public Health | publisher = Iowa State University | year = 2006 | url = http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/sporotrichosis.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2006-11-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Aspergillosis]]* is a fungal disease that in dogs is caused primarily by ''[[Aspergillus fumigatus]]''. Infection is usually in the nasal cavity. Typical signs in dogs include sneezing, nasal discharge, bleeding from the nose, and ulcerations of the nose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Aspergillosis | work = The Merck Veterinary Manual | year = 2006 | url = http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/51102.htm | accessdate = 2006-11-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Pythiosis]] is a disease cause by a [[water mould]] of the genus ''[[Pythium]]'', ''[[Pythium insidiosum|P. insidiosum]]''. It occurs primarily in dogs and horses, but can also affect humans. In dogs it affects the gastrointestinal system and lymph nodes, and rarely the skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Grooters, Amy M.|title=Pythiosis, lagenidiosis, and zygomycosis in small animals|journal=The Veterinary Clinics of North America|year=2003|volume=33|pages=695–720|doi=10.1016/S0195-5616(03)00034-2|pmid=12910739|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Mucormycosis]] is a collection of fungal and mold diseases in dogs including pythiosis, zygomycosis, and lagenidiosis that affect the gastrointestinal tract and skin.&lt;ref name=Ettinger_1995/&gt;

===Protozoal diseases===

*[[Giardiasis]]* is an intestinal infection in dogs caused by the [[protozoa]] ''[[Giardia lamblia]]''. The most common symptom is diarrhea. The [[zoonosis|zoonotic]] potential of giardiasis is controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Giardiasis: Introduction | work = The Merck Veterinary Manual | year = 2006 | url = http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/21300.htm | accessdate = 2006-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Coccidiosis]] can be caused by a variety of coccidian organisms in dogs, most commonly ''[[Isospora]]''. There are usually no symptoms, but diarrhea and weight loss may occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Coccidiosis of Cats and Dogs | work = The Merck Veterinary Manual | year = 2006 | url = http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/21206.htm | accessdate = 2006-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Babesiosis]]* is spread by members of the family [[Ixodidae]], or hard ticks. The two species of the genus ''[[Babesia]]'' that affect dogs are ''[[Babesia canis|B. canis]]'' and ''[[Babesia gibsoni|B. gibsoni]]''. Babesiosis can cause [[hemolytic anemia]] in dogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Cleveland | first = C. Wyatt |author2=Latimer, Kenneth S. |author3=Peterson, David S. | title = An Overview of Canine Babesiosis | publisher = College of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Georgia | url = http://www.vet.uga.edu/vpp/clerk/cleveland/index.php | accessdate = 2006-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Back pain]]* in dogs, particularly in long-backed breeds, such as [[Basset Hound]]s and [[Dachshund]]s, is usually caused by intervertebral disk disease. It is caused by degeneration and protrusion of the disk and compression of the spinal cord. It occurs most commonly in the cervical and thoracolumbar regions. Signs include back pain, hind limb weakness, and paralysis.&lt;ref name=Merckdeg&gt;{{cite web | title = Degenerative Diseases | work = The Merck Veterinary Manual | year = 2006 | url = http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/100702.htm | accessdate = 2006-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Congenital vertebral anomaly|Congenital vertebral anomalies]], including butterfly, block, and transitional vertebrae, and hemivertebrae, are a collection of malformations of the spine in animals. Most are not clinically significant, but they can cause compression of the spinal cord by deforming the vertebral canal or causing instability.&lt;ref name=Ettinger_1995/&gt;
*[[Craniomandibular osteopathy]] is a hereditary disease in [[West Highland White Terrier]]s and also occurs in other terrier breeds. It is a developmental disease in puppies causing extensive bony changes in the mandible and skull.

*[[Platelet]] disorders
**[[von Willebrand disease]]* is a common inherited disease in dogs caused by a deficiency of a protein called [[von Willebrand factor]], which is involved in blood clotting. The disease varies from mild to severe, depending on the amount of von Willebrand factor present in the dog. Signs include spontaneous bleeding and excessive bleeding following surgery, injury, or during an [[estrous cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = What is von Willebrand's disease? | work = Canine Inherited Disorders Database | publisher = University of Prince Edward Island | year = 1998 | url = http://ic.upei.ca/cidd/disorder/von-willebrands-disease| accessdate = 2014-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
**[[Thrombocytopenia]]* is a common condition in dogs characterized by low [[platelet]] counts. Platelets are used in clotting the blood, so dogs with this condition may have spontaneous bleeding or prolonged bleeding following surgery, injury, or during an [[estrous cycle]]. Causes include some [[rickettsia]]l infections such as [[ehrlichiosis]], cancers such as [[hemangiosarcoma]], or immune-mediated disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Acquired Thrombocytopenia | work = The Merck Veterinary Manual | year = 2006 | url = http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/10607.htm | accessdate = 2006-12-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
**[[Thrombocytosis]]* is a condition characterized by an excess of platelets. Most cases are physiologic (caused by exercise) or reactive (secondary to some cancers, blood loss, or certain drugs). Rarely the condition is caused by a primary bone marrow disorder. In this last case, the platelets may not function normally, causing the blood to not clot properly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Rebar | first = A. H. |author2=MacWilliams, P.

*[[Hemolytic anemia]]* is a type of regenerative [[anemia]] found in dogs characterized by destruction of the red blood cell. The most important type is [[Warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia|immune-mediated hemolytic anemia]], which can be a primary disease or secondary to cancer, infection, drugs, or vaccinations. [[Antibody|Antibodies]] are present on the cell surface, leading to [[lysis]] and severe anemia. Other causes of hemolytic lesion include [[hypophosphatemia]], exposure to toxins such as [[lead]], infections such as [[ehrlichiosis]] or [[babesiosis]], and rarely, [[neonatal isoerythrolysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Hemolytic anemia | work = The Merck Veterinary Manual | year = 2006 | url = http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/10203.htm | accessdate = 2006-12-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The behavioral condition [[Pica (disorder)|pica]], especially when involving the eating of [[concrete]] dust, tile [[grout]], or [[sand]], may be a sign of hemolytic anemia, indicating the need for a [[complete blood count]] to investigate a possible diagnosis.&lt;ref name="plunkett"/&gt;&lt;ref name="feldman"/&gt;
*[[Heart]] diseases
**Degenerative (myxomatous) [[mitral valve]] disease* is a common cause of congestive heart failure in dogs, especially small, older dogs.&lt;ref&gt;Serfass P, Chetboul V, Sampedrano CC, Nicolle A, Benalloul T, Laforge H, Gau C, Hébert C, Pouchelon JL, Tissier R. Retrospective study of 942 small-sized dogs: Prevalence of left apical systolic heart murmur and left-sided heart failure, critical effects of breed and sex. J Vet Cardiol. 2006 May;8(1):11-8.&lt;/ref&gt; The leaflets of the valve become thickened and nodular, leading to mitral valve regurgitation and volume overload of the left side of the heart. [[Cavalier King Charles Spaniel]]s and [[Dachshund]]s have an inherited form of this disease.&lt;ref name=Abbott_2000&gt;{{cite book|author=Abbott, Jonathan A.|title=Small Animal Cardiology Secrets|edition=1st|publisher=Hanley &amp; Belfus, Inc.|year=2000|isbn=1-56053-352-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**[[Dilated cardiomyopathy]] (DCM) is a disease of heart muscle resulting in decreased myocardial [[contractility]]. The left ventricle compensates for this disease by growing larger (eccentric or volume overload hypertrophy; AKA dilation). The left [[Atrium (anatomy)|atrial]] is also dilated when the disease is severe. It is seen in large/giant dog breeds such as [[Boxer (dog)|Boxer]]s, [[Great Dane]]s, and [[Doberman Pinscher]]s. It is usually [[idiopathic]], but can also be caused by [[taurine]] deficiency in American [[Cocker Spaniel]]s or [[doxorubicin]] use. A mutation in the gene that encodes for pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 is associated with DCM in Doberman Pinschers in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;Meurs KM1, Lahmers S, Keene BW, White SN, Oyama MA, Mauceli E, Lindblad-Toh K. A splice site mutation in a gene encoding for PDK4, a mitochondrial protein, is associated with the development of dilated cardiomyopathy in the Doberman pinscher. Hum Genet. 2012 Aug;131(8):1319-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Dilated cardiomyopathy usually ultimately results in congestive heart failure. [[Atrial fibrillation]] is common in giant breed dogs with DCM. Doberman Pinschers more commonly have ventricular arrhythmias (e.g., premature ventricular complexes; ventricular tachycardia) that predispose them to sudden death (i.e., ventricular fibrillation).&lt;ref name=Abbott_2000/&gt;
**[[Heart failure|Congestive heart failure]]* is the result of any severe, overwhelming heart disease that most commonly results in pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs), pleural effusion (fluid around the lungs), and/or ascites (fluid in the abdomen). It can be caused by the above two diseases, [[congenital heart defect]]s such as [[patent ductus arteriosus]], [[pulmonary hypertension]], heartworm (''[[Dirofilaria immitis]]'') disease, or pericardial effusion. Signs depend on which side of the heart is affected. Left-sided heart failure results in rapid and/or difficulty breathing and sometimes coughing from a build-up of fluid in the lungs ([[pulmonary edema]]). Right-sided heart failure results in a large liver (congestion) and build-up of fluid in the abdomen ([[ascites]]), uncommonly fluid around the lungs ([[pleural effusion]]), or, rarely, peripheral edema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Heart Disease and Heart Failure: Introduction | work = The Merck Veterinary Manual | year = 2006 | url = http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/11200.htm | accessdate = 2006-12-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
**[[Sick sinus syndrome]]* is most commonly seen in female [[Miniature Schnauzer]]s. It is characterized by [[sinoatrial node]] dysfunction and may include [[atrioventricular node]] disease and [[bundle branch block]]. [[Electrocardiogram]] findings include [[sinus bradycardia]], [[sinus arrest]], [[sinoatrial heart block]], and [[atrial tachycardia]]. The major clinical sign is fainting (syncope).&lt;ref name=Abbott_2000/&gt;
** [[Heart defects]]
***[[Subvalvular aortic stenosis (non-human)|Subvalvular aortic stenosis]] (Subaortic stenosis; SAS) is a [[congenital disorder|congenital disease]] in dogs characterized by left [[ventricular outflow tract]] obstruction by a discrete ring or tunnel of fibrous tissue immediately below the aortic valve. It is inherited in [[Newfoundland (dog)|Newfoundland]]s, and also found in [[Golden Retriever]]s, [[Rottweiler]]s, [[Boxer (dog)|Boxer]]s, [[Bulldog]]s, [[German Shepherd]]s, and [[Samoyed (dog)|Samoyed]]s. Signs include a left basilar systolic heart murmur, weak femoral pulse, fainting and exercise intolerance. Dogs with severe SAS are predisposed to dying suddenly.&lt;ref name=Abbott_2000/&gt;
***[[Pulmonic stenosis]]* is a congenital heart disease in dogs characterized by right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Most commonly the narrowing occurs at the [[pulmonary valve]] but it can also occur below the valve (subvalvular) or above the valve (supravalvular). The most commonly affected breeds include terriers, [[Bulldog]]s, [[Miniature Schnauzer]]s, [[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahua]]s, [[Samoyed (dog)|Samoyed]]s, [[Beagle]]s, [[Keeshond]]s, [[English Mastiff|Mastiff]]s, and [[Bullmastiff]]s. Signs may include exercise intolerance, but often there is only a [[heart murmur]].&lt;ref name=Abbott_2000/&gt;
***[[Ventricular septal defect]]* is a hole in the division between the heart ventricles (interventricular septum). It is a congenital heart disease in dogs. There usually are no signs in dogs except for a heart murmur. However, a large defect can result in heart failure or in pulmonary hypertension leading to a right-to-left shunt.&lt;ref name=Abbott_2000/&gt;
***[[Atrial septal defect]]* is a hole in the division between the heart atria (upper chambers of the heart). It is an uncommon abnormality in dogs. Most are not clinically significant, but large defects can cause right heart failure and exercise intolerance. Standard Poodles are the most common breed diagnosed with ASD in the USA.&lt;ref name=Abbott_2000/&gt;
***[[Tetralogy of Fallot]]* is a congenital heart defect in dogs that includes four separate defects: pulmonic stenosis, a ventricular septal defect, right [[ventricular hypertrophy]], and an [[overriding aorta]]. Keeshonds and Bulldogs are predisposed. Signs include cyanosis and exercise intolerance. Polycythemia is often present and, if severe, needs to be controlled with phlebotomy or drugs to suppress red blood cell production.&lt;ref name=Abbott_2000/&gt;
***[[Patent ductus arteriosus]]* is one of the most common congenital heart defect in dogs around the world. It is inherited in toy and miniature [[Poodle]]s, and seen commonly in [[German Shepherd]]s, [[Pomeranian (dog)|Pomeranian]]s, [[Bichon Frise]]s, and [[Maltese (dog)|Maltese]]s. Signs include a continuous heart murmur, bounding (strong) femoral pulse, tachypnea (increased breathing rate), dyspnea (labored breathing), and exercise intolerance.&lt;ref name=Abbott_2000/&gt;
***[[Heart valve dysplasia]] (including mitral and tricuspid valve dysplasia) is a congenital heart abnormality in dogs. Dysplasia of the mitral and tricuspid valves - also known as the atrioventricular (AV) valves - can appear as thickened, shortened, or notched valves. [[Chordae tendineae]] are also usually abnormal.&lt;ref name=Abbott_2000/&gt;
***[[Cor triatriatum]]*, specifically cor triatriatum dexter, occurs in dogs and is characterized by a fibrous division of the right atrium into two chambers, usually with a hole in between them. It results in right heart failure (ascites). It can be treated by [[balloon valvuloplasty]] or surgical resection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Miscellaneous Congenital Cardiac Abnormalities | work = The Merck Veterinary Manual | year = 2006 | url = http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/11118.htm | accessdate = 2006-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Pericardial effusion]]* is a collection of fluid in the [[pericardium]]. It is usually serosanguinous (bloody fluid). Serosanguinous accumulation can be caused by cancer, usually [[hemangiosarcoma]] or a heart base tumor, [[idiopathic]] pericarditis. Rare causes include trauma, clotting disorders, and left atrial rupture. Serous accumulation is rare and caused by heart failure, peritoneopericardial [[diaphragmatic hernia]]s, [[uremia]], [[pericardial cyst]]s, or [[hypoalbuminemia]]. Rarely pericardial effusion can be caused by infection and consist of [[pus]]. An [[echocardiogram]] should be done prior to draining the fluid, if possible, to identify the cause (e.g., tumor). Drainage of the fluid ([[pericardiocentesis]]) relieves the clinical signs and, in the case of idiopathic pericarditis, can be curative.&lt;ref name=Abbott_2000/&gt;
*[[Pulmonary hypertension]]* is high pressure in the [[pulmonary artery]]. In dogs it can be caused by [[heartworm]] disease, [[pulmonary embolism|pulmonary thromboembolism]], or chronic [[hypoxemia]] (low oxygen). It can result in right-sided heart disease ([[cor pulmonale]]). Signs include difficulty breathing, cyanosis, and exercise intolerance.&lt;ref name=Abbott_2000/&gt;
*Trapped Neutrophil Syndrome* is an autosomal recessive disease which results in mature [[neutrophil]]s being unable to migrate from the [[bone marrow]] into the [[blood]]. Affected pups have chronic [[infection]]s and fail to thrive. Other symptoms can include stunted growth and a ferret like facial appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2052.2007.01565.x | last1 = Shearman | first1 = JR | last2 = Wilton | first2 = AN. | year = 2007| title = Elimination of ''neutrophil elastase'' and adaptor protein complex 3 subunit genes as the cause of trapped neutrophil syndrome in Border collies | url = | journal = Animal Genetics | volume = 38 | issue = 2| pages = 188–189 | pmid = 17302793 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The disease is common in [[Border collies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = TNS DNA Border Collie Test Results | url = http://www.bordercolliehealth.com/TNSdatabase.html | accessdate = 2008-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nervous system===
*[[Syringomyelia]]* is a condition where a fluid filled sac develops in the spinal cord. The most important cause in dogs is by a [[Arnold-Chiari malformation|Chiari I malformation]], which is when an underdeveloped [[occipital bone]] interferes with spinal fluid circulation and results in fluid accumulation in the cervical spinal cord. This is a [[congenital disorder|congenital disease]] most commonly found in small breeds such as the [[Brussels Griffon]] and the [[Cavalier King Charles Spaniel]]. Other breeds known to be affected include the [[Bichon Frise]], [[Boston terrier]], [[bull terrier]], [[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahua]], [[French bulldog]], [[Havanese dog|Havanese]], [[King Charles spaniel]] (the English toy spaniel), [[Maltese dog|Maltese]], miniature dachshunds, miniature and toy poodles, [[Papillon dog|Papillon]], [[Pomeranian (dog)|Pomeranian]], [[Pugs]], [[Shih Tzu]], [[Staffordshire bull terrier]], and the [[Yorkshire terrier]].

*[[Foreign body]] is an object foreign to the body that becomes lodged in the gastrointestinal tract (or other part of the dog). Dogs are susceptible to gastrointestinal obstruction due to their ability to swallow relatively large objects and pass them through the esophagus.

Newer rodenticides may contain [[bromethalin]] which causes central nervous system signs such as seizures, muscle tremors, and depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Rodenticide Poisoning: Introduction | work = The Merck Veterinary Manual | year = 2006 | url = http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/213000.htm | accessdate = 2007-01-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Insecticide]]s* used in dogs for fleas and ticks commonly contain either [[organophosphate]]s or [[carbamate]]s. they can be absorbed through the skin, [[conjunctiva]], gastrointestinal tract, and lungs. Organophosphates inhibit [[acetylcholinesterase]] irreversibly and carbamates inhibit [[cholinesterase]] reversibly. Toxicity occurs through overdosage with an appropriate product or use of an agricultural product. Signs for both include hypersalivation, vomiting, lethargy, tremors, difficulty walking, weakness, and death.&lt;ref name=Wingfield/&gt;
*[[Theobromine poisoning|Chocolate]] is a common cause of poisoning in dogs. The toxic principles in chocolate are [[theobromine]] and [[caffeine]]. [[Baker's Chocolate]] is the most dangerous form since it contains higher concentrations of these drugs, followed by semi-sweet, dark, and then milk chocolate. Signs include vomiting, diarrhea, tremors, difficulty walking, seizures, and heart problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Chocolate | work = The Merck Veterinary Manual | year = 2006 | url = http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/211104.htm | accessdate = 2007-01-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Lead poisoning]]* is uncommon in dogs. Exposure to lead is from eating paint chips from lead-based paint (found in houses painted prior to 1950), and eating lead objects such as [[Lead shot|shot]], [[Sinker (fishing)|fishing sinker]]s, or counterweights. Signs of poisoning include vomiting, diarrhea, blindness, seizures, and tremors.&lt;ref name=Wingfield/&gt;
*[[Grape and raisin toxicity in dogs|Raisins and grapes]] are potential causes of kidney failure in dogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Raisins/Grapes | work = The Merck Veterinary Manual | year = 2006 | url = http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/211106.htm | accessdate = 2007-01-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Garlic &amp; Onions]]* are toxic to dogs. Onions, Garlic, Chives - can cause the destruction of red blood cells known as Heinz body anemia, a form of hemolytic anemia. No clear quantity has been established as to the onset of the anemia. But for garlic, if your dog consumes the equivalent of 1 teaspoon of garlic for every 10 pounds of their weight (1 teaspoon for a 10-pound dog) it can destroy red blood cells. Poisonous reaction can result from raw, cooked or dried onions, garlic, chives, including those included in powdered or dehydrated forms. Avoid all foods that contain onions or onion variants (such as spaghetti sauce).

==Miscellaneous==
&lt;!-- at the moment, "misc" just means I haven't sorted them or don't have good subheads for them. -elf --&gt;
*[[Vestibular disease]]* is an uncommon condition in older dogs. Most cases are [[idiopathic]], but it can also be caused by [[otitis interna]], or inner ear infection, tumors, and [[encephalitis]]. Signs include [[nystagmus]], head tilt, circling, vomiting, and falling to one side. Idiopathic vestibular disease will usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = LeCouteur | first = Richard A. | title = Vestibular Diseases of Cats and Dogs | work = Proceedings of the 28th World Congress of the World Small Animal Veterinary Association | year = 2003 | url = http://www.vin.com/proceedings/Proceedings.plx?CID=WSAVA2003&amp;PID=6650&amp;O=Generic | accessdate = 2007-01-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Molera]] (hole in skull), better known as an open [[fontanelle]], may be a sign of [[hydrocephalus]], but is also a normal finding in toy breeds such as [[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahua]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = What is hydrocephalus? | work = Canine Inherited Disorders Database | publisher = University of Prince Edward Island | year = 2001 | url = http://www.upei.ca/cidd/Diseases/nervous%20system%20disorders/hydrocephalus.htm | accessdate = 2007-01-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Anal gland]] problems are very common, and may include impaction, infection, or abscessation. These glands are normally emptied when the dog defecates.
*[[Shar Pei fever]] is characterized by recurring fever and swelling of the hocks in [[Shar Pei]]s. It can result in renal and liver failure.&lt;ref name=Ettinger_1995/&gt;
*[[Liver failure]]* is common. Signs include vomiting, loss of appetite, weight loss, and [[jaundice]]. Causes include bacterial or viral infection, toxic insult, cancer, [[copper storage disease]]s, or it may be idiopathic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Hepatic Disease in Small Animals: Introduction | work = The Merck Veterinary Manual | year = 2006 | url = http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/23600.htm | accessdate = 2007-01-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Dental disease]] is very common. [[Calculus (dental)|Calculus]] is the most obvious sign, but [[gingivitis]] progressing to [[periodontitis]] is what results in tooth loss. Treatment involves scaling and polishing of the teeth under general anesthesia and treatment of any periodontal disease. Prevention is very important and can be accomplished through the use of special diets or treats, brushing, and plaque prevention gels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Periodontal Disease | work = The Merck Veterinary Manual | year = 2006 | url = http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/20408.htm | accessdate = 2007-01-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Portosystemic shunt]] is a bypass of the liver by the body's circulatory system. It can be either a congenital or acquired condition.
*[[Perineal hernia]] is characterized by herniation of abdominal contents through the pelvic diaphragm, which causes swelling on one side of the anus.
*[[Primary ciliary dyskinesia]]* is a dysfunction of [[cilia]], which manifests as [[spermatozoon|sperm]] immotility and respiratory disease. Signs include nasal discharge, recurring pneumonia, and infertility. Symptoms develop soon after birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Edwards|first1=DF|last2=Patton|first2=CS|last3=Kennedy|first3=JR|title=Primary ciliary dyskinesia in the dog.|journal=Problems in Veterinary Medicine|date=June 1992|volume=4|issue=2|pages=291–319|pmid=1643316}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Cleft lip and cleft palate#Other animals|Cleft lip and cleft palate]] are uncommon and generally cause difficulty with nursing, and, more seriously [[aspiration pneumonia]].&lt;ref name=Ettinger_1995/&gt;
*[[Congenital diaphragmatic hernia]]* is uncommon, and is usually caused by trauma. Congenital diaphragmatic hernias are usually communications between the [[peritoneum]] and [[pericardium]] and are usually incidental findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Diaphragmatic Hernia: Introduction | work = The Merck Veterinary Manual | year = 2006 | url = http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/120400.htm | accessdate = 2007-01-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Gingival enlargement#Other animals|Gingival hyperplasia]] is seen in [[cephalic index|brachycephalic]] breeds, especially [[Boxer (dog)|Boxer]]s. It is generally benign, although food and hair impaction is common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Gingival Fibroma and Epulides | work = The Merck Veterinary Manual | year = 2006 | url = http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/20410.htm | accessdate = 2007-01-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Salmon poisoning disease]] is a fatal disease caused by infection with a [[rickettsia]], either ''Neorickettsia helminthoeca'' or ''Neorickettsia elokominica''. Dogs are infected by eating raw [[salmon]] from the [[Pacific Northwest]].&lt;ref name=Ettinger_1995/&gt;
*[[Adverse vaccine reactions in pets|Vaccine reaction]]s are adverse events which occur following vaccination, including [[granuloma]] formation, but most commonly the term vaccine reaction is used to describe a type I [[hypersensitivity]] reaction. The most common signs are facial swelling and [[urticaria|hives]], but more rarely very serious signs such as [[hypotension]] and collapse may occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Greene | first = Craig E. | title = Avoiding Vaccine Reactions in Dogs and Cats | work = Proceedings of the 28th World Congress of the World Small Animal Veterinary Association | year = 2003 | url = http://www.vin.com/proceedings/Proceedings.plx?CID=WSAVA2003&amp;PID=6547&amp;O=Generic | accessdate = 2007-01-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Systemic lupus erythematosus]] (SLE)* is an immune system disease characterized by the presence of [[antibody|antibodies]] to [[nucleic acid]] and/or antibodies to [[red blood cell]]s, [[platelet]]s, [[lymphocyte]]s, [[clotting factor]]s, and [[thyroglobulin]]. The disease can result in deposition of [[immune complex]]es or [[autoimmunity|autoimmune disease]]. Immune complex deposition can cause [[vasculitis]], [[meningitis]], [[neuritis]], and joint and skin disease. The most commons signs are [[hemolytic anemia]] or [[thrombocytopenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Diseases Involving Immune Complexes | work = The Merck Veterinary Manual | year = 2006 | url = http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/60208.htm | accessdate = 2007-01-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Myasthenia gravis]]* results from the presence of antibodies to the [[acetylcholine receptor]]. Signs include [[megaesophagus]] and muscle weakness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Myasthenia Gravis | work = The Merck Veterinary Manual | year = 2006 | url = http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/60207.htm | accessdate = 2007-01-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Tetanus]]* is a disease caused by the bacteria ''[[Clostridium tetani]]'' following wound contamination. Dogs are not very susceptible to tetanus. Signs include difficulty opening the mouth and eating, contraction of the facial muscles, and rigid extension of the limbs. Dogs may also get localized tetanus, signs of which include stiffness of a limb spreading to the rest of the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Braund, K. G.|year=2003|title=Neurotoxic Disorders|work=Braund's Clinical Neurology in Small Animals: Localization, Diagnosis and Treatment| url=http://www.ivis.org/advances/Vite/braund22/chapter_frm.asp?LA=1|accessdate=2007-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Polydactyly]]* is the occurrence of extra toes, generally on the preaxial ([[dewclaw]]) side. This is more common in certain breeds, such as the [[Great Pyrenees]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jezyk, P. F.|year=1985|title=Constitutional Disorders of the Skeleton in Dogs and Cats|work=Textbook of Small Animal Orthopaedics| url=http://www.ivis.org/special_books/ortho/chapter_57/57mast.asp|accessdate=2007-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Tracheal collapse]] is characterized by incomplete formation or weakening of the cartilagenous rings of the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]]. It is most common in small and toy breeds. Signs include a cough (often called a "goose honk cough" due to its sound), especially when excited.&lt;ref name=Ettinger_1995/&gt;
*[[Brachycephalic airway obstructive syndrome]] is a condition of brachycephalic (short-nosed) dogs, characterized by the presence of [[stenotic nares]], elongated [[soft palate]], narrow trachea, collapsed [[larynx]], and everted [[laryngeal saccules]]. Signs include difficult and noisy breathing. Surgical options are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Monnet | first = Eric | title = Brachycephalic Airway Syndrome | work = Proceedings of the 29th World Congress of the World Small Animal Veterinary Association | year = 2004 | url = http://www.vin.com/proceedings/Proceedings.plx?CID=WSAVA2004&amp;PID=8768&amp;O=Generic | accessdate = 2007-01-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26050">A number of online [[neuroscience]] databases are available which provide information regarding [[gene expression]], [[neurons]], [[macroscopic]] brain structure, and [[neurological]] or [[psychiatric]] disorders. Some databases contain descriptive and numerical data, some to brain function, others offer access to 'raw' imaging data, such as [[postmortem]] brain sections or 3D [[MRI]] and [[fMRI]] images. Some focus on the human brain, others on non-human.

As the number of databases that seek to disseminate information about the structure, development and function of the brain has grown, so has the need to collate these resources themselves. As a result, there now exist databases of neuroscience databases, some of which reach over 3000 entries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://neuinfo.org/mynif/search.php?q=database&amp;first=true&amp;t=indexable&amp;nif=nlx_144509-1 |title=Number of entries using search query 'database' |website= neuinfo.org |publisher= NIF |access-date=25 Jan 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10409">'''Location theory''' has become an integral part of [[economic geography]], [[regional science]], and spatial economics. Location theory addresses questions of what economic activities are located where and why. Location theory or [[microeconomics|microeconomic theory]] generally assumes that agents act in their own self-interest. Firms thus choose locations that maximize their profits and individuals choose locations that maximize their utility.

==Origins==
While others should get some credit for earlier work (e.g., [[Richard Cantillon]], [[Etienne Bonnot de Condillac]], [[David Hume]], [[James Denham-Steuart|Sir James D. Steuart]], and [[David Ricardo]]), it was not until the publication of [[Johann Heinrich von Thünen]]'s first volume of ''Der Isolierte Staat'' in 1826 that location theory can be said to have really gotten underway.&lt;ref&gt;Thünen, Johann Heinrich von. 1783–1850. ''Der Isolierte Staat in Beziehung auf Landwirtschaft und Nationalökonomie, oder Untersuchungen über den Einfluss, den die Getreidepreise, der Reichtum des Bodens und die Abgaben auf den Ackerbau ausüben, Vol. 1,.'' and ''Der Isolierte Staat..., Vol II: Der Naturgeässe Arbeitslohn und dessen Verhältnis zum Zinsfuss und zur Landrente, Part 1'' (Partial translation into English by Carla M. Wartenberg in 1966 as ''Isolated State.'' New York: Pergamon Press.) For more information, see [http://www.csiss.org/classics/content/9 Scott Crosier's ''Johann-Heinrich von Thünen: Balancing Land-Use Allocation with Transport Cost''].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dempsey, Bernard W. 1960. ''The Frontier Wage'' Chicago: Loyola University Press. In pages 187–367 Dempsey has translated von Thünen 1863 piece ''Der Isolierte Staat, Vol II, Part 2'' as ''The Isolated State in Relation to Agriculture and Political Economy, Vol. II: The Natural Wage and Its Relation to the Rate of Interest and to Economic Rent.''&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the prominent [[regional science|regional scientist]] [[Walter Isard]] has called von Thünen "the father of location theorists."&lt;ref&gt;Isard (1956, p. 27).&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Der Isolierte Staat'', von Thünen notes that the costs of transporting goods consumes some of Ricardo's economic rent. He notes that because these transportation costs and, of course, economic rents, vary across goods, different land uses and use intensities will result with increased distance from the marketplace. However, the discussion was criticized since [[Johann Heinrich von Thünen]] oversimplified the problem with his assumptions of, for example, isolated states or single cities.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, H. A. (1962). Transportation Costs and Plant Location: A Review of Principal Theories. ''Transportation Journal, 2''(2), 19–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tord Palander (1935) wrote: Market area division of two competing firms.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PA5FalH0CeAC&amp;pg=PA676&amp;lpg=PA676&amp;dq=tord+polander&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QOdLjSbQpH&amp;sig=fpst81q6y8MWQA-dBLc8Rdzxonk&amp;hl=bs&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=saXrToP_Lqv74QTko_DoCA&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=tord%20polander&amp;f=false Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

A German hegemony of sorts seems to have taken hold in location theory from the time of von Thünen through to [[Walter Christaller]]'s 1933 book ''Die Zentralen Orte in Sűddeutschland'', which formulated much of what is now understood as [[central place theory]]. An especially notable contribution was made by [[Alfred Weber]], who published ''Über den Standort der Industrien'' in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Alfred. 1929. (translated by Carl J. Friedrich from Weber's 1909 book). ''Theory of the Location of Industries''. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press.  For more details see [http://www.csiss.org/classics/content/51 David Fearon's ''Alfred Weber: Theory of the Location of Industries, 1909''].&lt;/ref&gt; Working from a model akin to a physical frame adapted from some ideas by [[Pierre Varignon]] (a [[Varignon frame]]), Weber applies freight rates of resources and finished goods, along with the finished good's production function, to develop an algorithm that identifies the optimal location for manufacturing plant. He also introduces distortions induced by labor and both agglomerative and deglomerative forces. Weber then discusses groupings of production units, anticipating Lösch's market areas. 

[[Wilhelm Launhardt|Carl Wilhelm Friedrich Launhardt]] conceived much of that for which Alfred Weber received credit, prior to Weber's work. Moreover, his contributions are surprisingly more modern in their analytical content than are Weber's. This suggests that Launhardt was ahead of his time and not readily understood by many of his contemporaries. Whether Weber was familiar with Launhardt's publications remains unclear. Weber was most certainly influenced by others, most notably [[Wilhelm Roscher]] and [[Albert Schäffle]], who seem likely to have read Launhardt's work. Regardless, location theoretical thought blossomed only after Weber's book was published.

Literature on site selection theory used to look until recent years at the various issues only from a national point of view. By large, there are no international reviews to be found in these publications. In the US, a country in which industrial site selection played a role very early on, resulting in a very early search for methodical approaches, Edgar M. Hoover was one of the leading pioneers in the field of site analysis.  In his book “The Location of Economic Activity”,  Hoover compiled crucial criteria of industrial site selection as early as 1948 that still apply today. There were, however, some quite early attempts to combine theories of international trade with nationally oriented site theories in order to develop a site theory with an international perspective. One of these early authors was Ohlin (1952), followed by Sabathil (1969) , Moore (1978),   Tesch (1980),   and Goette (1994) .

Nevertheless, even to this day, this situation has only changed to some extent. Even though since the 1990s it has no longer been only major corporations that expand abroad, and any foreign direct investment results in a site selection, there are still very few well-researched studies on this topic. A specifically international site selection theory is still not discernible. Many current and more recent publications either review site decisions made by individual corporations or analyze them as reference cases. Other publications focus on a cost-specific approach largely driven by site relocations in the context of cost structure optimization within major corporations. However, these publications only rarely and at best cursorily deal with issues of construction and real estate aspects.

Theodor Sabathil’s 1969 dissertation is considered one of the early in-depth studies in the area of international site selection. Therein, Sabathil largely focused on country selection, which is part of the site selection process. In this context, Sabathil compiled a comprehensive catalogue of site factors and a theoretical approach to site selection; the latter does not go into great detail. Neither does Sabathil take any legal, natural, or cultural site factors into consideration. However, he discusses in particular company-specific framework conditions and psychological factors.&lt;ref&gt; Glatte, Thomas 2015. ''Location Strategies: Methods and their methodological limitations'' Journal for Engineering, Design and Technology, Volume 13, Issue 3, p. 435 - 462 &lt;/ref&gt;

The dissertation submitted in 1980 by Peter Tesch constitutes another milestone in the further development of international site theory. Tesch combines theories of international trade and investment with site theories. He is the first to include country-specific framework conditions in his analysis. The main basis for his comments on the various types of internationalization are location-specific competitive advantages. In this context, Tesch developed a catalogue of criteria for international site decisions grouped into three categories:
•	site factors affecting all company activities
•	availability and costs of the site factors impacting on the production factors
•	turnover-related site factors.

Thomas Goette’s 1994 study tries to classify important international site factors and to structure the process of international site selection. Goette distinguishes between economic site conditions (sales potential, competitive conditions, infrastructure and transportation costs, labor, monetary conditions), political site conditions (tax legislation, environmental protection, institutional market entry barriers, support of business, political risks), cultural site conditions (differences in language, mentality, religion, and the lack of acceptancy of foreign companies), and geographical site conditions (climate, topography). This study again demonstrates that an attempt to cover all aspects will result in loss of quality as all factors were not or could not be taken into consideration. Goette also theorizes that, in particular, industrial site decisions within companies are usually once-off and division-related decision-making processes. Based on this, Goette assumes a relatively low learning curve, and hence little potential for improvement for subsequent projects.

As one of the last major contributions, Thomas Glatte aimed to enhance and globalize the known systems in his book "International Production Site Selection" by providing a 10-staged selection process, suggesting selected methods for each selection stage and offering a comprehensive list of criteria for the practitioner.&lt;ref&gt;Glatte, Thomas 2013.

'''Milford "Mel" Joseph Hunter''' (July 27, 1927 &amp;ndash; February 20, 2004) was a 20th-century [[United States|American]] [[illustrator]]. He enjoyed a successful career as a [[science fiction]] illustrator, producing illustrations for famous science fiction authors such as [[Isaac Asimov]] and [[Robert A. Heinlein]], as well as a technical and scientific illustrator for clients such as [[The Pentagon]], [[Hayden Planetarium]], and the [[Massachusetts Audubon Society]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Mel Hunter's life began with a troubled childhood in [[Oak Park, Illinois]], where he was physically and psychologically [[child abuse|abused]] by a humorless [[father]]. "He never knew his mother because she was banished from the household by his father when he was only two years old. While he never forgot the abuse, he didn't seem to dwell on it. Instead, he poured himself into his work and [[career]]," said his third wife, Susan Smith-Hunter.&lt;ref&gt;Mel Hunter, February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Hunter entered college a year early, at [[Northwestern University]] in [[Evanston, Illinois|Evanston]], [[Illinois]]. After college he held a variety of odd jobs, but finally landed a draftsman job at Northrop Aircraft Corp in California. In 1950, Hunter decided to pursue a career in art and began to teach himself illustration in his spare time.

===Science Fiction Illustration===
[[Image:Universe science fiction 195312.jpg|thumb|right|"Sunbathing in Space", 1953]]

With a growing understanding of the fields of [[astronomy]], [[astronautics]], and [[aviation]] Hunter set out to teach himself book and magazine illustration. He moved to New York City during the early 1950s, and by 1953 he had successfully sold his first color cover to [[Galaxy Science Fiction]] magazine and talked himself into a technical illustrator at Northrop Aircraft where he painted illustrations of advanced aircraft and simulated combat scenarios.

During that time, the most lucrative outlet for space artists was the [[science-fiction]] genre. Along with a fertile [[imagination]], Hunter coupled his art with [[Realism (visual arts)|realism]] and technical accuracy. Hunter's whimsical science fiction robots became his signature to thousands of science fiction fans; the skeletal steel robots graced the covers of the [[The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction|Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction]] well into the 1970s. Hunter's lonely robots were often depicted walking solo through the desolate landscapes of nuclear ruins or alien planets.

Hunter was nominated for the [[Hugo Award for Best Professional Artist]] for the years 1960-1962.

===Technical and Scientific Illustration===
[[Image:Mel Hunter Painting 1.jpg|thumb|left|Sample of Mel Hunter's scientific illustration.]]

As Hunter's science fiction career blossomed, so did his technical and scientific illustrations. Hunter's love of air and space took him from California's desert runways to Florida's seacoast launchpads to illustrate every variety of jet-age aircraft and space-age rocket imaginable—from X-15 to Saturn V.

One of Hunter's best-known books is "The Missilemen", a photo illustrated work published in 1960 by [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]]. Hunter visited [[United States|U.S.]] rocket and [[missile]] sites during the late 1950s; he took all of the book's black-and-white [[photographs]]. It was a  rare look inside the world of rocket scientists and [[engineers]] of the early [[space age]].  Another Hunter book, "Strategic Air Command", received the Aviation Writers' Association highest honors in 1961.

"Mel launched a career in [[scientific illustration]] after he was an established science-fiction illustrator," said Smith-Hunter. "He was very technically accurate and was commissioned to complete 26 [[paintings]] of celestial objects for the Hayden Planetarium in New York City."&lt;ref&gt;Mel Hunter, June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Naturalistic Lithography===
[[Image:Mel Hunter Natural Painting.jpg|thumb|right|An original lithography by Mel Hunter.]]
After 17 years of technical and scientific illustration, Hunter moved from New York to Chester, Vermont in 1967. He began creating lithographic prints depicting the natural scenes which surrounded him. The following year, he was commissioned to create a series of more than 130 watercolors of "Birds of the Northeast" by Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Galleries and Massachusetts Audubon Society. By 1970, Hunter signed a contract with World Publishing Co. for a series of 13 ecological books for children, dealing with topics like the beginning of the earth, mankind, plants, birds, mammals and insects.

In 1976, after accidental damage to his limestone lithographic drawing, Hunter began using mylar as a medium for his lithography, and published a controversial photo-illustrated article in the American Artist Magazine entitled "Revolution in Hand-Drawn Lithography". In 1984, Hunter published his seminal hardcover textbook, ''The New Lithography'' which details the "Mylar Method", still in wide use today.

===Death===
Although diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease in the 1990s, Hunter died of [[bone cancer]] in February 2004. True to his final wish, an attempt was made to launch his cremated remains into [[space]]. A private launch, coordinated by Space Services Inc. on the [http://www.celestis.com/newfrontierFlight.asp New Frontier Flight] was successful on May 22, 2012.

According to Bernard Ortiz De Montellano of [[Wayne State University]], "The alleged properties of melanin, mostly unsupported, irrelevant, or distortions of the scientific literature, are (...) used to justify [[Afrocentrism|Afrocentric]] assertions.

{{GeoGroup|article=Operation Latchkey}}

'''Operation Latchkey'''&lt;ref name=LT_1 /&gt; was a series of 38 [[nuclear test]]s conducted by the United States in 1966-1967 at the [[Nevada Test Site]]. These tests followed the ''[[Operation Flintlock (nuclear test)]]'' series and preceded the ''[[Operation Crosstie]]'' series.

 |-
 !style="background:#ffdead;" | Name &lt;ref group=note&gt;The US, France and Great Britain have code-named their test events, while the USSR and China did not, and therefore have only test numbers (with some exceptions &amp;ndash; Soviet peaceful explosions were named). Word translations into English in parentheses unless the name is a proper noun. A dash followed by a number indicates a member of a salvo event.  The US also sometimes named the individual explosions in such a salvo test, which results in "name1 &amp;ndash; 1(with name2)". If test is canceled or aborted, then the row data like date and location discloses the intended plans, where known.&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#efefef;" | Date time ([[Universal Time|UT]])
 !style="background:#ffdead;" | Local [[Time Zone|time zone]] &lt;ref group=note&gt;To convert the UT time into standard local, add the number of hours in parentheses to the UT time; for local daylight saving time, add one additional hour. If the result is earlier than 00:00, add 24 hours and subtract 1 from the day; if it is 24:00 or later, subtract 24 hours and add 1 to the day. All historical timezone data are derived from here:&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Timezone Historical Database| publisher=iana.com| url=http://www.ietf.org/timezones/| accessdate=March 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#efefef;" | [[List of nuclear test sites|Location]] &lt;ref group=note&gt;Rough place name and a latitude/longitude reference; for rocket-carried tests, the launch location is specified before the detonation location, if known. Some locations are extremely accurate; others (like airdrops and space blasts) may be quite inaccurate. "~" indicates a likely pro-forma rough location, shared with other tests in that same area.&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#ffdead;" | [[Elevation]] + height &lt;ref group=note&gt;Elevation is the ground level at the point directly below the explosion relative to sea level; height is the additional distance added or subtracted by tower, balloon, shaft, tunnel, air drop or other contrivance. For rocket bursts the ground level is "N/A". In some cases it is not clear if the height is absolute or relative to ground, for example, ''Plumbbob/John''.  No number or units indicates the value is unknown, while "0" means zero. Sorting on this column is by elevation and height added together.&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#efefef;" | Delivery &lt;ref group=note&gt;Atmospheric, airdrop, balloon, gun, cruise missile, rocket, surface, tower, and barge are all disallowed by the [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]]. Sealed shaft and tunnel are underground, and remained useful under the PTBT. Intentional cratering tests are borderline; they occurred under the treaty, were sometimes protested, and generally overlooked if the test was declared to be a peaceful use.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purpose &lt;ref group=note&gt;Include weapons development, weapon effects, safety test, transport safety test, war, science, joint verification and industrial/peaceful, which may be further broken down.&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#efefef;" | [[List of nuclear weapons|Device]] &lt;ref group=note&gt;Designations for test items where known, "?" indicates some uncertainty about the preceding value, nicknames for particular devices in quotes. This category of information is often not officially disclosed.&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#ffdead;" | [[Nuclear weapon yield|Yield]] &lt;ref group=note&gt;Estimated energy yield in [[TNT equivalent|tons, kilotons, and megatons]]. A ton of TNT equivalent is defined as 4.184&amp;nbsp;gigajoules (1&amp;nbsp;gigacalorie).&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#efefef;" class="unsortable" | [[Nuclear fallout|Fallout]] &lt;ref group=note&gt;Radioactive emission to the atmosphere aside from prompt neutrons, where known.  The measured species is only iodine-131 if mentioned, otherwise it is all species. No entry means unknown, probably none if underground and "all" if not; otherwise notation for whether measured on the site only or off the site, where known, and the measured amount of radioactivity released.&lt;/ref&gt;

It allowed software developers and early adopters to test a preview of the upcoming operating system and develop software for the forthcoming operating system before its final release.
***[[Mac OS X v10.0|Cheetah (10.0)]] &amp;ndash; the first [[Software version|major release]] of Mac OS X, Apple's desktop and server operating system. Mac OS X v10.0 was released on March 24, 2001. It was the successor of the [[Mac OS X Public Beta]] and the predecessor of Mac OS X v10.1. Mac OS X v10.0 was a radical departure from the previous “classic” Macintosh operating system and was Apple’s long-awaited answer to the call for a next generation Macintosh operating system.
***[[Mac OS X v10.1|Puma (10.1)]] &amp;ndash; the second major release of Mac OS X. Apple introduced many features that were missing from the last version, as well as improving overall system performance.
***[[Mac OS X Jaguar|Jaguar (10.2)]] &amp;ndash; the third major release of Mac OS X. It was seen as a large step forward in the areas of stability, general speed enhancements, compatibility with other flavors of [[Unix]] and the lineup of both graphical and command line applications available

'''Quindar tones''', most often referred to as the "beeps" that were heard during the American [[Apollo program|Apollo]] space missions, were a means by which remote transmitters on [[Earth]] were turned on and off so that the [[Capsule communicator]] (CapCom) could communicate with the crews of the spacecraft. It was a means of [[in-band signaling]] to simulate the action of the [[push-to-talk]] and release-to-listen (often referred to as PTT) button commonly found on two-way radio systems and [[walkie-talkies]].

==The need for Quindar tones==
When [[Mission Control]] (in [[Houston, Texas]]) wanted to talk to astronauts, the [[capsule communicator]] (CAPCOM) pushed a button (push-to-talk, or PTT) that turned on the transmitter, then spoke, then released the button.  When the transmitter is local, this is easy to arrange - the transmitter is connected directly to the PTT button.  But to stay in continuous contact with the astronauts as they orbit the Earth, or travel to the Moon, [[NASA]] had to use [[tracking station]]s all around the world, switching from one station to the next as needed. To get the voice signal to the remote transmitter, dedicated telephone lines connected these stations to Houston. NASA could either build a parallel system for operating the transmitters - one line to carry the audio and another to carry the control signal for the PTT button ([[out-of-band signaling|out-of-band signalling]]), or combine these two systems together, using audio tones to turn the transmitter on and off.  Since dedicated phone lines were a very expensive measure at the time, NASA chose the use of tones to reduce the operating cost of the network.&lt;ref name=MTC2006&gt;{{cite web|title=The Story Behind the Beep|url=http://apollo17.ehartwell.com/MissionTranscriptCollection.htm#Quindar|work=The Mission Transcript Collection|date=January 1, 2006|accessdate=August 17, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929033302/http://apollo17.ehartwell.com/MissionTranscriptCollection.htm#Quindar|archivedate=September 29, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The same system was used in [[Project Gemini]] and was still in use with half duplex [[UHF]] [[Space Shuttle]] communications for transmitter RF keying.

With modern digital communication systems, Quindar tones are no longer necessary because a single communication line (such as a fiber optic cable) can simultaneously carry multiple communication channels in the form of data comprising both speech and signaling (the PTT signal), as well as video and telemetry.

==Implementation of Quindar tones==
{{listen|filename=Quindar_tones.ogg|title=Quindar tones|description=The "intro tone", a 250-millisecond tone at 2,525 hertz, followed by a 250&amp;nbsp;ms 2,475&amp;nbsp;Hz "outro tone".}}
The Quindar system, named after its manufacturer, used two tones, both being pure sine waves that were 250ms long. The "intro tone" was generated at 2,525&amp;nbsp;Hz and signaled the "key down" key-press of the PTT button and unmuted the audio. The "outro tone" was slightly lower at 2,475&amp;nbsp;Hz and signalled the release of the PTT button and muted the audio. The two tones were generated by special equipment located at Mission Control, and they were decoded by detectors located at the various tracking stations.

The selection of the tones allowed them to travel in the same [[passband]] as a [[human voice]], which has a range from roughly 300&amp;nbsp;Hz to 3,000&amp;nbsp;Hz.

==Common misconceptions about Quindar tones==
Two common misconceptions surround Quindar tones. The first is that one tone came from [[Earth]] and the other from the transmitters used by the [[astronauts]] while in space. This confusion exists because many ground-to-space transmissions were initiated by Mission Control and responded to by the astronauts. In this sequence, the CapCom would press the PTT, which would send the intro tone, and then speak. When finished speaking, the CapCom would release the PTT, which would send the outro tone, and the astronauts would respond to Mission Control. Therefore, those transmissions would consist of a "beep" (PTT press) followed by Houston talking, then another "beep" (PTT release) and finally the voice of the astronauts.

Another misconception about Quindar tones is that they were designed to signal the end of a transmission, similar to a [[courtesy tone]] used on many [[half-duplex]] radio [[repeater]]s.  Although the astronauts may have secondarily used the Quindar outro tone to know when the CAPCOM had started/stopped speaking,&lt;ref name=MTC2006 /&gt; no equivalent existed for Mission Control because the astronauts keyed their transmissions locally (inside the spacecraft) using either a PTT or [[Voice-operated switch|VOX]], neither of which required Quindar tones.  Additionally, separate radio frequencies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |title=Functional Description of the Unified S-Band System and Integration into the Manned Space Flight network |author=W. P. Varson |publisher=NASA |booktitle=Proceedings of the Apollo Unified S-Band Conference |url=http://www.honeysucklecreek.net/images/pdfs/SP-87.pdf |pages=3–12 |accessdate=February 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowed both Houston and the astronauts to talk simultaneously if they wished and thereby made a courtesy tone as a way to minimize the possibility of both of them speaking at the same time unnecessary.

==Origin of the name==
Quindar tones were named for the manufacturer Quindar Electronics, Inc. Glen Swanson, historian at NASA's [[Johnson Space Center]] who edited the ''Mission Transcript Collection'', and Steve Schindler, an engineer with voice systems engineering at NASA's Kennedy Space Center, confirmed the origin of the name. "Quindar tones, named after the manufacturer of the tone generation and detection equipment, are actually used to turn on and off, or 'key', the remote transmitters at the various tracking stations."&lt;ref name=MTC2006/&gt;

In the domain of [[systems engineering]], '''Specialty Engineering''' is defined as and includes the engineering disciplines that are not typical of the main engineering effort.  More common engineering efforts in systems engineering such as [[Electronic hardware|hardware]], [[software]], and human factors engineering may be used as major elements in a majority of systems engineering efforts and therefore are not viewed as "special".  

Examples of specialty engineering include [[electromagnetic interference]], safety, and physical security.&lt;ref&gt;Eisner, Howard. (2002). "Essentials of Project and Systems Engineering Management". Wiley. p.217.&lt;/ref&gt;

Less common engineering domains such as electromagnetic interference, [[electrical grounding]], safety, security, electrical power filtering/uninterruptible supply, manufacturability, and environmental engineering may be included in systems engineering efforts where they have been identified to address special system implementations. These less common but just as important engineering efforts are then viewed as "specialty engineering".

However, if the specific system has a standard implementation of environmental or security for example, the situation is reversed and the human factors engineering or hardware/software engineering may be the "specialty engineering" domain. 

The key take away is; the context of the system engineering project and unique needs of the project are fundamental when thinking of what are the specialty engineering efforts.  

The benefit of citing "specialty engineering" in planning is the notice to all team levels that special management and science factors may need to be accounted for and may influence the project.

Specialty engineering may be cited by commercial entities and others to specify their unique abilities.

'''''The Stars: A New Way to See Them''''' is an astronomy book by [[H. A. Rey]]. It was first published in 1952 (Houghton Mifflin, Boston) and revised in 1962. It was updated again by Chris Dolan in 1997. Other editions were: Chatto and Windus, London, 1975; "A New Way to see the Stars" Paul Hamlyn, London, 1966; Enl. World-wide ed. Houghton Mifflin, 1967.

In this book, Rey set out to create a graphical, simpler view of the constellations that created a more realistic depiction of the images the constellations were supposed to represent.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Rey's interest in astronomy began during World War I and led to his desire to redraw constellation diagrams, which he found difficult to remember, so that they were more intuitive. This led to the 1952 publication of ''The Stars: A New Way to See Them,'' ({{ISBN|0-395-24830-2}}). His constellation diagrams were adopted widely and now appear in many astronomy guides, such as [[Donald H. Menzel]]'s ''A Field Guide to the Stars and Planets''. As of 2008 ''The Stars: A New Way to See Them,'' and a simplified presentation for children called ''Find the Constellations,'' are still in print. A new edition of ''Find the Constellations'' was released in 2008, updated with modern fonts, the new status of [[Pluto]], and some more current measurements of planetary sizes and orbital radii.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=French|first=Jeffrey A.|title=Grades 5 &amp; Up: REY, H.

[[File:Engine.f15.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|A [[Pratt &amp; Whitney F100]] jet engine is being tested. This engine generates thrust for a jet to propel it forward.]]

'''Thrust''' is a [[reaction (physics)|reaction]] [[force (physics)|force]] described quantitatively by [[Newton's third law]]. When a system expels or [[acceleration|accelerates]] [[mass]] in one direction, the accelerated mass will cause a force of equal [[magnitude (vector)|magnitude]] but opposite direction on that system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/airplane/thrust1.html|title=What is Thrust?|website=www.grc.nasa.gov|accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The force applied on a surface in a direction perpendicular or [[normal vector|normal]] to the surface is also called thrust. Force, and thus thrust, is measured using the [[International System of Units]] (SI) in [[newton (unit)|newton]]s (symbol: N), and represents the amount needed to accelerate 1 kilogram of mass at the rate of 1 [[Metre per second squared|meter per second per second]]. In [[mechanical engineering]], force [[orthogonal]] to the main load (such as in parallel [[helical gear]]s) is referred to as thrust.

==Examples==
[[Image:aeroforces.svg|thumb|Forces on an [[aerofoil]] cross section]]

A [[fixed-wing aircraft]] generates forward thrust when air is pushed in the direction opposite to flight. This can be done in several ways including by the spinning blades of a [[Propeller (aircraft)|propeller]], or a rotating [[Mechanical fan|fan]] pushing air out from the back of a [[jet engine]], or by ejecting hot gases from a [[rocket engine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/airplane/newton3.html|title=Newton's Third Law of Motion|website=www.grc.nasa.gov|accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The forward thrust is proportional to the [[mass]] of the airstream multiplied by the difference in [[velocity]] of the airstream. Reverse thrust can be generated to aid braking after landing by reversing the pitch of variable-pitch propeller blades, or using a [[Thrust reversal|thrust reverser]] on a jet engine. [[Rotary wing aircraft]] and [[thrust vectoring]] [[V/STOL]] aircraft use engine thrust to support the weight of the aircraft, and vector sum of this thrust fore and aft to control forward speed.

A [[motorboat]] generates thrust (or reverse thrust) when the propellers are turned to accelerate water backwards (or forwards). The resulting thrust pushes the boat in the opposite direction to the sum of the [[momentum]] change in the water flowing through the propeller.

A [[rocket]] is propelled forward by a thrust force equal in magnitude, but opposite in direction, to the time-rate of momentum change of the [[exhaust gas]] accelerated from the combustion chamber through the rocket engine nozzle. This is the [[exhaust velocity]] with respect to the rocket, times the time-rate at which the mass is expelled, or in mathematical terms:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}=\mathbf{v}\frac{\mathrm{d}m}{\mathrm{d}t}&lt;/math&gt;
Where '''T''' is the thrust generated (force), &lt;math&gt;\frac {\mathrm{d}m} {\mathrm{d}t}&lt;/math&gt; is the rate of change of mass with respect to time (mass flow rate of exhaust), and '''v''' is the speed of the exhaust gases measured relative to the rocket.

For vertical launch of a rocket the initial thrust at [[wikt:liftoff|liftoff]] must be more than the weight.

Each of the three [[Space Shuttle]] [[Space Shuttle Main Engine|Main Engines]] could produce a thrust of 1.8&amp;nbsp;[[meganewton|MN]], and each of the Space Shuttle's two [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|Solid Rocket Boosters]] 14.7&amp;nbsp;MN, together 29.4&amp;nbsp;MN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.braeunig.us/space/specs/shuttle.htm|title=Space Launchers - Space Shuttle|website=www.braeunig.us|accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, the [[simplified Aid For EVA Rescue]] (SAFER) has 24 thrusters of 3.56&amp;nbsp;N each.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

In the air-breathing category, the AMT-USA AT-180 jet engine developed for [[radio-controlled aircraft]] produce 90&amp;nbsp;N (20 [[Pound-force|lbf]]) of thrust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://usamt.com/Mel/comm/comm_products.html
| title = AMT-USA jet engine product information
| accessdate = 2006-12-13
|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061110025303/http://usamt.com/Mel/comm/comm_products.html |archivedate = 2006-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[GE90]]-115B engine fitted on the [[Boeing 777]]-300ER, recognized by the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] as the "World's Most Powerful Commercial Jet Engine," has a thrust of 569&amp;nbsp;kN (127,900&amp;nbsp;lbf).

==Concepts==
===Thrust to power===
The power needed to generate thrust and the force of the thrust can be related in a [[non-linear]] way. In general, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}^2 \propto \mathbf{T}^3&lt;/math&gt;. The proportionality constant varies, and can be solved for a uniform flow:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}m}{\mathrm{d}t} = \rho A {v}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T} = \frac{\mathrm{d}m}{\mathrm{d}t} {v}, \mathbf{P} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{\mathrm{d}m}{\mathrm{d}t} {v}^2&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T} = \rho A {v}^2, \mathbf{P} = \frac{1}{2} \rho A {v}^3&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}^2 = \frac{\mathbf{T}^3}{4 \rho A}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that these calculations are only valid for when the incoming air is accelerated from a standstill – for example when hovering.

The inverse of the proportionality constant, the "efficiency" of an otherwise-perfect thruster, is proportional to the area of the cross section of the propelled volume of fluid (&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;) and the density of the fluid (&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;). This helps to explain why moving through water is easier and why aircraft have much larger propellers than watercraft.

===Thrust to propulsive power===
A very common question is how to contrast the thrust rating of a jet engine with the power rating of a piston engine. Such comparison is difficult, as these quantities are not equivalent. A piston engine does not move the aircraft by itself (the propeller does that), so piston engines are usually rated by how much power they deliver to the propeller. Except for changes in temperature and air pressure, this quantity depends basically on the throttle setting.

A jet engine has no propeller, so the propulsive power of a jet engine is determined from its thrust as follows. Power is the force (F) it takes to move something over some distance (d) divided by the time (t) it takes to move that distance:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/propulsion/q0195.shtml
| title = Convert Thrust to Horsepower By Joe Yoon
| accessdate = 2009-05-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}=\mathbf{F}\frac{d}{t}&lt;/math&gt;

In case of a rocket or a jet aircraft, the force is exactly the thrust (T) produced by the engine. If the rocket or aircraft is moving at about a constant speed, then distance divided by time is just speed, so power is thrust times speed:&lt;ref&gt;"Introduction to Aircraft Flight Mechanics", Yechout &amp; Morris&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}=\mathbf{T}{v}&lt;/math&gt;

This formula looks very surprising, but it is correct: the ''propulsive power'' (or ''power available'' &lt;ref&gt;"Understanding Flight", Anderson &amp; Eberbaht&lt;/ref&gt;) of a jet engine increases with its speed. If the speed is zero, then the propulsive power is zero. If a jet aircraft is at full throttle but attached to a static test stand, then the jet engine produces no propulsive power, however thrust is still produced. Compare that to a [[piston engine]]. The combination piston engine–propeller also has a propulsive power with exactly the same formula, and it will also be zero at zero speed – but that is for the engine–propeller set. The engine alone will continue to produce its rated power at a constant rate, whether the aircraft is moving or not.

Now, imagine the strong chain is broken, and the jet and the piston aircraft start to move. At low speeds:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The piston engine will have constant 100% power, and the propeller's thrust will vary with speed&lt;br /&gt;
The jet engine will have constant 100% thrust, and the engine's power will vary with speed
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Excess thrust===
If a powered aircraft is generating thrust T and experiencing [[Aerodynamic drag|drag]] D, the difference between the two, T&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;D, is termed the excess thrust. The instantaneous performance of the aircraft is mostly dependent on the excess thrust.

Excess thrust is a [[Euclidean vector|vector]] and is determined as the vector difference between the thrust vector and the drag vector.

===Centre of thrust===

The centre of thrust for an object is an average point at which the total thrust may be considered to apply. It may differ from the [[centre of gravity]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22682">'''Uncertainty quantification (UQ)''' is the science of quantitative characterization and reduction of [[Uncertainty|uncertainties]] in both computational and real world applications. It tries to determine how likely certain outcomes are if some aspects of the system are not exactly known. An example would be to predict the acceleration of a human body in a head-on crash with another car: even if we exactly knew the speed, small differences in the manufacturing of individual cars, how tightly every bolt has been tightened, etc., will lead to different results that can only be predicted in a statistical sense.

Many problems in the natural sciences and engineering are also rife with sources of uncertainty. [[Computer experiment]]s on [[computer model|computer simulation]]s are the most common approach to study problems in uncertainty quantification.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Sacks, William J. Welch, Toby J. Mitchell and Henry P. Wynn, ''Design and Analysis of Computer Experiments'', Statistical Science, Vol. 4, No. 4 (Nov., 1989), pp. 409-423&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ronald L. Iman, Jon C. Helton, ''An Investigation of Uncertainty and Sensitivity Analysis Techniques for Computer Models'', Risk Analysis, Volume 8, Issue 1, pages 71–90, March 1988, DOI: 10.1111/j.1539-6924.1988.tb01155.x&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W.E. Walker, P. Harremoës, J. Rotmans, J.P. van der Sluijs, M.B.A. van Asselt, P. Janssen and M.P. Krayer von Krauss, ''Defining Uncertainty: A Conceptual Basis for Uncertainty Management in Model-Based Decision Support'', Integrated Assessment, Volume 4, Issue 1, 2003, DOI: 10.1076/iaij.4.1.5.16466&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources of uncertainty==
Uncertainty can enter [[mathematical model]]s and experimental measurements in various contexts. One way to categorize the sources of uncertainty is to consider:&lt;ref name="KennedyOHagan"&gt;Marc C. Kennedy, Anthony O'Hagan, ''Bayesian calibration of computer models'', Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B Volume 63, Issue 3, pages 425–464, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

; Parameter uncertainty: This comes from the model parameters that are inputs to the computer model (mathematical model) but whose exact values are unknown to experimentalists and cannot be controlled in physical experiments, or whose values cannot be exactly inferred by [[statistical methods]]. Some examples of this are the local [[free fall|free-fall]] acceleration in a falling object experiment, various material properties in a finite element analysis for engineering, and [[multiplier uncertainty]] in the context of [[macroeconomic policy]] optimization.
; Parametric variability: This comes from the variability of input variables of the model. For example, the dimensions of a work piece in a process of manufacture may not be exactly as designed and instructed, which would cause variability in its performance.
; Structural uncertainty: Also known as model inadequacy, model bias, or model discrepancy, this comes from the lack of knowledge of the underlying physics in the problem. It depends on how accurately a mathematical model describes the true system for a real-life situation, considering the fact that models are almost always only approximations to reality. One example is when modeling the process of a falling object using the free-fall model; the model itself is inaccurate since there always exists air friction. In this case, even if there is no unknown parameter in the model, a discrepancy is still expected between the model and true physics.
; Algorithmic uncertainty: Also known as numerical uncertainty, or discrete uncertainty. This type comes from numerical errors and numerical approximations per implementation of the computer model. Most models are too complicated to solve exactly. For example, the [[finite element method]] or [[finite difference|finite difference method]] may be used to approximate the solution of a [[partial differential equation]] (which introduces numerical errors). Other examples are numerical integration and infinite sum truncation that are necessary approximations in numerical implementation.
; Experimental uncertainty: Also known as observation error, this comes from the variability of experimental measurements. The experimental uncertainty is inevitable and can be noticed by repeating a measurement for many times using exactly the same settings for all inputs/variables.
; Interpolation uncertainty: This comes from a lack of available data collected from computer model simulations and/or experimental measurements. For other input settings that don't have simulation data or experimental measurements, one must interpolate or extrapolate in order to predict the corresponding responses.

===Aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty===
Uncertainty is sometimes classified into two categories,&lt;ref&gt;Armen Der Kiureghiana, Ove Ditlevsen, ''Aleatory or epistemic? Does it matter?'', Structural Safety, Volume 31, Issue 2, March 2009, Pages 105–112&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hermann G. Matthies, ''Quantifying uncertainty: modern computational representation of probability and applications'', Extreme Man-Made and Natural Hazards in Dynamics of Structures, NATO Security through Science Series, 2007, 105-135, DOI: 10.1007/978-1-4020-5656-7_4&lt;/ref&gt; although the validity of this categorization is open to debate.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} These categories are prominently seen in medical applications.&lt;ref&gt;Abhaya Indrayan, "Medical Biostatistics, Second Edition", Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC Press, 2008, pages 8, 673&lt;/ref&gt;

; Aleatoric uncertainty: Aleatoric uncertainty is also known as statistical uncertainty, and is representative of unknowns that differ each time we run the same experiment. For example, a single arrow shot with a mechanical bow that exactly duplicates each launch (the same acceleration, altitude, direction and final velocity) will not all impact the same point on the target due to random and complicated vibrations of the arrow shaft, the knowledge of which cannot be determined sufficiently to eliminate the resulting scatter of impact points.  The argument here is obviously in the definition of "cannot".  Just because we cannot measure sufficiently with our currently available measurement devices does not preclude necessarily the existence of such information, which would move this uncertainty into the below category.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}
; Epistemic uncertainty: Epistemic uncertainty is also known as systematic uncertainty, and is due to things one could in principle know but doesn't in practice. This may be because a measurement is not accurate, because the model neglects certain effects, or because particular data has been deliberately hidden. An example of a source of this uncertainty would be the [[Drag (physics)|drag]] in an experiment designed to measure the acceleration of gravity near the earth's surface. The commonly used gravitational acceleration of 9.8&amp;nbsp;m/s^2 ignores the effects of air resistance, but the air resistance for the object could be measured and incorporated into the experiment to reduce the resulting uncertainty in the calculation of the gravitational acceleration.

In real life applications, both kinds of uncertainties are present. Uncertainty quantification intends to work toward reducing epistemic uncertainties to aleatoric uncertainties. The quantification for the aleatoric uncertainties can be relatively straightforward to perform, depending on the application. Techniques such as the [[Monte Carlo method]] are frequently used. A probability distribution can be represented by its [[Moment (mathematics)|moments]] (in the [[Normal distribution|Gaussian]] case, the [[mean]] and [[covariance]] suffice, although it should be noted that, in general, even knowledge of all moments to arbitrarily high order still does not specify the distribution function uniquely), or more recently, by techniques such as [[Karhunen–Loève theorem|Karhunen–Loève]] and [[polynomial chaos]] expansions. To evaluate epistemic uncertainties, the efforts are made to gain better knowledge of the system, process or mechanism. Methods such as [[probability bounds analysis]], [[fuzzy logic]] or evidence theory ([[Dempster–Shafer theory]] – a generalization of the Bayesian theory of subjective probability) are used.

==Two types of uncertainty quantification problems==
There are two major types of problems in uncertainty quantification: one is the '''forward''' propagation of uncertainty (where the various sources of uncertainty are propagated through the model to predict the overall uncertainty in the system response) and the other is the '''inverse''' assessment of model uncertainty and parameter uncertainty (where the model parameters are calibrated simultaneously using test data). There has been a proliferation of research on the former problem and a majority of uncertainty analysis techniques were developed for it. On the other hand, the latter problem is drawing increasing attention in the engineering design community, since uncertainty quantification of a model and the subsequent predictions of the true system response(s) are of great interest in designing robust systems.

===Forward uncertainty propagation===
{{See also|Propagation of uncertainty}}
Uncertainty propagation is the quantification of uncertainties in system output(s) propagated from uncertain inputs. It focuses on the influence on the outputs from the ''parametric variability'' listed in the sources of uncertainty. The targets of uncertainty propagation analysis can be:
* To evaluate low-order moments of the outputs, i.e. [[mean]] and [[variance]].
* To evaluate the reliability of the outputs. This is especially useful in [[reliability engineering]] where outputs of a system are usually closely related to the performance of the system.
* To assess the complete probability distribution of the outputs. This is useful in the scenario of [[utility]] optimization where the complete distribution is used to calculate the utility.

===Inverse uncertainty quantification===
{{see also|Inverse problem}}
Given some experimental measurements of a system and some computer simulation results from its mathematical model, inverse uncertainty quantification estimates the discrepancy between the experiment and the mathematical model (which is called '''bias correction'''), and estimates the values of unknown parameters in the model if there are any (which is called '''parameter calibration''' or simply '''calibration'''). Generally this is a much more difficult problem than forward uncertainty propagation; however it is of great importance since it is typically implemented in a model updating process. There are several scenarios in inverse uncertainty quantification:
[[File:Bias Correction.png|thumb|right|300px|The outcome of bias correction, including an updated model (prediction mean) and prediction confidence interval.]]

====Bias correction only====
Bias correction quantifies the ''model inadequacy'', i.e. the discrepancy between the experiment and the mathematical model. The general model updating formula for bias correction is:
:&lt;math&gt; y^e(\mathbf{x})=y^m(\mathbf{x})+\delta(\mathbf{x})+\varepsilon &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; y^e(\mathbf{x}) &lt;/math&gt; denotes the experimental measurements as a function of several input variables &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x} &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; y^m(\mathbf{x}) &lt;/math&gt; denotes the computer model (mathematical model) response, &lt;math&gt; \delta(\mathbf{x}) &lt;/math&gt; denotes the additive discrepancy function (aka bias function), and &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon &lt;/math&gt; denotes the experimental uncertainty. The objective is to estimate the discrepancy function &lt;math&gt; \delta(\mathbf{x}) &lt;/math&gt;, and as a by-product, the resulting updated model is &lt;math&gt; y^m(\mathbf{x})+\delta(\mathbf{x}) &lt;/math&gt;. A prediction confidence interval is provided with the updated model as the quantification of the uncertainty.

====Parameter calibration only====
Parameter calibration estimates the values of one or more unknown parameters in a mathematical model. The general model updating formulation for calibration is:
:&lt;math&gt; y^e(\mathbf{x})=y^m(\mathbf{x},\boldsymbol{\theta}^*)+\varepsilon &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; y^m(\mathbf{x},\boldsymbol{\theta}) &lt;/math&gt; denotes the computer model response that depends on several unknown model parameters &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\theta} &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\theta}^* &lt;/math&gt; denotes the true values of the unknown parameters in the course of experiments. The objective is to either estimate &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\theta}^* &lt;/math&gt;, or to come up with a probability distribution of &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\theta}^* &lt;/math&gt; that encompasses the best knowledge of the true parameter values.

====Bias correction and parameter calibration====
It considers an inaccurate model with one or more unknown parameters, and its model updating formulation combines the two together:
:&lt;math&gt; y^e(\mathbf{x})=y^m(\mathbf{x},\boldsymbol{\theta}^*)+\delta(\mathbf{x})+\varepsilon &lt;/math&gt;
It is the most comprehensive model updating formulation that includes all possible sources of uncertainty, and it requires the most effort to solve.

==Selective methodologies for uncertainty quantification==
Much research has been done to solve uncertainty quantification problems, though a majority of them deal with uncertainty propagation. During the past one to two decades, a number of approaches for inverse uncertainty quantification problems have also been developed and have proved to be useful for most small- to medium-scale problems.

===Methodologies for forward uncertainty propagation===
Existing uncertainty propagation approaches include probabilistic approaches and non-probabilistic approaches. There are basically five categories of probabilistic approaches for uncertainty propagation:&lt;ref&gt;S. H. Lee and W. Chen, ''A comparative study of uncertainty propagation methods for black-box-type problems'', Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization
Volume 37, Number 3 (2009), 239-253, DOI: 10.1007/s00158-008-0234-7&lt;/ref&gt;
* Simulation-based methods: [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo simulations]], [[importance sampling]], adaptive sampling, etc.
* Local expansion-based methods: Taylor series, [[Perturbation theory|perturbation method]], etc. These methods have advantages when dealing with relatively small input variability and outputs that don't express high nonlinearity. These linear or linearized methods are detailed in the article [[Uncertainty propagation]].
* Functional expansion-based methods: Neumann expansion, orthogonal or Karhunen-Loeve expansions (KLE), with [[Polynomial chaos|polynomial chaos expansion (PCE)]] and wavelet expansions as special cases.
* Most probable point (MPP)-based methods: first-order reliability method (FORM) and second-order reliability method (SORM).
* Numerical integration-based methods: Full factorial numerical integration (FFNI) and dimension reduction (DR).
For non-probabilistic approaches, [[Interval arithmetic|interval analysis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jaulin|first1=L.|last2=Kieffer|first2=M.|last3=Didrit|first3=O.|last4=Walter|first4=E.|title=Applied Interval Analysis|year=2001|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=1-85233-219-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fuzzy logic|Fuzzy theory]], possibility theory and evidence theory are among the most widely used.

The probabilistic approach is considered as the most rigorous approach to uncertainty analysis in engineering design due to its consistency with the theory of decision analysis. Its cornerstone is the calculation of probability density functions for sampling statistics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://publications.npl.co.uk/npl_web/pdf/tqe2.pdf Arnaut, L. R. Measurement uncertainty in reverberation chambers - I. Sample statistics. Technical report TQE 2, 2nd. ed., sec. 3.1, National Physical Laboratory, 2008.]
&lt;/ref&gt; This can be performed rigorously for random variables that are obtainable as transformations of Gaussian variables, leading to exact confidence intervals.

===Methodologies for inverse uncertainty quantification===

====Frequentist====
In [[regression analysis]] and [[least squares]] problems, the [[standard error]] of [[parameter estimate]]s is readily available, which can be expanded into a [[confidence interval]].

====Bayesian====
Several methodologies for inverse uncertainty quantification exist under the [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian framework]]. The most complicated direction is to aim at solving problems with both bias correction and parameter calibration. The challenges of such problems include not only the influences from model inadequacy and parameter uncertainty, but also the lack of data from both computer simulations and experiments. A common situation is that the input settings are not the same over experiments and simulations.

=====Modular Bayesian approach=====
An approach to inverse uncertainty quantification is the modular Bayesian approach.&lt;ref name="KennedyOHagan" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marc C. Kennedy, Anthony O'Hagan, ''Supplementary Details on Bayesian Calibration of Computer Models'', Sheffield, University of Sheffield: 1-13, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The modular Bayesian approach derives its name from its four-module procedure. Apart from the current available data, a [[prior distribution]] of unknown parameters should be assigned.

;'''Module 1:''' Gaussian process modeling for the computer model

To address the issue from lack of simulation results, the computer model is replaced with a [[Gaussian process|Gaussian Process (GP)]] model
:&lt;math&gt; y^m(\mathbf{x},\boldsymbol{\theta})\sim\mathcal{GP}\big(\mathbf{h}^m(\cdot)^T\boldsymbol{\beta}^m,\sigma_m^2R^m(\cdot,\cdot)\big) &lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt; R^m\big((\mathbf{x},\boldsymbol{\theta}),(\mathbf{x}',\boldsymbol{\theta}')\big)=\exp\left\{-\sum_{k=1}^d \omega_k^m(x_k-x_k')^2\right\}\exp\left\{-\sum_{k=1}^r \omega_{d+k}^m(\theta_k-\theta_k')^2 \right\}. &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt; d &lt;/math&gt; is the dimension of input variables, and &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt; is the dimension of unknown parameters.While &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{h}^m(\cdot) &lt;/math&gt; is pre-defined, &lt;math&gt; \left\{\boldsymbol{\beta}^m, \sigma_m, \omega_k^m, k=1,\ldots,d+r\right\} &lt;/math&gt;, known as ''[[hyperparameter]]s'' of the GP model, need to be estimated via [[Maximum likelihood|maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)]]. This module can be considered as a generalized [[Kriging]] method.

;'''Module 2:''' Gaussian process modeling for the discrepancy function
Similarly with the first module, the discrepancy function is replaced with a GP model
:&lt;math&gt; \delta(\mathbf{x})\sim\mathcal{GP}\big(\mathbf{h}^\delta(\cdot)^T\boldsymbol{\beta}^\delta,\sigma_\delta^2R^\delta(\cdot,\cdot)\big) &lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt; R^\delta(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}')=\exp\left\{-\sum_{k=1}^d \omega_k^\delta(x_k-x_k')^2 \right\}. &lt;/math&gt;
Together with the prior distribution of unknown parameters, and data from both computer models and experiments, one can derive the maximum likelihood estimates for &lt;math&gt; \left\{\boldsymbol{\beta}^\delta, \sigma_\delta, \omega_k^\delta, k=1,\ldots,d\right\} &lt;/math&gt;. At the same time, &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\beta}^m &lt;/math&gt; from Module 1 gets updated as well.

;'''Module 3:''' Posterior distribution of unknown parameters
[[Bayes' theorem]] is applied to calculate the [[posterior distribution]] of the unknown parameters:
:&lt;math&gt; p(\boldsymbol{\theta}|\rm{data},\boldsymbol{\phi})\propto p(\rm{data}|\boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{\phi})p(\boldsymbol{\theta}) &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\phi} &lt;/math&gt; includes all the fixed hyperparameters in previous modules.

;'''Module 4:''' Prediction of the experimental response and discrepancy function

=====Fully Bayesian approach=====
Fully Bayesian approach requires that not only the priors for unknown parameters &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\theta} &lt;/math&gt; but also the priors for the other hyperparameters &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\phi} &lt;/math&gt; should be assigned. It follows the following steps:&lt;ref name="Liu"&gt;F. Liu, [[M. J. Bayarri]] and J.O.Berger, ''Modularization in Bayesian Analysis, with Emphasis on Analysis of Computer Models'', Bayesian Analysis (2009) 4, Number 1, pp. 119-150, DOI:10.1214/09-BA404&lt;/ref&gt;

# Derive the posterior distribution &lt;math&gt; p(\boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{\phi}|\rm{data}) &lt;/math&gt;;
# Integrate &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\phi} &lt;/math&gt; out and obtain &lt;math&gt; p(\boldsymbol{\theta}|\rm{data}) &lt;/math&gt;. This single step accomplishes the calibration;
# Prediction of the experimental response and discrepancy function.

However, the approach has significant drawbacks:
* For most cases, &lt;math&gt; p(\boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{\phi}|\rm{data}) &lt;/math&gt; is a highly intractable function of &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\phi} &lt;/math&gt;. Hence the integration becomes very troublesome. Moreover, if priors for the other hyperparameters &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\phi} &lt;/math&gt; are not carefully chosen, the complexity in numerical integration increases even more.
* In the prediction stage, the prediction (which should at least include the expected value of system responses) also requires numerical integration. [[Markov chain Monte Carlo|Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)]] is often used for integration; however it is computationally expensive.

The fully Bayesian approach requires a huge amount of calculations and may not yet be practical for dealing with the most complicated modelling situations.&lt;ref name="Liu" /&gt;

==Known issues==
The theories and methodologies for uncertainty propagation are much better established, compared with inverse uncertainty quantification. For the latter, several difficulties remain unsolved:
# Dimensionality issue: The computational cost increases dramatically with the dimensionality of the problem, i.e. the number of input variables and/or the number of unknown parameters.
# Identifiability issue:&lt;ref&gt;Arendt, P., W. Chen, and D. Apley, ''Improving Identifiability in Model Calibration Using Multiple Responses'', DETC2011-48623, ASME International Design Engineering Technical Conferences, August 28–31, Washington, D.C., 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple combinations of unknown parameters and discrepancy function can yield the same experimental prediction. Hence different values of parameters cannot be distinguished/identified.
