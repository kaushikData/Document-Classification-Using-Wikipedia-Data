Chekhov renounced the theatre after the reception of ''[[The Seagull]]'' in 1896, but the play was revived to acclaim in 1898 by [[Konstantin Stanislavski]]'s [[Moscow Art Theatre]], which subsequently also produced Chekhov's ''[[Uncle Vanya]]'' and premiered his last two plays, ''[[Three Sisters (play)|Three Sisters]]'' and ''[[The Cherry Orchard]]''. These four works present a challenge to the acting ensemble&lt;ref&gt;"Actors climb up Chekhov like a mountain, roped together, sharing the glory if they ever make it to the summit". Actor [[Ian McKellen]], quoted in Miles, 9.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to audiences, because in place of conventional action Chekhov offers a "theatre of mood" and a "submerged life in the text".&lt;ref&gt;"Chekhov's art demands a theatre of mood."

Anton Chekhov was born on the feast day of St. [[Anthony the Great]] (17 January [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]]) 29 January 1860 in [[Taganrog, Russia|Taganrog]], a port on the [[Sea of Azov]] in southern [[Russian Empire|Russia]]. He was the third of six surviving children. His father, Pavel Yegorovich Chekhov, the son of a former [[serfdom|serf]] and his Ukrainian wife,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rayfield|1997|pp=3–4}}: Egor Mikhailovich Chekhov and Efrosinia Emelianovna&lt;/ref&gt; was from the village {{ill|Olhovatka|ru|Ольховатка (Ольховатский район)}}([[Voronezh Governorate]])  and ran a grocery store. A director of the parish choir, devout [[Orthodox Christian]], and physically abusive father, Pavel Chekhov has been seen by some historians as the model for his son's many portraits of hypocrisy.&lt;ref name = "Wood 78"&gt;{{harvnb|Wood|2000|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chekhov's mother, Yevgeniya (Morozova), was an excellent storyteller who entertained the children with tales of her travels with her cloth-merchant father all over Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, XVII.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Simmons|1970|p=18}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taganrogcity.com/chekhov_taganrog.html Chekhov and Taganrog], Taganrog city website.&lt;/ref&gt; "Our talents we got from our father," Chekhov remembered, "but our soul from our mother."&lt;ref name = "Bio"&gt;From the biographical sketch, adapted from a memoir by Chekhov's brother Mihail, which prefaces [[Constance Garnett]]'s translation of Chekhov's letters, 1920.&lt;/ref&gt;
In adulthood, Chekhov criticised his brother [[Alexander Chekhov|Alexander's]] treatment of his wife and children by reminding him of Pavel's tyranny: "Let me ask you to recall that it was [[despotism]] and lying that ruined your mother's youth. Despotism and lying so mutilated our childhood that it's sickening and frightening to think about it. Remember the horror and disgust we felt in those times when Father threw a tantrum at dinner over too much salt in the soup and called Mother a fool."&lt;ref&gt;Letter to brother Alexander, 2 January 1889, in {{harvnb|Malcolm|2004|p=102}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Suvoring 1894"&gt;Another insight into Chekhov's childhood came in a letter to his publisher and friend Alexei Suvorin: "From my childhood I have believed in progress, and I could not help believing in it since the difference between the time when I used to be thrashed and when they gave up thrashing me was tremendous." Letter to Suvorin, 27 March 1894. [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6408 ''Letters of Anton Chekhov''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chekhov attended the [[Greek Church and Greek School in Taganrog|Greek School in Taganrog]] and the Taganrog ''[[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]'' (since renamed the [[Chekhov Gymnasium]]), where he was kept down for a year at fifteen for failing an examination in Ancient Greek.&lt;ref name = "Bartlett 4-5"&gt;Bartlett, 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; He sang at the [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] monastery in Taganrog and in his father's choirs. In a letter of 1892, he used the word "suffering" to describe his childhood and recalled:

{{quote|text=When my brothers and I used to stand in the middle of the church and sing the trio "May my prayer be exalted", or "The Archangel's Voice", everyone looked at us with emotion and envied our parents, but we at that moment felt like little convicts.&lt;ref name="multiref1"&gt;Letter to I.L. Shcheglov, 9 March 1892. [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6408 ''Letters of Anton Chekhov''.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1876, Chekhov's father was declared bankrupt after overextending his finances building a new house, having been cheated by a contractor named Mironov.{{sfn|Rayfield|1997|p=31}} To avoid [[debtor's prison]] he fled to Moscow, where his two eldest sons, [[Alexander Chekhov|Alexander]] and [[Nikolai Chekhov|Nikolay]], were attending university. The family lived in poverty in Moscow; Chekhov's mother was physically and emotionally broken by the experience.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to cousin Mihail, 10 May 1877. [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6408 ''Letters of Anton Chekhov''.]&lt;/ref&gt; Chekhov was left behind to sell the family's possessions and finish his education.

Chekhov remained in Taganrog for three more years, boarding with a man by the name of Selivanov who, like Lopakhin in ''The Cherry Orchard'', had bailed out the family for the price of their house.{{sfn|Malcolm|2004|p=25}} Chekhov had to pay for his own education, which he managed by private tutoring, catching and selling [[European Goldfinch|goldfinches]], and selling short sketches to the newspapers, among other jobs.&lt;ref name="Payne XX"&gt;Payne, XX.&lt;/ref&gt; He sent every [[ruble]] he could spare to his family in Moscow, along with humorous letters to cheer them up.&lt;ref name="Payne XX" /&gt; During this time, he read widely and analytically, including the works of [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]], [[Ivan Turgenev|Turgenev]], [[Ivan Goncharov|Goncharov]], and [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]],&lt;ref name = "Mihail 1876"&gt;Letter to brother Mihail, 1 July 1876. [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6408 ''Letters of Anton Chekhov''.]&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Simmons|1970|p=26}} and wrote a full-length comic drama, ''Fatherless'', which his brother Alexander dismissed as "an inexcusable though innocent fabrication."{{sfn|Simmons|1970|p=33}} Chekhov also enjoyed a series of love affairs, one with the wife of a teacher.&lt;ref name="Payne XX" /&gt;

In 1879, Chekhov completed his schooling and joined his family in Moscow, having gained admission to the medical school at [[I.M. Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University]].{{sfn|Rayfield|1997|p=69}}

===Early writings===
Chekhov now assumed responsibility for the whole family.{{sfn|Wood|2000|p=79}} To support them and to pay his tuition fees, he wrote daily short, humorous sketches and vignettes of contemporary Russian life, many under pseudonyms such as "Antosha Chekhonte" (Антоша Чехонте) and "Man without a Spleen" (Человек без селезенки). His prodigious output gradually earned him a reputation as a [[satire|satirical]] chronicler of Russian street life, and by 1882 he was writing for ''Oskolki'' (''[[Fragments (magazine)|Fragments]]''), owned by [[Nikolai Leykin]], one of the leading publishers of the time.{{sfn|Rayfield|1997|p=91}} Chekhov's tone at this stage was harsher than that familiar from his mature fiction.&lt;ref name="Obs"&gt;"There is in these miniatures an arresting potion of cruelty&amp;nbsp;... The wonderfully compassionate Chekhov was yet to mature." [http://books.guardian.co.uk/critics/reviews/0,,489891,00.html "Vodka Miniatures, Belching and Angry Cats"], [[George Steiner]]'s review of ''The Undiscovered Chekhov'' in ''The Observer'', 13 May 2001.

In 1884, Chekhov qualified as a physician, which he considered his principal profession though he made little money from it and treated the poor free of charge.{{sfn|Malcolm|2004|p=26}}

In 1884 and 1885, Chekhov found himself coughing blood, and in 1886 the attacks worsened, but he would not admit his [[tuberculosis]] to his family or his friends.&lt;ref name = "Bio"/&gt; He confessed to Leykin, "I am afraid to submit myself to be sounded by my colleagues."&lt;ref&gt;Letter to N.A.Leykin, 6 April 1886. [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6408 ''Letters of Anton Chekhov''.]&lt;/ref&gt; He continued writing for weekly periodicals, earning enough money to move the family into progressively better accommodations.

Early in 1886 he was invited to write for one of the most popular papers in [[St. Petersburg]], ''[[Novoye Vremya (newspaper)|Novoye Vremya]]'' (''New Times''), owned and edited by the millionaire magnate [[Alexey Suvorin]], who paid a rate per line double Leykin's and allowed Chekhov three times the space.{{sfn|Rayfield|1997|p=128}} Suvorin was to become a lifelong friend, perhaps Chekhov's closest.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rayfield|1997|pp=448–50|ps=They only ever fell out once, when Chekhov objected to the [[antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] attacks in ''New Times'' against [[Alfred Dreyfus|Dreyfus]] and [[Émile Zola|Zola]] in 1898.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Wood 79"&gt;In many ways, the right-wing Suvorin, whom [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] later called "The running dog of the [[Tsar|Tzar]]" (Payne, XXXV), was Chekhov's opposite; "Chekhov had to function like Suvorin's kidney, extracting the businessman's poisons."{{harvnb|Wood|2000|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before long, Chekhov was attracting literary as well as popular attention. The sixty-four-year-old [[Dmitry Grigorovich]], a celebrated Russian writer of the day, wrote to Chekhov after reading his short story "The Huntsman" that&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/1944 ''The Huntsman''.]. Retrieved 16 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; "You have ''real'' talent, a talent that places you in the front rank among writers in the new generation." He went on to advise Chekhov to slow down, write less, and concentrate on literary quality.

Chekhov replied that the letter had struck him "like a thunderbolt" and confessed, "I have written my stories the way reporters write up their notes about fires – mechanically, half-consciously, caring nothing about either the reader or myself."{{sfn|Malcolm|2004|pp=32–3}}" The admission may have done Chekhov a disservice, since early manuscripts reveal that he often wrote with extreme care, continually revising.&lt;ref name="Payne XXIV"&gt;Payne, XXIV.&lt;/ref&gt; Grigorovich's advice nevertheless inspired a more serious, artistic ambition in the twenty-six-year-old. In 1888, with a little string-pulling by Grigorovich, the short story collection ''At Dusk'' (''V Sumerkakh'') won Chekhov the coveted [[Pushkin Prize]] "for the best literary production distinguished by high artistic worth."{{sfn|Simmons|1970|p=160}}

===Turning points===
In 1887, exhausted from overwork and ill health, Chekhov took a trip to [[Ukraine]], which reawakened him to the beauty of the [[Pontic-Caspian steppe|steppe]].&lt;ref name = "Masha 1887"&gt;"There is a scent of the steppe and one hears the birds sing. I see my old friends the ravens flying over the steppe." Letter to sister Masha, 2 April 1887. [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6408 ''Letters of Anton Chekhov''.]&lt;/ref&gt; On his return, he began the novella-length short story "[[s:The Steppe|The Steppe]]," which he called "something rather odd and much too original," and which was eventually published in ''[[Severny Vestnik]]'' (''The Northern Herald'').&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Grigorovich, 12 January 1888. Quoted by {{harvnb|Malcolm|2004|p=137}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In a narrative that drifts with the thought processes of the characters, Chekhov evokes a [[chaise]] journey across the steppe through the eyes of a young boy sent to live away from home, and his companions, a priest and a merchant. "The Steppe" has been called a "dictionary of Chekhov's poetics", and it represented a significant advance for Chekhov, exhibiting much of the quality of his mature fiction and winning him publication in a literary journal rather than a newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;"'The Steppe,' as Michael Finke suggests, is 'a sort of dictionary of Chekhov's poetics,' a kind of sample case of the concealed literary weapons Chekhov would deploy in his work to come." {{harvnb|Malcolm|2004|p=147}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In autumn 1887, a theatre manager named Korsh commissioned Chekhov to write a play, the result being ''[[Ivanov (play)|Ivanov]]'', written in a fortnight and produced that November.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;From the biographical sketch, adapted from a memoir by Chekhov's brother Mikhail, which prefaces [[Constance Garnett]]'s translation of Chekhov's letters, 1920.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Chekhov found the experience "sickening" and painted a comic portrait of the chaotic production in a letter to his brother Alexander, the play was a hit and was praised, to Chekhov's bemusement, as a work of originality.&lt;ref name = "Alexander 1887"&gt;Letter to brother Alexander, 20 November 1887. [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6408 ''Letters of Anton Chekhov''.]&lt;/ref&gt; Although Chekhov did not fully realise it at the time, Chekhov's plays, such as ''The Seagull'' (written in 1895), ''Uncle Vanya'' (written in 1897), ''The Three Sisters'' (written in 1900), and ''The Cherry Orchard'' (written in 1903) served as a revolutionary backbone to what is common sense to the medium of acting to this day: an effort to recreate and express the "realism" of how people truly act and speak with each other and translating it to the stage to manifest the human condition as accurately as possible in hopes to make the audience reflect upon their own definition of what it means to be human.

This philosophy of approaching the art of acting has stood not only steadfast, but as the cornerstone of acting for much of the 20th century to this day. [[Mikhail Chekhov (writer)|Mikhail Chekhov]] considered ''Ivanov'' a key moment in his brother's intellectual development and literary career.&lt;ref name = "Bio"/&gt; From this period comes an observation of Chekhov's that has become known as '''[[Chekhov's gun]]''', a dramatic principle that requires that every element in a narrative be necessary and irreplaceable, and that everything else be removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Chekhov's Art: A Stylistic Analysis|author=Petr Mikhaĭlovich Bit︠s︡illi|year=1983|publisher=Ardis|page=x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Literature 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential Novelists, Playwrights, and Poets of All Time|author=Daniel S.

The death of Chekhov's brother Nikolay from tuberculosis in 1889 influenced ''A Dreary Story'', finished that September, about a man who confronts the end of a life that he realises has been without purpose.&lt;ref name = "Dreary"&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/1883 "A Dreary Story."].

===Sakhalin===
In 1890, Chekhov undertook an arduous journey by train, horse-drawn carriage, and river steamer to the Russian Far East and the ''[[katorga]]'', or penal colony, on [[Sakhalin|Sakhalin Island]], north of Japan, where he spent three months interviewing thousands of convicts and settlers for a census. The letters Chekhov wrote during the two-and-a-half-month journey to Sakhalin are considered to be among his best.{{sfn|Malcolm|2004|p=129}} His remarks to his sister about [[Tomsk]] were to become notorious.{{sfn|Simmons|1970|p=223}}{{sfn|Rayfield|1997|p=224}}
[[File:Anton Chekhov museum Alexandrovsk-Sakhalinsky file 3.jpg|thumb|Anton Chekhov museum in [[Alexandrovsk-Sakhalinsky (town)|Alexandrovsk-Sakhalinsky]], Russia. It is the house where he stayed in Sakhalin during 1890]]

The inhabitants of Tomsk later retaliated by erecting a mocking statue of Chekhov.
[[File:Anton Chekhov monument Alexandrovsk-Sakhalinsky file 1.jpg|thumb|''Anton Chekhov Monument'' in [[Alexandrovsk-Sakhalinsky (town)|Alexandrovsk-Sakhalinsky]], Russia]]
Chekhov witnessed much on Sakhalin that shocked and angered him, including floggings, embezzlement of supplies, and [[sexual slavery|forced prostitution]] of women. He wrote,  "There were times I felt that I saw before me the extreme limits of man's degradation."{{sfn|Wood|2000|p=85}}{{sfn|Rayfield|1997|p=230}} He was particularly moved by the plight of the children living in the penal colony with their parents. For example:

{{quote|On the [[Amur River|Amur]] steamer going to Sakhalin, there was a convict who had murdered his wife and wore fetters on his legs. His daughter, a little girl of six, was with him. I noticed wherever the convict moved the little girl scrambled after him, holding on to his fetters. At night the child slept with the convicts and soldiers all in a heap together.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to A.F.Koni, 16 January 1891. [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6408 ''Letters of Anton Chekhov''.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Chekhov later concluded that charity was not the answer, but that the government had a duty to finance humane treatment of the convicts. His findings were published in 1893 and 1894 as ''Ostrov Sakhalin'' (''[[Sakhalin Island (Chekhov)|The Island of Sakhalin]]''), a work of social science, not literature.{{sfn|Malcolm|2004|p=125}}&lt;ref name = "Simmons 229"&gt;{{harvnb|Simmons|1970|p=229}}: Such is the general critical view of the work, but Simmons calls it a "valuable and intensely human document."&lt;/ref&gt; Chekhov found literary expression for the "Hell of Sakhalin" in his long short story "[[s:The Murder|The Murder]],"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/13419 "The Murder"]. Retrieved 16 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; the last section of which is set on Sakhalin, where the murderer Yakov loads coal in the night while longing for home. Chekhov's writing on Sakhalin is the subject of brief comment and analysis in [[Haruki Murakami]]'s novel ''[[1Q84]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Murakami, Haruki. ''1Q84''.  Alfred A. Knopf: New York, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the subject of a poem by the Nobel Prize winner [[Seamus Heaney]], "Chekhov on Sakhalin" (collected in the volume ''Station Island'').&lt;ref&gt;Heaney, Seamus. ''Station Island'' Farrar Straus Giroux: New York, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Melikhovo===
In 1892, Chekhov bought the small country estate of [[Melikhovo]], about forty miles south of Moscow, where he lived with his family until 1899. "It's nice to be a lord," he joked to his friend Ivan Leontyev (who wrote humorous pieces under the pseudonym Shcheglov),&lt;ref name="multiref1"/&gt; but he took his responsibilities as a landlord seriously and soon made himself useful to the local peasants. As well as organising relief for victims of the [[famine]] and [[cholera]] outbreaks of 1892, he went on to build three schools, a fire station, and a clinic, and to donate his medical services to peasants for miles around, despite frequent recurrences of his tuberculosis.&lt;ref name = "Wood 78"/&gt;{{sfn|Malcolm|2004|p=26}}&lt;ref name = "Payne XXXI"&gt;Payne, XXXI.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mikhail Chekhov, a member of the household at Melikhovo, described the extent of his brother's medical commitments:

{{quote|From the first day that Chekhov moved to Melikhovo, the sick began flocking to him from twenty miles around. They came on foot or were brought in carts, and often he was fetched to patients at a distance. Sometimes from early in the morning peasant women and children were standing before his door waiting.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;From the biographical sketch, adapted from a memoir by Chekhov's brother Mikhail, which prefaces Constance Garnett's translation of Chekhov's letters, 1920.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Chekhov's expenditure on drugs was considerable, but the greatest cost was making journeys of several hours to visit the sick, which reduced his time for writing.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;From the biographical sketch, adapted from a memoir by Chekhov's brother Mihail, which prefaces Constance Garnett's translation of Chekhov's letters, 1920.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Chekhov's work as a doctor enriched his writing by bringing him into intimate contact with all sections of Russian society: for example, he witnessed at first hand the peasants' unhealthy and cramped living conditions, which he recalled in his short story "Peasants". Chekhov visited the upper classes as well, recording in his notebook: "Aristocrats? The same ugly bodies and physical uncleanliness, the same toothless old age and disgusting death, as with market-women."&lt;ref name = "note"&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/12494 ''Note-Book''.]. Retrieved 16 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1894, Chekhov began writing his play ''The Seagull'' in a lodge he had built in the orchard at Melikhovo. In the two years since he had moved to the estate, he had refurbished the house, taken up agriculture and horticulture, tended the orchard and the pond, and planted many trees, which, according to Mikhail, he "looked after&amp;nbsp;... as though they were his children.

The first night of ''The Seagull'', at the [[Alexandrinsky Theatre]] in St. Petersburg on 17 October 1896, was a fiasco, as the play was booed by the audience, stinging Chekhov into renouncing the theatre.{{sfn|Rayfield|1997|pp=394–8}} But the play so impressed the theatre director [[Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko]] that he convinced his colleague [[Konstantin Stanislavski]] to direct a new production for the innovative [[Moscow Art Theatre]] in 1898.&lt;ref name = "Ben"&gt;Benedetti, ''Stanislavski: An Introduction'', 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Stanislavski's attention to psychological realism and ensemble playing coaxed the buried subtleties from the text, and restored Chekhov's interest in playwriting.&lt;ref&gt;Chekhov and the Art Theatre, in Stanislavski's words, were united in a common desire "to achieve artistic simplicity and truth on the stage." Allen, 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The Art Theatre commissioned more plays from Chekhov and the following year staged ''Uncle Vanya'', which Chekhov had completed in 1896.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rayfield|1997|pp=390–1|ps=Rayfield draws from his critical study ''Chekhov's "Uncle Vanya" and the "Wood Demon"'' (1995), which anatomised the evolution of the ''Wood Demon'' into ''Uncle Vanya''—"one of Chekhov's most furtive achievements."}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the last decades of his life he became an [[atheist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tabachnikova|first=Olga|title=Anton Chekhov Through the Eyes of Russian Thinkers: Vasilii Rozanov, Dmitrii Merezhkovskii and Lev Shestov|year=2010|publisher=Anthem Press|isbn=978-1-84331-841-5|page=26|quote=For Rozanov, Chekhov represents a concluding stage of classical Russian literature at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, caused by the fading of the thousand-year-old Christian tradition that had sustained much of this literature.

===Yalta===
In March 1897, Chekhov suffered a major haemorrhage of the lungs while on a visit to Moscow.  With great difficulty he was persuaded to enter a clinic, where the doctors diagnosed tuberculosis on the upper part of his lungs and ordered a change in his manner of life.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Suvorin, 1 April 1897. [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6408 ''Letters of Anton Chekhov''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

After his father's death in 1898, Chekhov bought a plot of land on the outskirts of [[Yalta]] and built a [[White Dacha|villa]], into which he moved with his mother and sister the following year. Though he planted trees and flowers, kept dogs and tame cranes, and received guests such as [[Leo Tolstoy]] and [[Maxim Gorky]], Chekhov was always relieved to leave his "hot [[Siberia]]" for Moscow or travels abroad. He vowed to move to Taganrog as soon as a water supply was installed there.&lt;ref&gt;Olga Knipper, "Memoir", in Benedetti, ''Dear Writer, Dear Actress'', 37, 270.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Bartlett 2"&gt;Bartlett, 2.&lt;/ref&gt; In Yalta he completed two more plays for the Art Theatre, composing with greater difficulty than in the days when he "wrote serenely, the way I eat pancakes now". He took a year each over ''[[Three Sisters (play)|Three Sisters]]'' and ''[[The Cherry Orchard]]''.{{sfn|Malcolm|2004|pp=170–71}}

On 25 May 1901, Chekhov married [[Olga Knipper]] quietly, owing to his horror of weddings. She was a former protegée and sometime lover of Nemirovich-Danchenko whom he had first met at rehearsals for ''The Seagull''.&lt;ref&gt;"I have a horror of weddings, the congratulations and the champagne, standing around, glass in hand with an endless grin on your face." Letter to Olga Knipper, 19 April 1901.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Benedetti 125"&gt;Benedetti, ''Dear Writer, Dear Actress'', 125.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rayfield|1997|p=500|ps="Olga's relations with Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko were more than professional."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up to that point, Chekhov, known as "Russia's most elusive literary bachelor,"&lt;ref&gt;Harvey Pitcher in ''Chekhov's Leading Lady'', quoted in {{harvnb|Malcolm|2004|p=59}}.&lt;/ref&gt; had preferred passing liaisons and visits to brothels over commitment.&lt;ref&gt;"Chekhov had the temperament of a philanderer. Sexually, he preferred brothels or swift liaisons."{{harvnb|Wood|2000|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had once written to Suvorin:

{{quote|By all means I will be married if you wish it. But on these conditions: everything must be as it has been hitherto — that is, she must live in Moscow while I live in the country, and I will come and see her&amp;nbsp;... I promise to be an excellent husband, but give me a wife who, like the moon, won't appear in my sky every day.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Suvorin, 23 March 1895. [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6408 ''Letters of Anton Chekhov''.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The letter proved prophetic of Chekhov's marital arrangements with Olga: he lived largely at Yalta, she in Moscow, pursuing her acting career. In 1902, Olga suffered a miscarriage; and [[Donald Rayfield]] has offered evidence, based on the couple's letters, that conception may have occurred when Chekhov and Olga were apart, although Russian scholars have rejected that claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rayfield|1997|pp=556–57|ps=Rayfield also tentatively suggests, drawing on obstetric clues, that Olga suffered an [[ectopic pregnancy]] rather than a miscarriage.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Simmons Benedetti"&gt;There was certainly tension between the couple after the miscarriage, though {{harvnb|Simmons|1970|p=569}}, and Benedetti, ''Dear Writer, Dear Actress'', 241, put this down to Chekhov's mother and sister blaming the miscarriage on Olga's late-night socialising with her actor friends.&lt;/ref&gt; The literary legacy of this long-distance marriage is a correspondence that preserves gems of theatre history, including shared complaints about Stanislavski's directing methods and Chekhov's advice to Olga about performing in his plays.&lt;ref&gt;Benedetti, ''Dear Writer, Dear Actress: The Love Letters of Olga Knipper and Anton Chekhov''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Yalta, Chekhov wrote one of his most famous stories,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eastoftheweb.com/short-stories/UBooks/LadyWith.shtml|title=Lady with lapdog|last=Chekhov|first=Anton|website=Short Stories}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[The Lady with the Dog (short story)|The Lady with the Dog]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Rosamund, Bartlett|title=The House That Chekhov Built |journal=London Evening Standard|date= 2 February 2010|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also translated from the Russian as "Lady with Lapdog"),&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, Yael.

Web. 3 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; which depicts what at first seems a casual liaison between a cynical married man and an unhappy married woman who meet while vacationing in [[Yalta]]. Neither expects anything lasting from the encounter.  Unexpectedly though, they gradually fall deeply in love and end up risking scandal and the security of their family lives.  The story masterfully captures their feelings for each other, the inner transformation undergone by the disillusioned male protagonist as a result of falling deeply in love, and their inability to resolve the matter by either letting go of their families or of each other.&lt;ref&gt;"Overview: 'The Lady with the Dog'."

===Death===
By May 1904, Chekhov was terminally ill with [[tuberculosis]]. Mikhail Chekhov recalled that "everyone who saw him secretly thought the end was not far off, but the nearer [he] was to the end, the less he seemed to realise it."&lt;ref name = "Bio"/&gt; On 3 June, he set off with Olga for the German spa town of [[Badenweiler]] in the [[Black Forest]], from where he wrote outwardly jovial letters to his sister Masha, describing the food and surroundings, and assuring her and his mother that he was getting better. In his last letter, he complained about the way German women dressed.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to sister Masha, 28 June 1904. [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6408 ''Letters of Anton Chekhov''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chekhov's death has become one of "the great set pieces of literary history,"{{sfn|Malcolm|2004|p=62}} retold, embroidered, and fictionalised many times since, notably in the short story "Errand" by [[Raymond Carver]]. In 1908, Olga wrote this account of her husband's last moments:

{{quote|Anton sat up unusually straight and said loudly and clearly (although he knew almost no German): ''Ich sterbe'' ("I'm dying"). The doctor calmed him, took a syringe, gave him an injection of [[camphor]], and ordered champagne. Anton took a full glass, examined it, smiled at me and said: "It's a long time since I drank champagne." He drained it and lay quietly on his left side, and I just had time to run to him and lean across the bed and call to him, but he had stopped breathing and was sleeping peacefully as a child&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;Olga Knipper, ''Memoir'', in Benedetti, ''Dear Writer, Dear Actress'', 284.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Chekhov's body was transported to Moscow in a refrigerated railway car meant for [[oyster]]s, a detail that offended [[Maxim Gorky|Gorky]].&lt;ref&gt;"Banality revenged itself upon him by a nasty prank, for it saw that his corpse, the corpse of a poet, was put into a railway truck 'For the Conveyance of Oysters'." Maxim Gorky in [http://www.eldritchpress.org/ac/gorky.htm ''Reminiscences of Anton Chekhov''.].

==Legacy==
A few months before he died, Chekhov told the writer [[Ivan Bunin]] that he thought people might go on reading his writings for seven years. "Why seven?" asked Bunin. "Well, seven and a half," Chekhov replied. "That's not bad. I've got six years to live."&lt;ref&gt;Payne, XXXVI.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Chekhov-bios1-1024.jpg|thumb|Chekhov biographies]]
Chekhov's posthumous reputation greatly exceeded his expectations. The ovations for the play ''[[The Cherry Orchard]]'' in the year of his death served to demonstrate the Russian public's acclaim for the writer, which placed him second in literary celebrity only to [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]], who outlived him by six years. Tolstoy was an early admirer of Chekhov's short stories and had a series that he deemed "first quality" and "second quality" bound into a book. In the first category were: ''Children'', ''The Chorus Girl'', ''A Play'', ''Home'', ''Misery'', ''The Runaway'', ''In Court'', ''Vanka'', ''Ladies'', ''A Malefactor'', ''The Boys'', ''Darkness'', ''Sleepy'', ''The Helpmate'', and ''[[The Darling (Chekhov)|The Darling]]"''; in the second: ''A Transgression'', ''Sorrow'', ''The Witch'', ''Verochka'', ''In a Strange Land'', ''The Cook's Wedding'', ''A Tedious Business'', ''An Upheaval'', ''Oh! The Public!'', ''The Mask'', ''A Woman's Luck'', ''Nerves'', ''The Wedding'', ''A Defenseless Creature'', and ''Peasant Wives.''{{sfn|Simmons|1970|p=595}}

In Chekhov's lifetime, British and Irish critics generally did not find his work pleasing; [[E. J. Dillon]] thought "the effect on the reader of Chekhov's tales was repulsion at the gallery of human waste represented by his fickle, spineless, drifting people" and [[R. E. C. Long]] said "Chekhov's characters were repugnant, and that Chekhov reveled in stripping the last rags of dignity from the human soul".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meister|first=Charles W.|year=1953|title=Chekhov's Reception in England and America|journal=American Slavic and East European Review|volume=12|issue=1|pages=109–121|jstor=3004259|doi=10.2307/3004259}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his death, Chekhov was reappraised. [[Constance Garnett]]'s translations won him an English-language readership and the admiration of writers such as [[James Joyce]], [[Virginia Woolf]], and [[Katherine Mansfield]], whose story "The Child Who Was Tired" is similar to Chekhov's "Sleepy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William H. New|title=Reading Mansfield and Metaphors of Reform|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|year=1999|isbn= 978-0-7735-1791-2|pages=15–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian critic [[D. S. Mirsky]], who lived in England, explained Chekhov's popularity in that country by his "unusually complete rejection of what we may call the heroic values."{{sfn|Wood|2000|p=77}} In Russia itself, Chekhov's drama fell out of fashion after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|revolution]], but it was later incorporated into the Soviet canon. The character of Lopakhin, for example, was reinvented as a hero of the new order, rising from a modest background so as eventually to possess the gentry's estates.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, 88.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Danchenko"&gt;"They won't allow a play which is seen to lament the lost estates of the gentry." Letter of [[Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko]], quoted by Anatoly Smeliansky in "Chekhov at the Moscow Art Theatre", from ''The Cambridge Companion to Chekhov'', 31–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first non-Russians to praise Chekhov's plays was [[George Bernard Shaw]], who subtitled his ''[[Heartbreak House]]'' "A Fantasia in the Russian Manner on English Themes," and pointed out similarities between the predicament of the British landed class and that of their Russian counterparts as depicted by Chekhov: "the same nice people, the same utter futility."&lt;ref&gt;Anna Obraztsova in "Bernard Shaw's Dialogue with Chekhov", from Miles, 43–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, Chekhov's reputation began its rise slightly later, partly through the influence of [[Stanislavski's system]] of acting, with its notion of [[subtext]]: "Chekhov often expressed his thought not in speeches," wrote Stanislavski, "but in pauses or between the lines or in replies consisting of a single word&amp;nbsp;... the characters often feel and think things not expressed in the lines they speak."&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Elizabeth (ed), ''Stanislavski's Legacy'', Theatre Arts Books, 1987, {{ISBN|978-0-87830-127-0}}, 81, 83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Eßlin"&gt;"It was Chekhov who first deliberately wrote dialogue in which the mainstream of emotional action ran underneath the surface. It was he who articulated the notion that human beings hardly ever speak in explicit terms among each other about their deepest emotions, that the great, tragic, climactic moments are often happening beneath outwardly trivial conversation." [[Martin Esslin]], from ''Text and Subtext in Shavian Drama'', in ''1922: Shaw and the last Hundred Years'', ed. Bernard. F. Dukore, Penn State Press, 1994, {{ISBN|978-0-271-01324-4}}, 200.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Group Theatre (New York)|Group Theatre]], in particular, developed the subtextual approach to drama, influencing generations of [[Theater in the United States|American playwrights]], screenwriters, and actors, including [[Clifford Odets]], [[Elia Kazan]] and, in particular, [[Lee Strasberg]]. In turn, Strasberg's [[Actors Studio]] and the [[Method acting|"Method" acting]] approach influenced many actors, including [[Marlon Brando]] and [[Robert De Niro]], though by then the Chekhov tradition may have been distorted by a preoccupation with realism.&lt;ref&gt;"Lee Strasberg became in my opinion a victim of the traditional idea of Chekhovian theatre&amp;nbsp;... [he left] no room for Chekhov's imagery." Georgii Tostonogov on Strasberg's production of ''Three Sisters'' in ''The Drama Review'' (winter 1968), quoted by Styan, 121.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, the playwright [[Tennessee Williams]] adapted ''The Seagull'' as ''[[The Notebook of Trigorin]]''. One of Anton's nephews, [[Michael Chekhov]] would also contribute heavily to modern theatre, particularly through his unique acting methods which developed Stanislavski's ideas further.

Despite Chekhov's reputation as a playwright, [[William Boyd (writer)|William Boyd]] asserts that his short stories represent the greater achievement.&lt;ref name = "Boyd"&gt;"The plays lack the seamless authority of the fiction: there are great characters, wonderful scenes, tremendous passages, moments of acute melancholy and sagacity, but the parts appear greater than the whole." [http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/classics/story/0,6000,1261403,00.html ''A Chekhov Lexicon,''] by [[William Boyd (writer)|William Boyd]], ''The Guardian'', 3 July 2004. Retrieved 16 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Raymond Carver]], who wrote the short story "Errand" about Chekhov's death, believed that Chekhov was the greatest of all short story writers:

{{quote|Chekhov's stories are as wonderful (and necessary) now as when they first appeared. It is not only the immense number of stories he wrote—for few, if any, writers have ever done more—it is the awesome frequency with which he produced masterpieces, stories that shrive us as well as delight and move us, that lay bare our emotions in ways only true art can accomplish.&lt;ref&gt;Bartlett, [http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/classics/story/0,,1261382,00.html "From Russia, with Love"], ''The Guardian'', 15 July 2004. Retrieved 17 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Ernest Hemingway]], another writer influenced by Chekhov, was more grudging: "Chekhov wrote about six good stories. But he was an amateur writer."&lt;ref&gt;Letter from [[Ernest Hemingway]] to [[Archibald MacLeish]], 1925 (from ''Selected Letters'', p. 179), in ''Ernest Hemingway on Writing'', Ed Larry W. Phillips, Touchstone, (1984) 1999, {{ISBN|978-0-684-18119-6}}, 101.&lt;/ref&gt; And [[Vladimir Nabokov]] criticised Chekhov's "medley of dreadful prosaisms, ready-made epithets, repetitions."{{sfn|Wood|2000|p=82}}&lt;ref&gt;[[q:Anton Chekhov#Quotes about Chekhov|Wikiquote quotes about Chekhov]]&lt;/ref&gt; But he also declared “yet it is his works which I would take on a trip to another planet”&lt;ref name="Karlinsky"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Karlinsky|first=Simon|date=2008-06-13|title=Nabokov and Chekhov: Affinities, parallels, structures|url=http://revel.unice.fr/cycnos/index.html?id=1276|volume=10|issue=n°1 NABOKOV : Autobiography, Biography and Fiction|access-date=2018-09-10|website=Cycno}}&lt;/ref&gt; and called "[[The Lady with the Dog]]" "one of the greatest stories ever written" in its depiction of a problematic relationship, and described Chekhov as writing "the way one person relates to another the most important things in his life, slowly and yet without a break, in a slightly subdued voice."&lt;ref&gt;From [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s ''Lectures on Russian Literature'', quoted by [[Francine Prose]] in ''Learning from Chekhov'', 231.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the writer [[William Boyd (writer)|William Boyd]], Chekhov's historical accomplishment was to abandon what [[William Gerhardie]] called the "event plot" for something more "blurred, interrupted, mauled or otherwise tampered with by life."&lt;ref&gt;"For the first time in literature the fluidity and randomness of life was made the form of the fiction. Before Chekhov, the event-plot drove all fictions." [[William Boyd (writer)|William Boyd]], referring to the novelist [[William Gerhardie]]'s analysis in ''Anton Chekhov: A Critical Study'', 1923. [http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/classics/story/0,6000,1261403,00.html "A Chekhov Lexicon"] by William Boyd, ''The Guardian'', 3 July 2004. Retrieved 16 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Virginia Woolf mused on the unique quality of a Chekhov story in ''The Common Reader'' (1925):

{{quote|But is it the end, we ask? We have rather the feeling that we have overrun our signals; or it is as if a tune had stopped short without the expected chords to close it. These stories are inconclusive, we say, and proceed to frame a criticism based upon the assumption that stories ought to conclude in a way that we recognise. In so doing we raise the question of our own fitness as readers. Where the tune is familiar and the end emphatic—lovers united, villains discomfited, intrigues exposed—as it is in most [[Victorian literature|Victorian fiction]], we can scarcely go wrong, but where the tune is unfamiliar and the end a note of interrogation or merely the information that they went on talking, as it is in Tchekov, we need a very daring and alert sense of literature to make us hear the tune, and in particular those last notes which complete the harmony.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, Virginia, ''The Common Reader: First Series, Annotated Edition'', Harvest/HBJ Book, 2002, {{ISBN|0-15-602778-X}}, 172.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While a Professor of Comparative Literature at Princeton University, Michael Goldman presented his view on defining the elusive quality of Chekhov's comedies stating: "Having learned that Chekhov is comic&amp;nbsp;... Chekhov is comic in a very special, paradoxical way. His plays depend, as comedy does, on the vitality of the actors to make pleasurable what would otherwise be painfully awkward – inappropriate speeches, missed connections, ''faux pas'', stumbles, childishness – but as part of a deeper pathos; the stumbles are not pratfalls but an energized, graceful dissolution of purpose."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Goldman, ''The Actor's Freedom: Towards a Theory of Drama'', p72.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alan Twigg]], the chief editor and publisher of the Canadian book review magazine ''[[B.C. BookWorld|BC Bookworld]] wrote,
{{quote|One can argue Anton Chekhov is the second-most popular writer on the planet.

Chekhov has also influenced the work of Japanese playwrights including [[Shimizu Kunio]], [[Yōji Sakate]], and [[Ai Nagai]]. Critics have noted similarities in how Chekhov and Shimizu use a mixture of light humor as well as an intense depictions of longing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rimer|first1=J.|title=Japanese Theatre and the International Stage|publisher=Koninklijke Brill NV|location=Leiden, The Netherlands|isbn=90-04-12011-4|pages=299–311}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sakate adapted several of Chekhov's plays and transformed them in the general style of ''[[nō]]''.&lt;ref name=Clayton&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clayton|first1=J. Douglas|title=Adapting Chekhov: The Text and Its Mutations|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-50969-5|pages=269–270}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nagai also adapted Chekhov's plays, including [[Three Sisters (play)|''Three Sisters'']], and transformed his dramatic style into Nagai's style of satirical realism while emphasising the social issues depicted on the play.&lt;ref name=Clayton/&gt;

Chekhov's works have been adapted for the screen, including [[Sidney Lumet]]'s ''[[The Sea Gull|Sea Gull]]'' and [[Louis Malle]]'s ''[[Vanya on 42nd Street]]''. [[Laurence Olivier]]'s final effort as a film director was a 1970 adaption of ''[[Three Sisters (1970 film)|Three Sisters]]'' in which he also played a supporting role. His work has also served as inspiration or been referenced in numerous films. In [[Andrei Tarkovsky]]'s 1975 film [[The Mirror (1975 film)|''The Mirror'']], characters discuss his short story "[[Ward No. 6]]". Woody Allen has been influenced by Chekhov and reference to his works are present in many of his films including ''[[Love and Death]]'' (1975), ''[[Interiors]]'' (1978) and ''[[Hannah and Her Sisters]]'' (1986). Plays by Chekhov are also referenced in [[François Truffaut]]'s 1980 drama film ''[[The Last Metro]]'', which is set in a theatre. A portion of a stage production of ''Three Sisters'' appears in the 2014 drama film ''[[Still Alice]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1827">'''Aphelia''' (Greek, "plainness") is a rhetorical term that refers to the plainness of writing or speech.&lt;ref&gt;Lanham, Richard A. ''A Handlist of Rhetorical Terms''. 2nd ed. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1991. 17. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to explain or teach rather than to entertain or elicit an emotional response.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman, Brett. "A Catalogue of Rhetorical and Other Literary Terms from American Literature and Oratory." ''Style'' 22 Dec. 1997: n. pag. Web. 29 Sep. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
The sentence structure is typically both short in length and lacks "poetic and rhetorical adornment." &lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman, Brett. ''Edgar Allan Poe: Rhetoric and Style''. Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2005. 139. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Parataxis]] and [[asyndeton]] are also expected within the plain style. Writing or speech using aphelia may display a "right-branching" sentence structure for the most part; that is, the sentence will begin with an [[independent clause]] that will be followed by at least one [[dependent clause]].&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman, Brett. ''Edgar Allan Poe: Rhetoric and Style''. Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2005. 138. Print&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
*"In plain prose, here are four whales as well known to the students of Cetacean History as Marius or Sylla to the classic scholar." — [[Herman Melville]], [[Moby-Dick]]
*"I knew what the old man felt, and pitied him, but chuckled at heart." — [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[The Tell-Tale Heart]]
*"She presented all of the ordinary appearances of death. The face assumed the usual pinched and sunken outline. The lips were of usual marble pallor. The eyes were lustreless. There was no warmth. Pulsation had ceased." — [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[The Premature Burial]]

[[Image:Apollon de Mantoue Louvre MA689.jpg|thumb|220px|Detail of the ''Apollon de Mantoue'' ([[Louvre Museum]])]] 
The '''Apollo of Mantua''' and its variants are early forms of the [[Apollo Citharoedus]] statue type, in which the god holds the [[cithara]] in his left arm.  The type-piece, the first example discovered, is named for its location at Mantua; the type is represented by [[neo-Attic]] Imperial Roman copies of the late 1st or early 2nd century, modelled upon a supposed Greek bronze original made in the second quarter of the 5th century BCE, in a style similar to works of [[Polykleitos|Polyclitus]] but more archaic.  The Apollo held the ''cythara''  against his extended left arm, of which in the Louvre example (''illustration'') a fragment of one twisting scrolling horn upright remains against his biceps. 

More than a dozen other replicas of the type have been found, the principal ones being those conserved in the national museums of [[Naples]] and of [[Mantua]].

The lost original would have been bronze. The name of the teacher of [[Phidias]], [[Hegias of Athens]] is sometimes invoked, but there are no surviving examples of Hegias' work to judge from.

Examples include:

:The Naples ''Apollo of Mantua'', a bronze found at [[Pompeii]], in the [[Naples National Archaeological Museum|Museo Archeologico Nazionale]], Naples (inv. 5630).

:The Louvre ''Apollo of Mantua'', formerly in the [[Bibliothèque Mazarine]], entered the museum in 1871.

:The [[Fogg Art Museum]] ''Apollo of Mantua'', a Roman bronze&lt;ref&gt;Spectroscopy revealed the alloy in fact to be [[brass]] (Congdon 1963).&lt;/ref&gt; head of the ''Apollo of Mantua'' type, originally about one-third lifesize.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2420">[[Image:Gielda Wwa beax.jpg|thumb|200px|Former headquarters of the Central Committee in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]].]]
'''Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party''' ({{lang-pl|Komitet Centralny Polskiej Zjednoczonej Partii Robotniczej}}, KC PZPR) was the central ruling body of the [[Polish United Workers' Party]], the dominant political party in the [[People's Republic of Poland]] (1948-1990).

==Functions==
Members of the Committee convened about every four months. The Committee elected representatives to various bodies, among which the most important was the [[Politburo of the Polish United Workers' Party]], which took actions between the conventions.

==Leaders==
By the year 1954 the head of the party was the Chair of the Central Committee. They ''de facto'' replaced the abolished position of the [[President of Poland]]:
* Secretary General [[Bolesław Bierut]] (December 22, 1948 – March 12, 1956)
* First Secretary [[Edward Ochab]] (March 20, 1956 – October 21, 1956)
* First Secretary [[Władysław Gomułka]] (October 21, 1956 - December 20, 1970)
* First Secretary [[Edward Gierek]] (December 20, 1970 – September 6, 1980)
* First Secretary [[Stanisław Kania]] (September 6, 1980 – October 18, 1981)
* First Secretary [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]] (October 18, 1981 – July 29, 1989)
* First Secretary [[Mieczysław Rakowski]] (July 29, 1989 – January 29, 1990)

==Seat==
By 1990 the decision-making center was situated in a building erected by obligatory subscription in the years 1948-1952. The shares, called ″little bricks" (in Polish ''"cegiełka"'') with nominal values of 50, 100 and 500 [[Zloty]]s, were distributed among the entire society. The building was officially called the Party's House, and was also known as the White House or the House of Sheep. Since 1991 the [[Bank-Financial Center "New World"]] is located in this building. In 1991-2000 the [[Warsaw Stock Exchange]] had also its seat in this building.

From 1918 to 1931 a building with the seat of communication department was located in that place. Earlier – from the [[November Uprising]] to 1918 – there was also the seat of the Clearing-House.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7265">The '''Coalition of Asian Pacifics in Entertainment''' (CAPE) is an organization that advocates for [[Asian Americans]] and [[Pacific Islanders]] in the [[entertainment]] industry. Established in 1991, CAPE "champions diversity by educating, connecting, and empowering Asian American and Pacific Islander artists and leaders in entertainment and media."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Mission and History|url=http://capeusa.org/mission/|website=CAPE Usa|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
CAPE was founded in 1991 as a way to connect AAPIs in the entertainment industry by television producer and executive [[Wenda Fong]], publicist [[Fritz Friedman]], and film producer and executive [[Chris Lee (producer)|Chris Lee]]. The organization had few members when it was founded, as there were very few Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders who were very visible in the media. However, since its founding, CAPE has grown to support both new and established actors, writers, directors, producers, agents, and executives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Mission and History|url=http://capeusa.org/mission/|website=CAPE Usa|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite starting small, the CAPE community mobilized through volunteer efforts, and their educational programs and opportunities have helped members develop their careers in the entertainment industry by connecting them to the tools they need to enhance their careers. Additionally, CAPE has been working on developing connections with US and International film industries of [[China]], [[India]], [[Korea]], [[Japan]], [[Taiwan]], and the [[Philippines]].

In 2009, CAPE hired its first Executive Director, Jennifer Sanderson. In 2014, CAPE moved from being a paid membership-driven organization to a mission-driven organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Important Announcement from CAPE|url=http://capeusa.org/an-important-announcement-from-cape/|website=CAPE Usa|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization decided that in order to fulfill its original goals of serving the AAPI community, they needed to open up their resources to be available to anyone who needed to access them.

In December 2014, Jennifer Sanderson officially stepped down. In 2015, Michelle K. Sugihara took helm and is currently CAPE's Executive Director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://capeusa.org/2015/04/cape-welcomes-new-executive-director-michelle-k-sugihara/|title=CAPE Welcomes New Executive Director Michelle K.

(Available on the CD ''You have not to  laugh, don't you?'')&lt;/ref&gt; is a humorous recital of the alphabet, parodying the way the alphabet is taught to small children.

"Ceefer" as a name for a cat also appeared in Australia after the Second World War (C for cat) influenced by returning servicemen from England who had been exposed to the humour of the Cockney Alphabet.

'''Communist Party of Finland''' ({{lang-fi|Suomen Kommunistinen Puolue}}, SKP {{lang-sv|Finlands kommunistiska parti}}, FKP) is a political party in Finland. It was founded in the mid-1980s as '''Communist Party of Finland (Unity)''' ({{lang-fi|Suomen Kommunistinen Puolue (yhtenäisyys)}}, SKPy, {{lang-sv|Finlands kommunistiska parti(enhet)}} FKP(e)) by the former opposition of the old [[Communist Party of Finland]] (1918–1992). SKP is not represented in the [[eduskunta|Finnish parliament]], but the party has local councillors in some municipalities, including the city councils of [[Helsinki]] and [[Tampere]]. SKP claims 2,500 members.

The party has been officially registered since 1997. In the 1980s, when the opposition and the organizations it controlled were expelled from the SKP led by [[Arvo Aalto]], the SKPy, however, chose not to register since they considered themselves the real SKP and claimed Aalto had illegally stolen the party. The courts later ruled all the expulsions illegal.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==History==

===The opposition inside SKP===

The internal conflict of Finnish communists began in the mid-1960s, when the party led by the new chairman [[Aarne Saarinen]], began to modernize the party line / outlook. A minority of the party cadre didn't accept this and they accused the SKP leadership of being [[Marxist revisionism|revisionist]]. SKP didn't break up in the 1960s and the party was formally united until the mid-1980s. After the 20th party congress in 1984 things, however, changed as [[Arvo Aalto]] was elected chairman, after which the opposition didn't participate in (or was left out of) the SKP central committee. The opposition, which was also known as “[[taistoism|taistoists]]”, called supporters of Aalto “axe liners”.

===The founding of SKPy===
The central committee of the SKP expelled eight opposition district organizations from the party 13 October 1985. Also, 494 other basic organizations and 17 city or regional organizations were expelled 13 June 1986, which the expelled then dubbed “Black Friday”. The opposition considered the actions to be against the law. They took the conflict to courts and because of minor technicalities Helsingin Hovioikeus court overruled SKP's decision 11 June 1987. SKP then re-expelled these same organizations in its 21st party congress (12–14 June 1987). However, a week before this happened, the newly founded SKP (Unity) held its own “21st” party congress. The ambiguities in the expelling process and the opposition's firm belief in its own cause gave it the justification it needed and they considered SKPy to be the real SKP. They claimed Aalto had illegally seized the party with “paper members”. SKPy was never taken to the official party register of Finland as the party considered that to have been voluntary resignation and admission of SKPy not being the real SKP.

April 26, 1986 a meeting of "the representatives of SKP organizations" was held in [[Tampere]] and those present elected a new central committee. The leader of the new central committee was [[Taisto Sinisalo]], former vice chairman of the SKP and the most well-known figure of the opposition, who already had led ''Committee of SKP Organizations'' founded in November 1985. In the SKPy's 21st party congress Sinisalo was re-elected. [[Yrjö Hakanen]] and [[Marja-Liisa Löyttyjärvi]] became the vice chairmen while the former SKP chairman [[Jouko Kajanoja]] was elected party secretary. In his congress speech, Sinisalo told that the suffix “unity” meant “strong intention to gather all the forces of the SKP”. The congress, however, also was heading to future and building of a new party, or “rebuilding” as they thought it. Before the name SKPy was adopted the party was known in media as the ''unity'' or ''Tiedonantaja group''.

===SKP and the Soviet Union===
SKPy was very committed to the [[Soviet Union]] and the political line of its [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] (CPSU), which was going through great changes during [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]]'s time. SKPy supported [[perestroika]] but criticized those who claimed to have been "Gorbachevist" even before Gorbachev's time. SKPy claimed SKP to be anti-SU and tried to give the Finnish people as positive a picture as possible of that country. When SKP split the monetary support from Soviet Union was halted and, for example, the very profitable publishing deals of the SKP had gone to SKPy. Gorbachev's CPSU, however, had relations with both parties.

===KTP splits from SKPy===
In the late 1970s the opposition of SKP began to split as those supporting a more traditional version of [[Marxism-Leninism]] began to criticize opposition leaders. When it was decided that SKPy would not be registered as an official party, some communists protested and demanded registration. They thought SKPy was clinging to the unity slogan in a situation in which it no longer seemed realistic. In the 1987 party congress, these people were warned by the SKPy leadership but they chose to ignore the advice and oriented themselves toward founding a new party. [[For Peace and Socialism - Communist Workers Party]] (''Kommunistinen Työväenpuolue – Rauhan ja Sosialismin puolesta'', KTP) was founded early in the year 1988. Founders of KTP felt to be securing the existence of a Marxist-Leninist party in Finland while criticizing SKPy for being revisionist and supporting [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. The most famous figure in the new party was probably [[Markus Kainulainen]], a longtime SKP district secretary of [[Uusimaa]] and a former MP.

===The founding of Left Alliance===
[[Esko-Juhani Tennilä]], a member of the [[Parliament of Finland]], was elected new chairman of SKPy 22 October 1989 when Kajanoja decided to resign while strongly criticizing his comrades. Tennilä has later told he took the job to secure that the founding of a new united left party would not be sabotaged by his own party comrades many of which were quite critical of it. The [[Left Alliance (Finland)|Left Alliance]] (''Vasemmistoliitto'') was founded in spring 1990 and members of SKPy and its electoral front Deva also joined even though prejudices were very high on both sides at this point.

===Dispute over double membership===
Members of the [[Left Alliance (Finland)|Left Alliance]] (LA) disliked that many of their members were also members of the SKPy. It was thus decided that SKPy members couldn't participate in the LA's electoral lists, even though they could be members. Because of this, Tennilä also had to quit his job as party chairman when joining LA group in parliament. [[Yrjö Hakanen]] was chosen Tennilä's successor. The dispute over double membership, as it was called, led to many SKPy members leaving LA and relations between the two parties got even colder. On the other hand, many former SKPy members were actively participating in LA.

===The “new” SKP===
In its 1993 party congress (August 28–29) SKPy oriented towards founding a new officially registered communist party and drafting of a new party program. A new party logo was also introduced to mark renewal. It was suggested that a congress to continue SKP's work should be held and that happened next year (November 26–27). In the congress the suffix “unity” was dropped from the name as SKPy now considered to consist of all those comrades who wanted to have an independent communist party. An athletic club was made the basis of new organization and renamed SKP. The decision split the party as some supporters would have preferred SKP to have a lesser role as “Marxist forum” of some kind. Leadership of Left Alliance was also not pleased with those plans. SKP would have wanted to stay inside LA but that wasn't possible and the parties split in the spring of 1994. SKP wasn't however “re-registered” until 1997. There was some confusion, as the new SKP didn't accept responsibility for debts of the old one, which had gone bankrupt.

SKP has a nationwide organization consisting of 14 district organizations. The [[central committee]] has 41 members and the [[politbyro]] 10. The organ of SKP is ''[[Tiedonantaja]]'', which was founded in the 1960s. Tiedonantaja was also the organ of Deva during 1986-1990. The editor-in-chief is [[Marko Korvela]] since 2012. SKP also has some local papers.

As the SKPy considered itself to be the real SKP it also had the same organizational structure. It was based on [[Leninist]] principle of [[democratic centralism]] and the party rules of 1958 (modified in 1978).

===Deva – SKPy's electoral front===
While SKPy was never officially registered, its supporters founded an electoral front [[Democratic Alternative (Finland)|Democratic Alternative]] (''{{lang|fi|Demokraattinen vaihtoehto}}'', Deva). Those MPs of [[Finnish People's Democratic League]] (''{{lang|fi|Suomen kansan demokraattinen liitto}}'', SKDL, a front organization dominated by SKP) who were against expulsions were expelled from SKDL and they found the parliament group of Deva. Deva was SKPy's SKDL and it was supposed to attract some democratic allies. The small [[Socialist Workers Party (Finland)|Socialist Workers Party]] (''{{lang|fi|Sosialistinen työväenpuolue}}'', STP) didn't join Deva but it had members on the DEVA list. Young supporters of SKPy and Deva founded [[Revolutionary Youth League (Finland)|Revolutionary Youth League]] (''{{lang|fi|Vallankumouksellinen nuorisoliitto}}'', VKN) which was Deva's youth organization. SKDL's [[Socialist Student League (Finland)|Socialist Student League]] (''{{lang|fi|Sosialistinen opiskelijaliitto}}'', SOL) also joined. Deva was led by actress [[Kristiina Halkola]].

In [[Finnish parliamentary election, 1987|1987 parliamentary elections]] Deva got 4.3% of votes and four MPs. In [[Finnish presidential election, 1988|1988 presidential elections]] Deva candidate [[Jouko Kajanoja]] got under 2 per cent of the votes. Not even all members of SKPy supported Kajanoja who was the party chairman. Deva was closed down in 1990 after [[Left Alliance (Finland)|Left Alliance]] was founded and most of its members joined the new party.

The SKP participates in [[Elections in Finland#Parliamentary elections|parliamentary]], [[European Parliament elections|European Parliament]] and [[Elections in Finland#Municipal elections|municipal]] elections. The party has not put up candidates in recent [[presidential elections]]. No national representatives has been elected from the SKP lists but the party has a few local councillors. The SKP also participates in trade union and cooperative elections.

The SKP first took part in parliamentary elections in 1999. The party had electoral alliances with small parties of ''Muutos 99'' coalition. It was the first time the Finnish electorate had an opportunity to vote for a list named Communist Party of Finland. In 2003 the vote-puller for the party was rock musician [[Kari Peitsamo]] (1 803 votes) and in 2007 rap artist [[Steen1|Seppo "Steen1" Lampela]] (1 842).

In the local elections the SKP has had elected councillors in about ten different municipalities. The party has got its strongest support in [[Nokia (city)|Nokia]], where there are three SKP councillors. Communists also briefly had three councillors in the [[Jyväskylä]] city council until early 2008.

The SKP has made electoral coalitions with other small parties, especially the Communist Workers Party (KTP). Communist League members were on SKP lists before they in 2006 founded the [[Workers Party of Finland]] (STP). The SKP condemned the STP for scattering communist forces.&lt;ref&gt;KTP:stä erotetut hajottivat Vaihtoehtoväen (Tiedonantaja 22.9.2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The parties have made some limited electoral cooperation since. The Left Alliance has never been interested in coalitions with the communists,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skp.fi/ajankohtaista/110806TA.html Vasemmistoliitto torjui vaaliliitot SKP:n kanssa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927211453/http://www.skp.fi/ajankohtaista/110806TA.html |date=2007-09-27 }} (Tiedonantaja 11.8.2006)&lt;/ref&gt; although the parties have had coalitions in few municipalities.

The former SKP chairman [[Yrjö Hakanen]] is an elected member of [[HOK-Elanto]] cooperative council since 1999. The SKP represented joint list with the KTP.

'''David Wilkins''' (1685–1745), originally named '''Wilke''' or '''Wilkius''', was a [[Prussia]]n [[oriental studies|orientalist]], born in [[Klaipėda|Memel]], who settled in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccl-history.referata.com/wiki/David_Wilkins|title=David Wilkins - History of Canterbury Cathedral Library|publisher=|accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 1716 publication of the ''[[Coptic New Testament]]'' was the ''[[editio princeps]]''.

==Life==

He led for some years the life of a migratory student, visiting Berlin, Rome, Vienna, Paris, Amsterdam, Oxford, and Cambridge. Oxford denied him the M. A. degree (23 May 1712); but he became [[Lord Almoner's Professor of Arabic]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1724, having been created D.D. in October 1717. He was supported by [[William Wake]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], who gave him employment.

Besides Arabic he was versed in Hebrew, Chaldaic, Coptic, Armenian, and Anglo-Saxon (with a certain want of accuracy). Wilkins was ordained in the church of England, and Wake made him in 1715 librarian at [[Lambeth Palace]], and rector of [[Mongeham Parva]] (30 April 1716) and [[Great Chart]] (12 September 1719). He resigned both rectories on his collation in November 1719 to the rectories of [[Hadleigh, Suffolk|Hadleigh]] and [[Monks Eleigh]], [[Suffolk]], and the place of joint commissary of the archiepiscopal deanery of [[Bocking, Essex|Bocking]], [[Essex]]. In the same year he was appointed domestic chaplain to the Archbishop. 
In 1720 he was appointed Canon of the 12th prebend at Canterbury Cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;John Le Neve, ''Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae'', Series 1541-1857, III, iii. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; 
He became [[archdeacon of Suffolk]] (19 December 1724). On 13 January 1720 he was elected F.S.A.

Wilkins died at Hadleigh on 6 September 1745. His remains were interred in the chancel of Hadleigh church. He married on 15 November 1725, Margaret, eldest daughter of [[Thomas Fairfax, 5th Lord Fairfax of Cameron]], of [[Leeds Castle]], [[Kent]], by whom he left no issue. She died on 21 May 1750. Her brother Robert (afterwards seventh Lord Fairfax) is supposed to have purchased the greater part of Wilkins's manuscripts. The printed books were dispersed.

==Works==

Wilkins was librarian at Lambeth for little more than three years; but during that time he improved and completed [[Edmund Gibson]]'s catalogue, and also compiled a separate catalogue of the manuscripts. He contributed the Latin prefaces to [[John Chamberlayne]]'s polyglot edition of the [[Lord's Prayer]], and [[Thomas Tanner (bishop)|Thomas Tanner]]'s ''Bibliotheca Britannico-Hibernica''. He edited the following works:

*(1) ''Paraphrasis Chaldaica in Librum Chronicorum'' Amsterdam, 1715
*(2) ''Novum Testamentum Aegyptium, vulgo Copticum'' Oxford, 1710. A [[Latin]] translation from [[Coptic language|Coptic]] of the [[New Testament]], published in 500 copies, it remained in print for 191 years, selling on average one copy every 20 weeks, and is recognised by [[Guinness World Records]] as the world's slowest-selling book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/slowest-selling-book|title=Slowest selling book|publisher=|accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Praefixa est Davidis Wilkinsii praefatio'',  Excudit Gulielmus Bowyer, impensis Societatis ad Literas Promovendas institutae, 1748.&lt;/ref&gt;

His sole English publication seems to have been a ''Sermon preached at the Consecration of Thomas [Bowers], Lord Bishop of Chichester'' London, 1722, 4to. He left in manuscript ''Historical Account of the Church of Hadleigh'' which passed into the possession of his successor in the living, Dr. Tanner, and an ''Historia Ecclesiae Alexandrinae''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4928">In the [[philosophy of technology]], the '''device paradigm''' is the way "[[Technology|technological]] [[tool|device]]s" are perceived and consumed in modern society, according to [[Albert Borgmann]]. It explains the intimate relationship between people, things and technological devices, defining most economic relations and also shapes [[social]] and [[moral]] relations in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Moral Fragments and Moral Community: A Proposal for Church in Society|last=Rasmussen|first=Larry|publisher=Fortress Press|year=1993|isbn=0800627571|location=Minneapolis|pages=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the device paradigm is a critical response to the [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]]'s notion of [[Gestell]].&lt;ref&gt;[[William Lovitt]], introduction to Heidegger's ''The Question Concerning Technology''&lt;/ref&gt; It has been widely endorsed by philosophers of technology, including [[Hubert Dreyfus]], [[Andrew Feenberg]], and [[Eric Higgs (philosopher)|Eric Higgs]], as well as environmental philosopher [[David Strong]].

== Devices ==

For Borgmann, a '''device''' is a thing that is used as a means to an end. Therefore, a device is seen as "the compound of commodity and machinery" while "the distinctive pattern of division and connection of its components is the device paradigm."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Power Failure: Christianity in the Culture of Technology|last=Borgmann|first=Albert|publisher=Brazos Press|year=2003|isbn=1587430584|location=Grand Rapids, MI|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This term is meant to signify or distinguish between technological devices and "focal things and practices," which matter to people in their everyday affairs.&lt;ref name="Borgmannpage196"&gt;Borgmann (1984), p196.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A focal thing is something of ultimate concern and significance, which may be masked by the device paradigm, and must be preserved by its intimate connection with practice.&lt;ref&gt;Borgmann, (1984), p210.&lt;/ref&gt; Borgmann used the case of [[wine]] to explain this. He cited that the focal thing in [[winemaking]] involves the implements used to produce wine. Wine becomes a device when it employs technology and machinery not merely to produce wine but obtain specific qualities such as grapey, smooth, light, and fruity flavors or clean and clear appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Technology and the Character of Contemporary Life: A Philosophical Inquiry|last=Borgman|first=Albert|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2009|isbn=0226066290|location=Chicago|pages=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As technological devices increase the availability of a commodity or service, they also push these devices into the background where people do not pay attention to their destructive tendencies.&lt;ref name="Borgmannpage41"&gt;Borgmann (1984), p41.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the technology of central heating means that warmth is readily available and family members can retreat into the solitude of their rooms instead of working to chop wood or stoke the fires. Social interaction is reduced and the family struggles to find activities that enable such nurturing and care for each other.&lt;ref name="Borgmannpage41" /&gt; The ubiquitous nature of information technology also makes it an important example of device paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XM7teVMRRQUC&amp;pg=PA352|title=Technology and the Good Life?|last=Higgs|first=Eric|last2=Light|first2=Andrew|last3=Strong|first3=David|date=2010-12-15|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226333885|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Borgmannpage196" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borgmann (1984), p207.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Douglas Wilkie Medal''' is an award presented to those who do the least for [[Australian rules football]], in the best and fairest manner. An accolade presented by the [[Anti-Football League]], it is named after [[Douglas Wilkie]], a ''[[The Sun News-Pictorial|Sun News-Pictorial]]'' columnist who wrote for the paper during the years 1946–1986. It was Douglas Wilkie who first suggested the notion of an Anti-Football League, which was brought into being by [[Keith Dunstan]]. The League exists as a response to the overwhelming obsession of football by the [[Melbourne]] public.

The award is the League's answer to the [[Australian Football League]]'s [[Brownlow Medal]], an honour bestowed on footballers who throughout the season play in a skilled and sportsmanlike fashion.

Following the suggestion of Wilkie's fellow writer [[Cyril Pearl]], who wished to burn a football to express his disaffection for the game, the winner must destroy a football in a unique and creative manner on receiving their medal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://antifootballleague.org/douglas-wilkie-medal "Douglas Wilkie Medal"].

In [[family law]], '''effects of marriage''' is a legal [[legal term of art|term of art]] used to describe all of the rights and obligations that individuals may be subject and entitled to if they are in a [[common-law marriage]], an [[annulment|annulled]] marriage, [[domestic partnership]] or a [[civil union]].

Thus, even if the underlying marriage is held to be void there may still be rights and obligations that continue and are recognized by [[court order]]. An example may be an annulled marriage where the court awards alimony to the weaker, poorer or less well educated spouse to allow them a period of time to go back to school or re-enter the work force.

There are a few positive and negative influences of marriage on an individual.  First of all, an individual becomes excited that they will begin to share their life with someone who cares for them, and whom they feel comforted by. They will feel excited to know that soon they will be starting a family of their own, and that they will become parents of their own children.  Research has shown that those individuals who live a stable marital relationship tend to live longer, have a better physical health, better functional health at old age and better emotional health than those in troubled marriages or who are divorced.

On the other hand, there a few negative influences of marriage on an adult.  An adult can become stressed out on the fact that they will need to make compromises and sacrifices, in order to form a good marital relationship.  This can lead to a loss of hobbies, because there are restrictions about what the individuals can do; and these restrictions are for both the men and women in the relationship.  The adult may develop a sense of stress because they have a lot of responsibility ahead of them.  In addition, the individuals in the relationship can become upset by the fact that they have to make sure that their relationship has no betrayals, and it is kept loyal, throughout the couple’s lives.

== Traditional marriage ==
Healthier people in marriages may have a better chance of having a successful marriage.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://aspe.hhs.gov/report/effects-marriage-health-synthesis-recent-research-evidence-research-brief#1|title=The Effects of Marriage on Health: A Synthesis of Recent Research Evidence. Research Brief|date=2016-04-11|work=ASPE|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A healthier person may be more appealing to their partner. Married people are generally happier than unmarried people.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is said that marriage can affect person's health in many ways. For example, having a higher income could improve the health care person receives or lower stress. In certain marriages, a spouse may help in monitoring and encouraging healthy behaviors. As well as discouraging unhealthy habits. Marriage may provide an emotional fulfilling relationship. Which would satisfy the need for a social connection. This could have implications on a person's physical and mental health. Marriage is able to reduce depressive symptoms for both men and women. As marriage is able to reduce them, divorce is able to increase them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Marriage can also be associated with less healthier behaviors. For example, alcohol consumption, drug use, cigarette smoking, diet, and exercise.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Same-sex marriage ==
In [[Same-sex marriage|same-sex marriages]], marriage has a more positive effect than negative. Single persons in the same-sex world happen to be more distressed.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wight|first=Richard G.|last2=LeBlanc|first2=Allen J.|last3=Lee Badgett|first3=M.

Lesbians, gays, and bisexuals who are not in a legalized marriages have the highest psychological distress.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Marriage diminishes mental health issues between people in the same-sex community.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Polygamy ==
[[Polygamy|Polygamous marriages]] can have negative effects on women. Many women experience feelings of neglect and jealousy. &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenational.ae/uae/polygamy-can-negatively-affect-women-study-finds-1.234509|title=Polygamy can negatively affect women, study finds|work=The National|access-date=2018-05-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men, often times, are not fair when it comes to equally splitting their time. Although they may desire to be, they are not. It is possible that women rarely see their husbands or rarely have their needs met. This not only applies to women, but also their children.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The severity of the negative effects depend on the tolerance and patience of the wife. In more serious cases, it can range from depression, tantrums, or illness. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Differences between sex, race, and education ==
In opposition to men, women are more likely to get married and remarried. Women are also more likely to get married younger. &lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2013/article/marriage-and-divorce-patterns-by-gender-race-and-educational-attainment.htm#_edn1|title=Marriage and divorce: patterns by gender, race, and educational attainment : Monthly Labor Review: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|last=Aughinbaugh,Alison;Robles,Omar;Sun,Hugette|website=www.bls.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison to Hispanics and Whites, Blacks were less likely to get married and more likely to get divorced.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; People who did not complete high school were less likely to get married over people who did complete high school.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Divorce ==
As time goes on, many changes have affected divorce and marriage rates. Approximately 43% of people who get married at ages 15–16 get divorced. The rate for college marriages ending up in divorce, is a little less compared to high school. It happens to be 30%. Divorce rates decline as educational attainment increases. It is also said that people who marry later are less inclined to get divorced.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''Elite capture''' is a form of [[corruption]] whereby public resources are biased for the benefit of a few individuals of superior social status in detriment to the welfare of the larger population.  Elites are groups of individuals who, because of self-ratifying factors such as social class, asset ownership, religious affiliations, political power, historic discrimination among social groups, political party affiliation,  or economic position, have decision-making power in processes of public concern. This specific form of corruption occurs when elites use public funds, originally intended to be invested in services that benefit the larger population, to fund projects that would only benefit them. This differentiates elite capture from embezzlement, misappropriation or other diversion of funds by a public official. Elite capture is related to information asymmetry, inefficient regulation or inefficient allocation of resources because it causes a biased distribution of a public good or a service, resulting a situation wherein certain segments of the population experience reduced access to these public goods.  In this context, as long as there is elite capture, the welfare impact will not be Pareto Optimal nor equitable.

==Elite Capture in Decentralization==
For long it was thought that creating decentralized governments would avoid the limitations of a single planner in society. A centralized government often lacks knowledge and might be subject of intense lobbying, leaving certain territories unattended. On the other hand, theory predicts that when people are involved in governing and have representation in decision making, public spending is supposed to be more efficient, more equitable and more sustainable. However, despite the theoretical predictions, the outcomes of many development projects in decentralized governments have not met these expectations.
By yielding power to smaller units, money should be more efficiently distributed, but local governments are more vulnerable to pressure groups. Failure can occur when particular subgroups of the community are able to mobilize resources to further their own self-interest at the expense of the broader community. Local governments are even more vulnerable to capture by local elites than national governments.
Attempts to reduce elite capture in decentralized governments range from going back to a heavily centralized planner to providing citizens with funds to initiate projects. This last option has been criticized because the citizens’ ability and skills to actually implement programs may be weaker than that of local leaders.  
According to the World Bank, development assistance is vulnerable to manipulation or hijack by elites, independently of the form that the assistance may take, because such aid it requires governmental or private agency to ensure transfer to households. It is in this intermediary stage where instances of elite capture are most common. Be it centralized or decentralized government, there is a risk of ineffective public resource delivery involved, where part of the local population will receive more than the rest of the local population. This situation has welfare consequences. 

==Alternative solutions==
First, elite capture of public resources by local elites can be relatively lessened by the presence of media to balance the asymmetry of information. Empirical studies have shown that government responsiveness and accountability to ensure equal distribution of public goods and avoid elite capture is related to the availability of information and general levels of awareness among the local population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper |work=Working Paper No. 2010/82 |title=Elite Capture or Capture Elites? Lessons from the ‘Counter-elite’ and ‘Co-opt-elite’ Approaches in Bangladesh and Ghana |first=Sam |last=Wong |date=July 2010 |url=https://www.wider.unu.edu/sites/default/files/wp2010-82.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, the ‘counter-elite’ approach to deal with elite capture advocates challenging elites by completely excluding them in the implementation of projects. It assumes that all elites are inherently bad. By raising public awareness of power inequalities and building local capacity, this approach suggests that community empowerment and political citizenship would be effective in resisting elite domination. This approach is not necessarily effective in challenging elite domination, due to structural dependence of poor people on elites and the weakening of established institutions. Third, the ‘co-opt-elite’ approach suggests that cooperation with elites, rather than confrontation, is the solution to alleviating poverty. It asserts that not all elites are bad, and some of them can play a constructive role in community development. It also assumes a pragmatic use of elites’ networks and resources can benefit poor communities.  The ‘counter-elite’ approach is not necessarily effective in eroding elite power, and also risks legitimizing the authority of the elites and worsening inequality.

'''Similar Concepts'''
Elite capture and discrimination are very similar concepts because both imply unequal power status and denial of public resources. Social discrimination can promote elite capture, but is not an interchangable concept. Elite capture is based on a state of an unequal power relations, whereas discrimination may or may not be the cause of an unequal distribution of power. Elite capture is a changing and dynamic process, and power structures change with it when a new elite arises. Discrimination is rather static in this sense. Elite capture is a manifested form of corruption, and social discrimination is a manifestation of a set of beliefs in a society. 
Elite capture and state capture are also similar because they are both related to deviation of public resources for private benefits, but differ in how power is exercised. Elite capture is carried out by an elite that is legitimately entitled some level of de jure power. State capture is carried out by elites that exercise de facto power (e.g. powerful unions or big multinational companies) that aim to have influence on the decision making process of the institutions. However, both phenomena are both symptommatic of and a main reason for bad governance because they promote a vicious cycle, with long-term effects on institutional and bureaucratic performance.

==Examples==
 
An example of elite capture in the United States is to be found in the literature on the subject of iron triangles, wherein special interests are able to achieve disproportionately favorable outcomes from  congressional committees and federal regulators. Oftentimes, personnel between each side of the iron triangle is interchangeable, a revolving door dynamic which is favorable to the development of capture of regulators by the entities they are supposed to oversee. 
Also, examples are found in most developing countries, where an increasing proportion of government and foreign aid is distributed through community driven development but fail to properly reach the target population. 
Additional examples are male-dominated cultures where women may be disproportionately influenced by elite capture, since they tend to be excluded from the social elect and public services.
It is a phenomenon that may even take place even where there is no clear indicators of ‘capture’ of power or corruption like access to education in rural areas of developing countries. While there are primary schools in the villages, they are somewhat dysfunctional due to lack of maintenance. As a result, children have to go to neighboring villages to study. Usually girls are not sent far away from their villages, limiting their study years. Therefore, girls are systematically denied access to a public resource (education) as opposed to boys in the same village. 
The absence of an enabling social, political and economic environment can also encourage unintended elite capture. But at the same time, corruption and inefficiency appear to be a concomitant part of the elite capture problem.
Academic Approaches
As many other activities related to corruption, there has been very few systematic attempts to measure and identify causes and consequences of this phenomenon in economy. The concept itself is still in constant evolution because majority of evidence comes from non-experimental case studies or empirical data sets and there is very little consensus on the outcomes. 
A formal representation of the level of elite capture can be done by considering a single public service and how much does the elite capture changes the per-capita enjoyment of if it was equitably distributed. The idea is to consider how different the average consumption level of a certain public program would be if the average formal elites were eliminated. Empirical studies often analyze total welfare and utility function of a society. The idea is to identifying utility function of all households in three scenarios: current unequal distribution situation, with probability of equitable distributions and unavailability the public service or good to finally compare the data.

An '''entertainment robot''' is, as the name indicates, a robot that is not made for utilitarian use, as in production or domestic services, but for the sole subjective pleasure of the human. It serves, usually the owner or his housemates, guests or clients. Robotics technologies are applied in many areas of culture and entertainment.

Expensive robotics are applied to the creation of narrative environments in commercial venues where [[servo motors]], [[pneumatics]] and [[hydraulic]] actuators are used to create movement with often preprogrammed responsive behaviors such as in Disneyland's haunted house ride.

Entertainment robots can also be seen in the context of media arts where artist have been employing advanced technologies to create environments and artistic expression also utilizing the actuators and sensor to allow their robots to react and change in relation to viewers.

==Toy robot==
{{Category see also|Toy robots}}
Relatively cheap, mass-produced entertainment robots are used as mechanical, sometimes interactive, toys which perform various tasks and tricks on command. The first commercial hit was, not surprisingly, modelled on the most popular pet: the canine.

===Robotic dog===
{{further|Robot dog}}
Robot dogs as a fad have been produced with relatively little variation. These are some commercial models:
* ''Teksta'' a toy robot dog popular in the 1990s which was intended to be able to perform card tricks and respond to commands.
* ''[[Aibo]]'' (The [[Sony]] robot dog)
* ''[[Poo-Chi]]''
* ''Bo-wow''
* ''[[I-Cybie]]''
* ''[[iDog]]'' ([[Sega]]'s robot iPod music speaker)
* ''[[Gupi]]'', a robotic [[guinea pig]]
* ''Space Dog'', the remote control dog&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blog.retroplanet.com/the-history-of-toy-robots/|title=The History of Toy Robots|date=2009-07-15|work=Retro Planet|access-date=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robot dogs also appear fairly frequently in fiction compared to other forms of personal entertainment robots.
* ''[[K-9 (Doctor Who)|K-9]]'' [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|The Doctor]]'s portable computer and robot, from the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[BBC Television]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]''.
* ''Preston'' - Wendolene's robot dog from the 1995 animated [[Wallace and Gromit]] film ''[[A Close Shave]]''.
* ''Goddard'' pet of [[Jimmy Neutron]].

===Humanoid entertainment robots===
{{further|Humanoid robot}}
Despite those [[humanoid]] robots for utilitarian uses, there are some humanoid robots which aims at entertainment uses, such as [[Sony]]'s [[QRIO]] and [[Wow Wee]]'s [[RoboSapien]]. They are usually capable of some advanced features like Voice Recognition or Walking.

While primitive robot toy models only execute standardized pre-programmed routines, sometimes little more than a wind-up toy could do, advancing technology allows for interaction with the user and/or other environmental stimuli (e.g. sensor-detected obstacles), thus somewhat resembling a live playmate.

Nevertheless, in the mind of some users the things can hold the loved place of a pet, as demonstrated by the fact that some even sleep with a metallic one instead of a plush cuddly toy.

In fact manufacturers even found it pays to produce a toy that is essentially designed to be nurtured, rather like an egg in some 'parenting experience simulations', as proven by the success of the Japanese [[Tamagotchi]].

Entertainment robots can take the form of interactive communications marketing tools at trade shows wherein promotional robots move about a trade show floor providing tongue-in-cheek interaction with trade show attendees in order to bring said attendees to a particular companies trade show booth. These promotional robots are hired by companies to entertain the inform trade show attendees about products ad services available at trade shows, example www.entertainmentrobots.com rents trade show robots.

==Commercial show robots==
As usual in the entertainment industry, capital and creativity are invested to try and top anything the private person can afford. In fact, from their owner's point of view this is a professional use, but the product is designed with as end use in mind its appreciation by the public.

Thus expensive robots are made for use as:
*marketing tool - logically showed off by the manufacturers, to promote their products and technology, occasionally used in other promotional productions
*prop - inanimate performer or even artificial actor in show, TV and movie production (as the fictitious first toy robots, see above); as technology advances, some advanced robots can, often helped with other special effects, to make them seem what cannot (yet), even be significantly more than a cast extra, such as the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' double trilogy (1977-2005) which have proved rather popular from the start.

== Non-commercial art robots ==
In 1956, [[Nicolas Schöffer]] created ''Cysp 1 (Spatiodynamique Cybernétique)'', a robot and dancer working together to create an abstract sculpture and choreography with [[musique concrète|concrete music]] by [[Pierre Henry]]. These works could react to color, sound and light.

[[Survival Research Laboratories]], in San Francisco, California, creates large destructive robotic performances to [[roast (comedy)|roast]] contemporary culture and express their distaste for the [[military-industrial complex]].

[[Emergent Systems]] is creating large-scale interactive art environments where robots are able to respond to humans and each other as they react and evolve in the robotic installations. Autopoiesis was one such [[artificial life]] work that allowed a series of robots constructed of grapevines to both act as individuals and a group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060628201408/http://accad.osu.edu/~rinaldo/works/autopoiesis/autopoiesis.html|title=Ken Rinaldo; Autopoiesis is a group consciousness of interactive robotic sculptures - robotic art|date=2006-06-28|access-date=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Augmented Fish Reality allowed [[Siamese fighting fish]] to control their robots to meet across the gap of their glass fish bowls.

[[Intel Museum]] hosts the A.I. driven interactive robot, ARTI, which is short for "artificial intelligence". This robot is considered to be a work of fine art and is capable of recognizing faces, understands speech and even teaches the museum guests about the history of the museum and its founders, Robert Noyes and Gordon Moore. ARTI's face is made out of an inanimate silicon wafer.

The '''Florida Panhandle Shipwreck Trail''' features 12 [[shipwrecks]] including [[artificial reefs]] and a variety of sea life for diving, snorkeling and fishing offshore of Pensacola, Destin, Panama City and Port St. Joe, [[Florida]]. The "trail offers an adventurous opportunity for heritage, recreational, and ecological tourism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blair|first1=Kimberly|title=Florida Panhandle Shipwreck Trail beckons divers|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/2014/08/07/florida-panhandle-shipwreck-trail/13751693/|website=usatoday.com|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===USS ''Oriskany''===

City: Pensacola, Fla.
Claim to Fame: The largest artificial reef in the world, this wreck was named a Top 25 U.S. Dive Site in 2014 by Scuba Diving magazine.
Depth: 80–212 feet
Sink Date: May 17, 2006
Nicknamed the "Great Carrier Reef," the USS Oriskany, also known as the "Mighty O," was sunk after serving in the Pacific and earning battle stars for service in both the Korean and Vietnam Wars. Located 22 miles off the coast of Pensacola and submerged in more than 200 feet of water, this shipwreck offers exploration for divers of all skills and a myriad of pelagic and sedentary marine life.

===''YDT-14''===

City: Pensacola, Fla.
Claim to Fame: After years of training US Navy divers, this shipwreck is now a dive destination itself.
Depth: 90 feet
Sink Date: April 2000
Gulf storms have buried this diving tender to her decks, but the upper structure around 65 feet below sea level offers boundless exploration for divers.

===''San Pablo''===

City: Pensacola, Fla.
Claim to Fame: This ship is steeped in a history of foreign spies, espionage and secret military operations.
Depth: 80 feet
Sink Date: August 11, 1944
Launched from Belfast, Ireland, in 1915, San Pablo started her life as a fruit transport running bananas from Central America to the United States. Early during World War II she was sunk by a U-boat in Costa Rica and refloated. In August 1944 amid rampant rumors of foreign spies and espionage, San Pablo exploded off Pensacola's coast, hence her local name "Russian Freighter." Recently declassified documents reveal that San Pablo was actually destroyed in a top-secret U.S. military operation testing an experimental weapon system. American agents sank the freighter with a radio-controlled boat carrying over 3,000 lbs. of explosives. Her wreckage is scattered across the seafloor where divers can explore boilers, refrigeration coils and huge sections of twisted metal, all home to an impressive array of marine life.

===''Pete Tide II''===

City: Pensacola, Fla.
Claim to Fame: Three levels of decks offer boundless exploration in this upright underwater artificial reef.
Depth: 100 feet
Sink Date: 1993
An offshore oilfield supply vessel, this upright wreck boasts three levels of superstructure and an intact pilothouse making it home to mesmerizing schools of fish.

===Three Coal Barges===

City: Pensacola, Fla.
Claim to Fame: Shallow wreckage is ideal for beginning divers to practice.
Depth: 50 feet
Sink Date: 1974
Sunk in an emergency operation to avoid the barges running ashore, these three barges lie end-to-end in less than 50 feet of water, creating a thriving habitat for marine life and a shallow destination for diving and snorkeling.

===''Miss Louise''===

City: Destin, Fla.
Claim to Fame: Shallow waters make for an ideal dive training site.
Depth: 60 feet
Sink Date: 1997
A push tug, Miss Louise sits upright in 60 feet of water, brimming with marine life and serving as a great site for novice and intermediate divers.

===''Black Bart''===

City: Panama City Beach, Fla.
Claim to Fame: Appliances {including the ship's toilet} remain intact in the Head and Galley, offering unique exploration for divers.
Depth: 85 feet
Sink Date: 1993
Sunk in memory of Navy Supervisor of Salvage Captain Charles "Black Bart" Bartholomew, this oilfield supply vessel remains largely intact with its wheelhouse {40 foot depth}, deck {66 foot depth} and open cargo holds {80 foot depth}.

===''Fami Tugs''===

City: Panama City Beach, Fla.
Claim to Fame: Mother Nature rearranged this artificial reef, picking up one of the two tugs and situating it on top of the other for a most unusual diving experience.
Depth: 100 feet
Sink Date: 2003
Once resting bow-to-bow and joined by a 30-foot tether, a storm picked up one of the sunken tugs and placed it directly atop the other, allowing divers to enjoy two shipwrecks at once and serving as a reminder to visitors of the power of the sea.

===USS ''Accokeek''===

City: Panama City Beach, Fla.
Claim to Fame: With more than 50 years of service around the world, this tug led an exciting career above water before her final destination to the ocean floor.

After an impressive global run serving as a fleet tug, the USS Accokeek was repeatedly sunk and refloated for salvage and ordinance training at the Navy Dive School in Panama City, Fla.

===USS ''Strength''===

City: Panama City Beach, Fla.
Claim to Fame: Another testament to the swirls of the sea, this ship originally laid on her side at the ocean's floor before being righted by a hurricane in 1995.
Depth: 80 feet
Sink Date: May 19, 1987
A World War II minesweeper that survived a midget submarine attack and a kamikaze raid, the USS Strength offers divers a fascinating tour of a large artificial reef, including an impressive goliath grouper.

===USS ''Chippewa''===

City: Panama City Beach, Fla.
Claim to Fame: This tugboat is known for breaking speed records during her U.S. Navy tenure.
Depth: 100 feet
Sink Date: Feb. 8, 1990
Sunk as a Navy training platform for the Panama City Experimental Dive Unit in 1990, the USS Chippewa now sits upright on the bottom in 100 feet of water offering a great dive for spotting marine life.

===''Vamar''===

City: Port St. Joe, Fla.
Claim to Fame: Made famous as a support ship for Admiral Richard Byrd's 1928 Antarctic expedition, the Vamar sunk under mysterious circumstances.
Depth: 25 feet
Sink Date: March 21, 1942
Sunk under mysterious circumstances during a trip to carry lumber to Cuba in 1942, the Vamar now lies in just 25 feet of water, offering a large steam engine, bilge keels and a wide variety of marine life for divers and snorkelers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Florida Panhandle Shipwreck Trail Media Kit|url=http://www.floridapanhandledivetrail.com/media-kit.html|website=floridapanhandledivetrail.com|publisher=Florida Public Archaeology Network|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mardi Gras Shipwreck===

In May 2007, an expedition, led by [[Texas A&amp;M University]] and funded by the Okeanos Gas Gathering Company (OGGC) under an agreement with the Minerals Management Service (now [[BOEM]]), was launched to undertake the deepest scientific archaeological excavation ever attempted at that time to study a wreck site on the seafloor and recover artifacts for eventual public display in the [[Louisiana State Museum]]. The "Mardi Gras Shipwreck" sank some 200 years ago about 35 miles off the coast of [[Louisiana]] in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] in 4,000 feet (1220 meters) of water. The shipwreck, whose real identity remains a mystery, lay forgotten at the bottom of the sea until it was discovered in 2002 by an oilfield inspection crew working for the OGGC. As part of the educational outreach [[Nautilus Productions]] in partnership with [[BOEM]], Texas A&amp;M University, the Florida Public Archaeology Network&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FPAN Home|url=http://www.flpublicarchaeology.org/|website=Florida Public Archaeology}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Veolia Environmental produced a one-hour HD documentary&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mystery Mardi Gras Shipwreck|url=http://nautilusproductions.com/projects/mystery-mardi-gras-shipwreck-documentary|website=Nautilus Productions}}&lt;/ref&gt; about the project, short videos for public viewing and provided video updates during the expedition. The [[Center for Maritime Archaeology and Conservation]] was tasked with the conservation and analysis of the material recovered from the wreck site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Center for Maritime Archaeology and Conservation Mardi Gras Project|url=http://nautarch.tamu.edu/mardigras/|website=http://nautarch.tamu.edu|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''GSIS-Meralco case''' is a political controversy and pending legal case being heard by the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]]. This complex case began with a complaint filed by the Philippines' [[Government Service Insurance System (Philippines)|Government Service Insurance System]] (GSIS) with the [[Securities and Exchange Commission (Philippines)|Securities and Exchange Commission]] of the Philippines (SEC) questioning the unvalidated proxy votes used by the Lopez family in a board election of the [[Meralco|Manila Electric Company]] (Meralco). The SEC issued a [[Cease and desist|cease and desist order]] (CDO) against Meralco, which was ignored by the latter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2008/05/28/MAIN20080528125795.html ]{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[Order to show cause|show cause order]] (SCO) was then issued by the SEC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2008/may/29/yehey/top_stories/20080529top1.html |accessdate=August 27, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624020956/http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2008/may/29/yehey/top_stories/20080529top1.html |archivedate=June 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereupon Meralco petitioned the [[Court of Appeals of the Philippines|Court of Appeals]], questioning the jurisdiction of the SEC. The Court of Appeals issued a [[Injunction|temporary restraining order]] (TRO) to the SEC&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2008/05/31/MAIN20080531126120.html ]{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Special 9th Division composed of Associate Justices Vicente Q. Roxas, Jose L. Sabio Jr. and Myrna Dimaranan Vidal heard the case. Roxas was assigned as the ponente while Sabio was the acting chairman.

Later, Sabio called a press conference and alleged that an [[Ambassador|emissary]] of Meralco tried to bribe him with [[Philippine peso|₱]]10 million to have a case transferred to another appeals court justice. The criminal charges are [[obstruction of justice]] and [[malfeasance in office]].&lt;ref name="yahoo1"&gt;[http://ph.news.yahoo.com/gma/20080801/tph-senate-won-t-probe-bribe-try-on-ca-j-d6cd5cf.html ph.news.yahoo.com, Senate won't probe bribe try on CA justice]{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sabio did not mention any names, but businessman Francis de Borja stepped forward and claimed that he was the alleged emissary, accusing Sabio of asking for a ₱50 million bribe to side with Meralco, in response to De Borja's question “What will it take for you to resist the government’s offer?” The alleged government offer was a Supreme Court position. In the latter course of the investigation, Sabio let slip that his brother, [[Presidential Commission on Good Government]] (PCGG) Chairman [[Camilo Sabio]], called him up twice to urge him to side favorably with the government. The late admission of the allegedly unethical and criminal action called into doubt the innocence of Sabio in coming forward with his expose and the veracity of his entire story. These acts are alleged to be punishable under Article 208 and 243 of the Revised Penal Code respectively.&lt;ref name="opinion.inquirer.net"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/inquireropinion/editorial/view/20080813-154255/The-original-sin |title=The original sin - INQUIRER.net, Philippine News for Filipinos |publisher=Opinion.inquirer.net |date=2008-08-13 |accessdate=2012-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215205124/http://opinion.inquirer.net/inquireropinion/editorial/view/20080813-154255/The-original-sin |archive-date=2012-02-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newsbreak.com.ph"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsbreak.com.ph/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=5256&amp;Itemid=88889051 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930060246/http://newsbreak.com.ph/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=5256&amp;Itemid=88889051 |archivedate=2011-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also came out during the course of the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] investigation that Court of Appeals Justice Vicente Roxas, the ponente of the controversial Meralco decision, had himself committed improprieties. One such impropriety was that Roxas preempted the legal opinion of Presiding Justice [[Conrado M. Vasquez|Conrado Vasquez]] that the Special 9th Division should have ruled on the case as per the Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals (IRCA), and not the 8th Division to which Roxas was transferred, and which eventually promulgated a ruling in favor of Meralco, with Justices Reyes and Apolinario Bruselas hastily signing the ponencia without going over or reading the memoranda submitted by concerned parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2008/aug/14/yehey/top_stories/20080814top2.html |accessdate=August 27, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080817121137/http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2008/aug/14/yehey/top_stories/20080814top2.html |archivedate=August 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court, voting 12–1, ordered the dismissal of Roxas after he was found guilty of multiple violations of the canons of the Code of Judicial Conduct, grave misconduct, dishonesty, undue interest and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080909-159535/5-CA-justices-committed-lapses--SC-probers-report |title=SC dismisses CA justice in bribery case - INQUIRER.net, Philippine News for Filipinos |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |accessdate=2012-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609211112/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080909-159535/5-CA-justices-committed-lapses--SC-probers-report |archive-date=2012-06-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sabio was suspended for two months after he was found guilty of simple misconduct and conduct unbecoming of a justice of the CA. Vasquez was severely reprimanded “for his failure to act promptly and decisively in order to avert the incidence that damaged the image of the Court of Appeals,” Reyes was found guilty of simple misconduct with mitigating circumstance, and Vidal was found guilty of conduct unbecoming of a justice of the appellate court for being “too compliant" when she allowed herself to sign the decision without reading the parties’ memorandum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ph.news.yahoo.com/gma/20080909/tph-ca-justice-sacked-4-others-chastised-d6cd5cf.html ]{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It started on May 11, 2008, when the Philippines' [[Government Service Insurance System (Philippines)|Government Service Insurance System]] (GSIS) accused [[Meralco]] of unlawful refusal to grant corporate access to documents despite the GSIS’ holding 4 seats in the 11-member Meralco board, amid GSIS' denial of plans to wrest control from the Lopez family.

The scandal originated from the Meralco and GSIS row after Sabio—in a letter-complaint against Justices Vicente Roxas and Bienvenido Reyes—complained of the circumstances that he was removed from the Meralco-GSIS case after a standard court reorganization, and an alleged bribe attempt by Manolo Lopez and Meralco in consideration for him giving way to Reyes' chairmanship of the CA's Special 9th Division&lt;ref name="tradingmarkets.com"&gt;[http://www.tradingmarkets.com/.site/news/Stock%20News/1783818/ tradingmarkets.com, CA junks SEC's cease-and-desist order on Meralco even as GSIS scores ruling]{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It catches nationwide attention when businessman Francis De Borja surfaces and accuses Sabio via sworn affidavit that the justice had asked for P50 million to back away from the case, to counter a government offer of money and a Supreme Court appointment in exchange for a ruling favorable to GSIS.

===Background===
In 1962, Don Eugenio López, Sr. acquired MERALCO and it finally became Filipino-owned, but [[Ferdinand Marcos]], by decree,  placed it under a [[shell company]] called the [[Meralco Foundation, Inc.]], controlled by crony under government controlled [[National Power Corporation|Napocor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meralco.com.ph/ |title=Meralco website |publisher=Meralco.com.ph |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, Meralco was fully controlled by the Marcos administration, but its ownership was finally returned to the Lopez family after the [[People Power Revolution]] by President [[Corazon Aquino]]. By [[Statutory Instrument|executive order]], she allowed Meralco to directly compete with NAPOCOR.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bello|first=Walden|author2=Marissa De Guzman |author3=Mary Lou Malig |author4=Herbert Docena |title=The Anti-development State: The Political Economy of Permanent Crisis in the Philippines|publisher=Zed Books|year=2005|page=293|isbn=1-84277-631-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3S0ukwMn8LoC&amp;pg=PA293&amp;dq=meralco+world+war&amp;lr=&amp;sig=TPqoP76Kr7z-FhRVj8ROjJptJhE|accessdate=2008-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] on May 2, 2008, announced plans to reduce [[Luzon]] high power rates, amid  a “tough legal fight” with Meralco before state energy regulators. Accordingly, GSIS, through its President Winston Garcia, on May 11, stated it "planned not only to buy out the Lopez family and other shareholders in Meralco but also to break up its concession to promote efficiency and transparency." But Meralco chair and CEO Manuel Lopez said he was not selling the utility.

===The cases and facts===
Oscar Lopez blamed the Arroyo administration's moves to take over Meralco in a “reverse privatization,” because of the Lopez-owned [[ABS-CBN]]'s negative publicity against the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20080731-151744/Timeline-GSIS-Meralco-controversy |title=inquirer.net, Timeline: GSIS-Meralco controversy |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |accessdate=2012-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080823085218/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20080731-151744/Timeline-GSIS-Meralco-controversy |archivedate=2008-08-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====May 27 stockholders’ meeting====
During the May 27, 2008 stockholders’ meeting, GSIS' President Winston Garcia obtained an SEC “cease-and-desist order” to stop and defer the counting of proxy votes held by the Lopez group until questions on its validity were resolved. GSIS accused the Lopezes of “rigging” the process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribune.net.ph/headlines/20080803hed1.html tribune.net.ph Explain root of scandal, GSIS chief asks two justices SC urged to focus on ‘case switching’ 08/03/2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807023618/http://www.tribune.net.ph/headlines/20080803hed1.html |date=August 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; GSIS failed to gain control of Meralco after a TRO from the Court of Appeals is issued, and the SEC order placed on hold. Meralco retained its 5 seats, the government its 4, while the 2 others are independent directors [[Artemio Panganiban]] and Vicente Panlilio. Aside from Manuel Lopez, the Meralco directors elected are Jesus Francisco, Felipe Alfonso, Christian Monsod and [[Cesar Virata]], while the government board members elected aside from Garcia, are Bernardino Abes, Daisy Arce and Jeremy Parulan.

On May 30, the said [[temporary restraining order]] from the [[Philippine Court of Appeals]], against the SEC order from the 9th division, composed of Justices Roxas and Vidal was released. They are joined by substitute Justice Jose Sabio, replacement for Justice Bienvenido Reyes who was on leave. Despite the return of Justice Reyes in time from his leave, and his trying to claiming back his post, Sabio refused to give up the position. The TRO is released with Sabio signing instead.&lt;ref name="abs-cbnnews.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storyPage.aspx?storyId=127392 |title=ABS-CBNNews.com &amp;#124; ABS-CBN News &amp;#124; Latest Philippine Headlines, Breaking News, Video, Analysis, Features |publisher=ABS-CBN News |accessdate=2012-02-19 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Senior Associate Justice Rodrigo Cosico retires, and the Court of Appeals undergoes a mandatory reorganization. Following court rules, the case followed the Justice-writer assigned to it, Justice Vicente Roxas. The case moved to the 8th division, composed of Justice Reyes, Roxas, and Bruselas.

The Court's 8th Division renders a 57-page [[judgment (law)|judgment]] authored by Justice Vicente Roxas on July 24 against the GSIS, affirming Meralco's stance that the SEC has no jurisdiction over the issue.&lt;ref name="tradingmarkets.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://www.tradingmarkets.com/.site/news/Stock%20News/1800093/ tradingmarkets.com, CA en banc refers case of warring justices in controversial Meralco ruling to SC]{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large scale negative media blitz is launched by unknown persons against the author of the decision Justice Roxas.

Justice Myrna Dimaranan-Vidal, together with Justice Jose Sabio, former special 9th Division members, challenged the decision, per letter to CA Presiding Justice Conrado Vasquez Jr., thus: "How can the 8th Division issue an order when it is the 9th that has been hearing the complaint of alleged irregularities in the Meralco election?" It is also the 9th Division that issued the temporary restraining order on the SEC order to Meralco on May 30."

Assistant Clerk of Court, lawyer Manuel Cervantes, said no irregularity had been committed when the 8th division came out with the decision instead of the 9th, simply a result of the reorganization of the court. "The case goes with the ''ponente''(justice assigned to pen the case),” Cervantes explained.  “Justice Vicente Roxas is the ponente. Even with the change in division, the case stays with him." “Due to the retirement of some justices, Justice Vidal was reassigned to the 6th Division while Reyes became chair of the 8th,” Cervantes said. Roxas was moved to the 8th division, Vidal went to the 6th, and Sabio to the 9th.  And since the rule is that the case goes with the ponente,the 57-page decision was issued by the division of which Justice Roxas was now a part, he said.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ph.news.yahoo.com/star/20080804/tph-confidence-crisis-ca-b4b2a3e.html ]{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Permission is not required from the previous division nor its justices.

He said the IRCA (Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals) does not require the justices who issued the TRO be the same justices to render the decision.

The Court of Appeals Reorganization Office Order No. 200-08-CMV was issued by Presiding Justice Vasquez on July 4, three weeks before the decision was released.

Justice Jose Sabio refuses to let go of the Meralco GSIS case, and insists on being a part of the division to decide the case. He submits the case to the internal rules committee of the court, headed by Justice Edgardo P. Cruz. The Court of Appeals committee decides as early as June 20 that the committee, which clarifies internal rules of the court, rejects Justice Sabio's argument that the pending case should go with him following a court reorganization. By the rules, the division headed by Justice Bienvenido L. Reyes should hear the leadership row at Meralco. Sabio disregards Cruz's recommendation on the basis he was only a "junior justice".&lt;ref name="abs-cbnnews.com"/&gt;

On July 26, Justice Sabio, with the encouragement of  Justice Vidal (his colleague in the 9th Special Division) broke a bribery attempt news and wrote to P.J. Vasquez, Jr.  .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20080731-151737/Full-text-of-Sabio-letter-to-Vasquez |title=Full text of Sabio letter to Vasquez July 26, 2008 |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |accessdate=2012-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604000544/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20080731-151737/Full-text-of-Sabio-letter-to-Vasquez |archive-date=2012-06-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined Justice Vidal, initiating further, a media expose of their squabbles, alleging something “stinks” in the Meralco court ruling. Presiding Justice Vasquez released his opinion, also, per his July 24, 2008 Letter to Justices Bienvenido L. Reyes &amp; Vicente Q. Roxas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/images/news/newspics/downloads/CAdocs.pdf July 24, 2008 Letter of P.J. Conrado Vasquez, Jr. to Justices Bienvenido L. Reyes &amp; Vicente Q.

Businessman Francis de Borja emerges and reveals to the media a notarized and sworn affidavit that it was Justice Sabio who brought up a P50 million price for him to act in favor of Meralco in its dispute with the GSIS. Mr. de Borja asserts that Mr. Sabio had told him a Supreme Court seat was being offered in exchange for a ruling in favor of the GSIS, which is trying to wrest control of Meralco from the Lopezes. Expecting Sabio to answer that he would not be swayed by any offer and would rule according to his conscience, De Borja asked what it would take for him to resist the supposed government offer of a seat on the Supreme Court and money. He was taken aback when Sabio replied "P50 million”, and then left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080801-152102/De-Borja-insists-Sabio-cited-P50-M-figure |title=De Borja insists Sabio cited P50-M figure - INQUIRER.net, Philippine News for Filipinos |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |date=2010-06-09 |accessdate=2012-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604000555/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080801-152102/De-Borja-insists-Sabio-cited-P50-M-figure |archive-date=2012-06-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Presiding Justice Conrado Vasquez comes under fire in the newspapers. Vasquez is criticized of having been able to spare the Court this trouble on the court's integrity had he followed the recommendation of the rules committee. With Vasquez's opinion favoring Sabio despite the reorganization, and the lack of a preliminary injunction that would exempt Meralco from being transferred to Reyes's and Roxas's division, doubt is cast on Vasquez's motivations.&lt;ref name="abs-cbnnews.com"/&gt;

Manolo Lopez calls the accusations of Sabio a malicious and a pure fabrication. He vehemently denied the allegations, especially Sabio's accusation that he (Lopez) was waiting in the car during the meeting. He said he was out of the country for a medical check-up when the incident supposedly happened, and returned only last July 13. As proof, he showed tickets showing his departure dated June 27 and his arrival dated July 13.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bworldonline.com/BW080208/content.php?id=041&amp;src=2 ]{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The panel investigation finds out that Chairman Camilo Sabio of the Presidential Commission on Good Government(PCGG) called up his brother, Justice Jose Sabio Jr. twice. The first time on May 30, to lobby his brother to adopt the position of the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) versus Manila Electric Co. (Meralco). This was hours before the Ninth Division of the Court of Appeals (temporarily headed by Sabio) issued a temporary restraining order in Meralco's favor. Camilo called up Jose at 8 a.m., when the court's practice is to hand down its decisions at 10 a.m. Then, after the Court of Appeals decided the case with finality on July 23, Camilo called up Jose again, asking why he hadn’t signed the decision.

When Camilo called the first time, he informed Jose that he was going to be the acting chairman of the Special Ninth Division of the court; and that furthermore, a TRO against the Securities and Exchange Commission order that the GSIS desired was being prepared. Camilo suggested to Jose that the latter shouldn’t sign the TRO. When Camilo called once more, it was to ask why the 8th Division, and not the Special 9th Division had decided. Justice Jose had lobbied strenuously to head the 8th even after Justice Bienvenido Reyes, the person he was substituting for, was back on the job.

Retired Supreme Court Justice Romeo Callejo Sr., one of those conducting the investigation, castigated Justice Sabio why he didn’t bring up the intervention of his brother previously—or reprimand his brother. “Why did you not report your brother’s attempt to influence you? That was unethical. You did nothing; you are a professor of ethics. Did you not consider that your brother’s attempt was criminal?” Callejo asked.

Sabio's replies alternated between the irrelevant (his brother was older than he, he said) to patent hair-splitting (there was no outright offer of a bribe from his brother). They only reduced the reasonable doubt so far supporting Sabio by reducing the options the justice operated under to three: he was hopelessly naïve; he has been too clever for his own good; or he is a bumbling prisoner of circumstance, who has blown the lid off a legal system so thoroughly tainted it cannot absolve itself the longer the inquiry continues.

This called into question Justice Sabio's squabble with fellow Reyes over who should have jurisdiction over the case. It explained why Justice Sabio would, in turn, on July 1, meet lawyer Francis de Borja to discuss a case he had every reason to know would be brought up by a party friendly to Meralco. It's either that the Ateneo de Manila Law School's professor of legal ethics had no comprehension of the subject he teaches or he is a plain and simple hypocrite. He brags about his being a righteous professor of legal ethics which we can never believe now after knowing from the investigation his lapses to perform what is expected of a member of the court.

This provided circumstantial evidence for concluding that Sabio was playing off both sides to see who might bid highest, confirming, incidentally, many details in De Borja's affidavit while calling into question the completeness, and ultimately the veracity, of Sabio's own statements.

Justice Sabio move to come forward to virtuously blow the whistle is cast in doubt by his selectivity. He denied allegations of Palace blandishments to do the GSIS’ bidding, but he left out his brother's intervention. He is looking more and more like a double-dealer who got a juicy Palace offer but tried to cash in quickly by basically making it obvious to the other side he would be open to a counteroffer.
&lt;ref name="opinion.inquirer.net"/&gt;

As a government official, Camilo's act of calling his brother to influence his decision is punishable under Article 243 of the Revised Penal Code. Article 243 (orders or requests by executive offices to any judicial authority) states that :"Any executive officer who shall address any order or suggestion to any judicial authority with respect to any case or business coming within the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of justice shall suffer the penalty of arresto mayor and a fine."

As an official of the Court, Justice Sabio is mandated under Article 208 of the Revised Penal Code to report any possible violation of the law, with negligence and tolerance as the offending act. Article 208 states: “The penalty of prison correctional in its minimum period (six months and 1 day to 2 years and four months) and suspension shall be imposed upon any public officer or officer of the law who, in dereliction of the duties of his office, shall maliciously refrain from instituting prosecution for the punishment of violations of the law, or shall tolerate the commission of offenses.” &lt;ref name="newsbreak.com.ph"/&gt; The public is in anticipation whether criminal charges for bribery and violation of Article 208 of the RPC will be filed against Sabio the soonest possible time to determine the extent of his culpability.

====Application to this case====
Justice Sabio informed Philippine media that he was offered P 10 million (through a Makati businessman, which he rejected) to recuse himself from the GSIS-Meralco case, which was decided by the 8th Division's Justice Vicente Roxas, the designated ponente, with the concurring opinions of Justices Bienvenido Reyes and Antonio Bruselas. Roxas was transferred from the 9th Division, when the case was pending. Sabio revealed to media that: “It turned out that he was brokering for Meralco.” Sabio appeared on a TV interview by [[GMA Network]] reporter Carlo Lorenzo in his chambers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/video/26500/QTV-CA-justice-says-decision-on-Meralco-GSIS-row-railroaded |title=QTV: gmanews.tv, CA justice says decision on Meralco-GSIS row railroaded, 07/31/2008 |publisher=Gmanews.tv |date=2008-07-31 |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cagayan de Oro City]] businessman Francis Roa de Borja, in his July 31, 2008 [[affidavit]], swore that: "when he asked what it would take for him to resist the government offer, Sabio's reply was: “Fifty million (pesos)"; Sabio wanted to remain as acting chairman of the 9th Division because he was up to something; that Sabio consulted his other colleagues in the CA and they told him that he was in the right and should stick to his guns; that was then Sabio told Borja about the offer of unnamed government officials for a promotion at the SC and money for a favorable ruling for GSIS."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/largevideo/home/26537/-QTV---CDO-Businessman-Justice-Sabio-named-his-price-to-favor-GSIS-over-Meralco |title=QTV: gmanews.tv/largevideo, CDO Businessman: Justice Sabio named his price to favor GSIS over Meralco |publisher=Gmanews.tv |date=2008-07-31 |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/110682/Businessman-turns-tables-on-CA-justice-over-alleged-Meralco-bribe |title=gmanews.tv/story, Businessman turns tables on CA justice over alleged Meralco bribe |publisher=Gmanews.tv |date=2008-07-31 |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Borja accused Sabio of twisting the facts: "No, I never said that. If you know Manolo Lopez -- he is somewhat aristocratic -- he would be the last person to wait for somebody in the car, and they did not know that he was abroad at that time. I said in my affidavit that he told me his wife would be waiting for him in the car and he says now that Manolo was waiting in my car..."

De Borja stated that he was ready to face charge of [[perjury]] and to take a lie detector test with Sabio before competent foreign experts and together: "It’s a free county, let him file it and we’ll see. I’m prepared, the moment I signed my affidavit obviously I considered the consequences so I wouldn’t have made up a story. And my third comment is he is a lawyer and a justice. He knows that a lie detector test is not admissible as evidence so why is he asking for it?’’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080801-152102/De-Borja-insists-Sabio-cited-P50-M-figure |title=inquirer.net, De Borja insists Sabio cited P50-M figure |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |accessdate=2012-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604000555/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080801-152102/De-Borja-insists-Sabio-cited-P50-M-figure |archive-date=2012-06-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; De Borja was interviewed and appeared at [[ABS-CBN]] News Channel's ([[ABS-CBN News Channel|ANC]]) Dateline Philippines, and he repeated his media statements: "No definitely not...He [Sabio] says that Manolo was waiting for me in my car. I never said it. And if you know Manolo...Can you imagine somebody like Manolo being made to wait in a car? Di ba, yung pagka aristocratic ni Manolo, maghihintay sa kotse?

Meanwhile, a shadowy group, "Tanglaw ng Bayan," paid an advertisement on a [[Metro Manila]] newspaper, appealing "that the CA justices not be subjected to malicious imputations just to advance the agenda of powerful interests, and to allow the CA to "sort out its internal issues." In 2007, it also petitioned the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and the Senate to probe the [[Hello Pappy scandal|"Hello Pappy" scandal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/110534/CA-justice-mum-on-identity-of-broker-in-GSIS-Meralco-row |title=gmanews.tv/story, CA justice mum on identity of ‘broker’ in GSIS-Meralco row |publisher=Gmanews.tv |date=2008-07-31 |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 31, 2008, after a rare 3-hour, closed-door [[En Banc]] session attended by 64 CA Justices presided by P.J. Vasquez, Jr., the CA Clerk of Court Teresita Marigomen announced the [[appellate court]]'s resolution:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/?page=news2_july31_2008 |title=manilastandardtoday.com, 65 justices to review ‘fishy’ Meralco order |publisher=Manilastandardtoday.com |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "that they will refer the investigation of the propriety of action of concerned justices to the Supreme Court through the Office of the Court Administrator";
* "they will leave the matter on the validity of the Meralco decision to the parties, to take whatever steps they may deem necessary after all the allegations"; and,
* "they will refer the issue of the conflict on rules to an internal committee within the appellate court."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080731-151800/UPDATE-2-CA-seeks-SC-probe-over-P10-M-bribe-try |title=inquirer.net, SC to probe conflict, bribery attempt in CA on Meralco case |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |date=2008-07-31 |accessdate=2012-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604000610/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080731-151800/UPDATE-2-CA-seeks-SC-probe-over-P10-M-bribe-try |archive-date=2012-06-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chief Justice [[Reynato Puno]] ordered all records of case be delivered forthwith to the high court, and the Supreme Court Public Information Office OIC said all magistrates of the high court would deliberate on the case on August 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/110989/SC-to-investigate-bribery-issue |title=gmanews.tv, SC to investigate bribery issue |publisher=Gmanews.tv |date=2008-08-02 |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice Roxas challenged the En Banc meeting as a “disguised investigation” of the 8th Division's judgment on the Meralco case, further alleging that under the Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals, a case followed the ponente to whatever division the ponente went: “Besides, all hearings in the Court of Appeals are recorded and the members of the 8th Division only need the transcripts of the hearing or the memoranda, briefs, comments and replies of the parties—which are all written.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080731-151732/Justice-bares-P10-M-bribe |title=inquirer.net, Justice bares P10-M bribe, Sabio tags emissary of Meralco |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |date=2008-07-31 |accessdate=2012-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604000637/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080731-151732/Justice-bares-P10-M-bribe |archive-date=2012-06-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sabio's former client (1978), Evelyn Clavano, a [[Cagayan de Oro City]] resident, gave media, on August 1, an [[affidavit]] saying that: "Francis de Borja requested me if I have the [[cell phone]] number of Justice Jose L. Sabio Jr. He related that because he is very close to the Lopezes of Meralco, he wanted to call him (Sabio) regarding his possible inhibition in a certain Meralco case, wherein he was designated as a substitute member of the division vice a justice who was temporarily on-leave by reason of sickness. He further said that the Lopezes desire that the same Justice, with whom the Lopezes are more comfortable, to sit in the division. So, I gave Francis de Borja the cell phone number of Justice Jose L.

[[Meralco]] chair Manolo lopez, in a press conference on August 2, denied any involvement in the alleged bribery attempt: “I categorically and vehemently deny the allegations of Justice Jose Sabio. Mind you, I do not have the habit of waiting in the car for anybody except my wife. The [allegations are] malicious and pure fabrication. I am a resident of [[Rockwell Center]]. I know Francis but I have not authorized him or anybody to make representations for [me on] any matter that involves cases of Meralco and the Lopez family. We have retainers and lawyers to handle legal matters.I was out of the country when the alleged meeting between Francis and Justice Sabio took place. I was in the [[United States]] for a medical check up and returned on July 13." Lopez's officials showed media, tickets of his departure, June 27, and his arrival, July 13.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2008/aug/02/yehey/top_stories/20080802top2.html manilatimes.net, Manolo lopez says Sabio’s charges a fabrication] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080805090132/http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2008/aug/02/yehey/top_stories/20080802top2.html |date=August 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====CA chambers press conference=====
Sabio, on August 1, First Friday, held a press conference in his CA [hambers, and stated to media: {{cquote|...I expect matters to get worse because I am up against the billions of the Lopezes. But that Mr. de Borja would have the nerve to make these lies, under oath, is utterly disgusting when it was he who came to me with the offer of the bribe. He [de Borja] further said that the Lopezes desire that the same justice, with whom the Lopezes are more comfortable, sit in the division. Mr. de Borja called me, so suddenly, and after having had no contact [with him] for almost a year. At that point, he [de Borja] mentioned the impasse between Justice Bienvenido Reyes and myself. Then he [de Borja] explained that he was there to offer me a win-win situation. He said, Justice, we have P10 million. At that point, I was shocked that he had a very low regard for me. He was treating me like there was a price on my person. I could not describe my feelings. I was stunned. I cannot in conscience agree to that [offer to bribe me]. The Lopezes will do everything possible using their money and power to discredit me. This is just the beginning.

against [[Meralco]]. The [[certiorari]] and [[injunction]] CA [[lawsuit]] was raffled off to the CA's 9th Division chaired by Justice Bienvenido Reyes (on leave at the time). A special raffle designated Reyes’ replacement,  Justice Jose Sabio (as chair). With Justices Vicente Roxas and Myrna Vidal as members, the 9th Division heard the case. (The GSIS moved to recuse Roxas on account of reports that "he met with Meralco lawyers on the day a temporary restraining order [TRO] was issued by the CA, barring the SEC from taking jurisdiction over the GSIS complaint against Meralco.")

Sabio's chairmanship issue with Reyes over the Special Ninth Division was overtaken by a July 4, 2008, reorganization at the Court of Appeals. Reyes and Roxas ended up in the 8th Division, which finally resolved the case in favor of the Lopez group on July 23. Sabio was reassigned as chairman of the 6th Division. Sabio later complained that Roxas penned the decision even before either side had submitted their arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/?page=news1_aug2_2008 |title=Sabio, Lopez friend trade ‘lies’ on live TV |publisher=Manilastandardtoday.com |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice Reyes failed to assume the chairmanship of the 9th Division in place of Sabio, and the CA's 8th Division, chaired by Reyes and with ponente, Justices Roxas and Apolinario Bruselas as members, forthwith promulgated the challenged [[judgment (law)|judgment]] in favor of Meralco. GSIS called the ruling, a “patent nullity for such dismissal [of the GSIS case before the SEC] was not even prayed for by Meralco in its petition with the Court of Appeals.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2008/july/31/yehey/opinion/20080731opi7.html manilatimes.net, FROM THE SIDELINES A court jurisdictional issue] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013031434/http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2008/july/31/yehey/opinion/20080731opi7.html |date=October 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

P.J. Vasquez wrote Justices Sabio and Vidal that as members of their newly reconstituted 8th division, they are not very familiar with the case. Vasquez earlier granted Sabio a verbal go-signal to proceed in hearing the June 23 [[oral argument]]. Vasquez reiterated that "Sabio’s 9th division, since it issued a temporary restraining order (TRO), and its members heard and participated in the June 23 hearing, should “sign and resolve” the case. To allow the new division of Justice B.L. Reyes as Chairman, Justice Roxas, as ponente, and Justice Bruselas, Jr. as the third member, the resolution of the pending incidents in the case will be participated by two (2) members who were not present and did not hear the arguments during the hearing on the injunctive relief...”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=126888 abs-cbnnews.com, CA head decides for Sabio in rift on Meralco case] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryID=126887 abs-cbnnews.com, Meralco legal war causes dissent among CA justices] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Grino aquino.jpg|180px|thumb|right|Justice [[Carolina Grino-Aquino]], Chair of the Bribery Panel.]]

GSIS, on August 13, 2008, in 65-page [[certiorari]] petition, asked the Supreme Court to nullify the CA judgment that prevented the SEC from case intervention, "considering the SC probe is still ongoing." It argued that the Special 9th Division should have ruled on the case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=128180 abs-cbnnews.com, GSIS asks Supreme Court to reverse CA on Meralco ruling] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joker Arroyo]] criticized the High Court's ruling, saying it should be, as sitting Justices investigate the case instead, since: "Delegating the investigation to a panel of retired justices who in turn will submit their findings to the high court for review and determination [is] akin to a trial by commissioners."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080805-152791/SC-not-retired-justices-should-hear-CA-bribery-case |title=inquirer.net/breakingnews, ‘SC, not retired justices, should hear CA bribery case’ |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |accessdate=2012-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607001539/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080805-152791/SC-not-retired-justices-should-hear-CA-bribery-case |archive-date=2012-06-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

But (49%) stated that a judges received bribes, just 8% of lawyers admitted  they reported the bribery, because they could not prove it.

====CA controversies====
Created on February 1, 1936, the [[Philippine Court of Appeals]] was initially composed of Justice Pedro Concepcion as the first Presiding Judge and 10 Appellate Judges appointed by the [[President of the Philippines|President]] with the consent of the [[Commission on Appointments (Philippines)|Commission on Appointments]] of the National Assembly. In March 1938, the appellate Judges were named Justices and their number increased from 11 to 15, with 3 divisions of  5 under Commonwealth Act No. 259. On December 24, 1941, there were 19 Justices under Executive Order No. 395. On February 23, 1995, R.A. No. 7902 expanding the jurisdiction of the Court effective March 18, 1995. On December 30, 1996, R.A. No. 8246 created six (6) more divisions in the Court, thereby increasing its membership from 51 to 69 Justices (additional divisions - 3 for [[Visayas]] and 3 for [[Mindanao]], the court's regionalization).

The [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] on March 21, 2008, upon recommendation of the investigator, [[Bernardo P. Pardo]], dismissed [[Philippine Court of Appeals]] Justice Elvi John Asuncion for gross ignorance of the law and delaying motions of considerations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elibrary.supremecourt.gov.ph/decisions.php?doctype=Decisions%20/%20Signed%20Resolutions&amp;docid=a45475a11ec72b843d74959b60fd7bd6460c2cfb6cf5e#sam elibrary.supremecourt.gov.ph, Decision, CA Justice J Elvi Asuncion]{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Asuncion was charged of receiving money placed in “2 gym bags delivered to his office.” The Supreme Court, however, found no substantial evidence of [[bribery]], but it dismissed him for gross ignorance of the law for his issuance of an October 30, 2001, resolution in the case between Philippine National Bank, the National Labor Relations Commission and Erlinda Archinas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=127279 abs-cbnnews.com, SC dismissed CA justices in the past] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was only the 2nd Court of Appeals [[jurist]] to be dismissed, since the first firing in Philippine judicial history of CA Justice Demetrio G.

The CA, thereafter became the center of controversy after Chief Justice [[Reynato Puno]] ordered an investigation of the so-called "Dirty Dozen," particularly on the alleged “sale” of "Temporary Restraining Orders" ([[Injunction]], [[Restraining order abuse]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2007/mar/21/yehey/top_stories/20070321top1.html manilatimes.net/national, Court of Appeals justice dismissed] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070329010745/http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2007/mar/21/yehey/top_stories/20070321top1.html |date=March 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 18, 2007, Briccio Joseph Boholst, president of IBP — Cebu City Chapter, opposed the abolition of the CA in Cebu City, for it will cause inconvenience for both litigants and lawyers. Supreme Court Associate Justice [[Ruben Reyes]] was tasked to investigate and submit recommendation to the High Tribunal because of the alleged massive graft and corruption of justices, especially in the issuance of temporary restraining orders (TRO's).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mb.com.ph/PROV20070819100756.html Manila Bulletin, IBP Cebu City opposes abolition of CA Cebu] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 3, 2007, [[Philippine Court of Appeals]] Presiding Justice [[Ruben Reyes]] (now S.C. Justice) ordered an investigation and a regular auditing and inventory of temporary restraining orders (TROs) issued by the 69 CA Justices. Reyes stated: “I will order a monthly or quarterly inventory of TROs, for transparency and to watch the movements of the so-called Dirty Dozen [the 12 most corrupt CA justices].”  [[Reynato Puno]] said that [[Ombudsman]] Merceditas Gutierrez had not yet submitted the list and the Supreme Court was waiting for its delivery amid her formal investigation against the “Dirty Dozen.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2007/apr/03/yehey/top_stories/20070403top5.html manilatimes.net, CA acts against Dirty 12, lamppost accused] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013021415/http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2007/apr/03/yehey/top_stories/20070403top5.html |date=October 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
*Government Service Insurance System chief Garcia, on July 31, 2008, asked Justices Vicente Roxas and Bienvenido Reyes to resign and save the CA institution amid  plans to file criminal and administrative [[lawsuit]]s. Garcia accused both Justices as “Meralco switcheroo" in the case against GSIS: “The sordid details of Meralco’s behind-the-scene maneuverings as narrated by Justice Sabio merely put in public display the contempt the Lopezes have for the law. Lady Justice lies bleeding on the ground, and those who have bloods in their hands must be made to answer for this dastardly crime! I call on all Filipinos, especially my colleagues in the noble practice of law, to rise up in unison to condemn these moves by Meralco to protect its interest at the expense of what is right and just."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/110668/P10-M-bribe-try-GSIS-chief-urges-2-CA-justices-to-resign%20P10-M%20bribe%20try: |title=gmanews.tv, GSIS chief urges 2 CA justices to resign |publisher=Gmanews.tv |date=2008-07-31 |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The entire judiciary's reputation is tarnished by this scandal, and the swiftness within which the SC responds will determine whether the damage is temporary and minimal or if it will be massive and irreparable. The SC must respond with clear and convincing resoluteness by dismissing from the service the CA justices involved in the irregularities, if the evidence warrants it."
*Senate Minority Leader [[Aquilino Pimentel, Jr.]], Sabio's distant relative, said "whoever tried to bribe the CA should be made to account for the crime (Kung sino ang nag-offer ng bribe kay Justice Sabio, dapat ihabla kasi krimen yon e. Of course yung sinsabi ng abogado, dapat pakinggan din. Ang sama ng dating sa taongbayan because kumbaga, right at the doorstep na ng Supreme Court ito e. It's not only the national, but also the international reputation of the judiciary could be compromised). No formal investigations have been conducted regarding alleged irregularities in the judiciary, particularly in the Court of Appeals, because witnesses are afraid to testify against the so-called “hoodlums in robes".
*Senator [[Edgardo Angara]] said: "Of course, my God when you say that the second-highest level of the judiciary in the Philippines is corrupt and bribable, who's going to be safe investing here or even travelling here?"
*Senator [[Francis Escudero]] said: "there were enough laws to deal with the controversy. Besides, inter-branch courtesy dictates that the Senate would not meddle with the internal affairs of the judiciary. Supreme Court ang may jurisdiction to discipline erring judges and justices."
*Senator [[Loren Legarda]], a former [[Television presenter|broadcaster]] of Lopez-owned ABS-CBN, said: "the gravity of the accusation raised by Sabio were so damaging to the justice system and that they cannot be left unresolved. Sabio's revelation calls for everyone to have an open mind, and to come to conclusion only after a dispassionate and objective appreciation of evidencer. The appropriate criminal, civil or administrative cases must be filed against whoever will be found to have transgressed the law. The judiciary should be above suspicion if it will be effective in dispensing justice. We cannot have one branch of government being diminished by scandals like this."&lt;ref name="yahoo1"/&gt;
*The Senators jointly stated that: "Regardless of the outcome of Meralco-GSIS case at the CA, the senators also said it is clear the case can no longer be heard by Sabio since his fairness has already been tarnished by the various allegations."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=127033 abs-cbnnews.com, SC urged to 'swiftly' probe bribery scandal in CA] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080804-152639/Corruption-in-Court-of-Appeals-widespread----senators |title=newsinfo.inquirer.net, Corruption in Court of Appeals widespread - senators |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |date=2010-06-09 |accessdate=2012-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607002215/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080804-152639/Corruption-in-Court-of-Appeals-widespread----senators |archive-date=2012-06-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Fr. [[Joaquin G. Bernas]], [[Dean (education)|dean]] [[emeritus]] of the [[Ateneo Law School]], told the [[Philippine Daily Inquirer]], that:“The allegations will not do the judiciary any good but the investigation of the Supreme Court will. I don't know the facts. I consider (Sabio) to be an honest man.”
*Ateneo Law Dean [[Cesar L. Villanueva]] vouched for Sabio, saying "the CA justice is one of the well-respected faculty members of the Ateneo Law School."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philstar.com/index.php?Headlines&amp;p=49&amp;type=2&amp;sec=24&amp;aid=20080802147 Headlines Joker to SC: Act on CA mess swiftly By Aurea Calica Sunday, August 3, 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919181436/http://www.philstar.com/index.php?Headlines&amp;p=49&amp;type=2&amp;sec=24&amp;aid=20080802147 |date=September 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Ateneo Law School]] student body, per by [[student council]] president Jess Lopez, stated: "We, his current students, stand as witnesses to his fairness and impartiality, which are beyond reproach, and the genuine manner in which he implores us to stand against all forms of corruption in all aspects of law and governance. The respect we have for Sabio is derived not only from his remarkable skill in teaching, but likewise from his indubitable sense of justice, moral conduct, and service to society. Sabio’s reputation of being a “professor of utmost integrity who will not and cannot be fazed by unjust and wrongful considerations.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Abigail Kwok |url=http://www.inquirer.net/specialfeatures/education/view.php?db=1&amp;article=20080801-152063 |title=inquirer.net/specialfeatures, Sabio’s law students express support |publisher=Inquirer.net |date=2008-08-01 |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Alberto Lim, executive director of the Makati Business Club (MBC) MBC, said: "if Sabio is telling the truth, the MBC would be dismayed at Meralco's moves to bribe a CA justice. On the other hand, if De Borja is telling the truth about Sabio's P50 million bribe demand, it would be a big setback to the judiciary." Sabio said that De Borja told him "the MBC was happy with his earlier decision to sign a temporary restraining order (TRO) favoring Meralco." Lim, however, clarified that De Borja is not its member.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/topofthehour.aspx?StoryId=127049 abs-cbnnews.com, Lopez: We don't bribe people to win cases] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Jovito Salonga]], 88, Bantay Katarungan or Sentinel of Justice chair, said: “It is true that there is bribery in the CA. It should already be stopped. The bribery should be exposed. It should be the beginning of legal reforms in our system of justice. The lawyer-members and even the “student monitors” of Bantay Katarungan know who these personalities are and how the corruption works in the appellate court. They know who these people are. We, in Bantay Katarungan... have been exposing and underscoring the need for reforms in our system of justice. We have written to the Judicial and Bar Council and from time to time the appointing power on the need for reforms in specific instances not only in the CA but in the other courts.”
*Rufus Rodriguez , [[Cagayan de Oro City]] Opposition congressman and former law school dean, said: “This may be an initial black eye for the Court of Appeals...but if (Sabio) just remained silent nothing will happen.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080802-152264/Corruption-in-CA-notorious--Salonga |title=inquirer.net, Corruption in CA notorious-Salonga |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |accessdate=2012-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604000745/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080802-152264/Corruption-in-CA-notorious--Salonga |archive-date=2012-06-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Joker Arroyo]] said: “This is a very good opportunity to clean the CA because like cancer, this is now a severe case that must not be allowed to worsen. The bribery issue involving CA Associate Justice Jose Sabio and the Manila Electric Co. (Meralco) was a blessing in disguise because people would finally be made aware of what had been going on in the judiciary. We cannot just have remedial measures, we need to cleanse the CA because (corruption) has been vulgar. This is corruption right in their front door. Lawyers know all of these but the people don’t. With this scandal, it’s like a case that only lawyers talked about before had been opened. But nobody wanted to come forward because they were afraid of the justices and if nothing happened to their complaint, they would only suffer along with their cases and their clients. Now that this has been opened, it is now up to the Supreme Court to decide (what to do). Why? Because it has been criticizing corruption in the executive department, it complains against delay in the decisions of lower courts, now we have an actual case, there was an (alleged) offer to a justice. Why does (De Borja) have an unusual interest in this case? There are many who are involved. What happens now is that the SC should decide on it firmly. Once it is within the judiciary, nobody can interfere except the SC, only the SC can discipline them. We (in the Senate) cannot intervene and so (they) must resolve this.”
*Camilo Sabio, Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) Chairman, and elder brother of Justice Jose Sabio said: "The CA justice will have a “good fight. I believe he’s in the right side and I have trust in him. I’ve known him for a long time. He’s my brother. He’s a man of integrity.”
*CBCPNews, of the [[Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines]], said "the Ateneo de Manila Law School found the bribery allegations against Sabio as “incredible.”
*Consumer group National Association of Electricity Consumers for Reform (Nasecore), meanwhile, said "Sabio’s revelations affirmed that Meralco does not play by the books on court and regulatory cases it is involved in. There were times in the past that we felt that Meralco had control of the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) because of so many ERC rules that were patently biased in favor of the power company,. So the damning recounting made by no less than a respected justice of the Court of Appeals on how the minions of Meralco operate should give the public a very clear picture of what kind of adversary Nasecore has been facing in our lonesome in the past.” Nasecore won a S.C. case against Meralco for a refund of P827 million, on Aug. 16, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribune.net.ph/headlines/20080803hed1.html tribune.net.ph Explain root of scandal, GSIS chief asks two justices SC urged to focus on ‘case switching’, 08/03/2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807023618/http://www.tribune.net.ph/headlines/20080803hed1.html |date=August 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Senators, on August 12, 2008, called for the ouster or resignation of Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) Chair Camilo Sabio, for allegedly interfering with the GSIS-Meralco case handled by his brother CA Justice J. Sabio. [[Francis Escudero]] stated: Sabio “must go not only for intervening but [also] allowing a classic case of money that was stolen not once but twice.” [[Richard Gordon (politician)|Richard Gordon]] said Sabio “should explain where the Marcos money went.” [[Alan Peter Cayetano]] said: “If [Camilo Sabio] cannot clean up his own backyard, I’m wondering why he would step out of his way to intervene in the case being handled by his brother. Was he acting on his own or was he instructed by someone else?” [[Francis Pangilinan]] stated: “The act of the brother of Justice Sabio may be considered a criminal act. It appears to be an attempt to corrupt a public official under the Revised Penal Code. An investigation must be undertaken and the necessary criminal charges filed.” [[Manny Villar]] said "Sabio’s interference in the CA case was “unethical” and should be quickly looked into." [[Akbayan]] Rep. Risa Hontiveros demanded Sabio’s immediate resignation for purported violation of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act: “persuading, inducing or influencing another public officer to perform an act constituting a violation of rules and regulations duly promulgated by competent authority. There should be no ifs or buts because he has already compromised the integrity of his office, which was ironically established to correct corruption and institute reforms for good government.” &lt;ref name="newsinfo.inquirer.net"/&gt;

; Summary
: ''Air'' is the story of a town's fashion expert Chung Mae, a smart but [[Literacy#Illiteracy|illiterate]] peasant woman in a small village in the fictional country of Karzistan (loosely based on the country of [[Kazakhstan]]), and her suddenly leading role in reaction to dramatic, worldwide experiments with a new [[information technology]] called Air. Air is information exchange, not unlike the [[Internet]], that occurs in everyone's brain and is intended to connect the world. After a test of Air is imposed on Mae's unprepared mountain town, everyone and everything changes, especially Mae who was deeper into Air than any other person. Afterwords, Mae struggles to prepare her people for what is to come while learning all about the world outside her home.

; Summary
: Set in [[Cambodia]], it tells the story of Map, a policeman and former [[Khmer Rouge]], and young motoboy William as they search for the gold leaf memoirs of the 12th Century king [[Jayavarman VII]], which have been stolen by a former lieutenant of [[Pol Pot]].  The memoir is fictional, but Jayavarman is not, and an  account of his life and reign is told in a parallel thread. In addition there is a lengthy flashback to Map's violent activities in the last years of the Cambodian war. The novel makes explicit the contrast between ancient Cambodia's opulence and the poverty and corruption of its modern counterpart.

[[File:Giancarlo De Carlo 1950s.jpg|thumb|right|Giancarlo De Carlo in the 1950s]]
'''Giancarlo De Carlo''' (12 December 1919 − 4 June 2005) was an [[italian people|Italian]] architect.

He was born in [[Genoa]], [[Liguria]], in 1919. He trained as an [[architect]] from 1942 to 1949, a time of political turmoil which generated his philosophy toward life and architecture. [[Libertarian socialism]] was the underlying force for all of his planning and design.

De Carlo saw [[architecture]] as a consensus-based activity. His designs are generated as an expression of the forces that operate in a given context including human, physical, cultural, and, historical forces. His ideas linked [[Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne|CIAM]] ideals with late twentieth century reality.
[[File:Paolo Monti - Servizio fotografico (Urbino, 1982) - BEIC 6354256.jpg|thumb|Faculty of Education, [[Urbino]]. Photo by [[Paolo Monti]], 1982.]]

De Carlo was a member of  [[Team 10]] along with [[Alison and Peter Smithson]], [[Aldo van Eyck]], and [[Jacob Bakema]], among others. Although his political beliefs have limited his portfolio of buildings, his ideas remained untainted by [[postmodernism|postmodernist]] beliefs through his journal ''[[Spazio e Società - Space &amp; Society]]'', and his teaching at the International Laboratory of Architecture and Urban Design ([[ILAUD]]).

De Carlo died in Milan in 2005.

== Honours and awards==
* The [[Wolf Prize in Arts]] in 1988.
* The [[Royal Institute of British Architects|RIBA]] [[Royal Gold Medal]] in 1993.

De Carlo received an Honorary Doctorate from [[Heriot-Watt University]] in 1995 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www1.hw.ac.uk/graduation/honorary-graduates.htm|title=Heriot-Watt University Edinburgh: Honorary Graduates|last=webperson@hw.ac.uk|website=www1.hw.ac.uk|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Domreiter, Blattmaske.jpg|thumb|A foliate head in the shape of an [[Acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]] leaf: a [[corbel]] supporting the [[Bamberg Horseman]], Bamberg cathedral, Germany, early 13th century]]

A '''Green Man''' is a sculpture or other representation of a face surrounded by or made from [[leaf|leaves]]. Branches or [[vine]]s may sprout from the mouth, nostrils, or other parts of the face and these shoots may bear flowers or fruit. Commonly used as a decorative [[ornament (art)|architectural ornament]], Green Men are frequently found in [[Wikt:carving|carvings]] on both secular and [[ecclesiology|ecclesiastical]] buildings. "The Green Man" is also a popular name for English [[public house]]s and various interpretations of the name appear on inn signs, which sometimes show a full figure rather than just the head.

The Green Man [[motif (visual arts)|motif]] has many variations. Found in many cultures from many ages around the world, the Green Man is often related to natural [[vegetation deity|vegetative deities]]. It is primarily interpreted as a [[symbol]] of rebirth, representing the cycle of growth each spring. Some&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cheade|first=Shirlyn|title=Green Man Mythology|url=http://library.tarvalon.net/index.php?title=Green_Man_Mythology|work=TarValon.net Library|accessdate=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jenks|first=Kathleen|title=Common Themes East &amp; West: The Green Man|url=http://www.mythinglinks.org/ct~greenmen.html|work=Myth*ing Links|accessdate=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  speculate that the [[mythology]] of the Green Man developed independently in the traditions of separate ancient cultures and evolved into the wide variety of examples found throughout history.

==Types==

Usually referred to in works on architecture as foliate heads or foliate masks, carvings of the Green Man may take many forms, naturalistic or decorative. The simplest depict a man's face peering out of dense [[foliage]]. Some may have leaves for hair, perhaps with a leafy beard. Often leaves or leafy shoots are shown growing from his open mouth and sometimes even from the nose and eyes as well. In the most abstract examples, the carving at first glance appears to be merely stylised foliage, with the facial element only becoming apparent on closer examination. The face is almost always male; green women are rare.

[[FitzRoy Somerset, 4th Baron Raglan|Julia, Lady Raglan]] applied the term "Green Man" to this type of architectural feature in her 1939 article "The Green Man in Church Architecture" in ''The Folklore Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Raglan | first=Lady |date=March 1939 | title=The Green Man in Church Architecture | journal=Folklore | volume=50 | issue=90990 | pages=45–57 | jstor=1257090 | doi=10.1080/0015587x.1939.9718148}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is thought that her interest stemmed from carvings at [[St Jerome's Church, Llangwm|St. Jerome’s Church]] in [[Llangwm, Monmouthshire|Llangwm]], [[Monmouthshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenmanenigma.com/theories.html |title= : Theories and Interpretations|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= The Enigma of the Green Man|publisher= |access-date= 24 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators conflate or associate the term with "[[Jack in the green|Jack in the Green]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Centerwall | first=Brandon S. | year=1997 | title=The Name of the Green Man | journal=Folklore | volume=108 | pages=25–33 | doi=10.1080/0015587x.1997.9715933}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Green [[cat]]s, [[lion]]s, and [[demon]]s are also found. On [[gravestone]]s and other [[memorial]]s, [[human skull]]s are sometimes shown sprouting [[grape vine]]s or other vegetation, presumably as a symbol of [[resurrection]] (as at [[Shebbear, Devon]], England).{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

The Green Man appears in many forms, with the three most common types categorized as:

*the Foliate Head: completely covered in green leaves
*the Disgorging Head: spews vegetation from its mouth
*the Bloodsucker Head: sprouts vegetation from all facial orifices (e.g. tear ducts, nostrils and mouth)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Harding | first=Mike | title=A Little Book Of The Green Man | publisher=Aurum Press | year=1998 | page=38 | url=http://www.em-online.com/lifestyle/article.asp?id=34 | isbn=1-85410-561-2 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710185348/http://www.em-online.com/lifestyle/article.asp?id=34 | archivedate=2011-07-10 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Pesznecker | first=Susan | title=Gargoyles: From the Archives of the Grey School of Wizardry | publisher=Career Press | year=2007 | location=Franklin Lakes NJ | pages=127–128 | isbn=1-56414-911-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Churches==
Superficially the Green Man would appear to be [[Paganism|pagan]], perhaps a fertility figure or a nature spirit, similar to the [[woodwose]] (the wild man of the woods), and yet he frequently appears, carved in [[wood carving|wood]] or [[stone carving|stone]], in [[Church (building)|churches]], [[chapel]]s, [[abbey]]s and [[cathedral]]s, where examples can be found dating through to the 20th century. The earliest example of a green man disgorging vegetation from his mouth is from St. Abre, in St. Hilaire-le-grand, c. 400 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=William|title=Green Man|year=1990|publisher=Harpercollins|isbn=0-06-250077-5|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition of the Green Man being carved on to Christian churches exists across Europe, including examples such as the Seven Green Men of [[Nicosia]] in [[Cyprus]], a series of seven green men carved in the thirteenth century on to the facade of St Nicholas Church in Nicosia.&lt;gallery&gt;

==Later variations==

From the [[Renaissance]] onwards, elaborate variations on the Green Man theme, often with animal heads rather than human faces, appear in many media other than carvings (including [[manuscript]]s, [[metalwork]], [[bookplate]]s, and [[stained glass]]). They seem to have been used for purely decorative effect rather than reflecting any deeply held belief. A Swiss engraver, Numa Guyot&lt;ref name="Numa"&gt;[http://www.guyotbrothers.com/numa1.htm Numa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107020949/http://www.guyotbrothers.com/numa1.htm |date=2016-01-07 }}, Guyot Brothers&lt;/ref&gt; created a bookplate depicting a Green Man in exquisite detail. It was completed circa 1887.

In Britain, the image of the Green Man enjoyed a revival in the 19th century, becoming popular with [[architect]]s during the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic revival]] and the [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]] era, when it appeared as a decorative motif in and on many buildings, both religious and secular. American architects took up the motif around the same time. The Green Man travelled with the Europeans as they colonized the world. Many variations can be found in Neo-gothic [[Victorian architecture]]. He was very popular amongst Australian stonemasons and can be found on many secular and sacred buildings.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;https://www.flickr.com/photos/jamesrose/164464514/in/photolist-fwVz5-CGLsqi-zb9xE-57nB3x-NPYYH-cXH6tW-4ZBKCU-3iPiZ6-xzNzE-3iTMbf-buqGHT-4JYnSS-7ZggoR-jnSku-hk3Dc5-bCfKoU-aDqEeQ-kmDzzp-EUBjx-i7iw5B-apCqHS-gpjn5-93Zenk-mp5yN-8aNWZa-hFXU1f-82c6i6-pqTS6r-8aKnj4-9xEffL-bMX9oM-x6VT1X-8hoeS1-75R9ej-3iTM6f-5ewQjQ-nRs78-5Jg5V6-6AMtAo-9b9Mrr-5vBFJk-ajvLug-4xqQz6-aB979v-5mVrEm-4ckixq-nREjy-9ptokg-6MPztE-6atk3k&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern images===
The Green Man image has made a resurgence in modern times, with artists from around the world interweaving the imagery into various modes of work.&lt;ref name="AraneoThesis"&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Phyllis Araneo | title=Green Man Resurrected: An Examination of the Underlying Meanings and Messages of the Re-Emergence of the Ancient Image of the Green Man in Contemporary, Western, Visual Culture. | journal=Master's thesis: University of the Sunshine Coast, 2006. Queensland, Australia. | url=http://research.usc.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/usc:894 | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among these are English artist [[Paul Sivell]], who created the ''Whitefield Green Man'', a wood carving in a dead section of a living oak tree; [[David Eveleigh]], an English garden designer who created the ''Penpont Green Man Millennium Maze'', in [[Powys]], [[Wales]] (the largest depiction of a Green Man image in the world); [[Zambia]]n sculptor [[Toin Adams]] who created the 12m-tall ''Green Man'' in Birmingham, UK (the largest free-standing sculpture of the Green Man in the world); and sculptor [[M. J. Anderson]], who created the marble sculpture titled ''Green Man as Original Coastal Aboriginal Man of All Time from Whence the Bush and All of Nature Sprouts from his Fingers.''

Others include Jane Brideson, Australian artist Marjorie Bussey, American artist Monica Richards, and English fantasy artist [[Peter Pracownik]], whose artwork has appeared in several media, including full-body tattoos.&lt;ref name="AraneoThesis"/&gt;

American artist Rob Juszak has taken the theme of the Green Man as Earth’s spiritual protector and turned it into a vision of the Green Man cradling the planet; artist Dorothy Bowen created a kimono silk painting, titled ''Greenwoman'', as an expression of the feminine aspect of the legend.&lt;ref name="AraneoThesis"/&gt;

A character superficially similar to the Green Man, in the form of a partly foliate mask surrounded by Bacchic figures, appears at the center of the 4th century silver salver in the [[Mildenhall Treasure]], found at a [[Roman villa]] site in Suffolk, England; the mask is generally agreed to represent [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] or [[Oceanus]] and the foliation is of seaweed.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Mildenhall treasure Bacchus.JPG|Illustrated]] ([https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_prb/t/mildenhall_treasure_great_dish.aspx British Museum highlights:Great dish from the Mildenhall treasure] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018173452/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_prb/t/mildenhall_treasure_great_dish.aspx |date=2015-10-18 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] nations, such as [[Germany]], [[Iceland]], and [[England]], depictions of the Green Man could have been inspired by deities such as [[Freyr]]&lt;ref&gt;Harding, Paul, Joseph Bindloss, Joseph, &amp; Cornwallis, Graeme.

In [[Thomas Nashe]]'s [[masque]] ''[[Summer's Last Will and Testament]]'' (1592, printed 1600), the character commenting upon the action remarks, after the exit of "Satyrs and wood-Nymphs", "The rest of the green men have reasonable voices ...".

===Modern Paganism===

For many [[modern paganism|modern Pagan]]s, the Green Man is used as a symbol of seasonal renewal and ecological awareness.{{sfn|Bramwell|2009|p=53}}

In [[Wicca]], the Green Man has often been used as a representation of the [[Horned God]], a [[syncretic]] deity that appropriates aspects of, among others, the [[Celtic polytheism|Celtic]] [[Cernunnos]] and the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]].

==Popular culture==

===Literature===

The Green Man is a recurring theme in literature.  Sometimes the figures of [[Robin Hood]] and [[Peter Pan]] are associated with a Green Man, as is that of the Green Knight in ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]''. The Green Knight in this poem serves as both a monster antagonist and as mentor to Sir Gawain, belonging to a pre-Christian world which seems antagonistic to, but is in the end harmonious with, the Christian one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Braudy|first1=Leo|title=Haunted: On Ghosts, Witches, Vampires, Zombies, and Other Monsters of the Natural and Supernatural Worlds|date=Oct 25, 2016|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300224729|page=277|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CqAqDQAAQBAJ&amp;dq|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the post-war era literary scholars interpreted the Green Knight as being a literary representation of Lady Raglan's Green Man as described in her article "The Green Man in Church Architecture", published in the "Folklore" journal of March 1939. This association ultimately helped consolidate the belief that the Green Man was a genuine, Medieval, folkloric, figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Larrington|first1=Carolyne|title=The Land of the Green Man: A Journey Through the Supernatural Landscapes of the British Isles|date=2015|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=1780769911|page=227|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5E4FCwAAQBAJ&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mastin|first1=Luke|title=THEORIES AND INTERPRETATIONS|url=http://www.greenmanenigma.com/theories.html|website=www.greenmanenigma.com|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

[[Sir James Frazer]] mentions the tradition in ''[[The Golden Bough]]''. [[Kingsley Amis]]'s novel ''[[The Green Man (Kingsley Amis novel)|The Green Man]]'' (1969) is about a modern incarnation of the Green Man, who, in the novel, is portrayed as ancient pagan monster. [[Stephen Fry]] wrote a [[pastiche]] of a [[poem]] called "The Green Man" as part of his novel ''[[The Hippopotamus]]''. In [[Charles Olson]]'s book, ''[[Archaeologist of Morning]]'', there is a [[poem]] entitled "The Green Man". [[Ronald Johnson (poet)|Ronald Johnson]] also wrote a book-length poem sequence, ''The Book of the Green Man''. The premise has even made its way into comics, most notably with the character of [[Swamp Thing]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Green men, and variants on the theme, frequently occur in modern fantasy literature and science fiction. [[Tom Bombadil]] and the [[Ents]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' could be considered possible examples. In [[Kenneth Grahame]]'s 1908 children's classic ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]'', a depiction of a natural deity, analogous with [[Pan (god)|Pan]] and Green Man legend, appears as the climax of a mystical experience within the chapter "The Piper at the Gates of Dawn". (Later, the psychedelic rock band [[Pink Floyd]]'s debut studio album took [[The Piper at the Gates of Dawn|its name from that chapter]].) Elsewhere, [[Robert Jordan]]'s series ''[[The Wheel of Time]]'' features a character named [[Someshta]], referred to as "the Green Man". He is the sole survivor of a race called the Nym, who were originally entrusted as the gardeners of the world, and who had the ability to manipulate the life and growth of plants around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The [[Cornish people|Cornish]] poet [[Charles Causley]], the 1967 winner of the [[Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry]] wrote a poem titled ''Green Man In The Garden''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetrysoup.com/charles_causley/biography|title=Charles Causley Biography|website=www.poetrysoup.com|language=en-us|access-date=2018-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the final years of the 20th century and earliest of the 21st, the appearance of the Green Man proliferated in children's literature.{{sfn|Bramwell|2009|p=59}} Examples of such novels in which the Green Man is a central character are [[Bel Mooney]]'s 1997 works ''The Green Man'' and ''Joining the Rainbow'', [[Jane Gardam]]'s 1998 ''The Green Man'', and [[Geraldine McCaughrean]]'s 1998 ''The Stones are Hatching''.{{sfn|Bramwell|2009|p=59}} Within many of these depictions, the Green Man figure absorbs and supplants a variety of other wild men and gods, in particular those which are associated with a seasonal death and rebirth.{{sfn|Bramwell|2009|p=59}}

===Music===
The Green Man was a track by early English acid house outfit [[Shut Up and Dance (band)|Shut Up and Dance]] who entered the UK charts in 1992.  A song "Greenman" by English band [[XTC]] featured on their album ''[[Apple Venus Volume 1]]'' (lyrics included "See the Greenman blow his kiss from high church wall"). A song called "Green Man" is on American heavy metal band [[Type O Negative]]'s album ''[[October Rust]]''. The green man is the subject of [[Roy Harper (singer)|Roy Harper]]'s "The Green Man", the lead song on his [[The Green Man (album)|album of the same name]]. The track "Diadem" on [[Waterson–Carthy]]'s 2006 album ''[[Holy Heathens and the Old Green Man]]'' has phrases which suggest that the figure being adored is some kind of Green Man.

===Cinema===
The Green Man is featured in several films, such as ''[[The Draughtsman's Contract]]'' by [[Peter Greenaway]] (1982) and the first episode of ''[[The Canterbury Tales (film)|The Canterbury Tales]]'' by [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]] (1972). The 2012 [[Disney]] film ''[[The Odd Life of Timothy Green]]'' also appears to depict a Green Man figure in its title character, a magical child who appears in the garden of a childless couple one night. He has leaves growing on his legs, takes nourishment from sunlight and returns to the earth in the fall, after fulfilling his purpose. In the 1973 horror film ''[[The Wicker Man (1973 film)|The Wicker Man]]'', the local tavern of Summerisle is named 'The Green Man', and is the haunt of a group of paganistic islanders.

==Outside Europe==
[[File:Osiris-tomb-of-Nefertari.jpg|thumb|[[Osiris]], ruler of the underworld and of rebirth and regeneration, was typically shown with a green face. (Tomb of [[Nefertari]]), 1295–1253 BC]]

[[File:Khidr.jpg|left|100px|thumb|[[al-Khidr]]]]

In his ''A Little Book of The Green Man'', as well as his website, [[Mike Harding]] gives examples of similar figures in [[Borneo]], [[Nepal]], and [[India]]: the earliest is a foliate head from an 8th-century [[Jain]] [[temple]] in [[Rajasthan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mikeharding.co.uk/ |title=The Official Mike Harding Web Site |publisher=Mikeharding.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also notes that heads from [[Lebanon]] and [[Iraq]] can be dated to the 2nd century and that there are early Romanesque foliate heads in 11th century [[Knights Templar|Templar]] churches in [[Jerusalem]]. He tentatively suggests that the symbol may have originated in [[Asia Minor]] and been brought to [[Europe]] by travelling stonecarvers.

&lt;blockquote&gt;There are legends of him ([[Al-Khidr|Khidr]]) in which, like [[Osiris]], he is dismembered and reborn; and prophecies connecting him, like the Green Man, with the end of time. His name means the Green One or Verdant One, he is the voice of inspiration to the aspirant and committed artist. He can come as a white light or the gleam on a blade of grass, but more often as an inner mood. The sign of his presence is the ability to work or experience with tireless enthusiasm beyond one's normal capacities. In this there may be a link across cultures, …one reason for the enthusiasm of the medieval sculptors for the Green Man may be that he was the source of every inspiration.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In one of his roles the ancient Egyptian God [[Osiris]] is regarded as a corn-deity and is commonly depicted with a green face representing vegetation, rebirth and resurrection. Containers of soil in the shape of Osiris planted with seed ("Osiris Beds") are found in some [[New Kingdom]] tombs. The sprouting corn implied the resurrection of the deceased.&lt;ref&gt;''Routledge Dictionary of Egyptian Gods and Goddesses'', George Hart, p119, Routledge, 2005
{{ISBN|0-415-34495-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other gods depicted green are (in Tibet) Amogha-siddhi and (in Mexico) [[Tlaloc]].

In Sanskrit the Green Man is cognate with the [[gana]] [[Kirtimukha]] or "[[Face Of Glory]]" which is related to a [[lila (Hinduism)|lila]] of [[Shiva]] and [[Rahu]]. The Face of Glory is often seen in [[Vajrayana]] Buddhist [[Thanka]] art and [[iconography]] where it is often incorporated as a cloudform [[simulacrum]]; and depicted crowning the 'Wheel of Becoming' or the [[Bhavachakra]].&lt;ref&gt;Beer, Robert.

[[Khidr]] or al-Khidr ([[Arabic]]: الخضر al-Khiḍr "the Green One", also transcribed as Khidar, Khizr, Khyzer, Khizar) is a revered figure in [[Islam]], whom the [[Qur'an]] describes as a righteous servant of [[God in Islam|God]],&lt;ref name="Qur'an, 18:65"&gt;Qur'an, 18:65&lt;/ref&gt; who possessed great wisdom or mystic knowledge.&lt;ref name="Qur'an, 18:65"/&gt; He is most often said to be a contemporary of  [[Islamic view of Moses|Moses]], but in other variations of his story, he lived at the same time as Abraham, the mythological Persian king [[Fereydun|Afridun]] and Nashiya bin Amus.&lt;ref name="al-Khadir al-Khidr"&gt;{{cite web|title=al-Khadir (al-Khidr)|url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/al-khadir-al-khidr-COM_0483?s.num=4&amp;s.f.s2_parent=s.f.book.encyclopaedia-of-islam-2&amp;s.q=khidr|work=Encyclopedia of Islam, Second Edition|accessdate=21 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Qur'an, 18:64–65&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Al-Kahf|18th sura ("The Cave")]] presents a narrative where Khidr accompanies Moses and tests him about his oath to not ask any questions. Tom Cheetham, an authority on Islamic mysticism, identifies Khidr of esoteric [[Sufism]] with the Green Man. In his book about the work of [[Henry Corbin]] and others concerning the 12th-century Muslim saint [[Ibn Arabi]], he develops the idea of the Green Man/Khidr as the principle mediating between the imaginary realm and the physical world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Johann Heinrich Hübschmann''' (1 July 1848 – 20 January 1908) was a [[Germans|German]] [[philology|philologist]].

==Life==
He born on July 1, 1848 at [[Erfurt]]. He studied Oriental philology at [[Friedrich Schiller University of Jena|Jena]], [[Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen|Tübingen]], [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]], and [[Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich|Munich]]; in 1876 became [[professor]] of Iranian languages at Leipzig, and in 1877 professor of comparative philology at [[University of Strasbourg|Strassburg]]. Hübschmann died on January 20, 1908 in [[Freiburg im Breisgau]].

==Research on Armenian==
Hübschmann was the first to show in 1875 that the [[Armenian language]] was not a branch of the [[Iranian languages]] (earlier assumed so because of the immense amount of Iranian influence on Armenian throughout its history) but an entirely separate [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] branch in its own right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/books/read12.html |title=A Reader in Nineteenth Century Historical Indo-European Linguistics: On the Position of Armenian in the Sphere of the Indo-European Languages |publisher=Utexas.edu |date=20 March 2007 |accessdate=9 December 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151221145559/http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/books/read12.html |archivedate=21 December 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=Dead link to a web page version of a chapter published in "A Reader in Nineteenth Century Historical Indo-European Linguistics" (1967)|date=October 2016}} He used the [[comparative method]] to separate the Iranian loanwords, which make up the majority of Armenian words, from an older layer of native Armenian words.&lt;ref name="iranicaonline.org"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Schmitt |first1=Rüdiger |author-link1=Rudiger Schmitt |last2=Bailey |first2=Harold Walter |author-link2=Harold Walter Bailey |editor-last=Yarshater |editor-first=Ehsan |editor-link=Ehsan Yarshater |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Iranica]] |title=Iranian influences in Armenian Language |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/armenia-iv |access-date=9 December 2015 |date=2011 |orig-year=1986 |publisher=Encyclopædia Iranica Foundation |edition=Online |quote=The revolutionary element in Hübschmann’s procedure was that according to him Arm. words fully or largely agreeing with Ir. forms in phonetic shape were suspect of being loanwords and could therefore not safely be regarded as genuine Arm. words.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10233">[[File:Helmet of Cotofenesti - Front Large by Radu Oltean.jpg|thumb|The Golden Helmet of Coțofenești]]
The '''Golden Helmet of Coțofenești''' /kotsofeneʃti/ is a [[Getae|Geto]]-[[Dacia]]n helmet dating from the first half of the 4th century BC.

In 1929, a child named Traian Simion uncovered the helmet by chance on the territory of the village of Poiana Coțofenești (now called [[Poiana Vărbilău]]), [[Prahova County]], Romania, in the location called "Vârful Fundăturii".

Thereupon, [[Ioan Andrieșescu]], professor of Prehistory at the [[Bucharest University]] conducted a thorough investigation at the site. The team of archaeologists noticed that helmet was not part of a gold treasure or grave but it was part of a local Geto-Dacian [[La Tène]] settlement.{{sfn|Berciu|1969|p=77}} Archaeologists concluded that the helmet was a stray find, as only a few late [[Hallstatt]] pottery fragments were found, some of them wheeled. The helmet is kept at the [[National History Museum of Romania]] (inv 11420).

== Analysis ==
[[File:Helmet of Cotofenesti - Mythological Scene on the Side by Radu Oltean.jpg|thumb|left|text-top|Mythological scene on the side]]
[[File:Helmet of Cotofenesti at the National Museum of Romanian History 2011 - Mythological Scene on the Back.jpg|thumb|left|text-top|Mythological scene on the back]]
Almost a kilogram heavy, the gold helmet is very well preserved, missing only the part of its skull cap. The form of the helmet and its decorations reveal the autochthonous character of this Geto-Dacian artwork. The helmet is decorated with large studs on the top of the skull and two very large [[apotropaic eye]]s, meant to ward off the [[evil eye]] and magic spells.{{sfn|Berciu|1969|p=77}} It was established that it belonged to an unknown local Geto-Dacian king or to a local aristocratic noble, from around year 400 BC .{{sfn|Berciu|1969|p=77}} 
One theory — without any poof, however — is that this item was the sacred helmet of [[Zalmoxis]], the living god-prophet of the [[Dacians]].

[[File:Helmet of Cotofenesti - Front Top by Radu Oltean.jpg|thumb|text-bottom|150px|View with the damaged top.]]

Helmet decorations depict a range of mythical creatures, and  an illustration, on either cheek-piece, of a ritual enactment.{{sfn|Powell|Brown|Boardman|1971|p=193}}

The cheek-pieces of the Poiana-Coțofenești helmet show a ram being sacrificed by a man who kneels on its body and is about to cut its throat with a short knife. The iconography on the right side of the helmet is of a great interest, and has been interpreted in light of the [[tauroctony]] scene from the [[Mithraic Mysteries]]. Environment and affluence might well account for a change to a larger beast in the species offered and a similar interpretation of a bull-slaying episode.{{sfn|Powell|Brown|Boardman|1971|p=193-194}} This  sacrifice of the ram might have been performed by the "king-priest-god" .{{sfn|Polacco|1989|p=177}}

The pair of Voracious Beasts on the Coţofeneşti neck-guard occupy a lower register along with a similar creature deprived of a victim’s leg.{{sfn|Powell|Brown|Boardman|1971|p=193-194}}
This motif of the "Voracious Beast" is found earlier in [[Assyria]]n art, and was popular among the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]]. [[Phoenicia]] was probably the intermediary for its transferral to [[Italia (Roman Empire)|Italy]] and around the [[Adriatic]], but Voracious Beast must also have traveled through [[Asia Minor]] to appear in a North Thracian idiom not only on the Coţofeneşti neck-guard but also in [[high relief]] on the base of the [[Agighiol Treasure|Aghighiol beakers]] ([[Aghighiol]] is a village near the [[Danube Delta]] in eastern Romania).{{sfn|Powell|Brown|Boardman|1971|p=193-194}}
[[File:Aghighiol treasure cup 2 MNIR 2012.JPG|thumb|Silver beaker from Agighiol]]
[[File:Aghighiol treasure cup MNIR 2012.JPG|thumb|Silver beaker from Agighiol]]
The upper register displays a row of three seated or squatting winged creatures, rather monkey-like with human faces, long forearms, and long tails. These, however, are surely direct, if run-down, descendants of the [[sphinx]]es on a [[beaker (archaeology)|gold beaker]] from [[Amlash]] .{{sfn|Powell|Brown|Boardman|1971|p=193-194}}

The eyes on a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] battle-shield may be designated to ward off evil blows, but once translated onto a helmet, and above the eyes of a [[North Thracian]] noble who wore it, could mean "I see twice as well, I have eyes like my hawk".{{sfn|Taylor|1987|p=127}} The Thracian gold and silversmiths who manufactured the objects were aware of other contemporary art styles — those of [[Scythia]], Greece, northeast Italy and now modern Slovenia were known through trade, travel and meetings — and they adapted conventions of representation suitable for their own purposes.{{sfn|Taylor|1987|p=127}} The meaning of these motifs was no doubt context-specific.{{sfn|Taylor|1987|p=127}}

[[File:Helmet of Cotofenesti - Graphical Reconstruction by Radu Oltean.jpg|thumb|left|Graphic reconstruction of the damaged helmet, with the scene resembling a Mithraic tauroctony]]

The decorations such as rosette, strips, triangles, spiral and others are specific Geto-Dacian art motifs. The scene of sacrifice the ram is an oriental Iranian theme that entered in the Greek art and from there in the ‘barbarian’ art. Therefore, the helmet seems to have been realized in a Greek workshop. But, in the same time the awkward technique of execution that contrasts with the perfect technique of a Greek craftsman points out to an autochthonous one.{{sfn|Berciu|1969|p=81}}

==In popular culture==
[[File:Helmet of Cotofenesti - Worn by Decebalus in the movie The Dacians.jpg|thumb|right|text-top|Incorrectly reconstructed replica, worn by [[Decebalus]] in the movie ''Dacii (The Dacians)''.]]
A replica of the helmet appeared in the 1967 historical movie ''[[Dacii (film)|Dacii]]'' (''The Dacians'') by [[Sergiu Nicolaescu]], though it took place at least 500 years after the period to which the helmet has been dated. Worn by the Dacian king [[Decebalus]], the movie helmet had a flat top, an inaccuracy that entered the [[wikt:vernacular|vernacular]] of [[popular culture]]. The [[comic strip]]s "Din zori de istorie", published in late 1970s in "[[Cutezătorii]]" magazine, written by [[Vasile Mănuceanu]] and drawn by [[Albin Stănescu]], also depicts the helmet with a flat top. It is worn by the [[Getian]] king ''Odrix'' during the conflict with the [[Persia]]n king [[Darius I]] who in 513 BC was campaigning against the [[Scythians]]. The action takes place within roughly the period that produced the original helmet. A similar comic strip written by Vasile Mănuceanu and drawn by [[Sandu Florea]] depicts the king [[Burebista]] wearing the helmet as well.

:''Heracleion is also a spelling of [[Heraklion]], [[Crete]]'s largest city and capital.''

'''Heracleion''' ({{lang-gr|Ἡράκλειον}}), also known by its Egyptian name '''Thonis''' ({{lang|grc|Θῶνις}}) and sometimes called '''Thonis-Heracleion''', was an [[ancient Egypt]]ian city located near the [[Canopic Mouth]] of the Nile, about 32&amp;nbsp;km northeast of [[Alexandria]]. Its ruins are located in [[Abu Qir Bay]], currently 2.5&amp;nbsp;km off the coast, under {{convert|10|m|abbr=on|-1}} of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/29/heracleion-photos-lost-egyptian-city_n_3178208.htm|title=Heracleion Photos: Lost Egyptian City Revealed After 1,200 Years Under Sea|work=The Huffington Post|date=29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[stele]] found on the site indicates that it was one single city known by both its Egyptian and Greek names.&lt;ref name=LostCities6&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/aug/15/lost-cities-6-thonis-heracleion-egypt-sunken-sea|title=Lost cities #6: how Thonis-Heracleion resurfaced after 1,000 years under water|last=Shenker|first=Jack|date=15 Aug 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11 Feb 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its legendary beginnings go back to as early as the 12th century BC, and it is mentioned by ancient [[Greeks|Greek]] historians. Its importance grew particularly during the waning days of the [[Pharaoh]]s.&lt;ref name=Alberge&gt;{{cite newspaper|author=Dalya Alberge|title=Ancient Egyptian underwater treasures to be exhibited for the first time|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/aug/02/ancient-egyptian-artefacts-thonis-heracleion-canopus-paris|date=2 August 2015|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heracleion was originally built on some adjoining islands in the [[Nile Delta]]. It was intersected by canals&lt;ref name=Alberge/&gt; with a number of harbors and anchorages. Its wharves, temples and tower-houses were linked by ferries, bridges, and pontoons. The city was an ''emporion'' (trading port)&lt;ref name=LostCities6/&gt; and in the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt]] it was the country's main port for international trade&lt;ref name=Alberge/&gt; and collection of taxes. It had a sister city, [[Naucratis]], which was another trading port lying 72 km (45&amp;nbsp;mi) further up the Nile. Goods were transferred inland via Naucratis, or they were transported via the Western Lake and through a water channel to the nearby town of [[Canopus, Egypt|Canopus]] for onward distribution.&lt;ref name=LostCities6/&gt;

During the second century BC Alexandria superseded Heracleion as Egypt’s primary port. At the end of the century the soil on which Heracleion was built succumbed to [[Soil liquefaction|liquefaction]] and its buildings collapsed into the water.  A few residents stayed on during the Roman era and the beginning of Arab rule, but by the end of the eighth century AD what was left of the city had sunk beneath the sea.&lt;ref name=LostCities6/&gt;

==Legendary beginnings==
Heracleion is mentioned by many chroniclers in antiquity, including [[Herodotus]], [[Strabo]] and [[Diodorus]].&lt;ref name=LostCities6/&gt; The city was said by Herodotus to have been visited by [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] and [[Helen of Troy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Oxford University and the rediscovery of the lost Egyptian city of Heracleion|url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/11820878.Sunken_city_of_Egypt_found/|last=Little|first=Reg|date=26 February 2015|newspaper=The Northern Echo}}&lt;/ref&gt; before the Trojan war began.&lt;ref name=Goddio&gt;{{cite web|title=Sunken Civilizations|url=http://www.franckgoddio.org/projects/sunken-civilizations/heracleion.html|website=Franck Goddio|access-date=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They sought refuge there on their flight from the jealous [[Menelaus]]&lt;ref name=LostCities6/&gt; but were rebuffed by Thonis, the watchman at the entrance to the Nile.&lt;ref name=Hammond&gt;{{cite book|title=Pop Culture in North Africa and the Middle East|series=Entertainment and Society around the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P57PDgAAQBAJ|first=Andrew|last=Hammond|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2017|isbn=9781440833847|page=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively it was believed{{by whom|date=January 2017}} that Menelaus and Helen had stayed there, accommodated by the noble Egyptian Thon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Stephanus of Byzantium]]|title=Ethnika kat' epitomen|url=https://archive.org/stream/stephanibyzanti00meingoog#page/n332/mode/2up|chapter=Θῶνις|language=Greek}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his wife [[Polydamna]]. The 2nd century BC Greek poet [[Nicander]] wrote that Menelaus’s helmsman, Canopus, was bitten by a viper on the sands of Thonis.&lt;ref name=Alberge/&gt; According to Herodotus, a great temple was built at the spot where [[Heracles]] first arrived in Egypt.&lt;ref name=Goddio/&gt; The story of Heracles' visit resulted in the Greeks calling the city by the Greek name Heracleion rather than its original Egyptian name Thonis.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Ancient references==
[[Image:PtolemyVIIIStela.jpg|thumb|The stelae of Ptolemy VIII from the temple of Heracleion]]

{{quote|Until very recently the site had been known only from a few literary and epigraphic sources, one of which interestingly mentions the site as an [[Emporia (ancient Greece)|emporion]], just like Naukratis.|[[British Museum]], 2013&lt;ref name=naukratis&gt;
[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/online_research_catalogues/ng/naukratis_greeks_in_egypt/introduction/naukratis_a_city_and_port.aspx Naukratis: a city and trading port in Egypt], British Museum&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The city was mentioned by the ancient historians Diodorus (1.19.4) and Strabo (17.1.16). Herodotus was told that Thonis was the warden of the Canopic mouth of the [[Nile]]: Thonis arrested [[Paris (mythology)|Alexander]] (Paris), the son of [[Priam]], because Alexander had abducted [[Helen of Troy]] and taken much wealth.&lt;ref name=naukratis /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'', 2.113-115&lt;/ref&gt;

Heracleion is also mentioned in the twin [[steles]] of the [[Decree of Nectanebo I]] (the first of which is known as the 'Stele of Naukratis'), which specify that one tenth of the taxes on imports passing through the town of Thonis/Herakleion were to be given to the sanctuary of [[Neith]] of [[Sais]].&lt;ref name=naukratis /&gt; The city is also mentioned in the [[Decree of Canopus]] honoring Pharaoh [[Ptolemy III]], which describes donations, sacrifices and a procession on water.&lt;ref name=Alberge/&gt;

Sanctuaries in Heracleion dedicated to Osiris and other gods were famous for miraculous healing and attracted pilgrims from a wide area.&lt;ref name=Alberge/&gt; The city was the site of the celebration of the ‘mysteries of [[Osiris]]' each year during the month of Khoiak. The god in his ceremonial boat was brought in procession from the temple of Amun in that city to his shrine in [[Canopus, Egypt|Canopus]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

==Archaeology==
[[Image:PtolemyWithElephants.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic]] coins from the submerged Heracleion]]
The city had a large temple of [[Khonsu|Khonsou]], son of [[Amun]], who was known to the Greeks as [[Herakles]].&lt;ref&gt;Anne Burton, [https://books.google.ca/books?id=sXiMtMnPHikC&amp;pg=PA105 ''Diodorus Siculus, Book 1: A Commentary.''] BRILL, 1972 {{ISBN|9004035141}} p105&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the worship of Amun became more prominent.

Heracleion flourished especially from the 6th to the 4th century BC, as revealed by numerous archaeological finds. Pharaoh [[Nectanebo I]] made many additions to the temple in the 4th century B.C.&lt;ref name="Lost city of Heracleion gives up its secrets"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/environment/archaeology/10022628/Lost-city-of-Heracleion-gives-up-its-secrets.html |title=Lost city of Heracleion gives up its secrets |work=The Telegraph |accessdate = 2013-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time the city was weakened by a combination of earthquakes, tsunamis and  rising sea levels. Finds of pottery and coins appear to stop at the end of the 2nd century BC. At this point, probably after a severe flood, the central island succumbed to liquefaction of the soil on which it was built. The hard clay turned rapidly into a liquid and the buildings collapsed.&lt;ref name=LostCities6/&gt;

In 1933 an [[RAF]] commander flying over Abu Qir Bay saw ruins under the water. At that time, most historians believed that Thonis and Heracleion were two separate cities, both located on what is now the Egyptian mainland.&lt;ref name=LostCities6/&gt; The ruins submerged in the sea were located by the French [[underwater archaeology|underwater archaeologist]] [[Franck Goddio]] in 1999, after a five-year search.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geeksvip.com/g/21-underwater-discoveries-that-will-make-your-jaw-drop/3/?ipp=1 You won't believe what they found under the sea!]&lt;/ref&gt; Goddio's finds have included incomplete statues of the god [[Serapis]] and the queen [[Arsinoe II]].&lt;ref name="Telegraph-Goddio"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sooke|first1=Alastair|title=Sunken Cities: the man who found Atlantis|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/art/what-to-see/sunken-cities-the-man-who-found-atlantis/|website=The Telegraph|accessdate=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; No more than 5% of the city's area was explored by the archaeologist.&lt;ref name=LostCities6/&gt;

'''Issue advocacy ads''' (also known as '''interest advocacy ads''' or '''issue only ads''') are communications intended to bring awareness to a certain problem.  Groups that sponsor this form of communication are known by several names including: [[Advocacy group|interest advocacy group, issue advocacy group, issue only group, or special interest group]].  The problems these groups raise awareness of can be either a social or political issue.

==Interest versus express advocacy==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2016}}
The bright-line test doesn't cover forms of communication that are indirect or debatable.  Consider this message to voters:

*''If you like candidate X, you need to know he did Y.''

In a communication like this, there is no mention about voting, however, the plain intention is to cast doubt on voters that supported candidate X.  

Campaigning like this is typically called [[negative campaigning]], making attack ads, or making thinly veiled promotional ads on the behalf of the candidate.

===Interest advocacy===
Interest advocacy is the act of making generalized communication regarding a public issue or problem without advocating voters to take a specific action at the election booth.&lt;ref name="moritz"&gt;[http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/electionlaw/ebook/part3/campaign_finance_fed_glossary.html by Michelle Robinson, Section 3.1 - Campaign finance, Subsection 3.1.1 Federal law, Glossary of term, Michael E. Moritz College of Law, Ohio State University, referenced February 16, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

Identification of a pure "issue only ads" made by interest advocacy groups is difficult.  Groups that sponsored messages needed to make it clear, to a voter with [[reasonable person|reasonable intelligence]], that the voter should cast their ballot in a manner the group wanted.

Keeping an advertisement issue important to only groups like [[501(c)(3)]] non-profits. They were subject to limits or absolute prohibitions on engaging in political activities. Organizations can participate in nonpartisan voter education efforts, including registration and "get-out-the-vote" drives and issue advocacy.&lt;ref name="Elacqua"&gt;[http://www.hbtlj.org/v08p1/v08p1elacquaar.pdf Eyes wide shut: The ambiguous "political activity" prohibition and its effects on 501(c)(3) organizations, Houston Business and Tax Journal, by Amelia Elacqua, 2008, p. 118, 119 and 141, referenced February 16, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Express advocacy===
{{refimprove section|date=March 2016}}
Express advocacy is largely used in connection with a debate in the US regarding when issue advocacy turns into [[political campaign|campaigning]]. 

Many groups that made what appeared to most to be campaign advertisements claimed that their communications to voters were really issue advocacy and not express advocacy. To help understand the difference, examine these two communications to voters: 

*''Select John Smith.''
*''Vote no! on Proposition 99.''

In both examples the message's intention is clear. Using a standard that looks for specific words or phrases in a communication is called conducting a [[bright-line]] test. Bright-line is a standard if there is no mistake.  One or more of the "[[Eight Magic Words]]" or their {{clarify|reason=definition?|text=equivalents|date=March 2016}} is present or not present.  

Express advocacy is associated with [[independent expenditure]]s.

===History===
In the 1970s, changes to regulations permitted non-candidate organizations to make [[independent expenditure]]s and use their money in election season. They could neither give it directly to a candidate nor make advertisement on a candidates behalf.  Typical expenditures were described as being "party building" and [[get out the vote]] campaigns. Organizations, especially non-profits were supposed to do it on a [[nonpartisan]] basis. However, groups tended to focus efforts on signing up and getting the type of voters to the polls that were most likely to hold similar views.

The only barrier stopping a group from campaigning directly for their favorite candidate or cause was something called the "reasonable person" test: if a reasonable person, viewing the communication, comes to the conclusion the sponsor wants them to vote in one way, it is express advocacy, not interest advocacy.&lt;ref name="BlueRibbon"&gt;[http://www.lafollette.wisc.edu/campaign_reform/final.htm Governor’s Blue-Ribbon Commission on campaign finance reform for State of Wisconsin, Final Report, Section 5. Level the playing field, Promoting freedom of speech, paragraph 3-6, Chairman Donald F. Kettl, May 1997] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111209063419/http://www.lafollette.wisc.edu/campaign_reform/final.htm |date=2011-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

One problem with the reasonable person test is it is not definitive or a [[bright-line rule]].  There was no clear line that clearly stated if you cross this point you are on the wrong side. In an attempt to help the situation, in 1976 a footnote was included in a US Supreme Court ruling provided eight examples.&lt;ref name="BuckleyValeo"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Buckley v. Valeo |last=Smith |first=Craig R. |title=Free Speech on Trial: Communication Perspectives on Landmark Supreme Court Decisions |editor=Parker, Richard A. (ed.) |year=2003 |publisher=University of Alabama Press |location=Tuscaloosa, AL |isbn=0-8173-1301-X |pages=203&amp;ndash;217}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

However, rather than using them as examples, many found it easier to just leave out the "magic words" and claim their communications to voters were fine. By 1996, interest advocacy groups were spending millions of dollars on campaigns claiming their advertisements were "issue only" since they left out the "magic words."

By 2000, voters were inundated with $500 million worth of this type of advertisement.&lt;ref name="GWU"&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~smpa/faculty/documents/Swift_Boat_Article_FALR_000.pdf Swift boat Vets in 2004: Press coverage of an independent campaign, First Amendment Law Review, University of North Carolina School of Law, Vol. 4, 2005, by Albert L. May, July 29, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to the "shame issue ads," scandals, and the amount of spending, Congress held a congressional investigation.  It reinvigorated campaign finance reform, and led to the [[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act]] in 2002, which is more commonly known as McCain-Feingold.&lt;ref name="GWU" /&gt;{{RP|75}}

In 2003, in ''[[McConnell v. Federal Election Commission]]'', the Court detailed the difference between interest versus express advocacy. It ruled looking for [[Eight Magic Words|"magic words"]] as "functionally meaningless" since an advertiser can communicate its intention to voters without them.&lt;ref name="GWU" /&gt;{{RP|15}} Therefore, instead of looking for words, the Court again ruled that if a communication to voters had  "no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for, or against, a specific candidate," it is "the functional equivalent of express advocacy."&lt;ref name="GSUlaw"&gt;[http://ssrn.com/abstract=1878727 Has the tide turned in favor of disclosure? Revealing money in politics after Citizens United and Doe v. Reed, by Ciara Torres-Spelliscy, Georgia State University Law Review, Vol. 27, No. 4, 2011, July 4, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|1092}}

In the [[United States presidential election, 2004]], "issue only" ads continued and some famous ones were made by a group called [[Swift Vets and POWs for Truth|Swift Boat]].  They claimed their advertisements were issue only ads, not express advocacy. According to at least one analyst, voters voted exactly how the sponsors intended and the advertisements "torpedoed" [[Massachusetts]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[John Kerry presidential campaign, 2004]].&lt;ref name="HuffPost"&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/07/29/wyly-brothers-republican-campaign-donations_n_664550.html "Wyly Brothers Gave Millions To Over 200 Republican Candidates"], ''The Huffington Post'', Marcus Baram, July 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a [[political action committee]] [[Progress of America]], ran an advertisement that showed the horrors of terrorism and stated that [[Osama bin Laden]] and [[Al-Qaeda]] want to kill American citizens. At the end, ot asked, "Would you trust Kerry against these killers?" "George Bush did not start this War, but he will end it." The "magic words" are missing.  

In 2007, the US [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in ''[[Federal Election Commission v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.]]'' ruled that issue ads may not be banned from the months preceding a primary or general election. The test to tell the difference between interest and express advocacy remained the [[reasonable person]] test.

However, that is said to have created a difficulty. A test that requires someone to consider how a [[reasonable person]] views a communication to voters requires someone to decide. The only definitive answer comes from a judge and that takes time. Election commissions are not judges, but they can issue [[advisory opinion]] on the matter. That led to a concern that in federal elections, that officials at the [[Federal Election Commission]] and state-level commissions would have to do work. Anyone cautious, wanting to make sure the communication to voters, was interest and not express advocacy would contact it for an opinion.  Communications to voters covers a wide range of areas including advertisements, e-mails, signs, and even speeches on the pulpit might want to ask someone.  

To resolve this issue, the [[US Supreme Court]] looked back at a prior ruling. In 1976, in ''[[Buckley v. Valeo]]'', the Supreme Court held that one thing of key importance was protecting free speech. 

In 2010, ''[[Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission]]''  determined, among other things, that it would be basically not possible for the federal government to be in the business of determining what does and does not constitute issue advocacy or express advocacy.

==Disclosure requirements==
In 2010, ''Citizens United'' "expressly rejected the contention that election-law disclosure requirements are limited to express
advocacy or its functional equivalent." While it and a subsequent case affected certain spending limitations, it did not permit those making the spending from evading disclosure requirements by claiming they were performing issue advocacy.&lt;ref name="GSUlaw" /&gt;{{RP|1091-1092}}

Also in 2010 in a case known as ''[[Doe v. Reed]]'', the Supreme Court rejected an appeal to keep signatures upon a referendum from voters, based upon a claim it violated the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].

Lower courts are already applying these new standards to uphold a gamut of state disclosure laws ranging from ballot measures to candidate elections, and from express advocacy to issue advocacy.&lt;ref name="GSUlaw" /&gt;{{RP|1103}}

''' John Henry Coatsworth''' (born September 27, 1940) is an [[Americans|American]] historian of Latin America and the [[provost (education)|provost]] of [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/?id=TrCfyqvlKNYC&amp;q=%22Coatsworth,+John+Henry%22+1940&amp;dq=%22Coatsworth,+John+Henry%22+1940 | title = National directory of Latin Americanists: Biographies of 4,915 specialists |last1=Harman |first1=Inge Maria |last2= Hispanic Division | year = 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From 2007 until February 2012 Coatsworth was the dean of Columbia's [[School of International and Public Affairs]] (SIPA), and served concurrently as interim provost beginning in 2011.  Coatsworth is a scholar of Latin American economic, social and international history, with an emphasis on Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean.

==Biography==
Professor Coatsworth received his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] degree in History from [[Wesleyan University]] (1963) and his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] (1967) and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] (1972) degrees in [[economic history]] from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]. He taught at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1969 until 1992 and at [[Harvard University]] until 2006. His other academic posts have included visiting professorships at [[El Colegio de México]], the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]], the [[National University of Buenos Aires]], the [[Instituto Torcuato di Tella]] in [[Buenos Aires]], and the [[Instituto Ortega y Gassett]] in [[Madrid]].

Dean Coatsworth is the author or editor of eight books and many scholarly articles on [[Latin America]]n economic and international history. He is a former president of the [[American Historical Association]] and [Latin American Studies Association]. At [[Harvard|Harvard University]], he served as the founding director of the [[David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies]] from its creation in 1994 until 2006. He also chaired the [[Harvard University Committee on Human Rights Studies]]. He is a member of [[The Council on Foreign Relations]], the Board of Directors of the [[Tinker Foundation]], the Board of Trustees and the Scientific Council of the Foundation [[Institute IMDEA]] Social Sciences, and numerous professional associations.

He has served on the editorial boards of numerous scholarly journals including the [[American Historical Review]], the [[Journal of Economic History]], and the [[Hispanic American Historical Review]] and as well as social science and history journals published in Britain, Chile, Germany, Mexico, Peru, and Spain.  Dean Coatsworth's most recent book is ''Living Standards in Latin American History: Height, Welfare and Development, 1750–2000'' (Cambridge: David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies, Harvard University, 2010), edited with Ricardo Salvatore and Amilcar Challú.  His research and publications have focused on comparative economic, social, and international history of Latin America, especially [[Mexico]], [[Central America]], and the [[Caribbean]].

Coatsworth was awarded the [[John Simon Guggenheim Foundation]] [[Fellow]]ship in 1986, served as Senior [[Fulbright Lecturer]] three times (for appointments in [[Argentina]] and Mexico), and has received research and institutional grants from public agencies and private foundations in the United States and elsewhere.  He has also acted as a consultant for program design or review to numerous U.S. universities and private foundations.  In 2005, he was elected to membership in the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].

==Controversy over the invitation of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad==

While addressing the [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad|President of Iran's]] [[Columbia University#Mahmoud Ahmadinejad visit and speech controversy|upcoming visit]] to the University campus on [[Fox News]], Dean Coatsworth was asked whether the administration would have allowed [[Adolf Hitler]] to speak on campus if he had asked. Coatsworth replied that "If he [Hitler] were willing to engage in a debate and a discussion to be challenged by Columbia students and faculty, we would certainly invite him."&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|GxmEGsOkEVc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, University President [[Nicholas Murray Butler]] held a speaking engagement and reception for [[Germany]]'s Ambassador the United States [[Hans Luther]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hnn.us/roundup/entries/42946.html History News Network&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Asked to clarify his remarks on September 24 on CNN Coatsworth said: “Look, if Hitler had come to the Columbia University in 1936, I would have been outside with the peaceful protesters. Or if I had been dean, I would have been inside presenting him to our students to be challenged. You can't choose your role in life. You can only choose the principles you have to live by. And in this case, we're providing not a platform but a classroom and we're going to challenge this guy as he has not been challenged in other places.”

Coatsworth has advocated for the U.S. to abide by and strengthen global rules and norms. “The United States faces a fundamental issue and that issue is, how do we create international and global institutions that function effectively and will continue to function effectively when the U.S. is no longer a global super power,” Coatsworth said in an April 9, 2010, interview with Charlie Rose on PBS.

{{Anthropology of kinship|terms}}
{{Anthropology}}

'''Kinship terminology''' is the system used in [[language]]s to refer to the persons to whom an individual is related through [[kinship]]. Different societies classify kinship relations differently and therefore use different systems of kinship terminology; for example, some languages distinguish between [[consanguine]] and [[Affinal kin|affinal]] uncles (i.e. the brothers of one's parents and the husbands of the sisters of one's parents, respectively), whereas others have only one word to refer to both a father and his brothers. Kinship terminologies include the terms of address used in different languages or communities for different relatives and the terms of reference used to identify the relationship of these relatives to ego or to each other.

==Historical view==
[[Anthropologist]] [[Lewis H. Morgan|Lewis Henry Morgan]] (1818–1881) performed the first survey of kinship terminologies in use around the world. Though much of his work is now considered dated, he argued that [[kinship]] terminologies reflect different sets of distinctions. For example, most kinship terminologies distinguish between sexes (the difference between a brother and a sister) and between generations (the difference between a child and a parent). Moreover, he argued, kinship terminologies distinguish between relatives by blood and [[marriage]] (although recently some anthropologists have argued that many societies define kinship in terms other than blood).

However, Morgan also observed that different languages (and, by extension, societies) organize these distinctions differently. He proposed to describe kinship terms and terminologies as either descriptive or [[Classificatory kinship|classificatory]]. When a descriptive term is used, it can only represent one type of relationship between two people, while a classificatory term represents one of many different types of relationships. For example, the word ''[[brother]]'' in English-speaking societies indicates a son of the same parent; thus, English-speaking societies use the word ''brother'' as a descriptive term.  A person's male first cousin could be the mother's brother's son, mother's sister's son, father's brother's son, father's sister's son, and so on; English-speaking societies therefore use the word ''cousin'' as a classificatory term.

Morgan discovered that a descriptive term in one society can become a classificatory term in another society.  For example, in some societies, one would refer to many different people as "mother" (the woman who gave birth to oneself, as well as her sister and husband's sister, and also one's father's sister). Moreover, some societies do not group together relatives which the English-speaking societies classify together. For example, some languages have no one-word equivalent to ''cousin'', because different terms refer to one's mother's sister's children and to one's father's sister's children.

Armed with these different terms, Morgan identified six basic patterns of kinship terminologies:

*[[Hawaiian kinship]]: the most classificatory; only distinguishes between sex and generation.  Thus, siblings and cousins are not distinguished (the same terms are used for both types of relatives).
*[[Sudanese kinship]]: the most descriptive; no two types of relatives share the same term.  Siblings are distinguished from cousins, and different terms are used for each type of cousin (i.e. father's brother's children, father's sister's children, mother's sister's children and mother's brother's children).
*[[Eskimo kinship]]: has both classificatory and descriptive terms; in addition to sex and generation, it also distinguishes between lineal relatives (those related directly by a line of descent) and collateral relatives (those related by blood, but not directly in the line of descent). Lineal relatives have highly descriptive terms; collateral relatives have highly classificatory terms.  Thus, siblings are distinguished from cousins, while all types of cousins are grouped together.  The system of English-language kinship terms falls into the Eskimo type.
*[[Iroquois kinship]]: has both classificatory and descriptive terms; in addition to sex and generation, it also distinguishes between siblings of opposite sexes in the parental generation. A genealogical relationship traced through a pair of siblings of the same sex is classed as a blood relationship, but one traced though a pair of siblings of the opposite sex can be considered an in-law relationship. In other words, siblings are grouped together with [[parallel cousin]]s, while separate terms are used for [[cross-cousin]]s.  Also, one calls one's mother's sister "mother" and one's father's brother "father".  However, one refers to one's mother's brother and one's father's sister by separate terms (often the terms for ''father-in-law'' and ''mother-in-law'', since cross-cousins can be preferential marriage partners).
*[[Crow kinship]]: like Iroquois, but further distinguishes between one's mother's side and one's father's side. Relatives on the mother's side of the family have more descriptive terms, and relatives on the father's side have more classificatory terms.  Thus, Crow kinship is like Iroquois kinship, with the addition that a number of relatives belonging to one's father's matrilineage are grouped together, ignoring generational differences, so that the same term is used for both one's father's sister and one's father's sister's daughter, etc.
*[[Omaha kinship]]: like Iroquois, but further distinguishes between one's mother's side and one's father's side. Relatives on the mother's side of the family have more classificatory terms, and relatives on the father's side have more descriptive terms.  Thus, Omaha kinship is like Iroquois, with the addition that a number of relatives belonging to one's mother's patrilineage are grouped together, ignoring generational differences, so that the same term is used for both one's mother's brother and one's mother's brother's son, etc.

The basic principles of Crow and Omaha terminologies are symmetrical and opposite, with Crow systems having a matrilineal emphasis and Omaha systems a patrilineal emphasis.

==Relative age==
Some languages, such as [[Kannada]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Sinhalese language|Sinhalese]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]] (see [[Chinese kinship]]), [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], Cambodian, [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] ([[Filipino language|Filipino]]), [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Nepali language|Nepalese,]] and [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]] add another dimension to some relations: relative age. Rather than one term for "brother", there exist, for example, different words for "older brother" and "younger brother". In Tamil, an older male sibling is referred to as ''Annan'' and a younger male sibling as ''Thambi'', whereas older and younger female siblings are called ''Akka'' and ''Thangai'' respectively.

==Identification of alternating generations==
Other languages, such as [[Chiricahua language|Chiricahua]], use the same terms of address for alternating generations. So a Chiricahua child (male or female) calls their paternal grandmother ''-ch’iné'', and likewise this grandmother will call her son's child ''-ch’iné''. Similar features are seen also in [[Huichol language|Huichol]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Myerhoff|first=Barbara G.|year=1974|title=Peyote Hunt: The Sacred Journey of the Huichol Indians|location=Ithaca|publisher=Cornell, University Press|page=66|isbn=&lt;!--0-8014-9137-1--&gt;|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer, Stacy and Peter T.

Terms that recognize alternating generations and the prohibition of marriage within one's own set of alternate generation relatives (0, ±2, ±4, etc.) are common in [[Australian Aboriginal kinship]].

The relative age and alternating-generations systems are combined in some languages.  For instance,
[[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] borrows the relative age system of the [[Chinese kinship]] and follows the generation system of kinship. [[Philippine Kinship|Philippine kinship]] distinguishes between generation, age and in some cases, gender.

The basic idea is that of applying an even/odd distinction to relatives that takes into account the gender of every linking relative for ego’s kin relation to any given person. A MFBD(C), for example, is a mother’s father’s brother’s daughter’s child. If each female link (M,D) is assigned a 0 and each male (F,B) a 1, the number of 1s is either even or odd; in this case, even. However, variant criteria exist.&lt;!-- which, ideally, would be detailed here. --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In a Dravidian or Tamil system with a patrilineal [[modular arithmetic|modulo]]-2 counting system, marriage is prohibited with this relative, and a marriageable relative must be modulo-2 odd. There exists also a version of this logic with a matrilineal bias. Discoveries of systems that use modulo-2 logic, as in South Asia, Australia, and many other parts of the world, marked a major advance in the understanding of kinship terminologies that differ from kin relations and terminologies employed by Europeans.

The Dravidian or Tamil kinship system involves selective cousinhood. One's father's brother's children and one's mother's sister's children are ''not'' cousins but brothers and sisters one step removed. They are considered ''consanguineous'' (''pangali'' in Tamil), and marriage with them is strictly forbidden as incestuous. However, one's father's sister's children and one's mother's brother's children are considered cousins and potential mates (''muraicherugu'' in Tamil). Marriages between such cousins are allowed and encouraged. There is a clear distinction between [[cross cousin|cross cousins,]] who are one's true cousins and [[parallel cousin|parallel cousins,]] who are, in fact, siblings. Like Iroquois people, Dravidians use the same words to refer to their father's sister and mother-in-law (''atthai'' in Tamil &amp; ''atthe'' in Kannada) and their mother's brother and father-in-law ( Maamaa in Tamil &amp;''maava'' in Kannada). In Kannada, ''sodara'' is added before ''atthe'' and ''maava'' to specifically refer to father's sister and mother's brother respectively, although it is not used in direct address where as in Tamil only mother''s brother is captioned with "Thaai" before "maamaa" to specify it as mother''s brother (he is respected with high regards in their customs).

The play '''''Maria''''', a portrait of the sordid underbelly of Soviet society during the [[Russian Civil War]], was written by [[Isaac Babel]] during the mid-1930s.

==Plot==
''Maria'' is set in [[Saint Petersburg]] during the [[Russian Civil War]]. In the aftermath of the [[October Revolution]], the once iron clad Russian [[class system]] has disintegrated. The plot focuses on the [[Russian nobility|aristocratic]] Mukovnin family and their attempts to adapt to the hardships of [[war communism]] and chaos. The elderly General Mukovnin is writing books about Russia's [[military history]], where he criticizes the harsh treatment of common soldiers under the [[Imperial Russian Army]]. He sympathizes with Lenin's Bolsheviks and regards them as "gatherers of the Russian lands" akin to [[Ivan Kalita]]. His daughter, the ditzy and superficial Ludmila, is hoping for an advantageous marriage with Isaac Dimshits, the [[Soviet Jews|Jewish]] [[mob boss]] who dominates the city's [[black market]] food supply. Her cousin, Katya Felsen, is unhappy and pessimistic about the new regime, despite having an affair with a senior [[Soviet Army]] officer. The General's eldest daughter, Maria, is an idealistic Communist and a [[political officer (military)|political officer]] assigned to the Soviet Army. During the entire play, she is away on the front and is quoted, but never seen.

Ultimately, Dimshits makes sexual advances to Ludmila, who repels them by claiming to have toothache, to his great discontent and humiliation. Ludmila's intentions are to achieve Dimshits' respect and finally marry him. Dimshits, however, is already married, and only wants Ludmila as a [[mistress (lover)|mistress]]. According to Dimshits, "People like her are unworthy of even tying my wife's shoelaces!"

At the time of their next rendezvous, the embittered Dimshits does not show up. In the adjacent apartment, Captain Viskovsky, a [[White Army]] officer turned jewel thief who works for Dimshits and whose advances were rejected by Maria. Viskovsky is drinking together with Yasha Kravchenko, a corrupt artillery officer in the [[Red Army]]. Viskovsky invites Ludmila in, gets her drunk and then rapes her in a nearby room. Disgusted, Kravchenko reproaches him for having infected Ludmila with [[Gonorrhea]]. Viskovsky threatens to beat Kravchenko, who pulls his gun and initiates a gun battle in which each kills the other. As a result, the Soviet police, or [[militsiya]], arrest Ludmila, the lone survivor. At the station, the interrogator assumes that she is a [[prostitute]] who smuggles thread for Dimshits' gang. While she protests her innocence and begs for a doctor, the interrogator demands to know how many times she has been arrested, and then shouts in anger that he has not slept in five days.

A crippled [[World War I]] veteran, who also works for Dimshits, arrives at the Mukovnins' apartment with the news. The General, fearful that she may have been arrested by the [[CHEKA]], first intends to demand her release, then realizes that that is impossible and instead wants to take advice with Maria. Therefore, he checks to make sure that his other daughter, Maria, has received his earlier telegram, in which he urged her to return from the front to visit him. He learns that the telegram has been delivered and convinces himself that Maria will be coming very soon. He even declares that he is not worried about Ludmila and that this will be a valuable lesson for her, but then has a massive heart attack seconds later. His condition is critical, but it proves impossible to fetch a doctor at night to help him.

Soon afterwards, a soldier from Maria's division arrives. He announces that Maria has been unable to come because of the continuing military operations. The General enters the room, expecting to see Maria, but is shocked to see only a soldier he does not know and possibly assumes that Maria has been killed. He instantly dies of a massive stroke.

Later, two workers prepare the Mukovnins' former apartment for its new tenants. They are "bossed around" by their forewoman, the local street-sweeper, who is in charge of apartments. Katya arrives with Sushkin, a person who describes himself as a "lover of antiquities". She announces that she is selling the Mukovnins' antique furniture on Maria's orders. The forewoman of the workers refuses to allow this, saying that the new tenants were promised a fully furnished apartment. An enraged Sushkin threatens her, hinting that he can bring "people" (presumably [[militsiya]] men or CHEKA agents) to arrest her. However, she refuses to yield unless he can show her a warrant. After Sushkin leaves in a huff, the two workers comment on the forewoman's conduct and observe that she wasn't so daring during the old general's time. Yet, they recall the general as a nice person, loved by the common people. Meanwhile, the new tenants, a worker and his pregnant wife, settle into their new home.

==Reception==
''Maria'' is rooted in Babel's work as an investigative reporter for [[Maxim Gorky]]'s [[Menshevik]] newspaper, ''Novaya zhizn'' (Новая жизнь). Babel published there between March and July 1918, when [[Vladimir Lenin]] ordered the closing of all newspapers not controlled by the [[CPSU]].

Babel later recalled, however, &lt;blockquote&gt;"My journalistic work gave me a lot, especially in the sense of material. I managed to amass an incredible number of facts, which proved to be an invaluable creative tool. I struck up friendships with morgue attendants, criminal investigators, and government clerks. Later, when I began writing fiction, I found myself always returning to these 'subjects', which were so close to me, in order to put character types, situations, and everyday life into perspective. Journalistic work is full of adventure."&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Works of Isaac Babel," page 486.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After the completion of ''Maria'' in the mid-1930s, Babel allowed the unpublished manuscript to be examined by Gorky, who remained his friend and [[mentor]]. Noting the play's implicit rejection of [[socialist realism]], Gorky accused Babel of having a "[[Charles Baudelaire|Baudelairian]] predilection for rotting meat." Gorky further warned his friend that "political inferences" would be made "that will be personally harmful to you."&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Works of Isaac Babel'', page 754.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Babel's [[common law wife]], Antonina Pirozhkova, &lt;blockquote&gt;"Once Babel went to the [[Moscow Art Theater]] when his play ''Mariya'' was being given its first reading, and when he returned home he told me that all the actresses had been impatient to find out what the leading female role was like and who would be cast in it. It turned out that there was no leading female character present on the stage in this play. Babel thought that the play had not come off well, but he was always critical of his own work."&lt;ref&gt;Antonina Pirozhkova, ''At His Side; The Last Years of Isaac Babel'', Steerforth Press, 1996. Page 47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although intended to be performed by [[Moscow]]'s [[Vakhtangov Theatre]] in 1935, the premiere of ''Maria'' was cancelled by the [[NKVD]] during rehearsals. Four years later, Isaac Babel was arrested, tortured, and shot as part of [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Great Purge]]. His surviving manuscripts were confiscated by the NKVD and destroyed. As a result, ''Maria'' was never performed in Russia until after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].

==Structure==
The storyline of ''Maria'' is structured in an unconventional, [[nonlinear (arts)|nonlinear]] fashion. According to a cast member from the American premiere,&lt;blockquote&gt;"The play runs like a film — there are so many different [[Filming location|location]]s and [[Character (arts)|character]]s that you have to be very attentive. They even had to build a [[revolving stage]] in order to accommodate all of the changing locations in the story.... The play flows in a very subtle manner."&lt;ref&gt;[http://daily.stanford.edu/article/2004/2/26/babelsMariaMakesUsDebutAtPigott ''Maria'''s American Debut] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060915231505/http://daily.stanford.edu/article/2004/2/26/babelsMariaMakesUsDebutAtPigott |date=2006-09-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Legacy==
Although it was very popular at Western European colleges during the 1960s, it was not performed in Babel's homeland until 1994. An English translation by Harold Shukman and Michael Glenny was published by Penguin in 1966; a further translation by [[Peter Constantine]] appeared in 2002 and was edited by [[Nathalie Babel Brown]]. ''Maria'''s American premiere, directed by [[Carl Weber (theatre director)|Carl Weber]], took place at [[Stanford University]] two years later.

According to Weber, &lt;blockquote&gt;"The play is very controversial. [It] shows the stories of both sides clashing with each other during the [[Russian Civil War]] — the [[Bolshevik]]s and the [[Russian nobility|old society members]] — without making a judgment one way or another. Babel’s opinion on either side is very ambiguous, but he does make the statement that what happened after the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] may not have been the best thing for [[Russia]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://daily.stanford.edu/article/2004/2/26/babelsMariaMakesUsDebutAtPigott ''Maria'''s American Debut] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060915231505/http://daily.stanford.edu/article/2004/2/26/babelsMariaMakesUsDebutAtPigott |date=2006-09-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13811">Different languages use different terms for [[United States nationality law|citizens]] of the [[United States]], who are known in [[English language|English]] as [[Americans]]. All forms of English refer to United States citizens as Americans, a term deriving from the [[Americas]]. In the English context, it came to refer to inhabitants of [[British North America]] and then the United States.&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title= American, ''n.'' and ''adj.''|encyclopedia= [[Oxford English Dictionary]] |year= 2008 |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]]|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/6342?redirectedFrom=American&amp;|url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is some linguistic ambiguity over this use due to the other senses of the word [[American (word)|American]], which can also refer to people from the Americas in general.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2yJusP0vrdgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Merriam-Webster%27s+Dictionary+of+English+Usage#PPA87,M1 ''Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage'', p. 87]. Retrieved November 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Other languages, including [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Russian language|Russian]], use [[cognate]]s of American to refer to people from the United States while others, particularly [[Spanish language|Spanish]], primarily use terms derived from United States. There are various other local and colloquial names for Americans.

== Development of the term American ==
{{see also|American (word)}}
[[Amerigo Vespucci]] first demonstrated that Brazil and the West Indies did not represent Asia's eastern outskirts as conjectured by [[Christopher Columbus]], but instead constituted an entirely separate landmass hitherto unknown to the peoples of the [[Old World]]. [[Martin Waldseemüller]] coined the term America (in honor of Vespucci) in a [[Waldseemüller map|1507 world map]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Holloway, Thomas H.|title=A Companion to Latin American History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LdrBUR6jtIYC&amp;pg=PA6|year=2010|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Hoboken, NJ|isbn=978-1444338843|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First uses of the adjective American referenced European settlements in the [[New World]]. Americans referred to the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] and subsequently to European settlers and their descendants.&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt; English use of the term American for people of European descent dates to the 17th century, with the earliest recorded appearance being in [[Thomas Gage (clergyman)|Thomas Gage]]'s ''The English-American: A New Survey of the West Indies'' in 1648.&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt; In English, American came to be applied especially to people in [[British America]] and thus its use as a demonym for the United States derives by extension.&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt;

The [[United States Declaration of Independence]] of 1776 refers to "the thirteen {{Sic|united|expected=United}} States of America",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/national-archives-experience/charters/charters_downloads.html|title=The Charters of Freedom|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=2007-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; making the first formal use of the country name, which was officially adopted in 1777 by the nation's first governing constitution, the [[Articles of Confederation]].&lt;ref&gt;Articles of Confederation, Article 1. Available at the Library of Congress' [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&amp;fileName=001/llsl001.db&amp;recNum=127 American Memory].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Federalist Papers]] of 1787–1788, written by [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[John Jay]] and [[James Madison]] to advocate the ratification of the [[United States Constitution]], use the word "American" in both its original pan-American sense, but also in its United States sense: Federalist Paper 24 refers to the "American possessions" of Britain and Spain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa24.htm|title=The Federalist no. 24|author=Alexander Hamilton}}&lt;/ref&gt; (i.e. land outside of the United States) while Federalist Papers 51&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa51.htm|title=The Federalist no. 51|author=James Madison}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 70&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa70.htm|author=Alexander Hamilton|title=The Federalist no. 70}}&lt;/ref&gt; refer to the United States as "the American republic". People from the United States increasingly referred to themselves as Americans through the end of the 18th century and the 1795 Treaty of Peace and Amity with the [[Barbary States]] refers to "American Citizens"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/diplomacy/barbary/bar1795t.htm | title=The Barbary Treaties: Treaty of Peace and Amity}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[George Washington]] spoke to his people of "[t]he name of American, which belongs to you in your national capacity" in his [[George Washington's Farewell Address|1796 farewell address]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/washing.asp "Washington's Farewell Address 1796"]. From The Avalon Project. Retrieved November 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, this usage spread through other English-speaking countries and the unqualified noun American in all forms of the English language now chiefly refers to natives or citizens of the United States, though other senses are generally specified with a qualifier such as Latin American or North American.&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt;

== International use ==
International speakers of English generally refer to people from the United States as Americans while equivalent translations of American are used in many other languages, namely [[French language|French]] (''{{lang|fr|américain}}''), although the term ''{{lang|fr|étatsunien}}'' derived from ''{{lang|fr|États-Unis}}'' (United States) in French is also accepted, [[Dutch language|Dutch]] (''{{lang|nl|Amerikaan}}''), [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]] (''{{lang|af|Amerikaner}}''), [[Japanese language|Japanese]] ({{lang|ja|アメリカ人}}, [[rōmaji]]: ''amerika-jin''), [[Filipino language|Filipino]] (''{{lang|fil|Amerikano}}''), [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ({{lang|he|אמריקאי}}), [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ({{lang|ar|أمريكي}}) and [[Russian language|Russian]] ({{lang|ru|американец, американка}}).

In [[German language|German]], the designation ''{{lang|de|US-Amerikaner}}'' and its adjective form ''{{lang|de|US-amerikanisch}}'' are sometimes used, though ''{{lang|de|Amerikaner}}'' (adjective: ''{{lang|de|amerikanisch}}'') is more common in scientific, official, journalistic and colloquial parlance. The [[style manual]] of the ''[[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]]'', a leading German-language newspaper, dismisses the term ''U.S.-amerikanisch'' as both "unnecessary" and "artificial" and recommends replacing it with ''{{lang|de|amerikanisch}}''.&lt;ref&gt;''Vademecum. Der sprachlich-technische Leitfaden der «Neuen Zürcher Zeitung»'', 13th edition. Verlag Neue Zürcher Zeitung, Zürich 2013, p. 102, s. v. ''US-amerikanisch''.&lt;/ref&gt; The respective guidelines of the foreign ministries of Austria, Germany and Switzerland all dictate ''{{lang|de|Amerikaner/amerikanisch}}'' for official usage.&lt;ref&gt;Eidgenössisches Departement für auswärtige Angelegenheiten: [http://www.eda.admin.ch/etc/medialib/downloads/edazen/topics/intla/cintla.Par.0011.File.tmp/lt_080506_statenames_de.pdf „Liste der Staatenbezeichnungen“] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151103122940/https://www.eda.admin.ch/etc/medialib/downloads/edazen/topics/intla/cintla.Par.0011.File.tmp/lt_080506_statenames_de.pdf |date=2015-11-03 }} (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bundesministerium für europäische und internationale Angelegenheiten: [http://www.bmeia.gv.at/fileadmin/user_upload/oracle/staatennamen_de.pdf „Liste der Staatennamen und deren Ableitungen in den vom Bundesministerium für europäische und internationale Angelegenheiten verwendeten Formen“] (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Auswärtiges Amt: [http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/cae/servlet/contentblob/332368/publicationFile/3097/Staatennamen.pdf „Verzeichnis der Staatennamen für den amtlichen Gebrauch in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland“] (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ami'' is common in colloquial speech. In [[Italian language|Italian]], both ''{{lang|it|americano}}'' and ''{{lang|it|statunitense}}'' are used, although the former is more common.

In [[European Portuguese]], ''{{lang|pt|americano}}'' is mostly used in colloquial speech, but the term usually used in the press is ''{{lang|pt|norte-americano}}''. In [[Brazilian Portuguese]], the everyday term is usually ''{{lang|br|americano}}'' or ''{{lang|pt|norte-americano}}'' and ''{{lang|pt|estadunidense}}'' is the preferred form in [[academia]].

Chinese has distinct words for American in the continent sense and American in the United States sense. The United States is called {{lang|zh|美国}} ([[Pinyin]]: ''měiguó''; [[Jyutping]]: ''mei5 gwok3'') while the continent of America is called {{lang|zh|美洲}} ([[Pinyin]]: ''měizhōu''; [[Jyutping]]: ''mei5 zau1''). There are separate demonyms derived from each word and a United States citizen is referred to as {{lang|zh|美国人}} ([[Pinyin]]: ''měiguó rén''; [[Jyutping]]: ''mei5 gwok3 yan4'').

Although some Spanish speakers use the translation of American (''{{lang|es|americano}}'') as well, the official ''{{lang|es|Diccionario Panhispánico de Dudas de la [[Real Academia Española]]}}'' nonetheless recommends instead ''{{lang|es|estadounidense}}'' (literally United Statesian) because American can also refer to all of the inhabitants of the continents of North and South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} "El gentilicio recomendado, por ser el de uso mayoritario, es estadounidense" [http://buscon.rae.es/dpdI/SrvltConsulta?lema=Estados Unidos Estados Unidos (3)] RAE. Retrieved March 31, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In Spanish-speaking Latin America and the Caribbean, Americans may be referred to as ''americanos'' or ''{{lang|es|estadounidenses}}'' and in colloquial uses ''{{lang|es|gringos}}'', but the latter word usually has a disparaging meaning depending on the context in which it is used.

== Alternative terms ==
The only officially and commonly used alternative for referring to the people of the United States in English is to refer to them as citizens of that country.&lt;ref name="Columbia"&gt;Wilson, Kenneth G.

'''Nuribta''', also '''Nuribda''', was a city, or [[city-state]] located in the vicinity of [[Megiddo (place)|Magiddo]] in Israel, in historical [[Canaan]] during the time of the [[Amarna letters]] [[Text corpus|correspondence]], a 15-20 year [[Time period|period]] of about [[1350 BC|1350]]-[[1335 BC]].

The majority of the Amarna letters were written to the [[pharaoh]] of [[Ancient Egypt]] and the only reference to ''Naribta'' is a letter by [[Biridiya]] of ''Magidda'', EA 365, entitled: ''"Furnishing corvée workers"'', ([[EA (el Amarna)|EA]] is for 'el [[Amarna]]').

Starn was involved in the repatriation to California of the remains of [[Ishi]], the last [[Yahi]] Indian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20000108/bob8.asp |title=Ishi's Long Road Home |accessdate=2007-12-12|date=2000-01-08|work=Science News Online |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071017055529/http://sciencenews.org/articles/20000108/bob8.asp &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This search was reported in the ''[[New York Times]]'' and [[NPR]], and Starn's book ''Ishi's Brain'' gives an account of it as well as the story of Ishi's life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orinstarn.com Ishi's Brain: In Search of America's Last "Wild" Indian&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Ishi's Brain'' was a ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' Best Book of 2004.&lt;ref&gt;

He has also written extensively about [[Internal conflict in Peru|the war]] and society in [[Peru]], including both ''Nightwatch'' and ''The Peru Reader'' as well as several books in Spanish.  A book Starn co-edited with Marisol de la Cadena, ''Indigenous Experience Today,'' explores the global rise of indigenous politics and activism.

==Sports and Society==
Starn has done research on [[sports and society]], and appeared on [[ESPN]] and various [[sports talk show]]s. Starn is currently writing a book about the history and politics of [[golf]] in America, and maintains a related blog at [http://www.golfpolitics.blogspot.com Golf Politics].  In March 2007, he hosted a conference called ''Tiger Woods ©: American Empire, Global Golf and the Making of a Megacelebrity''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dukenews.duke.edu/2007/03/tiger.html | title=Panel at Duke to Examine Tiger Woods' Cultural Impact | accessdate=2007-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Duke Athletics and the Lacrosse Case ==
Starn wrote op-eds in North Carolina newspapers about the [[2006 Duke University lacrosse case]] (among them, ''Let's talk sports''&lt;ref name="NandOTalk"&gt;[http://www.newsobserver.com/691/story/456646.html Let's talk sports]&lt;/ref&gt;) and was quoted in other outlets, including ''[[The New Yorker]]''
&lt;ref name="NewYorker"&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/09/04/060904fa_fact  Big Men On Campus]&lt;/ref&gt; and 
''[[The News &amp; Observer]]''.
&lt;ref name="NewsObserver"&gt;
[http://www.newsobserver.com/news/crime_safety/duke_lacrosse/story/452978.html Coach K speaks up for sports]
&lt;/ref&gt;

During the case, Starn took issue with some of Duke Basketball Coach [[Mike Krzyzewski]]'s actions.  In a June 21, 2006 article in ''[[The News &amp; Observer]]'', Starn was quoted as stating, "Whether Coach Krzyzewski likes it or not, these are serious issues and issues being raised at colleges around the country."&lt;ref name="NewsObserver" /&gt;  He also accused bloggers of inaccurately portraying the involvement of Duke faculty in the [[lacrosse]] case in a January 2007 op-ed in the ''[[Durham Herald-Sun]]''.

Starn has cited the incident in his criticism of Duke's participation in [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] athletics.  In another ''News &amp; Observer'' article, Starn was quoted as stating, "It's ridiculous to talk about a balance between athletics and academics... [[College athletics|Athletics]] should be a subset underneath a university's main mission... The idea that athletics should have near-equal weight with academics is just wrong." &lt;ref name="NandOSports"&gt;[http://www.newsobserver.com/news/crime_safety/duke_lacrosse/story/434033.html Sports in crosshairs of campus debates]&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Not to be confused with the same artist's [[Penitent Magdalene (Titian, 1533)|1531 version]] of the same subject.''
The '''''Penitent Magdalene''''' is a 1565 oil painting by [[Titian]] of saint [[Mary Magdalene]], now in the [[Hermitage Museum]] in [[Saint Petersburg]]. Unlike his 1531 version of the same subject, Titian has covered Mary's nudity and introduced a vase, an open book and a skull as a [[memento mori]]. Its colouring is more mature than the earlier work, using colours harmonising with character. In the background the sky is bathed in the rays of the setting sun, with a dark rock contrasting with the brightly lit figure of Mary.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3041">'''Phallic monism''' is a term introduced by [[Chasseguet-Smirgel]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Nancy Chodorow]] ''Gender and Sexuality'' (2012) p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; to refer to the theory that in both sexes the male organ — i.e. the question of possessing the penis or not — was the key to [[psychosexual development]].&lt;ref&gt;J.-M. Quinodoz, ''Reading Freud'' (2005) p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory was upheld by [[Sigmund Freud]]. His critics maintain it was a result of an unconscious adherence to an infantile sexual theory.&lt;ref&gt;Quinodoz, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freud==
Freud identified as the central theme of the [[phallic stage]] a state of mind in which "''maleness'' exists, but not femaleness. The antithesis here is between having ''a male genital'' and being castrated".&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Sexuality'' (PFL 7) p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that the mind-set was shared both by little boys and little girls&lt;ref&gt;''On Sexuality'', pp. 320-1&lt;/ref&gt; — a viewpoint confirmed by the orthodox strand of his following, as epitomised for example in the work of [[Otto Fenichel]].&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 79-80&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud considered such phallic monism to be at the core of neurosis to the very end of his career.&lt;ref&gt;Quinodoz, p. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critics==
Trenchant early criticism of Freud's monism was made by [[Karen Horney]], who suggested that the psychoanalytic view had itself become fixated at the level of the small boy aggrandising himself at his sister's expense.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ''Freud'' (1989) p. 520-1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ernest Jones]] too was quick to maintain that woman was not, as Freud seemed to suggest, "''un homme manqué''...struggling to console herself with secondary substitutes alien to her true nature".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Adam Phillips, ''On Flirtation'' (1994) p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Lacan]] reformulated Freud's phallic monism through his theory of the phallus as signifier;&lt;ref&gt;Quinodoz, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Melanie Klein|Kleinians]], post-Kleinians, and those influenced by [[second-wave feminism]] have all articulated a more positive view of femininity, articulating the belief in phallic monism as a survival into adulthood of a (male) infantile sexual theory.&lt;ref&gt;Quinodoz, p. 181-2 and p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

Phallic monism has also been linked to [[sexual fetishism]], fueled by an over-aggressive [[super-ego]].&lt;ref&gt;Alan Bass, ''Difference and Disavowal'' (2000) p. 31-2 and p. 203-4&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== ''Student Canteen'' (1958–1965) ===
{{main|Student Canteen}}
'''''[[Student Canteen]]''''' was the first noontime variety show on [[Television in the Philippines|Philippine television]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tkRaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ZSUMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2897,15772132|title=Philippine Daily Inquirer - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally a radio show on DZXL that was brought to CBN in 1958. It was hosted by Eddie Ilarde, Bobby Ledesma, Leila Benitez, and Bobby de Veyra. The pioneer noontime show ended in 1965 when Ilarde went to politics. It was succeeded by several noontime shows until its comeback in 1975.

=== ''Student Canteen''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s successors (1965–1975) ===
''Magandang Tanghali'', a musical variety show hosted by [[Pancho Magalona]], and ''Stop Look and Listen'', a former noontime variety show hosted by [[Eddie Mesa]] took over Student Canteen's timeslot in 1965. After Eddie left for the US, ''Twelve O'Clock High'', a show hosted by [[Ariel Ureta]] and Tina Revilla-Valencia), premiered and aired until 1972 when [[Martial law in the Philippines|Martial Law]] was declared . ABS-CBN and other TV stations were shut down by the Marcos regime. The show moved to RBS (now GMA Network) as ''Ariel con Tina'', a blocktimer by a company headed by Romy Jalosjos from 1972 to 1974. ''Lunch Break'' also gained ground on the same channel before ''Student Canteen'' was eventually revived.

=== ''Student Canteen''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s revival and the birth of ''Eat Bulaga!'' (1975–present) ===
''Student Canteen'' was revived in 1975 and was aired on [[GMA Network]]. It was hosted by its former main hosts Eddie Ilarde, Bobby Ledesma, and Pepe Pimentel with new co-hosts Helen Vela and Coney Reyes. The famous comic trio of [[Tito Sotto]], [[Vic Sotto]], and [[Joey de Leon]] (collectively known as TVJ) became pinch hitters on ''Student Canteen'' when the some of the main hosts were on leave. ''Student Canteen'' is the only noontime variety show on Philippine television from 1975 to 1979. Production Specialists, Inc. offered TVJ to host a new noontime show for RPN in 1979. After some misunderstandings with the ''Student Canteen''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s main hosts, they decided to accept the offer and ''Eat Bulaga!'' aired its first episode on July 30, 1979. Tito, Vic, and Joey was accompanied by Richie D' Horsie and Chiqui Hollmann.

==== Competition ====
Two-way competition between noontime shows started in 1979 when ''Eat Bulaga!'' (first aired in RPN 9) was pitted against ''Student Canteen'' (aired on GMA 7). Since then, ''Eat Bulaga!'' had faced several rivalries with other noontime shows through the years.

===== ''Student Canteen'' (1979–1986) =====
''Eat... Bulaga!'' struggled on its ratings due to lack of advertisers on its first year of airing due to ''Student Canteen''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s stronghold on television. ''EB'' was in danger of cancellation until "Mr. Macho" was launched in 1980, which made ''Bulaga'' surpassed the ratings of its rival. ''Eat... Bulaga!'' was aired nationwide in 1982 with the launch of RPN's domestic satellite, which also coincided with Coney Reyes' transfer to ''EB'' and Chiqui Hollman to ''Student Canteen''. Other fresh faces were introduced in ''Student Canteen'' but the show was eventually cancelled in March 1986, days after the People Power Revolution. ''Student Canteen'' was again revived in 1989 but it was cancelled again in 1990 due to misunderstanding with RPN's management.

===== ''[[Lunch Date]]'' (1986–1993) =====
''Lunch Date'' became ''Student Canteen''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s successor in 1986. Its original hosts were Orly Mercado, Rico J. Puno, Toni Rose Gayda and Chiqui Hollmann. When the show was reformatted after a year, it only retained both Gayda and Hollman and brought in a mix of old and new faces to host the show, including Randy Santiago, Keno, Lito Pimentel, Tina Revilla, Pilita Corrales, Louie Heredia, Sheryl Cruz, Jon Santos, Dennis Padilla, Fe Delos Reyes, Manilyn Reynes, Willie Revillame and Ai Ai de las Alas. The show introduced new segments that will challenge ''EB''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s reign in the noontime slot.

In 1987, Aiza Seguerra, a Little Miss Philippines winner, joined the show and became an instant hit to viewers. In 1989, ''Eat... Bulaga!'' moved to ABS-CBN due to RPN's sequestration under the Cory Aquino administration. ''Eat... Bulaga!'' (together with other new shows launched) helped ABS-CBN to attain its status as the No. 1 TV network from being No. 4. It also started the rivalry of GMA Network and ABS-CBN in the noontime slot that still exist until today. In 1993, GMA Network's management decided to reformat their own noontime show and replaced it by ''[[SST: Salo-Salo Together]]''. According to Joey de Leon, ''Lunch Date'' was their toughest opponent ever because it was pitted against ''EB'' for more than 7 years, the longest compared to other noontime shows.

===== ''[[SST: Salo-Salo Together]]'' (1993–1995) =====
''SST'' was first aired on March 20, 1993 as a replacement for ''[[Lunch Date]]'', hosted by [[Randy Santiago]], [[Dennis Padilla]], and Smokey Manaloto with [[Liezl Martinez]], Anjanette Abayari, Joy Ortega and Giselle Sanchez as co-hosts. In less than six months after it aired, SST started to take over ''[[Eat Bulaga!|Eat... Bulaga!]]'' in the ratings by providing fresh interactive segments. Comedians Ai-Ai delas Alas and Bayani Agbayani also became co-hosts of ''SST''.

It started as a [[blind item]] as 1994 was about to end, until showbiz news had leaked out that ''SST'' was going to go off the air to give way to ''Eat... Bulaga!'' at the 12 pm slot, after ''EB'' itself had decided to move to GMA Network following their contract with ABS-CBN was bogged down. During ''SST''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s New Year episode on December 31, 1994, the announcement of the new variety show's move to GMA was officially made by main hosts Randy Santiago and Dennis Padilla. The hosts and talents were sad because they felt the GMA Network management did not give them a chance to prove that they could carry the noontime show to new heights. But at the same time, they felt happy because the management decided to keep the show after they decided to move ''SST'' to an earlier time slot, as a pre-programming to ''Eat... Bulaga!''. SST made its last noontime episode on January 27, 1995. In June 1995, ''SST'' was permanently cancelled.

===== [['Sang Linggo nAPO Sila|''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'Sang Linggo nAPO Sila'']] (1995–1998) =====
Due to ''Eat... Bulaga!''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s moved to rival GMA Network, ABS-CBN decided to make ''[[Sa Linggo nAPO Sila]]'' a weeklong noontime show as ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'Sang Linggo nAPO SIla''. It aired its pilot episode on February 4, 1995 led by the famous APO Hiking Society, TVJ's former co-stars in ''OK Lang,'' a defunct TV show on IBC 13. During its first year, ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'Sang Linggo'' was winning the ratings game in the provinces and cities where ABS-CBN have stronger signal. But the real challenge to the show was to deviate its content from the usual noontime variety show that ''Eat... Bulaga!'' presented to the viewers for almost two decades. Meanwhile, ''Bulaga'' had presented new faces like Allan K., Jose Manalo, and Donna Cruz, and new segments such as Super SiReyna and Philippine Bulaga Association. Calendar Girl was introduced by ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'Sang Linggo nAPO Sila'' in 1998 with John Estrada, Randy Santiago, and Willie Revillame handling the segment by delivering naughtier jokes on TV.

The rating for ''SLNS'' had improved but the main hosts did not sit well with the changes on their show. Eventually, ABS-CBN had ended again its own noontime show (due to criticisms that the show was too intelligent for an average Filipino) on November 28, 1998 with ''Magandang Tanghali Bayan'' taking place with its main hosts: Randy, John, and Willie.

===== ''[[MTB (Philippine variety show)|Magandang Tanghali Bayan]]'' (1998–2003) =====
After the APO had failed to beat the continuing supremacy of ''EB'', the new triumvirate of Randy, John, and Willie was pitted to the established trio of Tito, Vic, and Joey as ABS-CBN launched its new noontime show on November 30, 1998 with the title ''Magandang Tanghali Bayan''. Its highlight segment, ''Pera O Bayong'', made ''MTB'' overtook ''Eat... Bulaga!''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s ratings for years. Due to the growing popularity of the show, ''EB'' gave its first millions on television through its new segments ''Meron O Wala'' and the all-time popular segment ''Laban O Bawi'' which featured the phenomenal all-female dance group ''Sexbomb Girls''. Meanwhile, ''MTB'' had faced numerous controversies and suspensions including the one-week suspension of the show in August 1999 due to the notorious green jokes of the main hosts. During that week, the show was replaced by ''Esep-Esep''. In 2001, Willie Revillame was axed on the show which resulted to major changes on the set of new hosts and segments. ''MTB'' had lost its victory in terms of ratings to ''EB'', which lead to its second incarnation, ''Masayang Tanghali Bayan''.

===== ''[[MTB (Philippine variety show)|Masayang Tanghali Bayan]]'' (2003–2004) =====
''Magandang Tanghali Bayan'' aired its last episode on February 21, 2003 and was replaced by ''Masayang Tanghali Bayan'' to cope-up with the noontime competition against ''Eat... Bulaga!''. The new MTB premiered on February 22, 2003 with Randy, John, and Willie making their comeback on the noontime slot together with other co-hosts Dennis Padilla, Aiai delas Alas, Bayani Agbayani, Mickey Ferriols, Aubrey Miles, Tado, and Bentong. The show had given out more cash prizes than its predecessor through the segments ''Super Jack En Poy'' and ''Urong Sulong''. Before the end of 2003, Willie Revillame resigned from the show in the midst of controversy regarding his derogatory joke against their co-host Mahal. The show continued to air until February 2004 with comedian Vhong Navarro and actor-host Edu Manzano taking over Willie's place. However, ''Masayang Tanghali Bayan'' failed to sustain viewership and was given the axe on February 20, 2004, two days before their first anniversary on television.

===== ''[[MTB (Philippine variety show)|MTB: Ang Saya Saya]]'' (2004–2005) =====
The third incarnation of ''MTB'', entitled ''MTB: Ang Saya Saya'' premiered on February 21, 2004 with Ai ai delas Alas, Edu Manzano, and Arnell Ignacio as its main hosts. The show also introduced new set of co-hosts and segments, especially reality talent-based search segments. However, these efforts were overshadowed by the spectacular ''Silver Anniversary Special'' of ''Eat Bulaga!'' which got the all-time highest rating of a noontime show exceeding to 30%. On November 15, 2004, ''MTB: Ang Saya Saya'' lost its 12:00pm slot to Kris Aquino's ''[[Pilipinas, Game KNB?]]'' and started airing as an afternoon variety show on a 1:00pm time slot as the network's strategic move against the anniversary special, but it had failed. After months of low ratings, the management decided to permanently cancelled the third incarnation of ''MTB'' on February 4, 2005 and launched a new noontime show under its new main host Willie Revillame.

===== ''[[Wowowee]]'' (2005–2010) =====
Due to public clamor, former ''MTB'' main host Willie Revillame made his comeback on the noontime slot with the new noontime show entitled ''Wowowee'' on February 5, 2005. ABS-CBN's strong reach in the Philippines and worldwide through TFC had helped ''Wowowee'' to lead the noontime race for years. Willie's novelty songs became popular because of ''Wowowee'' and it became an instant hit to the Filipino masses.

''Wowowee'' also faced different controversies on its five-year run on television. The ULTRA Stampede which happened during the first anniversary of the show, lead to the death of 71 people. The [[Guinness World Records]] cited the incident as "the greatest death toll in a game show". Another controversy was the Hello Papi Scandal, wherein Revillame allegedly cheated a contestant during the jackpot round on one of the ''Wowowee''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s game segments. The scandal also lead to a word war on-air between Willie and one of the ''EB''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s main hosts Joey de Leon.

The competition became harder for ''Eat Bulaga!'' so they decided to have a different approach on celebrating their 30th anniversary in 2009 by honoring different people from different fields, giving scholarships to honor students, and constructing classrooms for public schools in different provinces. ''EB'' also renovated their studio to accommodate more studio audience, install LED screens, and to commemorate the first death anniversary of Francis Magalona on March 6, 2010. ''Eat Bulaga!'' also launched its widely popular segment ''Juan for All, All for Juan: Bayanihan of D' Pipol'' (a regular segment which broadcasts from different barangays).

On May 4, 2010, Willie challenged the ABS-CBN management to remove Jobert Sucaldito (radio/TV host) or he will resign from the noontime show due to Sucaldito's criticisms against Revillame and the show itself. SInce May 5, Willie did not appeared on ''Wowowee'' and it became an indefinite leave after numerous days. After negotiations between Revillame and the network, the network decided that ''Wowowee'' will air its final episode on July 30, 2010 (coinciding with ''Eat Bulaga!''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s 31st anniversary). The show was replaced by ''Pilipinas Win Na Win''. ''Wowowee'' become the ABS-CBN's longest-running noontime show that was pitted against ''Eat Bulaga!''. Willie is currently on GMA Network, hosting ''Wowowin'', a primetime variety game show with the same format with ''Wowowee''.

===== ''[[Pilipinas Win Na Win]]'' (2010) =====
After the cancellation of ''Wowowee'', ''Pilipinas Win Na Win'' premiered on July 31, 2010 with Kris Aquino and Robin Padilla as its main hosts, together with other co-hosts from ''Wowowee''. Some of the shows staff left the show to join Willie's comeback on TV5 in October 2010. Suffering a plague of low ratings since launch, ABS-CBN asked Kris mid-September for her to leave the show, and so she quietly left the show without any goodbyes on September 30, 2010. Two days later on October 2, ABS-CBN officially announced four new hosts and two new co-hosts. The four hosts tagged as the "hitmakers" include [[Rico J. Puno]], [[Rey Valera]], [[Marco Sison]], and [[Nonoy Zuniga]].

After a battle of constant low ratings and many alternate time slots, ''Pilipinas Win Na Win'' ended on December 31, 2010 during the New Year celebration. The cancellation was announced by [[Rico J. Puno]] several times during the December 20 episode. Rumors of this issue were around entertainment websites from interviews of a fellow co-host, [[Valerie Concepcion]] before the network announced its cancellation. Its time slot was temporarily occupied by [[Showtime (Philippines)|''Showtime'']]. On February 12, 2011, a new noontime show was aired entitled ''[[Happy Yipee Yehey!]]''. The show was ABS-CBN's shortest-lived noontime show.

===== ''[[Happy Yipee Yehey!]]'' (2011–2012) =====
The unsuccessful stint of ''PWNW'' was immediately replaced by ''Happy Yipee Yehey'' which premiered on February 12, 2011. Before its premiere, Willie Revillame (at that time, he was hosting ''Willing Willie'' on TV5) challenged its upcoming host John Estrada that the ''HYY'' will not reach its success in terms of ratings and Revillame will promote ''Eat Bulaga!'' constantly on his show. ''HYY'' was hosted by former ''MTB'' hosts John Estrada and Randy Santiago, Toni Gonzaga, Rico J. Puno, Pokwang, and others. The new noontime show introduced segments similar to its predecessors like ''Pera O Bayong'', ''My Girl'', ''Miss Kasamabahay'', etc.

Revillame's prediction came to reality. ''HYY'' constantly got low ratings because of ''Eat Bulaga!''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s stronghold to its noontime viewership. On January 2012, ''Showtime'' was cancelled on its late morning slot and it was later revealed that ''Showtime'' will be formatted into a new noontime variety show, replacing ''HYY''. ''Happy Yipee Yehey'' aired its final episode on February 4, 2012 to give way to ABS-CBN's new noontime show, ''It's Showtime''.

===== [[It's Showtime (variety show)|''It's Showtime'']] (2012–present) =====
''&lt;nowiki/&gt;Showtime'', a morning talent show, was transferred to the noontime slot as ''It's Showtime'' on February 6, 2012.The new noontime show introduced segments from the ''Showtime'' series and new segments like ''Sine Mo 'To'', ''AdVice Ganda'', ''That's My Tomboy'', ''I Am PoGay'', and ''Magpasikat''. The show was hosted by Vice Ganda, Anne Curtis, Vhong Navarro, Jhong Hilario, Karylle, Ryan Bang, Mariel Rodriguez, Amy Perez, Jugs and Teddy. Currently, they feature the segments Tawag ng Tanghalan and Ms. Q&amp;A which they launched as an answer to Eat Bulaga's hit segment, Quiz Vee, but despite their trend Eat Bulaga continues to dominate the ratings game.

== Sunday noontime shows ==
Currently, ABS-CBN's ''ASAP'' now holds the record of being the longest-running Sunday noontime variety show which was first aired in 1995 when ''Eat Bulaga!'' moved to GMA Network and the Sunday noontime show ''[[Sa Linggo nAPO Sila]]'' became a weeklong noontime show. During its 22nd anniversary, ''ASAP'' already surpassed the record of ''[[GMA Supershow]]'' as the longest-running Sunday noontime variety show.

Its current rival program is ''Sunday PinaSaya'' aired on GMA Network and co-produced by [[APT Entertainment]], a subsidiary of [[TAPE Inc.]] (the producer of the longest-running noontime show, ''Eat Bulaga!'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pep.ph/guide/tv/19872/battle-of-noontime-shows-asap-versus-sunday-pinasaya-comedy-routines|title=BATTLE OF NOONTIME SHOWS: ASAP versus Sunday Pinasaya comedy routines|last=Luciano|first=Elvin|access-date=2017-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''SPS'' aired its pilot episode in August 2015 as a replacement to ''Sunday All Stars''.

'''Rhind Lectures''' are a series of lectures on archaeological topics. They have been hosted by the [[Society of Antiquaries of Scotland]] since 1874. The content of the lectures is usually published in journals or expanded into new works by their authors.

The name commemorates [[Alexander Henry Rhind]], whose bequest to the society funded this lectureship. Rhind directed that his estate be used for this purpose, once the interests of living parties was extinguished, which took place 11 years after his death in 1863.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Rhind, Alexander Henry}}&lt;/ref&gt; The speaker and subject is selected years in advance, allowing the speaker to give a detailed exposition of a topic in their area of expertise.

The Rhind Lectures have continued into the [[21st century]], and since 2009 the society has published a video file that is freely available to the public.&lt;ref name="SAS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socantscot.org/articles.asp?pubid=87|title=The Rhind Lectures|work=Society's Website|publisher=Society of Antiquaries of Scotland|accessdate=27 November 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206135533/http://www.socantscot.org/articles.asp?pubid=87|archivedate=6 December 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sanghol''' is a historical village located in [[Fatehgarh Sahib District]]of [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]], India predating to Harrapan civilisation. It is also known as Uchha Pind Sanghol. It is about 40&amp;nbsp;km from [[Chandigarh]] on the way to [[Ludhiana]] and approximately 10&amp;nbsp;km from [[Dholewal]]. This place holds a special position on the archaeological atlas of India.&lt;ref&gt;http://asi.nic.in/asi_exca_indi_punjab.asp&lt;/ref&gt; Excavations at the site have yielded [[coins]] and [[seal (device)|seals]] related to [[Toramana]] and [[Mihirakula]] belonging to central Asia. A [[Buddhist]] [[stupa]] was excavated in 1968, but in February 1985 a rich treasure of 117 beautiful carved stone slabs,which includes 69 pillars, 35 crossbars, figures and figurines, was excavated by the experts of the [[Directorate of Archaeology]], Punjab. Scholars have explained them as [[Kushan]] sculptures of the [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]] school of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD. These treasures have since been displayed for art lovers and historians in [[Sanghol Museum]]. Many of the art pieces from this museum often go on display as special exhibits at various museums around the world.

Situated on the top of a mound, Ucha Pind Sanghol is spread over an area of 200&amp;nbsp;km.

==Museum==
Sanghol is famed for the Sanghol Museum. A large of number of relics dating from the late [[Indus Valley Civilization|Harappan]] civilization (1720  – 1300 BC) to 6th century AD is found here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fatehgarhsahib.nic.in/sanghol.htm |title=Fatehgarhsahib website (govt.owned) |publisher=Fatehgarhsahib.nic.in |date=1990-04-10 |accessdate=2012-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 15000 artefacts were collected from this site and majority of them are displayed in this museum.

Sanghol also known as Uchha Pind is a famous village in the area. There are some mythical stories about the destruction of this village. The main village sits very high clearly visible from the surrounding towns. It is also linked to the Kissa "Roop Basant" stories as well. Some people from surrounding villages say that its ancient name was Sangla-deep.

There is a Buddhist Stupa and Monastery Complex dating back to 1st and 2nd century AD situated on the main road.

'''Sexual assault''' is an act in which a person intentionally sexually touches another person without that person's [[consent]], or [[Coercion|coerces]] or physically forces a person to engage in a [[sexual act]] against their will.&lt;ref name="Cameron"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Peter Cameron, George Jelinek, Anne-Maree Kelly, Anthony F.

''See also Ibbs v The Queen'', High Court of Australia, 61 ALJR 525, 1987 WL 714908 (sexual assault defined as sexual penetration without consent); Sexual Offences Act 2003 Chapter 42 s 3 Sexual assault (United Kingdom), (sexual assault defined as sexual contact without consent), ''and Chase v. R.'' 1987 CarswellNB 25 (Supreme Court of Canada) (sexual assault defined as force without consent of a sexual nature)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--Hidden because it sounds ridiculous to most people except maybe lawyers, who can rephrase this legalese better to say that sexual assault is of course an offense in all countries despite being defined differently in different countries and at different times: In legal terms, sexual assault is a [[statutory]] offense in various jurisdictions, including the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[England and Wales]], [[Ireland]], and [[Scotland]]. The legal definition of the crime of sexual assault is determined by each [[jurisdiction]]. Specific legal jurisdictions and research often use highly technical or detailed definitions of the term.--&gt;

== Definition ==
Generally, sexual assault is defined as unwanted sexual contact. The [[Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network]] defines sexual assault as "unwanted sexual contact that stops short of rape or attempted rape. This includes sexual touching and fondling."&lt;ref name="RAINN" /&gt;

The National Center for Victims of Crime states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.victimsofcrime.org/our-programs/dna-resource-center/sexual-assault-kit-backlog-reduction/about-sexual-assault#1 |title=The National Center for Victims of Crime – Library/Document Viewer |publisher=Ncvc.org |accessdate=9 December 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120720051156/http://www.victimsofcrime.org/our-programs/dna-resource-center/sexual-assault-kit-backlog-reduction/about-sexual-assault#1 |archivedate=20 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Sexual assault takes many forms including attacks such as rape or attempted rape, as well as any unwanted sexual contact or threats. Usually a sexual assault occurs when someone touches any part of another person's body in a sexual way, even through clothes, without that person's consent.}}

In the [[United States]], the definition of sexual assault varies widely among the individual states. However, in most states sexual assault occurs when there is lack of consent from one of the individuals involved. Consent must take place between two adults who are not incapacitated and can change during any time during the sexual act.

Approximately 30 percent of the perpetrators are relatives of the child- most often brothers, fathers, mothers, sisters and uncles or cousins. Around 60 percent are other acquaintances such as friends of the family, babysitters, or neighbors. Strangers are the offenders in approximately 10 percent of child sexual abuse cases.&lt;ref name=Whealin /&gt;

Studies have shown that the psychological damage is particularly severe when sexual assault is committed by parents against children due to the incestuous nature of the assault.&lt;ref name="Courtois" /&gt; Incest between a child or adolescent and a related adult has been identified as the most widespread form of child sexual abuse with a huge capacity for damage to a child.&lt;ref name="Courtois" /&gt; Often, sexual assault on a child is not reported by the child for several of the following reasons:

*children are too young to recognize their victimization or put it into words
*they were threatened or bribed by the abuser
*they feel confused by fearing the abuser
*they are afraid no one will believe them
*they blame themselves or believe the abuse is a punishment
*they feel guilty for consequences to the perpetrator&lt;ref name="pcar.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcar.org/about-sexual-violence/stats?cat=Child+Sexual+Abuse|title=About Sexual Violence|website=Pcar.org|accessdate=2016-09-10|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020184952/http://www.pcar.org/about-sexual-violence/stats?cat=Child+Sexual+Abuse|archivedate=20 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Domestic violence ===
{{Main|Domestic violence}}
Domestic violence is a crime of power and intimidation. It is strongly correlated with sexual assault. Not only can domestic abuse be emotional, physical, psychological and financial, but it can be sexual. Some of the signs of sexual abuse are similar to those of domestic violence.&lt;ref name=womensaidfederationofengland&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.womensaid.org.uk/domestic_violence_topic.asp?section=0001000100220022&amp;item |title=Sexual Violence |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402123718/http://www.womensaid.org.uk/domestic_violence_topic.asp?section=0001000100220022&amp;item |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Elderly sexual assault ===
{{Main|Elder abuse}}
Elderly sexual assault is [[victimization]] of persons over the age of 60, most of whom suffer from decreased functionality, frailty and weakness, and therefore are reliant on caretakers. Only 30 percent of people age 65 or older who are victimized report the assault to the police. The most common assailants are caretakers, adult children, spouses and fellow facility residents.
Signs that an elder is being assaulted include increased vaginal tearing, bleeding, bruising, infection, pelvic injury, soft tissue or bone injury. Also, an altered mood might be an indication of sexual assault. These symptoms include extreme agitation, post-traumatic stress disorder, withdrawal, panic attacks, STDs, exacerbation of existing illness, sleep disturbances and longer recovery times.&lt;ref name="pcar.org" /&gt;

=== Groping ===
{{Main|Groping}}
The term ''groping'' is used to define the touching or fondling of another person in a sexual way without the person's consent. Groping may occur under or over clothing.

=== Rape ===
{{Main|Rape}}

Outside of law, the term rape, "an [[assault]] by a person involving [[sexual intercourse]] with another person without that person's [[consent]]", is often used interchangeably with sexual assault.&lt;ref name="Victimology: Theories and Applications"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roberts, Albert R. |author2=Ann Wolbert Bergess |author3=CHERYL REGEHR |title=Victimology: Theories and Applications |publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers |location=Sudbury, Mass |year=2009 |page=228 |isbn=978-0-7637-7210-9 |oclc= |url=https://books.google.com/?id=erFiYbLL9McC&amp;pg=PA225&amp;dq=definition+of+rape&amp;q=definition%20of%20rape |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Violence against women"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/jech.2004.022756 |title=Violence against women |year=2005 |last1=Krantz |first1=G. |journal=Journal of Epidemiology &amp; Community Health |volume=59 |issue=10 |pages=818–21 |pmid=16166351 |last2=Garcia-Moreno |first2=C |pmc=1732916}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although closely related, the two terms are technically distinct in most jurisdictions.

Abbey ''et al.'' state that female victims are much more likely to be assaulted by an acquaintance, such as a friend or co-worker, a dating partner, an ex-boyfriend or a husband or other intimate partner than by a complete stranger.&lt;ref name="Abbey"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.2004.00149.x |pmid=26257466 |title=Similarities and Differences in Women's Sexual Assault Experiences Based on Tactics Used by the Perpetrator |year=2004 |last1=Abbey |first1=Antonia |last2=Beshears |first2=Renee |last3=Clinton-Sherrod |first3=A.

=== Sexual harassment ===
{{Main|Sexual harassment}}
Sexual harassment is [[intimidation]], [[bullying]] or [[coercion]] of a sexual nature. It may also be defined as the unwelcome or inappropriate promise of rewards in exchange for sexual favors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Paludi | first = Michele Antoinette | authorlink = |author2=Barickman, | title = Academic and Workplace Sexual Harassment | publisher = SUNY Press | year = 1991 | location = | pages = 2–5 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-7914-0829-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, sexual harassment is a form of discrimination which violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The legal and social definition of what constitutes sexual harassment differ widely by culture. Sexual harassment includes a wide range of behaviors from seemingly mild transgressions to serious forms of abuse. Some forms of sexual harassment overlap with sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;Dziech et al. 1990, Boland 2002&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC): "Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitutes sexual harassment when submission to or rejection of this conduct explicitly or implicitly affects an individual's employment, unreasonably interferes with an individual's work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts About Sexual Harassment|url=https://www.eeoc.gov/facts/fs-sex.html|website=U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission|accessdate=18 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170711064654/https://www.eeoc.gov/facts/fs-sex.html|archivedate=11 July 2017|df=dmy-all|date=2002-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*79% of victims are women, 21% are men
** 51% are harassed by a supervisor
** Business, Trade, Banking, and Finance are the biggest industries where sexual harassment occurs
** 12% received threats of termination if they did not comply with their requests
* 26,000 people in the armed forces were assaulted in 2012&lt;sup&gt;[[Sexual harassment|[18]]]&lt;/sup&gt;
** 302 of the 2,558 cases pursued by victims were prosecuted
** 38% of the cases were committed by someone of a higher rank
* Sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination that violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
** [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]] is a federal law that prohibits employers from discriminating against employees on the basis of sex, race, color, national origin, and religion. It generally applies to employers with 15 or more employees, including federal, state, and local governments. Title VII also applies to private and public colleges and universities, employment agencies, and labor organizations.&lt;sup&gt;[[Sexual harassment|[19]]]&lt;/sup&gt;
** "It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer … to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin."&lt;sup&gt;[[Sexual harassment|[20]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

=== Mass sexual assault ===
{{further|Mass sexual assault}}
Mass sexual assault takes place in public places and in crowds. It involves large groups of men surrounding and assaulting a woman, groping, manual penetration, and [[Non-penetrative sex#Frottage|frottage]], but usually stopping short of penile rape.

== Emotional effects ==
Aside from physical traumas, rape and other sexual assault often result in long-term emotional effects, particularly in child victims. These can include:
[[denial]], [[learned helplessness]], [[genophobia]], [[anger]], [[self-blame]], [[anxiety]], [[shame]], [[nightmare]]s, [[fear]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[Flashback (psychology)|flashback]]s, [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[Rationalization (making excuses)|rationalization]], [[mood disorder|moodswings]], [[numbness]], [[promiscuity]], [[loneliness]], [[social anxiety]], difficulty trusting oneself or others, difficulty concentrating. Being the victim of sexual assault may lead to the development of [[posttraumatic stress disorder]], [[addiction]], [[major depressive disorder]] or other [[psychopathology|psychopathologies]].
Family and friends experience emotional scarring including a strong desire for [[revenge]], a desire to "fix' the problem and/or move on, and a rationalization that "it wasn't that bad".&lt;ref name="pcar.org" /&gt;

== Physical effects ==
While sexual assault, including rape, can result in physical trauma, many people who experience sexual assault will not suffer any physical injury.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy KM, Heterogeneity of existing research relating to sexual violence, sexual assault and rape precludes meta-analysis of injury data. Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine. (2013), 20(5):447–459&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rape myths]] suggest that the stereotypical victim of sexual violence is a bruised and battered young woman. The central issue in many cases of rape or other sexual assault is whether or not both parties consented to the sexual activity or whether or not both parties had the capacity to do so. Thus, physical force resulting in visible physical injury is not always seen. This stereotype can be damaging because people who have experienced sexual assault but have no physical trauma may be less inclined to report to the authorities or to seek health care.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy KM, The relationship of victim injury to the progression of sexual crimes through the criminal justice system, Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine 2012:19(6):309-311&lt;/ref&gt; However, women who experienced rape or physical violence by a partner were more likely than people who had not experienced this violence to report frequent headaches, chronic pain, difficulty sleeping, activity limitation, poor physical health, and poor mental health.&lt;ref&gt;Dupain Mandi, Developing and Implementing a Sexual Assault Violence Prevention and Awareness Campaign at a State-Supported Regional University. American Journal of Health Studies. 29. 4. (2014). 264. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economic effects ==
Due to rape or sexual assault, or the threat of, there are many resulting impacts on income and commerce at the macro level. Each sexual assault (excluding child abuse) costs $5,100 in tangible losses (lost productivity, medical and mental health care, police/fire services, and property damage) plus $81,400 in lost quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles/victcost.pdf|title=Victim Costs and Consequences: A New Look|last=Miller, Cohen, &amp; Weirsema|first=|date=1996|website=|publisher=National Institute of Justice|access-date=September 1, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160515043800/https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles/victcost.pdf|archivedate=15 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This issue has been addressed in the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. In his dissenting opinion of the U.S. Supreme Court case ''[[U.S. v. Morrison]]'', Justice Souter explained that 75% of women never go to the movies alone at night and nearly 50% will not ride public transportation out of fear of rape or sexual assault. It also stated that less than 1% of victims collect damages and 50% of women lose their jobs or quit after the trauma. The court ruled in ''U.S. v. Morrison'' that Congress did not have the authority to enact part of the [[Violence Against Women Act]] because it did not have a direct impact on commerce. The [[Commerce Clause]] of Article I Section VII of the [[U.S. Constitution]] gives authority and jurisdiction to the Federal government in matters of interstate commerce. As a result, the victim was unable to sue her attacker in Federal Court.

Sexual assault also has adverse economic effects for survivors on the micro level. For instance, survivors of sexual assault often require time off from work&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nij.gov/publications/pages/publication-detail.aspx?ncjnumber=210346|title=Extent, Nature, and Consequences of Rape Victimization: Findings from the National Violence Against Women Survey|last=Tjaden &amp; Thoennes|first=|date=2006|website=National Institute of Justice|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs|access-date=2016-09-01|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916062148/http://www.nij.gov/publications/pages/publication-detail.aspx?ncjnumber=210346|archivedate=16 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and face increased rates of unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Byrne|first=Christina A.|last2=Resnick|first2=Heidi S.|last3=Kilpatrick|first3=Dean G.|last4=Best|first4=Connie L.|last5=Saunders|first5=Benjamin E.|title=The socioeconomic impact of interpersonal violence on women|journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology|volume=67|issue=3|pages=362–366|doi=10.1037/0022-006x.67.3.362|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Survivors of rape by an intimate partner lose an average of $69 per day due to unpaid time off from work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chrisler|first=Joan C.|last2=Ferguson|first2=Sheila|date=2006-11-01|title=Violence against Women as a Public Health Issue|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=1087|issue=1|pages=235–249|doi=10.1196/annals.1385.009|pmid=17189508|issn=1749-6632|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual assault is also associated with numerous negative employment consequences, including unpaid time off, diminished work performance, job loss, and inability to work, all of which can lead to lower earnings for survivors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Loya|first=Rebecca M.|date=2015-10-01|title=Rape as an Economic Crime The Impact of Sexual Violence on Survivors' Employment and Economic Well-Being|url=http://jiv.sagepub.com/content/30/16/2793|journal=Journal of Interpersonal Violence|language=en|volume=30|issue=16|pages=2793–2813|doi=10.1177/0886260514554291|issn=0886-2605|pmid=25381269|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160118035347/http://jiv.sagepub.com/content/30/16/2793|archivedate=18 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medical and psychological treatment of victims ==
In the [[emergency room]], emergency [[contraceptive]] medications are offered to women raped by men because about 5% of such rapes result in pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Varcarolis&gt;{{cite book | author = Varcarolis, Elizabeth| year = 2013 | title = Essentials of psychiatric mental health nursing | location = St. Louis | publisher = Elsevier | pages = 439–442}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Preventative healthcare|Preventative]] medication against [[sexually transmitted infection]]s are given to victims of all types of sexual assault (especially for the most common diseases like [[chlamydia infection|chlamydia]], [[gonorhea]], [[trichomoniasis]] and [[bacterial vaginosis]]) and a blood serum is collected to test for STIs (such as [[HIV]], [[hepatitis B]] and [[syphilis]]).&lt;ref name=Varcarolis/&gt; Any survivor with abrasions are immunized for tetanus if 5 years have elapsed since the last immunization.&lt;ref name=Varcarolis/&gt; Short-term treatment with a [[benzodiazepine]] may help with acute anxiety and antidepressants may be helpful for symptoms of [[PTSD]], depression and panic attacks.&lt;ref name=Varcarolis/&gt; Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) has also been proposed as a psychiatric treatment for victims of sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;Posmontier B, Dovydaitis T, Lipman K.

== Post-assault mistreatment of victims ==

{{Main|Post-assault treatment of sexual assault victims}}

After the assault, victims may become the target of [[slut-shaming]] to [[cyberbullying]]. In addition, their credibility may be challenged. During criminal proceedings, [[publication ban]]s and [[rape shield laws]] may operate to protect victims from excessive public scrutiny. Negative social responses to victims’ disclosures of sexual assault have the potential to lead to [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] symptoms. [[Social isolation]], following a sexual assault, can result in the victim experiencing a decrease in their [[self-esteem]] and likelihood of rejecting unwanted sexual advances in the future.&lt;ref&gt; Relyea, M., &amp; Ullman, S.

Several research based rape prevention programs have been tested and verified through scientific studies. The rape prevention programs that have the strongest empirical data in the research literature include the following:

The Men's and Women's Programs, also known as the One in Four programs, were written by John Foubert.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book |last=Foubert |first=John |title=The Men's and Women's Programs: Ending Rape Through Peer Education |year=2011 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=978-0-415-88105-0}}{{page needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is focused on increasing empathy toward rape survivors and motivating people to intervene as bystanders in sexual assault situations. Published data shows that high-risk persons who saw the Men's and Women's Program committed 40% fewer acts of sexually coercive behavior than those who didn’t. They also committed acts of sexual coercion that were 8 times less severe than a control group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2202/1949-6605.1866 |title=Behavior Differences Seven Months Later: Effects of a Rape Prevention Program |year=2008 |last1=Foubert |first1=John D. |last2=Newberry |first2=Johnathan T |last3=Tatum |first3=Jerry |journal=Journal of Student Affairs Research and Practice |volume=44 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further research also shows that people who saw the Men's and Women's Program reported more efficacy in intervening and greater willingness to help as a bystander after seeing the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1077801211409728 |title=The Men's Program: Does It Impact College Men's Self-Reported Bystander Efficacy and Willingness to Intervene? |year=2011 |last1=Langhinrichsen-Rohling |first1=J. |last2=Foubert |first2=J.

Bringing in the Bystander was written by Victoria Banyard. Its focus is on who bystanders are, when they have helped, and how to intervene as a bystander in risky situations. The program includes a brief empathy induction component and a pledge to intervene in the future. Several studies show strong evidence of favorable outcomes including increased bystander efficacy, increased willingness to intervene as a bystander, and decreased rape myth acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;Banyard, Moynihan &amp; Plante, 2007{{full citation needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Banyard, Plante &amp; Moynihan, 2004{{full citation needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Banyard, Ward, Cohn, Plante, Moorhead, &amp; Walsh, 2007{{full citation needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MVP: Mentors in Violence Prevention was written by Jackson Katz. This program focuses on discussing a male bystander who didn't intervene when woman was in danger. An emphasis is placed on encouraging men to be active bystanders rather than standing by when they notice abuse. The bulk of the presentation is on processing hypothetical scenarios. Outcomes reported in research literature include lower levels of sexism and increased belief that participants could prevent violence against women.&lt;ref&gt;Cissner, 2009{{full citation needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Green Dot program was written by Dorothy Edwards. This program includes both motivational speeches and peer education focused on bystander intervention. Outcomes show that program participation is associated with reductions in rape myth acceptance and increased bystander intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Coker, Cook-Craig, Williams, Fisher, Clear, Garcia &amp; Hegge, 2011{{full citation needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of Edmonton, Canada, initiated a public education campaign aimed at potential perpetrators. Posters in bar bathrooms and public transit centers reminded men that "It's not sex when she's wasted" and "It's not sex when he changes his mind". The campaign was so effective that it spread to other cities. "The number of reported sexual assaults fell by 10 per cent last year in Vancouver, after the ads were featured around the city. It was the first time in several years that there was a drop in sexual assault activity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/12/01/edmonton-sexual-assault-awareness-campaign-dont-be-that-guy_n_2224228.html|title=Edmonton Sexual Assault Awareness Campaign: 'Don't Be That Guy' So Effective City Relaunches With New Posters (PHOTOS)|website=Huffingtonpost.ca|date=December 2012|accessdate=2016-09-10|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160902053213/http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/12/01/edmonton-sexual-assault-awareness-campaign-dont-be-that-guy_n_2224228.html|archivedate=2 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden introduced in September 2014 a nationwide campaign against sexual assault entitled "It's on us". The campaign includes tips against sexual assault, as well as broad scale of private and public pledges to change to provoke a cultural shift, with a focus on student activism, to achieve awareness and prevention nationwide. UC Berkeley, NCAA and Viacom have publicly announced their partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abbott|first1=Katy|title=White House announces college-campus sexual assault awareness campaign|url=http://www.dailycal.org/2014/09/19/white-house-announces-campus-sexual-assault-awareness-campaign/|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=19 September 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140921151622/http://www.dailycal.org/2014/09/19/white-house-announces-campus-sexual-assault-awareness-campaign/|archivedate=21 September 2014|df=dmy-all|date=2014-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Department of Justice's National Crime Victimization Survey states that on average there are 237,868 victims (age 12 or older) of sexual assault and rape each year. According to [[Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network|RAINN]], every 107 seconds someone in America is sexually assaulted.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title = Statistics {{!}} RAINN {{!}} Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network|url = https://rainn.org/statistics|website = rainn.org|accessdate = 2015-11-18|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151120072424/https://rainn.org/statistics|archivedate = 20 November 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sexual assault in the United States military]] also is a salient issue.

The victims of sexual assault:

'''Age'''
*15% are under the age of 12
*29% are age 12–17&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
*44% are under age 18
*80% are under age 30
*12–34 are the highest risk years
*Girls ages 16–19 are 4 times more likely than the general population to be victims of rape, attempted rape, or sexual assault.&lt;ref name="rainn.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rainn.org/get-information/statistics/sexual-assault-victims|title=Who are the Victims? - RAINN - Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network|website=Rainn.org|accessdate=2016-09-10|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606002010/https://rainn.org/get-information/statistics/sexual-assault-victims|archivedate=6 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''By gender'''
A study from 1998 finds that,
*88.7% of rape victims are women, the other 11.3% being men
*17.6% of women have been victims of attempted (2.8%) or completed (14.8%) rape during their lifetime
*3% of men have been victims of attempted or completed rape during their lifetime
*17.7 million women have been victims of attempted or completed rape during their lifetime
*2.78 million men have been victims of attempted or completed rape during their lifetime.&lt;ref name="rainn.org"/&gt;

*38% of rapists are a friend or acquaintance
*28% are an intimate
*7% are a relative&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

'''College'''
{{main|Campus sexual assault}}

In the United States, several studies since 1987 have indicated that one in four college women have experienced rape or attempted rape at some point in their lifetime. These studies are based on anonymous surveys of college women, not reports to the police, and the results are disputed.&lt;ref name="leaderu1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leaderu.com/real/ri9502/sommers.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121209074942/http://www.leaderu.com/real/ri9502/sommers.html |archivedate=9 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In one study, nearly two thirds of students reported knowing victims of rape and over half reported knowing perpetrators of sexual assault. One in ten reported knowing a victim of rape when alcohol was not involved and 22.6% reported knowing a victim of alcohol-facilitated rape.&lt;ref&gt;Sorenson SB, Joshi M, Sivitz E. Knowing a sexual assault victim or perpetrator: A stratified random sample of undergraduates at one university. Journal of Interpersonal Violence, 2014; 29: 394-416&lt;/ref&gt; In the documentary ''The Hunting Ground'', the prevalence of sexual assault on college campuses is brought to attention. The schools poor judicial systems are scrutinized for not helping the victims and trying to keep these issues from the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=c42646ae-b960-4c12-bf53-6795dad55875%40sessionmgr107&amp;vid=14&amp;hid=107 | title=EBSCO Publishing Service Selection Page}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, [[Texas A&amp;M University]] professor Jason Lindo and his colleagues analyzed over two decades worth of [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] data, noting that reports of rape increased 15-57% around the times of major [[American Football]] games at [[NCAA Division I|Division 1]] schools while attempting to find a link between campus rape and [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/12/29/the-disturbing-truth-about-college-football-and-rape/|title=The disturbing truth about college football and rape|first=Danielle|last=Paquette|publisher=The Washington Post|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160825194112/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/12/29/the-disturbing-truth-about-college-football-and-rape/|archivedate=25 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 report from the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] titled "The Sexual Victimization of College Women" reports that 3.1% of undergraduates survived rape or attempted rape during a 6–7 month academic year with an additional 10.1% surviving rape prior to college and an additional 10.9% surviving attempted rape prior to college. With no overlap between these groups, these percentages add to 24.1%, or "One in Four".&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Cullen &amp; Turner, 2006{{full citation needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Koss, Gidycz &amp; Wisniewski published a study in 1987 where they interviewed approximately 6,000 college students on 32 college campuses nationwide. They asked several questions covering a wide range of behaviors. From this study 15% of college women answered "yes" to questions about whether they experienced something that met the definition of rape. An additional 12% of women answered "yes" to questions about whether they experienced something that met the definition of attempted rape, thus the statistic One in Four.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-006X.55.2.162 |title=The scope of rape: Incidence and prevalence of sexual aggression and victimization in a national sample of higher education students |year=1987 |last1=Koss |first1=Mary P. |last2=Gidycz |first2=Christine A. |last3=Wisniewski |first3=Nadine |journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology |volume=55 |issue=2 |pages=162–70 |pmid=3494755}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A point of contention lies in the leading nature of the questions in the study conducted by Koss, Gidycz &amp; Wisniewski. Koss herself later admitted that the question that had garnered the largest "rape" result was flawed and ultimately rendered the study invalid. Most prominently the problem was that many respondents who had answered yes to several questions had their responses treated as having been raped. The issue being that these same respondents did not feel they had been victimized and never sought redress for grievances. The resultant change shows a prevalence of only 1 in 22 college women having been raped or attempted to be raped during their time at college.&lt;ref name="leaderu1" /&gt;

In 1995, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] replicated part of this study, however they examined rape only, and did not look at attempted rape. They used a two-stage cluster sample design to produce a nationally representative sample of undergraduate college students aged greater than or equal to 18 years. The first-stage sampling frame contained 2,919 primary sampling units (PSUs), consisting of 2- and 4-year colleges and universities. The second sampling stage consisted of a random sample drawn from the primary sample unit frame enrolled in the 136 participating colleges and universities to increase the sample size to 4,609 undergraduate college students aged greater than or equal to 18 years old with a representative sample demographic matching the national demographic. Differential sampling rates of the PSU were used to ensure sufficient numbers of male and female, black and Hispanic students in the total sample population. After differential sample weighting, female students represented 55.5% of the sample; white students represented 72.8% of the sample, black students 10.3%, Hispanic students 7.1%, and 9.9% were other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/MMWR/preview/mmwrhtml/00049859.htm|title=Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance: National College Health Risk Behavior Survey -- United States, 1995|work=Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|date=14 November 1997|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170619204741/https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00049859.htm|archivedate=19 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was determined that nationwide, 13.1% of college students reported that they had been forced to have sexual intercourse against their will during their lifetime. Female students were significantly more likely than male students to report they had ever been forced to have sexual intercourse; 20% of approximately 2500 females (55% of 4,609 samples) and 3.9% of males reported experiencing rape thus far in the course of their lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/07448489709595589 |title=Results from the 1995 National College Health Risk Behavior Survey |year=1997 |last1=Douglas |first1=Kathy A. |last2=Collins |first2=Janet L. |last3=Warren |first3=Charles |last4=Kann |first4=Laura |last5=Gold |first5=Robert |last6=Clayton |first6=Sonia |last7=Ross |first7=James G. |last8=Kolbe |first8=Lloyd J. |journal=Journal of American College Health |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=55–66 |pmid=9276349}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies concerning the annual incidence of rape, some studies conclude an occurrence of 5%. The National Survey of Children’s Exposure to Violence found that in the 2013–2014 academic year, 4.6% of girls ages 14 – 17 experienced sexual assault or sexual abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Finkelhor|first1=David|title=Prevalence of Childhood Exposure to Violence, Crime, and Abuse: Results From the National Survey of Children's Exposure to Violence|journal=JAMA Pediatrics|volume=169|issue=8|pages=746–54|date=Jun 2015|url=http://archpedi.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2344705|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715000045/http://archpedi.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2344705|archivedate=15 July 2015|df=dmy-all|doi=10.1001/jamapediatrics.2015.0676|pmid=26121291}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another study, Mohler-Kuo, Dowdall, Koss &amp; Weschler (2004)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=15000502 |year=2004 |last1=Mohler-Kuo |first1=M |last2=Dowdall |first2=GW |last3=Koss |first3=MP |last4=Wechsler |first4=H |title=Correlates of rape while intoxicated in a national sample of college women |volume=65 |issue=1 |pages=37–45 |journal=Journal of Studies on Alcohol |doi=10.15288/jsa.2004.65.37}}&lt;/ref&gt; found in a study of approximately 25,000 college women nationwide that 4.7% experienced rape or attempted rape during a single academic year. This study did not measure lifetime incidence of rape or attempted rape.

Other research has found that about 80,000 American children are sexually abused each year.&lt;ref name=Bonnar&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2008.153254 |title=Sexual Offender Laws and Prevention of Sexual Violence or Recidivism |year=2010 |last1=Bonnar-Kidd |first1=Kelly K. |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=100 |issue=3 |pages=412–9 |pmid=20075329 |pmc=2820068}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== By jurisdiction ==

=== Australia ===

Within Australia, the term sexual assault is used to describe a variation of sexual offences. This is due to a variety of definitions and use of terminology to describe sexual offences within territories and states as each territory and state have their own legislation to define rape, attempted rape, sexual assault, aggravated sexual assault, sexual penetration or intercourse without consent and sexual violence.

In the State of New South Wales, sexual assault is a statutory offence punishable under s 61I of the [[Crimes Act 1900]]. The term "sexual assault" is equivalent to "rape" in ordinary parlance, while all other assaults of a sexual nature are termed "indecent assault".

To be liable for punishment under the [[Crimes Act 1900]], an offender must intend to commit an act of sexual intercourse as defined under s 61H(1) while having one of the states of knowledge of non-consent defined under s 61HA(3). But note that s 61HA(3) is an objective standard which only require the person has no reasonable grounds for believing the other person is consenting.&lt;ref&gt;See Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) s 61 HA (3)&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum penalty for sexual assault is 14 years imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;s 61H(1) Crimes Act 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

Aggravated sexual assault is sexual intercourse with another person without the consent of the other person and in circumstances of aggravation. The maximum penalty is imprisonment for 20 years under s 61J of the Crimes Act.

In the state of Victoria, rape is punishable under s 38 of the Crimes Act 1958, with a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;Crimes Act 1958 (VIC)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the state of South Australia, rape is punishable under s 48 of the Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 (SA) with a maximum term of life imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 (SA).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the state of Western Australia, sexual penetration is punishable under s 325 the Criminal Code Act 1913 with a maximum sentence of 14 years imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Code Act 1913 (WA)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Northern Territory, offences of sexual intercourse and gross indecency without consent are punishable under s 192 of the Criminal Code Act 1983 and punishable with a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Code Act 1983 (NT)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Queensland, rape and sexual assault are punishable under s 349, Chapter 32 of the Criminal Code Act 1899 with a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Code Act 1899 (QLD)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Tasmania, rape is punishable under s 185 of the Criminal Code Act 1924 with a maximum punishment of 21 years under s389 of the Criminal Code Act 1924.&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Code 1924 (TAS)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Australian Capital Territory, sexual assault is punishable under Part 3 of the Crimes Act 1900 with a maximum punishment of 17 years.&lt;ref&gt;Crimes Act 1900 (ACT)&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual assault is considered a gendered crime which results in 85% of sexual assaults never coming to the attention of the criminal justice system according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Bureau of Statistics. (2005). Personal Safety Survey. Canberra: ABS&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to low reporting rates, treatment of victims and distrust of the criminal justice system, difficulty in obtaining evidence and the belief in sexual assault myths.&lt;ref&gt;Heath, M. (2005). The law and sexual offences against adults in Australia (Issues No. 4). Melbourne: Australian Centre for the Study of Sexual Assault&lt;/ref&gt;

However, once a person is charged, the public prosecutor will decide whether the case will proceed to trial based on whether there is sufficient evidence and whether a case is in the public interest.&lt;ref&gt;Lievore, D. (2005). Prosecutorial decisions in adult sexual assault cases. Trends and Issues in Crime and Criminal Justice, 291, January. Canberra: Australian Institute of Criminology&lt;/ref&gt; Once the matter has reached trial, the matter will generally be heard in the District Court. This is because sexually violent crimes are mostly categorised as indictable offences (serious offences), as opposed to summary offences (minor offences). Sexual offences can also be heard in the Supreme Court, but more generally if the matter is being heard as an appeal.

Once the matter is being heard, the prosecution must provide evidence which proves “beyond reasonable doubt” that the offence was committed by the defendant. The standard of proof is vital in checking the power of the State.&lt;ref name="aifs.gov.au"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://aifs.gov.au/publications/sexual-assault-laws-australia |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-03-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170306040553/https://aifs.gov.au/publications/sexual-assault-laws-australia |archivedate=6 March 2017 |df=dmy-all |date=2011-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While as previously stated that each jurisdiction (State and Territory) has its own sexual offence legislation, there are many common elements to any criminal offence that advise on how the offence is defined and what must be proven by the prosecution in order to find the defendant guilty.&lt;ref name="aifs.gov.au"/&gt; These elements are known as Actus Reus which comprises the physical element (see Ryan v Regina [1967])&lt;ref&gt;Ryan v R [1967] HCA 2; 121 CLR 205&lt;/ref&gt; and the Mens Rea which comprises the mental element (see He Kaw Teh (1985)).&lt;ref&gt;He Kaw Teh v R (1985) 157 CLR 523&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable sexual assault cases which have resulted in convictions are Regina v Bilal Skaf [2005]&lt;ref&gt;R v Bilal Skaf [2005] NSWCCA 297,16 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and Regina v Mohommed Skaf [2005]&lt;ref&gt;R v Mohommed Skaf [2005] NSWCCA 298, 16 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt; which were highly visible in New South Wales within the media the 2000s. These cases were closely watched by the media and led to legislative changes such as the passing of the Crimes Amendment (Aggravated Sexual Assault in Company) Act 2001 No 62&lt;ref&gt;Crimes Amendment (Aggravated Sexual Assault in Company) Act 2001 No 62&lt;/ref&gt; which dramatically increased the sentences for ‘gang rapists’ by creating a new category of crime known as Aggravated Sexual Assault in Company. Changes were also made to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 NSW&lt;/ref&gt; This change is known as the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment (Victim Impact Statements) Act 2004 No 3&lt;ref&gt;Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment (Victim Impact Statements) Act 2004 No 3&lt;/ref&gt; which expands the category of offences in respect of which a Local Court may receive and consider Victim Impact Statements to include some indictable offences which are usually dealt with summarily.

=== Canada ===
Sexual assault is defined as sexual contact with another person without that other person's consent. Consent is defined in section 273.1(1) as "''the voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage in the sexual activity in question''".

Section 265 of the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] defines the offences of [[assault]] and sexual assault.

Section 271 criminalizes "Sexual assault", section 272 criminalizes "Sexual assault with a weapon, threats to a third party or causing bodily harm" and section 273 criminalizes "[[Aggravated sexual assault]]".

==== Consent ====
The absence of consent defines the crime of sexual assault. Section 273.1 (1) defines consent, section 273.1 (2) outlines certain circumstances where "no consent" is obtained, while section 273.1 (3) states that subsection (2) ''does not limit'' the circumstances where "no consent" is obtained (i.e. subsection (2) describes ''some'' circumstances which deem the act to be non-consensual, but other circumstances, not described in this section, can also deem the act as having been committed without consent). "No consent" to sexual assault is also subject to Section 265 (3), which also outlines several situations where the act is deemed non-consensual. In 2011, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in ''[[R. v. J.A.]]'' interpreted the provisions below to find that a person must have an active mind during the sexual activity in order to consent, and that they cannot give consent in advance.&lt;ref name="Criminal Code"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-6.html#anchorbo-ga:l_VIII |title=Criminal Code |publisher=Laws.justice.gc.ca |accessdate=9 December 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109205822/http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-6.html#anchorbo-ga:l_VIII |archivedate=9 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Woman can't consent to sex while unconscious, Supreme Court rules |author=Mike Blanchfield |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2011/05/27/woman_cant_consent_to_sex_while_unconscious_supreme_court_rules.html |newspaper=[[The Toronto Star]] |date=27 May 2011 |accessdate=27 May 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612140715/http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2011/05/27/woman_cant_consent_to_sex_while_unconscious_supreme_court_rules.html |archivedate=12 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Meaning of “consent”''

''273.1'' (1) Subject to subsection (2) and subsection 265(3), “consent” means, for the purposes of sections 271, 272 and 273, ''the voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage in the sexual activity in question''.

''Where no consent obtained''

(2) No consent is obtained, for the purposes of sections 271, 272 and 273, where
(a) the agreement is expressed by the words or conduct of a person other than the complainant;
(b) the complainant is incapable of consenting to the activity;
(c) the accused induces the complainant to engage in the activity by abusing a position of trust, power or authority;
(d) the complainant expresses, by words or conduct, a lack of agreement to engage in the activity; or
(e) the complainant, having consented to engage in sexual activity, expresses, by words or conduct, a lack of agreement to continue to engage in the activity.

''Subsection (2) not limiting''

(3) Nothing in subsection (2) shall be construed as limiting the circumstances in which no consent is obtained.

*''Section 265(3)''

''Consent''

(3) For the purposes of this section, no consent is obtained where the complainant submits or does not resist by reason of
(a) the application of force to the complainant or to a person other than the complainant;
(b) threats or fear of the application of force to the complainant or to a person other than the complainant;
(c) fraud; or
(d) the exercise of authority.

In accordance with 265 (4) an accused may use the defence that he or she believed that the complainant consented, but such a defence may be used only when "a judge, if satisfied that there is sufficient evidence and that, if believed by the jury, the evidence would constitute a defence, shall instruct the jury when reviewing all the evidence relating to the determination of the honesty of the accused's belief, to consider the presence or absence of reasonable grounds for that belief"; furthermore according to section 273.2(b) the accused must show that he or she took reasonable steps in order to ascertain the complainant's consent, also 273.2(a) states that if the accused's belief steams from self-induced intoxication, or recklessness or wilful blindness than such belief is not a defence.&lt;ref name="Criminal Code" /&gt;

*''265 (4)''
''Accused’s belief as to consent''

(4) Where an accused alleges that he or she believed that the complainant consented to the conduct that is the subject-matter of the charge, a judge, if satisfied that there is sufficient evidence and that, if believed by the jury, the evidence would constitute a defence, shall instruct the jury, when reviewing all the evidence relating to the determination of the honesty of the accused’s belief, to consider the presence or absence of reasonable grounds for that belief.

*''Where belief in consent not a defence''

273.2 It is not a defence to a charge under section 271, 272 or 273 that the accused believed that the complainant consented to the activity that forms the subject-matter of the charge, where
(a) the accused’s belief arose from the accused’s

(i) self-induced intoxication, or

(ii) recklessness or wilful blindness; or
(b) the accused did not take reasonable steps, in the circumstances known to the accused at the time, to ascertain that the complainant was consenting.

==== Supreme Court partial interpretation of “consent” ====

The Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador jury ruled in favour of a defense that added to the interpretation of the consent laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Barry |first=Garrett |last2=Boone |first2=Marilyn |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/jury-deliberating-snelgrove-sexual-assault-trial-1.3997432 |title=Protest follows not guilty verdict in RNC officer Doug Snelgrove sexual assault trial |work=[[CBC News]] |publisher=[[CBC News]] |date=2017-02-24 |accessdate=2017-03-04 |quote=Demonstration held on court steps following verdict |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170304101227/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/jury-deliberating-snelgrove-sexual-assault-trial-1.3997432 |archivedate=4 March 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The defenses stated and the Jury was reminded by Justice Valerie Marshall:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mullaley |first=Rosie |url=http://www.thetelegram.com/news/local/2017/2/23/case-of-police-officer-accused-of-sexually-assault-in-jurys-hand.html |title=Case of police officer accused of sexual assault in jury’s hands |work=[[The Telegram]] |date=2017-02-23 |accessdate=2017-03-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170223205418/http://www.thetelegram.com/news/local/2017/2/23/case-of-police-officer-accused-of-sexually-assault-in-jurys-hand.html |archivedate=23 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===
Before 1997, the definition of rape was: "''Whoever compels a woman to have extramarital intercourse with him, or with a third person, by force or the threat of present danger to life or limb, shall be punished by not less than two years’ imprisonment''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/kunarac/tjug/en/kun-tj010222e-4.htm|title=Kunarac, Vukovic and Kovac - Judgement - Part IV|website=Icty.org|accessdate=2016-09-10|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312233318/http://www.icty.org/x/cases/kunarac/tjug/en/kun-tj010222e-4.htm|archivedate=12 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''Section 177'''
:'''Sexual assault by use of force or threats; rape'''

#Whosoever coerces another person
##by force;
##by threat of imminent danger to life or limb; or
##by exploiting a situation in which the victim is unprotected and at the mercy of the offender,
#:to suffer sexual acts by the offender or a third person on their own person or to engage actively in sexual activity with the offender or a third person, shall be liable to imprisonment of not less than one year.
#In especially serious cases the penalty shall be imprisonment of not less than two years. An especially serious case typically occurs if
##the offender performs sexual intercourse with the victim or performs similar sexual acts with the victim, or allows them to be performed on himself by the victim, especially if they degrade the victim or if they entail penetration of the body (rape); or
##the offence is committed jointly by more than one person.

Subsections (3), (4) and (5) provide additional stipulations on sentencing depending on aggravating or mitigating circumstances.

Section 178 provides that "''If the offender through sexual assault or rape (section 177) causes the death of the victim at least by gross negligence the penalty shall be imprisonment for life or not less than ten years''."

=== Republic of Ireland ===
As in many other jurisdictions, the term sexual assault is generally used to describe non-penetrative sexual offences. Section 2 of the Criminal Law (Rape) Act of 1981 states that a man has committed rape if he has sexual intercourse with a woman who at the time of the intercourse does not consent to it, and at that time he knows that she does not consent to the intercourse or he is reckless as to whether she does or does not consent to it. Under Section 4 of the Criminal Law (Rape Amendment) Act of 1990, rape means a sexual assault that includes penetration (however slight) of the anus or mouth by the penis or penetration (however slight) of the vagina by any object held or manipulated by another person. The maximum penalty for rape in Ireland is imprisonment for life.&lt;ref&gt;National SATU Guidelines Development Group. Rape/Sexual Assault: National Guidelines on Referral and Forensic Clinical Examination in Ireland. 3rd Edition; 2014. Available at www.hse.ie/satu&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South Africa ===
The [[Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act]] created the offence of sexual assault, replacing a common-law offence of [[indecent assault]]. "Sexual assault" is defined as the unlawful and intentional sexual violation of another person without their consent. The Act's definition of "sexual violation" incorporates a number of sexual acts, including any genital contact that does not amount to penetration as well as any contact with the mouth designed to cause sexual arousal. Non-consensual acts that involve actual penetration are rape rather than sexual assault.

Unlawfully and intentionally inspiring the belief in another person that they will be sexually violated also amounts to sexual assault. The Act also created the offences of "compelled sexual assault", when a person forces a second person to commit an act of sexual violation with a third person; and "compelled self-sexual assault", when a person forces another person to masturbate or commit various other sexual acts on theirself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=77866 |title=Welcome to the official South African government online site! &amp;#124; South African Government |website=Info.gov.za |date=2016-08-11 |accessdate=2016-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629081854/http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=77866 |archivedate=29 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===

==== England and Wales ====
Sexual assault is a statutory offence in [[England and Wales]]. It is created by section 3 of the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]] which defines "sexual assault" as when a person (A)
{{quotation|
#intentionally touches another person (B),
#the touching is sexual,
#B does not consent to the touching, and
#A does not reasonably believe that B consents.}}
Whether a belief is reasonable is to be determined having regard to all the circumstances, including any steps A has taken to ascertain whether B consents.

Sections 75 and 76 apply to an offence under this section.

A person guilty of an offence under this section is liable—
#on [[Summary offence#United Kingdom|summary conviction]], to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum or both;
#on [[Indictable offence|conviction on indictment]], to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/section/3|title=Sexual Offences Act 2003|website=Legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=2016-09-10|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161015075433/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/section/3|archivedate=15 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Consent =====
[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/section/74 Section 74] of the Sexual Offenses Act explains that "a person consents if he agrees by choice and has the freedom and capacity to make that choice".

[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/section/75 Section 75] clarifies what consent means

75 Evidential presumptions about consent

(1)If in proceedings for an offence to which this section applies it is proved—
(a)that the defendant did the relevant act,
(b)that any of the circumstances specified in subsection (2) existed, and
(c)that the defendant knew that those circumstances existed, the complainant is to be taken not to have consented to the relevant act unless sufficient evidence is adduced to raise an issue as to whether he consented, and the defendant is to be taken not to have reasonably believed that the complainant consented unless sufficient evidence is adduced to raise an issue as to whether he reasonably believed it.

(2)The circumstances are that—
(a)any person was, at the time of the relevant act or immediately before it began, using violence against the complainant or causing the complainant to fear that immediate violence would be used against him;
(b)any person was, at the time of the relevant act or immediately before it began, causing the complainant to fear that violence was being used, or that immediate violence would be used, against another person;
(c)the complainant was, and the defendant was not, unlawfully detained at the time of the relevant act;
(d)the complainant was asleep or otherwise unconscious at the time of the relevant act;
(e)because of the complainant’s physical disability, the complainant would not have been able at the time of the relevant act to communicate to the defendant whether the complainant consented;
(f)any person had administered to or caused to be taken by the complainant, without the complainant’s consent, a substance which, having regard to when it was administered or taken, was capable of causing or enabling the complainant to be stupefied or overpowered at the time of the relevant act.

(3)In subsection (2)(a) and (b), the reference to the time immediately before the relevant act began is, in the case of an act which is one of a continuous series of sexual activities, a reference to the time immediately before the first sexual activity began.

=== United States ===
The United States Department of Justice defines sexual assault as "any type of sexual contact or behavior that occurs without the explicit consent of the recipient. Falling under the definition of sexual assault are sexual activities as forced sexual intercourse, forcible sodomy, child molestation, incest, fondling, and attempted rape."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual Assault|url=https://www.justice.gov/ovw/sexual-assault|website=United States Department of Justice|accessdate=14 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161010230428/https://www.justice.gov/ovw/sexual-assault|archivedate=10 October 2016|df=dmy-all|date=2014-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sirwah''' ([[Old South Arabian|OSA]]: Ṣrwḥ,&lt;ref&gt;[http://dasi.humnet.unipi.it/index.php?id=81&amp;prjId=1&amp;corId=3&amp;recId=64 CSAI] retrieved May 2016&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-ar|صرواح خولان}} ''Ṣirwāḥ Ḫawlān'') was, after [[Ma'rib]], the most important economical and political center of the Kingdom of Saba at the beginning of the 1st century BC, on the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. Ṣirwāḥ was surrounded by a fortified wall. The city layout inside the oasis included a number of large buildings.

The ruins of Ṣirwāḥ are located 40&amp;nbsp;km west of  Ma'rib. The town was well protected by its position in the mountains was well protected, but at the same time put limits on its development. As a result, Ṣirwāḥ quickly lost its position as a capital, which was taken over by Ma’rib, which was in an important economical center since it was located on the incense route. The town nevertheless remained an important centre for the Sabaeans, as shown by the large number of temple buildings. It was also the site chosen by King [[Yada'il Dharih I]] to build an important temple to [[Almaqah]] about the year 700 BC.

==Archaeology==

Archaeologists from the [[German Archaeological Institute]] have since 2005 discovered and salvaged an inscription from the Sabaean Kingdom that is over seven meters long. This seven tonne heavy block of stone was a standing feature of the sanctuary of Almaqah and had fallen from its plinth during an earthquake. The epigraphist Norbert Nebes from the [[University of Jena]] described the inscription as the most important one so far from the period of the first century BC. The inscription gives an account of the battles of a Sabaean, carried out against his immediate neighbors in the south-east and north of Yemen.

Some restorative work was undertaken on these sites before the breakout of the [[Yemeni Civil War (2015–present)|Yemeni Civil War]]. During these works a further temple was discovered dating back to the 7th century BC. This sanctuary has a monumental entrance, decorated with pillars. It contains a number of rooms, built out of wood and stone, the layout is unique for Yemen in this period. One of the longest inscriptions which composed of 20 lines is describing the conquerors and campaigns by king [[Karib'il Watar]].

Since the breakout of civil war in Yemen in 2015, Ṣirwāḥ has been a frontline between the [[Houthi]] rebels and forces allied with President [[Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/yemeni-ceasefire-expires-clashes-erupt-across-country/&lt;/ref&gt; making excavations almost impossible. Prior to this, a number of German excavations took place in Ṣirwāḥ, which it was hoped would further knowledge about the earliest days of the [[Sabaean Kingdom]].

'''Greyshirts''' or '''''Gryshemde''''' is the common short-form name given to the '''South African Gentile National Socialist Movement''', a [[South Africa]]n [[Nazism|Nazi]] movement that existed during the 1930s and 1940s. Initially referring only to a paramilitary group, it soon became shorthand for the movement as a whole.

The [[NSDAP/AO]] arrived in South Africa in 1932 and as a result a number of groups sympathetic to Nazism emerged. The most notable of these was the South African Gentile National Socialist Movement (also known as the South African Christian National Socialist Movement), formed by [[Louis Weichardt]] the following year.&lt;ref name="Payne"&gt;[[Stanley G. Payne]], ''A History of Fascism 1914-45'', London: Routledge, 2001, p. 338&lt;/ref&gt; A fiercely [[anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]] group, it organised the Gryshemde as its equivalent of the [[Sturmabteilung]], although the grey shirt became so associated with the group that it was applied to the movement as a whole. In contrast to some extremist groups the Greyshirts did not split along linguistic lines, but rather sought to work with both the [[Afrikaans]] and the [[English language|English]]-speaking populations.&lt;ref&gt;Aletta J. Norval, ''Deconstructing Apartheid Discourse'', p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greyshirts struggled to maintain unity and spawned a number of minor splinter groups, such as Johannes von Moltke's South African Fascists. Most of these groups united under [[Daniel François Malan]]'s aegis when he formed his [['Purified' National Party]], although the Greyshirts did not take part and contested the [[South African general election, 1938|1938 election]] alone. The decision proved unwise, however, as the Greyshirts failed to make any impact.&lt;ref name="Payne"/&gt; The group was roundly attacked by the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]], with an article appearing in ''[[Die Burger]]'' in October 1934 stating that: 'We believe that this party, generally known as the Greyshirts, under the cloak of an anti-Jewish movement, strives for a dangerous form of government in South Africa. The Greyshirts have as their aim to set up a dictator in South Africa.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anc.org.za/books/reich4.html Followers of Hitler] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715031456/http://www.anc.org.za/books/reich4.html |date=2007-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jew]]ish immigration from [[Nazi Germany]] to South Africa grew significantly during the 1930s and the Greyshirts launched a campaign calling for an end to the practice. A ship was chartered by the Council for German Jewry, a UK-based group, to bring as many Jews as possible to [[Cape Town]], leading to the Greyshirts organising a mass protest against the move. The scale of opposition was such that [[Sarah Millin]] appealed to [[Jan Smuts]] to deal with the Greyshirts, although her request was ignored.&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Bathsheba Braude, 'Introduction', ''Contemporary Jewish Writing in South Africa: An Anthology''&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, relations between the National Party and the Greyshirts actually improved, initially as a result of a 1937 letter from [[Frans Erasmus]], at the time Secretary of the National Party, praising the Greyshirts for bringing the "Jewish problem" to the fore and culminating in a number of leading Greyshirts also holding National Party membership.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Bunting, ''The Rise of the South African Reich'', Penguin Books, 1969, pp. 64-65&lt;/ref&gt;

Activities were monitored during the [[Second World War]], although the Greyshirts continued to exist and renamed themselves the White Workers Party in 1949. However, by this time most of the membership had been lost to the [[Herenigde Nasionale Party]] and so the Greyshirts faded.&lt;ref name="Payne"/&gt;

This is a timeline of the background of the '''Taliban's rise to power'''.

It details the [[Taliban]] movement's origins in [[Pashtun nationalism]], and briefly relates its ideological underpinnings with that of broader Afghan society.

It details the Taliban's consolidation of power, listing persecutions by the Taliban officials during its five years in power in Afghanistan and during its war with the [[Northern Alliance]].

==Contact with Pakistan's ISI==
During the power vacuum created by the [[Soviet troop withdrawal from Afghanistan]] in 1989, the country was torn apart by warring [[mujahideen]] groups and the [[Inter-Services Intelligence|ISI]] of Pakistan grasped the chance to wield power in the region by fostering a previously unknown [[Kandahar]]i student movement.&lt;ref name="telegraphgodfathers"&gt;{{cite news

Taliban initially enjoyed enormous good will from Afghans weary of the corruption, brutality, and the incessant fighting of [[Mujahideen]] warlords.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim world / editor in chief, Richard C. Martin, Macmillan Reference USA : Thomson/Gale, c2004&lt;/ref&gt; One story is that the rape and murder of boys and girls from a family traveling to Kandahar or a similar outrage by Mujahideen bandits sparked [[Mohammed Omar]] (Mullah Omar) and his students to vow to rid Afghanistan of these criminals.&lt;ref&gt;Matinuddin, Kamal, ''The Taliban Phenomenon, Afghanistan 1994-1997'', Oxford University Press, (1999), pp.25–6&lt;/ref&gt;  Another motivation was that the Pakistan-based truck shipping mafia known as the "Afghanistan Transit Trade" and their allies in the Pakistan government, trained, armed, and financed the Taliban to clear the southern road across Afghanistan to the Central Asian Republics of extortionate bandit gangs.&lt;ref&gt;Rashid, ''Taliban'' (2000), 25-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many senior leaders of the Afghanistan [[Taliban]] were closely associated with and had attended the [[Darul Uloom Haqqania]] seminary in [[Akora Khattak]] in Pakistan, including [[Mohammed Omar|Mullah Omar]], and its role in supporting the Taliban.&lt;ref name="jamestown"&gt;{{FIL-Luge link

==Allegations of connection to 'The West' or to the United States (CIA)==
{{See also|Allegations of CIA assistance to Osama bin Laden}}
After [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)#Soviet intervention and withdrawal|the Soviet Union intervened in Afghanistan in 1979]], Islamic [[mujahideen]] fighters engaged in war with those Soviet forces. Some of those Islamic fighters would later transform into the [[Taliban]] according to Professor [[Carole Hillenbrand]] who stated: "The West helped the Taliban to fight the Soviet takeover of Afghanistan".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hillenbrand|2015|p=284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there isn't any evidence that the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] directly supported the Taliban or [[Al Qaeda]], some basis for military support of the Taliban was provided when, in the early 1980s, the CIA and the ISI (Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency) provided arms to Afghans resisting the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and the ISI assisted the process of gathering radical Muslims from around the world to fight against the Soviets.&lt;ref name='R000321'&gt;{{cite news | first=Joseph | last=Fitchett | coauthors= | title=What About the Taliban's Stingers? | date=26 September 2001 | publisher= | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/26/news/what-about-the-talibans-stingers.html | work=[[The International Herald Tribune]] | pages= | accessdate=2008-11-11 | language= | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161017145308/http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/26/news/what-about-the-talibans-stingers.html | archivedate=17 October 2016 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Osama Bin Laden]] was one of the key players in organizing training camps for the foreign Arab volunteers, although his organization, [[Maktab al-Khidamat]], was exclusively Saudi funded.&lt;ref name=DID-THE-US-CREATE-OSAMA-BIN-LADEN&gt;{{cite web|title=Did the U.S. "Create" Osama bin Laden? |date=2005-01-14 |publisher=[[U.S. Department of State]] |url=http://usinfo.state.gov/media/Archive/2005/Jan/24-318760.html |accessdate=2007-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050310111109/http://usinfo.state.gov/media/Archive/2005/Jan/24-318760.html |archivedate=March 10, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BERGEN-BIN-LADEN-CIA-LINKS-HOGWASH&gt;{{Cite news

The Taliban were based in the [[Helmand Province|Helmand]], [[Kandahar Province|Kandahar]], and [[Uruzgan Province|Uruzgan]] regions and were overwhelmingly ethnic Pashtuns and predominantly [[Durrani]] Pashtuns.&lt;ref&gt;Rashid, ''Taliban'' (2000), p.98&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emergence in Afghanistan==
The first major military activity of the Taliban was in October–November 1994 when they marched from [[Maywand District|Maiwand]] in southern Afghanistan to capture [[Kandahar|Kandahar City]] and the surrounding provinces, losing only a few dozen men.&lt;ref&gt;Rashid, ''Taliban'', (2000) pp.27–9&lt;/ref&gt; Starting with the capture of a border crossing and a huge ammunition dump from warlord [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]], a few weeks later they freed "a convoy trying to open a trade route from Pakistan to Central Asia" from another group of warlords attempting to extort money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/spot/taliban.html |title=The Taliban — |publisher=Infoplease.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the next three months this hitherto "unknown force" took control of twelve of Afghanistan's 34 [[Provinces of Afghanistan|provinces]], with Mujahideen warlords often surrendering to them without a fight and the "heavily armed population" giving up their weapons.&lt;ref&gt;Rashid, ''Taliban'' (2000), p.1&lt;/ref&gt; By September 1996 they had captured Afghanistan's capital, [[Kabul]].

==Consolidation of power==
Under the Taliban regime, [[Sharia law]] was interpreted to ban a wide variety of activities hitherto lawful in Afghanistan: employment, education and sports for women, movies, television, videos, music, dancing, hanging pictures in homes, clapping during sports events, kite flying, and beard trimming. One Taliban list of prohibitions included: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;pork, pig, pig oil, anything made from human hair, satellite dishes, cinematography, and equipment that produces the joy of music, pool tables, chess, masks, alcohol, tapes, computers, VCRs, television, anything that propagates sex and is full of music, wine, lobster, nail polish, firecrackers, statues, sewing catalogs, pictures, Christmas cards.&lt;ref&gt;Amy Waldman, `No TV, no Chess, No Kites: Taliban's Code, from A to Z,` ''New York Times'', 22 November 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Wikiquote|religious police}}

Men were required to have a beard extending farther than a fist clamped at the base of the chin. On the other hand, they had to wear their head hair short. Men were also required to wear a head covering.&lt;ref name="cr"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2001/sa/8222.htm |title=US Country Report on Human Rights Practices - Afghanistan 2001 |publisher=State.gov |date=2002-03-04 |accessdate=2014-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Possession was forbidden of depictions of living things, whether drawings, paintings or photographs, stuffed animals, and dolls.&lt;ref name="cr" /&gt;
 
These rules were issued by the [[Ministry for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (Afghanistan)|Ministry for the Promotion of Virtue and Suppression of Vice]] (PVSV) and enforced by its "religious police," a concept thought to be borrowed from the [[Wahhabi]]s. In newly conquered towns hundreds of religious police beat offenders (typically men without beards and women who were not wearing their burqas properly) with long sticks.&lt;ref&gt;Rashid, ''Taliban'' (2000), p.105&lt;/ref&gt;

Theft was punished by the amputation of a hand, rape and murder by public execution. Married adulterers were stoned to death. In Kabul, punishments were carried out in front of crowds in the city's former [[soccer stadium]].

===Treatment of women===
{{main|Taliban treatment of women}}
[[File:Taliban beating woman in public RAWA.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A member of the Taliban's [[Mutaween#Other groups|religious police]] beating a woman in [[Kabul]] on 13 September 2001. The footage, which was filmed by [[Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan|RAWA]].]]
Women in particular were targets of the Taliban's restrictions. They were prohibited from working; from wearing clothing regarded as "stimulating and attractive," including the "Iranian [[chador]]," (viewed as insufficiently complete in its covering); from taking a taxi without a "close male relative" (''[[mahram]]''); washing clothes in streams; or having their measurements taken by tailors.&lt;ref name="Rashid218"&gt;Rashid, ''Taliban'' (2000), pp.218–9. See the full edict here: [http://gemsofislamism.tripod.com/taliban_in_their_own_words.html The Taliban In Their Own Words]&lt;/ref&gt;

Employment of women was restricted to the medical sector because male medical personnel were not allowed to examine women.  One result of the Taliban's ban on employment of women was the closing down of many primary schools, in places such as Kabul, not only for girls but for boys too, because almost all the teachers there were women.&lt;ref&gt;Rashid, ''Taliban'' (2000), p.106&lt;/ref&gt;

Women were also not permitted to attend co-educational schools; in practice, this prevented the vast majority of young women and girls in Afghanistan from receiving even a [[primary education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7799926.stm | work=BBC News | title=Taleban 'will kill school girls' | date=26 December 2008 | accessdate=26 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s1oWlA3xeg |title=Taliban Threatening girls again |publisher=YouTube |date=2009-01-27 |accessdate=2014-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women were made to wear the [[burqa]], a traditional dress covering the entire body, with a small screen covering the face through which the wearer could see. Taliban restrictions became more severe after they took control of the capital. In February 1998, religious police forced all women off the streets of Kabul and issued new regulations ordering "householders to blacken their windows, so women would not be visible from the outside."&lt;ref&gt;Rashid, ''Taliban'' (2000) p.70&lt;/ref&gt; 
Home schools for girls, which had been allowed to continue, were forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;Rashid, ''Taliban'' (2000), p.114&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1998, the Taliban stopped all women from attending general hospitals,&lt;ref name=taliban71&gt;Rashid, ''Taliban'' (2000), p.71.&lt;/ref&gt; leaving the use of one all-women hospital in Kabul. There were many reports of Muslim women being beaten by the Taliban for violating the Taliban interpretation of the [[Sharia]].

=== Prohibitions on culture ===
[[Movie theater]]s were closed and music was banned. Hundreds of cultural artifacts that were deemed [[polytheistic]] were also destroyed including a major museum and countless private art collections.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, ''Looming Towers'' (2006), p.231&lt;/ref&gt;

A sample Taliban edict issued after their capture of Kabul is one decreed in December 1996 by the "General Presidency of Amr Bil Maruf and Nahi Anil Munkar" (or Religious Police) banning a variety of things and activities: music, shaving of beards, keeping of pigeons, flying kites, displaying of pictures or portraits, western hairstyles, music and dancing at weddings, gambling, "sorcery," and not praying at prayer times.&lt;ref name="Rashid218" /&gt; In February 2001, Taliban used sledgehammers to destroy representational works of art at the National Museum of Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=loomingtowers337&gt;Wright, ''Looming Towers'' (2006), p.337.&lt;/ref&gt;

Local festivities were not exempt from prohibitions. The Taliban banned the traditional Afghan New Year's celebrations and "for a time they also banned [Ashura] the Shia Islamic month of mourning and even restricted any show of festivity at [[Eid al-Fitr|Eid]]."&lt;ref name="Rashid115"&gt;Rashid, ''Taliban,'' (2000), pp.115–116.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Afghan people were not allowed to have any cultural celebrations if  women were present. If there were only men at the celebration it would be allowed, so long as it ended by  7:00 p.m, a set time.

Many Taliban officials wanted to give entertain or said they did but they wanted it to be set by them and guided by the holy religion.

====Buddhas of Bamiyan====
{{Main|Buddhas of Bamiyan}}

In March 2001, the Taliban ordered the demolition of two statues of [[Buddharupa|Buddhas]] carved into cliffsides at [[Buddhas of Bamiyan|Bamiyan]], one 38 metres (125&amp;nbsp;ft) tall and carved in 507 CE, the other 53 metres (174&amp;nbsp;ft) tall and carved in 554 CE. The act was condemned by [[UNESCO]] and many countries around the world.

The intentions of the destruction remain unclear. Mullah Omar initially supported the preservation of Afghanistan's [[Cultural heritage|heritage]], and [[Japan]] linked financial aid to the preservation of the statues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Pakistan and Japan plead for Afghan statues | date=2001-03-09 | url=http://edition.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/asiapcf/central/03/09/afghanistan.destruction/ | publisher=[[CNN.com]] | accessdate=2007-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after a few years, a [[decree]] was issued claiming all representations of humans and idols, including those in museums, must be destroyed in accordance with Islamic law which prohibits any form of [[idolatry|idol worship]].

The government of Pakistan (itself host to one of the richest and most ancient collections of Buddhist art) implored the Taliban to spare the statues. Saudi Arabia and the [[United Arab Emirates]] later denounced the act as savage.

[[Sayed Rahmatullah Hashemi]], a senior representative of the Taliban designated as the roving [[Ambassador]], visited the US in March, 2001. He portrayed the Taliban's action not as an act of irrationality, but as an act of rage over UNESCO and some western governments denying the Taliban use of the funds meant for the repairs of the war-damaged statues of the Buddha. He contended that the Taliban intended to use the money for drought relief.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[http://www.robert-fisk.com/taliban_lecture.htm Transcript] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025030742/http://www.robert-fisk.com/taliban_lecture.htm |date=October 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Taliban spent much money and effort on destroying the statues, resources which they could have instead used for drought relief.

===Ethnic massacres and persecution===
The worst attack on civilians came in summer of 1998 when the Taliban swept north from [[Herat]] to the predominantly Hazara and [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]] city of [[Mazari Sharif|Mazar-i-Sharif]], the largest city in the north. Entering at 10 am on 8 August 1998, for the next two days the Taliban drove their pickup trucks "up and down the narrow streets of Mazar-i-Sharif shooting to the left and right and killing everything that moved — shop owners, cart pullers, women and children shoppers and even goats and donkeys."&lt;ref&gt;Rashid, ''Taliban'' (2000), p.73.&lt;/ref&gt; More than 8000 noncombatants  were reported killed in Mazar-i-Sharif and later in [[Bamiyan]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodson, ''Afghanistan's Endless War,'' (2001), p.79.&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to the injunctions of Islam, which demands immediate burial, the Taliban forbade anyone to bury the corpses for the first six days while they rotted in the summer heat and were eaten by dogs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/reports98/afghan/Afrepor0-02.htm#P114_24041 THE MASSACRE IN MAZAR-I SHARIF, THE FIRST DAY OF THE TAKEOVER].&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this indiscriminate slaughter, the Taliban sought out and [[massacre]]d members of the [[Hazara people|Hazara]], a mostly Shia ethnic group, while in control of Mazar-i-Sharif.

While the slaughter can be attributed to several factors – ethnic difference, suspicion of Hazara loyalty to their co-religionists in Iran, fury at the loss of life suffered in an earlier unsuccessful Taliban takeover of Mazar – the belief by some [[Sunni]] Taliban that the [[Shia]] Hazaras were guilty of ''[[takfir]]'' (apostasy) may have been the principal motivation. It was expressed by Mullah Niazi, the commander of the attack and governor of Mazar after the attack, in his declaration from Mazar's central mosque:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Last year you rebelled against us and killed us. From all your homes you shot at us. Now we are here to deal with you. The Hazaras are not Muslims and now we have to kill Hazaras. You either accept to be Muslims or leave Afghanistan. Wherever you go we will catch you. If you go up we will pull you down by your feet; if you hide below, we will pull you up by your hair.&lt;ref name = "hrw.org-Niazi"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports98/afghan/Afrepor0-03.htm#P186_38364 |title=Human Rights Watch Report, `Afghanistan, the massacre in Mazar-e-Sharif`, November 1998. INCITEMENT OF VIOLENCE AGAINST HAZARAS BY GOVERNOR NIAZI |publisher=Hrw.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hazara also suffered a [[siege]] by the Taliban of their [[Hazarajat]] homeland in central Afghanistan and the refusal by the Taliban to allow the UN to supply food to Hazara in the provinces of Bamiyan, [[Ghor]], [[Maidan Wardak Province|Wardak]] and [[Ghazni]].&lt;ref&gt;Rashid, ''Taliban'' (2000), p.68&lt;/ref&gt; A month after the Mazar slaughter, Taliban broke through Hazar lines and took over Hazarajat. The number of civilians killed was not as great as in Mazar, but occurred nevertheless.&lt;ref&gt;Rashid, ''Taliban'' (2000), p.76.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the years that followed, massacres of Hazara by Taliban forces were documented by groups such as [[Human Rights Watch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/afghanistan/ |title=Afghanistan |publisher=Hrw.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Cottingley Secret''''' is a 2017 [[fantasy]] [[novel]] written by British novelist Hazel Gaynor, in which she retells the story behind the [[Cottingley Fairies|Cottingley fairies]] from 1917. This novel intermingles the real events that occurred in 1917 with a fictional story set in 2017. The Cottingley Fairies were made famous through a series of photographs taken from 1917 to 1921 by two young girls of nine and sixteen years old—Frances Griffiths and Elsie Wright—in [[Cottingley, Bradford|Cottingley]], England. The story became renowned worldwide mainly because of the intervention of [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] who took particular interest on the fairy photographs and tale. [[doi:10.1080/03087298.1998.10443903|The photographs]], which depict the two girls in the company of fairies, were originally published in Doyle's article written in 1920 for ''[[Strand Magazine]]'', but can be found in other articles as well since the matter of their copyright has been largely disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://hoaxes.org/photo_database/image/the_cottingley_fairies/|title=The Cottingley Fairies|work=Museum of Hoaxes|access-date=2017-11-17|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
''The Cottingley Secret'' takes place in [[England]], during [[World War I]], in 1917. One of the main characters, Frances Griffiths, moves out of [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]], with her mother because her father has to fight in the war. The book starts with Frances and her mother on a train taking them to their new lives in Cottingley, England, where her cousin, Elsie Wright, lives. ''The Cottingley Secret'' is a retelling of the story behind the Cottingley fairies and a series of purportedly real photographs created in Cottingley, a village in [[West Yorkshire]], England. The plots follows the lives of the two cousins—Frances Griffiths and Elsie Wright—who photographed real [[Fairy|fairies]] in the garden near a stream. The story follows the facts behind the real events—how the news attracted the attention of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, how nationally renowned the girls became, and the hope of people who believed in the fantasy during war times.

Gaynor’s fictional reimagining continues into the present (2017) with Olivia Kavanagh, who after discovering her grandfather’s manuscript and the picture of the fairies, realizes that her story becomes intertwined with the cousins’ lives, causing past and present to blur together. Gaynor approaches the story intertwining past and present—in the form of a memoir written by Frances Griffiths that retells the past events, and through the present life of a fictional character (Olivia Kavanagh) whose family dates back to that time and place as well. ''The Cottingley Secret'' follows the life of Olivia who after her grandfather passes away, she inherits his [[Bookselling|bookshop]] in [[Ireland]] called Something Old, so she temporarily decides to leave behind her life in [[London]] that is tied to a fiancée and a steady job as a [[Bookbinding|bookbinder]]. After finding a manuscript with Frances’ story and her photographs of fairies, Olivia begins to struggle with choosing between a life figured out in London or a new adventure where she feels a connection and meaning behind her newfound work. As Olivia gets deeper into the story, she also makes the connection that someone from Frances’ past is related to her family—a great grandmother. Having lost her own mother as a child and trying to take care of her grandmother with [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer’s]], Olivia believes that holding on to this story is the only way to reconnect with her family.

Once Olivia finds out that the bookshop is under a threat of getting shutdown due to debts, she embarks on a mission to get all the necessary funds and restore the bookshop. After a lost little girl, Iris, wanders into the bookshop, Olivia meets Ross, a local writer who becomes the bookshop's [[writer-in-residence]]. Together, they manage to bring the bookshop back to life by organizing events for the public and promoting the antique books on a website to reach more customers. Olivia steadily begins to balance out the debts and becomes so enthralled by Frances' manuscript that she decides to visit Cottingley, the place where her grandmother also grew up. Before she travels, Jack—Olivia's fiancée—shows up at the bookshop's door because Olivia won't return his calls and is ignoring her wedding planning. Olivia had found out before her grandfather's death that she was infertile, something she'd kept from Jack. When Jack finds out, he flies to Ireland to find her and bring her back to London, despite how angry he was at the results. However, Olivia decides to stay in Ireland, break off her engagement, and continue her research into her family history and their connection to the Cottingley fairies.

When Olivia finally travels to Cottingley, she discovers that the girl in her dreams that Frances also talked about in her memoir was her grandmother's sister, who died when she was a kid from a fall in the garden. Olivia's grandmother had been contacted when the body was found a decade later after Olivia's great grandmother passed away, and Olivia was able to visit the grave and put an end to her recurring dreams, finally satisfied with finding the connection between Frances' history and her own.

== Critical reception ==
Since its publication in August 2017, the novel has gathered largely positive reviews. ''[[The Irish Times]]'' calls the novel “an enchanting, charming story”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/the-cottingley-secret-by-hazel-gaynor-1.3214157|title=The Cottingley Secret by Hazel Gaynor|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2017-10-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Kirkus Reviews]] admires the retelling more than the fictional story set in the present because Gaynor "creates a lovely meditation on the power of belief and hope." According to ''Kirkus Reviews'', "The insight into the true story of the Cottingley fairies is interesting, and it's easy to understand why two girls might play along with an innocent trick that became a worldwide sensation." However, regarding the present events unfolding throughout the story, they write, "Olivia's struggles are never quite as compelling, and readers may find themselves eager to slip back into the world of the fairies."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/hazel-gaynor/the-cottingley-secret/|title=KirkusReviews|last=|first=|date=|website=go.galegroup.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New York Journal of Books called it a "delightful read".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = a book review by Nancy Carty Lepri: The Cottingley Secret: A Novel| accessdate = 2018-01-03| url = https://www.nyjournalofbooks.com/book-review/cottingley-secret}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Photographs ==
Despite the original photographs published in 1917 and 1920 having being debunked as a hoax in 1983,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=AONE&amp;sw=w&amp;u=uni_rodit&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;id=GALE%7CA20915029&amp;asid=bccf9304fc8c025c53435fa505d2de0c|title=CSICOP compiles top ten paranormal hoaxes|last=|first=|date=|website=go.galegroup.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Cottingley Secret'' also includes the images on the last pages of the novel. The two girls later confessed in 1983 that even though the photographs were not tampered with, the fairies were in fact paper cutouts of fairies drawn by them.

'''''The Dish''''' is a satirical television series that aired on the [[Style Network]] in the [[United States]]. The show (first airing August 16, [[2008 in television|2008]]), hosted by [[Danielle Fishel]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalledger.com/cgi-bin/artman/exec/view.cgi?archive=34&amp;num=25119 Topanga Lawrence Juggles "The Dish" And The Books], Marilyn Beck and Stacy Jenel Smith, ''National Ledger.com'', Feb 24, 2009. Retrieved 18 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; skewers the latest in pop culture (television, movies, magazines, celebrities, etc.) in similar fashion to sister network [[E! Entertainment Television]]'s series ''[[The Soup]]''. The show also aired on International [[E! Channel|E!]] channels alongside ''The Soup''. The show's final episode aired March 20, 2011, two months after the merger of [[NBCUniversal]] and [[Comcast]] was completed. The merger had brought former competitors [[Bravo (U.S. TV network)|Bravo]] and [[Oxygen (TV channel)|Oxygen]] under common NBCUniversal ownership with Style, nullifying much of the video material available to ''The Dish'', as many Bravo and Oxygen programs under NBC's ownership apart from Style had been used for satirical purposes for the show.

==Format==
As with ''[[The Soup]]'', the show primarily consists of Fishel providing humorous commentary on content (such as clips of television programs), arranged in themed segments. Unlike ''The Soup'' however, the show places more emphasis on fashion and [[celebrity culture]]. A [[running gag]] throughout the series was Fishel's being [[typecasting (acting)|typecast]] and being recognized solely for her most famous role as [[Topanga Lawrence]] from ''[[Boy Meets World]]''.

==Segments==

===Regular segments===
*"Hot Dish"&amp;nbsp;– The segment includes celebrity news and gossip of the week.
*"Clip Closet"&amp;nbsp;– Clips are shown recapping different shows of that week. Often signaled by a closet with TV show title cards and the Clip Closet logo appears in one of the cards. This segment runs in a very similar fashion to Reality Show Clip Time on ''[[The Soup]]''.

In [[South Carolina]] [[ghostlore]], '''the Gray Man''' is a ghost reportedly seen on the coast of [[Pawleys Island, South Carolina|Pawleys Island]], [[South Carolina]] that warns residents of coming severe storms and [[hurricanes]]. Although there are many variations of the legend, most say the Gray Man was first seen in 1822, three years before the town government was incorporated. The last reported sighting was just before [[Hurricane Florence]] hit in 2018,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/hurricane-florence-approaches-east-coast-hurricane-predicting-ghost-gray-man-warns-pawleys-island-002356770.html&lt;/ref&gt; and previously just before [[Hurricane Hugo]] hit the area in 1989.&lt;ref name="co"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gray Man: Pawleys Island’s local spirit is among state’s best known ghosts|url=http://www.coastalobserver.com/articles/2012/071912/6.html|work=Coastal Observer Pawleys Island, SC Thursday, July 19, 2012|publisher=coastalobserver.com, Jackie R. Broach|accessdate=November 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History and legend==

Legend holds that the Gray Man is the ghost of a young man traveling from [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] to see his fiancée. On the way, he and his horse were caught in quicksand-like pluff mud in the marshes before Pawley's Island, and died. His spirit has haunted the shore nearby ever since, looking for the girl he loved.&lt;ref name="co" /&gt;

Some stories have conflicted on his identity, but some ideas include:
* [[Percival Pawley]], the island's namesake
* Plowden Charles Jeannerette Weston, an early resident who owned the home that is now Pelican Inn
* Edward Teach, better known as [[Blackbeard]]

Charles Joyner says the legend appears to originate from a book of ghost stories by Julian Stevenson Bolick, published in  1956.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.abebooks.com/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=15599188371&amp;searchurl=sortby%3D17%26an%3Djulian%2Bstevenson%2Bbolick%26fe%3Don]&lt;/ref&gt; The Gray Man got national attention just after Hurricane Hugo when residents Jim and Clara Moore were interviewed on the television show “[[Unsolved Mysteries]]." They told their story about seeing the man on the beach and how he disappeared when they waved. Their house was spared in the storm while the homes of their neighbors were heavily damaged.&lt;ref name="co" /&gt;

Others who have encountered the spirit have credited him with saving them or their homes. Either they have come ashore or left the area and return to find their homes and belongings unscathed by severe storms.&lt;ref name="co" /&gt; In another instance, he was seen in the mid 1900’s on the beach near South Carolina by a girl during a storm. She claimed that he appeared on a tree outside the porch she was sleeping on and, after hearing tales about him, she ran inside with her friend. Seconds after she got inside, a wall on her bed and the man disappeared.

He has been described as a man wearing gray clothing, a long coat, dressed "like a [[pirate]]," and sometimes as having no legs.&lt;ref name="co" /&gt;

'''Tlatilco''' was a large [[pre-Columbian]] village in the [[Valley of Mexico]] situated near the modern-day town of the same name in the [[Mexican Federal District]]. It was one of the first chiefdom centers to arise in the Valley, flourishing on the western shore of [[Lake Texcoco]] during the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Middle Pre-Classic period]], between the years of 1200 [[Common Era|BCE]] and 200 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Niederberger (1996) p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; It gives its name to the "[[Tlatilco culture]]", which also included the town of [[Tlapacoya (archeological site)|Tlapacoya]], on the eastern shore of [[Lake Chalco]].  

Tlatilco is noted in particular for its high quality pottery pieces, many featuring Olmec iconography, and its figurines, including Olmec-style [[Olmec figurine#Baby-face figurines|baby-face figurines]]. Much else, however, seems to be in a native ceramic tradition.&lt;ref&gt; Adams, p. 75)&lt;/ref&gt; These Olmec-style artifacts have led to speculation concerning the nature of [[Olmec influences on Mesoamerican cultures|Olmec influence on other Mesoamerican cultures]].  

The Tlatilco site was used in modern times as a source of clay for brick-making. By the 1930s, many of the ancient artifacts thereby uncovered made their way into the hands of collectors, including [[Miguel Covarrubias]], artist and ethnographer. Covarrubias led the first controlled excavation in 1942. By 1949, over 200 burials were identified at Tlatilco, leading to its categorisation as a [[necropolis]].&lt;ref&gt;Niederberger (1996), p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; Two major archaeological excavations followed, with over 500 burials eventually identified, many with intact grave offerings.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; The last field season also undertook a systematic survey of non-burial structures, leading to the realization that these hundreds of burials were apparently located under ancient houses -- although no traces of them remain - as well as among the various trash pits, and that Tlatilco was not a necropolis, but rather a major chiefdom center.&lt;ref&gt;Niederberger (1996), p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many burials, primarily of high status individuals, show evidence of dental mutilation and [[artificial cranial deformation]], most probably through the use of [[cradleboard]]s. 

The Tlatilcans' agriculture was focused on maize, but also included beans, [[amaranth]], and squash, and chili peppers. These plants were supplemented with various fowl, including migratory birds, wild rabbits and other smaller mammals, and deer and antelope.&lt;ref&gt;Niederberger (1996), p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tlatilco reached its heyday during the period from 1000-700 [[Common Era|BCE]], during the Olmec [[archaeological horizon|horizon]].&lt;ref&gt;Niederberger (1996), p. 84, although others give slightly different dates. Blaton et al. give a range of 1400 - 900 for this Olmec (or "Early") horizon (Table of Contents).&lt;/ref&gt; The following Zacatenco phase (700-400 BCE) saw a cessation of the use of Olmec iconography and forms.

==Tlatilco figurines==
[[File:Dualmasktlatilco.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Small ceramic mask from Tlatilco commonly referred to as the duality mask]]
Many Tlatilco figurines show deformities or other anomalies, including a "duality" mask and several [http://homepage.smc.edu/urmston_william/art%209%20slides/urmston/6.%20Tlatilco%20Female%20Figures.jpg two-headed female figures]. This has led some researchers to wonder whether Tlatilco was perhaps a cluster site for conjoined twins.&lt;ref&gt;Bendersky, aa well as Kennedy.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Tlatilco" comes from the [[Nahuatl language]], in which it means "place of mounds".
