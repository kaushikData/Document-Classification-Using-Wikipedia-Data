'''Alexander Macbain''' (or '''Alexander MacBain''') (22 July 1855 – 4 April 1907) was a Scottish philologist, best known today for ''An Etymological Dictionary of the Gaelic Language'' (1896).

==Early life and education==
Macbain was born 22 July 1855 at Balguish, Glenfeshie ([[Badenoch]], Inverness-shire) and grew up in poverty. His parents, John MacBain and Margaret McIntyre were not recorded as married when his birth was registered 9 August 1855.&lt;ref&gt;1855 MacBain, Alexander Statutory Births 102/00 0028&lt;/ref&gt; A native [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] speaker, he learned English at Insh General Assembly school, five miles from Kingussie, in Badenoch (1863–1870), whose teacher was [[Alexander Mackenzie (historian)|Alexander Mackenzie]].&lt;ref name=Black&gt;Black, "Macbain, Alexander (1855–1907)." ''ODNB''.&lt;/ref&gt; As a teenager, he taught for half a year at the Dunmullie School in [[Boat of Garten]] (1870–71), attended Baldow School in Badenoch, was employed by the [[Ordnance Survey]] in Scotland and Wales (1871–74) and returned to Baldow School for another term. Having obtained a bursary, Macbain was accepted at [[Old Aberdeen Grammar School]] (1874) and subsequently studied at [[King's College, Aberdeen]] (1876), where he graduated with an MA in philosophy.&lt;ref name=Black /&gt;

==Professional career==
In July 1880, Macbain was appointed rector of Raining's school, [[Inverness]], which had just become the secondary school for the entire [[Scottish Highlands|highlands]]. Raining's school became part of the High Public School in 1894–95, for which Macbain continued to work until his death.&lt;ref name=Black /&gt; He was made [[Legum Doctor]] at [[Aberdeen University]] in 1901 and received his pension in 1905. During the last two decades of his life, Macbain was one of the leading figures in a Gaelic intellectual circle which met in Inverness and Edinburgh.&lt;ref name=Black /&gt; The group included both older members, such as [[Alexander Nicolson]], [[Alexander Carmichael]] and [[Donald MacKinnon (Scottish Celtic scholar)|Donald Mackinnon]], and a younger generation which included Father [[Allan MacDonald (poet)|Allan MacDonald]], [[William J. Watson]], [[George Henderson (scholar)|George Henderson]] and Kenneth McLeod.&lt;ref name=Black /&gt; Macbain never married. On 4 April 1907, he died of a [[cerebral haemorrhage]] in [[Stirling]]. He was buried in his home district Badenoch, in the Rothiemurchus churchyard.&lt;ref name=Black /&gt;

==Scholarly output==
Macbain was involved in a substantial amount of editorial work. He worked together with Rev John Kennedy to publish the numerous transcripts which the late Rev Dr Alexander Cameron (d. 1888) had made from texts found in manuscripts. The result was the two volumes of ''Reliquiae Celticae'' (1892–94).&lt;ref name=Black /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/search.php?query=Reliquiae%20Celticae Internet Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; He also published an annotated edition of [[W. F. Skene]]'s ''The Highlanders of Scotland'' (1902) and of the ''History of the Mathesons'' by his former teacher Alexander Mackenzie; contributed to an edition of [[Ewan MacEachen]]'s ''Gaelic Dictionary''; and was editor for ''[[Celtic Magazine]]'' (1886–1888) and ''[[Highland Monthly]]'' (1889–1902).&lt;ref name=Black /&gt;

Many individual papers were published in the ''Transactions of the [[Gaelic Society of Inverness]]'' and Transactions of the [[Inverness Field Club]].&lt;ref name=Black /&gt; His first book was ''Celtic Mythology and Religion'', which appeared in 1885 (reprinted 1917). The work for which he is best known today is the philological milestone ''An Etymological Dictionary of the Gaelic Language'' (1896).&lt;ref name=Black /&gt; Macbain published a critical edition of the [[Book of Deer]] and contributed entries on the [[Picts]] in ''[[Chambers's Encyclopaedia]]'', articles for magazines and newspapers and reviews for the ''Transactions of the Gaelic Society of Inverness'' (1880–1903). He was responsible for two popular textbooks, ''Gaelic Reader'' and, together with John Whyte,&lt;ref&gt;John Whyte was a journalist, a translator of Gaelic, and a librarian. He was born in Easdale in Argyll and was the brother of Henry Whyte (1852-1913). He wrote under the pen-names 'MacMharcuis' and 'IBO'. He died in 1913. http://www.dasg.ac.uk/corpus/textmeta.php?text=89&amp;uT=y&lt;/ref&gt; ''How to Learn Gaelic''.&lt;ref name=Black /&gt;

MacBain was highly critical of Skene's position of the [[Pictish language]] as [[Celtic languages#Classification|Q-Celtic]] in character.&lt;ref&gt;See for example his 1902 foreword to Skene's Highlanders of Scotland&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that the degree of animosity evident in MacBain's treatment of Skene may have been for personal reasons and that he was biased against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Sellar | first =  W.D.H. | year = 2001 | journal = Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland | volume = 131| pages = 3–21 | title = William Forbes Skene (1809–92): historian of Celtic Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"American mythology" may also refer to the modern study of these representations, and to the subject matter as represented in the literature and art of other cultures in any period.

Stories from American mythology are the primary sources of inspiration for stories  and tall tales such as [[Bigfoot]], [[Paul Bunyan]], and [[The Lone Ranger (TV series)|The Lone Ranger]].

The '''Articella''' is a collection of medical treatises bound together in one volume that was used mainly as a textbook and reference manual between the 13th and the 16th centuries. In [[Middle Ages|medieval times]], several versions of this anthology circulated in manuscript form among medical students. Between 1476 and 1534, [[printing|printed]] editions of the Articella were also published in several [[Europe]]an cities.

The collection grew around a synthetic exposition of [[ancient Greek medicine|classical Greek medicine]] written in [[Baghdad]] by the [[physician]] and [[polyglot (person)|polyglot]] [[Hunayn bin Ishaq]], better known in the West as Ioannitius. His synthesis was in turn based on [[Galen]]'s ''Ars Medica'' (''Techne iatrike'') and thus became known in Europe as ''Isagoge Ioannitii ad Tegni Galieni'' (''Hunayn's Introduction to the Art of Galen'').

In the mid-13th century, the emergence of formal medical education in several European universities fueled a demand for comprehensive textbooks. Instructors from the influential [[Scuola Medica Salernitana]] popularized the practice of binding other treatises together with their manuscript copies of the Isagoge. These included [[Hippocrates]]’ Prognostics as well as his Aphorisms, [[Theophilus Protospatharius]]'s De Urinis and De Pulsibus and many other classic works.

[[Image:Salsola sativa Ypey96.jpg|thumb|right|''Halogeton sativus'' is one of the plants from which '''barilla''' was made. The species was formerly classified as ''Salsola sativa''. Engraving published 1813 (Adolphus Ypey).]]
'''''Barilla''''' refers to several species of salt-tolerant ([[halophyte]]) plants that, until the 19th Century, were the primary source of [[soda ash]] and hence of [[sodium carbonate]]. The word "barilla" was also used directly to refer to the soda ash obtained from plant sources.&lt;ref&gt;
Definitions of "barilla" in ''The Oxford English Dictionary, Second Edition'' (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1989). Definitions retrieved from the [http://www.oed.com online edition] on December 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The word is an anglicization of the Spanish word [[:es:barrilla|''barrilla'']] for [[saltwort]] plants (a particular category of halophytes).

A very early reference indicating the value placed upon soda ash in [[Catalonia]] has been given by Glick, who notes that "In 1189 the [[Poblet Monastery|monastery of Poblet]] granted to the glassblower Guillem the right to gather [[glasswort]] in return for tithe and two hundred pounds of sheet glass paid annually (The site of these glassworks, at Narola, was excavated in 1935.)."&lt;ref&gt;Glick, Thomas F. (1979).

Archived at WebCite from [https://archive.is/20120710141038/http://libro.uca.edu/ics/emspain.htm this original URL] on 2008-03-01.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 18th Century, Spain's barilla industry was exporting large quantities of soda ash of exceptional purity; the product was refined from the ashes of barilla plants that were specifically cultivated for this purpose. Presumably the word "barilla" entered English and other languages as a consequence of this export trade. The main Spanish barilla species included (i) ''[[Salsola soda]]'' (the common English term '''barilla plant''' for ''Salsola soda'' reflects this usage), (ii) ''[[Salsola kali]]'', and (iii) ''[[Halogeton]] sativus'' (formerly ''Salsola sativa'').&lt;ref&gt;

''Elements of Materia Medica and Therapeutics, Vol. I'' (Longman, Brown, Green, and Longmans, London), p. 551. Pereira described the main species used to make barilla in different places. Thus "[[Canary Islands|Canary]] barilla is procured from ''Salsola Kali''," "[[Alicante (province)|Alicant]] barilla is obtained from ''Salsola sativa'', ''Chenopodium setigerum'', and other species," and "Of the French barillas, two only deserve notice; namely, that of [[Narbonne]], obtained from ''Salicornia herbacea'', and which yields 14-15%, ..." Online version at [https://books.google.com/books?id=KyIb0tE9COAC books.google.com].&lt;/ref&gt; Fairly recently, Pérez&lt;ref name="Perez"/&gt; has concluded that the most prominent species was likely ''Halogeton sativus''; earlier authors have tended to favor ''Salsola soda''.

The word "barilla" was also used directly to refer to soda ash from any plant source, including not only the [[saltwort]]s grown in Spain, but also [[glasswort]]s, [[mangrove]]s, and [[kelp|seaweed]].&lt;ref&gt;Bird, Juliet F. (1978). "The Nineteenth-Century Soap Industry and its Exploitation of Intertidal Vegetation in Eastern Australia ," ''The [[Australian Geographer]], Vol. 14'', pp. 38&amp;ndash;41.&lt;/ref&gt; These types of plant-derived soda ash are impure [[alkali]] substances that contain widely varying amounts of [[sodium carbonate]] (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), some additional [[potassium carbonate]] (also an alkali), and a predominance of non-alkali impurities.&lt;ref name="Clow52"&gt;
Clow, Archibald and Clow, Nan L. (1952). ''Chemical Revolution,'' (Ayer Co Pub, June 1952), pp. 65&amp;ndash;90. {{ISBN|0-8369-1909-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The sodium carbonate, which is water-soluble, is "[[wikt:lixiviate|lixiviated]]" (extracted with water) from the ashes of the burned, dried plants. The resulting solution is boiled dry to obtain the finished barilla. A very similar process is used to obtain [[potash]] (mainly [[potassium carbonate]]) from the ashes of hardwood trees. The best Spanish barilla—prepared by master ''barrilleros''—contained about 30% Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. In 1877 Kingzett described the importance of the barilla trade to Spain as follows: "So highly was the product valued, and the importance of the trade regarded, that by the laws of Spain the exportation of the seed was an offence punishable by death."&lt;ref&gt;Kingzett, Charles Thomas (1877).

Some authors indicate that "barilla" was a specific plant used for soda ash production; this usage is erroneous, but presumably corresponds to the common usage of "barilla plant" exclusively for ''Salsola soda''. Perhaps this common usage itself reflects an old error in assuming that a single plant species was used by the Spaniards for their industry. In still earlier times, the sources of soda ash and the methods of processing it were secrets that were zealously guarded.

'''Black supremacy''' or '''black supremacism''' is a [[Supremacism#Racial|racial supremacist]] belief which maintains that [[black people]] are superior to people of other [[Race (human classification)|races]]. The term has been used by the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] (SPLC), an American legal advocacy organization, to describe several fringe religious groups in the [[United States]].

==Groups associated with black supremacist views==
[[File:TamaRe.jpg|thumb|Central portion of [[Tama-Re]], a village in the U.S. state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] built in 1993 by the [[United Nuwaubian Nation of Moors]], as seen from the air in 2002]]
Several fringe groups have been described as either holding or promoting black supremacist beliefs. A source described by historian [[David Mark Chalmers]] as being "the most extensive source on right-wing extremism" is the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] (SPLC), an American nonprofit organization that monitors all kinds of [[hate group]]s and [[extremists]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[David Mark Chalmers]] |title=Backfire: How the Ku Klux Klan Helped the Civil Rights Movement |publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]] |year=2003 |isbn=0-7425-2311-X |url={{Google books|tlvs7498TJMC|plainurl=y|page=188}} |page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Brett A.

*The [[Israelite Church of God in Jesus Christ]] (ICGJC), which is headquartered in New York City, was described in 2008 by the SPLC as an American "black supremacist sect" and part of the growing "black supremacist wing of the [[Black Hebrew Israelites|Hebrew Israelite movement]]". The ICGJC accepts the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]]s and the [[Deuterocanonical books|Apocrypha]] as [[Biblical inspiration|inspired Scripture]] and has an [[Apocalypticism|apocalyptic]] view of the end of the world.&lt;ref name=Ready&gt;{{cite web |title=Racist Black Hebrew Israelites Becoming More Militant |work=Intelligence Report |publisher=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]] |url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2008/racist-black-hebrew-israelites-becoming-more-militant |date=August 29, 2008 |accessdate=May 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The [[Nation of Yahweh]] is a religious group based in the United States described as black supremacist by the SPLC. It is an offshoot of the [[Black Hebrew Israelites|Black Hebrew Israelite]] line of thought. It was founded by American [[Yahweh ben Yahweh]] (born Hulon Mitchell Jr.), whose name means "God the Son of God" in [[Hebrew]]. The Nation of Yahweh grew rapidly throughout the 1980s and at its height had headquarters in Miami, Florida, and temples in 22 states.&lt;ref name=SPLC1&gt;{{cite web |author=Mark Potok |title=Popularity and Populism |work=Intelligence Report |publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center |url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2001/popularity-and-populism |date=November 29, 2001 |accessdate=July 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[United Nuwaubian Nation of Moors]] was founded by the American [[Dwight York]], who has been described by the SPLC as advocating the belief that black people are superior to [[white people]]. The SPLC reported that York's teachings included the belief that "whites are 'devils', devoid of both heart and soul, their color the result of [[leprosy]] and genetic inferiority". The SPLC described the Nuwaubianism belief system as "mix[ing] black supremacist ideas with worship of the [[Egyptians]] and their [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]], a belief in [[Unidentified flying object|UFOs]] and various [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] related to the [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)#Illuminati|Illuminati]] and the [[Bilderberg Group#Criticism|Bilderbergers]]".&lt;ref name=Nuwaubian&gt;{{cite web |author=Bob Moser |title=United Nuwaubian Nation of Moors Meets Its Match in Georgia |work=Intelligence Report |publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center |url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2002/united-nuwaubian-nation-moors-meets-its-match-georgia |date=September 20, 2002 |accessdate=July 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Associated Press]] described the teachings of the [[Nation of Islam]] as having been black supremacist until 1975, when [[Warith Deen Mohammed|W.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2375">The '''Bonstorf Barrows''' ({{lang-de|Grabhügelfeld von Bonstorf}}) are the remains of a much larger [[tumulus|barrow]] cemetery on the [[Lüneburg Heath]] in north [[Germany]] dating to the late [[neolithic]] or [[early bronze age]]. They are located east of the village of [[Bonstorf]], part of the municipality of [[Hermannsburg]] in the [[Lower Saxony|Lower Saxon]] district of [[Celle district|Celle]]. The site comprises six, closely packed burial mounds or barrows.

The largest barrow was located originally in a field, but due to its vulnerable location it was dug out in 1973 and reconstructed nearby. Of interest are the internal stones which were found in the burial mound. The barrow was surrounded by a stone circle.

Under the earth mound was a wooden chamber, in which a man had been buried in an east-west orientation. Grave items included an earthenware jar, a [[palstave]], a sword and bronze dagger.

On the northern perimeter of the mound a woman was interred on a stone bed. She wore two, seven-ribbed [[bangle]]s and a headdress made of clusters of small, sheet bronze pipes. Furthermore, a round bronze needle (''Radnadel'') lay on her chest. It is very likely that the woman had a personal relationship to the interred man.

The grave finds are characteristic of the old [[bronze age]] (i.e. from about 1500 to 1200 B.C.) in the [[Lüneburg Heath]].

The '''Cambridge School of historiography''' was a [[school of thought]] which approached the study of the [[British Empire]] from the imperialist point of view. It emerged especially at the [[University of Cambridge]] in the 1960s. [[John Andrew Gallagher]] (1919-80) was especially influential, particularly in his article with [[Ronald Robinson]] on "[[The Imperialism of Free Trade]]".

Leaders of the School include Anil Seal, [[Gordon Johnson (historian)|Gordon Johnson]], Richard Gordon, and David A. Washbrook.

[[Howard Spodek]], for example, praises the school's regional and pluralist perspectives but criticizes their reliance on British (rather than Indian) documentation, sloppy use of [[social science]] models, downplaying of ideology, and their excessive emphasis on Indian self-seeking and the importance of British imperial initiatives in achieving modernization. He recommends a deeper appreciation of Indian initiatives, and more attention to the emerging importance of public life in many areas of society rather than just a concentration on politics.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Spodek, "Pluralist Politics in British India: The Cambridge Cluster of Historians of Modern India," ''American Historical Review,'' (June 1979) 84#3 pp 688-707&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''civilization''' or '''civilisation''' (see [[American and British English spelling differences#-ise, -ize (-isation, -ization)|English spelling differences]]) is any [[complex society]] characterized by [[urban area|urban development]], [[social stratification]] imposed by a cultural [[elite]], [[symbol]]ic systems of communication (for example, [[writing system]]s), and a perceived separation from and domination over the [[natural environment]].&lt;ref name="Adams 1966"&gt;{{cite book|author=Adams, Robert McCormick|title=The Evolution of Urban Society|year=1966|page=13|publisher=Transaction Publishers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JrZOwKU0TlsC&amp;q=%22civilizations+are+associated%22|isbn=9780202365947}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haviland 2013"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Haviland, William|title=Cultural Anthropology: The Human Challenge|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2013|page=250|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=DfEWAAAAQBAJ&amp;q=%22civilization+refers+to+societies%22|display-authors=etal|isbn=978-1285675305}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wright 2004"&gt;{{cite book|first=Ronald|last=Wright|title=A Short History of Progress|publisher=House of Anansi|year=2004|pages=115, 117, and 212|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=nzWPFQIEvfEC&amp;q=%22technical,%20anthropological%22|isbn=9780887847066}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Llobera 2003"&gt;{{cite book|first=Josep|last=Llobera|title=An Invitation to Anthropology|publisher=Berghahn Books|year=2003|pages=136–137|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=_-LDyWxODjAC&amp;q=%22best-known+definition%22|isbn=9781571815972}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fernández-Armesto 2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fernández-Armesto|first=Felipe|title=Civilizations: Culture, Ambition, and the Transformation of Nature |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|year=2001|url= https://books.google.com/?id=3MNzi698aXwC|isbn=9780743216500}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boyden 2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyden|first=Stephen Vickers|title=The Biology of Civilisation|year=2004|pages=7–8|publisher=UNSW Press|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=TX78DfVbM7kC&amp;q=%22the+essential+precondition%22|isbn=9780868407661}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Solms-Laubach 2007"&gt;{{cite book|first=Franz|last=Solms-Laubach|title=Nietzsche and Early German and Austrian Sociology|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=2007|pages=115, 117, and 212|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TxTITNduFc4C&amp;dq|isbn=9783110181098}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Children's literature, domestication, and social foundation : narratives of civilization and wilderness|last=1964-|first=AbdelRahim, Layla|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780415661102|location=New York|page=8|oclc=897810261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civilizations are intimately associated with and often further defined by other socio-politico-economic characteristics, including [[centralization]], the [[domestication]] of both humans and other organisms, [[division of labor|specialization of labour]], culturally ingrained [[Idea of Progress|ideologies of progress]] and [[supremacism]], [[monument]]al [[architecture]], [[taxation]], societal dependence upon [[farming]] and [[expansionism]].&lt;ref name="Haviland 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wright 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Llobera 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boyden 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Solms-Laubach 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Historically, civilization has often been understood as a larger and "more advanced" culture, in contrast to smaller, supposedly [[primitive culture]]s.&lt;ref name="Adams 1966"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wright 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Llobera 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bolesti|first=Maria|title=Barbarism and Its Discontents|year=2013|publisher=Stanford University Press|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cpZZKabXvWAC|isbn=9780804785372}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, some scholars have described civilization as being necessarily multicultural.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wei|journal=Globality Studies Journal|year=2011|issue=24|title=Civilization and Culture|first=Ruan |url=https://gsj.stonybrook.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/0024Wei.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this broad sense, a civilization contrasts with non-centralized tribal societies, including the cultures of [[nomadic pastoralist]]s, [[Neolithic]] societies or [[hunter-gather]]ers, but it also contrasts with the cultures found within civilizations themselves. As an uncountable noun, "civilization" also refers to the process of a society developing into a centralized, urbanized, stratified structure. Civilizations are organized in densely populated settlements divided into [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] [[social class]]es with a ruling elite and subordinate urban and rural populations, which engage in intensive agriculture, mining, small-scale manufacture and trade. Civilization concentrates power, extending human control over the rest of nature, including over other human beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Sources of Social Power |last=Mann |first=Michael |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1986 |volume=1 |pages=34–41 |author-link=Michael Mann (sociologist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civilization, as its etymology (below) suggests, is a concept originally linked to towns and cities. The earliest emergence of civilizations is generally associated with the final stages of the [[Neolithic Revolution]], culminating in the relatively rapid process of [[urban revolution]] and [[state formation]], a political development associated with the appearance of a governing elite.

== History of the concept ==
The English word ''civilization'' comes from the [[Early modern France|16th-century French]] ''civilisé'' ("civilized"), from Latin ''civilis'' ("civil"), related to ''civis'' ("citizen") and ''civitas'' ("city").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3041K2Zv76AC&amp;pg=PT73 |title=The SAGE Glossary of the Social and Behavioral Sciences |last=Sullivan |first=Larry E. |year=2009 |publisher=SAGE Publications |isbn=9781412951432 |page=73 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fundamental treatise is [[Norbert Elias]]'s ''[[The Civilizing Process]]'' (1939), which traces social [[mores]] from [[Court (royal)|medieval courtly society]] to the [[Early Modern period]].&lt;ref&gt;It remains the most influential sociological study of the topic, spawning its own body of secondary literature. Notably, [[Hans Peter Duerr]] attacked it in a major work (3,500 pages in five volumes, published 1988–2002). Elias, at the time a nonagenarian, was still able to respond to the criticism the year before his death. In 2002, Duerr was himself criticized by Michael Hinz's ''Der Zivilisationsprozeß: Mythos oder Realität'' (2002), saying that his criticism amounted to a hateful defamation of Elias, through excessive standards of [[political correctness]].  ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' [http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-25327104.html 40/2002]&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Philosophy of Civilization'' (1923), [[Albert Schweitzer]] outlines two opinions: one purely [[materialism|material]] and the other material and [[ethic]]al. He said that the world crisis was from humanity losing the ethical idea of civilization, "the sum total of all progress made by man in every sphere of action and from every point of view in so far as the progress helps towards the spiritual perfecting of individuals as the progress of all progress".{{page needed|date=October 2014}}

Adjectives like "civility" developed in the mid-16th century. The abstract noun "civilization", meaning "civilized condition", came in the 1760s, again from French. The first known use in French is in 1757, by [[Victor Riqueti, marquis de Mirabeau]], and the first use in English is attributed to [[Adam Ferguson]], who in his 1767 ''[[Essay on the History of Civil Society]]'' wrote, &lt;!-- Keep original spelling please. --&gt;"Not only the individual advances from infancy to manhood, but the species itself from rudeness to civilisation".&lt;ref name=Benveniste&gt;Cited after [[Émile Benveniste]], ''Civilisation. Contribution à l'histoire du mot'' (''Civilisation. Contribution to the history of the word''), 1954, published in ''Problèmes de linguistique générale'', [[Éditions Gallimard]], 1966, pp. 336–345 (translated by Mary Elizabeth Meek as ''Problems in general linguistics'', 2 vols., 1971).&lt;/ref&gt; The word was therefore opposed to barbarism or rudeness, in the active pursuit of [[Progress (history)|progress]] characteristic of the [[Age of Enlightenment]].

In the late 1700s and early 1800s, during the [[French Revolution]], "civilization" was used in the [[Grammatical number|singular]], never in the plural, and meant the progress of humanity as a whole. This is still the case in French.&lt;ref name=velkley/&gt; The use of "civilizations" as a countable noun was in occasional use in the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;E.g. in the title ''A narrative of the loss of the Winterton East Indiaman wrecked on the coast of Madagascar in 1792; and of the sufferings connected with that event. To which is subjoined a short account of the natives of Madagascar, with suggestions as to their civilizations'' by J. Hatchard, L.B. Seeley and T. Hamilton, London, 1820.&lt;/ref&gt; but has become much more common in the later 20th century, sometimes just meaning [[culture]] (itself in origin an uncountable noun, made countable in the context of [[ethnography]]).&lt;ref&gt;"Civilization" (1974), ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' 15th ed. Vol. II, Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc., 956. Retrieved 25 August 2007. Using the terms "civilization" and "culture" as equivalents is controversial{{clarify|date=October 2014}} and generally rejected, so that for example some types of culture are not normally described as civilizations.&lt;/ref&gt; Only in this generalized sense does it become possible to speak of a "medieval civilization", which in Elias's sense would have been an oxymoron.

Already in the 18th century, civilization was not always seen as an improvement. One historically important distinction between culture and civilization is from the writings of [[Rousseau]], particularly his work about education, ''[[Emile: or, On Education|Emile]]''. Here, civilization, being more [[Reason|rational]] and socially driven, is not fully in accord with [[human nature]], and "human wholeness is achievable only through the recovery of or approximation to an original prediscursive or prerational natural unity" (see [[noble savage]]). From this, a new approach was developed, especially in Germany, first by [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], and later by philosophers such as [[Kierkegaard]] and [[Nietzsche]]. This sees cultures as natural organisms, not defined by "conscious, rational, deliberative acts", but a kind of pre-rational "folk spirit". Civilization, in contrast, though more rational and more successful in material progress, is unnatural and leads to "vices of social life" such as guile, hypocrisy, envy and avarice.&lt;ref name=velkley&gt;{{Citation|title=Being after Rousseau: Philosophy and Culture in Question| last=Velkley|first=Richard|year=2002|chapter=The Tension in the Beautiful: On Culture and Civilization in Rousseau and German Philosophy|pages=11–30|publisher=The University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[World War II]], [[Leo Strauss]], having fled Germany, argued in New York that this opinion of civilization was behind [[Nazism]] and German [[militarism]] and [[nihilism]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://archive.org/details/LeoStraussOnGermanNihilism1941 On German Nihilism]" (1999, originally a 1941 lecture), ''Interpretation'' 26, no. 3 edited by David Janssens and Daniel Tanguay.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
[[File:Grün - The End of Dinner.jpg|thumb|The emergence of [[table manners]] and other forms of [[etiquette]] and [[self-restraint]] are presented as one of the characteristics of ''civilized'' society by [[Norbert Elias]] in ''[[The Civilizing Process]]'' (1939). ''The End of Dinner'' by [[Jules-Alexandre Grün]] (1913).]]
Social scientists such as [[V. Gordon Childe]] have named a number of traits that distinguish a civilization from other kinds of society.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Childe, V., ''What Happened in History'' (Penguin, 1942) and ''Man Makes Himself'' (Harmondsworth, 1951).&lt;/ref&gt; Civilizations have been distinguished by their means of subsistence, types of [[livelihood]], [[Human settlement|settlement]] patterns, [[forms of government]], [[social stratification]], economic systems, [[literacy]] and other cultural traits. [[Andrew Nikiforuk]] argues that "civilizations relied on shackled human muscle. It took the energy of slaves to plant crops, clothe emperors, and build cities" and considers slavery to be a common feature of pre-modern civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Energy of Slaves: Oil and the new servitude |last=Nikiforuk |first=Andrew |publisher=Greystone Books |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All civilizations have depended on [[agriculture]] for subsistence, with the possible exception of some early civilizations in Peru which may have depended upon maritime resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hallofmaat.com/modules.php?name=Articles&amp;file=article&amp;sid=85 | title= The Maritime Foundations of Andean Civilization: An Evolving Hypothesis | last=Moseley | first=Michael | publisher= The Hall of Ma'at |format= |website= | accessdate= 2008-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Moseley |first=Michael | title = The Maritime Foundations of Andean Civilization |year=1975 |publisher=Cummings |location=Menlo Park |isbn=978-0-8465-4800-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grain farms can result in accumulated storage and a surplus of food, particularly when people use intensive agricultural techniques such as artificial [[fertilisation|fertilization]], [[irrigation]] and [[crop rotation]]. It is possible but more difficult to accumulate horticultural production, and so civilizations based on horticultural gardening have been very rare.&lt;ref&gt;Hadjikoumis; Angelos, Robinson; and Sarah Viner-Daniels (Eds) (2011), "Dynamics of Neolithisation in Europe: Studies in honour of Andrew Sherratt" (Oxbow Books)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grain]] surpluses have been especially important because grain can be [[food storage|stored]] for a long time. A surplus of food permits some people to do things besides produce food for a living: early civilizations included [[soldiers]], [[artisan]]s, [[priest]]s and priestesses, and other people with specialized careers. A surplus of food results in a division of labour and a more diverse range of human activity, a defining trait of civilizations. However, in some places hunter-gatherers have had access to food surpluses, such as among some of the indigenous peoples of the [[Pacific Northwest]] and perhaps during the [[Mesolithic]] [[Natufian culture]]. It is possible that food surpluses and relatively large scale social organization and division of labour predates plant and animal domestication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/06/gobekli-tepe/mann-text/1 |title= Göbekli Tepe |publisher= [[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]|accessdate=|date = June 2011|last= Mann|first = Charles C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civilizations have distinctly different settlement patterns from other societies. The word "civilization" is sometimes simply defined as "'''living in cities''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'".&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Standage]] (2005), ''A History of the World in 6 Glasses'', Walker &amp; Company, 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Non-farmers tend to gather in cities to work and to trade.

Compared with other societies, civilizations have a more complex political structure, namely the [[State (polity)|state]].&lt;ref&gt;Grinin, Leonid E (Ed) et al. (2004), "The Early State and its Alternatives and Analogues" (Ichitel)&lt;/ref&gt; State societies are more stratified&lt;ref&gt;Bondarenko, Dmitri et al. (2004), "Alternatives to Social Evolution" in Grinin op cit.&lt;/ref&gt; than other societies; there is a greater difference among the social classes. The [[ruling class]], normally concentrated in the cities, has control over much of the surplus and exercises its will through the actions of a [[Forms of government|government]] or [[bureaucracy]]. [[Morton Fried]], a [[conflict theory|conflict theorist]] and [[Elman Service]], an integration theorist, have classified human cultures based on political systems and [[social inequality]]. This system of classification contains four categories&lt;ref&gt;Bogucki, Peter (1999), "The Origins of Human Society" (Wiley Blackwell)&lt;/ref&gt;

Economically, civilizations display more complex patterns of ownership and exchange than less organized societies. Living in one place allows people to accumulate more [[Ownership|personal possessions]] than nomadic people. Some people also acquire [[landed property]], or private ownership of the land. Because a percentage of people in civilizations do not grow their own food, they must [[trade]] their goods and services for food in a [[Market (economics)|market]] system, or receive food through the levy of [[tribute]], redistributive [[taxation]], [[tariffs]] or [[tithe]]s from the food producing segment of the population. Early human cultures functioned through a [[gift economy]] supplemented by limited [[barter]] systems. By the early [[Iron Age]], contemporary civilizations developed [[money]] as a medium of exchange for increasingly complex transactions. In a village, the potter makes a pot for the brewer and the brewer compensates the potter by giving him a certain amount of beer. In a city, the potter may need a new roof, the roofer may need new shoes, the cobbler may need new horseshoes, the blacksmith may need a new coat and the tanner may need a new pot. These people may not be personally acquainted with one another and their needs may not occur all at the same time. A monetary system is a way of organizing these obligations to ensure that they are fulfilled. From the days of the earliest monetarized civilizations, monopolistic controls of monetary systems have benefited the social and political elites.

[[Writing]], developed first by people in [[Sumer]], is considered a hallmark of civilization and "appears to accompany the rise of complex administrative bureaucracies or the conquest state".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ancient Cahokia and the Mississippians|last=Pauketat|first=Timothy R.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2004|isbn=9780521520669|location=|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traders and bureaucrats relied on writing to keep accurate records. Like money, writing was necessitated by the size of the population of a city and the complexity of its commerce among people who are not all personally acquainted with each other. However, writing is not always necessary for civilization, as shown the [[Inca]] civilization of the Andes, which did not use writing at all except from a complex recording system consisting of cords and nodes instead: the "Quipus", whose still functioned as a civilized society.

[[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] philosopher and scientist [[Aristotle]]]]
Aided by their division of labour and central government planning, civilizations have developed many other diverse cultural traits. These include organized [[religion]], development in the [[arts]], and countless new advances in [[science]] and [[technology]].

Through history, successful civilizations have spread, taking over more and more territory, and assimilating more and more previously-uncivilized people. Nevertheless, some tribes or people remain uncivilized even to this day. These cultures are called by some "[[primitive culture|primitive]]", a term that is regarded by others as pejorative. "Primitive" implies in some way that a culture is "first" (Latin = ''primus''), that it has not changed since the dawn of humanity, though this has been demonstrated not to be true. Specifically, as all of today's cultures are contemporaries, today's so-called primitive cultures are in no way antecedent to those we consider civilized. Anthropologists today use the term "[[Protohistoric archaeology|non-literate]]" to describe these peoples.

Civilization has been spread by [[colonization]], [[imperialism|invasion]], [[religious conversion]], the extension of [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic control]] and [[trade]], and by introducing agriculture and writing to non-literate peoples. Some non-civilized people may willingly adapt to civilized behaviour. But civilization is also spread by the technical, material and social dominance that civilization engenders.

Assessments of what level of civilization a polity has reached are based on comparisons of the relative importance of agricultural as opposed to trade or manufacturing capacities, the territorial extensions of its power, the complexity of its [[division of labor|division of labour]], and the carrying capacity of its [[urbanism|urban centres]]. Secondary elements include a developed transportation system, writing, standardized measurement, currency, contractual and [[tort]]-based legal systems, art, architecture, mathematics, scientific understanding, [[metallurgy]], political structures and organized religion.

Traditionally, polities that managed to achieve notable military, ideological and economic power defined themselves as "civilized" as opposed to other societies or human groupings outside their sphere of influence&amp;nbsp;– calling the latter [[barbarians]], [[wikt:savages|savages]], and [[primitive culture|primitives]]. In a modern-day context, "civilized people" have been contrasted with [[indigenous people]] or [[tribal societies]].

== Cultural identity ==
{{further|Cultural area}}
&lt;!-- [[File:Persepolis iran.jpg;The king of Holy Kingdon Rum kneel of the king of Arabia]] comment to remove redlinked img--&gt;
"Civilization" can also refer to the [[culture]] of a complex society, not just the society itself. Every society, civilization or not, has a specific set of ideas and customs, and a certain set of manufactures and arts that make it unique. Civilizations tend to develop intricate cultures, including a [[state (polity)|state]]-based [[decision making]] apparatus, a [[literature]], professional [[art]], [[architecture]], organized [[religion]] and complex customs of [[education]], [[coercion]] and control associated with maintaining the elite.

[[File:Clash_of_Civilizations_mapn2.png|thumb|upright=2.0|A world map of major civilizations according to the political hypothesis ''[[Clash of Civilizations]]'' by [[Samuel P. Huntington]]]]

The intricate culture associated with civilization has a tendency to spread to and influence other cultures, sometimes assimilating them into the civilization (a classic example being [[China|Chinese]] civilization and its influence on nearby civilizations such as Korea, Japan and Vietnam). Many civilizations are actually large cultural spheres containing many nations and regions. The civilization in which someone lives is that person's broadest cultural identity.

Many historians have focused on these broad cultural spheres and have treated civilizations as discrete units. Early twentieth-century philosopher [[Oswald Spengler]],&lt;ref name="Spengler, Oswald 1919"&gt;Spengler, Oswald, ''Decline of the West: Perspectives of World History'' (1919)&lt;/ref&gt; uses the German word ''Kultur'', "culture", for what many call a "civilization". Spengler believed a civilization's coherence is based on a single primary cultural symbol. Cultures experience cycles of birth, life, decline and death, often supplanted by a potent new culture, formed around a compelling new cultural symbol. Spengler states civilization is the beginning of the decline of a culture as "the most external and artificial states of which a species of developed humanity is capable".&lt;ref name="Spengler, Oswald 1919" /&gt;

This "unified culture" concept of civilization also influenced the theories of historian [[Arnold J. Toynbee]] in the mid-twentieth century. Toynbee explored civilization processes in his multi-volume ''[[A Study of History]],'' which traced the rise and, in most cases, the decline of 21 civilizations and five "arrested civilizations". Civilizations generally declined and fell, according to Toynbee, because of the failure of a "creative minority", through moral or religious decline, to meet some important challenge, rather than mere economic or environmental causes.

[[Samuel P. Huntington]] defines civilization as "the highest cultural grouping of people and the broadest level of cultural identity people have short of that which distinguishes humans from other species". Huntington's theories about civilizations are discussed [[Civilization#Future|below]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LO4xG-bH1CQC&amp;pg=PA43 |title=The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order |last=Huntington |first=Samuel P. |date=1997 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=9781416561248 |page=43 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Complex systems ==
Another group of theorists, making use of [[systems theory]], looks at a civilization as a [[complex system]], i.e., a framework by which a group of objects can be analysed that work in concert to produce some result. Civilizations can be seen as networks of cities that emerge from pre-urban cultures and are defined by the economic, political, military, diplomatic, social and cultural interactions among them. Any organization is a complex [[social system]] and a civilization is a large organization. Systems theory helps guard against superficial but misleading analogies in the study and description of civilizations.

Systems theorists look at many types of relations between cities, including economic relations, cultural exchanges and political/diplomatic/military relations. These spheres often occur on different scales. For example, trade networks were, until the nineteenth century, much larger than either cultural spheres or political spheres. Extensive trade routes, including the [[Silk Road]] through [[Central Asia]] and [[Indian Ocean]] sea routes linking the [[Roman Empire]], [[History of Iran|Persian Empire]], India and China, were well established 2000 years ago, when these civilizations scarcely shared any political, diplomatic, military, or cultural relations. The first evidence of such long distance trade is in the [[Ancient history|ancient world]]. During the [[Uruk period]], Guillermo Algaze has argued that trade relations connected Egypt, Mesopotamia, Iran and Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;Algaze, Guillermo, ''The Uruk World System: The Dynamics of Expansion of Early Mesopotamian Civilization'' (Second Edition, 2004) ({{ISBN|978-0-226-01382-4}})&lt;/ref&gt; Resin found later in the [[Royal Cemetery at Ur]] is suggested was traded northwards from Mozambique.

Many theorists argue that the entire world has already become integrated into a single "[[world-system theory|world system]]", a process known as [[globalization]]. Different civilizations and societies all over the globe are economically, politically, and even culturally interdependent in many ways. There is debate over when this integration began, and what sort of integration – cultural, technological, economic, political, or military-diplomatic – is the key indicator in determining the extent of a civilization. [[David Wilkinson (political scientist)|David Wilkinson]] has proposed that economic and military-diplomatic integration of the [[Mesopotamia]]n and [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] civilizations resulted in the creation of what he calls the "Central Civilization" around 1500 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://ojs.lib.byu.edu/spc/index.php/CCR/article/view/12262/12162|title=Central Civilization|last1=Wilkinson|first1=David|author-link1=David Wilkinson (political scientist)|journal=[[Comparative Civilizations Review]]|volume=17|issue=|date=Fall 1987|pages=31–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Central Civilization later expanded to include the entire Middle East and Europe, and then expanded to a global scale with European colonization, integrating the Americas, Australia, China and Japan by the nineteenth century. According to Wilkinson, civilizations can be culturally heterogeneous, like the Central Civilization, or homogeneous, like the Japanese civilization. What Huntington calls the "clash of civilizations" might be characterized by Wilkinson as a clash of cultural spheres within a single global civilization. Others point to the [[Crusades]] as the first step in globalization. The more conventional viewpoint is that networks of societies have expanded and shrunk since [[Ancient history|ancient times]], and that the current globalized economy and culture is a product of recent European colonialism. {{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

{{See also|History of the world}}

The notion of [[world history]] as a succession of "civilizations" is an entirely modern one.
In the European [[Age of Discovery]], emerging [[Modernity]] was put into stark contrast with the
[[Neolithic]] and [[Mesolithic]]  stage of the cultures of the [[New World]], suggesting
that the complex states had emerged at some time in prehistory.&lt;ref&gt;
"Explicit theories of the origin of the state are relatively modern [...] the age of exploration, by making Europeans aware that many peoples throughout the world lived, not in states, but in independent villages or tribes, made the state seem less natural, and thus more in need of explanation."
{{cite web |url=http://72.52.202.216/~fenderse/Carneiro.htm |title=A Theory of the Origin of the State |accessdate=2014-08-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140530140606/http://72.52.202.216/~fenderse/Carneiro.htm |archivedate=30 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt;
The term "civilization" as it is now most commonly understood, a complex state with centralisation,  social stratification and specialization of labour, corresponds to early empires that arise in the [[Fertile Crescent]] in the [[Early Bronze Age]], around roughly 3000 BC.
[[Gordon Childe]] defined the emergence of civilization as the result of two successive revolutions: the [[Neolithic Revolution]], triggering the development of settled communities, and the [[Urban Revolution]].

===Urban Revolution===
{{Main article|Neolithic|Bronze Age|Cradle of Civilization}}
At first, the [[Neolithic]] was associated with shifting subsistence cultivation, where continuous farming led to the depletion of soil fertility resulting in the requirement to cultivate fields further and further removed from the settlement, eventually compelling the settlement itself to move. In major semi-arid river valleys, annual flooding renewed soil fertility every year, with the result that population densities could rise significantly.
This encouraged a [[secondary products revolution]] in which people used domesticated animals not just for meat, but also for milk, wool, manure and pulling ploughs and carts&amp;nbsp;– a development that spread through the Eurasian Oecumene.

The earlier neolithic technology and lifestyle was established first in Western Asia (for example at [[Göbekli Tepe]], from about 9,130 BCE), and later in the [[Yellow River]] and [[Yangtze]] basins in China (for example the [[Pengtoushan]] culture from 7,500 BCE), and later spread.
[[Mesopotamia]] is the site of the earliest developments of the Neolithic Revolution from around 10,000 BCE, with civilizations developing from 6,500 years ago. This area has been identified as having "inspired some of the most important developments in [[History of the world|human history]] including the invention of the [[wheel]], the development of [[cuneiform]] script, [[mathematics]], [[astronomy]] and [[agriculture]]."&lt;ref name="historyandpolicy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/papers/policy-paper-13.html|title=Iraq, past, present and future: a thoroughly-modern mandate?|last=Milton-Edwards|first=Beverley|date=May 2003|work=History &amp; Policy|publisher=History &amp; Policy|accessdate=9 December 2010|location=United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Similar pre-civilized "neolithic revolutions" also began independently from 7,000 BCE in northwestern [[South America]] (the [[Norte Chico civilization]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Haas |first=Jonathan |last2=Creamer |first2=Winifred |last3=Ruiz |first3=Alvaro |date=December 2004 |title=Dating the Late Archaic occupation of the Norte Chico region in Peru |url= |journal=Nature |language=En |volume=432 |issue=7020 |pages=1020–1023 |doi=10.1038/nature03146 |issn=0028-0836 |pmid=15616561}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mesoamerica]].&lt;ref&gt;Kennett, Douglas J.; Winterhalder, Bruce (2006).

The [[8.2 kiloyear event|8.2 Kiloyear Arid Event]] and the [[5.9 kiloyear event|5.9 Kiloyear]] [[Pluvial|Interpluvial]] saw the drying out of semiarid regions and a major spread of deserts.&lt;ref&gt;De Meo, James (2nd Edition), "Saharasia"&lt;/ref&gt;  This climate change shifted the cost-benefit ratio of [[endemic warfare|endemic violence]] between communities, which saw the abandonment of unwalled village communities and the appearance of walled cities, associated with the first civilizations.

[[File:Lascar Avenue of the Dead and the Pyramid of the Sun in the background (4566574277).jpg|thumb|The ruins of [[Mesoamerica]]n city [[Teotihuacan]]]]
This "[[urban revolution]]" marked the beginning of the accumulation of transferrable surpluses, which helped economies and cities develop. It was associated with the state monopoly of violence, the appearance of a soldier class and endemic warfare, the rapid development of hierarchies, and the appearance of human sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;"Ritual human sacrifice promoted and sustained the evolution of stratified societies" op cit{{huh|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The civilized urban revolution in turn was dependent upon the development of [[sedentism]], the domestication of grains and animals and development of lifestyles that facilitated [[economies of scale]] and accumulation of surplus production by certain social sectors.  The transition from ''complex cultures'' to ''civilizations'', while still disputed, seems to be associated with the development of state structures, in which power was further monopolized by an elite ruling class&lt;ref&gt;Carniero, R.L. (Ed) (1967), "The Evolution of Society: Selections from Herbert Spencer’s Principles of Sociology", (Univ. of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1967), pp. 32–47, 63–96, 153–165.&lt;/ref&gt; who practised human sacrifice.&lt;ref name="nature.com"&gt;{{cite journal|first1 = Joseph |last1 = Watts|first2 =Oliver|last2 = Sheehan|first3 = Quentin D.|last3 = Atkinson|first4 = Joseph|last4 = Bulbulia|first5 = Russell D.|last5= Gray|title = Ritual human sacrifice promoted and sustained the evolution of stratified societies|journal =Nature |volume = 532|issue = 532|pages = 228–231|date = 4 April 2016|url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v532/n7598/full/nature17159.html |doi = 10.1038/nature17159|pmid = 27042932}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of the Neolithic period, various elitist [[Chalcolithic]] civilizations began to rise in various [[Cradle of civilisation|"cradles"]] from around 3300 BCE, expanding into large-scale [[empire]]s in the course of the Bronze Age ([[Old Kingdom of Egypt]], [[Akkadian Empire]], [[Assyrian Empire]], [[Old Assyrian Empire]], [[Hittite Empire]]).

A parallel development took place independently in the [[Pre-Columbian Americas]], where the [[Mayan civilization|Mayans]] began to be [[Maya city|urbanised]] around 500 BCE, and the fully fledged [[Aztec Empire|Aztec]] and [[Inca Empire|Inca]] emerged by the 15th century, briefly before European contact.

=== Axial Age ===
{{Main article|Axial Age}}
{{further|Iron Age|Hinduism|Christianization|Spread of Buddhism|Spread of Islam}}
The [[Bronze Age collapse]] was followed by the Iron Age around 1200 BCE, during which a number of new civilizations emerged, culminating in a period from the 8th to the 3rd century BCE which  [[Karl Jaspers]] termed the [[Axial Age]], presented as a critical transitional phase leading to [[Classical antiquity|classical civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;Tarnas, Richard (1993). ''The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View'' (Ballantine Books)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[William Hardy McNeill]] proposed that this period of history was one in which culture contact between previously separate civilizations saw the "closure of the [[oecumene]]" and led to accelerated social change from China to the Mediterranean, associated with the spread of coinage, larger empires and new religions. This view has recently been championed by Christopher Chase-Dunn and other [[world systems theory|world systems theorists]].

== Fall of civilizations ==
{{prose|section|date=July 2013}}
{{Main article|Societal collapse}}
Civilizations have generally ended in one of two ways; either through being incorporated into another expanding civilization (e.g. As Ancient Egypt was incorporated into Hellenistic Greek, and subsequently Roman civilizations), or by collapse and reversion to a simpler form, as happens in what are called Dark Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Toynbee, Arnold (1965) "A Study of History" (OUP)&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been many explanations put forward for the collapse of civilization. Some focus on historical examples, and others on general theory.
* [[Ibn Khaldūn]]'s ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' influenced theories of the analysis, growth and decline of the Islamic civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Massimo Campanini (2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=5DoasQxzvNQC&amp;pg=PA75 ''Studies on Ibn Khaldûn''], Polimetrica s.a.s., p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested repeated invasions from nomadic peoples limited development and led to social collapse.[[File:Invasions of the Roman Empire 1.png|thumb|[[Migration Period|Barbarian invasions]] played an important role in the fall of the [[Roman Empire]].]] 
* [[Edward Gibbon]]'s work ''[[The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' was a well-known and detailed analysis of the fall of Roman civilization. Gibbon suggested the final act of the collapse of Rome was the fall of [[Constantinople]] to the [[Ottoman Turks]] in 1453 CE. For Gibbon, "The decline of Rome was the natural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatness. Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the cause of the destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. The story of the ruin is simple and obvious; and instead of inquiring why the Roman Empire was destroyed, we should rather be surprised that it has subsisted for so long".&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon, ''Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', 2nd ed., vol. 4, ed. by J. B. Bury (London, 1909), pp.&amp;nbsp;173–174. Chapter XXXVIII: Reign Of Clovis. Part VI. General Observations On The Fall Of The Roman Empire In The West.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Theodor Mommsen]] in his ''[[History of Rome (Mommsen)|History of Rome]]'' suggested Rome collapsed with the collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]] in 476 CE and he also tended towards a biological analogy of "genesis", "growth", "senescence", "collapse" and "decay".
* [[Oswald Spengler]], in his ''[[Decline of the West]]'' rejected [[Petrarch]]'s chronological division, and suggested that there had been only eight "mature civilizations". Growing cultures, he argued, tend to develop into imperialistic civilizations, which expand and ultimately collapse, with democratic forms of government ushering in [[plutocracy]] and ultimately [[imperialism]].
* [[Arnold J. Toynbee]] in his ''[[A Study of History]]'' suggested that there had been a much larger number of civilizations, including a small number of arrested civilizations, and that all civilizations tended to go through the cycle identified by Mommsen. The cause of the fall of a civilization occurred when a cultural [[elite]] became a [[parasitic]] elite, leading to the rise of internal and external [[proletariat]]s.
* [[Joseph Tainter]] in ''[[Societal collapse|The Collapse of Complex Societies]]'' suggested that there were [[diminishing returns]] to [[complexity]], due to which, as states achieved a maximum permissible complexity, they would decline when further increases actually produced a negative return. Tainter suggested that Rome achieved this figure in the 2nd century CE.
* [[Jared Diamond]] in his 2005 book ''[[Collapse (book)|Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]]'' suggests five major reasons for the collapse of 41 studied cultures: environmental damage, such as [[deforestation]] and [[soil erosion]]; [[climate change]]; dependence upon [[international trade|long-distance trade]] for needed resources; increasing levels of internal and external violence, such as war or invasion; and societal responses to internal and environmental problems.
* [[Peter Turchin]] in his [https://web.archive.org/web/20060830212141/http://www.eeb.uconn.edu/faculty/turchin/HistDyn.htm ''Historical Dynamics''] and [[Andrey Korotayev]] ''et al.'' in their [http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=172&amp;Itemid=70 ''Introduction to Social Macrodynamics, Secular Cycles, and Millennial Trends''] suggest a number of mathematical models describing collapse of agrarian civilizations. For example, the basic logic of Turchin's "fiscal-demographic" model can be outlined as follows: during the initial phase of a sociodemographic [[Social cycle theory|cycle]] we observe relatively high levels of per capita production and consumption, which leads not only to relatively high [[population growth]] rates, but also to relatively high rates of surplus production. As a result, during this phase the population can afford to pay taxes without great problems, the taxes are quite easily collectible, and the population growth is accompanied by the growth of state revenues. During the intermediate phase, the increasing [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] leads to the decrease of per capita production and consumption levels, it becomes more and more difficult to collect taxes, and state revenues stop growing, whereas the state expenditures grow due to the growth of the population controlled by the state. As a result, during this phase the state starts experiencing considerable fiscal problems. During the final pre-collapse phases the overpopulation leads to further decrease of per capita production, the surplus production further decreases, state revenues shrink, but the state needs more and more resources to control the growing (though with lower and lower rates) population. Eventually this leads to famines, epidemics, state breakdown, and demographic and civilization collapse (Peter Turchin. ''Historical Dynamics.'' [[Princeton University Press]], 2003:121–127; [[Andrey Korotayev]] et al. [http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=302&amp;Itemid=70 Secular Cycles and Millennial Trends. Moscow: Russian Academy of Sciences, 2006]).
* [[Peter Heather]] argues in his book ''[[Decline of the Roman Empire#Peter Heather|The Fall of the Roman Empire: a New History of Rome and the Barbarians]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter J. Heather|title=The Fall Of The Roman Empire: A New History Of Rome And The Barbarians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wCOJfTB7HtgC|accessdate=22 June 2012|date=1 December 2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-515954-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; that this civilization did not end for moral or economic reasons, but because centuries of contact with barbarians across the frontier generated its own nemesis by making them a much more sophisticated and dangerous adversary. The fact that Rome needed to generate ever greater revenues to equip and re-equip armies that were for the first time repeatedly defeated in the field, led to the dismemberment of the Empire. Although this argument is specific to Rome, it can also be applied to the Asiatic Empire of the Egyptians, to the [[Han Dynasty|Han]] and [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] dynasties of China, to the Muslim [[Abbasid Caliphate]] and others.
* [[Bryan Ward-Perkins]], in his book ''The Fall of Rome and the End of Civilization'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bryan Ward-Perkins|title=The Fall of Rome: And the End of Civilization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2vSUh9KbfKAC|accessdate=22 June 2012|date=7 September 2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-280728-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows the real horrors associated with the collapse of a civilization for the people who suffer its effects, unlike many revisionist historians who downplay this. The collapse of complex society meant that even basic plumbing disappeared from the continent for 1,000 years. Similar [[Greek dark ages|Dark Age]] collapses are seen with the Late [[Bronze Age collapse]] in the Eastern Mediterranean, the collapse of the [[Maya civilization|Maya]], on [[Easter Island]] and elsewhere.
* [[Arthur Demarest]] argues in ''[[Ancient Maya: The Rise and Fall of a Rainforest Civilization]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|0-521-53390-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; using a holistic perspective to the most recent evidence from archaeology, [[paleoecology]], and epigraphy, that no one explanation is sufficient but that a series of erratic, complex events, including loss of soil fertility, drought and rising levels of internal and external violence led to the disintegration of the courts of Mayan kingdoms, which began a spiral of decline and decay. He argues that the collapse of the Maya has lessons for civilization today.
* Jeffrey A. McNeely has recently suggested that "a review of historical evidence shows that past civilizations have tended to [[over-exploit]] their forests, and that such abuse of important resources has been a significant factor in the decline of the over-exploiting society".&lt;ref&gt;McNeely, Jeffrey A. (1994) "Lessons of the past: Forests and Biodiversity" (Vol 3, No 1 1994. Biodiversity and Conservation)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Thomas Homer-Dixon]] in [http://www.theupsideofdown.com/ ''The Upside of Down: Catastrophe, Creativity, and the Renewal of Civilization''], where he considers that the fall in the [[EROEI|energy return on investments]]. The energy expended to energy yield ratio is central to limiting the survival of civilizations. The degree of social complexity is associated strongly, he suggests, with the amount of disposable energy environmental, economic and technological systems allow. When this amount decreases civilizations either have to access new energy sources or they will collapse.
* [[Feliks Koneczny]] in his work "On the Plurality of Civilizations"  calls his study the science on civilizations. Civilizations fall not because they must or there exist some cyclical or a "biological" life span. There still exist two ancient civilizations&amp;nbsp;– Brahmin-Hindu and Chinese&amp;nbsp;– which are not ready to fall any time soon. Koneczny claimed that civilizations cannot be mixed into hybrids, an inferior civilization when given equal rights within a highly developed civilization will overcome it. One of Koneczny's claims in his study on civilizations is that "a person cannot be civilized in two or more ways" without falling into what he calls an "abcivilized state" (as in abnormal). He also stated that when two or more civilizations exist next to one another and as long as they are vital, they will be in an existential combat imposing its own "method of organizing social life" upon the other.&lt;ref&gt;Koneczny, Feliks (1962) On the Plurality of Civilizations, Posthumous English translation by Polonica Publications, London {{ASIN|B0000CLABJ}}. Originally published in Polish, O Wielości Cywilizacyj, Gebethner &amp; Wolff, Kraków 1935.&lt;/ref&gt; Absorbing alien "method of organizing social life" that is civilization and giving it equal rights yields a process of decay and decomposition.

Political scientist [[Samuel P. Huntington|Samuel Huntington]]&lt;ref&gt;Huntington, Samuel P., ''The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order'', (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;, has argued that the defining characteristic of the 21st century will be a [[clash of civilizations]]. According to Huntington, conflicts between civilizations will supplant the conflicts between [[nation-state]]s and ideologies that characterized the 19th and 20th centuries. These views have been strongly challenged by others like [[Edward Said]], Muhammed Asadi and [[Amartya Sen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.selvesandothers.org/article15618.html |title=A Critique of Huntington's "Clash of Civilizations" |last=Asadi |first=Muhammed |date=22 January 2007 |publisher=Selves and Others |accessdate=23 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426042806/http://www.selvesandothers.org/article15618.html |archivedate=26 April 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ronald Inglehart]] and [[Pippa Norris]] have argued that the "true clash of civilizations" between the Muslim world and the West is caused by the Muslim rejection of the West's more liberal sexual values, rather than a difference in political ideology, although they note that this lack of tolerance is likely to lead to an eventual rejection of (true) democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/globaliz/cultural/2003/0304clash.htm|title=The True Clash of Civilizations|last=Inglehart|first=Ronald|author2=Pippa Norris|date=March–April 2003|publisher=Global Policy Forum|accessdate=23 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Identity and Violence'' Sen questions if people should be divided along the lines of a supposed "civilization", defined by religion and culture only. He argues that this ignores the many others identities that make up people and leads to a focus on differences.

Cultural Historian [[Morris Berman]] suggests in ''Dark Ages America: the End of Empire'' that in the corporate consumerist United States, the very factors that once propelled it to greatness―extreme individualism, territorial and economic expansion, and the pursuit of material wealth―have pushed the United States across a critical threshold where collapse is inevitable. Politically associated with over-reach, and as a result of the environmental exhaustion and polarization of wealth between rich and poor, he concludes the current system is fast arriving at a situation where continuation of the existing system saddled with huge deficits and a hollowed-out economy is physically, socially, economically and politically impossible.&lt;ref&gt;Berman, Morris (2007), ''Dark Ages America: the End of Empire'' (W.W. Norton)&lt;/ref&gt;  Although developed in much more depth, Berman's thesis is similar in some ways to that of Urban Planner, [[Jane Jacobs]] who argues that the five pillars of United States culture are in serious decay: community and family; higher education; the effective practice of science; taxation and government; and the self-regulation of the learned professions. The corrosion of these pillars, Jacobs argues, is linked to societal ills such as environmental crisis, racism and the growing gulf between rich and poor.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Jane (2005), ''Dark Age Ahead'' (Vintage)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some environmental scientists also see the world entering a [[Planetary Phase of Civilization]], characterized by a shift away from independent, disconnected nation-states to a world of increased global connectivity with worldwide institutions, environmental challenges, economic systems, and consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orionsociety.org/pages/oo/sidebars/America/Rockefeller.html Orion Thoughts on America&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515112558/http://www.orionsociety.org/pages/oo/sidebars/America/Rockefeller.html |date=15 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kosmosjournal.org/kjo/backissue/s2006/laszlo-1.shtml Kosmos Journal Paths to Planetary Civilization&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060712162009/http://www.kosmosjournal.org/kjo/backissue/s2006/laszlo-1.shtml |date=12 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to better understand what a Planetary Phase of Civilization might look like in the current context of declining natural resources and increasing consumption, the [[Global scenario group]] used [[scenario analysis]] to arrive at three archetypal futures: Barbarization, in which increasing conflicts result in either a fortress world or complete societal breakdown; Conventional Worlds, in which market forces or policy reform slowly precipitate more sustainable practices; and a Great Transition, in which either the sum of fragmented [[Eco-Communalism]] movements add up to a sustainable world or globally coordinated efforts and initiatives result in a new [[sustainability]] paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gtinitiative.org/documents/Great_Transitions.pdf GTinitiative.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814021505/http://www.gtinitiative.org/documents/Great_Transitions.pdf |date=14 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cultural critic]] and author [[Derrick Jensen]] argues that modern civilization is directed towards the domination of the environment and humanity itself in an intrinsically harmful, unsustainable, and self-destructive fashion.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, Derrick (2006), "Endgame: The Problem of Civilization", Vol 1 &amp; Vol 2 (Seven Stories Press)&lt;/ref&gt; Defending his definition both linguistically and historically, he defines civilization as "a culture... that both leads to and emerges from the growth of cities", with "cities" defined as "people living more or less permanently in one place in densities high enough to require the routine importation of food and other necessities of life".&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, Derrick (2006), "Endgame: The Problem of Civilization", Vol 1 (Seven Stories Press), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; This need for civilizations to import ever more resources, he argues, stems from their over-exploitation and diminution of their own local resources. Therefore, civilizations inherently adopt imperialist and expansionist policies and, to maintain these, highly militarized, hierarchically structured, and coercion-based cultures and lifestyles.

The [[Kardashev scale]] classifies civilizations based on their level of technological advancement, specifically measured by the amount of energy a civilization is able to harness. The Kardashev scale makes provisions for civilizations far more technologically advanced than any currently known to exist (see also: [[Civilizations and the Future]] and [[Space civilization]]).

{{short description|Muse of history in Ancient Greek mythology}}
[[File:Statue of Clio in Berlin.jpg|thumb|Statue of Clio by [[Albert Moritz Wolff]] in Berlin ]]

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Clio''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|l|iː|oʊ}}, {{small|more rarely}} {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|l|aɪ|oʊ}}; {{lang-el|Κλειώ}}, ''Kleiṓ''; "made famous" or "to make famous"), also spelled '''Kleio''',&lt;ref name=Comp&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author=Harvey, Paul |title=Clio/Kleio |encyclopedia =The Oxford Companion to Classical Literature |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=1984 |edition=Revised 1984 |isbn=0-19-281490-7 |page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[muse]] of history,&lt;ref name=Encyc/&gt; or in a few mythological accounts, the muse of lyre playing.&lt;ref name=Morford&gt;{{cite book|author1=Morford, Mark P. O. |author2=Lenardon, Robert J.  |title=Classical Mythology |publisher=David McKay Company |location=New York |year=1971 |isbn=0-679-30028-7 |pages=56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Mythology ==
Clio, sometimes referred to as "the Proclaimer", is often represented with an open parchment scroll, a book, or a set of tablets. The name is etymologically derived from the Greek root κλέω/κλείω (meaning "to recount," "to make famous,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Clio and the Poets: Augustan Poetry and the Traditions of Ancient Historiography|author=D. S. Levene, Damien P. Nelis|publisher=Brill Academic Publishers|year=2002|isbn=90-04-11782-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "to celebrate").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.memphis.edu/history/clio.htm|title=Clio|date=November 2, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100624044213/http://www.memphis.edu/history/clio.htm|archive-date=June 24, 2010|dead-url=yes|accessdate=October 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like all the muses, she is a daughter of [[Zeus]] and the [[Titan (mythology)|Titaness]] [[Mnemosyne]], goddess of memory. Along with her sister Muses, she is considered to dwell at either [[Mount Helicon]] or [[Mount Parnassos]].&lt;ref name="Encyc"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author=Leeming, David |title=Muses |encyclopedia= The Oxford Companion to World Mythology |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-19-515669-0|page=274}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other common locations for the Muses are [[Pieria (regional unit)|Pieria]] in [[Thessaly]], near to [[Mount Olympus]].&lt;ref name="Morford" /&gt; She had one son, [[Hyacinth (mythology)|Hyacinth]], with one of several kings, in various myths—with [[Pierus (father of Hyacinth)|Pierus]] or with king [[Oebalus]] of [[Sparta]], or with king [[Amyclas]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Pseudo-Apollodorus]] 3. 10.3; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] 3. 1.3, 19.4&lt;/ref&gt; progenitor of the people of Amyclae, dwellers about Sparta.  Some sources say she is also the mother of [[Hymenaios]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Other accounts credit her as the mother of [[Linus (mythology)|Linus]], a poet who was buried at [[Argos]], although Linus has a number of differing parents depending upon the account, including several accounts in which he is the son of Clio's sisters [[Urania]] or [[Calliope]].&lt;ref name="Graves"&gt;{{cite book|author=Graves, Robert |title=The Greek Myths |volume=2 |publisher=Penguin |location=London |year=1960 |edition=1960 revised |pages=212–213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
In her capacity as "the proclaimer, glorifier and celebrator of history, great deeds and accomplishments,"&lt;ref name="GUIDE"&gt;Carder, Sheri: [https://books.google.com/books?id=U3rJxPYT32MC&amp;pg=PA180&amp;lpg=PA180&amp;dq=1993+Clio+award&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oofl86zCJ_&amp;sig=Rd-DUO1ZsVcuIJ7qeDxrUp6oUe8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fbrFTNaNLYW8lQeAwYzkDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CBoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=1993%20Clio%20award&amp;f=false "Clio Awards"] ''The Guide to United States popular culture'', pages 180–181, {{ISBN|978-0-87972-821-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clio is the namesake of various modern brands, including the [[Clio Awards]] for excellence in advertising. The [[Cambridge University]] History Society is informally referred to as Clio, similarly, the [[Cleo of Alpha Chi]] society at [[Trinity College, Hartford|Trinity College, Connecticut]] is named after the muse. 'Clio' also represents [[history]] in some coined words in academic usage: [[cliometrics]], [[cliodynamics]].

'''Curtis Bay''' is a residential / commercial / industrial [[List of Baltimore neighborhoods|neighborhood]] in the southern portion of the [[Baltimore|City of Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], [[United States]].

The neighborhood is on steep sloping heights, about four city blocks wide (west to east) and fifteen blocks long (north to south) and above and surrounded on three sides (northeast - east - southeast) in a highly [[industrialisation|industrialized]] waterfront area  in the southern part of the city, and receives its name from the body ([[cove]]) of water to the east in which it sits.  The cove of "Curtis Bay"  with two small branches - Stone House Cove and Cabin Branch is fed from the southwest by [[Curtis Creek (Maryland)|Curtis Creek]] which in turn is formed further south by Marley Creek and Furnace Branch/Creek in [[Anne Arundel County]]. Adjoining nearby to the east is Thoms Cove near Hawkins Point at the north end of the Marley Neck peninsula. Curtis Bay cove itself also has a dredged deep water channel with considerable port facilities and waterfront industries and is a branch of the main stem of the [[Patapsco River]], which forms the extensive frontage of [[Helen Delich Bentley Port of Baltimore|Baltimore Harbor and Port]], northwest off of the [[Chesapeake Bay]].

The residential community of Curtis Bay is along three major north-south  thoroughfares of Curtis Avenue, Pennington Avenue ([[Maryland Route 173]] on which most commercial businesses are located) and residential Fairhaven Avenue and a partial street of Prudence Street. Running west to east are fifteen smaller residential streets named alphabetically for various types of trees. 
"The Bay", as it is often called colloquially,  also offers a variety of housing, [[townhouse]]s, [[Terraced house|rowhouse]]s, individual homes, (both constructed of wood-frame, brick, stone and concrete block/stuccoed) and corner stores, taverns/bars.

Curtis Bay is also home since 1897 to the [[United States Coast Guard Yard]] 
(formerly the [[United States Revenue Cutter Service|U.S. Revenue Cutter Service]] until 1915)  on Hawkins Point Road / extending south from Pennington Avenue ([[Maryland Route 173]]) on Arundel Cove off [[Curtis Creek (Maryland)|Curtis Creek]] on the border line with neighboring suburban [[Anne Arundel County]] to the south.
During the middle and late 19th and early 20th centuries, a [[Quarantine Station]]  and [[lazaretto]] run by the United States Government agency (future [[United States Public Health Service|U.S. Public Health Service]]) along Thoms Cove between Sledds Point and Hawkins Point.

There is a large [[Polish American]] community in Curtis Bay. The former town hall, real estate office, volunteer fire station, and meeting/assembly hall on the second floor for Curtis Bay was constructed  on the heights overlooking the new town and rapidly developing industrial waterfront along  Fairview Avenue (now Fairhaven Avenue) facing Filbert Street by a successor developing firm, the South Baltimore Harbor and Improvement Company in 1905. In 1925, the United Polish Societies purchased the building and named it [[Polish Home Hall]] and it became central to the [[Poland|Polish]] ethnic experience in Curtis Bay, functioning as a social, educational, and political center for Curtis Bay's [[History of the Poles in Baltimore|Polish community]] into the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{MHT url|id=1537}}|title=Maryland Historical Trust|date=2008-11-21|work= Polish Home Hall, Baltimore City|publisher=Maryland Historical Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eddie August Schneider (1911-1940) death certificate.gif|thumb|[[Eddie August Schneider]]'s (1911-1940) death certificate, issued in [[New York (state)|New York]].]]
The phrase '''death certificate''' can refer either to a document issued by a medical practitioner certifying the deceased state of a person or, popularly, to a document issued by a person such as a registrar of [[vital statistics (government records)|vital statistics]] that declares the date, location and [[cause of death|cause]] of a person's [[death]] as later entered in an official register of deaths.

==Nature of a certificate==
Each governmental jurisdiction prescribes the form of the document for use in its preview and the procedures necessary to legally produce it. One purpose of the certificate is to review the cause of death to determine if foul-play occurred as it can rule out an accidental death or a murder going by the findings and ruling of the medical examiner.  It may also be required in order to arrange a burial or cremation to provide [[Prima facia|prima facie]] evidence of the fact of death, which can be used to prove a person's will or to claim on a person's life insurance. Lastly, death certificates are used in [[public health]] to compile data on [[List of causes of death by rate|leading causes of death]] among other statistics (See: [[Descriptive statistics]])

Before issuing a death certificate, the authorities usually require a certificate from a [[physician]] or [[coroner]] to validate the [[cause of death]] and the identity of the deceased.  In cases where it is not completely clear that a person is dead (usually because their body is being sustained by [[life support]]), a [[neurologist]] is often called in to verify [[brain death]] and to fill out the appropriate documentation. The failure of a physician to immediately submit the required form to the government (to trigger issuance of the death certificate) is often both a [[crime]] and cause for loss of one's license to practice.  This is because of past scandals in which dead people continued to receive public benefits or voted in elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wftv.com/news/17848541/detail.html#-, |title=Dead People Voting Throughout Florida |date=30 Oct 2008 |work=WFTV Orlando |accessdate=26 December 2010 |location=VOLUSIA COUNTY, Fla. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523090407/http://www.wftv.com/news/17848541/detail.html |archivedate=23 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Death certificates may also be issued pursuant to a [[Court of law|court order]] or an [[Executive (government)|executive order]] in the case of individuals who have been [[declared death in absentia|declared dead ''in absentia'']]. [[Missing person]]s and victims of mass disasters (such as the sinking of the ''[[RMS Lusitania]]'') may be issued death certificates in one of these manners.

In some jurisdictions, a [[police officer]] or a [[paramedic]] may be allowed to sign a death certificate under specific circumstances. This is usually when the cause of death seems obvious and no foul play is suspected, such as in extreme old age. In such cases, an [[autopsy]] is rarely performed. This varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction; in some areas police officers may sign death certificates for victims of [[sudden infant death syndrome|SIDS]],{{Citation needed|date = July 2013}} but in others all deaths of individuals under 18 must be certified by a physician. Accident deaths where there is no chance of survival (decapitations, for instance) may be certified by police or paramedics, but autopsies are still commonly performed if there is any chance that [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] or other [[drug]]s played a role in the accident.

A full explanation of the cause of death includes four items:
* the immediate cause of death, such as the heart stopping,
* the intermediate causes, which triggered the immediate cause, such as a [[myocardial infarction]],
* the underlying causes, which triggered the chain of events leading to death, such as [[atherosclerosis]], and
* any other diseases and disorders the person had at the time of death, even though they did not directly cause the death.&lt;ref name="Altman"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/02/health/making-the-right-call-even-in-death.html|title=Making the Right Call, Even in Death|last=Altman|first=Lawrence K.|date=1 July 2013|work=The New York Times|accessdate=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public documents==
{{globalize|section|date=June 2018}}
In most of the [[United States]], death certificates are considered public domain documents and can therefore be obtained for any individual regardless of the requester's relationship to the deceased. Other jurisdictions take a different view, and restrict the issue of certificates. For example, in the State of New York, death certificates are only obtainable by close relatives, including the spouse, parent, child or sibling of the deceased, and other persons who have a documented lawful right or claim, documented medical need, or a New York State Court Order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.ny.gov/vital_records/death.htm|title=Death Certificates|publisher=New York State Department of Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In Europe and North America, death records were kept by the local churches, along with baptism and marriage records.&lt;ref name="Altman" /&gt;  In what would become the United States, the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] was the first to have the secular courts keep these records, in 1639.&lt;ref name="Altman" /&gt;  By the end of the 19th century, European countries were pursuing centralized systems for recording deaths.&lt;ref name="Altman" /&gt;

In the United States, a standard model death certificate was developed around 1910.&lt;ref name="Altman" /&gt;  This promoted uniformity and consistency in record keeping.

==Specific jurisdictions==

===United States===
[[File:John Wayne Gacy certificate of death.jpg|thumb|[[Illinois]] certificate of death issued after the execution of [[John Wayne Gacy]].]]
In the United States, certificates issued to the general public for deaths after 1990 may in some states be redacted to erase the specific cause of death (in cases where death was from [[natural causes]]) to comply with [[HIV]] [[confidentiality]] rules. In New York State, for instance, the cause of death on a general death certificate is only specified if death was accidental, homicide, suicide, or [[Declared death in absentia|declared in absentia]]; all other deaths are only referred to as [[Natural death|natural]]. All states have provisions, however, whereby immediate family members, law enforcement agencies, and governmental authorities (such as occupational health and safety groups) are able to obtain death certificates containing the full cause of death, even in cases of natural death.

In some cases, such as the death of a minor or infant, certificates may be kept confidential from the public as requested by legal guardian and therefore cannot be obtained by the general public but rather through immediate family members.

===United Kingdom===
Registration in the UK is organised separately in the constituent jurisdictions. A register of deaths contains the information supplied by an informant, nowadays usually containing and repeating the information given in a ''Medical Certificate of Death'' (MCOD) supplied by the medical practitioner who certifies that life is extinct, this being the real "death certificate" distinct from the "registration of a death" in a register. Further information might be added after the first registration if the death was the subject of an inquest (Northern Ireland or England and Wales) or a [[Fatal Accident Inquiry]] (Scotland); this can result in a later copy of a death registration giving more details of the cause of death or the associated circumstances.

====England and Wales====
In England and Wales, compulsory national registration of deaths began in 1837. Originally the death registration listed when and where a person died, their name and surname, the parent or parents (if the deceased was a child), sex, age, occupation, cause of death, the description and residence of the informant, when the death was registered and the registrar's signature. Further details have since been recorded including the deceased's date and place of birth, maiden surnames and other former surnames of women who have been divorced.

Beginning in 1879, a doctor's certificate was necessary for the issuance of a death certificate (prior to that, no cause of death needed to be given).

====Northern Ireland====
The form of indexing and the layout of register pages generally follows that of England and Wales.

====Scotland====
National registration began in 1855; registrations are rather more detailed&lt;ref name=GROS&gt;{{cite web|title=Items Included in the Main Registers |url=http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/regscot/items-included-in-the-registers.html |publisher=General Register Office for Scotland |accessdate=14 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608112918/http://gro-scotland.gov.uk/regscot/items-included-in-the-registers.html |archivedate=8 June 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  than in England and Wales. In the first year of registration many more details than in later years were recorded including the children of the deceased with their ages, the deceased's birthplace and how long they were resident in the district where they died. The burial place was recorded from 1855 to 1860. Standard details have until now included the deceased's name, age, marital status, spouse(s) (if any), details of both parents, cause of death and the informant's description. Current (2011) registrations show the date of birth. The prescribed forms are part of secondary legislation and those for recent years can thus be seen online in the [http://legislation.gov.uk Statute Law Database].

Unlike England and Wales, information is not limited to being supplied in the form of certified copies; original register pages (or filmed images) can be viewed in person at local register offices or at the General Register Office in Edinburgh, online (fees apply) on the [http://scotlandspeople.gov.uk Scotlands People] website or in microfilms (1855-1875, 1881, 1891) available at family history centres operated by [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].

===United Kingdom's Crown dependencies and British Overseas Territories===
These jurisdictions do not form part of the United Kingdom and each has its own registration system. Their older records tend to follow the layout used in England and Wales.

==Stillbirths==

===England and Wales===
[[Stillbirth]]s (beyond 24 weeks gestation) have been registered since 1927 in a register that is closed from public access. A single stillbirth registration takes the place of both birth and death registration for the stillborn infant. Prior to 1960 such certificates gave no cause of death.

Stillbirth certificates can only be ordered by the mother or father of the deceased contacting the General Register Office by phone or letter. In the event of the parents both having died, an adult sibling can order the certificate if they can provide the dates of death for both parents.

===Scotland===
Registration of still-births commenced in 1939. The registers are not open to public view and extracts are only issued "in exceptional circumstances".&lt;ref&gt;General Register Office Leaflet S1 (April 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
A 2007 article in ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine revealed that in the case of a stillbirth it is not standard practice to issue both a [[birth certificate]] and a death certificate. Most states instead issue a "certificate of birth resulting in stillbirth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.missingangelsbill.org|title=Welcome to MISSing Angels Bill|author=|date=|website=www.missingangelsbill.org|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethnicity==
{{US Demographics|state=North Carolina}}
As of the 2015 vintage year of the U.S. Census series starting in 2010, the U.S. Census estimated that the racial distribution of North Carolina's population was 71.2% [[White American]],  22.1% [[African American]], 1.6% [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]], 2.8% Asian, and 9.1% [[Hispanic]] or Latino (of any race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/table/PST045215/37|title=U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts: North Carolina|author=|date=|website=Census Bureau QuickFacts}}&lt;/ref&gt; North Carolina has historically been a [[rural]] state, with most of the population living on farms or in small towns. However, over the last 30 years the state has undergone rapid [[urbanization]], and today most of North Carolina's residents live in [[urban area|urban]] and [[suburban]] areas, as is the case in most of the United States. In particular, the cities of [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]] and [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]] have become major urban centers, with large, diverse, mainly affluent and rapidly growing populations. Most of this growth in [[Multiculturalism|diversity]] has been fueled by [[immigrants]] from [[Latin America]], India, and [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Contemporary Migration in North Carolina |url=http://www.ncmuseumofhistory.org/collateral/articles/S95.Contemp.Migration.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028193452/http://www.ncmuseumofhistory.org/collateral/articles/S95.Contemp.Migration.pdf |archivedate=2008-10-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, large numbers of people from the [[Northeastern United States]], [[Florida]] and [[California]] have moved to the state in recent years. North Carolina was one of the country's fastest growing states in the 1980s and 1990s. The growth rate subsided in the first decade of the 21st century due to changed economic conditions, but it continued to attract new residents.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} &lt;!-- This statement is contrary to the above reference that the state has seen 12% growth since year 2000 --&gt;

[[African American]]s make up nearly a quarter of North Carolina's population. The number of middle-class blacks has increased since the 1970s. African Americans are concentrated in the state's eastern Coastal Plain and in parts of the Piedmont Plateau, where they had historically worked and where the most new job opportunities are. African-American communities number by the hundreds in rural counties in the south-central and northeast, and in predominantly black neighborhoods in the cities: Charlotte, Raleigh, Durham, Greensboro, Fayetteville, Wilmington and Winston-Salem.

Until the mid-1820s, North Carolina had more small farms and fewer plantations than adjacent South Carolina and Virginia. These "[[yeoman farmer|yeoman]]" farmers were non-slave-holding (or owning few slaves), private land owners of tracts of approximately 500 acres (2&amp;nbsp;km²) or less. Relatively few blacks live in the state's mountains and rural areas of the western Piedmont. In some mountain counties, the black population has historically numbered in the few dozens at most.

Free African Americans migrated in the colonial and post-Revolutionary period to frontier areas of North Carolina from Virginia. Detailed family histories of 80% of those counted as "all other free persons" in the 1790-1810 federal census show they were descendants of African Americans free in Virginia during the colonial period. As boundaries were then more permeable, most free African families descended from unions between white women, free or servant, and African men, free, servant or slave. Indians who adopted English customs became part of free African American communities and married into the families. Some of the lighter-skinned descendants formed their own distinct communities, often identifying themselves as Indian or Portuguese to escape effects of the color line.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freeafricanamericans.com/ Paul Heinegg, ''Free African Americans of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The state has a rapidly growing proportion of [[Asian American]]s, specifically [[Indian American|Indian]] and [[Vietnamese American|Vietnamese]]; these groups nearly quintupled and tripled, respectively, between 1990 and 2002, as people arrived in the state for new jobs in the growing economy. Recent estimates suggest that the state's Asian-American population has increased significantly since 2000. Indian Americans are one of the most highly educated groups in the US.

North Carolina has the largest population of [http://sites.google.com/site/mdagreensboronc/culture-and-history Montagnards], perhaps 10,000, living in the US. These refugees originate from the Central Highlands of Vietnam. The first group arrived in 1986 as former fighters allied with US Special Forces during the Vietnam War. Today, most of the population lives in Charlotte, Raleigh and especially, Greensboro. Until the 2010 Census, their number has never been accurately identified or counted.

Events during the 1980s in Laos spurred [[Hmong people|Hmong]] immigration to North Carolina, as refugees fled wars and communist rule. They now number 12,000 in the state.&lt;ref&gt;See a report on immigration by The Center for New North Carolinians of the [[University of North Carolina, Greensboro]], entitled [http://cnnc.uncg.edu/immigrants/groups.htm Ethnic Groups in North Carolina] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725040832/http://cnnc.uncg.edu/immigrants/groups.htm |date=2008-07-25 }}. Retrieved July 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; A small Hmong farming colony can be found near [[Marion, North Carolina|Marion]].

The earliest record of Asian immigration to North Carolina goes back to the mid-19th century when the first [[Chinese people|Chinese]] were hired as miners and agricultural workers. The famous Thai "Siamese" twins - [[Eng and Chang Bunker]] - conjoined together at their chests, settled in [[Mt Airy, North Carolina]] in 1839. Smaller numbers of [[Japanese American|Japanese]], [[Filipino American|Filipinos]], and [[Koreans]] arrived to work as farmers, but many also worked in the Atlantic fishing industries in the early and mid-20th century.

Settled first, the coastal region attracted primarily English immigrants of the early migrations, including indentured servants transported to the colonies and descendants of English who migrated from Virginia. In addition, there were waves of Protestant European immigration, including the [[British people|British]], [[Irish people|Irish]], [[French people|French]] [[Huguenot]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usgennet.org/usa/topic/colonial/book/chap4_3.html North Carolina-Colonization-The Southern Colonies&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014072811/http://www.usgennet.org/usa/topic/colonial/book/chap4_3.html |date=2008-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Swiss German]]s who settled [[New Bern, North Carolina|New Bern]]. A concentration of [[Welsh people|Welsh]] (usually included with others from [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]]) settled east of present [[Fayetteville, North Carolina|Fayetteville]] in the 18th century. For a long time the wealthier, educated planters of the coastal region dominated state government.

North Carolinians of [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]], [[Scottish American|Scottish]] and [[English American|English]] ancestry are spread across the state. Historically Scots&amp;ndash;Irish and Northern English settled mostly in the Piedmont and backcountry. They were the last and most numerous of the immigrant groups from the Britain and Ireland before the Revolution, and settled throughout the Appalachian South, where they could continue their own culture.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Hackett Fischer]], ''[[Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America]]'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1989, pp.632-639&lt;/ref&gt; They were fiercely independent and mostly yeoman farmers.

In the [[Winston-Salem, NC|Winston-Salem]] area, there is a substantial population of ethnic [[German American|German]] ancestry (from the modern area of the [[Czech Republic]]), descended from immigration of members of the [[Protestant]] [[Moravian Church]] during the mid-18th century. The Moravians of Winston-Salem are not primarily of [[Czech people|Czech]] ancestry, but mostly of German descent, and members of the [[Moravian Church in America]], a Protestant denomination takes its name from a spiritual movement that began in 15th century [[Moravia]] and nearby [[Bohemia]]. North Carolina is home to more than 10,000 [[Bosnian Americans]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.governor.nc.gov/newsroom/proclamation/20140711/bosnia-and-herzegovina-tribute-day Bosnia and Herzegovina Tribute Day] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108144509/http://www.governor.nc.gov/newsroom/proclamation/20140711/bosnia-and-herzegovina-tribute-day |date=2014-11-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Greeks]] have been around since the early 20th century with 7 Greek Orthodox churches in NC. {{citation needed|date=November 2012}} During the early 20th century, a small group of Orthodox immigrants from [[Ukraine]] settled in [[Pender County, NC|Pender County]].&lt;ref&gt;Amanda Greene, "Small Group Fights to Save Historic Orthodox Church," ''Greensboro News and Record'', 17 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

There is somewhat of a long history of [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] settlement along the state's Atlantic coast whose families were fishermen originated from the [[Azores]] islands and the country of [[Portugal]], and there are over 50,000 residents of Portuguese descent. {{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Also the North Carolina coast attracted [[Basque people|Basque]] fishermen from their homeland in Northern [[Spain]] and southwest [[France]]. {{citation needed|date=November 2012}} The seasonal residents known as "[[snowbirds]]" the majority are [[Canada|Canadians]] either English and [[French-Canadian|French]] speaking live in coastal sections and beach towns every winter.

Since 1990 the state has seen an increase in the number of [[Hispanics in the United States|Hispanics]]/Latinos. Once chiefly employed as migrant labor, Hispanic residents of the 1990s and early 21st century have been attracted to low-skilled jobs that are the first step on the economic ladder. As a result, growing numbers of Hispanic immigrants are settling in the state, majority of which is from [[Mexico]], but also from [[Puerto Rico]], and to a lesser degree from other [[Spanish Caribbean|Caribbean]] and [[Central America]]n countries. There are also significant amounts of Hispanics moving to North Carolina from other states, such as Puerto Ricans from the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]]. In Hispanic neighborhoods such as [[Eastland, Charlotte, North Carolina|Eastland]] in Charlotte, [[Mexican American]]s have become the ethnic majority. Newly formed ''[[barrio]]s'' in the [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]] area continue a transplanted Latin American culture. In 2005, the [[Pew Hispanic Center]] estimated that 300,000 — roughly 65 percent of North Carolina's Latino population — are [[illegal immigration|undocumented immigrants]], based on the Census Bureau's population estimates.&lt;ref name=critical&gt;{{cite web|title=Immigration Hits 'Critical Mass' in NC|url=http://www.carolinajournal.com/exclusives/display_exclusive.html?id=2983|publisher=Carolina Journal|last=Martinez|first=Rick|date=2005-12-12|accessdate=2007-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population has grown from 77,726 in 1990 to 517,617 in 2005, an average increase of 13.5% per year.&lt;ref name=critical/&gt;

North Carolina has the highest American Indian population in the East Coast. The estimated population figures for [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] in North Carolina (as of 2004) is 110,198. To date, North Carolina recognizes eight Native American tribal nations within its state borders:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doa.state.nc.us/cia/tribesorg.htm|title=Tribes and Organizations |publisher=North Carolina Department of Administration|accessdate=2008-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The [[Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians]] were federally recognized in 1868 and received state recognition in 1889. The Eastern Cherokee live in eastern [[Swain County]], as well as [[Graham County, North Carolina|Graham]] and [[Jackson County, North Carolina|Jackson]] counties, and have roughly 13,400 enrolled members, most of whom live on a reservation properly called the [[Qualla Boundary]]. The Reservation is slightly more than 56,000 acres (230&amp;nbsp;km²), and is held in trust by the federal government specifically for the [[Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians]].
*The [[Lumbee]] tribe, the largest in the state with 54,000 members, was recognized by the state in 1885. In 1956, Congress recognized the Lumbee but denied them benefits received by other federally recognized tribes. Since the 1980s, the Lumbee have been seeking full federal recognition. The Lumbee are concentrated chiefly in the southeastern portions of the state in Robeson, Scotland, Hoke and Cumberland counties.
*The [[Haliwa-Saponi]] Tribe of Native Americans received state recognition in 1965. The tribe comprises a little more than 3,800 enrolled members who reside in northeastern North Carolina's [[Halifax County, North Carolina|Halifax]] and [[Warren County, North Carolina|Warren]] counties.
*The [[Waccamaw Siouan]] Indian Tribe received state recognition in 1971. The almost 2,000 members are located in the mid-Atlantic North Carolina counties of [[Bladen County, North Carolina|Bladen]], and [[Columbus County, North Carolina|Columbus]].
*The [[Coharie]] Tribe first received state recognition in 1911. North Carolina rescinded recognition in 1913 but formally recognized the tribe in 1971. The population of 1,781 enrolled members is located in [[Sampson County, North Carolina|Sampson]] and [[Harnett County, North Carolina|Harnett]] counties.
*The [[Saponi|Sappony]] received state recognition in 1911 as the Indians of [[Person County]]. In 2003 they officially received state permission to change their name to the Sappony Tribe. They have 850 enrolled members.
*The [[Occaneechi Band of the Saponi Nation]] received state recognition in 2002. They have a population of 800 members who reside in [[Orange County, North Carolina|Orange]] and [[Alamance County, North Carolina|Alamance]] counties.
*The [[Meherrin]] are a tribe of [[Iroquois|Iroquoian]]-descent located primarily in rural northeastern [[Hertford County, North Carolina|Hertford]], [[Bertie County, North Carolina|Bertie]], and [[Gates County, North Carolina|Gates]] counties, with a population of 557 enrolled members.
Furthermore, though they are not state-recognized, Robeson County has a significant number of descendants of the [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]], who are currently attempting to gain state recognition.

==Religion==
North Carolina, like other [[Southern United States|Southern]] states, has traditionally been overwhelmingly [[Protestant]]. By the late 19th century, the largest Protestant denomination was the [[Southern Baptists]]. However, the rapid influx of [[Northern United States|northerners]] and immigrants from Latin America is steadily increasing the number of [[Roman Catholics]] and [[Judaism|Jews]] in the state. The Baptists remain the single largest church in the state, however.

The growing diversity of religious groups in North Carolina is most visible in the state's larger urban areas, such as Charlotte and Raleigh-Durham. It is in these cities and suburbs that most of the state's new immigrants and residents have settled. However, in many rural counties the Southern Baptists remain the dominant Christian church. The second-largest Protestant church in North Carolina are the [[Methodists]], who are strong in the northern Piedmont, and especially in populous [[Guilford County]]. There are also substantial numbers of [[Quakers]] in [[Guilford County]], and northeastern North Carolina.

The [[Presbyterians]], historically Scots-Irish, have had a strong presence in [[Charlotte]], the state's largest city, and in [[Scotland County, North Carolina|Scotland County]].

[[Jews]] began arriving in [[North Carolina]] in the early to mid-19th century. Primarily [[German Jews]], these early merchants established centers in the coastal cities of [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]] and [[New Bern]].  It was not until the late 19th to early 20th century, however, that [[Eastern European]] [[Jews]] began to arrive in large numbers to Piedmont cities such as [[Charlotte]] and [[Greensboro]].  Today, most Jewish communities in [[North Carolina]] are centered around large Piedmont cities such as [[Charlotte]], [[Raleigh]], [[Greensboro]], and [[Winston-Salem]].  In recent years, [[Western North Carolina]] has also seen an influx of [[Jews]], who have relocated to places such as [[Asheville]] and [[Boone, North Carolina|Boone]] from [[Florida]] and the Northeast.  It is estimated there are approximately 30,000 [[Jewish]] residents in [[North Carolina]], which constitute around 0.3% of the state's population.

[[File:Chief Justice John Marshall.jpeg|thumb|Chief Justice John Marshall]]
The '''Discovery doctrine''' is a concept of [[public international law]] expounded by the [[United States Supreme Court]] in a series of decisions, most notably ''[[Johnson v. M'Intosh]]'' in 1823.  Chief Justice [[John Marshall]] explained and applied the way that [[colonialism|colonial powers]] laid claim to lands belonging to foreign sovereign nations during the [[Age of Discovery]].  Under it, [[title (property)|title]] to lands lay with the government whose subjects travelled to and occupied a territory whose inhabitants were not subjects of a European Christian monarch. The doctrine has been primarily used to support decisions invalidating or ignoring [[Indigenous peoples|aboriginal]] possession of land in favor of colonial or post-colonial governments.

The 1823 case was the result of [[collusive lawsuit]]s where land speculators worked together to make claims to achieve a desired result.&lt;ref&gt;''How the Indians Lost Their Land: Law and Power on the Frontier'' Stuart Banner, 2005, pg 171-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Dark Side of Efficiency: Johnson v. M'Intosh and the Expropriation of American Indian Lands'', Eric Kades, 148 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1065 2000, pg 148&lt;/ref&gt; John Marshall explained the Court's reasoning. The decision has been the subject of a number of law review articles and has come under increased scrutiny by modern legal theorists.

== History ==
The Doctrine of Discovery was promulgated by European monarchies in order to legitimize the colonization of lands outside of Europe. Between the mid-fifteenth century and the mid-twentieth century, this idea allowed European entities to seize lands inhabited by indigenous peoples under the guise of discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nation to Nation: Treaties Between the United States &amp; American Indians|last=Harjo|first=Susan Shown|publisher=[[National Museum of the American Indian]]|year=2014|isbn=9781588344786|location=Washington, DC|pages=15-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1494, the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] declared that only non-Christian lands could be colonized under the Discovery Doctrine.

In 1792, U.S. Secretary of State [[Thomas Jefferson]] declared that the Doctrine of the Discovery would extend from Europe to the infant U.S. government. The Doctrine and its legacy continue to influence [[American imperialism]] and treatment of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = An Indigenous Peoples' History of the United States|last = Dunbar-Ortiz|first = Roxanne|publisher = Beacon Press|year = 2014|isbn =|location = Boston|pages = 197–201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Johnson v. M'Intosh''==
{{main article|Johnson v. M'Intosh}}
The plaintiff Johnson had inherited land, originally purchased from the Piankeshaw tribes. Defendant McIntosh claimed the same land, having purchased it under a grant from the United States. It appears that in 1775 members of the Piankeshaw tribe sold certain land in the Indiana Territory to Lord Dunmore, royal governor of Virginia and others. In 1805 the Piankeshaw conveyed much of the same land to [[William Henry Harrison]], governor of the Indiana Territory, thus giving rise to conflicting claims of title.&lt;ref name=Watson&gt;[http://law.shu.edu/Students/academics/journals/law-review/Issues/archives/upload/watson.pdf Watson, Blake A., "John Marshall and Indian Land Rights: A Historical Rejoinder to the Claim of “Universal Recognition” of the Doctrine of Discovery", ''Seton Hall Law Review'', Vol.36, 481]&lt;/ref&gt; In reviewing whether the courts of the United States should recognize land titles obtained from Native Americans prior to American independence, the court decided that they should not. Chief Justice John Marshall had large real estate holdings that would have been affected if the case were decided in favor of Johnson.  Rather than remove himself from the case, however, the chief justice wrote the decision for a unanimous US Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Report on Impact on Indigenous Peoples of the International Legal construct known as the Doctrine of Discovery |[https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/E%20C.19%202010%2013.DOC] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312093507/https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/E%20C.19%202010%2013.DOC |date=March 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decision==
Marshall found that ownership of land comes into existence by virtue of discovery of that land, a rule that had been observed by all European countries with settlements in the New World. Legally, the United States was the true owner of the land because it inherited that ownership from Britain, the original discoverer.

Marshall noted:
&lt;blockquote&gt;On the discovery of this immense continent, the great nations of Europe ... as they were all in pursuit of nearly the same object, it was necessary, in order to avoid conflicting settlements, and consequent war with each other, to establish a principle which all should acknowledge as the law by which the right of acquisition, which they all asserted, should be regulated as between themselves. This principle was that discovery gave title to the government by whose subjects, or by whose authority, it was made, against all other European governments, which title might be consummated by possession. ... The history of America, from its discovery to the present day, proves, we think, the universal recognition of these principles.&lt;ref name=Marshall&gt;[http://www.historytools.org/sources/Johnson-v-MIntosh.pdf Marshall, John. "Johnson v. M'Intosh", 21 U.S. 543, 5 L.Ed. 681, 8 Wheat. 543 (1823)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
{{PropertyLaw}}
Chief Justice Marshall noted the 1455 papal bull [[Romanus Pontifex]] approved [[Portugal]]'s claims to lands discovered along the coast of [[West Africa]], and the 1493 [[Inter Caetera]] had ratified [[Spain]]'s right to conquer newly found lands, after [[Christopher Columbus]] had already begun doing so,&lt;ref name=Newcomb&gt;{{cite journal | last = Newcomb | first = Steve |date=Fall 1992 | title = Five Hundred Years of Injustice | journal = Shaman's Drum | pages = 18–20 | url = http://ili.nativeweb.org/sdrm_art.html | accessdate = 2007-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; but stated:
"Spain did not rest her title solely on the grant of the Pope. Her discussions respecting boundary, with France, with Great Britain, and with the United States, all show that she placed it on the rights given by discovery. Portugal sustained her claim to the {{not a typo|Brazils}} by the same title."&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt;

==United States law==
Marshall pointed to the exploration charters given to [[John Cabot]] as proof that the British had operated under the doctrine.&lt;ref name=Newcomb/&gt;  The tribes which occupied the land were, at the moment of discovery, no longer completely [[sovereignty|sovereign]] and had no [[property]] rights but rather merely held a right of [[occupancy]].  Further, only the discovering nation or its successor could take possession of the land from the natives by conquest or purchase.

The doctrine was cited in other cases as well.  With ''[[Cherokee Nation v. Georgia]]'', it supported the concept that tribes were not independent states but "domestic dependent nations".&lt;ref name=Newcomb/&gt;  The decisions in ''[[Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe]]'' and ''[[Duro v. Reina]]'' used the doctrine to prohibit tribes from criminally prosecuting first non-Indians, then Indians who were not a member of the prosecuting tribe.&lt;ref name=Robertson&gt;{{cite web | url = http://thorpe.ou.edu/guide/robertson.html | title = Native Americans and the Law: Native Americans Under Current United States Law | accessdate = 2007-01-10 | last = Robertson | first = Lindsay G. |date=June 2001 | work = Native American Constitution and Law Digitization Project | publisher = The University of Oklahoma Law Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrine has been cited by the US Supreme Court as recently as 2005, in City of Sherrill, NY v. Oneida Nation: "Under the 'doctrine of discovery...' fee title (ownership) to the lands occupied by Indians when the colonists arrived became vested in the sovereign-first the discovering European nation and later the original states and the United States."

== History ==
The Doctrine of Discovery was promulgated by European monarchies in order to legitimize the colonization of lands outside of Europe. Between the mid-fifteenth century and the mid-twentieth century, this idea allowed European entities to seize lands inhabited by indigenous peoples under the guise of discovery. In 1494, the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] declared that only non-Christian lands could be colonized under the Discovery Doctrine.

In 1792, U.S. Secretary of State [[Thomas Jefferson]] declared that the Doctrine of the Discovery would extend from Europe to the infant U.S. government. The Doctrine and its legacy continue to influence [[American imperialism]] and treatment of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Legal critique ==
As the Piankeshaw were not party to the litigation, "no Indian voices were heard in a case which had, and continues to have, profound effects on Indian property rights."&lt;ref&gt;Dussias, Allison M., "Squaw Drudges, Farm Wives, and the Dann Sisters' Last Stand: American Indian Women’s Resistance to Domestication and the Denial of Their Property Rights", 77 N.C. L. REV. 637, 645 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Blake A. Watson of the University of Dayton School of Law finds Marshall's claim of "universal recognition" of the "doctrine of discovery" historically inaccurate.

In reviewing the history of European exploration Marshall did not take note of Spanish Dominican philosopher [[Francisco de Vitoria]]'s 1532 ''De Indis'' nor ''De Jure belli Hispanorum in barbaros''. Vitoria adopted from [[Thomas Aquinas]] the Roman law concept of ''ius gentium'', and concluded that the Indians were rightful owners of their property and that their chiefs validly exercised jurisdiction over their tribes, a position held previously by Palacios Rubios. His defense of American Indians was based on a scholastic understanding of the intrinsic dignity of man, a dignity he found being violated by Spain's policies in the New World.&lt;ref&gt;Pagden, Anthony. ''Vitoria: Political Writings'', Cambridge University Press, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

Marshall also overlooked more recent American experience, specifically [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]]'s purchase of the [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Providence Plantation]]. In order to forestall Massachusetts and Plymouth designs on the land, Williams subsequently traveled to England to obtain a patent which referenced the purchase from the natives. The Royal Charter of Rhode Island issued by [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] acknowledged the rights of the Indians to the land.&lt;ref name=Watson/&gt;

Nor does Justice Marshall seem to have taken note of the policy of the Dutch West India Company which only conferred ownership rights in [[New Netherland]] after the grantee had acquired title by purchase from the Indian owners, a practice also followed by the Quakers in Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name=Watson/&gt;

Watson and others, such as Robert Williams Jr. suggest that Marshall misinterpreted the "discovery doctrine" as giving exclusive right to lands discovered, rather than the exclusive right to treaty with the inhabitants thereof.&lt;ref name=Watson/&gt;

== Contemporary advocacy efforts ==
Discovery doctrine has been severely condemned as socially unjust, racist, and in violation of basic and fundamental human rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://undesadspd.org/IndigenousPeoples/NewsandMedia/tabid/1615/news/259/Default.aspx Concluding session, Permanent Forum says impact of racist ‘Doctrine of Discovery’]&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues]] noted Discovery doctrine "as the foundation of the violation of their (Indigenous people) human rights".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/E.C.19.2010.13%20EN.pdf|title=Preliminary study of the impact on indigenous peoples of the international legal construct known as the Doctrine of Discovery|publisher=[[United Nations Economic and Social Council]]|accessdate=4 January 2014|date=4 Feb 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]]  Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues called for a mechanism to investigate historical land claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2012/hr5088.doc.htm|title=Doctrine of Discovery|work=HR/5088|publisher=[[United Nations Economic and Social Council]]|accessdate=21 November 2013|date=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[General Convention of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America|General Convention]] of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] conducted on 8–17 August 2009, the bishops of the church adopted a resolution officially repudiating the discovery doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Schjonberg, Mary Frances.  [http://library.episcopalchurch.org/article/general-convention-renounces-doctrine-discovery "General Convention renounces Doctrine of Discovery"], ''Episcopal Life Online,'' 27 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2012 [[Unitarian Universalist Association]] General Assembly in Phoenix, AZ, delegates of the Unitarian Universalist Association passed a resolution repudiating the Doctrine of Discovery and calling on Unitarian Universalists to study the Doctrine and eliminate its presence from the current-day policies, programs, theologies, and structures of Unitarian Universalism.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uua.org/multiculturalism/dod&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, at its 29th [[General Synods of the United Church of Christ|General Synod]], the [[United Church of Christ]] followed suit in repudiating the doctrine in a near-unanimous vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucc.org/news/GS2013-Doctrine-of-discovery-repudiated.html  General Synod delegates overwhelmingly approve resolution repudiating the Doctrine of Discovery]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2016 Synod, 10-17 June in Grand Rapids, MI, delegates to the annual  general assembly of the [[Christian Reformed Church in North America|Christian Reformed Church]] rejected the Doctrine of Discovery as heresy in response to a study report on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thebanner.org/news/2016/06/synod-2016-rejects-doctrine-of-discovery-as-heresy|title=Synod 2016 Rejects Doctrine of Discovery as Heresy|access-date=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2016, on November 3, a group of 500 clergy members publicly denounced the Doctrine of Discovery at the Standing Rock pipeline protests.{{fact|date=January 2017}}

As a definite geographic location within the [[United States]], "Dixie" is usually defined as the eleven [[Southern United States|Southern states]] that [[Secession in the United States#Confederate States of America|seceded]] in late 1860 and early 1861 to form the new [[Confederate States of America]].  They are (in order of [[secession]]): [[South Carolina]], [[Mississippi]], [[Florida]], [[Alabama]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Louisiana]], [[Texas]], [[Virginia]], [[Arkansas]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Tennessee]].  [[Maryland]] never seceded from the Union, but many of their citizens favored the Confederacy.

Although [[Maryland]] is not included in Dixie today, Maryland is on the Dixie side of the [[Mason–Dixon line]]; if the origin of the term Dixie is accepted as referring to the region south (and west) of that line, Maryland was in Dixie in 1760. It can also be argued that [[Maryland]] was, in 1860, part of Dixie, especially culturally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msa.maryland.gov/msa/stagser/s1259/121/7590/html/0000.html|title=The General Assembly Moves to Frederick, 1861|accessdate=25 Oct 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In this sense, it would remain so into the 1970s, when an influx of people from the Northeast made the state and its culture significantly less Southern (especially Baltimore and the suburbs of Washington DC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Are we Northern?

However, the location and boundaries of "Dixie" have, over time, become increasingly subjective and mercurial. Today, it is most often associated with those parts of the Southern United States where traditions and legacies of the Confederate era and the [[Plantation era|antebellum]] [[Old South|South]] live most strongly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title="Where Does the South Begin?"|magazine=The Atlantic|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2011/01/where-does-the-south-begin/70052/|date=28 Jan 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of "Dixie" as the location of a certain set of cultural assumptions, mind-sets and traditions (along with those of other regions in North America) was explored in the 1981 book ''[[The Nine Nations of North America]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.garreau.com/main.cfm13.htm|title=Dixie|author=Joel Garreau|accessdate=November 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of self-identification and appeal the popularity of the word “Dixie” seems to be declining. A 1976 study revealed that on some 350,000 sq. miles “Dixie” reached 25% popularity of “American” in names of commercial business entities.&lt;ref&gt; the territory in question was all Mississipi and Alabama, almost all of Georgia, Tennessee and South Carolina, and around a half of Louisiana, Arkansas, Kentucky, North Carolina and Florida. The study in question was John Shelton Reed, "The Heart of Dixie: An Essay in Folk Geography", [in:] "Social Forces" 54/4 (1976), pp. 925-939&lt;/ref&gt; Though a 1999 analysis provided confusing evidence,&lt;ref&gt;the research demonstrated that between 1976 and 1999 in some 19% of US cities sampled there was an increase of relative use of “Dixie”, in 48% of cities sampled there was a decline and there was no change recorded in 32% of cities, Derek H.

== Origin of the name ==
[[File:DixBankNote.jpg|thumb|290px|right|Ten dollar note from ''Banque des citoyens de la Louisiane'', 1860]]
According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', the origin of this nickname remains obscure. The most common theories according to ''A Dictionary of Americanisms on Historical Principles'' (1951) by Mitford M. Mathews:

# "Dixie" is derived from [[Jeremiah Dixon]], a surveyor of the Mason–Dixon line, which defined the border between Maryland and Pennsylvania, separating free and slave states subsequent to the [[Missouri Compromise]].&lt;ref&gt;John Mackenzie, "[http://www1.udel.edu/johnmack/mason_dixon/ A brief history of the Mason-Dixon Line]", APEC/CANR, University of Delaware; accessed 2017.01.05.&lt;/ref&gt;
# The word "Dixie" refers to currency issued first by the [[Citizens State Bank (New Orleans, Louisiana)|Citizens State Bank]] in the French Quarter of New Orleans and then by other banks in [[Louisiana]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://louisdl.louislibraries.org/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/LWP&amp;CISOPTR=1384&amp;CISOSHOW=1382 ''"Dixie" Originated From Name "Dix" An Old Currency'' - New Orleans American May 29 1916, Vol. 2 No. 150, Page 3 Col. 1] Louisiana Works Progress Administration (WPA), Louisiana Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; These banks issued ten-dollar notes&lt;ref&gt;[http://louisdl.louislibraries.org/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/GFM&amp;CISOPTR=1005 Ten Dollar Note] George Francois Mugnier Collection, Louisiana Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; labeled ''Dix'' on the reverse side, French for "ten". The notes were known as "Dixies" by southerners, and the area around [[New Orleans]] and the French-speaking parts of Louisiana came to be known as "Dixieland".&lt;ref name="britannica" /&gt; Eventually, usage of the term broadened to refer to the Southern states in general.
# The word preserves the name of a Mr. Johan Dixie (sometimes spelled Dixy), a slave owner on [[Manhattan]] Island where slavery was legal until 1827. An apocryphal tale claims that following their posting to the South, the slaves who formerly worked "Dixie's Land" told of the relatively less harsh treatment they faced while in the North.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilton |first=David|title=Word Myths: Debunking Linguistic Urban Legends |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2008 |page=147 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=QQovEeLHVl0C&amp;pg=PA147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Drunken Bakers''' is a strip cartoon in the British adult humour magazine ''[[Viz (comic)|Viz]]'' created by Barney Farmer and Lee Healey. It depicts the alcohol-dominated lives of two forlorn bakers who attempt to run a small bakery. The strip was adapted into a video-art installation piece by the artist [[Mark Leckey]] in 2006.

The strip has been compared to the work of [[Samuel Beckett]]. Its nihilistic aspects have impressed critics. [[Roberta Smith]], in ''[[The New York Times]]'' said "The aesthetic compression of Mr Farmer's dialogue and Mr Healey's line...convey an oppressive sense of the drinker's irresistible drive for oblivion."&lt;ref name="NYT" &gt;{{cite web|last=Smith |first=Roberta |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/10/arts/art-in-review-mark-leckey.html |title=Art in Review - Mark Leckey - Review - NYTimes.com |work=The New York Times|date=10 March 2006 |accessdate=17 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Premise==
The two [[baker]]s run (or at least attempt to run) a bakery together. Their names have never been mentioned; one has sparse black hair, the other has a bulbous nose and large phiz of fair (possibly blond) hair. They are drawn as - and have the personalities of - a pair of classic clown archetypes, an odd couple: the curly haired but balding one being short and aggressive, the taller being doleful. In one episode, they were drawn as wearing suits that were for the curly-haired one much too small, and for the taller one much too big - another classic clown type. According to Roberta Smith, the characters are "two middle-aged [[Dagwood Bumstead|Bumstead]]-like alcoholics haplessly lurching from one disaster and one drink to the next as they attempt to run a bakery."&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

Both bakers suffer from severe [[alcoholism]], and every strip shows them drinking strong [[alcoholic beverage]]s such as various [[liqueur]]s. Their idea of a Wednesday half-closing is to sit on a public seat in front of a local off-licence, enjoying the 'view'. The black-haired one has an estranged daughter as his wife left him on Christmas Eve.  Occasionally the curly haired one will remind him of this, usually due to the black haired one offending the curly haired one. They try their best to bake something every night, but because of their inebriation, the results are always hopeless. As critic Steve Lowe says,

{{quote|Before long, they're both staggering round a smoke-filled bakery surrounded by empty spirits bottles. Again. It's tricky to say what's so appealing about their slide from being worthy citizens to utterly wrecked lost souls. Writer Barney Farmer and artist Lee Healey imbue the strips with a real sense of despondency; these aren't drunks who have convivial escapades or adventures - they are drunks who drink, get drunk, pass out and burn the cakes. And being bakers somehow makes it worse: it seems such a wholesome occupation.&lt;ref name = "con"/&gt;}}

If they even manage to bake something, it is often inedible, sometimes even toxic. For instance in one episode they baked cakes made with [[Kerosene|paraffin]] instead of milk&lt;ref name = "art"/&gt; - "This milk is blue and it tastes funny". The only exception to this is the 25&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; anniversary of the opening of the bakery, when the black-haired one decides to bake twin cakes in the form of the number 25. He succeeds, producing the number 25 in cake form, while his partner drinks [[mulled wine]] made in the kettle, which has held something nasty. In the final frame the inevitable happens - the fellow vomits up his stomach contents all over the anniversary cakes, and so their only success is utterly ruined.

Customers sometimes arrive at the baker's shop, asking for various breads or pastries, at Christmas, a whole lot of Christmas cakes, and once even a five-tiered wedding cake. The bakers promise they'll bake it for them, but always fail to fulfil their promise. Recent strips have featured one of the protagonists being hospitalised with [[renal failure]] while the other drinks [[rum]] at his bedside. Their shop, which is almost perpetually empty of produce, especially the front window, has been vandalised many times, and has burnt down several times, generally due to them leaving the oven on and falling into a drunken stupor.

The strip is [[fatalism|fatalistic]]; the bakers will never reform, their customers will never get proper service, and nobody is doing a thing about it. Nevertheless, they carry on. As art critic [[Emily Mears]] remarks, "somehow, with the remarkable fortitude of true career drunks and in a rather sweet depiction of brotherly love, they prop each other up and return, strip after strip, to bake again."&lt;ref name = "art"&gt;Mears, Emily Speers, "Mark Leckey: Portikus Im Leinwandhaus", ''Artforum International'', Volume: 44., Issue: 8, April 2006, p.259.&lt;/ref&gt; Some storylines fail to resolve themselves and end indeterminately, reinforcing the character's cyclical and depressing existence. In one strip, one of the bakers is bitten by a stray dog he has befriended, but he doesn't notice. "Your mouth is pissing blood" remarks the other baker.

Whereas most of the comics in ''Viz'' have traditional hand-lettered captions and dialogue, the Drunken Bakers strip instalments (and other, less regular strips by Farmer &amp; Healey) have typeset speech balloons. This gives Farmer &amp; Healey's work a significantly different appearance from other ''Viz'' material.

==Leckey exhibition==
In 2006 The Drunken Bakers were the subject of an exhibition by [[Mark Leckey]] at the [[Tate Britain]].&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; Leckey created a film using frames from the original strips to construct a narrative and added a soundtrack spoken by himself and his colleague Steve Claydon in [[Scouse|Liverpudlian accents]].&lt;ref name = "art"/&gt; According to Emily Mears,

{{quote|By fading the screen to black between episodes, Leckey constructs an elliptical narrative that mirrors the sense of time lost by the drinkers and the viewer. The video plays in a white box with a white carpet; a clock projected onto the outside of the box tells a stuck time, the hour hand slipping back to three each time it manages to reach four.&lt;ref name = "art"/&gt;}}

In Roberta Smith's words, Leckey constructs "dreamy, druggy, disjointed variants on music videos...He has ingeniously filmed the comic strip with close-ups and jump-cuts, creating a kind of stop-action animation, and added a skillfully explicit soundtrack replete with convincing belches, slurps, breaking glass and vomiting."&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; Smith says that Leckey's artwork is less an original work than an "adaptation or an homage" of the original cartoon.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

Lecky also created models of the bakers, exhibited as ''Drunken Bakers Dozen'' in 2007.

==Critical acclaim==
The strip and the Tate Britain exhibition have received wide critical acclaim from both the art and literary worlds. [[Alan Moore]] has said, "I think the Drunken Bakers is like Samuel fucking Beckett or something. It's horrible and really funny." Steve Lowe in ''[[The Guardian]]'' says that "Comedy drunks have been around since drinks first began, but few have been so utterly forlorn as the Drunken Bakers."&lt;ref name = "con"&gt;{{cite web|author=Steve Lowe |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2003/sep/17/features11.g21 |title=Why I love... the Drunken Bakers &amp;#124; From |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2013-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher Howse compares it to the animated sketch show ''[[Monkey Dust]]'', describing "another episode of 'Drunken Bakers', in which one alcoholic baker succumbs to internal bleeding to the complete indifference of his drinking companion. It's brilliant."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/3605873/Appalling-hilarity.html |title=Appalling hilarity |publisher=Telegraph |date=2003-11-04 |accessdate=2013-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edward Lye'''  (1694–1767) was an 18th-century scholar of [[Old English]] and [[Germanic philology]].

His ''Dictionarium Saxonico et Gothico-Latinum'', published posthumously in 1772, was a milestone in the development of Old English lexicography, surpassed only by, and substantially contributing to [[Joseph Bosworth]]'s ''Dictionary of the Anglo-Saxon language'' of 1838.

==Life==
He was born at [[Totnes]], [[Devon]], the son of Thomas Lye, vicar of [[Broadhempston]] and a schoolmaster at Totnes, by his wife Catherine (née Johnson). He was educated at his father's school and at [[Crewkerne]] school, [[Somerset]]. 
He went to [[Hart Hall, Oxford]], where he entered 28 March 1713, and graduated B.A. 19 October 1716, M.A. 6 July 1722. He was ordained in 1717, and in 1721 was admitted vicar of [[Houghton Parva]], [[Northamptonshire]].{{sfn|Wroth|1893}}

On 4 January 1750,he was elected [[Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries]]. He resigned Houghton Parva about 1750, on being presented by [[James Compton, 5th Earl of Northampton]] to the rectory of [[Yardley Hastings]]. He at this time was supporting his mother and his two sisters. Lye died, aged 73, on 19 August 1767 of [[gout]], from which he had long suffered, at Yardley Hastings, where he was buried. His library was sold in 1773.{{sfn|Wroth|1893}}

==Works==
He began the study of Anglo-Saxon and related languages. In 1743 he published, with additions, the ''Etymologicum Anglicanum'' of [[Franciscus Junius (the younger)|Francis Junius]] from manuscripts in the [[Bodleian Library]]. To this work he prefixed an Anglo-Saxon grammar.{{sfn|Wroth|1893}}

In 1750, he edited the [[Gothic language|Gothic]] version of the gospels,&lt;ref name="Lye2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Lye|title=The Correspondence of Edward Lye|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cGEwk2BX6AUC&amp;pg=PA39|date=1 January 2004|publisher=Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies|isbn=978-0-88844-906-1|pages=39–}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sacrorum Evangeliorum Versio Gothica'' (Oxford) with a Latin translation, notes, and a Gothic grammar.  About 1737 Lye began to work on an Anglo-Saxon and Gothic dictionary, which he despaired of publishing; in 1765 he was encouraged by a subscription from Archbishop [[Thomas Secker]], and other subscriptions. About thirty sheets were printed just before Lye's death, and the work was posthumously published in 1772 with additions by his friend [[Owen Manning]] as ''Dictionarium Saxonico et Gothico-Latinum'' (London). The title pages goes on to say "Accedunt fragmenta Versionis Ulphilanæ, necnon Opuscula quædam Anglo-Saxonica."{{sfn|Wroth|1893}}

'''''GURPS Ice Age''''' is a sourcebook for the [[GURPS]] [[role-playing game]].

==Contents==
''GURPS Ice Age'' is a supplement of ''[[GURPS]]'' rules for adventure in the [[Stone Age]] and before. Character rules for various hominid races include [[Homo Habilis]], [[Homo Erectus]], [[Neanderthal]], and [[Cro-Magnon]] peoples, with new skills, and a section on Shamanism and Magic. The book provides campaign setting data and animal descriptions for [[Pleistocene]] Europe and [[Pliocene]] Africa, with dinosaurs as well. The book also includes campaign-suggestions and sample scenarios.&lt;ref name="HW"/&gt;

''GURPS Ice Age'' gives players information on early man, rules for using these characters in a ''GURPS'' game, shamanistic magic and spells, and details on how to set up a prehistoric campaign. The included adventure is suitable for play over 2-3 sessions.&lt;ref name="Dragon #148"/&gt;

''GURPS Ice Age'' includes rules and setting material for games that are set in the time of prehistoric man. ''Ice Age'' also introduced a system of rules for shamanic magic.

==Publication history==
''GURPS Ice Age: Roleplaying in the Prehistoric World'' was written by [[Kirk Wilson Tate]], with a cover by [[Guy Burchak]] and illustrations by [[Donna Barr]], and was first published by [[Steve Jackson Games]] in 1989 as a 64-page book.&lt;ref name="HW"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schick |first=Lawrence|authorlink=Lawrence Schick|title=Heroic Worlds: A History and Guide to Role-Playing Games|publisher=Prometheus Books |year=1991|isbn=0-87975-653-5 |page=391}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the material was slightly reworked and republished in ''[[GURPS Dinosaurs]]'', although the interior art by comics artist [[Donna Barr]] was not. An introductory adventure, "Wolf Pack on Bear River", was also excluded from ''GURPS Dinosaurs''. ''GURPS Ice Age'' is a long since out of print edition. A PDF edition is available from Steve Jackson Games.

==Reception==
[[Jim Bambra]] reviewed ''GURPS Ice Age'' for ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' magazine #148 (August 1989).&lt;ref name="Dragon #148"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Bambra| first = Jim| authorlink = Jim Bambra| title = Role-playing Reviews| journal = [[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]| issue = #148| page = 65| publisher = [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]]| location = [[Lake Geneva, Wisconsin]]|date=August 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bambra comments: "A game centered around cavemen and woolly mammoths? The ''GURPS Ice Age'' game takes this unusual subject and does a first-class job of turning it into a credible and detailed setting, including lots of background information and a gaming environment that makes a distinct change from other settings." He notes that the included adventure "does an admirable job of capturing the flavor of life at that time. The ''GURPS Ice Age'' game is also a handy sourcebook for GMs running timetravel or lost-worlds adventures."&lt;ref name="Dragon #148"/&gt;

[[Lawrence Schick]] commented that the dinosaurs are "thrown in for those who don't care too much about scientific accuracy".&lt;ref name="HW"/&gt;

{{lead too short|date=May 2014}}
This is a [[comparative religion]] article which outlines the similarities and interactions between [[Hermeticism]] (or [[Hermeticism|Hermetism]]) and other  religions or philosophies.

== Christianity ==
[[File:Seven governors.jpg|left|175px|thumb|A work by [[Jakob Böhme]] illustrating a Christian take on Hermetic astrology, 1682]]
Christianity and Hermetism have interacted in such a way that controversy surrounds the nature of the influence.  Some, such as [[Richard August Reitzenstein]] believed that Hermetism had heavily influenced Christianity; while others, such as [[Marie-Joseph LaGrange]], believed that Christianity heavily influenced Hermetism; most see the exchange as more mutual.&lt;ref name="Lyman"&gt;(Lyman p. 265)&lt;/ref&gt;   Both religions hold [[redemption (religious)|redemption]], [[revelation]] and focus on the knowledge of God as the meaning of [[World population|humanity]]'s existence.  This knowledge of God comes upon a mystical experience dependent upon rebirth, the focal point of arguments for influence from one of these religions upon the other.&lt;ref name="Lyman_a"&gt;(Lyman p. 268)&lt;/ref&gt;  The focus of this rebirth are the words "Life," "Light," and "Truth" as well as a moral attitude of the seeker in his attainment of higher knowledge.  Both also share a [[dualistic cosmology|dualistic philosophy]] which comes from a shared philosophical background in popular schools of [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic]] thought.&lt;ref name="Lyman_b"&gt;(Lyman p. 269)&lt;/ref&gt;  Early Christianity and Hermetism both are [[esotericism|esoteric]] without having an excessive emphasis on secrecy, relying upon inward experience, assisted by instruction and ultimately the result of revelation by God.&lt;ref&gt;(Lyman p. 271)&lt;/ref&gt;  Former president of the [[American Academy of Religion]], Catherine L Albanese, has theorized that Hermetic thought has had a profound influence in [[Mormonism]], [[Unitarianism]], [[Universalism]], and the [[Shakers]].&lt;ref name="Neuhaus"&gt;(Neuhaus)&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Prisci Theologi and the Hermetic Reformation in the Fifteenth Century'', Lutheran Bishop James Heiser evaluated the writings of [[Marsilio Ficino]] and [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola]] as contributions to a “Hermetic Reformation."&lt;ref&gt;Heiser, James D., Prisci Theologi and the Hermetic Reformation in the Fifteenth Century, Repristination Press, 2011. {{ISBN|978-1-4610-9382-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Fourth Gospel ===
The ''[[Fourth Gospel]]'', or ''Gospel of John'', is purported to have similarities with the ''[[Corpus Hermeticum]]'' in religious thought and religious questing.&lt;ref name="Lyman" /&gt;  There are also, however, deep differences as well.&lt;ref&gt;(Lyman p. 266)&lt;/ref&gt;

Both texts utilize the concept of [[Logos]]&lt;ref&gt;(Lyman p. 270)&lt;/ref&gt; and emphasize that the followers of their respective religions are apart from the rest of the world, suitable for only a few followers.&lt;ref&gt;(Lyman pp. 270-71)&lt;/ref&gt;  Each of the two texts stress the importance of redemption, revelation, and rebirth to find knowledge of God&lt;ref name="Lyman_a" /&gt; and contain striking similarity in the wording of how moral attitudes promote higher knowledge in general.&lt;ref name="Lyman_b" /&gt;  Opposed to the basis of the contemporary [[mystery cult]]s, both texts relayed that the core of religious practice should be done internally through the personal experience of the believer rather than externally through [[sacrament]]al ritual.&lt;ref name="Lyman_c"&gt;(Lyman p. 272)&lt;/ref&gt; Dualism plays a strong part in each of the two works.&lt;ref name="Lyman_b" /&gt;

Mary Lyman also points out four distinct contrasts between the two works despite their similarities. First, that the ''Fourth Gospel'' is a homogeneous work while the ''Corpus Hermeticum'' is a work which is found in fragments which she suspects were written by many authors over a wide range of time.&lt;ref name="Lyman_c" /&gt;  Second, cosmic speculation is paramount to the Hermetic work while the fourth Gospel focuses on issues of religion.&lt;ref&gt;(Lyman pp. 273-74)&lt;/ref&gt;  Third, the Hermetic text focuses on the [[asceticism]] of the day while the Fourth Gospel ignores it completely.&lt;ref&gt;(Lyman pp. 274-75)&lt;/ref&gt;  Fourth, the Gospel's figures are all unique and grounds itself in the life of [[Jesus of Nazareth]] while the Hermetic text uses an "elusive literary tradition" which does little to identify or separate its characters.&lt;ref&gt;(Lyman p. 275)&lt;/ref&gt;  Though she relays that a scholar named Angus believed that the two would be more similar if they had the same proportion of Hermetic writings as Christian writings.&lt;ref&gt;(Lyman p. 273)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rosicrucian Concept of the Tree of Pansophia.jpg|left|175 px|thumb|A 17th century depiction of the [[Rosicrucian]] concept of the Tree of [[Pansophia]].]]

=== Mormonism ===
A theory by [[John L. Brooke]], an author and professor at [[Tufts University]], suggests that [[Mormonism]] has its roots in Hermetism and Hermeticism after following a philosophical trail from Renaissance [[Europe]].  The early Mormons, most notably [[Joseph Smith]], were linked with magic, [[alchemy]], [[Freemasonry]], [[divination|divining]] and "other elements of radical religion" prior to Mormonism.  Brooke attests correlations with the view that spirit and matter are one and the same, the covenant of [[celestial marriage]], and the ability of humanity to become deified or ultimately perfect.&lt;ref name="Barlow"&gt;(Barlow)&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, Brooke argues that Mormonism can only be understood in conjunction with the occult and the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]-era sectarian idea of [[Restorationism (Christian primitivism)|restoration]].  He sees ties to Hermeticism in Mormon support for [[Pelagianism]], [[communitarianism]], [[polygamy]] and [[Dispensationalism]].  He does however digress that there was a change since the 1860s in the [[LDS Church]] which has widely removed Hermetic influence.&lt;ref name="Barlow" /&gt;  Catherine L Albanese picked up on Brooke's work and further claims that Smith's heavenly realm is derived from [[Emanuel Swedenborg]]'s Divine Man and Hermeticism in general, linking it in with several [[United States|American]] Christian movements which move Christianity in odd directions.&lt;ref name="Neuhaus" /&gt;

However, scholars at the LDS-owned [[Brigham Young University]] have denounced Brooke's work and even scolded the publisher, [[Cambridge University Press]], for printing it{{verification needed|date=March 2015}}.  Philip I Barlow criticizes the work as carelessly seeking out relations to Hermeticism which Brooke knows better than Mormonism, and believes that Brooke's links to Hermeticism can be explained away with "a particular and selectively literal reading of the Bible."&lt;ref name="Barlow" /&gt;  Albanese was criticised by Richard J Neuhaus as having denied Christianity the [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] in order to minimize its influence and that she is avoiding [[theology]] by calling her book a [[cultural history]].  Albanese believes that the metaphysical denial in scholarly research is due to its strong [[feminism|feminist]] qualities.  Neuhaus believes American Christianity is more Gnostic in nature than Hermetic.&lt;ref name="Neuhaus" /&gt;

=== Miscellaneous ===
Albanese portends that several Christian denominations were affected by Hermeticism.  The Shakers had been influenced in their belief of a dual God, being both male and female: Heavenly Father and Holy Mother Wisdom.  She claims that Universalism was a clear mix of Christianity and Hermeticism where they come together, much like Rosicrucianism.&lt;ref name="Neuhaus" /&gt;

== Gnosticism ==
Hermeticism is closely related to [[Gnosticism]].&lt;ref name="Hoeller"&gt;Stephan A. Hoeller, [http://www.gnosis.org/hermes.htm ''On the Trail of the Winged God. Hermes and Hermeticism Throughout the Ages'']&lt;/ref&gt; Both flourished in the same period in [[Alexandria]], in the same spiritual climate,&lt;ref name="Hoeller" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Van den Broek "Gnosticism and Hermetism in Antiquity" from Gnosis and Hermeticism: from Antiquity to Modern Times p. 17)&lt;/ref&gt; sharing the goal of the soul escaping from the material realm through true understanding, and emphasizing personal knowledge of God.&lt;ref name="Hoeller" /&gt; Both were part of the third pillar of Western culture; representing the balance between [[Greek culture|Greek]] [[rationality]] and [[Bible|biblical faith]] along with the [[Cathar]]s.&lt;ref&gt;(Van den Broek and Hanegraaff p. vii)&lt;/ref&gt;  Both groups saw the fundamental relationship between God and man was found through [[gnosis]] in a goal to "see" God and in some instances become one with God.&lt;ref&gt;(Van den Broek "Gnosticism and Hermetism in Antiquity" from Gnosis and Hermeticism: from Antiquity to Modern Times p. 1)&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian Gnostics, however, felt that there was something seriously wrong with ''[[The All#Nous|Nous]]'', a part of The All;&lt;ref&gt;(Horgan p. 41)&lt;/ref&gt; to them, it seemed that the concept could be stretched so far as to say that by bringing the world into existence, God had to remove himself from it at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;(Horgan pp. 39-40)&lt;/ref&gt;  They also differed on the basis of [[theology]], [[cosmology]], and [[anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;(Van den Broek "Gnosticism and Hermetism in Antiquity" from ''Gnosis and Hermeticism: from Antiquity to Modern Times'', p. 6)&lt;/ref&gt;  Though both agreed in God's transcendence over the Universe, Hermetists believed that God could still be comprehended through philosophical reasoning, in agreement with philosophers and Christian theologians, but Gnostics felt God was completely unknowable.&lt;ref&gt;(Van den Broek "Gnosticism and Hermetism in Antiquity" from Gnosis and Hermeticism: from Antiquity to Modern Times p. 7)&lt;/ref&gt;  While the Gnostics indulged in [[mythology|mythological]] references often, Hermetic texts are generally void of mythology,&lt;ref&gt;(Van den Broek "Gnosticism and Hermetism in Antiquity" from Gnosis and Hermeticism: from Antiquity to Modern Times p. 8)&lt;/ref&gt; with ''[[Poimandres]]'' as an exception.&lt;ref&gt;(Van den Broek "Gnosticism and Hermetism in Antiquity" from Gnosis and Hermeticism: from Antiquity to Modern Times pp. 12-13)&lt;/ref&gt;  Hermetism is optimistic about God, while many forms of Christian Gnosticism are pessimistic about [[demiurge|the creator]] (a different being from [[monad (Gnosticism)|their conception of God]]):&lt;ref name="Hoeller" /&gt; Several Christian Gnostic sects saw the [[Cosmos]] were the product of an evil creator and thus evil itself, while Hermetists saw the Cosmos as a beautiful creation in the image of God.&lt;ref&gt;(Van den Broek "Gnosticism and Hermetism in Antiquity" from Gnosis and Hermeticism: from Antiquity to Modern Times pp. 9-10)&lt;/ref&gt;  Both view that mankind was originally divine and has become entrapped in the material world, a slave to passion and distracted from divine nature.  However, the Gnostics often held a pessimistic view of mankind as a result while the Hermetic belief is generally positive towards mankind just the same.&lt;ref&gt;(Van den Broek "Gnosticism and Hermetism in Antiquity" from Gnosis and Hermeticism: from Antiquity to Modern Times pp. 11-12)&lt;/ref&gt;  Rather, Hermetists believed that the human body was not bad in itself, but materialistic impulses such as [[Sexual attraction|sexual desire]] were the cause of ''evil'' in the world.&lt;ref&gt;(Van den Broek "Gnosticism and Hermetism in Antiquity" from Gnosis and Hermeticism: from Antiquity to Modern Times pp. 16-17)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Islam ==
In 830 CE, a group of Hermetic pagans in [[Harran]] needed protection by being either Muslim, Christian, Jewish, or [[Sabians|Sabian]].  They took the [[Corpus Hermeticum]] as their scripture and [[Hermes Trismegistus]] as their prophet, and decided to call themselves Sabians.  As no one was sure what the [[Qur'an]] meant by Sabian, they were accepted as being such having a [[monotheism|monotheistic]] [[scripture]] and a [[prophet]].  This group played a large role in Baghdad's intellectual life from 856-1050.&lt;ref&gt;(Churton pp. 26-27)&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous of the Harranian Sabians was [[Thabit ibn Qurra]], who made great advances in [[alchemy]], [[astronomy]], and [[mathematics]], citing his paganism as the reason for his ability.&lt;ref&gt;(Churton pp. 27-28)&lt;/ref&gt; The author Antoine Faivre theorizes that Hermes Trismegistus is mentioned in the Qu'ran as well, under the name of [[Idris (prophet)|Idris]].  ([http://www.submission.info/servlet/qtbrowse?pickthall=true&amp;yusufali=true&amp;shakir=true&amp;arabic=true&amp;chapter=19&amp;verseBegin=56&amp;verseEnd=56 19:56], [http://www.submission.info/servlet/qtbrowse?pickthall=true&amp;yusufali=true&amp;shakir=true&amp;arabic=true&amp;chapter=19&amp;verseBegin=57&amp;verseEnd=57 19:57]) Idris is also identified with Enoch,&lt;ref name="Faivre"&gt;(Faivre 1995 pp.19-20)&lt;/ref&gt; who is also identified with Hermes.&lt;ref&gt;(Hall The Secret Teachings of All Ages p. 94)&lt;/ref&gt;  He is called "Thrice Wise," relating to Hermes' title "Thrice Great."&lt;ref name="Faivre" /&gt;

[[Khalid ibn Yazid]] was an [[Umayyad]] prince, who took an interest in alchemy early in Islamic history. The works of [[Jabir ibn Hayyan]] would be heavily influenced by Hermetic philosophy, as would [[Ismailism|Ismaili]] beliefs and theology.

== Judaism ==
The relationship between [[Judaism]] and Hermetism has been one of mutual influence and a subject of controversy within the Jewish religion.&lt;ref name="Lelli"&gt;(Lelli)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Middle Ages ===

[[File:Complex qaballah.jpg|left|175px|thumb|A complex array of Qaballah [[Sephiroth (Kabbalah)|Sephiroth]] by [[Christian Knorr von Rosenroth]], 1684]]

This identification paved the way for the exchange and melding of ideas between Judaism and Hermetism during the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name="Lelli" /&gt;  The most prominent interrelation between the two systems is in the development of [[Kabbalah]] which developed into three separate brands: a [[Jewish Kabbalah|Jewish]] stream, a [[Christian Kabbalah|Christian]] stream (''[[Kabbalah|Cabala]]'' in Christianity), and a [[Hermetic Kabbalah|Hermetic]] stream (''[[Qabalah]]'' in Hermeticism).&lt;ref name="Leslie"&gt;(Leslie)&lt;/ref&gt;  Medieval Hermetism, aside from [[alchemy]], is often seen as analogous to and was heavily influenced by these Kabbalistic ideas.&lt;ref name="Leslie" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Regardie p. 15)&lt;/ref&gt;

Hermetism and Kabbalah arose together in the 12th and 13th centuries.  The [[Practical Kabbalah]] also relied upon magic and astrology but focused more on the Hebrew language in its incantations than the general language of Hermetism in general.&lt;ref&gt;(Wieczynski p. 22)&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondly, Jewish scholars of the Middle Ages attempted to make use of treatises on [[astrology]], [[medicine]] and [[theurgy]] as a justification for practicing natural magic forbidden by a number of commandments in the [[Torah]] and reinforced by prophetic books codified by [[rabbi]]nic authorities.  They noted the wonders performed by celebrated biblical figures such as the [[Patriarchs (Bible)|patriarchs]] and King Solomon and which were seen as a God-given and condoned use of natural magic.  They attributed these arts to divine knowledge imparted by Jewish heroes to [[gentiles]] such as the [[India]]ns, [[Babylon]]ians, [[Egypt]]ians, and [[Greece|Greeks]], and felt that by approaching [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] from a religious standpoint would legitimize their use of the sciences.  In particular, they believed the Hermetic teachings to have its origins in ancient Jewish sources.&lt;ref name="Lelli" /&gt;

These Jewish scholars, particularly the ones who distrusted [[Term logic|Aristotelian rationality]], looked to Hermetism as a backing to discuss theological interpretation of the [[Torah]] and the [[ten commandments]].  Fabrizo Lelli writes: "As for Christians and Muslims, so likewise for Jews, Hermetism was an alternative to Aristotelianism--the likeliest prospect, in fact, for integrating an alien system into their religion.  This was because the response of the [[Hermetica]] to intellectual problems was generally [[Theosophy (disambiguation)|theosophical]]."&lt;ref name="Lelli" /&gt;

In the use of these Hermetic treatises, these Jewish scholars, though at times inadvertently, introduced Hermetic ideas into Jewish thought.  [[Shabbetay Donnolo]]'s 10th century commentary on the ''[[Sefer Yezirah]]'' shows Hermetic influence, as well as the 13th century texts later compiled into the ''[[Sefer ha-Zohar]]'', and in the contemporary Kabbalistic works of [[Abraham Abulafia]] as well as of other Jewish thinkers influenced by Kabbalah&lt;ref name="Lelli" /&gt; such as [[Isaac Abravanel]] who used Hermetic Qabalah to affirm the superiority of Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;(Skalli)&lt;/ref&gt;  Lelli suggests that it was natural for these Jewish Kabbalists to elevate Hermetic teachings to a major role in Jewish thought in a time when they began to produce their own "antirationalist--exegesis of scripture."  This was despite the fact that many Hermetic works were ascribed to [[Aristotle]] in the time through [[pseudepigrapha]]; these scholars saw that as a justification to give the same elevated authority to the medical, astronomical, and magical Hermetic texts.&lt;ref name="Lelli" /&gt;

However, most Medieval Jewish scholars aware of the Hermetic tradition did not mention Hermetism explicitly, but rather referred to them through Hermetic ideas that were borrowed from Islam or brought Hermeticism up only to reject it.  While scholars such as [[Moses ibn Ezra]], [[Bahya ibn Paquda]], [[Judah ha-Levi]], and [[Abraham ibn Ezra]] specifically brought up Hermeticism to integrate into their philosophies, others such as [[Moses ben Maimon]] (Maimonides) specifically rejected anything Hermetic as being responsible for counterparadigmic views of God.  Maimonides warned his readers against what he viewed as the degenerative effect of Hermetic ideas, particularly those of the Sabians, and was effective in persuading many Jewish thinkers away from Hermetic integration, known as Hebrew Hermetism.&lt;ref name="Lelli" /&gt;

Scholars, such as Abraham ibn Ezra, felt justified in invoking the authority of Hermes to offer esoteric explanations of Jewish ritual.  This culminated in a wide use of Hermetic texts for the use of theurgy and [[Amulet|talisman]] construction.  The Jewish version of the theurgic practice of drawing divine spirits down to Earth was horadat haruhaniyut, "the lowering of spirituality."  Books such as the ''[[Sefer Mafteah Shlomoh]]'', ''[[Sefer Meleket Muskelet]]'', ''[[Sefer ha-Tamar]]'' and ''[[Sefer Hermes]]''.  The Hermetic texts most valued by Jewish scholars were those which dealt with astrology, medicine, and astral magic; however shunned by Maimonides as dangerous and destructive.&lt;ref name="Lelli" /&gt;

=== Renaissance ===
[[File:Rabbi Abraham Eleazar.jpg|right|175px|thumb|Rabbi Abraham Eleazar demonstrating the alchemical process of distillation through symbolism, 1760]]
Despite Maimonides' denunciation of Hermetism, Jewish scholars in the Renaissance struggled to reconcile his beliefs with those of the proponents of Hermetic thought within Judaism.  Renaissance scholars argued that the rationalism of Maimonides drew upon the [[prisca sapienta]] that had both Mosaic and Hermetic origins and that Abraham ibn Ezra's Commentary on the Pentateuch was evidence that they shared the same views on the relationship between [[religion]] and [[science]].&lt;ref name="Lelli" /&gt;

However, scholars such as [[Averroist Elijah del Medigo]] carried on Maimonides' crusade.  Medigo claimed that the theurgic practices of Hermetism were against the teachings of the Torah.  Others, such as [[Yohanan Alemanno]], claimed that the Hermetic teachings were part of a primordial wisdom of the ancients and put the writings of Hermes as being equal to those of King Solomon.  Hermetism was also prominent in the works of [[David Messer Leon]], [[Isaac Abravanel]], [[Judah Abravanel]], [[Elijah Hayyim]], [[Abraham Farissol]], [[Judah Moscato]] and [[Abraham Yagel]].&lt;ref name="Lelli" /&gt;

The works of [[Baruch Spinoza]] have also been ascribed a Hermetic element&lt;ref&gt;(Weststeijn)&lt;/ref&gt; and Hermetic influenced thinkers such as [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] have accepted Spinoza's version of God.&lt;ref&gt;(Lange)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ancient philosophy ==
Hermetism had a strong philosophical influence,&lt;ref&gt;(Van den Broek "Gnosticism and Hermetism in Antiquity" from ''Gnosis and Hermeticism: from Antiquity to Modern Times'' p. 1)&lt;/ref&gt; especially from [[Stoicism]] and [[Platonism]].&lt;ref&gt;(Van den Broek "Gnosticism and Hermetism in Antiquity" from ''Gnosis and Hermeticism: from Antiquity to Modern Times'' p. 5)&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Occult ==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2008}}
Much of the Western Esoteric tradition is based on a blend of Hermeticism and the ''[[Kabbalah Ma'asit]]'', so called magical or [[practical Kabbalah]]. Occultism uses the Hermetic and Kabbalistic theory of creation and angelic/demonic forces, as a basis for ritual magic, and theurgy. Most magic theory involves the manipulation of [[Yetzirah]], the world of Formation, and letting the effect trickle down to the physical universe (in accordance to the Hermetic concept of "as above, so below"). This includes the communication and manipulation of inhabitants of Yetzirah, angelic or demonic forces. The spelling of "Qabalah", is generally referred to as the [[Hermetic Qabalah]], often having a magical or occult slant. While "Kabbalah" refers to the traditional [[Jewish Kabbalah|Jewish branch]].

These beliefs were influential in [[Europe]]an occult lore, especially from the Renaissance forward.  During the Middle Ages and Renaissance, magicians wrote grimoires which show a major influence from both Hermeticism and Kabbalah and have since become a basis for most practical occultism. In more recent times, magical orders such as The Golden Dawn have revived and revised these traditions.

== Transcendentalism ==
Catherine L Albanese theorized that [[Transcendentalism]] has Hermetic influence.  Among Transcendentalist thinkers, she especially points to [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] who has ideas of humankind transcending into deification similar to those of Joseph Smith.  She also points to the [[spiritual narcissism]] of [[Henry David Thoreau]].&lt;ref name="Neuhaus" /&gt;

== Neopaganism ==
[[Neopaganism]] is directly related to Hermeticism. The [[Renaissance]] Hermetists [[Plethon]] and [[Ficino]] are the foundation of the [[Western Mystery Tradition]] from which contemporary Neopaganism arose. [[Wicca]], one of the earliest and most famous of the Neopagan religions, honours a Goddess and a God, who are seen by some as being aspects of a single greater deity. See [[Wiccan views of divinity]]. [[Silver Ravenwolf]] expresses this in terms of the [[Hermetic Qabalah|Qabalistic]] [[Tree of Life (Kabbalah)|Tree of Life]]:

:"Down we go then, to the first two branches of the tree, right below the All. Each branch is exactly the same, one on the right side of the tree and one on the left.  Totally balanced in every respect to each other.  They represent the [[Horned God|God]] and the [[Goddess#Wicca and Neopaganism|Goddess]], or the Lord and the Lady.  Separate yet equal, together they combine into the essence of the All."&lt;ref&gt;(Ravenwolf p. 44)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ravenwolf holds that the God and Goddess are merely the masculine and feminine aspects of The All, and that both in turn express themselves through sub-aspects as the gods and goddesses of the various pantheons,&lt;ref&gt;(Ravenwolf p. 45)&lt;/ref&gt; just as in Hermeticism archangels, angels, and demons are all seen as embodying aspects of God.

The Hermetic use of signs, herbs, stones and animal imagery as a means for drawing down the planetary powers into such signs&lt;ref&gt;(Yates ''Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition'' p. 45)&lt;/ref&gt; is mirrored in the [[sympathetic magic]] practices of Neopagan [[witchcraft]].

Amongst pagan [[white supremacist]] groups, the [[Odinist]] [[White Order of Thule]] integrates Hermetic philosophy into its indoctrination process.&lt;ref&gt;(Vysotsky)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Zoroastrianism ==
[[Zoroastrianism]] plays a large role in influencing Hermeticism.  In 525 BCE, Egypt was conquered by the [[Persian Empire]], bringing Zoroastrian ideas along with it.&lt;ref&gt;(Abel &amp; Hare p. 8)&lt;/ref&gt;  In obscure texts, Hermes claims to look to [[Zoroaster]] as a spiritual father, having learned much of the [[zodiac]] from him.  It is further said that Zoroaster had penetrated the mystery of the zodiac more than any other.&lt;ref&gt;(Powell pp. 15-16)&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternatively, it has been suggested that Zoroaster (like so many others) and Hermes are one and the same.&lt;ref&gt;(Hall ''The Secret Teachings of All Ages'' p. 516)&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it is possible that this was from a faked Zoroastrian text.  Theurgy is often called Zoroastrian Magic as well.&lt;ref&gt;(Garstin pp. 9-10)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Herzian cone.jpg|thumb|A small hole broken through a window pane.]]

A '''Hertzian cone''' is the cone produced when an object passes through a solid, such as a bullet through glass. More technically, it is a cone of force that propagates through a brittle, amorphous or [[cryptocrystal]]line solid material from a point of impact. This force eventually removes a full or partial cone in the material.&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/dissertations/AAI1510251/ "Purdue University - Study on Hertzian cone crack"]&lt;/ref&gt; This is the physical principle that explains the form and characteristics of the [[lithic flake|flakes]] removed from a [[lithic core|core]] of [[tool stone]] during the process of [[lithic reduction]].

This phenomenon is named after the [[Germany|German]] physicist [[Heinrich Rudolf Hertz]], who first described this type of wave-front propagation through various media.

Although it might not be agreed by all, natural phenomena which have been grouped with the Hertzian cone phenomena include the crescentic "chatter marks" made on smoothed bedrock by glacial ice dragging along boulders at its base, the numerous crescentic impact marks sometimes seen on pebbles and cobbles, and the shatter cones found at bolide impact sites.  James Byous, working independently (at privately funded Dowd Research, Savannah, Georgia USA) has made a protracted study of Hertzian cones.  Some of his work may be found via sharing points&lt;ref&gt;[https://dowdresearch.academia.edu/JamesByous James Byous]&lt;/ref&gt; or directly at Dowd Research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dowdresearch.org/ dowdresearch.org]&lt;/ref&gt;  He has produced a comprehensive glossary on Hertzian fractures and related terms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dowdresearch.org/Hertzian-Glossary.html Hertzian Fractures and Related Terms - A Glossary by James Byous]&lt;/ref&gt; A Hertzian cone is often 104 degrees when created by an indenter.  Smaller cones may be produced due to lack of size of the material, or irregularities in the structure of the material.  However, in ballistics the faster the projectile the steeper the edges and angle of the cone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miyamoto|first=et.al.|year=2000|title=The Morphology of Hertzian Cone in Plate Glass by Projectile Impact,|url=https://www.academia.edu/4311244/The_Physicalities_of_Hertzian_Fractures|journal=TheSociety of Materials Science, Japan|volume= 49| issue = 8|pages=867|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2691">'''Implied powers''', in the [[United States]], are powers authorized by the Constitution that, while not stated, seem implied by powers that are expressly stated. When [[George Washington]] asked [[Alexander Hamilton]] to defend the constitutionality of the [[First Bank of the United States]] against the protests&lt;ref&gt; they implied powers into the united states.......[http://courses.pasleybrothers.com/texts/Jefferson_on_BUS.htm Against the Constitutionality of the Bank of the United States], Thomas Jefferson.&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[James Madison]], and Attorney General [[Edmund Randolph]], Hamilton produced what has now become the classic statement for implied powers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/bank-ah.asp For the Constitutionality of the Bank of the United States], Alexander Hamilton.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hamilton argued that the sovereign duties of a government implied the right to use means adequate to its ends.  Although the United States government was sovereign only as to certain objects, it was impossible to define all the means it should use, because it was impossible for the founders to anticipate all future exigencies.  Hamilton noted that the "[[Taxing and Spending Clause|general welfare clause]]" and the "[[Necessary_and_Proper_Clause|necessary and proper clause]]" gave elasticity to the Constitution. Hamilton won the argument with Washington, who signed the bank bill into law.

Later, directly borrowing from Hamilton, Chief Justice [[John Marshall]] invoked the implied powers of government in the [[United States Supreme Court]] case, ''[[McCulloch v. Maryland]]''. In 1816, the [[United States Congress]] passed legislation creating the [[Second Bank of the United States]].  The state of Maryland attempted to tax the bank.  The state argued the [[United States Constitution]] did not explicitly grant Congress the power to establish banks.  In 1819, the Court decided against the state of Maryland. Chief Justice Marshall argued that Congress had the right to establish the bank, as the Constitution grants to Congress certain implied powers beyond those explicitly stated.

In the case of the United States Government, implied powers are powers Congress exercises that the Constitution does not explicitly define, but are necessary and proper to execute the powers.

==Notes==
Implied powers are those that can reasonably be assumed to flow from express powers, though not explicitly mentioned. The legitimacy of these powers is derived from the [[Taxing and Spending Clause]], the [[Necessary and Proper Clause]], and the [[Commerce Clause]].

'''Joyce Carol Oates''' (born June 16, 1938) is an American writer. Oates published her first book in 1962 and has since published over 40 novels, as well as a number of plays and novellas, and many volumes of short stories, poetry, and nonfiction. She has won many awards for her writing, including the [[National Book Award]],&lt;ref name=nba1970 /&gt; for her novel ''[[Them (novel)|them]]'' (1969), two [[O. Henry Awards]], and the [[National Humanities Medal]]. Her novels ''[[Black Water (novella)|Black Water]]'' (1992), ''What I Lived For'' (1994), ''[[Blonde (novel)|Blonde]]'' (2000), and short story collections, [[The Wheel of Love and Other Stories|''The Wheel of Love'']] (1970) and ''Lovely, Dark, Deep: Stories'' (2014) were each finalists for the [[Pulitzer Prize]].

Oates has taught at [[Princeton University]] since 1978 and is currently the [[Roger S. Berlind]] '52 Professor Emerita in the Humanities with the Program in Creative Writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.princeton.edu/~visarts/cwr/faculty/jcoates.html |title=The Program in Creative Writing |publisher=Princeton.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Oates was born in  [[Lockport (city), New York|Lockport, New York]], the eldest of three children of Carolina (née Bush), a homemaker of Hungarian descent,&lt;ref name="aida"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://roverarts.com/2012/04/hanging-on-every-word|title=Hanging On Every Word – Joyce Carol Oates receives the International Literary Grand Prix|publisher=Roverarts.com|date=2012-04-22|accessdate=2013-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Frederic James Oates, a [[tool and die]] designer.&lt;ref name="aida"&gt;{{cite news|author=Edemariam, Aida|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/sep/04/featuresreviews.guardianreview14|title=The new Monroe doctrine|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=September 4, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her brother, Fred Jr., was born in 1943, and her sister, Lynn Ann, who is severely [[autistic]], was born in 1956.&lt;ref name="aida"/&gt; Oates grew up in the working-class farming community of [[Millersport, New York]],&lt;ref name="ew"/&gt; and characterized hers as "a happy, close-knit and unextraordinary family for our time, place and economic status",&lt;ref name="aida"/&gt; but her childhood as "a daily scramble for existence".&lt;ref name="echo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darkecho.com/darkecho/horroronline/oates.html|title=Author Focus: Joyce Carol Oates|publisher=Darkecho.com|accessdate=2011-06-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610030614/http://www.darkecho.com/darkecho/horroronline/oates.html|archive-date=June 10, 2011|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her paternal grandmother, Blanche Woodside, lived with the family and was "very close" to Joyce.&lt;ref name="ew"&gt;{{cite news|author=Reese, Jennifer|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20044839,00.html|title=Joyce Carol Oates gets personal|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=July 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Blanche's death, Joyce learned that Blanche's father had killed himself, and Blanche had subsequently concealed her [[Jewish]] heritage; Oates eventually drew on aspects of her grandmother's life in writing the novel ''[[The Gravedigger's Daughter]]'' (2007).&lt;ref name="ew"/&gt;

Evelyn Shrifte, president of the [[Vanguard Press]], met Oates soon after Oates received her master's degree. "She was fresh out of school, and I thought she was a genius," Shrifte said. Vanguard published Oates' first book, the short-story collection ''[[By the North Gate]]'', in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Woo, Elaine|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/sep/08/news/mn-7895|title=Obituaries: Evelyn Shrifte, Longtime Head of Vanguard Press|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=September 8, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
The Vanguard Press published Oates' first novel, ''[[With Shuddering Fall]]'' (1964), when she was 26 years old. In 1966, she published "[[Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?]]", a short story dedicated to [[Bob Dylan]] and written after listening to his song "[[It's All Over Now, Baby Blue]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dedication Of Joyce Carol Oates Short Story To Dylan|url=http://www.edlis.org/twice/threads/joyce_carol_oates_dedication.html|accessdate=May 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story is loosely based on the serial killer [[Charles Schmid]], also known as "The Pied Piper of Tucson".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charles Schmid, The Pied Piper of Tucson|work=CourtTV Crime Library|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/schmid/oates_9.html|accessdate=May 22, 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210034246/http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/schmid/oates_9.html|archivedate=February 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been anthologized many times and [[film adaptation|adapted as a film]], ''[[Smooth Talk]]'' starring [[Laura Dern]] (1985).

In 2008, Oates said that of all her published work, she is most noted for "Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?".&lt;ref name="tucky"&gt;Truman, Cheryl. [http://www.kentucky.com/692/story/515390.html "Author Joyce Carol Oates is always at her finest"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001013304/http://www.kentucky.com/692/story/515390.html|date=October 1, 2009}} (reprint), ''[[Lexington Herald-Leader]]'', 2008. Retrieved on 2008-10-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Another early short story, "In a Region of Ice" (''The Atlantic Monthly'', August 1966&lt;ref name=ohenrywinners/&gt;), features a young, gifted Jewish-American student. It dramatizes his drift into protest against the world of education and the sober, established society of his parents, his depression, and eventually murder-cum-suicide. It was inspired by a real-life incident (as were several of her works) and Oates had been acquainted with the model of her protagonist. She revisited this subject in the title story of her collection ''Last Days: Stories'' (1984). "In the Region of Ice" won the first of her two [[O. Henry Award]]s.&lt;ref name=ohenrywinners/&gt;

Her second novel was ''A Garden of Earthly Delights'' (1967), first of the so-called Wonderland Quartet published by Vanguard 1967-71. All were finalists for the annual National Book Award. Her novel ''[[them (novel)|them]]'' (1969) won the 1970 [[National Book Award for Fiction]].&lt;ref name=nba1970/&gt; It is set in Detroit during a time span from the 1930s to the 1960s, most of it in black ghetto neighborhoods, and deals openly with crime, drugs, and racial/class conflicts. Again, some of the key characters and events were based on real people whom Oates had known or heard of during her years in the city. Since then she has published an average of two books a year. Frequent topics in her work include rural poverty, sexual abuse, class tensions, desire for power, female childhood and adolescence, and occasionally the supernatural. Violence is a constant in her work, even leading Oates to have written an essay in response to the question, "Why Is Your Writing So Violent?"{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

In 1990 she discussed her novel, ''[[Because It Is Bitter, and Because It Is My Heart]]'',&lt;!-- no pipe; our front cover image shows lowercase 'and' --&gt; which also deals with themes of racial tension, and described "the experience of writing [it]" as "so intense it seemed almost electric".&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, Stuart http://bombsite.com/issues/31/articles/1310, ''[[BOMB Magazine]]'' Spring 1990. Retrieved 2011-07-19.&lt;/ref&gt; She is a fan of [[poet]] and novelist [[Sylvia Plath]], describing Plath's sole novel ''[[The Bell Jar]]'' as a "near perfect work of art", but though Oates has often been compared to Plath, she disavows Plath's romanticism about suicide, and among her characters, she favors cunning, hardy survivors, both women and men.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} In the early 1980s, Oates began writing stories in the Gothic and horror genres; in her foray into these genres, Oates said she was "deeply influenced" by Kafka and felt "a writerly kinship" with [[James Joyce]].&lt;ref name="echo"/&gt;

In 1996, Oates published ''[[We Were the Mulvaneys]]'', a novel following the disintegration of an American family, which became a best-seller after being selected by [[Oprah's Book Club]] in 2001.&lt;ref name="tucky" /&gt; In the 1990s and early 2000s, Oates wrote several books, mostly suspense novels, under the [[pen names]] Rosamond Smith and Lauren Kelly.&lt;ref name="forswears"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/10/books/a-sad-joyce-carol-oates-forswears-pseudonyms.html |title=A Sad Joyce Carol Oates Forswears Pseudonyms |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=February 10, 1987 |accessdate=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For more than 25 years, Oates has been rumored to be a favorite to win the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] by oddsmakers and critics.&lt;ref name="nybooks" /&gt; Her papers, held at Syracuse University, include 17 unpublished short stories and four unpublished or unfinished novellas.

One review of Oates's 1970 story collection ''The Wheel of Love'' characterized her as an author "of considerable talent" but at that time "far from being a great writer".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/09/21/reviews/oates-wheel.html Featured Author: Joyce Carol Oates.

Oates's 2006 short story "Landfill" was criticized because it drew on the death, several months earlier, of John A. Fiocco Jr., a 19-year-old New Jersey college student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/10/books/11oates.html|title=Criticism for Joyce Carol Oates}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/15228015/ns/today-entertainment/t/joyce-carol-oates-criticized-over-story|title=Joyce Carol Oates criticized over story|accessdate=May 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oates founded ''The Ontario Review'', a literary magazine, in 1974, with [[Raymond J.

In 1980, Oates and Smith founded Ontario Review Books, an independent publishing house. In 2004, Oates described the partnership as "a marriage of like minds — both my husband and I are so interested in literature and we read the same books; he'll be reading a book and then I'll read it — we trade and we talk about our reading at meal times…".&lt;ref name="aida"/&gt;

===Teaching career===
Oates taught in [[Beaumont, Texas]], for a year, then moved to Detroit in 1962, where she began teaching at the [[University of Detroit]]. Influenced by the [[Vietnam war]], the 1967 [[12th Street riot|Detroit race riots]], and a job offer, Oates moved across [[Detroit River|the river]] into [[Canada]] in 1968 with her husband, to a teaching position at the [[University of Windsor]] in [[Windsor, Ontario|Ontario]].&lt;ref name="aida"/&gt; In 1978, she moved to [[Princeton, New Jersey]], and began teaching at [[Princeton University]].

Among others, Oates influenced [[Jonathan Safran Foer]], who took an introductory writing course with Oates in 1995 as a Princeton undergraduate.&lt;ref name="nash"&gt;Nash, Margo.

Obviously JCO has a full career behind her, if one chooses to look at it that way; many more titles and she might as well... what?...give up all hopes for a 'reputation'?

==Personal life==
[[File:Joyce Carol Oates 2013.jpg|thumb|Oates in 2013]]
Oates met [[Raymond J. Smith]], a fellow graduate student, at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, and they married in 1961.&lt;ref name="ew" /&gt; Smith became a professor of 18th-century literature and later, an editor and publisher.  Oates described the partnership as "a marriage of like minds…" and "a very collaborative and imaginative marriage."&lt;ref name="aida" /&gt;

As a diarist, Oates began keeping a detailed journal in 1973, documenting her personal and literary life; it eventually grew to "more than 4,000 single-spaced typewritten pages".&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, James. [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/07/books/review/Campbell-t.html?scp=5&amp;sq=%22joyce%20carol%20oates%22%20%22journals%22&amp;st=cse "The Oates Diaries"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 2007-10-07. Retrieved on 2008-10-30.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Oates said she had "moved away from keeping a formal journal" and instead preserves copies of her e-mails.&lt;ref name="dispatch" /&gt;

Oates's spouse Raymond Smith died of complications from [[pneumonia]] on February 18, 2008, and the death impacted Oates profoundly.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt; In April 2008, Oates wrote to an interviewer, "Since my husband's unexpected death, I really have very little energy […] My marriage—my love for my husband—seems to have come first in my life, rather than my writing. Set beside his death, the future of my writing scarcely interests me at the moment."&lt;ref name="dispatch"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Smalldon, Jeffrey | date = April 6, 2008 | title = End of Story?: Joyce Carol Oates Takes Stock as She Approaches 70 | journal = [[The Columbus Dispatch]] | format = email interview | url = http://www.columbusdispatch.com/live/content/arts/stories/2008/04/06/oates_long.html?print=yes&amp;sid=101 | archive-url = https://archive.is/20130121035809/http://www.columbusdispatch.com/live/content/arts/stories/2008/04/06/oates_long.html?print=yes&amp;sid=101 | dead-url = yes | archive-date = January 21, 2013 | access-date = 14 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Oates, Joyce Carol | date = December 13, 2010 | title = Personal History:  A Widow's Story, The Last Week of a Long Marriage | journal = [[The New Yorker]] | url = http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/12/13/a-widows-story | access-date = 14 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After six months of near suicidal grieving for Raymond Smith,{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Oates met Charles Gross, a professor in the Psychology Department and Neuroscience Institute at Princeton, at a dinner party at her home. In early 2009, Oates and Gross were married.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://crossingtheborder.wordpress.com/2009/05/04/married/ |title=Married! |publisher=Crossingtheborder.wordpress.com |date=2009-05-04 |accessdate=2011-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Oates |first=Joyce Carol |title=A Widow's Story |year=2011 |publisher=Harper Collins |location=New York |isbn=978-0-06-201553-2 |pages=414–415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 1999, Oates remained devoted to running, of which she has written, "Ideally, the runner who's a writer is running through the land- and cityscapes of her fiction, like a ghost in a real setting."&lt;ref name="running"&gt;Oates, Joyce Carol. [https://www.nytimes.com/library/books/071999oates-writing.html "Writers on Writing: To Invigorate Literary Mind, Start Moving Literary Feet"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 1999-07-18. Retrieved on 2008-10-30.&lt;/ref&gt; While running, Oates mentally envisions scenes in her novels and works out structural problems in already-written drafts; she formulated the germ of her novel ''[[You Must Remember This]]'' (1987) while running, when she "glanced up and saw the ruins of a railroad bridge", which reminded her of "a mythical upstate New York city in the right place".&lt;ref name="running" /&gt;

Oates was a member of the Board of Trustees of the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation]] from 1997 to 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gf.org/trustees/joyce-carol-oates/|title=John Simon Guggenheim Foundation {{!}}   Joyce Carol Oates|website=www.gf.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Liber Historiae Francorum''''' ({{lang-en|link=no|"The History Book of the Franks"}}) is a chronicle written anonymously during the [[8th century]]. The first sections served as a secondary source for early [[Franks]] in the time of [[Marcomer]], giving a short {{lang|la|[[Breviary|breviarum]]}} of events until the time of the late [[Merovingian]]s. The subsequent sections of the chronicle are important [[primary source|primary sources]] for the contemporaneous history. They provide an account of the [[Pippinid]] family in [[Austrasia]] before they became the most famous [[Carolingian]]s.

==Author, date, and agenda==

Richard Gerberding, a modern editor of the text, vindicates the coherence and accuracy of its account while giving reasons&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Krusch (1888) discounts the credibility of ''Liber Historiae Francorum''.&lt;/ref&gt; for locating the anonymous author in [[Soissons]], who was likely a part of the [[Abbey of St. Medard, Soissons|royal monastery of Saint-Medard]]. Richard Gerberding characterizes the author as [[Neustrian]] and as "a staunch Merovingian legitimate, secular as opposed to ecclesiastically minded, and an enthusiastic admirer and probably a member of that aristocratic class based on the [[Seine]]-[[Oise]] valley whose deeds, wars and kings he describes".{{sfn|Gerberding|1987|p=146}} 

''Liber Historiae Francorum'' is customarily dated to the year 727 because of a reference to the end of the sixth year of [[Theuderic IV]].{{sfn|Gerberding|1987}} It offers a Neustrian perspective of the era of [[mayors of the palace]], where the factions of the great territorial magnates could only be held in check and balanced by the consecrated legitimacy of the Merovingian king. ''Liber Historiae Francorum'' has been explored and interpreted by Richard Gerberding, and more recently by Rosamond McKitterick, in ''History and Memory in the Carolingian World''.{{sfn|McKitterick|2005}} As a widely read narrative, it helped create a sense of cultural solidarity among the readership for whom it was intended, whose biases it caters to, and whose political agenda it promotes.

As for that agenda, Fouracre and Gerberding show that the book supports the kings of the Merovingian dynasty only insofar as they rule with the consultation of the major nobles. The nobles, in turn, are supported only insofar as they do not aspire above their station.{{sfn|Fouracre|Gerberding|1996}}

It is one of a ''corpus'' of new books of history written in the 8th century, and copied and widely distributed in the 9th century, which offered their readers (and listeners) a pure and comprehensive background that set the Franks only distantly in the context of the Roman Empire (the Roman Empire is virtually ignored) and more immediately in the Christian [[Gallo-Roman|Gallo-Roman world]].

==Book contents==

From the outset, the book promises to present the origins and deeds of the [[List of Frankish kings|Frankish kings]] and people. It erroneously states that the Franks originated from a group of [[Troy|Trojan]] refugees, similar to the Italian refugees of the [[Aeneid]], finding themselves on the north coast of the [[Black Sea]], before making their way across the [[Danubian Plain (Bulgaria)|Danubian Plain]] to the [[Rhineland]]. To accomplish this, the book relies heavily on the Gallo-Roman bishop and historian [[Gregory of Tours]], who died in 594, whose history it epitomizes and occasionally augments&lt;ref&gt;Based on the text's additions to Gregory of Tours, Gerberding supports the reassignment of the site of Clovis' famous victory over the [[Visigoths]] from [[Vouillé, Deux-Sèvres|Vouillé]] to [[Voulon]].&lt;/ref&gt; and parallels.

The last 19 chapters, numbered 35 through 53 in Bruno Krusch's edition, present an independent account of events in the Frankish lands in the 7th and early 8th centuries.

The work begins with [[Chlothar II]]&amp;nbsp;(584–629), who started his reign as an infant King of [[Neustria]], one of the smallest territories of [[Francia]]. He was under the regency of his mother, [[Fredegund]], and in an uneasy alliance with Chlothar's uncle [[Guntram]], [[King of Burgundy]] (d.&amp;nbsp;592). Chlothar assumed full power over Neustria upon the death of his mother in&amp;nbsp;597 and continued his mother's feud with [[Brunhilda of Austrasia|Queen Brunhilda of Austrasia]] with equal viciousness and bloodshed, finally achieving her execution in an especially brutal manner in&amp;nbsp;613 and uniting Francia under his rule. Like his father, he built up his territories by invading after the deaths of other kings. 

Chlothar's reign was lengthy by contemporary standards, but saw the continuing erosion of royal power by the nobility against a backdrop of feuding [[Merovingians]]. The [[Edict of Paris]] in&amp;nbsp;614, which was concerned with several aspects of appointments to offices and the administration of the kingdom, has been interpreted in different ways by modern historians. In&amp;nbsp;617, Chlothar made the [[Mayor of the Palace]] a role held for life, an important step in the progression of this office from being first the manager of the royal household to the effective head of government, and eventually the monarch, under [[Pepin the Short|Pepin the Younger]] in&amp;nbsp;751. Chlothar ceded rule over [[Austrasia]] to his young son [[Dagobert I]] in&amp;nbsp;623. Unusually for a Merovingian monarch, he practiced [[monogamy]], though deaths meant that he had three queens. He was generally an ally of the church and, perhaps inspired by the example of his uncle Guntram, his reign seems to lack the outrageous acts of murder perpetrated by many of his relations, with the exception of the execution of Brunhilda.

Chapter&amp;nbsp;43 relates the attempted usurpation of Austrasia by the Pippinid mayor [[Grimoald the Elder]] in summary form. It ends with Grimoald's death by torture under [[Clovis II]] who ruled Neustria. Chapter&amp;nbsp;44 comments on Clovis: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;At the same time, he brought ruin to the kingdom of the Franks with disastrous calamities. This Clovis, moreover, had every kind of filthy habit. He was a seducer and a debaser of women, a glutton, and a drunk. About his death and end, nothing of historical worth may be said. Many writers condemn his end because they do not know the extent of his evil. Thus in uncertainty concerning it, they refer from one to another.{{sfn|Bachrach|1973|p=102}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The rest of this chapter and the beginning of the next chapter stretch between Clovis's death, usually dated to the late 650s, and the accession of [[Theuderic III]], usually dated to&amp;nbsp;673, a four-year reign of "the boy king [[Chlothar III|Chlotar]]".

Chapters 45ff, as [[Ursinus the Abbot]] had done, provide a hostile account of mayor [[Ebroin]] of Neustria. In contrast to the description of Clovis II quoted above, the author has nothing but praise for [[Childebert III]], "a famous man", whom he describes as "the glorious lord of good memory, Childebert, the just king."{{sfn|Krusch|1888|pp=[http://www.dmgh.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb00000749_00332.html?sortIndex=010%3A020%3A0002%3A010%3A00%3A00 323–324]}} The closing chapters mainly cover [[Charles Martel]].

''Liber Historiae Francorum'' became a primary source for the [[Chronicle_of_Fredegar#Continuations|Continuations to Fredegar's Chronicle]], as redacted by Count [[Childebrand]] in&amp;nbsp;751 on behalf of his half-brother, Charles Martel.

[[Joseph Priestley]] (1733–1804) was a [[Kingdom of Britain|British]] [[natural philosopher]], [[English Dissenters|Dissenting]] [[clergyman]], [[Political philosophy|political theorist]], [[theologian]], and educator. He is best known for his discovery, simultaneously with [[Antoine Lavoisier]], of [[oxygen]] [[gas]].

A member of marginalized religious groups throughout his life and a proponent of what was called "rational Dissent," Priestley advocated [[religious toleration]] and equal rights for [[English Dissenters|Dissenter]]s. He argued for extensive civil rights in works such as the important ''[[Essay on the First Principles of Government]]'', believing that individuals could bring about progress and eventually the [[Millennialism|Millennium]]; he was the foremost British expounder of [[providentialism]].&lt;ref name="tapper"&gt;Tapper, Alan. "Joseph Priestley." ''[[Dictionary of Literary Biography]]'' 252: ''British Philosophers 1500–1799''. Eds. Philip B. Dematteis and Peter S. Fosl. Detroit: Gale Group (2002), 314.&lt;/ref&gt; Priestley also made significant contributions to education, publishing, among other things, ''[[The Rudiments of English Grammar]]'', a seminal work on [[grammar|English grammar]]. In his most lasting contributions to education, he argued for the benefits of a [[liberal arts]] education and of the value of the study of [[Historiography#Modern historiography|modern history]]. In his metaphysical works, Priestley "attempt[ed] to combine theism, materialism, and determinism," a project that has been called "audacious and original."&lt;ref name="tapper"/&gt;

Throughout his life, Priestley was known not only as a political and theological controversialist but also as a natural philosopher. His scientific reputation rested on his writings on [[electricity]], his invention of [[soda water]], and his discovery of 10 previously unknown "Airs" ([[gas]]es), that he reported about from 1774-1786 in a giant book of 6 volumes: [[Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air]]. The most important of these newly discovered airs, was named by Priestley as "dephlogisticated air" (oxygen). But Priestley's determination to reject Lavoisier's "new chemistry" and to cling to [[phlogiston theory]] left him isolated within the scientific community.

This list classifies all of the works by Priestley. It is taken from Ronald E. Crook's ''A Bibliography of Joseph Priestley 1733-1804'' (unless otherwise noted) and it follows very closely his generic subdivisions. All texts are by Priestley unless otherwise noted and only the first English language editions of the texts are listed below.&lt;ref&gt;Crook, Ronald E. ''A Bibliography of Joseph Priestley 1733-1804''. London: Library Association, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; The dash at the beginning of each entry below is a shorthand for the author's name, Joseph Priestley, consistent with standard bibliographic custom.

==In communication==
Miller's law, part of his theory of communication, was formulated by [[George Armitage Miller|George Miller]], Princeton Professor and psychologist.

It instructs us to [[suspension of judgement|suspend judgment]] about what someone is saying so that we can first understand them without imbuing their message with our own personal interpretations. The law states: 

{{quote| text=To understand what another person is saying, you must assume that it is true and try to imagine what it could be true of.| source=[[George Armitage Miller|George Miller]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adrr.com/aa/new.htm|title=Language in Emergency MEDICINE|publisher=|accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://work911.com/communication/miller.htm|title=What is Miller's Law and what is it for?|publisher=|accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Modern Allegorism''' is a school of [[fine art]] in which the artist uses contemporary elements in an [[allegory|allegorical]] style to communicate a positive and uplifting message to the viewer.

The term was first used in print in a book published in 2007 titled ''Tarnowski: Modern Allegories'' &lt;!-- Published by Masterpiece Publishing, Inc. ISBN #975-0-9790727-0-3 --&gt;about the work of artist [[Glen Tarnowski]]. Tarnowski coined the term to describe artwork that communicated to a modern world in the same way that [[Renaissance]] artists communicated values, ethics and morality to the largely illiterate population of the time.

The three subgenres of Modern Allegorism include whimsical, inspirational/spiritual, and [[paradox]]ical. These subgenres describe the mechanism through which the artist conveys the message. Whimsical modern allegories use humor in a non-critical fashion to encourage the viewer to question their own perspectives and behavior. Inspirational/spiritual modern allegories attempt to inspire the viewer to believe in their own abilities and trust their innate gifts. Paradoxical modern allegories position common elements in ways that are contrary to the viewer's expectation in order to encourage the viewer to evaluate the commonplace and see their own preconceptions in a new light.

The  various names used since [[Classical antiquity|classical times]] for the people known today as the '''[[Celts]]''' are of disparate origins.

The name {{lang|grc|Κελτοί}} (''Keltoi'') and {{lang|la|Celtae}} is used in [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]], respectively, as the name of a people of the [[La Tène culture|La Tène horizon]] in the region of the upper [[Rhine]] and [[Danube]] during the 6th to 1st centuries BC in [[Greco-Roman ethnography]]. The etymology of this name and that of the [[Gauls]] {{lang|grc|Γαλάται}} {{lang|grc-Latn|Galatai}} / {{lang|la|Galli}} is of uncertain etymology. The name of the [[Welsh people|Welsh]], on the other hand, is taken from the designator used by the [[Germanic peoples]] for Celtic- and Latin-speaking peoples, *''[[Walhaz]]'', meaning "foreign".

The linguistic sense of the name ''Celts'', grouping all speakers of [[Celtic languages]], is modern. In particular, aside from a 1st-century literary genealogy of ''Celtus'' the grandson of ''Bretannos'' by Heracles, there is no record of the term "Celt" being used prior to the 17th century in connection with the inhabitants of [[Ireland]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]] during the Iron Age.

==''Celts'', ''Celtae''==
The first recorded use of the name of Celts&amp;nbsp;– as {{lang|grc|'''Κελτοί'''}} (''Keltoi'')&amp;nbsp;– to refer to an ethnic group was by [[Hecataeus of Miletus]], the Greek geographer, in 517 BC, when writing about a people living near Massilia (modern [[Marseille]]).&lt;ref&gt;H. D. Rankin, {{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fdqk4vXqntgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22celts%22&amp;q |title=''Celts and the classical world''|pages=1–2 |publisher=Routledge, 1998 {{ISBN|0-415-15090-6}}|accessdate=2010-06-07 |isbn=978-0-415-15090-3 |year=1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 5th century BC [[Herodotus]] referred to ''Keltoi'' living around the head of the Danube and also in the far west of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''The Histories'', 2.33; 4.49.&lt;/ref&gt;

The etymology of the term ''Keltoi'' is unclear. Possible roots include Indo-European *''k´el''-‘to hide’ (also in Old Irish celid), IE *''k´el''- ‘to heat’ or *''kel''- ‘to impel’.&lt;ref&gt;John T. Koch (ed.), ''Celtic Culture: a historical encyclopedia''. 5 vols. 2006, p. 371. Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO.&lt;/ref&gt; Several authors have supposed it to be Celtic in origin, while others view it as a name coined by Greeks. Linguist Patrizia De Bernardo Stempel falls in the latter group, and suggests the meaning "the tall ones".&lt;ref&gt;P. De Bernardo Stempel 2008. Linguistically Celtic ethnonyms: towards a classification, in ''Celtic and Other Languages in Ancient Europe'', J. L. García Alonso (ed.), 101-118. Ediciones Universidad Salamanca.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romans preferred the name [[Gauls]] ({{lang-la|Galli}}) for those Celts whom they first encountered in northern Italy ([[Cisalpine Gaul]]). In the first century BC Caesar referred to the Gauls as calling themselves Celts in their own tongue.&lt;ref&gt;[[Julius Caesar]], {{lang|la|[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]}} [[s:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 1#1|1.1]]: "All Gaul is divided into three parts, one of which the Belgae live, another in which the Aquitani live, and the third are those who in their own tongue are called Celts ({{lang|la|Celtae}}), in our language Gauls ({{lang|la|Galli}}). Compare the tribal name of the {{lang|la|[[Celtici]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 1st-century poet [[Parthenius of Nicaea]], [[Celtus]] ({{lang|grc|Κελτός}}, ''Keltos'') was the son of [[Heracles]] and [[Celtine]] ({{lang|grc|Κελτίνη}}, ''Keltine''), the daughter of Bretannus ({{lang|grc|Βρεττανός}}, ''Brettanos''); this literary genealogy exists nowhere else and was not connected with any known cult.&lt;ref&gt;Parthenius, ''[http://www.theoi.com/Text/Parthenius2.html#30 Love Stories]'' 2, 30&lt;/ref&gt; Celtus became the [[eponymous]] ancestor of Celts.&lt;ref&gt;"&lt;cite&gt;Celtine, daughter of Bretannus, fell in love with Heracles and hid away his kine (the cattle of Geryon) refusing to give them back to him unless he would first content her. From Celtus the Celtic race derived their name.&lt;/cite&gt;" {{Cite web| title= (Ref.: Parth. 30.1-2)|url=http://homepage.mac.com/cparada/GML/Heracles1.html|accessdate=5 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Latin {{lang|la|Celta}} came in turn from [[Herodotus]]' word for the [[Gauls]], {{lang|grc-Latn|Keltoi}}. The Romans used {{lang|la|Celtae}} to refer to continental Gauls, but apparently not to [[Insular Celtic languages|Insular Celts]]. The latter are divided linguistically into [[Goidels]] and [[Brythons]].

The name ''[[Celtiberi]]'' is used by [[Diodorus Siculus]] in the 1st century BC, of a people which he considered a mixture of ''Celtae'' and ''[[Iberians|Iberi]]''.

===''Celtici''===

Aside from the [[Celtiberians]] —Lusones, Titi, Arevaci and Pelendones among others— who inhabited large regions of central Spain, Greek and Roman geographers also spoke of a people or group of peoples called ''Celtici'' or ''Κελτικοί'', living in the South of modern-day Portugal, in the [[Alentejo]] region, between the [[Tagus]] and the [[Guadiana]] rivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lorrio|first=Alberto J.|author2=Gonzalo Ruiz Zapatero|title=The Celts in Iberia: An Overview|journal=e-Keltoi|date=1 February 2005|volume=6|pages=183–185|url=http://www4.uwm.edu/celtic/ekeltoi/volumes/vol6/6_4/lorrio_zapatero_6_4.pdf|accessdate=5 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are first mentioned by [[Strabo]],  who wrote that they were the most numerous people inhabiting that region. Later, the description of Ptolemy shows a more reduced territory, comprising the regions from [[Évora]] to [[Setúbal]], being the coastal and southern areas occupied by the [[Turdetani]].

A second group of Celtici was mentioned by Pliny living in the region of Baeturia (northwestern [[Andalusia]]); he considered that they proceeded "of the Celtiberians from the Lusitania, because of their religion, language, and because of the names of their cities".&lt;ref&gt;'Celticos a Celtiberis ex Lusitania advenisse manifestum est sacris, lingua, oppidorum vocabulis', NH, II.13&lt;/ref&gt;

In the North, in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], another group of Celtici&lt;ref&gt;''Celtici'': Pomponius Mela and Pliny; ''Κελτικοί'': Strabo&lt;/ref&gt; dwelt the coastal areas. They comprised several ''populi'', including the Celtici proper: the ''Praestamarci'' south of the [[Tambre River|Tambre river]] (''Tamaris''), the ''Supertamarci'' north of it, and the ''Neri'' by the Celtic promontory (''Promunturium Celticum''). [[Pomponius Mela]] affirmed that all the inhabitants of the coastal regions, from the bays of southern Galicia and till the [[Astures]], were also Celtici: "All (this coast) is inhabited by the Celtici, except from the [[Douro river]] to the bays, where the Grovi dwelt (…) In the north coast first there are the Artabri, still of the Celtic people (''Celticae gentis''), and after them the Astures."&lt;ref&gt;'Totam Celtici colunt, sed a Durio ad flexum Grovi, fluuntque per eos Avo, Celadus, Nebis, Minius et cui oblivionis cognomen est Limia. Flexus ipse Lambriacam urbem amplexus recipit fluvios Laeron et Ullam. Partem quae prominet Praesamarchi habitant, perque eos Tamaris et Sars flumina non longe orta decurrunt, Tamaris secundum Ebora portum, Sars iuxta turrem Augusti titulo memorabilem. Cetera super Tamarici Nerique incolunt in eo tractu ultimi. Hactenus enim ad occidentem versa litora pertinent. Deinde ad septentriones toto latere terra convertitur a Celtico promunturio ad Pyrenaeum usque. Perpetua eius ora, nisi ubi modici recessus ac parva promunturia sunt, ad Cantabros paene recta est. In ea primum Artabri sunt etiamnum Celticae gentis, deinde Astyres.', Pomponius Mela, Chorographia, III.7-9.&lt;/ref&gt; He also mentioned the fabulous isles of tin, the ''Cassiterides'', as situated among these Celtici.&lt;ref&gt;Pomponius Mela, Chorographia, III.40.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Celtici Supertarmarci have also left a number of inscriptions,&lt;ref&gt;Eburia / Calveni f(ilia) / Celtica / Sup(ertamarca) |(castello?) / Lubri; Fusca Co/edi f(ilia) Celti/ca Superta(marca) / |(castello) Blaniobr/i; Apana Ambo/lli f(ilia) Celtica / Supertam(arca) / Maiobri; Clarinu/s Clari f(ilius) Celticus Su/pertama(ricus).

This is also the name of an archpriesthood  of the Catholic Church, a division of the archbishopric of [[Santiago de Compostela]], encompassing part of the lands attributed to the Celtici Supertamarci by ancient authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Álvarez|first=Rosario, Francisco Dubert García, Xulio Sousa Fernández (ed.)|title=Lingua e territorio|year=2006|publisher=Consello da Cultura Galega|location=Santiago de Compostela|isbn=84-96530-20-5|pages=98–99|url=http://consellodacultura.org/mediateca/extras/lingua_territorio.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Introduction in Early Modern literature===

The name of the ''Celtae'' is revived in the learned literature of the [[Early Modern period]].
The French ''celtique'' and the German ''celtisch'' appear in the 16th century. The English word ''Celts'' is  first attested in 1607.&lt;ref&gt;
''The Indians were wont to use no bridles, like the Græcians and Celts.''
[[Edward Topsell]], ''The historie of foure-footed beastes'' (1607), p. 251 (cited after [[OED]]).&lt;/ref&gt;
The adjective ''Celtic'', formed after French ''celtique'', appears a little later, in the mid 17th century. An early attestation is found in Milton's ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (1667), in reference to the [[Insular Celts]] of antiquity: ''[the Ionian gods ... who] o'er the Celtic [fields] roamed the utmost Isles.'' (I.520, here in the 1674 spelling).

Use of ''Celtic'' in the linguistic sense arises in the 18th century, in the work of  [[Edward Lhuyd]].&lt;ref&gt;(Lhuyd, p. 290) Lhuyd, E. ''"Archaeologia Britannica; An account of the languages, histories, and customs of the original inhabitants of Great Britain."'' (reprint ed.) Irish University Press, 1971. {{ISBN|0-7165-0031-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century the interest in "[[primitivism]]", which led to the idea of the "[[noble savage]]", brought a wave of enthusiasm for all things "Celtic". The antiquarian [[William Stukeley]] pictured a race of "Ancient Britons" constructing the "Temples of the Ancient Celts" such as [[Stonehenge]] (actually a pre-Celtic structure) before he decided in 1733 to recast the "Celts" in his book as "[[Druid]]s".&lt;ref name=aoc&gt;Laing, Lloyd and Jenifer (1992) ''Art of the Celts'', London, Thames and Hudson {{ISBN|0-500-20256-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ossian]] fables written by [[James Macpherson]] - portrayed as ancient [[Scottish Gaelic]] poems - added to this romantic enthusiasm. The "Irish revival" came after the [[Catholic Emancipation]] Act of 1829 as a conscious attempt to demonstrate an Irish national identity, and with its counterpart in other countries subsequently became known as the "[[Celtic revival]]".&lt;ref name=aoc/&gt;

The initial consonant of the English words ''[[:wikt:Celt|Celt]]'' and ''[[:wikt:Celtic|Celtic]]'' is realised primarily as {{IPA|/k/}} and occasionally {{IPA|/s/}} in both modern UK standard English and American English,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In the oldest attested [[Greek language|Greek]] form, and originally also in [[Classical Latin|Latin]], it was pronounced {{IPA|/k/}}, but a regular process of [[palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]] around the first century AD changed {{IPA|/k/}} → {{IPA|/s/}} in [[Late Latin|later Latin]] whenever it appears beside a front vowel like {{IPA|/e/}}. The pronunciation with {{IPA|/k/}} was taken into [[German language|German]], {{IPA|/s/}} into [[French language|French]], and both at different times were taken into English.

The English word originates in the 17th century, and until the mid 19th century, the sole pronunciation in English was {{IPA|/s/}} in keeping with the way the letter ⟨[[c]]⟩ was inherited by [[Middle English]] from [[Old French]]. From the mid-19th century, academic publications advocated the variant with {{IPA|/k/}} on the basis of a new understanding of the origins of the word. The pronunciation with {{IPA|/s/}} remained standard throughout the 19th to early 20th century, but {{IPA|/k/}} gained ground during the later 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;MacKillop, J. (1998) ''Dictionary of Celtic Mythology.'' New York: Oxford University Press {{ISBN|0-19-869157-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A notable exception is that the {{IPA|/s/}} pronunciation remains the most recognised form when it occurs in the names of sports teams, most notably [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic Football Club]] in Scotland, and the [[Boston Celtics]] basketball team in the United States. The [[Cavan]] newspaper ''[[The Anglo-Celt]]'' also uses the {{IPA|/s/}}.&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/theanglocelt/status/677805884056190976 @theanglocelt Twitter feed]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern uses===
In current usage the terms "Celt" and "Celtic" can take several senses depending on context: 
The [[Celts]] of the European Iron Age, the group of Celtic-speaking peoples in [[historical linguistics]], and the modern [[Celtic identity]] derived from the Romanticist [[Celtic Revival]].

====Linguistic context====
{{further|Celtic languages}}
After its use by Edward Lhuyd in 1707,&lt;ref&gt;(Lhuyd, p. 290) Lhuyd, E. (1971) ''Archaeologia Britannica; An account of the languages, histories, and customs of the original inhabitants of Great Britain.'' (reprint ed.) Irish University Press, {{ISBN|0-7165-0031-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; the use of the word "Celtic" as an [[umbrella term]] for the pre-Roman peoples of the British Isles gained considerable popularity.
Lhuyd was the first to recognise that the Irish, British and Gaulish languages were related to one another, and the inclusion of the Insular Celts under the term "Celtic" from this time expresses this linguistic relationship. By the late 18th century, the Celtic languages were recognised as one branch within the larger [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European family]].

====Historiographical context====
{{further|Celts}}
The Celts are an ethno-linguistic group of Iron Age European peoples, including the [[Gauls]] (including derived groups such as the [[Lepontians]] and the [[Galatia]]ns), the [[Celtiberians]] and the [[Insular Celts]].

The timeline of [[Prehistoric settlement of the British Isles (disambiguation)|Celtic settlement in the British Isles]] is unclear and the object of much speculation, but it is clear that by the 1st century BC, most of Great Britain and Ireland was inhabited by Celtic-speaking peoples now known as the [[Insular Celts]], divided into two large groups, [[Britons (historical)|Brythonic]] or P-Celtic, and [[Goidelic]] or Q-Celtic.
The Brythonic groups under [[Roman Britannia|Roman]] rule were known in Latin as ''[[Britons (historical)|Britanni]]'', while use of the names ''Celtae'' or ''Galli'' / ''Galatai'' was restricted to the [[Gauls]]. There are no specimens of Goidelic languages prior to the appearance of [[Primitive Irish]] inscriptions in the 4th century AD, however there are earlier references to the ''[[Iverni]]'' (in [[Ptolemy]] ca. 150, later also appearing as ''Hierni'' and ''Hiberni''), and by 314, to the ''[[Scoti]]''.

[[Simon James (archaeologist)|Simon James]] argues that, while the term "Celtic" expresses a valid linguistic connection, its use of both Insular and Continental Celtic culture is misleading, as archaeology does not suggest a unified Celtic culture during the Iron Age.{{importance inline}}{{Page needed|date=January 2010}} &lt;!--I know he says these things, but we should have page cites for these statements --&gt;

====Modern context====
{{further|Celtic identity|Celtic Revival|Celtic nations|Pan-Celticism}}
With the rise of [[Celtic nationalism]] in the early to mid 19th century, the term "Celtic" also came to be a self-designation used by proponents of a modern [[Celtic identity]]. Thus, the contributor to "The Celt" discussing "the word Celt" states "The Greeks called us Keltoi", expressing a position of [[ethnic essentialism]] that extends the first person pronoun to include both 19th-century Irishmen and the Danubian Κελτοί of Herodotus.&lt;ref name="Celt1857"&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This sense of "Celtic" is preserved in its political sense in Celtic nationalism of organisations such as the [[Celtic League (political organisation)|Celtic League]], but it is also used in a more general unpolitical sense, in expressions such as [[Celtic music]].

==''Galli'', ''Galatai'' ==

Latin {{lang|la|Galli}} might be from an originally Celtic ethnic or [[tribal name]], perhaps borrowed into Latin during the early 5th century BC Celtic expansions into Italy. Its root may be the Common Celtic ''*galno-'', meaning  "power" or "strength". The Greek {{lang|grc|Γαλάται}} {{lang|grc-Latn|Galatai}} (cf. [[Galatia]] in Anatolia) seems to be based on the same root, borrowed directly from the same hypothetical Celtic source which gave us {{lang|la|Galli}} (the suffix ''-atai'' is simply an ethnic name indicator).

Schumacher's account is slightly different: He states that ''Galli'' (nominative singular *''gallos'') is derived from the present stem of the verb which he reconstructs for [[Proto-Celtic language|Proto-Celtic]] as *''gal-nV-'' (it is not clear what the vowel in the suffix, marked as ''V'', should be reconstructed as), whose meaning he gives as "to be able to, to gain control of", while ''Galatai'' comes from the same root and is to be reconstructed as nominative singular *''galatis'' &lt; *''gelH-ti-s''. He gives the same meaning for both reconstructs, namely "Machthaber", i. e. "potentate, ruler (or even warlord)", or alternatively "Plünderer, Räuber", i. e. "raider, looter, pillager, marauder", and points out that both names can be [[Exonym and endonym|exonyms]] in order to explain their [[pejorative]] meaning. The [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] verbal root in question is reconstructed by Schumacher as *''gelH-'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schumacher|first1=Stefan|last2=Schulze-Thulin|first2=Britta|last3=aan de Wiel|first3=Caroline|title=Die keltischen Primärverben.

===Gallaeci===
While the name of the [[Gallaeci]] (also  Callaeci or Callaici), a Celtic federation in North-West Iberia, may seem related to ''Galli'', it is not.
The Romans named the entire region north of the [[Douro]], where the [[Castro culture]] existed, in honour of the castro people that settled in the area of [[Calle (Iberia)|Calle]] — the ''Callaeci''.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

==''Gaul'', ''Gaulish'', ''Welsh''==
{{Main|Walha|Etymology of Vlach}}

The English ''Gaul'' and {{lang-fr|link=no|Gaule, Gaulois}} are unrelated to Latin ''Gallia'' and ''Galli'', despite superficial similarity. They are rather derived from the Germanic term ''[[walha]]'', "foreigner, Romanized person", an exonym applied by Germanic speakers to Celts, likely via a Latinization of Frankish ''Walholant'' "Gaul", literally "Land of the Foreigners", making it partially cognate with the names [[Wales]] and [[Wallachia]], the usual word for the non-Germanic-speaking peoples (Celtic-speaking and Latin-speaking indiscriminately).&lt;ref&gt;Sjögren, Albert, "Le nom de "Gaule", in "Studia Neophilologica", Vol. 11 (1938/39) pp. 210-214.&lt;/ref&gt; The Germanic ''w'' is regularly rendered as ''gu'' / ''g'' in French (cf. ''guerre'' = ''war'', ''garder'' = ''ward''), and the diphthong ''au'' is the regular outcome of ''al'' before a following consonant (cf. ''cheval'' ~ ''chevaux''). ''Gaule'' or ''Gaulle'' can hardly be derived from Latin ''Gallia'', since ''g'' would become ''j'' before ''a'' (cf. ''gamba'' &gt; ''jambe''), and the diphthong ''au'' would be unexplained; the regular outcome of Latin ''Gallia'' is ''Jaille'' in French which is found in several western placenames.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology]]'' (OUP 1966), p. 391.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Larousse&gt;''Nouveau dictionnaire étymologique et historique'' (Larousse 1990), p. 336.&lt;/ref&gt;

The French term for "Welsh" is ''[[:wikt:gallois|gallois]]'', which is, however, not derived from the Latin ''Galli'', but, like ''gaulois'', borrowed (with suffix substitution) from Proto Germanic *''walhisks'' "Celtic, Gallo-Roman, Romance" or its Old English descendant ''wælisc'' (= Modern English ''Welsh''). The English form "Gaul" (first recorded in the 17th century) and "Gaulish" come from the French "Gaule" and "Gaulois", which translate Latin "Gallia" and "Gallus, -icus" respectively. In Old French, the words "gualeis", "galois", "walois" (Northern French phonetics keeping /w/) had different meanings: Welsh or the ''[[Langue d'oïl]]'', etc. On the other hand, the word "Waulle" (Northern French phonetics keeping /w/) is recorded for the first time in the 13th century to translate the Latin word ''Gallia'', while "gaulois" is recorded for the first time in the 15th century, and the scholars use it to translate the Latin words ''Gallus'' / ''Gallicus''. The word comes from Proto-Germanic *''Walha-'' (see [[Gaul#Name|Gaul: Name]]).

The English word "Welsh" originates from the word ''wælisċ'', the [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] form of *''[[walha|walhiska-]]'', the reconstructed Proto-Germanic word for "foreign"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "Celt" (South German [[:de:Welsche|Welsch(e)]] "Celtic speaker", "French speaker", "Italian speaker"; Old Norse "valskr", pl. "valir" "Gaulish", "French"), that is supposed to be derived of the name of the "[[Volcae]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Koch|first=John Thomas|title=Celtic culture: a historical encyclopedia|year=2006|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=1-85109-440-7|page=532}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Celtic tribe who lived first in the South of Germany and emigrated then to Gaul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mountain|first=Harry|title=The Celtic Encyclopedia, Volume 1|year=1998|publisher=[[uPublish.com]]|isbn=1-58112-889-4|page=252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Germanic term may ultimately have a Celtic source:  It is possibly the result of a loan of the Celtic tribal name {{lang|la|[[Volcae]]}} into pre-Germanic, ''*wolk-'' changing according to [[Grimm's Law]] to yield proto-Germanic ''*walh-''. The Volcae were one of the Celtic peoples who for two centuries barred the southward expansion of the [[Germanic tribes]] (in what is now central Germany) on the line of the [[Harz mountains]] and into [[Saxony]] and [[Silesia]].

In the Middle Ages, territories with primarily [[Romance languages|Romance]]-speaking populations, such as France and Italy, were known in German as {{lang|de|Welschland}} as opposed to {{lang|de|Deutschland}}, and the word is cognate with ''[[Vlach]]'' and ''[[Walloons|Walloon]]'' as well as with the "-wall" in "Cornwall". Other examples are the surnames "Wallace" and "Walsh". During the early Germanic period, the term seems to have been applied to the peasant population of the [[Roman Empire]], most of whom were in the areas immediately settled by the Germanic people.

==Gaels==
{{Main|Gaels}}

The term ''Gael'' is, despite superficial similarity, also completely unrelated to either ''Galli'' or ''Gaul''. 
The name ultimately derives from the [[Old Irish]] word ''Goídel''. Lenition rendered the /d/ silent, though it is still represented in spelling of the modern Gaelic languages as {{angle bracket|dh}}: ([[Irish language|Irish]] and [[Manx language|Manx]]) ''Gaedheal'' or ''Gael'', [[Scottish Gaelic]] ''Gàidheal''.

==''Britanni''==
{{main|Britain (name)}}
The Celtic-speaking people of Great Britain were known as ''[[Britons (historical)|Brittanni]]'' or ''Brittones'' in Latin and as Βρίττωνες in Greek; an earlier form was ''Pritani'', or Πρετ(τ)αν(ν)οί in Greek (as recorded by [[Pytheas]] in the 4th century BC, among others, and surviving in Welsh as ''Prydain'', the old name for Britain). Related to this is *[[Priteni]], the reconstructed self-designation of the people later known as [[Picts]], which is recorded later in [[Old Irish]] as ''Cruithin'' and Welsh as ''Prydyn''.

At the beginning of the [[Holocene]], about 12,000 years ago, humanity entered a period of increasing technological sophistication, resulting in the [[Neolithic Revolution]]. 

Breadmaking considerably predates this period, but people in the [[Middle East]] now began cultivating wild cereal and pulses. Dogs had been domesticated over thousands of years; [[Nomadic empire|nomadic]] shepherding became possible through domestication of goats, sheep, horses, camels and cattle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=A.

About 7,000 years ago, livestock herding was sufficiently established to allow a widespread abandonment of hunter-gathering in favour of settled lifestyles. Pottery was increasingly useful, and permanent buildings, constructed from [[mudbrick]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fu|first=Qiaomei|last2=Rudan|first2=Pavao|last3=Pääbo|first3=Svante|last4=Krause|first4=Johannes|title=Complete Mitochondrial Genomes Reveal Neolithic Expansion into Europe|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221716253_Complete_Mitochondrial_Genomes_Reveal_Neolithic_Expansion_into_Europe|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=7|issue=3|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0032473|pmc=3302788|pmid=22427842}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=World history|last=Wood|first=Tat|publisher=Quercus|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; appeared.

A '''non-convergent discourse''' (NCD) is a [[discourse]] in which the participants do not converge in their language, which results in the use of different languages. Alternative names for this phenomenon are asymmetric and bilingual discourse.

The term was introduced by the sociologist Reitze Jonkman. He distinguishes two motivations for people to engage in an NCD:

*Insufficient active knowledge of the other participants' language, combined with a good passive knowledge. It usually takes longer for a person learning a foreign language to speak it fluently than to understand it when it is being spoken. This type of NCD is common in the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] languages of the [[Scandinavia]]n-[[Nordic countries|Nordic]] region of Europe, where the differences between [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], and [[Danish language|Danish]] are relatively small, and do not necessarily obstruct use of the participants' native languages. The same occurs between speakers of [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]] and to a lesser degree between speakers of [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (and their respective variants), where it is also possible to understand what the other person is saying as long as it is said slowly; (as such between residents of Spain and Portugal as well as between residents of Brazil and neighboring Spanish-speaking countries). Also, it is possible among speakers of various South-Slavic languages. For instance, a Serbian tourist in Macedonia or Bulgaria will often be able to communicate with locals without ever having studied Bulgarian or Macedonian. Another good example would be north India - Users of [[Hindi]], [[Urdu]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Gujarati language|Gujrati]] understand each other very well while speaking their mother tongue. In East India, [[Bengali language|Bengali]] and [[Assamese language|Assamese]] speakers can usually understand one another's speech. Also in South India, Tamil and Malayalam Speakers are often able to understand each other and converse in their native languages to each other while understanding the bulk of the conversation.  In some areas where bilingualism is common, this can also be done with languages that are not mutually intelligible if both speakers are assumed to understand the other's language, as is the case in cities like Montreal.
*Ethnic marking: the use of a preferred variety, in order to stress one's belonging to a certain cultural or ethnic group. This occurs in Northern [[Germany]], for example, where speakers of [[Low German]] and [[German language|standard German]] do not converge.

A third motivation for engaging in an NCD lies on the personal level. According to [[Howard Giles|Giles]]' [[Communication Accommodation Theory]], interpersonal contacts are negotiations. In a discourse, people seek to create understanding by stressing common features. However, when this will for creating understanding is not present (for example, in cases where the participants feel a strong dislike for each other), they dissociate from each other by stressing the differences. The use of different languages might be the result of such a dissociation strategy.

Sometimes the motivation for engaging in an NCD is misunderstood, especially in contexts where they are uncommon. NCD participants with an ethnic marking strategy might be wrongly interpreted as if they were expressing dislike. This type of misunderstanding is especially common among speakers who come from monolingual areas and find themselves in a bilingual area, where a second language is used alongside their own and NCDs are common.

[http://www.scimaps.org/ ''Places &amp; Spaces: Mapping Science''] is an internationally recognized science exhibition that demonstrates the power of maps to analyze, organize, and visualize abstract intellectual spaces. The exhibit showcases high-resolution maps that represent complex data in a visually understandable format. The maps featured in ''Places &amp; Spaces'' were created by a global collection of experts in the fields of [[scientometrics]], the [[Natural science|natural]], [[Outline of physical science|physical]], and [[social science]]s, [[visual arts]], [[Social policy|socio-political policymaking]], and the [[humanities]]. By the end of 2014, the exhibit had collected 100 maps and various additional elements. The latter include [http://www.ingogunther.com/ Ingo Günther's] [http://www.ingogunther.com/238167/482379/work/world-processor WorldProcessor Globes], an [http://www.scimaps.org/bonus_materials.html illuminated diagram display], the [[Gapminder Foundation|Gapminder]] Card Game, hands-on science maps for kids, and the award-winning short film [http://yfshen.info/humanexus/ Humanexus].

Each year, the exhibition's international advisory board hosts a competitive selection process to choose ten new maps focused around a central theme. Past themes have included:

== History ==
The exhibit was envisioned by [[Katy Börner]], Sarah I. Fabrikant, Deborah MacPerson and André Skupin in January 2005, and it debuted at the Annual Meeting of the [[Association of American Geographers]] in April of that year. Since then, the exhibition has been displayed at more than 220 venues in 22 countries, including 15 in Europe, as well as Japan, China, Brazil, South Africa, Australia, Canada, and the United States. ''Places &amp; Spaces'' functions as an outreach component of the [[Cyberinfrastructure for Network Science Center]], which is housed at the [http://www.soic.indiana.edu/ School of Informatics and Computing] at [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]].

'''Political culture''' is defined by the ''[[International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences]]'' as the "set of attitudes, beliefs and sentiments that give order and meaning to a [[Politics|political]] process and which provide the underlying assumptions and rules that govern behavior in the [[political system]]". It encompasses both the political ideals and operating norms of a [[polity]]. Political culture is thus the manifestation of the psychological and subjective dimensions of politics. A political ''culture'' is the product of both the history of a political system and the histories of the members. Thus, it is rooted equally in public events and private experience.&lt;ref&gt;''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences'', New York: Macmillen, 1968, Vol. 12, p. 218 (quoted in Jo Freedman, [http://www.uic.edu/orgs/cwluherstory/jofreeman/polparties/polculture.htm The Political Culture of the Democratic and Republican Parties] (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conceptions==
In 1963, two Americans, Gabriel Almond&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.stanford.edu/news/2003/january8/obitalmond-18.html Stanford Report, Obit: Gabriel Almond, January 8, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; and Sidney Verba, outlined three types of political culture that can be combined to create civic culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Verba|first1=Sidney|last2=Almond|first2=Gabriel|title=The Civic Culture|date=1963|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton}}&lt;/ref&gt; These three key features expressed by both men were composed to establish a link between the public and the government. The first of these features is "deference", which considers the concepts of respect, acknowledgment of "inferiority" or "superiority", and authority in society.

The second key feature is "consensus" which represents the key link between government and public agreement and appeasement. Support for appeasement may not always be shared by the whole nation, but as a whole, people agree to sustain it, meaning it is a common agreement. There are various "Examples of Consensus" in British political culture: how people are governed as a whole, consensus regarding the welfare state, agreement as to who acts as head of state, and with what powers.

The third feature of British political culture is "homogeneity". Church attendance as a whole is decreasing. Sections of the Scottish and Welsh populations have called for independence.

==Political philosophy==
The term political culture was brought into political science to promote the American political system. The concept was used by [[Gabriel Almond]] in the late 50s, and outlined in ''[[The Civic Culture]]'' (1963, [[Gabriel Almond|Almond]] &amp; [[Sidney Verba|Verba]]), but was soon opposed by two European political scientists, [[Gerhard Lehmbruch]] and [[Arend Lijphart]]. Lehmbruch analysed politics in [[Switzerland]] and [[Austria]] and Lijphart analysed politics in [[Netherlands]]. Both argued that there are political systems that are more stable than the one in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;Lukšič, Igor (2006). ''Politična kultura'', pp. 40–42. [[University of Ljubljana|FDV, Ljubljana]]. Retrieved on June 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Categories==
Different typologies of political culture have been proposed. According to political scientist William S. Stewart, all political behavior can be explained as participating in one or more of eight political cultures: [[anarchism]], [[oligarchy]], [[Tory corporatism]], [[fascism]], [[classical liberalism]], radical liberalism, [[democratic socialism]], and [[Leninist socialism]]. Societies that exemplify each of these cultures have existed historically.

[[Gabriel Almond]] and [[Sidney Verba]] in ''[[The Civic Culture]]'' outlined three pure types of political culture based on  level and type of [[political participation]] and the nature of people's attitudes toward politics:
* [[Parochial political culture|Parochial]] – Where citizens are only remotely aware of the presence of central government, and live their lives near enough regardless of the decisions taken by the state, distant and unaware of political phenomena. They have neither knowledge nor interest in politics. This type of political culture is in general congruent with a traditional political structure.
* Subject – Where citizens are aware of central government, and are heavily subjected to its decisions with little scope for dissent. The individual is aware of politics, its actors and institutions. It is affectively oriented towards politics, yet it is on the "downward flow" side of the politics. In general congruent with a centralized authoritarian structure.
* Participant – Citizens are able to influence the government in various ways and they are affected by it. The individual is oriented toward the system as a whole, to both the political and administrative structures and processes (to both the input and output aspects). In general congruent with a democratic political structure.

Almond and Verba wrote that these types of political culture can combine to create the [[civic culture]], which mixes the best elements of each.

[[Arend Lijphart]] wrote that there are different classifications of political culture:
* First classification:
** Mass political culture
** [[Elite]] political culture
* Second classification (of elite political culture):
** coalitional
** contradictive

Lijphart also classified the structure of society:
* homogeneous
* heterogeneous

María Eugenia Vázquez Semadeni defines political culture as "the set of discourses and symbolic practices by means of which both individuals and groups articulate their relationship to power, elaborate their political demands and put them at stake."&lt;ref&gt;[Vázquez Semadeni, M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1995">[[File:Hadji Ali demonstrating controlled regurgitation Crisco edit.jpg|thumb|[[Hadji Ali]], known for numerous acts of regurgitation]]
A '''professional regurgitator''' is an entertainer whose act consists of [[swallowing]] and [[regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitating]] various unusual objects. The objects may consist of anything from live animals (live mice: The Great Waldo),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehumanmarvels.com/the-great-waldo-the-regurgitating-geek/|title=Great Waldo act|website=Thehumanmarvels.com|accessdate=2009-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; to light bulbs, billiard balls ([[Stevie Starr]]) and [[kerosene]] ([[Hadji Ali]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.damninteresting.com/hadji-ali-and-the-regurgitators|title=Hadji Ali act|website=Damninteresting.com|accessdate=2009-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some magicians perform regurgitation as part of their act (for instance, [[Harry Houdini]]), but professional regurgitators may perform regurgitation exclusively. In some cases there is debate as to whether demonstrations are true feats of regurgitation or "tricks". For example, [[Stevie Starr]] as part of his performance has swallowed an unsolved [[Rubik's Cube]], then regurgitated a solved cube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://daily.swarthmore.edu/2006/2/27/the-regurgitator-shocks-amazes-overjoys/|title=Swarthmore Daily Gazette account of Starr's act including Rubik's cube trick|website=Daily.swarthmore.edu|accessdate=2009-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.steviestarr.com/stevie_starrs_regurgitation_act.php|title=Description of act including Rubiks cube trick |website=StevieStarr.com|accessdate=2009-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="50890">'''Proto-globalization''' or '''[[early modern]] globalization''' is a period of the [[history of globalization]] roughly spanning the years between 1600 and 1800, following the period of [[archaic globalization]]. First introduced by historians [[A. G. Hopkins]] and [[Christopher Bayly]], the term describes the phase of increasing trade links and cultural exchange that characterized the period immediately preceding the advent of so-called "modern [[globalization]]" in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Hopkins 2003 PP. 3"/&gt;

Proto-globalization distinguished itself from [[modern globalization]] on the basis of expansionism, the method of managing global trade, and the level of information exchange. The period of proto-globalization is marked by such trade arrangements as the [[East India Company]], the shift of [[hegemony]] to Western Europe, the rise of larger-scale conflicts between powerful nations such as the Thirty Year War, and a rise of new commodities—most particularly [[slave trade]]. [[The Triangular Trade]] made it possible for Europe to take advantage of resources within the western hemisphere. The transfer of plant and animal crops and epidemic diseases associated with [[Alfred Crosby]]'s concept of [[The Columbian Exchange]] also played a central role in this process. Proto-globalization trade and communications involved a vast group including [[Europe]]an, [[Muslim]], [[India]]n, [[Southeast Asia]]n and [[China|Chinese]] merchants, particularly in the [[Indian Ocean]] region.

The transition from proto-globalization to [[modern globalization]] was marked with a more complex global network based on both capitalistic and technological exchange; however, it led to a significant collapse in cultural exchange.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

==Description==
[[File:Job Adriaensz. Berckheyde 001.jpg|thumb|Courtyard of the [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange]], c. 1670]]
Although the 17th and 18th centuries saw a rise in Western Imperialism in the world system, the period of Proto-globalization involved increased interaction between Western Europe and the systems that had formed between nations in East Asia and the Middle East.&lt;ref name="Hopkins 2003 PP. 3"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hopkins|2003|p=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Proto-globalization was a period of reconciling the governments and traditional systems of individual nations, world regions, and religions with the "new world order" of global trade, imperialism and political alliances, what historian A.G. Hopkins called "the product of the contemporary world and the product of distant past."&lt;ref name="Hopkins 2003 PP. 3"/&gt;

According to Hopkins, "globalization remains an incomplete process: it promotes fragmentation as well as uniformity; it may recede as well as advance; its geographical scope may exhibit a strong regional bias; its future direction and speed cannot be predicted with confidence—and certainly not by presuming that it has an 'inner logic' of its own.&lt;ref name="Hopkins 2003 PP. 3"/&gt; Before proto-globalization, globalizing networks were the product of "great kings and warriors searching for wealth and honor in fabulous lands, by religious wanderers,...and by merchant princes".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hopkins|2003|pp=4–5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Proto-globalization held on to and matured many aspects of archaic globalization such as the importance of cities, [[immigrant|migrant]]s, and specialization of labor.&lt;ref name="Hopkins, A.G. 2003. PP. 5"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hopkins|2003|p=5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proto-globalization was also marked by two main political and economic developments: "the reconfiguration of the state systems, and the growth of finance, services, and pre-industrial manufacturing".&lt;ref name="Hopkins 2003 PP. 6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hopkins|2003|p=6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of states at the time began to "strengthen their connections between territory, taxation, and sovereignty" despite their continuing [[monopoly]] of loyalties from their citizens.&lt;ref name="Hopkins 2003 PP. 6"/&gt; The process of globalization during this time was heavily focused on material world and the labor needed for its production.&lt;ref name="Hopkins 2003 PP. 7"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hopkins|2003|p=7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The proto-globalization period was a time of "improved efficiency in the transactions sector" with the generation of goods such as sugar, tobacco, tea, coffee, and opium unlike anything the archaic globalization possessed.&lt;ref name="Hopkins 2003 PP. 7"/&gt; The improvement of economic management also spread to the expansion of transportation which created a complex set of connection between the West and East.&lt;ref name="Hopkins 2003 PP. 7"/&gt; The expansion of trade routes led to the "green revolution" based on the plantation system and slave exportation from Africa.&lt;ref name="Hopkins 2003 PP. 7"/&gt;

== Precursors ==
{{Main|Archaic globalization}}

During the pre-modern era early forms of globalization were already beginning to affect a [[world system]], marking a period that historian A. G. Hopkins has called archaic globalization.&lt;ref name="Hopkins 2003 PP. 3"/&gt; The world system leading up to proto-globalization was one that hinged on one or more [[hegemonic]] powers assimilating neighboring cultures into their political system, waging war on other nations, and dominating world trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hopkins|2003|pp=4–5, 7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Maccari-Cicero.jpg|thumb|250px|Representation of a sitting of the [[Roman Senate]]]]
A major [[hegemony]] in archaic globalization was the [[Roman Empire]], which united the Greater Mediterranean Area and Western Europe through a long-running series of military and political campaigns expanding the Roman system of government and Roman values to more underdeveloped areas. Conquered areas became [[province]]s of the empire and Roman military outposts in the provinces became cities with structures designed by the best Roman architects, which hastened the spread of Rome's "modern" way of life while absorbing the traditions and beliefs of these native cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shelton|1998|p=20}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nationalist ideology as well as propaganda supporting the [[Roman Army]] and military success, bravery, and valor also strengthened the Roman Empire's spread across Western Europe and the Mediterranean Area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dillon|Garland|2005|p=235}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman Empire's well-built [[Roman aqueduct|aqueducts]] and cities and sturdy, effective naval fleets, ships and an organized system of [[paved road]]s also facilitated fast, easy travel and better networking and trade with neighboring nations and the provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dillon|Garland|2005|pp=56–58}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Han dynasty]] under [[Han Wudi]] (141–87 BCE), the Chinese government united and became powerful enough that China began to successfully indulge in imperialistic endeavors with its neighboring nations in East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cohen|2000|pp=58–59}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Han China's imperialism was a peaceful tributary system, which focused mainly on diplomatic and trade relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cohen|2000|p=60}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The growth of the Han Empire facilitated trade and cultural exchange with virtually all of the known world as reached from Asia, and Chinese [[silk]]s spread through Asia and Inner Asia and even to Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cohen|2000|pp=61–62}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The early [[T'ang dynasty]] saw China as even more responsive to foreign influence and the T'ang dynasty becoming a great empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fairbank|Reischauer|Craig|1973|p=111}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Overseas trade with India and the Middle East grew rapidly, and China's East and Southern Coasts, once distant and unimportant regions, gradually became chief areas of foreign trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fairbank|Reischauer|Craig|1973|pp=135–36}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Song Dynasty]] China's navy became more powerful thanks to technological improvements in shipbuilding and navigation, and China's maritime commerce also increased exponentially.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fairbank|Reischauer|Craig|1973|p=135}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

China's power began to decline in the 16th century when the rulers of the subsequent [[Ming Dynasty]] neglected the importance of China's trade from sea power. The Ming rulers let China's naval dominance and its grip on the [[Spice trade]] slacken, and the European powers stepped in. [[Portugal]], with its technological advances in naval architecture, weaponry, seamanship and navigation, took over the Spice Trade and subdued China's navy. With this, European [[Imperialism]] and the age of European Hegemony was beginning, although China still retained power of many of its areas of trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fairbank|Reischauer|Craig|1973|pp=181–83}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Changes in trade systems==
[[File:Andries Beeckman - The Castle of Batavia.jpg|thumb|Batavia, capital of [[Dutch East Indies]], c. 1661]] 
One of the most significant differences between proto-globalization and archaic globalization was the switch from inter-nation trading of rarities to the trading of [[commodities]]. During the 12th and 13th centuries it was common to trade items that were foreign and rare to different cultures. A popular trade during archaic globalization involved European merchants sailing to areas of India or China in order to purchase luxury items such as [[porcelain]], [[silk]] and [[spices]]. Traders of the pre-modern period also traded drugs and certain foods such as sugar cane and other crops.&lt;ref name="Hopkins, A.G. 2003. PP. 4"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hopkins|2003|pp=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
While these items were not rarities as such, the drugs and food traded were valued for the health and function of the human body. It was more common during proto-globalization to trade various commodities such as [[cotton]], [[rice]] and [[tobacco]].&lt;ref name="Hopkins, A.G. 2003. PP. 4"/&gt;
The shift into proto-globalization trade signified the "emergence of the modern international order" and the development of early capitalist expansion which began in the Atlantic during the 17th century and spread throughout the world by 1830.&lt;ref name = "Bayly 15"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bayly|2004|p=15}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atlantic slave trade===
{{Main|Atlantic slave trade}}
One of the main reasons for the rise of commodities was the rise in the slave trade, specifically the Atlantic slave trade. [[File:Slave ship diagram.png|200px|right|thumb|Diagram of a slave ship from the Atlantic slave trade. From an Abstract of Evidence delivered before a select committee of the House of Commons in 1790 and 1791.]] The use of slaves prior to the 15th century was only a minor practice in the labor force and was not crucial in the development of products and goods; but, due to labor shortage, the use of slaves rose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Klein|1999|p=2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After 1500, the settlement of island despots and plantation centers in [[São Tomé|Sao Tome]] began trade relations with the [[Kingdom of the Kongo]], which brought West Central Africa into the Atlantic Slave Trade.&lt;ref name="Klein, Henry S PP.9"&gt;{{Harvnb|Klein|1999|p=9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Portuguese maintained an export of slaves from [[Agadir]], an Atlantic port, which they maintained for most of the early 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Thomas|1997|p=107}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Also the Portuguese settlement of the Brazilian subcontinent allowed the opening of the American slave market and slaves were shipped from Sao Tome directly to America.&lt;ref name="Klein, Henry S PP.9"/&gt; The Europeans also took use of the Atlantic Slave Trade in the first half of the century. The European slave ships took their slaves to the [[Iberian Peninsula]], however slave owners in Europe were only seen in wealthy, aristocrat families due to the high costs of slaves and the cheap peasant labor available for agricultural uses, and as its name implies the first use of the African-American slaves in plantation work arose in the Atlantic islands not in the continental Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Klein|1999|p=20}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 10.2 million Africans survived the Atlantic crossing between 1450 and 1870.&lt;ref name="Petersson, Globalization PP. 50"&gt;{{Harvnb|Osterhammel|Petersson|2005|p=50}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The large slave population thrived due to the demand for production from the Europeans who found it cheaper to import crops and goods rather than produce them on their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Solow|1991|p=5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Many wars were fought during the 17th century between the slave trading companies for areas that were economically dependent on slaves. The West India Company gained many slaves through these wars (specifically with Portugal) by captains who had captured enemy ships; between 1623 and 1637, 2,336 were captured and sold in the New World by the West India Company.&lt;ref name="Thomas, Hugh 1870. Pp.170"&gt;{{Harvnb|Thomas|1997|p=170}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The selling of slaves to the New World opened up trading posts in North America; the Dutch opened their first on Manhattan Island in 1613.&lt;ref name="Thomas, Hugh 1870. Pp.170"/&gt; The West India Company had also opened a trading post in the Caribbean and the company was also carrying slaves to a colony of New Netherland.&lt;ref name="Thomas, Hugh 1870. Pp.170"/&gt;
The use of slaves had many benefits to the economies and productions in the areas of trade. The emergent rise of coffee, tea, and chocolate in Europe led to the demand for the production of sugar; 70 percent of slaves were used solely for the labor-intensive production of crop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Thomas|1997|p=189}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Slave trade was also beneficial to the trade voyages, because the constant sailing allowed investors to buy small shares of many ships at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Daudin|2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Hopkin  states that many scholars, him among them, argue that slave trade was essential to the wealth of many nations, during and after proto-globalization, and without the trade production would have plummeted.&lt;ref name="Hopkins, A.G. 2003. PP. 5"/&gt; The investment in ships and [[nautical]] technology was the catalyst to the complex trade networks developed throughout proto-globalization and into [[modern globalization]].&lt;ref name="Hopkins, A.G. 2003. PP. 4"/&gt;

===Plantation economy===
{{Main|Plantation economy}}
[[File:1670 virginia tobacco slaves.jpg|thumb|Slaves processing tobacco in 17th-century Virginia]]
Consequently, the rise of slavery was due to the increasing rise of crops being produced and traded, more specifically the rise of the [[plantation economy]] The rise of the plantations was the main reason for the trade of commodities during proto-globalization. Plantations were used by the exporting countries (mainly America) to grow the raw materials needed to manufacture the goods which were traded back into the plantation economy.&lt;ref name="Tobacco In Virginia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virginiaplaces.org/agriculture/tobacco.html|title=Tobacco in Virginia|accessdate=2009-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commodities that grew in trade due to the plantation economy were mainly tobacco, cotton, sugar cane, and rubber.&lt;ref name="Tobacco In Virginia"/&gt;

====Tobacco====
{{Main|History of tobacco}}
[[File:Nicotiana tabacum Blanco1.36-cropped.jpg|150px|left|thumb|Nicotiana Tabacum]]During the second half of the 16th century, Europeans' interest in the [[New World]] revolved around gold and silver and not tobacco. The European lack of interest in tobacco was due to the fact that the Amerindians controlled the tobacco industry; as long as the Amerindians controlled the supply there was no need for the incorporation in European commercial capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goodman|1993|p=129}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
The trading of [[tobacco]] was a new commodity and was in high popular demand in the 17th century due to the rise of the plantations. Tobacco began to be used a monetary standard, which is why the term "cash crop" was originated.&lt;ref name="Tobacco In Virginia"/&gt;
The first export of tobacco from the then-colonies of the United States (specifically Virginia) to London showed fortunes in the English enterprise and by 1627, the Virginia tobacco was being shipped to London at 500,000 pounds a shipment.&lt;ref name = "Gately 72"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gately|2001|p=72}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1637, tobacco had become the colony's currency and by 1639 Maryland was exporting 100,000 pounds of tobacco to London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goodman|1993|p=136}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  English success with the production of tobacco caught the attention of many Europeans, specifically those colonized on Martinique and Guadeloupe, French islands. These islands soon became wealthy due to the tobacco production and by 1671 roughly one-third of the acreage devoted to the cash crops grown for the islands were for tobacco.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goodman|1993|p=137}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While the cultivation of tobacco thrived, production saw severe depressions in later years due to the profits made from sugar. According to an account of the Barbadian exports 82 percent of the island's export value was due to sugar and less than one percent was accounted for by tobacco.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goodman|1993|p=140}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sugar cane====
{{Main|History of sugar}}
Another commodity that was a prominent source of trade was the production of sugar from the crop [[sugar cane]]. The original habitat of sugar was in India, where it was taken and planted in various islands. Once reaching to the people of the Iberian Peninsula, it was further migrated across the Atlantic Ocean. In the 16th century, the first plantations of sugar were started in the New World, marking the last great stage of migration of the cane to the West.&lt;ref name = "Ellis 4"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ellis|1905|p=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the conflict of transporting sugar in its raw form, sugar was not associated with commerce until the act of refining it came into play; this act became the center for industry. [[Venice]] was the center for refining during the [[Middle Ages]], therefore making them the chief traders of sugar. Although, the Spanish and Portuguese held the monopolies of the sugar cane fields in America, they were being supplied by [[Venice]]. In the 17th century, England dominated Venice and became the center for refining and cultivating sugar; this leadership was maintained until the rise of French industry.&lt;ref name = "Ellis 5"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ellis|1905|p=5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sugar throughout the 17th century was still considered a luxury until the latter half of the 17th century when the sugar was being produced in mass quantities making it available to the mass of the English people.&lt;ref name = "Ellis 6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ellis|1905|p=6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This turn of events made the sugar a commodity, because the crop was not being used in only special occasion, but in all daily meals.

==Hostilities, war, and imperialism==
[[File:Colonisation 1754.png|thumb|250px|Map of colonial empires throughout the world in 1754]]
Proto-globalization differed from modern globalization in the practices of expansionism, methods of managing global trade, finances, as well as commercial innovation. With the shift of expansionism by large nations to Western Europe, nations began competing in an effort to achieve world domination. The rise of larger-scale conflicts between these powerful nations over expanding their wealth led to nations taking control over one another’s territory and then moving products and the accumulated wealth of these conquered regions back to the sovereign country.  Although conflicts occurred throughout the world between 1600 and 1800, European powers found themselves far more equipped to handle the pressures of war. A quote by [[Christopher Alan Bayly]] gives a better interpretation of these advantages by stating, "Europeans became much better at killing people. The European [[European wars of religion|ideological wars]] of the 17th century had created links between war, finance, and commercial innovation which extended all these gains. It gave the Continent a brute advantage in world conflicts which broke out in the 18th century. Western European warfare was peculiarly complicated and expensive, partly because it was amphibious."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bayly|2004|p=64}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These battle-tested nations fought for their own needs, but in reality their success increased European advancement in the global market. Each of the following sections will shed light on the history of several key engagements. Whether a war was religious or commercial, its impact was greatly felt throughout the world. British victories during the [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]] led to their dominance in commercial shipping and naval power. The stage was set for future conflicts between Britain and foreign nations, as well as domestic frustration with “the motherland” on the North American continent. [[The French and Indian War]], fought between the European powers of France and England, led to a British victory and resulted in continued dominance in maritime enterprise. The [[American Revolutionary War]] marked the beginning of the power shift for control over foreign markets.

===English Civil War===

The [[English Civil War]] was a battle over not only religious and political beliefs, but also economic and social as well. This war was between [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]] and [[Royalists]] and took place from 1642 to 1651, but was broken into several separate engagements. [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and his supporters experienced the first two periods of the war, which resulted in King Charles I dissolving [[Parliament]], which would not be called into session again for over ten years. Reasons for this dismissal were because supporters of [[Long Parliament]] tried to install two resolutions into English law. One called for consequences against individuals that taxed without the consent of Parliament and labeled them as enemies of England, while the other stated that innovations in religion would result in the same tag. Each of these policies was aimed at Charles I, in that he was inferior leader as well as a supporter of [[Catholicism]]. This prompted the Puritan Revolt and eventually led to the trial and execution of Charles I for treason. The final stage of the English Civil War came in 1649, and lasted until 1651. This time, [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]], the son of Charles I led supporters against Parliament. The [[Battle of Worcester]], which took place in 1651, marked the end of the English Civil War. Charles II and other royalist forces were defeated by Parliamentarians and their leader [[Oliver Cromwell]]. This war began to take England in different directions regarding religious and political beliefs as well as economic and social. Also, the war constitutionally established that no British monarch was permitted to rule without first having been approved by Parliament.

===Anglo-Dutch War===
[[File:Battle of Scheveningen (Slag bij Ter Heijde)(Jan Abrahamsz. Beerstraten).jpg|thumb|250px|''The '''Battle of Scheveningen''', 10 August 1653'' by [[Jan Abrahamsz Beerstraaten]], painted c. 1654 shows the view of the battle from the Dutch shore where thousands gathered to watch.]]

The [[Anglo-Dutch War]] was a naval conflict between [[England]] and the [[Dutch Republic]] from 1652 to 1654 and was over the competition in commercial maritime and was focused mainly in the [[East Indies]].&lt;ref name="http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/wars_anglodutch1.html."&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/wars_anglodutch1.html |title=First Anglo-Dutch War, (1652–1654) |publisher=Historyofwar.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[Navigation Act]], which forbade the import of goods unless they were transported either in English vessels or by vessels from the country of origin.&lt;ref name="http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/wars_anglodutch1.html."/&gt; This was a policy aimed against the [[Netherlands|Dutch]], and fighting broke out on May 19, 1652 with a small skirmish between Dutch and English fleets.&lt;ref name="http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/wars_anglodutch1.html."/&gt;  The War officially began in July and fighting continued for two years. The [[Battle of Scheveningen]] which is also referred to as [[Texel]] was the end of serious fighting in the war and took place in July 1653.&lt;ref name="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/25010/Anglo-Dutch-Wars.|accessdate=2009-4-11"&gt; Dutch and English fleets numbering over one hundred ships fought for twelve hours resulting in over 1,600 men killed, including [[Admiral Tromp]] for the Dutch and only half that number for the English.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Treaty of Westminster (1654)|Treaty of Westminster]] was signed in April 1654 ending the war and obligated the Dutch Republic to respect the [[Navigation Act]] as well as compensate England for the war.&lt;ref name="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/25010/Anglo-Dutch-Wars.|accessdate=2009-4-11"/&gt;

===French and Indian War===
[[File:Conference Between the French and Indian Leaders Around a Ceremonial Fire by Vernier.jpg|left|thumb|Conference between the French and Indian leaders around a ceremonial fire by [[Émile Louis Vernier]] ]]
[[The French and Indian War]] was between the nations of [[Great Britain]] and [[France]], along with the numerous [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] Nations allied with both.&lt;ref name="philaprintshop.com"&gt;{{Harvnb|Schwartz|1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The French and Indian war was the North American theater of the [[Seven Years' War]] being fought in Europe at the time. Growing population in British territory throughout North America forced expansion west; however, this was met with resistance from the French and their Native American allies.&lt;ref name="philaprintshop.com"/&gt; French forces began entering British territory, building numerous forts in preparation to defend the newly acquired land. The beginning of the war favored the French and their Native American allies, who were able to defeat British forces time and again, and it was not until 1756 that the British were able to hold off their opposition. [[Pittsburgh]] was a center for fighting during the French and Indian War, namely because of the geographical location at the center where three rivers unite: the Allegheny, the Monongahela and the Ohio. The location of present-day Pittsburgh provided an advantage in naval control. Ownership of this point provided not only naval dominance, but it also expanded economic ventures, enabling shipments to be sent and received with relative ease. French and British forces both claimed ownership to this region; the French installing [[Fort Duquesne]] and the British with [[Fort Pitt (Pennsylvania)|Fort Pitt]]. Fort Pitt was established in 1758 after French forces abandoned and destroyed Fort Duquesne.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/s_118602.html&lt;/ref&gt; The French and Indian War came to an end in 1763, after British forces were able to secure [[Quebec]] and [[Montreal]] from the French and on February 10, the [[Peace of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] was signed.&lt;ref name="philaprintshop.com"/&gt; The French were forced to surrender their territory in North America, giving England control all the way to the [[Mississippi River]]. The effects of this war were heavily felt in the North American British colonies. England imposed many taxes on colonists in order to control the newly acquired territory. These tensions would soon culminate into a war for independence as well as a shift in power for dominance in the economic world.

===American Revolutionary War===

[[File:Washington Crossing the Delaware by Emanuel Leutze, MMA-NYC, 1851.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Emanuel Leutze]]'s stylized depiction of ''[[Washington Crossing the Delaware]]'' (1851)]]
The American Revolutionary War was a war between the nation of England and the 13 colonies in the North American continent. This war lasted from 1775 to 1783 and began with the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]], where over 1,150 British soldiers were killed or wounded. This equated to almost half of the entire British army that were present at the engagement. American casualties were far less severe, totaling an estimated at 450 killed and wounded. The British, however, were able to take the ground and push the newly formed [[Continental Army]] back to the city of Boston, which also soon fell to British forces. Before the Battle of Bunker Hill, the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]] in April, 1775, saw British troops begin their assault into the American colonies. British troops were searching for colonist supply depots, however, were met by heavy resistance and the British forces were turned around at Concord by outnumbering [[Minutemen]] forces. On July 4, 1776 the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] was signed by the [[Second Continental Congress]] and officially declared the colonies of [[North America]] to be a sovereign nation, free from England’s rule. Also, the Congress permitted funding for a Continental Army, which is the first instance of an American political body handling military affairs. The British were dominating in the beginning of the war, holding off Continental regulars and militia and gaining vast amounts of territory throughout North America. However, the tide began to turn for the colonists in 1777 with their first major victory over British forces at the [[Battle of Saratoga]]. Victory for the rest of the war pushed back and forth between the British and colonists, but the alliance with [[France]] in 1778 by the American colonists leveled the playing field and aided in the final push for the defeat of the British Army and Navy. In 1781, American and French forces were able to trap the escaping southern British Army at Yorktown, thus ending the major fighting of the Revolution. The Treaty of Paris was signed in 1783, and recognized the American colonies as an independent nation. The newly formed United States would undergo numerous transitions to becoming one of the top economic and military powers in the world.

==Treaties and agreements==
[[File:East India House THS 1817 edited.jpg|thumb|left|275px| The expanded [[East India House]], Leadenhall Street, London, as rebuilt 1799–1800, [[Richard Jupp]], architect (as seen c. 1817; demolished in 1929)]]
Much of the trading during the proto-globalization time period was regulated by Europe. Globalization from an economic standpoint relied on the East India Company. The East India Company was a number of enterprises formed in western Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries, initially created to further trade in the East Indies. The company controlled trading from India to East and Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/176643/East-India-Company|title=East India Company|year=2009|accessdate=2009-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the key contributors to globalization was the ''[[Triangular Trade]]'' and how it connected the world. The Triangular Trade or Triangle Trade was a system used to connect three areas of the world through trade.&lt;ref name="Slaves"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africanculturalcenter.org/4_5slavery.html|title=Slaves|year=2001|accessdate=2009-11-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091124031612/http://www.africanculturalcenter.org/4_5slavery.html|archivedate=2009-11-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once traded, items and goods were shipped to other parts of the world, making the triangle trade a key to global trade. The Triangle Trade system was run by Europeans, increasing their global power.&lt;ref name="Slaves"/&gt;

Europeans would sail to the West African coast and trade African kings manufactured goods (rifles and ammunition) for [[slave]].&lt;ref name="Slaves"/&gt; From there slaves would be sent to the [[West Indies]] or the east coast of North America to be used for labor. Goods such as cotton, [[molasses]], [[sugar]], [[tobacco]] would be sent from these places back to Europe.&lt;ref name="Slaves"/&gt; Europe would also use their goods and trade with Asian countries for [[tea]], [[cloth]] and [[spices]].&lt;ref name="Slaves"/&gt; The triangle trade in a sense was an agreement for established trade routes, that led to greater global integration, which ultimately contributed to globalization.&lt;ref name="Petersson, Globalization PP. 50"/&gt;

Along with the control Europe gained, as far as global trade, came several treaties and laws. In 1773, the [[Regulating Act]] was passed, regulating affairs of the company in India and London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/496238/Regulating-Act|title=Regulating Act 2009|accessdate=2009-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1748, the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]] ended the [[War of the Austrian Succession]], but failed to settle the commercial struggle between England and France in the West Indies, Africa and India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/11186/Treaty-of-Aix-la-Chapelle|title=Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|year=2009|accessdate=2009-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The treaty was an attempt at regulating trade and market expansion between the two regions, but was ultimately unsuccessful.

Globalization at this time was hindered by war, diseases and population growth in certain areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voxeu.org/index.php?q=node/1145|title=Why globalisation might have started in the eighteenth century|date=May 16, 2008|accessdate=2009-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Corn Laws]] were established to regulate imports and exports of grains in England, thus restricting trade and the expansion of globalization.&lt;ref name = "Corn Law"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lusztig|1995|pp=394–396}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Corn Crop Laws hindered the market economy and globalization based on tariffs and import restrictions.&lt;ref name = "Corn Law"/&gt; Eventually, the Ricardian theory of economics became prominent and allowed for improved trade regulations, specifically with Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/291349/international-trade/61686/Simplified-theory-of-comparative-advantage|title=International Trade|year=2009|accessdate=2009-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Sebastian Conrad, proto-globalization is marked with a “rise of national chauvinism, racism, [[Social Darwinism]], and genocidal thinking” which came to be with relations to the “establishment of a world economy”.&lt;ref name="Sebastian Conrad PP. 4"&gt;{{Harvnb|Conrad|2007|p=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Beginning in the 1870s, the [[global trade]] cycle started to cement itself so that more nations' economies depended on one another than in any previous era. Domino effects in this new world trade cycle lead to both worldwide recessions and world economic booms.&lt;ref name="Sebastian Conrad PP. 4"/&gt; Modelski describes the late period of proto-globalization as a "thick range of global networks extending throughout the world at high speed and covering all components of society".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Modelski|Devezas|Thompson|2008|p=12}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1750s, Europe, Africa, Asia, and America's contact had grown into a stable multilateral interdependency which was echoed in the [[modern globalization]] period.&lt;ref name="Petersson, Globalization PP. 28"&gt;{{Harvnb|Osterhammel|Petersson|2005|p=28}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shift in capital===
Although the North Atlantic World dominated the global system before proto-globalization, a more "multipolar global economy" started taking form around the early 19th century, and capital was becoming highly mobile.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Conrad|2007|p=5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 19th century, British capital wealth was 17% overseas,&lt;ref name="Kevin O'Rourke PP. 208"&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Rourke|Williamson|1999|p=208}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the level of capital invested overseas nearly doubled by 1913 to 33%.&lt;ref name="Kevin O'Rourke PP. 208"/&gt; Germany invested one-fifth of their total domestic savings in 1880, and, like Britain, increased their wealth tremendously in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="Kevin O'Rourke PP. 208"/&gt; The net foreign investment of total domestic savings abroad was 35% in 1860, 47% in 1880, and 53% in the years prior to the [[Great War]].&lt;ref name="Kevin O'Rourke PP. 208"/&gt; Global investments were taking a steady rise throughout societies, and those able to invest thrust more and more of their domestic savings into international investments.

The ability to mobilize capital was due to the development of the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the beginnings of [[mechanical production]] (most prominent in Great Britain).&lt;ref name="Bayly 2004 PP.49"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bayly|2004|p=49}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During proto-globalization, "merchant capitalists in many societies quickly became aware of potential markets and new producers and began to link them together in new patterns of world trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bayly|2004|p=53}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The expansion of the slave production and the exploitation of the Americas put Europeans on the top of the economic network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bayly|2004|pp=53–55}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During the modern globalization period, mass production allowed the development of a stronger, more complex global network of trade. Another element of European success between 1750 and 1850 was the limitation and "relative 'failure'" of the Afro-Asian Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bayly|2004|p=56}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The movement into modern globalization was marked with the economic drain of capital into Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bayly|2004|p=57}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shift in culture===
Like capital, the end of proto-globalization was filled with mobility of individuals. The time of proto-globalization was one filled with “mutual influence, hybridization, and cross-cultural entanglement”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Conrad|2007|p=6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Many historians blame this web of national entanglements and agreements as the cause for the intensity and vast involvement during [[World War I]]. Between 1750-1880, the expansion of worldwide integration was influenced by the new capacities in production, transportation, and communication.&lt;ref name="Petersson, Globalization PP. 28"/&gt;
The end of proto-globalization also marked the final phase of "[[great domestication]]".&lt;ref name="Bayly 2004 PP.49"/&gt; After the 1650s, the process of regular and intensive agrarian exploitation was complete.&lt;ref name="Bayly 2004 PP.49"/&gt; Human population began to increase almost exponentially with the end of the [[great pandemic]]s.&lt;ref name="Bayly 2004 PP.49"/&gt; At the end of the proto-globalization and the cusp of modern globalization, population began to "recover in Central and South America," where at the beginning of proto-globalization, European-imported illnesses had savagely decreased indigenous populations.&lt;ref name="Bayly 2004 PP.49"/&gt; The importation of nutritious varieties from Central and South America created a more fertile and resilient population to forge ahead into modern globalization.&lt;ref name="Bayly 2004 PP.49"/&gt; The greater population pushed individuals in high populated areas to "spill into less populous forested and grazing lands, and bring them under cultivation".&lt;ref name="Bayly 2004 PP.49"/&gt; This development lead to an influx in produce production and exported trade.

Notice the amount of details.]]Another development that lead to the shift to modern globalization was the development of a more politicized system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Osterhammel|Petersson|2005|p=208}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Proto-globalization period marked a steady expansion of larger states from the Indonesian islands to northern Scandinava.&lt;ref name="Bayly 2004 PP.50"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bayly|2004|p=50}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The settlement of these individuals made it easier for governments to tax, develop an army, labor force, and create a sustainable economy.&lt;ref name="Bayly 2004 PP.50"/&gt; The development and streamlining of these cultural aspects lead to an increase in peripheral players in the game of globalization.&lt;ref name="Bayly 2004 PP.50"/&gt; The stable legal institutions developed in the late proto-globalization and early modern globalization period established economic advances, intellectual property rights (more predominantly in England), general geographical stability, and generational societal improvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bayly|2004|p=61}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
The shift in exchange of technological advancements was another reason for modern globalization. In the early 19th century, European civilizations traveled the world to accumulate an "impressive knowledge about languages, religions, customs, and political orders of other countries.&lt;ref name="Petersson, Globalization PP. 52"&gt;{{Harvnb|Osterhammel|Petersson|2005|p=52}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 19th century, Europe was no longer receiving any significant technological innovations from Asia.&lt;ref name="Petersson, Globalization PP. 52"/&gt;

===Shift in global networks===
The developed global networks lead to the creation of new networks leading to new production.&lt;ref name="Modelski, Devezas, Thompson 2008 PP.29"&gt;{{Harvnb|Modelski|Devezas|Thompson|2008|p=248}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1880, there was a renewed thrust of European colonial expansion.&lt;ref name="Petersson, Globalization, PP. 16"&gt;{{Harvnb|Osterhammel|Petersson|2005|p=16}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The shift to modern globalization was slow, overlapping and interacting. Mid-19th century, noncompeting goods were exchanged between continents and markets for widely used commodities developed.&lt;ref name="Petersson, Globalization, PP. 16"/&gt; Also, labor was becoming globally integrated.&lt;ref name="Petersson, Globalization, PP. 16"/&gt; Modern globalization came to be as the movement of general expansion of socio-economic networks became more elaborate. An example of this is the development and establishment of [[free masonry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harland-Jacobs|2007|p=24}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The "existing trading networks grew, capital and commodity flows intensified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harland-Jacobs|2007|p=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The permanence of long-term interdependencies was unchanged.&lt;ref name="Modelski, Devezas, Thompson 2008 PP.29"/&gt; By the beginning of the modern globalization period, the European colonial expansion retreats into itself. National societies began to regret the economic integration and attempted to limit the effects.&lt;ref name="Osterhammel, Jurgen 2005 PP. 29"&gt;{{Harvnb|Osterhammel|Petersson|2005|p=29}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Bayly, Hopkins and others stress that proto-globalization's transformation into modern globalization was a complex process that took place at different times in different regions,and involved the hold-over of older notions of value and rarity which had their origins in the pre-modern period. Thus leading to the age of economic [[deglobalization]] and world wars which ended after 1945.&lt;ref name="Osterhammel, Jurgen 2005 PP. 29"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2933">'''Religious views on capitalism''' have been philosophically diverse, with numerous religious philosophers defending the natural [[right to property]] while simultaneously expressing criticism at the negative social effects of materialism and greed.  

==Christian views==

===''The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism''===
''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'' influenced large numbers of people (particularly [[Calvinism|Calvinist]]) to engage in work in the secular world, developing their own [[Organization|enterprise]]s and engaging in [[trade]] and the accumulation of [[wealth]] for investment.

===Christian socialism===
The first [[Socialism|socialists]] drew many of their principles from [[Christianity|Christian]] values (see [[Christian socialism]]) against the [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] values of profiteering, greed, selfishness and hoarding. [[Liberation theology]] is a school of theology within Christianity, particularly in the [[Catholic Church]]. It emphasizes the Christian mission to bring justice to the poor and oppressed, particularly through political activism. Its theologians consider sin the root source of poverty, the sin in question being exploitative capitalism and class war by the rich against the poor. In the United States,  the [[Social Gospel]] was pursued in response to increased ideas of capitalist ideas and [[social Darwinism]], calling on protections of people against perceived threats from industrialization.

==Muslim views==
{{See also|Islamic socialism}}

===Legislation against riba===
Usury or [[riba]] is prohibited and religious law encourages the use of capital to spur economic activity while placing the burden of risk along with the benefit of profit with the owner of the capital. A 2.5% alms tax (''[[zakat]]'') is levied on all gold, crops and cattle.

===Opposition in Egypt and Iran===
[[Sayyid Qutb]] denounced [[capitalism]] in ''[[The Battle Between Islam and Capitalism]]'', published in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nndb.com/people/551/000113212/ Sayyid Qutb&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt; The Islamic constitution of Iran which was drafted by mostly Islamic clerics (see the [[Assembly of Experts]]) dispraises the "materialist schools of thought" that encourage "concentration and accumulation of wealth and maximization of profit".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.servat.unibe.ch/law/icl/ir00000_.html ICL - Iran - Constitution&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Malcolm X]] was also critical of capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;''From Civil Rights to Black Liberation: Malcolm X and the Organization of Afro-American Unity'', William W. Sales, [[South End Press]], 1994, {{ISBN|0-89608-480-9}}, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert J. Zydenbos''' (born 1957, [[Toronto]]){{r|cv}} is a [[Dutch people|Dutch]]-[[Canada|Canadian]] scholar who has doctorate degrees in [[India]]n philosophy and [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] studies. He also has a doctorate of literature from the [[University of Utrecht]] in the [[Netherlands]]. Zydenbos also studied Indian religions and languages at the South Asia Institute and at the [[University of Heidelberg]] in [[Germany]]. He taught [[Sanskrit]] at the University of Heidelberg and later taught Jaina philosophy at the [[University of Madras]] in [[India]]. Zydenbos later taught Sanskrit, [[Buddhism]], and South Asian religions at the [[University of Toronto]] in [[Canada]]. He was the first western scholar to write a doctoral thesis on contemporary Kannada fiction.

R. Zydenbos is a strong opponent to some writers, like [[Koenraad Elst]] or N. S. Rajaram, about the controversies pertaining to the [[Indo-Aryan migration|Aryan Invasion Theory]], which Zydenbos sees as driven by political motives. Zydenbos wrote review articles in the ''Journal of the American Oriental Society''. Moreover, he has written the first comprehensive Western history of Kannada literature and translated Kannada literature into both [[German language|German]] and [[English language|English]]. He also translated Dvaitin, Virasaiva, and Jaina writings from Sanskrit. He has lived in [[Mysore]], India for 17 years.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

'''Sivrihisar Grand Mosque''' ({{lang-tr|Sivrihisar Ulu Camii}}) is a historical mosque in [[Sivrihisar]], [[Turkey]].

The mosque is located in Sivrihisar [[ilçe]] (district) of [[Eskişehir Province]]. It was built by Leşker Emir Celaleddin Ali in 1231–1232 during the reign of [[Sultanate of Rum|Anatolian Seljuk Sultan]] [[Kayqubad I]] (r. 1220–1237). It saw later two restorations, in 1275 by Eminüddin Mikail bin Abdullah, the [[regent]] of [[Kaykhusraw III]] (r. 1265–1284), and in 1440 by Hızır Bey, a judge in Sivrihisar and later the first judge in [[Istanbul]].&lt;ref name=K1/&gt; The mosque is a rare example of wooden-columned architectural technique in Anatolia together with four others.&lt;ref name=Un/&gt;&lt;ref name="ys1"/&gt;

The ground area of the mosque is {{cvt|1485|m2}}.&lt;ref name=K1/&gt; It has a rectangular plan. The outer walls are of [[ashlar]]. It has four entrances.&lt;ref name=Un/&gt; Marble inscriptions showing the historical restoration dates are found on the northern and eastern gates.&lt;ref name="ys1"/&gt; The roof is covered by tiles, which were replaced by lead sheet not long ago.&lt;ref name="ys1"/&gt; The roof is carried by 67 wooden columns in the inside,&lt;ref name=Un/&gt;&lt;ref name=K1/&gt; of which upper parts are decorated by painted mostly in green, red and black colors engravings of traditional figures. Some columns stand on stone base having ancient column head. It is likely that the stone columns heads originate from [[Pessinus]], an ancient city known as [[Ballıhisar]] today close to Sivrihisar. There are six naves in east-west direction. The middle naves are higher than the others resembling the historic [[Yurt|Turkic tent]]s used in the [[Nomadic empire|nomadic era the Central Asia]]. The mosque's [[minbar]], the [[pulpit]], is a masterwork made by Horasanlı İbni Mehmet in 1245, and is famous for its ornaments in geometrical and floral design engraved in walnut wood.&lt;ref name=Un/&gt;&lt;ref name=K1/&gt; It is believed that the minbar was broght here from the Sivrihisar Kılıç Masjid, which was demolished in 1924.&lt;ref name="ys1"/&gt; The [[minaret]] was added by Osman oğlu Hacı Habib in 1409–1410 according to its inscription.&lt;ref name=K1/&gt;&lt;ref name="ys1"/&gt;

The '''''Tabernacle of the Linaioli''''' (Italian: ''Tabernacolo dei Linaioli'', literally "Tabernacle of the Linen manufacturers") is a marble [[aedicula]] designed by [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]], with paintings by [[Fra Angelico]], dating to 1432-1433. It is housed in the National Museum of [[San Marco, Florence]], central [[Italy]].

==History==
The tabernacle was commissioned for the exterior of the seat of the Linaioli (the guild of linen workers in Florence), in the former Old Market, in the October 1432. The marble parts were executed by Simone di Nanni da Fiesole, under design by Lorenzo Ghiberti. The contract for the internal paintings was signed by Angelico on 2 July 1433, for a total of 190 golden [[florin (Italian coin)|florins]]. The [[predella]] is generally dated to 1433-1435.
[[File:Angelico, linaioli tabernacle 01.jpg|left|thumb|240px|The closed tabernacle.]]
The work was a large one, comparable only to [[Cimabue]]'s [[Santa Trinita Maestà]] or [[Duccio di Buoninsegna]]'s ''[[Rucellai Madonna]]''. It has been speculated that the marble frame was sized according to a pre-existing painting, which was later replaced by Fra Angelico's, or that the size was inspired by that of the statues in [[Orsanmichele]] niches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Medioevo|title=Il tabernacolo dei Linaioli|publisher=MyWay Media|language=Italian|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Work had been  moved to the Palazzo della Borsa as early as 1777, together with other works commissioned by the city's guilds. In that year it was transferred to the [[Uffizi Gallery|Uffizi]], whence it was transferred to the current location in 1924.

The tabernacle was restored in 2010.

==Description==
The tabernacle is composed of a rectangular marble frame, with a triangular top with a sculpted almond depicting the "Blessing Christ and Cherubims". In the center, within an arched opening, are Fra Angelico's panel of the ''[[Maestà]]'' with twelve musician angels. 

At the front are two shutter panels with further paintings of saints. These are, internally, St. John the Baptist (left) and St. John the Evangelist (right); and externally St. Mark the Evangelist (left) and St. Peter (right). The panels are completed by a  [[predella]], placed below, with three scenes of ''St. Peter Dictating the Gospel to St. Mark'', ''Adoration of the Magi'' and ''Martyrdom of St. Mark''. The figure of Mark is recurrent due to his status as the patron of the corporation which commissioned the work.

The central panel, although damaged, has a style similar to Angelico's early works, with a marble step over which is the throne. Behind two draperies (perhaps a hint to the guild's textile activities) is a ceiling painted in blue with stars and the Holy Spirit dove, which is similar to [[Masolino]]'s ''[[Annunciation (Masolino)|Annunciation]]'' in [[Washington, DC]].

"'''The Art of Donald McGill'''" is a critical essay first published in 1941 by the English author [[George Orwell]]. It discusses the genre of English saucy [[Seaside postcard#British seaside postcards|seaside postcard]]s that were sold mostly in small shops in British coastal towns, and particularly the work of its prime exponent, [[Donald McGill]]. Orwell notes the role of this type of humour as a rebellion against convention in society and states that, despite the vulgarity, he would be sorry to see the postcards vanish.

==Background==
Seaside postcards represent the low humour and wordplay that was characteristic of the Victorian [[music hall]]. They were sold by newsagents and at booths along the front at British seaside holiday resorts.

McGill created an estimated 12,000 of the colour washed drawings which were then reproduced as postcards and an estimated 200 million were printed and sold.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/today/reports/arts/postcard_censorship_20040714.shtml BBC Radio 4 Postcard Censorship]&lt;/ref&gt; His career began in 1904 when he was encouraged by a relation who saw an illustrated get-well card McGill had made for a sick nephew. Within a year it was his full-time occupation.&lt;ref name=Ind&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/sun-sea-and-censorship-551680.html The Independent Rhoda Koenig ''Sun, Sea and Censorship'' 1 July 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; McGill studied art and married the daughter of the owner of [[Greenwich Theatre|Crowder's Music Hall]] in [[Greenwich]]. Such postcards were associated with embarrassment and McGill noted that his two daughters "ran like stags whenever they passed a comic postcard shop".

Orwell's interest in such postcards began in his schooldays in [[Eastbourne]]. [[Jacintha Buddicom]] recalls him around the age of twelve at Shiplake and Henley when he kept a collection in an album. She recalls that some were kept in a manilla envelope because they were "too vulgar" to be put on display.&lt;ref&gt;Jacintha Buddicom ''Eric &amp; Us'' 1974 Leslie Frewin&lt;/ref&gt; In "[[Such, Such Were the Joys]]" Orwell reports his alarm at being stared at with suspicion by a man as he came out a [[newsagent's shop]] in Eastbourne, although he says in the essay that he was buying sweets.

==Publication==
"The Art of Donald McGill" was first published in ''[[Horizon (magazine)|Horizon]]'' in September 1941. The article has appeared in many anthologies including ''[[Critical Essays (Orwell)|Critical Essays]]'' (1946), ''Collected Essays'' (1961), ''[[Decline of the English Murder]] and Other Essays'' (1965) and ''The Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell'' (1968), republished by the Donald McGill Museum &amp; Archive Ryde (2010) with for the first time examples of the cards discussed accompanying the text.

==Summary==
Orwell identifies the overpowering vulgarity, the crude drawing and unbearable colours of the seaside postcard which specialises in very 'low' humour. He selects McGill because he sees his work as the most representative and perfect in the tradition, although he is ignorant of whether McGill is a real individual or just a corporate name.

Orwell picks out the main subjects of the postcards as sex, home life, drunkenness, [[Toilet humour|WC jokes]], snobbery within the working-class, stereotypical figures and topical politico-social fads. They feature illegitimacy, the mother-in-law, the hen-pecked husband, the middle-aged drunk, chamber pots, the nervous clergyman who says the wrong thing, [[malapropism]]s and "an endless succession of fat women in tight bathing-dresses." He concludes that this reflects, on a comic level, the working-class outlook that youth and adventure, and even individual life, end with marriage.

Orwell considers that in England under censorship laws there is a wide gap between what can be said and what can be printed. He sees comic post cards as the only medium in which really "low" humour is printable although similar jokes are part and parcel of the revue and music-hall, and can be heard on the radio.

Orwell presents a thesis of duality in human nature which he calls the [[Don Quixote]]–[[Sancho Panza]] combination—the conflict between high-minded respectability and vulgar buffoonery. "Society has always to demand a little more from human beings than it will get in practice—that they should work hard, pay their taxes, and be faithful to their wives, men should think it glorious to die on the battlefield and women should want wear themselves out with child-bearing. The postcards represent the worm's-eye view of life where "marriage is a dirty joke or a comic disaster... where the lawyer is always a crook and the Scotsman always a miser, where the newly-weds make fools of themselves on the hideous beds of seaside lodging-houses and the drunken, red-nosed husbands roll home at four in the morning to meet the linen-nightgowned wives who wait for them behind the front door, poker in hand". Orwell brings in a quotation from [[Ecclesiastes]] (vii 15).

Such postcards are therefore symptomatically important as a sort of [[saturnalia]], a harmless rebellion against virtue. Orwell notes that the mood of the comic post card could appear between the murders in Shakespeare's tragedies&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''Macbeth'', Act 2, scene 1&lt;/ref&gt; but that this type of humour in literature had been repressed from the beginning of the 19th century and has dwindled to these "ill-drawn post cards, leading a barely legal existence in cheap stationers' windows".

In 1954, under a government crackdown on declining morals, McGill was prosecuted and fined under the [[Obscene Publications Act 1857]].&lt;ref&gt;"The World of Donald McGill" Buckland,E: London, Blandford, 1990 {{ISBN|0-7137-1400-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This almost wiped out the industry. In 1957 he gave evidence to a House of Commons Select Committee which was revising the legislation.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

In the light of an exhibition of the work of McGill in 2004, various critics have challenged Orwell's dismissive view of the quality of the art.&lt;ref name=Ind/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialaffairsunit.org.uk/blog/archives/000824.php The Social Affairs Unit – Christie Davies "Donald McGill was a far better artist than Orwell acknowledges"]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Sunset Limited''''' is a 2011 [[television film]] directed by and starring [[Tommy Lee Jones]]. The film co-stars [[Samuel L. Jackson]]. It was the duo's second collaboration, after the 2000 film ''[[Rules of Engagement (film)|Rules of Engagement]]''. The film was based on the [[The Sunset Limited|play of the same name]] by [[Cormac McCarthy]].
 
==Plot==
Black and White converse about White's attempted suicide. White feels as though everything ends up in death, and that his life is minuscule in the throes of time.

From White's point of view, no matter how great someone or something is, all that is created eventually fades away. This is the opposite of what Black believes. He believes that there is a God and that we all must go through the troubles of life to get to paradise (Heaven). By his own account, his story is that of a man who has committed murder and was far away from God, but has now changed.

Black feels that he can persuade White from committing suicide. With Black stopping White right before he was about to kill himself, Black feels that this is destiny. In the end, Black is not able to persuade White from suicide; he lets him leave the apartment. When White leaves, Black is left pondering why God would put him in a position to save this man's life knowing that there is nothing that he can do to stop White from going through with the suicide.

==Cast==
* [[Samuel L. Jackson]] as Black 
* [[Tommy Lee Jones]] as White

==Reception==
The film received generally favorable reviews. The film holds a 67-out-of-100 score at the review aggregator website [[Metacritic]], based on 15 reviews. Among those who praised the film are Verne Gay of ''[[Newsday]]'', who called it "grim, but a chance to see two magnificent actors at the peak of their powers."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-sunset-limited "The Sunset Limited: Season 1"]. [[Metacritc]]. Retrieved November 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; It currently holds no rating at the review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], but the one review currently counted is by Mike Scott of ''[[The Times-Picayune]]'', who called the film "A thinking man's drama that rolls deep, heavy thoughts around and around, trying to puzzle out where the truth lies. Or, indeed, if what we see as the truth is just that: a lie."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_sunset_limited/ ''The Sunset Limited'' (2011)]. [[Rotten Tomatoes]].

'''United Tribal Nationalist Liberation Front''', a regional [[political party]] in [[Assam]], [[India]]. UTNLF was launched by the PTCA (Progressive) (splinter group of [[Plain Tribals Council of Assam]]) in 1984. UTNLF demands statehood for the [[Bodo people|Bodo]] areas.

The UTNLF led a violent campaign during the 1990s against both the [[Assamese people|Assamese]] and the Indian military units in the area.

The '''Venus figurines of Mal’ta''' (also: Malta) are several [[palaeolithic]] figurines of women found in [[Siberia]], [[Russia]].

They consist most often of ivory. Delporte writes of 29 figurines altogether.&lt;ref&gt;See Delporte (1979), p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; They are about 20,000 years old and stem from the [[Gravettian]].&lt;ref&gt;See Cohen (2003), p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these statuettes show stylized clothes. Quite often the face is depicted. They were discovered at [[Mal'ta]], at the [[Angara River]], near [[Lake Baikal]] in [[Irkutsk Oblast]], Siberia by the archeologists [[:ru:Замятнин, Сергей Николаевич|Sergey Zamyatnin]], [[:ru:Сосновский, Георгий Петрович|Georgy Sosnovsky]], and [[Mikhail Mikhaylovich Gerasimov|Mikhail Gerasimov]].&lt;ref&gt;See. Delporte (1979), p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

These figurines are on display at the [[Hermitage Museum]], [[Saint Petersburg]].

==Discovery==
Around 30 female statuettes of varying shapes were discovered at [[Mal'ta]], at the [[Angara River]], and near [[Lake Baikal]] in [[Irkutsk Oblast]] in Siberia. The wide variety of forms, combined with the realism of the sculptures and the lack of repetitiveness in detail, are definite signs of developed, albeit early, art.

Until the Mal’ta find, [[Venus figurines]] were previously found only in [[Europe]]. Carved from the tusk ivory of a [[mammoth]], these images were typically highly stylized and often involved embellished and disproportionate characteristics (typically the breasts or buttocks).

==Features==
At first glance what is obvious is that the Mal'ta Venus figurines are of two types: full-figured women with exaggerated forms, and women with a thin, delicate form. Some of the figures are nude while others have etchings that seem to indicate fur or clothing.  Conversely, unlike those found in Europe, some of the Venus figurines from Mal’ta were sculpted with faces. Most of the figurines were tapered at the bottom, and it is believed that this was done so they could have been stuck into the ground or placed upright some other way.  Placed upright they could have symbolized the spirits of the dead, akin to "spirit dolls" used nearly world-wide, including Siberia, among contemporary people.

==Style==
The suggested similarity between Mal'ta and Upper Paleolithic civilizations of Western and Eastern Europe coincides with a long-held belief that the ancient people of Mal'ta were related to the Paleolithic societies of Europe. These similarities can be established by their tools, dwelling structures, and art. These commonalities draw into question the origin of Upper Paleolithic Siberian people, and whether the migrating peoples originated from Southeastern Asia or quite possibly from Europe. On the other hand, one can argue that as a group the Mal'ta Venus figures are rather different from the female figurines of Western and Central Europe.  For example, none of the Siberian specimens indicates abdominal enlargement as main European examples do, and as breasts are often lacking, few offer clear enough evidence of gender to define them as female. More conclusively, nearly half of them show some facial details, something which is lacking on the so-called Venus figures of Europe.

'''Wernicke's area''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|v|ɛər|n|ᵻ|k|ə}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|v|ɛər|n|ᵻ|k|i}}; {{IPA-de|ˈvɛʁnɪkə|lang}}), also called '''Wernicke's speech area''', is one of the two parts of the [[cerebral cortex]] that are linked to speech (the other is [[Broca's area]]). It is involved in the comprehension or understanding of written and spoken language (in contrast to Broca's area that is involved in the production of language). It is traditionally thought to be in [[Brodmann area 22]], which is located in the superior temporal lobe in the dominant cerebral hemisphere (which is the left hemisphere in about 95% of right handed individuals and 60% of left handed individuals). Damage caused to Wernicke's area results in receptive, [[Wernicke's aphasia|fluent aphasia]]. This means that the person with aphasia will be able to fluently connect words, but the phrases will lack meaning. This is unlike [[Broca's aphasia|non-fluent aphasia]], in which the person will use meaningful words, but in a non-fluent, [[Telegraphic speech|telegraphic manner]].&lt;ref name="urlAphasia: Signs &amp; Symptoms"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.asha.org/PRPSpecificTopic.aspx?folderid=8589934663&amp;section=Signs_and_Symptoms | title = Aphasia: Signs &amp; Symptoms | format = | work = | publisher = American Speech-Language-Hearing Association }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
Wernicke's area is classically located in the posterior section of the [[superior temporal gyrus]] (STG) in the (most commonly) left cerebral hemisphere. This area encircles the [[auditory cortex]] on the [[lateral sulcus]] (the part of the [[human brain|brain]] where the [[temporal lobe]] and [[parietal lobe]] meet).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kennison |first=Shelia |year=2013 |title=Introduction to language development |location=Los Angeles |publisher=Sage.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This area is neuroanatomically described as the posterior part of [[Brodmann area]] [[Brodmann area 22|22]].

However, there is an absence of consistent definitions as to the location.&lt;ref name="Bogen"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bogen JE, Bogen GM | title = Wernicke's region—Where is it? | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 280 | pages = 834–43 | year = 1976 | pmid = 1070943 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1976.tb25546.x | url = http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=0077-8923&amp;date=1976&amp;volume=280&amp;spage=834 | bibcode = 1976NYASA.280..834B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nakai_2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Jeong|first2=JW|last3=Brown|first3=EC|last4=Rothermel|first4=R|last5=Kojima|first5=K|last6=Kambara|first6=T|last7=Shah|first7=A|last8=Mittal|first8=S|last9=Sood|first9=S|last10=Asano|first10=E|year=2017|title=Three- and four-dimensional mapping of speech and language in patients with epilepsy|journal=Brain|volume=140|pages=1351–1370|doi=10.1093/brain/awx051|pmid=28334963|last1=Nakai|first1=Y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some identify it with the unimodal auditory association in the superior temporal gyrus anterior to the primary auditory cortex (the anterior part of [[Brodmann area 22|BA 22]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Démonet JF, Chollet F, Ramsay S, Cardebat D, Nespoulous JL, Wise R, Rascol A, Frackowiak R | title = The anatomy of phonological and semantic processing in normal subjects | journal = Brain | volume = 115 | issue = Pt 6 | pages = 1753–68 | date = December 1992 | pmid = 1486459 | doi = 10.1093/brain/115.6.1753 | url = http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=1486459 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the site most consistently implicated in auditory word recognition by functional brain imaging experiments.&lt;ref name="DeWitt Rauschecker 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=DeWitt I, Rauschecker JP | title = Phoneme and word recognition in the auditory ventral stream | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 109 | issue = 8 | pages = E505–E514 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22308358 | pmc = 3286918 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1113427109 | bibcode = 2012PNAS..109E.505D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DeWitt Rauschecker 2013"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=DeWitt I, Rauschecker JP | title = Wernicke's area revisited: parallel streams and word processing | journal = Brain Lang | volume = 127 | issue = 2 | pages = 181–91 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24404576 | pmc = 4098851 | doi = 10.1016/j.bandl.2013.09.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others include also adjacent parts of the heteromodal cortex in [[Brodmann area 39|BA 39]] and [[Brodmann area 40|BA40]] in the  [[parietal lobe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mesulam MM | title = From sensation to cognition | journal = Brain | volume = 121 | issue = Pt 6 | pages = 1013–52 | date = June 1998 | pmid = 9648540 | doi = 10.1093/brain/121.6.1013 | url = http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/121/6/1013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While previously thought to connect Wernicke's area and [[Broca's area]], new research demonstrates that the [[arcuate fasciculus]] instead connects to posterior receptive areas with premotor/motor areas, and not to Broca's area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bernal B, Ardila A | title = The role of the arcuate fasciculus in conduction aphasia | journal = Brain | volume = 132 | issue = Pt 9 | pages = 2309–16 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19690094 | doi = 10.1093/brain/awp206 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consistent with the word recognition site identified in brain imaging, the [[uncinate fasciculus]] connects anterior superior temporal regions with [[Broca's area]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Saur D, Kreher BW, Schnell S, Kümmerer D, Kellmeyer P, Vry MS, Umarova R, Musso M, Glauche V, Abel S, Huber W, Rijntjes M, Hennig J, Weiller C | title = Ventral and dorsal pathways for language | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 105 | issue = 46 | pages = 18035–18040 | date = November 2008 | pmid = 19004769 | pmc = 2584675 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0805234105  | bibcode = 2008PNAS..10518035S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==

===Right homologous area===

Research using [[Transcranial magnetic stimulation]] suggests that the area corresponding to the Wernicke’s area in the non-dominant cerebral hemisphere has a role in processing and resolution of subordinate meanings of ambiguous words—such as ‘‘river’’ when given the ambiguous word "bank."  In contrast, the Wernicke's area in the dominant hemisphere processes dominant word meanings (‘‘teller’’ given ‘‘bank’’).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Harpaz Y, Levkovitz Y, Lavidor M | title = Lexical ambiguity resolution in Wernicke's area and its right homologue | journal = Cortex | volume = 45 | issue = 9 | pages = 1097–103 | date = October 2009 | pmid = 19251255 | doi = 10.1016/j.cortex.2009.01.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern views===
[[Neuroimaging]] suggests the functions earlier attributed to Wernicke's area occur more broadly in the [[temporal lobe]] and indeed happen also in Broca's area.

{{cquote|There are some suggestions that middle and inferior temporal gyri and basal temporal cortex reflect lexical processing ... there is consensus that the STG from rostral to caudal fields and the [[superior temporal sulcus|STS]] constitute the neural tissue in which many of the critical computations for speech recognition are executed ... aspects of Broca’s area (Brodmann areas 44 and 45) are also regularly implicated in speech processing.

... the range of areas implicated in speech processing go well beyond the classical language areas typically mentioned for speech; the vast majority of textbooks still state that this aspect of perception and language processing occurs in Wernicke’s area (the posterior third of the STG).&lt;ref name="Poeppel08"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Poeppel D, Idsardi WJ, van Wassenhove V | title = Speech perception at the interface of neurobiology and linguistics | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B | volume = 363 | issue = 1493 | pages = 1071–86 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 17890189 | pmc = 2606797 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2007.2160 | url = http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=17890189 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Support for a broad range of speech processing areas was furthered by a recent study done at University of Rochester in which American Sign Language native speakers were subject to MRIs while interpreting sentences that identified a relationship using either syntax (relationship is determined by the word order) or inflection (relationship is determined by physical motion of "moving hands through space or signing on one side of the body").  Distinct areas of the brain were activated with the frontal cortex (associated with ability to put information into sequences) being more active in the syntax condition and the temporal lobes (associated with dividing information into its constituent parts) being more active in the inflection condition.  However, these areas are not mutually exclusive and show a large amount of overlap.  These findings imply that while speech processing is a very complex process, the brain may be using fairly basic, preexisting computational methods.&lt;ref name="Newman2010"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Newman AJ, Supalla T, Hauser P, Newport EL, Bavelier D | title = Dissociating neural subsystems for grammar by contrasting word order and inflection | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 107 | issue = 16 | pages = 7539–44 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20368422 | pmc = 2867749 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1003174107 | bibcode = 2010PNAS..107.7539N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aphasia===

Wernicke's area is named after [[Carl Wernicke]], a [[Germany|German]] [[neurologist]] and [[psychiatrist]] who, in 1874, hypothesized a link between the left posterior section of the superior temporal gyrus and the reflexive mimicking of words and their syllables that associated the sensory and motor images of spoken words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Wernicke K. |chapter=The aphasia symptom-complex: A psychological study on an anatomical basis (1875) |editor=Paul Eling |title=Reader in the History of Aphasia: From '''sasi'''(Franz Gall to) |publisher=John Benjamins Pub Co |location=Amsterdam |year=1995 |pages=69–89 |isbn=90-272-1893-5 |volume=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He did this on the basis of the location of [[Acquired brain injury|brain injuries]] that caused [[aphasia]]. [[Receptive aphasia]] in which such abilities are preserved is also known as '''Wernicke's aphasia'''. In this condition there is a major impairment of language comprehension, while speech retains a natural-sounding rhythm and a relatively normal [[syntax]]. Language as a result is largely meaningless (a condition sometimes called ''fluent'' or ''[[jargon aphasia]]'').

While neuroimaging and lesion evidence generally support the idea that malfunction of or damage to Wernicke's area is common in people with receptive aphasia, this is not always so. Some people may use the right hemisphere for language, and isolated damage of Wernicke's area cortex (sparing white matter and other areas) may not cause severe receptive aphasia.&lt;ref name="Bogen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Dronkers  NF. |author2=Redfern B B. |author3=Knight R T. |chapter=The neural architecture of language disorders |editor1=Bizzi, Emilio |editor2=Gazzaniga, Michael S. |title=The New cognitive neurosciences |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=2000 |pages=949–58 |isbn=0-262-07195-9 |edition=2nd }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even when patients with Wernicke's area lesions have comprehension deficits, these are usually not restricted to [[language processing in the brain|language processing]] alone. For example, one study found that patients with posterior lesions also had trouble understanding nonverbal sounds like animal and machine noises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Saygin AP, Dick F, Wilson SM, Dronkers NF, Bates E | title = Neural resources for processing language and environmental sounds: evidence from aphasia | journal = Brain | volume = 126 | issue = Pt 4 | pages = 928–45 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12615649 | doi = 10.1093/brain/awg082 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, for Wernicke's area, the impairments in nonverbal sounds were statistically stronger than for verbal sounds.
