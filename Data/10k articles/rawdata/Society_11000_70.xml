      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="71692">'''Adolescent sexuality''' is a stage of [[Human development (biology)|human development]] in which [[adolescence|adolescents]] experience and explore sexual feelings. Interest in sexuality intensifies during the onset of [[puberty]], and sexuality is often a vital aspect of teenagers' lives.&lt;ref name="sex lives2"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Sex Lives of Teenagers |last=Ponton |first=Lynn |year=2000 |isbn=0-452-28260-8 |publisher=Dutton |location=New York |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In humans, [[sexual interest]] may be expressed in a number of ways, such as [[flirting]], [[kissing]], [[masturbation]], or having sex with a partner. Sexual interest among adolescents, as among adults, can vary greatly, and is influenced by cultural [[Norm (sociology)|norms]] and [[mores]], [[sex education]], as well as [[Comprehensive sex education|comprehensive sexuality education]] provided, [[sexual orientation]], and [[social control]]s such as [[age of consent]] laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002607/260770e.pdf|title=International technical guidance on sexuality education: An evidence-informed approach|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=978-92-3-100259-5|location=Paris|pages= |deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180111072955/http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002607/260770e.pdf|archivedate=2018-01-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual activity in general is associated with various risks. The risks of sexual intercourse include [[unwanted pregnancy]] and contracting a [[sexually transmitted infection]] such as [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]], which can be reduced with availability and use of a [[condom]] or adopting other [[safe sex]] practices. [[Contraceptives]] specifically reduce the chance of pregnancy.

The risks are higher for young adolescents because their brains are not neurally mature. Several brain regions in the [[frontal lobe]] of the [[cerebral cortex]] and in the [[hypothalamus]] that are deemed important for self-control, delayed gratification, risk analysis, and appreciation are not fully mature. The brain is not fully mature until age 25.&lt;ref name="Casey, B. J. 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Casey B.

==Development of sexuality==
Adolescent sexuality begins at puberty. The sexual maturation process produces sexual interest and stimulates thought processes. Subsequent sexual behavior starts with the secretion of hormones from the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary gland. These hormones target the sexual organs and begin their maturation. Increasing levels of androgen and estrogen have an effect on the thought processes of adolescents and have been described as being in the minds "of almost all adolescents a good deal of the time".&lt;ref name=feldman2015&gt;{{cite book |last=Feldman |first=Robert |title=Discovering the life span |publisher=Pearson |location=Boston |year=2015 |isbn=9780205992317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though most female adolescents begin their sexual maturation process in normal, predictable ways, there may be concerns by parents and clinicians if the following become evident:
* painful menstruation
* chronic pelvic pain
* partial vaginal outflow obstruction/imperforate hymen
* possible anatomical defects&lt;ref name=marc2015&gt;{{cite book |last=Marcdante |first=Karen |title=Nelson essentials of pediatrics |publisher=Elsevier/Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=2015 |isbn=9781455759804 |postscript=: Access provided by the University of Pittsburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views on sexual activity==

One study from 1996 documented the interviews of a sample of junior high school students in the United States. The girls were less likely to state that they ever had sex than adolescent boys. Among boys and girls who had experienced sexual intercourse, the proportion of girls and boys who had recently had sex and were regularly sexually active was the same.&lt;ref name = "DeGaston" &gt;{{cite journal |author1=De Gaston J. F. |author2=Weed S. |year=1996 |title=Understanding gender differences in adolescent sexuality |url= |journal=Adolescence |volume=31 |issue=121 |pages=217–231 |pmid=9173787}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those conducting the study speculated that fewer girls say they have ever had sex because girls viewed teenage parenthood as more of a problem than boys. Girls were thought to be more restricted in their sexual attitudes; they were more likely than boys to believe that they would be able to control their sexual urges. Girls had a more negative association in how being sexually active could affect their future goals. In general, girls said they felt less pressure from peers to begin having sex, while boys reported feeling more pressure.&lt;ref name = "DeGaston" /&gt;

A later study questioned the attitudes of adolescents. When asked about [[abstinence]], many girls reported they felt conflicted. They were trying to balance maintaining a good reputation with trying to maintain a romantic relationship and wanting to behave in adult-like ways. Boys viewed having sex as social capital. Many boys believed that their male peers who were abstinent would not as easily climb the social ladder as sexually active boys. Some boys said that for them, the risks that may come from having sex were not as bad as the social risks that could come from remaining abstinent.&lt;!--awkward wording--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ott M. A. |author2=Pfeiffer E. J. |author3=Fortenberry J. D. |year=2006 |title=Perceptions of Sexual Abstinence among High-Risk Early and Middle Adolescents |url= |journal=Journal of Adolescent Health |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=192–198 |doi=10.1016/j.jadohealth.2005.12.009 |pmid=16857530}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concepts about loss of virginity===
{{See also|Virginity#Definitions of virginity loss}}
In the United States, federally mandated programs started in 1980 and promoted adolescent abstinence from sexual intercourse, which resulted in teens turning to [[Fellatio|oral sex]], which about a third of teens considered a form of abstinence in a study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Orenstein | first = Peggy | title = Girls &amp; sex : navigating the complicated new landscape | publisher = Harper, an imprint of HarperCollinsPublishers | location = New York, NY | year = 2016 | isbn = 9780062209726 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until their first act of sexual intercourse, adolescents generally see virginity in one of the following ways: as a gift, a stigma, or a normal step in development. Girls typically think of virginity as a gift, while boys think of virginity as a stigma.&lt;ref name="Carpenter"&gt;{{cite journal |author =Carpenter L. M. |year=2002 |title=Gender and the meaning and experience of virginity loss in the contemporary United States |url= |journal=Gender and Society |volume=16 |issue= |pages=345–365 |doi=10.1177/0891243202016003005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In interviews, girls said that they viewed giving someone their virginity as like giving them a very special gift. Because of this, they often expected something in return such as increased emotional intimacy with their partners or the virginity of their partner. However, they often felt disempowered because of this; they often did not feel like they actually received what they expected in return and this made them feel like they had less power in their relationship. They felt that they had given something up and did not feel like this action was recognized.&lt;ref name="Carpenter" /&gt;

Thinking of virginity as a [[Social stigma|stigma]] disempowered many boys because they felt deeply ashamed and often tried to hide the fact that they were virgins from their partners, which for some resulted in their partners teasing them and criticizing them about their limited sexual techniques. The girls who viewed virginity as a stigma did not experience this shaming. Even though they privately thought of virginity as a stigma, these girls believed that society valued their virginity because of the stereotype that women are sexually passive. This, they said, made it easier for them to lose their virginity once they wanted to because they felt society had a more positive view on female virgins and that this may have made them sexually attractive. Thinking of losing virginity as part of a natural developmental process resulted in less power imbalance between boys and girls because these individuals felt less affected by other people and were more in control of their individual sexual experience.&lt;ref name="Carpenter" /&gt; Adolescent boys, however, were more likely than adolescent girls to view their loss of virginity as a positive aspect of their sexuality because it is more accepted by peers.&lt;ref name="Carpenter" /&gt;

===Birth control===
In 2002, a survey was conducted in European nations about the sexual behavior of teenagers. In a sample of fifteen year olds from 24 countries, most participants self-reported that they had not experienced sexual intercourse. Among those who were sexually active, the majority (82%) used [[contraception]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Godeau E, Nic Gabhainn S, Vignes C, Ross J, Boyce W, Todd J |title=Contraceptive use by 15-year-old students at their last sexual intercourse: results from 24 countries |journal=Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med |volume=162 |issue=1 |pages=66–73 |date=January 2008 |pmid=18180415 |doi=10.1001/archpediatrics.2007.8 |url=http://archpedi.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=18180415 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120323112559/http://archpedi.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=18180415 |archivedate=2012-03-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teenage girls who use [[combined oral contraceptive pill|the most common form of birth control pills]], combination birth control pills with both estrogen and progestin, are 80% more likely to be prescribed an antidepressant than girls who were not taking birth control.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4517247/birth-control-depression-risk/|title=Your Birth Control Pill Might Raise Your Depression Risk|last=Amanda MacMillan / Health. com|website=TIME.com|access-date=2016-10-05|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005015720/http://time.com/4517247/birth-control-depression-risk/|archivedate=2016-10-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Girls who take progestin-only pills are 120% more likely.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The risk of depression is tripled for teenage girls who use non-oral forms of hormonal contraception.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;



===Adolescent sexual functioning: gender similarities and differences===
Lucia O’Sullivan and her colleagues studied adolescent sexual functioning; they compared an adolescent sample with an adult sample and found no significant differences between them.  Desire, satisfaction and sexual functioning were generally high among their sample of participants (aged 17–21). Additionally, no significant gender differences were found in the prevalence of sexual dysfunction.&lt;ref name = "Osullivan" &gt;{{cite journal |author1=O'Sullivan Lucia |author2=Majerovich JoAnn |year=2008 |title=Difficulties with sexual functioning in a sample of male and female late adolescent and young adult university students |url= |journal=The Canadian Journal of Human Sexuality |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=109–121 |hdl=1882/31298 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In terms of problems with sexual functioning mentioned by participants in this study, the most common problems listed for males were experiencing anxiety about performing sexually (81.4%) and premature ejaculation (74.4%). Other common problems included issues becoming erect and difficulties with ejaculation. Generally, most problems were not experienced on a chronic basis. Common problems for girls included difficulties with sexual climax ([[orgasm]]) (86.7%), not feeling sexually interested during a sexual situation (81.2%), unsatisfactory vaginal lubrication (75.8%) anxiety about performing sexually (75.8%) and painful intercourse (25.8%). Most problems listed by the girls were not persistent problems. However, inability to experience orgasm seemed to be an issue that was persistent for some participants.&lt;ref name = "Osullivan" /&gt;

The authors detected four trends during their interviews: sexual pleasure increased with the amount of sexual experience the participants had; those who had experienced sexual difficulties were typically sex-avoidant; some participants continued to engage in regular sexual activity even if they had low interest; and lastly, many experienced pain when engaging in sexual activity if they experienced low arousal.&lt;ref name = "Osullivan" /&gt;

Another study found that it was not uncommon for adolescent girls in relationships to report they felt little desire to engage in sexual activity when they were in relationships. However, many girls engaged in sexual activity even if they did not desire it, in order to avoid what they think might place strains on their relationships.&lt;ref name = "Tolman"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tolman |first=Deborah L. |year=2002 |title=Female adolescent sexuality: an argument for a developmental perspective on the new view of women's sexual problems |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J015v24n01_21 |journal=[[Women &amp; Therapy]] |volume=42 |issue=1–2 |pages=195–209 |publisher=Taylor and Francis |doi=10.1300/J015v24n01_21 |ref=harv |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researcher states that this may be because of society's pressure on girls to be "good girls"; the pressure to be "good" may make adolescent girls think they are not supposed to feel desire like boys do. Even when girls said they did feel sexual desire, they said that they felt like they were not supposed to, and often tried to cover up their feelings. This is an example of how societal expectations about gender can impact adolescent sexual functioning.&lt;ref name = "Tolman" /&gt;



===In Brazil===
&lt;!---fork to separate article. Insert in "see also"---&gt;
The average age Brazilians lose their virginity is 17.4 years of age, the second lowest number in the countries researched (first was Austria), according to the 2007 research finding these results, and they also ranked low at using condoms at their first time, at 47.9% (to the surprise of the researchers, people of lower socioeconomic status were far more likely to do so than those of higher ones). 58.4% of women reported that it was in a committed relationship, versus solely 18.9% of men (traditional Mediterranean cultures-descended mores tend to enforce strongly about male sexual prowess equating virility and female quality being chastity and purity upon marriage), and scored among the countries where people have the most positive feelings about their first time, feeling pleasure and more mature afterwards (versus the most negative attitudes coming from Japan).&lt;ref&gt;[http://g1.globo.com/Noticias/Brasil/0,,MUL63630-5598,00.html Brazilians among those who lose virginity earliest] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130702042731/http://g1.globo.com/Noticias/Brasil/0%2C%2CMUL63630-5598%2C00.html |date=2013-07-02 }} {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another research, leading the international ranking, 29.6% of Brazilian men lost their virginity before age 15 (versus 8.8% of women), but the average is really losing virginity at age 16.5 and marrying at age 24 for men, and losing virginity at age 18.5 and marrying at age 20 for women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saudeemmovimento.com.br/reportagem/noticia_print.asp?cod_noticia=2238 Saúde em Movimento's Health Journal – 30% of Brazilian boys lose their virginity before age 15, Brazil leads ranking] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140114222632/http://www.saudeemmovimento.com.br/reportagem/noticia_print.asp?cod_noticia=2238 |date=January 14, 2014 }} {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; These do not differ much from national figures. In 2005, 80% of then adolescents lost their virginity before their seventeenth birthday, and about 1 in each 5 new children in the country were born to an adolescent mother,&lt;ref&gt;[http://revistaepoca.globo.com/Revista/Epoca/0,,EDR70422-6014,00.html Época – The Brazilian through statistics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029210647/http://revistaepoca.globo.com/Revista/Epoca/0%2C%2CEDR70422-6014%2C00.html |date=2013-10-29 }} {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the number of children per women is solely 1.7 in average, below the natural replacement and the third lowest in independent countries of the Americas, after Canada and Cuba.

A 2013 report through national statistics of students of the last grade before high school, aged generally (86%) 13–15, found out 28.7% of them already had lost their virginity, with both demographics of 40.1% of boys and 18.3% of girls having reduced their rate since the last research, in 2009, that found the results as 30.5% overall, 43.7% for boys and 18.7% for girls. Further about the 2013 research, 30.9% of those studying in public schools were already sexually initiated, versus 18% in private ones; 24.7% of sexually initiated adolescents did not use a condom in their most recent sexual activity (22.9% of boys, 28.2% of girls), in spite of at the school environment 89.1% of them receiving orientation about STDs, 69.7% receiving orientation of where to acquire condoms for free (as part of a public health campaign from the Brazilian government) and 82.9% had heard of other forms of contraceptive methods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://noticias.terra.com.br/educacao/ibge-287-dos-estudantes-entre-13-e-15-anos-dizem-ja-ter-perdido-virgindade,a629d64ef8c5f310VgnVCM5000009ccceb0aRCRD.html IBGE: 28.7% of students aged 13-15 said they already have lost their virginity – Terra Educação] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140115144637/http://noticias.terra.com.br/educacao/ibge-287-dos-estudantes-entre-13-e-15-anos-dizem-ja-ter-perdido-virgindade,a629d64ef8c5f310VgnVCM5000009ccceb0aRCRD.html |date=2014-01-15 }} {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Canada===
&lt;!---fork to separate article---&gt;
One group of Canadian researchers found a relationship between self-esteem and sexual activity. They found that students, especially girls, who were verbally abused by teachers or rejected by their peers were more likely than other students to have sex by the end of the Grade 7. The researchers speculate that low self-esteem increases the likelihood of sexual activity: "low self-esteem seemed to explain the link between peer rejection and early sex. Girls with a poor self-image may see sex as a way to become 'popular', according to the researchers".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/news/fullstory_55689.html Peer rejection tied to early sex in pre-teens] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011012252/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/news/fullstory_55689.html |date=October 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In India===
&lt;!---fork to separate article---&gt;
In [[India]] there is growing evidence that adolescents are becoming more sexually active. It is feared that this will lead to an increase in spread of [[AIDS|HIV/AIDS]] among adolescents, increase the number of unwanted pregnancies and [[abortion]]s, and give rise to conflict between contemporary social values. Adolescents have relatively poor access to health care and education. With cultural norms opposing extramarital sexual behavior "these implications may acquire threatening dimensions for the society and the nation".&lt;ref name="india girls"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://iussp2005.princeton.edu/download.aspx?submissionId=50332 |title=Socio-psychological Constructs of Premarital Sex Behavior among Adolescent Girls in India |accessdate=2007-01-21 |publisher=Princeton University |author=R.S.Goya |work=Abstract |format=pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610120429/http://iussp2005.princeton.edu/download.aspx?submissionId=50332 |archivedate=2007-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Motivation and frequency:
Sexual relationships outside marriage are not uncommon among teenage boys and girls in India. By far, the best predictor of whether or not a girl would be having sex is if her friends were engaging in the same activities. For those girls whose friends were having a physical relationship with a boy, 84.4% were engaging in the same behavior. Only 24.8% of girls whose friends were not having a physical relationship had one themselves. In urban areas, 25.2% of girls have had intercourse and in rural areas 20.9% have.  Better indicators of whether or not girls were having sex were their employment and school status.  Girls who were not attending school were 14.2% (17.4% v. 31.6%) more likely and girls who were employed were 14.4%(36.0% v. 21.6%) more likely to be having sex.&lt;ref name="india girls"/&gt;

In the Indian sociocultural milieu girls have less access to parental love, schools, opportunities for self-development and freedom of movement than boys do. It has been argued that they may rebel against this lack of access or seek out affection through physical relationships with boys.  While the data reflects trends to support this theory, it is inconclusive.&lt;ref name="india girls" /&gt;  The freedom to communicate with adolescent boys was restricted for girls regardless of whether they lived in an urban or rural setting, and regardless of whether they went to school or not.  More urban girls than rural girls discussed sex with their friends.  Those who did not may have felt "the subject of sexuality in itself is considered an 'adult issue' and a taboo or it may be that some respondents were wary of revealing such personal information."&lt;ref name="india know"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Dhoundiyal Manju |author2=Venkatesh Renuka |title=Knowledge regarding human sexuality among adolescent girls |journal=The Indian Journal of Pediatrics |year=2006 |volume=73 |issue=8 |url=http://www.ijppediatricsindia.org/article.asp?issn=0019-5456;year=2006;volume=73;issue=8;spage=743;epage=743;aulast=Dhoundiyal |pages=743 |doi=10.1007/BF02898460 |pmid=16936373 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928015831/http://www.ijppediatricsindia.org/article.asp?issn=0019-5456%3Byear%3D2006%3Bvolume%3D73%3Bissue%3D8%3Bspage%3D743%3Bepage%3D743%3Baulast%3DDhoundiyal |archivedate=2007-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Contraceptive use:
Among Indian girls, "misconceptions about sex, sexuality and sexual health were large. However, adolescents having sex relationships were somewhat better informed about the sources of spread of STDs and HIV/AIDS."&lt;ref name="india girls" /&gt;  While 40.0% of sexually active girls were aware that condoms could help prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS and reduce the likelihood of pregnancy, only 10.5% used a condom during the last time they had intercourse.&lt;ref name="india girls" /&gt;

===In The Netherlands===
According to Advocates for Youth, the United States' teen pregnancy rate is over four times as much as it is in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.advocatesforyouth.org/publications/publications-a-z/419-adolescent-sexual-health-in-europe-and-the-us |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402114433/http://www.advocatesforyouth.org/publications/publications-a-z/419-adolescent-sexual-health-in-europe-and-the-us |archivedate=2015-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In comparison, in the documentary, ''Let's Talk About Sex'', a photographer named James Houston travels from Los Angeles to D.C. and to the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.advocatesforyouth.org/press-room/1811-lets-talk-about-sex-documentary-and-campaign-take-on-sexual-health-crisis |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402095651/http://www.advocatesforyouth.org/press-room/1811-lets-talk-about-sex-documentary-and-campaign-take-on-sexual-health-crisis |archivedate=2015-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Netherlands, he contrasts European and American attitudes about sex. From the HIV rates to the contemplations of teen parenthood in America, Houston depicts a society in which America and the Netherlands differ.

Most Dutch parents practice vigilant leniency,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hVBV86xxG10C&amp;pg=PA153&amp;lpg=PA153&amp;dq=vigilant+leniency&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=iaZonNtOii&amp;sig=tUo1a3pq1PeOtJWjc3V0ytt3bOs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zaAZVdc517DIBLybgNgM&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=vigilant+leniency&amp;f=false|title=Not Under My Roof: Parents, Teens, and the Culture of Sex|first=Amy T.|last=Schalet|date=30 September 2011|publisher=University of Chicago Press|accessdate=7 May 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which they have a strong familial bond and are open to letting their children make their own decisions.

''[[Gezelligheid]]'' is a term used by many Dutch adolescents to describe their relationship with their family. The atmosphere is open and there is little that is not discussed between parents and children.

Amy Schalet, author of ''Not Under My Roof: Parents, Teens, and the Culture of Sex'' discusses in her book how the practices of Dutch parents strengthen their bonds with their children. Teenagers feel more comfortable about their sexuality and engage in discussion with their parents about it. A majority of Dutch parents feel comfortable allowing their teenagers to have their significant other spend the night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schalet |first1=Amy |title=Not Under My Roof: Parents, Teens, and the Culture of Sex |date=2011 |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Same-sex attractions among adolescents==
Adolescent girls and boys who are attracted to others of the same sex are strongly affected by their surroundings in that adolescents often decide to express their sexualities or keep them secret depending on certain factors in their societies. These factors affect girls and boys differently. If girls’ schools and religions are against same sex attractions, they pose the greatest obstacles to girls who experience same sex attractions. These factors were not listed as affecting boys as much. The researchers suggest that maybe this is because not only are some religions against same-sex attraction, but they also encourage traditional roles for women and do not believe that women can carry out these roles as lesbians. Schools may affect girls more than boys because strong emphasis is placed on girls to date boys, and many school activities place high importance on heterosexuality (such as cheerleading).&lt;ref name = "Waldner" &gt;{{cite journal |author1=Waldner Haugrud |author2=Macgruder B |year=1996 |title=Homosexual identity expression among lesbian and gay adolescents: An analysis of perceived structural associations |url= |journal=Youth &amp; Society |volume=27 |issue= |pages=313–333 |doi=10.1177/0044118X96027003003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the idea of not conforming to typical male gender roles inhibited many boys from openly expressing their same-sex attraction. The worry of conforming to gender roles did not inhibit girls from expressing their same-gender preferences as much, because society is generally more flexible about their gender expression.&lt;ref name = "Waldner" /&gt;

Researchers such as [[Lisa Diamond]] are interested in how some adolescents depart from the socially constructed norms of gender and sexuality. She found that some girls, when faced with the option of choosing "heterosexual", "same-sex attracted" or "bisexual", preferred not to choose a label because their feelings do not fit into any of those categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author =Diamond L |year=2000 |title=Sexual identity, attractions, and behavior among young sexual-minority women over a two-year period |url= |journal=Developmental Psychology |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages=241–250 |pmid=10749081 |doi=10.1037/0012-1649.36.2.241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexually transmitted infections==
Adolescents have the highest rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) when compared to older groups. Sexually active adolescents are more likely to believe that they will not contract a sexually transmitted infection than adults. Adolescents are more likely to have an infected partner and less likely to receive health care when an STI is suspected. They are also less likely to comply with the treatment for an STI. Coinfection is common among adolescents.&lt;ref name=marc2015/&gt;

An STI can have a large negative physiological and psychological effect on an adolescent. The goal of the pediatrician is for early diagnosis and treatment. Early treatment is important for preventing medical complications and infertility. Prevention of STIs should be a priority for all health care providers for adolescents. Diagnosis of an STI begins the evaluation of concomitant STIs and the notification and treatment of sexual partners. Some states in the US require the reporting of STIs to the state's health department.&lt;ref name=marc2015/&gt;

==Media influence==
Modern media contains more sexual messages than was true in the past and the effects on teen sexual behavior remain relatively unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author =Brown JD |title=Mass media influences on sexuality |journal=J Sex Res |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=42–5 |date=February 2002 |pmid=12476255 |doi=10.1080/00224490209552118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only 9% of the sex scenes on 1,300 of cable network programming discusses and deals with the negative consequences of sexual behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Pawlowski, Cheryl., PH d. Glued to the Tube., Sourcebooks, INC., Naperville, Il.2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The Internet may further provide adolescents with poor information on health issues, sexuality, and sexual violence.&lt;ref&gt;Subrahmanyam, Kaveri., Greenfield, Patricia, M., Tynes, Brendesha. The Internet Influences Teen Sexual Attitudes. Teen Sexuality:Opposing Viewpoints 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

A study on examining sexual messages in popular TV shows found that 2 out of 3 programs contained sexually related actions. 1 out of 15 shows included scenes of sexual intercourse itself. Shows featured a variety of sexual messages, including characters talking about when they wanted to have sex and how to use sex to keep a relationship alive. Some researchers believe that adolescents can use these messages as well as the sexual actions they see on TV in their own sexual lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author =Brown J. D. |year=2002 |title=Mass media influences on sexuality |url= |journal=The Journal of Sex Research |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=42–45 |pmid=12476255 |doi=10.1080/00224490209552118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The results of a study by [[Deborah Tolman]] and her colleagues indicated that adolescent exposure to sexuality on television ''in general'' does not directly affect their sexual behaviors, rather it is the ''type'' of message they view that has the most impact.&lt;ref name = "TolmanTV" &gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tolman DL, Kim JL, Schooler D, Sorsoli CL |title=Rethinking the associations between television viewing and adolescent sexuality development: bringing gender into focus |journal=J Adolesc Health |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=84.e9–16 |date=January 2007 |pmid=17185211 |doi=10.1016/j.jadohealth.2006.08.002 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender stereotypes enacted in sexual scenes on TV were seen to have a large affect on adolescents. Girls felt they had less control over their sexuality when they saw men objectifying women and not valuing commitment. The study discussed the risk of women internalizing this message and spreading the idea that it is okay to be weak and answer to men all the time. However, girls who saw women on TV who refuted men’s sexual advances usually felt more comfortable talking about their own sexual needs in their sexual experiences as well as standing up for themselves. They were comfortable setting sexual limits and therefore held more control over their sexuality. Findings for boys were less clear; those who saw dominant and aggressive men actually had less sexual experiences.&lt;ref name = "TolmanTV" /&gt;

However some scholars have argued that such claims of media effects have been premature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Steinberg L, Monahan KC |title=Age differences in resistance to peer influence |journal=Dev Psychol |volume=43 |issue=6 |pages=1531–43 |date=November 2007 |pmid=18020830 |pmc=2779518 |doi=10.1037/0012-1649.43.6.1531 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, according to US government health statistics, teens have delayed the onset of sexual intercourse in recent years, despite increasingly amounts of sexual media.&lt;ref&gt;childstats.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 study wanted to find out if there was any correlation between sexual content shown in the media and teenage pregnancy. Research showed that teens who viewed high levels of sexual content were twice as likely to get pregnant within three years compared to those teens who were not exposed to as much sexual content. The study concluded that the way media portrays sex has a huge effect on adolescent sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Chandra A|author2= Martino SC|author3= Collins RL|author4= Elliott MN|author5= Berry SH|author6= Kanouse DE|author7= Miu A| year = 2008 | title = Does Watching Sex on Television Predict Teen Pregnancy?

==Teenage pregnancy==
{{Main|Teenage pregnancy}}

Adolescent girls become fertile following the [[menarche]] (first menstrual period), which normally occurs between age 11 to 12. After menarche, [[sexual intercourse]] (especially without [[contraception]]) can lead to [[pregnancy]]. The pregnant teenager may then [[miscarriage|miscarry]], have an [[abortion]], or carry the child to [[birth|full term]].

Pregnant teenagers face many of the same issues of childbirth as women in their 20s and 30s. However, there are additional medical concerns for younger mothers, particularly those under 15 and those living in developing countries. For example, [[obstetric fistula]] is a particular issue for very young mothers in poorer regions.&lt;ref name="savethechildren"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.bmj.com/content/328/7449/1152.2|title=Pregnancy and childbirth are leading causes of death in teenage girls in developing countries|first=Susan|last=Mayor|date=13 May 2004|publisher=|journal=BMJ|volume=328|issue=7449|pages=1152|accessdate=7 May 2018|via=bmj.bmjjournals.com|doi=10.1136/bmj.328.7449.1152-a|pmid=15142897|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525232311/http://www.bmj.com/content/328/7449/1152.2|archivedate=25 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For mothers between 15 and 19, risks are associated more with socioeconomic factors than with the biological effects of age.&lt;ref name=makinson&gt;{{cite journal |author =Makinson C |title=The health consequences of teenage fertility |journal=Fam Plann Perspect |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=132–9 |year=1985 |pmid=2431924 |doi=10.2307/2135024 |jstor=2135024}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, research has shown that the risk of [[low birth weight]] is connected to the biological age itself, as it was observed in teen births even after controlling for other risk factors (such as utilisation of antenatal care etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/01443610410001685529 |title=Poor obstetric performance of teenagers: is it age- or quality of care-related? |year=2004 |last1=Loto |first1=OM |last2=Ezechi |first2=OC |last3=Kalu |first3=BKE |last4=Loto |first4=Anthonia B |last5=Ezechi |first5=Lilian O |last6=Ogunniyi |first6=SO |journal=Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=395–8 |pmid=15203579}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=17214178 |year=1995 |last1=Abalkhail |first1=BA |title=Adolescent pregnancy: Are there biological barriers for pregnancy outcomes? |volume=70 |issue=5–6 |pages=609–25 |journal=The Journal of the Egyptian Public Health Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Age of consent}} {{See also|Marriageable age|Teen marriage}} [[Statutory rape|Sexual conduct between adults and adolescents younger than the local age of consent]] is illegal, and in some [[Islam]]ic countries any kind of sexual activity outside marriage is prohibited. In many jurisdictions, sexual intercourse between adolescents with a close age difference is not prohibited. Around the world, the average age-of-consent is 16,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avert.org/age-of-consent.htm|title=Sexual consent|author=|date=23 June 2015|website=avert.org|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20090510172906/http://www.avert.org/age-of-consent.htm|archivedate=10 May 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this varies from being age 12 in [[Angola]], age 16 in [[Spain]] and [[Canada]], and age 16-18 in the [[United States]].  In some jurisdictions, the age-of-consent for homosexual acts may be different from that for heterosexual acts. The age-of-consent in a particular jurisdiction is typically the same as the [[age of majority]] or several years younger. The age at which one can legally marry is also sometimes different from the legal age-of-consent.

Sexual relations with a person under the age-of-consent are generally a [[criminal offense]] in the jurisdiction in which the act was committed, with punishments ranging from token fines to life imprisonment. Many different terms exist for the charges laid and include [[statutory rape]], illegal [[carnal knowledge]], or corruption of a minor.

==Societal influence==
{{Main|Theoretical Perspectives on Gendered Sexuality}}

===Social constructionist perspective===
The social constructionist perspective (see [[social constructionism]] for a general definition) on adolescent sexuality examines how power, culture, meaning and gender interact to affect the sexualities of adolescents.&lt;ref name = "Tolman1" &gt;{{cite journal |author1=Tolman D. L. |author2=Diamond L. M. |year=2001 |title=Desegregating sexuality research: Cultural and biological perspectives on gender and desire |url= |journal=Annual Review of Sex Research |volume=12 |issue= |pages=33–74 |pmid=12666736}}&lt;/ref&gt; This perspective is closely tied to [[feminism]] and [[queer theory]]. Those who believe in the social constructionist perspective state that the current meanings most people in our society tie to female and male sexuality are actually a social construction to keep [[heterosexual]] and privileged people in power.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, C., &amp; Wilkinson, S. (1993). ''Theorizing heterosexuality''. In S. Wilkinson &amp; C. Kitzinger, (Eds.), Heterosexuality: A feminism and psychology reader (pp. 1-32). London: Sage Publications&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers interested in exploring adolescent sexuality using this perspective typically investigates how gender, race, culture, [[socioeconomic status]] and [[sexual orientation]] affect how adolescent understand their own sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Tolman D. L. |author2=Striepe M. I. |author3=Harmon T. |year=2003 |title=Gender Matters: Constructing a Model of Adolescent Sexual Health |url= |journal=Journal of Sex Research |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=4–12 |doi=10.1080/00224490309552162 |pmid=12806527}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of how gender affects sexuality is when young adolescent girls state that they believe sex is a method used to maintain relationships when boys are emotionally unavailable. Because they are girls, they believe they ought to engage in sexual behavior in order to please their boyfriends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=O'Sullivan L. |author2=Meyer-Bahlburg H. F. L. |year=1996 |title=African-American and Latina inner-city girls' reports of romantic and sexual development |url= |journal=Journal of Social and Personal Relationships |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=221–238 |doi=10.1177/02654075030202006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developmental feminist perspective===
The developmental feminist perspective is closely tied to the social constructionist perspective. It is specifically interested in how society's gender norms affect adolescent development, especially for girls. For example, some researchers on the topic hold the view that adolescent girls are still strongly affected by gender roles imposed on them by society and that this in turn affects their sexuality and sexual behavior. [[Deborah Tolman]] is an advocate for this viewpoint and states that societal pressures to be "good" cause girls to pay more attention to what they think others expect of them than looking within themselves to understand their own sexuality. Tolman states that young girls learn to objectify their own bodies and end up thinking of themselves as objects of desire. This causes them to often see their own bodies as others see it, which causes them to feel a sense of detachment from their bodies and their sexualities. Tolman calls this a process of disembodiment. This process leaves young girls unassertive about their own sexual desires and needs because they focus so much on what other people expect of them rather than on what they feel inside.&lt;ref name = "Tolman" /&gt;

Another way gender roles affect adolescent sexuality is thought the sexual double standard. This double standard occurs when others judge women for engaging in premarital sex and for embracing their sexualities, while men are rewarded for the same behavior.&lt;ref name = "Jackson"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jackson S. M. |author2=Cram F. |year=2003 |title=Disrupting the sexual double standard: young women's talk about heterosexuality |url= |journal=British Journal of Social Psychology |volume=42 |issue=Pt 1 |pages=113–127 |doi=10.1348/014466603763276153 |pmid=12713759}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a double standard because the genders are behaving similarly, but are being judged differently for their actions because of their gender. An example of this can be seen in Tolman’s research when she interviews girls about their experiences with their sexualities. In Tolman’s interviews, girls who sought sex because they desired it felt like they had to cover it up in order (for example, they blamed their sexual behavior on drinking) to not be judged by others in their school. They were afraid of being viewed negatively for enjoying their sexuality. Many girls were thus trying to make their own solutions (like blaming their sexual behavior on something else or silencing their own desires and choosing to not engage in sexual behavior) to a problem that is actually caused by power imbalances between the genders within our societies.&lt;ref name = "Tolman" /&gt; Other research showed that girls were tired of being judged for their sexual behavior because of their gender. However, even these girls were strongly affected by societal gender roles and rarely talked about their own desires and instead talked about how "being ready" (rather than experiencing desire) would determine their sexual encounters.&lt;ref name = "Jackson" /&gt;

O’Sullivan and her colleagues assessed 180 girls between the ages of 12 and 14 on their perceptions on what their first sexual encounters would be like; many girls reported feeling negative emotions towards sex before their first time. The researchers think this is because adolescent girls are taught that society views adolescent pre-marital sex in negative terms. When they reported positive feelings, the most commonly listed one was feeling attractive. This shows how many girls objectify their own bodies and often think about this before they think of their own sexual desires and needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=O'Sullivan L. |author2=Hear K. D. |year=2008 |title=Predicting first intercourse among urban early adolescent girls: The role of emotions |url= |journal=Cognition and Emotion |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=168–179 |doi=10.1080/02699930701298465}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers found that having an older sibling, especially an older brother, affected how girls viewed sex and sexuality.&lt;ref name = "Kornreich" &gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kornreich J. L. |author2=Hearn K. D. |author3=Rodriguez G. |author4=O'Sullivan L. F. |year=2003 |title=Sibling Influence, Gender Roles, and the Sexual Socialization of Unban Early Adolescent Girls |url= |journal=Journal of Sex Research |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=101–110 |doi=10.1080/00224490309552170 |pmid=12806535}}&lt;/ref&gt; Girls with older brothers held more traditional views about sexuality and said they were less interested in seeking sex, as well as less interested responding to the sexual advances of boys compared with girls with no older siblings. Researchers believe this is because older siblings model gender roles, so girls with older siblings (especially brothers) may have more traditional views of what society says girls and boys should be like; girls with older brothers may believe that sexual intercourse is mostly for having children, rather than for gaining sexual pleasure. This traditional view can inhibit them from focusing on their own sexualities and desires, and may keep them constrained to society’s prescribed gender roles.&lt;ref name = "Kornreich" /&gt;

===Social learning and the sexual self-concept===
Developing a sexual self-concept is an important developmental step during adolescence.

The sexual self-concept of girls with more negative views are highly influenced by other people; those of girls who hold more positive views are less so.&lt;ref name = "Andersen" /&gt;

When comparing the sexual self-concepts of adolescent girls and boys, researchers found that boys experienced lower sexual self-esteem and higher sexual anxiety. The boys stated they were less able to refuse or resist sex at a greater rate than the girls reported having difficulty with this. The authors state that this may be because society places so much emphasis on teaching girls how to be resistant towards sex, that boys do not learn these skills and are less able to use them when they want to say no to sex. They also explain how society's stereotype that boys are always ready to desire sex and be aroused may contribute to the fact that many boys may not feel comfortable resisting sex, because it is something society tells them they should want.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dekhtyar O. |author2=Cupp P. |author3=Anderman E. |year=2008 |title=Sexual self-concept and sexual self-efficacy in adolescents: a possible clue to promoting sexual health? |url= |journal=Journal of Sex Research |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages=277–286 |doi=10.1080/00224490802204480 |pmid=18686156}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because society expects adolescent boys to be assertive, dominant and in control, they are limited in how they feel it is appropriate to act within a romantic relationship. Many boys feel lower self-esteem when they cannot attain these hyper-masculine ideals that society says they should. Additionally, there is not much guidance on how boys should act within relationships and many boys do not know how to retain their masculinity while being authentic and reciprocating affection in their relationships. This difficult dilemma is called the double-edged sword of masculinity by some researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Chu J. Y. |author2=Porche M. V. |author3=Tolman D.

Hensel and colleagues conducted a study with 387 female participants between the ages of 14 and 17 and found that as the girls got older (and learned more about their sexual self-concept), they experienced less anxiety, greater comfort with sexuality and experienced more instances of sexual activity.&lt;ref name = "Hensel" /&gt; Additionally, across the four years (from 14-17), sexual self-esteem increased, and sexual anxiety lessened. The researchers stated that this may indicate that the more sexual experiences the adolescent girls have had, the more confidence they hold in their sexual behavior and sexuality. Additionally, it may mean that for girls who have not yet had intercourse, they become more confident and ready to participate in an encounter for the first time.&lt;ref name = "Osullivan3" &gt;{{cite journal |author1=O'Sullivan L.

==Sex education==
[[Sex education]], also called "Sexuality Education" or informally "Sex Ed" is [[education]] about human [[sex organ|sexual anatomy]], [[sexual reproduction]], [[sexual intercourse]], [[human sexual behavior]], and other aspects of [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], such as [[body image]], [[sexual orientation]], [[Dating (activity)|dating]], and [[Intimate relationship|relationships]]. Common avenues for sex education are parents, caregivers, friends, school programs, religious groups, popular media, and public health campaigns.

Sexual education is not always taught the same in every country. For example, in [[France]] sex education has been part of school curricula since 1973. Schools are expected to provide 30 to 40 hours of sex education, and pass out condoms to students in grades eight and nine. In January, 2000, the French government launched an information campaign on contraception with TV and radio spots and the distribution of five million leaflets on contraception to high school students.&lt;ref name=" britsexed "&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/courier/2000_07/uk/apprend.htm Britain: Sex Education Under Fire] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091222184211/http://www.unesco.org/courier/2000_07/uk/apprend.htm |date=2009-12-22 }} ''UNESCO Courier''&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Germany]], sex education has been part of school curricula since 1970. Since 1992 sex education is by law a governmental duty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bildungsklick.de/pm/35091/sexualaufklaerung-in-europa/ Sexualaufklärung in Europa] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110929212508/http://bildungsklick.de/pm/35091/sexualaufklaerung-in-europa/ |date=2011-09-29 }} (German)&lt;/ref&gt; A survey by the [[World Health Organization]] concerning the habits of European teenagers in 2006 revealed that German teenagers care about contraception. The birth rate among German 15- to 19-year-olds is 11.7 per 1000 population, compared to 2.9 per 1000 population in Korea, and 55.6 per 1000 population in US.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/repcard3e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[SIECUS]], the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States, in most families, parents are the primary sex educators of their adolescents. They found 93% of adults they surveyed support sexuality education in high school and 84%  support it in junior high school.&lt;ref&gt;SIECUS Report of Public Support of Sexuality Education(1999)[http://www.siecus.org/school/sex_ed/sex_ed0002.html SIECUS Report Online] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219012810/http://www.siecus.org/school/sex_ed/sex_ed0002.html |date=December 19, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, 88% of parents of junior high school students and 80% of parents of high school students believe that sex education in school makes it easier for them to talk to their adolescents about sex.&lt;ref&gt;Sex Education in America. (Washington, DC: National Public Radio, Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, and Kennedy School of Government, 2004), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, 92% of adolescents report that they want both to talk to their parents about sex and to have comprehensive in-school sex education.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

In America, not only do U.S. students receive [[sex education]] within school or religious programs, but they are also educated by their parents. American parents are less prone to influencing their children's actual sexual experiences than they are simply telling their children what they should ''not'' do. They promote [[abstinence]] while educating their children with things that may make their adolescents not want to engage in [[sexual activity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schalet |first=Amy |title=Not Under My Roof: Parents, Teens, and the Culture of Sex |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost all U.S. students receive some form of sex education at least once between grades 7 and 12; many schools begin addressing some topics as early as grade 5 or 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Landry DJ, Singh S, Darroch JE |title=Sexuality education in fifth and sixth grades in U.S. public schools, 1999 |journal=Fam Plann Perspect |volume=32 |issue=5 |pages=212–9 |year=2000 |pmid=11030258 |url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/3221200.html |doi=10.2307/2648174 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607155238/http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/3221200.html |archivedate=2007-06-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, what students learn varies widely, because curriculum decisions are quite decentralized.&lt;ref name="Kaiser 2002"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kff.org/youthhivstds/upload/Sex-Education-in-the-U-S-Policy-and-Politics.pdf |title=Sex Education in the U.S.: Policy and Politics |accessdate=2007-05-23 |date=October 2002 |format=PDF |work=Issue Update |publisher=Kaiser Family Foundation |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051127092023/http://www.kff.org/youthhivstds/upload/Sex-Education-in-the-U-S-Policy-and-Politics.pdf |archivedate=2005-11-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two main forms of sex education are taught in American schools: comprehensive and  [[Abstinence-only sex education|abstinence-only]].

In Asia the state of sex education programs are at various stages of development. [[Indonesia]], [[Mongolia]], [[South Korea]] and [[Sri Lanka]] have a systematic policy framework for teaching about sex within schools. [[Malaysia]], the [[Philippines]] and [[Thailand]] have assessed adolescent reproductive health needs with a view to developing adolescent-specific training, messages and materials. [[India]] has programs that specifically aim at school children at the age group of nine to sixteen years. These are included as subjects in the curriculum and generally involved open and frank interaction with the teachers. [[Bangladesh]], [[Nepal]] and [[Pakistan]] have no coordinated sex education programs.&lt;ref name="escap"&gt;[http://www.unescap.org/esid/psis/population/icpd/sec7.asp Adolescents In Changing Times: Issues And Perspectives For Adolescent Reproductive Health In The ESCAP Region] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140119084911/http://www.unescap.org/esid/psis/population/icpd/sec7.asp |date=2014-01-19 }} United Nations Social and Economic Commission for Asia and the Pacific&lt;/ref&gt;

Some educators hold the view that sexuality is equated with violence. These educators think that not talking about sexuality will decrease the rate of adolescent sexuality. However, not having access to sexual education has been found to have negative effects upon students, especially groups such as adolescent girls who come from low-income families. Not receiving appropriate sexual health education increases teenage pregnancy, sexual victimization and high school dropout rates. Researchers state that it is important to educate students about all aspects of sexuality and sexual health to reduce the risk of these issues.&lt;ref name="Fine"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Fine M |year=1988 |title=Sexuality, schooling, and adolescent females: the missing discourse of desire |journal=Harvard Educational Review |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=29–53 |url=http://her.hepg.org/content/u0468k1v2n2n8242/?p=5f809288df88409fb6ee9ed3e38a4b57&amp;pi=1 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130414222130/http://her.hepg.org/content/u0468k1v2n2n8242/?p=5f809288df88409fb6ee9ed3e38a4b57&amp;pi=1 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The view that sexuality is victimization teaches girls to be careful of being sexually victimized and taken advantage of. Educators who hold this perspective encourage sexual education, but focus on teaching girls how to say no, teaching them of the risks of being victims and educate them about risks and diseases of being sexually active. This perspective teaches adolescents that boys are predators and that girls are victims of sexual victimization. Researchers state that this perspective does not address the existence of desire within girls, does not address the societal variables that influence sexual violence and teaches girls to view sex as dangerous only before marriage. In reality, sexual violence can be very prevalent within marriages too.&lt;ref name = "Fine" /&gt;

Another perspective includes the idea that sexuality is individual morality; this encourages girls to make their own decisions, as long as their decision is to say no to sex before marriage. This education encourages self-control and chastity.&lt;ref name = "Fine" /&gt;

Lastly, the sexual education perspective of the discourse of desire is very rare in U.S. high schools.&lt;ref name = "Tolman1" /&gt; This perspective encourages adolescents to learn more about their desires, gaining pleasure and feeling confident in their sexualities. Researchers state that this view would empower girls because it would place less emphasis on them as the victims and encourage them to have more control over their sexuality.&lt;ref name = "Fine" /&gt;

Research on how gender stereotypes affect adolescent sexuality is important because researchers believe it can show sexual health educators how they can improve their programming to more accurately attend to the needs of adolescents. For example, studies have shown how the social constructed idea that girls are "supposed to" not be interested in sex have actually made it more difficult for girls to have their voices heard when they want to have safer sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Holland J. |author2=Ramazanoglu C. |author3=Scott S. |author4=Sharpe S. |author5=Thompson R. |year=1992 |title=Risk, power and the possibility of pleasure: Young women and safe sex |url= |journal=AIDS Care |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=273–283 |doi=10.1080/09540129208253099 |pmid=1525200}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, SR. &amp; Holland, J.

London: Falmer&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, sexual educators continuously tell girls to make choices that will lead them to safer sex, but don’t always tell them ‘how’ they should go about doing this. Instances such as these show the difficulties that can arise from not exploring how society’s perspective of gender and sexuality affect adolescent sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, J., Ramazanoglu, C., Scott, S., Sharpe, S., &amp; Thompson, R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7809">Lady '''Barbara Montague''' (ca. 1722 – August 1765) was a philanthropist and charity worker, who sponsored programs to assist primarily poor women. As an unmarried woman, and due to illness unable to live with family, she created an alternate family situation that allowed her independence. Joining a community of women in Bath, the group pooled their resources to provide support for each other and others in their community. Upon her death, she left bequests to continue providing for those who had been important in caring for her in her lifetime.

==Early life==
Lady Barbara Montague, known as "Lady Bab" was born around 1722 to the [[George Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax]]&lt;ref name="ODNB-Kelly"&gt;{{cite ODNB|last1=Kelly|first1=Gary|title=Scott [née Robinson], Sarah (1720–1795; Also including Lady Barbara Montagu (c.1722–1765)|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/68975|website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|accessdate=23 July 2017|location=Oxford, England|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/68975|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Lady Mary Lumley, the daughter of [[Richard Lumley, 1st Earl of Scarbrough]].{{sfn|Rizzo|2008|p=299}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lundy|first1=Darryl|title=George Montague, 1st Earl of Halifax|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p2934.htm#i29332|website=The Peerage.com|accessdate=23 July 2017|location=Wellington, New Zealand|date=16 May 2015|postscript=. Self-published but with cited sources.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents had six daughters, and one son, who would become [[George Montagu-Dunk, 2nd Earl of Halifax]], after changing his surname when he married the heiress Anne Richards, a legatee of Sir Thomas Dunk.{{sfn|Rizzo|2008|pp=32, 299}} Upon their father's death, each of his daughters was apportioned £5,000. Lady Bab's income was placed in an annuity giving her an annual income of around £100.{{sfn|Rizzo|2008|p=32}}

==Later life==
Though unacceptable for unmarried women to live alone in the period, Lady Bab, who suffered from a serious heart condition, was unsuited for marriage, or taking residence with any of her sisters, as she could not bear the hectic pace of court life.{{sfn|Rizzo|2008|p=299}}
In 1748 Montigue met [[Sarah Scott]], an English novelist and translator, who was the daughter of Elizabeth (née Drake) and Matthew Robinson, both from distinguished Yorkshire families. One of twelve children, Sarah was close to her sister [[Elizabeth Montagu]], a leader of the [[Blue Stockings Society]], when they were growing up.&lt;ref name="ODNB-Kelly" /&gt; But, after Sarah's severe bout with [[smallpox]] in 1741, she was deemed no longer a suitable catch for marriage and instead sought solace in writing.{{sfn|Rizzo|2008|p=296}} The two women, unable to find a place in the patriarchal society, forged a household together in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] among a community of women who found themselves in similar circumstances.{{sfn|Rizzo|2008|pp=295, 310–311}} 

Lady Bab was involved in charitable works, such as creating educational cards to sell with the proceeds dedicated to assist a poor neighbor. The cards contained geographical, historical, and mathematical facts and were used as flash cards. She was also involved in a scheme, which she encouraged Sarah to join, to have poor women knit mittens, that they then sold to their circle of friends. Montagu inspired her companion's dedication to charity and Sarah began holding Sunday school classes for children.{{sfn|Rizzo|2008|p=310}} When Scott married in 1751, it was understood that Lady Bab was to be part of the household. In less than a year, Sarah's father and brother removed her from her marital home&lt;ref name="ODNB-Kelly" /&gt; and the two women rejoined the community in Bath. The separation agreement left Sarah with only a small allowance, as her husband returned only a portion of her [[dowry]], making the pooling of the women's resources a necessity.{{sfn|Rizzo|2008|p=305}}{{sfn|Elliott|2002|p=35}}

Among the women in their community, which included Elizabeth Cutts, [[Sarah Fielding]] and possibly [[Jane Collier]], was an agreement that they would support each other psychologically and financially, so that they did not become dependent on others. They encouraged each other to publish, to raise funds to complete charitable works.{{sfn|Rizzo|2008|p=307}} For example, Lady Bab paid for the publishing of a book, ''The Histories of Some of the Penitents in the Magdalen House, as Supposed to Be Related by Themselves'' which was printed anonymously in 1759 so that its royalties might support the author.{{sfn|Ogborn|1998|p=53}} The book deals with penitent prostitutes and the preface, written by Lady Bab, defends the benefits of charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wiebe|first1=Heather|title=Spectacles of Sin and Suffering: ''La Traviata'' in Victorian London|journal=repercussions|date=Fall 2001|volume=9|issue=2|page=41|url=https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~repercus/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/repercussions-Vol.-9-No.-2-Wiebe-Heather-Spectacles-of-Sin-and-Suffering.pdf|accessdate=23 July 2017|publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]]|location=Berkeley, California}}&lt;/ref&gt; They organized a small [[industrial school]] to teach basic skills to poor girls, as well as a few boys. In 1763, Lady Barbara gained a pension of £300, significantly improving their circumstances.&lt;ref name="ODNB-Kelly" /&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Montagu died in August 1765{{sfn|Rizzo|2008|p=313}} and was buried in the [[Church of St Mary, Charlcombe]].{{sfn|Ibbetson|1793|p=140}} Per instructions in her will, she returned the £100 annuity her brother had given her in her lifetime. She left over £1,000 to two of her sisters, various members of their community, servants, students she was assisting with education, with the bulk of her estate going to Scott, outright—stating that should Scott remarry, the monies could not come under the control of a spouse.{{sfn|Rizzo|2008|p=314}} Scott lived for thirty years after the death of Montagu, benefiting from her largess and adhering to the charitable principles they had established together.{{sfn|Rizzo|2008|p=315}}

[[File:Bogo Grafenauer 1968.jpg|thumbnail|Bogo Grafenauer in 1968]]
'''Bogo Grafenauer''' (16 March 1916&amp;nbsp;– 12 May 1995) was a [[Slovenia]]n historian, who mostly wrote about [[medieval history]] in the [[Slovene Lands]]. Together with [[Milko Kos]], [[Fran Zwitter]], and [[Vasilij Melik]], he was one of the founders of the so-called [[Ljubljana school of historiography]].

== Early life ==
He was born in [[Ljubljana]] in a well-established [[Carinthian Slovenes|Carinthian Slovene]] family. His father, [[Ivan Grafenauer]], was a famous literary historian and ethnologist and nephew of [[Franc Grafenauer]], a representative in the [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]]n provincial assembly. He was the brother of the mineralogist [[Stanko Grafenauer]] and designer and choreographer [[Marija Grafenauer-Vogelnik]].

He studied [[history]] at the [[University of Ljubljana]], graduating in 1940. In his college years, he joined the [[Christian left]] intellectual circle around [[Edvard Kocbek]]. After the [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, he joined the [[Liberation Front of the Slovenian People]]. Between 1942 and 1943, the [[Italian Fascism|Italian Fascist]] occupation authorities interned him in the [[Gonars concentration camp]]. Nevertheless, he managed to complete his PhD dissertation in 1944 under the supervision of the [[medievalist]] [[Milko Kos]].

== Career ==
Grafenauer started publishing already in the late 1930s. In his academic career, Grafenauer focused on [[social history]] in the [[Middle Ages]]. He continued the researches of Milko Kos on settlements patterns in the [[Slovene Lands]] in the [[early middle ages]], focusing on the [[Slavic settlement of the Eastern Alps]] and the medieval [[Slavs|Slavic]] principality of [[Carantania]]. He wrote several treatises on the transition between tribal and feudal socio-economic forms in the Eastern Alps and the west [[Balkans]]. His main contribution was however the history of the [[German Peasants' War]]s in the late 15th and 16th century in the Slovene Lands and in [[Croatia]]. He also wrote on the history of the [[Slovenes]] in Carinthia in the 19th and 20th centuries, and on agricultural modernization in the early 19th century. Since the 1950s and 1960s, he was among those who introduced the approaches of the French [[Annales school]] in the Yugoslav historiography.

Between 1945 and 1955, he wrote several expert surveys on border areas in [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]] and the [[Julian March]] for the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] diplomacy.

From 1946 to 1982, he taught Slovene medieval history and theory of [[historiography]] at the University of Ljubljana. In 1972, he became a member of the [[Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts]]. He was also a member of the [[Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts]] and the [[Academy of Sciences and Arts of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Between 1978 and 1987, he served as president of the publishing house ''[[Slovenska matica]]''; during his presidency, Grafenauer hired several prominent external collaborators, some of whom (like [[Ivo Urbančič]], [[Tine Hribar]] and [[Drago Jančar]]) had been persecuted by the [[Communist regime]], raising the quality and reputation of the institution.

In the last decade of his life, Grafenauer rose to prominence again with his resolute fight against [[autochthonist]] re-interpretations of Slovenian history, especially against the populist [[Venetic theory]], which denied the Slavic settlement in the East Alps.

Bogo Grafenauer died in Ljubljana and was buried in the [[Žale]] cemetery. His daughter, [[Darja Mihelič]], is also a historian.

'''Brazilians in Guyana''' consists of Brazilian nationals, mostly miners, living in [[Guyana]] as well as Guyanese people of Brazilian descent.

==History==
Brazilian mining in Guyana goes back to the early nineties. The influx of Brazilians into the country was largely a result of Brazil's recent mining policies. Significant federal enactments in the early 1990s, saw mining areas curtailed, and mining activity severely restricted, in part due to the growing environmental concern for forest land.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.landofsixpeoples.com/news02/ns206097.htm The Brazilian presence in Guyana]", ''[[Stabroek News]]'', 9 June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In Brazil, the issue of mining in areas like [[Roraima]] was also linked to the rights of indigenous peoples. Thus, the influx of Brazilians into the [[mining industry in Guyana]] can be seen as a recent phenomenon.

The border between Brazil and Guyana is long and porous. While some high-income Brazilian miners and workers can afford the plane journey from [[Boa Vista International Airport|Boa Vista]] as a means of entering the country, others use the time-tested routes of land and water.

==Illegal immigration==
Many Brazilian miners came to Guyana illegally. Guyanese police have regularly raided Brazilian hotels to apprehend illegal residents.

'''Buycott.com''' is an Internet-based platform and smart-phone application that reads the [[Universal Product Code]]s (UPC) barcode on a product, and suggests whether a consumer should buy or avoid that product based on how well it aligns with the consumer's values and principles. The consumer joins to various Buycott campaigns to indicate their support or their opposition to various issues and topics. The app advises them about purchasing from corporate entities - and their affiliates - that endorse policies which conflict with those campaigns. The consumer can thus "vote with their wallet", and opt to purchase a competing product, or forgo the purchase altogether.&lt;ref name="Dell Tech Page One"/&gt;

Buycott.com was launched to encourage [[Corporate Social Responsibility]], prior to the point of purchase, and raise awareness that consumer purchases have real-world consequences. The app has a rich database behind the web interface, and uses over 20 million {{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} [[Universal Product Code|UPC]] tags as unique product identifiers.&lt;ref name=Forbes/&gt; Buycott.com also queries consumer activists for scanned product information when the database is missing product descriptions or other information, each campaign's database relevancy and success is dependent upon the membership's participation.&lt;ref name=BuycottABCnews/&gt;   As of March 2015, the largest activist campaign is Demand GMO Labeling, a group of more than 176,000 activists, that primarily targets firms who donated funds towards the defeat of [[California Proposition 37 (2012)|California's Proposition 39]]. Proposition 39 would have required the labeling of [[genetically modified food]]s.&lt;ref name=demand-gmo-labeling/&gt;

The '''Cactus and Succulent Society of America''' (CSSA) was founded in 1929, in [[Pasadena, California]] and has grown to encompass over 80 affiliated clubs and thousands of members worldwide. The primary purpose of the society is to enjoy [[succulent]] (water-storing) plants through horticulture, travel and scientific discovery, with a particular concern for habitat preservation and conservation issues in deserts worldwide.

The '''Canadian Association of Former Parliamentarians''' (CAFP) is a non-profit organization, established by an Act of the [[House of Commons of Canada|Parliament of Canada]], the membership of which is composed of former members of the [[Senate of Canada|Senate]] or [[House of Commons of Canada]].

==History==

On May 29, 1996, legislation establishing the Canadian Association of Former Parliamentarians was adopted.  Concurrently, thirty-four bronze plaques, representing the thirty-four parliaments to that time, and containing the names of all persons who had served in the Senate and House of Commons to that time, were unveiled in the Visitors Centre of the House of Commons.&lt;ref name=Turnerart&gt;[[Barry Turner (politician)|J. Barry Turner]],  [http://www.exparl.ca/documents/Barry%20Turner%20Article-e.pdf "Canadian Association of Former Parliamentarians"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706180544/http://www.exparl.ca/documents/Barry%20Turner%20Article-e.pdf |date=2011-07-06 }}. ''[[Canadian Parliamentary Review]]'', Autumn, 1996.  As reprinted by [http://www.exparl.ca The Canadian Association of Former Parliamentarians].  Retrieved 2011-01-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The association was created in response to a 1985 recommendation of a Special Committee on Reform of The House of Commons, chaired by [[James McGrath (Canadian politician)|James McGrath]].&lt;ref name = Turnerart/&gt; It is modeled after the [[United States Association of Former Members of Congress]], founded in 1970.&lt;ref name = Turnerart/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://usafmc.org/about-fmc/history/ History of The United States Association of Former Members of Congress].

Charisse Tia Maria Coston and [[Freda Adler]] in their book ''Victimizing Vulnerable Groups'' analyzed the reasons behind the low crime rate in Bahrain. The society of Bahrain follows the teachings of the [[Qur'an]]; the Qur'an influences political, economic and social environment. [[Islam]], which is most important in the structure of Bahraini society, teaches wrongdoings will result in downfall of societies and try to uproot crime by exerting influence upon human conscience.&lt;ref name="VVG221"&gt;{{cite book

Bahrain is a destination country for men and women [[Human trafficking|trafficked]] for the purposes of involuntary servitude and commercial sexual exploitation. Men and women from [[Africa]], South Asia and [[Southeast Asia]] migrate voluntarily to Bahrain to work as laborers or domestic servants where some face conditions of involuntary servitude such as unlawful withholding of passports, restrictions on movements, non-payment of wages, threats and physical or sexual abuse. Women from [[Eastern Europe]], [[Central Asia]], Southeast Asian country like [[Thailand]] and [[North Africa]]n nation like [[Morocco]] are trafficked to Bahrain for the purpose of commercial sexual exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ba.html Bahrain] ''[[The World Factbook]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Threat of [[Terrorism|terrorist attack]] is a matter of concern.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travelling-and-living-overseas/travel-advice-by-country/middle-east-north-africa/bahrain Bahrain] [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]] (DFAT) of the [[Government of Australia]] advised travelers "to exercise a high degree of caution in Bahrain" due to high threat of terrorism. According to the DFAT, terrorists can target shopping areas, supermarkets, embassies, hotels, restaurants, clubs, cinemas and theaters, schools, places of worship, outdoor recreation events and tourist areas.&lt;ref name=DFAT/&gt;

In the [[Corruption Perceptions Index]] 2007, Bahrain was ranked 46th out of 179 countries for corruption (least corrupt countries are at the top of the list). On a scale of 0 to 10 with 0 the most corrupt and 10 the most transparent, [[Transparency International]] rated Bahrain 5.0.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2007 Corruption Perceptions Index 2007] [[Transparency International]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''demographic history of Montenegro''' can be shown through [[census]] results and official documents which mention demographic composition. 

== Medieval ==
Duklja, today's southern half of Montenegro, under [[Stefan Vojislav]], was inhabited by [[Montenegrins]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Early Medieval Balkans'' by John Van Antwerp Fine, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

Various documents listed that the inhabitants of Medieval [[Duklja|Doclea]] or ''Zeta'' were Serbs, but also minor populations of [[Italic peoples|Latins]], [[Albanians]] and [[Vlachs]]. The language in usage was primarily the [[Old Church Slavonic|Old Slavonic]], while in the early stages [[Latin]] also had importance and [[Greek language|Greek]] to an extent among the high-class members of the society.

Between the 15th and 17th century, Montenegro had little history on paper. During these years, hundreds of families of [[Montenegrins]] moved to Rascia which Serbs left to sought refuge in Habsburg Monarchy.

==1614==
[[Mariano Bolizza]] of [[Kotor]] was a public servant of the Republic of Venice. The main objective of his 1614 report and description of the [[Sanjak of Shkodra]] was to provide information on the land routes which could best be utilized by local couriers conveying official correspondence from Venice to Constantinople and back, and to survey the military potential of the territory. He provided a very detailed overview of towns and villages in Montenegro and northern Albania in the early 17th century. The report concluded an ethnic Montenegrin majority, while an Albanian minority was present in the Shkodra region.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.montenegrina.net/pages/pages_e/history/report_and_description_of_the_sanjak_of_shkodra1614.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==18th century==
The ethnic composition in the 18th century was clear among the Slavs;

*In a letter to [[Justinian Bert]] in 1756, [[Serb clans|Montenegrin chieftains]] said: ''"We are of the Orthodox Christian faith and law of the [[Eastern Church]], of the honorable and glorious [[Serbs|Slav-Serb kin]]"''.
*Jovan Stefanov Balevic, of the [[Bratonožići|Bratonožić]] [[Tribes of Montenegro|clan]], who later became a major in the [[Russian army]], wrote "A brief and objective description of the present state of Montenegro"&lt;ref name=SM/&gt; in [[St. Petersburg]] in 1757, where it said: ''"All inhabitants of Montenegro are ethnically Serbs and confessionally [[Eastern Orthodox|Orthodox]]. As they are incompetent in some skills, because of their lack of school, they are naturally capable, especially with weapons."''; ''"The number of Montenegrin warriors who live free on the peaks of Montenegro, called by [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] disobedient, does not exceed 5000."''; ''"There are no artisans and schools in Montenegro except at the Cetinje monastery, within the archbishop's residence, where priests learn reading and writing in the Slav-Serb language, which is financed by the archbishop."''; ''"Montenegrins count among themselves neighbouring Slav-Serbs of different provenience: [[Kuči|Kuci]], [[Bratonozici]], Donji and Gornji [[Vasojevici]], [[Piperi clan|Piperi]], Rovcani, Moracani, [[Bjelopavlići (clan)|Bjelopavlici]], who are [[Serbian Orthodox]] but [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] citizens. They, also, count [[Roman Catholics]]: [[Hoti (Albanians)|Hoti]], [[Klimenti]], Grudi, [[Tuzi]], Skrivali, Huzi, Maltezi, Kastrati and others who outnumber Montenegrins."''&lt;ref name=SM&gt;[http://www.njegos.org/past/balevicen.htm Short historic-geographical description of Montenegro]- [[Jovan Stefanov Balevic]]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Metropolitan Sava called his people, the Montenegrins, by the "Serbian nation" (1766).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Diverse forces in Yugoslavia: 1941-1945|isbn=9781556660535|last=Vukcevich|first=Bosko S.|year=1990|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FJJpAAAAMAAJ|page=379|quote=Sava Petrovich [...] Serbian nation (nacion)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In June 1789, [[Serb clans|Montenegrin Chieftains]], wrote to [[Russia]]n Empress [[Katarina II]], in the name of the entire [[Serb Montenegrin]] community: "We Serbs Montenegrins hope that we shall not be left without help" and "If we could have organization and munition, we would liberate our glorious [[Serb lands]] entirely from the Barbarian yoke ([[Ottoman Empire]]), together with our armed Serb brothers who aim to attack this enemy from all sides.

==19th century==
* According to the census conducted in 1863 and 1864, the [[Principality of Montenegro]] had a total of 196.230 inhabitants, 99.889 male and 96.339 female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Sundečić|first= Jovan, ed.|date= 1865|title= Orlić: Crnogorski godišnjak stari i novi za prostu godinu 1865.|url= |location=Cetinje |publisher= Kneževska pečatnja|page= 75|isbn= |author-link=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Bernard Schwartz estimated in 1882 that the Princedom of Montenegro had 160,000 inhabitants. Although, a more usual estimate is that it was around 230,000 inhabitants.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== 1900 ==

In 1900, according to international sources, the Principality of Montenegro had 311,564 inhabitants. By religion:
* 293,527 [[Metropolitanate of Montenegro and the Littoral|Orthodox Christians]] (94.21%)
* 12,493 [[Islam|Muslims]] (4.01%)
* 5,544 [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Christians]] (1.78%)

By literacy:
* ''77%'' illiterate
* 71,528 (''23%'') literate

The Princedom had around 5,000 [[Albanians in Montenegro|Albanians]] and a colony of 800 [[Romani people|Romani]].

== 1905 ==
This year there were 6,674 emigrants, mostly to the [[United States]].

== 1906 ==
This year there were 4,346 emigrants, mostly to the United States.

== 1907 ==
It has been estimated that there were around 282,000 inhabitants in Montenegro this year.

== 1909 ==
[[Image:Montenegro1910.gif|thumb|right|Map from 1910&lt;br /&gt; Dark - Serbs; Light - Albanians]]
The 1909 official census was undertaken by the authorities of the Principality of [[Montenegro]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.njegos.org/census/index.htm|title=Montenegrin Census' from 1909 to 2003|last=Raković|first=Aleksandar|date=|website=www.njegos.org|access-date=2017-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnicity was decided according to the [[mother tongue]] and [[religion]], the [[official language]] being the [[Serbian language]]:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Total: 317,856 inhabitants. By language:
* [[Serbs]]: ~95%&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
* others mostly [[Albanian language|Albanian]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

By religion:
* [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]]: ''94.38%''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  
* ''others'' (mostly [[Muslims]])&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

== 1911 ==
In 1911, the population of Montenegro had risen to 211,909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Palairet|first=Michael|title=The Balkan Economies C.1800-1914: Evolution Without Development|year=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-58051-X|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hkQytxTkZcoC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=1911+population+of+montenegro&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=RtbjTJrIGpOKhQeRt7GrDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=1911%20population%20of%20montenegro&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a geographic textbook for Montenegrin 3rd graders of [[elementary school]], it was written that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''"In Montenegro live only true and pure Serbs who speak [[Serbian language]]... Besides Montenegro there are more [[Serb lands]] in which our Serb brothers are living... Some of them are free as we are and some subjugated to foreigners[...] Each Serb in Montenegro is obligated to love his entire Fatherland, all Serb lands - in which our free and unfree Serb brothers are living."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.njegos.org/heritage/educat.htm Education in Montenegro]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== 1913-1914 ==
[[File:Pozak105.jpg|thumb|Code of Law 1914.]]
The Cetinje government stated in the Code of Law in 1914 that there are around 500,000 citizens of Montenegro. It was declared that the term ''Montenegrin people'' can only refer to all citizens of the Kingdom of Montenegro, since a Montenegrin ethnicity doesn't exist and [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]] were seen as ethnic [[Serbs]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== 1921 ==
In 1918 Montenegro entered the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]]. In 1921 it organised a census which recorded the mother tongue and religion. A category called ''Serbian or Croatian'' was to include all respondents who termed their mother tongue as Serbian.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} In the counties [[Andrijevica]], [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]], [[Kolasin]], [[Niksic]], [[Podgorica]] and [[Cetinje]], which are categorized in official statistics as Montenegro, there were:

Total: 199,227 inhabitants
*[[Serbo-Croatian|Serbian or Croatian]]: 181,989 (''91.35%'')
*[[Albanians|Albanian]]: 16,838 (''8.45%'')

The counties [[Berane]] and [[Bijelo Polje]], which are today in Montenegro, were considered counties of [[Old Serbia]]:

*[[Berane]], total 23,864 inhabitants, [[Serbs]] 23,561 or (''98.73%'')
*[[Bijelo Polje]], total 26,147 inhabitants, [[Serbs]] 26,136 (''99.96%'')

Summed results:

Total: 249,238 inhabitants
*Serbs or Croats: 231,686 (''92.96%'')
*others, mostly [[Albanians]]

Total population for the area of modern-day Montenegro in precise was 311,341.

== 1931 ==
The 1931 census was also taken by the Kingdom of Yugoslavia but was later processed in [[Democratic Federal Yugoslavia|Communist Yugoslavia]]. Results within today's borders of Montenegro were:

This census witnessed the forming of the [[Bosniaks|Bosniak]] nation, but some people still thought of themselves [[Muslims by nationality]], however. Also, there are very few people left who consider themselves Yugoslavs. But the biggest difference compared to the 1991 census is the dramatic increase in self-identification of many inhabitants as Serbs, which was not the case in [[Socialist Yugoslavia]].

The '''Dogon languages''' are a small, close-knit [[language family]] spoken by the [[Dogon people]] of [[Mali]], which is generally believed to belong to the larger [[Niger–Congo family]]. There are about 600,000 speakers of a dozen languages. They are [[tonal language]]s – most, like [[Dogul Dogon|Dogul]], having two tones; some, like [[Donno so|Donno So]], having three. The basic word order is [[subject–object–verb]].

==Classification==
The evidence linking Dogon to the [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger–Congo family]] is weak, and their place within the family, assuming they do belong, is not clear.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Various theories have been proposed, placing them in [[Gur languages|Gur]], [[Mande languages|Mande]], or as an independent branch, the last now being the preferred approach. The Dogon languages show no remnants of the [[noun class]] system characteristic of much of Niger–Congo, leading linguists to conclude that they likely diverged from Niger–Congo very early.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Roger Blench comments,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rogerblench.info/Language/Niger-Congo/Dogon/Dogon%20page.htm Dogon Languages] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615111624/http://www.rogerblench.info/Language/Niger-Congo/Dogon/Dogon%20page.htm |date=June 15, 2013 }} Retrieved May 19, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Dogon is both lexically and structurally very different from most other [Niger–Congo] families. It lacks the noun-classes usually regarded as typical of Niger–Congo and has a word order (SOV) that resembles Mande and Ịjọ, but not the other branches. The system of verbal inflections, resembling French is quite unlike any surrounding languages. As a consequence, the ancestor of Dogon is likely to have diverged very early, although the present-day languages probably reflect an origin some 3–4000 years ago. Dogon languages are territorially coherent, suggesting that, despite local migration histories, the Dogon have been in this area of Mali from their origin.}}

{{quote|Dogon is certainly a well-founded and coherent group. But it has no characteristic Niger–Congo features (noun-classes, verbal extensions, [[labial–velar consonant|labial-velars]]) and very few lexical cognates. It could equally well be an independent language family.}}

The [[Bambara language|Bamana]] and [[Fula language]]s have exerted significant influence on Dogon, due to their close cultural and geographical ties.

[[Roger Blench|Blench]] (2015) suggests that [[Bangime language|Bangime]] and Dogon languages may have a substratum from a "missing" branch of [[Nilo-Saharan]] that had split off relatively early from Proto-Nilo-Saharan, and tentatively calls that branch "Plateau".&lt;ref&gt;Blench, Roger. 2015. [https://www.academia.edu/15754234/Was_there_a_now-vanished_branch_of_Nilo-Saharan_on_the_Dogon_Plateau_Evidence_from_substrate_vocabulary_in_Bangime_and_Dogon Was there a now-vanished branch of Nilo-Saharan on the Dogon Plateau? Evidence from substrate vocabulary in Bangime and Dogon]. In ''Mother Tongue'', Issue 20, 2015: In Memory of Harold Crane Fleming (1926-2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Languages==
The Dogon consider themselves a single ethnic group, but recognise that their languages are different. In Dogon cosmology, Dogon constitutes six of the twelve languages of the world (the others being [[Fula language|Fulfulde]], [[Mossi language|Mooré]], [[Bambara language|Bambara]], [[Bozo language|Bozo]] and [[Tamasheq language|Tamasheq]]).&lt;ref&gt;The last is not mentioned in Hochstetler's sources.&lt;/ref&gt; Jamsay is thought to be the original Dogon language, but the Dogon "recognise a myriad of tiny distinctions even between parts of villages and sometimes individuals, and strive to preserve these". (Hochstetler 2004:18)

The best-studied Dogon language is the [[Bandiagara Escarpment|escarpment]] language [[Toro So dialect|Toro So]] (Tɔrɔ sɔɔ) of [[Sangha, Mali|Sanga]], due to [[Marcel Griaule]]'s studies there and because Toro So was selected as one of thirteen [[national language]]s of Mali. It is [[mutually intelligible]] with other escarpment varieties. However, the plains languages—Tene Ka, Tomo Ka, and Jamsay, which are not intelligible with Toro so—have more speakers, and [[Jamsai Dogon|Jamsay]] and [[Tommo So|Tommo so]] are most conservative linguistically.

Calame-Griaule appears to have been the first to work out the various varieties of Dogon. Calame-Griaule (1956) classified the languages as follows, with accommodation given for languages which have since been discovered (new Dogon languages were reported as late as 2005), or have since been shown to be mutually intelligible (as Hochstetler confirmed for the escarpment dialects). The two standard languages are asterisked.

*'''Plains Dogon''': [[Jamsai Dogon|Jamsai]],* [[Toro-tegu Dogon|Tɔrɔ tegu]], [[Western Plains Dogon|Western Plains]] (dialects: Togo kã, Tengu kã, Tomo kã)
*'''[[Escarpment Dogon]]''' (dialects: Tɔrɔ sɔɔ,* Tɔmmɔ sɔɔ, Donno sɔ {{sm|aka}} Kamma sɔ)
*'''West Dogon''': [[Duleri Dogon|Duleri]], [[Mombo Dogon|Mombo]], [[Ampari Dogon|Ampari]]–[[Penange Dogon|Penange]]; [[Budu Dogon|Budu]]
*'''North Plateau Dogon''': [[Bondum Dogon|Bondum]], [[Dogul Dogon|Dogul]]
*'''[[Yanda Dogon|Yanda]]'''
*'''Nanga''': [[Nanga Dogon|Naŋa]], [[Bankan Tey Dogon|Bankan Tey]] (Walo), [[Ben Tey Dogon|Ben Tey]]
*'''[[Tebul Dogon|Tebul]]'''

Douyon and Blench (2005) report an additional variety, which is as yet unclassified:
*[[Ana Dogon|Ana Tiŋa]].

Blench noted that the plural suffix on nouns suggests that Budu is closest to Mombo, so it has been tentatively included as West Dogon above. He also notes that Walo–Kumbe is lexically similar to Naŋa; Hochstetler suspects it may be Naŋa. The similarities between these languages may be shared with Yanda. These are all extremely poorly known.

==Pre-Dogon language==
[[Bangi-me]] ({{sm|aka}} Baŋgɛri mɛ), formerly considered a divergent branch of Dogon, turns out not to be Dogon at all, and is possibly a [[language isolate]] (Blench 2005b). Blench believes that it is a remnant of the pre-Dogon languages of the area; the Dogon appear to have been in the area for many thousands of years.

Additionally, Blench (2015)&lt;ref&gt;Blench, Roger. 2015. [https://www.academia.edu/31732956/Was_there_a_now-vanished_branch_of_Nilo-Saharan_on_the_Dogon_Plateau_Evidence_from_substrate_vocabulary_in_Bangime_and_Dogon Was there a now-vanished branch of Nilo-Saharan on the Dogon Plateau? Evidence from substrate vocabulary in Bangime and Dogon]. ''Mother Tongue'', Issue 20, 2015: In Memory of Harold Crane Fleming (1926-2015).&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that there is a [[Nilo-Saharan]] [[stratum (linguistics)|substratum]] in the Dogon languages, with the Nilo-Saharan substrate being a currently extinct branch of Nilo-Saharan that Blench tentatively refers to as "Plateau."

The largest groups in this category include [[Persian people|Persians]] (who form the majority of the Iranian population) and [[Kurdish people|Kurds]], with smaller communities including [[Gilaki people|Gilakis]], [[Mazandarani people|Mazandaranis]], [[Lurs]], [[Tat people (Iran)|Tats]], [[Talysh people|Talysh]], and [[Baloch people|Baloch]].

[[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] groups constitute a substantial minority of about 15–24%, the largest group being the [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijani]], who are the second largest ethnicity in Iran as well as the largest minority group.&lt;ref name="books.google.nl"&gt;Brenda Shaffer.

6 million Persians (60%), 
2.5 million Azeris (25%), 
0.2 million Mazandaranis and Gilakis each (2% each).&lt;ref&gt;Ervand Abrahimian, "A History of Modern Iran", Cambridge University Press, 2008.

==Iranian-speaking peoples==
{{further information|Iranian peoples|Persian peoples}}

===Persians===
{{Main article|Persian people}}

Iran used to be called [[Persia]] until 1935, by that definition all Iranians were considered '''Persian''' regardless of their ethnicity. The term "Persians" refers to an ethnic group who speak the Western dialect of [[Persian language|Persian]] and live in the modern country of Iran as well as the descendants of the people who emigrated from the territory of modern-day Iran to other countries.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

{{citation needed span|Ethnic Persians inhabit traditionally the [[Tehran province]], [[Isfahan province]], [[Fars province]], [[Alborz province]], [[Razavi Khorasan]], [[South Khorasan]], [[Yazd province]], [[Kerman province]], [[Bushehr province]], [[Hormozgan province]], [[Markazi province]] (Arak), [[Qom province]], [[Semnan province]], [[Qazvin province]], the majority of [[Hamadan province]] including the city of Hamadan, majority of the [[North Khorasan]], majority of [[Khuzestan province]], northern half of [[Sistan and Baluchistan]] (Zabol), southern and western half of [[Golestan province]] including the provincial capital of Gorgan.|date=March 2013}}
The majority of the Iranian immigrants in the West and other parts of the world also hail from Persian speaking cities especially from [[Tehran]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

According to the [[CIA World Factbook]], [[Persian people|Persians]] in Iran constitute up to 61% of the country's population.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2075.html |title=The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cia.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ir.html |title=The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-09-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203093100/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ir.html |archivedate=3 February 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another source, [[Library of Congress]] &lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;See Iran in Encyclopedia of Islam, Leiden. C.E. Bosworth (editor)&lt;/ref&gt; states Iran's [[Persian people|Persians]] compose 65% of the country's population.&lt;ref name="LibraryOfCongress"/&gt; However, other sources mention that Persians only comprise 50.5%,&lt;ref name="terrorfreetomorrow1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.terrorfreetomorrow.org/upimagestft/TFT%20Iran%20Survey%20Report%200609.pdf |format=PDF |title=Terror Free Tomorrow: Ahmadinejad Front Runner in Upcoming Presidential Elections; |publisher=Terrorfreetomorrow.org |accessdate=2015-09-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723044939/http://www.terrorfreetomorrow.org/upimagestft/TFT%20Iran%20Survey%20Report%200609.pdf |archivedate=23 July 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; or 55.3%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gulf2000.columbia.edu/images/maps/Iran_Languages_lg.jpg ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131001091018/http://gulf2000.columbia.edu/images/maps/Iran_Languages_lg.jpg |date=1 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All these numbers include the [[Mazandarani people|Mazandaranis]] and [[Gilaki people|Gilakis]] as Persian people, though the CIA [[World Factbook]] makes a distinction between the Persian language and the [[Mazandarani language|Mazandarani]] and [[Gilaki language]], respectively.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cia.gov"/&gt;

===Kurds===
{{Main article|Kurds|Iranian Kurdistan}}

Iranian Kurds make up the majority of the population of Kordestan province, and, together with the Azeris, they are one of the two main ethnic groups in West Azerbaijan province.  In West Azerbaijan province, Kurds are concentrated in parts of the southern and western parts of the province.  The Feyli tribe of Kurds also make up a significant proportion of the populations of Kermanshah and Ilam provinces,{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} although Kermanshahi and Ilamian Kurds are Shia Muslims, in contrast to the mainstream Kurds, who are adherents of Sunni Islam. [[Kurmanji language|Kurmanji]]-speaking Kurds also form a plurality in North Khorasan province.

=== Mazandaranis ===

{{Main article|Mazanderani people}}
 		
The [[Mazanderani people]] &lt;ref&gt;Area handbook for Iran, Harvey Henry Smith, American University (Washington, D.C.), Foreign Area Studies, page 89&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Tabari people]] are an Iranian people whose homeland is the North of Iran (Tabaristan). Like the closely related [[Gilaks]], the [[Mazanderanis]] are a Caspian people who inhabit the south coast of the Caspian Sea, part of the historical region that used to be called [[Tabaristan]] and are currently one of the main ethnic groups residing in the northern parts of Iran. They speak the [[Mazandarani language]], a language native to around 4 million people, but all of them can speak Persian. The Alborz mountains mark the southern boundary of Mazanderani settlement.&lt;ref&gt;Dalb, Andrew (1998). Dictionary of Languages: The Definitive Reference to More Than 400 Languages. Columbia University Press. p. 226. {{ISBN|0-231-11568-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mazanderani peoples number differs between three million and four million (2006 estimate) and many of them are farmers and fishermen.&lt;ref&gt;Middle East Patterns: Places, Peoples, and Politics By Colbert C. Held, John Cummings, Mildred McDonald Held,2005, page 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gilaks===
{{Main article|Gilaks}}

The [[Gilaki people]] or Gilaks are an Iranian people native to the northern Iran province of [[Gilan]] and are one of the main ethnic groups residing in the northern part of Iran. Gilaks, along with the closely related [[Mazandarani people]], comprise part of the Caspian people, who inhabit the southern and southwestern coastal regions of the [[Caspian Sea]]. They speak the [[Gilaki language]] and their population is estimated to be between 3 &lt;ref&gt;Colbert C. Held; John Cummings; Mildred McDonald Held (2005). Middle East Patterns: Places, Peoples, and Politics. p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; to 4 &lt;ref&gt;"Iran Provinces". statoids.com.&lt;/ref&gt; million (4% of the population). Gilaki people live both alongside the Alborz mountains, and in the surrounding plains. Consequentially, those living along the northern side of the Alborz mountains tend to raise livestock, while those living in the plains farm. Gilaks play an important role in provincial and national economy, supplying a large portion of the region's agricultural staples, such as rice, grains,&lt;ref&gt;M. ʿAṭāʾī, “Gozāreš-e eqteṣādī dar bāra-ye berenj-e Gīlān wa sāyer-e ḡallāt-e ān/Economic Report on Rice and Other Cereals in Gilan,” Taḥqīqāt-e eqteṣādī 2/5-6, 1342 Š., pp. 64-148 (Pers. ed.), 1963, pp. 32-53 (Eng. ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; tobacco &lt;ref&gt;Idem, “La culture du tabac dans le Gilân,” Stud.

Encyclopædia Iranica, X/VI, pp. 617-25. Retrieved 19 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lurs===
{{Main article|Lurs}}
'''Lur people''' speak the [[Lurish language|Luri]] language and inhabit parts of west – south western [[Iran]].&lt;ref name="culturalsurvival1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/iran/lurs-iran |title=The Lurs of Iran |publisher=Cultural Survival |date= |accessdate=2015-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Lur are Shi’a. They are the fourth largest [[ethnic group]] in Iran after the [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Azerbaijani people|Azeri]], and [[Kurds]].&lt;ref name="terrorfreetomorrow1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CIA World Factbook Iran" /&gt; They occupy [[Lorestan]], [[Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari Province|Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari]], [[Khuzestan Province|Khuzestan]], [[Isfahan Province|Isfahan]], [[Fars Province|Fars]], [[Bushehr Province|Bushehr]] and [[Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad Province|Kuh-Gilu-Boir Ahmed]] provinces.&lt;ref name="culturalsurvival1"/&gt; The authority of tribal elders remains a strong influence among the nomadic population. It is not as dominant among the settled urban population.  As is true in [[Bakhtiari people|Bakhtiari]] and Kurdish societies, Lur women have much greater freedom than women in other groups within the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Edmonds, Cecil|url=https://books.google.com/?id=SzcyuAL7YOkC&amp;pg=PA188|title=East and West of Zagros: Travel, War and Politics in Persia and Iraq 1913–1921|page=188|isbn=9789004173446|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Luri language is [[Indo-European migrations|Indo-European]]. The Lur people may be related to the Kurds from whom they "apparently began to be distinguished from... 1,000 years ago." The [[Sharafnama]] of [[Sharaf Khan Bidlisi]] "mentioned two Lur dynasties among the five Kurdish dynasties that had in the past enjoyed royalty or the highest form of sovereignty or independence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gunter|first=Michael M.|title=Historical Dictionary of the Kurds|year=2011|edition=2nd|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0810867512|page=203|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zDRGO6EgapMC&amp;pg=PA203}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[Mu'jam Al-Buldan]] of [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]] mention is made of the Lurs as a [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] tribe living in the mountains between [[Khuzestan]] and [[Isfahan]]. The term Kurd according to [[Richard Frye]] was used for all Iranian nomads (including the population of Luristan as well as tribes in Kuhistan and Baluchis in Kerman) for all nomads, whether they were linguistically connected to the Kurds or not.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Frye,"The Golden age of Persia", Phoneix Press, 1975. Second Impression December 2003. pp 111: "Tribes always have been a feature of Persian history, but the sources are extremely scant in reference to them since they did not 'make' history. The general designation 'Kurd' is found in many Arabic sources, as well as in Pahlavi book on the deeds of Ardashir the first Sassanian ruler, for all nomads no matter whether they were linguistically connected to the Kurds of today or not. The population of Luristan, for example, was considered to be Kurdish, as were tribes in Kuhistan and Baluchis in Kirman"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Talysh===
{{Main article|Talysh people}}

The Talysh of Iran are about 430,000 and live mostly in the province of [[Gilan]] in north of Iran. They are indigenous to a region shared between [[Azerbaijan]] and Iran which spans the [[South Caucasus]] and the southwestern shore of the [[Caspian Sea]]. Another significant amount of Talysh live therefore also in the [[Republic of Azerbaijan]].&lt;ref name="Looklex"&gt;{{cite web|author=Tore Kjeilen |url=http://i-cias.com/e.o/talysh_l.htm |title=Talysh - LookLex Encyclopaedia |publisher=I-cias.com |date=2008-08-19 |accessdate=2015-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Turkmen ===
{{main article|Iranian Turkmen}}
[[Iranian Turkmen]] are primarily concentrated in the [[Provinces of Iran|provinces]] of [[Golestān Province|Golestān]] and [[North Khorasan Province|North Khorasan]]. The largest Turkmen city in Iran is [[Gonbad-e Qabus (city)|Gonbad-e Kavoos]], followed by [[Bandar Torkaman]]. Iranian Turkmen are mostly Sunni Muslims.

===Turkic tribal groups===
{{Main article|Qashqai people|Khorasani Turks|Afshar people|Qarai Turks}}
The [[Qashqai people]] mainly live in the provinces of [[Fars Province|Fars]], [[Khuzestan]] and southern [[Isfahan province|Isfahan]], especially around the city of [[Shiraz]] in Fars. They speak the [[Qashqai language]] which is a member of the [[Turkic languages|Turkic family of languages]]. The Qashqai were originally [[nomadic people|nomadic]] [[pastoralism|pastoralists]] and some remain so today. 
The traditional nomadic Qashqai travelled with their flocks each year from the summer highland pastures north of Shiraz roughly 480&amp;nbsp;km or 300&amp;nbsp;mi south to the winter pastures on lower (and warmer) lands near the [[Persian Gulf]], to the southwest of Shiraz. The majority, however, have now become partially or wholly sedentary. The trend towards settlement has been increasing markedly since the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/qasqai-tribal-confederacy-i |title=QAŠQĀʾI TRIBAL CONFEDERACY i.

=== Assyrians===
{{Main article|Assyrians in Iran}}

The [[Assyrian people]] of Iran are a [[Semitic people]] who speak [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic|modern Assyrian]], a [[neo-Aramaic language]] descended from [[Syriac language|Classical Syriac]], and are [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Rite Christians]] belonging mostly to the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] and, to a lesser extent, to the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]], [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] and [[Ancient Church of the East]].{{sfnp|Hooglund|2008|pp=100–101}} They claim descent from the ancient peoples of [[Mesopotamis]]. They share a common identity, rooted in shared linguistic and religious traditions, with [[Assyrians in Iraq]] and elsewhere in the Middle East such as [[Syria]] and [[Turkey]], as well as with the [[Assyrian–Chaldean–Syriac diaspora|Assyrian diaspora]].{{sfnp|Hooglund|2008|pp=100–101}}

The Assyrian community in Iran numbered approximately 200,000 prior to the [[Islamic Revolution]] of 1979. However, after the revolution many Assyrians left the country, primarily for the United States, and the 1996 census counted only 32,000 Assyrians.{{sfnp|Hooglund|2008|pp=100–101, 295}}  Current estimates of the Assyrian population in Iran range from 32,000 ({{as of|2005|lc=on}}){{sfnp|Hooglund|2008|p=295}} to 50,000 ({{as of|2007|lc=on}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aina.org/brief.html |title=Brief History of Assyrians |last=BetBasoo |first=Peter |date=1 April 2007 |website=[[Assyrian International News Agency]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6KKWk56jd?url=http://www.aina.org/brief.html |archivedate=13 October 2013 |accessdate=12 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Iranian capital, [[Tehran]], is home to the majority of Iranian Assyrians; however, approximately 15,000 Assyrians reside in northern Iran, in [[Urmia]] and various Assyrian villages in the surrounding area.{{sfnp|Hooglund|2008|pp=100–101}}

===Jews===
{{Main article|Persian Jews}}

Judaism is one of the oldest religions practiced in Iran and dates back to late biblical times. The biblical books of Isaiah, Daniel, Ezra, Nehemiah, Chronicles, and Esther contain references to the life and experiences of Jews in Iran.

By various estimates, 10,800 Jews&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/jewpop.html |title=Jewish Population of the World |publisher=Jewish Virtual Library |date= |accessdate=2015-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; remain in Iran, mostly in Tehran, Isfahan, and Shiraz. BBC reported Yazd is home to ten Jewish families, six of them related by marriage, however some{{Who|date=November 2016}} estimate the number is much higher. Historically, Jews maintained a presence in many more Iranian cities. Iran contains the largest Jewish population of any Muslim country except Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sephardicstudies.org/iran.html |title=IRAN: Life of Jews Living in Iran |publisher=Sephardicstudies.org |date= |accessdate=2015-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of groups of Jews of Iran have split off since ancient times. They are now recognized as separate communities, such as the Bukharan Jews and Mountain Jews. In addition, there are several thousand in Iran who are, or who are the direct descendants of, Jews who have converted to Islam and the Bahá'í Faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bahai-library.com/maneck_conversion_minorities_iran |title=Conversion of Religious Minorities to the Bahá'í Faith in Iran |publisher=Bahai-library.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article| Iranian Georgians}}
Iranian Georgians are [[Twelver Shia]] Muslims, whereas the vast majority of Georgians elsewhere in the world are [[Christian]].

The [[Georgian language]] is the only [[Caucasian languages|Caucasian language]] fully functioning in Iran and it's spoken only by those that live in [[Fereydan]] and [[Fereydunshahr]], and in smaller pockets all over Iran. Almost all other communities of [[Iranian Georgians]] in Iran have already lost their language, but retain a clear Georgian identity.

Once a very large minority in Iran mainly due to mass deportations by the various early modern age and modern age Iranian empires ([[Safavids]], [[Afsharids]], and [[Qajar dynasty|Qajars]]), of their Georgian subjects, nowadays, due to intermarrying and assimilating the number of Georgians in Iran is estimated to be over 100,000. However, the amount of Iranians with partial or assimilated Georgian ancestry is estimated to exceed millions.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The [[Georgian language]] is still used by many of the Georgians in [[Iran]]. The centre of [[Georgian people|Georgians]] in Iran is [[Fereydunshahr]], a small city 150&amp;nbsp;km to the west of [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]]. The western part of Isfahan province is historically called [[Fereydan]]. In this area there are 10 Georgian towns and villages around [[Fereydunshahr]]. In this region the old Georgian identity is retained the best compared to other places in Iran. In many major Iranian cities, such as [[Tehran]], [[Isfahan]], [[Karaj]] and [[Shiraz]], and [[Rasht]] live Georgians too.

In many other places such as [[Najafabad]], [[Rahmatabad, Najafabad|Rahmatabad]], Yazdanshahr and Amir Abad (near Isfahan) there are also Georgian pockets and villages. In [[Mazandaran Province]] in northern Iran, there are ethnic Georgians too. They live in the town of [[Behshahr]], and also in Behshahr county, in Farah Abad, and many other places, which are usually called "Gorji Mahalle" (Georgian Neighbourhood). Most of these Georgians no longer speak the [[Georgian language]], but retain aspects of [[Georgian culture]] and a Georgian identity. Some{{Who|date=November 2016}} argue that Iranian Georgians retain remnants of Christian traditions, but there is no evidence for this.

===Circassians===
{{main article|Circassians in Iran}}
Like with the Georgians, once a very large minority in Iran all the way from the [[Safavid Dynasty|Safavid]] to the [[Qajar Dynasty|Qajar]] era, the vast majority of the [[Circassians]] have been assimilated into the population nowadays. However, significant numbers remain present,&lt;ref name="FdyRswC p 141"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=stl97FdyRswC&amp;pg=PA141&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;dq=number+of+circassians+in+iran&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=u_SmExfuC8&amp;sig=2lK8k9IsUQZyjCtdKqIAIr6Rc5M&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBDgKahUKEwins7Whz4vGAhVRCNsKHb9pAME#v=onepage&amp;q=number%20of%20circassians%20in%20iran&amp;f=false ''Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Africa and the Middle East''] Facts On File, Incorporated {{ISBN|143812676X}} p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; and they are the second-largest Caucasian ethnic group in the nation after the Georgians.&lt;ref name="FdyRswC p 141"/&gt;

From [[Jean Chardin|Sir John Chardin's]] "Travels in Persia, 1673–1677":

''There is scarce a Gentleman in Persia, whose Mother is not a Georgian, or a Circassian Woman; to begin with the King, who commonly is a Georgian, or a Circassian by the Mother's side.''

[[Circassians]] alongside the Georgians were deported en masse by the Shah's to fulfil roles in the civil administration, the military, and the royal Harem, but also as craftsmen, farmers, amongst other professions.&lt;ref&gt;P Bushkovitch, ''Princes Cherkasskii or Circassian Murzas'', pp.12–13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ČARKAS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/carkas-cherkes-term-used-in-persian-arabic-and-turkic-for-the-circassian-people-of-the-northwest-caucasus-who-call-thems |title=ČARKAS |publisher=Iranicaonline.org |accessdate=28 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6SYOXY2Np?url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/carkas-cherkes-term-used-in-persian-arabic-and-turkic-for-the-circassian-people-of-the-northwest-caucasus-who-call-thems |archivedate=13 September 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Circassian women were both in [[Ottoman Turkey]] and Persia desired for [[Circassian beauties|their beauty]], while the men were known as fearsome warriors.
Notable Iranians of Circassian descent of the past include [[Teresia Sampsonia]], [[Shah Abbas II]], [[Suleiman I of Persia|Shah Suleiman I]], [[Pari Khan Khanum]] (daughter of [[Shah Tahmasp]], involved in many court intrigues), [[Shamkhal Sultan]], Jamshid Beg (the assassinator of [[Ismail II|Shah Ismail II]]), and [[Anna Khanum]].
Traces of Circassian settlements have lasted into the 20th century,&lt;ref name="ČARKAS"/&gt; and small pockets still exist scattered over the country, even after centuries of absorbing and assimilating,&lt;ref name="Carl Waldman pp.175"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mcha.kbsu.ru"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mcha.kbsu.ru/english/m_hist_01E.htm.html|title=International Circassian Association|accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as in [[Fars Province|Fars]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/carkas-cherkes-term-used-in-persian-arabic-and-turkic-for-the-circassian-people-of-the-northwest-caucasus-who-call-thems |title=ČARKAS |publisher=Iranicaonline.org |accessdate=26 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6SYOXY2Np?url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/carkas-cherkes-term-used-in-persian-arabic-and-turkic-for-the-circassian-people-of-the-northwest-caucasus-who-call-thems |archivedate=13 September 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rasht]], [[Asupas|Aspas]], [[Gilan Province|Gilan]], [[Mazandaran]], and the capital [[Tehran]] (due to contemporary internal migration). Their total number nowadays is unknown due to heavy assimilation and lack of censuses based on ethnicity, but are known to be significant.&lt;ref name="FdyRswC p 141"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mcha.kbsu.ru"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pierre, Oberling ''Georgians and Circassians in Iran''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/iran-vii6-in-islamic-iran-language-families|title=IRAN vii. NON-IRANIAN LANGUAGES (6) in Islamic Iran|accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the same assimilation however, no sizeable number speaks the [[Circassian language]] anymore.&lt;ref name="mcha.kbsu.ru"/&gt;

==Recent immigration==
{{anchor|Immigration}}
Most of the large [[Circassians|Circassian]] migrational waves towards mainland Iran stem from the Safavid and Qajar era, however a certain amount also stem from the relatively recent arrivals that migrated as the Circassians [[Ethnic cleansing of Circassians|were displaced from the Caucasus]] in the 19th century. A [[Afro-Iranian|Black African]] population exists due to [[Slavery in Iran|historical slavery]].
A substantial number of [[Russians in Iran|Russians]] arrived in the early 20th century as refugees from the [[Russian revolution]], but their number has dwindled following the [[Iran crisis of 1946]] and the [[Iranian Revolution]].
In the 20th to 21st centuries, there has been limited immigration to Iran from [[Turkish people in Iran|Turkey]], [[Iraqis in Iran|Iraqis]] (especially huge numbers during the 1970s known as [[Moaved]]s), [[Afghans in Iran|Afghanistan]] (mostly arriving as refugees in 1978), [[Lebanese people in Iran|Lebanese]] (especially in [[Qom province|Qom]], though a Lebanese community has been present in the nation for centuries),
[[Indians in Iran|Indians]] (mostly arriving temporarily during the 1950s to 1970s, typically working as doctors, engineers, and teachers), [[Koreans in Iran|Koreans]] (mostly in the 1970s as labour migrants), [[Chinese people in Iran|China]] (mostly since the 2000s working in engineering or business projects), and [[Pakistanis in Iran|Pakistan]], partly due to labour migrants and partly to [[Baloch people|Balochi]] ties across the Iranian-Pakistani border. 
About 200,000 [[Iraqis in Iran|Iraqis]] arrived as refugees in 2003,{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} mostly living in refugee camps near the border; an unknown number of these has since returned to Iraq.

Over the same period, there has also been substantial emigration from Iran, especially since the [[Iranian revolution]] (see [[Iranian diaspora]], [[Human capital flight from Iran]], [[Jewish exodus from Iran]]), especially
to the [[Iranian American|United States]], [[Iranian Canadian|Canada]], [[Iranians in Germany|Germany]], [[Iranian Jews in Israel|Israel]], and [[Swedish Iranians|Sweden]].

She began acting in films in 1950 and her last credited appearance was in 1966.

==Biography==
During the [[Second World War]], a teenaged Bartok, the daughter of a Jewish father and a Catholic mother, was forced to marry Hungarian Nazi officer Géza Kovács; the marriage was [[annulment|annulled]] after the war on the grounds of [[coercion]] of a minor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/person/10936|49801/Eva-Bartok/ Eva Bartok], [[Turner Classic Movies]]; accessed 22 April 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; 

She had four other marriages, all of which ended in divorce, including her final marriage, to actor [[Curd Jürgens]] (1955–56).

{{Refimprove|date=May 2014}}

The phrases '''fresh off the boat''' ''(FOB)'', '''off the boat''' ''(OTB)'', '''banana boat''' ''(BB)'', or just simply '''boat''' are terms used to describe [[immigrant]]s who have arrived from a foreign nation and have yet to [[Assimilation (sociology)|assimilate]] into the host nation's [[culture]], [[language]], and behaviour, but still continue with their ethnic ideas and practices.&lt;ref name="Goleman"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Goleman|first=Daniel|title=Social intelligence: the new science of human relationships|publisher=Random House, Inc.|edition=illustrated|page=305|isbn= 978-0-553-80352-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within some ethnic Asian circles in the United States, the phrase is considered [[politically incorrect]] and derogatory.  It can also be used to describe the [[stereotypical]] behavior of new immigrants as, for example, their poor [[Driving#Driving skills|driving skills]],&lt;ref name="Sturgeon"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sturgeon|first=Ron|author2=Gahan Wilson|title=Business jargon|publisher=Ron Sturgeon|year=2005|edition=illustrated, abridged|page=139|isbn= 978-0-9717031-1-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; that they are educated yet working low-skilled or unskilled jobs, and their use of [[broken English]]. The term originates in the early days of immigration, when people mostly migrated to other countries by [[ship]]. "Fresh off the Boeing" (in reference to the [[Boeing 747]] jet) is sometimes used in the United States as a variation, especially amongst East, South and Southeast Asian immigrants{{Citation needed|date = May 2014}}.

In the sociology of ethnicity, this term can be seen as an indicator of a nature of [[diaspora|diasporic]] communities, or communities that have left their country of origin and migrated, usually permanently, to another country. The term has also been adapted by immigrants themselves or others in their community who see the differentiation as a source of pride, where they have retained their culture and have not lost it to assimilation. In fact, instead of taking this harm-intended phrase as an insult, many immigrants and more specifically, East and South Asians (especially their American-born children) may use this term to describe their cultural background habits and fashion sense, for example "fobby clothing", "fobby glasses", "fobby accent", and others{{Citation needed|date = May 2014}}.

In some instances, an "ethnic community" may find it difficult to assimilate with their new culture. Although some try to assimilate, they may fail due to the very swift transition to the host continent.&lt;ref name="Reinelt"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Reinelt|first=Janelle G.|author2=Joseph R. Roach|title=Critical theory and performance|publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=2007|edition=revised, illustrated|page=161|isbn= 978-0-472-06886-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom "fresh off the boat" (mostly in regard to Indians, Pakistanis, and Bangladeshis) are referred to as ''freshies'' or simply FOBs. And in the United States, they are referred to as F.O.B. or in some cases, "Boater." This is usually a pejorative term{{Citation needed|date = July 2017}}.

=== Chicago ===
The Chicago Crime Commission publication "The Gang Book 2012" gave the statistic that Chicago has more gang members than any other city in the United States: 150,000.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/chicago-crime-commision-gang-book-138174334.html&lt;/ref&gt; The city had 532 murders in 2012, however, it saw a decrease to 413 murders in 2013. Not all murders are gang-related, but the [[Chicago Police Department]] states that 80% of all shootings and murders in the city are gang-related, which means that most violence in the city is gang upon gang violence.

A '''gender crime''' is a [[hate crime]] committed against a specific gender. Specific gender crimes may include some instances of [[rape]], [[genital mutilation]], [[forced prostitution]], and [[forced pregnancy]]. 
Often gender crimes are committed during armed conflict or during times of political upheaval or instability. According to one news story on CNN, people usually commit hate crimes as a form of thrill seeking, retaliation, defensiveness or because they feel they need to complete a mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/06/02/us/who-commits-hate-crimes/index.html|title=The four reasons people commit hate crimes|last=CNN|first=Story by Daniel Burke, CNN Religion Editor. Graphics and data analysis by Sergio Hernandez,|work=CNN|access-date=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of these conflicts include the [[Yugoslav war|Yugoslavian Civil War]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=GÜLEN ÖZEL|title=SEXUAL VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN IN CIVIL WARS: AN ANALYSIS OF YUGOSLAVIAN CIVIL WAR|date=April 2006|url=http://etd.lib.metu.edu.tr/upload/12607244/index.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Rwandan genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Joseph Schaeffer|title=TANZANIA: Prosecution of Rwanda Gender Crimes at the ICTR|url=http://jurist.org/dateline/2010/08/tanzania-prosecution-of-gender-crimes-in-rwanda.php|accessdate=15 October 2014|work=Jurist|date=6 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender crime is not universally recognized as a category of hate crime but is increasingly being included in the [[United States]] as a category in state and federal hate crime laws. 
Internationally most gender crimes committed during times of war are recognized as [[war crimes]] as set forth by the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]].
[[Revenge porn]] and other online behavior are seen as a hate crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Collyer Bristow|title=Hate crimes and drag queens in cyber space|url=http://www.thelawyer.com/briefings/hate-crimes-and-drag-queens-in-cyber-space/3026961.article|accessdate=15 October 2014|work=The Lawyer|date=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Soraya Chemaly|title=A Million Peeping Toms: When Hacking Is Also a Hate Crime|url=http://time.com/3506848/jennifer-lawrence-nude-photo-hack-gender-based-hate/|accessdate=15 October 2014|work=Time|date=October 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist criminologists have also pioneered the specific discipline of criminal victimization which could be considered one of many major factors contributing to gender crimes. For example, there is a greater likelihood of women in comparison to men who are victims of a familiar person, in most cases a man that they know, instead of a stranger. &lt;ref&gt;Gover, Angela R., et al.

{{See also|1990 airlift of Indians from Kuwait}}
Kuwaitis view India as a fast-growing economy and a source of highly qualified professional and technical personnel.

Professionals like engineers, doctors, lawyers, chartered accountants, scientists, software experts, management professionals and consultants, architects, retail traders and businessmen mainly constitute the Indian community. Of late, there has been an increase in the number of highly qualified Indian experts in hi-tech areas, especially in the software and financial sector in Kuwait. In the field of health, India not only supplies top specialists but also para-medical staff who enjoy a high reputation. Inward remittances from Kuwait to India are substantial.

There are 17 Indian schools in Kuwait affiliated to the [[Central Board of Secondary Education]] (CBSE). There were 164 Indian community Associations earlier registered with the Indian Embassy of Kuwait. Following introduction of a re-registration requirement, 106 of these Indian community Associations have once again registered with the Embassy and the number of registered Associations is growing at a steady pace.

Iyo is a language spoken in the [[Madang Province]] of [[Papua New Guinea]] that comes from the [[Trans–New Guinea languages|Trans-New Guinea]] language family. Iyo also goes by the names Bure, Naho, Nabu, and Nahu. It has about 6,900 speakers. The Iyo language was previously known as Nahu because the first discovered speakers of the language lived in villages along the Nahu river. The name changed due to other communities speaking the same language but having different names for it. It was decided to call the language 'Iyo', which is the word for 'yes', after the leaders in the communities agreed to it.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Iyo Grammar Sketch|last=Minter|first=Paul|publisher=SIL-PNG Academic Publications|year=2009|isbn=9980035277|location=Ukarumpa, Papua New Guinea|pages=1-107}}&lt;/ref&gt;


== Speakers ==
The Iyo people live in a society that values equality. Before the Lutheran church's influence, families would live in small settlements across mountainous regions. Around the mid-1950s, villages were created with a local church acting as the center of the village. Over time, villages became more religiously diverse and gained contact with other cultures. The village houses are almost entirely made out of resources from the forests around the mountain with the exception of nails, hinges, and a corrugated metal roof from time to time. The Iyo people typically ate root vegetables such as taro and sweet potato. They also at corn, beans, and fruit when there was no taro and sweet potato. They farm these crops in a '[[Slash-and-burn|slash and burn]]' style on the mountain slopes. Pigs are also raised in small amounts and are saved for fests during special occasions. Sometimes they would grow coffee and vanilla beans to trade with other groups in the area.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Phonology ==

=== Consonants ===
The Iyo language contains 15 consonants. One more [[phoneme]] that is represented by 'dz' can sometimes occur due to the close relationship between the Iyo language and the [[Kâte language|Kate language]]. This sound only appears in some names so it is not included. The phoneme 's' represents two different sounds. One is the conventional 's' sound and the other one creates a 'ts' sound. Similar to 's', the phoneme 'r' also represents two different sounds. These two sounds are 'r' and 'l'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Syllables ===
The syllables in Iyo follow a general rule of a consonant followed by a vowel. There are a few times where there will be two vowels clustered together (ex. ae, ia, ou, ua.), but consonants must be separated by a vowel in between.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Stress ===
Iyo has a predictable [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]] pattern where the second to last syllable, or the penultimate syllable, contains primary stress. In addition, secondary stress is on the fourth and sixth syllables if there is any.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Nasalisation ===
Most vowels in Iyo are nasalized if they are found in stressed syllables.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Orthography and Phonology Database: Islands and Momase Regions|last=Hemmilä|first=Ritva|publisher=Summer Institute of Linguistics|year=1998|isbn=9980017570|location=Ukarumpa, Papua New Guinea|pages=94-97}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nasalization|Nasaliation]] is a feature on some roots and suffixes. Nasalisation can occur when syllables contain a voiceless sound and is attached to a root or suffix like 'ka' in 'kato', 'awa' in 'awando', and 'pare' in 'pareke'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Counters ==
The Iyo language follows a base five counting system. After the number five, the number six is thought of as five plus one (ex. 'kandeka' means five 'kande saŋiyo kanata' means six but is literally translated to five plus one). The counting system uses hands and legs to communicate numbers from one to twenty (ex. 'nimi kini' means four and is translated to 'without the thumb', 'kande irisa' means ten and is translated to 'two hands' and 'khe kande soso' means twenty and is translated to 'all legs and hands'). In addition, adding 'qu' after a number turns it into an [[Ordinal number (linguistics)|ordinal number]] (ex. 'kandeka' means five and 'kandeka qu' means fifth). The only exceptions to this is 'first', 'second', and 'third' where a possessive suffix is included. This counting system is not being used too frequently. Instead, the counting system of [[Tok Pisin]] has been adopted and is more commonly used.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Verbs ==
There are two distinct types of verbs in Iyo. In a sentence, it is common to have multiple verbs with at least one being a medial verb, and one final verb. A medial verb uses a suffix to connect the subject of a verb to another verb while a final verb uses a suffix to identify the tense, and number of the subject.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Word Order ==
Iyo does not have a specific [[word order]] that it follows. Depending on the sentence, the word order can change from a Subject Object Verb (SOV) order to a Object Subject Verb (OSV) order.

=== Subject Object Verb ===
SVO word order is the most common word order found in Iyo.

ex. 'No   kombono     qare       seqanowo'

1S moon-LOC   cuscus  look.for-PST-1s-RPST

'I hunted [[cuscus]] in the moonlight.'&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Object Subject Verb ===
OSV word order is a rare occurrence that can happen when the subject is the focus of the sentence. When this happens, the subject word and object word can swap places, however both ways are acceptable.

ex. 'Kopore  mira      pokamote.'

S          O             V

cloud    ground  cover0PRES-2/3s

'Clouds are covering the ground.'

'Mira        kopore       pokamote.'

O              S                 V

ground    cloud     cover-PRES-2/3s

'Clouds are covering the ground.'

In this case, both sentences are acceptable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Word Tense ==
There are four different tenses in Iyo. The tense of a sentence can be distinguished by the final verb.

=== Remote Past ===
The remote past tense is used when the speaker is talking about something that happened two or more days ago from the time in the narrative.

ex. 'Nuwi qenero'

cousin-3sPOSS see-PST-2/3s-RPST

'He saw his cousin.'&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Past ===
Past tense refers to a time range from a few hours ago to yesterday. Past tense is typically not used in stories unless it is in direct quotes from someone in the story. The context of a story uses remote past tense while a quote from someone in the story uses past tense.

ex. 'Sira rimiyaŋgo ŋu naŋge qeneroqo sira sowe tero rimiyoteŋgo'

taro plant-CONT-PST-2/3p DEM DISC see-SS-SUB taro continuation do-SS plant-CONT-PRES-2/3p

'Seeing it simply as the type of taro they always planted they added it to the taro they are planting now.'&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Present ===
Present tense refers to another range of time from a few hours ago to the current time. It can refer to something that is in the process of happening or something that has recently happened.

ex. 'ŋu iŋoteno'

DEM know-PRES-1s

'I understand that.'&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Future ===
Future tense is used when something will probably happen in the near to distant future. It is commonly used when a specific time is not known.

ex. 'Balusi naru kano areweya ŋu Seweko o siyoni uweya'

airplane time INDEF-LOC come.up-FUT-2/3s DEM Sewe-TOP things get.PLOBJ-3sDS go.down-FUT-2/3s

'At whatever time the plane will come up, Sewe will get their things and it will go down.'&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Sentence Types ==
The Iyo language has three basic types of sentences. More complex sentences are chains of these sentence types.

=== Declarative ===
Declarative sentences are sentences used to state something.

ex. 'Dopeke     koya              Takeme        koya                   tokono         oriyo'

Dopeke      TOP-ACC     Takeme        TOP-ACC        forest-ALL    go.up-PST-2/3d-RPST

'Dopeke and Takeme went up to the forest.'&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Imperative ===
Imperative sentences are technically sentence fragments due to the final verb in a sentence being implied. Since there is no final verb stated in the sentence, imperative sentences end with a medial verb.

ex. 'Asa,     ye     woso        kutaqemo       mahika.'

alright   2P     pull        nearby-ALL  come-2pIMP-SEQ

'Alright, you all come up close beside me.'&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Interrogative ===
Interrogative sentences often have interrogative pronouns and typically have a rising intonation that drops at the end of the question.

ex. 'Kopipe                   neweya?'

coffee-YNQ     3sDO-drink-FUT-2/3s

'Will you drink some coffee?'&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Spatial words ==
Spatial words in Iyo are based on the speaker or the person being spoken to. Due to the mountainous region that most of the people who speak Iyo live in, spatial words identify objects that are higher, lower, across, beside, or behind the recipient, and if the object is close or far.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
{| class="wikitable"

|-
!Across
|ande
|andu
|-
!Lower
|ame
|amu
|-
!Beside
|dina
|ande
|-
!Behind
|mina
|amu
|}

== Loan Words ==
There are a few occurrences of loan words in Iyo. Most of the words come from Tok Pisin since it is a more dominant language and is used for wider communication (ex. 'keseti' is taken from the word 'keset' in Tok Pisin which means cassette, 'sipeti' is taken from the word 'spet' in Tok Pisin which means spade, and 'balusi' is taken from the word 'balus' in Tok Pisin which means 'airplane'. Most of the loan words are for objects that never had a word in Iyo before.

ex. 'Balusi          bukimŋaro'

airplane  make.booking-3sDO-PST-2/3s-RPST

'He booked a plane.'&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Kwegu people''' (or '''Muguji people''') are a [[Surma people|Surmic]] ethnic group inhabiting the shores of the [[Omo River (Ethiopia)|Omo River]] in southwestern [[Ethiopia]].

==Overview==
The Kwegu speak the [[Kwegu language]] as a [[mother tongue]], which belongs to the [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] language family.

Primarily fishermen, hunters and cultivators, they spend a large part of their time on the river and are noted for their canoe-making skills. The speed of the river's current and the dangers from the crocodiles render these skills vital. Nearby live the [[Mursi people|Mursi]] who are cattle herders and cultivators. These two groups live together for several months each year and the relationship between the groups has been much discussed by anthropologists&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.therai.org.uk/film/volume-ii-contents/the-kwegu/ Royal Anthropological Institute: The Kwegu a film by Leslie Woodhead advised by anthropologist David Turton]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joshuaproject.net/people-profile.php?peo3=18363&amp;rog3=ET|title=Kwegu in Ethiopia|first=Joshua|last=Project|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lucinda Banister Chandler''' (April 1, 1828 - 1911) was an American social reformer and author. She was a leader in the [[social purity movement]]. She was affiliated with [[Elizabeth Boynton Harbert]].{{sfn|Satter|2001|p=195}}

==Early years and education==
Lucinda Banister was born in [[Potsdam, New York]], April 1, 1828. Her parents were Silas Banister and Eliza Smith, both of [[New England]] birth and ancestry.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=165}}   

Chandler suffered a spinal injury in early infancy from a fall, which caused a life of invalidism and extreme suffering. As a child, she was fond of books and study, and when she entered St. Lawrence Academy (now, [[State University of New York at Potsdam]]), at nine years of age, her teacher registered her as two years older, because of her advancement in studies and seeming maturity of years. At the age of 13, her first great disappointment came, when her school course was suspended, never to be resumed, by the severe development of her spinal malady. For several years, even reading was denied to her.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=165}}  

==Career==
In the winter of 1870-71, she wrote "Motherhood, Its Power Over Human Destiny," while recuperating from a long illness, and it was so warmly received in [[Vineland, New Jersey]], that it was afterwards published in booklet form. That introduced her to many thinking women of [[Boston]], where in 1871-72, she held parlor meetings and organized a body of women who were pledged to work for the promotion of enlightened parenthood as well as an equal and high standard of purity for both sexes: the Moral Education Society of Boston. Societies were formed in [[New York City]], [[Philadelphia]] and [[Washington, D.C.]], by the efforts of Chandler and with the cooperation of prominent women. That was the first work in this country in the line of educational standards for the elevation and purity of the relations of men and women, inside as well as outside of marriage. The publication of essays, "A Mother's Aid, "Children's Rights" and the "Divineness of Marriage," written by her, followed and furnished a literature for the agitation of questions that later were widely discussed.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=165}}  

During one of the long periods of prostration and confinement to her room, to which Chandler was subject, she commenced study on the lines of political economy as a mental tonic and helpful agency to restoration. After her recovery, she wrote extensively for reform publications upon finance reform, the land question and industrial problems. In [[Chicago]], in 1880, the Margaret Fuller Society was founded, especially to interest women in those subjects and the principles of [[Americanism (ideology)|Americanism]].{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=165}}   

A lifelong advocate of the total abstinence principle, Chandler served as vice-president of the Woman's Christian Temperance Alliance of [[Illinois]]. She was the first president of the Chicago Moral Educational Society, formed in 1882. She was an advocate of Christian socialism, and a firm believer in the final triumph of the Christian idea of the brotherhood of man as a practical and controlling principle in commercial and industrial systems.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=165}} 

==Personal life==
At the age of 20, she married John H. Chandler, who was born and raised in [[Potsdam]].{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=165}} He was a carpenter and joiner by trade. He was also a music teacher and gave musicalconcerts and instruction in music. Their only child was John Nelson who drowned at the age of four years.{{sfn|Chandler|1883|p=945}}

Chandler's marriage was a happy one. Her husband's care made it possible for her to enjoy a period of usefulness in later life.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=165}} Chandler died in 1911.{{sfn|Gordon|2009|p=73}}

==Life==
Leigh was born in 1885 and she joined the [[Women's Social and Political Union]] (WSPU) in 1906.

On 17 September 1909 she and [[Charlotte Marsh]] climbed onto the roof of [[Bingley Hall]] in Birmingham to protest at being excluded from a political meeting where the British Prime Minister Asquith was giving a speech. They threw tiles which they levered up with an axe at the Asquith's car and at the police. Leigh was given sentences totaling four months in [[Winson Green Prison]]. There she again protested about not being treated as a political prisoner by breaking a window and by going on hunger strike. Leigh was force fed.&lt;ref&gt;Myall, M. (2004-09-23).

On 18&amp;nbsp;July&amp;nbsp;1912, in Dublin, she threw a hatchet at Prime Minister [[H. H. Asquith|Herbert Henry Asquith]], hitting instead Irish nationalist leader [[John Redmond]] who was injured. Leigh was unhappy with the WSPU, but refused to leave when Emmeline Pankhurst asked for loyalty or for members to leave. She remained loyal as she felt an ownership for the organisation she had helped create.&lt;ref name="Cowman2007"/&gt;

After [[Emily Davison]] was run over by the king's horse at the [[Epsom Derby|Derby]] in 1913, Leigh and [[Rose Emma Lamartine Yates]] was at the dying Davison's bedside, and headed a guard of honour for the funeral procession.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, pp. 340 and 764&lt;/ref&gt;

[[World War I]] precipitated a split between Leigh, Yates and other leading suffragettes with [[Emmeline Pankhurst]]. Pankhurst had agreed that the WSPU would suspend its militant campaign for female suffrage and back the government's fight against Germany. Leigh and others disagreed with this policy, and broke away to form the "Suffragettes of the WSPU".&lt;ref name=count&gt;{{cite book | last= Crawford | first= Elizabeth | title= The Women's Suffrage Movement : A Reference Guide, 1866-1928|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a2EK9P7-ZMsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Women%27s+Suffrage+Movement:+A+Reference+Guide&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MZ5UVfzVL-Ga7gaSnIDQAw&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Women%27s%20Suffrage%20Movement%3A%20A%20Reference%20Guide&amp;f=false | year= 1999| location= London | publisher= UCL Press |page= 763–764| isbn= 978-1-84142-031-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation intended to be militant and national but never achieved a large impact. Like the Independent WSPU it was created in 1916. The SWSPU passed a resolution to concentrate on women's suffrage and to not encourage debate about former WSPU leaders.&lt;ref name="Cowman2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Krista Cowman|title=Women of the Right Spirit: Paid Organisers of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), 1904-18|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6cbvP3XF0yMC&amp;pg=PA162|date=15 July 2007|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-7002-0|page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terrorism==
Simon Webb, author of a book on suffragette terrorism, told in a letter to [[The Guardian]] that Mary Leigh and other suffragettes set fire to a theatre full of people and bombed it. They were not prosecuted as terrorists because terrorism offense didn't existed yet.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/10/suffragettes-did-commit-terrorist-acts&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mfumte''' (Nfumte) is a [[Grassfields Bantu languages|Grassfields Bantu language]] of [[Cameroon]]. It is not clear if the four varieties spoken by ethnic Mfumte—'''Ndaktup''', '''Kwaja''', '''Fum''' and Mfumte proper—are [[mutually intelligible]] or distinct languages; ability to communicate may be either due to inherent intelligibility or to [[bilingualism]], while ''Fum'' and ''Mfumte'' may simply be the [[Nigeria|Nigerian]] and Cameroonian names for the same language.

The '''[[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]] of [[Croatia]]''' are a [[national minority]] in the republic. According to the 2011 census, there are 4,517 ethnic Montenegrins in Croatia. The highest number of Montenegrins in Croatia is in the Croatian capital Zagreb.

Montenegrins are officially recognized as an autochthonous national minority, and as such, they elect a special representative to the [[Croatian Parliament]], shared with members of four other national minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sabor.hr/Default.aspx?art=1874 | language = Croatian | publisher = Croatian Parliament | title = Pravo pripadnika nacionalnih manjina u Republici Hrvatskoj na zastupljenost u Hrvatskom saboru | work = Zakon o izborima zastupnika u Hrvatski sabor | accessdate = 2011-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Expand section|date=February 2012}}

In 1657, the Doge of Venice Bertuccio Valiero, resettled [[Peroj]] with five families (Brcela, Draković, Brajić, Vučeta, and Ljubotina) from the Cernizza region in Montenegro. Following the Cretan War of 1645–1669, twenty other families originally from Montenegro migrated to Peroj. Today Peroj is the centre of the Montenegrins in [[Istria County]].

The '''National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research''' ('''NIDILRR''') is a [[United States]] [[governmental agency]] that provides leadership and support for a comprehensive program of research related to the [[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] of individuals with [[disabilities]]. It was previously The National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research, a subordinate of the [[Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services]] (OSERS) — part of [[United States Department of Education]].&lt;ref name=aboutNIDILRR/&gt;

In 2015, as a result of the [[Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act]], the organization became part of the [[Administration for Community Living]] (ACL), within the [[Department of Health and Human Services]], and changed to its current name. NIDILRR's mission is to generate new knowledge and promote its effective use to improve the abilities of people with disabilities to perform activities of their choice in the community, and also to expand society’s capacity to provide full opportunities and accommodations for its citizens with disabilities.&lt;ref name=aboutNIDILRR&gt;{{cite web |title=About the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research (NIDILRR) |date=1 July 2015 |website=Administration for Community Living |url=http://www.acl.gov/Programs/NIDILRR/About/About.aspx }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Native American mascot controversy}}

The use of terms and images referring to [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]/[[First Nations]] as the name or [[mascot]] for a sports team is a topic of public controversy in the [[United States]] and in [[Canada]], arising as part of the [[Native American civil rights|Native American/First Nations]] civil rights movements. Since the 1960s, there have been a number of protests and other actions by Native Americans and others targeting the more prominent use of such names and images by professional franchises such as the [[Cleveland Indians name and logo controversy|Cleveland Indians]] and the [[Washington Redskins name controversy|Washington Redskins]].&lt;ref name="Davis.2010"&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Native_American_Mascot_Controversy.html?id=GApQrXWeGLwC| editor=C. Richard King| title=The Native American Mascot Controversy: A Handbook| chapter=4. The Problems with Native American Mascots | author=Laurel R. Davis| publisher=Scarecrow Press| location=Lanham, Maryland| year=2010| isbn=978-0-8108-6731-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the greatest change has occurred in the trend by school and college teams that have retired Native American names and mascots at an increasing rate in recent decades. The analysis of a database in 2013 indicates that there are currently more than 2,000 secondary schools with mascots that reference Native American culture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Munguia|first1=Hayley|title=The 2,128 Native American Mascots People Aren't Talking About|url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-2128-native-american-mascots-people-arent-talking-about/|website=fivethirtyeight.com|accessdate=November 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared to around 3,000 fifty years ago.&lt;ref name="NCAI"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ncai.org/policy-issues/community-and-culture/anti-defamation-mascots| title=Anti-Defamation &amp; Mascots| accessdate=December 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these changes have been voluntary as the issue has been discussed at a local level. Statewide laws or school board decisions mandating change have been passed in states with significant Native American populations. Other states have official policies that encourage change in accordance with principles of establishing a proper environment for education. However, there has also been resistance and backlash, usually when statewide laws have been viewed as an intrusion into local communities, where no need for change has been established.&lt;ref name="CNSMaryland.20171219"&gt;{{cite news| first=Dylan| last=Sinn| title=California law cuts 'Redskins' over school objections| agency=Capitol News Service| publisher=[[Philip Merrill College of Journalism]]| date=December 19, 2017| url=http://cnsmaryland.org/2017/12/19/california-law-cuts-redskins-over-school-objections/ | accessdate=December 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The documents most often cited to justifying the trend for change are an advisory opinion by the [[United States Commission on Civil Rights]] in 2001&lt;ref name=USCCR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usccr.gov/press/archives/2001/041601st.htm |title=Statement of the United States Commission on Civil Rights on the use of Native American images and nicknames as sports symbols |accessdate=December 10, 2016|date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a resolution by the [[American Psychological Association]] in 2005.&lt;ref name=APA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/pi/oema/resources/indian-mascots.aspx|title=Summary of the Resolution Recommending Retirement of American Indian Mascots|publisher=American Psychological Association|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both support the views of Native American organizations and individuals that such mascots maintaining harmful stereotypes that are discriminatory and cause harm by distorting the past and preventing understanding of Native American/First Nations peoples in the present. Native mascots are also part of the larger issues of [[cultural appropriation]] and the violation of [[indigenous intellectual property]] rights, which includes all instances where non-natives use indigenous music, art, costumes, etc. in entertainment or other performances. It has been argued that harm to Native Americans occurs because the appropriation of Native culture by the majority society continues the systems of dominance and subordination that have been used to colonize, assimilate, and oppress indigenous groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Riley| first=Angela| title=Straight Stealing: Towards an Indigenous System of Cultural Property Protection| journal=Washington Law Review| volume=80| issue=69| date=2005| ssrn=703283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Defenders of the current usage often state their intention to honor Native Americans by referring to positive traits, such as fighting spirit and being aggressive, brave, stoic, dedicated, and proud; while opponents see these traits as being based upon stereotypes of Native Americans as savages.&lt;ref name="Davis.2010"/&gt; Supporters also state that the issue is not important, being only about sports, and that the opposition is nothing more than "[[political correctness]]", which change advocates argue ignores the extensive evidence of harmful effects of stereotypes and bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Native_American_Mascot_Controversy.html?id=GApQrXWeGLwC|editor=C.

==Arizona==
A Native American legislator has proposed a bill that would ban the use of a sports team name or logo at a publicly funded stadium if any Arizona tribe found it to be disparaging. While primarily aimed at the Washington Redskins, the ban could effect other professional and amateur teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://azdailysun.com/news/local/bill-seeks-stadium-ban-on-team-names-that-disparage-native/article_53509b7f-f773-59ed-9914-67e1fd127786.html| title=Bill seeks stadium ban on team names that disparage Native Americans| author=Howard Fischer| publisher=Arizona Daily Sun| date=January 31, 2018| accessdate=February 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the January 2017 deadline, the four schools have complied with the letter of the law but not the spirit, retaining their Native American imagery and behavior, including a female student portraying an Indian Pricess in a floor length war bonnet and fans whopping and tomahawk chopping at games. With the agreement of the local government, Chowchilla has added "Redskins Way" signs to the streets leading to the school and insist they are maintaining a proud tradition that honors Native Americans, even as tribal members state that these practices trivialize and misrepresent the factual history of Native Americans in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://edsource.org/2017/mascot-law-rolls-out-and-schools-obey-the-letter-of-the-law-if-not-the-spirit/575473| title=Mascot law rolls out and schools obey the letter of the law, if not the spirit| date=January 23, 2017| author=Jane Meredith Adams| publisher=EdSource}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calaveras, which has selected no official team name, is calling itself "the Mighty Reds" on its web site while retaining its prior logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://chs.custudents.net/information/Sports| title=Calaveras High School sports| accessdate=January 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

School alumni continue to use the name and wear their Redskins apparel at games, and  cite the lack of Native American opposition to the name as justification. Such opposition exists, however. Joely Proudfit, chair of the American Indian Studies Department at California State University in San Marcos and member of the Luiseño/Payomkowishum tribe: "There's no redeeming quality of the word 'Redskin' but to try to soften the blow by using 'Tribe' or 'Indian' or 'Warrior' is nonsensical. It just shows that the proponents of keeping these types of words in there don't understand or refuse to understand the harmful effects of stereotyping one particular population."&lt;ref name="CNSMaryland.20171219"/&gt;

==Colorado==
In 2014 State lawmakers in Colorado began considering a bill that rather than a complete ban, would deny state funding to schools on a case by case basis, depending upon the name, logo, and local Native American support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://denver.cbslocal.com/2014/09/11/state-funding-center-school-mascot-controversy/|title=State Funding At Center Of School Mascot Controversy|date=September 11, 2014|publisher=CBS Denver}}&lt;/ref&gt; Getting ahead of any potential law, [[Loveland High School (Loveland, Colorado)|Loveland High School]] in [[Loveland, Colorado]], is "looking to a [[Lakota people|Lakota Sioux]] tribe for help creating a new mascot and a hands-on lesson in history and culture for the school."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.durangoherald.com/article/20150222/LIFESTYLE01/150229985&amp;template=mobileart| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319234649/http://durangoherald.com/article/20150222/LIFESTYLE01/150229985%26template%3Dmobileart| archivedate=March 19, 2015| title=School works with Sioux to replace mascot| first=Pamela| last=Johnson| publisher=Durango Herald| accessdate=December 9, 2016| deadurl=yes| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although passed by the House by one vote, the bill failed in a Colorado Senate committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.chieftain.com/news/3562480-120/bill-schools-mascots-american| title=State Senate halts bill to limit mascots| agency=Associated Press| date=April 30, 2015| publisher=The Pueblo Chieftain}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Colorado Governor [[John Hickenlooper]] has created by executive order a commission that will hold meetings where local community members, state agencies and Native Americans can seek to find common ground on the mascot issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_28929723/colorado-governor-creates-task-force-native-american-mascots| title=Colorado governor creates task force on American Indian mascots| first=Joey| last=Bunch| newspaper=The Denver Post| date=October 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of local action is at [[Cheyenne Mountain High School]], [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]]; which has taken action to eliminate stereotyping, including doing the tomahawk chop, or wearing warpaint and headdresses at games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://gazette.com/cheyenne-mountain-working-with-students-supporters-to-end-indian-stereotypes/article/1589351|title=Cheyenne Mountain working with students, supporters to end Indian stereotypes| first=Debbie| last=Kelley| date=November 3, 2016| publisher=The Gazette}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Massachusetts==
A bill has been introduced in the legislature to amend the General Laws of the Commonwealth to add a section prohibiting the use of Native American mascots by public schools, which are defined as "A name, symbol, or image that depicts or refers to an American Indian tribe, individual, custom, or tradition that is used by a public school as a mascot, nickname, logo, letterhead, or team name". The team names "Redskins", "Savages," "Indians," "Indianettes," "Chiefs," "Chieftains," "Braves," or "Redmen" are specifically prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://malegislature.gov/Bills/190/SD1119| title=Bill SD. 1119| publisher=Commonweath of Massachusetts| accessdate=January 24, 2017| }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Michigan==
The [[Michigan State Board of Education]] issued in 2003, and reaffirmed in 2010, a resolution that "supports and strongly recommends the elimination of American Indian mascots, nicknames, logos, fight songs, insignias, antics, and team descriptors by all Michigan schools."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.michigan.gov/documents/mde/Use_of_American_Indian_Mascots_329421_7.pdf| title=USE OF AMERICAN INDIAN MASCOTS, NICKNAMES, AND LOGOS| accessdate=December 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, the [[Michigan Department of Civil Rights]] (MDCR) filed a complaint with the [[United States Department of Education|US Department of Education]]'s [[Office for Civil Rights]] (OCR). MDCR's complaint asserts that new research clearly establishes that use of American Indian imagery negatively impacts student learning, creating an unequal learning environment in violation of Article VI of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].&lt;ref name=MDCR&gt;{{cite web|title=Michigan Department of Civil Rights: Continued Use of American Indian Mascots Hurts Student Achievement |url=http://www.michigan.gov/mdcr/0,4613,7-138--294605--,00.html |publisher=State of Michigan |accessdate=February 23, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218160526/http://www.michigan.gov/mdcr/0,4613,7-138--294605--,00.html |archivedate=February 18, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013, the OCR dismissed the case on the basis that the legal standard required not only harm, but the intent to do harm, which was not established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.freep.com/article/20130603/NEWS06/306030121/indian-mascot-ban-tossed-michigan| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605075801/http://www.freep.com/article/20130603/NEWS06/306030121/indian-mascot-ban-tossed-michigan| archive-date=June 5, 2013|title=Feds toss Michigan complaint to ban Indian mascots for sports teams|date=June 3, 2013|newspaper=The Detroit Free Press|first=Lori|last=Higgins|accessdate=December 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the schools named in the MDCR complaint, [[Saranac, Michigan|Saranac Community Schools]] in [[Ionia County]], Michigan plans to retain the name Redskins but has replaced the logo on its uniforms with a "[[Dreamcatcher]]" and the band will no longer play the "Tomahawk Song" at games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://woodtv.com/2014/09/18/saranac-schools-make-changes-to-mascot/|title=Saranac Schools Make Changes to Mascot|publisher=WoodTV.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost of removing Native American imagery has been a barrier to change, but a new Michigan Native American Heritage Fund will receive money for such changes due an amendment to the Tribal-State Gaming Compact between the [[Nottawaseppi Huron Band of the Potawatomi]] (NHBP) and the State of Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://wdet.org/posts/2017/01/04/84453-changes-to-tribal-agreement-could-mean-fewer-native-american-mascots/| title=Changes To Tribal Agreement Could Mean Fewer Native American Mascots| date=January 4, 2017| publisher=WDET}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March, 2017 the State Superintendent requested an opinion from the Michigan Attorney General whether he had the authority to fine school districts that failed to remove Native American mascots and logos that advocates argue are degrading and culturally insensitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.mlive.com/news/index.ssf/2017/03/state_superintendent_seeks_aut.html| title=State Superintendent seeks authority to fine schools that don't drop offensive mascots| author=Brian McVicar| date=March 15, 2017| publisher=MLive Media Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Attorney General responded in July, 2017 that the Superintendent did not have the authority to impose such fines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=STATE  OF  MICHIGAN  BILL  SCHUETTE, ATTORNEY  GENERAL|url=https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/MIAG/2017/07/06/file_attachments/842443/AGOpinion7296.pdf|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schools that consider their use of Native American imagery to be respectful include [[Huron High School (New Boston, Michigan)|Huron High School]] in [[New Boston, Michigan|New Boston]] (Chiefs), [[Woodhaven High School]] in [[Brownstown Charter Township, Michigan|Brownstown Township]] (Warriors), and [[Theodore Roosevelt High School (Wyandotte)|Roosevelt High School]] in [[Wyandotte, Michigan|Wyandotte]].

==New York==
In 2001, the New York State Education Department (NYSED) sent a letter to all Presidents of Boards of Education and Superintendents of Public Schools in the state with the results of a study concluding that, while the use of Native American symbols is part of the deeply felt traditions in some communities, and many believe that mascots honor or pay tribute to Native Americans and their culture; most Native Americans appear to find the portrayal by others of their treasured cultural and religious symbols disparaging and disrespectful. Local schools should therefore proceed to eliminate Native American mascots as soon as practicable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=James C. McKinley Jr.|title=Schools Urged To Stop Using Indian Names| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/06/nyregion/schools-urged-to-stop-using-indian-names.html| accessdate=3 May 2017| publisher=New York Times| date=April 6, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there were a few changes, the majority of schools in New York have retained their mascots.

An exceptional case is the Salamanca Central High School "Warriors" in the city of [[Salamanca (city), New York|Salamanca, New York]]. The city is within the boundaries of the [[Allegany Indian Reservation]] of the [[Seneca Nation of Indians]], and 26% of the high school students are Native American. In response to the NYSED letter, the Seneca Nation Tribal Council joined with other members of the community in seeking to retain the Warrior imagery, although with individual differences of opinion. Salamanca may be unique in having a mixed but not fully integrated community, with the Warrior identity combining elements negotiated between the Seneca and non-Seneca population.  For example, the school logo now depicts a Seneca man, replacing the stereotypical [[Plains Indian]] warrior image that was used prior to 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Taylor| first=Michael| title=THE SALAMANCA WARRIORS: A Case Study of an 'Exception to the Rule.'| journal=Journal of Anthropological Research| volume=67| issue=2| year=2011| pages=245–265| jstor=41303285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oregon==
On May 17, 2012, the [[Oregon State Board of Education]] voted 5–1 to adopt a rule prohibiting Oregon public schools from using Native American names, symbols, or images as school mascots; giving schools until July 1, 2017 to comply.

On September 24, 1993 the [[Washington State Board of Education]] (WSBE) passed a resolution encouraging all state schools to end the use of Native American mascots&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.sbe.wa.gov/resolutions/1993_Mascot.php#.WE37TZJ8Ak4| title=Native American Mascot Resolution| date=September 24, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a reinterated by a similar resolution in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2012/09/washington-state-wants-schools-to-ban-native-american-mascots/|title=Washington State Wants Schools to Ban Native American Mascots|first=Abby|last=Ellin|date=Sep 29, 2012|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=September 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sbe.wa.gov/documents/2012.09.26%20Native%20American%20Mascots%20Resolution.pdf|title=2012 Native American Mascot Resolution|accessdate=September 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the absence of mandatory regulations, change has come only as individual schools have addressed the issue. [[Bellingham High School (Washington)|Bellingham High School]] had a Native American mascot until it was closed for renovation. When it reopened in 2000, the mascot was changed to a bird of prey, but the name "Red Raiders" was retained. The Seattle-area Issaquah School District adopted a policy banning symbols based on racial stereotypes; resulting in a change of the [[Issaquah High School]] team from the "Indians" to the "Eagles" in 2003 over the protest of some students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bach |first=Ashley |date=June 26, 2003 |title=Issaquah picks Eagles as school's new mascot |page=B2 |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20030626&amp;slug=mascot26e |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |accessdate=December 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Indian Head" logo used by the [[Clover Park High School]] "Warriors" has been replaced by a block "CP" with a spear.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==Wisconsin==
In 2010 a law was passed in [[Wisconsin]] to eliminate race-based nicknames, logos and mascots in schools; but allowing retention if they have the permission of local Native American tribes.

Prompted by the concerns of Native Americans, the [[Madison Metropolitan School District]] in Wisconsin has implemented a policy banning student clothing having "words, pictures, or caricatures based on negative stereotypes of a specific gender, ethnicity, nationality, religion, sexual orientation or disability", which would ban all sports apparel displaying Native American mascot names, images or logos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://lacrossetribune.com/news/state-and-regional/madison-school-board-oks-ban-on-student-attire-with-indian/article_a3ff7f37-1b6c-5213-936d-2f70a91be78d.html| title=Madison School Board OKs ban on student attire with Indian mascots, logos| first=Pat| last=Schneider| date=May 26, 2015| publisher=LaCrosse Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the ban may not pass the legal test that freedom of speech does not allow for a ban on expression unless there is a "substantial disruption of the educational mission".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/05/28/madison-wis-school-board-bans-student-clothing-with-native-american-team-names-logos-or-mascots-that-depict-negative-stereotypes/| title=Madison, Wis. school board bans student clothing with 'Native American team names, logos or mascots that depict negative stereotypes'| first=Eugene| last=Volokh| date=May 28, 2015| newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visiting athletic teams will also be asked to leave behind Native American mascots and logos, otherwise the game could be canceled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.wisconsingazette.com/trending/not-your-mascotbreakstudent-led-push-leads-madison-to-ban-native-american-sports-team-imagery.html| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704022634/http://www.wisconsingazette.com/trending/not-your-mascotbreakstudent-led-push-leads-madison-to-ban-native-american-sports-team-imagery.html| dead-url=yes| archive-date=July 4, 2015| title=Not your mascot: Student-led push leads Madison to ban Native American sports team imagery| first=Lisa| last=Neff| date=July 2, 2015| newspaper=Wisconsin Gazette}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Personality psychology''' is a branch of [[psychology]] that studies [[personality]] and its variation among [[individual]]s. It is a scientific study which aims to show how people are individually different due to psychological forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Personality: Classic theories and modern research|last=Friedman|first=Howard|last2=Schustack|first2=Miriam|publisher=USA: Pearson|year=2016|isbn=978-0-205-99793-0|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its areas of focus include:

* construction of a coherent picture of the [[person|individual]] and their major psychological processes
* investigation of individual psychological differences
* investigation of [[human nature]] and psychological similarities between individuals

"Personality" is a dynamic{{clarify|date=October 2016}} and organized set of characteristics possessed by a person that uniquely{{clarify|date=October 2016}} influences their environment, [[cognition]]s, [[emotion]]s, [[motivation]]s, and [[Behavioural sciences|behaviors]] in various situations. The word ''personality'' originates from the [[Latin]] ''persona'', which means "[[mask]]".

Personality also refers to the pattern of [[thought]]s, [[feeling]]s, [[Adjustment (psychology)|social adjustments]], and [[behavior]]s consistently exhibited over time that strongly influences one's expectations, [[Self-concept|self-perceptions]], [[Value (ethics)|value]]s, and [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]]s. Personality also predicts human reactions to other people, problems, and [[Stress (biology)|stress]].&lt;ref name = Winnie&gt;Winnie, J.F. &amp; Gittinger, J.W. (1973) An introduction to the personality assessment system. ''Journal of Clinical Psychology, Monograph Supplement, 38,1=68''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Krauskopf, C.J. &amp; Saunders, D.R, (1994) Personality and Ability: The Personality Assessment System. University Press of America, Lanham, Maryland&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gordon Allport]] (1937) described two major ways to study personality: the nomothetic and the [[Idiographic image|idiographic]]. ''Nomothetic psychology'' seeks general laws that can be applied to many different people, such as the principle of [[self-actualization]] or the trait of [[Extraversion and introversion|extraversion]]. ''Idiographic psychology'' is an attempt to understand the unique aspects of a particular individual.

The study of [[personality]] has a broad and varied history in psychology with an abundance of theoretical trad. The major theories include dispositional (trait) perspective, psychodynamic, humanistic, biological, behaviorist, evolutionary, and social learning perspective. However, many researchers and psychologists do not explicitly identify themselves with a certain perspective and instead take an eclectic approach. Research in this area is empirically driven, such as dimensional models, based on [[multivariate statistics]], such as [[factor analysis]], or emphasizes theory development, such as that of the [[Psychodynamics|psychodynamic]] theory. There is also a substantial emphasis on the applied field of personality testing. In psychological education and training, the study of the nature of personality and its psychological development is usually reviewed as a prerequisite to courses in [[abnormal psychology]] or [[clinical psychology]].

==Philosophical assumptions==
Many of the ideas developed by historical and modern [[personality]] theorists stem from the basic philosophical assumptions they hold. The study of personality is not a purely empirical discipline, as it brings in elements of [[art]], [[science]], and [[philosophy]] to draw general conclusions. The following five categories are some of the most fundamental philosophical assumptions on which theorists disagree:&lt;ref name=Engler&gt;{{cite book|last=Engler|first=Barbara|title=Personality theories : an introduction|year=2008|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=Boston, MA|isbn=9780547148342|edition=8th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Freedom versus determinism''' – This is the question whether humans have control over their own behavior and understand the motives behind it or if their behavior is causally determined by forces beyond their control. Behavior is categorized as being either unconscious, environmental or biological by various theories.&lt;ref name=Engler /&gt;
* '''Heredity versus environment''' – Personality is thought to be determined largely either by [[genetics]] and [[biology]], or by environment and experiences. Contemporary research suggests that most personality traits are based on the joint influence of genetics and environment. One of the forerunners in this arena is [[C. Robert Cloninger]], who pioneered the Temperament and Character model.&lt;ref name=Engler /&gt;
* '''Uniqueness versus universality''' – This question discusses the extent of each human's individuality ([[uniqueness]]) or similarity in nature ([[Universality (philosophy)|universality]]). [[Gordon Allport]], [[Abraham Maslow]], and [[Carl Rogers]] were all advocates of the uniqueness of individuals. Behaviorists and cognitive theorists, in contrast, emphasize the importance of universal principles, such as reinforcement and self-efficacy.&lt;ref name=Engler /&gt;
* '''Active versus reactive''' – This question explores whether humans primarily act through individual initiative (active) or through outside [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]]. Traditional behavioral theorists typically believed that humans are passively shaped by their environments, whereas humanistic and cognitive theorists believe that humans are more active in their role.&lt;ref name=Engler /&gt; Most modern theorists agree that both are important, with aggregate behavior being primarily determined by traits and situational factors being the primary predictor of behavior in the short term.&lt;ref name = person_situation&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fleeson | first1 = W. | year = 2004 | title = Moving personality beyond the person-situation debate: The challenge and the opportunity of within-person variability | url = | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 13 | issue = 2| pages = 83–87 | doi=10.1111/j.0963-7214.2004.00280.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zayas|first=V|author2=Shoda Y|title=Three decades after the personality paradox: Understanding situations|journal=Journal of Research in Personality|year=2009|volume=43|pages=280–281|doi=10.1016/j.jrp.2009.03.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tapu|first=C.S.|title=Hypostatic personality: psychopathology of doing and being made|year=2001|publisher=Premier|isbn=9738030595|pages=28–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Optimistic versus pessimistic''' – Personality theories differ with regard to whether humans are integral in the changing of their own personalities. Theories that place a great deal of emphasis on learning are often more optimistic than those that do not.&lt;ref name=Engler /&gt;

== Personality theories ==

=== Type theories ===
[[Personality type]] refers to the psychological classification of different types of people. Personality types are distinguished from [[trait theory|personality traits]], which come in different degrees. There are many types of theories regarding personality, but each theory contains several and sometimes many sub theories. A "theory of personality" constructed by any given psychologist will contain multiple relating theories or sub theories often expanding as more psychologists explore the theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cartwright |first1=Desmond |title=Theories and Models of Personality |date=1979 |publisher=Wm. C. Brown Company Publishers |location=Debuque, Iowa |isbn=0-697-06624-X |page=178 |edition=I |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, according to type theories, there are two types of people, introverts and extroverts. According to trait theories, introversion and extroversion are part of a continuous dimension with many people in the middle. The idea of psychological types originated in the theoretical work of [[Carl Jung]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sharp |first=Daryl |title= Personality types: Jung's model of typology |year=1987 |publisher=Inner City Books |location= Toronto, Canada |isbn= 0919123309|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically in his 1921 book ''Psychologische Typen'' (''[[Psychological Types]]'')  and [[William Moulton Marston|William Marston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bradberry|first=T|title=Self-Awareness|year=2009|publisher=Penguin|isbn=1101148675}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Building on the writings and observations of Jung during World War II, [[Isabel Briggs Myers]] and her mother, Katharine C. Briggs, delineated personality types by constructing the [[Myers–Briggs Type Indicator]].&lt;ref name=Myers&gt;{{cite book |author=Myers, Isabel Briggs with Peter B. Myers|title=Gifts Differing: Understanding Personality Type |publisher=Davies-Black Publishing |location=Mountain View, California |origyear=1980|year=1995 |pages= |isbn=0-89106-074-X |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This model was later used by [[David Keirsey]] with a different understanding from Jung, Briggs and Myers.&lt;ref name=K123123123123123&gt;{{cite book |date= May 1, 1998 |title=Please Understand Me II: Temperament, Character, Intelligence |publisher=Prometheus Nemesis Book Co|edition=1st |isbn=1-885705-02-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the former Soviet Union, [[Lithuanian people|Lithuanian]] [[Aušra Augustinavičiūtė]] independently derived a model of personality type from Jung's called [[socionics]].

Theories could also be considered an "approach" to personality or psychology and is generally referred to as a model.  The model is an older and more theoretical approach to personality, accepting extroversion and introversion as basic psychological orientations in connection with two pairs of psychological functions:

* ''Perceiving functions:'' sensing and intuition (trust in concrete, sensory-oriented facts vs. trust in abstract concepts and imagined possibilities)
* ''Judging functions:'' thinking and feeling (basing decisions primarily on logic vs. deciding based on emotion).

Briggs and Myers also added another personality dimension to their type indicator to measure whether a person prefers to use a judging or perceiving function when interacting with the external world.  Therefore, they included questions designed to indicate whether someone wishes to come to conclusions (judgment) or to keep options open (perception).&lt;ref name=Myers/&gt;

This personality typology has some aspects of a trait theory: it explains people's behavior in terms of opposite fixed characteristics.  In these more traditional models, the sensing/intuition preference is considered the most basic, dividing people into "N" (intuitive) or "S" (sensing) personality types. An "N" is further assumed to be guided either by thinking or feeling and divided into the "NT" (scientist, engineer) or "NF" (author, humanitarian) temperament. An "S", in contrast, is assumed to be guided more by the judgment/perception axis and thus divided into the "SJ" (guardian, traditionalist) or "SP" (performer, artisan) temperament.&lt;!-- remark out undefined &lt;ref name=Keirsey/&gt; --&gt; These four are considered basic, with the other two factors in each case (including always extraversion/introversion) less important. Critics of this traditional view have observed that the types can be quite strongly stereotyped by professions (although neither Myers nor Keirsey engaged in such stereotyping in their type descriptions),&lt;ref name=Myers/&gt;&lt;!-- remark out undefined ref &lt;ref name=Keirsey/&gt; --&gt; and thus may arise more from the need to categorize people for purposes of guiding their career choice.&lt;ref name=Pittenger&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pittenger | first = David J. | title = Measuring the MBTI. . .And Coming Up Short | journal = Journal of Career Planning and Employment | volume = 54 | issue = 1 | pages = 48–52 |date=November 1993 | url = http://www.indiana.edu/~jobtalk/HRMWebsite/hrm/articles/develop/mbti.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This among other objections led to the emergence of the five-factor view, which is less concerned with behavior under work conditions and more concerned with behavior in personal and emotional circumstances.  (It should be noted, however, that the MBTI is not designed to measure the "work self", but rather what Myers and McCaulley called the "shoes-off self."&lt;ref name=manual_2&gt;{{cite book|last=Myers|first=Isabel Briggs|author2=Mary H. McCaulley|title=Manual: A Guide to the Development and Use of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator|publisher=Consulting Psychologists Press|location=Palo Alto, California|year=1985|edition=2nd|page=8|isbn=0-89106-027-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

[[Type A and Type B personality theory]]:  During the 1950s, [[Meyer Friedman]] and his co-workers defined what they called Type A and Type B behavior patterns. They theorized that intense, hard-driving Type A personalities had a higher risk of coronary disease because they are "stress junkies." Type B people, on the other hand, tended to be relaxed, less competitive, and lower in risk. There was also a Type AB mixed profile.

[[John L. Holland]]'s ''RIASEC'' vocational model, commonly referred to as the ''[[Holland Codes]]'', stipulates that six personality types lead people to choose their career paths. In this circumplex model, the six types are represented as a hexagon, with adjacent types more closely related than those more distant. The model is widely used in vocational counseling.

[[Eduard Spranger]]'s personality-model, consisting of six (or, by some revisions, 6 +1) basic types of ''value attitudes'', described in his book ''Types of Men'' (''Lebensformen''; Halle (Saale): Niemeyer, 1914; English translation by P. J. W. Pigors - New York: G. E. Stechert Company, 1928).

The [[Enneagram of Personality]], a model of human personality which is principally used as a typology of nine interconnected personality types. It has been criticized as being subject to interpretation, making it difficult to test or validate scientifically.

Perhaps the most ancient attempt at personality psychology is the [[Buddhist personality types|personality typology]] outlined by the Indian [[Buddhist]] [[Abhidharma]] schools. This typology mostly focuses on negative personal traits (greed, hatred, and delusion) and the corresponding positive [[meditation]] practices used to counter those traits.

=== Psychoanalytic theories ===

[[Psychoanalysis|Psychoanalytic]] theories explain human behavior in terms of the interaction of various components of personality. [[Sigmund Freud]] was the founder of this school of thought. Freud drew on the physics of his day (thermodynamics) to coin the term [[psychodynamics]]. Based on the idea of converting heat into mechanical energy, he proposed psychic energy could be converted into behavior. Freud's theory places central importance on dynamic, unconscious psychological conflicts.&lt;ref name=Kahn&gt;{{cite book|last=Kahn|first=Michael|title=Basic Freud : psychoanalytic thought for the twenty first century|year=2002|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=9780465037162|edition=1. paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud divides human personality into three significant components: the [[id, ego and super-ego]].  The '''id''' acts according to the ''pleasure principle'', demanding immediate gratification of its needs regardless of external environment; the '''ego''' then must emerge in order to realistically meet the wishes and demands of the id in accordance with the outside world, adhering to the ''reality principle''. Finally, the '''superego''' (conscience) inculcates moral judgment and societal rules upon the ego, thus forcing the demands of the id to be met not only realistically but morally. The superego is the last function of the personality to develop, and is the embodiment of parental/social ideals established during childhood. According to Freud, personality is based on the dynamic interactions of these three components.&lt;ref name="Carver"&gt;Carver, C., &amp; Scheier, M. (2004). ''Perspectives on Personality'' (5th ed.). Boston: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt;

The channeling and release of sexual (libidal) and aggressive energies, which ensues from the "Eros" (sex; instinctual self-preservation) and "Thanatos" (death; instinctual self-annihilation) drives respectively, are major components of his theory.&lt;ref name="Carver" /&gt;  It is important to note that Freud's broad understanding of sexuality included all kinds of pleasurable feelings experienced by the human body.

Freud proposed five psychosexual stages of personality development. He believed adult personality is dependent upon early childhood experiences and largely determined by age five.&lt;ref name="Carver" /&gt;  Fixations that develop during the infantile stage contribute to adult personality and behavior.

One of Sigmund Freud's earlier associates, [[Alfred Adler]], did agree with Freud that early childhood experiences are important to development and believed birth order may influence personality development. Adler believed that the oldest child was the individual who would set high achievement goals in order to gain attention lost when the younger siblings were born. He believed the middle children were competitive and ambitious.  He reasoned that this behavior was motivated by the idea of surpassing the firstborn's achievements.   He added, however, that the middle children were often not as concerned about the glory attributed with their behavior. He also believed the youngest would be more dependent and sociable. Adler finished by surmising that an only child loves being the center of attention and matures quickly but in the end fails to become independent.

[[Heinz Kohut]] thought similarly to Freud's idea of transference. He used [[narcissism]] as a model of how people develop their sense of self. Narcissism is the exaggerated sense of one self in which one is believed to exist in order to protect one's low self-esteem and sense of worthlessness. Kohut had a significant impact on the field by extending Freud's theory of narcissism and introducing what he called the 'self-object transferences' of mirroring and idealization. In other words, children need to idealize and emotionally "sink into" and identify with the idealized competence of admired figures such as parents or older siblings. They also need to have their self-worth mirrored by these people. These experiences allow them to thereby learn the self-soothing and other skills that are necessary for the development of a healthy sense of self.

Another important figure in the world of personality theory is [[Karen Horney]]. She is credited with the development of the "[[True self and false self|real self]]" and the "ideal self". She believes all people have these two views of their own self. The "real self" is how humans act with regard to personality, values, and morals; but the "ideal self" is a construct individuals implement in order to conform to social and personal norms.

=== Behaviorist theories ===

[[Behaviorism|Behaviorists]] explain personality in terms of the effects external stimuli have on behavior.  The approaches used to analyze the behavioral aspect of personality are known as behavioral theories or learning-conditioning theories. These approaches were a radical shift away from Freudian philosophy. One of the major tenets of this concentration of personality psychology is a strong emphasis on scientific thinking and experimentation.  This school of thought was developed by [[B. F. Skinner]] who put forth a model which emphasized the mutual interaction of the person or "the organism" with its environment.  Skinner believed children do bad things because the behavior obtains attention that serves as a reinforcer. For example: a child cries because the child's crying in the past has led to attention.  These are the ''response'', and ''consequences''.  The response is the child crying, and the attention that child gets is the reinforcing consequence. According to this theory, people's behavior is formed by processes such as [[operant conditioning]].  Skinner put forward a "three term contingency model" which helped promote analysis of behavior based on the "Stimulus - Response - Consequence Model" in which the critical question is: "Under which circumstances or antecedent 'stimuli' does the organism engage in a particular behavior or 'response', which in turn produces a particular 'consequence'?"&lt;ref name=Cheney&gt;{{cite book|last=Cheney|first=W. David Pierce, Carl D.|title=Behavior analysis and learning|year=2008|publisher=Psychology Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780805862607|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Herrnstein]] extended this theory by accounting for attitudes and traits.  An attitude develops as the response strength (the tendency to respond) in the presences of a group of stimuli become stable.  Rather than describing conditionable traits in non-behavioral language, response strength in a given situation accounts for the environmental portion.  Herrstein also saw traits as having a large genetic or biological component, as do most modern behaviorists.&lt;ref name=Cheney /&gt;

[[Ivan Pavlov]] is another notable influence. He is well known for his [[classical conditioning]] experiments involving dogs, which led him to discover the foundation of behaviorism.&lt;ref name=Cheney /&gt;

=== Social cognitive theories ===

In cognitive theory, behavior is explained as guided by cognitions (e.g. expectations) about the world, especially those about other people. Cognitive theories are theories of personality that emphasize cognitive processes, such as thinking and judging.

[[Albert Bandura]], a [[social learning theory|social learning theorist]] suggested the forces of [[memory]] and [[emotion]]s worked in conjunction with environmental influences. Bandura was known mostly for his "[[Bobo doll experiment]]". During these experiments, Bandura video taped a college student kicking and verbally abusing a bobo doll. He then showed this video to a class of kindergarten children who were getting ready to go out to play. When they entered the play room, they saw bobo dolls, and some hammers. The people observing these children at play saw a group of children beating the doll. He called this study and his findings observational learning, or modeling.

Early examples of approaches to cognitive style are listed by Baron (1982).&lt;ref&gt;Baron, J. (1982). "Intelligence and Personality." In R. Sternberg (Ed.). ''Handbook of Intelligence''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These include Witkin's (1965) work on field dependency, Gardner's (1953) discovering people had consistent preference for the number of categories they used to categorise heterogeneous objects, and Block and Petersen's (1955) work on confidence in line discrimination judgments. Baron relates early development of cognitive approaches of personality to [[ego psychology]]. More central to this field have been:

* [[Explanatory style|Attributional style theory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Abramson |first1=Lyn Y. |last2=Seligman |first2=Martin E. P. |last3=Teasdale |first3=John D. |date=1978 |title=Learned helplessness in humans: Critique and reformulation |journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology |volume=87 |issue=1 |pages=49–74 |doi=10.1037/0021-843X.87.1.49 |pmid=649856 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; dealing with different ways in which people explain events in their lives. This approach builds upon locus of control, but extends it by stating we also need to consider whether people attribute to stable causes or variable causes, and to global causes or specific causes.

Various scales have been developed to assess both attributional style and locus of control. Locus of control scales include those used by Rotter and later by Duttweiler, the Nowicki and Strickland (1973) Locus of Control Scale for Children and various locus of control scales specifically in the health domain, most famously that of Kenneth Wallston and his colleagues, The Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Scale.&lt;ref&gt;Wallston et al., 1978&lt;/ref&gt; Attributional style has been assessed by the Attributional Style Questionnaire,&lt;ref&gt;Peterson et al., 1982&lt;/ref&gt; the Expanded Attributional Style Questionnaire,&lt;ref&gt;Peterson &amp; Villanova, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; the Attributions Questionnaire,&lt;ref&gt;Gong-guy &amp; Hammen,  1990&lt;/ref&gt; the Real Events Attributional Style Questionnaire&lt;ref&gt;Norman &amp; Antaki, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; and the Attributional Style Assessment Test.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

* Achievement style theory focuses upon identification of an individual's Locus of Control tendency, such as by Rotter's evaluations, and was found by Cassandra Bolyard Whyte to provide valuable information for improving academic performance of students.&lt;ref name="Whyte1978"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Whyte |first=Cassandra Bolyard |year=1978 |title=Effective Counseling Methods for High-Risk College Freshmen |journal=Measurement and Evaluation in Guidance |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=198–200 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals with internal control tendencies are likely to persist to better academic performance levels, presenting an achievement personality, according to [[Cassandra B. Whyte]].&lt;ref name="Whyte1978" /&gt;

Recognition that the tendency to believe that hard work and persistence often results in attainment of life and academic goals has influenced formal educational and counseling efforts with students of various ages and in various settings since the 1970s research about achievement.&lt;ref name="LauridsenKurt"&gt;Lauridsen Kurt (ed) and Whyte, Cassandra B.

Jossey-Bass, Inc&lt;/ref&gt; Counseling aimed toward encouraging individuals to design ambitious goals and work toward them, with recognition that there are external factors that may impact, often results in the incorporation of a more positive achievement style by students and employees, whatever the setting, to include higher education, workplace, or justice programming.&lt;ref name="LauridsenKurt" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Whyte | first1 = Cassandra | last2 = Whyte | first2 = William R. | year = 1982 | title = Accelerated Programs Behind Prison Walls | url = | journal = College Student Journal | volume = 16 | issue = 1| pages = 70–74 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Walter Mischel]] (1999) has also defended a cognitive approach to personality. His work refers to "Cognitive Affective Units", and considers factors such as encoding of stimuli, affect, goal-setting, and self-regulatory beliefs. The term "Cognitive Affective Units" shows how his approach considers affect as well as cognition.

[[Cognitive-Experiential Self-Theory]] (CEST) is another cognitive personality theory.  Developed by Seymour Epstein, CEST argues that humans operate by way of two independent information processing systems: experiential system and rational system.  The experiential system is fast and emotion-driven.  The rational system is slow and logic-driven.  These two systems interact to determine our goals, thoughts, and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Seymour; In: Handbook of psychology: Personality and social psychology, Vol. 5. Millon, Theodore (Ed.); Lerner, Melvin J. (Ed.); Hoboken, NJ, US: John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc, 2003. pp. 159-184. [Chapter]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Personal construct theory|Personal construct psychology]] (PCP) is a theory of personality developed by the American psychologist [[George Kelly (psychologist)|George Kelly]] in the 1950s. Kelly's fundamental view of personality was that people are like naive scientists who see the world through a particular lens, based on their uniquely organized systems of construction, which they use to anticipate events. But because people are naive scientists, they sometimes employ systems for construing the world that are distorted by idiosyncratic experiences not applicable to their current social situation. A system of construction that chronically fails to characterize and/or predict events, and is not appropriately revised to comprehend and predict one's changing social world, is considered to underlie psychopathology (or mental illness.){{citation needed|date=October 2013}}
From the theory, Kelly derived a [[psychotherapy]] approach and also a technique called ''The Repertory Grid Interview'' that helped his patients to uncover their own "constructs"  with minimal intervention or interpretation by the therapist. The [[repertory grid]] was later adapted for various uses within organizations, including decision-making and interpretation of other people's world-views.&lt;ref name=Kelly&gt;{{cite book|last=Kelly|first=George A.|title=Theory of Personality : the psychology of personal constructs.|year=1980|publisher=Norton|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=0393001520|edition=1. publ. in ... pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Humanistic theories ===
[[Humanistic psychology]] emphasizes that people have [[free will]] and that this plays an active role in determining how they behave. Accordingly, humanistic psychology focuses on subjective experiences of persons as opposed to forced, definitive factors that determine behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Stefaroi, P. (2015). Humanistic Personology: A Humanistic-Ontological Theory of the Person &amp; Personality. Applications in Therapy, Social Work, Education, Management and Art (Theatre).  Charleston SC, USA: CreateSpace.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abraham Maslow]] and [[Carl Rogers]] were proponents of this view, which is based on the "phenomenal field" theory of Combs and Snygg (1949).&lt;ref&gt;Combs, Arthur W., and Snygg, Donald. '' : A New Frame of Reference for Psychology''. New York, Harper and Brothers. [http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/snygg&amp;combs.html Article on Snygg and Combs' Phenomenological Field Theory]&lt;/ref&gt; Rogers and Maslow were among a group of psychologists that worked together for a decade to produce the ''Journal of Humanistic Psychology''. This journal was primarily focused on viewing individuals as a whole, rather than focusing solely on separate traits and processes within the individual.

[[Robert W. White (psychologist)|Robert W. White]] wrote the book ''The Abnormal Personality'' that became a standard text on [[abnormal psychology]]. He also investigated the human need to strive for positive goals like competence and influence, to counterbalance the emphasis of [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] on the pathological elements of personality development.&lt;ref name=Watt&gt;{{cite book|last=Watt|first=Robert W. White ; Norman F.|title=The abnormal personality|year=1981|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=New York|isbn=978-0-471-04599-1|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maslow spent much of his time studying what he called "self-actualizing persons", those who are "fulfilling themselves and doing the best they are capable of doing". Maslow believes all who are interested in growth move towards self-actualizing (growth, happiness, satisfaction) views. Many of these people demonstrate a trend in dimensions of their personalities. Characteristics of self-actualizers according to Maslow include the four key dimensions:&lt;ref name=Maslow&gt;{{cite book|last=Maslow|first=Abraham H.|title=Toward a Psychology of Being|year=1999|publisher=Wiley|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=0-471-29309-1|edition=3.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Awareness''' – maintaining constant enjoyment and awe of life. These individuals often experienced a "peak experience". He defined a peak experience as an "intensification of any experience to the degree there is a loss or transcendence of self". A peak experience is one in which an individual perceives an expansion of themselves, and detects a unity and meaningfulness in life. Intense concentration on an activity one is involved in, such as running a marathon, may invoke a peak experience.
# '''Reality and problem centered''' – having a tendency to be concerned with "problems" in surroundings.
# '''Acceptance/Spontaneity''' – accepting surroundings and what cannot be changed.
# '''Unhostile sense of humor/democratic''' – do not take kindly to  joking about others, which can be viewed as offensive. They have friends of all backgrounds and religions and hold very close friendships.

Maslow and Rogers emphasized a view of the person as an active, creative, experiencing human being who lives in the present and subjectively responds to current perceptions, relationships, and encounters. They disagree with the dark, pessimistic outlook of those in the Freudian psychoanalysis ranks, but rather view humanistic theories as positive and optimistic proposals which stress the tendency of the human personality toward growth and self-actualization. This progressing self will remain the center of its constantly changing world; a world that will help mold the self but not necessarily confine it. Rather, the self has opportunity for maturation based on its encounters with this world. This understanding attempts to reduce the acceptance of hopeless redundancy. Humanistic therapy typically relies on the client for information of the past and its effect on the present, therefore the client dictates the type of guidance the therapist may initiate. This allows for an individualized approach to therapy. Rogers found patients differ in how they respond to other people. Rogers tried to model a particular approach to therapy- he stressed the reflective or empathetic response. This response type takes the client's viewpoint and reflects back their feeling and the context for it. An example of a reflective response would be, "It seems you are feeling anxious about your upcoming marriage". This response type seeks to clarify the therapist's understanding while also encouraging the client to think more deeply and seek to fully understand the feelings they have expressed.

=== Biopsychological theories ===

Biology plays a very important role in the development of personality. The study of the biological level in personality psychology focuses primarily on identifying the role of genetic determinants and how they mold individual personalities.&lt;ref&gt;Plomin, R., DeFries, J.C., McClearn, G.E., &amp; Rutter, M. (1997). ''Behavioral genetics'' (3rd Ed.). New York: Freeman.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the earliest thinking about possible biological bases of personality grew out of the case of [[Phineas Gage]]. In an 1848 accident, a large iron rod was driven through Gage's head, and his personality apparently changed as a result, although descriptions&lt;ref name="return_of_phineas"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Damasio H. |author2=Grabowski T |author3=.

In general, patients with brain damage have been difficult to find and study. In the 1990s, researchers began to use [[electroencephalography]] (EEG),  [[positron emission tomography]] (PET), and more recently [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), which is now the most widely used imaging technique to help localize personality traits in the brain.

====Genetic basis of personality====
Ever since the [[Human Genome Project]] allowed for a much more in depth understanding of genetics, there has been an ongoing controversy involving heritability, personality traits, and environmental vs. genetic influence on personality. The human genome is known to play a role in the development of personality.&lt;br /&gt;
Previously, genetic personality studies focused on specific genes correlating to specific personality traits. Today's view of the gene-personality relationship focuses primarily on the activation and expression of genes related to personality and forms part of what is referred to as [[behavioural genetics]]. Genes provide numerous options for varying cells to be expressed; however, the environment determines which of these are activated. Many studies have noted this relationship in varying ways in which our bodies can develop, but the interaction between genes and the shaping of our minds and personality is also relevant to this biological relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Gazzaniga, M.S., &amp; Heatherton, T.F. (2006). ''Psychological science: Mind, brain, and behavior'' (2nd ed.). New York: Norton.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
DNA-environment interactions are important in the development of personality because this relationship determines what part of the DNA code is actually made into proteins that will become part of an individual. It has been noted that while different choices are made available by the genome, in the end, the environment is the ultimate determinant of what becomes activated. Small changes in DNA in individuals are what lead to the uniqueness of every person as well as differences in looks, abilities, brain functioning, and all the factors that culminate to develop a cohesive personality.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, G. (2004). ''The birth of the mind.'' New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cattell and Eysenck have proposed that genetics have a strong influence on personality. A large part of the evidence collected linking genetics and the environment to personality have come from [[Twin study|twin studies]]. This "twin method" compares levels of similarity in personality using genetically identical [[twin]]s. One of the first of these twin studies measured 800 pairs of twins, studied numerous personality traits, and determined that identical twins are most similar in their general abilities. Personality similarities were found to be less related for self-concepts, goals, and interests.&lt;ref name="Loehlin"&gt;Loehlin, J.C., &amp; Nichols, R.C. (1976). ''Hereditary, environment, and personality: A study of 850 sets of twins.'' Austin: University of Texas Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Twin studies have also been important in the creation of the [[Big Five personality traits|five factor personality model]]: neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. Neuroticism and extraversion are the two most widely studied traits. A person that may fall into the extravert category can display characteristics such as impulsiveness, sociability, and activeness. A person falling into the neuroticism category may be more likely to be moody, anxious, or irritable. Identical twins, however, have higher correlations in personality traits than fraternal twins. One study measuring genetic influence on twins in five different countries found that the correlations for identical twins were .50, while for fraternal they were about .20.&lt;ref name="Loehlin" /&gt; It is suggested that heredity and environment interact to determine one's personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goldberg | first1 = L.R. | year = 1990 | title = An alternative "description of personality": The Big-Five factor structure | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 59 | issue = | pages = 1216–1229 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.59.6.1216 | pmid=2283588}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jeronimus2014"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jeronimus, B.F.|author2= Riese, H.|author3= Sanderman, R.|author4= Ormel, J.|year=2014|title= Mutual Reinforcement Between Neuroticism and Life Experiences: A Five-Wave, 16-Year Study to Test Reciprocal Causation|journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=107|issue=4|pages=751–64|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0037009|doi=10.1037/a0037009|pmid=25111305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary theory===

[[Charles Darwin]] is the founder of the [[Darwinism|theory of the evolution of the species]]. The evolutionary approach to personality psychology is based on this theory.&lt;ref name="Buss"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Buss | first1 = D.M. | year = 1991 | title = Evolutionary personality psychology | url = | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 42 | issue = | pages = 459–491 | doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.42.1.459}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory examines how individual personality differences are based on [[natural selection]]. Through natural selection organisms change over time through adaptation and selection. Traits are developed and certain genes come into expression based on an organism's environment and how these traits aid in an organism's survival and reproduction.

[[Polymorphism (biology)|Polymorphisms]], such as gender and blood type, are forms of diversity which evolve to benefit a species as a whole.&lt;ref name="Ford unk."&gt;[[E.B. Ford|Ford E.B.]] 1965. ''Genetic polymorphism''. Faber &amp; Faber, London.&lt;/ref&gt;  The theory of evolution has wide-ranging implications on personality psychology. Personality viewed through the lens of evolutionary psychology places a great deal of emphasis on specific traits that are most likely to aid in survival and reproduction, such as conscientiousness, sociability, emotional stability, and dominance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kenrick | first1 = D.T. | last2 = Sadalla | first2 = E.K. | last3 = Groth | first3 = G. | last4 = Trost | first4 = M.R. | year = 1990 | title = Evolution, traits, and the stages of human courtship: Qualifying the parental investment model | url = | journal = Journal of Personality | volume = 58 | issue = | pages = 97–116 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1990.tb00909.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The social aspects of personality can be seen through an evolutionary perspective. Specific character traits develop and are selected for because they play an important and complex role in the social hierarchy of organisms. Such characteristics of this social hierarchy include the sharing of important resources, family and mating interactions, and the harm or help organisms can bestow upon one another.&lt;ref name="Buss" /&gt;


=== Drive theories===

In the 1930s, [[John Dollard]] and [[Neal Elgar Miller]] met at [[Yale University]], and began an attempt to integrate drives (see [[Drive theory]]), into a theory of personality, basing themselves on the work of [[Clark Hull]]. They began with the premise that personality could be equated with the habitual responses exhibited by an individual – their habits. From there, they determined that these habitual responses were built on secondary, or acquired drives. 

Secondary drives are internal needs directing the behaviour of an individual that results from learning.&lt;ref name="Dollard, Smith, 1941"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dollard|first1=John|last2=Miller|first2=Neil|title=Social Learning and Imitation|date=1941|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, London|edition=Tenth}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Acquired drives are learned, by and large in the manner described by [[classical conditioning]]. When we are in a certain environment and experience a strong response to a stimulus, we internalize cues from the said environment.&lt;ref name="Dollard, Smith, 1941" /&gt; When we find ourselves in an environment with similar cues, we begin to act in anticipation of a similar stimulus.&lt;ref name="Dollard, Smith, 1941" /&gt; Thus, we are likely to experience anxiety in an environment with cues similar to one where we have experienced pain or fear – such as the dentist's office.  

Secondary drives are built on primary drives, which are biologically driven, and motivate us to act with no prior learning process – such as hunger, thirst or the need for sexual activity. However, secondary drives are thought to represent more specific elaborations of primary drives, behind which the functions of the original primary drive continue to exist.&lt;ref name="Dollard, Smith, 1941" /&gt; Thus, the primary drives of fear and pain exist behind the acquired drive of anxiety. Secondary drives can be based on multiple primary drives and even in other secondary drives. This is said to give them strength and persistence.&lt;ref name="Dollard, Smith, 1941" /&gt; Examples include the need for money, which was conceptualized as arising from multiple primary drives such as the drive for food and warmth, as well as from secondary drives such as imitativeness (the drive to do as others do) and anxiety.&lt;ref name="Dollard, Smith, 1941" /&gt;

Secondary drives vary based on the social conditions under which they were learned – such as culture. Dollard and Miller used the example of food, stating that the primary drive of hunger manifested itself behind the learned secondary drive of an appetite for a specific type of food, which was dependent on the culture of the individual.&lt;ref name="Dollard, Smith, 1941" /&gt;

Secondary drives are also explicitly social, representing a manner in which we convey our primary drives to others.&lt;ref name="Friedman and Schustack, 2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Friedman|first1=Howard.S.|last2=Schustack|first2=Miriam.W.|title=Personality: Classic Theories and Modern Research|date=2015|publisher=Pearson|isbn=978-0205997930|edition=Sixth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, many primary drives are actively repressed by society (such as the sexual drive).&lt;ref name="Dollard, Smith, 1941" /&gt; Dollard and Miller believed that the acquisition of secondary drives was essential to childhood development.&lt;ref name="Friedman and Schustack, 2015" /&gt; As children develop, they learn not to act on their primary drives, such as hunger but acquire secondary drives through reinforcement.&lt;ref name="Dollard, Smith, 1941" /&gt; Friedman and Schustack describe an example of such developmental changes, stating that if an infant engaging in an active orientation towards others brings about the fulfillment of primary drives, such as being fed or having their diaper changed, they will develop a secondary drive to pursue similar interactions with others – perhaps leading to an individual being more gregarious.&lt;ref name="Dollard, Smith, 1941" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Friedman and Schustack, 2015" /&gt; Dollard and Miller's belief in the importance of acquired drives led them to reconceive [[Sigmund Freud]]'s theory of psychosexual development.&lt;ref name="Friedman and Schustack, 2015" /&gt; They found themselves to be in agreement with the timing Freud used but believed that these periods corresponded to the successful learning of certain secondary drives.&lt;ref name="Friedman and Schustack, 2015" /&gt;

Dollard and Miller gave many examples of how secondary drives impact our habitual responses – and by extension our personalities, including anger, social conformity, imitativeness or anxiety, to name a few. In the case of anxiety, Dollard and Miller note that people who generalize the situation in which they experience the anxiety drive will experience anxiety far more than they should.&lt;ref name="Dollard, Smith, 1941" /&gt; These people are often anxious all the time, and anxiety becomes part of their personality.&lt;ref name="Dollard, Smith, 1941" /&gt; This example shows how drive theory can have ties with other theories of personality – many of them look at the trait of neuroticism or emotional stability in people, which is strongly linked to anxiety.

==Personality tests==

There are two major types of personality tests, projective and objective.

''Projective tests'' assume personality is primarily unconscious and assess individuals by how they respond to an ambiguous stimulus, such as an ink blot. Projective tests have been in use for about 60 years and continue to be used today. Examples of such tests include the [[Rorschach test]] and the [[Thematic Apperception Test]].

The Rorschach Test involves showing an individual a series of note cards with ambiguous ink blots on them. The individual being tested is asked to provide interpretations of the blots on the cards by stating everything that the ink blot may resemble based on their personal interpretation. The therapist then analyzes their responses. Rules for scoring the test have been covered in manuals that cover a wide variety of characteristics such as content, originality of response, location of "perceived images" and several other factors. Using these specific scoring methods, the therapist will then attempt to relate test responses to attributes of the individual's personality and their unique characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Exner, J.E. (1993). ''The Rorschach: A comprehensive system, Vol. 1: Basic foundations'' (3rd ed.). New York: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is that unconscious needs will come out in the person's response, e.g. an aggressive person may see images of destruction.&lt;br /&gt;
The Thematic Apperception Test (also known as the TAT) involves presenting individuals with vague pictures/scenes and asking them to tell a story based on what they see. Common examples of these "scenes" include images that may suggest family relationships or specific situations, such as a father and son or a man and a woman in a bedroom.&lt;ref&gt;Bellak, L., &amp; Abrams, D.M. (1997). ''The Thematic Apperception Test, the Children's Apperception Test, and the Senior Apperception Technique in clinical use'' (6th ed.). Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt; Responses are analyzed for common themes. Responses unique to an individual are theoretically meant to indicate underlying thoughts, processes, and potentially conflicts present within the individual. Responses are believed to be directly linked to unconscious motives. There is very little empirical evidence available to support these methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Watkins | first1 = C.E. | last2 = Campbell | first2 = V.L. | last3 = Nieberding | first3 = R. | last4 = Hallmark | first4 = R. | year = 1995 | title = Contemporary practice of psychological assessment by clinical psychologists | url = | journal = [[Professional Psychology, Research and Practice]] | volume = 26 | issue = | pages = 54–60 | doi=10.1037/0735-7028.26.1.54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Objective tests'' assume personality is consciously accessible and that it can be measured by self-report questionnaires. Research on psychological assessment has generally found objective tests to be more valid and reliable than projective tests. Critics have pointed to the [[Forer effect]] to suggest some of these appear to be more accurate and discriminating than they really are. Issues with these tests include false reporting because there is no way to tell if an individual is answering a question honestly or accurately.

The [[Myers–Briggs Type Indicator|Myers-Briggs Type Indicator]] (also known as the MBTI) is self-reporting questionnaire based on [[Carl Jung]]'s [[Type theory]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/mbti-basics/home.htm?bhcp=1|title=The Myers &amp; Briggs Foundation  - MBTI® Basics|website=www.myersbriggs.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inner experience==
Psychology has traditionally defined personality through its behavioral patterns, and more recently with neuroscientific studies of the brain.  In recent years, some psychologists have turned to the study of inner experiences for insight into personality as well as individuality. Inner experiences are the thoughts and feelings to an immediate phenomenon. Another term used to define inner experiences is [[qualia]]. Being able to understand inner experiences assists in understanding how humans behave, act, and respond. Defining personality using inner experiences has been expanding due to the fact that solely relying on behavioral principles to explain one's character may seem incomplete. Behavioral methods allow the subject to be observed by an observer, whereas with inner experiences the subject is its own observer.&lt;ref name=Price&gt;{{cite book|last=Price|first=Donald D.|title=Inner experience and neuroscience : merging both perspectives|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=9780262017657|author2=Barrell, James J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mihelic&gt;{{cite web|last=Mihelic|first=Janell|title=Exploring the phenomena of inner experience with descriptive experience sampling|url=http://digitalscholarship.unlv.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1862&amp;context=thesesdissertations|work=UNLV Theses/Dissertations/Professional Papers/Capstones}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methods measuring inner experience===
'''Descriptive experience sampling (DES)''', developed by psychologist Russel Hurlburt. This is an [[idiographic]] method that is used to help examine inner experiences. This method relies on an introspective technique that allows an individual's inner experiences and characteristics to be described and measured. A beep notifies the subject to record their experience at that exact moment and 24 hours later an interview is given based on all the experiences recorded. DES has been used in subjects that have been diagnosed with schizophrenia and depression. It has also been crucial to studying the inner experiences of those who have been diagnosed with common psychiatric diseases.&lt;ref name="Mihelic"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/22/health/22prof.html|title=Taking Mental Snapshots to Plumb Our Inner Selves|author=Hoffman, Jascha|date= December 21, 2009|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=3 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hurlburt|first=Russell|title=Iteratively Apprehending Pristine Experience|journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies|year=2009|volume=16|pages=156–188|url=http://faculty.unlv.edu/hurlburt/hurlburt-2009c.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Articulated thoughts in stimulated situations (ATSS)''': ATSS is a [[paradigm]] which was created as an alternative to the TA (think aloud) method. This method assumes that people have continuous internal dialogues that can be naturally attended to. ATSS also assesses a person’s inner thoughts as they verbalize their cognitions. In this procedure, subjects listen to a scenario via a video or audio player and are asked to imagine that they are in that specific situation. Later, they are asked to articulate their thoughts as they occur in reaction to the playing scenario. This method is useful in studying emotional experience given that the scenarios used can influence specific emotions. Most importantly, the method has contributed to the study of personality. In a study conducted by Rayburn and Davison (2002), subjects’ thoughts and empathy toward anti-gay hate crimes were evaluated. The researchers found that participants showed more aggressive intentions towards the offender in scenarios which mimicked hate crimes.&lt;ref name=Mihelic /&gt;

'''Experimental method''': This method is an experimental paradigm used to study human experiences involved in the studies of sensation and perception, learning and memory, motivation, and biological psychology. The experimental psychologist usually deals with intact organisms although studies are often conducted with organisms modified by surgery, radiation, drug treatment, or long-standing deprivations of various kinds or with organisms that naturally present organic abnormalities or emotional disorders. Economists and psychologists have developed a variety of experimental methodologies to elicit and assess individual attitudes where each emotion differs for each individual. The results are then gathered and quantified to conclude if specific experiences have any common factors. This method is used to seek clarity of the experience and remove any biases to help understand the meaning behind the experience to see if it can be generalized.&lt;ref name="Price" /&gt;

'''Poles in Kazakhstan''' form one portion of the [[Poles in the former Soviet Union|Polish diaspora in the former Soviet Union]]. Slightly less than half of Kazakhstan's Poles live in the [[Karaganda]] region, with another 2,500 in [[Astana]], 1,200 in [[Almaty]], and the rest scattered throughout rural regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Poujol|2007|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Migration history==
===Arrival===
The first Pole to travel to the territory which today makes up Kazakhstan was probably [[Benedict of Poland]], sent as part of the delegation of [[Pope Innocent IV]] to the [[Khagan]] [[Güyük Khan|Güyük]] of the [[Mongol Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Poujol|2007|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Migration of Poles to Kazakhstan, largely of an involuntary character, began soon after the [[Kazakh Khanate]] came under the control of the Russians. Captured participants of the 1830-1831 [[November Uprising]] and the 1863-1865 [[January Uprising]], as well as members of clandestine organisations, were sent into exile throughout the [[Russian Empire]]. By the time of the [[Russian Empire Census]] of 1897, there were already 11,579 Poles in Central Asia, 90 per cent male.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Iglicka|1998|pp=997–998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poles both inside and outside of the Soviet Union would later get caught up in [[population transfer in the Soviet Union|Stalinist population transfers]] in the late 1930s. At least 250,000 Poles from the Polish autonomous regions of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]] were deported to the [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakh SSR]] in 1930; among those, as many as 100,000 did not survive the first winter in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Iglicka|1998|pp=998–999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]], another 150,000 Poles were deported from eastern Polish territories to Kazakhstan; 80 per cent of these were women and children, as the adult men of their community were typically absent due to army service. After the end of the war, people who had been Polish citizens before September 1, 1939 were allowed to repatriate to Poland; however, no provision was made for earlier deportees to leave Kazakhstan.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Iglicka|1998|pp=998–999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Soviet Census (1970)|1970 Soviet census]] found 61,400 Poles (0.5 per cent of the population) in the Kazakh SSR, while the [[Soviet Census (1979)|1979 census]] found 61,100 (0.4 per cent) and the [[Soviet Census (1989)|1989 census]] 59,400 (0.4 per cent).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alekseenko|2001|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Polish scholars believe these numbers to be underestimates, due to the reluctance of Poles to register their true ethnicity in their official documentation and the relative ease of changing one's declared nationality to another, such as Ukrainian or Russian; they have given numbers ranging from 100,000 to 400,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Iglicka|1998|pp=1000–1001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Soviet emigration===
When [[History_of_Poland_(1945-1989)#End_of_Communist_rule_.281980.E2.80.931990.29|communist rule in Poland]] ended, there was great political enthusiasm on the part of the new Polish government for facilitating the repatriation of members of the Polish diaspora. However, up until 1996, there was no formal system for controlling the migration of ethnic Poles from the Soviet Union to Poland. Roughly 1,500 Poles from Kazakhstan came to Poland during this period, often on tourist visas. They were typically granted residency permits, but only a few managed to obtain [[Polish nationality law|Polish citizenship]]. However, legal reforms in 1996 and again in 1998 regularised the immigration procedures, allowing any ethnic Pole from abroad to settle in the country upon receiving an invitation from a company or association.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grzymala-Moszczynska|2003|p=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prospective emigrants were required to apply at the Polish consulate in Kazakhstan with documentary proof of their Polish ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grzymala-Moszczynska|2003|p=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1996-1998 academic survey, Poles who had emigrated from Kazakhstan cited a number of reasons for their departure, including the decreased social status of non-[[Kazakh language|Kazakh]]-speakers in the newly independent country, the local economic crisis which saw many salaries go unpaid, and the desire to avoid service in the [[Armed Forces of the Republic of Kazakhstan|Kazakhstani army]]. Some also claimed to survey takers that their female relatives were in danger of [[bride kidnapping]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grzymala-Moszczynska|2003|p=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to their experience with agriculture on ''[[kolkhoz]]'' during communism, many of the Poles in Kazakhstan were able to obtain invitations from rural communes in Poland, which hoped to revive farms that would otherwise be sold to German expatriates. However, in practise many were specialised with only one type of skill, and lacked familiarity with other aspects of farm operation that they would need in their new lives in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grzymala-Moszczynska|2003|pp=194–195}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, Polish students came to Kazakhstan with grants from the [[Ministry of Education (Poland)|Polish Ministry of Education]] (100 each year), and later invited their family members to join them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grzymala-Moszczynska|2003|p=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also reports of people from Poland travelling to Kazakhstan and selling invitations at a high price.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grzymala-Moszczynska|2003|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of repatriates might be as large as 20,000, and is partially reflected by a decrease in the Kazakhstan census' recorded number of Poles in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Poujol|2007|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
The first Polish Catholic church for exiles on the steppe was opened at [[Orenburg]] in 1844; another was opened in [[Omsk]] in 1862. (Both cities are today part of [[Russia]]). By 1917, the church at [[Petropavl]]ovsk had grown to 3,000 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Poujol|2007|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the years of exile and assimilation to Soviet-Russian society, for many Poles the Catholic religion was the only link to their ancestral culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Iglicka|1998|pp=998–999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inter-ethnic relations==
Poles tend to be settled in multi-ethnic regions of Kazakhstan, where settlers and exiles of many other nationalities predominated and members of the titular Kazakh nationality were few. Interethnic marriages between Poles and members of other European ethnic groups were quite common; however, those with members of traditionally Muslim ethnic groups were much rarer. An anthropological study conducted in 1993 found that Poles generally viewed the Kazakhs as lazy but friendly, and generally stated that inter-ethnic relations were good.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Iglicka|1998|pp=1003–1006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2959">'''Proprietism''' is an [[economic system]] composed of a vast network of [[sole-proprietorship]]s.

==Origins==
The rise of an independent workforce was documented by [[Daniel H. Pink]] in his 2001 book ''Free Agent Nation: The Future of Working for Yourself''. Depending on the precise definition of an independent worker, reports on the topic estimate this type of worker to be somewhere between thirty and forty percent of the entire workforce in the [[United States]], and analysis of the data reveals the trend to be rising.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ir.kellyservices.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=599317 "Changes in the Labor Market Leads to Increase in Free Agent Workforce, According to Kelly Services, Inc."] "Intuit" Retrieved 20 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://http-download.intuit.com/http.intuit/CMO/intuit/futureofsmallbusiness/intuit_2020_report.pdf "Intuit 2020 Report: Twenty Trends That Will Shape the Next Decade"] "Intuit" Retrieved 19 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The ideology and term proprietism originated in the [[blogosphere]], initially in 2012 by Nick Wilson of proprietist.com and then was further developed from 2013 onward by Paul Kurke of proprietism.com. [[Sara Horowitz]] has also acknowledged the rise of independent contract workers, and has encouraged the movement by creating the [[Freelancers Union]], a [[non-profit organization]] for free agents.

==Core Concepts==
As in [[capitalism]], the resources of a proprietist system are allocated through [[market economy|market]] forces, though proprietism differs from capitalism because the structure implies a more decentralized ownership of capital, similar to that of a company with an [[employee stock ownership plan]]. According to Kurke, proprietism has the potential to resolve the [[principal-agent problem]] by structurally realigning productivity and innovation with compensation, assuming advances in [[information systems]] continue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://proprietism.com/?p=107 "Proprietism and Liability Shields"] "Proprietism".

Retrieved 19 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Kurke argues that proprietism already exists in the [[zeitgeist]], especially among [[millennials]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://proprietism.com/?p=9 "Social Media and the New Individualism"] "Proprietism".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3539">The job of the '''public editor''' is to supervise the implementation of proper [[journalism ethics]] at a newspaper, and to identify and examine critical errors or omissions, and to act as a liaison to the public. They do this primarily through a regular feature on a newspaper's [[editorial]] page. Because public editors are generally employees of the very newspaper they're criticizing, it may appear as though there is a possibility for bias. However, a newspaper with a high standard of ethics would not fire a public editor for a criticism of the paper; the act would contradict the purpose of the position and would itself be a very likely cause for public concern.

Many major newspapers in the U.S. use the public editor column as the voice for their [[Ombudsman#News ombudsman|ombudsman]], though this is not always so. Public editor columns cover a broader scope of issues and do not have an accreditation process, while in order to qualify as an ombudsman of any standing one must be a member of the [[Organisation of News Ombudsmen]].

The first newspaper to appoint an ombudsman was Tokyo's ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'' in 1922; the first American newspapers to appoint a public editor were the ''[[Louisville Courier-Journal]]'' and ''[[Louisville Times]]'' in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Ananny, "It’s time to reimagine the role of a public editor, starting at The New York Times," Nieman Lab, March 17, 2016, Neiman Foundation at Harvard, URL=http://www.niemanlab.org/2016/03/mike-ananny-its-time-to-reimagine-the-role-of-a-public-editor-starting-at-the-new-york-times/&lt;/ref&gt;

At ''[[The New York Times]]'', the position was created in response to the [[Jayson Blair#Plagiarism and fabrication scandal|Jayson Blair scandal]]. The ''Times''' first public editor was [[Daniel Okrent]], who held the position from December 2003 through May 2005.  Okrent's successor was [[Byron Calame]], who was followed by [[Clark Hoyt]], who held the position for three years. In August 2010, [[Arthur S. Brisbane]] assumed the post and held it until 2012, when [[Margaret M. Sullivan]] took the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/16/times-names-buffalo-news-editor-as-its-new-public-editor/|title=Times Names Buffalo News Editor as Its New Public Editor|last=Vega|first=Tanzina|date=16 July 2012|work=The New York Times|accessdate=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in April, 2016, Sullivan left the position to become a media columnist at the ''[[Washington Post]]''; her last column for the ''Times'' was dated April 16.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Sullivan, "Public Editor No. 5 Is Yesterday’s News," The New York Times, April 16, 2016, URL=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/17/public-editor/margaret-sullivan-new-york-times-public-editor.html&lt;/ref&gt;  She was replaced by [[Elizabeth Spayd]] in July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;Sydney Ember, "New York Times Names Elizabeth Spayd Its 6th Public Editor", The New York Times, May 18, 2016, URL=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/19/business/media/new-york-times-names-elizabeth-spayd-its-6th-public-editor.html&lt;/ref&gt;
On May 31, 2017, the ''Times'' announced that it was eliminating the public editor position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/31/business/media/new-york-times-buyouts.html |title=New York Times Will Offer Employee Buyouts and Eliminate Public Editor Role |work=The New York Times |date= |accessdate=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A minority adheres to [[Shia]] and other sects, including the [[Ahmadiyya]] community which originated in Punjab.

The homelands of Punjabi Muslims are mainly concentrated in the Pakistani [[Punjab, Pakistan|province of Punjab]]. They have a worldwide [[Punjabi diaspora|diaspora]], with significant communities in North America and the United Kingdom, and large expatriate populations in the Middle East.

Punjab literally means the '''land of five waters''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]:{{Nastaliq|پنج آب}} panj ("five") āb ("waters")). Punjab is often referred to as the [[breadbasket]] in both Pakistan and India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/01/30/india-election-punjab-idINDEE80S02520120130 | work=Reuters | title=Punjab, bread basket of India, hungers for change | date=January 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://water.columbia.edu/2012/03/07/columbia-water-center-released-new-whitepaper-restoring-groundwater-in-punjab-indias-breadbasket/ |title=Columbia Water Center Released New Whitepaper: "Restoring Groundwater in Punjab, India's Breadbasket" – Columbia Water Center|publisher=Water.columbia.edu |date=2012-03-07 |accessdate=2013-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main article|History of Punjab}}

===Ancient history===
[[File:IVC-major-sites-2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Map showing the sites and extent of the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]]. [[Harappa]] was the center of one of the core regions of the Indus Valley Civilization, located in central [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. The [[Harappan architecture]] and Harrapan Civilization was one of the most developed in the old [[Bronze Age]].]]
Punjab during [[Mahabharat]]a times was known as Panchanada.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?ei=uG2RTb3xCYXQcZeeuUA&amp;ct=result&amp;id=0bkMAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=abhira+yadav&amp;q=abhiras Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency ... – Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency ..., Volume 1, Part 1-page-11&lt;/ref&gt; Punjab was part of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]], more than 5000 years old.&lt;ref name="whereincity.com"&gt;[http://www.whereincity.com/india/punjab/punjab-history.php Punjab History – history of Punjab&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
The main site in Punjab was the city of [[Harrapa]]. The Indus Valley Civilization spanned much of what is today Pakistan and eventually evolved into the [[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]] civilization. The arrival of the Indo-Aryans led to the flourishing of the [[Vedic civilization]] along the length of the [[Indus River]]. This civilization shaped subsequent cultures in [[South Asia]] and [[Afghanistan]]. Although the archaeological site at Harappa was partially damaged in 1857 when engineers constructing the Lahore-Multan railroad used brick from the Harappa ruins for track ballast, an abundance of artifacts have nevertheless been found. Punjab was part of the great ancient empires including the [[Gandhara]] [[Mahajanapadas]], [[Achaemenids]], [[Macedonian Empire|Macedonians]], [[Mauryas]], [[Kushans]], [[Guptas]], [[Hindu Shahi]], [[Gurjara-Pratihara]] and old [[Rajputana]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Gurjara-Pratihara empire, comprising the territories stretching between Bihar, the Panjab and Kathiawar, was the last great pre-Muslim empire of north India." (Ronald Stuart McGregor: A History of Indian Literature. Page 03) Website: https://books.google.com/books?id=SGsOGT8Xej8C&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=gurjara-pratihara+punjab&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9N7IU-TgF4mZyAS2rYK4Aw&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=gurjara-pratihara%20punjab&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The best known ruler of the dynasty was Bhoja, who enjoyed a long reign of half a century (A.D. 840-890). During his reign the Gurjara-Pratiharas became an imperial power controlling Eastern Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and parts of Madhya Pradesh and Saurashtra.

[[File:Map of Vedic India.png|250px|thumb|left|Punjab was part of the [[Vedic Civilization]]]]
Due to its location, the Punjab region came under constant attack and influence from the west and witnessed centuries of foreign invasions by the [[Greeks]], [[Kushans]], [[Scythians]], [[Turkic peoples|Turks,]] [[Arabs]], and [[Demographics of Afghanistan|Afghans]]. The city of [[Taxila (modern)|Taxila]], claimed to have been founded by son of Taksh the son [[Bharata (Ramayana)|Bharat]] who was the brother of [[Rama|Ram]]. It was reputed to house the oldest university in the world,{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} [[Takshashila University]]. One of the teachers was the great [[Vedic period|Vedic]] thinker and politician [[Chanakya]]. Taxila was a great centre of learning and intellectual discussion during the [[Maurya Empire]]. It is a UN [[World Heritage site]], valued for its archaeological and religious history.

===Central Asian, Greek, and Persian Empires===
[[File:Mahmud and Ayaz and Shah Abbas I.jpg|thumb|200px|right|'''Mahmud and Ayaz'''&lt;br&gt; The Sultan is to the right, shaking the hand of the sheykh, with Ayaz standing behind him. Mahmud of Ghazni appointed Malik Ayaz as the ruler of Lahore, Punjab during the Ghaznavid era.]]
The northwestern part of the South Asia, including Punjab, was repeatedly invaded or conquered by various foreign empires, such as those of [[Tamerlane]], [[Alexander the Great]] and [[Genghis Khan]]. Having conquered [[Drangiana]], [[Arachosia]], [[Gedrosia]] and [[Seistan]] in ten days, Alexander crossed the [[Hindu Kush]] and was thus fully informed of the magnificence of the country and its riches in gold, gems and pearls. However, Alexander had to encounter and reduce the tribes on the border of Punjab before entering the luxuriant plains. Having taken a northeasterly direction, he marched against the Aspii (mountaineers), who offered vigorous resistance, but were subdued. Alexander then marched through [[Ghazni]], blockaded Magassa, and then marched to Ora and Bazira. Turning to the northeast, Alexander marched to Pucela, the capital of the district now known as Pakhli. He entered Western Punjab, where the ancient city of Nysa (at the site of modern-day [[Mong, Punjab|Mong]]) was situated. A coalition was formed against Alexander by the Cathians, the people of [[Multan]], who were very skillful in war. Alexander invested many troops, eventually killing seventeen thousand Cathians in this battle, and the city of Sagala (present-day [[Sialkot]]) was razed to the ground. Alexander left Punjab in 326 B.C. and took his army to Persia and [[Susa]].

===Arrival of Islam===
[[File:BullehShah.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bulleh Shah]] (1680–1757), a Muslim Sufi poet]]
The Punjabis followed a diverse plethora of faiths, when the [[Muslim]] [[Umayyad]] army led by [[Muhammad bin Qasim]] conquered Sindh and Southern Punjab in 712, by defeating Raja Dahir. The '''Umayyad Caliphate''' was the second [[Islamic]] [[caliphate]] established after the death of Prophet [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]]. It was ruled by the Umayyad dynasty, whose name derives from [[Umayya ibn Abd Shams]], the great-grandfather of the first Umayyad caliph. Although the Umayyad family originally came from the city of [[Mecca]], their capital was [[Damascus]].

Muslim Arab and Persian Sufis were the first to bring message of [[Islam]] to the population of Punjab. Over the next millennium Punjab was part of Muslim Empires consisting mostly of Turko-Persians in cooperation with local Punjabi tribes and others, which facilitated a millennium long Islamic dominance across South Asia and with its peak during large parts of the [[Mughal Empire]] . During the reign of [[Mahmud of Ghazni]], the province became an important center with Lahore as its second capital of the [[Ghaznavids|Ghaznavid Empire]] based out of [[Afghanistan]]. The Punjab region became predominantly [[Muslim]] due to [[missionary]] [[Sufi]] saints whose [[dargah]]s dot the landscape of [[Punjab region]].

===Mughal Empire===
The [[Mughals]] controlled the region from 1524 until around 1739 and implemented building projects such as the [[Shalimar Gardens (Lahore)|Shalimar Gardens]] and the [[Badshahi Mosque]], both situated in Lahore. Muslim soldiers, traders, architects, theologians and Sufis came from the rest of the Muslim world to the Islamic [[Sultanate]] in [[South Asia]]. Later, the [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] conqueror [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] made the Punjab a part of his [[Durrani Empire]] lasting until 1762.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aZk9XzqCFGUC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=durrani+empire+conquers+punjab&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kmKVVIHcD8mqU6KwgZAD&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=durrani%20empire%20conquers%20punjab&amp;f=false|title=The History of Afghanistan|accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pakistan Movement===
{{Further information|Punjab Muslim League}}
The Indian state of [[East Punjab (state)|East Punjab]] was created in 1947, when the Partition of India split the former British province of Punjab between India and Pakistan. The mostly Muslim western part of the province became Pakistan's [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab province]]; the mostly Sikh and Hindu eastern part became India's East Punjab state. Many Hindus and Sikhs lived in the west, and many Muslims lived in the east, and the fears of all such minorities were so great that the Partition saw many people displaced and much intercommunal violence.

[[Lahore]] and [[Amritsar]] were at the centre of the problem; the Boundary Commission was not sure where to place them – to make them part of India or Pakistan. The Commission decided to give Lahore to Pakistan, whilst Amritsar became part of India. Some areas in Punjab, including Lahore, [[Rawalpindi]], [[Multan]], and [[Gujrat District|Gujrat]], had a large Sikh and Hindu population, and many of the residents were attacked or killed. On the other side, in East Punjab, cities such as Amritsar, [[Ludhiana]], [[Gurdaspur]], [[Malerkotla]], [[Ambala]], [[Karnal]], [[Hisar (city)|Hisar]] and [[Jalandhar]] had a majority Muslim population, of which thousands were killed or emigrated.

===Independence===
In 1947 the Punjab province of [[British Raj|British India]] was divided along religious lines into [[West Punjab]] and [[East Punjab]]. Western Punjab was assimilated into the new country of [[Pakistan]], while East Punjab became a part of [[modern-day India]]. This led to massive rioting as both sides committed atrocities against fleeing refugees.

Punjab (Pakistan), which once formed a major region of British Punjab, was home to a large minority population of [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] [[Sikhs]] and [[Hindus]] up to 1947 apart from the Muslim majority.&lt;ref&gt;The Punjab in 1920s – A Case study of Muslims, Zarina Salamat, Royal Book Company, [[Karachi]], 1997. table 45, pp. 136. {{ISBN|969-407-230-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Migration between [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] was continuous before [[Pakistan Movement|independence]]. By the 1900s Western Punjab was predominantly Muslim and supported the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] and [[Pakistan Movement]]. After independence, the minority [[Hindu]]s and [[Sikh]]s migrated to [[India]] while [[Muslim]] refugees from [[India]] settled in the Western Punjab and across [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;Dube, I. &amp;. S. (2009). From ancient to modern: Religion, power, and community in India hardcover. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent history===
[[File:Pakistani Ranger.jpg|thumb|At the [[Wagah border ceremony]]]]
Since the 1950s, Punjab industrialized rapidly. New factories were established in [[Lahore]], [[Multan]], [[Gujrat city|Gujrat]], [[Gujranwala]], [[Sialkot]] and [[Wah]]. In the 1960s, the new city of [[Islamabad]] was founded north of [[Rawalpindi]].

[[Agriculture]] continues to be the largest sector of Punjab's economy. The province is the breadbasket of the country as well as home to the largest ethnic group in Pakistan, the [[Punjabis]]. Unlike neighbouring India, there was no large-scale redistribution of agricultural land. As a result, most rural areas are dominated by a small set of feudalistic [[Zamindar|land-owning families]].

In the 1950s there was tension between the eastern and western halves of Pakistan. In order to address the situation, a new formula resulted in the abolition of the province status for Punjab in 1955. It was merged into a single province [[West Pakistan]]. In 1972, after [[East Pakistan]] seceded and became [[Bangladesh]], Punjab again became a province.

Punjab witnessed major battles between the armies of [[Indian Army|India]] and [[Pakistan Army|Pakistan]] in the wars of [[1965 War|1965]] and [[1971 War|1971]]. Since the 1990s Punjab hosted several key sites of Pakistan's nuclear program such as [[Kahuta]]. It also hosts major military bases such as at [[Sargodha]] and [[Rawalpindi]]. The peace process between India and Pakistan, which began in earnest in 2004, has helped pacify the situation. Trade and people-to-people contacts through the [[Wagah]] border are now starting to become common. Indian Sikh pilgrims visit holy sites such as [[Nankana Sahib]].

Starting in the 1980s, large numbers of Punjabis migrated to the [[Middle East]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Spain]], [[Canada]] and the [[United States]] for economic opportunities, forming the large [[Punjabi diaspora]]. Business and cultural ties between the [[United States]] and Punjab are growing.

In 1960, Justice Siddiqui started legal practice at the [[Sindh High Court]].

Justice Siddiqui was awarded honorary membership of the Judicial fraternity of [[Australia]] and [[Canada]] after the news of his resignation from the office of the [[Chief Justice of Pakistan|Chief Justice]] was made public in January 2000, after his refusal to take the Oath under the [[The Oath of Office (Judges) Order, 2000|PCO (Provisional Constitutional Order)]], which was an extra-constitutionally prescribed Oath for the Judges by the military regime of [[Pervez Musharraf]]. Saeeduzzaman Siddiqui received a letter of commendation from the Judiciary of the United Kingdom and was inducted in the roles of Judges of imminence by the British Judiciary for his stand in the cause of the independence of Pakistan's Judiciary, his stand was later glorified by the [[lawyers movement]] in Pakistan which helped Chief Justice Ifthikar Chaudhary's restoration.

==Career==
Justice Saeeduzzaman joined the Bar (February 1961); enrolled as Advocate of High Court of West Pakistan (November 1963); enrolled as Advocate of Supreme Court of Pakistan (November 1969); elected Joint Secretary, Karachi High Court Bar Association (1967); elected Member of Managing Committee of Karachi High Court Bar Association (1968–69); elected Honorary Secretary of High Court Bar Library (1977) and continued as such until elevated as [[Judge]] of [[Sindh High Court]] on 05-05-1980.He was appointed as [[Chief Justice]] of the [[Sindh High Court]] on 05-11-1990. Appointed as [[Judge]], [[Supreme Court of Pakistan]] on 23-05-1992. Appointed as [[Chief Justice of Pakistan]]/Chairman Pakistan Law Commission w.e.f. 01-07-1999 till 1 December 2005.

He was the [[Chief Justice of Pakistan]] when the [[1999 Pakistani coup d'état|1999 military coup d'état]] was staged by then-[[Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (Pakistan)|Chairman]] of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee]] and [[Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)|Chief of Army Staff]] General [[Pervez Musharraf]]. Notably, he defied the request given by Musharraf via the Law Minister and Legal Adviser [[Sharifuddin Pirzada]] to take a new oath under the [[Provisional Constitutional Order]] (PCO) saying that: "Taking an oath under the PCO, in my opinion, will be a deviation from the oath I had taken to defend the constitution of 1973". The PCO not only negated the independence of the judiciary and democratic norms, but also prolonged the martial law by nullifying the effect of any judgement given against [[President of Pakistan|President]] [[Pervez Musharraf]]'s government.

As a consequence of this, he was forced to step down from his position, by the military regime. The tenure time period was shortened due to his refusal to take the Provisional Constitutional Order (PCO) Oath, prescribed by General Pervez Musharraf to legitimize the LFO. After a long discussion with 4 Army generals sent to his residence by General Musharraf; namely, Lieutenant-General (Retired) [[Moinuddin Haider]], who was [[Interior Minister of Pakistan|Interior Minister]], then-Lieutenant-General [[Ehsan ul Haq]], Core-commander of the [[XI Corps (Pakistan)|XI Corps]], Lieutenant-General (retired) [[Mahmud Ahmed]], then-[[Director General]] of the [[Inter-Services Intelligence|ISI]] and [[Brigadier-General]] (retired) [[Javed Ashraf Bajwa]]; Chief Justice Siddiqui refused to take the [[The Oath of Office (Judges) Order, 2000|Oath]] after which the Generals left and on orders of the GHQ was executed, which had authorized the house arrest of him and his family.

On 25 August 2008, [[Nawaz Sharif]] announced that Saeeduzzaman Siddiqui would be [[Pakistan Muslim League (N)]] and [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]] nominee to replace Pervez Musharraf as [[President of Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cnnwire.blogs.cnn.com/2008/08/25/sharif-withdraws-party-from-pakistan-ruling-coalition/ CNN Wire: Sharif withdraws party from Pakistan ruling coalition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916231304/http://cnnwire.blogs.cnn.com/2008/08/25/sharif-withdraws-party-from-pakistan-ruling-coalition/ |date=16 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He lost the 6 September 2008 [[Pakistani presidential election, 2008]], by 153 votes to [[Asif Ali Zardari]], who was elected President of Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7600917.stm|title=BBC NEWS – South Asia – Bhutto's widower wins presidency|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/07/world/asia/07zardari.html|title=Bhutto’s Widower Wins Pakistani Presidency|date=7 September 2008|work=The New York Times|accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PML-N although in power wanted Siddiqui as a unanimous candidate as he was the only nonpartisan candidate contesting this election of 2008.

The '''Saho''' sometimes called '''Soho''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa4010/is_200103/ai_n8950806|title=FindArticles.com - CBSi|work=findarticles.com|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; are an ethnic group inhabiting the [[Horn of Africa]]. They are principally concentrated in [[Eritrea]], with some also living in adjacent parts of [[Ethiopia]]. They speak [[Saho language|Saho]] as a mother tongue, which belongs to the [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] branch of the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] family&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jwjX_yVT7AoC&amp;pg=PA162&amp;dq=saho+people+cushitic#v=onepage&amp;q=saho%20people%20cushitic&amp;f=false|title=The Saho of Eritrea: Ethnic Identity and National Consciousness|last=Mohammad|first=Abdulkader Saleh|date=2013-01-01|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|year=|isbn=9783643903327|location=|pages=162|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is closely related to [[Afar language|Afar]].

==Demographics==
[[File:Eritrean Women.jpeg|thumb|Saho women in traditional attire.]]
According to ''[[Ethnologue]]'', there are approximately 271,180 total Saho speakers. Most are concentrated in Eritrea (235,000 speakers), with the remainder inhabiting Ethiopia (36,180 speakers). Within Eritrea, the Saho primarily reside in the [[Southern Region, Eritrea|Southern]] and [[Northern Red Sea Region, Eritrea|Northern Red Sea]] regions.&lt;ref name="Ethnsah"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=ssy|title=Saho|work=ethnologue.com|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Saho have a system of [[clan]]s (11 at present), which are in turn divided into [[kinship]] groups. Clan loyalty is an important factor in Saho politics.

==Language==
The Saho people speak the [[Saho language]] as a [[mother tongue]]. It belongs to the [[Saho-Afar languages|Saho-Afar]] dialect cluster of the [[Lowland East Cushitic languages]], which are part of the [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] branch of the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] family. The Saho language is quite similar to [[Afar language|Afar]].&lt;ref name="Ethnsah"/&gt;

The Irob dialect is only spoken in Ethiopia.&lt;ref name="Ethnsah"/&gt;

==Religion==
The Saho are predominantly [[Muslim]]. A few [[Christianity|Christians]], who are also known as the [[Irob people|Irob]], live in the [[Tigray region]] of Ethiopia and the [[Debub Region]] of Eritrea.&lt;ref name=Allsaho&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allsaho.com/|title=allsaho.com|work=allsaho.com|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Customary law==
[[File:Flag of the Saho people.png|thumb|Saho ethnic flag]]
Regarding the customary law of the Saho, when there is an issue the Saho tend to call for a meeting or conference which they call '"''rahbe''". In such a meeting the Saho people discuss how to solve issues related to water, pasture or land, clan disputes and how to alleviate these problems. This is also discussed with neighboring tribes or ethnic groups and sub-clans to reach a consensus. &lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=LN-ncVoNpSAC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=saho+people#v=onepage&amp;q=saho%20people&amp;f=false|title=Qānūn Al-ʻurfī Li-muslimī Ākalaguzāī|last=|first=|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=26|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A skilled representative is chosen for this meeting, this representative is called a "''madarre''". A madarre brings forth arguments to his audience and sub-clans or tribes who are involved and tries to win them over. This is discussed with clan or tribal wise men or elders, "ukal". 

On smaller scale conflicts between 2 individuals, one of the 2 takes their grievances to the "''ukal''", they in turn appoint "''shimagale"'' or mediators for the dispute&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The '''Santhal''', or rarely '''Santhals''', are an ethnic group, native to Nepal and the Indian states of [[Jharkhand]], [[Assam]], [[West Bengal]], [[Bihar]] and [[Odisha]]. Santhals are the largest indigenous tribe in Jharkhand in terms of population. There is also a significant Santhal minority in neighboring [[Bangladesh]], and a small population in Nepal and Bhutan. The Santals mostly speak [[Santali language|Santhali]], an [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] language and that is the most widely-spoken of the [[Munda languages]].

== Religion ==
One of the most studied, the Santal religion worships ''Marang buru or ''Bonga as the Supreme Deity. The majority of reverence, however, falls on a court of spirits (''Bonga''), who handle different aspects of the world and who are placated with prayers and offerings in order to ward off evil influences. These spirits operate at the village, household, ancestor, and sub-clan level, along with evil spirits that cause disease and can inhabit village boundaries, mountains, water, tigers, and the forest. A characteristic feature of a Santhal village is a sacred [[grove (nature)|grove]] (known as the ''Jaher''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jaher Worshiping Place of Santhals|url=http://india-portrayed.blogspot.in/2008/08/jaher-worshiping-place-of-santals.html|accessdate=2014-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "Santal Sthal") on the edge of the village where many spirits live and where a series of annual festivals take place.&lt;ref name="tr"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://countrystudies.us/india/57.htm |title=The Green Revolution in India |work=U.S. Library of Congress Country Studies (released in [[public domain]]) |accessdate=2007-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A yearly round of rituals connected with the agricultural cycle, along with life-cycle rituals for birth, marriage and burial at death, involve petitions to the spirits and offerings that include the sacrifice of animals, usually birds. Religious leaders are male specialists in medical cures who practice divination and witchcraft (the socio-historic meaning of the term, used here, refers to the ritual practice of magic and is not pejorative). Similar beliefs are common among other tribes of northeast and central India such as the [[Kharia people|Kharia]], [[Munda people|Munda]], and [[Oraon]].&lt;ref name=tr /&gt;

Smaller and more isolated tribes often demonstrate articulated classification systems of the spiritual hierarchy less well documented, described as animism or a generalized worship of spiritual energies connected with locations, activities, and social groups. Religious concepts are intricately entwined with ideas about nature and interaction with local ecological systems. As in Santal religion, religious specialists are drawn from the village or family and serve a wide range of spiritual functions that focus on placating potentially dangerous spirits and coordinating rituals.&lt;ref name=tr /&gt;

== Culture ==
[[Sohrai]] is the principal festival of Santal community. Besides that [[Baha parab|Baha]], [[Karam (festival)|Karam]], [[Dansai]], [[Sakrat]], [[Mahmore]], [[Rundo]], [[Magsim]] etc. are important. The Santal traditionally accompany many of their dances during these festivals with two drums: the Tamak‘ and the Tumdak’.&lt;ref name="Chadar Badar"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1110107/jsp/jharkhand/story_13400270.jsp | title=Chadar Badar | publisher=Telegraph | date=2015 | accessdate=2015-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chadar Badar]], a form of [[puppetry]] known also as Santal puppetry, is a folk show involving wooden puppets placed in a small cage which acts as the stage.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1595">'''''Siqqitiq''''' (meaning transforming one's life, more specifically adopting Christianity) is the ritual of converting [[Inuit]] with [[Shamanism|shamanist]] beliefs to [[Christianity]]. This is usually accompanied by [[ritual]]istic [[ingestion|consumption]] of foods held [[taboo]] by [[shaman]]ist belief (like [[Reindeer|caribou]] [[lung]] and [[heart]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erudit.org/revue/etudinuit/2002/v26/n1/009274ar.pdf The birth of a [[Catholic]] Inuit community. The transition to Christianity in Pelly Bay, Nunavut, 1935-1950]&lt;/ref&gt;), to underscore the fact that such [[taboo]]s no longer apply. The word could also refer to the [[Eucharist|communion]] meal itself. [[Umik]], the first Inuit [[Evangelism|evangelist]] used such methods for conversion, which turned into a [[ritual]]. The practice is now rare because most [[Inuit]] are already Christians. ''Siqqitiqtuq'' (literally: getting into [[water]], or wetting with [[water]]) means [[baptism]].

'''Sir Thomas Bernard, 3rd Baronet''' (27 April 1750 – 1 July 1818) was an [[England|English]] social reformer whose father, as governor of the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]] (1760–1770), played a responsible part in directing the British policy which led to the [[American Revolutionary War|revolt of the American colonies]].  
==Life==
He was born at [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]], the younger son of [[Sir Francis Bernard, 1st Baronet]]. Rather late in his life, on the death of his elder brother in 1810, Bernard succeeded to the [[baronet]]cy conferred on his father in 1768. {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

His early education was obtained at [[Harvard College]], in which his father took a great interest. He then acted as confidential secretary to his father during the troubles which led (1769) to the governor's recall, and accompanied Sir Francis to England, where he was called to the bar, and practised as a [[conveyancer]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

He married a rich wife, and acquired a considerable fortune, and then devoted most of his time to social work for the benefit of the poor. From 1795 to 1806 he was treasurer of the [[Foundling Hospital]] for abandoned babies, in the concerns of which he took an important part. After his treasurership he continued to play a role on the charity's Court of Governors holding the honorary title of Vice President, but resigned when taking on the baronetcy in 1810. He also helped to establish in 1796 the "Society for Bettering the Condition and Increasing the Comforts of the Poor," in 1800 a school for indigent blind, and in 1801 a fever institution.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} He was a founding Director of the [[British Institution]] in 1805.

He was active in promoting [[vaccination]], improving the conditions of [[child labour]], advocating [[rural allotments]], and agitating against the [[salt duties]]. He took great interest in education, and with [[Benjamin Thompson|Count Rumford]] he was an originator of the [[Royal Institution]] in [[London]]. He died without issue on 1 July 1818.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Sir Thomas was also a Director and leading proponent of the [[Regent's Canal]]. He was approached in 1811 by [[John Nash (architect)]], the architect, who was a leading advocate of the canal and was present at the Percy Street Meeting, on 31 May 1811 at which a steering committee was set up to plan the building of a canal across north London. Social reformers favoured canals in this period because they greatly reduced the price of coal for the poor, and at that time gas lighting was also being adopted, using gas made from coal. Gas lighting was cheaper than candles. Sir Thomas played a prominent part in the management of the troubled canal throughout his remaining years. In 1818 it was he who finally settled a long-running acrimonious dispute with William Agar of Elm Lodge, whose determined opposition and clever but awkward behaviour had frustrated the canal's construction. Sadly he died just a few weeks after his moment of greatest success when he had resolved this major difficulty by negotiation, so he did not live to see the canal completed.

He was buried beneath the chapel of the Foundling Hospital, London, which was demolished in 1928.

Founded in 1960, the organization developed and expanded rapidly in the mid-1960s before dissolving at its last convention in 1969.

SDS has been an important influence on student organizing in the decades since its collapse.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} [[Participatory democracy]], [[direct action]], radicalism, student power, shoestring budgets, and its organizational structure are all present in varying degrees in current American student activist groups.&lt;sup&gt;[''[[Wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']&lt;/sup&gt; Though various organizations have been formed in subsequent years as proposed national networks for left-wing student organizing, none has approached the scale of SDS, and most have lasted a few years at best.

A [[Students for a Democratic Society (2006 organization)|new incarnation of SDS]] was founded in 2006.

== Origins ==
SDS developed from the [[Student League for Industrial Democracy (1946-1959)|Student League for Industrial Democracy]] (SLID), the youth branch of a socialist educational organization known as the [[League for Industrial Democracy]] (LID). LID descended from the [[Intercollegiate Socialist Society]], started in 1905. Early in 1960, the SLID changed its name into SDS at the behest of its then acting Director, [[Aryeh Neier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z5_hgLHYUiwC&amp;pg=PR20|last1=Neier|first1=Aryeh|title=Taking Liberties: Four Decades in the Struggle for Rights|date=2003|publisher=Public Affairs/Perseus Books |location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=1586482912|pages=Introduction:xx|quote=As director of LID, I decided to try to invigorate its student division.  One step in that direction was to rename it.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase "industrial democracy" sounded too narrow and too labor oriented, making it more difficult to recruit students.  Moreover, because the LID's leadership did not correspond to the expectations and the mood on the campuses, the SLID felt the need to dissociate itself from its parent organization. SDS held its first meeting in 1960 on the [[University of Michigan]] campus at [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], where [[Alan Haber]] was elected president. Its political manifesto, known as the [[Port Huron Statement]], was adopted at the organization's first convention in 1962,&lt;ref name="'70s"&gt;{{cite book |title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|coauthors= |year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York, New York|page= 8|pages= |url= |isbn= 0465041957 }}&lt;/ref&gt; based on an earlier draft by staff member [[Tom Hayden]].

The [[Port Huron Statement]] criticized the political system of the United States for failing to achieve international peace and critiqued [[Cold War]] [[foreign policy]], the threat of [[nuclear war]], and the [[arms race]]. In domestic matters, it criticized [[racial discrimination]], economic inequality, big businesses, [[trade union]]s and [[political party|political parties]]. In addition to its critique and analysis of the American system, the manifesto also suggested a series of reforms: it proclaimed a need to reshape into two genuine political parties to attain greater democracy, for stronger power for individuals through citizen's lobbies, for more substantial involvement by workers in business management, and for an enlarged public sector with increased government welfare, including a "program against poverty." The manifesto provided ideas of what and how to work for and to improve, and also advocated [[nonviolence|nonviolent]] [[civil disobedience]] as the means by which student youth could bring forth a "participatory democracy." Kirkpatrick Sale described the manifesto as "nothing less than an ideology, however raw and imperfect and however much would have resisted this word."&lt;ref name="sds-1960s"&gt;[http://www.sds-1960s.org/books/sds.pdf Kirkpatrick Sale, ''SDS'', pp. 159-163.  Random House (1973), Hardcover, Vintage Books (January 1, 1974).] {{ISBN|0394478894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The manifesto also presented SDS's break with the left-wing policies of the postwar years. Firstly, it was written with the same overall vision all along the document and reflected their view that all problems in every area were linked to each other and their willingness not to lead single-issue struggles but a broad struggle on all fronts at the same time. Then, it expressed SDS's willingness to work with groups whatever may be their political inclination and announced their rejection of [[anti-communism]], a definitely new radical view contrasting with much of the [[American Left]] which had developed a policy of anti-communism. Without being Marxist or pro-communism, they denounced anti-communism as being a social problem and an obstruction to democracy. They also criticized the United States for its exaggerated paranoia and exclusive condemnation of the Soviet Union, and blamed this for being the reason for failing to achieve disarmament and to assure peace.

The [[Port Huron, Michigan|Port Huron]] Convention opened with a symbol of this break with the policy of the past years: the delegate of the Communist Progressive Youth Organizing Committee asked to attend the conference as an observer. The people from the Young People's Socialist League objected while most of the SDSers insisted on letting him sit. He eventually sat. Later in the meeting, [[Michael Harrington]], an LID member, became agitated over the manifesto because he found the stand they took toward the [[Soviet Union]] and authoritarian regimes in general was insufficiently critical, and because, according to him, they deliberately wrote sections to pique the liberals. Surprisingly, Roger Hagan, a liberal, defended the SDS and its policy. After lively debates between the two, the draft finally remained more or less unchanged.
Some two weeks later, a meeting between the LID and SDS was held where the LID expressed its discontent about the manifesto. As a result, Haber and Hayden, at this time respectively the National secretary and the new President of the organization, were summoned to a hearing on the 6 July 1962. There, Hayden clashed with Michael Harrington (as he later would with [[Irving Howe]]&lt;ref&gt;Gitlin, Todd. "The Sixties", Bantam; Revised edition (July 1, 1993) {{ISBN|0-553-37212-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;) over the perceived potential for totalitarianism among other things. Harrington denounced the seating of the PYOC member, SDS's tolerance for communism and their lack of clarity in their condemnation of communist totalitarianism and authoritarianism, and he reproached SDS for providing only a mild critique of the Soviet Union and for blaming the cold war mostly on the United States. Hayden then asked him to read the manifesto more carefully, especially the section on values. Hayden later wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;While the draft Port Huron Statement included a strong denunciation of the Soviet Union, it wasn't enough for LID leaders like Michael Harrington. They wanted absolute clarity, for example, that the United States was blameless for the nuclear arms race.... In truth, they seemed threatened by the independence of the new wave of student activism...&lt;ref&gt;Tom Hayden and Dick Flacks, 'The Port Huron Statement at 40' in ''The Nation'', 5 August 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The tension between SDS and the LID was greatly increased when SDS called for a national demonstration to take place during the spring of 1965. The LID was very concerned about "Communist" participation but SDS refused to restrict who could attend and what signs they could use. The rift opened even further when, at the 1965 SDS National Convention, the clause excluding communists from membership was deleted from the SDS constitution. During the summer of 1965 delegates from SDS and the LID met in Chicago and New York. The League for Industrial Democracy, SDS's sponsoring organization, objected to the removal of the exclusion clause in the SDS constitution,&lt;ref&gt;[[Todd Gitlin]] later acknowledged that LID President [[Tom Kahn]], "to his eternal credit", was correct in opposing that deletion, which helped Marxist Leninists to take over SDS: Todd Gitlin, p. 88, in discussion with [[Irving Howe]]: ''Politics and the Intellectual: Conversations with Irving Howe''.

By mutual agreement the relationship was severed October 4, 1965.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sds-1960s.org/books/sds.pdf Kirkpatrick Sale, ''SDS'', pp. 157-159.

== Early years: 1962–1965 ==
{{More footnotes|date=May 2008}}
In the academic year 1962–1963, the President was [[Tom Hayden]], the Vice President was [[Paul Booth (labor organizer)|Paul Booth]] and the National Secretary was Jim Monsonis.  There were nine chapters with, at most, about 1000 members.  The national office (NO) in [[New York City]] consisted of a few desks, some broken chairs, a couple of file cabinets and a few typewriters.  As a student group with a strong belief in decentralization and a distrust for most organizations, the SDS did not have a strong central bureaucracy.  The three stalwarts at the office, Don McKelvey, Steve Max, and the National Secretary, Jim Monsonis, worked long hours for little pay to service the local chapters, and to help establish new ones.  Even during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] in October, little could be accomplished.  Most activity was oriented toward [[civil rights]] issues and the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC) played a key role in inspiring SDS.

By the end of the academic year, there were over 200 delegates at the annual convention at [[Pine Hill, New York]], from 32 different colleges and universities.  It was then decided to give more power to the chapters, who would then send delegates to the National Council (NC), which would meet quarterly to handle the ongoing activities.  Also, in the spirit of participatory democracy, a consensus was reached to elect new officers each year.  Lee Webb of [[Boston University]] was chosen as National Secretary, and [[Todd Gitlin]] of [[Harvard University]] was made president.  Some continuity was preserved by retaining Paul Booth as Vice President.  The search began for something to challenge the idealistic, budding activists.

It was at this time that the [[Black Power Movement]] was first gaining some momentum (although [[Stokely Carmichael]] would make the movement more mainstream in 1966). The movement made it impolitic for white activists, such as those in SDS, to presume to lead protests for black civil rights.  Instead, SDS would try to organize white unemployed youths through a newly established program they called the Economic Research and Action Project (ERAP).  This "into the ghetto" move was a practical failure, but the fact that it existed at all drew many young idealists to SDS.

At the summer convention in 1964 there was a split between those who were campus-oriented, and the ERAP supporters.  Most of the old guard were ERAP supporters, but the campus activists were growing.  Paul Potter was elected president, and by the end of summer there were ten ERAP programs in place, with about 125 student volunteers. [[C. Clark Kissinger]] of [[Shimer College]] in [[Illinois]] was elected as National Secretary, and he put the NO on a much more business-like basis.  He and his assistant, Helen Garvey, mailed out the literature list, the newsletters and the news of chapter's activities to a growing membership list.  Kissinger also worked to smooth the relationship with the LID.

A small faction of SDS that was interested in change through conventional electoral politics established a program called the Political Education Project (PEP). Its Director was Jim Williams of the University of Louisville, and Steve Max served as its Associate Director. This was never very large, and it was opposed by the mainstream SDSers, who were mostly opposed to such traditional, old-fashioned activity, and were looking for something new that "worked".  The landslide victory of [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] in the November presidential election played its part, as well, and PEP soon withered away. A Peace Research and Education Project (PREP) headed by Paul Booth, Swarthmore, met a similar fate.  Meanwhile, the local chapters got into all sorts of projects, from University reform, community-university relations, and now, in a small way, the issue of the [[Conscription|draft]] and [[Vietnam War]].  With the passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], the SDS broke with the pro-labor ideas in the Port Huron Statement and decided that it was best to shift the focus of civil rights away from the southern states and more towards urban cities in the north.&lt;ref name=uppava&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isreview.org/issues/31/sds.shtml|title=International Socialist Review|website=isreview.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then, on October 1, the [[University of California, Berkeley]] exploded into the dramatic and prolonged agony that was the [[free speech movement]]. Led by a charismatic Friends of SNCC student activist named [[Mario Savio]], upwards of three thousand students surrounded a police car in which a student was being taken away, arrested for setting up an informational card table for the [[Congress of Racial Equality]] (CORE) in defiance of the University's ban on politics.  The sit-down prevented the police car from moving for 32 hours.  The demonstrations, meetings and strikes that resulted all but shut the university down.  Hundreds of students were arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=kt896nb2rx;NAAN=13030&amp;doc.view=frames&amp;chunk.id=d0e217&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=d0e217&amp;brand=calisphere|title=[No title Available]|website=content.cdlib.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== From protest to resistance: 1965–1968 ==
In February 1965, United States President Johnson dramatically escalated the war in Vietnam by bombing North Vietnam in [[Operation Flaming Dart]] and introducing ground troops directly involved in fighting the [[Viet Cong]] in the South.  Campus chapters of SDS all over the country started to lead small, localized demonstrations against the war and the NO became the focal group that organized the march against the war in Washington on April 17.  Endorsements came from nearly all of the other peace groups and leading personalities, there was significant increase in income and by the end of March there were 52 chapters.  The media began to cover the organization and the [[New Left]]. However, the call for the march and the openness of the organization in allowing other groups, even [[communism|communist]] front groups, or communists themselves, to join in caused great strains with the LID and some other old left organizations.

The first [[teach-in]] against the war was held in the [[University of Michigan]]. Soon hundreds more, all over the country, were held. The demonstration in Washington, D.C. attracted about 25,000 anti-war protesters and SDS became the leading student group against the war on most U.S. campuses.

Representing its move into the heartland, the 1965 summer convention was held at Kewadin, a small camp in Northern Michigan. Moreover, its National Office, which had been located in Manhattan, was moved to Chicago at about the same time. The rapid growth of the membership rate during the preceding year brought with it a new breed with a new style:

{{quote|For the first time at an SDS meeting people smoked marijuana; [[Pancho Villa]] mustaches, those droopy Western-movie addenda that eventually became a New Left cliché, made their first appearance in quantity; blue workshirts, denim jackets, and boots were worn by both men and women. These were people generally raised outside of the East, many from the Midwest and Southwest, and their ruralistic dress reflected a different tradition, one more aligned to the frontier, more violent, more individualistic, more bare-knuckled and callus-handed, than that of the early SDSers. They were non-Jewish, nonintellectual, nonurban, from a nonprofessional class, and often without any family tradition of political involvement, much less radicalism. They tended to be not only ignorant of the history of the left and its current half-life in New York City, but downright uninterested: ...&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sds-1960s.org/books/sds.pdf Kirkpatrick Sale, ''SDS'', pp. 134; 204-205.

The convention elected an Akron, Ohio student, [[Carl Oglesby]], President and Jeff Shero, from the increasingly influential University of Texas chapter in Austin, as Vice President—in preference to "old guard" candidates.&lt;ref&gt;Page 85, ''Flying Close to the Sun'', Cathy Wilkerson, Seven Stories Press (2007), hardcover, 422 pages&lt;/ref&gt;  The convention voted to remove the [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] exclusion clauses from the SDS constitution,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sds-1960s.org/books/sds.pdf Kirkpatrick Sale, ''SDS'', p. 138.

As a result, the National Office's leadership fell into ineffectual chaos. The League for Industrial Democracy, SDS's nominal sponsoring organization, was disappointed with removal of the exclusion clause from the SDS constitution, as SDS was covered under LID's non-profit status which excluded political activity. By mutual agreement the relationship was severed October 4, 1965.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sds-1960s.org/books/sds.pdf Kirkpatrick Sale, ''SDS'', pp. 157.  Random House (1973), Hardcover, Vintage Books (January 1, 1974).] {{ISBN|0394478894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 27, 1965 there was a major anti-war demonstration in Washington, D.C. at which Carl Oglesby, the new SDS president, made a very successful speech, addressed to the liberal crowd,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sdsrebels.com/oglesby.htm |title=Rebels with a Cause |publisher=Sdsrebels.com |date=1965-11-27 |accessdate=2009-06-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516013742/http://www.sdsrebels.com/oglesby.htm |archivedate=2008-05-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in circuitous terms alleged that the United States government was [[American imperialism|imperialist]] in nature. The speech received a standing ovation, substantial press coverage, and resulted in greatly increased national prominence for SDS.&lt;ref name="sds-1960s" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Page 93-97, ''Ravens in the Storm'', [[Carl Oglesby]], Scribner (2008), hardcover, 336 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;

The unexpected influx of substantial numbers of new members and chapters combined with the ousting of the previous leadership, the "old guard", resulted in a crisis which dogged SDS until its final breakup; despite repeated attempts to do so, consensus was never reached on what form the organization should take or what role it should play. A final attempt by the old guard at a "rethinking conference" to establish a coherent new direction for the organization failed. The conference, held on the University of Illinois campus at Champaign-Urbana over Christmas vacation, 1965, was attended by about 360 people from 66 chapters, many of whom were new to SDS. Despite a great deal of discussion, no substantial decisions were made.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sds-1960s.org/books/sds.pdf Kirkpatrick Sale, ''SDS'', pp. 204-205 and pp. 163-164.  Random House (1973), Hardcover, Vintage Books (January 1, 1974).] {{ISBN|0394478894}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pages 103 and 104, ''Ravens in the Storm'', [[Carl Oglesby]], Scribner (2008), hardcover, 336 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nationally, the SDS continued to use the draft as an important issue for students, and over the rest of the academic year began to attack university complicity in it, as the universities had begun to supply students' class rankings, used to determine who was to be drafted. The University of Chicago's administration building was taken over in a three-day sit-in in May.  Rank protests and sit-ins spread to many other universities.

The summer convention of 1966 was moved even farther west, this time to [[Clear Lake, Iowa|Clear Lake]], [[Iowa]]. The "prairie people" continued to increase their influence.  Nick Egleson was chosen as President, and [[Carl Davidson]] was elected Vice President. [[Greg Calvert]], recently a History Instructor at Iowa State University, was chosen as National Secretary. It was at this convention that members of [[Progressive Labor Party (United States)|Progressive Labor Party]] (PL) first participated.  PL was a Maoist group that had turned to SDS as fertile ground for recruiting new members sympathetic to its long-term strategy of organizing the industrial working class.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sds-1960s.org/books/sds.pdf Kirkpatrick Sale, ''SDS'', p. 320.  Random House (1973), Hardcover, Vintage Books (January 1, 1974).] {{ISBN|0394478894}}&lt;/ref&gt; SDSers of that time were nearly all anti-communist, but they also refused to be drawn into actions that smacked of [[red-baiting]], which they viewed as mostly irrelevant and old hat. PL soon began to organize a [[Worker Student Alliance]]. By 1968 and 1969 they would profoundly affect SDS, particularly at national gatherings of the membership, forming a well-groomed, disciplined faction which followed the Progressive Labor Party line.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

The 1966 convention also marked an even greater turn towards organization around campus issues by local chapters, with the NO cast in a strictly supporting role. Campus issues ranged from bad food, powerless student "governments," various ''[[in loco parentis]]'' manifestations, on-campus recruiting for the military and, again, ranking for the draft.  Campuses around the country were in a state of unprecedented ferment and activism. Despite the absence of a politically effective campus SDS chapter, Berkeley again became a center of particularly dramatic radical upheaval over the university's repressive anti-free-speech actions, and an effective student strike with very wide support occurred. Even Harvard endured an upheaval engendered by a visit there of [[United States Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara]].

At this time many in SDS turned to a more anarchist-influenced politics and organized activities aimed at the country's burgeoning [[counterculture of the 1960s|countercultural]] community. These efforts were especially successful at the large and active University of Texas chapter in Austin where ''[[The Rag]]'', an underground newspaper founded by SDS leaders [[Thorne Dreyer]] and Carol Neiman was, according to historian Abe Peck, the first underground paper in the country to incorporate the "participatory democracy, community organizing and synthesis of politics and culture that the New Left of the midsixties was trying to develop." &lt;ref&gt;Peck, Abe, ''Uncovering the Sixties: The Life and Times of the Underground Press'', Pantheon Books, 1985; p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;  And SDS' now legendary "Gentle Thursday" events on the UT campus helped to galvanize the Austin cultural community and turn it into a potent political force.&lt;ref&gt;Tishcler, Barbara L., Editor, ''Sights on the Sixties'', Rutgers University Press, 1992; "Gentle Thursday:  An SDS Circus in Austin, Texas, 1966-1970," By Glenn W. Jones, pp. 75-85.&lt;/ref&gt; Austin's Gentle Thursday inspired similar activities at a number of other universities including Penn State and Iowa State.  Austin, also a center of civil-rights and anti-war activities, was in 1967 the scene of an SDS-generated free speech movement (the University Freedom Movement) that mobilized thousands of students in massive demonstrations and other activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.campusactivism.org/server-new/uploads/burrthesis.pdf “A History of Student Activism at the University of Texas at Austin,”] by Beverly Burr, Thesis, Spring 1988, University of Texas, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Winter and Spring of 1967 saw an escalation of the militancy of the protests at many campuses. SDSers and self-styled radicals were even elected into the student government at a few places.  Demonstrations against [[Dow Chemical Company]] and other campus recruiters were widespread, and ranking and the draft issues grew in scale. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) (mainly through its secret [[COINTELPRO]]) and other law enforcement agencies were often exposed as having spies and informers in the chapters.  Harassment by the authorities was also on the rise. The National Office became distinctly more effective in this period, and the three officers actually visited most of the chapters. ''New Left Notes'', as well, became a potent vehicle for promoting some coherence and solidarity among the chapters. The Anti-War movement began to take hold among university students.

The 1967 convention took an [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] turn by eliminating the Presidential and Vice-Presidential offices and replacing them with a National Secretary (20-year-old Mike Spiegel), an Education Secretary (Texan Bob Pardun of the Austin chapter), and an Inter‑organizational Secretary (former VP Carl Davidson). A clear direction for a national program was not set but they did manage to pass strong resolutions on the draft, resistance within the Army itself, and they made a call for immediate withdrawal from Vietnam.

It was also acknowledged that [[male chauvinism]] was rampant in the organization, and that women who attended the 1966 convention were pelted with tomatoes after requesting a plank for women's liberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wuv_AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA310&amp;lpg=PA310&amp;dq=sds+male+chauvanism+tomatoes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TW1dsIlioC&amp;sig=IqWh1PYfMXoPNIhYmbxwxx14KII&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjywISd44XZAhUISK0KHc6gDJwQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=sds+male+chauvanism+tomatoes&amp;f=false|title=The Democratic Imagination in America: Conversations with Our Past|first=Russell L.|last=Hanson|date=14 July 2014|publisher=Princeton University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1962 Port Huron Statement even glorified [[housewives]], stating they should work with doctors, professors and laborers in order to expand the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.iath.virginia.edu/sixties/HTML_docs/Resources/Primary/Manifestos/SDS_Port_Huron.html|title=Port Huron Statement|author=|date=|website=www2.iath.virginia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the 1967 convention [[women's liberation]] resolution on the issue of male chauvinism was passed by conference attendees, for the first time.

This resolution on [[women's liberation]], drafted in the Women's Liberation Workshop, had two goals. They were to "free women to participate in other meaningful activities" and to "relieve our brothers of the burden of male chauvinism." For the first goal, they had three specific subgoals. The first was the creation of communal childcare centers, so mothers at home could have free time to pursue their interests. The second was the acknowledgment of the right of women to choose when to have children. They said that free distribution of birth control information and competent medical abortion should be provided for all women. The third called for the even distribution of household chores between all adult members, male and female. For the second goal, to rid SDS of male chauvinism, they had four specific subgoals. The first was that the male SDS members should first work on their personal chauvinism first, and try and remove that from their work and social relationships. The second is for women to participate in all levels of SDS work, "from licking stamps to assuming leadership positions." The third is for leaders to be aware of the power they hold in creating the dynamic of the leader/subordinate relationship, and to be responsible for not abusing that power. The fourth mentions that all programs created by the SDS must include a section on women's right. The New Left Notes reprinted the statement, however, it was accompanied by a caricature of a woman dressed in a baby-doll dress, holding a sign with the slogan "We want our rights and we want them now!&lt;ref&gt;Schneir, Miriam. "An SDS Statement on the Liberation of Women." 1994. Feminism in Our Time: The Essential Writings, World War II to the Present. New York: Vintage, 1994. 103-07. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

That fall saw a great escalation of the anti-war actions of the New Left. The school year started with a large demonstration against university complicity in the war in allowing Dow recruiters on campus at the [[University of Wisconsin in Madison]] on October 17. Peaceful at first, the demonstrations turned to a sit-in that was violently dispersed by the Madison police and riot squad, resulting in many injuries and arrests. A mass rally and a student strike then closed the university for several days. A coordinated series of demonstrations against the draft led by members of the Resistance, the [[War Resisters League]], and SDS added fuel to the fire of resistance. After conventional civil rights tactics of peaceful pickets seemed to have failed, the Oakland, California Stop the Draft Week ended in mass hit and run skirmishes with the police. The huge (100,000 people) October 21 [[March on the Pentagon]] saw hundreds arrested and injured. Night-time raids on draft offices began to spread.

{{further|1969 Students for a Democratic Society National Convention}}
In the spring of 1968, National SDS activists led an effort on the campuses called "Ten Days of Resistance" and local chapters cooperated with the Student Mobilization Committee in rallies, marches, sit-ins and teach-ins, which culminated in a one-day strike on April 26.  About a million students stayed away from classes that day, the largest [[student strike]] in the history of the United States [[Student strike of 1970|until 1970]].  It was largely ignored by the New York City-based national media, which focused on the student shutdown of [[Columbia University]] in New York, led by an inter-racial alliance of Columbia SDS chapter activists and Student Afro Society activists.  As a result of the mass media publicity given to Columbia SDS activists such as Columbia SDS chairperson [[Mark Rudd]] during the [[Columbia University protests of 1968|Columbia Student Revolt]], the organization was put on the map politically and "SDS" became a [[wikt:household name|household name]] in the United States for a few years. Membership in SDS chapters around the United States increased dramatically during the 1968-69 academic year.

Led by the Worker-Student Alliance and rival Joe Hill caucuses, SDS in San Francisco played a major role in the Third World Student Strike at [[San Francisco State University|San Francisco State College]]. This strike, the longest student strike in U.S. history, led to the creation of Black and other ethnic studies programs on campuses across the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.sfsu.edu/about/collections/strike/essay.html Introductory Essay to The San Francisco State College Strike Collection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150224071740/http://www.library.sfsu.edu/about/collections/strike/essay.html |date=2015-02-24 }} - by Helene Whitson, San Francisco State University Library&lt;/ref&gt;

SDS members from Austin, Texas participated in a mass demonstration in [[San Antonio]], Texas in April 1969 at the "Kings River Parade". San Antonio SNCC members called the demonstration to protest the killing of Bobby Joe Phillips by San Antonio Police Officers.

In the summer of 1969, the [[1969 Students for a Democratic Society National Convention|ninth SDS national convention]] was held at the [[Chicago Coliseum]] with some 2000 people attending.  Many factions of the movement were present, and set up their literature tables all around the edges of the cavernous hall.  The [[Young Socialist Alliance]], [[Industrial Workers of the World|Wobblies]], [[International Communist League (Fourth Internationalist)|Spartacists]], [[Marxism|Marxists]] and [[Maoism|Maoists]] of various sorts, all together with various law-enforcement spies and informers contributed to the air of impending expectations.

Each delegate was given the convention issue of the newspaper ''New Left Notes'', which contained a manifesto, "You don't need a Weatherman to know which way the wind blows", a line taken from [[Bob Dylan]]'s "[[Subterranean Homesick Blues]]". This manifesto had been first presented at the Spring, 1969, SDS National Council Meeting in Austin, Texas. The document had been written by an 11-member committee that included Mark Rudd, [[Bernardine Dohrn]] and [[John Jacobs (student leader)|John Jacobs]], and represented the position of the [[Revolutionary Youth Movement]] (RYM) wing of SDS, most of which later turned into the [[Weatherman (organization)|Weather Underground Organization]]. It has been noted that the Weather Underground was an off-branch of SDS for a number of reasons. The ''New Left Notes'' issue was full of the language of the [[Old Left]] of the 1930s; and was thus impenetrable and irrelevant to the majority of SDSers.

According to Kirkpatrick Sale's account of the convention, the RYM and allied groups battled [[Progressive Labor Party (United States)|Progressive Labor]] (PL) members and the WSA faction of SDS for control of the organization throughout the convention. The [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] representatives attacked PL and at the same time proved itself inclined towards [[sexism]] by advocating "pussy power." The entire convention fell into something approaching chaos, or worse, farce.

The RYM and the National Office faction, led by Bernardine Dohrn, led 500 to 1000 people out of the Colosseum and, later that evening, holding a 1000-person meeting in another site near the National Office. There, the Weatherman faction carried the day, electing their slate of officers. The 500-600 people remaining in the meeting hall, dominated by PL, declared itself the "Real SDS", electing PL and WSA members as officers. By the next day, there were two SDS organizations, which RYM termed "SDS-RYM" and "SDS-WSA."&lt;ref&gt;Sale, Kirkpatrick (1973). ''SDS'' pp. 392-400&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall of 1969, many of the SDS-RYM chapters also split up or disintegrated.  The Weatherman faction evolved into a small underground organization that first took to street confrontations and then to a bombing campaign. The Weathermen held one final national convention in Flint, Michigan, from December 27–31, 1969. It was at this convention, more popularly known as the "[[Flint War Council]]," that the decision was made to disband what remained of SDS-RYM.&lt;ref&gt;Rudd, M. (2009). Underground: my life with sds and the weatherman. New York, NY: HarperCollins. pgs. 185-193.&lt;/ref&gt;  SDS-RYM was fully defunct by 1970, while SDS-WSA continued its activity.

Also in 1969, the New Left was present at a Counter-Inaugural to Richard Nixon's first inauguration, at which the antiwar leader [[Dave Dellinger]], serving as master of ceremonies, incorrectly announced, "The women have asked all the men to leave the stage."&lt;ref name="wordpress1"&gt;{{cite web|author=clarissakennedyjacob |url=http://womenandfilmproject.wordpress.com/2013/05/06/susan-faludi-on-shulamith-firestone-the-new-yorker/ |title=Susan Faludi on Shulamith Firestone, The New Yorker &amp;#124; The Women &amp; Film Project |publisher=Womenandfilmproject.wordpress.com |date=2013-05-06 |accessdate=2014-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that, SDS activist [[Marilyn Salzman Webb]] attempted to speak about women's oppression, and SDS men heckled her, shouting, "Take her off the stage and fuck her!" and so forth until she was drowned out.&lt;ref name="wordpress1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berger2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dan Berger |title=Outlaws of America: The Weather Underground and the Politics of Solidarity |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6KC36MHH3j8C&amp;pg=PT182 |year=2006 |publisher=AK Press |isbn=978-1-904859-41-3 |page=365}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rossinow1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Doug Rossinow |title=The Politics of Authenticity: Liberalism, Christianity, and the New Left in America |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iZwqKBgpfR8C&amp;pg=PA441 |date=January 1998 |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=978-0-231-11057-0 |page=441}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gessen |first=Keith |url=http://nplusonemag.com/on-shulamith-firestone-part-one |title=n+1: On Shulamith Firestone, Part One |publisher=Nplusonemag.com |date=2012-09-26 |accessdate=2014-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214101832/http://nplusonemag.com/on-shulamith-firestone-part-one |archivedate=2013-12-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later Webb received a threatening phone call which she thought was from [[Cathy Wilkerson]], but that was not confirmed, and it may have been from a government agent.&lt;ref name="Rossinow1998"/&gt; In any case, the call contributed to driving apart outspoken feminists in the national SDS and people who put anti-racist and anti-war work before feminism and went toward the Weathermen.&lt;ref name="Rossinow1998"/&gt;

== SDS-WSA: 1969 to 1974 ==
SDS-Worker-Student Alliance (SDS-WSA) continued to function nationwide, with a focus on (a) fighting racism; and (b) supporting workers' struggles and strikes, including the 1969 General Electric strike and 1970 Postal Workers' strikes. The WSA organized a support demonstration for the post office strikers, which greatly worried [[Richard Nixon]]'s administration. This is the entry from [[H.R. Haldeman]]'s diary:

{{quote|Saturday, March 21, 1970.

P in early, to EOB, to work on briefing books. Had to spend quite a little time on postal problem. The settlement didn't work, because rank and file won't go back, have rejected leaders, and now SDS types involved, at least in New York.&lt;ref&gt;''The Haldeman Diaries: Inside the Nixon White House'', by H.R. Haldeman, Berkley Books, New York, 1995, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Now calling itself simply SDS, SDS-WSA continued to publish the newspaper ''New Left Notes''. It held a convention in Boston in 1971, at which a striking [[General Motors]] worker was a featured speaker.

In 1972, SDS-WSA demonstrated at the [[Democratic National Convention]] in Miami against Democratic presidential candidate [[George McGovern]]'s retreating from his original stronger campaign positions against the [[Vietnam War]]. Several hundred SDS members staged a sit-in at the Doral Hotel as McGovern and his staff met upstairs with protesting members of Grassroots McGovern Volunteers and sympathizers angry over the same issues.

In Newark, New Jersey, SDS-WSA demonstrated against [[Anthony Imperiale]] and his North Ward Citizens' Council which was opposing the construction of Kawaida Towers, a building complex sponsored by a community organization led by Black nationalist and poet Amiri Baraka (formerly Leroy Jones) (''[[New York Times]]'' January 3, 1973, p.&amp;nbsp;84)

SDS joined with PLP and others to protest the writings of [[Arthur Jensen]], [[William Shockley]], and [[Richard Herrnstein]], all of whom promoted the notion that there might be a genetic component to the observed below-average performance of black people on IQ tests. In October 1973, SDS-WSA, PLP, and others organized a convention at the Loeb Student Center of New York University dedicated to opposing academic racism. SDS circulated a petition entitled "A Resolution Against Racism" that was published in the ''New York Times'' on October 28, 1973 (p.&amp;nbsp;211). Out of this convention the Committee Against Racism (CAR) was formed to continue the fight against racism. CAR later changed its name to International Committee Against Racism (InCAR), when some chapters were formed in Canada.

In 1974, National SDS(-WSA) voted to dissolve as a separate organization and reform as chapters of InCAR. However, individual chapters of SDS continued to exist for some time. A chapter at [[Purdue University]] was active as late as 1976.

All references to contemporary activities of SDS in sources such as the ''New York Times'' after early 1970 are to SDS-WSA. For example, SDS confronted Indiana Senator [[Vance Hartke]] at an antiwar rally in New York City in 1971 (''New York Times'' July 3, 1971, p.&amp;nbsp;3 and July 4, 1971, p.&amp;nbsp;3). SDS denounced liberal Democrats as having been the authors of the Vietnam War in the first place. SDS demonstrated against the [[Republican National Convention]] in [[Miami Beach, Florida]] in August 1972 (''New York Times'' August 21, 1972, p.&amp;nbsp;20; August 22, 1972, pp.&amp;nbsp;1,36; August 23, 1972, pp.&amp;nbsp;1, 28).

Unlike SDS-RYM and the Weathermen, SDS-WSA strongly opposed bombing and [[terrorism]]. In 1971, SDS-WSA published a pamphlet titled ''Who Are The Bombers?''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plp.org/pamphlets/who_are_the_bombers.pdf|title=Who Are The Bombers?|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022221250/http://www.plp.org/pamphlets/who_are_the_bombers.pdf|archivedate=2008-10-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It warned readers against police agents sent into the anti-Vietnam War movement to foment violence to justify police attacks. It also sharply criticized the ''Weathermen'', which had begun its campaign of bombings.

On June 26, 1972, the [[US Supreme Court]] gave a unanimous opinion, in the case [[Healy v. James]], stating that members of the SDS had been unconstitutionally deprived of their [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] right to freedom of assembly when a group was denied permission to form on the campus of [[Central Connecticut State College]] in New Britain, Connecticut.&lt;ref name="408 US 169"&gt;''Healy v. James'' {{Ussc|408|169|1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few early SDS leaders went on to careers as [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] politicians, including [[Tom Hayden]], a former member of the legislature of the state of California and well known as the former husband of actress [[Jane Fonda]], a prolific author, and a former candidate for offices such as [[Governor of California]], [[Mayor of Los Angeles]], and US Senator.

== The New SDS: 2006 and later ==

{{main|Students for a Democratic Society (2006 organization)}}
A new incarnation of SDS was founded on January 16, 2006, [[Martin Luther King Jr. Day]], and by 2010 had grown to over 150 chapters around the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studentsforademocraticsociety.org/?q=history|title=Students for a Democratic Society - History|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has held five national conventions to date, including the fifth in 2010 in [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]].&lt;ref name=5th-national-convention&gt;{{cite news |last=Gold|first=Mike|title=SDS Holds 5th National Convention, Lays Plans to Build Student Movement|url=http://www.fightbacknews.org/2010/10/24/sds-holds-5th-national-convention-lays-plans-build-student-movement|accessdate=30 September 2011|newspaper=FightBack!News|date=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Turkmens''' ({{lang-tk|Türkmenler}}, Түркменлер, IPA: {{IPA-tk|tyɾkmenˈleɾ|}}; historically also '''the Turkmen''') are a nation and [[Turkic peoples|Turkic ethnic group]] native to [[Central Asia]], primarily the Turkmen [[nation state]] of [[Turkmenistan]]. Smaller communities are also found in [[Iran]], [[Afghanistan]], [[North Caucasus]] ([[Stavropol Krai]]), and northern [[Pakistan]]. They speak the [[Turkmen language]], which is classified as a part of the [[Oghuz languages|Eastern Oghuz]] branch of the [[Turkic languages]]. Examples of other [[Oghuz languages]] are [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Qashqai language|Qashqai]], [[Gagauz language|Gagauz]], [[Khorasani Turkic language|Khorasani]], and [[Salar language|Salar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/|title=UCLA Language Materials Project: Main|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Originally, all Turkic tribes that were part of the Turkic dynastic mythological system (for example, [[Uigurs]], [[Karluks]], and a number of other tribes) were designated ''"Turkmens"''. Only later did this word come to refer to a specific ethnonym. The term derives from ''Türk'' plus the [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]] affix of similarity  ''-myn'', ''-men'', and means "resembling a Türk" or "co-Türk".&lt;ref&gt;[[Yury Zuev|Yu. Zuev]], ''"Early Türks: Essays on history and ideology"'', Almaty, Daik-Press, 2002, p. 157, {{Listed Invalid ISBN|9985-4-4152-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A prominent Turkic scholar, [[Mahmud Kashgari]], also mentions the etymology ''Türk manand'' (like Turks). The language and ethnicity of the Turkmen were much influenced by their migration to the west. Kashgari calls the Karluks Turkmen as well, but the first time the etymology Turkmen was used was by [[Makdisi]] in the second half of the 10th century AD. Like Kashgari, he wrote that the Karluks and [[Oghuz Turk]]s were called Turkmen. Some modern scholars have proposed that the element ''-man/-men'' acts as an intensifier, and have translated the word as "pure Turk" or "most Turk-like of the Turks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/frd/cs/tmtoc.html|title=Turkmenistan : Country Studies – Federal Research Division, Library of Congress|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among Muslim chroniclers such as [[Ibn Kathir]], the etymology was attributed to the mass conversion of two hundred thousand households in 971 AD, causing them to be named ''Turk Iman'', which is a combination of "Turk" and "Iman" إيمان (faith, belief), meaning "believing Turks", with the term later dropping the hard-to-pronounce ''[[hamza]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ar.wikisource.org/wiki/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%8A%D8%A9_%D9%88_%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%87%D8%A7%D9%8A%D8%A9_-_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D8%B2%D8%A1_11|title=البداية والنهاية/الجزء الحادي عشر|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, all of the Western or Oghuz Turks have been called ''Türkmen'' or ''Turkoman'';&lt;ref name="locorigins"&gt;
Glenn E. Curtis, ed. "Origins and Early History", Turkmenistan: A Country Study. Washington: GPO for the Library of Congress, 1996. pg. 13&lt;/ref&gt; however, today the terms are usually restricted to two Turkic groups: the Turkmen people of [[Turkmenistan]] and adjacent parts of [[Central Asia]], and the [[Turkomans of Iraq]] and [[Syrian Turkmen|Syria]].

The modern Turkmen people descend, at least in part, from the Oghuz Turks of [[Transoxiana]], the western portion of [[Turkestan]], a region that largely corresponds to much of Central Asia as far east as [[Xinjiang]]. Oghuz tribes had moved westward from the [[Altay mountains]] in the 7th century AD, through the [[Siberian]] steppes, and settled in this region. They also penetrated as far west as the [[Volga]] basin and the [[Balkans]]. These early Turkmens are believed to have mixed with native [[Sogdia|Sogdian]] peoples and lived as pastoral nomads until the Russian invasion of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Amazon.com: Central Asians under Russian Rule: A Study in Culture Change (Cornell Paperbacks): Elizabeth E.

Signs of advanced settlements have been found throughout Turkmenistan including the ''[[Djeitun]]'' settlement where [[neolithic]] buildings have been excavated and dated to the 7th millennium BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antiquity.ac.uk/Ant/047/0043/Ant0470043.pdf|title=Cambridge Journals Online – Antiquity|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2000 BCE, various [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European peoples]] began to settle throughout the region, as indicated by the finds at the [[Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex]]. Notable early tribes included the nomadic [[Dahae]] (a.k.a. Daoi/Dasa), [[Massagetae]] and [[Scythians]]. The [[Achaemenid]] Empire annexed the area by the 4th century BCE and then lost control of the region following the invasion of [[Alexander the Great]], whose Hellenistic influence had an impact upon the area and some remnants have survived in the form of a planned city which was discovered following excavations at Antiocheia ([[Merv]]). The [[Parni]], a Dahae tribe came to dominate the region, and established the [[Parthian Empire]], which also later fractured as a result of invasions from the north.

[[Ephthalites]], [[Huns]], and [[Göktürks]] came in a long parade of invasions. Finally, the [[Sassanid]] Empire based in [[Persia]] ruled the area prior to the coming of the [[Muslim]] [[Arab]]s during the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] by 716 CE. The majority of the inhabitants were converted to [[Islam]] as the region grew in prominence. Next came the [[Oghuz Turks]], who imparted their language upon the local population. A tribe of the Oghuz, the [[Seljuks]], established a [[Turko-Iranian (disambiguation)|Turko-Iranian]] culture that culminated in the [[Khwarezmid Empire]] by the 12th century. [[Mongol]] hordes led by [[Genghis Khan]] conquered the area between 1219 and 1221 and devastated many of the cities which led to a rapid decline of the remaining Iranian urban population.

The Turkmen largely survived the Mongol period due to their semi-nomadic lifestyle and became traders along the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]], which led to contacts with [[Eastern Europe]]. Following the decline of the Mongols, [[Tamerlane]] conquered the area and his [[Timurid Empire]] would rule, until it too fractured, as the [[Safavids]], [[Khanate of Bukhara]], and [[Khanate of Khiva]] all contested the area. The expanding [[Russian Empire]] took notice of [[Economy of Turkmenistan|Turkmenistan's extensive cotton industry]], during the reign of [[Peter the Great]], and invaded the area. Following the decisive [[Battle of Geok Tepe]] in January 1881, Turkmenistan became a part of the Russian Empire. After the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] control was established by 1921 as Turkmenistan was transformed from a medieval Islamic region to a largely secularized republic within a [[totalitarian]] state. By 1991, with the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985-1991)|fall of the Soviet Union]], Turkmenistan achieved independence as well, but remained dominated by a one-party system of government led by the [[authoritarian]] regime of President [[Saparmurat Niyazov]] until his death in December 2006.

==Language==
{{Main|Turkmen language}}
Turkmen (Latin: Türkmençe, Cyrillic: Түркменче) is the language of the titular nation of  [[Turkmenistan]]. It is spoken by over 5,200,000 people in [[Turkmenistan]], and by roughly 3,000,000 people in other countries, including [[Iran]], [[Afghanistan]], and Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=tuk|title=Turkmen|work=Ethnologue|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up to 30% of native speakers in Turkmenistan also claim a good knowledge of [[Russian language|Russian]], a legacy of the [[Russian Empire]] and [[Soviet Union]].

Turkmen is not a literary language in Iran and Afghanistan, where many Turkmen tend towards bilingualism, usually conversant in the countries' different dialects of [[Persian language|Persian]], such as [[Dari language|Dari]] in Afghanistan. Variations of the [[Persian alphabet]] are, however, used in Iran.

[[File:17. Милиционеры-текинцы.jpg|thumb|Turkmens in 1890]]
[[File:19. Базар в Мерве.jpg|thumb|Turkmens in [[Merv]], 1890]]
Genetic studies on [[mitochondrial DNA]] ([[mtDNA]]) restriction polymorphism confirmed that  Turkmen were characterized by the presence of local Iranian mtDNA lineages, similar to the [[Eastern Iranian]] populations, but high male [[Mongoloid]] genetic component observed in Turkmens populations with the frequencies of about 20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/maik/ruge/2002/00000038/00000004/00375256;jsessionid=1i2j4imsmaj3n.alice|title=1 Russian Journal of Genetics, Mitochondrial DNA Polymorphism in Populations of the Caspian Region and Southeastern Europe|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606150805/http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/maik/ruge/2002/00000038/00000004/00375256;jsessionid=1i2j4imsmaj3n.alice|archivedate=2011-06-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This most likely indicates an ancestral combination of [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] and [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] groups that the modern Turkmen have inherited and which appears to correspond to the historical record which indicates that various Iranian tribes existed in the region prior to the migration of Turkic tribes:

{{Quote|The Turkomans observe a difference between their children from Turkoman mothers, and those from the Persian female captives whom they take as wives, and the Kazakh women whom they purchase from the Uzbeks of Khiva. The Turkomans of pure race enjoy full privileges, while the others are not allowed to contract marriages with Turkoman women of pure blood, but must choose themselves wives among the half-castes and Kazakh captives.

As there exists a great animosity between the Yamuds and Goklans they do not intermarry, although they reckon themselves of equally noble lineage. The same hatred is extended to the Tekke Turkomans, whom the Goklans and Yamuds, moreover, look upon as their inferiors, being, according to their genealogies, the descendants of a slave-woman, whilst they are the posterity of a free-woman. (p. 71)

The more intimate connection of the Astrakhan and Kazan Tartars with the Mogols can be traced in their features; with the Nogay it is less visible. In like manner, the Turkomans further off in the desert, and the Uzbeks of Khive, have more of the Mogol expression than the Turkomans who encamp near the Persian frontier. The frequent intercourse of the Nogay, in latter years, with the Cherkess, seems to have improved their race; and notwithstanding the enmity that exists between the Turkomans and the Persians, it is still not unlikely that their close vicinity should have produced on the former a similar effect in a lapse of several centuries. The fact we have seen, that the Turkomans marry Persian women, when they take them as prisoners. The Turkoman women are, like the men, tall, and when young, well-shaped; their faces are rounder than those of the men; the cheek-bones less prominent; the eyes black, with fine eye-brows, and many with fair complexion; the nose is rather flat; the mouth small, with a row of regular white teeth. In a word, a great number of the younger part of the community might be reckoned as fair specimens of pretty women. (p. 73)}}

Before the establishment of Soviet power in [[Central Asia]], it was difficult to identify distinct ethnic groups in the region. Sub-ethnic and supra-ethnic loyalties were more important to people than ethnicity. When asked to identify themselves, most Central Asians would name their kin group, neighborhood, village, religion or the state in which they lived; the idea that a state should exist to serve an ethnic group was unknown.&lt;ref name="Adrienne Lynn Edgar 2007 18"&gt;{{cite book|author= Adrienne Lynn Edgar|title=Tribal Nation: The Making of Soviet Turkmenistan|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=9Q11AQAAQBAJ |year=2007|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=18|isbn=9781400844296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Turkmen were nomads and were not settled in cities and towns until the advent of the Soviet government. This mobile lifestyle precluded identification with anyone outside one's kin group and led to frequent conflicts between different [[Turkmen tribes]]. In collaboration with the local nationalists, the Soviet government sought to transform the Turkmen and other “backward” ethnic groups in the USSR into modern socialist nations that based their identity on a fixed territory and a common language.

The Soviet-led standardization of the Turkmen language, education, and projects to promote ethnic Turkmen in the industry, government and higher education had led growing numbers of Turkmen to identify with a larger national Turkmen culture rather than with sub-national, pre-modern forms of identity.&lt;ref name="Adrienne Lynn Edgar 2007 261"&gt;{{cite book|author= Adrienne Lynn Edgar|title=Tribal Nation: The Making of Soviet Turkmenistan|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=9Q11AQAAQBAJ |year=2007|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=261|isbn=9781400844296}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the Soviet era, a proverb stated that the Turkmen’s home was where his horse happened to stand. After gaining independence from the Soviet Union, Turkmen historians went to great lengths to prove that the Turkmen had inhabited their current territory since time immemorial; some historians even tried to deny the nomadic heritage of the Turkmen.&lt;ref name="Adrienne Lynn Edgar 2007 264"&gt;{{cite book|author= Adrienne Lynn Edgar|title=Tribal Nation: The Making of Soviet Turkmenistan|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=9Q11AQAAQBAJ |year=2007|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=264|isbn=9781400844296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tolkuchka Bazaar - Flickr - Kerri-Jo (32).jpg|thumb|Tolkuchka Bazaar in Turkmenistan]]
Turkmen lifestyle was heavily invested in horsemanship and as a prominent horse culture, Turkmen horse-breeding was an ages old tradition. In spite of changes prompted by the Soviet period, a tribe in southern Turkmenistan has remained very well known for their horses, the [[Akhal-Teke]] ''desert horse'' – and the horse breeding tradition has returned to its previous prominence in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.turkmenistanembassy.org/turkmen/history/horses.html|title=Turkmenistan Embassy Washington|website=www.turkmenistanembassy.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64zwCYLl4?url=http://www.turkmenistanembassy.org/turkmen/history/horses.html|archivedate=2012-01-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many tribal customs still survive among modern Turkmen. Unique to Turkmen culture is ''kalim'' which is a [[Bridegroom|groom]]'s "[[dowry]]", that can be quite expensive and often results in the widely practiced{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} tradition of [[bride kidnapping|bridal kidnapping]].&lt;ref name="Turkmen Society"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iatp.edu.tm/baskurt/SocStructure.html|title=Turkmen Society|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070318221209/http://www.iatp.edu.tm/baskurt/SocStructure.html|archivedate=2007-03-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In something of a modern parallel, in 2001, President Saparmurat Niyazov had introduced a state enforced "''kalim''", which required all foreigners who wanted to marry a Turkmen woman to pay a sum of no less than $50,000.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"&gt;Philip Sherwell, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/turkmenistan/1334919/Price-of-loving-a-Turkmen-girl-is-now-50000.html Price of loving a Turkmen girl is now $50,000], ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', July 22, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The law was abolished in March 2005.&lt;ref name="rferl.org"&gt;Gulnoza Saidazimova, [http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1059210.html Turkmenistan: Marriage Gets Cheaper As Turkmenbashi Drops $50,000 Dollar Foreigners' Fee], ''[[Radio Free Europe]]'', June 10, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Other customs include the consultation of tribal elders, whose advice is often eagerly sought and respected. Many Turkmen still live in extended families where various generations can be found under the same roof, especially in rural areas.&lt;ref name="Turkmen Society"/&gt;

The music of the nomadic and rural Turkmen people reflects rich oral traditions, where epics such as [[Koroglu]] are usually sung by itinerant bards. These itinerant singers are called ''[[bakshy]]'' and sing either a cappella or with instruments such as the two-stringed [[lute]] called [[dutar]].

Since Turkmenistan's independence in 1991, a cultural revival has taken place with the return of a moderate form of [[Islam]] and celebration of [[Novruz]] (an [[Iran]]ian&lt;ref name="Meri"&gt;Josef W. Meri, Jere L. Bacharach, "Medieval Islamic Civilization: L-Z, index ", Taylor &amp; Francis, 2006.  pp 605: "Buyid rulers such as Azud al-Dawla resusciated a number of pre-islamic Iranian practices, most notably the titular of shahanshah (king of kings) and the celebration of the Persian New Year&lt;/ref&gt; tradition) or New Year's Day.

Turkmen can be divided into various social classes including the urban intelligentsia and workers whose role in society is different from that of the rural peasantry. Secularism and [[atheism]] remain prominent for many Turkmen intellectuals who favor moderate social changes and often view extreme religiosity and cultural revival with some measure of distrust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+tm0026)|title=US Library of Congress Country Studies-Turkmenistan: Social Structure|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-proclaimed ''President for Life'' [[Saparmurat Niyazov]] was largely responsible for many of the changes that have taken place in modern Turkmen society. Niyazov made nationalism an important element in Turkmenistan, while contacts with Turkmen in neighboring Iran and Afghanistan have increased. Significant changes to the names of the cities as well as calendar reform were introduced by President Niyazov as well. The [[Renaming of Turkmen months and days of week, 2002|calendar reform]] resulted in renaming months and days of the week from [[Persian language|Persian]] or [[Europe]]an-derived words into purely Turkmen ones, some of them eponymously related to the president or his [[family]]. The policy was reversed in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7365346.stm|title=BBC NEWS – Asia-Pacific – Turkmen go back to old calendar|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The five traditional carpet designs that form motifs in the country's [[Coat of arms of Turkmenistan|state emblem]] and [[Flag of Turkmenistan|flag]] represent the five major [[Turkmen tribes]].

===Turkmen in Iran===
{{See also|Iranian Turkmen}}
Turkmen rulers, successively of the [[Black Sheep Turkomans]] and [[White Sheep Turkomans]], ruled much of Persia and surrounding countries before [[Shah Ismail I]] defeated them to begin the [[Safavid]] dynasty in 1501.  [[Tabriz]] was their usual capital.  There remains a relatively small population identifying as Turkmen in modern [[Iran]].

===Turkmen in Afghanistan===
[[File:Afghanistan ethnic groups 2005.jpg|thumb|left|200px|CIA map showing the territory of the settlement of [[ethnic groups in Afghanistan|ethnic groups and subgroups in Afghanistan]] (2005)]]
Turkmen are another Sunni Turkic-speaking group whose language has close affinities with modern Turkish. The Afghan Turkmen population in the 1990s was estimated at around 200,000. Turkmen also reside north of the Amu Darya in Turkmenistan.&lt;ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+af0041)|title=US Library of Congress Country Studies-Afghanistan: Turkmen|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original Turkmen groups came from east of the Caspian Sea into northwestern Afghanistan at various periods, particularly after the end of the nineteenth century when the Russians moved into their territory. They established settlements from Balkh Province to Herat Province, where they are now concentrated; smaller groups settled in Kunduz Province. Others came in considerable numbers as a result of the failure of the Basmachi revolts against the Bolsheviks in the 1920s.&lt;ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov"/&gt; Turkmen tribes, of which there are twelve major groups in Afghanistan, base their structure on genealogies traced through the male line. Senior members wield considerable authority. Formerly a nomadic and warlike people feared for their lightning raids on caravans, Turkmen in Afghanistan are farmer-herdsmen and important contributors to the economy. They brought karakul sheep to Afghanistan and are also renowned makers of carpets, which, with karakul pelts, are major hard currency export commodities. [[Turkmen jewelry]] is also highly prized.&lt;ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov"/&gt;

===Turkmen of Stavropol Region of Russia===

In the [[Stavropol Krai|Stavropol Region]] of southern [[Russian Federation|Russia]], there is a long established colony of Turkmen. They are often referred to as '''Trukhmen''' by the local ethnic [[Russian people|Russian]] population, and sometimes use the self-designation '''Turkpen'''.&lt;ref name="eki.ee"&gt;[http://www.eki.ee/books/redbook/trukhmens.shtml The Red Book of the Peoples of the Russian Empire]. Eki.ee. Retrieved on 2013-07-12.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Russian Census (2010)|2010 Census of Russia]], they numbered 15,048, and accounted for 0.5% of the total population of Stavropol Region.

The Turkmens are said to have migrated into the [[Caucasus]] in the 17th century, in particular in the [[Mangyshlak]] region. These migrants belonged mainly to the Chaudorov (Chavodur), Sonchadj and Ikdir tribes. The early settlers were nomadic but over time a process of sedentarization took place. In their cultural life the Trukhmens of today differ very little from their neighbours and are now settled farmers and stockbreeders.&lt;ref name="eki.ee"/&gt;

Although the Turkmen language belongs to the Oghuz group of Turkic languages, in Stavropol  it has been strongly influenced by the [[Nogai language]], which belongs to the [[Kipchak language|Kipchak]] group. The phonetic system, grammatical structure and to some extent also the vocabulary, have been somewhat influenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.lingfil.uu.se/afro/turkiskasprak/IP2007/Johanson2006Cauc.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610043333/http://www.lingfil.uu.se/afro/turkiskasprak/IP2007/Johanson2006Cauc.pdf |archivedate=2007-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Turkmen people of Central Asia live in:
*'''[[Turkmenistan]]''', where some 85% of the population of 5,042,920 people (July 2006 est.), are ethnic Turkmen. In addition, an estimated 1,200 Turkmen [[Afghan refugees|refugees]] from northern Afghanistan currently reside in Turkmenistan due to the ravages of the [[Soviet–Afghan War]] and factional fighting in Afghanistan which saw the rise and fall of the [[Taliban]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newscentralasia.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=952|title=UNHCR Begins Compiling Database of Refugees in Turkmenistan|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051208094450/http://www.newscentralasia.com/modules.php?name=News|archivedate=2005-12-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Afghanistan]]''', where as of 2006, 200,000 are ethnic Turkmen and are largely concentrated primarily along the Turkmen-Afghan border in the provinces of [[Faryab Province|Faryab]], [[Jowzjan Province|Jowzjan]], Samangan and [[Baghlan Province|Baghlan]]. There are also other communities in [[Balkh Province|Balkh]] and [[Kunduz Province]]s.
*'''[[Iran]]''', where about 1,328,585 Turkmen are primarily concentrated in the [[Provinces of Iran|provinces]] of [[Golestān Province|Golestān]] and [[North Khorasan Province|North Khorasan]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
{{Main|Turkmen in Pakistan}}
*'''[[Pakistan]]''', During the Soviet–Afghan war, Some Turkmen fled the country and settled in neighboring Pakistan. Today a small population of Turkmen reside in Pakistan mainly in Peshawar city. Their number in Pakistan is estimated to be less than 5,000. They are mainly involved in Carpet Business in Peshawar city.
*'''[[Turkey]]''', where most Turkmens have integrated into sedentary life over the centuries through [[Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] periods. A considerable nomadic Turkmen group called [[Yörük]] still maintain their lifestyle in [[Anatolia]] and parts of the [[Balkans]].

==Y-DNA haplogroups of Turkmens==
Recent studies on the Turkmens of Iran and Afghanistan suggest that haplogroup Q is the dominant Y-DNA in Turkmens. So far, there have been two detailed studies on the Y-DNA of Turkmens.
* One piece of research (Cristofaro et al.,2013) found that the Turkmens in Afghanistan have 31.1% [[Haplogroup Q-M25|Q-M25]] (Q1a2, in the 2017 [[ISOGG]] phylogeny) and 2.7% Q-M346 (Q total 25/74=33.8%), followed by R1a1a/R-M198 at 16.2%, also R1b 2.74%, R2 1.4%), J1c3 (J-Page8; 8.1%, also other various J-subclades at 9.5%), N1b/N-P43 (6.8%), G2a/G-P303 (4.1%), L1a/L-M76 (4.1%), and various subgroups of E1b1b 5.4%, O3 (KL2, M134) 2.7%, C(M401) 1.4%, H(M69*) 1.4%.&lt;ref name="Cristofaro2013"&gt;J D Cristofaro et al., 2013, "Afghan Hindu Kush: Where Eurasian Sub-Continent Gene Flows Converge", http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0076748&lt;/ref&gt;
* Another study (Grugni et al.,2012) found that 42.6% (29/68) of Iranian Turkmens (in Golestan) have haplogroup Q-M25, followed by R1a1a/R-M198 (14.5%, also R1b 4.3%, R2 1.4%), J1c3/J-Page8 (5.8%, also other various J-subclades at 8.8%), G2a (5.8%), L3/L-M357 (5.8%), E1b1b (4.3%), NO (2.9%, xN, xO), H (1.4%), T (1.4%).&lt;ref&gt;Viola Grugni et al.,2012, "Ancient Migratory Events in the Middle East: New Clues from the Y-Chromosome Variation of Modern Iranians", http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0041252. It seems that more correctly rounded frequency-figures might be 14.7%(instead of 14.5%), 5.9%(instead of 5.8%), 4.4%(instead of 4.3%), 1.5%(instead of 1.4%).&lt;/ref&gt;
The above studies suggest that there is a strong possibility that the precursors of the Turkmen, such as the [[Oghuz Turks|Oghuz]], belonged to Q-M25 .

This is supported by circumstantial evidence that the elites of many pre-modern dynasties from [[Inner Asia]] belonged to Haplogroup Q, including Q-M25.
* In 2015, three sets of male remains from c. 1300 CE were recovered from a royal tomb at Shuzhuanglou, northern [[Hebei]] [[China]]. The principal occupant was known to be Korguz, King (''Gaodang'') 高唐王=趙王 阔里吉思 of the Mongol [[Ongud]] (汪古部) tribe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Qui | first1 = Y | display-authors=etal | year = 2015 | title = Identification of kinship and occupant status in Mongolian noble burials of the Yuan Dynasty through a multidisciplinary approach | url = | journal = Phil.

All three males  were found to belong to haplogroup Q (subclade unknown). Korguz's mtDNA fell into [[Haplogroup D (mtDNA)|haplogroup D4m2]] and the others into [[haplogroup A (mtDNA)|haplogroup A]].&lt;ref&gt;Korguz, who died in 1298 and was reburied at Shuzhuanglou in 1311, was a maternal grandson of [[Kublai Khan]] (元世祖), should not be confused with Korguz, King of the Uyghurs, d. 1242). Korguz, King of the Ongud was prominent in the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]] of China and founded three dynasties. Both of Korguz's consorts were princesses of the Yuan Dynasty and granddaughters of Kublai Khan. It was important for the Yuan Dynasty to maintain marriage alliances with the Ongud which had been a very important ally the time of since Genghis Khan. About 16 princesses of the Yuan Dynasty were married to kings of the Ongud tribe.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Males of the Ashina clan (阿史那) that ruled the Gokturks and [[Khazaria]] may also have belonged to haplogroup Q-M346 (Q1b).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.familytreedna.com/groups/ashina-royal-dynasty/about|title=Family Tree DNA - Genetic Testing for Ancestry, Family History &amp; Genealogy|website=www.familytreedna.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The elite of the [[Xiongnu]], who were also dominated by haplogroup Q, are also widely believed to have been a Turkic people. For example, in the ancient cemetery in Heigouliang (Xinjiang), which was known as the summer palace of the Xiongnu king, the remains of all 12 males found belonged to haplogroup Q, including four who belonged to Q-M346 (Q1b) and appeared to have been the hosts of the tombs concerned.&lt;ref&gt;Y-Chromosome Genetic Diversity of the Ancient North Chinese populations, Li Hongjie, Jilin University-China, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Xiongnu nobles/conquerors found in another ancient site belonged to Q-M3.&lt;ref&gt;Y chromosomes of ancient Hunnu people and its implication on the phylogeny of East Asian linguistic families.

The '''Vésuviennes''' were a radical [[feminist]] group that existed in [[France]] in the middle of the 19th century. They chose their name (derived from [[Mount Vesuvius]]) because, in their words, "Like [[lava]], so long held back, that must at last pour out around us, [our idea of feminist equality] is in no way incendiary but in all ways regenerating."

With the overthrow of King [[Louis-Philippe of France]] in 1848, the newly formed Republic lifted all restrictions on the press and assembly. This encouraged a proliferation of new feminist publications, organizations, and groups. The Vésuviennes were among the latter. Considered to be the most radical of all of the feminist factions of the time, the Vésuviennes promoted female military service, the right of women to dress the same as men, and legal and domestic equality between husband and wife, even as that extended to the distribution of household chores. Most Vésuviennes were between the ages of 15 and 30, unmarried, poorly paid workers. Even some other feminists disapproved of their tactics, which included wearing [[culottes]] (not unlike the [[Bloomers (clothing)|bloomers]] worn by radical American feminists at the time) and staging frequent street demonstrations.

The image of a young woman in culottes came to represent all feminists to some, as can be seen in the caricatures of {{Interlanguage link multi|Charles-Édouard de Beaumont|fr}}, one of several artists who satirized the efforts of feminists of the period in popular political papers such as [[Le Charivari]].

Until recently the existence of this feminist organization was regarded as genuine, if poorly documented. Some historians have recently argued that the organisation was itself "a burlesque creation of the French police who drew up a constitution for it and provided it with prostitutes as members".&lt;ref name="McMillan2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=James McMillan|title=France and Women, 1789-1914: Gender, Society and Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jijIhhg3DakC&amp;pg=PA93|accessdate=16 September 2012|year=2000|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis US|isbn=978-0-415-22603-5|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The 10,000 Hookworm Family.jpg|thumb|425px|This poor white family from Alabama was presented in 1913 as "celebrities" because they had escaped the debilitating effects of [[hookworm disease]], which, along with [[pellagra]] was endemic among Southern "white trash" due to poor sanitation and the phenomenon of "clay eating" ([[geophagia]]).]]

'''White trash''' is a derogatory [[American English]] predominantly class slur referring to [[Poor White|poor white people]], especially in the rural [[southern United States]]. The label signifies [[Social class|lower social class]] inside the white population and especially a degraded standard of living.&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2018/08/01/605084163/why-its-still-ok-to-trash-poor-white-people|title=Why Is It Still OK To 'Trash' Poor White People?|work=[[NPR]]|department=Code Switch|first=Leah |last=Donnella|date= August 1, 2018|access-date=3 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has been adopted for people living on the fringes of the social order, who are seen as dangerous because they may be criminal, unpredictable, and without respect for political, legal, or moral authority.&lt;ref&gt;Wray (2006), p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The term is usually a racial slur,&lt;ref&gt;Hartigan, John, Jr. (2003) "Who are these white people?: 'Rednecks,' 'Hillbillies,' and 'White Trash' as marked racial subjects" in {{cite book|author=Doane, Ashley W. and Bonilla-Silva, Eduardo eds. |title=White Out: The Continuing Significance of Racism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IrwSxxoM0MMC&amp;pg=PA95|year=2003|publisher=Psychology Press|pages=95–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; but may also be used self-referentially by working class whites to jokingly describe their origins or lifestyle.&lt;ref name="whitetrashmom"&gt;{{cite book|title=The White Trash Mom Handbook: Embrace Your Inner Trailerpark, Forget Perfection, Resist Assimilation into the PTA, Stay Sane, and Keep Your Sense of Humor|author1=Lamar, Michelle|author2=Wendland, Molly|lastauthoramp=yes |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cooking"&gt;{{cite book|title=White Trash Cooking|author=Mickler, Ernest|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gathering"&gt;{{cite book|title=White Trash Gatherings: From-Scratch Cooking for down-Home Entertaining|author=Morris, Kendra|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Etiquette"&gt;{{cite book|title=Talkin' White Trash|author=Marbry, Bill|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In common usage, "white trash" overlaps in meaning with "[[Cracker (pejorative)|cracker]]s", used of people in the backcountry of the Southern states; "[[hillbilly]]", regarding poor people from [[Appalachia]]; "[[Okie]]" regarding those with origins in Oklahoma; and "[[redneck]]", regarding rural origins; especially in the South.&lt;ref&gt;Wray (2006), p. x&lt;/ref&gt; The primary difference is that "redneck", "cracker", "Okie", and "hillbilly" emphasize that a person is poor and uneducated and comes from the backwoods with little awareness of and interaction with the modern world, while "white trash" &amp;ndash; and the modern term "[[trailer trash]]" &amp;ndash; emphasizes the person's moral failings.&lt;ref&gt;Wray (2006), pp. 79, 102&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description and causes==
In the popular imagination of the mid-19th century, "poor white trash" were a "curious" breed of degenerate, gaunt, haggard people who suffered from numerous physical and social defects.  They were dirty, callow, ragged, cadaverous, leathery, and emaciated, and had feeble children with distended abdomens who were wrinkled and withered and looked aged beyond their physical years, so that even 10-year-olds' "countenances are stupid and heavy and they often become dropsical and loathsome to sight," according to a New Hampshire schoolteacher. The skin of a poor white Southerner had a "ghastly yellowish-white" tinge to it, like "yellow parchment", and was waxy looking, or they were so white they almost appeared to be [[albino]]s.  They were listless and slothful, did not properly care for their children, and were addicted to alcohol. They were looked on with contempt by upper-class Southerners.&lt;ref&gt;Isenberg (2016), pp.136, 146, 151-52, 167, 170&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] described a white trash woman and her children in ''[[Dred: A Tale of the Great Dismal Swamp]]'', published in 1856:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Crouched on a pile of dirty straw, sat a miserable haggard woman, with large, wild eyes, sunken cheeks, disheveled matted hair, and long, lean hands, like a bird's claws. At her skinny breast an emaciated infant was hanging, pushing, with its little skeleton hands, as if to force nourishment which nature no longer gave; and two scared-looking children, with features wasted and pinched blue with famine, were clinging to her gown. The whole group huddled together, drawing as far away as possible from the new comer {{sic}}, looking up with large, frightened eyes, like hunted wild animals.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harriet Beecher Stowe|Stowe, Harriet Beecher]] (2000} [1856] ''[[Dred: A Tale of the Great Dismal Swamp]]'' Chapel Hill, North Carolia: University of North Carolina Press. pp.105-06. Quoted in Isenberg (2016), p.148-49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Migrant Mother (LOC fsa.8b29516).jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Dorothea Lange]]'s 1936 photograph of [[Florence Thompson]], a migrant worker in California during the [[Great Depression]], along with two of her children.  The photo is known as ''[[Migrant Mother]]'']]

Poor white trash were generally only able to locate themselves on the worst land in the South, since the best land was taken by the slaveholders, large and small. They lived and attempted to survive on land that was sandy or swampy or covered in scrub pine and not suited for agriculture; for this they became known as "sandhillers" and "pineys".&lt;ref name=isenberg146&gt;Isenberg (2016), p.146&lt;/ref&gt;  These "hard-scratch" inhabitants were seen to match their surroundings: they were "stony, stumpy, and shrubby, as they land they lived on."&lt;ref&gt;Burton, Warren (1839) ''White Slavery: A New Emancipation Cause Presented to the United States''. Worcester, Massachusetts. pp.168-69; quoted in Isenberg (2016), p.146&lt;/ref&gt;

Restricted from holding political office due to property qualifications, their ability to vote at the mercy of the courts which were controlled by the slave-holding planters, poor whites had few advocates within the political system or the dominant social hierarchy. Although many were tenant farmers or day laborers, other white trash people were forced to live as scavengers, thieves and vagrants, but all, employed or not, were socially ostracized by "proper" white society by being forced to use the back door when entering "proper" homes. Even slaves looked down on them: when poor whites came begging for food, the slaves called them "stray goats."&lt;ref&gt;Isenberg (2016), pp.149-150&lt;/ref&gt;

Northerners claimed that the existence of white trash was the result of the system of slavery in the South, while Southerners worried that these clearly inferior whites would upset the "natural" class system which held that all whites were superior to all other races, especially blacks.  People of both regions expressed concern that if the number of white trash people increased significantly, they would threaten the Jeffersonian ideal of a population of educated white freemen as the basis of a robust American democracy.&lt;ref name=isenberg136&gt;Isenberg (2016), p.136&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
As a derogatory term, "white trash" and "poor white trash" were preceded by "waste people", which was used in England to describe the [[underclass]] of their American colonies; they initially conceived of America as a "wasteland", and a place to dump their unwanted excess population.&lt;ref&gt;Isenberg (2016), pp.xxvi-xxvii, 17-42&lt;/ref&gt;  "Waste people" gave way to "squatters" and "crackers", used to describe the settlers who populated the western frontier of the United States and the backcountry of some southern states, but who did not have title to the land they settled on.&lt;ref&gt;Isenberg (2016), pp.105-132&lt;/ref&gt; "Cracker" was especially used in the south.

The first use of "white trash" in print occurred in 1821.&lt;ref name=isenberg135&gt;Isenberg (2016), p.135&lt;/ref&gt; It came into common use in the 1830s as a pejorative used by [[house slave]]s against poor whites. In 1833, [[Fanny Kemble]], an English actress visiting Georgia, noted in her journal: "The slaves themselves entertain the very highest contempt for white servants, whom they designate as 'poor white trash'".&lt;ref&gt;[[Fanny Kemble|Kemble, Fannie]] (1835) ''Journal''. p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wray suggests that the term may have originated in the Baltimore-Washington area during the 1840s, when Irish and blacks were competing for the same jobs. Wray (2006),[https://books.google.com/books?id=LX0oi9tz2H8C&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA42 42]-[https://books.google.com/books?id=LX0oi9tz2H8C&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA44 p.44]. The quote from Kemble is reprinted in [https://books.google.com/books?id=LX0oi9tz2H8C&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41 page 41] of the book.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The term achieved widespread popularity in the 1850s,&lt;ref name=isenberg135 /&gt; and by 1855, it had passed into common usage by upper-class whites, and was common usage among all Southerners, regardless of race, throughout the rest of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=What is White Trash?|title=Whiteness: a Critical Reader|publisher=NYU Press|author=[[Annalee Newitz|Newitz, Annalee]]|author2=Wray, Matthew |lastauthoramp=yes|editor=Hill, Mike|accessdate=January 11, 2013|page=170|format=PDF|date=July 1, 1997|url=http://www4.ncsu.edu/~mseth2/com417s12/readings/NewitzWrayWhiteTrash.PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1854, Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote the chapter "Poor White Trash" in her book ''[[A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin]]''. Stowe wrote that slavery not only produces "degraded, miserable slaves", but also poor whites who are even more degraded and miserable. The [[plantation system]] forced those whites to struggle for subsistence. Beyond economic factors, Stowe traces this class to the shortage of schools and churches in their community, and says that both blacks and whites in the area look down on these "poor white trash".&lt;ref&gt;Wray (2006), pp. 57-58&lt;/ref&gt;  In Stowe's second novel ''Dred'', she describes the poor white inhabitants of [[Great Dismal Swamp|that swamp]], which formed much of the border between Virginia and North Carolina, as an ignorant, degenerate and immoral class of people prone to criminality.&lt;ref name=isenberg137&gt;Isenberg (2016), p.137&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hinton Rowan Helper]]'s extremely influential 1857 book ''[[The Impending Crisis of the South]]'' &amp;ndash; which sold 140,000 copies and was considered to be the most important book of the 19th century by many people &amp;ndash; describes the region's poor Caucasians as a class oppressed by the effects of slavery, a people of lesser physical stature who would be driven to extinction by the South's "cesspool of degradation and ignorance."&lt;ref&gt;[[Hinton Rowan Helper|Helper, Hinton Rowan]] (1968) [1857] ''[[The Impending Crisis of the South]]''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Belknap Press; quoted in Isenberg (2016), p.137&lt;/ref&gt;

===During the Civil War===
During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] instituted [[conscription]] to raise soldiers for its army, with all men between the ages of 18 and 35 being eligible to be drafted &amp;ndash; later expanded to all men between 17 and 50.  However, exemptions were numerous, including any slave-owner with more than 20 slaves, political officeholders, teachers, ministers and clerks, and men who worked in valuable trades.  Left to be drafted, or to serve as paid substitutes, were poor white trash Southerners, who were looked down on as cannon fodder.  Conscripts who failed to report for duty were hunted down by so-called "dog catchers".  Poor southerners said that it was a "rich man's war", but "a poor man's fight." While upper-class Southern "cavalier" officers were granted frequent furloughs to return home, this was not the case with the ordinary private soldier, which led to an extremely high rate of desertion among this group, who put their families well-being above the cause of the Confederacy, and thought of themselves as "Conditional Confederates."  Deserters harassed soldiers, raided farms and stole food, and sometimes banded together in settlements, such as the "Free State of Jones" (formerly Jones County) in Mississippi; desertion was openly joked about.  When found, deserters could be executed, or humiliated by being put into chains.&lt;ref&gt;Isenberg (2016), pp.159, 163-65&lt;/ref&gt; 

Despite the war being fought to protect the right of the patrician elite of the South to own slaves, the planter class was reluctant to give up their cash crop, cotton, to grow the corn and grain needed by the Confederate armies and the civilian population.  As a result, food shortages, exacerbated by [[inflation]] and hoarding of foodstuffs by the rich, caused the poor of the South to suffer greatly. This led to food riots of angry mobs of poor women, who raided stores, warehouses and depots looking for sustenance for their families.  Both the male deserters and the female rioters put the lie to the myth of Confederate unity, and that the war was being fought for the rights of all white Southerners.&lt;ref&gt;Isenberg (2016), pp.165-66&lt;/ref&gt;

Ideologically, the Confederacy claimed that the system of slavery in the South was superior to the class divisions of the North, because while the South devolved all its degrading labor onto what it saw as an inferior race, the black slaves, the North did so to its own "brothers in blood", the white working class. This the leaders and intellectuals of the Confederacy called "mudsill" democracy, and lauded the superiority of the pure-blooded Southern slave-owning "cavaliers" &amp;ndash; who were worth five Northerners in a fight &amp;ndash; over the sullied Anglo-Saxon upper class of the North.&lt;ref&gt;Isenberg (2016), pp.157-160&lt;/ref&gt; For its part, some of the military leaders of the North, especially Generals [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and [[William Tecumseh Sherman]], recognized that their fight was not only to liberate slaves, but also the poor white Southerners who were oppressed by the system of slavery.  Thus they took steps to exploit the class divisions between the white trash population and plantation owners. An Army chaplain wrote in a letter to his wife after the Union [[siege of Petersburg|siege of Petersburg, Virginia]] that winning the war would not only result in the end of American slavery, but would also increase opportunities for "poor white trash."  He said that the war would "knock off the shackles of millions of poor whites, whose bondage was really worse than that African." In these respects, the Civil War was in large part a [[class conflict|class war]].&lt;ref&gt;Isenberg (2016), pp.157-160, 172&lt;/ref&gt;

===During Reconstruction===
After the war, President [[Andrew Johnson]]'s first idea for the [[Reconstruction Era|reconstruction of the South]] was not to take steps to create an egalitarian democracy.  Instead, he envisioned what was essentially a "white trash republic", in which the aristocracy would maintain their property holdings and an amount of social power, but be disenfranchised until they could show their loyalty to the Union.  The freed blacks would no longer be slaves, but would still be denied essential rights of citizenship and would make up the lowest rung on the social ladder.  In between would be the poor white Southerner, the white trash, who while occupying a lesser social position, would essentially become the masters of the South, voting and occupying political offices, and maintaining a superior status to the free blacks and freed slaves.  Emancipated from the inequities of the plantation system, poor white trash would become the bulwark of Johnson's rebuilding of the South and its restoration into the Union.&lt;ref&gt;Isenberg (2016), pp.176-78&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson's plan was never put into effect, and the [[Freedmen's Bureau]], &amp;ndash; which was created in 1865, before President [[Abraham Lincoln]] was assassinated &amp;ndash; was authorized to help "all refugees and all freedmen", black and white alike, and the agency did this, despite Johnson's basic lack of concern for the freed slaves the war had supposedly been fought over. But even though they provided relief to them, the Bureau did not accept Johnson's vision of poor whites as the loyal and honorable foundation of a reconstructed South. Northern journalists and other observers maintained that poor white trash, who were now destitute refugees, "beggars, dependents, houseless and homeless wanderers", were still victimized by poverty and vagrancy. They were "loafers" dressed in rags and covered in filth who did no work, but accepted government relief handouts.  They were seen as only slightly more intelligent than blacks. One observer, James R. Gilmore, a cotton merchant and novelist who had traveled throughout the South, wrote the book ''Down in Tennessee'', published in 1864, in which he differentiated poor whites into two groups, "mean whites" and "common whites".  While the former were thieves, loafers and brutes, the latter were law-abiding citizens who were enterprising and productive. It was the "mean" minority who gave white trash their bad name and character. &lt;ref&gt;Isenberg (2016), pp.177-80&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of commentators noted that poor white Southerners did not compare favorably to freed blacks, who were described as "capable, thrifty, and loyal to the Union." Marcus Sterling, a Freedmen's Bureau agent and a former Union officer, said that the "pitiable class of poor whites" were "the only class which seem almost unaffected by the [bureau's] great benevolence and its bold reform", while in contrast black freedmen had become "more settled, industrious and ambitious," eager to learn how to read and improve themselves. Sidney Andrews saw in black a "shrewd instinct for preservation" which poor whites did not have, and [[Whitelaw Reid]], a politician and newspaper editor from Ohio, thought that black children appeared eager to learn. ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'' went so far as to suggest that government policy should switch from "disenfranchis[ing] the humble, quiet, hardworking Negro" and cease to provide help to the "worthless barbarian", the "ignorant, illiterate, and vicious" white trash population.&lt;ref&gt;Isenberg (2016), pp.179-180&lt;/ref&gt;

So, during the Reconstruction Era, white trash were no longer seen simply as a freakish, degenerate breed who lived almost invisibly in the backcountry wilderness, the war had brought them out of the darkness into the mainstream of society, where they developed the reputation of being a dangerous class of criminals, vagrants and delinquents, lacking intelligence, unable to speak properly, the "Homo genus without the sapien", an evolutionary dead end in the [[Social Darwinism|Social Darwinist]] thinking of the time.  Plus, they were immoral, breaking all social codes and sexual norms, engaging in incest and prostitution, pimping out family members, and producing numerous in-bred bastard children.&lt;ref&gt;Isenberg (2016), pp.180-81&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scalawags and rednecks===
One of the responses of Southerners and Northern Democrats after the war to Reconstruction was the invention of the myth of the "[[carpetbagger]]s", those Northern Republican scoundrels and adventurers who invaded the South to take advantage of its people, but less well known is that of the "[[scalawag]]s", those Southern white who betrayed their race by supporting the Republican Party and Reconstruction.  The scalawag, even if they came from a higher social class, was often described as having a "white trash heart". They were accused of easily mingling with blacks, inviting them to dine in their homes, and inciting them by encouraging them to seek social equality. The Democrats retaliated with ''[[Autobiography of a Scalawag]]'', a parody of the standard "self-made man" story, in which a white trash southerner with no innate ambition nevertheless is raised to a position of middling power just by being in the right place at the right time or by lying and cheating.&lt;ref&gt;Isenberg (2016), pp.182-86&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1890, the term "redneck" began to be widely used for poor white southerners, especially those racist followers of the Democratic demagogues of the time. Rednecks were found working in the mills, living deep in the swamps, heckling at Republican rallies, and were even occasionally elected to be a state legislator. Such was the case with Guy Rencher, who claimed that "redneck" came from his own "long red neck".&lt;ref&gt;Isenberg (2016), pp.187-90&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Depression===
The beginning of the 20th century brought no change of status for poor white southerners, especially after the onset of the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]].  The condition of this class was presented to the public in [[Margaret Bourke-White]]'s photographic series for ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, and the work of other photographers made for [[Roy Stryker]]'s Historical Section of the federal [[Resettlement Agency]].  Author [[James Agee]] wrote about them in his ground-breaking work ''[[Let Us Now Praise Famous Men]]'' (1941), as did [[Jonathan Daniels]] in ''A Southerner Discovers the South'' (1938).&lt;ref name=isen20th&gt;Isenberg (2016), pp.206-30&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] agencies tried to help the rural poor to better themselves and to break through the social barriers of Southern society which held them back, reinstating the [[American Dream]] of upward mobility. Programs such as those of the [[Subsistence Homesteads Division]] of the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]]; its successor, the Resettlement Administration, whose express purpose was to help the poor in rural areas; and its replacement, the  [[Farm Security Administration]] which aimed to break the cycle of [[tenant farming]] and [[sharecropping]] and help poor whites and black to own their own farms, and to initiate the creation of the communities necessary to support those farms. The agencies also provided services for migrant workers, such as the [[Arkies]] and [[Okies]], who had been devastated by the [[Dust Bowl]] &amp;ndash; the condition of which was well-documented by photographer [[Dorothea Lange]] in ''An American Exodus'' (1939) &amp;ndash; and been forced to take to the road, jamming all their belongings into Ford motorcars and heading west toward California.&lt;ref name=isen20th /&gt;

Important in the devising and running of these programs were politicians and bureaucrats such as [[Henry Cantwell Wallace|Henry Wallace]], the [[United States Secretary of Agriculture|Secretary of Agriculture]]; [[Milburn Lincoln Wilson]], the first head of the Subsistence Homesteads Division, who was a social scientist and an agricultural expert; and [[Rexford G. Tugwell]], a [[Columbia University]] economics professor who managed to be appointed the first head of the Resettlement Agency, despite refusing to present himself with a "homely, democratic manner" in his confirmation hearings.  Tugwell understood that the status of tenant farmers would not change if they could not vote, so he campaigned against [[poll taxes|poll tax]], which prevented them voting, since they could not afford to pay it.  His agency's goals were the four "R's": "retirement of bad land, relocation of rural poor, resettlement of the unemployed in suburban communities, and rehabilitation of farm families."&lt;ref name=isen20th /&gt;

Other individuals important in the fight to help the rural poor were [[Arthur Raper]], an expert on tenancy farming, whose study ''Preface to Peasantry'' (1936) explained why the south's system held back the region's poor and caused them to migrate; and [[Howard W. Odum|Howard Odum]], a [[University of North Carolina]] sociologist and psychologist who founded the journal ''[[Social Forces]]'', and worked closely with the Federal government.  Odum wrote the 600-page masterwork  ''Southern Regions of the United States'', which became a guidebook for the New Deal. Journalist [[Gerald W. Johnson (journalist)|Gerald W. Johnson]] translated Odum's ideas in the book into a popular volume, ''The Wasted Land''.  It was Odum who, in 1938, mailed questionnaires to academics to determine their views on what "poor white" meant to them.  The results were in many ways indistinguishable from the popular views of "white trash" that had been held for many decades, since the words that came back all indicated serious character flaws in poor whites: "purposeless, hand to mouth, lazy, unambitious, no account, no desire to improve themselves, inertia", but, most often, "shiftless".  Despite the passage of time, poor whites were still seen as white trash, a breed apart, a class partway between blacks and whites, whose shiftless ways may have even originated from their proximity to blacks.&lt;ref name=isen20th/&gt;

===Trailer trash===
In the mid-20th century, poor whites who could not afford to buy suburban-style [[tract housing]] began to purchase mobile homes, which were not only cheaper, but which could be easily relocated if work in one location ran out.  These &amp;ndash; sometimes by choice and sometimes through local [[zoning laws]] &amp;ndash; gathered in trailer camps, and the people who lived in them became known as "[[trailer trash]]".  Despite many of them having jobs, albeit sometimes itinerant ones, the character flaws that had been perceived in poor white trash in the past were transferred to trailer trash, and trailer camps or parks were seen as being inhabited by retired persons, migrant workers, and, generally, the poor.  By 1968, a survey found that only 13% of those who owned and lived in mobile homes had [[White-collar worker|white collar]] jobs.&lt;ref name=isen240&gt;Isenberg (2016), pp.240-47&lt;/ref&gt;

Trailers got their start in the 1930s, and their use proliferated during the housing shortage of [[World War II]], when the Federal government used as many as 30,000 of them to house defense workers, soldiers and sailors throughout the country, but especially around areas with a large military or defense presence, such as [[Mobile, Alabama]] and [[Pascagoula, Mississippi]]. In her book ''Journey Through Chaos'', reporter [[Agnes E. Meyer|Agnes Meyer]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' travelled throughout the country, reporting on the condition of the "neglected rural areas", and described the people who lived in the trailers, tents and shacks in such areas as malnourished, unable to read or write, and generally ragged.  The workers who came to Mobile and Pascagoula to work in the shipyards there were from the backwoods of the South, "subnormal swamp and mountain folk" whom the locals described as "vermin"; elsewhere, they were called "squatters".  They were accused of having loose morals, high illegitimacy rates, and of allowing [[prostitution]] to thrive in their "Hillbilly Havens".  The trailers themselves &amp;ndash; sometimes purchased second- or third-hand &amp;ndash; were often unsightly, unsanitary and dilapidated, causing communities to zone them away from the more desirable areas, which meant away from schools, stores, and other necessary facilities, often literally on the other side of the railroad tracks.&lt;ref name=isen240 /&gt;

== Studies ==
Scholars from the late 19th to the early 21st century explored generations of families who were considered "disreputable", such as [[The Jukes family]] and [[The Kallikak Family]], both [[pseudonym]]s for real families. &lt;ref&gt;Rafter, Nicole Hahn (1988) ''White Trash: The Eugenic Family Studies, 1877-1919''&lt;/ref&gt;

==White popular culture==
[[George Bernard Shaw]] uses the term in his 1909 play ''[[The Shewing-Up of Blanco Posnet]]'', set in the wild American west. The prostitute Feemy says to Blanco "I'll hang you, you dirty horse-thief; or not a man in this camp will ever get a word or a look from me again. You're just trash: that's what you are. White trash."

Ernest Matthew Mickler's ''White Trash Cooking'' (1986) enjoyed an unanticipated rise to popularity. The cookbook, which is based on the cooking of rural white Southerners, features recipes with names such as Goldie's Yo Yo Pudding, Resurrection Cake, Vickies Stickies, and Tutti's Fruited Porkettes.&lt;ref&gt;Edge, John T. (2007) "''White Trash Cooking'', Twenty Years Later", ''Southern Quarterly''. 44(2): pp. 88-94; Smith (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mickler, Ernest Matthew (2011)''White Trash Cooking'' (new ed. 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; As Sherrie A. Inness notes, "white trash authors used humor to express what was happening to them in a society that wished to forget about the poor, especially those who were white". She points out that under the humor was a serious lesson about living in poverty.&lt;ref&gt;Inness, Sherrie A. (2006) ''Secret Ingredients: Race, Gender, and Class at the Dinner Table''. p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1980s, fiction was being published by Southern authors who identified as having redneck or white trash origins, such as [[Harry Crews]], [[Dorothy Allison]], Larry Brown, and Tim McLaurin.&lt;ref&gt;Bledsoe, Erik (2000) [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/southern_cultures/summary/v006/6.1.bledsoe.html "The Rise of Southern Redneck and White Trash Writers"], ''Southern Cultures'' 6#1 pp. 68-90 &lt;/ref&gt; Autobiographies sometimes mention white trash origins. Gay rights activist [[Amber L. Hollibaugh]] wrote, "I grew up a [[mixed-race]], white-trash girl in a country that considered me dangerous, corrupt, fascinating, exotic. I responded to the challenge by becoming that alarming, hazardous, sexually disruptive woman."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hollibaugh, Amber L.|title=My Dangerous Desires: A Queer Girl Dreaming Her Way Home|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=41bNbaMuyPoC&amp;pg=PA12|year= 2000|publisher=Duke University Press|pages=12, 209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Black popular culture==
Use of "white trash" epithets has been extensively reported in [[African American]] culture.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Julius Wilson|Wilson, William Julius]]in Cashmore, Ernest and Jennings, James eds. (2001) ''Racism: Essential Readings'' p.188&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Philip C. Kolin 2007 p. 29"&gt;Kolin, Philip C. (2007) ''Contemporary African American Women Playwrights''. p.29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roediger, David R. (1999) ''Take Black on White: Black Writers on What It Means to be White'' pp.13, 123&lt;/ref&gt; Black authors have noted that blacks, when taunted by whites as "[[niggers]]", taunted back, calling them "white trash".&lt;ref name="Philip C. Kolin 2007 p. 29"/&gt; Some black parents taught their children that poor whites were "white trash".&lt;ref&gt;Obiakor, Festus E. and Ford, Bridgie Alexis (2002) ''Creating Successful Learning Environments for African-American Learners With Exceptionalities'' p.198&lt;/ref&gt;  The epithet appears in [[African American folktales|black folklore]].&lt;ref&gt;Prahlad, Anand (2006) ''The Greenwood Encyclopedia of African American Folklore''. volume 2, p.966&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, slaves (when out of earshot of whites) would refer to harsh slave owners as a "low down" man, "lower than poor white trash", "a brute, really".&lt;ref&gt;Nolen, Claude H. (2005) ''African American Southerners in Slavery, Civil War and Reconstruction''. p.81&lt;/ref&gt;
