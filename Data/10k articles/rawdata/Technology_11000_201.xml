      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4721">'''Augmented reality-assisted surgery''' ('''ARAS''') is a surgical  tool utilizing technology that superimposes a [[computer-generated image]] on a surgeon’s view of the operative field, thus providing a composite view for the surgeon of the patient with a computer generated overlay enhancing the operative experience. It can be used for training, preparation for an operation, or performance of an operation. ARAS can be performed using a wide array of technology, including an [[optical head-mounted display]] (OHMD)—such as the [[Google Glass]] XE 22.1 or Vuzix STAR 1200 XL&lt;ref name="HakkyAug15"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hakky |first1=Tariq |last2=Martinez |first2=Daniel |last3=Lipshultz |first3=Larry |last4=Spiess |first4=Philippe |last5=Carrion |first5=Rafael |title=Augmented Reality Assisted Urologic Surgery (ARAUS): A surgical training tool |journal=The Journal of Urology |volume=193 |issue=4 |pages=e271 |year=2015 |doi=10.1016/j.juro.2015.02.1254}}&lt;/ref&gt;—and a digital overlay from robotic and laparoscopic surgery feeds.&lt;ref name="Scopis12"&gt;{{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4emmCcBb4s |title=Scopis Augmented Reality: Path guidance to craniopharyngioma |author=Scopis Surgical Navigation |publisher=YouTube |date=23 November 2012 |accessdate=16 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique has been primarily been tested in the [[urology|urological]] and [[cardiovascular system|cardiovascular]] domains.&lt;ref name="HakkyAug15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DickeyAug15"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Augmented reality assisted surgery: A urologic training tool |journal=Asian Journal of Andrology |author1=Dickey, R.M. |author2=Srikishen, N. |author3=Lipshultz, L.I. |volume=0 |issue=0 |pages=0 |doi=10.4103/1008-682X.166436 |pmid=26620455|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PetersAug15"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ewh.ieee.org/r7/toronto/events/may2115.html |title=Augmented-Reality Assisted Surgery on the Beating Heart |author=Peters, Terry |publisher=IEEE Toronto |date=21 May 2015 |accessdate=16 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specialized uses==
A subset of ARAS called augmented reality-assisted urologic surgery (ARAUS) specifically aids with urological [[surgery]]. This intraoperative training tool was first described and utilized by Tariq S. Hakky, Ryan M. Dickey, and Larry I. Lipshultz within the Scott Department of Urology, Baylor College of Medicine, and Daniel R. Martinez, Rafael E. Carrion, and Philippe E. Spiess within the Sexual Medicine Program in the Department of Urology, at the University of South Florida.&lt;ref name="HakkyAug15" /&gt; It was initially used to teach medical residents how to place a [[penile prosthesis]] from start to finish via an application downloaded onto the OHMD. Intraoperatively, an optical display camera output feed combined with [[software]] allowing for the detection of points of interest enabled faculty to interact with residents during the placement of the penile prosthesis. Both faculty and residents demonstrated a high degree of satisfaction of the ARAUS experience, and it was shown to be an effective tool in training urological surgical technique. Advantages of ARAUS include real-time feedback of residents during surgery and superior visibility and interaction between faculty and residents.&lt;ref name="HakkyAug15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DickeyAug15" /&gt;

ARAS has also been applied to the cardiovascular realm. Terry Peters of the University of Western Ontario in London, Canada has teamed up with other researchers at the Robarts Research Institute to implement ARAS towards the goal of improving repairs to the heart's [[mitral valve]] and replacement of the [[aortic valve]].&lt;ref name="PetersAug15" /&gt; In an interview for the Medical Augmented Reality Blog, Peters stated that his research team could not only use ARAS to "[improve] the speed and safety of the cardiac valve repair procedure"; they also conducted "the evaluation of an AR environment to plan [[Brain tumor|brain-tumor]] removal, and the development of an ARF-enhanced system for ultrasound-guided [[Anesthesia#Spinal, epidural and caudal anesthesia|spinal injections]]."&lt;ref name="BichlmeierInt14"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://medicalaugmentedreality.com/2014/11/interview-with-terry-peters-bringing-research-to-clinical-practice/ |title=Interview with Terry Peters – Bringing Research to Clinical Practice  |author=Bichlmeier, Christoph |work=Medical Augmented Reality Blog |date=8 November 2014 |accessdate=16 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All three of these winning articles were written by Marian Bendeth, a regular contributor and fragrance expert.

In 2009, the website won a prize for Best Web Editorial at the [[Jasmine Awards]] for an article by the writer, Liz Upton. The following year, the same prize was won by the Basenotes writer, Walker Minton. In 2018, Claire Vukcevic won the Best Practical Guide Award for her guide to summer fragrances on Basenotes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thejasmineawards.co.uk/the-fragrance-foundation-jasmine-awards-2018-winners|title=The Fragrance Foundation Jasmine Awards 2018 Winners {{!}} The Jasmine Awards|last=|first=|date=|website=thejasmineawards.co.uk|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=28 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.basenotes.net/features/3482-summer-fragrances-for-people-who-hate-summer-and-also-summer-fragrances|title=Summer Fragrances for People Who Hate Summer &amp; Also Summer Fragrances ~ by Claire Vukcevic — Basenotes.net|last=|first=|date=|website=www.basenotes.net|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=28 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2008, Basenotes was one of 50 websites recommended by ''[[Men's Vogue]]'' in a best-of-the-web round-up which also featured [[IMDB]], [[Slashdot]], [[Boing Boing]] and [[eLuxury]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mensvogue.com/design/articles/best_websites_hub 50 Recommended Web sites: Tech: mensvogue.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080811192318/http://www.mensvogue.com/design/articles/best_websites_hub |date=11 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

Much suspicion surrounds the censorship process on the site, whereby opinions which differ from the orthodoxy as presented by the site moderators are removed. Frequently, this results in the banning of members who express non-compliant views. It has been suggested that there are commercial motives behind this censorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://basenotessucks.blogspot.co.uk|title=No To Basenotes Censorship|last=|first=|date=|website=basenotessucks.blogspot.co.uk|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=28 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fragrance house O'Driu, who apparently suffered as a result of this perceived  bias, famously responded by releasing a fragrance called "Basenotes Kiss My Ass", which won an award at the Cafleurebon 2015 fragrance awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cafleurebon.com/cafleurebon-best-and-worst-perfumes-of-2015-best-fragrance-best-perfumer-and-hall-of-fame-draw|title=best fragrances of 2015|last=|first=|date=2015-12-27|work=Cafleurebon - Perfume and Beauty Blog|access-date=28 May 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vast majority of [[explosives]] are '''chemical explosives'''. Explosives usually have less potential energy than fuels, but their high rate of energy release produces a great blast pressure.  [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]] has a detonation velocity of 6,940&amp;nbsp;m/s compared to 1,680&amp;nbsp;m/s for the detonation of a pentane-air mixture, and the 0.34-m/s [[stoichiometric]] flame speed of gasoline combustion in air.

The properties of the explosive indicate the class into which it falls. In some cases explosives can be made to fall into either class by the conditions under which they are initiated. In sufficiently large quantities, almost all low explosives can undergo a Deflagration to Detonation Transition (DDT). For convenience, low and high explosives may be [[wikt:differentiate|differentiate]]d by the shipping and storage classes. 

==Chemical explosive reaction==
A chemical explosive is a compound or mixture which, upon the application of heat or shock, [[decompose]]s or rearranges with extreme rapidity, yielding much [[gas]] and heat. Many substances not ordinarily classed as explosives may do one, or even two, of these things. For example, at high temperatures (&gt; 2000&amp;nbsp;°C) a mixture of [[nitrogen]] and [[oxygen]] can be made to react rapidly and yield the gaseous product [[nitric oxide]]; yet the mixture is not an explosive since it does not evolve heat, but rather absorbs heat.

:N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 NO − 43,200 [[calorie]]s (or 180 [[Joule|kJ]]) per [[mole (unit)|mole]] of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

For a chemical to be an explosive, it must exhibit all of the following:
* Rapid expansion (i.e., rapid production of gases or rapid heating of surroundings)
* Evolution of heat
* Rapidity of reaction
* Initiation of reaction

==Sensitiser==
A sensitiser is a powdered or fine particulate material that is sometimes used to create voids that aid in the initiation or propagation of the detonation wave.  It may be as high-tech as glass beads or as simple as seeds.

==Measurement of chemical explosive reaction==
The development of new and improved types of ammunition requires a continuous program of research and development. Adoption of an explosive for a particular use is based upon both proving ground and service tests. Before these tests, however, preliminary estimates of the characteristics of the explosive are made. The principles of [[thermochemistry]] are applied for this process.

Thermochemistry is concerned with the changes in internal energy, principally as heat, in chemical reactions. An explosion consists of a series of reactions, highly exothermic, involving decomposition of the ingredients and recombination to form the products of explosion. Energy changes in explosive reactions are calculated either from known chemical laws or by analysis of the products.

For most common reactions, tables based on previous investigations permit rapid calculation of energy changes. Products of an explosive remaining in a closed [[calorimeter|calorimetric bomb]] (a constant-volume explosion) after cooling the bomb back to room temperature and pressure are rarely those present at the instant of maximum temperature and pressure. Since only the final products may be analyzed conveniently, indirect or theoretical methods are often used to determine the maximum temperature and pressure values.

Some of the important characteristics of an explosive that can be determined by such theoretical computations are:

* Oxygen balance
* Heat of explosion or reaction
* Volume of products of explosion
* Potential of the explosive

==Balancing chemical explosion equations==
In order to assist in balancing chemical equations, an order of priorities is presented in table 1. Explosives containing C, H, O, and N and/or a metal will form the products of reaction in the priority sequence shown. Some observation you might want to make as you balance an equation:

* The progression is from top to bottom; you may skip steps that are not applicable, but you never back up.
* At each separate step there are never more than two compositions and two products.
* At the conclusion of the balancing, elemental nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen are always found in diatomic form.

Example, [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]]:

:C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;; → : 7C + 5H + 3N + 6O

Using the order of priorities in table 1, priority 4 gives the first reaction products:

:7C + 6O → 6CO with one mol of carbon remaining

Next, since all the oxygen has been combined with the carbon to form CO, priority 7 results in:

:3N → 1.5N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Finally, priority 9 results in: 5H → 2.5H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

The balanced equation, showing the products of reaction resulting from the detonation of TNT is:

:C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → 6CO + 2.5H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 1.5N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + C

Notice that partial moles are permitted in these calculations. The number of moles of gas formed is 10. The product carbon is a solid.

==Example of thermochemical calculations==

The [[PETN]] reaction will be examined as an example of thermo-chemical calculations.

:PETN: C(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ONO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
:Molecular weight = 316.15 g/mol
:Heat of formation = 119.4 kcal/mol

(1) Balance the chemical reaction equation. Using table 1, priority 4 gives the first reaction products:

:5C + 12O → 5CO + 7O

Next, the hydrogen combines with remaining oxygen:

:8H + 7O → 4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 3O

Then the remaining oxygen will combine with the CO to form CO and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

:5CO + 3O → 2CO + 3CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Finally the remaining nitrogen forms in its natural state (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

:4N → 2N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

The balanced reaction equation is:

:C(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ONO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → 2CO + 4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 3CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

(2) Determine the number of molar volumes of gas per mole. Since the molar volume of one gas is equal to the molar volume of any other gas, and since all the products of the PETN reaction are gaseous, the resulting number of molar volumes of gas (''N&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'') is:

:''N&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 2 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 11 ''V''&lt;sub&gt;molar&lt;/sub&gt;/mol

(3) Determine the potential (capacity for doing work). If the total heat liberated by an explosive under constant volume conditions (''Q&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'') is converted to the equivalent work units, the result is the potential of that explosive.

The heat liberated at constant volume (''Q&lt;sub&gt;mv&lt;/sub&gt;'') is equivalent to the heat liberated at constant pressure (''Q&lt;sub&gt;mp&lt;/sub&gt;'') plus that heat converted to work in expanding the surrounding medium. Hence, ''Q&lt;sub&gt;mv&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''Q&lt;sub&gt;mp&lt;/sub&gt;'' + work (converted).

:a. ''Q&lt;sub&gt;mp&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''Q&lt;sub&gt;fi&lt;/sub&gt;'' (products) − ''Q&lt;sub&gt;fk&lt;/sub&gt;'' (reactants)

::where: ''Q&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' = heat of formation (see table 1)

::For the PETN reaction:

:::''Q&lt;sub&gt;mp&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 2(26.343) + 4(57.81) + 3(94.39) − (119.4) = 447.87 kcal/mol

::(If the compound produced a metallic oxide, that heat of formation would be included in ''Q&lt;sub&gt;mp&lt;/sub&gt;''.)

:b. Work = 0.572''N&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 0.572(11) = 6.292 kcal/mol

:As previously stated, ''Q&lt;sub&gt;mv&lt;/sub&gt;'' converted to equivalent work units is taken as the potential of the explosive.

:c. Potential ''J'' = ''Q&lt;sub&gt;mv&lt;/sub&gt;'' (4.185 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; kg)(MW) = 454.16 (4.185 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;) 316.15 = 6.01 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; J kg

:This product may then be used to find the relative strength (RS) of PETN, which is

:d. RS = Pot (PETN) = 6.01 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; = 2.21 Pot (TNT) 2.72 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;

==Producing the gauze==
A dense water-based slurry of [[magnesium hydroxide]] and [[magnesium acetate]] is forced through a small hole in a metal plate. On exposure to air it solidifies sufficiently to make a thread which is shaped into the required form.

==Use==
When exposed to a hot flame, a basket made of this composite gauze would burn away the acetate, leaving a brittle but serviceable magnesia ([[magnesium oxide]]) basket behind as the mantle. Charles Lungren subsequently patented&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=US|number=336576|title=Incandescent Gas Light|pubdate=23 February 1886|fdate=12 August 1885|inventor=Charles Lungren}}&lt;/ref&gt; a support mechanism which allowed such fragile baskets to be employed more easily. Clamond filed a related patent&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=US|number=631617|title=Incandescent Gas Light Mantle|pubdate=22 August 1899|fdate=13 May 1899|inventor=Charles Clamond}}&lt;/ref&gt; which deals with production, storage, and transport-proofing mantles.

'''Confetti''' are small pieces or streamers of [[paper]], [[mylar]], or metallic material which are usually thrown at [[celebration (party)|celebrations]], especially [[parades]] and [[Wedding|weddings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/confetti |title=American Heritage Dictionary |publisher=Yourdictionary.com |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2014-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origins are from the Latin ''confectum'', with ''confetti'' the plural of Italian ''confetto'', small sweet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/confetti |title=Confetti - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2014-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern paper confetti trace back to symbolic rituals of tossing grains and sweets during special occasions, traditional for numerous cultures throughout history as an ancient custom dating back to pagan times,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/confetti |title=confetti - definition of confetti by The Free Dictionary |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.candyfavorites.com/shop/catalog-jordan-almond-history.php |title=A Brief History of Jordan Almonds (Confetti) |publisher=Candy Favorites |date= |accessdate=2014-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; but adapted from sweets and grains to paper through the centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailyapple.blogspot.com/2008/12/apple-360-confetti.html |title=The Daily Apple: Apple #360: Confetti |publisher=Dailyapple.blogspot.com |date=2008-12-31 |accessdate=2014-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Confetti are made in a variety of colors, and commercially available confetti come in many different shapes. A distinction is made between confetti and [[glitter]]; glitter is smaller than confetti (pieces usually no larger than 1mm) and is universally shiny. Most table confetti are also shiny. While they are called metallic confetti they are actually metallized PVC. The most popular shape is the star{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}. Seasonally, Snowflake Confetti are the most requested shape{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}. Most [[party]] supply stores carry paper and metallic confetti. Confetti are commonly used at social gatherings such as parties, weddings, and [[Bar Mitzvah]]s, but are often considered taboo at funerals, due to the somber atmosphere. The simplest confetti are simply shredded paper (see [[ticker-tape parade]]), and can be made with scissors or a [[paper shredder]].  Other confetti often consist of [[Chad (paper)|chad]]s punched out of scrap paper.  A [[hole punch]] can be used to make small round chads.  For more elaborate chads, a [[ticket punch]] can be used. Most pieces of paper flats will flutter as [[tumblewing]]s giving flight times because of gliding aerodynamics.

In recent years the use of confetti as a cosmetic addition to trophy presentations at sporting events has become increasingly common. In this case, larger strips of paper (typically measuring 20&amp;nbsp;mm × 60&amp;nbsp;mm) in the colors appropriate to the team or celebration are used.  For smaller volumes of confetti, [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS]] or [[PVC]] "barrels" are filled and the confetti is projected via a "cannon" (a small [[pressure vessel]]) using compressed air or [[carbon dioxide]].  For larger venues or volumes of confetti, a [[Venturi effect|venturi]] air mover powered by [[carbon dioxide]] is used to propel significantly larger volumes of confetti greater distances.

==History==
Since the Middle Ages, in Northern Italy it was common usage for the participants of carnival parades to throw objects at the crowd, mostly mud balls, eggs, coins or fruit. These traditions are still present in some towns in different forms, such as the "Battle of the Oranges" in [[Ivrea]].

The use of throwing objects at parades is well documented in Milan since the 14th century. The nobles used to throw candies and flowers during the parades while dames threw eggshells filled with essences and perfumes. Lower-class people mocked the nobles by throwing rotten eggs, and battles among enemy factions or districts became common. In 1597, the city governor [[Juan Fernández de Velasco]] imposed a ban on the eggs throwing, along with banning ''squittaroli'' (spraying liquids in the street)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QQ1wBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT85&amp;lpg=PT85&amp;dq=Juan+Fernández+de+Velasco+confetti+ban&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UY8NtvhYYG&amp;sig=JY3xsMXYlp8KPrWrnewZVs4UM_0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjJvLSp34zQAhXJZCYKHSHpAFcQ6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Juan%20Fernández%20de%20Velasco%20confetti%20ban&amp;f=false |title=Wedding Bells and Chimney Sweeps « Bruce Montague |accessdate=2016-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other immoral behaviors. The custom disappeared for about a century, coming back in the 1700s in the form of launch of small candies, mostly sugar-coated seeds. The seeds used for the sugar candies were mostly Coriander (''coriandolo'' in Italian), a common plantation in the area: the Italian name for confetti is indeed ''coriandoli''.&lt;ref name="corriere2004"&gt;[http://milano.corriere.it/vivimilano/arte_e_cultura/articoli/2004/02_Febbraio/25/coriandoli.shtml] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100703021847/http://milano.corriere.it/vivimilano/arte_e_cultura/articoli/2004/02_Febbraio/25/coriandoli.shtml|date=July 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The candies were expensive, though, and the lower classes often used small [[chalk]] balls instead, called ''benis de gess'' (chalk candy). Those were officially defined as "the only material allowed to be thrown during the parades" in an edict by the Prefect of Milan in 1808, but the battles fought with them in the 1800s became too large and dangerous, with hundreds of people involved, leading to a ban of the chalk pellets. People circumvented the ban by using mud balls.&lt;ref name="corriere2004"/&gt;

In 1875, an Italian businessman from [[Milan]], Enrico Mangili, began selling paper confetti for use in the upcoming ''carnevale di Milano'', the yearly parade held along the streets of the city.&lt;ref name="Lagobba.it"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lagobba.it/?p=482 |title=Enrico Mangili, l’inventore dei coriandoli « Cascina Gobba |publisher=Lagobba.it |date=2010-11-21 |accessdate=2014-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At that time, the province of Milan was one of the main hubs of silk manufacturing. Mangili begun collecting the small punched paper disks that were left as a byproduct from the production of the holed sheets used by the [[silkworm]] breeders as cage bedding, and selling them for profit. The new paper confetti were well received by the customers, being less harmful, funnier and cheaper than the alternatives, and their use quickly replaced previous customs in Milan and northern Italy.&lt;ref name="Lagobba.it"/&gt;

''[[Scientific American]]'' recorded that the throwing of paper confetti (plain shredded paper) occurred at the 1885 New Year's Eve in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;http://how-to-x.info/180675-what-is-the-origin-of-confetti.htm{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Paper confetti became common in all of Europe in just a couple of decades later (unlike [[ticker tape parade]]s, which never received as wide a diffusion as they did in the U.S.).

==Alternatives==
[[File:Bubbles confetti Dryham Park country club wedding.jpg|thumb|Bubbles used in place of confetti]]
A recent innovation{{when|date=February 2016}} at weddings is to use natural petal confetti. These are made from freeze-dried flower petals and are completely biodegradeable. In fact, many venues{{Who|date=June 2018}} now require that only these biodegradable versions may be used. Some wedding venues have decided that due to the mess and potential inconvenience caused by the use of confetti to ban its usage completely. One way that this restriction has been circumvented is to use soap bubbles in place of confetti.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Wedding Confetti, where did it come from, and where is it going?

== Etymology and Italian ''confetti'' ==
[[File:Amande-avolas-blanche.gif|thumb|Italian confetti]]
The [[English language|English]] word ''[[wikt:confetti|confetti]]'' (to denote [[Jordan almonds]]) is adopted from the [[Italy|Italian]] [[confectionery]] of the same name, which was a small sweet traditionally thrown during [[carnivals]].&lt;ref name="Etymology and Origin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://celebrationsandme.posterous.com/etymology |title=Etymology and Origin |publisher=Celebrationsandme.posterous.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also known as ''[[dragée]]'' or [[comfit]], Italian confetti are [[almond]]s with a hard [[sugar]] coating; their name equates to French ''[[confit]]''. The Italian word for paper confetti is ''[[wikt:coriandolo|coriandoli]]'' which refers to the [[coriander]] seeds originally contained within the sweet.&lt;ref name="Italian Confetti"&gt;{{cite web |author=&amp;nbsp;Posted by admin on June 29, 2011 |url=http://www.foodinitaly.org/a-brief-history-of-confetti/ |title=A Brief History of Confett |publisher=Foodinitaly.org |date=2011-06-29 |accessdate=2014-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130414183247/http://www.foodinitaly.org/a-brief-history-of-confetti/ |archivedate=April 14, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By tradition, the Italian ''confetti'' (sugar coated almonds) are given out at weddings and baptisms (white coating), or graduations (red coating), often wrapped in a small [[tulle netting|tulle]] bag as a gift to the guests. For a wedding, they are said to represent the hope that the new couple will have a fertile [[marriage]]. The [[United Kingdom|British]] adapted the missiles to [[weddings]] (displacing the traditional grains or rice symbolising sexual fertility) at the end of the 19th century, using symbolic shreds of coloured paper rather than real sweets.&lt;ref name="Etymology and Origin"/&gt;

Since many people lean on a desk while using it, a desk must be sturdy. In most cases, people sit at a desk, either on a separate [[chair]] or a built-in chair (e.g., in some school desks). Some people use [[standing desk]]s to be able to stand while using them.

==Etymology==
The word "desk" originated from the Modern Latin word ''desca'' "table to write on", from the mid 14th century.&lt;ref name=etymonline&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=help+desk/|title=Desk|publisher= Online Etymology |accessdate=2012-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a modification of the Old Italian ''desco'' "table", from Latin ''discus'' "dish" or "disc".&lt;ref name=MerriamWebster/&gt; The word desk has been used figuratively since 1797.&lt;ref name=etymonline/&gt; A desk may also be known as a bureau, counter, [[davenport desk|davenport]], [[escritoire]], [[lectern]], reading stand, [[rolltop desk]], school desk, workspace, or [[writing desk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://thesaurus.com/browse/desk+?s=t/|title=Desk |publisher=Thesaurus.com|accessdate=2012-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Yokeback armchair and painting table, Ming dynasty, Metropolitan Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|Chinese editing desk of the 12th century]]
Desk-style furniture appears not to have been used in [[classical antiquity]] or in other ancient centers of literate civilization in the [[Middle East]] or [[Far East]], but there is no specific proof. [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] illustrations show the first pieces of furniture which seem to have been designed and constructed for reading and writing. Before the invention of the movable type [[printing press]] in the 15th century, any reader was potentially a writer or publisher or both, since any [[book]] or other [[document]] had to be copied by hand. The desks were designed with slots and hooks for [[bookmark]]s and for writing implements. Since manuscript volumes were sometimes large and heavy, desks of the period usually had massive structures.&lt;ref name=FineWoodWorking&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.finewoodworking.com/PlansAndProjects/PlansAndProjectsAllAbout.aspx?id=3029 |title=A Short History of Desks |publisher= FineWoodWorking.com |accessdate=2012-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Desks of the [[Renaissance]] and later eras had relatively slimmer structures, and more and more drawers were added as [[woodworking]] became more precise and [[cabinet-making]] became a distinct trade.&lt;ref name=FineWoodWorking/&gt; It is often possible to find out if a table or other piece of furniture of those times was designed to be used as a desk, by looking for a drawer with three small separations (one each for the ink pot, the [[Blotting paper|blotter]] and the powder tray) and storage for [[pen]]s.

The basic desk forms were developed mostly in the 17th and 18th centuries. The modern [[ergonomic desk]] is a refinement of the mechanically complex [[drawing table]] or drafting table&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/drafting+table |title=Drawing table|publisher= The Free Dictionary By Farlex. |accessdate=2012-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the end of the 18th century.

==Industrial era==
[[File:Desk333.JPG|thumb|An office desk in a cubicle, which shows the sharing of space between computer components and paper documents.]]
Refinements to the first desk forms were considerable through the 19th century, as [[steam power|steam-driven]] machinery made cheap [[wood-pulp paper]] possible towards the end of the first phase of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. This allowed an increase in the number of the [[white-collar worker]]s. As these office workers grew in number, desks were [[mass production|mass-produced]] for them in large quantities, using newer, steam-driven woodworking machinery. This was the first sharp division in desk manufacturing. From then on, limited quantities of finely crafted desks have been continued to be constructed by master cabinetmakers for the homes and offices of the rich, while the vast majority of desks were assembled rapidly by unskilled labor from components turned out in batches by [[machine tools]]. Thus, age alone does not guarantee that an antique desk is a masterpiece, since this split in quality took place more than a hundred years ago.

More paper and correspondence drove the need for more complex desks and more specialized desks, such as the [[rolltop desk]] which was a mass-produced, slatted variant of the classical [[cylinder desk]].&lt;ref name=potted&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.desk.uk.com/history.asp/|title=A Potted History of Writing Furniture|publisher=Dorking Desks|accessdate=2012-05-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421211013/http://www.desk.uk.com/history.asp|archivedate=2012-04-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It provided a relatively fast and cheap way to lock up the ever increasing flow of paperwork without having to file everything by the end of the day. Paper documents became voluminous enough to be stored separately in [[filing cabinet]]s. Correspondence and other documents were now too numerous to get enough attention to be rolled up or folded again, then summarized and tagged before being [[Pigeon-hole messagebox|pigeonholed]] in a small compartment over or under the work surface of the desk. The famous [[Wooton desk]] and others were the last manifestations of the "pigeonhole" style. The surfaces of some newer desks could be transformed into many different shapes and angles, and were ideal for artists, draftsmen, and engineers.

==Steel versions==
A small boom in office work and desk production occurred at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th with the introduction of smaller and less expensive electrical presses{{elucidate|date=April 2015}} and efficient [[carbon paper]] coupled with the general acceptance of the [[typewriter]]. Steel desks were introduced to take heavier loads of paper and withstand the pounding meted out on the typewriters. This also gave rise to the "[[typewriter desk]]", a platform, sometimes on wheels and with expandable surface via flaps, that was built to a specific height to make typing easier and more comfortable than when using a standard or traditional desk. The L-shaped desk also became popular, with the "leg" being used as an annex for the typewriter.

Another big expansion occurred after the [[Second World War]] with the spread of [[photocopying]]. Paperwork further increased the number of desk workers, whose work surfaces diminished in size as office rents rose, and the paper itself was moved more and more directly to filing cabinets or sent to specialized [[records management center]]s, or transformed into [[microfilm]], or both. Modular desks seating several co-workers close by became common. Even executive or management desks became mass-produced, built of cheap [[plywood]] or [[fiberboard]] covered with wood finish, as the number of people managing the white collar workers became even greater.

==Student models==
[[File:SchoolDeskBenchWebsterNewYork.jpg|thumb|School desk manufactured by the American S.F. Company of [[Buffalo, New York]] in about 1900]] [[File:Student Desk.jpg|thumb|Student desk and chair commonly used in high schools and universities.]]
A student desk can be any desk form meant for use by an enrollee in elementary, secondary or postsecondary education. Anna Breadin designed and patented a one-piece school desk in the late 1880s that was built with a table section attached in front of a wooden seat and back rest. Before this, most students in America sat either on chairs or long benches at long tables.&lt;ref name=interior&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linuxhow.in/articles/home-family/interior-design/a-short-history-of-school-desks/|title=A Short History of Desks|publisher=Interior Design|accessdate=2012-05-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120804114909/http://www.linuxhow.in/articles/home-family/interior-design/a-short-history-of-school-desks/|archivedate=2012-08-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In homes, the term "student desk" designates a small [[pedestal desk]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pedestal%20desk|title=Pedestal desk|publisher= Merriam-Webster |accessdate=2012-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[writing table]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/writing+table |title=Writing table|publisher= The Free Dictionary By Farlex |accessdate=2012-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; constructed for use by a teenager or a pre-teen in their room. It often is a pedestal desk, with only one of the two pedestals and about two-thirds of the desk surface. Such desks are sometimes called "left-pedestal desks" and "right-pedestal desks", depending on the position of the single pedestal. These desks are not as tall as normal adult desks. In some cases, the desk is connected from the seat to the table.

The desks are usually mass-produced in steel or wood and sold on the consumer market.&lt;ref name=interior/&gt; There is a wide variety of plans available for woodworking enthusiasts to build their own versions. Modern mass-produced student desks are often made with laminate table tops and molded plastic seats in a combined single unit, with storage found under the desktop or on a wire shelf beneath the seat.&lt;ref name=interior/&gt; There are many novel forms of student desks made to maximize the relatively restricted area available in a child's room. One of the most common is the bunk-bed desk, also called the "[[loft bed]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.hgtv.com/home-improvement/how-to-build-a-loft-bed-with-a-desk-underneath/index.html|title=How to Build a Loft Bed With a Desk Underneath|publisher= HGTV |accessdate=2012-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence of computers==
[[File:Schreibtisch.2.JPG|thumb|A desk in an office.]]
Until the late 1980s, desks remained a place for paperwork and "business machines", but the personal computer was taking hold in large and medium-sized businesses.  New office suites included a "knee hole" credenza which was a place for a terminal or personal computer and keyboard tray. Soon, new office designs also included "U-shape" suites which added a bridge worksurface between the back credenza and front desk. During the North American recession of the early 1990s, many managers and executive workers were required to do [[word processing]] and other functions previously completed by [[typing pool]]s and secretaries.  This necessitated a more central placement of the computer on these "U-shape" suite desk systems.

With computers more prevalent, "computer paper" became an office supply. The beginning of this paper boom gave birth to the dream of the "[[paperless office]]", in which all information would only appear on [[computer monitor]]s. However, the ease of printing personal documents and the lack of comfort with reading text on computer monitors led to a great deal of document printing.  The need for paperwork space vied with the increased desk space taken up by computer monitors, computers, printers, scanners, and other peripherals. The need for more space led some desk companies to attach some accessory items to the [[modesty panel]] at the back of the desk, such as [[outlet strip]]s and [[cable management]], in an attempt to clear the desktop of electrical clutter.

Through the "tech boom" of the 1990s, office worker numbers increased along with the cost of office space rent.  The [[cubicle desk]] became widely accepted in North America as an economical way of squeezing more desk workers into the same space, without further shrinking the size of their cramped working surfaces. The cubicle walls have become new place for workers to affix papers and other items once left on the horizontal desktop surface. Even computer monitor bezels themselves were used to attach [[Post-it note|reminder notes]] and [[business card]]s.

Early in the 2000s, private office workers found that their side and back computer-placing furniture made it hard to show the contents of a computer screen to guests or co-workers. Manufacturers have responded to this issue by creating "forward facing" desks where computer monitors are placed on the front of the "U-shape" workstation. This forward computer monitor placement promotes a clearer sight-line to greet colleagues and allows for common viewing of information displayed on a screen.

Replacement of bulky [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] monitors with flat panel [[LCD]]s freed up significant room on desktops.  However, the size of displays often increased to accommodate multiple on-screen windows, to display more and more information simultaneously. The lighter weight and slimmer profile of the new displays allowed them to be mounted on flexible arms, so they could be swung into view or out of the way, and adjusted frequently as needed.

==Notable examples==
The [[Resolute desk|''Resolute'' desk]] in the [[Oval Office]] has been used by many American presidents, including [[John F. Kennedy]], [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Barack Obama]]. It is made from the timbers of {{HMS|Resolute|1850|6}}, an abandoned British ship discovered by an American vessel and returned to [[Queen Victoria|Queen Victoria of Great Britain]] as a token of friendship and goodwill. Queen Victoria commissioned the desk from William Evenden, Royal Naval Dockyard at Chatham, England, and presented to President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] in 1880.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.whitehousemuseum.org/furnishings/resolute-desk.htm |title=Resolute desk |publisher= The White House Museum |accessdate=2012-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modeling==
{{See also|Open Design Alliance}}

Digitally fabricated objects are created with a variety of [[CAD software]] packages, using both [[2D vector drawing]], and [[3D modeling]]. Types of 3D models include four models wireframe, solid, surface and mesh. A design is having one or more of these model types.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = About Modeling 3D Objects {{!}} AutoCAD {{!}} Autodesk Knowledge Network|url = https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/autocad/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2016/ENU/AutoCAD-Core/files/GUID-9DACE807-BC9D-4357-B47E-C6199F6AF1A2-htm.html|website = knowledge.autodesk.com|access-date = 2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Machines for fabrication==
Three machine are popular for fabrication:

1. [[CNC Router]]

2. [[Laser cutter]]

3. [[3D Printer]]

===CNC Router===
CNC stands for Computer Numerical Control. CNC mills or routers include proprietary software which interprets 2D vector drawings or 3D models and converts this information to a [[G-code]], which represents specific CNC functions in alphanumeric format which the CNC mill can interpret. The G-codes drive a [[machine tool]], a powered [[Machine|mechanical device]] typically used to fabricate components.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Five CNC Myths and Misconceptions {{!}} Modern Machine Shop|url = http://www.mmsonline.com/columns/five-cnc-myths-and-misconceptions|website = www.mmsonline.com|access-date = 2016-02-17|first = Mike|last = Lynch}}&lt;/ref&gt;  CNC machines are classified according to the number of axes that they possess, with 3, 4 and 5 axis machines all being common, and industrial robots being described with having as many as 9 axes. CNC machines are specifically successful in milling materials such as [[plywood]], [[plastics]], [[foam board]], and metal at a fast speed. CNC machine beds are typically large enough to allow 4' × 8' (123&amp;nbsp;cm x 246&amp;nbsp;cm) sheets of material, including foam several inches thick, to be cut.

===Laser cutter===
The laser cutter is a machine that uses a laser to cut materials such as chip board, matte board, felt, wood, and acrylic up to 3/8 inch (1&amp;nbsp;cm) thickness. The laser cutter is often bundled with a driver software which interprets vector drawings produced by any number of CAD software platforms.

The laser cutter is able to modulate the speed of the laser head, as well as the intensity and resolution of the laser beam, and as such is able in both to cut and to score material, as well as approximate raster graphics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Automated Laser Cutting {{!}} Precision Metal Industries|url = http://www.pmiquality.com/services/automated-laser-cutting|website = www.pmiquality.com|access-date = 2016-02-17|first = Precision Metal|last = Industries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Objects cut out of materials can be used in the fabrication of physical models, which will only require the assembly of the flat parts.

===3D printers===
[[3D printer]]s use a variety of methods and technology to assemble physical versions of digital objects. Typically desktop 3D printers can make small plastic 3D objects. They use a roll of thin plastic filament, melting the plastic and then depositing it precisely to cool and harden. They normally build 3D objects from bottom to top in a series of many very thin plastic horizontal layers. This process often happens over the course of a several hours. 
===Fused deposition modeling===
Fused deposition modeling, also known as fused filament fabrication, uses a 3-axis robotic system that extrudes material, typically a thermoplastic, one thin layer at a time and progressively builds up a shape. Examples of machines that use this method are the Dimension 768 and the Ultimaker.
===Stereolithography===
Stereolithography uses a high intensity light projector, usually using DLP technology, with a [[photosensitive polymer resin]]. It will project the profile of an object to build a single layer, curing the resin into a solid shape. Then the printer will move the object out of the way by a small amount and project the profile of the next layer. Examples of devices that use this method are the Form-One printer and Os-RC Illios.

===Selective laser sintering===
Selective laser sintering uses a laser to trace out the shape of an object in a bed of finely powdered material that can be fused together by application of heat from the laser. After one layer has been traced by a laser, the bed and partially finished part is moved out of the way, a thin layer of the powdered material is spread, and the process is repeated. Typical materials used are alumide, steel, glass, thermoplastics (especially nylon), and certain ceramics. Example devices include the Formiga P 110 and the Eos EosINT P730.
===Powder printer===
Powder printers work in a similar manner to SLS machines, and typically use powders that can be cured, hardened, or otherwise made solid by the application of a liquid binder that is delivered via an inkjet printhead. Common materials are plaster of paris, clay, powdered sugar, wood-filler bonding putty, and flour, which are typically cured with water, alcohol, vinegar, or some combination thereof. The major advantage of powder and SLS machines is their ability to continuously support all parts of their objects throughout the printing process with unprinted powder. This permits the production of geometries not easily otherwise created. However, these printers are often more complex and expensive. Examples of printers using this method are the ZCorp Zprint 400 and 450.

The '''Eurocheque''' was a type of [[cheque]] used in [[Europe]] that was accepted across national borders and which could be written in a variety of currencies.

Eurocheques were originally introduced in 1969 as an alternative to the [[traveler's cheque]] and for international payments for goods and services. They were rapidly adopted for domestic use in a number of countries, to the extent that their use for international payment rarely accounted for more than 5% of total Eurocheque transactions.&lt;ref name="BAO" /&gt; The charges for [[Clearing (finance)|clearing]] Eurocheques were substantially lower than those for cross-border use of domestic cheques.&lt;ref name="eurlex1"&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52000DC0036:EN:NOT Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament — Retail payments in the internal market]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although still accepted as payment by a few bodies, the practice of issuing Eurocheques ceased on 1 January 2002, following the decision to withdraw the Eurocheque guarantee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maestro.ch/en/ma_home/ma_maestro/ma_eurocheques.htm eurocheques&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Eurocheques were particularly popular in [[German-speaking Europe|German-speaking]] countries, where they were often issued as standard domestic cheques. They usually had to be accompanied by a [[cheque guarantee card]] in order to be accepted in payment at a point of sale. The Eurocheque guarantee card also had the functionality of an [[ATM card]]. In some countries, such as [[Austria]] and [[Germany]], virtually all Eurocheque cards were co-branded with the logo of the respective domestic [[debit card]] system and were actually debit cards. After its phase-out, virtually all of these Eurocheque cards were replaced by [[Maestro card]]s. Therefore, Maestro is very often considered to be the successor to the Eurocheque system.

The decision to end the issuing of Eurocheques was taken because increasing numbers of retailers and banks started to decline payment by Eurocheque and because the use of [[automated teller machine|cash machines]] and [[credit cards]] by international travellers grew within Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/cash-dispensers-spell-the-demise-of-eurocheques-next-year-1127976.html Cash dispensers spell the demise of Eurocheques next year], [[The Independent]], Nov 22, 1999, Andrew Garfield&lt;/ref&gt; The relatively high cost of processing Eurocheques, together with the costs resulting from [[fraud]], were also among the factors.&lt;ref name="BAO" /&gt; In advance of the move, the [[European Commission]] expressed concern that "the benefits of the existing eurocheque system, in particular its standardised cheque format and its clearing facilities in all European countries should not be lost."&lt;ref name="eurlex1" /&gt;

==History==

The Eurocheque was launched in 1969 with the participation of banks in 14 countries: [[Belgium]], [[France]], [[United Kingdom]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]] and [[West Germany]] (which issued and accepted Eurocheques) together with [[Denmark]], [[Italy]], [[Ireland]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Norway]], [[Spain]] and [[Sweden]] (which accepted Eurocheques).

In 1972, the 'uniform Eurocheque' and 'uniform Eurocheque guarantee card' were introduced, providing single designs that could be used by all banks within the system. Previously all Eurocheques had carried the Eurocheque symbol, but differed in their designs.&lt;ref name="BAO" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ema.com.ua/ema/epi4.nsf/VIEWNAME/AD039FCCF453C6C5C2256B9E0046B8E9/$FILE/Plastic%20payment%20fraud%20in%20Europe.rtf Plastic payment fraud in Europe], Rafaël Rondelez&lt;/ref&gt;

Eurocheque International C.V. was formed in 1974 to process payments made using Eurocheques.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.servired.es/ingles/evolucion.htm ServiRed Payments Network — Evolution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031072024/http://www.servired.es/ingles/evolucion.htm |date=2007-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, British banks withdrew the Eurocheque symbol from their credit cards.&lt;ref name="BAO" /&gt;

On 3 February 1988, Eurocheque International became a [[cooperative society]] established under Belgian law, having previously been a ''de facto'' association, rather than a legal entity. The shareholders were the Association of Swedish Banks, [[Associazione Bancaria Italiana]], Groupement des cartes bancaires 'CB' (France), Comunidade Portuguesa eurocheque, Bank of Cyprus, Caisse d'épargne de l'État du grand-duché de Luxembourg, Agrupació Andorrana Eurocheque, PBS-Pengeinstitutternes BetalingsSystemer (Denmark), Apacs (United Kingdom), Telekurs (Switzerland), Suomen Pankkiyhdistys (Finland), Association of Norwegian Banks, Stichting Bevordering Chequeverkeer (Netherlands), Irish Clearing House, Jugobanka United Bank (Yugoslavia), Association of Austrian Banks and Bankers, Eurocheque Belgique sc, GZS-Gesellschaft für Zahlungssysteme GmbH (Germany).&lt;ref name="31992D0212"&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31992D0212:EN:NOT 92/212/EEC: Commission Decision of 25 March 1992 relating to a proceeding pursuant to Article 85 of the EEC Treaty (IV/30.717-A - Eurocheque: Helsinki Agreement)], Official Journal L 095, 09/04/1992 pp. 0050–0067&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an estimate by Eurocheque International, in 1989 around 32 million Eurocheque cards had been issued by some 9,000 banks in 20 countries.&lt;ref name="31989D0095"&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31989D0095:EN:NOT 89/95/EEC: Commission Decision of 19 December 1988 relating to a proceeding under Article 85 of the EEC Treaty], Official Journal L 036, 08/02/1989 pp. 0016–0022&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 1998 there were 46 participating countries, 22 of them both issuing and accepting the cheques:&lt;ref name="BAO"&gt;[http://www.banking-accounts.org/eurocheque/p2.htm Development of eurocheque countries, eurocheque maps and transnational eurocheques], Banking-accounts.org, June 23, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Finland, France, United Kingdom, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Croatia, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Switzerland, Slovenia, Spain, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Cyprus, and 24 accepting cheques: Egypt, Albania, Algeria, Andorra, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Georgia, Gibraltar, Greece, Iceland, Lebanon, Lithuania, Latvia, Morocco, Macedonia, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Tunisia, Turkey, Ukraine, Belarus.

In 1989, French banks withdrew the Eurocheque symbol from their credit cards. In the same year, the use of the Uniform Eurocheque format became universal.&lt;ref name="BAO" /&gt;

On 1 September 1992, Eurocheque International C.V. and Eurocheque International Holding N.V. merged with [[Eurocard (payment card)|Eurocard International N.V.]] into a single company, [[Europay International|Europay International S.A.]], incorporated under Belgian law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52002XC0413(02):EN:NOT Europay Membership Rules and Licensing], Euro-Lex: Official Journal C 089 , 13/04/2002 pp. 0007–0010&lt;/ref&gt; Europay relocated to [[Waterloo, Belgium]], where they shared the same address as the [[Europe, the Middle East and Africa|Europe, Middle East and Africa]] region of [[MasterCard|MasterCard International]], and the headquarters of the Eurocard-MasterCard joint-venture, [[Maestro International]].

The decision to end the Eurocheque guarantee from the end of 2002 was taken by Europay's board on 22 April 2001.&lt;ref name="BAO" /&gt;

'''Field propulsion''' is the concept of [[spacecraft propulsion]] where no [[propellant]] is necessary but instead [[momentum]] of the [[spacecraft]] is changed by an interaction of the spacecraft with external [[Field (physics)|force fields]], such as gravitational and magnetic fields from stars and planets. It is purely [[fringe science|speculative]] and has not yet been demonstrated to be of practical use or theoretically valid.

== Types ==

===Practical methods===

Although not presently in wide use for space, there exist proven terrestrial examples of "Field Propulsion", in which electromagnetic fields act upon a conducting medium such as seawater or plasma for propulsion, is known as [[magnetohydrodynamics]] or MHD.  MHD is similar in operation to electric motors, however rather than using moving parts or metal conductors, fluid or plasma conductors are employed.  The EMS-1 and more recently the [[Yamato 1]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ovaltech.ca/pdfss/mhddesign.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; are examples of such electromagnetic Field propulsion systems, first proposed in patent {{Cite patent|US|5333444}}.&lt;ref&gt;Meng, J.C.S. (1994). U.S. Patent No. 5333444. Washington DC: US Patent and Trademark Office.&lt;/ref&gt; There is definitely potential to apply MHD to the space environment and experiments such as the NASA's [[electrodynamic tether]], Lorentz Actuated Orbits,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ovaltech.ca/pdfss/Lorentz_Actuated_Orbits_1385Peck.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Wingless Electromagnetic Air Vehicle|wingless electromagnetic air vehicle]], and [[magnetoplasmadynamic thruster]] (which does use propellant) lay a solid foundation for using "fields" to propel spacecraft without propellant and standard concepts of chemical thrust.  Since electrodynamics is well proven science, electromagnetic fields themselves carry momentum (see the [[Nichols radiometer]]), and electromagnetic field propulsion is not limited to the ejection velocity of particle propellants, these new concepts offer tremendous potential as a future space propulsion system.  They represent a radical departure from current ideas of aeronautics and rocket propulsion, and as such are controversial, but field propulsion may offer the radical breakthroughs in performance capabilities required for deep space exploration.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}  The main limiting factors appear to the generation of the significant amounts of electrical power required and a method of strongly coupling the fields to large volumes.{{original research inline|date=January 2017}}

[[Electrohydrodynamics]] is another method whereby electrically charged fluids are used for propulsion and boundary layer control such as [[ion propulsion]]{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Other practical methods which could be loosely considered as field propulsion include: The [[gravity assist]] trajectory, which uses planetary [[gravity]] fields and orbital momentum; [[Solar sails]] and [[magnetic sails]] use respectively the [[radiation pressure]] and [[solar wind]] for spacecraft thrust; [[Aerobraking]] uses the atmosphere of a planet to change relative velocity of a spacecraft. The last two actually involve the exchange of momentum with physical particles and are not usually expressed as an interaction with fields, but they are sometimes included as examples of field propulsion since no spacecraft propellant is required.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

===Speculative methods===
Other concepts that have been proposed are speculative, using "frontier physics" and concepts from [[modern physics]]. So far none of these methods have been unambiguously demonstrated, much less proven practical.

The [[Woodward effect]] is based on a controversial concept of [[inertia]] and certain solutions to the equations for [[General Relativity]]. Experiments attempting to conclusively demonstrate this effect have been conducted since the 1990s.

Although speculative, ideas such as coupling to the momentum flux of the zero-point electromagnetic wave field hypothesized in [[stochastic electrodynamics]] have a plausible basis for further investigation within the existing theoretical physics paradigm.

In contrast, examples of proposals for field propulsion that rely on physics outside the present paradigms are various schemes for [[faster-than-light]], [[warp drive]] and [[antigravity]], and often amount to little more than catchy descriptive phrases, with no known physical basis{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}.  Until it is shown that the conservation of energy and momentum break down under certain conditions (or scales), any such schemes worthy of discussion must rely on energy and momentum transfer to the spacecraft from some external source such as a local force field, which in turn must obtain it from still other momentum and/or energy sources in the cosmos (in order to satisfy conservation of both energy and momentum).{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;!-- In fact electromagnetic fields themselves carry momentum --&gt;

&lt;!-- 
In the [[Standard Model]], force carriers include [[electromagnetism]], [[weak interaction|weak force]], and [[strong interaction|strong force]]. Electroweakhydrodynamics has the potential for propulsion systems. The [[strong force|strong interaction]] is dependent on the [[gluon]] of which there are eight types. These eight variations may prove difficult and challenging for a field propulsion system. In the future, the Higgs particle also be a candidate for high energy propulsion.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Just beyond the Standard Model but within mainstream science (which does not include gravity) are the gravitational field which does behave like a fluid. The [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/airplane/eulereqs.html |title=Euler Equations |publisher=Grc.nasa.gov |date=2010-07-29 |accessdate=2014-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
can be extended to include gravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astro.uu.se/~bf/course/numhd_course/1_3_2Hydrodynamics_equation.html |title=1.3.2 Hydrodynamics equations including gravity |publisher=Astro.uu.se |date=2002-02-01 |accessdate=2014-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see Misner Thorne and Wheeler: ''Gravitation''). Einstein's [[General relativity]] provide the basis for gravity and inertia. --&gt;

===Field propulsion based on physical structure of space===

This concept is based on the general relativity theory and the [[Quantum Field Theory|quantum field theory]] from which the idea that space has a physical structure can be proposed. The macroscopic structure is described by the general relativity theory and the microscopic structure by the quantum field theory.
The idea is to deform space around the space craft. By deforming the space it would be possible to create a region with higher pressure behind the space craft than before it. Due to the [[Pressure-gradient force|pressure gradient]] a force would be exerted on the space craft which in turn creates thrust for propulsion.&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{cite book|last1=Musha|first1=Takaaki|title=Field Propulsion System for Space Travel: Physics of Non-Conventional Propulsion Methods for Interstellar Travel|publisher=Bentham Books|isbn=978-1-60805-566-1|pages=20–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the purely theoretical nature of this propulsion concept it is hard to determine the amount of thrust and the maximum velocity that could be achieved. Currently there are two different concepts for such a field propulsion system one that is purely based on the general relativity theory and one based on the quantum field theory.&lt;ref name=ref1&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Minami|first1=Yoshinari|last2=Musha|first2=Takaaki|title=Field propulsion systems for space travel|journal=Acta Astronautica|date=February 2013|volume=82|issue=2|pages=215–20|doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2012.02.027|bibcode = 2013AcAau..82..215M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the '''general relativistic field propulsion system''' space is considered to be an elastic field similar to rubber which means that space itself can be treated as an infinite elastic body. If the [[space-time]] curves, a normal inwards surface stress is generated which serves as a pressure field. By creating a great number of those curve surfaces behind the space craft it is possible to achieve a unidirectional surface force which can be use for the acceleration of the space craft.&lt;ref name=ref1 /&gt;

For the '''quantum field theoretical propulsion system''' it is assumed, as stated by the quantum field theory and [[quantum Electrodynamics]], that the [[quantum vacuum]] consists out of a zero-radiating electromagnetic field in a non-radiating mode and at a [[zero-point energy|zero-point energy state]], the lowest possible energy state. It is also theorized that matter is composed out of elementary primary charged entities, [[Parton (particle physics)|parton]]s, which are bound together as elementary oscillators. By applying an electromagnetic zero point field a [[Lorentz force]] is applied on the partons. Using this on a [[dielectric]] material could effect the inertia of the mass and that way create an acceleration of the material without creating stress or strain inside the material.&lt;ref name=ref1 /&gt;

===Conservation Laws===
Conservation of momentum is a fundamental requirement of propulsion systems because in experiments momentum is always conserved,&lt;ref&gt;Ho-Kim, Quang; Kumar, Narendra; Lam, Harry C. S. (2004). Invitation to Contemporary Physics (illustrated ed.). World Scientific. p. 19. {{ISBN|978-981-238-303-7}}. Extract of page 19&lt;/ref&gt; and is implicit in published work of  Newton and Galileo. In each of the propulsion technologies, some form of energy exchange is required with momentum directed backward at light speed c or some lesser velocity v to balance the forward change of momentum. In absence of interaction with an external field, the power P that is required to create a thrust force F is given.

F = P/v when mass is ejected  or  F=P/c if mass free energy is ejected.

For a photon rocket the efficiency is too small to be competitive.&lt;ref&gt;There will be no photon rocket, by V. Smilga http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/611872.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Other technologies may have better efficiency if the ejection velocity is less than light speed, or a local field can interact with another large scale field of the same type residing in space, which is the intent of field effect propulsion.

===Advantages===
The main advantage of a field propulsion systems is that no propellant is needed, only an energy source. This means that no propellant has to be stored and transported with the space craft which makes it attractive for long term [[interplanetary spaceflight|interplanetary]] or even [[interstellar travel|interstellar]] [[Human spaceflight|manned missions]].&lt;ref name=ref1 /&gt; With current technology a large amount of fuel meant for the way back has to be brought to the destination which increases the [[payload]] of the overall space craft significantly.  The increased payload of fuel, thus requires more force to accelerate it, requiring even more fuel which is the primary drawback of current rocket technology.  Approximately 83% of a Hydrogen-Oxygen powered rocket, which can achieve orbit, is fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pettit|first1=Don|title=The Tyranny of the Rocket Equation|url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/expedition30/tryanny.html|website=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Transaction at a Farmers' Market.JPG|thumb|Financial transaction involving [[money]] and agricultural [[good (economics)|goods]] at a [[farmers' market]]]]

A '''financial transaction''' is an [[Contract|agreement]], or [[communication]], carried out between a [[buyer]] and a [[seller]] to [[Trade|exchange]] an [[asset]] for [[payment]].

It involves a change in the status of the finances of two or more businesses or individuals. The buyer and seller are separate entities or objects, often involving the exchange of items of value, such as [[information]], [[good (economics)|goods]], [[service (economics)|services]], and money. It is still a transaction if the goods are exchanged at one time, and the money at another. This is known as a two-part transaction: part one is giving the money, part two is receiving the goods.

==History==
{{Main|History of money}}
In ancient times non-financial transactions were commonly conducted through systems of credit, in which goods and services were exchanged for a promise of future recompense.  Credit has certain disadvantages, including the requirement that traders or their intermediaries trust one another, or trust that authorities exist who can be relied on to enforce agreements.  Debts must eventually be settled either with goods or by payment of [[money]], a substance of agreed value such as [[gold]] and [[silver]].

Systems of credit are evident throughout recorded history and from archeology.  By contrast little evidence has been found of widespread use of pure [[barter]], where traders meet face to face and transactions are completed in a single swap.

As cities, states, and empires were established, [[coin]]s and other compact forms of [[Coin|specie]] were minted or printed as [[fiat money]] with set values, permitting the accumulation of assets that would not deteriorate over time as goods might and that had the relatively secure backing of a government which could adjust value by producing more or less of the [[currency]]. As [[fixed exchange-rate system|fixed currencies]] were gradually replaced by [[floating exchange rate|floating currencies]] during the 20th century, and as the recent development of [[computer network]]s made [[electronic money]] possible, financial transactions have rapidly increased in speed and complexity.

==Present situation==
{{Expand section|date=October 2010}}
In 1997, {{formatnum:1.3}} billion US dollars were exchanged per day on the [[foreign exchange market]], roughly {{formatnum:475}} billion US dollars annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [[Jean de Maillard]], ''Un monde sans loi : La criminalité financière en images'', 1999, Éditions Stock, {{ISBN|2-234-04827-3}}, page 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The world financial transactions have jumped from {{formatnum:1.1}} quadrillion US dollars in 2002 to {{formatnum:2.2}} quadrillion US dollars in 2008. 95% of this is [[speculation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://leweb2zero.tv/video/rikiai_264b01e8cbe439d File "L'Ogre de la Finance" published in Revue québécoise Relations, June 2009, linked at] [http://www.assnat.qc.ca/fra/39Legislature1/DocumentsDeposesCommissions/CFP/CFP-49_2009_05_27_11_38.pdf assnat.qc.ca]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Purchasing}}
This is the most common type of financial transaction.  An item or goods are exchanged for [[money]]. This transaction results in a decrease in the finances of the purchaser and an increase in the benefits of the sellers.

===Loan===
{{Main|Loan}}
This is a slightly more complicated transaction than others in which the lender gives a single large amount of money to the borrower now in return for many smaller repayments of the borrower to the lender over time, usually on a fixed schedule. The smaller delayed repayments usually add up to more than the first large amount. The difference in payments is called interest. Here, money is given for not any specific reason.

===Mortgage===
{{Main|Mortgage}}
This is a combined loan and purchase in which a lender gives a large amount of money to a borrower for the specific purpose of purchasing a very expensive item (most often a house). As part of the transaction, the borrower usually agrees to give the item (or some other high value item) to the lender if the loan is not paid back on time. This guarantee of repayment is known as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]].

=== Bank account ===
{{Main|Bank account}}
A [[bank]] is a business that is based almost entirely on financial transactions. In addition to acting as a lender for loans and mortgages, banks act as a borrower in a special type of loan called an account. The lender is known as a customer and gives unspecified amounts of money to the bank for unspecified amounts of time. The bank agrees to repay any amount in the account at any time and will pay small amounts of interest on the amount of money that the customer leaves in the account for a certain period of time. In addition, the bank guarantees that the money will not be stolen while it is in the account and will reimburse the customer if it is. In return, the bank gets to use the money for other financial transactions as long as they hold it.

===Credit card===
{{Main|Credit card}}
This is a special combination of a purchase and a loan. The seller gives the buyer the  good or item as normal, but the buyer pays the seller using a [[credit card]]. In this way, the buyer is paying with a loan from the credit card company, usually a bank. The bank or other [[financial institution]] issues credit cards to buyers that allow any number of loans up to a certain cumulative amount. Repayment terms for credit card loans, or [[debt]]s vary, but the interest is often [[usury|extremely high]]. An example of common repayment terms would be a minimum payment of the greater of $10 or 3% every month and a 15–20% interest charge for any unpaid loan amount. In addition to interest, buyers are sometimes charged a yearly fee to use the credit card.

In order to collect the money for their item, the seller must apply to the credit card company with a signed [[receipt]]. Sellers usually apply for many payments at regular intervals. The seller is also charged a fee of normally 1–3% of the purchase price by the credit card company for the privilege of accepting that brand of credit card for purchases.

Thus, in a credit card purchase, the transfer of the item is immediate, but all payments are delayed. The credit card holder receives a monthly account of all transactions. The billing delay may be long enough to defer a purchase payment to the bill after the next one.

===Debit card===
{{Main|Debit card}}
This is a special type of purchase. The item or good is transferred as normal, but the purchaser uses a debit card instead of money to pay. A debit card contains an electronic record of the purchaser's account with a bank. Using this card, the seller is able to send an electronic signal to the buyer's bank for the amount of the purchase, and that amount of money is simultaneously [[debit]]ed from the customer's account and credited to the account of the seller. This is possible even if the buyer or seller use different financial institutions. Currently, fees to both the buyer and seller for the use of debit cards are fairly low because the banks want to encourage the use of debit cards. The seller must have a card reader set up in order for such purchases to be made. Debit cards allow a buyer to have access to all the funds in his account without having to carry the money around. It is more difficult to steal such funds than cash, but it is still done. See also [[skimming (credit card fraud)|skimming]] and [[Shoulder surfing (computer security)|shoulder surfing]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11805">[[File:Toilet paper in Hotel Monasterio.jpg|thumb|Folded and sealed toilet paper with cover, [[Hotel Monasterio]] 2009]]
'''Hotel toilet paper folding''' is a common practice performed by [[hotel]]s worldwide as a way of assuring guests that the bathroom has been cleaned.&lt;ref name=imponderables&gt;Feldman, David, ''When Do Fish Sleep? and other Imponderables of Everyday Life'', p. 4, "Why Do Many Hotels and Motels Fold Over the Last Piece of Toilet Paper in the Bathroom?" New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

The common fold normally involves creating a triangle or "V" shape out of the first sheet or square on a [[toilet paper]] roll. Commonly, the two corners of the final sheet are tucked behind the paper symmetrically, forming a point at the end of the roll. More elaborate folding results in shapes like fans, sailboats, and even flowers.

Toilet paper folding (also known as "toilet paper [[origami]]" or "toilegami") has attracted the attention of observers within the hotel industry and beyond it, involving both sober discussion of the practice as a marketing move as well as wry commentary{{Clarify|date=March 2012}} with various degrees of seriousness. The practice has been considered an emblematic example of a [[meme]] copied across the world from a hotel to another until the point that most of them now do it.&lt;ref name=meme&gt;Randerson, James, science correspondent, [https://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2006/feb/22/thememeingof "The meme-ing of life"], blog post, February 22, 2006, "News Blog", ''[[The Guardian]]'', retrieved March 31, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extent==
The practice is followed by hotels all over the world, according to Stephen Gill, a British photographer who published a book of pictures of folded hotel toilet paper from various nations.&lt;ref name=guksg&gt;Barnett, Laura, [https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2007/sep/26/arts.g2 "The loo roll that says I love you: Stephen Gill explains why he spent three years taking pictures of hotel toilet paper"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', September 26, 2007, retrieved March 31, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. [[Susan Blackmore]], who uses the example of hotel toilet paper folding to illustrate the use of [[memes]], pointed out in the 2006 [[Darwin Day]] Lecture before the [[British Humanist Association]] that even a remote guesthouse she visited in rural [[Assam]] in India folded the first sheet on its rolls of toilet paper.&lt;ref name=meme/&gt;

Hotel toilet paper folding is such an institution that in the horror movie ''[[1408 (film)|1408]]'' it is used as one of the eerie happenings noticed by the main character—after using the toilet paper, he finds it mysteriously has been freshly folded over.&lt;ref&gt;Salles, Steve, movie critic, "Roaches, bedbugs the least of your worries in '1408'", movie review, ''Standard-Examiner'', Ogden, Utah, June 22, 2007, retrieved via [[NewsBank.com]], March 31, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons==

The practice is meant to assure customers that their hotel room has been cleaned, according to [[David Feldman (author)|David Feldman]], in his "[[Imponderables (book series)|Imponderables]]" syndicated newspaper column. Feldman reported that he had contacted many of the country's largest innkeeper chains to ask why the toilet paper was folded, and all of them provided the same answer. He quoted James P. McCauley, executive director of the International Association of [[Holiday Inn]]s: &lt;ref name=imponderables/&gt;
{{Cquote|Hotels want to give their guests the confidence that the bathroom has been cleaned since the last guest has used the room. To accomplish this, the maid will fold over the last piece of toilet paper to assure that no one has used the toilet paper since the room was cleaned. It is subtle but effective.}}

Stephen Gill believes the practice is meant to please or impress customers: &lt;ref name=guksg/&gt;
{{Cquote|But the neatly made bed, the folded toilet paper—all these things symbolise attention and love. Perhaps such finishing touches are also an attempt to suggest flawlessness or excellence, and so distract you from whatever failings the room may have. They create a moment of stillness}}

==Other uses==

===Variations===
[[File:Toilet paper with folding.jpg|thumb|Toilet paper with folding]]
[[File:TP Fan s.jpg|thumb|Toilegami]]
"Toilet paper origami" (also called "toilegami") is a variation that involves folding toilet paper in elaborate shapes.&lt;ref name=orc&gt;[http://www.origami-resource-center.com/toilet-paper-origami.html "Toilet Paper Origami"], Origami Resource Center web page, retrieved March 31, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Gill found differences in the style and care of folding between hotels. One example from Tokyo, "with its tiny pleats, really stands out", according to the photographer. "Only in Japan did I find such minute attention to detail. [...] The New York City [example], on the other hand, is very poor quality, asymmetrical on rough, thin paper. And the Romania [example] is a great slab with a small, right-hand fold."&lt;ref name=guksg/&gt;

According to one hotel industry website, "Housekeepers at luxe lairs around the world are neatly folding the loose end of a partially used roll of toilet paper into a neat little bow or fan." Some hotels provide more elaborate flourishes: some apply a sticker attaching the folded end to the roll; others wrap spare rolls with a ribbon; Thompson Hotels imprint their logo on the first square.&lt;ref name=aiohc&gt;[http://www.hotelchatter.com/story/2008/10/8/11837/0293/hotels/Adventures_in_Overservice_The_Art_of_Toilet_Paper_Origami_ "Adventures in Overservice: The Art of Toilet Paper Origami"], October 9, 2008, Hotel Chatter website, retrieved March 31, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The Eldorado Hotel in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], also imprints its name and logo on the ends of its toilet paper&amp;nbsp;— a practice done by supervisors checking the work of the housekeepers.&lt;ref&gt;Barber, Christine, "Working Girl: Welcome to Hotel Eldorado", ''The Santa Fe New Mexican'', August 21, 2005, retrieved via [[Newsbank.com]], March 31, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of a $1 billion renovation of the [[Fontainebleau Hotel]] in [[Miami Beach, Florida]], in 2006, the typical triangular fold practice was stopped as one of a number of changes in order to give customers an impression that the hotel was special.&lt;ref name=mh&gt;Hanks, Douglas, "Details are key in Fontainebleau makeover", ''[[The Miami Herald]]'', July 9, 2008, retrieved via [[Newsbank.com]] on March 31, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; "We're not going to do the little pointy thing," rooms division chief Charlotte Rosenau told the ''[[Miami Herald]]''. "Every hotel does that." The change in toilet paper policy was made after Rosenau and several housekeepers crowded into a bathroom to experiment with different methods. They settled on "folding the first square in half, then resting the crease midway down the roll", according to the newspaper. "It just looks nice and clean," Rosenau explained.&lt;ref name=mh/&gt;

The Tickle Pink Inn, a hotel in [[Carmel Highlands, California]], folds the ends of its toilet paper into fan-like designs, mirroring the folds of its bathroom washcloths. A review in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' noted the practice as "a fancy touch".&lt;ref&gt;Owden, Shirley-Anne, "Romantic Highlands hideaway", ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', February 28, 2008, retrieved via [[Newsbank.com]] on March 31, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

One travel writer noted seeing toilet paper folded into flowers and sailboats at hotels in Costa Rica.&lt;ref&gt;"Costa Rica vacation fabulous", ''The News-Times'', Danbury, Connecticut, March 5, 2006 ("In San Jose and Punta Leona, the paper ends were folded into either ornate little flowers or tiny sailboats."), retrieved March 31, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usage beyond hotels===

An automated toilet paper folding machine called ''Meruboa'' was invented in Japan. With the push of a lever the device folds the first sheet of toilet paper into a triangle.&lt;ref name=orc/&gt;

Elaborate wedding dresses have been made from folded toilet paper (also using glue).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cheap-chic-weddings.com/wedding-contest-2008.html "Cheap Chic Weddings 2008 Toilet Paper Wedding Dress Contest"] at Cheap Chic Weddings website, retrieved March 31, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Humor and opinions==
In a humorous opinion article at the Hotel Online website, Larry Mundy wrote in his "Room With a View" column: "In my experience, there are two basic types of hotels: those that have the housekeeper fold a cute little triangle into the unused end of the toilet paper, and those that don't. Call it silly, call it pointless, I call it a sure indicator of the service levels I can anticipate at the property." Mundy continued: "That tiny detail of carefully triangulated tissue tells me that someone cared, that another member of my own species was here, in this very room, within the past few hours and spared no effort to make the end of the roll both presentable and easier to grip in my time of need. I don't need to engage in frustrating roll-rotation exercises just to find the loose end. I don't need to contemplate the jagged tear-line from the last user's haste—in fact, it doesn't occur to me there was a 'last user' at all, because the roll looks neat and new."&lt;ref&gt;Mundy, Larry, [http://www.hotel-online.com/News/PR2006_3rd/Jul06_Mundy18.html "Bathroom Origami&amp;nbsp;— That Tiny Detail of Carefully Triangulated Toilet Paper"], Hotel-online.com, July 2006, retrieved March 31, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

British comedian [[John Cleese]], who played a hotelier in the television series ''[[Fawlty Towers]]'', has commented on the practice in a keynote address: "Why? What is it for? Is it proof that your house-maid has studied origami? ... If you're a [[Freemasonry|Mason]], are you supposed to fold it again into some sort of [[rhomboid]]?"&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Elicia, [http://www.theage.com.au/news/people/fawlty-finds-room-for-error/2006/10/13/1160246310144.html "Fawlty finds room for error"], ''[[The Age]]'', October 13, 2006, retrieved March 31, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

All the iCN products include address to address routing, [[Speech synthesis|spoken guidance instruction]]s and a 2-D display.

The 600 series do not have a battery, whereas the 300 and 500 series do.

Only the 500 series have a [[touch-screen]].

==Modding the iCN series==
The lack of regular software updates to the iCN 500 range inspired efforts to turn an obsolete single application [[personal navigation device]] into a multi functional [[Handheld PC]]. Once modded, an iCN is capable of running dozens of applications including Navman's main rivals in the GPS field: namely [[TomTom (company)|Tomtom Navigator v6]], [[Navigon]], Destinator, [[iGo (software)|iGo]] and Miomap.

Several methods exist for modding the iCN series, all of which involve simple software hacks.

Beyond running GPS alternatives such as Miomap 3.2, a modded iCN can run many PocketPC games.

For more information on modding the iCN series see the [http://navmanunlocked.forumwise.com/ navmanunlocked.forumwise.com] forum and [http://www.gpspassion.com/forumsen/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=35945&amp;whichpage=1 gpspassion.com]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4089">{{distinguish|Purging (gas)}}
In fire and explosion prevention engineering, '''inerting''' refers to the introduction of an [[inert gas|inert]] (non-combustible) gas into a closed system (e.g. a container or a process vessel) to make the atmosphere oxygen deficient and non-ignitable.&lt;ref name=nfpa69&gt;NFPA 69. Standard on Explosion Prevention Systems. National Fire Protection Association.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nfpa77&gt;NFPA 77. Recommended Practice on Static Electricity. National Fire Protection Association.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Inerting relies on the principle that a combustible (or flammable) gas is able to undergo combustion (explode) only if mixed with air in the right proportions. The [[flammability limits]] of the gas define those proportions, i.e. the ignitable range.  In combustion engineering terms, the admission of inert gas can be said to dilute the oxygen below the [[limiting oxygen concentration]].

Inerting differs from [[Purging (gas)|purging]].  Purging, by definition, ensures that an ignitable mixture ''never forms''.  Inerting makes an ignitable mixture safe by introduction of an inert gas.

==Certain inert gases are unsuitable for inerting==
Because the mixture by definition is ignitable before inerting commence, it is imperative that the inerting procedure does not introduce a potential source of ignition, or an explosion will occur.  

NFPA 77 states&lt;ref name=nfpa77/&gt; that carbon dioxide from high-pressure cylinders or fire extinguishers should never be used to inert a container or vessel.  The release of carbon dioxide may generate static electricity with enough energy to ignite the mixture, resulting in an explosion.&lt;ref name=biom&gt;
{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other unsafe processes that may generate static electricity include pneumatic transport of solids, a release of pressurized gas with solids, industrial vacuum cleaners and spray painting operations&lt;ref&gt;TRBS 2153. Vermeidung von Zündgefahren infolge elektrostatischer Aufladungen. [Prevention of electrostatic ignition sources.], Gemeinsame Minist. 15/16 (2009) 278&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
The term ''inerting'' is often loosely used for any application involving an [[inert gas]], not conforming  with the technical definitions in NFPA standards.  For example, marine tankers carrying low-flash products like [[crude oil]], [[naphtha]], or [[gasoline]] have inerting systems onboard.  During the voyage, the vapor pressure of these liquids is so high, that the atmosphere above the liquid (the headspace) is too rich to burn, the atmosphere is unignitable.  This may change during unloading.  When a certain volume of liquid is drawn from a tank, a similar volume of air will enter the  tank's headspace, potentially creating an ignitable atmosphere.  

The inerting systems use an [[inert gas generator]] to supply inert make-up gas instead of air.  This procedure is often referred to as ''inerting''. Technically, the procedure ensures that the atmosphere in the tank's headspace remains unignitable.  The gas mixture in the headspace is not ''inert'' per se, it's just unignitable.  Because of its content of flammable vapors, it will burn if mixed with air.  Only if enough inert gas is supplied as part of a ''[[purging (gas)|purge-out-of-service]]'' procedure, will it be unable to burn when mixed with air.

'''Ingenic Semiconductor''' is a Chinese [[Fabless manufacturing|fabless]] [[semiconductor industry|semiconductor]] company based in [[Beijing]], [[China]] founded in 2005. They purchased licenses for the [[MIPS architecture]] [[instruction set]]s in 2009 and design [[Central processing unit|CPU]]-[[microarchitecture]]s based on them. They also design [[system on a chip]] products including their CPUs and licensed [[semiconductor intellectual property]] blocks from third parties, such as [[Vivante Corporation]], commission the fabrication of [[integrated circuit]]s at [[semiconductor fabrication plant]]s and sell them.

== XBurst microarchitecture ==

The XBurst CPU microarchitecture is based upon the [[MIPS architecture#MIPS32 revision 1|MIPS32 revision 1]] respectively the [[MIPS architecture#MIPS32 revision 2|MIPS32 revision 2]] instruction set and implements an 8-stage pipeline. XBurst CPU technology consists of 2 parts:
* A [[Reduced instruction set computing|RISC]]/[[Single instruction, multiple data|SIMD]]/[[Digital signal processor|DSP]] hybrid instruction set architecture which enables the processor to have the capability of computation, signal processing and video processing. This includes the Media Extension Unit (MXU), a 32-bit SIMD extension. All JZ47xx series CPUs with Xburst uA support MXU, except for the JZ4730.&lt;ref name=jz4780&gt;{{cite web|title=JZ4780 Mobile Application Processor - Programming Manual|url=http://mipscreator.imgtec.com/CI20/hardware/soc/JZ4780_PM.pdf|publisher=Imagination Technologies|accessdate=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dingoonity&gt;{{cite web|title=Development:MXU|url=http://wiki.dingoonity.org/index.php?title=Development:MXU|website=Dingoonity Wiki|accessdate=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; MXU has its own register set, distinct from the general purpose MIPS registers. It consists of sixteen 32-bit data registers and a 32-bit control register.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ingenic SIMD/DSP Instruction Set|url=https://dmz-portal.mips.com/mw/images/5/51/JZ_SIMD_Instruction_Set.pdf|publisher=Ingenic Semiconductor Co. Ltd.|accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; CPUs which support MXU are used in [[MIPS Creator]] single-board computers. They are also present in various tablets, handheld game devices, and embedded devices.
* An innovative pipeline engine which consumes very little power while emitting instructions. The processor core (including L1 cache) consumes 100&amp;nbsp;mW at 1000&amp;nbsp;MHz at a 65&amp;nbsp;nm LP process.

== XBurst2 microarchitecture ==

Ingenic Semiconductor purchased a [[MIPS64]] instruction set license and designed a microarchitecture based on it: XBurst2.
XBurst2 is a dual-issue/dual-threaded CPU design. Its development "will basically be completed" in the first half of 2014 as announced at Summer 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.sina.com.tw/article/20130806/10326190.html XBurst2 SoC being developed]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:IMI Energy Solutions Bldg.jpg|alt=IMI Energy Solutions|thumb|236x236px|IMI Energy Solutions at Fremont, California, USA.]]
IMI started in August 8, 1980 as a joint venture between [[Ayala Corporation]] and Resins, Inc. With its headquarters in [[Muntinlupa]], they were just a workforce of around 100 employees with total fixed assets of US$3,700,290 and it is engaged in the assembly of [[Integrated circuit|integrated circuits]]. In 1982, it took a contract manufacturing with its hard disk drive sub-assembly operations and, in 1986, it started the assembly of automotive [[Hybrid integrated circuit|hybrid integrated circuits]]. 

In the year 1988, the company ventured into custom printed circuit board assembly and operations and in the next years, it offered standard [[printed circuit board assembly]] services with the acquisition of [[Surface Mounting Technology|automated surface mounting]] equipment, and eventually, full product assembly and [[flexible printed circuit board]] assembly operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.global-imi.com/sites/default/files/2017%20SEC%20Form%2017-A_Integrated%20Micro-Electronics%2C%20Inc..pdf|title=IMI Prospectus and Company Disclosures|last=|first=|date=|website=Integrated Micro-Electronics, Inc.|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company moved its manufacturing site in 1995 from Cupang, [[Muntinlupa]] to its present location at the Laguna Technopark. In 1998, IMI commenced in offering hardware and software design services, that transitions the company to a total [[Electronics manufacturing services|electronics manufacturing service]] provider. By 2001, IMI had three manufacturing sites in the [[Philippines]].

As of 2018, IMI has [https://www.global-imi.com/locations 19 manufacturing sites of +287,000m² with more than 16,700 employees across 8 countries]. From an [[Electronics manufacturing services|EMS]] company, it expanded its scope to include [[Electronics manufacturing services|EMS]] and [[Power module|Power Semiconductor Assembly]] and Test Services. IMI is also into prototyping, manufacturing, product test development, testing and order fulfillment.&lt;ref name="conquers"&gt;[http://www.mb.com.ph/imi-a-filipino-company-conquers-the-world-of-ems/ “A Filipino company conquers the world of EMS”], Manila Bulletin, September 8, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global Expansion===

The '''Integrated Ocean Drilling Program''' ('''IODP''') was an international marine research program. The program used heavy drilling equipment mounted aboard ships to monitor and sample sub-seafloor environments. With this research, the IODP documented environmental change, Earth processes and effects, the biosphere, solid earth cycles, and geodynamics.&lt;ref name="IODP Mission Page"&gt;[http://www.iodp.org/Mission/ IODP mission page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110507042541/http://www.iodp.org/Mission/ |date=2011-05-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program began a new 10-year phase with the [[International Ocean Discovery Program]], from the end of 2013.

== Scope ==
The Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) brought together scientists from different countries and scientific disciplines to conduct investigations of the Earth deep below the sea-floor. IODP gave scientists the opportunity to:

# recover geological records and rock samples
# investigate and document ocean- and climate-change through time
# explore the presence of primitive life below the seafloor
# verify remote, near-seafloor observatories
# gain understanding of how tectonic plates move and recycle themselves into the deep mantle

== Focus on Earth ==
IODP was conceived in 2003 as a 10-year Earth science and research program. IODP scientists were drawn from universities and institutes located all across its member countries. Two previous scientific ocean drilling programs, [[Deep Sea Drilling Project]] and [[Ocean Drilling Program]], generated abundant information about Earth’s dynamic nature including tectonic processes, ocean circulation, climate change, continental rifting, and ocean basin formation. With IODP, scientific ocean drilling continued to provide scientists with ''in-situ'' studies of critical processes related to Earth’s short-term change and long-term variability. IODP provided diverse drilling resources to meet specific requirements of each planned drilling project.

IODP focused on ocean basins to study the interdependent processes with particular emphases on factors controlling [[climate change]], the vast circulation of fluids within Earth’s crust, the nature of life on and within Earth, and the dynamics of tropospheric formation and recycling.

== Navigating the route to discovery ==
Scientific ocean drilling represented the longest running and most successful international collaboration among the Earth sciences. Scientific ocean drilling began in 1961 with the first sample of oceanic crust recovered aboard the ''CUSS 1'', a modified U.S. Navy barge. American author [[John Steinbeck]], also an amateur oceanographer, documented [[Project Mohole]] for [[Life (magazine)|LIFE Magazine]].

== Legacy programs ==
The [[Deep Sea Drilling Project]] (DSDP), established in June 1966, operated the ''[[Glomar Challenger]]'' in drilling and coring operations in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, as well as in the Mediterranean and Red Seas. The ''Challenger’s'' coring operations enabled DSDP to provide the next intellectual step in verifying the hypothesis of plate tectonics associated with seafloor spreading, by dating basal sediments on transects away from the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]].

In June 1970, the ''Challenger's'' DSDP engineers devised a way to replace worn drill bits and then re-enter boreholes for deeper drilling while in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of New York, in 10,000 feet (3,048 meters) of water. This required the use of sonar scanning equipment and a large-scale re-entry cone.

Process-oriented Earth studies continued from 1985 until 2003 aboard the ''[[JOIDES Resolution]]'', which replaced the ''Glomar Challenger'' in January 1985 as DSDP morphed into the [[Ocean Drilling Program]] (ODP). The ''JOIDES Resolution'' is named for the 200-year-old [[HMS Resolution (1771)|HMS ''Resolution'']] which explored the Pacific Ocean and Antarctica under the command of Captain [[James Cook]].

The Ocean Drilling Program contributed significantly to increased scientific understanding of Earth history, [[climate change]], [[plate tectonics]], natural resources, and geohazards. ODP discoveries included validation of:

== IODP funding agencies ==
National consortia and government funding agencies supported IODP science and drilling platform operations.
Participation in IODP was proportional to investment in the program.

=== Lead agencies ===
Two lead agencies formally established IODP. In April 2003, officials from Japan’s [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology]] (MEXT) and the U.S. [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) in which they agreed to form and jointly operate the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program. Japan’s interest in the post-ODP era was signified when “Ocean Drilling in the 21st Century” (OD21) was established in 1994. OD21 included plans for construction of a state-of-the-art, riser-equipped scientific drilling vessel capable of reaching Earth’s mantle. A series of international meetings explored how this goal could be integrated with other scientific objectives expressed by scientific communities in the United States, Europe, and the People’s Republic of China. An IODP office at NSF was responsible for administering commingled funds from NSF, MEXT, and other IODP members to support IODP science-operating costs.

=== Contributing member ===
The [[ECORD|European Consortium for Ocean Research Drilling]] (ECORD) was established in December 2003 with 13 European countries to represent the European contribution in IODP. The consortium grew into a collaborative group of 17 European nations (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and The United Kingdom) and Canada that together comprise an IODP-funding agency. Working alongside Japan and the United States, ECORD provided the IODP scientific community with access to mission-specific platforms, which chosen to fulfill specific scientific objectives. These platforms have limited space on board for labs and scientists, and require an onshore science meeting to describe, process, and analyze the sediment samples collected immediately following a drilling expedition.

=== Associate members ===
In April 2004, the People’s Republic of China joined IODP as an Associate Member through sponsorship of China’s [[Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Science and Technology]] (MOST). China’s participation in IODP has given the Chinese marine science community a new impetus and increased their opportunity for deep-sea research. Chinese scientists participated in research expeditions and represent China’s interests in the IODP Science Advisory Structure.

The Republic of Korea joined IODP as an Associate Member in June 2006 through the sponsorship of the Korea [[Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources]] (KIGAM). South Korea’s memorandum of understanding with the lead agencies created the Interim Asian Consortium.

[[Ministry of Earth Sciences]] (MoES), Government of India joined the IODP in 2008 as an Associate member. Since then, the National Centre for Antarctic and Ocean Research (NCAOR), Goa has been designated by India to look after all IODP related activities in India (IODP-India). In this direction, an international workshop on IODP drilling in Indian Ocean was organized in Goa during October 17–18, 2011. The workshop was co-hosted by IODP Management International and ANZIC.
 
Hundreds of international Earth and ocean scientists participated in IODP on a voluntary basis. Participation took many forms: submission of a drilling proposal; sailing on an expedition; participation in an advisory capacity; attendance at a planning workshop or topical symposium. The program’s central management office, IODP Management International, coordinated an integrated work plan between and among all IODP organizational partners. An annual program plan was written each fiscal year and included objectives and tasks necessary for drilling vessel operation, from science coordination to publications, data management, and outreach.

== Uniquely IODP ==
IODP distinguishes itself from its legacy programs by employing multiple drilling technologies/platforms and science/drilling operators to acquire sediment and rock samples and to install monitoring instrumentation beneath the seafloor. Samples and data collected during IODP drilling expeditions are available to scientists and teachers on an open-access basis, once members of the expedition parties have completed their initial studies.

== Planning IODP drilling: science advisory structure ==

=== Drilling proposal process ===
Drilling proposals originated with science proponents, often researchers in geology, geophysics, microbiology, paleontology, or seismology. Once submitted to IODP, the proposal was carefully evaluated by the Science Advisory Structure (SAS), a group of technical review panels. Only those proposals judged as the greatest value based on scientific and technical merit were scheduled for implementation.

SAS panels provided advice on drilling proposals to both proponents and IODP management. Drilling proposals were accepted twice a year, in April and October, and could be submitted to IODP electronically via their website.

=== The science plan ===
A ten-year program plan called the ''Initial Science Plan (ISP)'' guided IODP investigation. Specific scientific themes were emphasized in the ''ISP'': 
#investigation into the deep biosphere and subseafloor life;
#climate change;
#solid Earth cycles; and
#geodynamics

As described in the ISP, IODP sought to develop better understandings of:

* the earthquake-generating zone beneath convergent continental margins;
* the complex microbial ecosystem that exists beneath the seafloor;
* the nature of gas hydrates that lie beneath continental margins;
* climate history, extreme climates;
* rapid climate change;
* the role of continental break-up in sedimentary basin formation;
* the formation of volcanic rifted margins and oceanic plateaus through time; and
* drilling to [[Mantle of the earth|Earth’s mantle]] to examine and monitor a complete section of oceanic crust

Tools critical to these goals included a riser-equipped drilling vessel, a riserless vessel, additional platforms suited to mission specific expeditions, enhanced downhole measurement devices, and long-term monitoring instrumentation.

=== Engineering proposals ===
An engineering proposal submission process, initiated in April 2007, facilitated the acquisition of existing or latent technology to be used in IODP operations.

== Science and drilling operators ==
Drilling operations were conducted and managed by three IODP implementing organizations:

* United States Implementing Organization (USIO) carried out expeditions on the riserless drilling vessel ''[[JOIDES Resolution]]'';
* ECORD Science Operator (ESO) managed mission specific expeditions on various platforms;
* Center for Deep Earth Exploration (CDEX) managed operations aboard the riser-equipped drilling vessel ''[[Chikyu]]''.

Each drilling expedition was led by a pair of co-chief scientists, with a team of scientists supported by a staff scientist. Each implementing organization provided a combination of services: technical, operational, and financial management; logging; laboratory; core repository; data management; and publication. Although each implementing organization was responsible for its own platform operations and performance, its science operations was funded by the lead agencies.

The operators conducted the following expeditions during the IODP:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

== Drilling vessels and platforms ==
[[File:Joides resolution odp.jpg|thumb|right|''JOIDES Resolution'']]
IODP employed two dedicated drilling vessels, each sponsored by a lead agency and managed by their respective implementing organization:

=== ''JOIDES Resolution'' – riserless ===
{{main article|JOIDES Resolution}}
The U.S.-sponsored drilling vessel was operated throughout the Ocean Drilling Program and the first phase of IODP. The vessel then underwent a rebuild, allowing for increased laboratory space; improved drilling, coring, and sampling capacity; and enhanced health, safety, and environmental protection systems on board.&lt;ref&gt;Riserless drilling vessel JOIDES Resolution : http://www.iodp-usio.org/Publications/IODPbro2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Chikyu'' – riser-equipped ===
{{main article|Chikyu Hakken}}
[[File:Chikyu 2.jpg|thumb|right|''Chikyu'']]
Japan began building a state-of-the-art scientific drilling vessel for research in 2001 with the intent of reaching Earth’s mantle and drilling into an active seismogenic zone. The resulting drilling vessel, ''[[Chikyu]]'' (Japanese for "Planet Earth") features a riser drilling system, a dynamic positioning system, and a high-density mud circulation system to prevent borehole collapse during drilling, among other assets. ''Chikyu'' can berth 150 people, cruise at 12 knots, and drill more than 7,000 meters below the seafloor in water depths exceeding 2,000 meters. ''Chikyu'' was damaged during the tsunami of March 11, 2011, and was out-of-service for several months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.nature.com/news/thegreatbeyond/2011/03/japanese_research_ship_damaged.html Japanese Research Ship Damaged by Tsunami]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Chikyu'' returned to ocean drilling in April 2012.

=== Mission-specific platforms ===
ECORD commissioned ships on an expedition-by-expedition basis, depending on specific scientific requirements and environment. ECORD contracted the use of three icebreakers for the Arctic Coring Expedition (2004), drilling vessels diving for use in shallow Tahitian (2005) and Australian waters (2010), where scientists sampled fossil coral reefs to investigate the rise in global sea levels since the last ice age, and a liftboat for sampling the New Jersey Shallow Shelf (2009). Mission-specific expeditions required substantial flexibility.

== Extending IODP to the science community ==
Publications, data management, online tools, and databases are in development to support information- and resource-sharing, so as to expand the ranks of scientists who engage in ocean drilling investigations.

=== Publication and data management ===
IODP publications are freely available online and a data management system integrates core and laboratory data collected by all three implementing organizations and the two IODP legacy programs. A web-based search system will eventually aggregate post-expedition data and related publications. Requests for data and samples can be made online.

=== Site Survey Data Bank (SSDB) ===
A web-based Site Survey Data Bank enabled proponents to access and deposit the large amounts of data required to document potential drill sites for evaluation. This data was reviewed to assure IODP expeditions could meet their objectives and comply with safety and environmental requirements.

=== Core repositories ===
Three IODP core repositories located in [http://www.marum.de/en/IODP_Bremen_Core_Repository.html Bremen, Germany (IODP Bremen Core Repository)], [http://iodp.tamu.edu/curation/gcr/ College Station, Texas (IODP Gulf Coast Repository)], and Kochi, Japan, archive cores based on geographical origin. Scientists may visit any one of the facilities for onsite research or request a loan for analysis or for teaching purposes. Archived cores include not only IODP samples, but also those retrieved in the two IODP legacy programs (DSDP and ODP).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1363">'''"Louis period styles"''' is the collective name for five distinct styles of French architecture and interior design. The styles span the period from 1610 to 1793. 

==Five styles==
Each of the five styles is named for the ruler of the particular period. 

* [[Louis XIII style]] (1610–1643) (''Louis Treize''), the period is the early phase of [[French Baroque]]
* [[French Baroque and Classicism|Louis XIV style]] (1643–1715) (''Louis Quatorze'')
* [[Régence style]] (1715–1723), the style of the regency of [[Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|Philippe II, duc d’Orléans]]
* [[Louis XV style]] (1723–1774) (''Louis Quinze'')
* [[Louis XVI style]] (1774–1793) (''Louis Seize'')

==Applications==
The terms are applied as style terms for the French forms of:
*[[architecture]]
*[[interior design]] 
*[[fine art]]s 
*[[decorative arts]] 
*[[furniture]]
*[[crafts]]

==Biography==
 
Mark Robert Halper grew up in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], where he still resides.  He became interested in [[filmmaking]] in high school, an interest which would transform into still photography in college.  Halper graduated  
from the [[University of Southern California]] in 1987 with a degree in  
[[international relations]] and [[political science]]. A year later he began studying commercial photography at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] Extension, and started shooting professional assignments in 1989.  Halper moved to a downtown [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] [[studio apartment|studio]]/[[loft]] in early 1990 as his career continued to grow.

Early clients included the ''[[Los Angeles Daily Journal]]'', a newspaper for the legal community for whom Halper would continue to do work during the first seven years of his career. Moving to an expanded studio in 1995, Halper traveled much of the country on assignment for trade publications during the late 1990s.  Halper became widely known partly because of his web presence, which dates back to 1996 when he discovered the internet. After the [[dot-com bubble|technology crash]] in 2000 and the decline in trade magazine resources, his clientele switched primarily to corporate and advertising clients. In 2002 his business expanded and a new studio on the same property as his [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles, California|Silver Lake]] home was opened. Over the next several years he became active in [[architectural photography|architectural]] and [[still life photography]], in addition to his now well-established expertise in selling portraiture.

In September 2007 Halper was married to Jennifer Hunt, a visual  
effects compositor and lighter for feature films at [[Sony Pictures Imageworks|Sony Imageworks]].

Halper's featured television appearances include ''[[Starting Over (TV series)|Starting Over]]'', ''[[10 Years Younger (US)|10 Years Younger]]'', ''Fitness Fantasy'', and ''Designing Your Life''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://studiomark.com/news.html Studiomark.com News]  (Accessed on October 27, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fine-art photography==

In his first book project, ''Low Overhead'' (2004), Halper photographed models in a studio with limited headroom. Said Halper, "I wanted to see how people reacted in a space where they didn't have any real experience in how to comport themselves." The resulting lighthearted images were featured from August to October 2005 in the [[ArcLight Hollywood|Arclight Cinemas Gallery]] in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]], published as a mini-book, and released as an [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[Dashboard (Mac OS)|Dashboard]] [[GUI widget|widget]].&lt;ref name=rfm&gt;[http://www.rangefindermag.com/magazine/Sep05/halper.tml Jacobs, Jr, Lou. "Mark Robert Halper"]. ''Rangefinder Magazine''. September 2005 (Accessed on October 27, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Bed Project'' (2005–2006), Halper's subjects dressed as they normally would for bed and brought their own bedding to his studio, allowing Halper to get "a playfulness out of people they wouldn't normally show in front of a camera."

Halper says, "The key to my work is simplicity. I take out everything that isn’t absolutely necessary, until the only elements that remain are those that are entirely essential. The best photographs are usually the simplest."&lt;ref name=rfm/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17666">'''Natural oil polyols''', also known as NOPs or biopolyols, are [[polyol#Polyols in polymer chemistry|polyols]] derived from [[vegetable oils]] by several different techniques. The primary use for these materials is in the production of [[polyurethanes]]. Most NOPs qualify as [[biobased product]]s, as defined by the United States [[Secretary of Agriculture]] in the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002.

NOPs all have similar sources and applications, but the materials themselves can be quite different, depending on how they are made. All are clear liquids, ranging from colorless to medium yellow. Their [[viscosity]] is also variable and is usually a function of the [[molecular weight]] and the average number of [[hydroxyl]] groups per molecule (higher mw and higher hydroxyl content both giving higher viscosity.) Odor is a significant property which is different from NOP to NOP. Most NOPs are still quite similar chemically to their parent vegetable oils and as such are prone to becoming [[rancidification|rancid]]. This involves [[autoxidation]] of fatty acid chains containing carbon-carbon double bonds and ultimately the formation of odoriferous, low molecular weight [[aldehydes]], [[ketones]] and [[carboxylic acids]]. Odor is undesirable in the NOPs themselves, but more importantly, in the materials made from them.

There are a limited number of naturally occurring vegetable oils ([[triglycerides]]) which contain the unreacted hydroxyl groups that account for both the name and important reactivity of these polyols. [[Castor oil]] is the only commercially available natural oil polyol that is produced directly from a plant source: all other NOPs require chemical modification of the oils directly available from plants.

The hope is that using renewable resources as feedstocks for chemical processes will reduce the [[environmental footprint]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sperecycling.org/GPEC/GPEC2004/pdffiles/papers/037.pdf|title=Soy vs. Petro Polyols, A Life Cycle Comparison|author=J. Pollack|accessdate=2008-12-16}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; by reducing the demand on non-renewable [[fossil fuels]] currently used in the chemical industry and reduce the overall production of [[carbon dioxide]], the most notable [[greenhouse gas]]. One NOP producer, Cargill, estimates that its BiOH(TM)polyol manufacturing process produces 36% less [[global warming]] emissions (carbon dioxide), a 61% reduction in non-renewable energy use (burning fossil fuels), and a 23% reduction in the total energy demand, all relative to polyols produced from [[petrochemical]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.gupta-verlag.com/news/industry/4157/cargills-bioh-polyols-business-opens-manufacturing-site-brazil|title=Cargill’s BiOH polyols business opens manufacturing site Brazil|last=|first=|date=September 26, 2007|work=|accessdate=2017-11-21|publisher=Gupta Verlag|authorlink=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources of natural oil polyols==
Ninety percent of the fatty acids that make up [[castor oil]] is [[ricinoleic acid]], which has a [[hydroxyl]] group on C-12 and a carbon-carbon double bond. The structure below shows the major component of castor oil which is composed of the tri-ester of rincinoleic acid and [[glycerin]]:
[[Image:Castor oil.svg|150px|center|Major component of [[castor oil]]]]

Other vegetable oils - such as [[soy bean]] oil,&lt;ref name="garrett"&gt;{{cite conference|first=Thomas|last=Garrett|authorlink=|author2=Du, Xian Du|title=Polyols for Diverse Applications|url=http://honeybee.cc/Garrett_Du_2.pdf|accessdate=|id=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100928152555/http://honeybee.cc/Garrett_Du_2.pdf|archivedate=2010-09-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[peanut oil]], and [[canola oil]] - contain carbon-carbon double bonds, but no hydroxyl groups. There are several processes used to introduce hydroxyl groups onto the carbon chain of the fatty acids, and most of these involve [[redox|oxidation]] of the C-C double bond. Treatment of the vegetal oils with [[ozone]] cleaves the double bond, and esters or alcohols can be made, depending on the conditions used to process the [[ozonolysis]] product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Narayan |first=Ramani |authorlink= |author2=Phuong Tran |author3=Daniel Graiver  |date=September 2005 |title=Ozone-mediated polyol synthesis from soybean oil  |journal=Journal of the American Oil Chemists' Society |volume=82 |issue=9 |pages=653–659 |id= |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/q85p072054701280/ |accessdate= 2007-10-01 |quote= |doi=10.1007/s11746-005-1124-z }}&lt;/ref&gt; The example below shows the reaction of [[triolein]] with ozone and [[ethylene glycol]].
[[Image:Ozonolysis soy.png|450px|center|Ozonolysis of unsaturated triglyceride]]
Air oxidation, ([[autoxidation]]), the chemistry involved in the "drying" of [[drying oils]], gives increased molecular weight and introduces hydroxyl groups. The [[Radical (chemistry)|radical reactions]] involved in autoxidation can produce a complex mixture of crosslinked and oxidized triglycerides. Treatment of vegetable oils with [[peroxy acid]]s gives [[epoxides]] which can be reacted with [[nucleophiles]] to give hydroxyl groups. This can be done as a one-step process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent|US|2006041156}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that in the example shown below only one of the three fatty acid chains is drawn fully, the other part of the molecule is represented by "R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;" and the nucleophile is unspecified.  Earlier examples also include acid catalyzed ring opening of [[epoxidized soybean oil]] to make oleochemical polyols for polyurethane foams &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent|US|4742087}}&lt;/ref&gt; and acid catalyzed ring opening of soy fatty acid methyl esters with multifunctional polyols to form new polyols for casting resins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent|US|6730768}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Epoxide.png|450px|center|Epoxidation and ring opening of unsaturated triglyceride]]

Triglycerides of unsaturated (containing carbon-carbon double bonds) fatty acids or methyl esters of these acids, can be treated with [[carbon monoxide]] and [[hydrogen]] in the presence of a metal [[catalyst]] to add a -CHO (formyl) groups to the chain ([[hydroformylation]] reaction) followed by [[hydrogenation]] to give the needed hydroxyl groups.&lt;ref name="babb"&gt;{{cite conference |first=D. |last=Babb |authorlink= |author2=J. Phillips |author3=C. Keillor |title=Soy-based Polyol for Flexible Slabstock Foam |booktitle= |pages= |publisher=Alliance for the Polyurethanes Industry |year=2006 |location=Salt Lake City |url= |accessdate= |id= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; can be the rest of the triglyceride, or a smaller group such as methyl (in which case the substrate would be similar to [[biodiesel]]). If R=Me then additional reactions like [[transesterification]] are needed to build up a polyol.
[[Image:Hydroformylation-soy.png|450px|center|Hydroformylation and reduction of unsaturated triglyceride]]

==Uses==
Castor oil has found numerous [[Castor oil#Uses|applications]], many of them due to the presence of the hydroxyl group that allows chemical derivatization of the oil or modifies the properties of castor oil relative to vegetable oils which do not have the hydroxyl group. Castor oil undergoes most of the reactions that [[alcohols#Reactions|alcohols]] do, but the most industrially important one is reaction with [[isocyanates|diisocyanates]] to make polyurethanes.

Castor oil by itself has been used in making a variety of polyurethane products, ranging from coatings to foams, and the use of castor oil derivatives continues to be an area of active development. Castor oil derivatized with [[propylene oxide]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first=S. |last=Bauer |authorlink= |author2=R. Kuppel |author3=J. Winkler |author4= P.

Apart from castor oil, which is a relatively expensive vegetable oil and is not produced domestically in many industrialized countries, the use of polyols derived from [[vegetable oil]]s to make polyurethane products began attracting attention beginning around 2004. The rising costs of petrochemical feedstocks and an enhanced public desire for [[environmentally friendly]] [[green chemistry|green]] products have created a demand for these materials.&lt;ref name="ussc"&gt;{{cite conference

One of the first uses for NOPs (other than castor oil) was to make spray-on polyurethane foam insulation for buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biobased.net/index.php|title=BioBased Foam insulation homepage|accessdate=2007-10-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031064344/http://www.biobased.net/index.php|archive-date=2007-10-31|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The characteristics of NOPs can be varied over a very wide range. This can be done by selection of the base Natural Oil (or oils) used to make up the NOP. Also, using known and increasingly novel (Garrett &amp; Du) chemical techniques, it is possible to graft additional groups onto the triglyceride chains of the NOP and change its processing characteristics and this in turn will change and modify in a controlled manner, the physical properties of the final article which the NOP is being used to produce. Differences and modifications in the process regime and reaction conditions  used to make a given NOP also generally lead to different chemical architectures and therefore different end use performance of that NOP; so that even though two NOPs may have been made from the same Natural Oil root, they may be surprisingly different when used and, will produce a detectably different end product too. Commercially, (since 2012) NOPs are available and  made from; sawgrass oil, soybean oil, castor oil (as an grafted NOP), rapeseed oil, palm oil (kernel and mesocarp), and coconut oil. There is also some work being done on NOPs made from Natural Animal oils.

Initially in the US, and since early 2010, it has been routinely possible to replace over 50% of petrochemical-based polyols with NOPs for use in slab foams sold into the mass market, furniture and bedding industries. The commercialised technology &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenurethanes.com/publications |title=Expanding the Use of Natural Oil Polyols in Urethane Foam Formulations - Rowlands, J. UTECH Conference, Maastricht, the Netherlands. April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; also eliminates or greatly reduces the odor problem, mentioned above, normally associated with the use of NOPs. This is particularly important when the NOP is to be used at ever higher percentage levels, to try to reduce dependency on petrochemical materials, and to produce materials for use in the domestic and contract furniture segments which are historically very sensitive to "chemical" odors in the final foam product in people's homes and places of work.

Amongst other useful effects of using high levels of Natural Oil Polyols to make foams are the improvements seen in the long-term performance of the foam under humid conditions and also on the flammability of the foams; compared to equivalent foams made without the presence of the NOP.
People perspire; and so foams used for the construction of matrasses or furniture will, over time, tend to feel softer and give less support. The perspiration gradually softens the foam. Foams made with high levels of NOPs are much less prone to this problem, so that the useful lifetime of the upholstered product can be extended.
The use of high levels of NOP also make it possible to manufacture foams with flame retardants which are permanent, and therefore are not later emitted into the household or work place environment. These relatively recently developed materials can be added at very low levels to NOP foams to pass such well known tests as [[California Technical Bulletin 117]], which is a well-known flammability test for furniture. These permanent flame-retardants are halogen free and key into the foam matrix and are therefore fixed there. An additional effect of using these new, highly efficient, permanent flame retardants, is that the smoke seen during these standard fire tests, may be considerably reduced compared to that produced when testing foams made using non-permanent flame retardant materials, which do not key themselves into the foam structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenurethanes.com/publications |title=Low VOC Cal TB 117 Using Bio-Renewable Technologies - Rowlands, J. Polyurethane Foamers Association Conference - St Petersburg, FL, USA - May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent work during 2014 with this "Green Chemistry" has shown that foams containing  about 50 percent by weight of natural oils can be made which produce far less smoke when involved in fire situations. The ability of these low emission foams to reduce smoke emissions by up to 80% is an interesting property which will aid escape from fire situations and also lessen the risks for first responders i.e. emergency services in general and fire department personnel in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.greenurethanes.com/publications |title=Future-Proof Natural Foams for the USDA BioPreferred Program - Rowlands, J. Utech Conference and Exhibition, Charlotte USA. June 4th and 5th 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other technology can be combined with these flammability characteristics to give foams, which have extremely low overall emissions of volatile organic compounds, known as VOCs.

'''Orfeo Toolbox''' (OTB) is a library for remote sensing image processing.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=dveSBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA199&amp;dq=%22Orfeo+toolbox%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi33ffQ3aPeAhUNeisKHYDqAiwQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Orfeo%20toolbox%22&amp;f=false|title=Open Source Geospatial Tools: Applications in Earth Observation|last=McInerney|first=Daniel|last2=Kempeneers|first2=Pieter|date=2014-11-22|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319018249|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was initiated by the French space agency ([[CNES]])&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; in 2006 and is under heavy development. The software is released under a free licence; a number of contributors outside CNES are taking part in development and integrating into other projects. The goal is to provide potential users of satellite images with all the tools necessary to use these images.&lt;ref&gt;E. Christophe and J. Inglada "Open Source Remote Sensing: Increasing the Usability of Cutting-Edge Algorithms" in IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Newsletter, issue 150, March 2009, pp. 9-15.&lt;/ref&gt; The library is originally targeted at high resolution images acquired by the Orfeo constellation: [[Pleiades satellites]] and Cosmo-Skymed but also handles other sensors.

==Languages and interaction with other software==
OTB is a C++ library, based on [[Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit|Insight toolkit]] (ITK), a medical image processing library.

Bindings are developed for [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and are available as the separate OTB-Wrapping project. A blog post on the orfeo-toolbox blog details an example using the python wrapping &lt;ref&gt;OTB Mad Lab (OTB in python example): {{cite web |url=http://blog.orfeo-toolbox.org/uncategorized/otb-mad-lab |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525202521/http://blog.orfeo-toolbox.org/uncategorized/otb-mad-lab |archivedate=2010-05-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A method to use OTB components within [[IDL (programming language)|IDL]]/[[ENVI (software)|ENVI]] has been published.

One of the OTB user defined a procedure to use the library capabilities from [[MATLAB]].&lt;ref&gt;Using OTB from Matlab: http://groups.google.com/group/otb-users/browse_thread/thread/8ea7ba2e4034a0f1#&lt;/ref&gt;

Since late 2009,&lt;ref&gt;OTB Qgis plugins: {{cite web |url=http://hg.orfeo-toolbox.org/OTB-Qgis-plugins |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100817035035/http://hg.orfeo-toolbox.org/OTB-Qgis-plugins/ |archivedate=2010-08-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; some modules are developed as processing plugins&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.orfeo-toolbox.org/uncategorized/otb-inside-sextante-inside-qgis |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504001258/http://blog.orfeo-toolbox.org/uncategorized/otb-inside-sextante-inside-qgis |archivedate=2012-05-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for [[QGIS]]. Modules for classification, segmentation, hill shading have provided. This effort has not been funded so far and relies only on volunteers.

OTB algorithms are now available in QGIS through the processing framework Sextante.

==Applications==

Additionally to the library, several applications with GUI are distributed. These application enable interactive segmentation, orthorectification, classification, image registration, etc...

==Monteverdi (version 1 and 2)==

The OTB-Applications package makes available a set of simple software tools which were designed to demonstrates what can be done with OTB. Many users started using these applications for real processing tasks, so we tried to make them more generic, more robust and easy to use. 
It supports raster and vector data and integrates most of the already existing OTB applications. The architecture takes advantage of the streaming and multi-threading capabilities of the OTB pipeline. It also uses cool features such as processing on demand and automagic file format I/O. The application is called Monteverdi,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.orfeo-toolbox.org/otb/monteverdi.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503101155/http://www.orfeo-toolbox.org/otb/monteverdi.html |archivedate=2012-05-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; since this is the name of the Orfeo composer. This is also in memory of the great (and once open source) Khoros/Cantata software.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Young, Danielle Argiro and Steven Kubica, Cantata: Visual Programming Environment for the Khoros System, Computer Graphics, 1995, volume 29, pp 22-24&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Monteverdi software have been revamped to take into account users feedbacks regarding how useful the tool was, but also regarding what should be improved to move toward greater usability and operationnality. Monteverdi concept has been reworked into a brand new software called Monteverdi2, enlightened by this experience.

==License==

OTB was initially distributed under the french Open Source license [[CeCILL]] (similar and compatible with the GNU GPL) and is now available under the Apache 2.0 license.

==History==
The development started in January 2006 &lt;ref&gt;http://hg.orfeo-toolbox.org/OTB/rev/aba0c56ceeda&lt;/ref&gt; with the first release in July 2006.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.orfeo-toolbox.org/SoftwareGuide/SoftwareGuidech27.html#x56-39800027.9.1&lt;/ref&gt; The development version is publicly accessible.&lt;ref&gt;http://hg.orfeo-toolbox.org&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15713">[[File:SFI Primary Groups.png|thumb|right|SFI Primary Groups]]
The '''SFI Group System''' is the most widely used [[Classification|classification system]] for the [[Ship transport|maritime]] and offshore industry worldwide. It is an international standard, which provides a functional subdivision of technical and financial ship or rig information.

SFI consists of a technical account structure covering all aspects of ship/rig specification, and it can be used as a basic standard for all systems in the shipping/offshore industry.

More than 6000 SFI systems have been installed worldwide.

SFI is used by shipping and offshore companies, shipyards, consultancies, software suppliers, authorities and [[Classification society|classification societies]].

== Background, Purpose, and Advantages ==

=== Background ===
The '''SFI Group System''' was first released in 1972 as the result of a research project undertaken by the [[Ship Research Institute of Norway]] (SFI: Skipsteknisk Forskningsinstitutt). Today, sales, marketing and upgrading of the '''SFI Group System''' is undertaken by [http://www.spectec.net SpecTec].

=== Purpose and Advantages ===
The main purpose of the '''SFI Group System''' is to help shipping and offshore companies control operations by tying together all their procedures such as purchasing, accounting, maintenance, technical records, etc.
The '''SFI Group System''' provides major advantages for shipping and offshore operations in the following areas:
* Communication
* Computerisation
* Cooperation
* Cost Control
* Cost Comparison
* Development
* Education and Training
* Quality Control
* Standardisation

=== Scope ===
When the '''SFI Group System''' was established, the intention was that it should be capable of accommodating all relevant ship or rig types, and it should be a common code for the flow of information between different enterprises within the maritime and offshore industry.

The system should be independent of company organization and methods of ship building, ship operation, maintenance and repair. It should further lend itself to be updated with regard to new ship types and new technology. In order to meet the purpose of and the requirements to the system, the ships were divided into functions. The ship functions are common to all parties who are concerned with the specification, building and operation of ships.

In addition to the Group System with Detail Code, it may be necessary for each user to develop special codes, such as plan of finance accounts for budgeting and cost control of total company operation.

Shipyards using the '''SFI Group System''' for planning and control of production will require a supplementary company internal Work Breakdown Structure (WBS).
Shipping companies using the '''SFI Group System''' for operation and maintenance planning and control, will require a coding system for consumables.

== The Problems SFI Can Solve ==

=== Controlling Shipping and Offshore Operations ===
The '''SFI Group System''' improves the control and quality assurance of activities such as maintenance, purchasing, accounting and record keeping within shipping and offshore operations.

SFI provides shipping and offshore companies, shipyards, authorities, suppliers and consultants with a common plan of technical account/codes in the handling of:
* Specifications
* Estimates
* Drawings
* Purchase
* Material Administration
* Maintenance and Repair Planning
* Instruction Material
* Budgets and Cost Control
* Files
The areas of system utilization are steadily increasing, and the system has contributed to increased efficiency in the maritime industry. The SFI Group Systemis a particularly useful tool when routines are being established according to the quality loop ([http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=41014 ref. ISO 9004, par. 5.1]).

[[File:SFI Quality Loop.jpg|thumb|right|SFI Quality Loop]]

=== Specifications ===
Specifications are normally established at different levels of detail: Outline, Contract, Building, As Built and Repair Specifications. Technical descriptions of components should be part of the As Built Specification and should follow the SFI Detail Code.

The database version of the Group System lends itself especially well to the development of the various specifications. A report generator makes it easy for the user to edit specifications according to requirements.
Specifications may be related to different Group System levels.
* Outline specifications to Primary Group level
* Functional requirements to Secondary Group level
* Functional solutions to Tertiary Group level
* Component selections to Detail Code level

=== Estimates ===
As estimates are based on specifications, they should follow the same breakdown structure. The estimates normally contain cost of material and working hours:

=== Drawings and Document Handling ===
Drawings can easily be numbered according to SFI, and complex drawings in CAD systems may be split into layers to show individual installations according to the '''SFI Group System'''.

Drawing identification may incorporate a SFI Group System number. A standard drawing number may be composed as follows:

179-731-001
Ship no. – SFI tertiary group no. – Consecutive no.

Drawings should be numbered according to the group level if possible. The Primary and Secondary Group levels are usually used for system and arrangement drawings:

* 179-100-000: General arrangement
* 179-200-001: Profile and deck plan
* 179-350-000: Loading and discharging system
* 179-446-001: Engine stores arrangement

Item lists on arrangement drawings may also be coded according to the '''SFI Group System'''.

=== Purchasing ===
A purchase is normally charged to a finance account (cost type) and to a '''SFI Group System''' number, often called a technical account (cost center).

When purchasing components, a yard may specify the individual item by the SFI Detail Code (6 digits). When a shipping company orders spare parts, these may be identified by the SFI Detail Code + consecutive numbers (total of 9-10 digits).

=== Material Administration ===
When components are purchased directly to order/ship, the SFI Detail Code may be used as a technical account.

The spare part manufacturer may have its own numbering system. For a shipping company it is often convenient to establish a spare part numbering system comprising the SFI Detail Code + consecutive numbers:
* 731.001 - Starting air compressor
* 731.001.001 - HP cylinder
* 731.001.002 - LP cylinder
* 731.001.003 - HP cylinder cover
* 731.001.004 - LP cylinder cover

=== Maintenance ===
An operation and maintenance system will often contain a register covering all maintenance units on board. These units are normally identical to the components in the Detail Code:

731.001.01 - Starting air compressor no. 1
Maker:
Type:
Serial no.:
Capacity:

Procedures for preventive maintenance and class survey of a maintenance unit will be entered with job identification:

731.001.01 - Starting air compressor no. 1
Job A - 3000 hours routine
Job B - Class survey

All records of preventive and corrective maintenance should be filed and related to the maintenance unit. The technical accounts of planned maintenance systems such as [http://www.spectec.net/en/maritime/amos-maintenance-and-procurement AMOS Maintenance and Procurement] are commonly based on the '''SFI Group System'''.

=== Repair ===
Repair specifications are often based on information from the maintenance system. The repair bill should follow the repair specification structure. It is customary for the yard to quote prices to the shipping company at subgroup level.

=== Operation Budget ===
The '''SFI Group System''' is used for budgeting of maintenance and repair work, and for spare part consumption. In order to make a complete operation budget in a shipping company, it is necessary to link the Group System to a plan of finance accounts. Any suitable plan of finance accounts may be used together with SFI.

The plan of finance accounts usually covers spare parts and consumable items. Budgeting of spare parts may be performed in great detail using the '''SFI Group System'''.

=== Cost Control ===
[[Cost accounting|Cost control]] of new building or repair work is normally carried out at the tertiary Group and Detail Code levels. Direct purchases are charged to the SFI Detail Code:

Materials:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Code !! Name !! Planned !! Actual !! Difference
|-
| 731.001 || Starting air compressor || 150,000 || 158,000 || +8,000
|}

Reporting of working hours is normally carried out at the tertiary group level. Activities and jobs must be established to follow up work progress.

Materials:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Code !! Name !! Planned !! Actual !! Difference
|-
| 731 || Starting air systems || 200 || 210 || +10
|}

=== Quality Assurance ===
In relation to [http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/management-standards/iso_9000.htm ISO 9000] and [http://www.imo.org/en/Pages/Default.aspx IMO] requirements for safe operation, it is necessary to establish procedures that ensure that specification requirements and rules and regulations from authorities and classification societies are met, and that the ship/rig is operated safely.

The following procedures and instructions should be classified according to SFI:
* Surveyor’s manual
* Installation description

=== Filing ===
The '''SFI Group System''' is often used as a standard filing system for the shipping and offshore industry. SFI gives this industry a well structured and organized filing system for drawings, manuals, reports, and publications.
* Testing and commissioning procedures
* Operating, start and stop manuals
* Maintenance instructions
* Faultfinding
* Spare parts
* Tools
* List of drawings
* Certificates
* Agents

== The Coding Structure of SFI ==

=== SFI Group System (3-digit) ===
[[File:SFI Triangle.png|thumb|right|Primary Group 7]]
The SFI Group System is built up as a 3-digit decimal classification system. The ship/rig is divided into 10 Primary Groups from 0 to 9. Only Primary Groups 1 to 8 are in use. The users may use Primary Groups 0 and 9 for classifying other main components that are not covered by the SFI standard.

Each of the Primary Groups (1st digit) consists of 10 Groups (2nd digit) and each Group is divided further into 10 subgroups (3rd digit).
The Primary Groups (1st digit) of SFI for Ships is described below.

==== Primary Group 1 - General ====
Details and costs that cannot be charged to any specific function on board, e.g. general arrangement, quality assurance, launching, dry-docking and guarantee 
work.

==== Primary Group 2 - Hull Systems ====
Hull, superstructure and material protection of the vessel.

==== Primary Group 3 - Cargo Equipment ====
Cargo equipment and machinery including systems for vessel’s cargo, loading/discharging systems, cargo winches and hatches.

==== Primary Group 4 - Ship Equipment ====
Ship specific equipment- and machinery. Navigational equipment, manoeuvring machinery, anchoring equipment, and communication equipment. This group also includes special equipment such as equipment for fishing.

==== Primary Group 5 - Crew and Passenger Equipment ====
Equipment, machinery, systems etc. serving crew and passengers, for example lifesaving equipment, furniture, catering equipment and sanitary systems.

==== Primary Group 6 - Machinery Main Components ====
Primary components in the engine room, for example main and auxiliary engines, propellers, plant, boilers, and generators.

==== Primary Group 7 - Systems for Machinery Main Components ====
Systems serving main machinery components, for example fuel and lubrication oil systems, starting air system, exhaust systems and automation systems.

==== Primary Group 8 - Common Systems ====
Central ship systems, for example ballast and bilge systems, fire fighting and wash down systems, electrical distribution systems etc.

=== SFI Detail and Material Codes (6 digit) ===
The detail and material codes cover components and materials that may be related to the individual subgroups. In order to reach the component level, it might be necessary to break the subgroups further down by using a detail code. This code has not yet been possible to standardize due to the variety of equipment and numbers onboard different types of ships, and due to slightly different requirements to the code for shipyards and shipping companies.

Usually there are two different classes of components and material that are used; one class comprises components and material that are ordered directly to a ship, the other comprises components and material that are ordered to stock. Consequently, the codes are divided into two parts:

'''Detail Code''': Components that are purchased directly to order/ship. The detail code is used to define the individual component and equipment that acts in the sub system function. In the Detail Code the supplementary codes are built up from 001-099.

'''Material Code''': This code relates to material that is purchased to stock.
The relations between these codes are as follows:
* SFI Group System + Detail Code: 731.000 – 731.099
* SFI Group System + Material Code: 731.100 – 731.999

== User Rights for the SFI Group System ==

=== SFI User License ===
An SFI User License Certificate must be purchased from SpecTec to use the '''SFI Group System'''. One license fee will be charged for each SFI installation. This means that one license is required for each ship/site/rig that uses the coding structure of SFI. There are additional charges for each book, file or database.

== Formats of the SFI Group System ==

=== SFI Manuals ===
The SFI manuals are available in the following formats:
* A4
* A5
* A6
* Letter
The A4, A5, and Letter manuals contain the following parts:
* SFI Code Matrix
* Summary lists of primary, secondary, and tertiary groups
* Detailed descriptions of secondary and tertiary groups
* Detail Codes
* Material Codes
* Keyword register
The A6 pocket manual contains:
* SFI Code Matrix
* Summary of primary, secondary, and tertiary groups
* Keyword register

== Conclusion ==
A classification system such as the '''SFI Group System''' will make a substantial contribution to standardized and well-ordered information related to ships/rigs, and will lead to improved communication both within a company and with external parties.

The '''SFI Group System''' will make shipping and offshore operations more efficient because companies will save resources and avoid pitfalls when implementing the SFI standards. SFI can be the common denominator tying together all functions of shipping and offshore operations such as maintenance, purchasing, accounting, filing etc.

&lt;/ref&gt;  However, due to different accidents and delays it was commissioned only in 2012.  The license to drill in Norwegian waters was delayed several times due to non-conformities with Norwegian regulations.  Non-conformities were found in areas such as the management system for use of lifting equipment, offshore cranes for pipe handling, emergency operation of lifting appliances, access to electrical equipment, safety barriers, storage facility for helicopter fuel, as well as design-related issues covering materials handling and working environment.&lt;ref name=upstream210512&gt;

'''Scentography''' is the technique of creating and storing odor by artificially recreating a smell using chemical and electronic means.

DigiScents Inc was among the more recent pioneers of the technology, developing DigiScent (later [[iSmell]]) in 1999 as a device that would plug into a computer's [[USB]] port and generate scents dependent on the online content being viewed. The company ceased trading in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/7.11/digiscent.html |title=Wired 7.11: You've Got Smell! |publisher=Wired.com |date=2009-01-04 |accessdate=2013-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/tech/2012/10/the-50-worst-internet-startup-fails-of-all-time/digiscents |title=32.

In 2013, Amy Radcliffe, a [[Master's degree|Master's]] student in the Textile Futures department of [[Central Saint Martins]], [[London]] introduced a [[prototype]] of a desktop device to record aromas. For the project, she drew on [[headspace technology]] pioneered in the 1980s by [[Roman Kaiser]] to capture smells in the air around certain objects.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wainwright |first=Oliver |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2013/jun/28/scentography-camera-records-smells-memory |title=Scentography: the camera that records your favourite smells &amp;#124; Art and design &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date=2013-06-28 |accessdate=2013-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Called the [[Madeleine (cake)|Madeleine]], after the [[Marcel Proust]] episode from [[In Search of Lost Time|''Remembrance of Things Past'']], the device is a working prototype of a new kind of camera to record smell.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt; It consists of a funnel to be placed over the object with the scent you wish to capture. This is attached to a pump that draws air into an odor trap made of a porous [[polymer]] resin. According to Radcliffe, it can take from a few minutes to a whole day to capture the odour in liquid form, depending on its intensity.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt;

So far, several samples have been sent for analysis in a [[gas chromatography–mass spectrometry]] machine at a fragrance laboratory. In the scenario developed for the prototype, the Madeleine would be taken for local lab processing in a similar way to conventional photographic film.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt;&lt;ref name="idolmag"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://idolmag.co.uk/blog/madeleine |title=Madeleine &amp;#124; Idol Magazine |publisher=Idolmag.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The device was exhibited during [[Milan Fashion Week]] in April 2013.&lt;ref name="idolmag" /&gt;

The '''Agricultural Revolution in Scotland''' was a series of changes in agricultural practice that began in the seventeenth century and continued in the nineteenth century. They began with the improvement of [[Scottish Lowlands]] farmland and the beginning of a transformation of Scottish [[agriculture]] from one of the least modernised systems to what was to become the most modern and productive system in Europe. The traditional system of agriculture in Scotland generally used the [[Run rig|runrig]] system of management, which had possibly originated in the late medieval period. The basic pre-improvement farming unit was the {{lang|gd|baile}} (in the Highlands) and the fermetoun (in the Lowlands). In each, a small number of families worked open-field arable and shared grazing. Whilst run rig varied in its detail from place to place, the common defining detail was the sharing out by lot on a regular (probably annual) basis of individual parts ("rigs") of the arable land so that families had intermixed plots in different parts of the field.&lt;ref name="Dodgshon"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dodgshon |first1=Robert A. |title=From Chiefs to Landlords: Social and Economic Change in the Western Highlands and Islands, c.1493-1820 |date=1998 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |location=Edinburgh |isbn=0 7486 1034 0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|149}}&lt;ref name="Devine 2018"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Devine |first1=T M |title=The Scottish Clearances: A History of the Dispossessed, 1600-1900|date=2018 |publisher=Allen Lane |location=London |isbn=978-0241304105}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=24}} 

==Use of the term==
The term Scottish Agricultural Revolution was used in the early twentieth century primarily to refer to the period of most dramatic change in the second half of the eighteenth century and early nineteenth century. More recently historians have become aware of a longer processes, with change beginning in the late seventeenth century and still continuing into the mid-nineteenth century. The expansion of the period covered has led some to question the concept of a revolution.&lt;ref&gt;I. D. Whyte and K. A. Whyte, ''The Changing Scottish Landscape: 1500–1800'' (London: Taylor &amp; Francis, 1991), {{ISBN|0415029929}}, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Seventeenth century===
[[File:Riggs at Haddington.jpg|thumb|Runrig farming outside the town of [[Haddington, East Lothian]] c. 1690]]
Before the seventeenth century, with difficult terrain, poor roads and methods of transport there was little trade between different areas of the country and most settlements depended on what was produced locally, often with very little in reserve in bad years. Most farming was based on the lowland [[Hamlet (place)#United Kingdom|fermtoun]] or highland [[Township (Scotland)|baile]], settlements of a handful of families that jointly farmed an area notionally suitable for two or three plough teams, allocated in [[run rig]]s, of "runs" (furrows) and "rigs" (ridges), to [[tenant farmer]]s. Most ploughing was done with a heavy wooden plough with an iron [[Coulter (agriculture)|coulter]], pulled by oxen, which were more effective in the heavy Scottish soil, and cheaper to feed than horses.&lt;ref name=Wormald1991pp41-55&gt;J. Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470–1625'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), {{ISBN|0-7486-0276-3}}, pp. 41–55.&lt;/ref&gt; Those with property rights included [[husbandmen]], lesser landholders and free tenants.&lt;ref name=Mitchison1983p82/&gt; Below them were the [[cottar]]s, who often shared rights to common pasture, occupied small portions of land and participated in joint farming as hired labour. Farms also might have grassmen, who had rights only to grazing.&lt;ref name=Mitchison1983p82&gt;R. Mitchison, ''Lordship to Patronage, Scotland 1603–1745'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1983), {{ISBN|074860233X}}, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Three acts of parliament passed in 1695 allowed the consolidation of runrigs and the division of common land.&lt;ref name=Bowie2012p314&gt;K. Bowie, "New perspectives on pre-union Scotland" in T. M. Devine and J. Wormald, eds, ''The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), {{ISBN|0191624330}}, p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eighteenth century===

After the union with England in 1707, there was a conscious attempt among the gentry and nobility to improve agriculture in Scotland. The Society of Improvers was founded in 1723, including in its 300 members dukes, earls, lairds and landlords.&lt;ref name=Mackieetal1991pp288-91&gt;J. D. Mackie, B. Lenman and G. Parker, ''A History of Scotland'' (London: Penguin, 1991), {{ISBN|0140136495}}, pp. 288–91. Gilles Denis, "Sociétés d'agriculture et diffusion des Lumières" in Frank Salaün and Jean-Pierre Schandeler, ''Enquête sur le Construction des Lumières'' (Centre international d'étude du XVIIIe siècle: Ferney-Voltaire, 2018), pp. 108-109. &lt;/ref&gt; In the first half of the century these changes were limited to tenanted farms in East Lothian and the estates of a few enthusiasts, such as [[John Cockburn (Scottish politician)|John Cockburn]] and [[Sir Archibald Grant, 2nd Baronet|Archibald Grant]]. Not all were successful, with Cockburn driving himself into bankruptcy, but the ethos of improvement spread among the landed classes.&lt;ref name="Whyte2001pp206-7"&gt;I. D. Whyte, "Economy: primary sector: 1 Agriculture to 1770s", in M. Lynch, ed., ''The Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), {{ISBN|0-19-211696-7}}, pp. 206–7.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sheep in turnip field, Auchindrain, Argyll.JPG|thumb|Sheep feeding on turnips, [[Auchindrain]], Argyll]]The English plough was introduced along with foreign grasses, the sowing of rye grass and clover. Turnips and cabbages were introduced, lands enclosed and marshes drained, lime was put down, roads built and woods planted. Drilling and sowing and [[crop rotation]] were introduced. The introduction of the potato to Scotland in 1739 greatly improved the diet of the peasantry. [[Enclosure]]s began to displace the runrig system and free pasture. There was increasing specialisation, with the Lothians became a major centre of grain, Ayrshire of cattle breading and the borders of sheep.&lt;ref name=Mackieetal1991pp288-91/&gt;

Although some estate holders improved the quality of life of their displaced workers,&lt;ref name=Mackieetal1991pp288-91/&gt; the Agricultural Revolution led directly to what is increasingly becoming known as the [[Lowland Clearances]],&lt;ref&gt;Robert Allan Houston and Ian D. Whyte, ''Scottish Society, 1500–1800'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), {{ISBN|0-521-89167-1}}, pp. 148–151.&lt;/ref&gt; with hundreds of thousands of cottars and tenant farmers from central and southern Scotland emigrating from the farms and small holdings their families had occupied for hundreds of years, or adapting them to the Scottish Agricultural Revolution.&lt;ref name=Mackieetal1991pp288-91/&gt;

===Nineteenth century===
[[File:George Heriot Swanston03.jpg|thumb|right|alt=man guiding two horses pushing machine |An 1851 illustration showing the reaping machine developed by [[Patrick Bell]]]]
Improvement continued in the nineteenth century. Innovations included the first working [[Reaper|reaping machine]], developed by [[Patrick Bell]] in 1828. His rival [[James Smith (inventor)|James Smith]] turned to improving sub-soil drainage and developed a method of ploughing that could break up the subsoil barrier without disturbing the topsoil. Previously unworkable low-lying carselands could now be brought into arable production and the result was the even Lowland landscape that still predominates.&lt;ref name="Sprott2011"&gt;G. Sprot, "Agriculture, 1770s onwards", in M. Lynch, ed., ''Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), {{ISBN|0199693056}}, pp. 321–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Lowlands had seen widespread agricultural improvement, the financially broken Highland lairds took to replacing Highland agricultural practice with its own system of labour with Lowland agricultural practice plus labour in the Highland Clearances.&lt;ref&gt;M. Gray, ''The Highland Economy, 1750–1850'' (London: Greenwood, 1976), {{ISBN|0-8371-8536-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2018}} A handful of powerful families, typified by the dukes of [[Duke of Argyll|Argyll]], [[Duke of Atholl|Atholl]], [[Duke of Buccleuch|Buccleuch]], and [[Duke of Sutherland|Sutherland]], owned the best lands and controlled local political, legal and economic affairs. As late as 1878, 68 families owned nearly half the land in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;H. Pelling, ''Social Geography of British Elections 1885–1910'' (1960, Gregg Revivals, rpt., 1994), {{ISBN|0-7512-0278-9}}, p. 373.&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly after the end of the boom created by the [[French Revolutionary Wars|Revolutionary]] and Napoleonic Wars (1790–1815), these landlords needed cash to maintain their position in London society. They turned to money rents and downplayed the traditional patriarchal relationship that had historically sustained the [[Scottish clan|clans]]. This was exacerbated after the repeal of the [[Corn Laws]] in mid-century, when Britain adopted a free trade policy, and grain imports from America undermined the profitability of crop production.&lt;ref&gt;B. Thomas, ''The Industrial Revolution and the Atlantic Economy: Selected Essays'' (London: Routledge, 1993), {{ISBN|0-415-07978-0}}, pp. 93–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Crofts at Borreraig - geograph.org.uk - 137969.jpg|thumb|right|[[Croft (land)|Crofts]] at [[Borreraig]] on the island of [[Skye]]]]
One result of these changes were the [[Highland Clearances]], by which much of the population of the Highlands suffered [[forced displacement]] as lands were enclosed, principally so that they could be used for sheep farming. The clearances followed patterns of agricultural change throughout the UK, though were notorious as a result of the introduction of Lowland farmhands or practice into Highland agricultural land or practice, plus, the late timing, the lack of legal protection for year-by-year tenants under [[Scots law]], the abruptness of the change from the traditional clan system, and the brutality of many evictions.&lt;ref&gt;E. Richards, ''The Highland Clearances: People, Landlords and Rural Turmoil'' (Edinburgh, Birlinn Press, 2008), {{ISBN|1-84158-542-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The result was a continuous exodus from the land—to the cities, or further afield to England, Canada, America or Australia.&lt;ref&gt;J. Wormald, ''Scotland: a History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), {{ISBN|0-19-820615-1}}, p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==
The Lowland and Highland Clearances meant that many small settlements were dismantled, their occupants forced either to the new [[model village|purpose-built villages]] built by the landowners such as John Cockburn's [[Ormiston]] or [[Sir Archibald Grant, 2nd Baronet|Archibald Grant]]'s [[Monymusk]]&lt;ref&gt;D. Ross, ''Scotland: History of a Nation'' (Lomond Books, 2000), {{ISBN|0947782583}}, p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt; on the outskirts of the new ranch-style farms, or to the new industrial centres of [[Glasgow]], [[Edinburgh]], or northern England. Tens of thousands of others emigrated to Canada or the United States, finding opportunities there to own and farm their own land.&lt;ref name=Mackieetal1991pp288-91/&gt; In the Highlands many that remained were now [[croft (land)|crofters]], living on very small rented farms with indefinite tenure used to raise various crops and animals. For these families [[kelp]]ing, fishing, spinning of linen and military service became important sources of additional revenue.&lt;ref&gt;M. J. Daunton, ''Progress and Poverty: An Economic and Social History of Britain 1700–1850'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995), {{ISBN|0-19-822281-5}}, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

The latter, HCSD, is a relatively modern approach, which is used to transfer high throughputs of fine [[fly ash]] over long distances (&gt;{{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on|disp=or}}) using high pressure diaphragm pumps with [[velocities]] of around 2&amp;nbsp;m/s. Ash disposal is simple as the ash [[solidifies]] easily and the system does not produce the waste water or [[leachate]] problems which can often be associated with ash [[lagoons]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4786">The '''Softwarepark Hagenberg''' is the Austrian [[technology park]] for [[software]], located in [[Hagenberg im Mühlkreis]], [[Austria]], founded in 1989 by Professor [[Bruno Buchberger]]. The Softwarepark Hagenberg is a unique collaboration where research, business and education are intensively cooperating.&lt;ref name="wb2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="orf1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oesterreich.orf.at/ooe/stories/90872/|title=Der Softwarepark Hagenberg|publisher=[[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF.at]]|language=German|accessdate=2009-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="orf1" /&gt; Because of its success, the park has been called the "Wunder von Hagenberg" (miracle from Hagenberg).&lt;ref name="wb1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wirtschaftsblatt.at/home/oesterreich/unternehmen/wirtschaftsraum/318535/index.do|title=Weitere 50 Millionen € für das Wunder von Hagenberg|last=Gansrigler|first=Franz|date=19 March 2008|publisher=[[WirtschaftsBlatt]]|language=German|accessdate=2009-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Buchberger devised the concept for the park in 1989. It was created to balance both economic needs and desire for research and as such, the concept focused one third on economic production, one third on research and one third on academic education in the field of IT and related sciences.&lt;ref name="orf1" /&gt; These three components drive a synergetic "spirale of innovation". Softwarepark has four main partners: The Province of Upper Austria, the [[Johannes Kepler University Linz]], the [http://www.hagenberg.at Community of Hagenberg], and Raiffeisen Landesbank Oberösterreich, a major local bank.&lt;ref name="wb2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nachrichten1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nachrichten.at/nachrichten/reportage/art57,104515|title=Softwarepark will Anzahl der Mitarbeiter verdoppeln|last=Rubasch|first=Ulrike|date=4 February 2009|publisher=nachrichten.at|language=German|accessdate=2009-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first institute to be established in the park was Buchberger's [[Research Institute for Symbolic Computation]] (RISC) with then 25 students and employees.&lt;ref name="wb1" /&gt;

Today Softwarepark is increasing its international activities, e.g. with [http://www.isi-hagenberg.at/ ISI - International Studies in Informatics Hagenberg] or the recently launched [https://web.archive.org/web/20100620053308/http://www.international-incubator.com/ International Incubator Hagenberg].

Within the twenty years of its existence, 100 million € were invested into developing the park.&lt;ref name="wb2" /&gt;

==Composition==
The park currently houses 50 companies with more than 1000 employees as well as more than 1400 students of a number of universities and colleges, amongst them the [[Research Institute for Symbolic Computation]],&lt;ref name="wb2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wirtschaftsblatt.at/home/oesterreich/unternehmen/oberoesterreich/363389/index.do?_vl_pos=r.3.MOST|title=20 Millionen € für den Softwarepark Hagenberg|last=Leitner|first=Karl|date=24 February 2009|publisher=[[WirtschaftsBlatt]]|language=German|accessdate=2009-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wb1" /&gt; and the Software Competence Center Hagenberg SCCH&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scch.at/en/ Software Competence Center Hagenberg&lt;/ref&gt; funded by the Austrian [[COMET – Competence Centers for Excellent Technologies|COMET]] program.

Additionally, the park houses a social project for people with disabilities to provide computer support in cooperation with the [[Diakonisches Werk]] [[Gallneukirchen]] and the [[Fachhochschule Hagenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://derstandard.at/2282479|title=Sozialprojekt schneidert Maß-PC|last=Tzschentke|first=Karin|date=29 December 2005|publisher=[[Der Standard]]|language=German|accessdate=2009-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expansion==
The current expansion schedule plans to expand the park with 20 million € in funds until 2012, with the expansion of the [[Research Institute for Symbolic Computation]] as well as a hotel, sport arenas and an international student union building.&lt;ref name="wb2" /&gt; An additional 50 million € are planned to be invested until 2014 for the expansion of the companies and research institutes in the park.&lt;ref name="wb1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nachrichten1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5781">'''Station CAST''' was the [[United States Navy]] [[Signal intelligence|signals monitoring]] and [[cryptography|cryptographic]] intelligence [[fleet radio unit]] at [[Cavite Naval Base|Cavite Navy Yard]] in the [[Philippines]], until Cavite was captured by the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese forces]] in 1942, during [[World War II]]. It was an important part of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] intelligence effort, addressing Japanese communications as the War expanded from China into the rest of the [[Pacific War|Pacific theaters]]. As [[Battle of the Philippines (1941-42)|Japanese advances in the Philippines]] threatened &lt;small&gt;CAST&lt;/small&gt;, its staff and services were progressively transferred to Corregidor in Manila Bay, and eventually to a newly formed US-[[Australia]]n station, &lt;small&gt;[[FRUMEL]]&lt;/small&gt; in [[Melbourne]], Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar////PTO/Magic/COMINT-CoralSea/PartOne.html Parker, Frederick D. ''A Priceless Advantage: U.S. Navy Communications Intelligence and the Battles of Coral Sea, Midway, and the Aleutians''. Fort Meade MD: Center for Cryptologic History, National Security Agency, 1993.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

STATION CAST had originally been located at Shanghai but had been evacuated to Cavite in early 1941 as part of the US Navy's disengagement with China.

Prior to the war, &lt;small&gt;CAST&lt;/small&gt; was the US Navy's Far East cryptographic operation, under the [[OP-20-G]] Naval Intelligence section in Washington. It was located at the Navy Yard in [[Manila]]  and moved into the tunnels on [[Corregidor]], as Japanese attacks increased.  STATION CAST possessed one of the PURPLE machines produced by the US Army.

Cryptanalytic problems facing the United States in the Pacific prior to World War II were largely [[Japan]]ese. An early decision by OP-20-G divided responsibility for Japanese cryptanalysis amongst its various stations. Station CAST (at Manila in the Philippines), [[Station HYPO]] ([[Pearl Harbor]], [[Hawaii]]) OP-20-02, and [[OP-20-G]] itself in Washington, shared cryptanalytic duties. Other Stations (on [[Guam]], in [[Puget Sound]] on [[Bainbridge Island]], etc.) were tasked and staffed for signals interception and traffic analysis.

==PURPLE diplomatic traffic==

The US Army SIS break into the highest security Japanese diplomatic cypher (called [[PURPLE]] by US analysts) produced very interesting intelligence, but little of military value (except for Ambassador [[Hiroshi Oshima]]'s despatches from Germany); none of tactical value, and not much more of direct political value as the Foreign Office in Japan was thought by the ultra-nationalists in effective charge of Japanese foreign and military policy, to be unreliable.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} Furthermore, decrypts from [[PURPLE]] traffic, eventually called [[Magic (cryptography)|MAGIC]], were rather capriciously distributed to high level officials in Washington, and in general, poorly used.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} SIS was able to build several PURPLE machine equivalents and the distribution of those machines has since been thought controversial. One was sent to Station CAST. After the US entered the War, two went to [[Bletchley Park]], the center of British cryptographic work. One was sent to the [[Far East Combined Bureau]] (FECB) at Singapore, and was lost during the fall of Singapore &lt;ref&gt;*''The Emperor’s Codes: Bletchley Park and the breaking of Japan’s secret ciphers'' by Michael Smith, page 105-106 (2000, Bantam London) {{ISBN|0-593-04642-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Japanese Navy crypto systems: JN-25==

Stations HYPO and CAST were assigned responsibility for work on Japanese Navy systems, and after the agreement with the United Kingdom and Netherlands to share the effort, worked with crypto groups in Hong Kong then Singapore ([[Far East Combined Bureau]]) and [[Jakarta|Batavia]] (Kamer 14 or Room 14). 

Prior to the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], the amount of available traffic was low, and little progress had been made on the most important Japanese Navy system, called by US analysts [[JN-25]]. JN-25 was used for high level operations: movement and planning commands, for instance. It was a superencrypted code, eventually a two-book system, and joint cryptanalytic progress was slow.  JN-25B was introduced on 1 December 1940, but was broken immediately by [[FECB]] as the additives were not changed. Most references cite about 10% of messages partially (or sometimes completely) decrypted prior to 1 December 1941, at which time a new edition of the system went into effect and sent all the cryptanalysts back to the beginning.

After 7 December 1941, there was considerably more JN-25 traffic as the Japanese Navy operational tempo increased and geographically expanded, and progress against it went better. The [[FECB]] contribution stopped until the crypto station could be relocated from Singapore to Ceylon, but CAST, HYPO, and the Dutch at Batavia, in conjunction with OP-20-G, made steady progress.

==CAST during and after the invasion of the Philippines==

Station CAST and its personnel and equipment were moved from Manila to the tunnels on Corregidor as the Japanese approached and spent the next months working there. Eventually, they destroyed their equipment (some [[IBM]] [[punched card]] machines are said to have been among the gear shoved into the harbor) and were evacuated by submarine to Australia, for service with [[FRUMEL]]. Some personnel also worked at the [[Central Bureau]], supplying signals intelligence to MacArthur's [[South West Pacific Area (command)]].

[[File:Explorer II Gondola.jpg|thumb|upright|Explorer II gondola in the [[National Air and Space Museum]].]]
The '''Stratobowl''' is a compact natural [[Depression (geology)|depression]] within the limits of [[Black Hills National Forest]] in [[South Dakota]], south-west of [[Rapid City, South Dakota|Rapid City]]. In 1934–1935 it housed a [[stratosphere|stratospheric]] [[balloon]] [[launch site]], initially known as '''Stratocamp''', sponsored by the [[National Geographic Society]] and the [[United States Army Air Corps]]. In 1956–1959 the site was reused by the U.S Navy [[Project Strato-Lab]].

==''Explorer'' balloons==
In 1934 the NGS and Air Corps co-sponsored the ''[[Explorer (balloon)|Explorer]]'', a [[observation balloons|manned]] [[high-altitude balloon]] capable of stratospheric flight. After the crash of the Soviet ''[[Osoaviakhim-1]]'' that nevertheless set an altitude record of {{convert|72178|ft|m}}, the sponsors redefined their primary objectives from record-setting to scientific research and tests of new navigation instruments.&lt;ref name=R52/&gt; Air Corps Capt. [[Albert William Stevens]], Capt. [[Orvil Arson Anderson]] and Maj. [[William E. Kepner]] were selected to fly the ''Explorer''.&lt;ref name=R52&gt;Ryan, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; Kepner and Anderson, experienced balloonists, were in charge of locating a suitable launch site. According to Kepner, an ideal site would be a [[crater (disambiguation)|crater]] or [[canyon]], a clear grassy valley encircled with rocky ridges high enough to shield the tall balloon from any wind.&lt;ref&gt;For the same reasons, the U.S. Navy's later Stratolab project used old mining pits near [[Crosby, Minnesota]] – Ryan, p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; Ideally, the launch site it would have a high-voltage electric line, road and rail access, "and a [[trout]] stream".&lt;ref name=R53/&gt; Kepner and Anderson eventually located their dream canyon near [[Rapid City, South Dakota]]. City officials, fascinated by the expected publicity campaign, agreed to build a road and electric line.&lt;ref name=R53&gt;Ryan, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Anderson directed construction of a temporary village, housing over a 100 people, with the help of the [[South Dakota National Guard]] and the army's [[4th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|4th Cavalry Regiment]].&lt;ref name=R53/&gt; The central pad, {{convert|200|ft}} in diameter, was cushioned with sawdust to protect the fabric of the balloon as it was spread on the ground prior to inflation. Preparation for flight was regularly reported by the national press. ''Explorer'' lifted off at 6:45, July 28, 1934, an event broadcast live over the radio and watched by 30,000 spectators on site.&lt;ref name=R54/&gt; After seven hours in flight&lt;ref name=S22/&gt; the pilots noticed holes torn in the bottom of the gas bag; quickly losing gas, the balloon plunged into an uncontrolled dive, its gas bag disintegrating as the balloon picked up vertical speed.&lt;ref name=R54&gt;Ryan, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; At {{convert|5000|ft}} the remaining hydrogen exploded, sending the gondola in a free fall. According to Ryan, the pilots managed to bail out ''after'' the explosion, Kepner at an altitude of barely {{convert|500|ft}};&lt;ref name=R55/&gt; according to Shayler, they bailed out before the explosion; all three survived uninjured.&lt;ref name=S22/&gt; Later it turned out that the ''Explorer'' missed a world record by {{convert |624|ft}}.&lt;ref name=R55&gt;Ryan, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; The accident was linked to folds in the balloon's fabric that put it under extreme stress as the balloon expanded in stratosphere.&lt;ref name=S22&gt;Shayler, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

The NGS and Air Corps vowed to launch a new balloon in June 1935,&lt;ref name=R55/&gt; but the new [[helium]]-filled ''[[Explorer II (balloon)|Explorer II]]'' was not ready until November.&lt;ref name=R58&gt;Ryan, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; Watched by 20,000 spectators,&lt;ref name=R58/&gt; ''Explorer II'' lifted off at 8:00 November 11 and reached a new record height of {{convert|72395|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name=S20&gt;Shayler, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson, Kepner, and Stevens became the first men to view the Earth's [[curvature]].&lt;ref name=R589&gt;Ryan, pp. 58–59&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Strato-Lab balloons''==
In the 1950s, [[Project Manhigh]]&lt;ref&gt;Ryan. pp.99–100&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Project Strato-Lab]] launches were made from the man-made crater of an iron mining pit near [[Crosby, Minnesota]], and, if weather allowed, from Fleming Field in [[South St. Paul, Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; The Stratobowl was a backup location. There was one Stratobowl launch in 1956, three in 1958, and seven in 1959. On November 8, 1956, the ''Strato-Lab I'' gondola lifted [[Malcolm Ross (balloonist)|Malcolm Ross]] and M. L. Lewis from the Stratobowl to a world altitude record for manned balloon flight of {{convert|76000|ft|m}}. The purpose of the flight was to gather meteorological, cosmic ray, and other scientific data necessary to improve safety at high altitudes.&lt;ref&gt;Ross and Lewis, 1957&lt;/ref&gt; The most publicized flight, ''Strato-Lab IV'' piloted by Malcolm Ross and  [[Charles B. Moore]], lifted off from Stratobowl on November 28, 1959, reached an altitude of {{convert|81000|ft|m}}, and landed safely in [[Kansas]] after 20 hours in the air. The purpose of the flight was to perform spectrographic analysis of the planet Venus with minimal interference from the Earth's atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2043">The '''Texas Instruments Professional Computer''' ('''TIPC''') and the '''Texas Instruments Portable Professional Computer''' ('''TIPPC''') were devices that were both released on January 31, 1983. The TIPC was a desktop PC and the TIPPC was a fully compatible, portable version of the TIPC. Both computers were most often used by white-collar information workers and professionals who needed to gather, manipulate and transmit information. [[Texas Instruments]] (TI) was the first company to release videotape training videos for their computers.

The TI Professional Computer came with a 14", 720x300 pixel color monitor, had 512k RAM and contained state-of-the-art, cutting-edge features, including industry-standard software support, easy expandability, a superior and user-friendly QWERTY keyboard, and natural language database options.

The standard version of the TIPPC had a built-in 9" monochrome monitor; the upgraded version came with a built-in 9" color monitor. The graphical capabilities were far superior to the IBM competitor; the TIPPC featured a maximum resolution of 720x300 pixels. The standard device came equipped with 64k RAM but could be expanded to 768k.

Additionally, both the TIPC and TIPPC were equipped with voice recognition software, allowing the user to speak basic commands to the computers. Both computers also featured an Ethernet card, a new device developed in 1983 by [[3COM]]. The TIPC and the TIPPC were superseded by [[IBM Personal Computer]]s and compatible machine.

In [[computer programming]], a '''third-party software component''' is a reusable [[software component]] developed to be either freely distributed or sold by an entity other than the original vendor of the development platform. The third-party software component market thrives because many programmers believe that '''[[Component-based software engineering|component-oriented development]]''' improves the efficiency and the quality of developing custom applications. Common third-party software includes macros, bots, and software/scripts to be run as add-ons for popular developing software.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

'''Tripp Trapp''' is an adjustable wooden [[high chair]] for children.

== Development history ==
[[Peter Opsvik]] noticed that his son Tor had no chair that could position him at the correct height at the family dinner table and enable him to participate with the rest of the family. He then developed a chair that was adjustable and changed with the size of his son as he grew bigger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stokke.com/no-no/highchair/tripp-trapp-product-concept.aspx |accessdate=May 21, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601003406/http://www.stokke.com/no-no/highchair/tripp-trapp-product-concept.aspx |archivedate=June 1, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tripp Trapp did not sell well in the beginning, but a news segment on Norwegian television in 1974 sparked an interest that has gained strength over the years. By 2016 Tripp Trapp had sold more than 10 million chairs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.stokke.com/global/stokke-stories/stokke-stories-product-news/tripp-trapp-anniversary-collection-2016.html|title=Celebrating 10 million Tripp Trapp® chairs since 1972|website=USA|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Product characteristics ==

Tripp Trapp has a seat and footrest that can be adjusted in both height and depth. Thus the chair can be adapted as the child  grows. Additionally the chair is correctly spaced and so stable that even a young toddler can climb up into the chair safely by themselves. The Tripp Trapp high chair is made from [[beechwood]] with some limited editions in oak.

== Overview ==
Utility or "transportational" cycling generally involves traveling short and medium distances (several kilometers, not uncommonly 3–15 kilometers one way, or somewhat longer), often in an [[Urban area|urban environment]]. It includes [[Bicycle commuting|commuting]] (i.e. going to work, school or university), going shopping and running errands, as well as heading out to see friends and family or for other social activities.

It also includes economic activity such as the delivering of goods or services. In cities, the [[Bicycle messenger|bicycle courier]] is often a familiar feature, and [[freight bicycle]]s are capable of competing with [[truck]]s and [[van]]s particularly where many small deliveries are required, especially in congested areas. [[Cycle rickshaw|Velotaxis]] can also provide a [[public transport]] service like [[bus]]es and [[taxicab]]s.

Utility cycling is known to have several social and economic benefits. [[Policy|Policies]] that encourage utility cycling have been proposed and implemented for reasons including: improved [[public health]],&lt;ref name=rws /&gt;&lt;ref name=bmj /&gt; individual health and employers' profits&lt;ref&gt;TNO, the Dutch institute for applied scientific research.

== History ==
{{Main|History of the bicycle}}
The development of the safety bicycle was arguably the most important change in the history of the bicycle. It shifted their use and public perception from being a dangerous toy for sporting young men to being an everyday transport tool for men—and, crucially, women—of all ages.
By the start of the 20th Century, cycling had become an important means of transportation, and in the United States an increasingly popular form of recreation. Bicycling clubs for men and women spread across the U.S. and across European countries.
Cycling steadily became more important in Europe over the first half of the twentieth century, but it dropped off dramatically in the United States between 1900 and 1910. Automobiles became the preferred means of transportation. Over the 1920s, bicycles gradually became considered children's toys, and by 1940 most bicycles in the United States were made for children.
For most of the twentieth century, the great majority of cycling in the UK took place on roads

== The bicycle and the cyclist's equipment ==
[[File:Batavus 5.jpg|thumb|A Dutch [[Opafiets]] utility bicycle]]
[[Utility bicycle]]s have many standard features to enhance their usefulness and comfort. [[Chain guards]] and mudguards, or fenders, protect clothes and moving parts from oil and spray. Kickstands help with parking. Front-mounted wicker or steel baskets for carrying goods are often used. Rear [[luggage carrier]]s can be used to carry items such as [[school satchel]]s.

[[Panniers]] or special luggage carriers (including waterproof packing bags) enable the transport of goods and are used for shopping. Parents sometimes add rear-mounted child seats and/or an auxiliary saddle fitted to the crossbar to transport children. [[Bicycle trailer|Trailers]] of various types and load capacities may be towed to greatly increase cargo capacity. In many jurisdictions bicycles must be fitted with a bell; reflectors; and, after dark, front and rear [[bicycle lighting|lights]].

The use by cyclists of vests or armbands [[fluorescence|fluorescent]] in daylight or [[retroreflector|reflective]] at night can increase a cyclist's conspicuity, although these are not an alternative to a legally compliant lighting system. A report on the promotion of walking and cycling (Hydén, et al., 1999) discussed safety clothing and equipment and stated that "there is no doubt that both pedestrian reflectors and bicycle helmets are reducing the injury risk of their users quite considerably."&lt;ref name="Hydén"&gt;{{cite journal |title=WALCYNG:How to enhance WALking and CYcliNG instead of shorter car trips and to make these modes safer |author=Hydén, C., Nilsson, A. &amp; Risser, R. |date=1999-01-15 |publisher=[[University of Lund]], Sweden &amp; FACTUM Chaloupka, Praschl &amp; Risser OHG, Austria}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protective rain gear is often an essential part of the utility cyclist's wardrobe, especially in countries with high [[rainfall]] levels.

== Factors that influence levels of utility cycling ==
Many different factors combine to influence levels of utility cycling.&lt;ref&gt;Grégory Vandenbulcke-Plasschaert, 2011. Spatial analysis of bicycle use and accident risks for cyclists. Thèse présentée en vue de l’obtention du grade de Docteur en Sciences, [[Université Catholique de Louvain]], [[Louvain-la-Neuve]], November 2011, 318 pages.&lt;/ref&gt; In developing economies, a large amount of utility cycling may be seen simply because the bicycle is the most affordable form of [[vehicle|vehicular]] transport available to many people. In richer countries, where people can have the choice of a mixture of transport types, a complex interplay of other factors influences the level of bicycle use.

Factors affecting cycling levels may include: [[town planning]] (including quality of infrastructure: cyclist "friendly" vs. cyclist "hostile"), trip-end facilities (particularly secure parking), retail policy, marketing the public image of cycling, integration with other transport modes, cycle training, terrain (hilly vs. flat), distance to destinations, levels of motorized transport and climate as well as cost. In developed countries cycling has to compete with, and work with, alternative transport modes such as private cars, public transport and walking. Thus cycling levels are not influenced just by the attractiveness of cycling alone, but also by what makes the competing modes more or less attractive.

In developed countries with high utility cycling levels, utility cyclists tend to undertake relatively short journeys. According to [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] 1996 Census data, over 55% of cycling workers travelled 3&amp;nbsp;miles (4.8&amp;nbsp;km) or less, 27% 5&amp;nbsp;miles (8&amp;nbsp;km) or less and only 17% travelled more than 5&amp;nbsp;miles in their daily commute. It can be argued that factors that directly influence trip length or journey time are among the most important in making cycling a competitive transport mode. Car ownership rates can also be influential. In [[Transportation in New York City|New York City]], more than half of all households do not own a car (the figure is even higher in Manhattan, over 75%), and walk/bicycle modes of travel account for 21% of all modes for trips in the city.&lt;ref&gt;Putative source according to the 1995 Nationwide Personal Transportation Survey&lt;/ref&gt;

Decisions taken by various levels of government, as well as local groups, residents' organizations and public- and private-sector employers, can all affect the so-called "modal choice" or "[[modal split]]" in daily transport. In some cases, various factors may be manipulated in a manner that deliberately seeks to encourage or discourage various transport modes, including cycling.
[[File:Delivery bike.jpg|thumb|Last mile distribution using a bicycle in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stadtlogistik.info/ www.stadtlogistik.info]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The [[League of American Bicyclists]] has designated a set of five criteria&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bicyclefriendlycommunity.org/pdf/bfc_brochure.pdf|title=bicyclefriendlycommunity.org|work=bicyclefriendlycommunity.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virgin-vacations.com/site_vv/11-most-bike-friendly-cities.asp|title=Virgin Vacations – 11 Most Bicycle Friendly Cities in the World|work=virgin-vacations.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; for evaluating the friendliness of a town or city to bicycles. These criteria are classified under the headings of: Engineering, Encouragement, Evaluation and Planning, Education, Enforcement.

=== Town planning ===
Trip length and journey times are key factors affecting cycle use. [[Town planning]] may have a key effect in deciding whether key destinations, schools, shops, colleges, health clinics, public transport interchanges remain within a reasonable cycling distance of the areas where people live. The [[Urban area|urban form]] can influence these issues, compact and circular [[Population geography|settlement patterns]] tending to promote cycling. Alternatively, the low-density, non-circular (i.e., linear) settlement patterns characteristic of [[urban sprawl]] tends to discourage cycling. In 1990, the Dutch adopted the "ABC" guidelines, specifically limiting developments that are major attractants to locations that are readily accessible by non-car users.&lt;ref name="baar1"&gt;Legislative Tools for Preserving Town Centres and Halting the Spread of Hypermarkets and Malls Outside of Cities: Land Use Legislation and Controls of Conflicts of Interest in Land Use Decision Making, by Ken Baar, Ph.D. [[Institute for Transportation and Development Policy]], New York NY 10001, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cincinnati-suburbs-tract-housing.jpg|thumb|US-style housing division.]]

Settlements that provide a dense road network consisting of [[grid plan|interconnected]] [[street]]s will tend to be viable utility cycling environments. In contrast, other communities may use a [[cul-de-sac]] based, [[housing estate]]/[[housing subdivision]] model where minor roads are disconnected and only feed into a [[street hierarchy]] of progressively more "arterial" type roads. Such communities may discourage cycling by imposing unnecessary detours and forcing all cyclists onto arterial roads, which may be perceived as busy and dangerous, for all trips regardless of destination or purpose.&lt;ref name="MfSUK2007"&gt;[http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/sustainable/manforstreets/ Manual for Streets], {{ISBN|978-0-7277-3501-0}} UK Department for Transport, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

There is evidence that people who live in such estates are heavier than people who live in places where walking and cycling are more convenient. It is also reported that the extra motor-traffic such communities generate tends to increase overall per-capita traffic casualty rates. Designs that propose to resolve the contradiction between the cul-de-sac and the traditional interconnected network, such as the [[Fused Grid]], have been proposed and built with varying levels of success.&lt;ref&gt;Durning 1996 cited in Safe Travels, Evaluating Mobility Management Traffic Safety Impacts by Todd Litman &amp; Steven Fitzroy Victoria Transport Policy Institute, 1250 Rudlin Street, Victoria, BC, V8V 3R7, CANADA&lt;/ref&gt; Particular issues have arisen with personal security and public order problems in some housing schemes using "back alley" or "back garden" type links. The UK ''Manual for Roads'' (2007) states: "The basic tenet is ‘public fronts and private backs’. Ideally, and certainly, in terms of crime prevention, back gardens should adjoin other back gardens or a secure communal space. ... If streets are bounded by back-garden fences or hedges, security problems can increase, drivers may be encouraged to speed, land is inefficiently used, and there is a lack of a sense of place.".&lt;ref name="MfSUK2007" /&gt;{{rp|p56}}&lt;!-- Alleyways and personal security Section 4.6.2 Crime prevention --&gt;

[[File:Conflict-free bicycle path in Utrecht.JPG|thumb|The ''Fietspad'' in the Netherlands, safe cycling avoiding conflict as seen in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]]. Protected from traffic and safe for utility cycling.]]

Cycling is a common mode of transport in the [[Netherlands]], with 36% of the people listing the bicycle as their most frequent mode of transport on a typical day &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=December 2014 |title=Quality of Transport report |url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_422a_en.pdf |publisher=[[European Commission]] |page=11 |docket= |accessdate=29 December 2016 |quote= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908145406/http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_422a_en.pdf |archivedate=September 8, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref| Up from 31% naming the bike their main mode of transport for daily activities in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-23587916 |title=Why is cycling so popular in the Netherlands? |publisher=[[BBC News]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307050642/http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-23587916 |archive-date=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report|author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=March 2011 |title=Future of Transport report |url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/flash/fl_312_en.pdf |publisher=[[European Commission]] |page=8 |docket= |accessdate=11 July 2015 |quote= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307050642/http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/flash/fl_312_en.pdf |archivedate=March 7, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; |group="nb"}} as opposed to the [[car]] by 45% and [[public transport]] by 11%. Cycling has a [[modal share]] of 27% of all trips (urban and rural) nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Cycling in the Netherlands |url=http://www.fietsberaad.nl/library/repository/bestanden/CyclingintheNetherlands2009.pdf |location=The Netherlands |publisher=Ministry of Transport, Public Works and Water Management |agency=Fietsberaad (Expertise Centre for Cycling Policy) |date=2009 |accessdate=2014-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This high modal share for bicycle travel is enabled by unusually flat [[topography]], excellent [[cycling infrastructure]] such as [[cycle path]]s, [[cycle track]]s, [[protected intersection]]s, ample [[bicycle parking]] and by making cycling routes shorter, quicker and more direct than car routes.

In the countryside, a growing number of inter-city bicycle paths connect the Netherlands' villages, towns and cities: some of these paths are part of the [[Dutch National Cycle Routes|Dutch National Cycle Network]], a network of routes for [[Bicycle touring|bicycle tourism]] which reaches all corners of the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Netherlands, a great destination for cycling holidays|url=http://www.nederlandfietsland.nl/en/long-distance-cycle-routes|work=Nederland Fietsland website|accessdate=14 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cities modal share for bicycles is even higher, such as [[Cycling in Amsterdam|Amsterdam]] which has 38%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cycling facts and figures|url=http://www.iamsterdam.com/en-GB/Media-Centre/city-hall/dossier-cycling/Cycling-facts-and-figures|work=I amsterdam website|accessdate=9 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512214416/http://www.iamsterdam.com/en-GB/Media-Centre/city-hall/dossier-cycling/Cycling-facts-and-figures|archive-date=12 May 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marketing: the public image of cycling ==
As with other activities, cycling can be [[Promotion (marketing)|promoted]] by [[marketing]].  Promotors may include official agencies and authorities.

=== Positive marketing of cycling ===
Two themes predominate in cycling promotion 1) the benefits for the cyclist and 2) the benefits for society and the environment that may occur if more people choose to cycle. The benefits for the cyclist tend to focus issues like reduced journey times in congested urban conditions and the health benefits which the cyclist obtains through regular exercise. Societal benefits focus on general environmental and public health issues. Promotional messages and tactics may include:
* financial savings on transportation
* keeping travel times predictable; in peak traffic, cycling can be the fastest way of moving around town
* ensuring best use of the space available (during trips and also while parked), therefore reducing congestion on the roads
* reminding people of the advantages in terms of health and of effectiveness of using the bicycle
* making maps of journeys that can be completed by bicycle
* reduction of harmful emissions by fewer people driving [[motor vehicles]]
* reducing demand for oil-based fuels
* the [[safety in numbers]] effect if more people cycle
* reduced [[noise pollution]] in urban areas
* amusement
* cyclist health &lt;ref name=Mueller&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
** lowering the risk of [[cardiovascular disease]] (when practised for more than a quarter of an hour a day at a moderate pace) and therefore improvement of individual and public health
** using cycling to tackle the [[obesity]] crisis facing rich countries
** the financial savings for society if general health improves

=== Negative marketing of utility cycling ===
Various interests may wish to portray a negative image of utility cycling on public roads for various reasons. Some governments, wishing to promote private car use, have organized and funded publicity designed to discourage road cycling. Official road safety organisations have been accused of distributing literature that emphasizes the danger of cycling on roads while failing to address attitudinal issues among the drivers of motor vehicles who are the main source of road danger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyclecheltenham.org.uk/news/0302cc.pdf Government helmet campaign could frighten cyclists off the road], Cheltenham cyclist, Summer 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyclenetwork.org.uk/news/ccn65.pdf Two-headed ministry threatens future of cycling] Cycle Campaign Network News, Issue No. 65 July 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ctc.org.uk/resources/Campaigns/0405_AC_ChoosingHealth_con.doc CTC submission to Choosing Health? A consultation on action to improve people’s health], CTC submission to the Wanless review, Cyclists Touring Club, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Some road safety authorities have been accused of having a deliberate policy of discouraging cycling as a means of reducing bicyclist casualty statistics. In 2003, [[Shanghai]] police officials released statements blaming cyclists as the cause of "gridlock" in the city and promoting plans to ban cyclists from the city streets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2003/TRAVEL/12/09/china.bike.ban.ap/ Travel: Bike ban for Shanghai], CNN.Com Tuesday, 9 December 2003 (Accessed 28 October 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in the 1970s, the authorities in the city of [[Jakarta]] declared "war" on the "becak" or Indonesian [[cycle rickshaw]] blaming them for traffic congestion among other things.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zerocouriers.com/workbike/research/Becak.pdf The Becak: A Re(d)ordered Cycle]
Rebecca Lemaire, School of Oriental and African Studies, London, April 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

As with other sellers of [[Final goods|consumer goods]], the car industry's marketing efforts frequently try to associate the use of their product with a perception of increased [[social status]]. Observers in some car-focused cultures have noted a tendency to perceive or portray people who use bicycles as members of a social "out-group" with attributed negative connotations.&lt;ref&gt;Drivers' perceptions of cyclists, Basford, Reid, Lester, Thomson and Tolmie, TRL Report TRL549, Transport Research Laboratory, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; In such cultures, such attitudes are displayed in attacks on cyclists in the media.  Common themes include blanket descriptions of cyclists as a group who do not pay taxes, who break the law and who have no, or reduced, "right" to use public roads.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.woj.com.au/anti-cyclist-media-bias/ Anti-cyclist media bias] Wheels of Justice (Accessed 2 December 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Retail policy ===
If significant use of bicycles for [[Shopping|shopping]] trips is to be achieved, sufficient retail services must be maintained within reasonable cycling distances of residential areas. In countries like [[Denmark]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Germany]] the high levels of utility cycling also includes shopping trips e.g. 9% of all shopping trips in Germany are by bicycle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.einkaufen-mit-dem-rad.de/shopping_by_bike.shtml Shopping by bike], BUND Freunde der erde, Landesverband Berlin e.V (Accessed 28 October 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; It is arguable that this is related to policies that favour access to retail services by non-motorised modes. The Danish 1997 Planning Act requires that planning shall encourage a diverse mix of retail shops in small and medium-sized towns and in individual districts of large cities and ensure that retail trade uses will be placed in locations to which people have good access by walking, bicycling and public transport. From the mid-1970s the Netherlands has had policies in place to severely restrict the growth of large out-of-town retail developments.&lt;ref name="baar1" /&gt; Germany has had federal planning regulations in place to restrict retail uses to designated areas since the 1960s. In addition, since the 1970s federal regulations have been in place specifying that developments above a certain size (1,200&amp;nbsp;m²) be assessed regarding potential adverse effects. These federal regulations are further strengthened by regionally adopted regulations. This includes regulations specifying that new retail centers be limited to selling products not readily provided by shops at inner city/town center locations.&lt;ref name="baar1" /&gt; In Denmark, the Netherlands, and Germany, this approach not restricted to planning guidelines and is also supported by a ban on below-cost selling.&lt;ref&gt;The Groceries Order – Essential for Competition, Consumer Choice and Value, The Retail Grocery, Dairy And Allied Trades' Association, RGDATA, Dublin, Ireland, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; This supports smaller shops by preventing large multiples from engaging in [[predatory pricing]] practices by aggressively discounting key goods to use as so-called [[loss leader]]s.

==== Alternative retail policies ====
From the 1980s to mid-1990s the UK operated a system of ''[[laissez-faire]]'' with regard to retail policy. The "[[Roads for Prosperity|great car economy]]" philosophy of the [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher]] government directly favored the growth of out-of-town retail centers at the expense of established retail services in British towns and cities. The UK [[Town and Country Planning Association]] cites research by the [[New Economics Foundation]] that notes a continuing process of change in retail provision.&lt;ref&gt;Planning for Accessible and Sustainable Retail, The Town and Country Planning Association, July 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[General store]]s are closing at the rate of one per day.
* Between 1997–2002, specialized stores, including butchers, bakers, [[fishmonger]]s, and newsagents, closed at the rate of 50 per week.
* Nearly 30,000 independent food, drink, and tobacco retailers, or over 40%, have been lost over the past decade.

It is arguable that in such a retail/planning policy environment use of bicycles ceases to be a viable option for many shoppers and access to a private motor-car or public transport becomes a necessary prerequisite for access to basic services.

== Cycle training ==
Cycle training is another measure that is advocated as a means of maintaining or increasing levels of cycle use. The training involves teaching existing or potential cyclists bike handling, various roadcraft or [[vehicular cycling|"cyclecraft" skills (vehicular cycling)]] and educating them on the safe, lawful use of the roads. Bicycle training schemes can be differentiated according to whether they are aimed at children or adults.

In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], the now superseded ''National Cycle Proficiency'' scheme was focused on primary schoolchildren aged 8 and above. In this, children would start by gaining an off-road certificate working up to their on-road certificate by the age of ten. Initial training and examination took place on simulated road layouts within school playgrounds. This approach has now been supplemented by the new ''National Standard'' for cycle training which is more focussed on practical on-road training.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyclingengland.co.uk/training2.php Bikeability – The new National Standard for Cycle Training], Cycling England, 2006 (Accessed 2007-02-22)&lt;/ref&gt; This is part of Cycling England's portfolio of practical assistance to local authorities and other bodies, aimed at achieving their aim of "More cycling, more safely, more often".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyclingengland.co.uk/ More people cycling, more safely, more often], Cycling England, 2006 (Accessed 2007-02-22)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], the [[League of American Bicyclists]] '''Smart Cycling 101/201''' courses, based on the [[Effective Cycling]] program, has modules aimed at all ages from children to adult beginners to more experienced adults. It is argued that such schemes do not just build confidence in the students but also make it more likely that parents will let their children cycle to school. Cycle training may also be offered in an attempt to overcome cultural unfamiliarity with cycling or perceived cultural obstacles to bicycle use. In the Netherlands, some cycle training courses are targeted at women from immigrant communities, as a means of overcoming such obstacles to cycling by women from developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;Get on your bike! Bicycle- and traffic lessons for foreigners in Tilburg, the Netherlands, Angela van der Kloof, Centre for Foreign Women, Velomondial Conference Proceedings, Amsterdam 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

== User associations ==
[[File:Estacio bicing bcn.jpg|thumb|'''[[Bicing]]''' station in [[Barcelona]]]]As with other walks of life, utility cyclists may form associations in order to promote and develop cycling as an everyday form of transport. The [[European Cyclists' Federation]] is the umbrella body for such groups in Europe. These associations may lobby various institutions to encourage political support or to oppose measures that they judge counter-productive, such as to oppose the introduction of compulsory [[bicycle helmet]] legislation.
== Free bicycle/Short term hire schemes ==
{{Main|Bicycle-sharing system}}
Local bike-sharing schemes, a business which blossomed at the turn of the 21st century, are more oriented to utility cycling than other [[bike rental]]s.

== Influence of technology ==
[[File:PBSC Urban Solutions - Boost.png|thumb|A model pedal assisted electrically powered bicycle&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://betterbikeshare.org/2016/03/07/bike-shares-next-big-thing-electric-assist/|title=Electric assist might be bike share’s next big thing|date=2016-03-07|website=Better Bike Share|access-date=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Modern bicycle technology supports the shift towards utility cycling:
* easy-running thick tires or damped springs allow cycling over curbs
* dynamo, brakes, and gears improved and increased the riding safety, allowing usage also for elderly
* electric support was further developed in [[motorized bicycle]] or [[electric power-assist system]] and eases the take up for untrained

'''Visual music''', sometimes called '''colour music''', refers to the use of musical structures in visual imagery, which can also include [[silent film]]s or silent [[Lumia (art)|Lumia]] work. It also refers to methods or devices which can translate sounds or music into a related visual presentation. An expanded definition may include the translation of music to painting; this was the original definition of the term, as coined by [[Roger Fry]] in 1912 to describe the work of [[Wassily Kandinsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/3653012/The-man-who-heard-his-paintbox-hiss.html|title=The man who heard his paintbox hiss|first=Ossian|last=Ward|date=9 June 2006|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a variety of definitions of visual music, particularly as the field continues to expand. In some recent writing, usually in the [[fine art]] world, visual music is often confused with or defined as [[synaesthesia]], though historically this has never been a definition of visual music. Visual music has also been defined as a form of [[intermedia]].

Visual music also refers to systems which convert music or sound directly into visual forms, such as [[film]], [[video]], [[computer graphics]], installations or performances by means of a mechanical instrument, an artist's interpretation, or a computer. The reverse is applicable also, literally converting images to sound by drawn objects and figures on a film's soundtrack, in a technique known as drawn or [[graphical sound]]. Famous visual music artists include [[Jordan Belson]], [[Oskar Fischinger]], [[Norman McLaren]], [[John Whitney Sr.]], and [[Thomas Wilfred]], plus a number contemporary artists. 

==Instruments==

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Since ancient times artists have longed to create with moving lights a music for the eye comparable to the effects of sound for the ear.''&lt;br&gt;&amp;ndash; Dr. [[William Moritz]], the best-known historian of ''visual music'' writing in English, his speciality being the work of [[Oskar Fischinger]].&lt;ref name="CVMWM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centerforvisualmusic.org/TAVM.htm|title=Towards an Aesthetics of Visual Music|last=Moritz|first=William|year=1986|publisher=ASIFA Canada Bulletin,|accessdate=15 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sometimes also called "'''color music'''", the history of this tradition includes many experiments with [[color organ]]s. Artist or inventors "built instruments, usually called 'color organs,' that would display modulated colored light in some kind of fluid fashion comparable to music".&lt;ref&gt;Moritz, W, (1997), [http://www.awn.com/mag/issue2.1/articles/moritz2.1.html The Dream of Color Music, And Machines That Made it Possible] in  Animation World Magazine&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the ''Farblichtspiele'' ('coloured-light-plays') of former [[Bauhaus]] student [[Ludwig Hirschfeld Mack]]. Several different definitions of color music exist; one is that color music is generally formless projections of colored light. Some scholars and writers have used the term color music interchangeably with visual music.

The construction of instruments to perform visual music live, as with sonic music, has been a continuous concern of this art. Color organs, while related, form an earlier tradition extending as early as the eighteenth century with the Jesuit [[Louis Bertrand Castel]] building an ''ocular harpsichord'' in the 1730s (visited by [[Georg Philipp Telemann]], who composed for it). Other prominent color organ artist-inventors include: [[Alexander Wallace Rimington]], [[Bainbridge Bishop]], [[Thomas Wilfred]], [[Charles Dockum]], [[Mary Hallock-Greenewalt]] and [[Kurt Laurenz Theinert]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

==On film==
Visual music and abstract film or video often coincide. Some of the earliest known films of these two genres were hand-painted works produced by the Futurists [[Bruno Corra]]&lt;ref&gt;{{IMdB name|id=0180651|title=Bruno Corra}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Arnaldo Ginna]] between 1911 and 1912 (as they report in the [[futurism (art)|Futurist Manifesto of Cinema]]), which are now lost. [[Mary Hallock-Greenewalt]] produced several reels of [[Direct Films|hand-painted films]] (although not traditional [[film|motion pictures]]) that are held by the Historical Society of Philadelphia. Like the Futurist films, and many other visual music films, her 'films' were meant to be a visualization of [[musical form]].

Notable visual music filmmakers include: [[Walter Ruttmann]], [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]], [[Viking Eggeling]], [[Oskar Fischinger]], [[Len Lye]], [[Jordan Belson]], [[Norman McLaren]], [http://www.centerforvisualmusic.org/Bute.htm Mary Ellen Bute] (who made a series of films she called Seeing Sound films), [[Harry Everett Smith|Harry Smith]], [[Hy Hirsh]], [[John Whitney (animator)|John]] and [[James Whitney (filmmaker)|James Whitney]], [[Steven Woloshen]] and many others up to present day.

In 2005, a US exhibition called "Visual Music" at the [[Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art]] and The [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden]] in Washington DC included documentation of color organs and featured many visual music films&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centerforvisualmusic.org/VMFilms.htm|title=VMfilms|author=|date=|website=www.centerforvisualmusic.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and videos as well as paintings and some color organs.

The [[Center for Visual Music]] [http://www.centerforvisualmusic.org] in Los Angeles has the world's largest collection of visual music resources. CVM owns the papers, films and much animation artwork of Oskar Fischinger; the original research collection of visual music historian Dr. William Moritz; numerous restored films by Jordan Belson; and an extensive collection of restored films by Mary Ellen Bute, John and James Whitney, Jules Engel, Charles Dockum and others. CVM consulted for and provided films, stills and research for the above-mentioned blockbuster Visual Music exhibition; CVM now provides visual music films, programs, events and talks to museums, archives, festivals and cultural centres worldwide, in addition to curating and developing its own museum exhibitions (recently, Oskar Fischinger: Experiments in Cinematic Abstraction, in Amsterdam). The Fischinger three-projector reconstruction, Raumlichtkunst, was restored and curated by CVM, and has been exhibited at the Whitney Museum NY, Tate Modern London, Len Lye Centre New Zealand, and other museums and galleries worldwide. CVM recently released the second [http://www.centerforvisualmusic.org/Fischinger/newdvd.htm Oskar Fischinger DVD], as well as a compilation Visual Music from CVM Archive DVD with films by Jordan Belson, Bute, Dockum, Engel and Barry Spinello.  A summer 2018 CVM Visual Music symposium in California is being organized.

Artist  [[Larry Cuba]], founded the iota Fund in 1994, which was later called iotaCenter. They currently own the films of such artists as [[Sara Petty]], [[Adam Beckett]], some of the films of [[Jules Engel]], [[Sky David]], [[Robert Darroll]] and others. They hosted the renowned Kinetica programs (1999–2003) touring the world introducing new audiences to the wonders of visual music.

==Computer graphics==

[[Image:Oscilloscope diagram.png|thumb|right|Oscilloscope showing a single pitch, a [[sine wave]]]] The [[cathode ray tube]] made possible the [[oscilloscope]], an early electronic device that can produce images that are easily associated with sounds from microphones. The modern [[Laser lighting display]] displays wave patterns produced by similar circuitry. The imagery used to represent audio in [[digital audio workstation]]s is largely based on familiar oscilloscope patterns.
 
The [[Animusic]] company (originally called 'Visual Music') has repeatedly demonstrated the use of computers to convert music &amp;mdash;  principally pop-rock based and composed as [[MIDI]] events &amp;mdash; to animations. Graphic artist-designed [[virtual instrumentation|virtual instruments]] which either play themselves or are played by virtual objects are all, along with the sounds, controlled by MIDI instructions.&lt;ref name="ralberts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitalmedia.oreilly.com/2006/03/22/animusic-computer-music-videos.html|title=Inside Animusic's Astonishing Computer Music Videos|last=Alberts|first=Randy|date=March 22, 2006|publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc|accessdate=15 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the image-to-sound sphere, [[MetaSynth]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uisoftware.com/MetaSynth/index.php|title=MetaSynth 5 for Mac OS|author=|date=|website=www.uisoftware.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; includes a feature which converts images to sounds. The tool uses drawn or imported bitmap images, which can be manipulated with graphic tools, to generate new sounds or process existing audio. A reverse function allows the creation of images from sounds.&lt;ref name="sasso1005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emusician.com/mag/emusic_ui_softwaremetasynth_mac/|title=U&amp;I SOFTWARE MetaSynth 4 (Mac)|last=Sasso|first=Len|date=Oct 1, 2005|publisher=Electronic Musician|accessdate=15 June 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100301051808/http://emusician.com/mag/emusic_ui_softwaremetasynth_mac/|archive-date=1 March 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some media player software generates animated imagery or [[music visualization]] based on a piece of recorded music:
*autom@ted_VisualMusiC_ 4.0 planned and realized by [[Sergio Maltagliati]]. This program can be configured to create random multiple visual-music variations, starting from a simple sonorous/visual cell. It generates a new and original audio-visual composition each time play is clicked.

==Virtual reality==
With the increasing popularity of [[Head-mounted display|head mounted displays]] for virtual reality &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wearabletechworld.com/topics/wearable-tech/articles/416177-tractica-expect-big-sales-vr-head-mounted-displays.htm|title=Tractica: Expect Big Sales of VR Head-Mounted Displays|author=|date=|website=www.wearabletechworld.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/458037/virtual-reality-headsets-unit-sales-worldwide/|title=Global VR headset sales by brand 2016-2017 - Statistic|author=|date=|website=Statista}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studiodaily.com/2017/01/how-big-is-the-installed-base-for-virtual-reality/|title=How Big Is the Installed Base for Virtual Reality? - Studio Daily|author=|date=11 January 2017|website=studiodaily.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is an emerging new platform for visual music. While some developers have been focused on the impact of [[virtual reality]] on live music &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/mach/innovation/how-virtual-reality-redefining-live-music-n687786|title=How virtual reality is redefining live music|author=|date=|website=nbcnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; or on the possibilities for [[music video]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/04/virtual-insanity-vr-new-frontier-music-videos-waves|title=Virtual insanity: is VR the new frontier for music videos?|first=Brian|last=Moylan|date=4 August 2016|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; virtual reality is also an emerging field for [[music visualization]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/vr-music-visualizers-are-like-tripping-without-drugs-1712457576|title=VR Music Visualizers Are Like Tripping Without Drugs|first=Chris|last=Mills|date=|website=gizmodo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/28/10675270/gear-vr-virtual-reality-music-visualizer-groovr|title=Does anybody really want a virtual reality music visualizer?|author=|date=|website=theverge.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groovr.com/|title=GrooVR Music Driven Virtual Reality - Music Visualizer|author=|date=|website=groovr.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2015/06/17/harmonix-music-vr-coming-to-project-morpheus/|title=PlayStation.Blog|author=|date=|website=PlayStation.Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; and visual music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/music/2013/04/01/inventor-updates-creation-bring-vision-music/4KRSQ8c35h4ejqSU2Zk4EO/story.html|title=Inventor updates ’70s creation to bring 3-D vision to music - The Boston Globe|author=|date=|website=bostonglobe.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Graphic notation==
Many composers have applied [[graphic notation (music)|graphic notation]] to write compositions. Pioneering examples are the graphical scores of [[John Cage]] and [[Morton Feldman]]. Also known is the graphical score of [[György Ligeti]]s [[Artikulation (Ligeti)|Artikulation]] designed by Rainer Wehinger.

Musical theorists such as [[Harry Partch]], [[Erv Wilson]], [[Ivor Darreg]], [[Glenn Branca]], and [[Yuri Landman]] applied [[geometry]] in detailed visual musical diagrams explaining [[microtonal]] structures and [[musical scale]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4490">A '''waste pond''' or '''chemical pond''' is a small impounded water body used for the disposal of [[water pollutant]]s, and sometimes utilized as a method of [[recycling]] or decomposing [[toxic]] substances.  Such waste ponds may be used for regular disposal of pollutant materials or may be used as upset receivers for special pollution events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/event-status/event/2003/20030314en.html|title=U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission details of handling certain upset events|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Often, chemical ponds themselves are addressed for [[Environmental remediation|cleanup]] action after their useful life is over or when a risk of [[groundwater]] contamination arises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/r10/nplpad.nsf/0/cb601d3cf3b34eb6852565950047dc53!OpenDocument|title=Idaho National Laboratory: U.S. Department of Energy, EPA ID# ID4890008952|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Peak usage of waste ponds in the United States occurred in the period 1955 to 1985, after which the environmental risks of pond technology were sufficiently understood,&lt;ref&gt;David Crimp, Leda Patmore et al., ''Environmental Assessment of Kaiser Refractories Waste Pond, Moss Landing, California'', Earth Metrics Inc., Santa Cruz County, California and the State of California Environmental Clearinghouse (1976)&lt;/ref&gt; such that alternative technologies{{what?|date=November 2018}} for waste disposal gradually began to displace many of the waste ponds.   Waste ponds often have pond liners, such as [[concrete]] or robust synthetic [[polymer]]ic materials, to prevent [[Infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]] of [[chemical]]s to soil or groundwater.

==Examples==
===Piscataway chemical pond===
One example of a chemical pond is situated in the woods of [[Piscataway, New Jersey]]. It was used by [[Union Carbide]] during the active phase of plant operation. Its main use was for drainage of chemicals. Hazardous and exotic chemicals would go down drains in the plant to the pond and later be pumped back to the factory via two large pumps. There it would be distilled to remove [[acetone]] and other hazardous chemicals from the mix. This process was overall harmful to the environment and polluted the [[groundwater]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://maps.google.com/maps?q=&amp;sll=39.103157,-94.634514&amp;sspn=0.126284,0.233459&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;om=1&amp;z=17&amp;ll=40.556656,-74.498055&amp;spn=0.003864,0.010815&amp;t=h&amp;iwloc=addr|title=Google Maps|website=Google Maps}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oak Ridge waste pond===
The United States [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] operated for more than 50 years, performing research and production at its facility in the Melton Valley area of the Oak Ridge Reservation, in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], before it was decommissioned in the mid 1960s.  One of the results of this activity was a waste pond, which was contaminated with [[radioactive]] waste including [[strontium-90]], [[caesium-137]]; [[tritium]], and [[transuranium element|transuranics]].
During the 1970s, the pond was backfilled with [[clay]] and [[shale]], and finally capped with [[Asphalt concrete|asphalt]]. 

In the mid 1990s, as a temporary solution to concerns that soil and sediments could migrate into nearby streams and, ultimately, reservoirs used for recreation and [[drinking water]] supplies, [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] officials installed a [[cryogenics|cryogenic]] stabilization system at the waste pond, freezing the soil and groundwater to a depth of approximately {{convert|30|ft|m}} around the pond, thereby forming a barrier to groundwater leaching. 

In February 2004, the cryogenic system was dismantled, replaced with a temporary thermal foam blanket to keep the soil cold, and the pond was excavated.  The soil in the areas surrounding the frozen pond contained lower [[soil contamination|levels of contamination]] than the pond itself, but enough contamination that it had to be removed.  Approximately {{convert|10000|cuyd|m3}} of soil were removed from the surrounding areas. Another {{convert|5400|cuyd|m3}} of soil were excavated from the pond itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cegltd.com/story.asp?story=5541 Gwenyth Laird Pernie, ''Crew Takes on Chemical Pond'', Construction Equipment Guide (2005)]&lt;/ref&gt;
