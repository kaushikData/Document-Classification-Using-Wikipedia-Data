Andrew Cook is also occasionally called upon by the national press to comment on economic crises and situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Edgar|first1=Richard|title=UK steelmaking: A perfect storm of oversupply and lack of demand|url=http://www.itv.com/news/2015-10-20/uk-steelmaking-a-perfect-storm-of-oversupply-and-lack-of-demand/|accessdate=21 June 2016|publisher=itv.com|date=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marsh|first1=Peter|title=How a Sheffield steel-casting maker survives|url=http://video.ft.com/836687274001/How-a-Sheffield-steel-casting-maker-survives/Companies|accessdate=21 June 2016|work=Financial Times|date=18 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary career==
Andrew Cook is a published author, with several books and papers to his name.
In 1999, his first book, ''Thrice Through the Fire'', a history of the William Cook company from 1985 to 1998, was published as a sequel to Philip Hansen's book, ''The History of the William Cook Company and the Cook Family'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hansen|first1=Phillip|title=A History of the William Cook Company and the Cook Family from the 18th Century to 1985|date=1998|publisher=William Cook Publishing Limited|isbn=978-0953151103}}&lt;/ref&gt; which covered the company's history up to 1985 and to which Andrew Cook contributed substantially. ''Thrice Through the Fire'' was written after a thirteen-year period of exponential growth for the Company, seeing them become the world leader in steel castings, thanks to Andrew Cook's successful "re-launch" of the company soon after he became Chairman in 1981.

In 2008, concerned that there would be an energy crisis in the next decade and "on the Conservative watch" as he described it, Andrew Cook financed and co-wrote (with Professor Ian Fells CBE, an acknowledged energy expert) ''A Pragmatic Energy Policy for the UK''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Pragmatic Energy Policy for the UK|url=http://fellsassociates.awardspace.com/site/LinkedDocuments/Pragmatic%20Energy%20Policy1.pdf|publisher=Fells Associates|accessdate=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a private launch to Charles Hendry, then shadow energy secretary, the publication was launched nationally at the Royal Institution. Many of its predictions have come to pass.{{peacock term|date=January 2017}}

The year 2011 saw the publication of Andrew Cook's second and third books: ''Ashes and Dust'', a book of recollections and reflections, events and experiences, from various times to 2011; and ''Coal, Steam and Comfort- 141R568 and the Swiss Classic Train'', an account of a train restoration project he had undertaken over the 5-year period 2005 to 2010.
In 2015, he published his fourth book, ''The Doctors of Ulm and other stories''.

It initially attracted many leading Democrats, but was unable to supplant Tammany Hall, which became reinvigorated under the leadership of [[John Kelly (New York politician)|John Kelly]] after the fall of Boss Tweed.  Since Apollo Hall Democracy nominated its own set of candidates, the Democratic vote was split, allowing the Republicans to win many of the elections.  By the mid-1870s, many frustrated members of Apollo Hall Democracy such as its former chairman [[William H. Wickham]] and [[William Collins Whitney]] joined Tammany Hall, causing Apollo Hall Democracy to fall into irrelevance.

'''Asia-Japan Women's Resource Center''' (AJWRC) is a [[non-governmental organisation]] founded in 1994 that advocates [[gender equality]], the end of violence against women, a more just society, and environmentally [[sustainable development]].

AJWRC holds events like empowerment seminars and study groups for women, training and workshops, and they also publish research and conduct outreach campaigns in furtherance of their mission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humantrafficking.org/organizations/141 HumanTrafficking.org organization overview] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130323002845/http://www.humantrafficking.org/organizations/141 |date=March 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The activities serve to raise awareness among Japanese women of global as well as domestic issues. Because [[Japan]] is a leading nation in the Asian economy and international politics, the organisation feels an obligation to encourage Japanese women to take a leading role in advocacy for improved [[human rights]]. Additionally, Japan is the destination for the largest number of cross-border [[human trafficking]] victims in [[Asia]], which AJWRC takes as further impetus for their mission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aworc.org/org/ajwrc/ajwrc.html AWORC member profile]&lt;/ref&gt;

Disparity between genders has been shrinking in most developed countries over the last century, but AJWRC holds that Japan has lagged behind the trend. As examples, women represent a mere 10% of the [[National Diet]], [[Japan]]'s legislative body, and women earn just 60% of the salary of their male counterparts in the workforce.

AJWRC grew out of the Asian Women's Association, which was founded in 1977, when gender inequality was even more severe. It wasn't until 1985 that the Japanese government ratified a [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]],&lt;ref&gt;Yuji Iwasawa. ''International Law, Human Rights, and Japanese Law.'' Page 206.&lt;/ref&gt; and the country received failing marks as late as 1986 in [[Humana]]'s ''World Human Rights Guide''&lt;ref name=Iwasawa234&gt;Yuji Iwasawa. ''International Law, Human Rights, and Japanese Law.'' Page 234.&lt;/ref&gt; regarding the status of women, and is one of the industrialized world's least equal countries in terms of gender gap.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GenderGap_Report_2011.pdf WEF Gender Gap Report]. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The AWA initially focused on protesting the [[sex trade]], but as their influence grew, they expanded their mandate to tackle women's issues more broadly in the country, eventually forming AJWRC as it is today. According to the group's website, they work "to end all forms of violence and discrimination against women, toward democratic Japanese society based on respect for [[human rights]] and gender equality, and toward a fair and sustainable global society."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajwrc.org/eng/modules/pico1/index.php?content_id=1 AJWRC Mission Statement]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="metropolis"&gt;Jessica Ocheltree, [http://metropolis.co.jp/features/global-village/asia-japan-womens-resource-center/ Asia-Japan Women’s Resource Center], Metropolis, 9 Dec 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Colin David Butler''' is a co-founder of the [[non-governmental organization]] BODHI (Benevolent Organisation for Development, Health and Insight), which has autonomous branches in the United States and Australia.  Butler was a professor of [[public health]] at the [[University of Canberra]] from November 2012 until July 2016.&lt;ref name="UC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canberra.edu.au/research/faculty-research-centres/ceraph/staff-and-postgraduate-students/staff-list/butler-colin |title=Butler, Prof. Colin |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=www.canberra.edu.au |publisher=University of Canberra |access-date=December 26, 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a visiting fellow at the National Centre for Epidemiology &amp; Population Health at [[Australian National University]],&lt;ref name="ANU"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://find.anu.edu.au/search?filter=0&amp;client=anu_frontend&amp;proxystylesheet=anu_frontend&amp;site=default_collection&amp;btnG=Search&amp;q=colin+butler&amp;search1=Go |title=Professor Colin Butler |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=December 15, 2015 |website=www.anu.edu.au |publisher=Australian National University |access-date=December 26, 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a former senior research fellow in global health at the School of Health and Social Development at [[Deakin University]].

Butler studies the intersection of [[sustainability]], [[globalization]], and health.  His main research interest lies in trying to find ways to advance sustainable global health.&lt;ref name="UC" /&gt;

==Training and education==
Butler obtained a [[Bachelor of Medical Sciences]] (Hons) degree in 1984 and a [[Bachelor of Medicine]] degree in 1987, both from the University of Newcastle, NSW, Australia.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

In 1985, prior to his final year of medical school, he spent ten months outside of Australia, mostly studying health issues in low-income countries. This included time in Nigeria with the health arms of two Christian missions, as well as the [[University of Ilorin]], and in Nepal with the Britain Nepal Medical Trust. After graduating, he worked for several years in rural [[general practice]] in [[Tasmania]].  His longstanding interest in global health led him to pursue a [[DTM&amp;H|Diploma in Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (DTM&amp;H)]], which he received from the [[Royal College of Physicians]] in 1990.  In 1997, he obtained a [[Master of Science]] degree in epidemiology from the [[London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine]].&lt;ref name="UC" /&gt; While there, his main mentor was professor [[Tony McMichael]].

In 2002, Butler completed a multidisciplinary [[PhD]] at the [[Australian National University]], entitled "Inequality and sustainability".&lt;ref&gt;https://digitalcollections.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/46233&lt;/ref&gt; His thesis argued that the unequal distribution of global political and economic influence facilitates "environmental brinkmanship," whereby the wealthy and powerful risk global environmental change of a degree that threatens the fabric of civilization.&lt;ref name="ANU" /&gt; These ideas are components of what has recently been called "planetary health."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |author=The Rockefeller Foundation–Lancet Commission |date=July 16, 2015 |title=Safeguarding human health in the Anthropocene epoch: Report of The Rockefeller Foundation–Lancet Commission on planetary health |url=http://www.thelancet.com/commissions/planetary-health |publisher=Lancet |page= |docket= |accessdate=December 26, 2015 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While studying for his PhD, Butler was awarded the 2001 Borrie Prize by the Australian Population Association for "the best student paper on a population-related topic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.apa.org.au/content/borrie-prize |title=The Borrie Prize |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=www.apa.org.au |publisher=Australian Population Association |access-date=December 26, 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Butler's winning essay traced the decline of [[Malthusianism|Malthusian thinking]] within [[demography]].

==Career==
In 1989, Butler co-founded BODHI with the late Susan Woldenberg.  These organizations, one in the US and one in Australia, work in the field of [[international health]], primary health care, and education.  BODHI identifies itself as one of the "oldest [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] influenced development NGO[s] based in the West."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bodhius.org |title=BODHI |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=www.bodhius.org |publisher=Benevolent Organisation for Development, Health and Insight |access-date=December 26, 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Butler was involved with the [[Millennium Ecosystem Assessment]], which was requested by [[United Nations Secretary General]] [[Kofi Annan]] in 2001.  He was also part of the "extended writing team" that authored ''Ecosystems and Human Well-Being: A Report of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |author1=Carlos Corvalan |author2=Simon Hales |author3=Anthony McMichael |date=2005 |title=Ecosystems and Human Well-Being: A Report of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment |url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/43354/1/9241563095.pdf |publisher=World Health Association |page= |docket= |accessdate=December 26, 2015 |quote= |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the French Environmental Health Association named Butler one of "a hundred doctors for the planet."&lt;ref name="UC" /&gt;

The following year, Butler was awarded an Australian Research Council Future Fellowship, which "supports research in areas of critical national importance by giving outstanding researchers incentives to conduct their research in Australia.&lt;ref name="UC2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canberra.edu.au/research/faculty-research-centres/ceraph/health-earth/founding-members/colin-butler |title=Colin Butler |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=www.canberra.edu.au |publisher=University of Canberra |access-date=December 26, 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of Future Fellowships is "to attract and retain the best and brightest mid-career researchers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arc.gov.au/future-fellowships |title=Future Fellowships |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=www.arc.gov.au |publisher=Australian Research Council of the Australian Government |access-date=December 26, 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Butler's grant project, which he completed in 2015, was entitled "Health and Sustainability: Australia in a Global Context."&lt;ref name="UC2" /&gt;

In 2014, Butler co-founded an international research network based at the University of Canberra called Health-Earth.  The network has six major research themes: [[poverty]], [[climate change]], infectious disease, [[ecosystem]] disruptions, security, and transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canberra.edu.au/research/faculty-research-centres/ceraph/health-earth |title=Health-Earth (H-Earth) |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015 |website=www.canberra.edu.au |publisher=University of Canberra |access-date=December 26, 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2014, he also became the first Australian contributor to the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] to be arrested for civil disobedience,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/canberra-university-professor-arrested-at-coal-mine-protest-20141128-11w7lq.html&lt;/ref&gt; in opposition to Australian government policies concerning climate change. Initially facing a maximum sentence of seven years in jail for allegedly damaging mining property by preventing use of a private road for 50 minutes, Butler received, instead, a two-year good behavior bond. No sentence was recorded; however, as a result of his arrest, he was refused a visa to the US in time to attend a meeting as part of the Rockefeller Foundation's Planetary Health Commission.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==Writing==
According to the University of Canberra, Butler "has published widely (now about 130 articles and chapters, 2 edited books), and given 67 invited talks overseas on topics including [[food security]], [[population growth]], [[ecology]] and [[infectious disease]]s."&lt;ref name="UC" /&gt;

'''Conservation agriculture''' (CA) can be defined by a statement given by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the [[United Nations]] as “a concept for resource-saving agricultural crop production that strives to achieve acceptable profits together with high and sustained production levels while concurrently conserving the environment” (FAO 2007).

Agriculture according to the New Standard Encyclopedia is “one of the most important sectors in the economies of most nations” (New Standard 1992). At the same time conservation is the use of resources in a manner that safely maintains a resource that can be used by humans. Conservation has become critical because the global population has increased over the years and more food needs to be produced every year (New Standard 1992). Sometimes referred to as "agricultural environmental management", conservation agriculture may be sanctioned and funded through conservation programs promulgated through agricultural legislation, such as the [[U.S. Farm Bill]].

== Key principles ==
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has determined that CA has three key principles that producers (farmers) can proceed through in the process of CA. These three principles outline what conservationists and producers believe can be done to conserve what we use for a longer period of time.

The first key principle in CA (Conservation Agriculture) is practicing minimum soil disturbance which is essential to maintaining minerals within the soil, stopping erosion, and preventing water loss from occurring within the soil. In the past agriculture has looked at soil tillage as a main process in the introduction of new crops to an area. It was believed that tilling the soil would increase fertility within the soil through mineralization that takes place in the soil. Also tilling of soil can cause severe erosion and crusting which leads to a decrease in soil fertility. Today tillage is seen as destroying organic matter that can be found within the soil cover. [[No-till farming]] has caught on as a process that can save soil organic levels for a longer period and still allow the soil to be productive for longer periods (FAO 2007). Additionally, the process of tilling can increase time and labor for producing that crop. Minimum soil disturbance also reduce destruction of soil micro and macro-organism habitats that is common in conventional ploughing practices.  

When no-till practices are followed, the producer sees a reduction in production cost for a certain crop. Tillage of the ground requires more money in order to fuel tractors or to provide feed for the animals pulling the plough. The producer sees a reduction in labor because he or she does not have to be in the fields as long as a conventional farmer.

The second key principle in CA is much like the first in dealing with protecting the soil. The principle of managing the top soil to create a permanent organic soil cover can allow for growth of organisms within the soil structure. This growth will break down the mulch that is left on the soil surface. The breaking down of this mulch will produce a high organic matter level which will act as a fertilizer for the soil surface. If CA practices were used done for many years and enough organic matter was being built up at the surface, then a layer of mulch would start to form. This layer helps prevent soil erosion from taking place and ruining the soil's profile or layout. The presence of mulching also reduce the velocity of runoff and the impact of rain drops thus reducing soil erosion and runoff.

According to the article “The role of conservation agriculture and sustainable agriculture”, the layer of mulch that is built up over time will become like a buffer zone between soil and mulch and this will help reduce wind and water erosion. With this comes the protection of the soil's surface when rain falls on the ground. Land that is not protected by a layer of mulch is left open to the elements (Hobbs et al. 2007). This type of ground cover also helps keep the temperature and moisture levels of the soil at a higher level rather than if it was tilled every year (FAO 2007).

The third principle is the practicing diverse crop rotations or crop interactions. According to an article published in the ''Physiological Transactions of the Royal Society'' called “The role of conservation agriculture and sustainable agriculture,” crop rotation can be used best as a disease control against other preferred crops (Hobbs et al. 2007). This process will not allow pests such as insects and weeds to be set into a rotation with specific crops. Rotational crops will act as a natural insecticide and herbicide against specific crops. Not allowing insects or weeds to establish a pattern will help to eliminate problems with yield reduction and infestations within fields (FAO 2007). Crop rotation can also help build up soil infrastructure. Establishing crops in a rotation allows for an extensive buildup of rooting zones which will allow for better water infiltration (Hobbs et al. 2007).

Organic molecules in the soil break down into phosphates, nitrates and other beneficial elements which are thus better absorbed by plants. Plowing increases the amount of oxygen in the soil and increases the aerobic processes, hastening the breakdown of organic material. Thus more nutrients are available for the next crop but, at the same time, the soil is depleted more quickly of its nutrient reserves.

== Examples ==
In conservation agriculture there are many examples that can be looked towards as a way of farming and at the same time conserving. These practices are well known by most producers. The process of no-till is one that follows the first principle of CA, causing minimal mechanical soil disturbance. No-till also brings other benefits to the producer . According to the FAO, tillage is one of the most “energy consuming” processes that can be used: It requires a lot of labor, time, and fuel to till. Producers can save 30% to 40% of time and labor by practicing the no-till process. (FAO 3020)

Besides conserving the soil, there are other examples of how CA is used. According to an article in ''Science'' called “Farming and the Fate of Wild Nature” there are two more kinds of CA . The practice of wildlife-friendly farming and land sparing are ideas for producers who are looking to practice better conservation towards biodiversity (Green, et al. 2005).

=== Wildlife-friendly farming ===
Wildlife-friendly farming is a practice of setting aside land that will not be developed by the producer (farmer). This land will be set aside so that biodiversity has a chance to establish itself in areas with agricultural fields. At the same time, the producer is attempting to lower the amount of fertilizer and pesticides used on the fields so that organisms and microbial activity have a chance to establish themselves in the soil and habitat (Green, et al. 2005). But as in all systems, not all can be perfect. To create a habitat suitable for biodiversity something has to be reduced, and as in this case for agriculture farmers, yields can be reduced. This is where the second idea of land sparing can be looked on as an alternative manner.

=== Land sparing ===
Land sparing is another way that producer and conservationist can be on the same page. Land sparing advocates for the land that is being used for agricultural purposes to continue to produce crops at increased yield. With an increase in yield on all land that is in use, other land can be set aside for conservation and production for biodiversity. Agricultural land stays in production but would have to increase its yield potential to keep up with demand. Land that is not being put into agriculture would be used for conserving biodiversity (Green, et al. 2005). In fact, data from the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] shows that between 1961 and 2012, the amount of arable land needed to produce the same amount of food declined by 68 percent worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Ausubel|first1=Jesse H.|author-link1=Jesse H.

== Benefits ==
In the field of CA there are many benefits that both the producer and conservationist can obtain.

On the side of the conservationist, CA can be seen as beneficial because there is an effort to conserve what people use every day. Since agriculture is one of the most destructive forces against biodiversity, CA can change the way humans produce food and energy. With conservation come environmental benefits of CA. These benefits include less erosion possibilities, better water conservation, improvement in air quality due to lower emissions being produced, and a chance for larger biodiversity in a given area.

On the side of the producer and/or farmer, CA can eventually do all that is done in conventional agriculture, and it can conserve better than conventional agriculture. CA according to Theodor Friedrich, who is a specialist in CA, believes “Farmers like it because it gives them a means of conserving, improving, and making more efficient use of their natural resources" (FAO 2006). Producers will find that the benefits of CA will come later rather than sooner. Since CA takes time to build up enough organic matter and have soils become their own fertilizer, the process does not start to work overnight. But if producers make it through the first few years of production, results will start to become more satisfactory.

CA is shown to have even higher yields and higher outputs than conventional agriculture once it has been established over long periods. Also, a producer has the benefit of knowing that the soil in which his crops are grown is a renewable resource. According to New Standard Encyclopedia, soils are a renewable resource, which means that whatever is taken out of the soil can be put back over time (New Standard 1992). As long as good soil upkeep is maintained, the soil will continue to renew itself. This could be very beneficial to a producer who is practicing CA and is looking to keep soils at a productive level for an extended time.

The farmer and/or producer can use this same land in another way when crops have been harvested. The introduction of grazing livestock to a field that once held crops can be beneficial for the producer and also the field itself. Livestock manure can be used as a natural fertilizer for a producer’s field which will then be beneficial for the producer the next year when crops are planted once again. The practice of grazing livestock using CA helps the farmer who raises crops on that field and the farmer who raises the livestock that graze off that field. Livestock produce compost or manure which are a great help in generating soil fertility (Pawley W.H. 1963). The practices of CA and grazing livestock on a field for many years can allow for better yields in the following years as long as these practices continue to be followed.
     
The FAO believes that there are three major benefits from CA: 
* Within fields that are controlled by CA the producer will see an increase in organic matter. 
* Increase in water conservation due to the layer of organic matter and ground cover to help eliminate transportation and access runoff. 
* Improvement of soil structure and rooting zone.

== Future development ==
As in any other business, producers and conservationists are always looking towards the future. In this case CA is a very important process to be looked at for future generation. There are many organizations that have been created to help educate and inform producers and conservationists in the world of CA. These organizations can help to inform, conduct research, and buy land in order to preserve animals and plants (New Standard 1992).

Another way in which CA is looking to the future is through prevention. According to the ''European Journal of Agronomy'' producers are looking for ways to reduce leaching problems within their fields. These producers are using the same principles within CA, in that they are leaving cover over their fields in order to save fields from erosion and leaching of chemicals (Kirchmann &amp; Thorvaldsson 2000). Processes and studies like this are allowing for a better understanding of how to conserve what we are using and finding ways to put back something that may have been lost before.

In the same journal article is presented another way in which producers and conservationists are looking towards the future. Circulation of plant nutrients can be a vital part for conserving the future. An example of this would be the use of animal manure. This process has been used for quite some time now, but the future is looking towards ways to handle and conserve nutrients within manure for a longer time. But besides animal waste, food and urban waste are also being looked towards as a way to use growth within CA (Kirchmann &amp; Thorvaldsson 2000). Turning these products from waste to being used to grow crops and improve yields is something that would be beneficial for conservationists and producers.

'''Agri-environment schemes'''

In 1992, ‘agri-environment schemes’ became compulsory for all European Union Member States. In the following years the main purpose of these schemes changed slightly. 
Initially, they sought to protect threatened habitats, but gradually shifted their focus to the prevention of the loss of wildlife from agricultural landscapes. Most recently, the schemes are placing more emphasis on improving the services that the land can provide to humans (e.g. pollination). Overall, farmers involved in the scheme aim to practice environmentally friendlier farming techniques such as: reducing the use of pesticides, managing or altering their land to increase more wildlife friendly habitats (e.g. increasing areas of trees and bushes), reducing irrigation, conserving soil, and organic farming. 
As the changes in practices that ensure the protection of the environment are costly to farmers, the EU developed agri-environment schemes to financially compensate individual farmers for applying these changes and therefore increased the implementation of conservation agriculture. 
The schemes are voluntary for farmers. Once joined, they commit to a minimum of five years during which they have to adopt various sustainable farming techniques.
According to the Euro-stat website, in 2009 the agricultural area enrolled in agri-environment schemes covered 38.5 million hectares (20.9% of agricultural land in the 27 member states of the EU at the time) (Agri-environmental indicator 2015). The European Commission spent a total of €3.23 billion on agri-environment schemes in 2012, significantly exceeding the cost of managing special sites of conservation (Natura 2000) that year, which came to a total of €39.6 million (Batáry et al. 2015). 
There are two main types of agri-environment schemes which have shown different outcomes. Out-of-production schemes tend to be used in [[extensive farming]] practices (where the farming land is widespread and less [[intensive farming]] is practiced), and focus on improving or setting land aside that will not be used for the production of food, for example, the addition of wildflower strips.
In-production schemes (used for a smaller scale, but more intensively farmed land) focus on the sustainable management of arable crops or grassland, for example reduction of pesticides, reduction of grassland mowing, and most commonly, organic farming. In a 2015 review of studies examining the effects of the two schemes, it was found that out-of-production schemes had a higher success rate at enhancing the number of thriving species around the land. 
The reason behind this is thought to be the scheme’s focus on enhancing specific species by providing them with more unaltered habitats, which results in more food resources for the specific species.
On the other hand, in-production schemes attempt to enhance the quality of the land in general, and are thus less species specific. 
Based on the findings, the reviewers suggest that schemes which more specifically target the declining groups of species, may be more effective. The findings and the targets will be implemented between 2015 and 2020, so that by 2025, the effectiveness of these schemes can be re-assessed and will have increased significantly (Batáry et al. 2015).

== Problems ==
As much as conservation agriculture can benefit the world, there are some problems that come with it. There are many reasons why conservation agriculture cannot always be a win-win situation.
 
There are not enough people who can financially turn from conventional farming to conservation. The process of CA takes time; when a producer first becomes a conservationist, the results can be a financial loss to them(in most cases, the investment and policy generally exist). CA is based upon establishing an organic layer and producing its own fertilizer and this may take time. It can be many years before a producer will start to see better yields than he/she has had previously. Another financial undertaking is purchasing of new equipment. When starting to use CA, a producer may have to buy new planters or drills in order to produce effectively. These financial tasks are ones that may impact whether or not a producer decides to switch to CA or not.

With the struggle to adapt comes the struggle to make CA grow across the globe. CA has not spread as quickly as most conservationists would like. The reason for this is because there is not enough pressure for producers in places such as North America to change their way of living to a more conservationist outlook. But in the tropics there is more pressure to change to conservation areas because of the limited resources that are available. Places like Europe have also started to catch onto the ideas and principles of CA, but still nothing much is being done to change due to there being a minimal amount of pressure for people to change their ways of living (FAO 2006).

With CA comes the idea of producing enough food. With cutting back in fertilizer, not tilling the ground, and other processes comes the responsibility to feed the world. According to the Population Reference Bureau, there were around 6.08 billion people on Earth in the year 2000. By 2050 there will be an estimated 9.1 billion people. With this increase comes the responsibility for producers to increase food supply using the same or less land than we use today. Problems arise in the fact that if CA farms do not produce as much as conventional farms, this leaves the world with less food for more people.

'''Cultural backwardness''' ({{lang-ru|культурная отсталость}}) was a term used by Soviet politicians and ethnographers. There were at one point officially 97 "culturally backward" nationalities in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="m167"&gt;Martin, 167&lt;/ref&gt; Members of a "culturally backward" nationality were eligible for preferential treatment in university admissions.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, 56&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934 the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Central Executive Committee]] declared that the term should no longer be used, however preferential treatment for certain minorities and the promotion of local nationals in the party structure through ''[[korenizatsiya]]'' continued for several more years.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, 374&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
The [[People's Commissariat for Education]] listed five official characteristics of culturally backward nationalities:&lt;ref&gt;Martin, 166&lt;/ref&gt;
* An extremely low level of literacy
* An extremely low percentage of children in school
* Absence of a written script connected to a literary language
* Existence of "social vestiges" (oppression of women, racial hostility, nomadism, religious fanaticism)
* An extremely low level of national [[Professional revolutionaries|cadres]]

==List of "culturally backward" nationalities==
In 1932 the People's Commissariat for Education published an official list of "culturally backward" nationalities:&lt;ref name=m167/&gt;

'''''Eaarth: Making a Life on a Tough New Planet''''' is a book written by [[Bill McKibben]], published by [[Henry Holt and Company]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Lipinski, Jed|title="Eaarth": Earth is over|url=http://www.salon.com/books/feature/2010/04/16/bill_mckibben_eaarth_interview_ext2010|work=Salon|publisher=Salon Media|accessdate=May 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the opening chapter, McKibben presents an array of facts and statistics about climate change that are already visible, supported by extensive footnotes. In the second and third chapters, McKibben lays out his analysis of how we have arrived at the current situation, and conveys genuine sorrow as he explains how the drive for economic growth based on hydrocarbons since the 1970s has led the planet to the point of breakdown.&lt;ref&gt;Meatto Keith. [http://frontpsych.com/2011/06/02/tough-new-world-a-review-of-eaarth/ Tough New World – A Review of Eaarth] ''Frontier Psychiatrist'', June 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stern2010&gt;Nicholas Stern.

In a review of the book, British economist [[Nicholas Stern]] suggests that there is no doubting McKibben’s sincerity and his ability to communicate the significant risks which humanity faces. According to Stern, his "overall thesis that we are already seeing widespread effects of climate change is sound and supported by much robust scientific evidence".&lt;ref name=stern2010/&gt; But Stern says McKibben is too pessimistic when it comes to the recent advances in avoiding even bigger changes to the climate by reducing emissions of greenhouse gases.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11358">{{Taxation}}
'''Eight per thousand''' ({{lang-it|otto per mille}}) is an [[Italy|Italian]] law under which Italian taxpayers devolve a compulsory 8&amp;nbsp;‰ = 0.8% ('eight per thousand') from their annual income [[tax]] return to an organised [[religion]] recognised by Italy or, alternatively, to a [[Welfare (financial aid)|social assistance]] scheme run by the Italian State.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.governo.it/Presidenza/DICA/2_CONCERTAZIONE_AMMINISTRATIVA_MONITORAGGIO/Servizio_2/ottoxmille/ottopermille.html Italian prime minister's office' explanation of the "otto per mille"]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On the [[IRPEF|IRE]] form, people optionally declare a recipient. If they don't, the law stipulates that this undeclared amount be distributed among the normal recipients of such taxes in proportion to what they have already received from explicit declarations. In the period from 1990 to 2007, 42.73% expressed a choice, on average.

A similar scheme has been introduced in 2006 to fund with five per thousand entities that carry out socially relevant activities (for example, non-profit, scientific research).

== History ==

The relations between the Italian State and the religious [[Creed|confessions]] in its territory can be traced back to the [[Statuto Albertino]] of 1848, which applied first to the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] and then to the [[Kingdom of Italy]]. Its first article declared the "Roman Catholic Apostolic religion" the only [[state religion]] and granted legal toleration to all other religious confessions then present.&lt;ref&gt;[http://documenti.camera.it/bpr/20819_testo_completo_vol1.pdf#nav F. Racippi and I Brunelli, ''Commento allo Statuto del Regno'' (Torino 1909), p. 21]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Lateran treaties]] of 1929, which were incorporated in the 1948 Constitution of the Italian Republic, the State paid a small monthly [[salary]], called the ''congrua'', to [[Catholic]] clergymen as compensation for the [[nationalization]] of Church properties at the time of the [[unification of Italy]]. This ended on 31 December 1986, with the entry into force, as a result of a 1984 agreement between the government and the [[Holy See]] of the "eight per thousand" system.

== Current situation ==

As of 2015 there are 12 possible beneficiaries of the tax:

== Utilisation ==

Although the 1985 law on the matter declared that the State's portion of the proceeds was to be devoted to extraordinary expenses, such as world hunger, natural disasters and refugees, since 2004 a large proportion is employed for general purposes. In 2004, 80 million euros out of a total of about 100 million were thus employed, leading to criticism of the fact that part of it was used to finance the Italian military mission in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corriere.it/Primo_Piano/Cronache/2006/11_Novembre/10/crespi.shtml "In Iraq l'8 per mille destinato all'arte"] - ''Corriere della Sera'' 10 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://documenti.camera.it/leg16/dossier/Testi/BI0026.htm Camera dei deputati Dossier BI0026]&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its financial situation in 2011, the government decided to utilize the entire sum of about 145 million euros for purposes other than those indicated in the 1985 law: for instance, €57,277,063 were spent on improving the prison infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2011/12/29/beni-artistici-restano-secco-57-milioni.html Carlo Alberto Bucci, "I beni artistici restano a secco i 57 milioni dell'8 per mille vanno all'emergenza carceri" in ''La Repubblica'', 29 December 2011. Retrieved 3 May 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

The purposes for which the religious groups may use their portions are laid down in the agreements entered into with the government. In the case of the Catholic Church, the purposes are specified in article 48 of the 1985 law: "worship needs of the people, support of the clergy, charitable activities in favour of Italian society and the Third World". Each year the [[Italian Episcopal Conference]] publishes the proportions it assigns under various headings. Thus at its meeting in May 2012 it approved the following distribution (in thousands of euros):&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.8xmille.it/rendiconti/ripartizione2012.pdf La ripartizione e assegnazione delle somme derivanti dall’otto per mille dell’IRE (ex Irpef) per l’anno 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

*1,148,076 Total amount received (100.0%)
*479,226 Worship and pastoral work (41.7%)
**156,000 To the dioceses (for worship and pastoral work) (13.6%)
**190,000 Buildings for worship (16.5%)
***125,000 New buildings for worship (10.9%)
***65,000 Safeguarding cultural property of the Church (5.7%)

*255,000 Charitable activities (22.2%)
**125,000 To the dioceses (for charity) (10.9%)
**85,000 Third World (7.4%)
**45,000 Needs of national importance (3.9%)
*363,850 Financial support of the clergy (31.7%)
*50,000 Reserve for future use for worship, pastoral work and charity (4.4%)

The financial support for the clergy brings their salary up to a certain level, such as €852.93 a month for a priest at the beginning of his service, and €1308.57 a month for a bishop at the maximum of his biennial increments (2007 figures).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toscanaoggi.it/notizia_3.php?

== Choices expressed by taxpayers ==
{{Confusing|section|date=August 2016}}
For the first fifteen years of the system there was a gradual increase of the percentage of those who chose their contributions to go to the Catholic Church and a corresponding diminution of those who chose the State as beneficiary. Of those who exercised a choice, 76.17% opted for the Catholic Church in 1990, increasing to 89.81% in 2004 and falling to 86.05% in 2006 and 85.01% in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.altracitta.org/2010/06/28/cala-lotto-per-mille-alla-chiesa-cattolica-ma-la-cei-sa-come-monetizzare-e-risparmiare-sulle-tasse/ ''L'Altracittà'']&lt;/ref&gt; Since in 2007, for instance, only 43.50% of those who declared their incomes expressed a choice, those who did indicate the Catholic Church as beneficiary were less than 37% of the taxpayers, a figure much lower than the proportion of Italians who declare themselves Catholics, which corresponded rather to the proportion opting for the Church among those who did indicate a choice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://documenti.camera.it/Leg16/dossier/Testi/BI0350.htm#_Toc278992388 La ripartizione della quota dell'otto per mille IRPEF per il 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; Declarations in favour of the State, which were 22.31% in 1990, dropped to their lowest ever level of 7.60% in 2005, recovering later and reaching 11.95% in 2007.

The eight-per-thousand tax has significantly helped the Piedmontese [[Waldensians]]. A Protestant community whose origins predate the Reformation, the Waldensians have only about 25,000 enlisted members but about 412,000 Italians support them and their charitable works.&lt;ref&gt;[http://glauben-verbindet.blogspot.de/2013/01/gemeinsame-projektforderung-der.html 2013 Gemeinsame Projektförderung der Waldenser mit dem GAW] [[Gustavus Adolphus Union]] website 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6190">The '''English Literature Admissions Test''' ('''ELAT''') is a subject-specific admissions [[Test (assessment)|test]], used as part of the admissions process for undergraduate courses in English Language and Literature, combined English and Modern Languages, and Classics and English at the [[University of Oxford]]. As of 2016, ELAT has also been used by the [[University of Cambridge]] for admission to its undergraduate English course.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/courses/english] http://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/courses/english University of Cambridge. Retrieved  2018-05-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

ELAT is held pre-interview stage, in late October/early November. Results are available to candidates and test centres via the Cambridge Assessment Admissions Testing Results Online website.

==History==
ELAT was developed by [[Cambridge Assessment Admissions Testing]] in partnership with the [[University of Oxford]]. The test was developed to help admissions tutors differentiate within a large pool of extremely well-qualified applicants and provide information about applicants’ skills in close reading of literary texts. The test was trialled by Oxford in 2006 and became part of their admissions process in 2007. In 2016, the test was adopted by the [[University of Cambridge]] for admission to its undergraduate English course.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/courses/english] http://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/courses/english University of Cambridge. Retrieved 2018-05-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
ELAT is a 90-minute pen-and-paper test, which seeks to measure those skills needed to succeed on English or English-related degree courses. It assesses candidates’ close reading skills and their ability to shape and articulate an informed response to unfamiliar literary material. It consists of six literary extracts, from poetry, prose or drama. Candidates write one essay comparing two of the passages. Applicants are expected to comment on elements such as the language, imagery, allusion, syntax, form and structure. Marks are not awarded for references to other texts or authors, or for applying theoretical frameworks.

Candidates are asked to carry out the following task:

''Select two of the passages (a) to (f) and compare and contrast them in any ways that seem interesting to you, paying particular attention to distinctive features of structure, language and style. In your introduction, indicate briefly what you intend to explore or illustrate through close reading of your chosen passages.''

There will be some sort of link between the six passages, which will be explained in the introduction. Answer sheets will be provided to candidates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admissionstesting.org/for-test-takers/elat/about-elat/] http://www.admissionstesting.org/for-test-takers/elat/about-elat/ Cambridge Assessment Admissions Testing. Retrieved 2018-05-22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scoring==

Each script is marked by two examiners. Each examiner gives a mark out of 30 and these are combined to give an overall mark out of 60.

The [[University of Oxford]] uses candidates' marks by breaking them down into four bands:
* Band 1 (top): candidates most likely to be called for interview (unless other indicators suggest otherwise)
* Band 2: candidates who should probably be invited to interview
* Band 3: candidates who may not be called to interview (unless there is convincing evidence to suggest otherwise)
* Band 4: candidates who are less likely to be invited to interview (unless other factors outweigh the evidence of the test).

For the [[University of Cambridge]], a full breakdown of marks for each candidate is provided to admissions tutors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admissionstesting.org/for-test-takers/elat/scoring-and-results/] http://www.admissionstesting.org/for-test-takers/elat/scoring-and-results/ Cambridge Assessment Admissions Testing. Retrieved 2018-05-22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timing and results==
ELAT is normally sat at an applicant’s school or college. Alternatively, the test can be taken at [[Cambridge Assessment Admissions Testing|Cambridge Assessment Admissions Testing’s]] authorised ‘open centres’ worldwide.

The timing of the test is designed to fit in with the timescales for applications to the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge. Candidates can be entered for the test from September to mid-October. ELAT takes place in later October/early November.

Results are automatically sent to the college where the candidate has applied. Statements of Results are typically issued to candidates and test centres in mid-January when they can be accessed online by candidates and test centres.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admissionstesting.org/for-test-takers/elat/dates-and-costs/] http://www.admissionstesting.org/for-test-takers/elat/dates-and-costs/ Cambridge Assessment Admissions Testing. Retrieved 2018-05-22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
The Universities of Oxford and Cambridge use ELAT as part of their admissions processes, but it is only one of the elements used to decide whether to invite applicants for interview.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.english.ox.ac.uk/shortlisting-and-selection-criteria-undergraduate] http://www.english.ox.ac.uk/shortlisting-and-selection-criteria-undergraduate Faculty of English, University of Oxford. Retrieved 2018-05-22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparation==
ELAT is designed to not require a lot of extra study. It is not a test of wide reading and there are no assumptions about the texts that candidates should have read. Candidates can practise for the test using specimen questions and past papers, which can be downloaded for free from the Cambridge Assessment Admissions Testing [http://www.admissionstesting.org/for-test-takers/elat/preparing-for-elat/ website].

The '''European Small Claims Procedure''' (ESCP) is a [[small claims court|small claims]] procedure which took effect on 1 January 2009 across the [[European Union]] (except [[Denmark]]) for dealing with cross-border claims under the [[Brussels Regime]] up to a value of €5,000.&lt;ref&gt;Regulation (EU) 2015/2421 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2015 amending Regulation (EC) No 861/2007 establishing a European Small Claims Procedure and Regulation (EC) No 1896/2006 creating a European order for payment procedure ([http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32015R2421 OJ L 341, 24 December 2015, p. 1–13])&lt;/ref&gt;

Small claims procedures provide a middle ground between formal litigation and ADR, where disputes involving small value claims can be resolved in courts faster, cheaply, and less formally. The main limitation of small claims procedures is that they are restricted to particular jurisdictions. To overcome this limitation the European Commission produced a regulation for a European Small Claims Procedure (ESCP).&lt;ref&gt;Regulation (EC) No 861/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2007 establishing a European Small Claims Procedure ([http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32007R0861 OJ L 199, 31 July 2007, p. 1–22])&lt;/ref&gt;

The ESCP is predominantly a written procedure that deals with claims under €5,000 arising in cross-border disputes. Its main advantage is that it provides for the enforcement of decisions in any of the member states without the present need to go through the formal mutual recognition of judgements ([[exequatur]]).&lt;ref&gt;P. Cortés "Does the Proposed European Procedure Enhance the Resolution of Small Claims?" (2008)27(1) ''Civil Justice Quarterly'' 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

Euroscepticism should not be confused with [[anti-Europeanism]], which is a dislike of [[culture of Europe|European culture]] and [[European ethnic groups]] by non-Europeans.

==Global outlook==
While having some overlaps, Euroscepticism and [[anti-Europeanism]] are different. Anti-Europeanism has always had a strong influence in American culture and [[American exceptionalism]], which sometimes sees Europe on the decline or as a rising rival power, or both.&lt;ref name=ae&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chamorel|first1=Patrick|title=Anti-Europeanism and Euroscepticism in the United States, No. 2004/25|publisher=European University Institute|url=http://cadmus.eui.eu/bitstream/handle/1814/2767/04_25.pdf|agency=Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies (RSCAS)|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some aspects of [[Euroscepticism in the United Kingdom]] have been mirrored by U.S. authors.&lt;ref name=ae/&gt;

There can be considered to be several different types of Eurosceptic thought, which differ in the extent to which adherents reject integration between member states of the [[European Union]] (EU) and in their reasons for doing so. Aleks Szczerbiak and Paul Taggart described two of these as hard and soft Euroscepticism.&lt;ref name="Arato 162"&gt;{{cite book |title=Euroscepticism and European Integration |last=Arato |first = Krisztina |author2=Kaniok, Petr |publisher=CPI/PSRC |location= |isbn=978-953-7022-20-4 |page = 162}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harmsen et al 2005, p. 18"&gt;Harmsen et al (2005), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gifford 2008 5"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Making of Eurosceptic Britain |last=Gifford |first=Chris |year=2008 |publisher=Ashgate Publishing |location= |isbn=978-0-7546-7074-2 |page=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Szczerbiak 7"&gt;Szczerbiak et al (2008), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewis 2003 211"&gt;{{cite book |title=Pan-European Perspectives on Party Politics |last=Lewis |first=Paul G |author2=Webb, Paul D |year=2003 |publisher=Brill |location= |isbn= 978-90-04-13014-2 |page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hard Euroscepticism===
According to Taggart and Szczerbiak, hard Euroscepticism (also called anti-EU-ism)&lt;ref name="Arato 162"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harmsen et al 2005, p. 18"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gifford 2008 5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Szczerbiak 7"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewis 2003 211"/&gt; is "a principled opposition to the EU and European integration and therefore can be seen in parties who think that their countries should withdraw from membership, or whose policies towards the EU are tantamount to being opposed to the whole project of European integration as it is currently conceived."&lt;ref name="Szczerbiak 7"/&gt;

The [[Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy]] group in the [[European Parliament]], typified by such parties as the [[United Kingdom Independence Party]] (UKIP), displays hard Euroscepticism. In western European EU member countries, hard Euroscepticism is currently a characteristic of many [[anti-establishment]] parties.&lt;ref&gt;Harmsen et al. (2005), pp. 31–32&lt;/ref&gt;

Some hard Eurosceptics prefer to call themselves 'Eurorealists' rather than 'sceptics', and regard their position as pragmatic rather than "in principle". Additionally, [[Tony Benn]], a left-wing [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] MP who fought against [[European integration]] in 1975 by opposing membership of the [[European Communities]] in [[United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum, 1975|that year's referendum on the issue]], emphasised his opposition to [[xenophobia]] and his support of democracy, saying: "My view about the European Union has always been not that I am hostile to foreigners, but that I am in favour of democracy [...] I think they're building an empire there, they want us to be a part of their empire and I don't want that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0wFii8klNg|author=Tony Benn|work=[[Oxford Union]]|title=European Union|date=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Czech president [[Václav Klaus]] rejected the term "Euroscepticism" for its purported negative undertones, saying (at a meeting in April 2012) that the expressions for a Eurosceptic and their opponent should be "a Euro-realist" and someone who is "Euro-naïve", respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Radio Prague: Current Affairs|url=http://archiv.radio.cz/english/cur-affrs/31-5-99.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303230601/http://archiv.radio.cz/english/cur-affrs/31-5-99.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=3 March 2016|accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[François Asselineau]] of the French [[Popular Republican Union (2007)|Popular Republican Union]] has criticised the use of the term 'sceptic' to describe hard Eurosceptics, and would rather advocate the use of the term "Euro opponent".&lt;ref name=UPR1&gt;[[François Asselineau|Asselineau, François]]. [http://www.upr.fr/actualite/france-europe/europeens-convaincus-contre-eurosceptiques "« Européens convaincus » contre « Eurosceptiques » : Le retour de la Sainte Inquisition"], ''[[Popular Republican Union (2007)|Popular Republican Union]]'', 16 December 2010. Retrieved 29 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he believes the use of the term 'sceptic' for soft Eurosceptics to be correct, since other Eurosceptic parties in France are "merely criticising" the EU without taking into account the fact that the [[Treaty of Rome]] can only be modified with a unanimous agreement of all the EU member states, something he considers impossible to achieve.&lt;ref name=UPR2&gt;{{cite web|author=Laurent De Boissieu|url=http://www.la-croix.com/Actualite/France/Presidentielle-Ces-petits-candidats-qui-veulent-se-faire-entendre-_EP_-2012-03-15-778791|title=Présidentielle: Ces "petits" candidats qui veulent se faire entendre|trans-title=Presidential election: These "small" candidates who want to be heard|language=fr|work=La Croix|date=15 March 2012|accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soft Euroscepticism===
Soft Euroscepticism is support for the existence of, and membership of, a form of European Union, but with opposition to specific EU policies; or, in Taggart's and Szczerbiak's words, "where there is NOT a principled objection to European integration or EU membership but where concerns on one (or a number) of policy areas lead to the expression of qualified opposition to the EU, or where there is a sense that 'national interest' is currently at odds with the EU's trajectory."&lt;ref&gt;Szczerbiak et al (2008), p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tagart Szcserbiak"&gt;{{cite book|first=Paul|last=Taggart|first2=Aleks|last2=Szczerbiak|url=https://www.sussex.ac.uk/webteam/gateway/file.php?name=sei-working-paper-no-51.pdf&amp;site=266|title=The Party Politics of Euroscepticism in EU Member and Candidate States|publisher=Sussex European Institute|page=7|year=2001|language= English|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Conservatives and Reformists]] group, typified by centre-right parties such as Czech [[Civic Democratic Party (Czech Republic)|Civic Democratic Party]], along with the [[European United Left–Nordic Green Left]] which is an alliance of the left-wing parties in the European Parliament, display soft Euroscepticism.

===Criticism of terms 'soft' and 'hard' Euroscepticism===
Some have claimed that there is no clear line between the presumed 'hard' and 'soft' Euroscepticism. Kopecky and [[Cas Mudde|Mudde]] have said that if the demarcation line is the number of and which policies a party opposes, then the question arises of how many must a party oppose and which ones should a party oppose that makes them 'hard' Eurosceptic instead of 'soft'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Varieties of Euroscepticism:The Case of the European Extreme Right |author=Sofia Vasilopoulou}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other terms===
{{anchor|Europhobia}}
Some scholars consider the gradual difference in terminology between 'hard' and 'soft' Euroscepticism inadequate to accommodate the large differences in terms of political agenda. Therefore, "hard Euroscepticism" has also been referred to as "Europhobia" as opposed to mere "Euroscepticism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Yves Bertoncini |author2=Nicole König |title=Euroscepticism or Europhobia: Voice vs. Exit? |publisher=[[Jacques Delors Institute]] |series=Policy paper |issue=121 |url=http://www.institutdelors.eu/media/euroscepticismoreurophobia-bertoncini-koenig-ne-jdi-nov14.pdf |pages=6 ff. |date=27 November 2014 |accessdate=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other alternative names for 'hard' and 'soft' Euroscepticism include, respectively, "withdrawalist" and "reformist" Euroscepticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=European Sources Online Information Guide: Euroscepticism |work=Cardiff University Press |page=3 |url=http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/insrv/resources/edc/Euroscepticism.pdf |date=April 2015 |accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey in {{As of|2015|11|alt=November 2015}}, conducted by [[Taylor Nelson Sofres|TNS]] Opinion and Social on behalf of the [[European Commission]], showed that, across the EU as a whole, those with a positive image of the EU are down from a high of 52% in 2007 to 37% in autumn 2015; this compares with 23% with a negative image of the EU, and 38% with a neutral image.&lt;ref name = "Eurobarometer Autumn 2015, EU image"/&gt;

A Eurobarometer survey carried out four days prior to and six days after the [[United States presidential election, 2016|U.S. presidential election in November 2016]] revealed that the surprise victory of [[Donald Trump]] caused an increase in the popularity of the European Union in Europe. The increase was strongest among the political right and among respondents who perceived their country as economically struggling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Minkus|first=Lara|last2=Deutschmann|first2=Emanuel|last3=Delhey|first3=Jan|date=undefined/ed|title=A Trump Effect on the EU’s Popularity?

A survey  carried out in April 2018 for the European Parliament  by Kantar Public consulting found that support for the EU was “the highest score ever measured since 1983”.  Support for the EU was up in 26 out of 28 EU countries, the exceptions being Germany and the UK, where support had dropped by about 2% since the previous survey. Almost half (48%) of the 27,601 EU citizens surveyed agreed that their voice counted in the EU, up from 37% in 2016, whereas 46% disagreed with this statement. Two-thirds (67%) of respondents felt that their country had benefited from EU membership and 60% said that being part of the bloc was a good thing, as opposed to 12% who felt the opposite. At the height of the EU's financial and economic crises in 2011, just 47% had been of the view that EU membership was a good thing. Support for EU membership was greatest in [[Malta]] (93%), [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] (91%), [[Lithuania]] (90%), [[Poland]] (88%), [[Luxembourg]] (88%), [[Estonia]] (86%) and [[Denmark]] (84%) and lowest in [[Greece]] (57%), [[Bulgaria]] (57%), [[Republic of Cyprus|Cyprus]] (56%), [[Austria]] (54%), the [[United Kingdom|UK]] (53%) and [[Italy]] (44%). When asked which issues should be a priority for the European Parliament, survey respondents picked terrorism as the most pressing topic of discussion, ahead of youth unemployment and immigration. Not all countries shared the same priorities, however. Immigration topped the list in Italy (66% of citizens surveyed considered it a priority issue), Malta (65%) and [[Hungary]] (62%) but fighting youth unemployment and support for economic growth were top concerns in [[Spain]], Greece, Portugal, Cyprus and [[Croatia]].  Social protection of citizens was the top concern for Dutch, Swedish and Danish respondents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.eu/article/europeans-love-the-eu-and-populists-too/|title=Europeans love the EU (and populists too)|last=Heath|first=Ryan|date=23 May 2018|work=Politico.eu|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History in the European Parliament==

===1999–2004===
A study analysed voting records of the Fifth European Parliament and ranked groups, concluding:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fedtrust.co.uk/admin/uploads/FedT_workshop_HixNoury.pdf|title=After Enlargement: Voting Behaviour in the Sixth European Parliament|author1=Simon Hix|author2=Abdul Noury|format=PDF|website=The UK Federal Trust for Education and Research|date=17 March 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925211417/http://www.fedtrust.co.uk/admin/uploads/FedT_workshop_HixNoury.pdf|archivedate=25 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Towards the top of the figure are the more pro-European parties (PES, EPP-ED, and ALDE), whereas towards the bottom of the figure are the more anti-European parties (EUL/NGL, G/EFA, UEN and EDD)."

===2004–09===
In 2004, 37 [[Member of the European Parliament|Members of the European Parliament]] (MEPs) from the UK, [[Poland]], [[Denmark]] and [[Sweden]] founded a new European Parliament group called "[[Independence and Democracy]]" from the old [[Europe of Democracies and Diversities]] (EDD) group.

The main goal of the ID group was to reject the proposed [[Treaty establishing a constitution for Europe]]. Some delegations within the group, notably that from UKIP, also advocated the complete withdrawal of their country from the EU, while others only wished to limit further European integration.

===2009 elections===
The [[European Parliament election, 2009|elections of 2009]] saw a significant fall in support in some areas for Eurosceptic parties, with all such MEPs from Poland, Denmark and Sweden losing their seats. However, in the UK, the Eurosceptic UKIP achieved second place in the election, finishing ahead of the governing Labour Party, and the [[British National Party]] (BNP) won its first ever two MEPs. Although new members joined the ID group from Greece and the [[Netherlands]], it was unclear whether the group would reform in the new parliament.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The ID group did reform, as the [[Europe of Freedom and Democracy]] (EFD) and is represented by 32 MEPs from nine countries.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

===2014 elections===
The [[European Parliament election, 2014|elections of 2014]] saw a big anti-establishment vote in favour of eurosceptic parties, which took around a quarter of the seats available. Those that won their national elections included: UKIP in the UK (the first time since 1906 that a party other than Labour or the Conservatives had won a national vote), the [[National Front (France)|National Front]] in France, the [[Danish People's Party|People's Party]] in Denmark and [[Coalition of the Radical Left|Syriza]] in Greece. Second places were taken by [[Sinn Féin]] in Ireland and the [[Five Star Movement]] in Italy. [[Herman Van Rompuy]], the [[President of the European Council]], agreed following the election to re-evaluate the economic area's agenda and to launch consultations on future policy areas with the 28 member states.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

As of 2013, six parties together held all 183 [[National Council of Austria|National Council]] seats, and all bar one of the 62 [[Federal Council of Austria|Federal Council]] seats and 19 European Parliament seats. The [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreichs]] (SPÖ - social democrats), which holds 56/183 NC, 24/62 FC, and 5/19 EP seats, is pro-European integration, as is the [[Austrian People's Party|Österreichische Volkspartei]] (ÖVP - conservative/Christian), which holds 51/183 NC, 28/62 FC, and 6/19 EP seats, and [[The Greens – The Green Alternative|Die Grünen – Die Grüne Alternative]] (green), which holds 20/183 NC, 3/62 FC, and 2/19 EP seats.

The [[Freedom Party of Austria|Freiheitliche Partei Österreichs (FPÖ)]], established in 1956, is a right-wing populist party that mainly attracts support from young people and workers.&lt;ref&gt;Nordland, Rod (4 October 2008).

Retrieved 13 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, it changed its stance over the EU to Euroscepticism. It opposed Austria joining the EU in 1994, and opposed the introduction of the [[euro]] in 1998. The party would like to leave the EU if it threatens to develop into [[United States of Europe|a country]], or if [[Turkey]] joins. The FPÖ received 20–27% of the national vote in the 1990s, and more recently received 17.5% in 2008. It currently has 34/183 National Council seats, 4/62 Federal Council seats, and 2/19 European Parliament seats.

The [[Alliance for the Future of Austria|Bündnis Zukunft Österreich]] (BZÖ), established in 2005, is a socially conservative party that has always held Eurosceptic elements. In 2011 the party openly supported leaving the [[eurozone]], and in 2012 it announced that it supported a full withdrawal from the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=BZÖ will raus aus der Euro-Zone|url=http://www.oe24.at/oesterreich/politik/BZOe-will-raus-aus-der-Euro-Zone/69868870|newspaper=[[Österreich (newspaper)|Österreich]] |date=21 June 2012 |accessdate=9 November 2012|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party has also called upon a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty.&lt;ref name="BZÖ wird rechtsliberal"&gt;{{cite news |title=BZÖ wird "rechtsliberal"|url=http://diepresse.com/home/politik/innenpolitik/515151/BZO-wird-rechtsliberal |newspaper=[[Die Presse]]|date=15 October 2009|accessdate=9 July 2011|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; In polls it currently receives around 10%–15%, although in one state it did receive 45% of the vote in 2009.

[[Ewald Stadler]], a former member of FPÖ (and later of BZÖ) was very Eurosceptic, but in 2011 became member of the European Parliament due to the Lisbon Treaty. Before Stadler accepted the seat, this led to heavy critics by Jörg Leichtfried (SPÖ) "Stadler wants to just rescue his political career" because Stadler before mentioned he would never accept a seat as MEP if this was only due to the Lisbon Treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Leichtfried zu Stadler: Chaos bei BZÖ – EU-Mandat durch Lissabon plötzlich akzeptabel|url=http://www.ots.at/presseaussendung/OTS_20091217_OTS0158/leichtfried-zu-stadler-chaos-bei-bzoe-eu-mandat-durch-lissabon-ploetzlich-akzeptabel|date=17 December 2009 |accessdate=21 February 2014|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 December 2013 he founded a conservative and Eurosceptic party called [[The Reform Conservatives]].

===Belgium===
The main Eurosceptic party in Belgium is [[Vlaams Belang]].

In the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (Belgium)|2014 European Parliament election]], Belgium's Vlaams Belang lost over half of its previous vote share, polling 4.26% (down 5.59%) and losing 1 of its 2 MEPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Results of the 2009 European Elections|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/elections2014-results/en/country-results-be-2009.html|publisher=European Parliament|accessdate=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Results of the 2014 European Elections|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/elections2014-results/en/country-results-be-2014.html|publisher=European Parliament|accessdate=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EU flag down.jpg|130px|left|thumb|European flag in Bulgaria torn down by supporters of the Eurosceptic party Attack]]

Parties with mainly Eurosceptic views are [[Union of Communists in Bulgaria]], [[National Front for the Salvation of Bulgaria|NFSB]], [[Attack (political party)|Attack]], and [[IMRO – Bulgarian National Movement|VMRO – BND]], which is a member of the Eurosceptic [[European Conservatives and Reformists]]).
Bulgaria's Minister of Finance, [[Simeon Djankov]], stated in 2011 that ERM II membership to enter the Euro zone would be postponed until after the [[Eurozone crisis]] had stabilised.&lt;ref name="Radio Bulgaria"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bnr.bg/sites/en/Lifestyle/BGEU/Pages/2607BulgariaputsoffEurozonemembershipfor2015.aspx|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329104921/http://bnr.bg/sites/en/Lifestyle/BGEU/Pages/2607BulgariaputsoffEurozonemembershipfor2015.aspx |archivedate=29 March 2012|title=Bulgaria puts off Eurozone membership for 2015|publisher=Radio Bulgaria|date=26 July 2011|accessdate=2 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (Bulgaria)|2014 European Parliament election]] Bulgaria remained overwhelmingly pro-EU, with the Eurosceptic Attack party receiving 2.96% of the vote, down 9%, with the splinter group [[National Front for the Salvation of Bulgaria]] taking 3.05%; neither party secured any MEPs. A coalition between [[IMRO – Bulgarian National Movement|VMRO – BND]] and [[Reload Bulgaria|Bulgaria Without Cencorship]] secured an MEP position for [[Angel Dzhambazki]] from IMRO, who is a soft eurosceptic.

Followers of Eurosceptic Attack tore down and trampled the [[European flag]] on 3 March 2016 at a meeting of the party in the Bulgarian capital [[Sofia]], dedicated to the commemoration of the 138th anniversary of the [[liberation of Bulgaria]] from the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dnevnik.bg/bulgaria/2016/03/03/2716796_privurjenici_na_ataka_svaliha_znameto_na_es_ot/ |title=Привърженици на "Атака" свалиха знамето на ЕС от пилоните пред НДК |date=3 March 2016 |publisher=Дневник |accessdate=3 March 2016 |language=bg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Croatia===
Parties with Eurosceptic views are mainly small right-wing parties like [[Croatian Party of Rights]], [[Croatian Party of Rights dr. Ante Starčević]], [[Croatian Pure Party of Rights]], [[Autochthonous Croatian Party of Rights]], [[Croatian Christian Democratic Party]] and [[Only Croatia – Movement for Croatia]].

The only [[parliamentary party]] that is vocally eurosceptic is the [[Human Shield (political party)|Human Shield]] that won 5 out of 151 seats at the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2016|2016 parliamentary election]],. Their position is generally considered to waver between hard and soft Euroscepticism; it requests thorough reform of the EU so that all member states would be perfectly equal.

===Czech Republic===

[[File:Vaclav Klaus headshot.jpg|thumb|right|130px|[[Vaclav Klaus]], former Eurosceptic [[List of Presidents of the Czech Republic|President of the Czech Republic]].]]

The [[Czech legislative election, 2017|2017 Czech legislative election]] brought into Parliament three Eurosceptic parties. The soft Eurosceptic Civic Democratic Party (ODS) is the second largest, the new hard Eurosceptic [[Freedom and Direct Democracy]] (SPD) is the fourth largest and the [[Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia]] (KSČM) that is largely regarded as a Eurosceptic party is the fifth largest party in the Czech parliament.

===Cyprus===
Parties with mainly Eurosceptic views in Cyprus are [[New Internationalist Left (Cyprus)|New Internationalist Left]], the [[Progressive Party of Working People]], [[Committee for a Radical Left Rally]] and [[ELAM (Cyprus)|ELAM]].

===Denmark===

[[File:Pia Kjærsgaard (2014).JPG|[[Pia Kjærsgaard]]|thumb|150px|[[Pia Kjærsgaard]], [[List of Speakers of the Parliament of Denmark|Speaker of the Parliament of Denmark]]; member (and former leader) of the hard Eurosceptic party [[Danish People's Party]] (Dansk Folkeparti), the second-largest represented in the [[Folketing|Danish parliament]] and the most represented in the European Parliament.]]
The [[People's Movement against the EU]] only takes part in European Parliament elections and has one member in the European Parliament. The soft Eurosceptic [[June Movement]], originally a split-off from the People's Movement against the EU, existed from 1992 to 2009.

In the Danish [[Folketinget|Parliament]], the [[Enhedslisten|Unity List]] has withdrawal from the EU as a policy. The [[Danish People's Party]] also advocates withdrawal, but has claimed to support some EU structures such as the [[internal market]], and supported the EU-positive [[Cabinet of Anders Fogh Rasmussen I|Liberal-Conservative coalition]] between 2001 and 2011.

The [[Socialist People's Party (Denmark)|Socialist People's Party]], minorities within the [[Radikale Venstre|Social Liberal Party]] and [[Socialdemokratiet|Social Democratic Party]], and some smaller parties were against accession to the European Union in 1972. Still in 1986, these parties advocated a no vote in the [[Danish Single European Act referendum, 1986|Single European Act referendum]]. Later, the Social Liberal Party changed to a strongly EU-positive party, and EU opposition within the Social Democratic Party faded. The Socialist People's Party were against the [[Danish Amsterdam Treaty referendum, 1998|Amsterdam Treaty]] in 1998 and [[Danish euro referendum, 2000|Denmark's joining the euro]] in 2000, but has become increasingly EU-positive, for example when MEP [[Margrete Auken]] left the [[European United Left–Nordic Green Left]] and joined [[The Greens–European Free Alliance]] in 2004.

In the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (Denmark)|2014 European Parliament election]], the [[Danish People's Party]] came first by a large margin with 26.6% of the vote, gaining 2 extra seats for a total of 4 MEPs. The [[People's Movement against the EU]] polled 8.1%, retaining its single MEP.

===Estonia===
The [[Estonian Independence Party|Independence Party]] and [[Estonian Centre Party|Centre Party]] were against accession to the EU, but only the Independence Party still wants Estonia to withdraw from the EU. The [[Conservative People's Party of Estonia|Conservative People's Party]] (EKRE) also has some Eurosceptic policies.

===Finland===
The largest Eurosceptic party in Finland is the [[Finns Party]]. In the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (Finland)|European Parliament election, 2014]], the Finns Party increased their vote share by 3.1% to 12.9%, adding a second MEP.

In Eurobarometer 77 (fieldwork in Spring 2012), 41% of Finns trusted the European Union (EU-27 average: 31%), 51% trusted The European Parliament (EU-27average: 40%), and 74% were in favour of the euro currency (EU-27 average: 52%).{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

In France there are multiple parties that are Eurosceptic to different degrees, varying from advocating less EU intervention in national affairs, to advocating outright withdrawal from the EU and the Eurozone. These parties belong to all sides of the political spectrum, so the reasons for their Euroscepticism may differ. In the past many French people appeared to be uninterested in such matters, with only 40% of the French electorate voting in the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (France)|2009 European Parliament elections]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| language = French | url= http://www.lemonde.fr/elections-europeennes/article/2009/06/07/europeennes-l-ump-en-tete-le-ps-en-fort-recul_1203615_1168667.html| title = Européenes : l'UMP en tête, le PS en fort recul |work=Le Monde|date=7 June 2010|accessdate=12 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Right-wing Eurosceptic parties include the [[Gaullism|Gaullist]] [[Arise the Republic|''Debout la République'']], and ''[[Mouvement pour la France]]'', which was part of [[Libertas.eu|Libertas]], a pan-European Eurosceptic party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| language = French | url = http://www.eurosduvillage.eu/Europeennes-la-dynamique-inedite,2709.html|title= Européenes : la dynamique inédite du eurosceptcism |publisher= Euros du village |date= 29 April 2010|accessdate = 12 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (France)|2009 European Parliament elections]], Debout la République received 1.77% of the national vote, and Libertas 4.8%. In a similar way to some moderate parties, the French right and far-right in general are naturally opposed to the EU, as they criticise France's loss of political and economic sovereignty to a [[supranational]] entity. Some of these hard Eurosceptic parties include the [[Popular Republican Union (2007)|Popular Republican Union]] and the [[National Front (France)|Front National]] (FN).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontnational.com/?page_id=1185|title=Europe|language=fr|publisher=Front National|accessdate=12 February 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091013135820/http://www.frontnational.com/?page_id=1185 |archivedate=13 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Front National and Popular Republican Union both seek France's withdrawal from the EU and the euro, although Popular Republican Union also seeks France's withdrawal from NATO. The FN received 33.9% of the votes in the [[French presidential election, 2017]], making it the largest Eurosceptic party in France.

Eurosceptic parties on the left in France tend to criticise what they see as the [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] agenda of the EU, as well as the elements of its structure which are undemocatic and seen as top-down. These parties include the [[Left Party (France)|''Parti de Gauche'']] and the [[French Communist Party]], which formed the [[Left Front (France)|''Front de Gauche'']] for the 2009 European Parliament elections and received 6.3% of the votes. The leader of the [[Left Front (France)|Left Front]] defends a complete reform of the Monetary Union, rather than the withdrawal of France from the [[Eurozone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jean-luc-melenchon.fr/arguments/resolution-du-parti-de-gauche-sur-l%E2%80%99euro/|title=Résolution du Parti de Gauche sur l'euro|publisher=Worldpress – Politique à Gauche|date=10 April 2011|accessdate=29 July 2015|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the major far-left Eurosceptic parties in France include the [[New Anticapitalist Party]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| language = French | url= http://www.npa2009.org/content/leur-europe-nest-pas-la-n%C3%B4tre|title= Leur Europe n'est pas la nôtre ! | publisher =NPA |date=19 May 2010|accessdate=12 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which received 4.8% and [[Workers' Struggle|Lutte Ouvrière]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | language = French | url = http://www.lutte-ouvriere.org/qui-sommes-nous/nos-idees/article/l-europe |title= L'Europe|publisher=Lutte Ouvrière |accessdate=12 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which received 1.2%. The [[Citizen and Republican Movement]], a left-wing Eurosceptic and [[Souverainism|souverainist]] party, have not participated in any elections for the European Parliament.

The party [[Hunting, Fishing, Nature, Tradition|''Chasse, Pêche, Nature &amp; Traditions'']], is an [[Agrarianism|agrarianist]] Eurosceptic party that claims to be neither left nor right.

In the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (France)|European Parliament election, 2014]], the [[National Front (France)|National Front]] won the elections with 24.85% of the vote, a swing of 18.55%, winning 24 seats, up from 3 previously. The former French President [[François Hollande]] had called for the EU to be reformed and for a scaling back of its power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-27579235 |title=EU election: France's Hollande calls for reform of 'remote' EU |publisher=BBC |date=27 May 2014 |accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (Germany)|European Parliament election, 2014]], the Alternative for Germany came 5th with 7% of the vote, winning 7 seats and is a member of the Eurosceptic European Conservatives and Reformists. The Alternative for Germany went on to take seats in three state legislatures in the Autumn of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-29203423 |title=German anti-euro AfD party wins seats in east |publisher=BBC News |date=15 September 2014 |accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party became purely Eurosceptic in 2015, when a split occurred in the party, leading to [[Frauke Petry]]'s leadership and a more hard line approach to the European Union.&lt;ref name=split&gt;{{cite news|title=AfD chief Lucke denies plans to split the party|url=http://www.dw.de/afd-chief-lucke-denies-plans-to-split-the-party/a-18460878|accessdate=27 May 2015|publisher=Deutsche Welle|date=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015 a split from AfD created a new soft Eurosceptic party called [[Alliance for Progress and Renewal]].

===Greece===
{{Main|Greek withdrawal from the Eurozone|Greek government-debt crisis}}

[[Golden Dawn (political party)|Golden Dawn]], [[Communist Party of Greece]] (KKE), [[Independent Greeks|ANEL]], [[Course of Freedom]], [[Popular Unity (Greece)|Popular Unity]], and [[Popular Orthodox Rally|LAOS]] are the main Eurosceptic parties in Greece. According to the [[London School of Economics]], Greece is the 2nd most Eurosceptic country in the European Union, with 50% (only behind UK) of the Greeks thinking that their country has not benefited at all from the EU. Meanwhile, 33% of the Greeks views Greek membership in EU as a good thing, marginally ahead of UK. 81% of the Greeks say that the EU is going in the wrong direction. These figures represent a major increase in Euroscepticism in Greece since 2009.

In June 2012, the Eurosceptic parties in Greece that were represented in the parliament before the Election in January 2015 (ANEL, Golden Dawn, KKE) got 45.8% of the votes and 40.3% of the seats in the parliament. In the [[Greek legislative election, January 2015|legislative election of January 2015]] the [[pro-European]] (left and right-wing) parties ([[New Democracy (Greece)|ND]], [[PASOK]], [[The River (Greece)|Potami]], [[Movement of Democratic Socialists|KIDISO]], [[Union of Centrists|EK]] and [[Greens (Greece)|Prasinoi]]-[[Democratic Left (Greece)|DIMAR]]) got 43.28% of the votes. The Eurosceptic parties got 54.64%. The Eurosceptic left ([[Communist Party of Greece|KKE]], [[Anticapitalist Left Cooperation for the Overthrow|ANTARSYA-MARS]] and [[Communist Party of Greece (Marxist–Leninist)|KKE (M–L)]]/[[Marxist–Leninist Communist Party of Greece|M–L KKE]]) got 42.58% of the votes and the Eurosceptic right ([[Golden Dawn (political party)|Golden Dawn]], [[Independent Greeks|ANEL]] and [[Popular Orthodox Rally|LAOS]]) got 12.06% of the votes, with Syriza ahead with 36.34%. The Eurosceptic parties got 194 seats in the new parliament and the pro-EU parties got 106 seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ekloges-prev.singularlogic.eu/v2015a/v/public/index.html?lang=en#|title=Parliamentary Elections January 2015|publisher=Ministry of Interior|accessdate=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Next Greek legislative election#Opinion polls|polls conducted in June and July 2015]] (12 polls), the Eurosceptic left would get on average 48.03% (excluding extraparliamentary parties as ANTARSYA-MARS and KKE (m–l)/ML-KKE), the parliamentary pro-EU parties (Potami, New Democracy and PASOK) would get 33.82%, the extra-parliamentary (not represented in the Hellenic Parliament) pro-EU parties (KIDISO and EK) would get 4.44% and the Eurosceptic right would get 10.2% (excluding extraparliamentary parties, such as [[Popular Orthodox Rally|LAOS]], not displayed on recent opinion polls). The soft Eurosceptic parties would get 42.31%, the hard Eurosceptic parties (including [[KKE]], [[ANEL]] and [[Golden Dawn (political party)|Golden Dawn]]) would get 15.85%, and the pro-EU parties (including extra-parliamentary parties displayed on opinion polls) would get 38.27% of the votes.

In the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (Greece)|European Parliament election, 2014]], [[Syriza]] won the election with 26.58% of the vote (a swing of 21.88%) taking 6 seats (up 5), with [[Golden Dawn (political party)|Golden Dawn]] coming 3rd taking 3 seats, the [[Communist Party of Greece|Communist Party]] taking 2 seats and the [[Independent Greeks]] gaining their first ever seat. Syriza's leader Tsipras said he's not anti-European and does not want to leave the euro. According to ''[[The Economist]]'', Tsipras is willing to negotiate with Greece's European partners, and it is believed a Syriza victory could encourage radical leftist parties across Europe. Alexis Tsipras vowed to reverse many of the austerity measures adopted by Greece since a series of bailouts began in 2010, at odds with the Eurogroup's positions.{{r|econ2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-30975437 |title=BBC News Greece election: Anti-austerity Syriza wins election |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The current government coalition in Greece is composed by Syriza and [[Independent Greeks|ANEL]] (right-wing hard Eurosceptic party, led by [[Panos Kammenos]], who is the current Minister of Defence).

(eds).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prime Minister of Hungary]] for the national-conservative [[Fidesz]] Party. Another Eurosceptic party in Hungary is [[Jobbik]], a [[Political radicalism|radical]], [[Xenophobia|xenophobic]] and [[Far-right politics|far-right]] party.

In Hungary 39% of the population have a positive image of the EU, 20% have a negative image, and 40% neutral (1% "Don't know").&lt;ref name = "Eurobarometer Autumn 2015, EU image"/&gt;

In the [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 2014|2014 Hungarian parliamentary election]], Fidesz got 44.54% of the votes, Jobbik got 20.54% of the votes and the communist [[Hungarian Workers' Party]] got 0.58% of the votes. Thus, Eurosceptic parties in Hungary obtained 65.66% of the votes, one of the highest figures in Europe.

The green-liberal [[Politics Can Be Different]] classifies as a soft or reformist Eurosceptic party given its self-professed ''euro-critical'' stance. During the [[European Parliament election, 2014|European parliamentary campaign of 2014]] party Co-President [[András Schiffer]] described LMP as having a pronounced pro-integration position on [[Environmental policy of the European Union|environmental]], wage and [[European labour law|labour]] policy however, as supporting member state autonomy on the self-determination of local communities concerning land resources. So as to combat the differentiated integration of the [[multi-speed Europe]] which discriminates against Eastern and Southern member states, LMP would like to initiate an [[eco-social market economy]] within the union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=hu:Új politikai hangnemet szorgalmaz az LMP|trans-title=LMP to encourage new political voice|language=hu|url=http://www.hirado.hu/videok/?video=116590|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140513040417/http://www.hirado.hu/videok/?video=116590 |archivedate=13 May 2014|publisher=Hungarian News Broadcast|date=17 April 2014|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Five Star Movement]] (M5S), an [[anti-establishment]] movement founded by the former comedian [[Beppe Grillo]], is often considered a Eurosceptic party. The M5S gained 25.5% of vote in the [[Italian general election, 2013|2013 general election]], becoming the largest anti-establishment and Eurosceptic party in Europe. The party also advocates a non-binding referendum on the withdrawal of Italy from the [[Eurozone]] (but not from the European Union) and the return to the [[Italian lira|lira]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corriere.it/politica/13_maggio_23/grillo-euro-referendum_9fe952ea-c39b-11e2-8072-09f5b2e9767e.shtml |title=Grillo: «Referendum sull'euro entro un anno |work=Corriere della Sera |accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The M5S's popular support is evenly distributed all across Italy, but in 2013 the party was particularly strong in [[Sicily]], Liguria and [[Marche]], where it gained more than 30% of the vote.
Another Eurosceptic party is [[Lega Nord]], a [[regionalism (politics)|regionalist]] movement led by [[Matteo Salvini]] favouring Italy's exit from the Eurozone and the re-introduction of the lira. When in government, LN however approved the [[Treaty of Lisbon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Maurizio |last=Caprara |title= Passa all'unanimità il Trattato europeo |url= http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2008/luglio/24/Passa_all_unanimita_Trattato_europeo_co_9_080724090.shtml |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110722032012/http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2008/luglio/24/Passa_all_unanimita_Trattato_europeo_co_9_080724090.shtml |archivedate= 22 July 2011 |work=[[Corriere della Sera]] |location=Milan |date=24 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party won 6.2% of the vote in the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (Italy)|2014 European Parliament elections]], but two of its leading members are presidents of [[Lombardy]] and [[Veneto]] (where LN gained 40.9% of the vote in [[Venetian regional election, 2015|2015]]).

In the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (Italy)|European Parliament election, 2014]] the [[Five Star Movement]] came second, gaining 17 seats and 21.2% of the vote in contesting EP seats for the first time. [[Lega Nord]] took 5 seats and [[The Other Europe|The Other Europe with Tsipras]] gained 3 seats.

Other minor eurosceptic organizations include right-wing political parties (e.g., [[Brothers of Italy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=2 June 2017|title=The small political parties that risk obliteration under Italy's new electoral law|url=https://www.thelocal.it/20170602/the-small-political-parties-at-risk-under-italys-new-electoral-law|work=[[The Local]]|access-date=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tricolour Flame]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiammatricolore.com/chi-siamo/programma/|title=Programma del Movimento La Fiamma Tricolore|publisher=[[Tricolour Flame]]|access-date=16 August 2017|language=Italian|trans-title=Programme of the Movement Tricolour Flame}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New Force (Italy)|New Force]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ordinefuturo.net/2016/09/28/la-nuova-europa-sorge-a-est-intervista-a-roberto-fiore/|title=Intervista a Roberto Fiore|last=Durantini|first=Ermanno|date=28 September 2016|access-date=16 August 2017|language=Italian|trans-title=Interview with Roberto Fiore}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[National Front (Italy, 1997)|National Front]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontenazionale.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=782:solidarieta-ed-unione-europea&amp;catid=47&amp;Itemid=790|title=Solidarietà ed Unione Europea|date=21 January 2017|publisher=[[National Front (Italy, 1997)|National Front]]|access-date=16 August 2017|language=Italian|trans-title=Solidarity and the European Unione}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[CasaPound]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.casapounditalia.org/2014/03/intervista-simone-di-stefano-sullunione.html|title=Intervista a Simone Di Stefano sull'Unione europea|publisher=[[CasaPound]]|access-date=16 August 2017|language=Italian|trans-title=Interview with Simone Di Stefano on [[European Union]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[National Movement for Sovereignty]], the [[No Euro Movement]]), left-wing political parties (e.g., the [[Communist Party (Italy)|Communist Party]] of [[Marco Rizzo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=BeHALk8Irfc|title=''Marco Rizzo rips a copy of the Treaty of Rome (in Italian)''}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Italian Communist Party (2016)|Italian Communist Party]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilpartitocomunistaitaliano.it/2017/03/20/il-pci-alla-manifestazione-del-25-marzo-contro-lue-e-la-nato/|title=Il PCI alla manifestazione del 25 Marzo contro l'UE e la NATO|date=20 March 2017|publisher=[[Italian Communist Party (2016)|Italian Communist Party]]|access-date=16 August 2017|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and other political movements (e.g., the Sovereignist Front,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riconquistarelasovranita.it/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Documenti-ufficiali-FSI-1.pdf|title=Atto costitutivo e statuto|publisher= Sovereignist Front|access-date=16 August 2017|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Modern Monetary Theory|MMT]] Italy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://memmt.info/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/paper01_unione_europea.pdf|title=L'Unione europea|publisher=[[Modern Monetary Theory|MMT]] Italy|access-date=16 August 2017|language=Italian|trans-title=The European Union}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

According to the Standard [[Eurobarometer]] 87 conducted by the [[European Commission]] in the spring of 2017, 48% of Italians tend not to trust the [[European Union]] compared to 36% of [[Italians]] who trust it.&lt;ref name=eurobarometer&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinion/index.cfm/Survey/getSurveyDetail/instruments/STANDARD/yearFrom/1974/surveyKy/2142|title=Standard Eurobarometer 87|publisher=[[European Commission]]|access-date=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latvia===
The [[National Alliance (Latvia)|National Alliance]] ([[For Fatherland and Freedom/LNNK]]/[[All for Latvia!]]), [[Union of Greens and Farmers]] and [[For Latvia from the Heart]] are parties that are described by some political commentators as bearing soft Eurosceptic views.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.la.lv/eiroskepticisms-no-ideologijas-par-politisku-lidzekli/|title=Eiroskepticisms – no ideoloģijas par politisku līdzekli|last=|first=|date=|website=|language=Latvian|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small hard Eurosceptic party [[:lv:Eiroskeptiķu Rīcības partija|Eurosceptic Party of Action]] exists, but it has failed to gain any administrative seats throughout history of its existence.

===Malta===
The Labour Party was not in favour of Malta entering the European Union. However, it was in favour of a partnership with the EU. After a long battle, the Nationalist Party led by Eddie Fenech Adami won the referendum and the following election, making Malta one of the states to enter the European Union on 1 May 2004. The party is now pro-European.

[[File:Geert Wilders op Prinsjesdag 2014 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Geert Wilders]], leader of the [[Party for Freedom]], a hardline Dutch Eurosceptic party and a prominent anti-Islamic radicalism party.]]
Historically, the Netherlands have been a very pro-European country, being one of the six founding members of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] in 1952, and campaigning with much effort to include the United Kingdom into the Community in the 1970s and others after that. It has become slightly more Eurosceptic in the 2000s, [[Dutch European Constitution referendum, 2005|rejecting the European Constitution in 2005]] and complaining about the relatively high financial investment into the Union or the democratic deficit amongst other issues.
* The nationalist [[Party for Freedom]] (founded in 2006) wants the Netherlands to leave the EU in its entirety, because it believes the EU is undemocratic, costs money and cannot close the borders for immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://nos.nl/artikel/649997-pvv-eu-droom-is-nu-nachtmerrie.html |title=PVV: EU-droom is nu nachtmerrie |publisher=NOS |date=19 May 2014 |accessdate=26 May 2014|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Socialist Party (Netherlands)|Socialist Party]] believes the European Union has already brought Europe 50 years of peace and prosperity, and argues that European co-operation is essential for tackling global problems like climate change and international crime. However, the SP opines that the current Union is dominated by the big businesses and the big countries, while the labour movement, consumer organisations and smaller companies are often left behind. "Neoliberal" measures have supposedly increased social inequality, and perhaps the Union is expanding too fast and taking on too much power in issues that should be dealt with on a national level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sp.nl/europa/standpunten/europa/standpunten/cd_63/standpunt_over_europese_unie_superstaat_nee_samenwerken_ja.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140524220650/http://www.sp.nl/europa/standpunten/europa/standpunten/cd_63/standpunt_over_europese_unie_superstaat_nee_samenwerken_ja.html |archivedate=24 May 2014 |title=Standpunt: Europese Unie – superstaat nee, samenwerken ja |publisher=SP website |accessdate=26 May 2014|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The conservative Protestant [[Reformed Political Party]] and the [[ChristianUnion|Christian Union]] favour co-operation within Europe, but reject a superstate, especially one that is dominated by Catholics, or that infringes on religious rights and/or privileges.
* The ecologist [[Party for the Animals]] favours European co-operation, but believes the current EU does not respect animal rights enough and should have a more active policy on environment protection.

Despite these concerns, in 2014 the majority of the Dutch electorate continued to support parties that favour ongoing European integration: the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Social Democrats]], the [[Christian Democratic Appeal|Christian Democrats]], the [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy|Liberals]], but most of all the [[Democrats 66|(Liberal) Democrats]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://nos.nl/artikel/651490-stemden-we-voor-of-tegen-europa.html |title=Stemden we voor of tegen Europa? |publisher=NOS |date=23 May 2014 |accessdate=26 May 2014|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parties with mainly Eurosceptic views are [[Coalition for the Renewal of the Republic - Freedom and Hope|Liberty]], [[Congress of the New Right]], [[National Movement (Poland)|National Movement]] (together with [[Real Politics Union]]).

Former president of Poland [[Lech Kaczyński]] resisted giving his signature on behalf of Poland to the [[Treaty of Lisbon]], objecting specifically to the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]]. Subsequently, Poland got an [[opt-out]] from this charter. As Polish President, Kaczyński also opposed the Polish government's intentions to join the [[euro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hilary White|url=http://catholicexchange.com/poland-ratifies-lisbon-treaty-with-opt-out-from-eu-human-rights-charter|title=Poland Ratifies Lisbon Treaty with Opt-Out from EU Human Rights Charter|publisher=Catholic Exchange – Sophia Institute Press|date=9 April 2008|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20090525/business/polish-president-slams-government-eurozone-drive.258301|title=Polish President slams government eurozone drive|work=The Times|location=Malta|date=25 May 2009|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, it was reported that Euroscepticism was growing in Poland, which was thought to be due to the "economic crisis, concern over perceived interference from Brussels and migration". Polish president [[Andrzej Duda]] indicated that he wished for Poland to step back from further EU integration. He suggested that the country should "hold a referendum on joining the euro, resist further integration and fight the EU’s green policies", despite getting largest share of EU cash.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euronews.com/2015/07/08/poland-is-biggest-beneficiary-of-eu-funds-so-why-is-euroscepticism-on-the-rise Poland 'more anti-Brussels' despite getting largest share of EU cash].

===Portugal===
The main Eurosceptic parties in Portugal are [[National Renovator Party]] (PNR), [[Portuguese Communist Party]] (PCP), and [[Left Bloc]] (BE). Opinion polling in Portugal in 2015 indicated that 48 per cent tended not to trust the EU,&lt;ref name = "Eurobarometer Autumn 2015, Trust in EU"/&gt; while 79 per cent tended not to trust the Portuguese government (then led by [[Portugal Ahead]]).&lt;ref name = "Eurobarometer Autumn 2015, Trust in national government"/&gt; Eurosceptic political parties hold a combined total of 34 seats out of 230 in [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|Portugal's parliament]] (BE 19, PCP 15, PNR 0) and a combined total of 4 out of Portugal's 21 seats in the European parliament (PCP 3, BE 1, PNR 0).

In the last [[European Parliament election, 2014]], the [[Portuguese Communist Party]] won three seats and the [[Left Bloc]] won one seat.

Several parties espousing Eurosceptic views exist on the right, such as the [[New Republic (Romania)|New Republic]] the [[Greater Romania Party]] and [[Noua Dreaptă]], but as of August 2016 none of these parties are represented in European Parliament. Euroscepticism is relatively unpopular in Romania; all mainstream political parties are pro-European and a 2015 survey found 65% of Romanians had a positive view of the country's EU membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.stiripesurse.ro/sondaj-euroscepticismul-nu-prinde-la-romani_955221.html | title=SONDAJ - Euroscepticismul nu prinde la români | accessdate=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slovakia===
Parties with primarily hard Eurosceptic views represented in the National Council are [[People's Party - Our Slovakia]] and [[We Are Family (Slovakia)|We Are Family]]. Prominent Slovak Eurosceptic politicians include [[Andrej Danko]], [[Boris Kollár]] and [[Marian Kotleba]]. Soft Eurosceptic views are represented in [[Slovak National Party]] and [[New Majority (Slovakia)|New Majority]].

===Slovenia===
Parties with mainly Eurosceptic views are [[Slovenian National Party]] and [[United Left (Slovenia)|United Left]].

===Spain===
[[Candidatura d'Unitat Popular]], a left-wing to far-left political party with about 1,300 members,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |language=Spanish |url=http://www.ara.cat/politica/CUP-transparencia-comptes-militants-assemblees_0_1136886523.html|accessdate=26 October 2016|date=12 May 2014|work=ara.cat|title=La CUP incrementa un 10% les agrupacions locals i un 30% la militància el 2013|trans-title=}}&lt;/ref&gt; advocates independence for [[Catalonia]] outside of the European Union.

Spain was one of the few countries to vote Yes for the European Constitution in a referendum in February 2005, though by a lower margin in [[Catalonia]] and the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.es/constitucion_2004/resultados_electorales/default.html|title=CONSTITUCIÓN EUROPEA – Resultados del Referéndum 2005|trans-title=European Constitution – Referendum Results 2005|language=es|publisher=European Parliament|year=2005|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050226155240/http://www.europarl.es/constitucion_2004/resultados_electorales/default.html |archivedate=26 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, trust in the EU later declined. {{As of|2015}}, according to a Eurobarometer public opinion survey, 61 per cent of the Spanish people did not trust the EU, compared to 25% that trust it  (14% "don't know").&lt;ref name = "Eurobarometer Autumn 2015, Trust in EU"/&gt;

===Sweden===
[[File:EAP demonstrerar mot EU - 2008-05-01 - 2.jpg|thumb|130px|Anti-EU posters in Sweden]]
The [[Left Party of Sweden]] is against accession to the eurozone and wants Sweden to leave the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;Szczerbiak et al (2008), p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[right-wing populist]] party [[Sweden Democrats]] are also strongly against the Union but not to withdraw [[European Economic Area|EEA]] and [[Schengen Agreement]]. &lt;ref&gt;[https://sd.se/our-politics/eu/ Vår politik A till Ö | Sverigedemokraterna]. Sverigedemokraterna.se (9 october 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[June List]], a Eurosceptic list consisting of members from both the political right and left won three seats in the 2004 Elections to the European Parliament and sat in the EU-critical [[Independence/Democracy|IND/DEM group]] in the European Parliament. The movement {{ill|Folkrörelsen Nej till EU|sv}} favours a withdrawal from the EU.

Around 75% of the [[Riksdag]] members represent parties that officially supports the Sweden membership.

In the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (Sweden)|European Parliament election, 2014]], the [[Sweden Democrats]] gained 2 seats with 9.67% of the vote, up 6.4%, and the [[Left Party (Sweden)|Left Party]] took one seat with 6.3% of the vote.

Euroscepticism in the United Kingdom has been a significant element in British politics since the inception of the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC), the predecessor to the EU.

==Euroscepticism in other possible members==

===Iceland===
The three main Eurosceptic parties in Iceland are the [[Independence Party (Iceland)|Independence Party]], [[Left-Green Movement]] and the [[Progressive Party (Iceland)|Progressive Party]]. The Independence Party and the Progressive Party won the [[Icelandic parliamentary election, 2013|parliamentary election]] in April 2013 and they have halted the current negotiations with the European Union regarding Icelandic membership and tabled a parliamentary resolution on 21 February 2014 to withdraw the application completely.&lt;ref name="ruvli"&gt;{{cite news|title=Stjórnarsáttmáli kynntur á Laugarvatni|url=http://ruv.is/frett/stjornarsattmali-kynntur-a-laugarvatni|accessdate=22 May 2013|date=22 May 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111184157/http://ruv.is/frett/stjornarsattmali-kynntur-a-laugarvatni |archivedate=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="icelandover"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://euobserver.com/political/120501 |title=Iceland's EU bid is over, commission told |last=Fox |first=Benjamin |agency=Reuters |date=16 June 2013 |accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moldova===
The two main Eurosceptic parties in Moldova are the left-wing [[Party of Socialists of the Republic of Moldova]], which officially declared its main purpose to be the integration of Moldova in the [[Eurasian Economic Union]] and the [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova]], even if nowadays its leader speech became more soft on the issue of Euroscepticism. As of November 2014 both parties are represented in [[Moldovan Parliament]], with 45 MPs out of a total of 101 MPs.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

===Montenegro===
All [[Parliament of Montenegro|parliamentary parties]] in Montenegro officially support the country's bid for accession to the European Union. The only party that rejected the European integration and instead publicly advocates a tighter political and economic integration with Russia was the non-parliamentary far-right party [[Serb List (2012)|Serb List]].

===Norway===
{{see also|Norway–European Union relations}}
Norway has rejected EU membership in two referendums, [[Norwegian European Communities membership referendum, 1972|1972]] and [[Norwegian European Union membership referendum, 1994|1994]]. The [[Centre Party (Norway)|Centre Party]], [[Christian Democratic Party (Norway)|Christian Democratic Party]], [[Socialist Left Party (Norway)|Socialist Left Party]] and [[Liberal Party (Norway)|Liberal Party]] were against EU membership in both referendums.

Parties with mainly Eurosceptic views are the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]], [[United Russia]] and [[Liberal Democratic Party of Russia]].

Following the [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|2014 Crimean crisis]], the European Union issued sanctions on the Russian Federation "in response to the illegal annexation of Crimea and deliberate destabilisation of a neighbouring sovereign country".&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/newsroom/highlights/special-coverage/eu_sanctions/index_en.htm "EU sanctions against Russia over Ukraine crisis"]; via the official website of the European Union.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this, [[Alexey Borodavkin]] – Russia's permanent representative with the UN – said "The EU is committing a direct violation of human rights by its actions against Russia.

===San Marino===
A [[Sammarinese referendum, 2013|referendum]] was held in the [[landlocked]] [[microstate]] on 20 October 2013 in which the citizens were asked whether the country should submit an application to join the [[European Union]]. The proposal was rejected because of a low turnout, even though 50.3% of voters approved it. The "Yes" campaign was supported by the main left-wing parties ([[Socialist Party (San Marino)|Socialist Party]], [[United Left (San Marino)|United Left]]) and the [[Union for the Republic (San Marino)|Union for the Republic]] whereas the [[Sammarinese Christian Democratic Party]] suggested voting with a [[blank ballot]], the [[Popular Alliance (San Marino)|Popular Alliance]] declared itself neutral, and [[We Sammarinese]] and the RETE movement supported the "No" campaign. The [[Citizens' Rights Directive]], which defines the [[right of movement|right of free movement]] for the [[European citizens]], may have been an important reason for those voting no.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Keating|first=Dave|date=23 October 2013|title=San Marino rejects EU accession|url=http://www.politico.eu/article/san-marino-rejects-eu-accession/|work=[[Politico]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Marceddu|first=David|date=19 October 2013|title=San Marino al voto per l'ingresso in Ue.|url=http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2013/10/19/san-marino-al-voto-per-lingresso-in-europa-lega-in-trasferta-per-promuovere-no/743233/|work=[[Il Fatto Quotidiano]]|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=21 October 2013|title=San Marino dice no all'Europa: il referendum non raggiunge il quorum|url=http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2013/10/21/san-marino-dice-no-alleuropa-referendum-non-raggiunge-quorum/750525/|work=[[Il Fatto Quotidiano]]|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland===
{{see also|Switzerland–European Union relations}}

[[Switzerland]] has long been known for [[Swiss neutrality|its neutrality]] in international politics. Swiss voters rejected [[European Economic Area|EEA]] membership [[Swiss referendums, 1992|in 1992]], and EU membership [[Swiss referendums, 2001|in 2001]]. Despite the passing of several referendums calling for closer relations between [[Switzerland and the European Union]] such as the adoption of bilateral treaties and the joining of the [[Schengen Area]], a second referendum of the joining of the EEA or the EU is not expected,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/20-years-on_switzerland-poised-to-keep-eu-at-arm-s-length/34083578|title=Switzerland poised to keep EU at arm's length |date=2 December 2012|accessdate=10 April 2014|last=Miserez|first=Marc-Andre|publisher=[[swissinfo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the general public remains opposed to joining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/slow-and-cautious_swiss-still-prefer-bilateral-accords-with-eu/34078538|title=Swiss still prefer bilateral accords with EU |last=Keiser |first=Andreas |date=30 November 2012 |accessdate=10 April 2014 |publisher=Swissinfo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, the Swiss voters narrowly approved a [[Federal popular initiative "Against mass immigration"|referendum limiting the freedom of movement]] of EU citizens to Switzerland.

Eurosceptic political parties include the [[Swiss People's Party]], which is the largest [[List of political parties in Switzerland|political party in Switzerland]], with 29.4% of the popular vote as of the [[Swiss federal election, 2015|2015 federal election]]. Smaller Eurosceptic parties include, but are not limited to, the [[Federal Democratic Union of Switzerland|Federal Democratic Union]], the [[Ticino League]], and the [[Geneva Citizens' Movement]], all of which are considered right-wing parties.

In addition, the [[Campaign for an Independent and Neutral Switzerland]] is a political organisation in Switzerland that is strongly opposed to Swiss membership of or further integration otherwise with the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Kuenzi | first1=Renat | title='We're Not the Only EU Sceptics' | url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/conservative-pressure-group_-we-re-not-the-only-eu-sceptics-/38582264 | date=15 May 2014 | publisher=[[Swissinfo]] | accessdate=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Über Uns | url=http://auns.ch/ueber-uns/ | publisher=Campaign for an Independent and Neutral Switzerland official website | accessdate=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regionally, the German-speaking majority as well as the Italian-speaking areas are the most Eurosceptic, whilst [[Romandy|French-speaking Switzerland]] tends to be more pro-European integration. However, in the 2001 referendum, the majority of French-speakers voted against EU membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Goodenough | first1=Patrick | title=Swiss Say An Overwhelming 'No' To EU Membership Now | url=http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/swiss-say-overwhelming-no-eu-membership-now | publisher=cnsnews.com | accessdate=4 May 2016}}{{better source|date=May 2016|reason=This source says it was published in 2008, but it is clearly referring to the 2001 referendum and the UN referendum set to happen the following year as if it were in between those two events.}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2016 survey conducted by M.I.S Trend and published in ''[[L'Hebdo]]'', 69 percent of the Swiss population supports systematic border controls, and 53 percent want restrictions on the EU accord of the free movements of peoples and 14 percent want it completely abolished.&lt;ref name="tighten"&gt;{{cite web | title=Survey: Tighten Borders but Keep EU Accords, Say Swiss | url=http://www.thelocal.ch/20160519/survey-tighten-borders-but-keep-eu-accords-say-swiss | date=19 May 2016 | publisher=thelocal.ch | accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, 54% of the Swiss population said that if necessary, they would ultimately keep the freedom of movement of people's accord.&lt;ref name="tighten"/&gt;

===Turkey===
The two main Eurosceptic parties are the far-right ultranationalist, [[Nationalist Movement Party]] (MHP), which secured 16.29% of votes, and 40 seats in the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|Parliament]] at the [[Turkish general election, November 2015|last election]], and the [[Felicity Party]] (Saadet Partisi), a far-right [[Sunni Islam]]ist party, which has no seats in the Parliament, as it only secured 0.68% of the votes in the last election, far below the 10% threshold necessary to be represented in the Parliament.

Many left-wing nationalist and far-left parties hold no seats at parliament but they control many activist and student movements in Turkey. The [[Patriotic Party (Turkey)|Patriotic Party]] (formerly called Workers' Party) consider the European Union as a frontrunner of global imperialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ulusalkanal.com.tr/gundem/vatan-partisi-haric-hepsi-nato-ve-ab-yanlisi-iste-partilerin-dis-politikalari-h59483.html |title=Vatan Partisi hariç hepsi NATO ve AB yanlısı!

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1215">The concept of '''fiction-absolute''' exists firstly within the context of [[anthropology]], secondly within the study of [[group psychology]] and [[tribalism]].

The term was coined and defined by [[journalist]] [[Tom Wolfe]] in his 2006 [[Jefferson Lecture]] for the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.neh.gov/about/awards/jefferson-lecture/tom-wolfe-lecture&lt;/ref&gt;  Wolfe defined the term as the propaganda that a [[tribe]] or [[social group]] employs to explain why that group is the best of all groups and its people the best people. The term itself indicates that it is absolutist in that it defines in stark terms why members should prefer that tribe, and necessarily fictional because it is propaganda, although it might have some basis in truth. The fiction-absolute is essentially a [[tribe]]'s core propaganda. It can lead to [[Toleration|intolerance]] and forms of [[collective action]].

The fiction-absolute not only necessitates a harsh view of other groups, but also unaffiliated people and [[individualist]]s.

==Background==
Sá Carneiro was born in [[Vitória (Porto)|Vitória]], [[Porto]], the third of the five children of [[lawyer]] José Gualberto Chaves Marques de Sá Carneiro (1897–?) and Maria Francisca Judite Pinto da Costa Leite (1908–?) of the Counts of [[Lumbrales]] in Spain.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

==Career==
A lawyer by training, Sá Carneiro became a member of the [[National Assembly of Portugal|National Assembly]] in 1969&lt;ref name=rulers&gt;{{cite web|title=Index Sa|url=http://www.rulers.org/indexs1.html|publisher=Rulers|accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in turn, one of the leaders of the "Liberal Wing" which attempted to work for the gradual transformation of [[António de Oliveira Salazar]]'s dictatorship into a Western European democracy.

In May 1974, a month after the [[Carnation Revolution]], Sá Carneiro founded the [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Popular Democratic Party]] (PPD), together with [[Francisco Pinto Balsemão]], [[Joaquim Magalhães Mota]], [[Carlos Mota Pinto]], [[João Bosco Mota Amaral]], [[Alberto João Jardim]], [[António Barbosa de Melo]] and [[António Marques Mendes]], and became its secretary-general. The PPD was soon renamed the '''Social Democratic Party''' (PSD); despite Sá Carneiro's original claims to be leading a left-of-centre party, he and the party soon drifted to the right. He was [[minister without portfolio]] in a number of provisional governments, and was elected as a deputy to the Constitutional Assembly the next year.

In 1976, he was elected to the [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|Assembly of the Republic]]. In November 1977, he resigned his office as president of the party, only to be reelected to that office the next year.

In the general election of late 1979, he led the [[Democratic Alliance (Portugal)|Democratic Alliance]], a coalition of his Social Democratic Party, the right-wing [[Democratic and Social Centre – People's Party|Democratic and Social Centre Party]], and two smaller parties, to victory. The Alliance polled 45.2 percent of the popular vote and gained 128 of the 250 seats in the [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|Assembly of the Republic]]; 75 of these were from the PSD.  [[List of Presidents of Portugal|President]] [[António Ramalho Eanes]] subsequently called on him to form a government on 3 January 1980, and formed Portugal's first [[majority government]] since the [[Carnation Revolution]] of 1974. In a second general election held in October that year, the Democratic Alliance increased its majority. The Alliance received 47.2 percent of the popular vote and 134 seats, 82 of them from the PSD. Sá Carneiro's triumph appeared to augur well for the [[Portuguese presidential election, 1981|presidential election]] two months later, in which Sá Carneiro was supporting [[António Soares Carneiro]] (no relation).

==Death==
{{main|1980 Camarate air crash}}
[[File:Francisco.de.Sa.Carneiro.by.Patrick.Swift.1980.jpg|150px|thumb| ''Francisco de Sá Carneiro'', by [[Patrick Swift]], 1980; Following his election Sá Carneiro commissioned Swift to paint his portrait]]
His victory was short-lived, however. On 4 December 1980, while on his way to a presidential election rally in [[Porto]], the [[Cessna 421]] he was on crashed into a building in [[Camarate]], [[Loures]], soon after takeoff from [[Portela Airport|Lisbon Airport]]. Eyewitnesses claimed they saw pieces falling from the plane just moments after it took off. Rumours have continued to fuel [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] that the crash was in fact an [[assassination]], but no firm evidence has come to light. There were even different theories as to whom would have been the target of such an assassination, as Francisco de Sá Carneiro was travelling with the Defence Minister, [[Adelino Amaro da Costa]], who had said he had documents relating to the [[October surprise conspiracy theory]] and was planning on taking them to the [[United Nations General Assembly]].

Dependent to a considerable extent on Sá Carneiro's personal popularity, the Democratic Alliance was unable to maintain its momentum in the wake of his death. Faced with a national crisis, the public rallied behind the incumbent President, António Ramalho Eanes, who easily defeated the Alliance candidate in the presidential election a few days later.

The airport where Sá Carneiro was heading has been named after him as [[Francisco de Sá Carneiro Airport]], despite objections{{by whom|date=October 2013}} that it would be in bad taste to name an airport after someone who died in a plane crash.

==Family==
[[File:Sá Carneiro.jpg|thumb|180px|''Sá Carneiro'', painting by Carlos Botelho (''Bottelho'')]]
He was married to Isabel Maria Ferreira Nunes de Matos (b. [[Porto]], [[Miragaia]], 1936), and had five children: 
* Francisco Nunes de Matos de Sá Carneiro, unmarried and without issue
* Isabel Maria Nunes de Matos de Sá Carneiro, unmarried and without issue
* Maria Teresa Nunes de Matos de Sá Carneiro, and had two sons:
** ''Francisco de Sá Carneiro e Nogueira (b. [[Porto]], [[Santo Ildefonso]], 1986)''
** ''Lourenço de Sá Carneiro e Nogueira (b. [[Porto]], [[Santo Ildefonso]],  1988)''
* José Nunes de Matos de Sá Carneiro (b. [[Porto]], [[Cedofeita]], 1963), married in [[Mealhada]], [[Luso (Mealhada)|Luso]], 1991 Isabel Maria Guedes de Macedo Girão (b. [[Porto]], [[Ramalde]], 1965), and had an only daughter:
** Inês de Macedo Girão de Sá Carneiro (b. [[Porto]], [[Santo Ildefonso]], 1992)
* Pedro Nunes de Matos de Sá Carneiro (b. [[Porto]], 1964), married to Maria Benedita de Matos Chaves Pinheiro Torres, of the Barons of a Torre de Pero Palha, b. 1967, and had an only daughter:
** Maria Teresa Pinheiro Torres de Sá Carneiro (b. [[Porto]],  2000)

Later in life he lived together with [[Ebbe Merete Seidenfaden Abecassis|Snu Abecassis]], who died in the same accident as Sá Carneiro.

== Ideological assessment and legacy ==

Sá Carneiro started his political life in the youth of the [[Acção Católica]] (the Portuguese [[Catholic Action]]), being his first activity in civic life to write a letter to [[Marcelo Caetano]] requesting the return of the [[António VIII Ferreira Gomes]], the [[exiled]] [[pro-democracy]] [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Porto, Portugal|bishop of Oporto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=HZ7TpQs0bsE#t=1m44s|title=Official PDP/SDP Sá Carneiro's death 25th Anniversary documentary II}}, 1:44 – 1:58&lt;/ref&gt; He probably had links with the [[Catholic trade unions|Catholic syndicalist]] organizations and [[Christian Socialism]] in general. He was very influenced by Catholic [[Personalism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tsdnacional.com/pdf/mocao-sn.pdf |title=X CONGRESSO da TSD – Trabalhadores Social Democratas (Social Democratic Workers) |accessdate=7 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041021093509/http://www.tsdnacional.com/pdf/mocao-sn.pdf |archivedate=21 October 2004 }} (''Portuguese''), p. 7: «O sindicalismo que defendemos e procuramos praticar tem esta matriz social democrata e personalista. A sociedade que queremos ajudar a construir tem neste pensamento os seus alicerces. (...) Como pensou e defendeu Francisco Sá Carneiro.» [«The [[syndicalism]] we defend and try to practice has this social democratic and personalist matrix. The society that we want to help to build has in this thought its foundations. (...) As thought and defended Francisco Sá Carneiro.»]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Humanism]] (especially its [[Christian Humanism|Christian version]]).

Sá Carneiro tried to adapt the [[social-democratic]] ideas of the likes of [[Eduard Bernstein]], [[Karl Kautsky]], and the post-1945 [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] to the cultural context of Portugal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tsdnacional.com/pdf/mocao-sn.pdf |title=X CONGRESSO da TSD |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041021093509/http://www.tsdnacional.com/pdf/mocao-sn.pdf |archivedate=21 October 2004 |df=dmy }} p. 6: «Sá Carneiro sabia que não há modelos de ideário político que se transponham mecanicamente de umas sociedades para as outras. Foi assim que, embora tomando em consideração o pensamento social democrata reformista de teóricos da Europa germânica e anglo-saxónica, concebeu um projecto de social democracia adaptado à idiossincrasia do povo português e à sua tradição histórica, tão marcada de experiência personalista.» («Sá Carneiro knew that there were not models of political ideary that transposed mechanically from some societies for the others. It was like this that, though taking in consideration the social democratic [[Reformist]] thought of the [[theory|theoreticians]] of [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] and [[Anglo-Saxon]] [[Europe]], conceived a social democracy project adapted to the idiosyncrasy of the Portuguese people and to its historical tradition, so marked by the personalist experience.»)&lt;/ref&gt; and its traditionally [[Catholic]] society. The [[Godesberg Program]] had a very important influence in his social democratic thought as it became the model for his party and its cut with [[Marxist]] [[socialism]].

Despite having an anti-[[collectivist]] and anti-[[Statism|statist]] party with an emphasis on [[civil liberties|personal rights]] and [[moral responsibility|duties]] that was responsible for privatizing the industrial sectors nationalized during the revolutionary period,&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=TwwfAZaLPSk#t=1m35s|title=Official PDP/SDP Sá Carneiro's death 25th Anniversary documentary II}}, 1:35 – 1:35&lt;/ref&gt; he increased social spending during his term,&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=TwwfAZaLPSk#t=1m56s|title=Official PDP/SDP Sá Carneiro's death 25th Anniversary documentary II}}, 1:56 – 2:02&lt;/ref&gt; supported [[land reform]] and its [[Redistribution (economics)|redistribution]] in Alentejo&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=TwwfAZaLPSk#t=1m36s|title=Official PDP/SDP Sá Carneiro's death 25th Anniversary documentary II}}, 1:36 – 1:44&lt;/ref&gt; and he was proud that his party had been adopted by the working, [[Middle class|middle-class]] [[blue collar|blue-collar worker]] and [[middle-low class]] workers and that his party defended "the construction of a socialist society in liberty".&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=aRJDgooW4MI#t=1m08s|title=Popularist constants John Dewey and Francisco Sá Carneiro, 1:08 – 1:39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to all these specificities, he called his party's ideology "Portuguese Social Democracy".

He was recognized as [[Populism|populist]] by both supporters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo_search.php?oid=77952785435&amp;view=user#/photo.php?pid=30194690&amp;op=1&amp;o=user&amp;view=user&amp;subj=77952785435&amp;aid=-1&amp;oid=77952785435&amp;id=1434575431|title=Reformist Centre Popular Pan-National photos}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (''English'')&lt;/ref&gt; neutral analysts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oam0907.wordpress.com/2007/09/30/portugal-7/|title=O Populismo Laranja (The Orange Populism)}} (''Portuguese''), o António Maria blog, third paragraph: «Em primeiro lugar, porque a matriz ideológica e social do PPD-PSD é geneticamente populista, na modulação muito própria que lhe foi dada desde o início por Francisco Sá Carneiro» ("In the first place, because the ideological and social matrix of the PDP-SDP is genetically populist, in the very specific modulation that was given to it since the beginning by Francisco Sá Carneiro")&lt;/ref&gt; and opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://31daarmada.blogs.sapo.pt/1974497.html|title=Textos de Francisco Sá Carneiro (Texts of Francisco Sá Carneiro), 31 da Armada blog}} (''Portuguese''), eleventh comment: «Sá Carneiro, seria hoje um populista como Santana Lopes ou pior ainda... !! (João Jardim... !)» («Sá Carneiro, would be today a populist like [[Santana Lopes]] or even worse...!! ([[Alberto João Jardim|João Jardim]]...!)»)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Works ==
Sá Carneiro was the author of various works, among them:

*''Uma Tentativa de Participação Política'' (An Attempt of Political Participation) (1973)
*''Por uma Social-Democracia Portuguesa'' (For a Portuguese Social Democracy) (1975)
*''Poder Civil; Autoridade Democrática e Social-Democracia'' (Civilian Power; Democratic Authority and Social Democracy (1975)

{{Indian Air Force}}
The [[Indian Air Force]] has been undergoing a modernization program to replace and upgrade its aging and outdated equipment since the late 90’s to advanced standards. For that reason it has started procuring and developing aircraft, weapons, associated technologies, and infrastructures. Some of these programs date back to the late 80’s. The primary focus of current modernization and upgrades is to replace aircraft purchased from the Soviet Union that currently form the backbone of the Air Force.

==Upgrades==
The Indian Air Force began an upgrade of its [[MiG-29]] fleet in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ACM FH Major: IAF strengthening India's standing in international arena news |url=http://www.domain-b.com/aero/June/2007/20070602_strengthening.htm|publisher=domain-b.com |date=2 June 2007 |accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  India awarded Russia a US$865 million contract to upgrade its air superiority MiG-29 into multi-role MiG-29UPG standard warplanes, on Monday 10 March 2008. According to the deal, Russia will re-arm the twin-engined MiG-29s with air-to-air missiles, and the upgraded MiGs will feature increased fuel capacity and will include latest avionics. The design is a new modification intended for the MiG-29s used by Indian Air Force. It made its maiden flight on 4 February 2011. The standard includes the new Zhuk-M radar, new avionics, an IFR probe as well as new enhanced RD-33 series 3 turbojet engines. The modernisation is part of a $900 million contract to upgrade the 66 fighter fleet.&lt;ref name="pib.nic.in"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pib.nic.in/release/release.asp?relid=54392|title=Upgradation of MIG-29 squadrons|date=23 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="en.rian.ru"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/mlitary_news/20090918/156169883.html|title=Russia to complete overhaul of 63 Indian fighter jets in 2013|date=18 September 2009|author=RIA Novosti}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sepecat Jaguar]] remains an important element of the Indian military as, along with the [[Mirage 2000]], the Jaguar has been described as one of the few aircraft capable of performing the nuclear strike role with reasonable chances of success.&lt;ref&gt;Tellis 2001, p. 533.&lt;/ref&gt;
As the aircraft aged, the avionics were viewed as lacking suitable components for the ground attack mission such as terrain-following radar, GPS navigation, and modern night-flight systems;&lt;ref&gt;Tellis 2001, p. 546.&lt;/ref&gt; consequently, several upgrades were carried out in the mid-1990s, including the addition of the [[Litening]] targeting pod. India placed an order for 17 additional upgraded Jaguar aircraft from [[Hindustan Aeronautics]] in 1999 and a further 20 in 2001–2002.&lt;ref name="Wilson p68"&gt;Wilson and McBride 2009, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian Air Force plans to upgrade up to 125 Jaguars starting in 2013 by upgrading the avionics (including multi-mode radar, auto-pilot and other changes) as part of the DARIN III programme and additionally is considering fitting more powerful engines, [[Honeywell/ITEC F124|Honeywell F125IN]] to improve performance, particularly at medium altitudes.&lt;ref name="Wilson p71"&gt;Wilson and McBride 2009, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--- has to be rewritten as this is a close copy of the HAL website---The latest upgrade program DARIN III (Display Attack Ranging Inertial Navigation) has also been approved. In addition to new avionics and equipment installed as part of DARIN II upgrade, DARIN III would feature modified avionics architecture, new cockpit with dual SMD, solid-state flight data recorder and solid-state video recording system, auto-pilot system, integration of new multi-mode radar on Jaguar IS (currently only Jaguar IM are fitted with radars). Major structural modification would be carried out on the air-frame to accommodate the radar. Initial Jaguars delivered to IAF were powered by two Adour 804E; further deliveries were powered by Adour Mk811. All the current Jaguars of IAF are powered by Adour Mk811. DARIN III upgrade will cause additional weight problems due to addition of new avionics and radar, resulting in it becoming underpowered.

Engine replacement for Jaguars is also in progress. The engine replacement programme is not a part of DARIN III upgrades.----appears to be a copyviol----&gt;

HAL has developed the [[HAL HJT-36]] Sitara intermediate jet trainer aircraft for the IAF which carried out its maiden test flight in 2003. These aircraft are scheduled to replace the aging HJT-16 Kiran mk.I. The Indian Air Force has placed an order for 73 aircraft, of which the first 12 are in production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://img196.imageshack.us/img196/1378/hal3.jpg |title=Vayu aerospace article |date= |accessdate=23 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The order by the Indian Air Force could eventually grow to 250 aircraft. Two prototype aircraft have been built. These aircraft have undergone 280 test flights.

;HAL HTT-40
Indian defense ministry has selected 68 HAL HTT-40 trainers and 38 [[Pilatus Aircraft|Pilatus]] trainers to replace its current trainer aircraft fleet stating that this move was "commercially viable".&lt;ref name="The Indian Express"/&gt;

===Helicopters===

;HAL Light Utility Helicopter
The [[Hindustan Aeronautics Limited]] is now developing the [[HAL Light Utility Helicopter]] (LUH) to replace the fleet of Cheetah and Chetak helicopters. The project is in hardware realization design phase. The flight trials have begun in September,2016.&lt;ref name=jane1&gt;http://www.janes.com/article/54146/hal-pushing-for-luh-first-flight-in-december&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="economictimes.indiatimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/News_by_Industry/HAL_looks_for_foreign_partners/articleshow/3539169.cms|title=HAL looks at foreign partners for chopper project|date=29 September 2008|accessdate=19 July 2010|work=The Times Of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This article reviews the dominant liberal approaches, including women in development (WID), women and development (WAD), gender and development (GAD) and neoliberal frameworks (Singh, 2007). There is significant overlap among these approaches (for example, WID can be seen as an early version of the neoliberal framework). (GAD) is most concerned with equity and empowerment.

==Early approaches==

===Women in development (WID)===
'''Theoretical approach'''

The term “women in development” was originally coined by a Washington-based network of female development professionals in the early 1970s&lt;ref name="Tinker1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=Irene Tinker|title=Persistent Inequalities: Women and World Development|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R6aCgdeafDAC|year=1990|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-506158-1|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; who sought to question [[trickle down effect|trickle down]] existing theories of development by contesting that economic development had identical impacts on men and women.&lt;ref name="Razavi1995p2"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Razavi |first=Shahrashoub  |last2=Miller |first2=Carol |year=1995 |title=From WID to GAD: Conceptual shifts in the Women and Development discourse |url=http://unrisd.org/unrisd/website/document.nsf/ab82a6805797760f80256b4f005da1ab/d9c3fca78d3db32e80256b67005b6ab5/$FILE/opb1.pdf |journal=United Nations Research Institute Occasional Paper series |publisher=United Nations Research Institute for Social Development |volume=1 |page=2 |accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Women in Development movement (WID) gained momentum in the 1970s, driven by the resurgence of women's movements in developed countries, and particularly through liberal feminists striving for equal rights and labour opportunities in the United States.&lt;ref name="Razavi1995p3"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Razavi |first=Shahrashoub  |last2=Miller |first2=Carol |year=1995 |title=From WID to GAD: Conceptual shifts in the Women and Development discourse |url=http://unrisd.org/unrisd/website/document.nsf/ab82a6805797760f80256b4f005da1ab/d9c3fca78d3db32e80256b67005b6ab5/$FILE/opb1.pdf |journal=United Nations Research Institute Occasional Paper series |publisher=United Nations Research Institute for Social Development |volume=1 |page=3 |accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Liberal feminism]], postulating that women's disadvantages in society may be eliminated by breaking down customary expectations of women by offering better education to women and introducing equal opportunity programmes,&lt;ref name="Connell1987"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Connell|title=Gender and power: society, the person, and sexual politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qywNrBHAGxwC|year=1987|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-1430-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; had a notable influence on the formulation of the WID approaches.&lt;ref name="Razavi1995p3"/&gt;

The focus of the 1970s [[feminist movements]] and their repeated calls for employment opportunities in the development agenda meant that particular attention was given to the productive labour of women, leaving aside reproductive concerns and social welfare.&lt;ref name="Razavi1995p3"/&gt; This approach was pushed forward by WID advocates, reacting to the general policy environment maintained by early colonial authorities and post-war development authorities, wherein inadequate reference to the work undertook by women as producers was made, as they were almost solely identified as their roles as wives and mothers.&lt;ref name="Razavi1995p3"/&gt; The WID's opposition to this “welfare approach” was in part motivated by the work of Danish economist [[Ester Boserup]] in the early 1970s, who challenged the assumptions of the said approach and highlighted the role women by women in the agricultural production and economy.&lt;ref name="Razavi1995p4"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Razavi |first=Shahrashoub  |last2=Miller |first2=Carol |year=1995 |title=From WID to GAD: Conceptual shifts in the Women and Development discourse |url=http://unrisd.org/unrisd/website/document.nsf/ab82a6805797760f80256b4f005da1ab/d9c3fca78d3db32e80256b67005b6ab5/$FILE/opb1.pdf |journal=United Nations Research Institute Occasional Paper series |publisher=United Nations Research Institute for Social Development |volume=1 |page=4 |accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
A dominant strand of thinking within WID sought to link women's issues with development, highlighting how such issues acted as impediments to economic growth; this “relevance” approach stemmed from the experience of WID advocates which illustrated that it was more effective if demands of equity and social justice for women were strategically linked to mainstream development concerns, in an attempt to have WID policy goals taken up by development agencies.&lt;ref name="Razavi1995p6"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Razavi |first=Shahrashoub  |last2=Miller |first2=Carol |year=1995 |title=From WID to GAD: Conceptual shifts in the Women and Development discourse |url=http://unrisd.org/unrisd/website/document.nsf/ab82a6805797760f80256b4f005da1ab/d9c3fca78d3db32e80256b67005b6ab5/$FILE/opb1.pdf |journal=United Nations Research Institute Occasional Paper series |publisher=United Nations Research Institute for Social Development |volume=1 |page=6 |accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Women in Development approach was the first contemporary movement to specifically integrate women in the broader development agenda and acted as the precursor to later movements such as the Women and Development (WAD), and ultimately, the Gender and Development approach, departing from some of the criticized aspects imputed to the WID.

'''Criticism'''

The WID movement faced a number of criticisms; such an approach had in some cases the unwanted consequence of depicting women as a unit whose claims are conditional on its productive value, associating increased female status with the value of cash income in women's lives.&lt;ref name="Razavi1995pi"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Razavi |first=Shahrashoub  |last2=Miller |first2=Carol |year=1995 |title=From WID to GAD: Conceptual shifts in the Women and Development discourse |url=http://unrisd.org/unrisd/website/document.nsf/ab82a6805797760f80256b4f005da1ab/d9c3fca78d3db32e80256b67005b6ab5/$FILE/opb1.pdf |journal=United Nations Research Institute Occasional Paper series |publisher=United Nations Research Institute for Social Development |volume=1 |page=i |accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WID view and similar classifications based on Western feminism, applied a general definition to the status, experiences and contributions of women and the solutions for women in Third World countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41445662|title=Producing women and progress in Zimbabwe : narratives of identity and work from the 1980s|last=1949-|first=Sylvester, Christine,|date=2000|publisher=Heinemann|isbn=0325000700|location=Portsmouth, NH|oclc=41445662}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the WID, although it advocated for greater [[gender equality]], did not tackle the unequal gender relations and roles at the basis of women's exclusion and gender subordination rather than addressing the stereotyped expectations entertained by men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unsdsn.org/files/2013/05/130520-Women-Economic-Development-Paper-for-HLP.pdf |title=Women’s role in economic development:  Overcoming the constraints |last1=Bradshaw |first1=Sarah |date=May 2013 |website=UNSDSN |publisher=UNSDSN |accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the underlying assumption behind the call for the integration of the [[Third World]] women with their national economy was that women were not already participating in development, thus downplaying women's roles in household production and informal economic and political activities.&lt;ref name="Koczberski1998"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Koczberski |first=Sarah |year=1998 |title=Women In Development: A Critical Analysis |journal=Third World Quarterly |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis, Ltd. |volume=19 |issue=3 |page=399 |doi=10.1080/01436599814316}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WID was also criticized for its views on the fact that women's status will improve by moving into “productive employment”, implying that the move to the “modern sector” need to be made from the “traditional” sector to achieve self-advancement, further implying that “traditional” work roles often occupied by women in the developing world were inhibiting to self-development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Koczberski |first=Sarah |year=1998 |title=Women In Development: A Critical Analysis |journal=Third World Quarterly |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis, Ltd. |volume=19 |issue=3 |page=400 |doi=10.1080/01436599814316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women and development (WAD)===

Women and development (WAD) is a theoretical and practical approach to development. It was introduced into [[gender studies]] scholarship in the second half of the 1970s, following its origins, which can be traced to the [[First World Conference on Women]] in Mexico City in 1975,&lt;ref name="choike.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/beijing/mexico.html|title=First World Conference on Women, Mexico 1975|last=|first=|date=|website=www.un.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; organized by the UN.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unsystem.org/content/first-world-conference-women-1975|title=First World Conference on Women (1975) {{!}} United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination|website=www.unsystem.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a departure from the previously predominant theory, WID (Women in Development) and is often mistaken for WID, but has many distinct characteristics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Theoretical approach'''

WAD arose out of a shift in thinking about women's role in development, and concerns about the explanatory limitations of [[modernization theory]].&lt;ref name="Rathgeber, Eva M 1990"&gt;Rathgeber, Eva M. 1990. “WID, WAD, GAD: Trends in Research and Practice.” The Journal of Developing Areas. 24(4) 289-502&lt;/ref&gt; While previous thinking held that development was a vehicle to advance women, new ideas suggested that development was only made possible by the involvement of women, and rather than being simply passive recipients of [[development aid]], they should be actively involved in development projects.&lt;ref name="choike.org"/&gt; WAD took this thinking a step further and suggested that women have always been an integral part of development, and did not suddenly appear in the 1970s as a result of exogenous development efforts.&lt;ref name="Rathgeber, Eva M 1990"/&gt; The WAD approach suggests that there be women-only development projects that were theorized to remove women from the patriarchal hegemony that would exist if women participated in development alongside men in a patriarchal culture, though this concept has been heavily debated by theorists in the field.&lt;ref name="Parpart, Jane L. 2000"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Barriteau | first1 = Eudine | last2 = Connelly | first2 = Patricia | last3 = Parpart | first3 = Jane L | author-link1 = Eudine Barriteau | title = Theoretical perspectives on gender and development | publisher = International Development Research Centre (IDRC) | location = Ottawa | year = 2000 | isbn = 9780889369108 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, WAD is differentiated from WID by way of the theoretical framework upon which it was built. Rather than focus specifically on women's relationship to development, WAD focuses on the relationship between patriarchy and capitalism. This theory seeks to understand women's issues from the perspectives of [[neo-Marxism]]  and [[dependency theory]], though much of the theorizing about WAD remains undocumented due to the persistent and pressing nature of development work in which many WAD theorists engage.&lt;ref name="Parpart, Jane L. 2000"/&gt;

'''Practical approach'''

The WAD paradigm stresses the relationship between women, and the work that they perform in their societies as economic agents in both the public and domestic spheres. It also emphasizes the distinctive nature of the roles women play in the maintenance and development of their societies, with the understanding that purely the integration of women into development efforts would serve to reinforce the existing structures of inequality present in societies overrun by patriarchal interests. In general, WAD is thought to offer a more critical conceptualization of women's position that does WID.&lt;ref name="Rathgeber, Eva M 1990"/&gt;

The WAD approach emphasizes the distinctive nature of women's knowledge, work, goals, and responsibilities, as well as advocating for the recognition of their distinctiveness. This fact, combined with a recognized tendency for development agencies to be dominated by patriarchal interests, is at the root of the women-only initiatives introduced by WAD subscribers.&lt;ref name="Parpart, Jane L. 2000"/&gt;

'''Criticism'''

Some of the common critiques of the WAD approach include concerns that the women-only development projects would struggle, or ultimately fail, due to their scale, and the marginalized status of these women. Furthermore, the WAD perspective suffers from a tendency to view women as a class, and pay little attention to the differences among women (such as feminist concept of [[intersectionality]]), including race and ethnicity, and prescribe development endeavors that may only serve to address the needs of a particular group. While an improvement on WID, WAD fails to fully consider the relationships between [[patriarchy]], modes of production, and the marginalization of women. It also presumes that the position of women around the world will improve when international conditions become more equitable. Additionally, WAD has been criticized for its singular preoccupation with the productive side of women's work, while it ignores the reproductive aspect of women's work and lives. Therefore, WID/WAD intervention strategies have tended to concentrate on the development of income-generating activities without taking into account the time burdens that such strategies place on women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pepe|first=Roberts|date=April 1979|title=The Integration of Women into the Development Process: Some Conceptual Problem|url=https://opendocs.ids.ac.uk/opendocs/bitstream/handle/123456789/10815/IDSB_10_3_10.1111-j.1759-5436.1979.mp10003013.x.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y|journal=IDS Bulletin|volume=10 (3)|pages=60–66|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Value is placed on income-generating activities, and none is ascribed to social and cultural reproduction.&lt;ref name="Rathgeber, Eva M 1990"/&gt;

===Gender and development (GAD)===
'''Theoretical approach'''

The Gender and Development (GAD) approach focuses on the socially constructed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bertrand|first=Tietcheu|title=Being Women and Men in Africa Today: Approaching Gender Roles in Changing African Societies|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  differences between men and women, the need to challenge existing gender roles and relations,&lt;ref name="Reeves 2000 8"&gt;{{cite book|last=Reeves|first=Hazel|title=Gender and Development: Concepts and Definitions|year=2000|location=Brighton|isbn=1 85864 381 3|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the creation and effects of class differences on development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This approach was majorly influenced by the writings of academic scholars such as Oakley (1972) and Rubin (1975), who argue the social relationship between men and women have systematically subordinated women,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moser|first=Caroline|title=Gender Planning and Development. Theory, Practice and Training|year=1993|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gender Planning and Development.

They state that colonialism imposed more than a 'value system' upon developing nations, it introduced a system of economics 'designed to promote capital accumulation which caused class differentiation'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

GAD departs from WID, which discussed women's subordination and lack of inclusion in discussions of international development without examining broader systems of gender relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Razavi|first=Shahrashoub|author2=Carol Miller|title=From WID to GAD: Conceptual Shifts in the Women and Development Discourse|date=1 February 1995|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by this work, by the late 1970s, some practitioners working in the development field questioned focusing on women in isolation.&lt;ref name="Razavi 1995 12"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Razavi|first=Shahrashoub|author2=Carol Miller|title=From WID to GAD: Conceptual Shifts in the Women and Development Discourse|date=1 February 1995|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  GAD challenged the WID focus on women as an important ‘target group’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Razavi|first=Shahrashoub|author2=Carol Miller|title=From WID to GAD: Conceptual Shifts in the Women and Development Discourse|date=1 February 1995|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ‘untapped resources’ for development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moser|first=Caroline|title=Gender Planning and Development. Theory, Practice and Training|year=1993|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-203-41194-3 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; GAD marked a shift in thinking about the need to understand how women and men are socially constructed and how ‘those constructions are powerfully reinforced by the social activities that both define and are defined by them.’&lt;ref name="Razavi 1995 12" /&gt; GAD focuses primarily on the gendered division of labor and gender as a relation of power embedded in institutions.&lt;ref name="Reeves 2000 8" /&gt; Consequently, two major frameworks ‘Gender roles’ and ‘social relations analysis’ are used in this approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Razavi|first=Shahrashoub|author2=Carol Miller|title=From WID to GAD: Conceptual Shifts in the Women and Development Discourse|date=1 February 1995|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Gender roles' focuses on the social construction of identities within the household; it also reveals the expectations from ‘maleness and femaleness’&lt;ref name="Razavi 1995 12" /&gt; in their relative access to resources. 'Social relations analysis' exposes the social dimensions of hierarchical power relations embedded in social institutions, as well as its determining influence on ‘the relative position of men and women in society.’&lt;ref name="Razavi 1995 12" /&gt; This relative positioning tends to discriminate against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reeves|first=Hazel|title=Gender and Development: Concepts and Definitions|year=2000|location=Brighton|isbn=1 85864 381 3|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike WID, the GAD approach is not concerned specifically with women, but with the way in which a society assigns roles, responsibilities and expectations to both women and men. GAD applies [[gender analysis]] to uncover the ways in which men and women work together, presenting results in neutral terms of economics and efficiency.{{sfn|Shifting views...}}In an attempt to create gender equality, (denoting women having same opportunities as men, including ability to participate in the public sphere;&lt;ref&gt;Development Assistance Committee (DAC), 1998, p.7&lt;/ref&gt; GAD policies aims to redefine traditional gender role expectations. Women are expected to fulfill household management tasks, home based production as well as bearing and raising children and caring for family members. The role of a wife is largely interpreted as 'the responsibilities of motherhood'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Razavi|first=Shahrashoub|author2=Carol Miller|title=From WID to GAD: Conceptual Shifts in the Women and Development Discourse|date=1 February 1995|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men however, are expected to be breadwinners whom are associated with paid work, and market production.&lt;ref name="Reeves 2000 8" /&gt; In the labor market, women tend to earn less than men. For instance, 'a study by the Equality and Human Rights Commission found massive pay inequities in some United Kingdom's top finance companies, women received around 80 percent less performance-related pay than their male colleagues.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Prügl|first=Elizabeth|title=''If Lehman Brothers Had Been Lehman Sisters...'': Gender and Myth in the Aftermath of the Financial Crisis|journal=International Political Sociology|date=14 March 2012|volume=6|issue=1|page=25|doi=10.1111/j.1749-5687.2011.00149.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response to pervasive gender inequalities, [[Fourth World Conference on Women#Beijing Platform for Action|Beijing Platform for Action]] established [[gender mainstreaming]] in 1995 as a strategy across all policy areas at all levels of governance for achieving gender equality.

[[Caroline Moser]] developed the [[Moser Gender Planning Framework]] for GAD-oriented development planning in the 1980s while working at the Development Planning Unit of the [[University of London]]. Working with Caren Levy, she expanded it into a methodology for gender policy and planning.{{sfn|March|Smyth|Mukhopadhyay|1999|pp = 55}}
The Moser framework follows the Gender and Development approach in emphasizing the importance of gender relations.
As with the WID-based [[Harvard Analytical Framework]], it includes a collection of quantitative empirical facts. Going further, it investigates the reasons and processes that lead to conventions of access and control. 
The Moser Framework includes gender roles identification, gender needs assessment, disaggregating control of resources and decision making within the household, planning for balancing work and household responsibilities, distinguishing between different aims in interventions and involving women and gender-aware organizations in planning.{{sfn|Van Marle|2006|pp = 126}}

'''Criticisms'''

GAD has been criticized for emphasizing the social differences between men and women while neglecting the bonds between them and also the potential for changes in roles. Another criticism is that GAD does not dig deeply enough into social relations and so may not explain how these relations can undermine programs directed at women. It also does not uncover the types of trade-offs that women are prepared to make for the sake of achieving their ideals of marriage or motherhood.{{sfn|Shifting views...}} Another criticism is that the GAD perspective is theoretically distinct from WID, but in practice, a program seem to have the element of the two. Whilst many development agencies are now committed to a gender approach, in practice, the primary institutional perspective remain focused on a WID approach.&lt;ref name="Reeves 2000 33"&gt;{{cite book|last=Reeves|first=Hazel|title=Gender and Development: Concepts and Definitions|year=2000|location=Brighton|isbn=1 85864 381 3|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a slippage in reality where gender mainstreaming is often based in a single normative perspective as synonymous to women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=True|first=J|title=Feminist Strategies in Global Governance: Gender Mainstreaming|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Development agencies still advance gender transformation to mean economic betterment for women.&lt;ref name="Reeves 2000 33" /&gt;

==Neoliberal approaches==

===Gender and neoliberal development institutions===
Neoliberalism consist of policies that will privatize public industry, deregulate any laws or policies that interfere with the free flow of the market and cut back on all social services. This policies were often introduced to many low-income countries through structural adjustment programs (SAPs) by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender, Development, and Globalization:Economics as if All People Mattered.|last=Beneria|first=Lourdes|last2=Berik|first2=Gunseli|last3=Floro|first3=Maria S|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=978-0-415-53748-3|location=New York|pages=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neoliberalism was cemented as the dominant global policy framework in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Among development institutions, gender issues have increasingly become part of economic development agendas, as the examples of the [[World Bank]] shows. Awareness by international organizations of the need to address gender issues evolved over the past decades. The World Bank, and regional development banks, donor agencies, and government ministries have provided many examples of instrumental arguments for gender equality, for instance by emphasizing the importance of women's education as a way of increasing productivity in the household and the market. Their concerns have often focused on women's contributions to economic growth rather than the importance of women's education as a means for empowering women and enhancing their capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Benería |first1=Lourdes |last2=Günseli |first2=Berik |last3=Floro |first3=Maria S. |title=Gender, Development, and Globalization: Economics As If All People Mattered |date=2016 |publisher=Routledge |edition= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The World Bank, for example, started focusing on gender in 1977 with the appointment of a first Women in Development Adviser.&lt;ref name="WB Gender"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/gender/overview |title=World Bank Gender Overview |author= |date=3 May 2013 |website=World Bank |publisher=World Bank |accessdate=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984 the bank mandated that its programs consider women's issues. In 1994 the bank issued a policy paper on Gender and Development, reflecting current thinking on the subject. This policy aims to address policy and institutional constraints that maintain disparities between the genders and thus limit the effectiveness of development programs.{{sfn|World Bank 2010}}Thirty years after the appointment of a first Women in Development Adviser, a so-called [[Gender Action Plan]] was launched to underline the importance of the topic within development strategies and to introduce the new [[gender and development#smart economics|Smart Economics]] strategy. In 2012, the [[World Development Report]] was the first report of the series examining Gender Equality and Development.&lt;ref name="WB Gender"/&gt;

=== Gender and microfinance ===
Women have been identified by some development institutions as a key to successful development, for example through financial inclusion. Microcredit is giving small loans to people in poverty without collateral. This was first started by [[Muhammad Yunus]], who formed the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.microworld.org/en/about-microworld/about-microcredit|title=Story of the microcredit|website=www.microworld.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have showed that women are more likely to repay their debt than men, and the Grameen Bank focuses on aiding women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Economics of Microfinance|last=Armendáriz|first=Beatriz|publisher=MIT Press|year=2010|isbn=9780262014106|location=Cambridge|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This financial opportunity allows women to start their own businesses for a steady income.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=H|first=Scott|date=2006|title=Book Review: Banker to the Poor: Micro-Lending and the Battle against World Poverty|url=|journal=Review of Radical Political Economics|volume=38|pages=280–283|via=SagePub}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were numerous case studies done in Tanzania about the correlation of the role of [[Microfinance in Tanzania|SACCoS]] and the economic development of the country. The research showed that the microfinance policies were not being carried out in the most efficient ways due to exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brennan|first=James R.|date=November 2006|title=BLOOD ENEMIES: EXPLOITATION AND URBAN CITIZENSHIP IN THE NATIONALIST POLITICAL THOUGHT OF TANZANIA, 1958–75|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-african-history/article/blood-enemies-exploitation-and-urban-citizenship-in-the-nationalist-political-thought-of-tanzania-195875/15088D32000B00E267CF7D8CD49E715E|journal=The Journal of African History|language=en|volume=47|issue=3|pages=389–413|doi=10.1017/S0021853706001794|issn=1469-5138}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there was evidence that reform could possibly enrich the overall economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Qin|first=Xuezhi|last2=Ndiege|first2=Benson Otieno|date=2013-04-08|title=Role of Financial Development in Economic Growth: Evidence from Savings and Credits Cooperative Societies in Tanzania|url=http://www.sciedu.ca/journal/index.php/ijfr/article/view/2660|journal=International Journal of Financial Research|language=en|volume=4|issue=2|pages=115|doi=10.5430/ijfr.v4n2p115|issn=1923-4031}}&lt;/ref&gt; One case study went a step further to claim that this financial service could provide a more equal society for women in Tanzania.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Lucy-George|date=April 22, 2014|title=The Impact of Microfinance on Female Entrepreneurs in Tanzania|url=https://publications.lakeforest.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1013&amp;context=seniortheses|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there are such cases in which women were able to lift themselves out of poverty, there are also cases in which women fell into a poverty trap as they were unable to repay their loans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2016/11/01/500093608/you-asked-we-answer-can-tiny-loans-lift-women-out-of-poverty|title=You Asked, We Answer: Can Microloans Lift Women Out Of Poverty?|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-03-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is even said that microcredit is actually an "anti-developmental" approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bateman, Chang|first=Milford, Ha-Joon|date=2012|title=Microfinance and the Illusion of Development: From Hubris to Nemesis in Thirty Years|url=http://wer.worldeconomicsassociation.org/files/WER-Vol1-No1-Article2-Bateman-and-Chang-v2.pdf|journal=World Economic Review|volume=1|pages=13–36|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is little evidence of significant development for these women within the 30 years that the microfinance has been around.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender, development, and globalization: economics as if all people mattered|last=Benería|first=Lourdes|publisher=New York ; London : Routledge, Taylor &amp; Francis Group|year=2016|isbn=9780415537483|location=|pages=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; In South Africa, unemployment is high due to the introduction of microfinance, more so than it was under apartheid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Banerjee|first=Abhijit|last2=Galiani|first2=Sebastian|last3=Levinsohn|first3=Jim|last4=McLaren|first4=Zoë|last5=Woolard|first5=Ingrid|title=Why Has Unemployment Risen in the New South Africa |work=NBER Working Paper No. 13167 |date=June 2007 |doi=10.3386/w13167}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Microcredit intensified poverty in Johannesburg, South Africa as poor communities, mostly women, who needed to repay debt were forced to work in the informal sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Jennifer|date=July 2010|title=How the global economic crisis reaches marginalised workers: the case of street traders in Johannesburg, South Africa|url=|journal=Gender and Development|volume=18|pages=277–289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there is debate on how effective microcredit is in alleviating poverty in general, there is an argument that microcredit enables women to participate and fulfill their capabilities in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lott|first=Charlotte E.|date=2009-05-01|title=Why Women Matter: the Story of Microcredit |journal=Journal of Law and Commerce|language=en|volume=27|issue=2|doi=10.5195/jlc.2009.28|issn=2164-7984}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a study conducted in Malayasia showed that their version of microcredit, AIM, had a positive effect on Muslim women's empowerment in terms of allowing them to have more control over family planning and over decisions that were made in the home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Al-Shami|first=Sayed Samer Ali|last2=Razali|first2=Muhammad M.|last3=Majid|first3=Izaidin|last4=Rozelan|first4=Ahmed|last5=Rashid|first5=Nurulizwa|date=2016-07-02|title=The effect of microfinance on women’s empowerment: Evidence from Malaysia|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1080%2F12259276.2016.1205378|journal=Asian Journal of Women's Studies|language=en|volume=22|issue=3|pages=318–337|doi=10.1080/12259276.2016.1205378|issn=1225-9276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is the Women's Development Business (WDB) in South Africa, a [[Grameen Bank]] microfinance replicator. According to WDB, the goal is to ensure “[…] that rural women are given the tools to free themselves from the chains of poverty […]” through allocation of financial resources directly to women including enterprise development programs.&lt;ref name="WDB"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://wdb.co.za/about/#.UpUPR-KmZRc |title=WDB about page |author= |year= 2013 |website=Women’s Development Business |publisher=WDB |accessdate=28 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is to use microfinance as a market-oriented tool to ensure access to financial services for disadvantaged and low-income people and therefore fostering economic development through [[financial inclusion]].

As a reaction, a current topic in the feminist literature on economic development is the ‘gendering’ of [[microfinance]], as women have increasingly become the target borrowers for rural [[microcredit]] lending. This, in turn, creates the assumption of a “rational economic woman” which can exacerbate existing social hierarchies&lt;ref name="Rankin2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rankin |first=Katharine N. |year=2001 |title= Governing Development: Neoliberalism, Microcredit, and Rational Economic Woman |url= http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/apcity/unpan011685.pdf |journal= Economy and Society |publisher=Fondation Maison des sciences de l'homme |volume=30 |pages=20 |accessdate=2 November 2013 |doi=10.1080/03085140122912}}&lt;/ref&gt;). 
Therefore, the critique is that the assumption of economic development through microfinance does not take into account all possible outcomes, especially the ones affecting women.

The impact of programs of the [[Bretton Woods Institutions]] and other similar organizations on gender are being monitored by Gender Action, a watchdog group founded in 2002 by Elaine Zuckerman who is a former World Bank economist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.genderaction.org/who.html|title=About Us: Who We Are|last=|first=|date=2012|website=Gender Action|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dennis|first=Suzanna|last2=Zuckerman|first2=Elaine|date=2008|title=Mapping Multilateral Development Banks' Spending on Reproductive Health and HIV and AIDS|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/20461274|journal=Gender and Development|volume=16|issue=2|pages=287–300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender, financial crises, and neoliberal economic policy===
The [[global financial crisis]] and the following politics of austerity have opened up a wide range of gender and feminist debates on neoliberalism and the impact of the crisis on women. One view is that the crisis has affected women disproportionately and that there is a need for alternative economic structures in which investment in social reproduction needs to be given more weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://soundcloud.com/genderconfyork/elson-and-pearson-keynote |title=Keynote of Diane Elson and Ruth Pearson at the Gender, Neoliberalism and Financial Crisis Conference at the University of York |last1=Elson |first1=Diane |last2=Pearson |first2=Ruth |date=27 September 2013 |website=Soundcloud |accessdate=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender Development and Globalization: Economics as if All People Mattered|last=Benería  Lourdes, Günseli Berik and Maria S. Floro|first=|publisher=|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) assessed the impact of the global financial crisis on workers and concluded that while the crisis initially affected industries that were dominated by male workers (such as finance, construction and manufacturing) it then spread over to sectors in which female workers are predominantly active. Examples for these sectors are the service sector or wholesale retail trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ilo.org/global/publications/magazines-and-journals/world-of-work-magazine/articles/WCMS_120081/lang--en/index.htm |title=Financial crisis: The gender dimension |last1=International Labour Organization |date=1 April 2009 |website=ILO |accessdate=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are different views among feminists on whether neoliberal economic policies have more positive or negative impacts on women. In the post-war era, feminist scholars such as Elizabeth Wilson&lt;ref name="Wilson1977"&gt;{{cite book |author=Elizabeth Wilson |title= Women and the Welfare State  |url= https://www.amazon.com/Women-Welfare-State-Routledge-1977/dp/B00DHPQZPO |publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;  criticized [[state capitalism]] and the [[welfare state]] as a tool to oppress women. Therefore, neoliberal economic policies featuring [[privatization]] and [[deregulation]], hence a reduction of the influence of the state and more individual freedom was argued to improve conditions for women. This anti-welfare state thinking arguably led to feminist support for neoliberal ideas embarking on a [[macroeconomic policy]] level deregulation and a reduced role of the state.

Therefore, some scholars in the field argue that [[feminism]], especially during its [[second-wave feminism|second wave]], has contributed key ideas to Neoliberalism that, according to these authors, creates new forms of inequality and exploitation.&lt;ref name="Fraser2012"&gt;{{cite web |last=Fraser |first=Nancy |year=2012 |title= Feminism, Capitalism, and the Cunning of History |url= http://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/72/50/55/PDF/FMSH-WP-2012-17_Fraser1.pdf |journal=Working paper |publisher=Fondation Maison des sciences de l'homme  |pages=14 |accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a reaction to the phenomenon that some forms of feminism are increasingly interwoven with capitalism, many suggestions on how to name these movements have emerged in the feminist literature. Examples are ‘free market feminism’ &lt;ref name="Eisenstein2009"&gt;{{cite book |last=Eisenstein |first=Hester |year=2009 |title= Feminism Seduced: How Global Elites Use Women’s Labor and Ideas to Exploit the World |url= http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/feminism-seduced-hester-eisenstein/1101405471?ean=9781594516597&amp;itm=1&amp;usri=9781594516597 |location=Boulder |publisher= Paradigm Publishers |isbn= 1594516596 |accessdate=25 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or even ‘faux-feminism’.&lt;ref name="McRobbie2009"&gt;{{cite book |last=McRobbie |first=Angela |year=2009 |title= The Aftermath of Feminism: Gender, Culture and Social Change |url= http://product.half.ebay.com/The-Aftermath-of-Feminism-Gender-Culture-and-Social-Change-by-Angela-McRobbie-2008-Paperback/2879527&amp;cpid=1169202753 |location=London |publisher= Sage |isbn= 0761970622 |accessdate=25 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Smart economics===
'''Theoretical approaches'''
Advocated chiefly by the [[World Bank]], smart economics is an approach to define gender equality as an integral part of economic development and it aims to spur development through investing more efficiently in women and girls. It stresses that the gap between men and women in [[human capital]], economic opportunities, and voice/agency is a chief obstacle in achieving more efficient development. As an approach, it is a direct descendant of the efficiency approach taken by WID which “rationalizes ‘investing’ in women and girls for more effective development outcomes.”&lt;ref name="Chant and Sweetman (2012)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chant|first=Sylvia|author2=Sweetman, Caroline|title=Fixing women or fixing the world? ‘Smart economics’, efficiency approaches, and gender equality in development| journal=Gender &amp; Development| date=November 2012|volume=20|issue=3|pages=517–529|doi=10.1080/13552074.2012.731812}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chant|first=S.|title=The disappearing of 'smart economics'?

Its approach identifies women are relatively underinvested source of development and it defines [[gender equality]] an opportunity of higher return investment. “Gender equality itself is here depicted as smart economics, in that it enables women to contribute their utmost skills and energies to the project of world economic development.”&lt;ref name="Chant and Sweetman (2012)"/&gt;   In this term, smart economics champions neoliberal perspective in seeing business as a vital vehicle for change and it takes a stance of [[liberal feminism]].

The thinking behind smart economics dates back, at least, to the lost decade of the [[Structural adjustment|Structural Adjustment]] Policies (SAPs) in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Chant and Sweetman (2012)"/&gt; In 1995, World Bank issued its flagship publication on gender matters of the year Enhancing Women's Participation in Economic Development (World Bank 1995). This report marked a critical foundation to the naissance of Smart Economics; in a chapter entitled ‘The Pay-offs to Investing in Women,’ the Bank proclaimed that investing in women “speeds economic development by raising productivity and promoting the more efficient use of resources; it produces significant social returns, improving child survival and reducing fertility, and it has considerable intergenerational pay-offs.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=World Bank|title=Enhancing Women’s Participation in Economic Development|year=1995|issue=Washington, DC: World Bank|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Bank also emphasized its associated social benefits generated by investing in women. For example, the Bank turned to researches of Whitehead that evidenced a greater female-control of household income is associated with better outcomes for children's welfare &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Young|first=edited by Kate|title=Of marriage and the market : women's subordination internationally and its lessons|year=1984|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|location=London|isbn=9780710202932|page=Whitehead, A.

A first step was World Bank's Gender Action Plan (GAP) 2007-/2010, followed by the “Three Year Road Map for Gender Mainstreaming 2010-13.” The 2010-13 framework responded to criticisms for its precursor and incorporated some shifts in thematic priorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=World Bank.|title=Applying Gender Action Plan Lessons: A Three-Year Road Map for Gender Mainstreaming (2011- 2013).|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTGENDER/Resources/336003-1241561860207/GAPtransitionplan_may25.pdf.|work=World Bank Report|publisher=World Bank|accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Lastly but not least, the decisive turning point was 2012 marked by its publication of “[[World Development Report]] 2012: Gender Equality and Development.”&lt;ref name="World Bank"&gt;{{cite web|last=World Bank|title=World Development Report 2012: Gender Equality and Development.|url=http://econ.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/EXTRESEARCH/EXTWDRS/EXTWDR2012/0,,contentMDK:22999750~menuPK:8154981~pagePK:64167689~piPK:64167673~theSitePK:7778063,00.html|work=World Development Report|publisher=World Bank|accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;    This Bank's first comprehensive focus on the gender issues was welcomed by various scholars and practitioners, as an indicator of its seriousness. For example, Shahra Razavi appraised the report as ‘a welcome opportunity for widening the intellectual space’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Razavi |first=S. |title=‘World Development Report 2012: Gender Equality and Development: An Opportunity Both Welcome and Missed (An Extended Commentary)’ |pages=2 |url=http://www.unrisd.org/80256B42004CCC77/(httpInfoFiles)/E90770090127BDFDC12579250058F520/$file/Extended%20Commentary%20WDR%202012.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other [[international organizations]], particular [[UN]] families, have so far endorsed the approach of smart economics. Examining the relationship between child well-being and gender equality, for example, [[UNICEF]] also referred to the “Double Dividend of Gender Equality.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=UNICEF|title=The state of the world's children 2007: women and children: the double dividend of gender equality.|year=2006|publisher=United Nations Children's Fund}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its explicit link to a wider framework of the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (where the Goal 3 is Promoting Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment) claimed a wider legitimacy beyond economic efficiency. In 2007, the Bank proclaimed that “The business case for investing in MDG 3 is strong; it is nothing more than smart economics.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=World Bank|title=Global Monitoring Report 2007: Millennium Development Goals: Confronting the Challenges of Gender Equality and Fragile States (Vol. 4).|publisher=World Bank-free PDF|pages=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In addition, “Development organisations and governments have been joined in this focus on the ‘business case’ for gender equality and the empowerment of women, by businesses and enterprises which are interested in contributing to social good.”&lt;ref name="Chant and Sweetman (2012)"/&gt;  A good example is “Girl Effect initiative” taken by Nike Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nike Harnesses ‘Girl Effect’ Again |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/11/giving/11VIDEO.html?_r=0 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=November 10, 2010 |accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Its claim for economic imperative and a broader socio-economic impact also met a strategic need of NGOs and community organizations that seeks justification for their program funding.&lt;ref name="Chant and Sweetman (2012)"/&gt;  Thus, some NGOs, for example [[Plan International]], captured this trend to further their program. The then-president of the World Bank [[Robert B. Zoellick]] was quoted by Plan International in stating “Investing in adolescent girls is precisely the catalyst poor countries need to break intergenerational poverty and to create a better distribution of income. Investing in them is not only fair, it is a smart economic move.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Plan International |title=‘Because I Am a Girl: The State of the World’s Girls 2009. Girls in the Global Economy. Adding it All Up.’ |publisher=Plan International |page=11 and 28. |url=http://www.ungei.org/resources/files/BIAAG_Summary_ENGLISH_lo_resolution.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The global financial meltdown and austerity measures taken by major donor counties further supported this approach, since [[international financial institutions]] (IFIs) s and international NGOs received a greater pressure from donors and from global public to design and implement maximally cost-effective programs.

'''Criticisms'''
From the mid-2000s, the approach of smart economics and its chief proponent –World Bank– met a wide range of criticisms and denouncements. These discontents can be broadly categorized into three major claims; Subordination of Intrinsic Value; Ignorance for the need of systemic transformation; Feminisation of responsibility; Overemphasized efficiency; and Opportunistic pragmatism.This is not exhaustive list of criticisms, but the list aims to highlight different emphasis among existing criticisms.

Smart economics’ subordination of women under the justification of development invited fierce criticisms. Chant expresses her grave concern that “Smart economics is concerned with building women’s capacities in the interests of development rather than promoting women’s rights for their own sake.”&lt;ref name="Chant and Sweetman (2012)"/&gt;  She disagrees that investment in women should be promoted by its instrumental utility: “it is imperative to ask whether the goal of female investment is primarily to promote gender equality and women’s ‘[[empowerment]]’, or to facilitate development ‘on the cheap’, and/or to promote further economic liberalization.”&lt;ref name="Chant and Sweetman (2012)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roberts 2012 949–968"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roberts|first=Adrienne|author2=Soederberg, Susanne|title=Gender Equality as Smart Economics? A critique of the 2012 World Development Report|journal=Third World Quarterly|date=June 2012|volume=33|issue=5|pages=949–968|doi=10.1080/01436597.2012.677310}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Although smart economics outlines that gender equality has intrinsic value (realizing gender equality is an end itself) and instrumental value (realizing gender equality is a means to a more efficient development),&lt;ref name="World Bank"/&gt;  many points out that the Bank pays almost exclusive attentions to the latter in defining its framework and strategy. Zuckerman also echoed this point by stating “business case [which] ignores the moral imperative of empowering women to achieve women’s human rights and full equal rights with men.”&lt;ref name="Roberts 2012 949–968"/&gt;  In short, Chant casts a doubt that if it is not “possible to promote rights through [[utilitarianism]].” &lt;ref name="Chant and Sweetman (2012)"/&gt;

A wide range of scholars and practitioners has criticized that smart economics rather endorse the current status-quo of gender inequality and keep silence for the demand of institutional reform. Its approach “[d]oes not involves public action to transform the laws, policies, and practices which constrain personal and group agency.”&lt;ref name="Chant and Sweetman (2012)"/&gt;  [[Naila Kabeer]]  also posits that “attention to collective action to enable women to challenge structural discrimination has been downplayed.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kabeer|first=Naila|title=Gender mainstreaming in poverty eradication and the Millennium development goals a handbook for policy-makers and other stakeholders|year=2003|publisher=Commonwealth secretariat |location=London|isbn=0-85092-752-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Simply, smart economics assumes that women are entirely capable of increasingly contributing for economic growth amid the ongoing structural barriers to realize their capabilities.

Sylvia Chant (2008) discredited its approach as ‘feminisation of responsibility and/or obligation’ where the smart economics intends to spur growth simply by demanding more from women in terms of time, labour, energy, and other resources.&lt;ref name="Chant and Sweetman (2012)"/&gt;  She also agrees that “Smart economics seeks to use women and girls to fix the world.”&lt;ref name="Chant and Sweetman (2012)"/&gt;  She further goes by clarifying that “It is less welcome to women who are already contributing vast amounts to both production and unpaid reproduction to be romanticised and depicted as the salvation of the world.”&lt;ref name="Chant and Sweetman (2012)"/&gt;

Chant is concerned that “An efficiency-driven focus on young women and girls as smart economics leaves this critical part of the global population out.”&lt;ref name="Chant and Sweetman (2012)"/&gt;   Smart economics assumes that all women are at their productive stage and fallaciously neglects lives of the elderly women, or women with handicaps. Thus she calls for recognition of “equal rights of all women and girls -regardless of age, or the extent of nature of their economic contribution.”&lt;ref name="Chant and Sweetman (2012)"/&gt;  Also, its approach does not talk about cooperation and collaboration between males and females thus leaving men and boys completely out of picture.

Chant emphasize that “The smart economics approach represents, at best, pragmatism in a time of economic restructuring and [[austerity]].”&lt;ref name="Chant and Sweetman (2012)"/&gt;   Smart economics can have a wider acceptance and legitimacy because now is the time when efficiency is most demanded, not because its utilitarianism has universal appeal. She further warns that feminists should be very cautious about “supporting, and working in coalition with, individuals and institutions who approach gender equality through the lens of smart economics. This may have attractions in strategic terms, enabling us to access resources for work focusing on supporting the individual agency of women and girls, but risks aggravating many of the complex problems that gender and development seeks to transform.”&lt;ref name="Chant and Sweetman (2012)"/&gt;

==Alternative Approaches==
Other approaches with different paradigms have also played a historically important role in advancing theories and practices in gender and development.

===Marxism and Neo-Marxism===
The structuralist debate was first triggered by [[Marxist]] and [[socialist feminist]]s. Marxism, particularly through alternative models of [[state socialist]] development practiced in [[China]] and [[Cuba]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huang|first=Philip C.C.|date=2012-09-17|title=Profit-Making State Firms and China’s Development Experience|url=http://journals.sagepub.com.libproxy.sdsu.edu/doi/pdf/10.1177/0097700412455839|journal=Modern China|language=en|volume=38|issue=6|pages=591–629|doi=10.1177/0097700412455839|issn=0097-7004}}&lt;/ref&gt; challenged the dominant liberal approach over time. [[Neo-Marxist]] proponents focused on the role of the [[post-colonial]] state in development in general and also on localized class struggles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pearce|first=Samir Amin. Transl. by Brian|title=Unequal development : an essay on the social formations of peripheral capitalism|year=1976|publisher=Harvester Pr.|location=Hassocks|isbn=0901759465|edition=  al-Ṭabʻah 4.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marxist feminist]]s advanced these criticisms towards liberal approaches and made significant contribution to the contemporary debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mies |first1=Maria |last2=Bennholdt-Thomsen |first2=Veronika |last3=Werlhof |first3=Claudia von |date=1988 |title=Women: the last colony |publisher=Zed Books |location=London |isbn=0862324556}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dependency theory===
Dependency theorists opposed that liberal development models, including the attempt to incorporate women into the existing global capitalism, was in fact nothing more than the "development of [[underdevelopment]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Frank|first=Andre Gunder|title=Capitalism and underdevelopment in Latin America : historical studies of Chile and Brazil|year=1969|publisher=Monthly Review P.|location=New York|isbn=0853450935|edition=  Rev. and enl.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view led them to propose that delinking from the structural oppression of [[global capitalism]] is the only way to achieve balanced human development.  
In the 1980s, there also emerged "a sustained questioning by [[post-structuralist]] critics of the development paradigm as a narrative of progress and as an achievable enterprise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=al.]|first=edited by Nalini Visvanathan ... [et|title=The women, gender and development reader|publisher=Zed Books|location=London|isbn=9781848135871|page=29|edition=  2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basic Needs Approach, Capability Approach, and Ecofeminism===
Within the liberal paradigm of women and development, various criticism have emerged. The [[Basic Needs]] (BN) approach began to pose questions to the focus on growth and income as indicators of development. It was heavily influenced by [[Amartya Sen|Sen]] and Nussabaum's [[capability approach]], which was more gender sensitive than BN and focused on expanding human freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sen|first=Amartya|title=Development as freedom|year=2001|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|location=Oxford [u.a.]|isbn=0192893300|edition=  1st publ. as an Oxford Univ. Press paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Martha|editor-last=Nussbaum|title=The quality of life a study prepared for the World Institute for Development Economics Research (WIDER) of the United Nations University|year=1995|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780198287971|edition=  Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BN particularly proposed a participatory approach to development and challenged the dominant discourse of trickle down effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=International Labour Organization|title=Employment, growth, and basic needs : a one-world problem : report of the Director-General of the International Labour Office.|year=1976|publisher=International Labour Office|location=Geneva|isbn=9789221015109}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These approaches focused on the human freedom led to development of other important concepts such as human development and [[human security]]. From a perspective of [[sustainable development]], ecofeminists articulated the direct link between [[colonialism]] and environmental degradation, which resulted in degradation of women's lives themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Merchant|first=Carolyn|title=The death of nature : women, ecology, and the scientific revolution : a feminist reappraisal of the scientific revolution|year=1980|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|location=San Francisco|isbn=0062505718|edition=  First}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2150">'''Hanna van [[Recklinghausen]]''' (1332 – after 1349), was a banker in [[Lochem]] in the [[Netherlands]]. She is the earliest woman merchant known by name in the Netherlands.

She was the daughter of the [[Jew]]ish [[Court Jew]] banker Godschalk from Recklinghausen in Germany. Her father was a money-lender to the nobility, and she is listed as his assistant and colleague from 1347. Her sister Hannah Rose and another female family member is also listed as colleagues, but they are mentioned a little later than her. In the Jewish community, women were allowed to participate in business as long as they fulfilled the religious duties, and fathers were encouraged to teach their daughters to read and count.

Hanna van Recklinghausen is last heard of in 1349. During the [[Black death]], massacres were conducted in on the Jewish population in many cities, where they were blamed for the plague accused of having poisoned the [[water well]]s. Lochem lay in the area belonging to the Duke of [[Gelderland]], [[Reginald III, Duke of Guelders]], who in 1350 took a group of Jews in custody. It is unknown if Hanna van Recklinghausen was a part of that group, and it is also unknown what happened to that group, if it was placed under the duke's protection or killed. There is no further information of her after 1349.

'''Helena of Adiabene''' ({{lang-he|הלני מלכת חדייב}}) (d. ca. 50-56 CE) was an [[Iranic|Iranian]], [[Zoroastrian]], or [[Magian]] queen of [[Adiabene]] and [[Edessa]], and the wife of [[Monobaz I]], her brother, and  [[Abgar V|Abgarus V]]. With her husband, [[Monobaz I]], she was the mother of [[Izates bar Monobaz|Izates II]] and [[Monobaz II]]. Helena became a convert to Judaism about the year 30 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Oren |editor1-first=Yitzhak |editor2-last=Zand |editor2-first=Michael |editor3-last=Prat |editor3-first=Naftali |title=[[Shorter Jewish Encyclopedia]] |date=1982 |publisher=Society for Research on Jewish Communities |location=Jerusalem |at=col. 475 |volume=2 |language=ru |chapter=Елена|chapter-url=http://eleven.co.il/jewish-history/second-temple-period/11546/|isbn=965-320-049-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The names of some of her family members and the fact that she was married to her brother&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, "Ant." xx. 2, § 1.&lt;/ref&gt; indicate an [[Iranic|Iranian]], [[Zoroastrian]] or [[Magian]] origin. According to Josephus, Helena was the daughter of King Izates,&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, War, p.298&lt;/ref&gt; and according to both Josephus and Moses of Chorene, she was the chief wife of Abgar V king of Edessa.&lt;ref&gt;Moses of Chorene, History of Armenia&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Sociology of MMT and the Conversions of King Abgarus and Queen Helena of Adiabene, Professor Robert Eisenman.&lt;/ref&gt;


==Sources of information==
What is known of Helena is based on the writings of [[Flavius Josephus]], [[Movses Khorenatsi|Moses of Chorene]], [[Kirakos of Gandzak|Kirakos Ganjakets]], and the [[Talmud]]. Josephus, although younger, was almost contemporary with Helena, living in Jerusalem at the time when she lived and was buried there, and he wrote substantial parts of his work from first-hand knowledge. The earliest parts of the Talmud, while based on older sources, were compiled and redacted from around the year 200 onward.

==Biography==

Helena of Adiabene was noted for her generosity; during a famine at [[Jerusalem]] in 45-46 CE she sent to [[Alexandria]] for corn (grain) and to [[Cyprus]] for dried [[ficus|fig]]s for distribution among the sufferers from the famine.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, l.c. § 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Talmud, however ([[Bava Batra]] 11a), this is laid to the credit of [[Monobaz I]]; and though [[Brüll]]&lt;ref&gt;"Jahrb." i. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; regards the reference to Monobaz as indicating the dynasty, still [[Rashi]] maintains the simpler explanation—that Monobaz himself is meant. The Talmud speaks also of important presents which the queen gave to the Temple at Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;Yoma 37a.&lt;/ref&gt; "Helena had a golden candlestick made over the door of the Temple," to which statement is added that when the sun rose its rays were reflected from the candlestick and everybody knew that it was the time for reading the Shema'.&lt;ref&gt;Yoma 37b; [[Tosefta]] Yoma 82&lt;/ref&gt; She also made a golden plate on which was written the passage of the [[Pentateuch]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] v.19-22&lt;/ref&gt; which the priest read when a wife suspected of infidelity was brought before him.&lt;ref&gt;Yoma l.c.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Jerusalem Talmud]], tractate Yoma iii. 8 the candlestick and the plate are confused.

The strictness with which she observed the [[halakha|Jewish law]] is instanced in the Talmud: "Her son [Izates] having gone to war, Helena made a vow that if he should return safe, she would become a [[Nazirite]] for the space of seven years. She fulfilled her vow, and at the end of seven years went to [[Judea|Judah]]. The [[Hillel the Elder|Hillel]]ites told her that she must observe her vow anew, and she therefore lived as a Nazirite for seven more years. At the end of the second seven years she became  ritually impure, and she had to repeat her Naziriteship, thus being a Nazarite for twenty-one years. [[Judah bar Ilai]], however, said she was a Nazirite for fourteen years only."&lt;ref&gt;Nazir 19b.&lt;/ref&gt; "Rabbi Judah said: 'The [[sukkah]] [erected for the [[Sukkot|Feast of Tabernacles]]] of Queen Helena in [[Lod|Lydda]] was higher than twenty [[ell]]s. The rabbis used to go in and out and make no remark about it'."&lt;ref&gt;Suk. 2b.&lt;/ref&gt; Helena moved to [[Jerusalem]], where she is buried in the pyramidal tomb which she had constructed during her lifetime, three [[stadia (length)|stadia]] north of Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;comp. [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Ecclesiastical History]]'' ii., ch. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; The catacombs are known as "[[Tombs of the Kings (Jerusalem)|Tombs of the Kings]]." A sarcophagus with the inscription ''Sara Malkatha'', in [[Hebrew]] and [[Syriac language|Syriac]], found in the nineteenth century by [[Louis Felicien de Saulcy]], is supposed to be that of Helena.&lt;ref&gt;Corpus Inscriptionum Semiticarum, ii. 156.{{Clarify|date = September 2010}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jerusalem palace of the Adiabenes==
The royal palace of Queen Helena is believed to have been discovered by archaeologist [[Doron Ben-Ami]] during excavations in the [[City of David]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Israeli archaeologists uncover 2,000-year-old mansion
06/12/2007 [http://en.rian.ru/world/20071206/91177091.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mentalfloss.com/blogs/archives/141654 Photo of palace]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Josephus, the palace was built by (the otherwise unknown) "Grapte, a kinswoman" of Izates.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, War, p 279&lt;/ref&gt; It was a monumental building located in the [[City of David]] just to the south of the [[Temple Mount]] and was destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE. The ruins contained datable coins, stone vessels and pottery as well as remnants of ancient frescoes. The basement level contained a [[mikveh]] (ritual bath).&lt;ref&gt;Second Temple palace uncovered.

Recipients of the IVG are provided with the full amount of tuition and fees to attend any approved public [[college]] or [[university]] in Illinois. In effect, Illinois veterans can pursue an academic degree for the cost of textbooks alone.

Veterans who were resident in the state of Illinois at least six months before entering military service and who have completed a full year or more of federal active duty (or have served in a designated combat zone) may be eligible for the grant. Qualified applicants may use this grant at the undergraduate or graduate level for the equivalent of four academic years of full-time enrollment. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''Institute of All Nations for Advanced Studies, Inc.''' (IAN) was established by Dr. Rama C. Mohanty and others in 1964. Mohanty, IAN’s General Secretary, is a Professor of Physics at [[Southern University]] in [[Baton Rouge]], [[Louisiana]]. He moved to found the organization after being deeply affected by the brutal murder of thousands of innocent people, including children and women, as a result of religious and communal rioting in his native [[India]].

Convinced that the promotion of [[inner peace]] within each individual is vital to the establishment of meaningful [[world peace]], IAN seeks to become:

*  A non-political, non-partisan, non-sectarian society.
*  A community of scholars and humanitarians dedicated to peace.
*  An institution devoted to the humanization, re-education of mankind and the development of [[international law]].
*  An organization of ''people'' as well as governments
*  A true parliament of humanity, serving as a forum for all men and women of goodwill everywhere.

Permanently chartered as a private, nonprofit educational 501(c)(3) tax-exempt corporation in [[New York (state)|New York]], the Institute began under the co-chairmanship of former [[Supreme Court of the United States]] Justice [[Arthur J. Goldberg|Arthur (Joseph) Goldberg]], and former [[United Nations]] Ambassador Arthur S. Lall's niece, Dr. Anurita Kapur, M.D. a neurosurgeon in New York. Since 1998, IAM has promoted '''World Peace Day''' internationally on 1 October to raise mass awareness against violence at home and abroad as well as honor those working to promote [[peace]].&lt;ref&gt;Confusingly, this decision seems to have been taken without regard to the long pre-existing [[International Day of Peace]], 21 September, and [[World Day of Peace]], i January, both sometimes unofficially known as '''World Peace Day'''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Land reform''' (also [[agrarian reform]], though that can have a broader meaning) involves the changing of laws, regulations or customs regarding land ownership.&lt;ref&gt;Batty, Fodei Joseph. "Pressures from Above, Below and Both Directions: The Politics of Land Reform in South Africa, Brazil and Zimbabwe." Western Michigan University. Presented at the Annual Meeting of the Midwest Political Science Association. Chicago, Illinois. April 7–10, 2005. p. 3. [http://www.allacademic.com//meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/0/8/6/8/8/pages86884/p86884-1.php]&lt;/ref&gt; Land reform may consist of a government-initiated or government-backed [[property redistribution]], generally of agricultural land. Land reform can, therefore, refer to transfer of ownership from the more powerful to the less powerful, such as from a relatively small number of wealthy (or noble) owners with extensive land holdings (e.g., plantations, large ranches, or [[agribusiness]] plots) to individual ownership by those who work the land.&lt;ref&gt;Borras, Saturnino M. Jr. "The Philippine Land form in Comparative Perspective: Some conceptual and Methodological Implications." ''Journal of Agrarian Change''. 6,1 (January 2006): 69–101.&lt;/ref&gt; Such transfers of ownership may be with or without compensation; compensation may vary from token amounts to the full value of the land.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Martin and J. Howell. "Redistributive Land Reform in Southern Africa." Overseas Development Institute. DFID. Natural Resources Perspectives No. 64. January 2001. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/download/2078.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Land reform may also entail the transfer of land from individual ownership—even [[peasant]] ownership in [[smallholding]]s—to government-owned collective farms; it has also, in other times and places, referred to the exact opposite: division of government-owned collective farms into smallholdings.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Martin and J. Howell. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/download/2078.pdf "Redistributive Land Reform in Southern Africa."] Overseas Development Institute. DFID. ''Natural Resources Perspectives'' No. 64. January 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The common characteristic of all land reforms, however, is modification or replacement of existing institutional arrangements governing possession and use of land. Thus, while land reform may be radical in nature, such as through large-scale transfers of land from one group to another, it can also be less dramatic, such as regulatory reforms aimed at improving land administration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ghanalap.gov.gh/index1.php?linkid=47&amp;sublinkid=94 Ghana's Land Administration Project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721030833/http://www.ghanalap.gov.gh/index1.php?linkid=47&amp;sublinkid=94 |date=2011-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, any revision or reform of a country's land laws can still be an intensely political process, as reforming land policies serves to change relationships within and between communities, as well as between communities and the state. Thus even small-scale land reforms and legal modifications may be subject to intense debate or conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Lund, Christian. ''Local Politics and the Dynamics of Property in Africa''. Cambridge University Press: New York. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Land usage and tenure ==
{{main article|Land ownership and tenure}}
{{Social democracy sidebar}}
Land ownership and tenure can be perceived as controversial in part because ideas defining what it means to access or control land, such as through "land ownership" or "land tenure", can vary considerably across regions and even within countries.&lt;ref&gt;La Croix, Sumner. [http://www.economics.hawaii.edu/research/workingpapers/WP_02-13.pdf "Land Tenure: An Introduction."] Working Paper no. 02-13. May 2002. University of Hawaii.&lt;/ref&gt; Land reforms, which change what it means to control land, therefore create tensions and conflicts between those who lose and those who gain from these redefinitions (see next section).&lt;ref name="Boone, Catherine 2007"&gt;Boone, Catherine. "Property and Constitutional Order: Land Tenure reform and the Future of the African State." ''African Affairs''. 2007. 106: 557–586.&lt;/ref&gt;

Western conceptions of land have evolved over the past several centuries to place greater emphasis on individual land ownership, formalized through documents such as land titles.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, John. ''Two Treatises of Government''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. [1689] 1991. and Smith, Adam. ''The Wealth of Nations''. Books 1—III. London: Penguin Books. 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Control over land, however, may also be perceived less in terms of individual ownership and more in terms [[land use]], or through what is known as land tenure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/y4307e/y4307e05.htm "What is land tenure?"] Food and Agriculture Organization.&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, in many parts of Africa for example, land was not owned by an individual, but rather used by an extended family or a village community. Different people in a family or community had different rights to access this land for different purposes and at different times. Such rights were often conveyed through oral history and not formally documented.&lt;ref&gt;Dekker, Henri A.L. [https://books.google.com/books?id=_9AuGJ5oXpYC&amp;dq=Dekker,+Henri+A.L.+The+Invisible+Line:&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''The Invisible Line: Land Reform, Land Tenure Security and Land Registration'']. Ashgate: Burlington, 2003. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

These different ideas of land ownership and tenure are sometimes referred to using different terminology. For example, "formal" or "statutory" land systems refer to ideas of land control more closely affiliated with individual land ownership. "Informal" or "customary" land systems refer to ideas of land control more closely affiliated with land tenure.&lt;ref&gt;"Land Law." Law and Development. The [[World Bank]]. February 23, 2007. [http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTLAWJUSTICE/0,,contentMDK:20372383~menuPK:1696138~pagePK:148956~piPK:216618~theSitePK:445634,00.html],&lt;/ref&gt;

Terms dictating control over and use of land can therefore take many forms. Some specific examples of present-day or historic forms of formal and informal land ownership include:
* Traditional land tenure, as practiced by the indigenous tribes of [[Pre-Columbian era|Pre-Columbian]] North America.
* [[Feudalism|Feudal]] land ownership, through [[fiefdom]]s
* [[Life estate]], interest in real property that ends at death.
* [[Fee tail]], hereditary, non-transferable ownership of real property.
* [[Fee simple]]. Under [[common law]], this is the most complete ownership interest one can have in [[real property]].
* [[Leasehold]] or [[renting|rental]]
* Rights to use a [[common land|common]]
* [[Sharecropping]]
* [[Easement]]s
* Agricultural labor – under which someone works the land in exchange for money, payment in kind, or some combination of the two
* Collective ownership
* Access to land through a membership in a [[cooperative]], or shares in a corporation, which owns the land (typically by fee simple or its equivalent, but possibly under other arrangements).
* Government [[collectives]], such as those that might be found in communist states, whereby government ownership of most agricultural land is combined in various ways with tenure for farming collectives.

==Motivation==
{{see also|Property redistribution}}

Land reform is a deeply political process&lt;ref&gt;: Boone, Catherine. "Property and Constitutional Order: Land Tenure reform and the Future of the African State." ''African Affairs''. 2007. 106: 557–86. and Manji, Ambreena. ''The Politics of Land Reform in Ghana: From Communal Tenure to Free Markets''. Zed Books: New York. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore many arguments for and against it have emerged. These arguments vary tremendously over time and place. For example, in the twentieth century, many land reforms emerged from a particular political ideology, such as communism or socialism. Or, as can be seen in the 19th century in colonized states, a colonial government may have changed the laws dictating land ownership to better consolidate political power or to support its colonial economy.&lt;ref&gt;Berry, Sata. "Debating the land question in Africa." Johns Hopkins University. N.d. {{cite web |url=http://www.unc.edu/~wwolford/Geography160/saraberry.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113212159/http://www.unc.edu/~wwolford/Geography160/saraberry.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In more recent times, electoral mobilization and the use of land as a patronage resource have been proposed as possible motivations for land reform efforts, such as the extensive redistributive land reforms of Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe.&lt;ref&gt;Boone, Catherine and N. Kriger. "Multiparty elections and land patronage: Zimbabwe and Cote d'Ivoire." ''Commonwealth and Comparative Politics''. 48,1 (April 2010): 173–202.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arguments for===
Land reforms need not be as dramatic in scale as Zimbabwe. Today many arguments in support of land reform focus on its potential social and economic benefits, particularly in [[developing countries]], that may emerge from reforms focused on greater land formalization. Such benefits may include eradicating food insecurity and alleviating rural poverty.&lt;ref&gt;Meinzen-Dick, Ruth, Markelova, Helen and Moore, Kelsey. "The Role of Collective Action and Property Rights in Climate Change Strategies." International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), 2010. and Economic Commission for Africa. "Land Tenure Systems and their Impacts on Food Security and Sustainable Development in Africa." 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{rquote|right|And the great owners, who must lose their land in an upheaval, the great owners with access to history, with eyes to read history and to know the great fact: when property accumulates in too few hands it is taken away. And that companion fact: when a majority of the people are hungry and cold they will take by force what they need. And the little screaming fact that sounds through all history: repression works only to strengthen and knit the repressed.| ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]'', by [[John Steinbeck]], Penguin, 2006, 0143039431, pg 238&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Arguments in support of such reforms gained particular momentum after the publication of "The Mystery of Capital" by Peruvian economist [[Hernando de Soto (economist)|Hernando de Soto]] in 2000. The poor, he argues, are often unable to secure formal property rights, such as land titles, to the land on which they live or farm because of poor governance, corruption and/or overly complex bureaucracies. Without land titles or other formal documentation of their land assets, they are less able to access formal credit. Political and legal reforms within countries, according to de Soto, will help to include the poor in formal legal and economic systems, increase the poor's ability to access credit and contribute to economic growth and poverty reduction.&lt;ref&gt;De Soto, Hernando. ''The Mystery of Capital: Why Capitalism Triumphs in the West and Fails Everywhere Else''. New York: Basic Books. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many international development organizations and bilateral and multilateral donors, such as the World Bank, have embraced de Soto's ideas, or similar ideas, about the benefits of greater formalized land rights.&lt;ref&gt;Deininger, Klaus W. ''Land Policies for Growth and Poverty Reduction''. The World Bank. 2003. [https://books.google.com/books?id=-3HWZigoZDMC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; This has translated into a number of development programs that work with governments and civil society organizations to initiate and implement land reforms.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank. "Regional Study on Land Administration, Land Markets, and Collateralized Lending." 2003. [http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTEAPREGTOPRURDEV/Resources/573691-1141228934263/2280904-1153493824735/RegionalStudyonLand+Administration.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence to support the economic and pro-poor benefits of increased formalized land rights are, however, still inconclusive according to some critics (see "Arguments against land reform" below).

Other arguments in support of land reform point to the need to alleviate conflicting land laws, particularly in former colonies, where formal and informal land systems may exist in tension with each other.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Jina. "Africa's continental divide: land disputes." ''Christian Science Monitor''. January 30, 2010. [http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Africa/2010/0130/Africa-s-continental-divide-land-disputes]&lt;/ref&gt; Such conflicts can make marginalized groups vulnerable to further exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;Kafmbe, Anthony Luyirika. "Access to Justice: Widows and the Institutions Regulating Succession to Property in Uganda." ''Human Rights Review''; Jul2006, Vol. 7 Issue 4, pp. 100–113.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in many countries in Africa with conflicting land laws, AIDS stigmatization has led to an increasing number of AIDS widows being kicked off marital land by in-laws.&lt;ref&gt;Ambasa-Shisanya, Constance. "Widowhood in the Era of HIV/AIDS: A Case Study of the Slaya District, Kenya." ''Journal of Social Aspects of HIV/AIDS''. August 2007. 2:2, 606–615.&lt;/ref&gt; While the woman may have both customary and statutory rights to the land, confusion over which set of laws has primacy, or even a lack of knowledge of relevant laws, leave many AIDS widows at a significant disadvantage. Also, conflicting formal and informal land laws can also clog a country's legal system, making it prone to corruption.&lt;ref&gt;Tettey, Wisdom, B. Gebe and K. Ansah-Koi. "The Politics of Land and Land-related Conflicts in Ghana: A Summary." Land Policy Reform Project. Institute for Statistical, Social and Economic Research at the University of Ghana. 2008. [http://www.isser.org/images/stories/landproject/Summary%20POLITICS_OF_LAND_AND_LAND-RELATED_CONFLICTS%20-%20summary.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional arguments for land reform focus on the potential [[environmental]] benefits of reform. For example, if reform leads to greater security of [[land owner]]ship, through either formal or informal means, then those that use the land will be better stewards of it.&lt;ref&gt;World Resources Institute. "The Wealth of the Poor: Managing Ecosystems to Fight Poverty." 2005. {{cite web |url=http://archive.wri.org/publication_detail.cfm?pubid=4073 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807172600/http://archive.wri.org/publication_detail.cfm?pubid=4073 |archivedate=2011-08-07 |df= }} and Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).

===Arguments against===
Many of the arguments in support of land reform speak to its potentially positive social and economic outcomes. Yet, as mentioned previously, land reform is an intensely political process.&lt;ref name="Boone, Catherine 2007" /&gt; Thus, many of those opposed to land reform are nervous as to the underlying motivations of those initiating the reform. For example, some may fear that they will be disadvantaged or victimized as a result of the reforms. Others may fear that they will lose out in the economic and political power struggles that underlie many land reforms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/16703331 "A chance to improve how Kenya is run." ''The Economist''. July 29, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other groups and individuals express concerns about land reforms focused on formalization of property rights. While the economic and social benefits of formalized land rights are often touted, some research suggests that such reforms are either ineffective or may cause further hardship or conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Bourbeau, Heather, "Property Wrongs." ''Foreign Policy''. Nov/Dec 2001. Issue 127, pp. 78–79 and Nyamu Musembi, Celestine. "De Soto and Land Relations in rural Africa: breathing life into dead theories about property rights." ''Third World Quarterly''. 2007. 28:8, 1457–1478.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional arguments against land reform focus on concerns over equity issues and potential [[elite capture]] of land, particularly in regards to reforms focused on greater land formalization. If improperly or inadequately implemented, critics worry that such reforms may further disadvantage marginalization groups such as indigenous communities or women.&lt;ref&gt;Drimie, Scott. "The Impact of HIV/AIDS on Land: Case Studies from Kenya, Lesotho and South Africa." ''Food and Agriculture Organization''. August 2002. and Varley, Ann. "Gender and Property Formalization: Conventional and Alternative Approaches." ''World Development''. October 2007. 35:10, 1739–1753.&lt;/ref&gt; These concerns also lead to questions about the institutional capacity of governments to implement land reforms as they are designed. Even if a country does have this capacity, critics worry that corruption and patrimonalism will lead to further [[elite capture]].&lt;ref&gt;''Gender in Agriculture Source Book''. The World Bank, FAO and IFAD. 2009.[https://books.google.com/books?id=XxBrq6hTs_UC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

In looking at more radical reforms, such as large-scale land redistribution, arguments against reform include concerns that redistributed land will not be used productively and that owners of expropriated land will not be compensated adequately or compensated at all. Zimbabwe, again, is a commonly cited example of the perils of such large-scale reforms, whereby land redistribution contributed to economic decline and increased food insecurity in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/1201137?story_id=1201137 "From breadbasket to basket case." ''The Economist''. June 27, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; In cases where land reform has been enacted as part of [[socialism|socialist]] [[collectivization]], many of the arguments against collectivization more generally apply.

==National efforts==
{{main|Land reforms by country}}
Nearly all newly independent countries of Eastern and Central Europe implemented land reforms in the aftermath of [[World War I]]. In most countries the land in excess of certain limit (ranging from 20 to 500 [[hectare|ha]] depending on the region and type of land) was expropriated, in [[Finland]] it was redeemed and placed into special fund.&lt;ref&gt;Gediminas Vaskela.

==Childhood and Education==

Maximilien Jazani was born in [[Teheran]] in the second half of the 1960s in an intellectual and [[agnostic]] family (see [[Bijan Jazani]]). As a child, he went to the modern method and agnostic]] primary Farhad school in Teheran and started his first "college" in [[Alborz]] when Mohammad Reza Shah's regime was reversed and the Islamic Republic of Iran started oppressing democrats, agnostics and [[secularist]]s in Iran. He had to leave Iran together with his mother and his brother and to come in France. 
In France, he went to "college" and high school (Lycée) and obtained a “baccalaureat” of French litters philosophy and mathematics.

==Human Rights Advocacy==

In 1997 Jazani became a member of the Association of the Business Lawyers (ACE).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.avocats-conseils.org/annuaire-membres.htm?prm_annuaire_cnpersonne=JAZANI{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected president of the Human Rights Commission of ACE in 1997 and 1998. He participated in the great reform of the French Criminal Procedure in 1998, was received by the Minister of Justice, Élisabeth Guigou and made 9 proposals for the reform of the French Criminal Procedure Code. He proposed to allow the Defense Lawyer to be  assisted by a Private Investigator (7th Proposal) and to have the right to request from the examining judge (Juge d'instruction") to perform acts he judges useful for the search of the truth (4th Proposal). The 4th proposal was accepted by the government and was adopted by the Legislator and became the new 1st section article 82-1 of the French Criminal Procedure Code.

'''New trade theory''' ('''NTT''') is a collection of economic models in [[international trade]] which focuses on the role of increasing [[returns to scale]] and [[network effect]]s, which were developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

New trade theorists relaxed the assumption of constant returns to scale, and some argue that using protectionist measures to build up a huge industrial base in certain industries will then allow those sectors to dominate the world market.

Less [[quantitative property|quantitative]] forms of a similar "[[infant industry]]" argument against totally free trade have been advanced by trade theorists since at least 1791 (see: [[History of free trade]]).

== The theory's impact ==
The value of [[protectionism|protecting]] "infant industries" has been defended at least since the 18th century; for example, [[Alexander Hamilton]] proposed in 1791 that this be the basis for US trade policy.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Hamilton, REPORT ON MANUFACTURES, Communicated to the House of Representatives, December 5, 1791. www.constitution.org/ah/rpt_manufactures.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; What was "new" in new trade theory was the use of [[mathematical economics]] to model the increasing [[returns to scale]], and especially the use of the [[network effect]] to argue that the formation of important industries was [[Path dependence|path dependent]] in a way which industrial planning and judicious [[tariff]]s might control.

The models developed predicted the national specialization-by-industry observed in the industrial world (movies in Hollywood, watches in [[Switzerland]], etc.). The model also showed how path-dependent industrial concentrations can sometimes lead to [[monopolistic competition]] or even situations of oligopoly.

Some economists, such as [[Ha-Joon Chang]], had argued that protectionist policies had facilitated the development of the Japanese auto industries in the 1950s, when [[Quota Share|quota]]s and regulations prevented import competition. Japanese companies were encouraged to import foreign production technology but were required to produce 90% of parts domestically within five years. Japanese consumers suffered in the short term by being unable to buy superior vehicles produced by the world market, but eventually gained by having a local industry that could out-compete their international rivals.&lt;ref name="macewan"&gt;{{cite book |last= MacEwan |first= Arthur |title= Neo-liberalism or democracy?: economic strategy, markets, and alternatives for the 21st century |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=w9CH8Aj9StkC&amp;printsec=frontcover |accessdate= 2009-04-04 |year= 1999 |publisher= Zed Books |isbn= 1-85649-725-9 |postscript= The rapid post-war industrialization in Japan is documented in this book.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Econometric testing ==
The [[econometric]] evidence for NTT was mixed, and highly technical. Due to the timescales required, and the particular nature of production in each 'monopolizable' sector, statistical judgements were hard to make. In many ways, the available data have been too limited to produce a reliable test of the [[hypothesis]], which doesn't require arbitrary judgements from the researchers.

Japan is cited as evidence of the benefits of "intelligent" protectionism, but critics{{Who|date=September 2009}} of NTT have argued that the empirical support post-war Japan offers for beneficial protectionism is unusual, and that the NTT argument is based on a selective sample of historical cases. Although many examples (like Japanese cars) can be cited where a 'protected' industry subsequently grew to world status, [[Regression analysis|regression]]s on the outcomes of such "[[Industrial policy|industrial policies]]" (which include failures) have been less conclusive; some findings suggest that sectors targeted by Japanese industrial policy had decreasing returns to scale and did not experience productivity gains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Richard |last=Beason |first2=David E. |last2=Weinstein |title=Growth, Economies of Scale, and Targeting in Japan (1955–1990) |journal=[[Review of Economics and Statistics]] |volume=78 |issue=2 |year=1996 |pages=286–295 |jstor=2109930 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the theory's development ==
The theory was initially associated with [[Paul Krugman]] in the late 1970s; Krugman claims that he heard about monopolistic competition from [[Robert Solow]]. Looking back in 1996 Krugman wrote that [[International economics]] a generation earlier had completely ignored ''returns to scale.''
"The idea that trade might reflect an overlay of increasing-returns specialization on [[comparative advantage]] was not there at all: instead, the ruling idea was that increasing returns would simply alter the pattern of comparative advantage." In 1976, however, MIT-trained economist [[Victor Norman]] had worked out the central elements of what came to be known as the Helpman–Krugman theory. He wrote it up and showed it to [[Avinash Dixit]]. However, they both agreed the results were not very significant.{{cn|date=March 2016}} Indeed, Norman never had the paper typed up, much less published. Norman's formal stake in the race comes from the final chapters of the famous Dixit–Norman book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Theory of International Trade: A Dual, General Equilibrium Approach |location= |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1980 |isbn=0-521-29969-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Brander]], a PhD student at Stanford at the time, was undertaking similarly innovative work using models from [[industrial organisation]] theory—cross-hauling—to explain two-way trade in similar products.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

=== "New" new trade theory ===
[[Marc Melitz]] and [[Pol Antràs]] started a new trend in the study of international trade. While new trade theory put emphasis on the growing trend of intermediate goods, this new trend emphasizes firm level differences in the same industry of the same country and this new trend is frequently called 'new' new trade theory (NNTT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Marc J. |last=Melitz |year=2003 |title=The Impact of Trade on Intra-Industry Reallocations and Aggregate Industry Productivity |journal=[[Econometrica]] |volume=71 |issue= |pages=1695–1725 |doi=10.2307/1555536 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Antras |first=Pol |first2=Elhanan |last2=Helpman |year=2004 |title=Global Sourcing |journal=[[Journal of Political Economy]] |volume=112 |issue= |pages=552–580 |doi= 10.1086/383099}}&lt;/ref&gt; NNTT stresses the importance of firms rather than sectors in understanding the challenges and the opportunities countries face in the age of globalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Gianmarco I. P. |last=Ottaviano  |title=‘New’ new economic geography: firm heterogeneity and agglomeration economies |journal=Journal of Economic Geography |volume=11 |year=2011 |issue=2 |pages=231–240 |doi=10.1093/jeg/lbq041 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As international trade is increasingly [[trade liberalization|liberalized]], industries of comparative advantage are expected to expand, while those of comparative disadvantage are expected to shrink, leading to an uneven spatial distribution of the corresponding economic activities. Within the very same industry, some firms are not able to cope with international competition while others thrive. The resulting intra-industry reallocations of market shares and productive resources are much more pronounced than inter-industry reallocations driven by comparative advantage.

=== Theoretical foundations ===
New trade theory and "new" new trade theory (NNTT) need their own trade theory. New trade theories are often based on assumptions such as [[monopolistic competition]] and increasing [[returns to scale]]. One of the typical explanations, given by Paul Krugman, depends on the assumption that all firms are symmetrical, meaning that they all have the same production coefficients. This is too strict as an assumption and deprived general applicability of Krugman's explanation. Shiozawa, based on much more general model, succeeded in giving a new explanation on why the traded volume increases for intermediates goods when the transport cost decreases.&lt;ref&gt;Y. Shiozawa (2007) A New Construction of Ricardian Trade Theory: A Many-country, Many-commodity with Intermediate Goods and Choice of Techniques, ''Evolutionary and Institutional Economics Review,'' '''3'''(2): 141–187.&lt;/ref&gt;

"New" new trade theory (NNTT) also needs new theoretical foundation. Melitz and his followers concentrate on empirical aspects and pay little interest on theoretical aspects of NNTT. Shiozawa's new construction, or [[David_Ricardo#Neo-Ricardians|Ricardo-Sraffa trade theory]], enables Ricardian trade theory to include [[choice of techniques]]. Thus the theory can treat a situation where there are many firms with different production processes. Based on this new theory, Fujimoto and Shiozawa&lt;ref&gt;T. Fujimoto and Y. Shiozawa, Inter and Intra Company Competition in the Age of Global Competition: A Micro and Macro Interpretation of Ricardian Trade Theory, ''Evolutionary and Institutional Economics Review,'' '''8'''(1): 1–37 (2011) and '''8'''(2): 193–231 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt; analyze how different production sites, either of competing firms or of the same firms locating in the different countries, compete.

* [http://www.pkarchive.org/theory/ohlin.html Krugman acknowledges NTT's debt to Ohlin]. He writes that [[Bertil Ohlin|Ohlin]] may have lacked the modelling technology necessary to incorporate increasing returns to scale into the [[Heckscher-Ohlin model]], but that his book ''Interregional and International Trade'', discusses the consideration qualitatively.

{{UStaxation}}
The '''OneTax''' is a [[tax reform]] plan and proposed [[Constitutional amendment|amendment]] to the United States Constitution that eliminates the [[Income tax in the United States|federal income tax]] for all individuals earning less than $215,870.&lt;ref name="refBartlett" /&gt;&lt;ref name="refCensus" /&gt; The OneTax is described as revenue-neutral, which means that it compensates for lost revenue from the income tax by closing [[loophole]]s and eliminating [[tax expenditures]] in the current income tax system.&lt;ref name="refRN" /&gt;

==Background==
The current United States [[Income tax in the United States|income tax]] system imposes higher costs of tax compliance than any other country, with direct costs exceeding $460 billion, and indirect [[deadweight loss]] costs of over $1.2 trillion.&lt;ref name="refJohnsson" /&gt; As this figure was calculated in 2004, it is likely that the actual current deadweight loss caused by the income tax is more than $1.4 trillion. As a national sales would create comparable deadweight loss, tax reform plans like OneTax aim to reduce or eliminate income tax [[compliance costs]] without instituting a national [[sales tax]].

==History==
The OneTax and plans like it were first created in the 1990s by policy [[wikt:wonk|wonks]] [[Inside the Beltway|outside the Beltway]], seeking to put forward a tax simplification plan that wasn't regressive. At the time, the major tax reform proposals were the [[FairTax]] and [[flat tax]], both of which are regressive with regards to income.&lt;ref name="refGale" /&gt; The first recorded mention of this reform by a political candidate for national office was at a "Town Hall" campaign event held in Smithfield, Rhode Island in 2002.&lt;ref name="refBristol" /&gt; In 2011, the Republican Presidential Primary race brought tax reform proposals to the fore. In addition, discussion of the plan as a way to eliminate the income tax for "the 99%" was a topic of the [[Occupy movement|Occupy Movement]].&lt;ref name="refSD" /&gt;

==Implementation==
The core piece of the reform is a proposed Constitutional Amendment which repeals the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], but carves out taxes on income to remain in place for two specifically defined ways:

1. The United States federal government may tax income on those individuals earning more than ten times the [[per capita]] [[income]] as determined by the most recent [[census]].

2. The United States federal government may continue to collect a [[payroll tax]] on all workers, the proceeds of which are earmarked for exclusive transfer to, or provision of health care benefits for, those persons aged 65 or older.&lt;ref name="refBartlett" /&gt;

==Effects==
The primary effect is the elimination of the present personal income tax system and the elimination of 97.6% of all personal income tax compliance costs,&lt;ref name="refBartlett" /&gt; and the elimination of more than 96% of the current [[deadweight loss]].&lt;ref name="refJohnsson" /&gt; These two items are predicted to create an immediate boost of more than $2.1 trillion to the lagging U.S. economy.

==Controversy==
It is not in dispute that the OneTax will lead to higher effective tax rates for higher-income individuals (or it will lead to significantly lower federal spending).{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} Many opponents of such tax changes argue that the country's highest income earners are the economy's "job creators".&lt;ref name="refCSM" /&gt; These opponents claim that taxing wealthy individuals at a higher rates will discourage job creation.

Others argue that the current low rate of tax on [[capital gains]] encourages investment and is necessary for the long-term stability and growth of the United States and world economy. Meanwhile, still others, such as [[Warren Buffett]] claim that higher [[tax rates]] on the rich do not discourage investment and growth.&lt;ref name="refBuffett" /&gt;

==Revenue neutrality and effective tax rate==
The conservative [[Media Research Center]] argues that the OneTax cannot be revenue neutral without raising the top marginal income tax rate above 39.6%.&lt;ref name="MRC About"&gt;{{cite web
 |title       = About the Media Research Center

}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Media Research Center|MRC]], total income tax collected (not including [[payroll tax]]) in 2009 was $867 billion. The total taxable income for those making $200,000 or greater was $1.663 trillion.  Therefore, to remain revenue neutral, shifting the income tax to those earning more than $200,000 would require an effective rate of 52%.  The total taxable income for those making $200,000 or less is $3.46 trillion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/histab3.xls | title=IRS Tax Statistics | accessdate=November 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cnsnews.com/news/article/100-percent-tax-those-earning-500k-or-more-leaves-us-839b-deficit | title=100 Percent Tax on Those Earning $500K or More Leaves U.S. With $839B Deficit | accessdate=November 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This criticism by the [[Media Research Center|MRC]] does not address the argument that $1.1 trillion in additional annual revenue could be generated by closing loopholes and eliminating tax expenditures.&lt;ref name="CSM"&gt;{{cite web
 |date=2011-10-11

 |publisher=MRC |accessdate=2012-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eliminating just 19% of these tax expenditures would raise the same revenue without raising the top marginal tax rate, and eliminating income taxes on all earnings below $200,000.&lt;ref name="JB"&gt;{{cite web

 |url=http://jaredbernsteinblog.com/tpc-feldstein-and-tax-reform/
 |publisher=Jared Bernstein |accessdate=2012-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Additionally, fewer than 30% of Americans realize that the payroll tax generates almost as much federal revenue as the income tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=American's Knowledge Of Federal Tax Statistics | author = Kaiser Kennedy School|date=May 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, all earnings above $106,000 are exempt from the payroll tax, meaning that the majority of federal taxes collected on the middle class are collected through a [[regressive tax]]. Eliminating this exemption raises the highest effective marginal tax rate (combining both income taxes and payroll taxes) to about 48%. This is similar to the effective tax rate currently paid by small business owners with incomes below $150,000. This change, combined with the elimination of other exemptions, it is argued, allows the OneTax to remain revenue neutral despite eliminating income tax filing for more than 98% of American households.

'''ProtectMarriage.com''' is a collection of conservative and religious [[United States|American]] political activist groups aligned in opposition to [[same-sex marriage]].&lt;ref name="CBS"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/06/03/national/main4147991.shtml |title=Gay Marriage Ban Makes California Ballot: Initiative Follows Court's Recent Ruling Legalizing Same-Sex Marriages |publisher=CBS News |date=June 3, 2008 |agency=Associated Press |location=San Francisco |accessdate=March 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reuters2011&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/28/gaymarriage-california-idUSN1E75Q1ZH20110628 |title=Update: Gay marriage foes appeal ruling on gay U.S. judge |work=Reuters |date=June 27, 2011 |accessdate=October 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coalition's stated goal is to "defend and restore the definition of marriage as between a man and a woman."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://protectmarriage.com/about |title=About Us |publisher=ProtectMarriage.com |accessdate=March 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 2001 as '''Proposition 22 Legal Defense and Education Fund''' holding the [[domain name]] protectmarriage.com, the organization reformed in 2005 as a coalition to sponsor California [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]], called the California Marriage Protection Act,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ag.ca.gov/cms_pdfs/initiatives/i737_07-0068_Initiative.pdf Re: Request for Title and Summary of Proposed Initiative], Office of the California Attorney General, October 1, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and was successful in placing it on the ballot in 2008. Proposition 8 amended the [[California Constitution]], putting a halt to same-sex marriages in California for nearly two years until the proposition was overturned as unconstitutional. While it was in effect, ProtectMarriage.com defended the amendment in a series of legal challenges. Ron Prentice is the executive director.&lt;ref name="CBS"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:YesOnProp8YardSign.png|thumb|right|150px|The coalition widely distributed these yard signs during their pro-[[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Prop 8]] California campaign in 2008.]]
In 2001, an organization was formed to defend the previous year's [[California Proposition 22 (2000)|California Proposition 22]] against legal challenges, to maintain Prop 22's definition of marriage in California as being between a man and a woman. The group, Proposition 22 Legal Defense and Education Fund, formed as a [[501(c)|501(c)(3)]] nonprofit, and established a website at protectmarriage.com in September 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://protectmarriage.com/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020923092303/http://protectmarriage.com/ |archivedate=2002-09-23 |title=Proposition 22 Legal Defense and Education Fund|publisher=Proposition 22 Legal Defense and Education Fund |accessdate=February 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=2002AnnualReport&gt;{{cite web |url=http://protectmarriage.com/annualreport.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040102211305/http://protectmarriage.com/annualreport.pdf |archivedate=2004-01-02 |title=Annual Report to Supporters: 2001–2002 |publisher=Proposition 22 Legal Defense and Education Fund |accessdate=February 28, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; With [[California State Senate|California State Senator]] [[William J. Knight|William J. "Pete" Knight]] serving as chairman of the board, the group reported "just over $266,000 of revenue" in its first year.&lt;ref name=2002AnnualReport/&gt; Andrew Pugno held the role of chief counsel—he had been associated with Knight's marriage definition legislation since 1995. Pugno helped Knight form the nonprofit.&lt;ref name=ChristianExaminer2005&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christianexaminer.com/Articles/Articles%20May05/Art_May05_16.html |title=New coalition pushes for constitutional amendment to protect marriage |publisher=Christian Examiner | date=May 2005 |accessdate=February 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knight died in May 2004. In March 2005, a San Francisco Superior Court judge ruled Prop 22 unconstitutional, and in April, AB 205 was passed by the California legislature; a law which extended many marriage benefits to domestic partners of any sex. These challenges to the one-man-one-woman definition of marriage spurred a change in strategy: rather than defend Prop 22, the advocates associated with the Proposition 22 Legal Defense and Education Fund would re-organize under a new name to pass new legislation. Ron Prentice, executive director of the [[California Family Council]], teamed with former Prop 22 defenders, including Pugno, to establish a coalition of like-minded groups such as [[Alliance Defense Fund]].&lt;ref name=ChristianExaminer2005/&gt; The name ProtectMarriage.com was first presented online mid-2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.protectmarriage.com/home/default.aspx |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050911175420/http://www.protectmarriage.com/home/default.aspx |archivedate=2005-09-11 |title=Welcome to ProtectMarriage.com |publisher=ProtectMarriage.com |accessdate=February 28, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
Ron Prentice, the executive director of ProtectMarriage.com, is a licensed marriage and family therapist. In addition to his duties at the organization, he served as Chief Executive Officer of the California Family Council until December 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.californiafamilycouncil.org/CommonSenseWithoutCompromise Common Sense Without Compromise | California Family Council] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229193251/http://www.californiafamilycouncil.org/CommonSenseWithoutCompromise |date=December 29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.californiafamilycouncil.org/about-us About CFC | California Family Council] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229013642/http://www.californiafamilycouncil.org/about-us |date=December 29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrew Pugno is lead counsel at ProtectMarriage.com. He coauthored Proposition 8, and continues its legal defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Thursday Oct 28 2010 |url=http://folsomtelegraph.com/detail/163486.html |title=Pugno, Pan battle for 5th Assembly District – Folsom Telegraph |publisher=Folsomtelegraph.com |date=2010-10-28 |accessdate=2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pugno began his efforts against same-sex marriage in 1995 with then-assemblyman Pete Knight. He served as chief counsel in the defense of Proposition 22.&lt;ref name="LAT"/&gt;

In July 2008, ProtectMarriage.com hired Jennifer Kerns as communications director. Kerns, a [[public relations]] consultant, was previously the communications director for [[Steve Poizner]]'s successful 2006 bid for the position of [[California Insurance Commissioner]]. She also served as assistant to [[California Secretary of State]] [[Bruce McPherson]], analyzing election practices and results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.protectmarriage.com/home/default.aspx |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080711213704/http://www.protectmarriage.com/ |archivedate=2008-07-11 |title=Welcome to ProtectMarriage.com |publisher=ProtectMarriage.com |accessdate=February 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ProtectMarriage.com comprises three programs: Proposition 8 Legal Defense Fund, the ProtectMarriage.com Educational Foundation and ProtectMarriage.com Action Fund.&lt;ref&gt;[http://protectmarriage.com/about/our-programs Protect Marriage – Yes on 8 » Our Programs] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715123651/http://protectmarriage.com/about/our-programs |date=July 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relations with other organizations==
Members of the coalition include: the [[Family Research Council]], [[Focus on the Family]], and the [[California Family Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Coalition seeks male-female marriage definition / New ballot push for constitutional amendment|first=John M. |last=Hubbell|work=San Francisco Chronicle|date=April 28, 2005|page=B.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Catholics for ProtectMarriage.com was formed to support the Proposition 8 campaign. The organization was a collaboration between the [[Knights of Columbus]], the [[California Catholic Conference]] and [[Catholics for the Common Good]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/catholic_effort_launched_to_support_california_proposition_defending_marriage/ Catholic effort launched to support California proposition defending marriage :: Catholic News Agency (CNA)].

The court case would have been the first federal trial to be captured live by video cameras, shown in real time at public courthouses in [[San Francisco]], [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], [[Seattle]], [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], and [[Brooklyn]], through an experimental new system developed by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit Appeals Court]].&lt;ref name="sfgateyoutube"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/01/06/BA121BEGI8.DTL&amp;tsp=1 | title=Prop. 8 trial will be shown on YouTube | publisher=''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' | author=Egelko, Bob | date=2010-01-06 | accessdate=2010-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/19/us/19cameras.html | title=Rule Invites Cameras Into Federal Civil Cases | publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' | author=Schwartz, John | date=2009-12-18 | accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial would also have been shown on the video-sharing website [[YouTube]].&lt;ref name="sfgateyoutube"/&gt; Federal judge [[Vaughn R.

Nathan Sabri, an attorney with [[Morrison &amp; Foerster]], the law firm handling the case ''[[pro bono]]'' for Courage Campaign, responded by writing that the request had no merit, and that his client had noted the irony of the ProtectMarriage.com position—that the image of two children flanked by a man and a woman was said by ProtectMarriage.com to be "substantially indistinguishable" from the two children flanked by two women.&lt;ref name=McMillan2010/&gt; On January 19, ProtectMarriage.com filed a lawsuit asking for a temporary restraining order to stop the use of the similar logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cafezine.com/depts/article.aspx?id=24006&amp;deptid=4 |title=Morrison &amp; Foerster Secures Victory for Courage Campaign |publisher=IPFrontline.com |date=January 22, 2010 |accessdate=February 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rfcexpress.com/lawsuits/trademark-lawsuits/california-eastern-district-court/53476/protectmarriage-com-yes-on-8-v-courage-campaign/summary/ |title=ProtectMarriage.com – Yes on 8 v.

[[United States district court]] Judge [[Vaughn R. Walker]] overturned Proposition 8 on August 4, 2010, in the case ''[[Perry v.

The phrase, which was initially derided by some comedians&lt;ref name=humoristas&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1993/06/13/pagina-23/33771101/pdf.html?search=puedo%20prometer%20y%20prometo |title= La paz pujoliana (y II) |accessdate=July 15, 2012 |last= Morán |first=Gregorio |publisher=[[La Vanguardia]] |date= 18 March 1995 |language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt; soon became a definitive accolade for choosing Suarez and is remembered as one of the symbols of the [[Spanish Transition]]&lt;ref name=abcdecisivo&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1978/08/10/034.html |title=La antivíspera electoral y su cumplimiento |accessdate=July 15, 2012 |publisher=[[ABC (Spain)|ABC]] |date=10 August 1978 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lavanguardiadecisivo&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1993/06/13/pagina-15/33716410/pdf.html?search=puedo%20prometer%20y%20prometo |title=Temor a que González repita los errores que cometió Suárez en 1979 |accessdate=July 15, 2012  |publisher=[[La Vanguardia]] |date=13 June 1993 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; subsequently being used in popular parlance for both political and journalistic purposes.

==Background==
[[Caudillo]] [[Francisco Franco]] died on November 20, 1975. Two days later, [[Juan Carlos I]] was proclaimed [[King of Spain]] at the [[Palacio de las Cortes]] palace in accordance with the provisions of the [[Spanish law of succession referendum, 1947]]. The first government under King Juan Carlos I kingdom was headed by [[Carlos Arias Navarro]] and failed in the attempt to transform Spain into a [[democracy]], getting overwhelmed by the many demonstrations against it. So, in July 1976, Adolfo Suárez was appointed Prime Minister by the King. Despite not having initially public support, Suárez managed to unite all democratic forces to develop a process of reform that allowed turning the [[Francoist regime]] into a Western democracy.&lt;ref name=historia&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historiasiglo20.org/HE/16a-1.htm |title=La transición política. La Constitución de 1978 y el Estado de las Autonomías. |accessdate=July 15, 2012 |publisher=historiasiglo20.org |language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt; With that on mind it was enacted the [[Political Reform Act of 1977]] the last of the [[Fundamental Laws of the Realm]] which had gone ahead through concessions made by the Government of Suárez and support of [[Torcuato Fernández Miranda]] as president of the Cortes, and was finally approved on the [[Spanish political reform referendum, 1976]], the project received the approval of 94.1% of voters.&lt;ref name=historia /&gt;

The Government, in agreement with the provisions of Royal Decree-Law 20/1977 of March 18 called for elections by universal suffrage for a new [[Bicameralism|bicameral Parliament]], to be held on June 15, 1977. In turn, they ensured that these elections were fully democratic and counted with the presence of the left through measures such as the legalization of the [[Communist Party of Spain]], the dissolution of the [[Movimiento Nacional]] or extension of the [[Spanish 1977 Amnesty Law|amnesty]].&lt;ref name=historia /&gt;&lt;ref name=suarezonega&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1993/06/13/pagina-21/59457398/pdf.html?search=puedo%20prometer%20y%20prometo |title=La emoción de estrenar libertad |accessdate=July 15, 2012  |last=Ónega |first=Fernando |date=June 15, 2007 |publisher=[[La Vanguardia]] |language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Speech==
The phrase, designed by [[Fernando Ónega]],&lt;ref name=onega&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/2009/02/08/pagina-10/33971200/pdf.html?search=puedo%20prometer%20y%20prometo%20%C3%B3nega |title= El 15-J lo ganó Curro Jiménez |accessdate=July 15, 2012  |publisher=[[La Vanguardia]] |date=June 16, 2002 |language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt; was part of the discourse of Adolfo Suárez, as candidate of the [[Union of the Democratic Centre (Spain)|Union of the Democratic Centre]], which was part of the free spaces that electoral political parties arranged to go to citizens in the closing of the election campaign, June 13, 1977. This speech, broadcast by [[RTVE]] and recorded by director [[Gustavo Pérez Puig]], was the one that closed the election messages and was introduced by a tune whose lyrics said: "Vote center, vote Suárez, vote freedom. The sure path to democracy". Adolfo Suárez subsequently appeared on screen, uttering his discourse, with a first part relating to the promises fulfilled

{{quote|I modestly believe that in this new moment for Spain and asking for your vote I'm not bringing my papers empty, nor am I a mystery. We promised to return sovereignty to the Spanish people, and tomorrow they exert it. We promised to normalize our political life, manage the transition peacefully, build democracy from the law, and we believe that, with the logical deficiencies, we've succeeded. We promised that all political families may have a place in Parliament, and they can do it on Wednesday.}}

Once Suárez had referred to the promises he had kept he used the formula "I can promise, and I promise..." to give strength to his speech

{{quote|But if you give us your vote,
&lt;br&gt;
I can promise and I do promise that our government acts will constitute a staggered set of rational and objective steps for progressively solving our problems.
&lt;br&gt;
I can promise and  I do promise to try to develop a constitution in collaboration with all groups represented in Parliament, whatever their number of seats.
&lt;br&gt;
I can promise and I do promise, because after the elections all the tools will exist, to devote all efforts to achieve social understanding to set new basic guidelines to be followed by the Spanish economy in the following years.
&lt;br&gt;
I can promise and I do promise that the men of the Union of the Democratic Centre will promote fiscal reform to ensure, once and for all, that pay more who have more.
&lt;br&gt;
I can promise and I do promise a legal framework to institutionalize each region on its own merits.
&lt;br&gt;
I can promise and I do promise that we will work with honesty, with cleanliness and in a way that you can control the actions of government.
&lt;br&gt;
I can, finally, promise and I do promise that the goal of a Spain for everybody won't be jeopardized by the ambitions of some and the privileges of the few.}}

==Legacy==
[[Image:Union de Centro Democratico (logo).svg|thumb|200px|Logo of [[Union of the Democratic Centre (Spain)|Union of the Democratic Centre]].]]
The inclusion of the "I can promise and I do promise" formula in the final speech of the election campaign has been considered ''a posteriori'' as a key factor in the victory of the Union of the Democratic Centre, since a victory of the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] was also considered possible.&lt;ref name=abcdecisivo /&gt;&lt;ref name=lavanguardiadecisivo /&gt; Suárez managed to identify UCD with himself (hence the use of the first person in the phrase) providing strength to a party which later (with Suárez's resignation in 1981) proved to be very unstable.

The '''Republican Labour Party''' (RLP) was a political party in [[Northern Ireland]]. It was founded in 1964, with two MPs at [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|Stormont]], [[Harry Diamond (politician)|Harry Diamond]] and [[Gerry Fitt]].&lt;ref&gt;David Boothroyd, ''Politico's guide to the history of British political parties'', p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; They had previously been the sole Northern Ireland representatives of the [[Socialist Republican Party (Ireland)|Socialist Republican Party]] and the [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Irish Labour Party]] respectively, so a common joke was that "two one-man parties had become one two-man party".{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Fitt won the [[Belfast West (UK Parliament constituency)|West Belfast]] seat in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1966|UK general election of 1966]], and held it in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1970|1970 election]].

In August 1970, Fitt founded the [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]], and he and Senator [[Paddy Wilson]] were expelled from the RLP by a vote of 52 to 1.&lt;ref&gt;Michael A. Murphy, ''Gerry Fitt: A Political Chameleon'', p.162&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Paddy Kennedy (politician)|Paddy Kennedy]] was elected as the new party leader. He formally withdrew from Parliament in 1971, and adopted a more strongly [[Irish republican]] stance, agreeing to attend a conference organised by [[William Whitelaw]] only if he could bring [[Irish Republican Army]] members as part of his delegation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eamonn McCann]], "[https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/may/04/guardianobituaries1 Obituary: Paddy Kennedy]", ''[[The Guardian]]'', 4 May 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

The party was wiped out in both the [[Northern Ireland Assembly election, 1973|1973 elections]] to the [[Northern Ireland Assembly, 1973|Northern Ireland Assembly]] and the [[Northern Ireland local elections, 1973|1973 local elections]] and as a result was disbanded.

The '''Right Livelihood Award''' is an international award to "honour and support those offering practical and exemplary answers to the most urgent challenges facing us today."&lt;ref name="MFA"/&gt; The prize was established in 1980 by [[Germans|German]]-Swedish [[philanthropist]] [[Jakob von Uexkull]], and is presented annually in early December.&lt;ref&gt;Jawetz, Pincas.

It does not have any organizational ties to the awarding institutions of the Nobel Prize or the Nobel Foundation.

However, the Right Livelihood Award is sometimes popularly associated with the Nobel prizes; the Right Livelihood Award committee arranged for awards to be made in the [[Riksdag building|Riksdag of Sweden]] the day before the Nobel prizes and the economics prize are also awarded in [[Stockholm]], and the awards are understood as a critique of the traditional Nobel prizes.&lt;ref name="FAZ"/&gt; The establishment of the award followed a failed attempt to have the Nobel Foundation create new prizes in the areas of environmental protection, sustainable development and human rights. The prize has been awarded to a diverse group of people and organisations, including [[Wangari Maathai]], [[Astrid Lindgren]], [[Bianca Jagger]], [[Mordechai Vanunu]], [[Leopold Kohr]], [[Arna Mer-Khamis]], [[Felicia Langer]], [[Petra Kelly]], [[Survival International]], [[Amy Goodman]], [[Memorial (society)|Memorial]], and [[Edward Snowden]].

==Ceremony==
Since 1985, the ceremony has taken place in [[Stockholm]]'s old Parliament building, in the days before the traditional Nobel prizes are awarded in the same city. A group of Swedish Parliamentarians from different parties host the ceremony; in 2009 European Commissioner [[Margot Wallström]] co-hosted the ceremony. However, in 2014 when it became public that one of the recipients of the 2014 prize was [[whistleblower]] [[Edward Snowden]], the ceremonial group was disinvited from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs building in Stockholm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Edward Snowden inte välkommen till UD|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article19588815.ab|accessdate=24 September 2014|work=Aftonbladet|publisher=Aftonbladet|date=24 September 2014|ref=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature of the award==
Some media refer to the prize as the ''Alternative Nobel Prize'',&lt;ref name=Thorpe&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thorpe|first1=Edgar|last2=Thorpe|first2=Showick|title=Guide to the Combined Defence Services Exam|publisher=Pearson Education|location=New Delhi|isbn=81-317-0074-7|page=26|chapter=General Awareness: Right Livelihood Award}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the prize is frequently understood as a critique of the traditional Nobel prizes.&lt;ref name="FAZ"/&gt;

The prize differs significantly from the [[Nobel Prize]]s:
*it is not a fulfillment of [[Alfred Nobel]]'s bequest and thus not one of Nobel's own prizes;
*it has an open nomination process (anyone can nominate anyone else, except close relatives or their own organizations);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rightlivelihood.org/propose_a_candidate.html Right Livelihood Award: Proposals &amp; Selection Process]. Accessed January 24, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
*it is not limited to specific categories;&lt;ref name=about/&gt;
*the prize money is considerably lower than that of the Nobel Prize. Currently it is €200,000 compared to about €1,000,000 for a Nobel Prize;
*the funds for the prizes now come from donations&lt;ref name="MFA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.government.se/sb/d/17191/a/225032 |title=The 2013 Right Livelihood Laureates announced |author=Ministry for Foreign Affairs |format= |pages= |date=26 September 2013 |accessdate=2014-08-14 |quote= |publisher=Government Offices of Sweden |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303235727/http://www.government.se/sb/d/17191/a/225032 |archivedate=3 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Nobel Prizes come from the revenue of Alfred Nobel's fortune. The [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] (which is technically not a Nobel Prize) is financed by the [[Sveriges Riksbank]].

==History==
[[File:Rightlivelihoodaward.jpg|thumb|right|150 px|The 1994 award given to [[Hanumappa Sudarshan|Dr. Sudarshan]] photographed in [[BR Hills]]]]
Jakob von&amp;nbsp;Uexküll, the philatelist, sold his company to create a prize,&lt;ref name="MFA"/&gt; realizing one million US&amp;nbsp;dollars which provided the initial funding of the award. Before establishing the award in 1980, von&amp;nbsp;Uexkull had tried to interest the [[Nobel Foundation]] in new prizes to be awarded together with the Nobel Prizes. He suggested the establishment of two new prizes, one for ecology and one for development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rightlivelihood.org/history.html |title=Right Livelihood Award: History - Setting up the 'Alternative Nobel Prize' |publisher=Rightlivelihood.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829121254/http://www.rightlivelihood.org/history.html |archivedate=2012-08-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the [[Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel|Nobel Economics Prize]], this would have been possible with an amendment to the Nobel Foundation statutes and funding of the prize amount completely separate from Nobel's fortune. The Nobel Prize amount was 880,000 Swedish kronor at that time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/about/amounts.html |title=The Nobel Prize Amounts |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; which corresponded to 195,000 US&amp;nbsp;dollars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://currate.com/historical-exchange-rates.php according to historical exchange rate from]&lt;/ref&gt; However, as a result of the debate that followed the establishment of the [[Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel]] (first awarded in 1969), the Nobel Foundation had decided not to associate the Nobel Prize with any additional awards, so von&amp;nbsp;Uexküll's proposal was rejected.&lt;ref name="ttdn"&gt;TT-DN (2003-10-02). ''Alternativt Nobelpris delas på fem''. Dagens Nyheter, "Publicerat 2003-10-02 10:08". Retrieved from http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?a=188389. {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1980, the foundation has presented, as of 2013, awards to 153 Laureates from 64 countries.&lt;ref name="MFA"/&gt; Its self-described purpose is to bestow prizes and thus publicize the work of recipients' local solutions to worldwide problems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rightlivelihood.org/history.html Right Livelihood Award history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620110022/http://rightlivelihood.org/history.html |date=2010-06-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ryan Kelly Chamberlain II''' is an American media and political consultant, who worked on the campaign of [[Gavin Newsom]] in his run for mayor of San Francisco. He was the subject of a nationwide FBI search beginning May 31, 2014, after evidence of explosives were reportedly found in his San Francisco apartment, and after he had allegedly posted a suicide note on [[Facebook]]. Details of the reasons for the manhunt were not immediately released by investigators. Chamberlain was arrested by the FBI in the evening on Monday June 2, 2014 within the San Francisco city limits.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/06/01/fbi-man-hunt-explosives-ryan-kelly-chamberlain/9845131/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/US/explosives-suspect-ryan-chamberlain-custody-fbi/story?id=23968189]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.sfgate.com/stew/2014/06/02/fbi-suspect-ryan-chamberlain-arrested-in-s-f/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfbg.com/politics/2014/06/02/wanted-pr-consultant-ryan-chamberlain-burned-sf-politics]&lt;/ref&gt; He was charged with possessing an illegal explosive device.

Unlike the similarly named [[Shan Nationalities League for Democracy]] (SNLD), the party prefers the ''status quo'' of 7 states and 7 regions, rather than the SNLD's preference for a [[federalism|federal system]] with 8 states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Myint|first1=Sithu Aung|title=Sai Ai Pao, Chairman of the Shan Nationalities Democratic Party|url=http://www.frontiermyanmar.net/en/sai-aik-pao-chairman-the-shan-nationalities-democratic-party|website=Frontier Myanmar|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The party was formally registered in April 2010. The party's headquarters are in [[South Okkalapa Township]], [[Yangon]], and its chairman is [[Sai Ai Pao]]. In the [[Myanmar general election, 2010|2010 general election]], the party contested seats in [[Shan State]], [[Kachin State]] and the [[Mandalay Region]]. After the 2010 general election, the two SNDP representatives in the [[Shan State Hluttaw]], Sai Ai Pao and Sai Naw Kham, were appointed ethnic affairs ministers of Shan State.

In December 2011, the party's head office moved to [[Taunggyi]], the capital of Shan State.

==History==

===20th century===
{{See also|Sri Lankan riots of 1958|Burning of Jaffna library|Black July}}
Sri Lanka gained independence from Britain in 1948 as the [[Dominion of Ceylon]], although the British Royal Navy retained a base there until 1956. In 1972, the country became a republic, adopting the name [[Sri Lanka]]. Since this time, the country has experienced two major conflicts &amp;ndash; a [[civil war]] and a Marxist uprising.

====Marxist insurrection====
{{See also|1987-89 JVP Insurrection (Sri Lanka)|Sooriyakanda mass grave}}
From 1985 to 1989, Sri Lanka responded to violent insurrection with equal violence against the Sinhalese majority as part of the [[counter insurgency]] measures against the uprising by the [[Marxist]] [[Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna]] (JVP) party.&lt;ref&gt;Gananath Obeyesekere, ''Narratives of the self: Chevalier Peter Dillon's Fijian cannibal adventures'', in Barbara Creed, Jeanette Hoorn, ''Body Taade: captivity, cannibalism and colonialism in the Pacific'', Routledge, 2001, p. 100. {{ISBN|0-415-93884-8}}. "The 'time of dread' was roughly 1985-89, when ethnic Sinhala youth took over vast areas of the country and practiced enormous atrocities; they were only eliminated by equally dreadful state terrorism." [[Gananath Obeyesekere]]&lt;/ref&gt; In order to subdue those supporting the JVP uprising, a wide range of acts of cruelty were recorded as having been carried out by the state, including the torture and mass murder of school children.&lt;ref name=IshA/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndpsl.org/political_analysis/JVP-LessonsfortheLeft,2003.DOC |title=JVP: Lessons for the Genuine Left |accessdate=2008-01-17 |work=Imayavaramban |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013154029/http://www.ndpsl.org/political_analysis/JVP-LessonsfortheLeft,2003.DOC |archivedate=2007-10-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This repression peaked among the Sinhala population during 1989&amp;ndash;90.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Handelman  | first =         Don  | title = The Manchester School: Practice and Ethnographic Praxis in Anthropology  | publisher = Berghahn Books  | location =   | year = 2006  | url =   | doi =  | id = |page = 142 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Civil war====
The [[Sri Lankan Civil War]] lasted from 1983 to 2009. In 1986 an American Tamil social anthropologist at [[Harvard University]] stated that acts of "terrorism" had been committed by all sides during the war,&lt;ref&gt;Tambiah, ''Sri Lanka: Ethnic Fratricide and the Dismantling of Democracy'',  p 116. [[Stanley Jeyaraja Tambiah]]&lt;/ref&gt; but although all parties in the conflict had resorted to the use of these tactics, in terms of scale, duration, and sheer numbers of victims, the Sri Lankan state was particularly culpable.&lt;ref name=H/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Danieli, Yael, Brom, D and Sills, Joe. ''The trauma of terrorism: sharing knowledge and shared care'', p 216&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bmj.com/cgi/reprint/324/7348/1268.pdf|title= Child soldiers: Understanding the context |accessdate=2008-01-17 |work= Daya Somasundaram}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was echoed by the Secretary of the [[Movement for Development and Democratic Rights]], a [[Non-governmental organisation]] (NGO), which further claimed that the Sri Lankan state viewed killing as an essential political tool.&lt;ref name=SLDCPS&gt;ACHR, ''Sri Lanka: Disappearances and the Collapse of the Police System'',ACHR, pp 34&amp;ndash;42&lt;/ref&gt;  This had originally prompted the demand for a separate state for minority Tamils called [[Tamil Eelam]] in the north of the country,&lt;ref name=H&gt;Hattotuwa, ''From violence to peace: Terrorism and Human Rights in Sri Lanka'', pp 11&amp;ndash;13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KumR&gt;[[Kumar Rupesinghe]], ''  Ethnic Conflict in South Asia: The Case of Sri Lanka and the Indian Peace-Keeping Force (IPKF)'', pp.337&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last =  | first =  | title = Sri Lanka: testimony to state terror

Assaults on Tamils for ethnic reasons have been alleged,&lt;ref name=IshA&gt;Ishtiaq Ahmed, ''State, Nation, and Ethnicity in Contemporary South Asia'', Continuum International Publishing Group, 1996, p. 55. {{ISBN|1-85567-578-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the experience of state terrorism by the people of [[Jaffna]] has been alleged to have been instrumental in persuading the [[United National Party]] to increase their hostilities there.&lt;ref name=Wiswa&gt;W.

[[Chandrika Kumaratunga]] was the President of Sri Lanka from 1994 to 2005. In an interview with the British television presenter and news critic [[David Frost]], she has stated that at the time that her husband [[Vijaya Kumaranatunga]] was assassinated, "Sri Lanka had a [[killing field]]s, there was a lot of terror perpetrated by the government itself, state terrorism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/breakfast_with_frost/1624615.stm

===21st century===
Following the collapse of peace talks in 2006, human rights agencies such as the [[Asian Center of Human Rights]] (ACHR),  the [[University Teachers for Human Rights]] (UTHR), and  pro-[[LTTE]] political parties such as the [[Tamil National Alliance]], claimed that the government of Sri Lanka had unleashed state terrorism as part of its counter insurgency measures against the rebel LTTE movement.&lt;ref name=ACHR1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.achrweb.org/Review/2006/141-06.htm |title= Sri Lanka: Terror Vs State Terror |accessdate=2007-08-11 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UTHR1&gt;[http://www.uthr.org/bulletins/bul40.htm#_Toc138040843 University Teachers for Human Rights ] , ''[[UTHR]]'', October 28, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RW&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/RWB.NSF/db900SID/EKOI-6PQ85Q?OpenDocument |title= Claims of state terror and genocide by LTTE attempts at justifying terrorism |accessdate=2007-08-11 |format= |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sri Lankan government responded by claiming that these allegations by the LTTE were an attempt by the LTTE to justify their own acts of terrorism.&lt;ref name=SLG&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.priu.gov.lk/news_update/Current_Affairs/ca200605/20060511claims_terror_genocide_by_ltte.htm |title=Claims of state terror and genocide by LTTE attempts at justifying terrorism |accessdate=2007-08-11 |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814100222/http://www.priu.gov.lk/news_update/Current_Affairs/ca200605/20060511claims_terror_genocide_by_ltte.htm |archivedate=2007-08-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACHR has also stated that following the collapse of the Geneva talks of February 2006, the government of Sri Lanka perpetrated a campaign of state terrorism by targeting alleged LTTE sympathizers and Tamil civilians.&lt;ref name="Sri Lanka: Terror Vs State Terror"&gt;{{cite news |title=Sri Lanka: Terror Vs State Terror |url=http://www.achrweb.org/Review/2006/141-06.htm |work=ACHR Weekly Review |publisher=[[Asian Human Rights Commission]] |date=2006-11-15 |accessdate=2007-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesman for [[Human Rights Watch]] was of the opinion that: "The Sri Lankan government has apparently given its security forces a green light to use [[dirty war]] tactics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://hrw.org/english/docs/2007/08/03/slanka16573.htm|title=Sri Lanka: Government Abuses Intensify |accessdate=2008-01-18 |work= Human Rights Watch}} Quotation by Brad Adams, Asia Director.&lt;/ref&gt; International intervention in Sri Lanka was requested by Tamil sources to protect civilians from state terror.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/sinhala/news/story/2007/10/071003_mano_jvp.shtml

==Specific allegations==

===Murder ===
When referring to the [[2006 Trincomalee massacre]], of 20-year-old &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanrights.asia/news/forwarded-news/FS-018-2006|title=SRI LANKA: 'Murder of five Tamil youths highlights need to end impunity' -- Govt must protect witnesses to Trinco killings -- HRW — Asian Human Rights Commission|author=|date=|website=Asian Human Rights Commission|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; students, and subsequent intimidation of witnesses and the perceived lack of investigative vigor, the local human rights group UTHR termed it an act of state terror.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= 2.0 State Terror in Trincomalee| date=2007-07-06 | publisher= UTHR | url  =http://www.uthr.org/bulletins/bul40.htm#_Toc138040843|work =| accessdate = 2008-01-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inaction/aid to Tamil Peoples Liberation Tigers' Recruitment of children===
According to the [[Asian Centre for Human Rights]] (ACHR), the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court identifies "conscripting or enlisting children under the age of fifteen years into armed forces or groups or using them to participate actively in hostilities" as a [[war crime]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}  The agency has accused the [[Tamil Makkal Viduthalai Pulikal]] (TMVP), a LTTE breakaway group and government-backed paramilitary group, of  [[Military use of children in Sri Lanka#TMVP recruitment|recruiting children]], describing it as "state terror" and has appealed to the international community to refer Sri Lanka to the [[International Criminal Court]] for investigation into the violations of the Rome Statute.&lt;ref name="Sri Lanka: Terror Vs State Terror" /&gt;

Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch has said, "''The government is fully aware of the abductions but allows them to happen because it's eager for an ally against the Tamil Tigers''". The Human Rights Watch further added that it would be impossible to transport abducted children without the complicity of the Sri Lankan Army.&lt;ref&gt;[ Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch said, "The government is fully aware of the abductions but allows them to happen because it's eager for an ally against the Tamil Tigers". The Human Rights Watch further added that it would be impossible to transport abducted children without the complicity of the Sri Lankan Army].&lt;/ref&gt; TMVP has allegedly been used as a paramilitary force by the Sri Lankan army, from the time the group split from the LTTE in 2004.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} 

===Torture and rape===
The International Federation of Tamils, a pro-LTTE consortium of Tamil groups,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

''The Trauma of Terrorism'', p 216.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hillary Clinton]] has been quoted linking Sri Lanka with the use of rape as a tactic of war, to which some have responded unjust to "rope in" Sri Lanka's name to countries like the Congo and Burma.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asiantribune.com/news/2009/10/10/mutual-bailing-out-game-over-hilary-clinton%E2%80%99s-rape-story-sri-lanka&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interference with news media===
Opposition leader [[Ranil Wickremesinghe]] has charged the government of Sri Lanka with turning the country into a [[Military dictatorship|junta]]: "This junta has control over the economy, business activities and defense. They have unleashed corruption and terror on the country."  He has claimed that an attack on [[the Sunday Leader]] newspaper, an independent English weekly, could not have occurred without the knowledge of  the Sri Lankan Defense Ministry since the offices were located in a High Security Zone, neighboring a military air force base, a defense academy and a military camp .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.lankaenews.com/English/news.php?id=4941&amp;PHPSESSID=c724f4710cc8d593362f235e23c89fa9|title= No one can attack on the Leader Publications press without the knowledge of the Defence Ministry." -Opposition Leader|accessdate= 2008-01-17|work= Lanka News|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080124004401/http://www.lankaenews.com/English/news.php?id=4941&amp;PHPSESSID=3c9b49e26337bc99b4a67d73bff82cc6|archivedate= 2008-01-24|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lankaenews.com/English/news.php?id=6642 Gota is behind this draconian gazette] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220232831/http://www.lankaenews.com/English/news.php?id=6642 |date=February 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[UTHR]], a local human rights organization, has claimed that the media has been repressed by state terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uthr.org/SpecialReports/spreport26.htm |title= Can the East be won through Human Culling?|accessdate=2008-03-16 |work= [[UTHR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some activists have drawn attention to the lack of coverage of the displacement of Tamils in late 2008, particularly people being relocated to welfare villages in India, covered by [[Media of India|Indian news]], as a symptom of anti-democratic controls over the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The '''Term Securities Lending Facility''' (TSLF) is a 28-day facility managed by the [[United States]] [[Federal Reserve]] that offers Treasury general collateral (GC) (i.e., Treasury bills, notes, bonds and inflation-indexed securities) to the [[primary dealer]]s in exchange for other program-eligible collateral. It is intended to promote liquidity in the financing markets for Treasury and other collateral and thus to foster the functioning of financial markets more generally.

This is different from the [[System Open Market Account]] (SOMA) Securities Lending program which offers specific Treasury securities held by SOMA for loan against Treasury GC on an overnight basis. Dealers bid competitively in a multiple-price auction held every day at noon. The TSLF offers Treasury GC held by SOMA for a 28-day term. Dealers bid competitively in single-price auctions held weekly and borrowers will pledge program-eligible collateral.

==History==

TSLF was announced on 11 March 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20080311a.htm&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the program it loaned out U.S. Treasury securities worth $2.3 trillion to just eighteen Wall Street banks.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Linus, Wu, Yan and Prejean, Stephanie, March 21, 2012, "Are the Bailouts of Wall Street Complements or Substitutes?", SSRN Working Paper, Accessed online on April 25, 2012, at http://ssrn.com/abstract=2026988.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, as liquidity in the global markets came to a halt, the FED took action to allow the TSLF to expand the types of acceptable collateral: student loans, car loans, home equity loans and credit card debt, as long as it was highly rated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/03/business/03fed.html | work=The New York Times | first=Steven R. | last=Weisman | title=Fed Moves to Loosen Tight Credit | date=3 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, many of the establishment rating firms were themselves shown to be of little worth in the preceding few years, and the ratings system was in the state of being [[Subprime mortgage crisis#Role of credit rating agencies|reworked]].

The collateral for the Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF) also has been expanded; eligible collateral will now include all investment-grade debt securities.  Previously, only Treasury securities, agency securities, and AAA-rated mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities could be pledged.&lt;ref name="Federal Reserve Bank of New York"&gt;{{cite web|title=Term Securities Lending Facility: Programs Terms and Conditions - Federal Reserve Bank of New York|url=http://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/tslf_terms.html|accessdate=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was one of many [[emergency lending]] programs of the [[Federal Reserve]] during the [[Financial crisis of 2008-2009]].

The '''Third Tunnel of Aggression''' ([[Korean language|Korean]]: 제3땅굴) ('''Third Infiltration Tunnel''' or '''3rd Tunnel''') is one of four known tunnels under the border between [[North Korea]] and [[South Korea]], extending south of [[Panmunjom]].

==Background==
[[File:Korea_DMZ.svg|thumb|left|Aggression tunnels on the Koreas border]]
Only {{convert|44|km|mi|abbr=in}} from [[Seoul]], the incomplete tunnel was discovered in October 1978 following the detection of an underground explosion in June 1978, apparently caused by the tunnellers who had progressed {{convert|435|m|ft|abbr=off}} under the south side of the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]] (DMZ). It took four months to locate the tunnel precisely and dig an intercept tunnel.&lt;ref name=JSR-79-11/&gt;&lt;ref name=kois-197810/&gt;

The incomplete tunnel is {{convert|1635|m|mi|1|abbr=off}} long, of {{convert|1.95|m|ftin|abbr=on}} maximum high and {{convert|2.1|m|ftin|abbr=on}} wide.&lt;ref name=kois-197810&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www.imjinscout.com/images/North_Korean_Tunnels.pdf |title=Secret Tunnel Under Panmunjom |publisher=[[Korean Overseas Information Service]] |date=October 1978 |accessdate=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It runs through bedrock at a depth of about {{convert|73|m|ft|abbr=on}} below ground.&lt;ref name=kois-197810/&gt; It was apparently designed for a surprise attack on Seoul from North Korea, and could, according to visitor information in the tunnel, accommodate 30,000 men per hour along with light weaponry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Moore|first=Malcolm|title= Inside North Korea's Third Tunnel of Aggression|url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/malcolmmoore/9902611/Inside_North_Koreas_Third_Tunnel_of_Aggression/|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=May 26, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090713205208/http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/malcolmmoore/9902611/Inside_North_Koreas_Third_Tunnel_of_Aggression/| archivedate=13 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon discovery of the third tunnel, the [[United Nations Command (Korea)|United Nations Command]] accused North Korea of threatening the [[Korean Armistice Agreement|1953 Korean Armistice Agreement]] signed at the end of the [[Korean War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zartman|first=I.

Initially, North Korea denied building the tunnel.&lt;ref name=ssd&gt;{{cite book|last=Strauss|first=Steven D.|title=The complete idiot's guide to world conflicts|year=2002|publisher=Alpha Books|isbn=978-0-02-864366-3|pages=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; North Korea then declared it part of a [[coal mine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Armstrong|first=David|title=SEOUL lives life on the edge / Just 35 miles from the border with North Korea, the city crackles with a newfound sense of style|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2007-06-03/travel/17250808_1_north-korea-dmz-south-korea|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=June 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; the tunnel having been blackened by construction explosions.&lt;ref name=kois-197810/&gt; Signs in the tunnel claim that there is no geological likelihood of coal being in the area.

Visitors enter either by walking down a long steep incline that starts in a lobby with a gift shop or via a [[Rubber-tyred trams|rubber-tyred train]] that contains a driver at the front or the back (depending on the direction as there is only one set of rails) and padded seats facing forward and backwards in rows for up to three passengers each.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.joins.com/article/22050458|title=If you spend 10,000 won, you can trip security tourism|last=|first=|date=2017-10-26|work=중앙일보|access-date=2018-05-11|language=ko-KR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Photography is forbidden within the tunnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.jtbc.joins.com/article/article.aspx?news_id=NB11627212|title=Foreigners who found DMZ|last=|first=|date=2018-04-30|website=JTBC News|language=ko|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The South Koreans have blocked the actual [[Military Demarcation Line]] in the tunnel with three concrete barricades.

'''Tort reform''' refers to proposed changes in the [[civil justice]] system that aim to reduce the ability of victims to bring [[tort]] litigation or to reduce damages they can receive.

Tort actions are civil common law claims first created in the English commonwealth system as a non-legislative means for compensating wrongs and harm done by one party to another person, property or other protected interests (e.g. physical injury or reputation, under [[libel]] and [[slander]] laws).  Tort reform advocates focus on [[personal injury]] common law rules in particular.

In the United States, tort reform is a contentious political issue. US tort reform advocates propose, among other things, procedural limits on the ability to file claims, and capping the awards of damages.  Supporters of the existing tort system, including consumer advocates, argue that reformers have misstated the existence of any real factual issue and criticize tort reform as disguised [[corporate welfare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizen.org/congress/article_redirect.cfm?ID=5671 |title=Public Citizen Debunks myths propounded by Tort Reformers |publisher=Citizen.org |date=2010-12-03 |accessdate=2012-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.org/cps/rde/xchg/justice/hs.xsl/2011.htm American Association for Justice report on Tort Reform] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806143626/http://www.justice.org/cps/rde/xchg/justice/hs.xsl/2011.htm |date=2011-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries as well as U.S. states including Texas, Georgia, and California, the losing party must pay court costs of the opposing party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americancourthouse.com/?s=loser+pays |title=Blog reports on Texas adoption of Loser Pay Law |publisher=Americancourthouse.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{non sequitur|date=May 2018}}

Some legal scholars propose to replace tort compensation with a [[social security]] framework that serves victims without respect to cause or fault. In 1972, [[New Zealand]] introduced the first universal [[no-fault insurance]] scheme for all accident victims, which provides benefit from the government-run [[Accident Compensation Corporation]] without respect to [[negligence]]. Its goal is to achieve equality of compensation, while reducing costs of litigation. In the 1970s, [[Australia]]&lt;ref&gt;For a speech by High Court judge Michael Kirby, see [https://web.archive.org/web/20090620195211/http://www.hcourt.gov.au/speeches/kirbyj/kirbyj_med11sep.htm ''Medical malpractice - an international perspective of tort system reforms''] (11.9.2000)&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United Kingdom]] drew up proposals for similar no-fault schemes&lt;ref&gt;in the UK, see the ''[[Pearson Report]]'' (1978) by the "Royal Commission on Civil Liability and Compensation for Injury"&lt;/ref&gt; but they were later abandoned.

==The tort system==
Tort requires those responsible (or "at fault") for harming others to compensate the victims, usually in money.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, a supermarket may not have been safe enough for its customers to shop in by failing to mop up a spillage of [[yogurt]] on the floor. ''[[Ward v Tesco Stores Ltd]]'' [1976] 1 All ER 219, where the ''[[res ipsa loquitur]]'' doctrine was applied where someone slipped on yogurt in a supermarket. An employer may have failed to properly fence off some dangerous machinery, which exposes workers to risk of injury. ''Summers v Frost'' [1955] 1 All ER 870, on the application of the Factories Act 1961, s.14, saying "every dangerous part of any machinery... shall be securely fenced." A manufacturer of [[ginger beer]] may have allowed a bottle it sells to have become contaminated, which has made a consumer ill. See ''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]'' [1932] AC 580, where a decomposed snail was found in a soft drink, see Lord Atkin's judgment in particular.&lt;/ref&gt; Typical harms can include loss of income (while the person recovers); medical expenses; payment for pain, suffering, or even loss of a body part; or loss of future income (assuming that said loss can be proven to be reasonably likely to occur.  See [[speculative damages]]).&lt;ref&gt;A [[Copy typist|typist]] who loses an arm suffers a loss to his future job prospects and in the case of fatal accidents, financially dependent relatives may be compensated for the loss of money that their loved one would have provided. Known as "bereavement damages" under the [[Fatal Accidents Act 1976]] in the United Kingdom.&lt;/ref&gt;

The classical purpose of tort is to provide ''full compensation'' for proved harm. This is known under the Latin phrase ''[[restitutio in integrum]]'' (restoration to original state). In other words, the idea underpinning the law of tort is that if someone harms someone else, they should make up for it. Compensation should be, in the words of Lord Blackburn in ''Livingstone v Rawyards Coal Co'',

&lt;blockquote&gt;"that sum of money which will put the party who has been injured in the same position as he would have been if he had not sustained the wrong for which he is now getting his compensation or reparation."&lt;ref&gt;''Livingstone v Rawyards Coal Co'' (1880) 5 App Cas 25,39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Themes of the tort reform debates==
A number of recurrent issues can be identified in the debates about tort reform.

===Economic effects===
{{See also|Insurance|Medical malpractice|Product liability}}

The primary criticism of the tort system is economic. Critics decry the cost of compensation payments themselves, especially when they are out of proportion to the damage. Even if it is held that extreme compensation is a worthy goal — litigation is arguably an inefficient method of giving compensation. In Britain, for instance, it has been argued that 85p is spent on litigation for every £1 of compensation paid. In contrast, the social security system costs 8p or 12p for every £1 delivered. This figure is disputed, because there is no easy method for accounting for transaction costs particularly when pre-litigation settlements are considered.&lt;ref&gt;Cane (2006) 466;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d03836.pdf |title=GAO Study, Medical Malpractice, Implications of Raising Premiums on Access to Medical Care, 2003 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three particular charges are levelled at the tort system, for having distorting economic effects. First, the costs of litigation and compensation payouts raise the cost of insurance.  Because most tort claims will be paid from the pockets of insurance, and because the public generally pays into insurance schemes of all kinds, tort reform proponents assert that reducing tort litigation and payouts will benefit everyone who pays for insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/images/medical_liability/Understanding_Tort_Reform_Proposals.pdf| title=Understanding the Real Life Issues Underlying Tort Reform Proposals| format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondly, and related to insurance in countries which do not have [[universal health care]] (i.e., [[national health insurance]]), the costs of the tort system, and in particular medical malpractice suits, raise the costs of health care.  The difficulty in this area is to distinguish between public and private health care providers. In the UK, the cost was £1.6B a year as for 2014, increasing at 10%+ yearly &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Medical negligence costs ‘threat’ to National Health Service| url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/f4da10f6-a255-11e4-9630-00144feab7de.html#axzz3nubJU2Dk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rising from £446m a year a decade earlier. The UK, however, has exceptionally low claims, as tort claims have been restricted, for instance in disallowing [[loss of chance]] cases. The [[Medical Defence Union]] actively combats, and attempts to settle all cases where potential negligence claims are at stake. While successful, the costs of litigation to the health system are steadily growing,.&lt;ref&gt;see ''Heil v Rankin'' [2000] 3 All ER 138 on the increase of damages&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see, Sir Liam Donaldson, ''Making Amends'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, it is easier for victims of medical malpractice to seek compensation through the tort system. The American medical record in hospitals is poor, with around 195,000 deaths due to negligence per year, which itself leads to a higher number of claims.&lt;ref&gt;see '[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/11856.php ''In Hospital Deaths from Medical Errors at 195,000 per Year USA]', ''Medical News Today'' (9.8.2004); by comparison, see A. Towse and P. Danson, [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10342723 ''Medical Negligence and the NHS''] (1999) 8 Health Economics 93&lt;/ref&gt; It is open to debate as to whether a change in the law of tort either way would lead to significant reductions in cost or changes in practice. According to ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]'', "Study after study shows that costs associated with malpractice lawsuits make up 1% to 2% of the nation's $2.5 trillion annual health-care bill and that tort reform would barely make a dent in the total."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Catherine Arnst |title=The Truth About Malpractice Lawsuits| publisher=''[[Business Week]]'' |date=2009-09-16|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/09_39/b4148030880703.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Third, there is an argument that tort liability could stunt innovation. This argument usually comes in connection with [[product liability]], which in every developed country is [[strict liability]], subject to a "state of science" defence. If a product is faulty, and injures somebody who has come across it (whether they are the buyer or not) then the manufacturer will be responsible for compensating the victim regardless of whether it can be shown that the manufacturer was at fault. The standard is lower in other injury cases, so that a victim would have to prove that a tortfeasor had been [[Negligence|negligent]]. It can be argued that strict liability deters innovation, because manufacturers could be reluctant to test out new products for fear that they could be subjecting themselves to massive tort claims.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Porter]], ''The Competitive Advantage of Nations'', p. 649, {{ISBN|0-684-84147-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This argument is characteristic of the [[law and economics]] movement. It may be somewhat confused about the relevant law because it misses the state of science defence. This defence means that a manufacturer can always say "there was no warning or evidence in the scientific literature that this new product could be dangerous."{{Cite quote|date=March 2017}}

===Equality in treatment===
{{See also|Distributive justice|Equality of outcome}}
Equality of treatment is the central issue for reforms in New Zealand and in the Commonwealth more generally. If someone has an accident then they have a statistical 8% chance of finding a tortfeasor responsible for their injury. If they are lucky enough to have been injured by someone else's fault, then they can get full compensation (if the tortfeaser is not [[judgment proof]]). For others—for those injured by natural accidents, by themselves, by disease or by environmental factors; no compensation is available, and the most that can be gained for their losses will be meager state benefits for incapacity.

This was the basis for much of Professor [[Patrick Atiyah]]'s scholarship as articulated in ''Accidents, Compensation and the Law'' (1970). Originally his proposal was the gradual abolition of tort actions, and its replacement with schemes like those for industrial injuries to cover for all illness, disability and disease, whether caused by people or nature. Such a system was developed in New Zealand following recommendations from the Royal Commission in 1967 for 'no fault' compensation scheme (see The Woodhouse Report). Over the 1980s Atiyah's views shifted. He still argued that the tort system should be scrapped. But instead of relying on the state, he argued people should have to take out compulsory first party insurance, like that available for cars, and this model should be spread progressively.&lt;ref&gt;P.S. Atiyah (1997) ''The Damages Lottery'', Ch.8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limits on noneconomic damages===
{{Main|Non-economic damages caps}}
Other tort reform proposals, some of which have been enacted in various states, include placing limits on noneconomic damages and collecting lawsuit claim data from malpractice insurance companies and courts in order to assess any connection between [[malpractice]] settlements and premium rates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncsl.org/standcomm/sclaw/medmaloverview.htm Medical Malpractice Tort Reform] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090520215243/http://www.ncsl.org/standcomm/sclaw/medmaloverview.htm |date=2009-05-20 }}, National Conference of State Legislatures, May 1, 2006, accessed Aug. 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tort Caps ===
In the 20th century, tort reform really began to get some serious attention and consideration. The reform solution to keeping frivolous lawsuits from misusing the system was putting caps on damages. A cap is a price ceiling, even if the jury awards the plaintiff the amount they think is acceptable, if it is over the state or federal cap, the price is brought down to meet the price cap, sometimes with dramatic difference. These caps can only be placed on non-economic damages, these price caps are determined state by state. Meanwhile, the federal government has put a $250,000 cap on non-economic damages for medical malpractice claims. These price caps can help insure no one can get too much compensation money with a superficial case, although this cap is held on all tort cases and the serious cases get no special treatment when it comes to the law placed on caps per state.

=== Faults to Damage and Compensation Caps ===
In tort and personal injury cases, the plaintiff can receive compensation in economic, non-economic, and punitive damages. Tort reform in part aims to place caps on  punitive and non-economic damages to prevent frivolous cases from taking advantage of the system, thereby benefiting those who pay for insurance, as it is argued that excessive litigation encourages insurers to pass the impact of legal expenses on to the insured by raising average premiums. However, there are a notable instances where these caps have disadvantaged plaintiffs by preventing them from acquiring compensation adequate to what their case deserves.

Each case is of different significance and some cases may be worthy of compensation well above the state cap. For example, in the 2003 medical malpractice case GOURLEY GOURLEY v. OB GYN, the state cap on medical malpractice in Nebraska cut their compensation by 80 percent. The parents of Colin Gourley brought their sons case to court the get medical and emotional compensation for their family, when Colin was a baby in the womb, Lisa, his mother, went to the doctors because she felt him kicking less and the doctor, who they Gourleys later found out that she had been sued twice before their incident, didn’t follow the proper procedure she should have, and if she had their son wouldn’t have cerebral palsy. After taking this case to court, the jury awarded the family 5.6 million dollars, but because of this state cap, they only received 1.2 million. And if 5.6 million sounds excessive, let it be known that the projected medical costs for Colins medical expenses are 12 million. Not only does this case provide an example of how tort reform can be harmful but the other problem with this is that it takes away the peoples right to a jury in some ways, seeing as how their decision was rejected because of the state cap. The Gourleys came to the judge and argued how it was unconstitutional to place a cap when it’s the jury who gets to decide, and the judge agreed, but after taking the case to Supreme Court, it was found constitutional.

===Reduction in the statute of limitations of action===
A different reform is ''not'' to limit the amount of legitimate recovery, but to reduce the time to sue—the [[statute of limitations]] of actions.  [[New York (state)|New York]] law now requires that:
{{quote|An  action  for medical, dental or podiatric malpractice must be commenced within two   years and six months of the act, omission or failure  complained of or last treatment where there is continuous treatment for the same illness, injury  or  condition  which  gave  rise  to  the  said act, omission or failure; provided, however, that where the  action  is  based  upon  the discovery of a foreign object in the body of the patient, the action may be commenced  within  one  year of the date of such discovery or of the date of discovery of facts which would reasonably lead to such discovery, whichever is earlier....|[[New York Civil Practice Law and Rules|N.Y.

===Punitive awards and juries===
{{See also|Punitive damages|Jury}}
[[File:Trial by Jury - Chaos in the Courtroom.png|thumb|right|A [[trial by jury]] is unusual in almost all countries for non-criminal cases]]
Another head of damages that can be awarded is called "punitive damages", or sometimes "exemplary damages". The word "punitive" means [[punishment]] and the word "exemplary" implies that damages should "make an example" of the wrongdoer. The purpose of such damages are twofold:  to deter wrongful conduct by other actors, and to serve a normative function of expressing social shock or outrage at the defendant's actions.

In most jurisdictions, punitive damages are not available. They are considered contrary to public policy, because the civil justice system in many countries does not have the same procedural protections as the comparable criminal justice system.  Therefore, allowing punitive damages would have the effect of punishing actors for wrongful conduct without allowing them the ordinary procedural protections that are present in a criminal trial.  The fear is that punitive damages encourage a vindictive, revenge seeking state of mind in the claimant and society more generally. In the UK, ''[[Rookes v Barnard]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Rookes v Barnard]]'' [1964] AC 1129, [1964] 1 All ER 367&lt;/ref&gt; limited the situations in which punitive damages can be won in tort actions to where they are expressly authorised by a statute, where a defendant's action is calculated to make profit, or where an official of the state has acted arbitrarily, oppressively or unconstitutionally. In the United States, though rarely awarded in tort cases, punitive damages are available, and are sometimes quite staggering when awarded. For example, in 1999, a Los Angeles County jury awarded $4.8 billion in punitive damages against General Motors to a group of six burn victims whose 1979 Chevrolet Malibu was rear-ended by a drunk driver, causing it to catch fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Peter Y. Hong |title=Judge Cuts Award Against GM to $1.2 Billion | publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' |date=1999-08-27|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/aug/27/local/me-4217}} $4.8 billion was the largest non-class action judgment for punitive damages according to one study. ''See'' Joni Hersch and W. Kip Viscusi, "Punitive Damages: How Judges and Juries Perform," 33 J. Legal Stud. 1 (January 2004), [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=315349 available on SSRN.]&lt;/ref&gt; That was later reduced to $1.2 billion by the judge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Eric Malnic |title=GM Files Appeal of $1.2-Billion Verdict, Calling Trial Unfair| publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' |date=2000-12-07|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/dec/07/local/me-62370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is argued by some{{who|date=January 2013}} that extraordinary damage awards in the United States are a result of the jury system. In federal courts in the United States, the right to a jury trial in most civil cases is [[entrenchment clause|entrenched]] in the [[Seventh Amendment of the United States Constitution]]. Many state constitutions have similar clauses to protect the right to a jury trial in state court proceedings. In many countries, particularly in continental Europe, juries are not used at all even in criminal cases  due to the cost of protracted trials necessitated with a jury present and confidence in judicial impartiality. In the United Kingdom, juries are available in criminal cases and for tort cases involving [[defamation]], [[false imprisonment]] and [[malicious prosecution]]. Even in these limited areas of tort there have been growing concerns about the juries' role. In particular, the disparity between awards in defamation cases (which invariably concern celebrities, politicians and the rich) and awards for personal injuries has been growing. Inevitably, the awards rose in a way that a fixed system of damages under judicial scrutiny does not allow. Juries are unseasoned with a daily exposure to tragic accidents in tort litigation. When confronted with their first case they may be shocked and outraged, which inspires a willingness to teach the wrongdoer by a big damages award that "tort does not pay".&lt;ref&gt;the words of Lord Devlin in ''[[Rookes v Barnard]]'' [1964] AC 1129&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards for pain and suffering===
Tort compensation easily applies to property damage, where the replacement value is a market price (plus interest), but it is difficult to quantify the injuries to a person's body and mind.  There is no market for severed legs or sanity of mind, and so there is no price which a court can readily apply in compensation for the wrong. Some courts have developed scales of damages awards, benchmarks for compensation, which relate to the severity of the injury. For instance, in the United Kingdom, the loss of a thumb is compensated at £18,000, for an arm £72,000, for two arms £150,000, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;see, ''Guidelines for the Assessment of General Damages in Personal Injury Cases'' (2006), which lay out the standard figures, up to £200,000 for severe brain damages&lt;/ref&gt;

Even more difficult to reckon are damages for the [[pain and suffering]] of an injury. But while a scale may be consistent, the award itself is arbitrary. [[Patrick Atiyah]] has written that one could halve, or double, or triple all the awards and it would still make just as much sense as it does now.&lt;ref&gt;see generally, Patrick Atiyah and Peter Cane, ''Atiyah's Accidents, Compensation and the Law'' (2006) 6th Ed., Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Another likely factor driving up punitive damages are [[quota litis]] agreements between lawyers and clients, in which a share of the awarded punitive damage is awarded to the lawyer recovering it, giving the trial lawyer a direct economic incentive in high damages. Such a quota would usually amount to 25% to 30%. Such agreements, while lawful in the US, are considered unethical in the European Union.

===Class action lawsuits in the United States===
[[mass tort|Mass actions]] are lawsuits where a group of claimants band together to bring similar claims all at once. [[Class action]]s are lawsuits where counsel for one or more claimants bring claims on behalf of similarly situated claimants. These do not exist in most countries, and what will usually happen is that one case will be funded as a "test case", and if judgment falls in the claimants' favour the tortfeasor will settle remaining claims.  Class actions are justified on the basis that they ensure equal treatment of similarly situated victims, avoid the risk of conflicting judgments on similar issues, and allow an efficient resolution of a large number of claims. In the US, class actions have been used (and by some views abused) in order to overcome the differences applicable in different jurisdictions, including the perceived predispositions of judges, juries, and differences in substantive or procedural law. So if one claimant lives in State X, where courts and laws are unfavourable to their claim, but another claimant lives in the more favorable jurisdiction of State Y, they may bring a class action together in State Y.  Strictly speaking, State Y must not adjudicate the claim unless it is found that the applicable law is similar or identical in both states, but as a practical matter this rule is often disregarded in favor of efficient resolution of claims.&lt;ref&gt;see now, [[Class Action Fairness Act of 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|Class action section|date=February 2009}} Another measure particular to the U.S. is the introduction of "proportionate liability", in place of [[joint and several liability]].

===Claimed inefficiency of legal system===
According to economist Reed Neil Olsen, "...tort law generally and medical malpractice specifically serve two legitimate purposes.  First, the law serves to compensate victims for their losses.  Second, the threat of liability serves to deter future accidents." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://courses.missouristate.edu/ReedOlsen/medmal%20claims.pdf |title="The Efficiency of Medical Malpractice Law: Theory and Empirical Evidence" (October 2000) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tort reformers maintain that the present tort system is an expensive and inefficient way to compensate those injured.

According to a 2004 study of medical malpractice costs, "program administration—defense and underwriting costs—accounts for approximately 60 percent of total malpractice costs, and only 50 percent of total malpractice costs are returned to patients. These costs are high even when compared with other tort-based systems, such as automobile litigation or airplane crashes, that determine fault and compensate victims. Moreover, most patients that receive negligent care never receive any compensation. The Harvard Medical Practice Study found that only one malpractice claim was filed for every eight negligent medical injuries." Of the legal changes proposed by tort reformers, this study found that states capping payouts and restricting non-economic damages saw an average decrease of 17.1% in malpractice insurance premiums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/content/full/hlthaff.w4.20v1/DC1 |title="The Medical Malpractice ‘Crisis’: Recent Trends And The Impact Of State Tort Reforms" by Kenneth E. Thorpe (January 21, 2004) |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.w4.20 |publisher=Content.healthaffairs.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, more recent research provided by the insurance industry to the publication Medical Liability Monitor indicated that medical malpractice insurance rates had declined for four straight years. The decrease was seen in both states that had enacted tort reform and in states that had not, leading actuaries familiar with the data to suggest that patient safety and risk management campaigns had had a more significant effect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/751009 Rising Insurance Premiums? Yes and No.] Medscape Medical News, October 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Klick/Stratman (2005) found that capping economic damages saw an increase in doctors per capita.&lt;ref name=Ks2005&gt;{{cite journal|ssrn=870492|journal=Journal of Legal Studies|title="Does Medical Malpractice Reform Help States Retain Physicians and Does it Matter?" by Jonathan Klick and Thomas Stratman (2005) |doi=10.2139/ssrn.453481 |publisher=SSRN |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no guarantee, however, that any savings from tort reform would be efficiently distributed. Tort reform in Texas during the 1990s created $600 million in savings for insurance companies while the fraction of policy dollars needed to cover losses fell from 70.1 cents in losses in 1993 to 58.2 cents in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F07E7DF103AF933A15750C0A9669C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink |title="Bush Calls Himself Reformer; the Record Shows the Label May Be a Stretch" by Richard A Oppel Jr. and Jim Yardley, NY Times, March 20, 2000 |publisher=New York Times |date=2000-03-20 |accessdate=2012-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of these liability-limiting measures contend that insurance premiums are only nominally reduced, if at all, in comparison to savings for insurance companies. Further, opponents claim that parties are still being injured at similar or higher rates, due to malpractice not being deterred by tort claims and the attraction of lower quality physicians to "tort reformed" states.

===Special medical malpractice courts===
Tort reform advocate [[Common Good (organization)|Common Good]] has proposed creating specialized medical courts (similar to distinct tax courts) where medically trained judges would evaluate cases and subsequently render precedent-setting decisions. Proponents believe that giving up [[trial by jury|jury trials]] and scheduling noneconomic damages such as [[pain and suffering]] would lead to more people being compensated, and to their receiving their money sooner. Critics of the health courts concept contend that it is ill-conceived, that it would be unfair to patients, that it would be unlikely to achieve its objectives, and that much of its goals as are reasonable can be achieved more fairly and with greater efficiency under the existing civil justice system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1785383 "The Case Against Health Courts"], Mehlman, Maxwell and Nance, Dale A., April 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, experts have suggested that health courts would be inevitably biased towards physicians, and that the bureaucracy needed to introduce safeguards against such bias would negate any cost savings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bu.edu/law/central/jd/organizations/journals/bulr/documents/PETERS.pdf "Health Courts?"] Philip G. Peters, Jr., Boston University Law Review, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, a number of groups and individuals have supported this proposal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.com/jsp/nlj/PubArticleNLJ.jsp?id=1114798472362 National Law Journal], [https://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2005-07-04-our-view_x.htm 'Health courts' offer cure] USA Today, July 4, 2005, accessed Aug. 3, 2006; and [https://web.archive.org/web/20070224100406/http://cgood.org/healthcare-newscommentary-inthenews-252.html Health Courts Endorsed in Wall Street Journal] by Betsy McCaughey The Wall Street Journal, August 24, 2005, accessed Aug. 2, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
In general, tort reform advocates contend that too many of the over 15 million lawsuits filed in the [[United States]] each year are "frivolous" lawsuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tortreformtruth.com/fact-vs-fiction/frivolous-lawsuits/| title=Frivolous Lawsuits}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "frivolous lawsuit" has acquired a broader rhetorical definition in political debates about tort reform, where it is sometimes used by reform advocates to describe legally non-frivolous tort lawsuits that critics believe are without merit, or award high damage awards relative to actual damages.

Tort reform advocates argue that the present tort system is too expensive, that meritless lawsuits clog up the courts, that per capita tort costs vary significantly from state to state, and that trial [[Lawyer|attorneys]] too often receive an overly large percentage of the punitive damages awarded to [[plaintiff]]s in tort cases.  (The typical contingent fee arrangement provides for the lawyer to retain one-third of any recovery.)&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12343874787414637982&amp;q=352+SE+2d+73&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2002 "Hayseeds, Inc. v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas."], 352 S.E.2d 73, 80 (W.Va. 1986) ("the standard contingent fee is 33 percent")&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Towers Perrin]] report indicates that U. S. tort costs were up slightly in 2007, are expected to significantly increase in 2008, and shows trends dating back as far as 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.towersperrin.com/tp/showdctmdoc.jsp?country=usa&amp;url=Master_Brand_2/USA/News/Spotlights/2008/Nov/2008_11_19_spotlight_tort_costs.htm |title=Towers Perrin 2008 Update on U.S. Tort Cost Trends |publisher=Towersperrin.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent research from the same source has found that tort costs as a percentage of GDP dropped between 2001 and 2009, and are now at their lowest level since 1984.&lt;ref name="towerswatson1"&gt;[http://www.towerswatson.com/assets/pdf/3424/Towers-Watson-Tort-Report-1.pdf U.S. Tort Cost Trends 2010 Update] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128010535/http://www.towerswatson.com/assets/pdf/3424/Towers-Watson-Tort-Report-1.pdf |date=2012-01-28 }} Towers Watson, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; High-profile tort cases are often portrayed by the media as the legal system's version of a [[lottery]], where trial lawyers actively seek the magic combination of plaintiff, defendant, judge, and jury. Advocates of tort reform complain of unconstitutional regulation caused by litigation, and that litigation is used to circumvent the legislative process by achieving regulation that Congress is unwilling or unable to pass.

Tort reform is also proposed as one solution to rapidly increasing health care costs in the United States.  In a study published in 2005 in the Journal of the American Medical Association, 93% of physicians surveyed reported practicing [[defensive medicine]], or "[altering] clinical behavior because of the threat of malpractice liability." &lt;ref name="JAMA"&gt;Defensive Medicine Among High-Risk Specialist Physicians in a Volatile Malpractice Environment (abstract), Journal of the American Medical Association, 2005;293:2609-2617, "[http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/short/293/21/2609]"&lt;/ref&gt;  Of physicians surveyed, 43% reported using digital imaging technology in clinically unnecessary circumstances, which includes costly [[MRI]]s and [[CAT scan]]s.&lt;ref name="JAMA"/&gt;  Forty-two percent of respondents reported that they had taken steps to restrict their practice in the previous 3 years, including eliminating procedures prone to complications, such as trauma surgery, and avoiding patients who had complex medical problems or were perceived as litigious.&lt;ref name="JAMA"/&gt;

A few of the changes frequently advocated include limits on [[punitive damages]], [[non-economic damages caps|limits on non-economic damages]], limiting the [[collateral source doctrine]], use of court-appointed [[expert witnesses]], elimination of elections for judges, reducing [[Supersedeas bond|appeal bond requirements]] for defendants faced with bankruptcy, "venue reform", which limits the jurisdictions within which one can file a lawsuit, limits on [[contingency fee]]s, the adoption of the [[English Rule]] of "loser pays" (the defeated party must pay both the plaintiff's and the defendant's expenses), and requiring that [[class action]] lawsuits with nationwide plaintiffs be tried in federal courts, eliminating awards for pre-judgment interest.
&lt;!-- Changes commonly advocated in the United States include: caps on [[non-economic damages caps|non-economic damages]] (e.g., monetary compensation for pain and suffering), [[punitive damages]], and sometimes even economic [[damages]] (e.g., medical expenses, lost income, etc.); otherwise limiting [[consumer]]s' [[compensation]] in the courts; sanctions by courts against those who have filed baseless lawsuits; eliminating [[joint and several liability]]; enforcement of [[arbitration]] clauses and other contractual waivers; stricter [[statute of limitations|statutes of limitations]] and [[statute of repose|statutes of repose]]; and granting immunity to some types of defendants in certain circumstances, such as immunity from claims of alleged violations of state common law for actions that were required by federal regulation. Other proposals are procedural in nature, such as [[venue]] restrictions; higher standards for the filing of a complaint; limits on the admissibility of [[expert witness]] testimony to that which meets a narrower criteria; the establishment of procedures for the regular use of neutral, court-appointed, expert witnesses; changes in other [[evidence|evidentiary rules]], such as permitting the admission of evidence that a plaintiff was not wearing a [[seatbelt]]; eliminating the popular election of judges, which exists in some American [[U.S. state|states]] and localities; changing [[appeal bond]] requirements to permit defendants to file appeals when faced with potentially bankrupting judgments; improvements to [[jury]] selection and [[voir dire]]; making [[discovery (law)|discovery]] obligations less burdensome; adopting the "[[English rule]]" of "loser pays"; limits on [[attorney's fees]]; [[due process]] protection for defendants and unnamed plaintiffs in [[class action]] litigation; or ensuring that class actions with a nationwide class of plaintiffs are [[Class Action Fairness Act of 2005|tried in federal courts]], rather than state courts. --&gt;
Many of these measures tend to benefit defendants; others, such as the English rule, sanctions for delay, and early-offer settlement requirements, could have benefits to plaintiffs in some cases.

Not all tort reform supporters support all proposed tort reforms. For example, there is a split over whether the [[collateral source doctrine]] should be abolished, and there is a healthy debate over whether it would be beneficial to further restrict the ability of attorneys to charge [[contingent fee]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.forbes.com/business/free_forbes/2005/1003/042.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123061928/http://www.forbes.com/business/free_forbes/2005/1003/042.html|archive-date= January 23, 2009|magazine=Forbes |title=Give the Lawyer His Cut |date=May 10, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disputed issues===
Critics of tort reform contend that real purpose of the proposed changes is to shield businesses, especially large corporations, from having to pay just compensation to consumers, patients and clients for damages incurred from [[fraud]], [[negligence]], [[medical malpractice]] or other legitimate tort claims. They contend that limitations on [[punitive damages]] and other restrictions on plaintiff's traditional rights will reduce corporate accountability. Because corporations typically engage in a cost-benefit analysis before considering whether to stop a wrongful action (such as polluting or not enacting proper measures for safety), they contend that corporations will decide that the cost of changing a wrongful practice would be greater than the cost of continuing it, unless there is the chance that the cost of continuing will be made greater by a successful lawsuit. In this view, the prospect of paying a small damage award would have little or no effect in correcting the wrongdoing, and would essentially allow the corporation to continue an unsafe practice unless state or federal regulators interceded.

Tort reform supporters argue that this precisely describes the problem: lawsuits over socially beneficial practices increase the costs of those practices, and thus improperly deter innovation and other economically desirable activity. They further suggest that small businesses are hurt worse by the threat of litigation than large corporations are, because the legal expenses from a single lawsuit can bankrupt a small businessperson.

====How would tort reform affect safety?====
Proponents of the existing tort system contend that tort reform advocates exaggerate the costs and ignore the benefits of the current tort system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epi.org/content.cfm/bp157 |title=The frivolous case for tort law change: Opponents of the legal system exaggerate its costs, ignore its benefits &amp;#124; Economic Policy Institute |publisher=Epi.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, consumer advocates and legal scholars contend that lawsuits encourage corporations to produce safer products, discourage them from selling dangerous products such as [[asbestos]], and encourage more safe and effective medical practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.justice.org/what-we-do/promote-accountability-safety |title=Promote Accountability &amp; Safety |publisher=American Association for Justice |accessdate=April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the early 1980s, Professor [[Stephen Teret]] and other faculty at The [[Johns Hopkins University]] School of Public Health argued that tort litigation was an important tool for the prevention of injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jhsph.edu/gunpolicy/litigation_pht.pdf|title=Litigation Is an Important Tool for Injury and Gun Violence Prevention|author=Johns Hopkins University Center for Gun Policy and Research|accessdate=April 11, 2018|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629192651/http://www.jhsph.edu/gunpolicy/litigation_pht.pdf|archivedate=June 29, 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Teret acknowledged that the primary purpose of tort lawsuits usually is to recover money damages for the injured persons, as compensation for their medical and other costs, he identified several ways that litigation can also enhance safety for everyone, including:

{{quote|(1) to avoid paying future damages, the creators of dangerous products or conditions may voluntarily make them safer; (2) where conduct is particularly egregious, courts may award punitive damages to deter that conduct in the future; (3) the process of gathering information prior to trial – called 'discovery' – can bring information to light that can be used by policy-makers to create new laws or regulations.}}

In contrast, a 2006 study by [[Emory University]] professors Paul Rubin and Joanna Shepherd argued that tort reform actually saved tens of thousands of lives because "lower expected liability costs result in lower prices, enabling consumers to buy more risk-reducing products such as medicines, safety equipment, and medical services, and as consumers take additional precautions to avoid accidents."  They also concluded that "caps on noneconomic damages, a higher evidence standard for punitive damages, product liability reform, and prejudgment interest reform lead to fewer accidental deaths, while reforms to the collateral source rule lead to increased deaths." &lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=781424  "Tort Reform and Accidental Deaths"] Rubin, Paul H. and Shepherd, Joanna, (February 20, 2006). Emory Law and Economics Research Paper No. 05-17 Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=781424&lt;/ref&gt;

Tort reform advocates cite a 1990 study of auto safety improvements by [[Harvard University]] professor [[John D. Graham]] for a conference at the [[Brookings Institution]] found that

{{quote|The case studies provide little evidence that expanded product liability risk was necessary to achieve the safety improvements that have been made. In the absence of liability risk, the combined effects of consumer demand, regulation, and professional responsibility would have been sufficient to achieve improved safety. In some cases, however, liability seemed to cause safety improvements to occur more quickly than they would have in the absence of liability.}}

Graham further notes that

{{quote|there is no evidence that expanded liability for design choices has been a significant cause of the passenger safety improvements witnessed since World War II. Graham concludes by endorsing reform, noting that case studies of the current product liability system "suggest that manufacturers may be inclined to delay design improvements when they fear that improvements will be used against them [in court].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=[[Peter W. Huber|Peter Huber]] and [[Robert Litan]]|title=The Liability Maze|author=[[John D. Graham]]|page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, design improvements to increase safety cannot be used against manufacturers in court to show that the product was unsafe. Rule 407 of the Federal Rule of Evidence specifically states, "evidence of the subsequent measures is not admissible to prove: negligence; culpable conduct; a defect in a product or its design; or a need for a warning or instruction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rule 407. Subsequent Remedial Measures|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_407|work=Federal Rules of Evidence|publisher=Legal Information Institute, Cornell University Law School}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This means that evidence of changing the design of a product after an accident cannot be used in court against the manufacturer to prove it is liable for the damage.

It is true, however, that the evidence could be introduced to prove "ownership, control, or the feasibility of precautionary measures." But, a lawyer representing the manufacturer could concede ownership and control, and thus prevent the evidence from being introduced for that purpose. And a lawyer for the manufacturer could seek to prevent the introduction of the evidence to show feasibility of precautionary measures if he/she argued such evidence would violate Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of evidence. Rule 403 bars evidence that is relevant, but overly prejudicial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rule 403. Excluding Relevant Evidence for Prejudice, Confusion, Waste of Time, or Other Reasons|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_403|work=Federal Rules of Evidence|publisher=Legal Information Institute, Cornell University Law School}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another presenter at the same Brooking Institution conference, [[Murray Mackay]] of the [[University of Birmingham]], claimed safety (and other) innovations were inhibited by fear of lawsuits:

{{quote|[[Strict liability|[S]trict liability]] has had a negative influence on innovation. It has held back new designs, consumed resources that might otherwise have been directed at design improvement, and added on costs to the consumer. ... [I]n Western European countries ... liability risks are low and the marketplace pays a premium for innovative technology in safety as well as other areas. As a result, most safety-related advances in recent years have come from European manufacturers and, more recently, from the Japanese. ...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=[[Peter W. Huber|Peter Huber]] and [[Robert Litan]]|title=The Liability Maze|author=[[John D. Graham]]|pages=220–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The effect of tort reform on medical outcomes has been studied with mixed results. A 2008 study found worse childbirth outcomes for mothers and infants in states with caps on non-economic damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Janet Currie]] and [[W.

The only tort reform effect that proved robust was a negative effect of collateral source reform on black infant mortality.&lt;ref name=Ks2005 /&gt;

Proponents of tort reform counter by pointing to data from New Zealand, which has abolished its medical tort system but has medical error rates close to those in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gswi.org/current_issues/Medical%20Error.htm Medical Error&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223234454/http://gswi.org/current_issues/Medical%20Error.htm |date=2009-02-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tort reform advocates, including [[Paul Offit]], also argue that litigation has driven from the U.S. marketplace many useful and safe medical advances, including [[Bendectin]] (the withdrawal of which has led to a doubling of hospital admissions for [[morning sickness]]) and [[vaccine]]s for [[Lyme disease]] and [[Group B Streptococcal disease]], which kills one hundred infants per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aei.org/events/type.upcoming,eventID.1304,filter.all/event_detail.asp|author=Paul A.

====Frivolous lawsuits====
Under some interpretations of the law, a [[frivolous lawsuit]] is one that cannot reasonably be supported under existing legal [[precedent]] or under a [[Good faith|good-faith]] argument for a change in the law. However, the term has a broader rhetorical definition; in political debates, "frivolous" is also used to describe [[tort]] lawsuits where there is only a remote link between the conduct of the [[defendant]] and the injuries alleged by the [[plaintiff]] or where the [[damages]] sought by the injured plaintiff are perceived to be too high for the injuries sustained. Tort reform advocates also complain about lawsuits that are brought based on purely hypothetical damages where the plaintiffs have suffered no tangible harm whatsoever, or where the harm caused could be traced to elements of excessive negligence or irresponsibility on the part of the claimant.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Real or fictional frivolous lawsuits are a popular target of American humor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.com/News/100400/Business/The_most_frivolous_la.shtml |title=Frivolous lawsuit contest |publisher=Sptimes.com |date=2000-10-04 |accessdate=2012-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/legal/lawsuits.asp |title=list of fictional frivolous lawsuits |publisher=Snopes.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of tort reform claim that frivolous lawsuits are common, costly, and based on the contingent-fee system of paying lawyers, while critics point out that summary judgments address those issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tortdeform.com/archives/2006/09/the_myth_of_the_frivolous_laws.html |title=The Myth Of The Frivolous Lawsuit |publisher=Tortdeform.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Existing rules, however, regulate the prosecution of "frivolous" lawsuits.  Under already existing law in every U.S. jurisdiction, if a defendant or the judge believes that a plaintiff has misrepresented the facts or the law or has brought a “frivolous” pleading, the defendant, or the court on its own initiative, may ask for the action to be thrown out and for the attorney bringing the action to be penalized with a variety of sanctions.  For example, Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide in part: "By presenting to the court a pleading, written motion, or other paper--whether by signing, filing, submitting, or later advocating it--an attorney or unrepresented party certifies that to the best of the person's knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances: . . . (2) the claims, defenses, and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a non-frivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; [and] (3) the factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule11.htm |title=Rule 11.

Ethical rules also forbid attorneys from filing "frivolous" lawsuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vsb.org/pro-guidelines/index.php/rules/preamble/ |title=Preamble: A Lawyer’s Responsibilities - Professional Guidelines and Rules of Conduct - Professional Guidelines |publisher=Vsb.org |date=2008-11-09 |accessdate=2012-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  State courts and bar associations typically publish sanctions imposed on attorneys for violations of these rules.  A simple review of these published opinions demonstrates that courts take violations of their pleading and ethical rules seriously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courts.state.va.us/opinions/opncavwp/1434024.pdf |title=FRANCES F.

Tort reform in Texas has imposed a requirement in medical malpractice cases that only a physician practicing or teaching in the same specialty as the defendant can serve as an expert witness in the matter. Additionally, a report from that witness showing evidence of negligence must be filed with the court within 120 days of the filing of the case. Failure to do so results in liability for the defendant's legal fees. Filing an action but failing to find a suitable expert or failure to file adequate reports within the time frame provided can result in hardship for a plaintiff who may already be crippled by physical injuries and bankrupted by medical fees.&lt;ref name=NYT012413&gt;{{cite news|title=Despite Counsel, Victim Is Hindered by Tort Laws|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/25/us/even-with-counsel-texas-amputee-is-hindered-by-state-tort-laws.html|accessdate=January 25, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 24, 2013|author=Becca Aaronson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Medias display of Frivolous litigation'''

Frivolous lawsuits are not only damaging to the image of America, but also to American citizens that try to exercise their rights and are dismissed because of the foolish nature of others cases. Frivolous lawsuits are real, this is true, however, the idea of frivolous litigation can cause harm to other cases that have substance but are misrepresented by bias. A famous example of a ‘frivolous’ case that was highly underestimated by the public is Liebeck v. McDonald's Restaurants. Mrs. Liebeck sued McDonald's for the extensive burns she received from their hot coffee. Mrs. Liebeck was not driving when her coffee spilled, nor was the car she was in moving. She was the passenger in a car that was stopped in the parking lot of the McDonald’s where she bought the coffee. She had the cup between her knees while removing the lid to add cream and sugar when the cup tipped over and spilled the entire contents on her lap.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.caoc.org/?pg=facts|title=The McDonalds Hot Coffee Case|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only did McDonald's have upwards of 700 complaints about this product being too hot previous to this case, but Liebeck suffered third degree burns and needed to have multiple skin grafts done to repair the damages, resulting in around 160,000 dollars just in medical bills. Before this case was taken to court, Liebeck reached out to the company, in which McDonald's responded with an 800 dollar offer, in which Liebeck decided to go to court.  After going to court, the plaintiff was awarded around 640 thousand dollars. Everyone immediately labeled this a frivolous case. [[ABC News]] called the case [[Liebeck v. McDonald's Restaurants|"the poster child of excessive lawsuits"]] and was a pivotal moment for those pushing tort reform. The media exploited this case in talk shows, ads, television shows, radio broadcasts, etc. However, in the film “Hot Coffee”, you can see how extensive the burns are and the public's reaction to the case once they have all the evidence.

====Regulation through litigation====
Advocates of tort reform also complain of [[regulation through litigation]], the idea that litigation is being used to achieve regulatory ends that advocates would not be able to achieve through the democratic process. For example, Rep. [[Rick Boucher]] (D-VA) argued in support of a [[Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act|2005 federal tort reform]] that gave immunity to gun manufacturers in certain lawsuits because such lawsuits were "nothing more than thinly veiled attempts to circumvent the legislative process and achieve gun control through litigation"; reform supporters complained that (and [[the Pentagon]] supported the bill on the grounds that) the plaintiffs were trying to "sue [gun manufacturers] out of existence" by forcing them to incur $250 million in legal defense expenses, while gun control supporters argued that the legislation took "away the right of victims to be able to have their day in court," that the bill gave unprecedented immunity to a single industry, and claimed that the law was unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/oct/21/nation/na-guns21 |title=LA Times (October 21, 2005) "Bill to Shield Gun Makers Is Approved" |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=2005-10-21 |accessdate=2012-06-28 |first=Richard |last=Simon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Healthcare industry====
Tort reform advocates argue that by limiting the threat of frivolous lawsuits, the medical industry would migrate away from practicing [[defensive medicine]].  This would reduce the number of unnecessary tests and procedures, typically performed under patient request, thereby reducing the costs of medical care in general.  As an argument against the current system, tort reformers link the rising costs of premiums for physicians' [[medical malpractice]] insurance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=4968&amp;type=0 |title=Congressional Budget Office (January 8, 2004) "Limiting Tort Liability for Medical Malpractice" |publisher=Cbo.gov |date=2004-01-08 |accessdate=2012-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the rising cost of personal and group policy health insurance coverage. California's [[Medical Injury Compensation Reform Act]] has been cited as a model for tort reform in health care.

Others deny that medical malpractice suits play a significant role in the cost of health care. Including legal fees, insurance costs, and payouts, the cost of all US malpractice suits comes to less than one-half of 1 percent of health-care spending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2145400/|title=The Medical Malpractice Myth|first=Ezra|last=Klein|date=11 July 2006|publisher=|accessdate=11 April 2018|newspaper=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other recent research suggests that malpractice pressure makes hospitals more efficient, not less so: "The recent focus by the American Medical Association and physicians about the dramatic increases in medical malpractice insurance premiums, and their suggestion of a cap on non-economic damages, deserves a closer look. According to [[Katherine Baicker|Baicker]] and Chandra (2004), increases in premiums are not affected by past or present malpractice payments, but may increase due to other unrelated factors. Chandra, Nundy, and Seabury (2005) find that the rising cost of medical services may explain the bulk of the growth of “compensatory awards”. They also find that the greatest ten percent of the malpractice payments have grown at a smaller pace than the average payment for the years 1991 and 2003. This means that the “medical malpractice crisis” is not necessarily fueled by the growth in malpractice payments. Furthermore, malpractice pressure actually forces our hospitals to be technically more efficient. This implies that existence of the medical malpractice system is beneficial, and its strength should not be diluted by either putting caps on non-economic damages or by decreasing the statute of limitations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/0/9/3/4/7/p93477_index.html |author1=Shalini Bagga |author2=M.

There has been a noticeable drop in medical malpractice insurance premiums for physicians in states that have enacted Tort Reform.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Particularly ones that capped non-economic damages such as Texas did in 2003.  For example, [[The Doctors Company]], a physician-owned medical liability insurer, was insuring OB/GYNs at a mature claims-made rate of $131,601, which was a 20% increase from the previous year.  As of 2008, the most an OB/GYN was paying for a liability insurance policy with [[The Doctors Company]] was $64,714. States that have not enacted Tort Reform legislation tend to have a higher cost of professional medical liability insurance than states that do.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Opponents of tort reform legislation often reference the story of Frank Cornelius, whose New York Times op-ed piece, “Crushed by My Own Reform,” told of allegedly negligent procedures performed by his physicians. In 1975, Cornelius had fought for damage caps, but he later came to repent of his role in that campaign.

Some say that federal licensing is a better approach and a strong central regulatory body is the answer to deal with negligent physicians who cross state lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Published: October 16, 1994 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/16/opinion/l-to-curb-malpractice-try-federal-licensing-538043.html?scp=1&amp;sq=crushed+by+my+own+reform&amp;st=nyt |title=To Curb Malpractice, Try Federal Licensing - New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1994-10-16 |accessdate=2012-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Controversy over the impact on business====

Some supporters of tort reform posit that reforms can significantly reduce the costs of doing business, thus benefiting consumers and the public in the long run.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} [[Harvard Business School]] professor [[Michael E. Porter]] stated: "product liability is so extreme and uncertain as to retard innovation. The legal and regulatory climate places firms in constant jeopardy of costly and ... lengthy product suits. The existing approach goes beyond any reasonable need to protect consumers, as other nations have demonstrated through more pragmatic approaches."&lt;ref&gt;Michael E. Porter, ''The Competitive Advantage of Nations'', p. 649, {{ISBN|0-684-84147-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A commission by the American Insurance Association and co-authored by [[Nobel Prize]] winner [[Joseph Stiglitz]] to look at the effects of bankruptcies from asbestos litigation on workers in the asbestos industry; the study estimated that 52,000 jobs were lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www.asbestossolution.org/stiglitz_report.pdf |author1=Joseph E. Stiglitz |author2=Jonathan M. Orszag |author3=Peter R. Orszag |title=The Impact of Asbestos Liabilities on Workers in Bankrupt Firms |date=December 2002 |publisher=Sebago Associates |accessdate=11 April 2018 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226081157/http://www.asbestossolution.org/stiglitz_report.pdf |archivedate=26 February 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of the tort reform movement dispute the claim that the current tort system has a significant impact on national or global economies. {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} The [[Economic Policy Institute]] wrote that the effect on the economy of job loss resulting from lawsuits is negligible:&lt;ref name="frivolous case for tort law change"&gt;Lawrence Chimerine and Ross Eisenbrey, [http://www.epi.org/content.cfm/bp157 The frivolous case for tort law change: Opponents of the legal system exaggerate its costs, ignore its benefits], [[Economic Policy Institute]], May 17, 2005 (EPI Briefing Paper #157), retrieved March 31, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;In an April 2002 paper, the CEA (President Bush's [[Council of Economic Advisors]]) examined the economic impacts of the tort system in somewhat greater depth. But that paper, too, failed to demonstrate any employment effects of the tort system and made no prediction about the impact of tort law change.  Even if we assume that asbestos liability legislation could somehow have prevented the loss of 2,500 jobs per year resulting from [[asbestos]]-related bankruptcies (by, for example, limiting compensation for non-economic damages to the victims or their survivors, or by denying awards of punitive damages), the effect on overall employment and the national unemployment rate in an economy with more than 130 million payroll jobs would have been imperceptible (a change of less than two-thousandths of 1%).&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;!-- During the 1990s, a period in which tort reform on a national level made little progress, a record number of jobs were added to the economy.--&gt;

Critics of tort reform also contend that the real purpose of the proposed changes is to shield businesses, especially large corporations, from having to pay just compensation to consumers, patients and clients for the harm incurred from [[fraud]], [[negligence]], [[medical malpractice]], [[product liability]] or other legitimate tort claims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Tort_reform "Tort Reform"] ''Sourcewatch: Center for Justice and Democracy.''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Specific industry protections====&lt;!-- I don't think this is "tort reform" as broadly understood; this section should be trimmed?--&gt;
In response to lawsuits filed against gun manufacturers by several municipalities, a bill was proposed by the [[U.S. Congress]] in 2005 that would provide [[immunity from prosecution|immunity]] to gun manufacturers for most negligence and product liability actions (and prohibit the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives]] from revoking a dealer's license, even in cases where a dealer has been identified as selling a relatively high number of guns subsequently used in violent crimes). {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

Organizations such as the United States Conference of Mayors oppose gun manufacturer immunity legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Ed Somers, "[http://www.usmayors.org/uscm/us_mayor_newspaper/documents/05_09_05/guns.asp Gun Immunity Considered by Congress]," ''U.S. Mayor Newspaper'', The United States Conference of Mayors, May 9, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Others have argued that the legislation took "away the right of victims to be able to have their day in court," that the bill gave unprecedented immunity to a single industry, and that the law was unconstitutional to the extent that it conflicted with the [[Separation of powers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenation.com/doc/20051107/scheer1025 "Gun Industry Buys Bulletproof Political Protection"] ''The Nation''. 25 October 2006. Retrieved July 15, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dispute over "litigation explosion" claims====
The [[American Tort Reform Association]] (ATRA) claims that "The cost of the U.S. tort system for 2003 was $246 billion, or $845 per citizen or $3,380 for a family of four" and "The Growth of U.S. tort costs have exceeded the [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP) by 2-3 percentage points in the past 50 years".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atra.org/wrap/files.cgi/7963_howtortreform.html|title=Facts About Tort Liability And Its Impact On Consumers|publisher=American Tort Reform Association|date=2007|accessdate=11 April 2018|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100731070852/http://www.atra.org/wrap/files.cgi/7963_howtortreform.html|archivedate=31 July 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This claim is based on a 2002 study by Tillinghast-Towers Perrin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.towersperrin.com/TILLINGHAST/publications/reports/Tort_2004/Tort.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|author=|date=19 May 2005|website=archive.org|accessdate=11 April 2018|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050519003044/http://www.towersperrin.com/TILLINGHAST/publications/reports/Tort_2004/Tort.pdf|archivedate=19 May 2005|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of tort reform deny that there has been a "litigation explosion" or "liability crisis", and contend that the changes proposed by tort reform advocates are unjustified. Records maintained by the [[National Center for State Courts]] show that population-adjusted tort filings declined from 1992 to 2001. The average change in tort filings was a 15% decrease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsconline.org/D_Research/csp/2003_Files/2003_Main_Page.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309052647/http://www.ncsconline.org/D_Research/csp/2003_Files/2003_Main_Page.html|archivedate=2010-03-09 |title=National Center for State Courts |publisher=Ncsconline.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bureau of Justice Statistics]], a division of the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] (DOJ), found that the number of civil trials dropped by 47% between 1992 and 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/ctcvlc01.htm|title=Civil Trial Cases and Verdicts in Large Counties, 2001|publisher=U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics|accessdate=11 April 2018|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090722204234/http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/ctcvlc01.htm|archivedate=22 July 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DOJ also found that the median inflation-adjusted award in all tort cases dropped 56.3% between 1992 and 2001 to $28,000.

Tort reform advocates allege that these numbers are misleading. They claim that most liability costs come from pre-trial settlements, so the number of trials is irrelevant.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Supporters further note that the number of "filings" is a misleading statistic, because modern filings are much more likely to be class actions with many more joined claims than the cases of decades ago. They also note that the choice of the 1992 start date is misleading, because the largest increase in the number of tort cases occurred between 1970 and 1992. They also argue that the use of the median, rather than the mean, is a misleading statistic for measuring the magnitude of the litigation problem.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

Supporters frequently base their claims of an "explosion" in the costs of tort litigation based on annual studies by [[Tillinghast]]/[[Towers Perrin]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.towersperrin.com/tp/jsp/masterbrand_html.jsp?webc=176/global/about/about.htm&amp;selected=about Tillinghast/Towers Perrin]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025041340/http://www.towersperrin.com/tp/jsp/masterbrand_html.jsp?webc=176%2Fglobal%2Fabout%2Fabout.htm&amp;selected=about |date=October 25, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a major consultant to the insurance industry. In 2008, Towers Perrin reported that the cost of liability litigation has outpaced the growth of the [[GDP]] growth of 9% in estimated annual tort costs between 1951 and 2007 as opposed to a 7% average annual growth in GDP—representing 2.2% of GDP in 2004 vs. just 0.6% in 1950 and 1.3% in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.towersperrin.com/tp/showdctmdoc.jsp?country=usa&amp;url=Master_Brand_2/USA/News/Spotlights/2008/Nov/2008_11_19_spotlight_tort_costs.htm |title=Towers Perrin report on tort costs through 2007 |publisher=Towersperrin.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Sponsored by |url=http://www.economist.com/agenda/displayStory.cfm?story_id=3598225 |title=Economist |publisher=Economist |date= 2005-01-26|accessdate=2012-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent research from the same source has found that tort costs as a percentage of GDP dropped between 2001 and 2009, and are now at their lowest level since 1984.&lt;ref name="towerswatson1"/&gt;
The Tillinghast/Towers Perrin study has been criticized by the [[Economic Policy Institute]], a progressive think tank:&lt;ref name="frivolous case for tort law change" /&gt; {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} "Although TTP's estimate is widely cited by journalists, politicians, and business lobbyists, it is impossible to know what the company is actually measuring in its calculation of tort costs, and impossible to verify its figures, because TTP will not share its data or its methodology, which it claims are 'proprietary.'" Tort reform supporters claim that the Towers Perrin numbers are underestimates in many ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epi.org/publications/entry/bp157/ |title=Economic Policy Institute (May 2005) |publisher=Epi.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Olson |first=Walter |url=http://www.pointoflaw.com/archives/001165.php |title=Walter Olson summary, with links (May 2005) |publisher=Pointoflaw.com |date=2005-05-26 |accessdate=2012-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Corporate lawsuit abuse====
Tort reform opponents argue that corporations and insurance companies are the worst abusers of the litigation system. {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} In particular, they contend, corporations often use their enormous resources to unfairly delay trial, pursue frivolous appeals, and contest claims in which liability is clear. {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} In response, a number of tort reform supporters argue that that criticism is not a reason to oppose tort reform; such abuse would be deterred by proposed tort reforms such as "loser pays," which would prevent large corporations from using litigation as a cudgel against individuals and small businesses who cannot afford to defend themselves in court by providing an incentive for law firms to provide contingent defense. {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Opponents of tort reform contend that most private citizens would be afraid to sue wealthy corporations or insurers if they could be [[bankrupt]]ed by an award of the defendant's legal fees if they lost. {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} This would limit legitimate claims, and effectively deny many citizens a forum to redress the harm caused them.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

====Changing definitions of torts====
Tort reform in Texas changed the definition of negligence in the context of emergency room treatment to include only “willful and wanton” acts. This has been interpreted as including only acts intended to harm the patient.&lt;ref name=NYT012413 /&gt;

==== Hailstorm litigation reform ====
In March and April 2012, the [[Rio Grande Valley|Lower Rio Grande Valley]] in Texas was hit with two severe hailstorms. ''[[Texas Monthly]]'' wrote, “Windows were shattered. Hail knocked holes in rooftops. Unfortunate animals were beaten to death.” Insurers paid out $556 million in claims to homeowners and $47 million to car owners. After the storms, thousands of lawsuits were filed against insurers and adjusters. The lawsuits were based on allegations of “low-ball payments on claims.” As a reaction, a state senator introduced legislation (Senate Bill 1628) to reform hailstorm litigation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.texasmonthly.com/burka-blog/a-hail-of-a-storm-is-brewing-in-the-senate/|title=A Hail of a Storm Is Brewing in the Senate|last=Ratcliffe|first=R.G.|date=2015-04-29|work=Texas Monthly|access-date=2017-04-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill represented “an almost visceral fight between the insurance industry, Texans for Lawsuit Reform and trial lawyers whose symbolic leader in storm-damage claims in Steve Mostyn of Houston.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By 2014, there had been 2,000 lawsuits filed in [[Hidalgo County, Texas|Hidalgo County]], Texas. “One local attorney had erected a billboard ‘evoking [[fire and brimstone]]’ to remind homeowners that they had to file a claim within two years.” According to ''Texas Monthly'', “By May [of 2014], there had been 5,972 lawsuits filed, with Mostyn and members of his firm filing 1,612 of them.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Mostyn “had pioneered” lawsuits for storm damage after [[Hurricane Ike]]. He made over $86 million in legal fees.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In February 2017, a bill was introduced in the [[Texas Senate|Texas state Senate]] that would aim “at ending hailstorm lawsuit abuse.” Texas Lt. Gov. [[Dan Patrick (politician)|Dan Patrick]] supported the bill (Senate Bill 10) and said during his [[State of the State address]], “Hailstorm litigation is the newest form of [[Legal abuse|lawsuit abuse]].” Patrick said that storm litigation rates had risen dramatically, causing insurance companies to increase premiums and reduce coverage. The bill would still allow hailstorm insurance claimants to sue their insurance company. It would allow plaintiffs to sue for either deceptive trade practices or unfair settlement, but not both. According to ''SE Texas Record'', “The bill also seeks to end [[Barratry (common law)|barratry]] in hail litigation, as reports of lawyers employing contractors and insurance adjusters to drum up clients have continued to surface the past several years.” The bill would also prevent plaintiffs from suing their individual insurance agent. An identical bill (HB 1774) was introduced in the [[Texas House of Representatives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://setexasrecord.com/stories/511082081-hailstorm-lawsuit-reform-bill-introduced-in-texas-senate|title=Hailstorm lawsuit reform bill introduced in Texas Senate|last=Yates|first=David|date=2017-02-13|work=SE Texas Record|access-date=2017-04-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Debates over individual reforms in the United States===
A number of proposals have been made by advocates of tort reform, although these proposals are not agreed on by all 'tort reformers' and are considered by many opponents a roll-back of the reforms of the twentieth century. {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} The [[collateral source rule]], for example, dates back to 1854.&lt;ref&gt;First promulgated in ''The Propeller Monticello v. Mollison'', 58 U.S. (17 How.) 152 (1854)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- language here seems POV --&gt;

====Non-economic damages caps====
{{Main|Non-economic damages caps}}
Non-economic damages caps place limits on a jury's ability to award damages to victims for [[pain and suffering]] and loss of enjoyment of life as well as [[punitive damages]]. The purpose of these reforms is to allow for fair compensation for victims while preventing excessive, emotionally driven jury awards from bankrupting entire organizations and leading to job losses and cost increases for consumers. {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

Proposals to cap non-economic damages are one of the most frequently proposed tort reforms, and have generated controversy over their fairness, efficacy, and constitutionality.  {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Critics complain that limitations on [[punitive damages]] and other restrictions on plaintiff's traditional rights will reduce corporate accountability. {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Because corporations engage in a cost-benefit analysis before considering whether to stop a wrongful action (such as polluting or not enacting proper measures for safety), caps on damages may well encourage corporate malfeasance.  {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} They contend that the prospect of paying a small damage award provides too little incentive to correct the wrongdoing, and would allow the corporation to profitably continue an unsafe practice.  {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

For example, tort reform critics point to the story surrounding the Ford Pinto,&lt;ref name="dowie"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dowie|first1=Mark|title=Pinto Madness|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/1977/09/pinto-madness/|accessdate=13 September 2017|agency=Mother Jones|date=September 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; where accountants determined that the expected payout in [[wrongful death]] suits would be less than making a design change to prevent the gas tanks from blowing up on minimum impact.  "This cost-benefit analysis" that Ford completed found "that Ford should not make an $11-per-car improvement that would prevent 180 fiery deaths a year," because doing so would be a net cost.  (This analysis valued human lives at $200,725 each.)&lt;ref name="dowie"/&gt;  In other words, it was cheaper for Ford to fend off wrongful death lawsuits than to implement the safety improvement.  For tort reform critics, the prospect of unpredictably large damage awards would reduce the incentive that companies have to behave in this manner.

====Joint and several liability====
{{Main|Joint and several liability}}
Tort reformers have had the most legislative success in limiting the [[common law]] rule of [[joint and several liability]], often replacing it with a rule of proportionate liability. Of the forty-six states that had a joint and several liability rule, thirty-three states have abolished or limited the rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atra.org/show/7345|title=Joint and Several Liability Rule Reform|publisher=American Tort Reform Association|accessdate=11 April 2018|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100803010108/http://www.atra.org/show/7345|archivedate=3 August 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of tort reform contend that the elimination of the rule would under-compensate people who had the misfortune to be hurt by more than one person, if at least one of the defendants does not have the financial means to pay his or her share of proportionate liability. {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

====Loser pays====
Nearly every Western democracy follows the "English rule," which requires the loser of a civil suit to compensate the winner for his or her attorney's fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pointoflaw.com/loserpays/overview.php |title=Loser Pays |publisher=PointofLaw.com |date=2004-05-21 |accessdate=2012-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, after authors [[Michael Baigent]] and [[Richard Leigh (author)|Richard Leigh]] lost their plagiarism litigation over ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' in a British court, they were ordered to pay the defendants' $1.75 million in attorneys' fees.  {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

The "American rule" differs; in most cases, each party bears its own expense of litigation.  Supporters of tort reform argue that loser-pays rules are fairer, would compensate winners of lawsuits against the costs of litigation, would deter marginal lawsuits and tactical litigation, and would create proper incentives for litigation, and argue for reforms that would require compensation of winning defendants some or all the time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pointoflaw.com/books/tle_chap15.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In federal courts, debate has focused on the scope of [[Federal Rule of Civil Procedure]] Rule 11, which sanctions attorneys in some situations for making frivolous filings. {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

Opponents argue that such rules would have had a chilling effect on civil rights litigation. Proposals to limit frivolous lawsuits have been criticized on the grounds that the restrictions could be used to impede individuals attempting to enforce civil rights laws, according to ''The Federal Judicial Center's Study of Rule 11.'' [[Robert L. Carter]], United States District Court Judge for the [[Southern District of New York]], and Rep. [[Sheila Jackson Lee]] have both argued that [[Brown v. Board of Education]] would have been called frivolous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/cpquery/?&amp;dbname=cp109&amp;sid=cp109l6w35&amp;refer=&amp;r_n=hr123.109&amp;item=&amp;sel=TOC_262458&amp;|title=Congress.gov - Library of Congress|author=|date=|website=thomas.loc.gov|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, reform supporters note that victorious civil rights litigation could hardly be deemed "frivolous"; that desegregation was accomplished through legislative, rather than judicial action; and that reform opponents overstate the importance of litigation in the civil rights movement.&lt;ref&gt;See on this subject, ''[[The Hollow Hope]]'' by Gerald N. Rosenberg.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tort reform in US politics===
Tort reform is controversial. [[George W. Bush]] made tort reform a centerpiece of his successful run for [[Texas]] governor and of his second-term domestic policy agenda. &lt;!-- This has led to the issue becoming more of a major rift between the [[United States Republican Party|Republicans]] and [[United States Democratic Party|Democrats]].--&gt; In the [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]], Democratic vice presidential nominee [[John Edwards]], a successful trial attorney, was criticized by tort reform advocates for lawsuits that he brought against obstetricians on behalf of children who suffered severe birth injuries; reformers criticized the suits as relying on "[[junk science]]", while Edwards denied the allegation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewPolitics.asp?Page=%5CPolitics%5Carchive%5C200401%5CPOL20040120a.html |title=Did 'Junk Science' Make John Edwards Rich? |author=Mark Morano |date=January 20, 2004 |website=CNSNews.com |accessdate=11 April 2018 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217142146/http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewPolitics.asp?Page=%5CPolitics%5Carchive%5C200401%5CPOL20040120a.html |archivedate=17 December 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Republican lobbyist [[Grover Norquist]] points out possible political motivations for tort reform, writing in ''[[American Spectator]]'' that "Modest tort reform, much of which has been actively considered by committees in both houses, would defund the trial lawyers, now second only to the unions, and this is debatable, as the funding source of the Left in America." But the debate over tort reform is not always a partisan affair. As a senator, [[Barack Obama]] voted for the [[Class Action Fairness Act of 2005]] and for the [[FISA Amendments Act of 2008|FISA Amendments Act]], which granted civil immunity to telecommunications companies that cooperated with [[NSA warrantless surveillance controversy|NSA warrantless wiretapping]] operations.&lt;ref name="Fisher"&gt;{{cite news

The [[United States Supreme Court]] sometimes weighs in on tort reform debates, but here too, the justices do not always vote according to their predicted ideological stereotypes. In the seminal case of ''[[BMW v. Gore]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=000&amp;invol=U10178&amp;friend=oyez BMW v. Gore]'', 517 U.S. 559 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; the court ruled that the Constitution placed limits on punitive damages, with liberal justices [[Stephen Breyer]] and [[John Paul Stevens]] in the majority and Justices [[Antonin Scalia]] and [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] dissenting. Under Chief Justice [[John Roberts]], some expect the court to be more likely to take cases that could resolve tort reform debates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pointoflaw.com/archives/001338.php|title=The nominee is John Roberts |author=Ted Frank |date=July 20, 2005 |website=www.pointoflaw.com|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Corporatism sidebar|Schools}}
'''Tripartism''' is economic [[corporatism]] based on tripartite contracts of [[Employers' organization|business]], [[Labour movement|labour]], and [[State (polity)|state]] affiliations within the economy.{{sfn|Wiarda|1996|p=22}} Each is to act as a [[Social partnership|social partner]] to create economic policy through cooperation, consultation, negotiation, and compromise.{{sfn|Wiarda|1996|p=22}} Tripartism is a common form in [[neo-corporatism]].{{sfn|Wiarda|1996|p=22}}

Tripartism became a popular form of economic policy during the economic crisis of the 1930s.{{sfn|Slomp|2000|p=81}} Tripartism was supported from a number of different political perspectives at this time: one was [[Catholic social teaching]]; [[fascism]] supported this for fascist unions but repressed [[Communism|communist]] and [[Social democracy|social democratic]] unions; and in democratic politics.{{sfn|Slomp|2000|p=81}} Tripartism is a prominent economic policy in [[Europe]], particularly where [[Christian Democracy|Christian Democratic]] parties influenced by Catholic social teaching have held power; it is a core part of the economic systems in [[Scandinavia]] and the [[Benelux]] that were put in place by social democratic governments.{{sfn|Slomp|2000|p=82}} An example is a [[National income policy agreement (Finland)|national income policy agreement in Finland]]. Tripartite agreements are an important component in practical labour law, since they cover not only wages, but also issues such as policies on benefits, vacation, workhours and worker safety.

==International Labour Organization==
The [[International Labour Organization]] is the only [[United Nations]] agency that is based on tripartism. It uses the discussions between the three groups in drafting of standards and conventions. Also for the implementation of ILO-standards in national law tripartite consultations on a national level are a requirement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/global/standards/subjects-covered-by-international-labour-standards/tripartite-consultation/lang--en/index.htm|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=27 April 2016|title=International Labour Standards on Tripartite consultation}}&lt;/ref&gt; for those countries party to the [[Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention, 1976]].

The United States [[International Labour Organization#US membership and withdrawal|withdrew]] from the ILO in 1977, based partly on the claim that [[Communism|communist]] countries could not send authentically tripartite representation.{{sfn|Standing|2008}}{{sfn|Beigbeder|1979}}

==The history about tripartism in ILO==
Some countries have already used a tripartite structure to deal with social issues at the end of 19th century. And [[World War I]] made this type of approach far more urgent. In this new kind of conflict, military success was tightly bound up with the ability of nations to support increasing demands on their economies and to build ever more sophisticated weapons, which demanded concerted industrial efforts. Business and labour had to become involved in policy and cooperate to support the national effort.

During the war, [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] countries had made lots of promises to trade unions and employers so that they could make sure contribution of business to the war effort. Trade union and employers were invited to sit on governmental bodies in [[Great Britain]], the United States and elsewhere. Moreover, unions were asked to forego acquired trade union rights for the sake of the war effort with promises that these rights would be restored after the conflict.

The first draft of the labour proposals for the peace conference had been prepared by [[British Government]] and became the basis for the discussions in the Labour Commission, and these proposals included the establishment of an international organization for labour legislation that would give a voting role to representatives of workers and employers.

To sum up, ILO offered the world different way to solve social strife. It provided it with the procedures and techniques of bargaining and negotiation to replace violent conflict as a means of securing more humane and dignified conditions of work. While there have been problems along the way, tripartism has generally survived without successful challenge to the principle, despite attempts by [[the Soviet Union]], in particular, to weaken it. As [[World War II]] would to a close, the value of tripartism was reaffirmed in [[Declaration of Philadelphia]].{{sfn|Rodgers|Lee|Swepston|Van Daele|2009|pp=13–14}}

==Tripartism in practice==
The implications of tripartism in the ILO are manifold. To put it simply, the participation in the ILO deliberations of delegates directly representing the interest of workers and employers adds a connection with economic reality that cannot be reproduced in an organization where governments are the only spokespersons.
The roles played by representatives of workers and employers differ markedly. For workers, the ILO is a major instrument to pursue their goals, and they have a much more active agenda than employers. On the other hand, employers frequently play the role of the “brake” on initiatives put forward both by the workers and the Office and its Director-General, to slow action they consider hasty, or which would work against the perceived interest of business.

The ILO is valuable for both workers and employers because of the voice and influence that it offers them. One author aptly characterizes the importance of tripartism, when discussing the ILO’s remarkable survival through World War II, as having been both a [[straitjacket]] and a [[lifejacket]]. As the ILO’s Committee on Freedom of Association put it, "the right conferred upon workers' and employers' organizations must be based on respect for those civil liberties which have been enunciated in particular in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], the absence of these civil liberties removes all meaning from the concept of trade union rights.
Ever if tripartism makes the ILO far more representative of civil society than any other intergovernmental organization, employers' and workers' organization, employers’ and workers’ organizations necessarily represent the formal economy rather than the huge –and growing-informal economy, especially in [[developing nations]]. In addition, with membership of [[trade unions]] shrinking in many industrialized states, the representativeness of these organizations even in the formal sector is often questioned.
The challenge for the ILO and its constituents is to adapt the [[wikt:tripartite|tripartite]] model to a globalizing world, where there are new actors operating outside national frameworks and increasingly diverse forms of voice and representation. Some measures of accommodation have been found, for instance involving cooperation with [[NGO]]s in action against child labour, and dialogue with parliamentarians and other important actors. The broader challenge remains.{{sfn|Rodgers|Lee|Swepston|Van Daele|2009|pp=15–18}}

The '''Ultra-Lettrist''' movement was an art form developed by Jean-Louis Brau, [[Gil J Wolman]], and [[François Dufrêne]], in the 1950s, when they split from [[Isidore Isou]]'s [[Lettrism]]. 

They issued a periodical called ''grammeS: Review of the Ultra-Lettriste Group'', which ran for seven issues between 1957 and 1961. They used their journal to publish [[hypergraphics]]  which included exchanges and discussions with the Lettrists' ''Poésie Nouvelle'' and the [[Situationist International]].

Some Ultra-Lettrists went on to form the [[Nouveau réalisme]] school while others joined the Situationist International.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=sa_hymCZQQIC&amp;lpg=PA112&amp;dq=Ultra%20Lettrist%20group&amp;pg=PA112#v=onepage&amp;q=Ultra%20Lettrist%20group&amp;f=false Craig J.
