'''Arp 302''' (also known as '''Exclamation Point Galaxy''') is a galaxy in the constellation [[Boötes]]. Arp 302, also known as [[Vorontsov-Vel'yaminov Interacting Galaxies|VV]] 340 or UGC 9618 consists of a pair of very gas-rich spiral galaxies in their early stages of interaction. An enormous amount of infrared light is radiated by the gas from massive stars that are forming at a rate similar to the most vigorous giant star-forming regions in our own Milky Way. Arp 302 is 450 million light-years away from Earth, and is the 302nd galaxy in Arp's [[Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies]].

'''Attlee Glacier''' ({{coord|66|13|S|63|46|W|type:glacier_region:AQ_source:GNIS|display=inline,title}}) is a [[glacier]] {{convert|8|mi}} long, which flows east-southeast from the [[plateau]] [[escarpment]] on the east side of [[Graham Land]] to the head of [[Cabinet Inlet]] to the north of [[Bevin Glacier]]. During December 1947, the glacier was charted from the ground by the [[Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey]] (FIDS) and photographed from the air by the [[Ronne Antarctic Research Expedition]]. It was named by the FIDS for Rt. Hon. [[Clement Attlee]], M.P., British [[Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs]], member of the [[War Cabinet]], and later [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]].

'''Autonomous sensory meridian response''' ('''ASMR''') is an experience characterized by a static-like or tingling sensation on the skin that typically begins on the scalp and moves down the back of the neck and upper spine. It has been compared with [[Synesthesia#Auditory-tactile synesthesia|auditory-tactile synesthesia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simner|first1=Julia|last2=Mulvenna|first2=Catherine|last3=Sagiv|first3=Noam|last4=Tsakanikos|first4=Elias|last5=Witherby|first5=Sarah A.|last6=Fraser|first6=Christine|last7=Scott|first7=Kirsten|last8=Ward|first8=Jamie|title=Synaesthesia: the prevalence of atypical cross-modal experiences|journal=Perception|date=2006|volume=35|issue=8|doi=10.1068/p5469|url=http://pec.sagepub.com/content/35/8/1024|accessdate=25 November 2016|pages=1024–1033|pmid=17076063}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Banissy|first1=Michael J.|last2=Jonas|first2=Clare|last3=Cohen Kadosh|first3=Roi|title=Synesthesia: an introduction|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|date=15 December 2014|volume=5|issue=1414|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01414|url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01414/full|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may overlap with [[frisson]].

ASMR signifies the subjective experience of "low-grade euphoria" characterized by "a combination of positive feelings and a distinct static-like tingling sensation on the skin". It is most commonly triggered by specific auditory or visual stimuli, and less commonly by intentional attention control.&lt;ref name="PMID25834771"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Barratt Emma, Davis Nick | year = 2015 | title = Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR): a flow-like mental state | url = | journal = [[PeerJ]] | volume = 3 | issue = | page = e851 | doi = 10.7717/peerj.851 | pmid = 25834771 | pmc=4380153}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PMID24375123"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ahuja Nitin | year = 2013 | title = It feels good to be measured: clinical role-play, Walker Percy, and the tingles | url = | journal = [[Perspectives in Biology and Medicine]] | volume = 56 | issue = 3| pages = 442–451 | pmid = 24375123 | doi=10.1353/pbm.2013.0022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
Prior to the subsequent social [[consensus]] that led to what is now the ubiquitous adoption of that term, other names were proposed and discussed at a number of locations including the Steady Health forum, the Society of Sensationalists Yahoo! group and the Unnamed Feeling Blog.{{who|date=October 2018}}

Proposed formal names included "auditory induced head orgasm", "attention induced euphoria" and "attention induced observant euphoria", while [[colloquialism|colloquial]] terms in usage included "brain massage", "head tingle", "brain tingle", "spine tingle" and "brain orgasm".&lt;ref&gt;Lively, Daniel (19 April 2012). [http://www.corvallisadvocate.com/2012/that-tingling-feeling-first-international-asmr-day/ 'That tingling feeling: first international ASMR day']. The Corvallis Advocate. Retrieved 20 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.konbini.com/us/lifestyle/asmr-relaxation-trend-interview/|title=What Is ASMR And Can It Really Give You Brain Orgasms?|last=Eustache|first=Louis|date=22 November 2016|website=Konbini United States|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many colloquial and formal terms used and proposed between 2007 and 2010 included reference to [[orgasm]], there was during that time a significant majority objection to its use among those active in online discussions, many of whom have continued to persist in differentiating the euphoric and relaxing nature of ASMR from [[sexual arousal]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} However, by 2015, a division had occurred within the ASMR community over the subject of sexual arousal, with some creating videos categorized as ASMRotica (ASMR [[erotica]]), which are deliberately designed to be sexually stimulating.&lt;ref name="broadly.vice.com"&gt;Lindsay, Kathryn (15 August 2015). [https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/inside-the-sensual-world-of-asmrotica 'Inside the Sensual World of ASMRotica']. [[Vice (magazine)|Broadly (Vice)]]. Retrieved 20 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bronte, Georgia 2015"&gt;Bronte, Georgia (17 December 2015). [https://www.vice.com/read/how-asmr-purists-got-into-a-turf-war-over-porn 'How ASMR purists got into a turf war over porn']. [[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]. Retrieved 20 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial consensus among the ASMR community was that the name should not pose a high risk of the phenomenon being perceived as sexual. Given that consensus, Jennifer Allen proposed "autonomous sensory meridian response". Allen chose the words intending or assuming them to have the following specific meanings:
* Autonomous – spontaneous, self-governing, with or without control 
* Sensory – pertaining to the senses or sensation
* Meridian – signifying a peak, climax, or point of highest development
* Response – referring to an experience triggered by something external or internal
Allen verified in a 2016 interview that she purposely selected these terms because they were more objective, comfortable, and clinical than alternative terms for the sensation.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Jennifer (17 May 2016). [https://asmruniversity.com/2016/05/17/jennifer-allen-interview-coined-asmr/ 'Interview with Jennifer Allen, the woman who coined the term, 'Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response’ (ASMR)'] ASMR University Website. Retrieved 19 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  Allen explained she selected the word meridian to replace the word orgasm due to its meaning of point or period of greatest prosperity.{{clarify|reason=Is this really the definition of the word meridian?|date=April 2018}} {{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The term "autonomous sensory meridian response" and its [[acronym]] ASMR were adopted by both the community of contributors to online discussions and those reporting and commentating on the phenomenon.

The [[Subjectivity|subjective]] [[experience]], [[Sensory system|sensation]], and [[Perception|perceptual phenomenon]] now widely identified by the term 'autonomous sensory meridian response' is described by some of those susceptible to it as 'akin to a mild electrical current...or the carbonated bubbles in a glass of champagne'.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ahuja | first1 = Nitin | year = 2013 | title = 'It Feels Good to Be Measured: clinical role-play, Walker Percy, and the tingles' | url = | journal = [[Perspectives in Biology and Medicine]] | volume = 56 | issue = 3| pages = 442–451 | doi = 10.1353/pbm.2013.0022 | pmid=24375123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Triggers===
{{Original research|list paragraph|date=November 2018}}
ASMR is usually precipitated by [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] referred to as 'triggers'.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt; ASMR triggers, which are most commonly auditory and visual, may be encountered through the [[Interpersonal relationship|interpersonal]] interactions of daily life. Additionally, ASMR is often triggered by exposure to specific audio and video. Such media may be specially made with the specific purpose of triggering ASMR or originally created for other purposes and later discovered to be effective as a trigger of the experience.&lt;ref name="PMID25834771"/&gt;

[[Stimulus (physiology)|Stimuli]] that can trigger ASMR, as reported by those who experience it, include the following:
* Listening to a softly spoken or whispering voice.
* Listening to quiet, repetitive sounds resulting from someone engaging in a mundane task such as turning the pages of a book.
* Watching somebody attentively execute a mundane task such as preparing food.
* Loudly chewing, crunching, slurping or biting foods, drinks, or gum.
* Receiving altruistic tender personal attention.
* Initiating the stimulus through conscious manipulation without the need for external video or audio triggers.
* Listening to a person explain a concept, describe an object or system.

Watching and listening to an audiovisual recording of a person performing or simulating the above actions and producing their consequent and accompanying sounds is sufficient to trigger ASMR for the majority of those who report susceptibility to the experience.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

====Whispering triggers====

Psychologists Nick Davis and Emma Barratt discovered that whispering was an effective trigger for 75% of the 475 subjects who took part in an experiment to investigate the nature of ASMR,&lt;ref name="PMID25834771"/&gt; and that statistic is reflected in the popularity of intentional ASMR videos that comprise someone speaking in a whispered voice.&lt;ref name="Intimate with strangers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ASMR videos - soothing or creepy?"/&gt;&lt;ref name="I have ASMR, do you?"/&gt;

====Auditory triggers====
Many of those who experience ASMR report that some specific non-vocal [[ambient noise]]s are also effective triggers of ASMR, including those like the sound of rain, fingers scratching or tapping a surface, the crushing of eggshells, the crinkling and crumpling of a flexible material such as paper, or writing. Many [[YouTube]] videos that are intended to trigger ASMR responses capture a single person performing these actions and the sounds that result.&lt;ref name="Why music gives you the chills"/&gt;

====Personal attention role play triggers====

In addition to the effectiveness of specific auditory stimuli, many subjects report that ASMR is triggered by the receipt of tender personal attention, often comprising combined physical touch and vocal expression, such as when having their hair cut, nails painted, [[mimikaki|ears cleaned]], or back massaged, whilst the service provider speaks quietly to the recipient.  Furthermore, many of those who have experienced ASMR during these and other comparable encounters with a service provider report that watching an "ASMRtist" simulate the provision of such personal attention, acting directly to the camera as if the viewer were the recipient of a simulated service, is sufficient to trigger it.&lt;ref name="PMID24375123"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cox, Carolyn (2 September 2014). [http://www.themarysue.com/what-the-hell-is-asmr/ 'Brain Orgasms, Spidey Sense, and Bob Ross: A Look Inside The World Of ASMR']. [[Dan Abrams|The Mary Sue]]. Retrieved 20 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologists Nick Davis and Emma Barratt discovered that personal attention was an effective trigger for 69% of the 475 subjects who participated in a study conducted at [[Swansea University]], second in popularity only to whispering.&lt;ref name="PMID25834771"/&gt;

Some roleplays also incorporate fantasy or science fiction elements in a way that allows "escape" for the viewers. Some also incorporate legitimate stories into the roleplays in a way that could be considered entertainment in its own right, outside of the ASMR phenomenon.

====Clinical role play triggers====

Among the category of intentional ASMR videos that simulate the provision of personal attention is a subcategory of those specifically depicting the "ASMRtist" providing clinical or medical services, including routine general medical examinations. The creators of these videos make no claims to the reality of what is depicted, and the viewer is intended to be aware that they are watching and listening to a simulation, performed by an actor. Nonetheless, many subjects attribute therapeutic outcomes to these and other categories of intentional ASMR videos, and there are voluminous anecdotal reports of their effectiveness in inducing sleep for those susceptible to [[insomnia]], and assuaging a range of symptoms including those associated with [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[anxiety]], and [[panic attack]]s.&lt;ref name="vice.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="well.blogs.nytimes.com"&gt;Fairyington, Stephanie (28 July 2014).

[http://issuu.com/24magazine/docs/24mag_issue04 'Intimate with strangers']. #24MAG, Issue 4, pp60–61.Retrieved 20 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first peer-reviewed article on ASMR, published in ''Perspectives in Biology'' in summer 2013, Nitin Ahuja, who was at the time of publication a medical resident at the [[University of Virginia]], invited conjecture on whether the receipt of simulated medical attention might have some tangible therapeutic value for the recipient, comparing the purported positive outcome of clinical role play ASMR videos with the themes of the novel ''[[Love in the Ruins]]'' by author and physician [[Walker Percy]], published in 1971.&lt;ref name="PMID24375123"/&gt;

The story follows Tom More, a psychiatrist living in a dystopian future who develops a device called the Ontological Lapsometer that, when traced across the scalp of a patient, detects the neurochemical correlation to a range of disturbances. In the course of the novel, More admits that the 'mere application of his device' to a patient's body 'results in the partial relief of his symptoms'.&lt;ref&gt;Percy, Walker (2011). [https://books.google.com/books?id=NqNpSRe1NSwC&amp;dq=love+in+the+ruins 'Love in the ruins: The adventures of a bad Catholic at a time near the end of the world']. Open Road Media; {{ISBN|9781453216200}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahuja alleges that through the character of Tom More, as depicted in ''Love in the Ruins'', Percy 'displays an intuitive understanding of the diagnostic act as a form of therapy unto itself'. Ahuja asks whether similarly, the receipt of simulated personal clinical attention by an actor in an ASMR video might afford the listener and viewer some relief.&lt;ref name="Ahuja, Nitin 2013 pp442-451"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ahuja | first1 = Nitin | year = 2013 | title = 'It feels good to be measured: clinical role-play, Walker Percy, and the tingles' | url = | journal = [[Perspectives in Biology and Medicine]] | volume = 56 | issue = 3| pages = 442–51 | doi = 10.1353/pbm.2013.0022 | pmid = 24375123 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and history==

===Contemporary history===
The contemporary history of ASMR began on 19 October 2007 when a 21-year-old registered user of a discussion forum for health-related subjects at a website called 'Steady Health',&lt;ref&gt;LifeForm Inc. (4 June 2014). [http://www.steadyhealth.com/polices/aboutus 'About' the Steady Health Website]. LifeForm Inc. Retrieved 20 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; with the username 'okaywhatever', submitted a post in which they described having experienced a specific sensation since childhood, comparable to that stimulated by tracing fingers along the skin, yet often triggered by seemingly random and unrelated [[Haptic communication|non-haptic]] events, such as 'watching a puppet show' or 'being read a story'.&lt;ref name="Steady Health"&gt;[http://www.steadyhealth.com Steady Health] (19 October 2007).

Retrieved 20 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Replies to this post, which indicated that a significant number of others experienced the sensation to which 'okaywhatever' referred, also in response to witnessing mundane events, precipitated the formation of a number of web-based locations intended to facilitate further discussion and analysis of the phenomenon for which there was plentiful [[anecdotal account]]s,&lt;ref name="Intimate with strangers"&gt;Manduley, Aida (February 2013).

===Earlier history===
[[File:Virginia Woolf 1927.jpg|thumb|upright|Virginia Woolf's novel ''Mrs. Dalloway'' contains a passage describing something that may be comparable to ASMR.]]

[[Austria]]n writer [[Clemens J. Setz]] suggests that a passage from the [[novel]] ''[[Mrs. Dalloway]]'' authored by [[Virginia Woolf]] and published in 1925, describes something distinctly comparable.&lt;ref&gt;Setz, Clemens (6 April 2015). [http://www.sueddeutsche.de/kultur/gastbeitrag-das-namenlose-gefuehl-1.2423469 'High durch sich räuspernde Menschen']. [[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]. Retrieved 20 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maslen, Hannah and Roache, Rebecca (30 July 2015). [http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2015/07/asmr-and-absurdity/ 'ASMR and absurdity']. Practical Ethics. [[Oxford University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; In the passage from ''Mrs. Dalloway'' cited by Setz, a nursemaid speaks to the man who is her patient 'deeply, softly, like a mellow organ, but with a roughness in her voice like a grasshopper's, which rasped his spine deliciously and sent running up into his brain waves of sound'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Virginia Woolf|Woolf, Virginia]] (2007) [1925]. "Mrs. Dalloway". ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=SsaVkD_4DpkC&amp;pg=PA141 The Selected Works]''; {{ISBN|978-1-84022-558-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Setz, this citation generally alludes to the effectiveness of the [[human voice]] and soft or whispered vocal sounds specifically as a trigger of ASMR for many of those who experience it, as demonstrated by the responsive comments posted to [[YouTube]] videos that depict someone speaking softly or whispering, typically directly to camera.&lt;ref name="Intimate with strangers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ASMR videos - soothing or creepy?"&gt;[[The Young Turks]] (17 February 2013).

===Evolutionary history===
{{stack|[[File:Grooming monkeys PLW edit.jpg|thumb|Animal grooming has often been interpreted as a form of bonding.]]}}
Nothing can currently be definitively known about any evolutionary origins for ASMR since the perceptual phenomenon itself has yet to be clearly identified as having biological correlations. Even so, a significant majority of descriptions of ASMR by those who experience it compare the sensation to that precipitated by receipt of tender physical touch, providing examples such as having their hair cut or combed. This has led to the conjecture that ASMR might be related to the act of grooming.&lt;ref name="978-1615648184"&gt;Young, Julie, and Blansert, Ilse (2015). Idiot's Guides: ASMR.  Idiot's Guides: ASMR. Penguin. {{ISBN|978-1615648184}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, [[David Huron]], Professor in the School of Music at [[Ohio State University]], states: &lt;blockquote&gt;"[The 'ASMR effect' is] clearly strongly related to the perception of non-threat and altruistic attention [and has a] strong similarity to physical grooming in primates [who] derive enormous pleasure (bordering on euphoria) when being groomed by a grooming partner...not to get clean, but rather to bond with each other."&lt;ref name="Why music gives you the chills"&gt;Collins, Sean T. (2012-09-10). 'Why music gives you the chills'. [[BuzzFeed]], 10 September 2012. Retrieved on 2016-01-20 from https://www.buzzfeed.com/theseantcollins/why-music-gives-you-the-chills-7ahd&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Imaging subjects' brains with [[functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] as they reported experiencing ASMR tingles suggests support for this hypothesis, because brain areas such as the [[medial prefrontal cortex]] (associated with social behaviors including grooming), and the [[secondary somatosensory cortex]] (associated with sensation of touch) were activated more strongly during tingle periods than control periods.&lt;ref name="BioImpacts 2018-09-23" /&gt;

==Categories==
While little scientific research has been conducted into potential neurobiological correlates to the perceptual phenomenon known as 'autonomous sensory meridian response' (ASMR), with a consequent dearth of data with which to either explain or refute its physical nature, there is voluminous [[anecdotal account|anecdotal]] literature comprising personal commentary and intimate disclosure of subjective experiences distributed across forums, blogs, and YouTube comments by hundreds of thousands of people. Within this literature, in addition to the original consensus that ASMR is euphoric but non-sexual in nature, a further point of continued majority agreement within the community of those who experience it is that they fall into two broad categories of subjects.

One category depends upon external triggers in order to experience the localized sensation and its associated feelings, which typically originates in the head, often reaching down the neck and sometimes the upper back. The other category can intentionally augment the sensation and feelings through [[attentional control]], without dependence upon external stimuli, or 'triggers', in a manner compared by some subjects to their experience of [[meditation]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==Media==

===Videos===
[[File:Short ASMR - 시원한 탄산주스 솨악~ drinking a nice cold soda.webm|thumb|An ASMR video]]
The most popular source of stimuli reported by subjects to be effective in triggering ASMR is video. Videos reported being effective in triggering ASMR fall into two categories, identified and named by the community as 'Intentional' and 'Unintentional'. Intentional media is created by those known within the community as 'ASMRtists' with the purpose of triggering ASMR in viewers and listeners. Unintentional media is that made for other purposes, often before attention was drawn to the phenomenon in 2007, but which some subjects discover to be effective in triggering ASMR. One early unintentional example is the [[Art Bears]] song 'The Bath of Stars.' Another example of unintentional media several journalists have noted is of famed painter [[Bob Ross]]. In episodes of his popular television series ''[[The Joy of Painting]]'' both broadcast and on YouTube, his soft, gentle, altruistic speaking mannerisms and the sound of him painting and his tools trigger the effect on many of his viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2014/10/10/soothing-sounds-bob-ross-274466.html |title=The Soothing Sounds of Bob Ross |website=Newsweek.com |accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/nickmessitte/2015/03/31/is-there-any-money-to-be-made-in-asmr/#770fee36ee62|title=Is There Any Money To Be Made In ASMR?|publisher=Forbes.com|accessdate=24 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The work of stop-motion filmmaker [[PES (director)|PES]] is also often noted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://creators.vice.com/en_uk/article/kbn84x/5-stop-motion-meditations-from-pes-reddit-ama|title=5 Stop-Motion Meditations From PES's Reddit AMA|website=Creators}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Binaural recording===
{{main|Binaural recording}}
[[File:Examen des oreilles - Role Play ear exam - Binaural ASMR FR.webm|thumb|A binaural roleplay ASMR video from YouTube]]
Some ASMR video creators use [[binaural recording]] techniques to simulate the acoustics of a [[three-dimensional space|three-dimensional environment]], reported to elicit in viewers and listeners the experience of being in close proximity to actor and vocalist.&lt;ref name="theverge.com"&gt;Lalwani, Mona (12 February 2015). [https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/12/8021733/3d-audio-3dio-binaural-immersive-vr-sound-times-square-new-york ' Surrounded by sound: how 3D audio hacks your brain. A century-old audio technology is making a comeback thanks to VR'], theverge.com, 12 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Binaural recordings are made usually made using two microphones, just like stereo recordings. However, in binaural recordings the two microphones tend to be more specially designed to mimic ears on humans. In many cases, microphones are separated the same distance as ears are on humans, and microphones are surrounded by ear shaped cups to get similar reverb as human ears.

Viewing and hearing such ASMR videos that comprise ambient sound captured through [[binaural recording]] has been compared to the reported effect of listening to [[binaural beats]], which are also alleged to precipitate pleasurable sensations and the subjective experience of calm and equanimity.&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez, Patricia (28 November 2012).[http://kotaku.com/5963533/this-drug-is-legal-its-digital-and-its-supposed-to-improve-how-you-game-i-put-it-to-the-test 'This drug is legal. it's digital. and it's supposed to improve how you game. I put it to the test']. [http://kotaku.com Kotaku Website]; retrieved 20 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Binaural recordings are made specifically to be heard through headphones rather than loudspeakers. When listening to sound through loudspeakers, the left and right ear can both hear the sound coming from both speakers. By distinction, when listening to sound through headphones, the sound from the left earpiece is audible only to the left ear, and the sound from the right ear piece is audible only to the right ear. When producing binaural media, the sound source is recorded by two separate microphones, placed at a distance comparable to that between two ears, and they are not mixed, but remain separate on the final medium, whether video or audio.&lt;ref&gt;Binaural.com (April 1998) [http://www.binaural.com/binfaq.html 'Binaural for beginners']. [http://Binaural.com Binaural.com]. Retrieved 20 January 2016. [[The Verge]]; retrieved 20 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Listening to a binaural recording through headphones simulates the [[binaural hearing]] by which people listen to live sounds. For the listener, this experience is characterised by two perceptions. Firstly, the listener perceives being in close proximity to the performers and location of the sound source. Secondly, the listener perceives what is often reported as a three dimensional sound.&lt;ref name="theverge.com"/&gt; This means the listener can perceive both the position and distance of the source of sound relative to them.

==Academic commentary==

===Peer-reviewed articles===
Several [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] articles about ASMR have been published.

The first, by the physician Nitin Ahuja, is titled "It Feels Good to Be Measured: clinical role-play, Walker Percy, and the tingles". It was published in ''[[Perspectives in Biology and Medicine]]'' during 2013 and focused on a conjectural cultural and literary analysis.&lt;ref name="Ahuja, Nitin 2013 pp442-451"/&gt;

Another article, published in the journal ''Television and New Media'' in November 2014, is by Joceline Andersen, a doctoral student in the Department of Art History and Communication Studies at [[McGill University]],&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, Joceline (1 December 2015). [https://www.mcgill.ca/ahcs/people/phd-students/joceline-andersen Joceline Andersen's Profile at McGill University]. Retrieved 20 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; who suggested that ASMR videos comprising whispering 'create an intimate sonic space shared by the listener and the whisperer'. Andersen's article proposes that the pleasure jointly shared by both an ASMR video creator and its viewers might be perceived as a particular form of 'non-standard intimacy' by which consumers pursue a form of pleasure mediated by video media. Andersen suggests that such pursuit is private yet also public or publicized through the sharing of experiences via online communication with others within the 'whispering community'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1177/1527476414556184 | volume=16 | title=Now You’ve Got the Shiveries | year=2014 | journal=Television &amp; New Media | pages=683–700 | last1 = Andersen | first1 = Joceline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another article, "Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR): a flow-like mental state", by Nick Davis and Emma Barratt, lecturer and post-graduate researcher respectively in the Department of Psychology at [[Swansea University]], was published in [[PeerJ]]. This article aimed to 'describe the sensations associated with ASMR, explore the ways in which it is typically induced in capable individuals ... to provide further thoughts on where this sensation may fit into current knowledge on atypical perceptual experiences ... and to explore the extent to which engagement with ASMR may ease symptoms of depression and chronic pain'&lt;ref name="PMID25834771" /&gt; The paper was based on a study of 245 men, 222 women, and 8 individuals of non-binary gender, aged from 18 to 54 years, all of whom had experienced ASMR, and regularly consumed ASMR media, from which the authors concluded and suggested that 'given the reported benefits of ASMR in improving mood and pain symptoms...ASMR warrants further investigation as a potential therapeutic measure similar to that of meditation and mindfulness.'

An article titled "An examination of the default mode network in individuals with autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR)"&lt;ref name="Social Neuroscience 2015-08-14"&gt;{{cite journal |title=An examination of the default mode network in individuals with autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) |journal=Social Neuroscience |date=14 August 2015 |last=Smith |first=Stephen |last2=Fredborg |first2=Beverley Katherine |last3=Kornelsen|first3=Jennifer|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17470919.2016.1188851 |accessdate=13 August 2016 |quote=In the current study, the default mode network (DMN) of 11 individuals with ASMR was contrasted to that of 11 matched controls. |doi=10.1080/17470919.2016.1188851 |pages=1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Stephen D. Smith, Beverley Katherine Fredborg, and Jennifer Kornelsen, looked at the [[default mode network]] (DMN) in individuals with ASMR. The study, which used [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), concluded that there were significant differences in the DMN of individuals who have ASMR as compared to a control group without ASMR.

The first study to perform actual brain imaging (fMRI) on subjects currently experiencing ASMR tingles (as opposed to individuals who were merely able to experience the phenomenon) was published in ''[[BioImpacts]]'' in September 2018.&lt;ref name="BioImpacts 2018-09-23"&gt;{{cite journal |title=An fMRI investigation of the neural correlates underlying the autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) |journal=BioImpacts |date=2018-09-23 |last=Lochte |first=Bryson |url=http://bi.tbzmed.ac.ir/Abstract/bi-17613 |accessdate=2018-10-04 |doi=10.15171/bi.2018.32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subjects viewed several ASMR videos with a screen and headphones while inside the MRI scanner. The study found a significant difference in brain activation between time periods when the subject reported tingling (communicated by pressing a button), as compared to time periods when they were watching a video but not reporting tingling (communicated by pressing a different button, to control for brain activation effects caused by merely pressing a button). They concluded that "the brain regions found most active during the tingling sensations were the [[nucleus accumbens]], [[prefrontal cortex|mPFC]], [[insular cortex|insula]] and [[secondary somatosensory cortex]]", and suggested that these were similar to "activation of brain regions previously observed during experiences like social bonding and musical [[frisson]]".

==Scientific commentary==
A number of scientists have published or made public their reaction to and opinions of ASMR.

On 12 March 2012, [[Steven Novella]], Director of General Neurology at the [[Yale School of Medicine]], published a post about ASMR on his blog ''Neurologica''. Regarding the question of whether ASMR is a real phenomeonon, Novella said "in this case, I don't think there is a definitive answer, but I am inclined to believe that it is. There are a number of people who seem to have independently experienced and described" it with "fairly specific details. In this way it's similar to migraine headaches – we know they exist as a syndrome primarily because many different people report the same constellation of symptoms and natural history." Novella tentatively posited the possibilities that ASMR might be either a type of pleasurable seizure, or another way to activate the "pleasure response". However, Novella drew attention to the lack of scientific investigation into ASMR, suggesting that [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) and [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] technologies should be used to study the brains of people who experience ASMR in comparison to people who do not, as a way of beginning to seek scientific understanding and explanation of the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven Novella|Novella, Steven]] (12 March 2012).

Four months after Novella's blog post, Tom Stafford, a lecturer in [[psychology]] and cognitive sciences at the [[University of Sheffield]], was reported to have said that ASMR "might well be a real thing, but it's inherently difficult to research...something like this that you can't see or feel" and "doesn't happen for everyone". Stafford compared the current status of ASMR with development of attitudes toward [[synesthesia]], which he said "for years...was a myth, then in the 1990s people came up with a reliable way of measuring it".&lt;ref&gt;Marsden, Rhodri (21 July 2012).

==Comparisons and associations with other phenomena==

===Comparison with synesthesia===
{{main|Synesthesia}}
Integral to the subjective experience of ASMR is a localized tingling sensation that many describe as similar to being gently touched, but which is stimulated by watching and listening to video media in the absence of any physical contact with another person.

These reports have precipitated comparison between ASMR and synesthesia – a condition characterised by the excitation of one sensory modality by stimuli that normally exclusively stimulates another, as when the hearing of a specific sound induces the visualization of a distinct color, a type of synesthesia called [[chromesthesia]]. Thereby, people with other types of synesthesia report for example 'seeing sounds' in the case of auditory-visual synesthesia, or 'tasting words' in the case of lexical-gustatory synesthesia.&lt;ref&gt;Cytowic, Richard E.

In the case of ASMR, many report the perception of 'being touched' by the sights and sounds presented on a video recording, comparable to visual-tactile and auditory-tactile synesthesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Naumer MJ, van den Bosch JJ |title=Touching sounds: thalamocortical plasticity and the neural basis of multisensory integration |journal=J. Neurophysiol. |volume=102 |issue=1 |pages=7–8 |date=July 2009 |pmid= 19403745 |doi=10.1152/jn.00209.2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison with misophonia===

{{main|Misophonia}}
Some commentators and members of the ASMR community have sought to relate ASMR to [[misophonia]], which literally means the 'hatred of sound', but manifests typically as 'automatic negative emotional reactions to particular sounds – the opposite of what can be observed in reactions to specific audio stimuli in ASMR'.&lt;ref name="PMID25834771"/&gt;

For example, those who suffer from misophonia often report that specific human sounds, including those made by breathing or whispering with any loudness can precipitate feelings of anger and disgust, in the absence of any previously learned associations that might otherwise explain those reactions.&lt;ref name="Schröder2013"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors = Schröder A, Vulink N, Denys D|editor=Fontenelle L |title=Misophonia: Diagnostic Criteria for a New Psychiatric Disorder|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=8|issue=1|year=2013|pages=e54706|issn=1932-6203|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0054706|pmid=23372758|pmc=3553052}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are plentiful anecdotal reports by those who claim to have both misophonia and ASMR at multiple web-based user-interaction and discussion locations. Common to these reports is the experience of ASMR to some sounds, and misophonia in response to others.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pennsylvania State University]] (2015). [https://sites.psu.edu/siowfa15/2015/09/16/asmr-and-misophonia-sounds-crazy/ 'ASMR and Misophonia: Sounds-Crazy!  Science in our world: certainty and controversy'].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Higa, Kerin (11 June 2015).

Retrieved 20 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison with frisson===
{{main|Frisson}}
The tingling sensation that characterises ASMR has been compared and contrasted to 'frisson', which is a French word for 'shiver'.&lt;ref name="nme.com"&gt;Jones, Lucy (12 September 2012). [http://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/which-moments-in-songs-give-you-chills 'Which moments in songs give you chills?'] [[NME|New Musical Express]]. Retrieved 20 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the English word 'shiver' signifies the rhythmic involuntary contraction of skeletal muscles which serves the function of generating heat in response to low temperatures, has variable duration, and is often reported subjectively as unpleasant. By distinction, the French word 'frisson', signifies a brief sensation usually reported as pleasurable and often expressed as an overwhelming emotional response to stimuli, such as a piece of music. Frisson often occurs simultaneously with [[piloerection]], colloquially known as 'goosebumps', by which tiny muscles called [[Arrector pili muscle|arrector pili]] contract, causing body hair, particularly that on the limbs and back of the neck, to erect or 'stand on end'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/frisson Define Frisson at Dictionary.com].

Few legitimate studies have been done on ASMR, and even fewer have discussed the link between it and frisson specifically. At this time{{when|date=October 2018}}, much of the data on ASMR comes from primarily anecdotal sources.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} Although ASMR and frisson are "interrelated in that they appear to arise through similar physiological mechanisms", individuals who have experienced both describe them as qualitatively different, with different kinds of triggers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) and frisson: Mindfully induced sensory phenomena that promote happiness|journal=International Journal of School &amp; Educational Psychology|date=2016-02-26|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21683603.2016.1130582|last=del Campo|first=Marisa}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2018 [[functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] study showed that the major brain regions already known to be activated in frisson are also activated in ASMR,&lt;ref name="BioImpacts 2018-09-23" /&gt; and suggests that "the similar pattern of activation of both ASMR and frisson could explain their subjective similarities, such as their short duration and tingling sensation".

===Association with sexuality===
There have been persistent efforts by many of those who form the 'ASMR community' to distinguish the euphoric sensation that characterizes ASMR from sexual arousal, and to differentiate video media created with intent to trigger it from pornography.&lt;ref name="mashable.com"&gt;[[Mashable]] (26 January 2015) [http://mashable.com/2015/01/26/asmr-youtube/#cPx9p.mAOkqw 'All the feels.

Retrieved 20 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, some journalists and commentators have drawn attention to the way in which many videos made as triggers are susceptible to being perceived as sexually provocative in a number of ways. Firstly, the use of objects as acoustic instruments and points of visual focus, accompanied by a softly spoken voice has been described as fetishistic. Secondly, ASMR's potential appeal is further allegedly sexualized by their use of a whispered vocal expression and gentleness of simulated touch purportedly associated exclusively with intimacy. There are both popular male and female 'ASMRtists'.&lt;ref name="Intimate with strangers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Madrigal,  Alexis C. (28 March 2015).

===Film===
The hair-cutting scene of the film ''[[Battle of the Sexes (2017 film)|Battle of the Sexes]]'' deliberately included several ASMR triggers. Director [[Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris|Jonathan Dayton]] stated "People work to make videos that elicit this response [...] and we were wondering, 'Could we get that response in a theater full of people?'" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/40473459/asmr-comes-to-hollywood-in-battle-of-the-sexes|title=ASMR Comes To Hollywood In "Battle Of The Sexes"|date=2017-09-27|work=Fast Company|access-date=2018-09-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistics==
In addition to the information collected from the 475 subjects who participated in the scientific investigation conducted by Nick Davies and Emma Barratt,&lt;ref name="PMID25834771" /&gt; there have been two attempts to collate statistical data pertaining to the demographics, personal history, clinical conditions, and subjective experience of those who report susceptibility to ASMR.

In December 2012, Craig Richard – a blogger on the subject of ASMR – published the first results of a poll comprising 12 questions that had received 161 respondents, followed by second results in August 2015 by which time there were 477 responses.&lt;ref&gt;Richard, Craig (11 December 2014).

In August 2014, Craig Richard, Jennifer Allen, and Karissa Burnett published a survey at [[SurveyMonkey]] that was reviewed by [[Shenandoah University]] Institutional Review Board, and the [[Fuller Theological Seminary]] School of Psychology Human Studies Review Committee. In September 2015, when the survey had received 13,000 responses, the publishers announced that they were analyzing the data with the intent to publish the results. No such publication or report is yet available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=ASMR Report |date=December 2015 |url=http://asmrr.org/asmr-surveys-polls |title=ASMR Surveys and Polls |accessdate=20 January 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161015173025/http://asmrr.org/asmr-surveys-polls |archivedate=15 October 2016 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard, Craig and Allen, Jennifer and Burnett, Karissa, (August 2014).

In 2018, an fMRI scan experiment journal was written in by Bryson C. Lochte, Sean A. Guillory, Craig A. H. Richard, William M. Kelley. In short, the subjects that experienced ASMR showed a significant increase in activity in the regions of the brain associated with reward and emotional arousal.&lt;ref&gt;https://bi.tbzmed.ac.ir/Abstract/bi-17613&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Benthos''' is the [[community (ecology)|community]] of [[organism]]s that live on, in, or near the [[seabed]], also known as the [[benthic zone]].&lt;ref name="caml"&gt;[http://www.caml.aq/benthos/index.html Benthos] from the Census of Antarctic Marine Life website&lt;/ref&gt; This community lives in or near marine [[depositional environment|sedimentary environments]], from [[tidal pool]]s along the [[intertidal zone|foreshore]], out to the [[continental shelf]], and then down to the [[abyssal zone|abyssal depths]].

Many organisms adapted to deep-water pressure cannot survive in the upper parts of the [[water column]]. The pressure difference can be very significant (approximately one [[atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]] for each 10 metres of water depth).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.aes.bioflux.com.ro/docs/2016.71-82.pdf|title = Physico-chemical parameters and macrobenthic invertebrates of the intertidal zone of Gusa, Cagayan de Oro City, Philippines|last = Walag|first = Angelo Mark |author2=Mae Oljae P. Canencia |year = 2016|journal = Advances in Environmental Sciences|doi = |pmid = |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=71–82 |access-date = October 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=April 2016}}&lt;ref name="noaa"&gt;https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/pressure.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Because light is [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorbed]] before it can reach deep ocean-water, the energy source for deep benthic ecosystems is often organic matter from higher up in the water column that drifts down to the depths. This [[detritus|dead and decaying matter]] sustains the benthic [[food chain]]; most organisms in the benthic zone are [[scavengers]] or [[detritivores]].

The term ''benthos'', coined by [[Haeckel]] in 1891,&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|de|Haeckel, E. 1891. Plankton-Studien. Jenaische Zeitschrift für Naturwissenschaft 25 / (Neue Folge)}} 18: 232-336. [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/11963729 BHL].&lt;/ref&gt; comes from the [[English words of Greek origin|Greek]] noun {{lang|grc|βένθος}} "depth of the sea".&lt;ref name="caml" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|be/nqos|βένθος|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Benthos'' is also used in [[freshwater Biology|freshwater biology]] to refer to organisms at the bottom of freshwater [[body of water|bodies of water]], such as lakes, rivers, and streams.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.benthos.org/AboutNABS/Whatisbenthos.htm North American Benthological Society website]&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a redundant synonym, ''benthon''.&lt;ref&gt;Nehring, S. &amp; Albrecht, U. (1997). ''Benthos und das redundante Benthon: Neologismen in der deutschsprachigen Limnologie''. ''Lauterbornia'' 31: 17-30, [http://www.zobodat.at/pdf/Lauterbornia_1997_31_0017-0030.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Food sources==
[[Image:Scheme eutrophication-en.svg|thumb|right|Effect of [[eutrophication]] on marine benthic life]]
The main food sources for the benthos are [[algae]] and organic runoff from land. The depth of water, temperature and salinity, and type of local substrate all affect what benthos is present. In coastal waters and other places where light reaches the bottom, benthic [[photosynthesis|photosynthesizing]] [[diatoms]] can proliferate. [[Filter feeder]]s, such as [[sponge]]s and [[bivalve]]s, dominate hard, sandy bottoms. Deposit feeders, such as [[polychaete]]s, populate softer bottoms. Fish, such as [[dragonets]], as well as [[sea star]]s, [[snail]]s, [[cephalopod]]s, and [[crustacean]]s are important predators and scavengers.

Benthic organisms, such as [[sea star]]s, [[oyster]]s, [[clam]]s, [[Holothuroidea|sea cucumber]]s, [[brittle star]]s and [[sea anemone]]s, play an important role as a food source for [[fish]], such as the [[California sheephead]], and [[human]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7216">'''CRAM''' is a compressed columnar file format for storing [[Sequence alignment|biological sequences aligned]] to a [[RefSeq|reference sequence]], initially devised by Markus Hsi-Yang Fritz ''et al''.&lt;ref name=Fritz2011&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hsi-Yang Fritz|first=Markus|last2=Leinonen|first2=Rasko|last3=Cochrane|first3=Guy|last4=Birney|first4=Ewan|date=May 2011|title=Efficient storage of high throughput DNA sequencing data using reference-based compression|url=|journal=Genome Research|volume=21|issue=5|pages=734–740|doi=10.1101/gr.114819.110|issn=1549-5469|pmc=3083090|pmid=21245279|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CRAM was designed to be an efficient reference-based alternative to the [[SAM (file format)|Sequence Alignment Map]] (SAM) and [[Binary Alignment Map]] (BAM) file formats.  It optionally uses a genomic reference to describe differences between the aligned sequence fragments and the reference sequence, reducing storage costs.  Additionally each column in the SAM format is separated into its own blocks, improving compression ratio.  CRAM files typically vary from 30 to 60% smaller than BAM, depending on the data held within them.

== File Format ==
The basic structure of a CRAM file is a series of containers, the first of which holds a compressed copy of the SAM header.  Subsequent containers consist of a container Compression Header followed by a series of slices which in turn hold the alignment records themselves, formatted as a series of blocks.

CRAM file:
:{| class="wikitable" border="1" style='text-align: center;
|-
| Magic number || Container&lt;br/&gt;(SAM header) || Container&lt;br/&gt;(Data) || ... || Container&lt;br&gt;(Data) || Container&lt;br/&gt;(EOF)
|}

Container:
:{| class="wikitable" border="1" style='text-align: center;
|-
| Container&lt;br/&gt;Header || Compression&lt;br/&gt;Header || Slice || ... || Slice
|}

Slice:
:{| class="wikitable" border="1" style='text-align: center;
|-
| Slice&lt;br/&gt;Header || Block || Block || ... || Block
|}

CRAM constructs records from a set of data series, describing the components of an alignment.  The container Compression Header specifies which data series is encoded in which block, what codec will be used, and any codec specific meta-data (for example a table of [[Huffman_coding|Huffman]] symbol code lengths).  While data series can be mixed together within the same block, keeping them separate usually improves compression and provides the opportunity for efficient selective decoding where only some data types are required.

Selective access to a CRAM file is granted via the index (with file-name suffix ".crai").  On chromosome and position sorted data this indicates which region is covered by each slice.  On unsorted data the index may be used to simply fetch the N&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; container.  Selective decoding may also be achieved using the Compression Header to skip specified data series if partial records are required.

'''''Capite censi''''' were literally, in [[Latin language|Latin]], "those counted by head" in the [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] [[census]]. Also known as "the head count", the term was used to refer to the lowest class of citizens, people not of the [[nobility]] or [[middle class]]es, owning little or no property; thus they were counted by the head rather than by their property.&lt;ref name="EncBrit1854"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The Encyclopædia Britannica, or Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, and General Literature: Bur - Clim |volume=6

Later though, the ''proletarii'' were distinguished from the ''capite censi'' as having "appreciable property" to the value of 11,000 [[As (coin)|ass]]es or less. In contrast, the ''capite censi'' are assumed to have not owned any property of significance.&lt;ref name="Liddell"/&gt;

[[Gaius Marius]], as part of the [[Marian Reforms]] of 107 BC, allowed these non-land-owning Romans to enlist in the [[Roman legion]]s.&lt;ref name="EncBrit1854"/&gt; For the first time, men no longer had to own property to fight for [[Rome]]. Because these men had no property, they became the clients of their generals and veterans looked to them for land or monies after demobilization. Since the reforms did not include a permanent demobilization method divorced from army commanders, soldiers became closely linked to their generals for the process of rewarding them for service on demobilization (retirement from active service).  The lack of a permanent demobilization process run by the government in Marius' military reform would help facilitate the demise of the [[Roman Republic]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

'''Commuted cash value''' refers to the [[present value]] of an [[Annuity (financial contracts)|annuity]] after annuitization. This differs from typical [[cash value]]; if a ''commuted'' cash value is stipulated in an annuity contract, this allows the owner of the annuity to cash the contract in, even after annuitization.&lt;tt&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://hcopub.dhs.state.mn.us/hcpmstd/19_25_30.htm |title=19.25.30 Annuities |accessdate=2008-05-05 |date=2006-12-01 |work=Health Care Programs Manual |publisher=Minnesota Department of Human Services }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;

'''Connected Mathematics''' is a comprehensive [[mathematics]] program intended for [[Education in the United States|U.S. students in grades 6-8]]. The [[curriculum]] design, text materials for students, and supporting resources for teachers were created and have been progressively refined by the Connected Mathematics Project (CMP) at [[Michigan State University]] with advice and contributions from many mathematics teachers, curriculum developers, mathematicians, and mathematics education researchers.

The current third edition of Connected Mathematics is a major revision of the program to reflect new expectations of the [[Common Core State Standards Initiative|Common Core State Standards]] for Mathematics&lt;ref name="Common Core State Standards Initiative"&gt;[http://www.corestandards.org/assets/CCSSI Math Standards.pdf] [[Common Core State Standards Initiative]] (CCSSI). (2010). Common Core State Standards for Mathematics. Washington, DC: National Governors Association Center for Best Practices and the Council of Chief State School Officers.&lt;/ref&gt; and what the authors have learned from over twenty years of field experience by thousands of teachers working with millions of middle grades students.  This CMP3 program is now published in paper and electronic form by [[Pearson Education]].

== Core Principles ==
The first edition of Connected Mathematics, developed with financial support from the [[National Science Foundation]], was designed to provide instructional materials for middle grades mathematics based on the 1989 ''Curriculum and Evaluation Standards''&lt;ref&gt;National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. (1989). Curriculum and evaluation standards for school mathematics. Reston, VA: National Council of Teachers of Mathematics.&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1991 ''Professional Standards for Teaching Mathematics'' from the [[National Council of Teachers of Mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. (1991). Professional standards for teaching mathematics. Reston, VA: National Council of Teachers of Mathematics.&lt;/ref&gt; These Standards implied four core features of the curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;[[Glenda Lappan|Lappan, G.]], Phillips, E. D., Fey, J. T. (2007). The case of Connected Mathematics. In C. R. Hirsch (Ed.), Perspectives on the design and development of school mathematics curricula (pp. 67-79). Reston, VA: National Council of Teachers of Mathematics&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.educationaldesigner.org/ed/volume1/issue3/|last1=Lappan|first1=G.|last2=Phillips|first2=E.|year=2009|title=A designer speaks: Glenda Lappan and Elizabeth Phillips|journal=Educational Designer, Journal of the [[International Society for Design and Development in Education]]|volume=1|issue=3|pages=1–19}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Comprehensive coverage of mathematical concepts and skills in four content strands—Number, [[Algebra]], [[Geometry]]/Measurement, Probability/[[Statistics]];
*Connections between concepts and methods of the four major content strands and between the abstractions of mathematics and their embodiment in real world problem contexts;
*Instructional materials that make classrooms lively places where students learn by solving problems and sharing their thinking with others and where teachers encourage and support students to wonder, to ask questions, and to enjoy learning and using mathematics;
*Developing student understanding of mathematical concepts, principles, procedures, and habits of mind and the disposition to use mathematical reasoning in making sense of new situations and solving problems.

Those principles have been a consistent guide to development and refinement of the ''Connected Mathematics'' program for over twenty years.  The first edition was published in 1995; a major revision, also supported by National Science Foundation funding, was published in 2006; and the current third edition was published in 2014.  In the third edition, the collection of units was expanded to cover [[Common Core Standards]] for both grade eight and Algebra I.

Each CMP grade level course aims to advance student understanding, skills, and problem solving in every content strand with increasing sophistication and challenge over the middle school grades. The problem tasks for students are designed to make connections within mathematics, between mathematics and other subject areas, and/or to real world settings that appeal to students.

Curriculum units consist of 3 – 5 investigations, each focused on a key mathematical idea; each investigation consists of several major problems that the teacher and students explore in class. Applications/Connections/Extensions problem sets are included for each investigation to help students practice, apply, connect, and extend essential understandings.

While engaged in collaborative problem solving and classroom discourse about mathematics, students are explicitly encouraged to reflect on their use of what the [[NCTM]] standards called mathematics processes and the &lt;ref name="Common Core State Standards Initiative 2"&gt;[http://www.corestandards.org/Math Common Core State Standards]&lt;/ref&gt; now refer to as mathematical practices—making sense of problems and solving them, reasoning abstractly and quantitatively, constructing arguments and critiquing reasoning of others, modeling with mathematics, using mathematical tools strategically, seeking and using structure, expressing regularity in repeated reasoning, and communicating ideas and results with precision.

== Implementation Challenges ==
Introduction of new curriculum content, instructional materials, and teaching methods is challenging in [[K-12 education]].  When the proposed changes represent contrasts to long-standing traditional practice, it is common to hear concerns from parents, teachers, and other professionals, and even from students who have been successful and comfortable in traditional classrooms.  
In recognition of this innovation challenge, the [[National Science Foundation]] complemented its investment in new curriculum materials with substantial investments in professional development for teachers.  By funding State and Urban Systemic Initiatives, Local Systemic Change projects, and Math-Science Partnership programs, as well as National Centers for Standards-based School Mathematics Curriculum Dissemination and Implementation, NSF provided powerful support for adoption and implementation of the various reform mathematics curricula developed during the ''Standards'' era.

In addition to those programs, for nearly twenty years CMP has sponsored summer Getting to Know CMP institutes, workshops for leaders of CMP implementation, and an annual User’s Conference for sharing of implementation experiences and insights, all on the campus of Michigan State University.  The whole reform curriculum effort has greatly enhanced the field’s understanding of what works in that important and challenging process&lt;ref&gt;Heck, D. J., Banilower, E. R., Weiss, I. R., &amp; Rosenberg, S. L. (2008). Studying the effects of professional development: The case of the NSF's local systemic change through teacher enhancement initiative. Journal for Research in Mathematics Education, 39(2), 113-152.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bay, J. M., Reys, B. J., &amp; Reys, R. E. (1999). The top 10 elements that must be in place to implement standards-based mathematics curricula. Phi Delta Kappan, 80(7), 503-506.&lt;/ref&gt;—the clearest message being that significant lasting change takes time, persistent effort, and coordination of work by teachers at all levels in a system.

== Research Findings ==
''Connected Mathematics'' has become the most widely used of middle school curriculum materials developed to implement the NCTM Standards.  Effects of its use have been described in expository journal articles and evaluated in mathematics education research projects.  Many of the research studies are masters or doctoral dissertation research projects focused on specific aspects of the CMP classroom experience and student learning.  But there also have been a number of large-scale independent evaluations of results from use of the program.&lt;ref name="Connected Mathematics, 2nd Edition"&gt;Banilower, E. R. (2010).

Journal for Research in Mathematics Education, 39(3), 247-280.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the large-scale controlled research studies the most common (but by no means universal) pattern of results has been better performance by CMP students on measures of conceptual understanding and problem solving and no significant difference between students of CMP and traditional curriculum materials on measures of routine skills and factual knowledge.  For example, this pattern is what the LieCal&lt;ref name="Connected Mathematics, 2nd Edition"/&gt; project found from a longitudinal study comparing learning by students in CMP and traditional middle grades curricula:

(1) Students did not sacrifice basic mathematical skills if they are taught using a Standards-based or [[reform mathematics]] curriculum like CMP; (2) African American students experienced greater gain in symbol manipulation when they used a traditional curriculum; (3) The use of either the CMP or a non-CMP curriculum improved the mathematics achievement of all students, including students of color; (4) the use of CMP contributed to significantly higher problem-solving growth for all ethnic groups; and (5) A high level of conceptual emphasis in a classroom improved the students’ ability to represent problem situations.

Perhaps the most telling result of all is reported in the 2008 study by James Tarr&lt;ref name="The impact of middle grades mathematics curricula on student achievement and the classroom learning environment"/&gt; and colleagues at the [[University of Missouri]].  While finding no overall significant effects from use of reform or traditional curriculum materials, the study did discover effects favoring the NSF-funded curricula when those programs were implemented with high or even moderate levels of fidelity to Standards-based learning environments.  That is, when the innovative programs are used as designed, they produce positive effects.

== Historical Controversy ==
Like other curricula designed and developed during the 1990s to implement the NCTM Standards, Connected Math was criticized by supporters of more traditional curricula.  Critics made the following claims:
*Reform curricula like CMP pay too little attention to development of [[mathematics|basic computational skills]] in number and algebra;
*Student investigation and discovery of key mathematical concepts and skills might lead to critical gaps and misconceptions in their knowledge;
*Emphasis on mathematics in real world contexts might cause students to miss abstractions and generalizations that are the powerful heart of the subject;
*The lack of explanatory prose in textbooks makes it hard for parents to help their children with homework.
*Small-group learning is less efficient than teacher-led direct instructional methods, and the most able and interested students might be held back by having to collaborate with less able and motivated students.

Reassuring results from a variety of research projects blunted concerns about basic skill mastery, missing knowledge, and student misconceptions resulting from use of CMP and other reform curricula. &lt;ref name="Connected Mathematics, 2nd Edition"/&gt;&lt;ref name="International Journal of Education Research"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The effects of Connected Mathematics Project 2 on student performance"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Effects of Connected Mathematics Project on student attainment"/&gt;&lt;ref name="What Works Clearinghouse Intervention Report"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Impact of curriculum reform"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Standards-based mathematics curricula"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CMP:Research and evaluation summary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Assessing the impact of Standards-based middle school mathematics"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Student attainment in the Connected Mathematics Curriculum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The impact of two standards-based mathematics curricula on student achievement in Massachusetts"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A best-evidence synthesis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The impact of middle grades mathematics curricula on student achievement and the classroom learning environment"/&gt;

Experience with use of CMP and other Standards-based curricula suggests that learning mathematics through investigation of contextualized problems is engaging for middle grades students and it helps them to connect new abstractions with prior knowledge.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1299">'''Cultural framework''' is a term used in [[social science]] to explain [[tradition]]s, [[value system]]s, [[Mythology|myths]] and [[symbol]]s that are common in a given [[society]]. A given society may have multiple cultural frameworks (for example, [[United States]] society has different cultural frameworks for its [[White American|white]] and [[African American]] populations). Usually cultural frameworks are mixed; as certain individuals or entire groups can be familiar with many cultural frameworks.

There is an important relation between cultural frameworks and ideologies, as most successful ideologies are closely connected to cultural frameworks of societies they spread in. Cultural framework should not, however, be confused with [[ideology]], as those concepts are separate. For example, in [[Nazi Germany]], [[Nazism]] was an ideology, while religious beliefs, patriotism and traditions dating back to [[Germanic tribes|Germanic]] and [[Frankish tribes]] were part of the German cultural framework.

[[File:DARPA Challenge RedTeam.jpg|thumb|300px|Red Team Racing's 1986 HMMWV [[Sandstorm (vehicle)|Sandstorm]]]]
Announced in 2002, the first [[DARPA Grand Challenge]] was a [[driverless car]] competition held on March 13, 2004 in the [[Mojave Desert]] region of the [[United States]]. The {{convert|150|mi|km}} route followed [[Interstate 15]] from just before [[Barstow, California]] to just past the [[California]]-[[Nevada]] border in [[Primm, Nevada|Primm]].&lt;ref name="PopSci2004_06"/&gt;
None of the robot vehicles finished the route. The vehicle of [[Carnegie Mellon University]]'s Red Team traveled the farthest distance, completing {{convert|11.78|km|mi|abbr=on}} of the course.&lt;ref name="PopSci2004_06"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN2004_05_06"/&gt;  The $1 million prize remained unclaimed.&lt;ref name="CNN2004_05_06"/&gt;

==Preliminary tests==
Prior to the main event in the [[Mojave Desert]], the twenty-one qualifying teams were required to navigate a mile-long obstacle course at [[California Speedway]].&lt;ref name="CNN2004_05_04"/&gt;  Seven teams were able to successfully complete the entire course, while eight others completed enough of it to satisfy of the judges, resulting in fifteen vehicles in the final race.&lt;ref name="CNN2004_05_04"&gt;"The robots were put through obstacle and speed tests to make sure they would be safe. While only seven teams completed the speedway course, eight others came close enough to convince judges that they could safely compete." {{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/ptech/03/12/darpa.race/index.html|title=15 teams qualify for Mojave robot race|author=Marsha Walton|date=2004-05-04|publisher=[[CNN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The event==
Unfortunately, the failures during the preliminary tests were indicative of how the vehicles would perform on the actual course.  Two of the fifteen vehicles had to be withdrawn before the final race began&lt;ref name="BBC2004_05_15"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/3512270.stm|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=2004-05-15|title=Desert race too tough for robots}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one car flipped upside down in the starting area and had to be withdrawn.&lt;ref name="BBC2004_05_15"/&gt; Three hours into the event that was scheduled to last ten hours, only four vehicles remained operational.  The vehicles suffered from a variety of mechanical problems, including "stuck brakes, broken axles, rollovers, and malfunctioning satellite navigation equipment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=$1 Million Pentagon-Sponsored Robot Race Ends As All Entries Break Down|author=Andrew Bridges ([[Associated Press]])|date=2004-05-13|url=http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/technology/darpa_race_040313.html|publisher=[[Space.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a few hours, all of the vehicles in the challenge had suffered critical vehicle failures, had been disqualified, or had withdrawn. The farthest any of the teams got was the Red Team's {{convert|7.4|mi|km}}, less than 5% off the full length of the course.  Their vehicle, [[Sandstorm (vehicle)|Sandstorm]], went off-course in a hairpin turn and got stuck on the embankment.&lt;ref name="PopSci2004_06"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2004-06/darpa-grand-challenge-2004darpas-debacle-desert|title=From Darpa Grand Challenge 2004: DARPA's Debacle in the Desert|author=Joseph Hooper|date=June 2004|publisher=[[Popular Science]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The next farthest vehicles were those of the SciAutonics II Team, which traversed {{convert|6.7|mi|km}} before becoming stuck on an embankment;&lt;ref name="PopSci2004_06"/&gt; Team DAD (Digital Auto Drive), which drove {{convert|6.0|mi|km}} before getting stuck on a rock;&lt;ref name="PopSci2004_06"/&gt; and the Golem Group, which made it {{convert|5.2|mi|km}} before becoming trapped on a steep hill.&lt;ref name="PopSci2004_06"/&gt;

==The results==
[[File:DARPA Challenge TeamEnsco.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Team ENSCO's vehicle, DAVID]]
Although the initial race was deemed a failure, as no vehicles achieved anything close to the goal, DARPA was committed to running the challenge for as long as Congressional authority allowed (which would have been until 2007, but the goal was reached in 2005). The first Grand Challenge is considered by some to be a success, mainly because it spurred interest and innovation.&lt;ref name="PopSci2004_06"/&gt;

In addition to the difficulty many vehicles had with the harsh terrain, many initial designs also struggled to handle both sensing upcoming obstacles and following the GPS waypoints simultaneously. DARPA Grand Challenge deputy program manager Tom Strat said, "some of the vehicles were able to follow the GPS waypoints very accurately; but were not able to sense obstacles ahead....Other vehicles were very good at sensing obstacles, but had difficulty following waypoints or were scared of their own shadow, hallucinating obstacles when they weren't there."&lt;ref name="CNN2004_05_06"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/ptech/03/14/darpa.race/index.html|author=Marsha Walton|publisher=[[CNN]]|title=Robots fail to complete Grand Challenge|date=2004-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several teams returned [[DARPA Grand Challenge (2005)|the next year]], learning from the 2004 event and updating their designs.&lt;ref name="CNN2004_05_06"/&gt;

'''David Ernest James''' (born Sydney 1958) is a [[cell biology|cell biologist]] who discovered the glucose transporter [[GLUT4]]. He has also been responsible for the molecular dissection of the intracellular trafficking pathways that regulate GLUT4 translocation to the cell surface, the topological mapping of the insulin signal transduction pathway, the creation of a method for studying ''in vivo'' metabolism in small animals, and the use of this method to gain insights into whole-animal fuel metabolism and homeostasis.

In 1979 he graduated with a BSc (Hons) from the [[University of New South Wales]], and completed his PhD at the [[Garvan Institute of Medical Research]] in 1984.&lt;ref name="garvan1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://old.garvan.org.au/about-us/our-people/professor-david-james/?searchterm=david%20james |title=Professor David James FAA – Garvan Institute |publisher=Old.garvan.org.au |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is currently holds joint appointments at the Garvan Institute and UNSW Australia.&lt;ref name="garvan1"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21449">'''Engineering management''' is the application of the practice of [[management]] to the practice of [[engineering]].

Engineering management is a career that brings together the technological problem-solving ability of [[engineering]] and the organizational, administrative, and planning abilities of [[management]] in order to oversee the operational performance of complex engineering driven enterprises. A [[Master of Engineering Management]] (MEM) is sometimes compared to a [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) for professionals seeking a graduate degree as a qualifying credential for a career in engineering management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gordon.tufts.edu/programs/m-s-in-engineering-management/msem-vs-mba|title=MSEM vs. MBA - Gordon Institute|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Stevens Institute of Technology]] is believed to have the oldest engineering management department, established as the School of Business Engineering in 1908. This was later called the Bachelor of Engineering in Engineering Management (BEEM) program and moved into the School of Systems and Enterprises. Drexel University established the first graduate engineering management degree in the U.S., which was first offered in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drexel.edu/egmt/about/history/|title=History - Engineering Management|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967 the first university department explicitly titled "Engineering Management" was founded at the [[Missouri University of Science and Technology]] (Missouri S&amp;T, formerly the University of Missouri-Rolla, formerly Missouri School of Mines). In 1959, [[Western Michigan University]] began offering the predecessor to the modern engineering management bachelor's degree (titled "Industrial Supervision") and in 1977, WMU started its MS degree in Manufacturing Administration, later renamed as Engineering Management. 

Outside the USA, in Germany the first department concentrating on Engineering Management was established 1927 in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vwi.org/hauptmenue/beruf-studium/wirtschaftsingenieurwesen/geschichte-und-bedeutung.html|title=Geschichte und Bedeutung - vwi.org|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Turkey the [[Istanbul Technical University]] has a Management Engineering Department established in 1982, offering a number of graduate and undergraduate programs in Management Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.end.itu.edu.tr/tarihce.html&lt;/ref&gt; In UK the [[University of Warwick]] has a specialised department [[Warwick Manufacturing Group|WMG]] (previously known as [[Warwick Manufacturing Group]]) established in 1980, which offers a graduate programme in MSc Engineering Business Management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/wmg/education/wmgmasters/courses/masters_engineering_business_management|title=MSc Engineering Business Management - University of Warwick|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michigan Technological University]] began an Engineering Management program in the School of Business &amp; Economics in the Fall of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtu.edu/registrar/students/major-degree/audit/business/|title=School of Business Audit Forms - The Registrar's Office|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, [[Memorial University of Newfoundland]] has started a complete master's degree Program in Engineering Management.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engr.mun.ca/graduate/course/mem.php Master of Engineering Management]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Denmark, the [[Technical University of Denmark]] offers a MSc program in Engineering Management (in English).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtu.dk/english/Education/msc/Programmes/engineering_management MSc in Engineering Management].&lt;/ref&gt;

In Pakistan, [[University of Engineering and Technology, Taxila]], [[University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore]] and [[National University of Sciences and Technology, Pakistan|National University of Science and Technology]] (NUST) offer admission both at Master and Doctorate level in Engineering Management while [[Capital University of Science &amp; Technology]] (CUST), NED University of Engineering &amp; Technology, Karachi and Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology have been running a Master of Engineering/MS in Engineering Management program. A variant of this program is within Quality Management. COMSATS (CIIT) offers a MSc Project Management program to Local and Overseas Pakistanis as an on-campus/off-campus student.

In Italy, [[Politecnico di Milano]] offers degrees in Management Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dig.polimi.it/index.php?id=37&amp;L=2|title=Studies in Management, Economics and Industrial Engineering|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Russia, since 2014 the Faculty of Engineering Management of The [[Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration]] (RANEPA) offers bachelor and master degrees in Engineering Management.

In France, the  [http://www.epf.fr/en EPF] will offer, from January 2018, a 2 year Engineering &amp; Management major in English for the 4th and 5th years of its 5 year Engineering Master’s degree.  The final 2 years are open to students who have completed an undergraduate engineering degree elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epf.fr/en/studies/majors/engineering-management-major-paris-campus EPF:Engineering Management Paris Campus]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas==

=== Operations management, operations research, and supply chain management ===
[[Operations management]] is concerned with designing and controlling the process of production and redesigning business operations in the production of goods or services. [[Operations research]] deals with quantitative models of complex operations and uses these models to support [[decision-making]] in any sector of industry or public services. [[Supply chain management]] is the process of planning, implementing and managing the flow of goods, services and related information from the point of origin to the point of consumption.&lt;ref name="UWMGTE"&gt;[http://www.mansci.uwaterloo.ca/mgte/index.php University of Waterloo], Management Engineering.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Management of technology ===
The [[Technology management|Management of Technology]] (MOT) theme builds on the foundation of management topics in [[accounting]], [[finance]], [[economics]], [[organizational behavior]] and organizational design. Courses in this theme deal with operational and organizational issues related to managing [[innovation]] and technological change.&lt;ref name="UWMGTE"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gordon.tufts.edu/programs/m-s-in-engineering-management/program-structure|title=Program Structure - Gordon Institute|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New product development and product engineering ===
[[New product development]] (NPD) is the complete process of bringing a new product to market. [[Product engineering]] refers to the process of designing and developing a device, assembly, or system such that it be produced as an item for sale through some production manufacturing process. Product engineering usually entails activity dealing with issues of cost, producibility, quality, performance, reliability, serviceability, intended lifespan and user features. [[Project Management]] techniques are used to manage the design and development progress using the [[phase-gate model]] in the product development process. [[Design for manufacturability]] (also sometimes known as design for manufacturing or DFM) is the general engineering art of designing products in such a way that they are easy to manufacture.

=== Systems engineering ===
[[Systems engineering]] is an interdisciplinary field of engineering and engineering management that focuses on how to design and manage complex systems over their life cycles.

=== Industrial engineering ===
[[Industrial engineering]] is a branch of engineering which deals with the optimization of complex processes, systems or organizations. Industrial engineers work to eliminate waste of time, money, materials, man-hours, machine time, energy and other resources that do not generate value.

=== Management science ===
[[Management science]] uses various scientific research-based principles, strategies, and analytical methods including [[mathematical modeling]], statistics and numerical algorithms to improve an organization's ability to enact rational and meaningful management decisions by arriving at optimal or near optimal solutions to complex decision problems

==Education==
Engineering management programs typically include instruction in [[accounting]], [[economics]], [[finance]], [[project management]], [[systems engineering]], [[industrial engineering]], [[mathematical model]]ing and optimization, [[management information systems]], [[quality control]] &amp; [[six sigma]], [[operations management]], [[operations research]], [[human resources management]], industrial [[psychology]], [[safety]] and [[health]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2002/cip2000/occupationallookup6d.ASP?CIP=15.1501 U.S. Department of Education Institute of Education Sciences: Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP)] - Retrieved on October 26, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://atmae.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=227&amp;Itemid=48 ATMAE Membership Venn Diagram] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113190247/http://atmae.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=227&amp;Itemid=48 |date=2013-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many options for entering into engineering management, albeit that the foundation requirement is an [[engineering degree]] (or other [[computer science]], [[mathematics]] or [[science]] degree) and a [[business degree]].

'''Undergraduate degrees'''

Although most engineering management programs are geared for graduate studies, there are a few elite institutions that teach EM at the undergraduate level.  Some of the ones that are accredited and/or recognized by ASEM include: West Point ([[United States Military Academy]]), [[Norwich University]], [[Western Michigan University]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wmich.edu/edmms/academics/undergraduate/engmanagementtech&lt;/ref&gt; (ABET-accredited by ETAC of ABET), [[New York Institute of Technology]], [[Stevens Institute of Technology]], [[Illinois Institute of Technology]], [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]], [[George Washington University]], [[Arizona State University]], [[Missouri University of Science and Technology]]. Graduates of these programs regularly command nearly $65,000 their first year out of school.&lt;ref name="Stevens Institue of Technology"&gt;{{cite web|title=Accepted Salary Offers |url=http://www.stevens.edu/sit/admissions/careers/2010-Career-Outcomes.cfm |work=Class of 2010 Career Outcomes |accessdate=18 May 2011 |author=Stevens Institute of Technology |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120409114519/http://www.stevens.edu/sit/admissions/careers/2010-Career-Outcomes.cfm |archivedate=9 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside the USA, [[Istanbul Technical University]] Management Engineering Department offers an undergraduate degree in Management Engineering,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isl.itu.edu.tr/isletmeLisansProgramlarEN.htm&lt;/ref&gt; attracting top students. The [[University of Waterloo]] offers a 4-year undergraduate degree (5 years including co-op education) in the field of Management Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mansci.uwaterloo.ca/mgte/index.php Management Engineering]&lt;/ref&gt; This is the first program of its kind in Canada. In Peru, Pacifico University offers a five-year undergraduate degree in this field, the first program in this country. In Germany, [[ESB Business School]]&lt;ref&gt;[[ESB Business School]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=January 2018}} offers a 4-year undergraduate program which consists of five semesters at [[ESB Business School]], two mandatory internships, one is mandatory to be in another country than Germany, and also one mandatory semester abroad. In the annual applied university ranking of the magazine [[Wirtschaftswoche]], the [[Engineering Management]] course of [[ESB Business School]] is ranked on place five of all applied universities in Germany&lt;ref&gt;https://www.esb-business-school.de/fakultaet/aktuelles/detail/artikel/bwl-absolventen-der-esb-auf-platz-eins/&lt;/ref&gt;. The magazine surveyed more than 500 recruiters in the German industry from which university they are most likely to recruit students and which universities satisfy their needs regarding experience in working with projects, multilingual education, and ability to communicate most.

'''Graduate degrees'''
{{main|Master of Engineering Management}}
Many universities offer Master of Engineering Management degrees. Missouri S&amp;T is credited with awarding the first Ph.D. in Engineering Management in 1984. The [[National Institute of Industrial Engineering]] based in [[Mumbai]] has been awarding degrees in the field of Post Graduate Diploma in Industrial Engineering since 1973 and the Fellowship (Doctoral) degrees have been awarded since 2008. 

[[Western Michigan University]] began offering the MS in Manufacturing Administration degree in 1977 and later renamed the degree as Master of Science in Engineering Management&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wmich.edu/ieeem/academics/masters&lt;/ref&gt;. WMU's MSEM alumni work in the automotive, medical, manufacturing, and service sectors, often in roles of project manager, engineering manager, and senior leadership in engineering and technical organizations.

Cornell University started one of the first Engineering Management Masters programs in 1988 with the launch of their Master of Engineering (M.Eng.) in Engineering Management. The program allows students access to courses and programs in the College of Engineering, Johnson School of Management, and across Cornell University more broadly. 

Netaji Subhas Institute of technology (NSIT, website as http://www.nsit.ac.in/ under University of Delhi)New Delhi also provides M.tech degree in Engineering management.Admission to this program happens through GATE(Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering)examination.

Massachusetts Institute of Technology offers a Master in System Design and Management, which is a member of the Consortium of Engineering Management.

Students in the University of Kansas' Engineering Management Program are practicing professionals employed by over 100 businesses, manufacturing, government or consulting firms. There are over 200 actively enrolled students in the program and approximately 500 alumni.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emgt.ku.edu/key-aspects|title=Key Aspects - Engineering Management|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Istanbul Technical University]] Management Engineering Department offers a graduate degree,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isl.itu.edu.tr/isletmeYuksekLisansProgramlarEN.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and a Ph.D. in Management Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isl.itu.edu.tr/isletmeDoktoraProgramlarEN.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[American Society for Engineering Education]] (ASEE) PRISM Magazine (March 2008) the largest Master's of Engineering Management (MEM) programs (in terms of degrees awarded for 2005–2006) are shown in the following chart.

==Management engineering consulting==
Large and small engineering driven firms often require the expertise of external [[management consultant]]s that specialize in companies where engineering practice and product development are key drivers of value.  Most engineering management consultants will have as a minimum a [[professional engineering]] qualification.  But usually they will also have graduate degrees in engineering and or business or a [[management consulting]] designation.  It involves providing [[management consulting]] service that is specific to professional [[engineering]] practice or to the engineering industry sector.  Engineering management consultancies, are typically boutique firms and have a more specialized focus than the traditional mainstream consulting firms, [[A T Kearney]], [[Boston Consulting Group]], [[KPMG]], [[PWC]], and [[McKinsey &amp; Company|McKinsey]]. [[Applied science]] and [[engineering]] practice requires a holistic approach involving a combination of management art, science, and engineering practice. There are many professional service companies delivering services in a consultancy type relationship to the engineering industry, including [[law]], [[accounting]], [[human resources]], [[marketing]], [[politics]], [[economics]], [[finance]], [[Public administration|public affairs]], and [[communication]].  Commonly, engineering management consultants are used when firms require a combination of special [[Technology|technical]] knowledge, and [[management]] know how, to enhance [[knowledge]] or transform organizational performance and also keep any [[intellectual property]] developed confidential.

Engineering management consulting is concerned with the development, improvement, implementation and evaluation of integrated systems of organizations, people, money, knowledge, information, equipment, energy, materials and/or processes.  Management Engineering Consultants strive to improve upon existing organizations, processes, products or systems. Engineering management consulting draws upon the principles and methods of engineering analysis and synthesis, as well as the mathematical, physical and [[social sciences]] together with the principles and methods of engineering design to specify, predict, and evaluate the results to be obtained from such systems or processes. Engineering management consulting can focus on the social impact of the product, process or system that is being analyzed.  There is also an overlap between engineering management consulting and [[management science]] in services that require the adoption of more analytical approaches to problem solving.

Examples of where engineering management consulting might be used include developing and leading a company wide [[business transformation]] initiative, or designing and implementing a [[new product development]] process, designing and implementing a [[manufacturing engineering]] process, including an automated assembly workstation.  Management engineers may specialize in the acquisition and implementation of [[Computer aided design]] (CAD), [[Computer-aided manufacturing]] (CAM) and [[Computer-aided engineering]] (CAE) applications.  Services may include strategizing for various operational logistics, new product introductions, or consulting as an efficiency expert.  It may include using [[management science]] techniques to develop a new financial algorithm or loan system for a bank, streamlining operation and emergency room location or usage in a hospital, planning complex distribution schemes for materials or products (referred to as [[Supply Chain Management]]), and shortening lines (or [[queueing theory|queues]]) at a bank, hospital, or a theme park.  Management engineering consultants typically use [[computer simulation]] (especially [[discrete event simulation]]), along with extensive mathematical tools and modeling and computational methods for system analysis, evaluation, and optimization.

==Professional organizations==
There are a number of societies and organizations dedicated to the field of engineering management. One of the largest societies is a division of IEEE, the Engineering Management Society, which regularly publishes a trade magazine. Another prominent professional organization in the field is the American Society for Engineering Management (ASEM), which was founded in 1979 by a group of 20 engineering managers from industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asem.org|title=American Society for Engineering Management - Home|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ASEM currently certifies engineering managers (two levels) via the Associate Engineering Manager (AEM) or Professional Engineering Manager (PEM) certification exam. The Master of Engineering Management Programs Consortium is a newly formed consortium of prominent universities intended to raise the value and visibility of the MEM degree.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mempc.org Master of Engineering Management Programs Consortium ]&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, engineering management university programs have the possibility of being accredited by [[Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology|ABET]], [[Association of Technology, Management, and Applied Engineering|ATMAE]], or ASEM. In Canada, the Canadian Society for Engineering Management (CSEM) is a constituent society of the Engineering Institute of Canada (EIC), Canada's oldest learned engineering society.

"'''Galaxy Song'''" is a [[Monty Python]] song written by [[Eric Idle]] and [[John Du Prez]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Monty Python Sings]]'' CD booklet. 1989 Virgin Records&lt;/ref&gt;

The song first appeared in the 1983 film ''[[Monty Python's The Meaning of Life]]'' and was later released on the album ''[[Monty Python Sings]]''. The song was released as a single in the UK on 27 June 1983 when it reached No.&amp;nbsp;77 in the charts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=galaxy song |publisher=Official Charts |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/galaxy%20song/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again on 2 December 1991 as a follow-up to the successful reissue of ''[[Always Look on the Bright Side of Life]]''. In 2014 the song was featured in the live stage show ''[[Monty Python Live (Mostly)]]'' which was followed by another single release on 13 April 2015, this time in collaboration with [[Stephen Hawking]].

== Premise and synopsis ==

The song originally debuted during the [[comedy sketch]] "Live Organ Transplants". The paramedic ([[John Cleese]]), upon failing to persuade Mrs. Brown ([[Terry Jones]]) to donate her liver, opens the refrigerator doors to reveal a man wearing a pink [[morning suit]] (Eric Idle). The man accompanies Mrs. Brown through outer space singing various statistics about the galaxy. The upshot of the song (which follows a synthesized instrumental montage that, in the movie, is accompanied by a computer-animated picture of a woman being impregnated) is that in the grand scheme of the universe, the likelihood of Mrs. Brown's existence was almost zero, but that she should "pray that there's intelligent life somewhere up in space, 'cause there's [[bugger]] all down here on Earth". The singer returns to the refrigerator, at which point Mrs. Brown admits that the singer convinced her to hand over her liver.

== Accuracy of astronomical figures ==

The lyrics include a number of [[Astronomy|astronomical]] facts and figures, which may have accurately reflected the known values at the time the song was written while many are simply rounded for the sake of the song's meter. Some of these have changed as improved technology has allowed scientists to make more accurate measurements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://ephemeris.sjaa.net/0312/b.html |title=A study of the ''Galaxy Song'' by Eric Idle |first=Paul |last=Kohlmiller |publisher=San Jose Astronomical Association |journal=Ephemeris |date=December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Idle sings that the [[Earth]] is "revolving at nine hundred miles an hour". He is using the wrong term, since the Earth revolves around the Sun, but it rotates on its axis; however, "rotating" does not rhyme with "evolving" so the songwriters may have used artistic license. The current estimate for the rotational speed at the equator is 1040&amp;nbsp;miles/hr (1670&amp;nbsp;kilometers/hour).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://image.gsfc.nasa.gov/poetry/ask/a10840.html|title=NASA IMAGE satellite,Ask the Space Scientist Archive|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; 900 miles is correct if this is given in [[nautical mile]]s, but it is more common to speak of [[knot (unit)|knot]]s in this case. He gives the Earth's orbital speed as {{convert|19|mi|km}}&amp;nbsp;per second, compared with the real figure of 18 to 18.5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://searchcio-midmarket.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid183_gci849653,00.html|title=What is Earth's mean orbital speed?|work=WhatIs.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://members.aol.com/nlpjp/speed.htm |title=Earth's Speed |first=Jerry |last=Pool |via=AOL |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030919160000/http://members.aol.com/nlpjp/speed.htm |archivedate=19 September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://galileoandeinstein.physics.virginia.edu/lectures/spedlite.html|title=The Speed of Light|publisher=University of Virginia}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Idle states that the [[Sun]] is "the source of all our power". In fact, three notable sources of electrical power are not directly traceable to the Sun: The first is [[geothermal power]], which is derived from [[geothermal energy]], 20% of which remains from the original planet formation and 80% of which is derived from ongoing radioactive decay. The second source is the Moon's effects on [[tide]]s and the associated methods of [[Tidal power|power generation]]. The third is [[nuclear power]] derived from [[uranium]] and other fissile elements. Ultimately, however, the overwhelming proportion of human-generated power derived from [[fossil fuels]] and thence from photosynthetic plants makes this line a very good approximation to the truth. The three other power sources are available because of the Sun's influence on our early solar system, so Idle's statement is correct in a literal (if somewhat pedantic) sense, even if not for practical purposes.
* Idle's figures for the size of the [[Milky Way]] [[galaxy]] are roughly correct. He understates the speed at which the Sun orbits the "galactic central point" by an order of magnitude (12 million miles a day compared to "1 million miles a day"), but he gives an estimate accurate to one [[significant figure]] for the total time per orbit. This is "two hundred million years" according to the song, compared with accepted figures of 220 to 250&amp;nbsp;million years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2002/StacyLeong.shtml|title=Period of the Sun's Orbit around the Galaxy (Cosmic Year)|first=Glenn|last=Elert|work=hypertextbook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justforkidsonly.com/rref6xdistinspace.htm|title=Ready Reference|work=justforkidsonly.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://astrosociety.org/edu/publications/tnl/71/howfast.html#5 |title= How Fast Are You Moving When You Are Sitting Still?|accessdate= 2017-09-27}} 483000 miles/hour = 11.5 million miles/day&lt;/ref&gt;
* The song says that we are "thirty thousand light years from galactic central point", again correct to within one significant figure of 25,000&amp;nbsp;light years from the centre of the Milky Way.&lt;ref name="oregon"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/ast122/lectures/lec25.html |title= Milky Way Galaxy |publisher= University of Oregon }}&lt;/ref&gt; The song also states that the galaxy is "a hundred thousand light years side to side". This would make the galactic radius 50,000&amp;nbsp;light years, which is accurate.&lt;ref name="oregon" /&gt; Australian astrophysicist [[Bryan Gaensler]] has stated that Idle's estimation of the thickness of the Milky Way, at 16,000&amp;nbsp;light years, is more accurate than the official 'textbook' figure of 6,000&amp;nbsp;light years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/186976,milky-way-twice-as-thick-as-thought.html |title= Milky Way twice as thick as thought |work= earthtimes.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the song's position on this was later confused by Idle's performance of the song in his ''[[Not the Messiah (He's a Very Naughty Boy)|Not the Messiah]]'' show (2007) where the figure he sings is only 6,000 light years.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|85IGr-yVv_M|Eric Idle Galaxy Song from Not The Messiah finale at Hollywood Bowl 8-2-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for the confusion has since been explained in a message from Idle on the official Monty Python website. "There was some smug website pulling apart all my original figures for the song (written circa 1981) so for the 2003 Tour (or maybe 2000) I 'updated' them. Now you tell me I was right all along! Not sure where I got my figures originally but tell the bastards to make up their minds."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |first=John Alex |last=Wood |url=http://pythonline.com/blogs/johnalexwood/6_or_16_thousand_light_years_thick |title=6 or 16 thousand light years thick? |date=4 August 2008 |publisher=pythonline.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080815043835/http://pythonline.com/blogs/johnalexwood/6_or_16_thousand_light_years_thick |archivedate=15 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The last verse of the song explains that the [[Metric expansion of space|universe is expanding]], and furthermore, that the [[speed of light]] is the "fastest speed there is". Idle’s estimate of the speed of light is a relatively accurate one: 12&amp;nbsp;million miles per minute, versus the standard figure of about 11.16&amp;nbsp;million miles per minute. (11&amp;nbsp;million would be a closer estimate, but Idle may have chosen "12" simply because the word "11" would not scan so well.){{cn|date=October 2017}} Contrary to what the verse implies, the expansion of the universe is not related to the speed of light, and it is in fact expanding much faster.&lt;ref&gt;

== Remake ==
[[File:Eric Idle Carol Cleveland Galaxy Song.jpg|thumb|right|[[Eric Idle]] and [[Carol Cleveland]] performing the ''Galaxy Song'' in 2014]]
Released in 1984, [[Jim Post]]'s album ''Crooner From Outer Space'' features a remake called "Galaxy/Lighten Up".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjEOpfCcujE&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, [[Clint Black]] recorded a remake of "The Galaxy Song" on his album ''[[D'lectrified]]'', as well as the "Outside Intro (To Galaxy Song)", which he co-wrote and sang with Idle.

In late 2012, an updated version of "The Galaxy Song" aired on [[BBC Two]] in a trailer for [[Wonders of Life (TV series)|''Wonders of Life'']], hosted by physicist [[Brian Cox (physicist)|Brian Cox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|uo6OCxwUPPg|Wonders of Life Trailer - BBC Two}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was called "The Galaxy DNA Song" by Idle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Idle |first=Eric |date=29 October 2012 |url=http://www.nerdist.com/2012/10/eric-idle-on-galaxy-song-the-new-biological-version/ |title=Eric Idle on 'Galaxy Song,' the New Biological Version |publisher=The Nerdist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the song was performed in the stage show ''[[Monty Python Live (Mostly)]]''. Idle emerges from a refrigerator and begins singing to an elderly woman ([[Carol Cleveland]]). At one point, they start dancing on stage as a clip shows them dancing among the stars with the galaxy in the background. After the song ends, the show cuts to a clip of Cox at Cambridge discussing the various scientific inaccuracies within the song. He is knocked over by [[Stephen Hawking]] going by in his motorized chair. Hawking tells Cox not to be so pedantic, and then starts to sing the song himself. Hawking's cover for the song was released as a Record Store Day [[Single (music)|single]] in 2015.

In December 2016, the theme of the song was extended into the hour-long [[BBC Two]] ''The Entire Universe'' show. Written and co-presented by Idle and Professor [[Brian Cox (physicist)|Brian Cox]], it took the form of a lecture by Cox interspersed with a "comedy and musical extravaganza with the help of [[Warwick Davis]], [[Noel Fielding]], [[Hannah Waddingham]] and [[Robin Ince]], alongside a chorus of singers and dancers". The show closed with an ensemble rendition of "The Galaxy Song" with updated figures: the galaxy containing 500 billion stars instead of 100 billion; the galaxy rotation speed of 500,000&amp;nbsp;mph instead of 40,000; the galaxy thickness as 6,000&amp;nbsp;ly instead of 16,000, and a spiral arm thickness of 1,000&amp;nbsp;ly instead of 3,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b086kfbj|title=The Entire Universe|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=26 December 2017|accessdate=27 December 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161227183617/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b086kfbj|archivedate=27 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The partners organize training events, courses and summer schools on tools, standards and compute services provided by de.NBI to assist researchers to more effectively exploit their data &lt;ref&gt;[https://academic.oup.com/bib/advance-article/doi/10.1093/bib/bbx040/3738742 Bioinformatics in Germany: toward a national-level infrastructure by Andreas Tauch &amp; Arwa Al-Dilaimi]&lt;/ref&gt;.

== History ==
In May 2013, the announcement of funding guidelines for a German Network for Bioinformatics Infrastructure (de.NBI) was published by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF). The aim of this announcement was to establish an infrastructure in Germany that will provide solutions to the ‘Big Data Problem’ in life science by means of bioinformatics services and training. A second announcement of funding guidelines for de.NBI partner projects was published in November 2015. The de.NBI program was launched by the BMBF in March 2015, and the partner projects started their work in November 2016&lt;ref&gt;[https://academic.oup.com/bib/advance-article/doi/10.1093/bib/bbx040/3738742 Bioinformatics in Germany: toward a national-level infrastructure by Andreas Tauch &amp; Arwa Al-Dilaimi]&lt;/ref&gt;. In addition, the [[ELIXIR]] Node in Germany is run by de.NBI since August 2016 &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.elixir-europe.org/news/elixir-board-meeting-2016-spring-session ELIXIR Board Meeting Spring 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.elixir-europe.org/news/germany-joins-elixir Germany joins ELIXIR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.elixir-europe.org/about-us/who-we-are/nodes/germany. ELIXIR Germany]&lt;/ref&gt;.

The first coordinator of the project and Head of the German ELIXIR Node is Alfred Pühler. 

== Organisation ==
Since November 2016, the de.NBI network consists of the eight interconnected centers including nearly 40 research, service and infrastructure groups with about 150 bioinformaticians &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gesundheitsindustrie-bw.de/de/fachbeitrag/aktuell/denbi-netzwerk-fuer-bioinformatik-infrastruktur-wird-weiter-ausgebaut de.NBI – Netzwerk für Bioinformatik-Infrastruktur wird weiter ausgebaut by Oliver Kohlbacher]&lt;/ref&gt;.

de.NBI tools are also registered and searchable in the ELIXIR Tools and Data Services Registry that provides more information in a standardized format.

=== Hardware ===
de.NBI develops and maintains a cloud system (de.NBI cloud) started in 2016&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg.2017.113 Cloud computing for genomic data analysis and collaboration by Ben Langmead &amp; Abhinav Nellore, 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;. It is a collaboration project between the universities of Bielefeld, Freiburg, Gießen, Heidelberg and Tübingen. The whole system is accessible through a single sign-on (SSO) via the central de.NBI Cloud Portal and is based on the ELIXIR Authentication and Authorization Infrastructure (ELIXIR AAI). It comprises more than 15,000 compute cores and 5 PB of storage capacity (Status April 2018).

== Training ==
Different types of training activities are supported and organzied by de.NBI. First of all, the summer schools provide training courses for undergraduate and [[graduate students]] in specific topics related to one or several de.NBI centers. The respective centers organize tool-specific training. These trainings are attached to existing conferences or organized independently. In addition, online training was introducted on the de.NBI website in 2016. In 2017, online [[hackathons]] for different software packages and [[webinars]] have been established by the centers RBC and CIBI.

In 2015, 17 training courses with 329 participants were organized by de.NBI. In 2016, the network has organized 40 training courses with 882 participants. For 2017, the network could further increase the number of courses and participants (69 training courses with 1489 participants).

=== de.NBI Summer Schools===

'''Girl Geek Scotland''' ('''GGS''')&lt;ref&gt;http://www.girlgeekscotland.co.uk/&lt;/ref&gt; was established in 2008 and is part of the [[Girl Geek Dinners]] network. GGS held its first Girl Geek Dinner in Dundee in February 2009. A group in Edinburgh was established shortly after &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/latestnews/IT-girls-in-networking-revolution.5494264.jp|title=IT girls in networking revolution|date=25 July 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and GGS has now grown to include groups in Glasgow and Aberdeen. 

In September 2009 GGS won funding from the [[UKRC]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ukrc4setwomen.org/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100416021440/http://www.ukrc4setwomen.org/ |archivedate=2010-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in a collaborative bid with Leeds Girl Geek Dinners to support a speaker series for 2010 on the theme of "Creativity, Computing and Entrepreneurialism". Through this speaker series GGS intends to support knowledge transfer into business and entrepreneurial activities, which has been identified as key to Britain's economic recovery and future in the [[Digital Britain]] Report. The School of Informatics at the [[University of Edinburgh]] are acting as the parent organisation for this project. Other key funders which provided match funding are SICSA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sicsa.ac.uk/|title=Home - SICSA |publisher=The Scottish Informatics &amp; Computer Science Alliance}}&lt;/ref&gt; and WYLLN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wylln.ac.uk/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527064912/http://www.wylln.ac.uk/ |archivedate=2010-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a growing list of sponsors and partners for this project which now includes [[NCR Corporation]], Blonde Digital, brightsolid, Harvey Nash, [[British Computer Society]], nti Leeds, Carbon Imagineering, Kilo 75, Codeworks, Digital 20/20 and the [[WEA (Workers' Educational Association)]] Scotland.

The Speaker Series was launched&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thecourier.co.uk/output/2010/02/10/newsstory14522841t0.asp | title=Girls gather | work=The Courier | date=2010-02-10 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215062009/http://www.thecourier.co.uk/output/2010/02/10/newsstory14522841t0.asp | archivedate=February 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Dundee Contemporary Arts]] by Silicon Valley Entrepreneur Shanna Telllerman CEO of Wildpockets&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wildpockets.com/&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Corporate spin-off|spin out]] company from [[Carnegie Mellon University]]'s Entertainment Technology Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://square-go.com/scotland-in-focus-girl-geek-scotland-part-1/|title=Scotland in Focus: Girl Geek Scotland – Part 1|publisher=[[SquareGo]]|accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://square-go.com/scotland-in-focus-girl-geek-scotland-part-2/|title=Scotland in Focus: Girl Geek Scotland – Part 2|publisher=[[SquareGo]]|accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2009, Girl Geek Scotland won funding from Informatic Ventures&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informatics-ventures.com/|title=Informatics Ventures - Technology Entrepreneur Events|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Edinburgh]], to develop three intensive residential workshops for 2010 on the subjects of 'Creativity into business', 'Developing a Funding Strategy' and 'Negotiation Strategies and Techniques'. The Workshops are for women in pre-start-up business; start-up businesses and existing businesses in the technology sector in Scotland.

The Enterprise Workshops took place over three weekends in September, October and November in 2010 and helped approximately 30 female entrepreneurs progress or develop their enterprise concepts and start-up businesses.

Girl Geek Scotland went dark during 2011–2012 while many of the volunteer organisers needed to focus on their main projects. But in Spring 2013, the GGS organisers were awarded funding for more events 2013–2014. The biggest was a special summer double event called "Conversations with Silicon Valley" that welcomed four inspirational female sector leaders from Silicon Valley to take part in a dinner panel, chaired by Suzanne Doyle-Morris. The guests were Heidi Roizen, Wendy Lea, Ann Winblad, and Karen White; followed by the "Summer Start-Up Party" for the local tech and start-up community.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3017">The '''hartree''' (symbol: ''E''&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; or Ha), also known as the '''Hartree energy''', is the [[atomic unit]] of [[energy]], named after the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[physicist]] [[Douglas Hartree]]. It is defined as 
2''R''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;''hc'', where ''R''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Rydberg constant]], ''h'' is the [[Planck constant]] and ''c'' is the [[speed of light]].  
The [[2014 CODATA]] recommended value is ''E''&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= {{nowrap|4.359 744 650(54){{e|−18}}&amp;nbsp;J}} = {{nowrap|27.211 386 02(17)&amp;nbsp;eV}}.&lt;ref&gt;[https://zenodo.org/record/22826#.WCbVVO0oA_s]&lt;/ref&gt;

The hartree energy is approximately the [[electric potential energy]] of the [[hydrogen]] [[atom]] in its [[ground state]] and, by the [[virial theorem]], approximately twice its [[ionization energy]]; the relationships are not exact because of the finite [[mass]] of the [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] of the hydrogen atom and [[Quantum electrodynamics|relativistic corrections]].

The hartree is usually used as a unit of energy in [[atomic physics]] and [[computational chemistry]]: for experimental measurements at the atomic scale, the [[electronvolt]] (eV) or the [[reciprocal centimetre]] (cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) are much more widely used.

==Other relationships==

where:
:''ħ'' is the [[reduced Planck constant]],
:''m''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[electron]] [[rest mass]],
:''e'' is the [[elementary charge]],
:''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Bohr radius]],
:''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[electric constant]], 
:''c'' is the [[speed of light]] in vacuum, and
:''α'' is the [[fine structure constant]].

Note that since the [[Bohr radius]] &lt;math&gt;a_0&lt;/math&gt; is defined as
&lt;math&gt;a_0 = \frac{4 \pi \varepsilon_0 \hbar^2}{m_{\mathrm{e}} e^2} = \frac{\hbar}{m_{\mathrm{e}}\,c\,\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;
one may write the Hartree energy as
&lt;math&gt;E_\mathrm{h} = e^2/a_0 &lt;/math&gt; in [[Gaussian units]] where &lt;math&gt;4\pi \varepsilon_0=1&lt;/math&gt;. Effective Hartree units are used in semiconductor physics where 
&lt;math&gt;e^2&lt;/math&gt; is replaced by &lt;math&gt;e^2/\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &lt;/math&gt; is the static dielectric constant. Also, the electron mass is replaced by the effective band mass &lt;math&gt;m^*&lt;/math&gt;. The effective Hartree in semiconductors becomes small enough to be measured in mili-electron volts (meV)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2333">The '''Hubble Heritage Project''' was founded by a group of [[astronomer]]s in 1998. The team releases on an almost monthly basis pictures of [[celestial object]]s like [[planet]]s, [[star]]s, [[galaxies]] and [[galaxy cluster]]s.

A team of astronomers and image processing specialists selects images from the Hubble Space Telescope's public data archive, which are usually only shared within the astronomical community. Because most of the photos were taken for scientific reasons they often lack sufficient [[Exposure (photography)|exposure]] across a range of colors. A small amount of observation time with the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] has been granted to the team to fill in the gaps in these images. 

The Project has been recognized for its contribution to public inspiration in producing some of the most aesthetically pleasing images ever produced in astronomy. Achievements for the team include the [[Astronomical Society of the Pacific]] 2003 [[Klumpke-Roberts Award]] for "outstanding contributions to the public understanding and appreciation of astronomy." In 2002, two Heritage images were selected in the [[Rochester Institute of Technology]]'s "Images From Science" traveling gallery exhibit. Several images have been selected by the US and UK postal systems. In 2000, a first-class US postage stamp showing the [[Ring Nebula]] was one of five Hubble images selected to be part of a commemorative series of stamps honoring astronomer [[Edwin_Hubble|Edwin P. Hubble]]. 

The website of the project contains a lot of information about the [[NASA]]/[[ESA]] Hubble Space Telescope, including a lot of interesting images taken by the Hubble, and information about the future of Hubble. The images on the site are the most notable ones taken by Hubble, and are specifically enhanced with color for release to the public. They are available in different formats, including as [[computer wallpaper]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22497">[[Image:Inverse square law.svg|thumb|420px|S represents the light source, while r represents the measured points. The lines represent the [[flux]] emanating from the sources and fluxes.
 
The total number of [[flux line]]s depends on the strength of the source and is constant with increasing distance, where a greater density of flux lines (lines per unit area) means a stronger field. The density of flux lines is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source because the surface area of a sphere increases with the square of the radius. Thus the strength of the field is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source.]]

The '''inverse-square law''', in [[physics]], is any [[physical law]] stating that a specified physical [[quantity]] or intensity is [[Proportionality (mathematics)#Inverse proportionality|inversely proportional]] to the [[square (algebra)|square]] of the [[distance]] from the source of that physical quantity. The fundamental cause for this can be understood as geometric dilution corresponding to point-source radiation into three-dimensional space (see diagram).

[[Radar]] energy expands during both the signal transmission and also on the [[reflection (physics)|reflected]] return, so the [[inverse square]] for both paths means that the radar will receive energy according to the inverse [[fourth power]] of the range.

In order to prevent dilution of [[energy]] while propagating a signal, certain methods can be used such as a [[waveguide]], which acts like a canal does for water, or how a gun barrel restricts hot gas expansion to one [[dimension]] in order to prevent loss of energy transfer to a [[bullet]].

== Formula ==
Mathematically notated (see [[∝]]):
:&lt;math&gt;\text{intensity} \ \propto \ \frac{1}{\text{distance}^2} \, &lt;/math&gt;

It can also be mathematically expressed as:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\text{intensity}_1}{\text{intensity}_2} = \frac{\text{distance}_2^2}{\text{distance}_1^2}&lt;/math&gt;

or as the formulation of a constant quantity:
:&lt;math&gt;\text{intensity}_1 \times \text{distance}_1^2 = \text{intensity}_2 \times \text{distance}_2^2&lt;/math&gt;

The [[divergence]] of a [[vector field]] which is the resultant of radial inverse-square law fields with respect to one or more sources is everywhere proportional to the strength of the local sources, and hence zero outside sources. [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] follows an inverse-square law, as do the effects of [[electricity|electric]], [[magnetism|magnetic]], [[light]], [[sound]], and [[radiation]] phenomena.

== Justification ==
The inverse-square law generally applies when some force, energy, or [[flux|other conserved quantity]] is evenly radiated outward from a [[point source]] in [[three-dimensional space]].  Since the [[surface area]] of a [[sphere]] (which is&amp;nbsp;4π''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;) is proportional to the square of the radius, as the [[flux density|emitted radiation]] gets farther from the source, it is spread out over an area that is increasing in proportion to the square of the distance from the source. Hence, the intensity of radiation passing through any unit area (directly facing the point source) is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the point source. [[Gauss's law]] is similarly applicable, and can be used with any physical quantity that acts in accordance with the inverse-square relationship.

===Gravitation===
[[Gravity|Gravitation]] is the attraction between objects that have mass. Newton's law states:
: ''The gravitational attraction force between two '''point masses''' is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of their separation distance. The force is always attractive and acts along the line joining them.''

If the distribution of matter in each body is spherically symmetric, then the objects can be treated as point masses without approximation, as shown in the [[shell theorem]].  Otherwise, if we want to calculate the attraction between massive bodies, we need to add all the point-point attraction forces vectorially and the net attraction might not be exact inverse square. However, if the separation between the massive bodies is much larger compared to their sizes, then to a good approximation, it is reasonable to treat the masses as a point mass located at the object's [[center of mass]] while calculating the gravitational force.

As the law of gravitation, this [[Law of universal gravitation|law]] was suggested in 1645 by [[Ismael Bullialdus]]. But Bullialdus did not accept [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Kepler’s second and third laws]], nor did he appreciate [[Christiaan Huygens]]’s solution for circular motion (motion in a straight line pulled aside by the central force).  Indeed, Bullialdus maintained the sun's force was attractive at aphelion and repulsive at perihelion. [[Robert Hooke]] and [[Giovanni Alfonso Borelli]] both expounded gravitation in 1666 as an attractive force&lt;ref&gt;Hooke's gravitation was also not yet universal, though it approached universality more closely than previous hypotheses: See page 239 in Curtis Wilson (1989), "The Newtonian achievement in astronomy", ch.13 (pages 233–274) in "Planetary astronomy from the Renaissance to the rise of astrophysics: 2A: Tycho Brahe to Newton", CUP 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; (Hooke’s lecture "On gravity" at the Royal Society, London, on 21 March;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Birch, ''The History of the Royal Society of London'', … (London, England:  1756), vol. 2, [https://books.google.com/books?id=lWEVAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA68#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pages 68–73]; see especially pages 70–72.&lt;/ref&gt; Borelli's "Theory of the Planets", published later in 1666&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Alfonso Borelli, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YZk_AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PT4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Theoricae Mediceorum Planetarum ex Causius Physicis Deductae''] [Theory [of the motion] of the Medicean planets [i.e., moons of Jupiter] deduced from physical causes] (Florence, (Italy):  1666).&lt;/ref&gt;).  Hooke's 1670 Gresham lecture explained that gravitation applied to "all celestiall bodys" and added the principles that the gravitating power decreases with distance and that in the absence of any such power bodies move in straight lines. By 1679, Hooke thought gravitation had inverse square dependence and communicated this in a letter to [[Isaac Newton]]:&lt;ref name=Hooke1680&gt;{{cite journal |author = Koyré, Alexandre |authorlink = Alexandre Koyré |title = An Unpublished Letter of Robert Hooke to Isaac Newton |journal = [[Isis (journal)|Isis]] |year = 1952 |volume = 43 |issue = 4 |pages = 312–337 |jstor = 227384 |doi = 10.1086/348155 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
''my supposition is that the attraction always is in duplicate proportion to the distance from the center reciprocall''.&lt;ref&gt;Hooke's letter to Newton of 6 Jan. 1680 (Koyré 1952:332).&lt;/ref&gt;

Hooke remained bitter about Newton claiming the invention of this principle, even though Newton's 1686 ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'' acknowledged that Hooke, along with Wren and Halley, had separately appreciated the inverse square law in the solar system,&lt;ref&gt;Newton acknowledged Wren, Hooke and Halley in this connection in the Scholium to Proposition 4 in Book 1 (in all editions): See for example the 1729 English translation of the ''Principia'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA66#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false at page 66].&lt;/ref&gt; as well as giving some credit to Bullialdus.&lt;ref&gt;In a letter to Edmund Halley dated June 20, 1686, Newton wrote:  "Bullialdus wrote that all force respecting ye Sun as its center &amp; depending on matter must be reciprocally in a duplicate ratio of ye distance from ye center."  See:   I. Bernard Cohen and George E. Smith, ed.s, ''The Cambridge Companion to Newton'' (Cambridge, England:  Cambridge University Press, 2002), [https://books.google.com/books?id=3wIzvqzfUXkC&amp;pg=PA204#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false page 204].
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electrostatics===
The force of attraction or repulsion between two electrically charged particles, in addition to being directly proportional to the product of the electric charges, is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them; this is known as [[Coulomb's law]]. The deviation of the exponent from 2 is less than one part in 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last = Williams, Faller, Hill |title = New Experimental Test of Coulomb's Law: A Laboratory Upper Limit on the Photon Rest Mass |journal = [[Physical Review Letters]] |volume = 26 |issue = 12 |pages = 721–724 |year = 1971 |doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.26.721 |first1 = E. |last2 = Faller |first2 = J. |last3 = Hill |first3 = H. |bibcode = 1971PhRvL..26..721W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Light and other electromagnetic radiation===

The [[intensity (physics)|intensity]] (or [[illuminance]] or [[irradiance]]) of [[light]] or other linear waves radiating from a [[point source]] (energy per unit of area perpendicular to the source) is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source; so an object (of the same size) twice as far away, receives only one-quarter the [[energy]] (in the same time period).

More generally, the irradiance, ''i.e.,'' the intensity (or [[power (physics)|power]] per unit area in the direction of [[wave propagation|propagation]]), of a [[sphere|spherical]] [[wavefront]] varies inversely with the square of the distance from the source (assuming there are no losses caused by [[absorption (optics)|absorption]] or [[scattering]]).

For example, the intensity of radiation from the [[Sun]] is 9126 [[watt]]s per square meter at the distance of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] (0.387 [[Astronomical unit|AU]]); but only 1367 watts per square meter at the distance of [[Earth]] (1 AU)—an approximate threefold increase in distance results in an approximate ninefold decrease in intensity of radiation.

For non-[[isotropic radiator]]s such as [[parabolic antenna]]s, headlights, and [[laser]]s, the effective origin is located far behind the beam aperture. If you are close to the origin, you don't have to go far to double the radius, so the signal drops quickly. When you are far from the origin and still have a strong signal, like with a laser, you have to travel very far to double the radius and reduce the signal. This means you have a stronger signal or have [[antenna gain]] in the direction of the narrow beam relative to a wide beam in all directions of an [[Isotropic radiator|isotropic antenna]].

In [[photography]] and [[stage lighting]], the inverse-square law is used to determine the "fall off" or the difference in illumination on a subject as it moves closer to or further from the light source. For quick approximations, it is enough to remember that doubling the distance reduces illumination to one quarter;&lt;ref&gt;Millerson,G. (1991) ''Lighting for Film and Television – 3rd Edition'' p.27&lt;/ref&gt; or similarly, to halve the illumination increase the distance by a factor of 1.4 (the [[square root of 2]]), and to double illumination, reduce the distance to 0.7 (square root of 1/2). When the illuminant is not a point source, the inverse square rule is often still a useful approximation; when the size of the light source is less than one-fifth of the distance to the subject, the calculation error is less than 1%.&lt;ref&gt;Ryer,A. (1997) "The Light Measurement Handbook", {{ISBN|0-9658356-9-3}} p.26&lt;/ref&gt;

The fractional reduction in electromagnetic [[fluence]] (Φ) for indirectly ionizing radiation with increasing distance from a point source can be calculated using the inverse-square law. Since emissions from a point source have radial directions, they intercept at a perpendicular incidence. The area of such a shell is 4π''r'' &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; where ''r'' is the radial distance from the center.  The law is particularly important in diagnostic [[radiography]] and [[radiotherapy]] treatment planning, though this proportionality does not hold in practical situations unless source dimensions are much smaller than the distance.  As stated in fourier theory of heat "as the point source is magnification by distances , its radiation is dilute proportional to  the sin of the angle, of the increasing circumference arc from the point of origin"

====Example====

Let the total power radiated from a point source, for example, an omnidirectional [[isotropic radiator]], be&amp;nbsp;''P''. At large distances from the source (compared to the size of the source), this power is distributed over larger and larger spherical surfaces as the distance from the source increases.  Since the surface area of a sphere of radius ''r'' is ''A''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4''πr''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the [[intensity (physics)|intensity]] ''I'' (power per unit area) of radiation at distance ''r'' is
:&lt;math&gt;
I = \frac P A = \frac P {4 \pi r^2}. \,
&lt;/math&gt;

The energy or intensity decreases (divided by&amp;nbsp;4) as the distance ''r'' is doubled; measured in [[Decibel|dB]] it would decrease by 6.02&amp;nbsp;dB per doubling of distance.

===Sound in a gas===

In [[acoustics]], the [[sound pressure]] of a [[sphere|spherical]] [[wavefront]] radiating from a point source decreases by 50% as the distance ''r'' is doubled; measured in [[Decibel|dB]], the decrease is still 6.02&amp;nbsp;dB, since dB represents an intensity ratio. The pressure ratio (as opposed to power ratio) is not inverse-square, but is inverse-proportional (inverse distance law):

:&lt;math&gt; p \ \propto \ \frac{1}{r} \, &lt;/math&gt;

The same is true for the component of [[particle velocity]] &lt;math&gt; v \,&lt;/math&gt; that is [[Phase (waves)#In-phase and quadrature (I&amp;Q) components|in-phase]] with the instantaneous sound pressure &lt;math&gt;p \,&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; v \ \propto \frac{1}{r} \ \, &lt;/math&gt;

In the [[Near and far field|near field]] is a [[quadrature phase|quadrature component]] of the particle velocity that is 90° out of phase with the sound pressure and does not contribute to the time-averaged energy or the intensity of the sound.  The [[sound intensity]] is the product of the [[root mean square|RMS]] sound pressure and the ''in-phase'' component of the RMS particle velocity, both of which are inverse-proportional. Accordingly, the intensity follows an inverse-square behaviour:

:&lt;math&gt; I \ = \ p v \ \propto \ \frac{1}{r^2}. \, &lt;/math&gt;

==Field theory interpretation==
For an [[irrotational vector field]] in three-dimensional space, the inverse-square law corresponds to the property that the [[divergence]] is zero outside the source. This can be generalized to higher dimensions. Generally, for an irrotational vector field in ''n''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]], the intensity "I" of the vector field falls off with the distance "r" following the inverse (''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; power law

: &lt;math&gt;I\propto \frac 1 {r^{n-1}},&lt;/math&gt;

given that the space outside the source is divergence free. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

==History==

[[John Dumbleton]] of the 14th-century [[Oxford Calculators]], was one of the first to express functional relationships in graphical form. He gave a proof of the [[mean speed theorem]] stating that "the latitude of a uniformly difform movement corresponds to the degree of the midpoint" and used this method to study the quantitative decrease in intensity of illumination  in his ''Summa logicæ et philosophiæ naturalis'' (ca. 1349), stating that it was not linearly proportional to the distance, but was unable to expose the Inverse-square law.&lt;ref&gt;John Freely, ''Before Galileo: The Birth of Modern Science in Medieval Europe'' (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

In proposition 9 of Book 1 in his book ''Ad Vitellionem paralipomena, quibus astronomiae pars optica traditur'' (1604), the astronomer [[Johannes Kepler]] argued that the spreading of light from a point source obeys an inverse square law:&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kepler, ''Ad Vitellionem Paralipomena, quibus astronomiae pars optica traditur'' (Frankfurt, (Germany):   Claude de Marne &amp; heir Jean Aubry, 1604), [http://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/~db/bsb00007828/images/index.html?id=00007828&amp;fip=eayaxsewqxsfsdreayasdasxdsydeayaxsewq&amp;no=32&amp;seite=30 page 10.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Translation of the Latin quote from Kepler's ''Ad Vitellionem paralipomena'' is from:  Gal, O. &amp; Chen-Morris, R.(2005) [http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/2005HisSc..43..391G/0000398.000.html "The Archaeology of the Inverse Square Law: (1) Metaphysical Images and Mathematical Practices,"] ''History of Science'', '''43''' :   391–414 ; see especially p. 397.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Original:  ''Sicut se habent spharicae superificies, quibus origo lucis pro centro est, amplior ad angustiorem:  ita se habet fortitudo seu densitas lucis radiorum in angustiori, ad illamin in laxiori sphaerica, hoc est, conversim.  Nam per 6. 7. tantundem lucis est in angustiori sphaerica superficie, quantum in fusiore, tanto ergo illie stipatior &amp; densior quam hic.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Translation'':  Just as [the ratio of] spherical surfaces, for which the source of light is the center, [is] from the wider to the narrower, so the density or fortitude of the rays of light in the narrower [space], towards the more spacious spherical surfaces, that is, inversely.  For according to [propositions] 6 &amp; 7, there is as much light in the narrower spherical surface, as in the wider, thus it is as much more compressed and dense here than there.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1645 in his book ''Astronomia Philolaica'' …, the French astronomer [[Ismaël Bullialdus]] (1605 – 1694) refuted Johannes Kepler's suggestion that "gravity"&lt;ref&gt;Note:  Kepler's notion of "gravity" was not the modern notion:  Kepler believed that the Sun exerted a force on the planets which propelled them in their orbits around the Sun.  Like beams of light from a light house, this force rotated with the Sun as it turned.&lt;/ref&gt; weakens as the inverse of the distance; instead, Bullialdus argued, "gravity" weakens as the inverse square of the distance:&lt;ref&gt;Ismail Bullialdus, ''Astronomia Philolaica'' … (Paris, France:  Piget, 1645), [http://diglib.hab.de/drucke/2-1-4-astron-2f-1/start.htm?image=00005 page 23.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Translation of the Latin quote from Bullialdus' ''Astronomia Philolaica'' … is from: O'Connor, John J. and Roberson, Edmund F.  (2006)  [http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Boulliau.html "Ismael Boulliau"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130062658/http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Boulliau.html |date=30 November 2016 }}, The MacTutor History of Mathematics Archive,  School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Saint Andrews, Scotland.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Original:  ''Virtus autem illa, qua Sol prehendit seu harpagat planetas, corporalis quae ipsi pro manibus est, lineis rectis in omnem mundi amplitudinem emissa quasi species solis cum illius corpore rotatur:  cum ergo sit corporalis imminuitur, &amp; extenuatur in maiori spatio &amp; intervallo, ratio autem huius imminutionis eadem est, ac luminus, in ratione nempe dupla intervallorum, sed eversa.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Translation'':  As for the power by which the Sun seizes or holds the planets, and which, being corporeal, functions in the manner of hands, it is emitted in straight lines throughout the whole extent of the world, and like the species of the Sun, it turns with the body of the Sun; now, seeing that it is corporeal, it becomes weaker and attenuated at a greater distance or interval, and the ratio of its decrease in strength is the same as in the case of light, namely, the duplicate proportion, but inversely, of the distances [that is, 1/d²].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In England, the Anglican bishop [[Seth Ward (bishop of Salisbury)|Seth Ward]] (1617 – 1689) publicized the ideas of Bullialdus in his critique ''In Ismaelis Bullialdi astronomiae philolaicae fundamenta inquisitio brevis'' (1653) and publicized the planetary astronomy of Kepler in his book ''Astronomia geometrica'' (1656).

In 1663–1664, the English scientist [[Robert Hooke]] was writing his book ''Micrographia'' (1666) in which he discussed, among other things, the relation between the height of the atmosphere and the barometric pressure at the surface.  Since the atmosphere surrounds the earth, which itself is a sphere, the volume of atmosphere bearing on any unit area of the earth's surface is a truncated cone (which extends from the earth's center to the vacuum of space; obviously only the section of the cone from the earth's surface to space bears on the earth's surface).  Although the volume of a cone is proportional to the cube of its height, Hooke argued that the air's pressure at the earth's surface is instead proportional to the height of the atmosphere because gravity diminishes with altitude.  Although Hooke did not explicitly state so, the relation that he proposed would be true only if gravity decreases as the inverse square of the distance from the earth's center.&lt;ref&gt;(Gal &amp; Chen-Morris, 2005), pp. 391–392.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hooke, ''Micrographia'' … (London, England:  John Martyn, 1667), [http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/HistSciTech/HistSciTech-idx?type=goto&amp;id=HistSciTech.HookeMicro&amp;isize=M&amp;submit=Go+to+page&amp;page=227 page 227:]  "[I say a ''Cylinder'', not a piece of a ''Cone'', because, as I may elsewhere shew in the Explication of Gravity, that ''triplicate'' proportion of the shels of a Sphere, to their respective diameters, I suppose to be removed in this case by the decrease of the power of Gravity.]"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Leslie Whetter.jpg|thumb|right|Whetter during the Australasian Antarctic Expedition]]
'''Leslie Hatton Whetter''' (10 December 1888 [[Dunedin]], Otago, New Zealand – 3 December 1955 [[Matakana]], Auckland, New Zealand); was a surgeon and [[Antarctic]] explorer from New Zealand. A graduate of the [[University of Otago]], in 1911 he joined the [[Australasian Antarctic Expedition]] (AAE), led by [[Douglas Mawson]].&lt;ref name="Bio"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 1912, Whetter joined two sledging parties, the first to lay supplies, and the second to explore the area to the west of the Main Base at [[Cape Denison]]. On the second expedition, his party of three [[Manhauling|man-hauled]] a sledge {{convert|158|mi}} from the Cape Denison base, and in the process discovered the first [[meteorite]] to be found in Antarctica. Mawson thought Whetter lazy, and the two clashed several times, Mawson describing Whetter as "not fit for a polar expedition".&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh p. 84"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the AAE, Whetter studied medicine at the [[University of Otago]].&lt;ref name="Bio"/&gt; He was originally selected for the AAE as the surgeon on the expedition's third Antarctic base, but Mawson decided to consolidate the three parties into two Whetter joined the Main Base. With [[Archibald Lang McLean]]—the surgeon originally chosen for the Main Base—as chief medical officer, Whetter assumed responsibility for ensuring the base was adequately stocked with water.&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh p. 84"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh p. 81"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; This involved fetching blocks of ice from the head of a nearby glacier, and piling them on the hut's veranda, ready for use.{{#tag:ref|According to [[Cecil Madigan]], meteorologist at the base, Whetter was given this task "because he was of little use for anything else."&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh p. 84"/&gt;|group="nb"}}&lt;ref name="Mawson p. 84"&gt;Mawson (1996), p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the apparent simplicity of this task, Whetter routinely clashed with Mawson; he told the expedition's leader he had come to Antarctica not to work but to study for exams. On a day when Mawson believed Whetter had been particularly lazy, Mawson wrote in his diary: "Whetter is not fit for a polar expedition ... Of late he has complained of overwork, and he only does an honest 2&amp;nbsp;hours work per day."&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh p. 84"/&gt; Another incident a week later prompted Mawson to tell Whetter "that he was entirely unfit for an expedition, chiefly through lack of determination in character and failing to do his level best."&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh p. 84"/&gt;

[[File:Western survey party.jpg|thumb|left|Madigan, Close and Whetter after the western survey party returned to Cape Denison]]
On 12 September 1912, along with [[Cecil Madigan]] and [[John Close]], Whetter set out on a man-hauled sledging expedition to the west of the base to lay a food depot for the summer sledging season. Battling strong winds, [[crevasse]]s and [[sastrugi]],{{#tag:ref|Large grooves in the ice caused by continuous wind.|group="nb"}}&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh p. 95"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; the party spent a week travelling the {{convert|50|mi}} to lay the depot. Travelling back to base, their tent was torn apart by the wind, and only a hasty repair-job allowed them to return to base uninjured.&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh p. 95"/&gt; Madigan suffered [[frostbite]], Close severe blisters from the {{convert|13|mi|adj=on}}-hike to sanctuary after the destruction of their tent, but Whetter was injured only by Madigan's scissors, which he used to remove Whetter's helmet "when it was so firmly frozen to his face that it was necessary to adopt drastic measures for its removal in order that he could partake of food."&lt;ref name="Mawson p. 130"&gt;Mawson (1996), p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his return to the base, Whetter's supposed laziness continued to put him at odds with Mawson. Eventually Mawson took Whetter to his study to talk it over. According to Mawson's diary, Whetter told him that the leader's insistence on near-constant work had meant several men deliberately worked slowly, to avoid being assigned new tasks. In response, Mawson lowered the work regimen down to six hours a day, and gave the men Sundays off, provided the wind had not let up to the extent that work could be done outside.&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh pp. 96-97"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), pp. 96&amp;ndash;97&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Western party ===
[[File:Leslie Whetter shooting a Weddell seal.jpg|thumb|right|Whetter shoots a [[Weddell seal]]]]
Whetter was chosen to accompany engineer [[Frank Bickerton]] and cartographer [[Alfred Hodgeman]] on a summer sledging party to explore the area to the west of the hut. This Western party would leave base on 3 December and use the [[air-tractor sledge]]—a wingless aeroplane taken on the AAE—haul a train of four sledges. However, the air-tractor broke down after just {{convert|10|mi}}, and the party continued without it.&lt;ref name="Mawson pp. 243-244"&gt;Mawson (1996), pp. 243&amp;ndash;244&lt;/ref&gt; On the third day, man-hauling one of the sledges, the party discovered the [[Adélie Land meteorite]], the first [[meteorite]] to be found in Antarctica.&lt;ref name="Western party"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mawson p. 244"&gt;Mawson (1996), p. 244&lt;/ref&gt;

The same bad weather and sastrugi that had disrupted the spring sledging party continued to cause havoc on the Western party. At times, the wind was so strong that one of the men had to walk behind the sledge, holding taut a line to prevent the sledge swinging broadside. However, it was the sastrugi that damaged the sledge; it hit one ridge so hard the front smashed.&lt;ref name="Mawson pp. 244-246"&gt;Mawson (1996), pp. 244&amp;ndash;246&lt;/ref&gt; The party continued west until 21 December, when a "hurricane" confined them to their tent for four days. Continuing on 26 December, they reached their furthest point from Cape Denison, {{convert|158|mi}}, and turned back.&lt;ref name="Mawson p. 246"&gt;Mawson (1996), p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; Noting that the winds abated somewhat late afternoon, the party began marching at night. Even during the day, visibility was so poor that they missed the depot the spring party had left. The party reached Aladdin's Cave (a hollow in the ice in the plateau above Cape Denison used for shelter and storage) on 17 January, and returned to base a day later.&lt;ref name="Mawson p. 247"&gt;Mawson (1996), p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later life ==
After the expedition ship [[SY Aurora|SY ''Aurora'']] returned the majority of men to Australia in early 1913, Whetter headed back to New Zealand. Aside from being recorded as a member of the [[Royal Society of New Zealand]] in 1944–45, there is little public information about Whetter's life after the AAE; he died aged 67 on 3 December 1955&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.bdmhistoricalrecords.dia.govt.nz/home |title= Historical Records |publisher= Registrar-General |date=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
(the [[Australian Antarctic Division]] suggested he died in the mid-1950s)&lt;ref name="Bio"/&gt;

The [[Whetter Nunatak]], about {{convert|15|km}} to the north-east of Cape Denison, was named for him by Mawson.&lt;ref name="AADC"&gt;{{cite web

This is a list of the origins of computer-related terms or terms used in the computing world (i.e., a '''list of computer term [[etymology|etymologies]]'''). It relates to both [[computer hardware]] and [[computer software]].

Names of many computer terms, especially computer applications, often relate to the function they perform, e.g., a [[compiler]] is an application that ''compiles'' (programming language [[source code]] into the computer's [[machine language]]). However, there are other terms with less obvious origins, which are of etymological interest. This article lists such terms.

* '''[[abnormal end|ABEND]]''' — originally from an [[IBM System/360]] error message, short for "abnormal end".

* '''[[Ada (programming language)|Ada]]''' — named after [[Ada Lovelace]], who is considered by many to be the first programmer.
* '''[[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]]''' — originally chosen from respect for the Native American Indian tribe of [[Apache]]. It was suggested that the name was appropriate, as Apache began as a series of [[Patch (computing)|patch]]es to code written for [[National Center for Supercomputing Applications|NCSA]]'s [[NCSA HTTPd|HTTPd]] [[Daemon (computer software)|daemon]]. The result was "a patchy" server.&lt;ref&gt;

* '''[[Bon (programming language)|Bon]]''' — created by Ken Thompson and named either after his wife Bonnie, or else after "a religion whose rituals involve the murmuring of magic formulas" (a reference to the Tibetan native religion [[Bön]]).&lt;ref name="ritchie" /&gt;
* '''[[booting]]''' or '''[[Bootstrapping (compilers)|bootstrapping]]''' — from the phrase "[[bootstrapping|to pull oneself up by one's bootstraps]]", originally used as a metaphor for any self-initiating or self-sustaining process. Used in computing due to the apparent paradox that a computer must run code to load anything into memory, but code cannot be run until it is loaded.
* '''[[computer bug|bug]]''' — often (but erroneously) credited to [[Grace Hopper]]. In 1946, she joined the [[Harvard University|Harvard]] Faculty at the Computation Laboratory where she traced an error in the [[Harvard Mark II]] to a [[moth]] trapped in a [[relay]]. This bug was carefully removed and taped to the log book.

The 60 bits are dumped into [[magnetic core]]s on six different levels. Thus, if a 1 comes out of position 9, it appears in all six cores underneath.

A [[byte]] was described as consisting of any number of parallel bits from one to six. Thus a byte was assumed to have a length appropriate for the occasion. Its first use was in the context of the input-output equipment of the 1950s, which handled six bits at a time. The possibility of going to 8 bit bytes was considered in August 1956 and incorporated in the design of Stretch shortly thereafter. The first published reference to the term occurred in 1959 in a paper "Processing Data in Bits and Pieces" by [[Gerrit Anne Blaauw|G&amp;nbsp;A&amp;nbsp;Blaauw]], [[Frederick Phillips Brooks, Jr.|F&amp;nbsp;P&amp;nbsp;Brooks&amp;nbsp;Jr]] and [[Werner Buchholz|W&amp;nbsp;Buchholz]] in the ''[[IRE Transactions on Electronic Computers]]'', June 1959, page 121. The notions of that paper were elaborated in Chapter 4 of ''[[#Buchholz-1962|Planning a Computer System (Project Stretch)]]'', edited by W&amp;nbsp;Buchholz, [[McGraw-Hill Book Company]] (1962). The rationale for coining the term was explained there on page 40 as follows:&lt;br/&gt;Byte ''denotes a group of bits used to encode a character, or the number of bits transmitted in parallel to and from input-output units. A term other than ''character'' is used here because a given character may be represented in different applications by more than one code, and different codes may use different numbers of bits (ie, different byte sizes). In input-output transmission the grouping of bits may be completely arbitrary and have no relation to actual characters.

==C==

[[File:Human computers - Dryden.jpg|image|thumb|right|Computer room at Dryden Flight Research Center, 1949]]

* '''[[C (programming language)|C]]''' — a programming language.
:[[Dennis Ritchie]], having improved on the [[B (programming language)|B language]], called his creation ''New B''. He later renamed it ''C''. (See also [[D (programming language)|D]]).

* '''[[C++]]''' — an [[object-oriented]] programming language, a successor to the [[C (programming language)|C]] programming language.
:C++ creator [[Bjarne Stroustrup]] called his new language "C with Classes" and then "new C". The original language began to be called "old C" which was considered insulting to the C community. At this time Rick Mascitti suggested the name C++ as a successor to C.  In C the '++' operator increments the value of the [[variable (programming)|variable]] it is appended to, thus ''C++'' would increment the value of ''C''.

* '''[[computer]]''' — from the [[human computer]]s who carried out [[calculation]]s [[Mental calculation|mentally]] and possibly with [[Mechanical calculator|mechanical]] aids, [[History of computing hardware|now replaced]] by electronic programmable computers.
* '''[[HTTP cookie|cookie]]''' — a packet of information that travels between a browser and the web server.
: The term was coined by [[web browser]] programmer [[Lou Montulli]] after the term "[[magic cookie]]s" used by [[Unix]] programmers. The term "[[magic cookie]]" in turn derives from "[[fortune cookie]]", a cookie with an embedded message.

==D==

* '''[[D (programming language)|D]]''' — a programming language.
:Designed by [[Walter Bright]] as an improved C, avoiding many of the design problems of C (''e.g.'', extensive pointer manipulation, unenforced array boundaries, ''etc.'').

* '''[[Daemon (computing)|daemon]]''' — a process in an operating system that runs in the background.
: It is not an acronym for '''D'''isk '''A'''nd '''E'''xecution '''Mon'''itor: according to the original team that introduced the concept, the use of the word daemon was inspired by the [[Maxwell's demon]] of physics and thermodynamics (an imaginary agent which helped sort molecules with differing velocities and worked tirelessly in the background)&lt;ref&gt;http://ei.cs.vt.edu/~history/Daemon.html&lt;/ref&gt; The term was embraced, and possibly popularized{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}, by the [[Unix]] operating systems which supported multiple background processes: various local (and later Internet) services were provided by daemons. This is exemplified by the [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] mascot, [[John Lasseter]]'s drawing of a friendly [[imp]].

* '''[[Debian]]''' — a [[Linux distribution]].

* '''[[Ethernet]]''' — a [[computer network]]ing technology.
:According to [[Robert Metcalfe]] (one of its initial developers), he devised the name in an early company memo as an [[compound (linguistics)#Semantic classification|endocentric compound]] of "[[luminiferous ether]]"—the "substance" that was widely believed to be the medium through which [[electromagnetic radiation]] propagated in the late 19th century—and "net", short for "[[computer network|network]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|publisher=The Register |title=Ethernet — a &lt;s&gt;networking protocol&lt;/s&gt; name for the ages: Michelson, Morley, and Metcalfe |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/03/13/metcalfe_remembers/page2.html |accessdate=March 4, 2013 |date=March 13, 2009 |author=Cade Metz |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the networking team would describe data flowing into the network infrastructure, they would routinely describe it as data packets going "up into the ether".&lt;ref name="metcalfe video"&gt;{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5MezxMcRmk |title=The History of Ethernet |publisher=NetEvents.tv |date=2006 |accessdate=September 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Finger protocol|finger]]''' — [[Unix]] command that provides information about users logged into a system.
:[[Les Earnest]] wrote the finger program in 1971 to provide for users who wanted information about other users on a network or system.  Before the finger program, the only way to get this information was with a [[Who (Unix)|who]] program that showed IDs and terminal line numbers for logged-in users; people used to run their fingers down the "who" list. Earnest named his program after this phenomenon.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

* '''[[GNU]]''' — a project with an original goal of creating a free [[operating system]].
:The [[Wildebeest|gnu]] is also a species of African antelope.

* '''[[Google]]''' — a [[search engine]].
:The name started as an exaggerated boast about the amount of information the search engine would be able to search. It was originally named '[[Googol]]', a word for the number represented by 1 followed by 100 zeros. The word was originally invented by [[Milton Sirotta]], nephew of mathematician Edward Kasner, in 1938 during a discussion of large numbers and exponential notation.

* '''[[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher]]''' — an early distributed document search and retrieval network protocol on the Internet.
:The source of the name is claimed to be three-fold: first, that it is used to "go-for" information; second, that it does so through a menu of links analogous to [[Gopher (animal)|gopher]] holes; and third, that the mascot of the protocol authors' organization, the University of Minnesota, is [[Golden Gophers|Goldy the Gopher]].{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

* '''[[grep]]''' — a Unix [[command line]] utility
:The name comes from a command in the Unix text editor [[ed (UNIX)|ed]] that takes the form &lt;code&gt; g/re/p &lt;/code&gt; meaning search '''g'''lobally for a '''r'''egular '''e'''xpression and '''p'''rint lines where instances are found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Open Group Base Specifications Issue 7 IEEE Std 1003.1, 2013 Edition Copyright © 2001-2013 The IEEE and The Open Group|url=http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/ed.html#tag_20_38|publisher=The Open Group|accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Grep" like "Google" is often used as a verb, meaning "to search".

==H==

* '''[[Hotmail]]''' — free email service, now part of [[MSN]].
:Founder [[Jack Smith (Hotmail)|Jack Smith]] got the idea of accessing e-mail via the web from a computer anywhere in the world. When [[Sabeer Bhatia]] came up with the business plan for the mail service, he tried all kinds of names ending in '[[mail]]' and finally settled for Hotmail as it included the letters "[[HTML]]" — the markup language used to write web pages. It was initially referred to as HoTMaiL with selective upper casing.

==I==

* '''[[i18n]]''' — short for "'''i'''nternationalizatio'''n'''".
:"18" is for the number of letters between the ''i'' and the ''n''. Related, less common terms include ''l10n'' (for '''l'''ocalizatio'''n'''), ''g11n'' (for '''g'''lobalizatio'''n''') and ''a11y'' (for '''a'''ccessibilit'''y''').

* '''[[ICQ]]''' — an [[instant messaging]] service.
: ICQ is not an [[initialism]]. It is a play on the phrase "I seek you" or "Internet seek you" (similar to [[CQ (call)|CQ]] in ham radio usage).{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

* '''[[ID10T]]''' - pronounced "ID ten T" - is a code frequently used by a customer service representative (CSR) to annotate their notes and identify the source of a problem as the person who is reporting the problem rather than the system being blamed. This is a thinly veiled reference to the CSR's opinion that the person reporting the problem is an IDIOT. Example: Problem reported caused by ID10T, no resolution possible. See also [[PEBKAC]].{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==J==

* '''[[Jakarta Project]]''' — a project constituted by [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] and [[Apache Software Foundation|Apache]] to create a [[web server]] for [[Java (programming language)|Java]] [[Java servlet|servlets]] and [[JavaServer Pages|JSPs]].
:Jakarta was the name of the conference room at Sun where most of the meetings between Sun and Apache took place. The conference room was most likely named after [[Jakarta]], the capital city of [[Indonesia]], which is located on the northwest coast of the island of [[Java (island)|Java]].

* '''[[Java (programming language)|Java]]''' — a programming language.
:Originally called "D", but with the connotation of a near-failing mark on a report card the language was renamed ''Oak'' by Java-creator [[James Gosling]], from the tree that stood outside his window. The programming team at [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] had to look for a substitute name as there was already another programming language called Oak. "Java" was selected from a list of suggestions, primarily because it is a popular slang term for [[Java coffee|coffee]], especially that grown on the island of Java. As the programmers drank a lot of coffee, this seemed an appropriate name.  Many people mistakenly think that Java is an acronym and spell it JAVA.  When one of the original Java programmers from Sun was asked to define JAVA he said it stood for nothing, but if it must stand for something: "'''J'''ust '''A'''nother '''V'''ague '''A'''cronym."

{{anchor|JavaScript}}
* '''[[JavaScript]]''' — a programming language.
:It was originally developed by [[Brendan Eich]] of Netscape under the name "Mocha", which was later renamed to "LiveScript", and finally to "JavaScript".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

JavaScript was first introduced and deployed in the Netscape browser version 2.0B3 in December 1995. The naming has caused confusion, giving the impression that the language is a spin-off of Java, and it has been characterized by many as a marketing ploy by Netscape to give JavaScript the cachet of what was then the hot new web-programming language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* '''[[Kerberos (protocol)|Kerberos]]''' — a [[computer network]] [[authentication]] [[cryptographic protocol|protocol]] that is used by both [[Windows 2000]] and [[Windows XP]] as their default authentication method.
:When created by programmers at [[MIT]] in the 1970s, they wanted a name that suggested high security for the project, so they named it after ''[[Cerberus|Kerberos]]'', in [[Greek mythology]] the three-headed dog guarding the gates of Hades. The reference to Greek mythology is most likely because Kerberos was developed as part of [[Project Athena]].{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==L==

* '''[[Linux]]''' — an operating system [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]], and the common name for many of the operating systems which use it.
:Linux creator [[Linus Torvalds]] originally used the [[MINIX]] [[operating system]] on his computer, didn't like it, liked [[DOS]] less, and started a project to develop an operating system that would address the problems of MINIX. Hence the working name was ''Linux'' (Linus' Minix). Originally, however, Linus had planned to have it named ''Freax'' (''free'' + ''freak'' + ''x''). His friend [[Ari Lemmke]] encouraged Linus to upload it to a network so it could be easily downloaded. Ari gave Linus a directory called ''linux'' on his [[FTP server]], as he did not like the name ''Freax''.

* '''[[Apple Lisa|Lisa]]''' — A [[personal computer]] designed at [[Apple Computer]] during the early 1980s.
:Apple stated that Lisa was an acronym for ''Local Integrated Software Architecture''; however, it is often inferred that the machine was originally named after the daughter of Apple co-founder [[Steve Jobs]], and that this acronym was invented later to fit the name. Accordingly, two humorous suggestions for expanding the acronym included ''Let's Invent Some Acronyms'', and ''Let's Invent Silly Acronyms''.

* '''[[liveware]]''' - computer personnel. 
:A play on the terms "software" and "hardware". Coined in 1966, the word indicates that sometimes the computer problem is not with the computer itself, but with the user.

* '''[[Lotus Software]]''' — Lotus founder [[Mitch Kapor]] got the name for his company from 'The [[Lotus Position]]' ('Padmasana' in [[Sanskrit]]). Kapor used to be a teacher of [[Transcendental Meditation technique]] as taught by [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]].

==M==

* '''[[Macintosh]]''', '''Mac''' — a personal computer from [[Apple Computer]].
:From [[McIntosh (apple)|McIntosh]], a popular type of apple.

==N==

* '''[[Nerd]]''' — A colloquial term for a computer person, especially an obsessive, singularly focused one. Uncertain origin.

==O==

* '''[[Oracle database|Oracle]]''' — a [[relational database management system]] (RDBMS).
:[[Larry Ellison]], Ed Oates and Bob Miner were working on a consulting project for the CIA ([[Central Intelligence Agency]]). The code name for the project was called ''[[Oracle]]'' (the CIA evidently saw this as a system that would give answers to all questions). The project was designed to use the newly written [[SQL]] database language from [[IBM]]. The project eventually was terminated but they decided to finish what they started and bring it to the world. They kept the name ''Oracle'' and created the RDBMS engine.

==P==

* '''[[Pac-Man]]''' — a [[video arcade]] game.
: The term comes from ''paku paku'' which is a Japanese [[onomatopoeia]] used for noisy eating; similar to ''chomp chomp''. The game was released in Japan with the name ''Puck-Man'', and released in the US with the name ''Pac-Man'', fearing that kids may deface a Puck-Man cabinet by changing the ''P'' to an ''F''.

* '''[[PCMCIA]]''' — the standards body for [[PC card]] and [[ExpressCard]], expansion card form factors.
: The '''P'''ersonal '''C'''omputer '''M'''emory '''C'''ard '''I'''nternational '''A'''ssociation is an international standards body that defines and promotes standards for expansion devices such as [[modem]]s and external [[hard disk|hard disk drives]] to be connected to [[notebook computer]]s. Over time, the acronym PCMCIA has been used to refer to the PC card [[Computer form factor|form factor]] used on notebook computers. A twist on the acronym is '''P'''eople '''C'''an't '''M'''emorize '''C'''omputer '''I'''ndustry '''A'''cronyms.

* '''[[PEBKAC]]''' - an acronym for "Problem Exists Between Keyboard And Chair", which is a code frequently used by a customer service representative (CSR) to annotate their notes and identify the source of a problem as the person who is reporting the problem rather than the system being blamed.  This is a thinly veiled reference to the CSR's opinion that the person reporting the problem is the problem. Example: PEBKAC, no resolution possible. See also ''ID10T''.
* '''[[Pentium (brand)|Pentium]]''' — a series of [[microprocessor]]s from [[Intel]].
:The fifth microprocessor in the [[80x86]] series. It would have been called i586 or 80586, but Intel decided to name it ''Pentium'' (penta = five) after it lost a trademark infringement lawsuit against [[AMD]] due to a judgment that numbers like "286", "386", and "486" cannot be trademarked.  According to Intel, ''Pentium'' conveys a meaning of strength, like [[titanium]].{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

:Since some early Pentium chips contained a mathematical precision error, it has been jokingly suggested that the reason for the chip being named Pentium rather than 586 was that Intel chips would calculate 486 + 100 = 585.99999948.

* '''[[Perl]]''' — an [[interpreter (computing)|interpreted]] [[scripting language]].
:Perl was originally named ''Pearl'', after the "pearl of great price" of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 13:46.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} [[Larry Wall]], the creator of Perl, wanted to give the language a short name with positive connotations and claims to have looked at (and rejected) every three- and four-letter word in the dictionary. He even thought of naming it after his wife Gloria. Before the language's official release Wall discovered that there was already a programming language named ''Pearl'', and changed the spelling of the name. Although the original manuals suggested the [[backronym]]s "Practical Extraction and Report Language" and "Pathologically Eclectic Rubbish Lister", these were intended humorously.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

* '''[[PHP]]''' — a server-side [[scripting language]]
:Originally called "'''P'''ersonal '''H'''ome '''P'''age Tools" by creator [[Rasmus Lerdorf]], it was rewritten by developers [[Zeev Suraski]] and [[Andi Gutmans]] who gave it the recursive name "'''P'''HP '''H'''ypertext '''P'''reprocessor". Lerdorf currently insists the name should not be thought of as standing for anything, for he selected "Personal Home Page" as the name when he did not foresee PHP evolving into a general-purpose programming language.

* '''[[Pine (e-mail client)|Pine]]''' — [[e-mail client]].
:Many people believe that Pine stands for "'''P'''ine '''I'''s '''N'''ot [[Elm (email client)|'''E'''lm]]". However, one of its original authors, Laurence Lundblade, insists this was never the case and that it started off simply as a word and not an acronym; his first choice of a [[backronym]] for pine would be "Pine Is Nearly Elm".  Over time it was changed to mean ''Program for Internet News and E-mail''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

:The author of ping, [[Mike Muuss]], named it after the pulses of sound made by a [[sonar]] called a "ping". Later [[David L. Mills|Dave Mills]] provided the backronym "'''P'''acket '''I'''nter'''n'''et '''G'''roper".

* '''[[Python (programming language)|Python]]''' — an [[interpreter (computing)|interpreted]] [[scripting language|scripting]] [[programming language]].
:Named after the television series [[Monty Python's Flying Circus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=General Python FAQ|url=https://docs.python.org/2/faq/general.html#why-is-it-called-python|website=Python.org|publisher=Python Software Foundation|accessdate=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==R==

* '''[[Radio button]]''' — a [[GUI widget]] used for making selections.
:Radio buttons got their name from the preset buttons in [[radio receiver]]s. When one used to select preset stations on a radio receiver physically instead of electronically, depressing one preset button would pop out whichever other button happened to be pushed in.

* '''[[Red Hat Linux]]''' — a [[Linux distribution]] from [[Red Hat]].
:Company founder [[Marc Ewing]] was given the [[Cornell University|Cornell]] [[lacrosse]] team cap (with red and white stripes) by his grandfather while at college. People would turn to him to solve their problems, and he was referred to as "that guy in the red hat". He lost the cap and had to search for it desperately. The manual of the beta version of Red Hat Linux had an appeal to readers to return the hat if found by anyone.

* '''[[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]]''' — an [[symmetry|asymmetric]] [[algorithm]] for [[public key cryptography]].
:Based on the surnames of the authors of this algorithm — [[Ron Rivest|Ron '''R'''ivest]], [[Adi Shamir|Adi '''S'''hamir]] and [[Len Adleman|Len '''A'''dleman]].

==S==

* '''[[Samba (software)|Samba]]''' — a free implementation of [[Microsoft]]'s networking protocol.
:The name ''samba'' comes from inserting two vowels into the name of the standard protocol that Microsoft Windows network file system use, called [[Server message block|SMB]] (Server Message Block). The author searched a dictionary using ''grep'' for words containing S M and B in that order; the only matches were ''Samba'' and ''Salmonberry''.

* '''[[shareware]]''' — coined by [[Bob Wallace]] to describe his word processor PC-Write in early 1983.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Before this [[Jim Knopf]] (also known as Jim Button) and [[Andrew Fluegelman]] called their distributed software "user supported software" and "freeware" respectively, but it was Wallace's terminology that prevailed.
* '''[[Spam (electronic)|spam]]''' — unwanted repetitious messages, such as unsolicited bulk [[e-mail]].
: The term ''spam'' is derived from the [[Monty Python]] [[Spam (Monty Python)|SPAM sketch]], set in a cafe where everything on the menu includes [[Spam (food)|SPAM]] luncheon meat. While a customer plaintively asks for some kind of food without SPAM in it, the server reiterates the SPAM-filled menu. Soon, a chorus of Vikings join in with a song: "SPAM, SPAM, SPAM, SPAM, SPAM, lovely SPAM, wonderful SPAM", over and over again, drowning out all conversation.

* '''[[SPIM]]''' — a simulator for a virtual machine closely resembling the instruction set of [[MIPS architecture|MIPS processors]], is simply MIPS spelled backwards. In recent time, ''spim'' has also come to mean [[Spam (electronic)|'''SP'''am]] sent over [[Instant messaging|'''I'''nstant '''M'''essaging]].
* '''[[Swing (Java)|Swing]]''' — a graphics library for Java.
:''Swing'' was the code-name of the project that developed the new graphic components (the successor of [[Abstract Window Toolkit|AWT]]). It was named after [[swing (dance)|swing]], a style of dance band [[jazz]] that was popularized in the 1930s and unexpectedly revived in the 1990s. Although an unofficial name for the components, it gained popular acceptance with the use of the word in the package names for the Swing API, which begin with &lt;code&gt;javax.swing&lt;/code&gt;.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==T==

* '''[[Jakarta Tomcat|Tomcat]]''' — a [[web server]] from the [[Jakarta Project]].
:''Tomcat'' was the code-name for the JSDK 2.1{{clarify|date=October 2013}} project inside [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]].{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Tomcat started off as a servlet specification implementation by James Duncan Davidson who was a software architect at Sun. Davidson had initially hoped that the project would be made [[open-source software|open-source]], and since most open-source projects had [[O'Reilly Media|O'Reilly]] books on them with an animal on the cover, he wanted to name the project after an animal. He came up with [[cat|Tomcat]] since he reasoned the animal represented something that could take care of and fend for itself.

* '''[[troff]]''' — a document processing system for [[Unix]].
:''Troff'' stands for "'''t'''ypesetter '''roff'''", although many people have speculated that it actually means "Times roff" because of the use of the [[Times New Roman|Times font family]] in troff by default.  Troff has its origins from [[roff (computer program)|roff]], an earlier formatting program, whose name is a contraction of "run off".{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

* '''[[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan horse]]''' — a malicious program that is disguised as legitimate software.
:The term is derived from the classical myth of the [[Trojan Horse]]. Analogously, a Trojan horse appears innocuous (or even to be a gift), but in fact is a vehicle for bypassing security.

* '''[[Tux (mascot)|Tux]]''' — The [[penguin]] now commonly regarded as the most famous logo of the Linux Kernel and its deviants.
:The logo was originally created by [[Larry Ewing]] in 1996 as an entry in a Linux Logo competition. The creator of Linux, [[Linus Torvalds]], was bitten by a [[little penguin]] during a visit to [[National Zoo &amp; Aquarium|Canberra Zoo]] in 1993, which made the penguin his "favourite" animal. The word Tux apparently comes from "(T)orvalds (U)ni(X)".{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}{{original research inline|date=October 2013}}

==U==

* '''[[Ubuntu Linux]]''' — a [[Debian]]-based [[Linux]] distribution sponsored by [[Canonical Ltd.]]
:Derived from [[Ubuntu (ideology)|ubuntu]], a South African ideology.

* '''[[Unix]]''' — an [[operating system]].
:When [[Bell Laboratories|Bell Labs]] pulled out of the [[MULTICS]] (MULTiplexed Information and Computing System) project, which was originally a joint Bell Labs/[[GE]]/[[MIT]] project, [[Ken Thompson]] of Bell Labs, soon joined by [[Dennis Ritchie]], wrote a simpler version of the operating system for a spare DEC minicomputer, allegedly found in a corridor. They needed an OS to run the game ''[[Space Travel (video game)|Space Travel]]'', which had been compiled under MULTICS. The new OS was called UNICS — '''UN'''iplexed '''I'''nformation and '''C'''omputing '''S'''ystem by Brian Kernighan.

==V==

* '''[[vi]]''' — a [[text editor]],
:Initialism for '''vi'''sual, a command in the [[ex (editor)|ex]] editor which helped users to switch to the visual mode from the ex mode. the first version was written by [[Bill Joy]] at UC Berkeley.

* '''[[Vim (text editor)|Vim]]''' — a [[text editor]].
:Acronym for '''V'''i '''im'''proved after Vim added several features over the [[vi]] editor. Vim however had started out as an imitation of Vi and was expanded as '''V'''i '''im'''itation.

* '''[[Computer virus|Virus]]''' — a piece of [[computer program|program code]] that spreads by making copies of itself.
:The term ''virus'' was first used as a technical computer science term by [[Fred Cohen]] in his 1984 paper "Computer Viruses Theory and Experiments", where he credits [[Len Adleman]] with coining it. Although Cohen's use of ''virus'' may have been the first academic use, it had been in the common parlance long before that. A mid-1970s [[science fiction]] novel by [[David Gerrold]], ''When H.A.R.L.I.E. was One'', includes a description of a fictional computer program called ''VIRUS'' that worked just like a virus (and was countered by a program called ''ANTIBODY''). The term "computer virus" also appears in the [[comic book]] "Uncanny [[X-Men]]" No. 158, published in 1982. A computer virus's basic function is to insert its own executable code into that of other existing executable files, literally making it the electronic equivalent to the biological virus, the basic function of which is to insert its genetic information into that of the invaded cell, forcing the cell to reproduce the virus.

==W==

* '''[[Wiki]]''' or '''WikiWiki''' — a hypertext document collection or the [[collaborative software]] used to create it.
:Coined by [[Ward Cunningham]], the creator of the wiki concept, who named them for the "wiki wiki" or "quick" shuttle buses at Honolulu Airport. Wiki wiki was the first [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] term he learned on his first visit to the islands. The airport counter agent directed him to take the wiki wiki bus between terminals.

* '''[[Computer worm|Worm]]''' —  a self-replicating [[computer program|program]], similar to a [[computer virus|virus]].
: The name 'worm' was taken from a 1970s [[science fiction]] novel by [[John Brunner (novelist)|John Brunner]] entitled ''[[The Shockwave Rider]]''. The book describes programs known as "tapeworms" which spread through a network for the purpose of deleting data. Researchers writing an early paper on experiments in distributed computing noted the similarities between their software and the program described by Brunner, and adopted that name.

* '''[[WYSIWYG]]''' - describes a system in which content during editing appears very similar to the final product.
:Acronym for ''What You See Is What You Get'', the phrase was originated by a newsletter published by Arlene and Jose Ramos, called WYSIWYG. It was created for the emerging Pre-Press industry going electronic in the late 1970s.

==X==

* '''[[X Window System]]''' —  a [[windowing system]] for computers with [[bitmap]] displays.
:X derives its name as a successor to a pre-1983 window system called the [[W Window System]].

==Y==

* '''[[Yahoo!]]''' — internet portal and [[web directory]].
:Yahoo!'s history site says the name is an acronym for "Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle", but some remember that in its early days (mid-1990s), when Yahoo! lived on a server called akebono.stanford.edu, it was glossed as "Yet Another Hierarchical Object Organizer." The word "Yahoo!" was originally invented by [[Jonathan Swift]] and used in his book ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]''. It represents a person who is repulsive in appearance and action and is barely human. Yahoo! founders Jerry Yang and David Filo selected the name because they considered themselves yahoos.

==Z==

* '''[[ZIP (file format)|zip]]''' — a [[file format]], also used as a verb to mean ''compress''.
:The file format was created by [[Phil Katz]], and given the name by his friend Robert Mahoney. The compression tool Phil Katz created was called [[PKZIP]]. Zip means "speed", and they wanted to imply their product would be faster than ARC and other compression formats of the time.

This is a '''list of countries and territories by land [[border]]s'''.&lt;ref name="Factbook"/&gt; The number of unique land borders of each country or territory is indicated as well the names of its neighboring countries and territories. The length of each land border is included, as is the total length of each country's and territory's land borders.

Countries or territories that are connected only by [[bridge]]s or other man-made [[causeway]]s are not considered to have land borders. However, borders along lakes, rivers, and other [[internal waters]] are considered land borders for the purposes of this article.  Footnotes are included to provide clarity regarding the status of certain countries and territories.

There are currently [[List of sovereign states#Internationally recognized sovereign states|195 states]] that are generally regarded as "fully" sovereign: this includes the [[United Nations member states|193 member states]] of the [[United Nations]] plus [[Vatican City]] and [[State of Palestine|Palestine]]. Some of these states have under their jurisdiction [[Territory (administrative division)|territories, dependencies, or collectivities]] that are clearly non-sovereign geographical areas. These territories are generally regarded as being subsumed within the overarching sovereignty of the governing state. For example, the [[United Kingdom]] holds sovereignty over the territory of [[Gibraltar]], even though Gibraltar is not considered to be part of the United Kingdom. There are a few territories in the world that are neither clearly sovereign nor clearly subsumed under another state's sovereignty. Often, these territories have declared themselves to be sovereign, but they are either not widely recognized as such or lack some of the necessary conditions for sovereign statehood. In these cases, explanatory footnotes indicate how the territory is treated for the purposes of this list.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;}}

Although Kosovo's sovereignty has been recognized by {{Numrec|Kos|link=N}} UN member states, it is not a member of the [[United Nations]] and Serbia disputes its sovereignty, claiming that Kosovo remains one of its provinces. For purposes of this list, Kosovo is considered to be a sovereign country. If Kosovo is considered part of Serbia, some numbers in the table would be reduced by one (e.g., when a state borders both Serbia and Kosovo). Other numbers would remain the same (e.g., when a state borders Kosovo but not Serbia).&lt;/ref&gt;

|'''''{{flag|Taiwan}}'''''&lt;ref&gt;In 1949, during the [[Chinese Civil War]], the government and leaders of the [[Republic of China]] (ROC), led by [[Chiang Kai-shek]], retreated from mainland China to the island of [[Taiwan]]. In Taiwan, the ROC continues to claim sovereignty over ''all'' China, including the mainland and Taiwan. The [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC), which has governed mainland China since the ROC government retreated, also claims to be the sole representative of ''all'' China, including Taiwan. Even though the ROC government in Taiwan has never asserted that Taiwan's sovereignty is separate from that of China's, for many practical purposes Taiwan is treated by other countries and international organizations as a country that is separate from the PRC. However, Taiwan is not considered to be a sovereign entity that is separate from China for purposes of this list and is not included in other countries' listings of neighbouring countries and territories.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Messier 110''', also known as '''NGC 205''', is a [[dwarf elliptical galaxy]] that is a [[satellite galaxy|satellite]] of the [[Andromeda Galaxy]].&lt;ref name="carnegieatlas"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  M110 contains some dust and hints of recent star formation, which is unusual for dwarf elliptical galaxies in general.&lt;ref name="carnegieatlas" /&gt;

==History==
Although [[Charles Messier]] never included the galaxy in his list, it was depicted by him, together with [[Messier 32|M32]], on a drawing of the [[Andromeda galaxy]]; a label on the drawing indicates that Messier first observed NGC 205 on August 10, 1773.&lt;ref name="jones1991"&gt;
{{cite book
 |author=K.G. Jones
 |date=1991 |edition=2nd
 |title=Messier's Nebulae and Star Clusters
 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]
 |isbn=978-0-521-37079-0
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The galaxy was independently discovered by [[Caroline Herschel]] on August 27, 1783; her brother [[William Herschel]] described her discovery in 1785.&lt;ref name="jones1991" /&gt;  The suggestion to assign the galaxy a Messier number was made by Kenneth Glyn Jones in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;

 |doi=
 |bibcode=1967S&amp;T....33..156J
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few [[nova]]e have been detected in this galaxy, including one discovered
in 1999 by Johnson and Modjaz,&lt;ref name="Bergh2000"&gt;
{{cite journal

and another detected in 2002, by Nakano and Sumoto. The latter, designated EQ J004015.8+414420, had also been captured in images taken by the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] (SDSS) in October, 2002. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forum.astrofili.org/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=68465&amp;start=20|title=Forum di Astronomia Amatoriale Italiano}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike M32, NGC 205 does not (as of 2005) show evidence for a [[supermassive black hole]] at its center.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18764">The '''misery index''' is an [[economic indicator]], created by economist [[Arthur Okun]]. The index helps determine how the average citizen is doing economically and it is calculated by adding the seasonally adjusted [[unemployment rate]] to the annual [[inflation rate]]. It is assumed that both a higher rate of unemployment and a worsening of [[inflation]] create economic and social costs for a country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inflationdata.com/articles/misery-index/|title=The US Misery Index|work=Inflationdata.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations==

Harvard Economist [[Robert Barro]] created what he dubbed the "Barro Misery Index" (BMI), in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/1999-02-21/reagan-vs-dot-clinton-whos-the-economic-champ|title=Reagan Vs. Clinton: Who's The Economic Champ?|author=Robert J. Barro |work=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BMI takes the sum of the inflation and unemployment rates, and adds to that the interest rate, plus (minus) the shortfall (surplus) between the actual and trend rate of GDP growth.

In the late 2000s, Johns Hopkins economist [[Steve Hanke]] built upon Barro's misery index and began applying it to countries beyond the United States. His modified misery index is the sum of the interest, inflation, and unemployment rates, minus the year-over-year percent change in per-capita GDP growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/misery-mena|title=Misery in MENA|author=Steve H. Hanke|date=March 2011|publisher=Cato Institute: appeared in ''Globe Asia''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hanke has recently constructed a World Table of Misery Index Scores by exclusively relying on data reported by the Economist Intelligence Unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/measuring-misery-around-world|title=Measuring Misery around the World|author=Steve H. Hanke|date=May 2014|publisher=Cato Institute: appeared in ''Globe Asia''}}&lt;/ref&gt; This table includes a list of 89 countries, ranked from worst to best, with data as of December 31, 2013 (see table below).

Political economists [[Jonathan Nitzan]] and [[Shimshon Bichler]] found a negative correlation between a similar "stagflation index" and corporate amalgamation (i.e. [[mergers and acquisitions]]) in the United States since the 1930s. In their theory, stagflation is a form of political economic sabotage employed by corporations to achieve [[differential accumulation]], in this case as an alternative to amalgamation when merger and acquisition opportunities have run out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://bnarchives.yorku.ca/259/|title=Capital as Power: A Study of Order and Creorder|authors=Nitzan and Bichler|year=2009|pages=384–386|publisher=Routledge|series=RIPE Series in Global Political Economy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

A 2001 paper looking at large-scale surveys in Europe and the United States concluded that unemployment more heavily influences unhappiness than inflation. This implies that the basic misery index underweights the unhappiness attributable to the unemployment rate: "the estimates suggest that people would trade off a 1-percentage-point increase in the unemployment rate for a 1.7-percentage-point increase in the inflation rate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Di Tella, Rafael; MacCulloch, Robert J. and [[Andrew Oswald|Oswald, Andrew]]|year=2001|url=http://www.people.hbs.edu/rditella/papers/AERHappyInflation.pdf|title=Preferences over Inflation and Unemployment: Evidence from Surveys of Happiness|journal=[[American Economic Review]]|volume=91|issue=1|pages=335–341, 340}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Misery and crime==
Some economists{{who|date=August 2018}} posit that the components of the Misery Index drive the crime rate to a degree.  Using data from 1960 to 2005, they have found that the Misery Index and the crime rate correlate strongly and that the Misery Index seems to lead the crime rate by a year or so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/ecolet/v102y2009i2p112-115.html|title=New evidence from the misery index in the crime function|authors=Tang, Chor Foon Lean, Hooi Hooi|volume=102|issue=2|pages=112–115|doi=10.1016/j.econlet.2008.11.026}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the correlation is so strong that the two can be said to be [[cointegration|cointegrated]], and stronger than correlation with either the unemployment rate or inflation rate alone.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Data sources==

The data for the misery index is obtained from [[unemployment]] data published by the [[U.S. Department of Labor]] ([https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/UNRATE U3]) and the [[Inflation|Inflation Rate]] ([https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/CPIAUCNS/ CPI-U]) from the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]].  The exact methods used for measuring unemployment and inflation have changed over time, although past data is usually normalized so that past and future metrics are comparable.

'''''Of a Fire on the Moon''''' ({{ISBN|0-316-54411-6}}, {{OCLC|101602}}) is a work of non-fiction by [[Norman Mailer]] which was serialised in [[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] magazine in 1969 and 1970, and published in 1970 as a book. It is a documentary and reflection on the [[Apollo 11|Apollo 11 moon landing]] from Mailer's point of view.

==Writing and publication==
[[File:Norman Mailer Life Magazine Cover August 1969.jpg|thumb|150px|left|''A Fire on the Moon'' first appeared in August 1969]]
After spending time at the [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|space center]] and [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center|mission control]] in Houston, and witnessing the launch of the [[Saturn V]] at [[Cape Kennedy]] in Florida, Mailer began writing his account of the historic voyage at his home in [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]] during marathon writing sessions to meet his deadlines for the magazine.

In a foreword to Mailer's first installment, ''Life'' Managing Editor Ralph Graves introduced "some 26,000 words—the longest non-fiction piece Life has ever published in one issue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=j0wEAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=life+magazine+archives+online&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6onFTNDxOIm4sQPCwtG2BA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwCDiWAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title = Editor's Note, 'Norman Mailer at the typewriter' | first = Ralph | last = Graves | date = 1969-08-29 | publisher = Life magazine, Vol. 67, No. 9 | page = 1 | accessdate = 2010-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 26, 1970, after the magazine series had concluded, Mailer wrote to Apollo 11 commander, [[Neil Armstrong]], "I've worked as assiduously as any writer I know to portray the space program in its largest, not its smallest, dimension".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/non-fiction/article6728306.ece | title = Moonfire meteorite book brings lunar landing home at sky-high price | first = Jacqui | last = Goddard | date = 2009-07-29 | publisher = The Sunday Times | accessdate = 2010-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/enews/2009/july/moon.html | title = Norman Mailer: Of a Fire on the Moon | publisher = Harry Ransom Center, University of Texas | accessdate = 2010-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His account was published as a book called ''Of a Fire on the Moon'' in 1970. In the UK, it was published with its original article title, ''A Fire on the Moon''.

==Various interpretations and meanings==
''Of a Fire on the Moon'', published in three installments by ''Life'' magazine, later becoming a full book, chronicles the U.S. moon launch of 1969 through the eyes of Norman Mailer’s third-person view of himself. Through this third-person view, Mailer describes the space launches from his point of view as seasoned reporter who has seen America ‘come of age’ since the end of the [[Second World War]]. Additionally, Mailer strings in short "time machines" (as made popular in his literary debut, ''[[The Naked and the Dead]]'') which provide insight from fictional American families as they view the news coverage and actual moon launch. By providing the reader with multiple illustrations of the moon launch, the reader is able to see what the monumental moment means to different Americans. For some of the depicted characters, it is as simple as the epitome of American ingenuity and superiority in the context of the Cold War with the Soviet Union. Mailer’s third-person depiction illustrates an amalgamation of emotions that combines the awe of the scientific feat with the fear of the ever-increasing power of the human race. To Mailer, the moon launch is much more than an accomplishment of the United States, nor is it a move to conquer the Space Race with the Soviet Union. He sees it as a triumph for all humankind, a bold statement in the face of the "creator". By landing men on a celestial object such as the moon, humans are seen as rejecting the omniscient power of a higher entity, almost saying, “Look how far we have come.”

Mailer’s generation has experienced the industrial slaughter of humans with the [[Holocaust]], the immediate flattening of modern cities with the [[atomic bomb]], and now the landing of men on the moon, a seemingly impossible task only a few decades prior. Therefore, the reader can understand why Mailer sees the moon launch as a potentially dangerous step for humankind, forcing one to think not solely about America’s role at the turn of the decade, but the future of humankind on Earth. While ''Of a Fire on the Moon'' takes time to praise NASA in the aftermath of the successful moon launch, its poignant publication in the months following the launch comes as a sobering blow to the consciousness of Americans who have yet to dissect the moon launch as anything other than a moment of American supremacy.

==$112,500 coffee table edition==
The 40th anniversary of the first moon landing was marked in 2009 by the release of an abridged, limited edition of the text, re-packaged with images from [[NASA]] and ''Life'' magazine. This production retitled the work, '''''MoonFire''''', and was presented in an aluminium box with a lid shaped like the crater-pocked surface of the moon; the object was mounted on four legs resembling [[lunar module]] struts. Thus, the coffee table book came inside its own lunar-themed "coffee table", with an uneven surface &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[http://www.taschen.com/media/images/640/default_ce_mailer_moon_rock_table_01_1002161704_id_310270.jpg (see photograph)]&lt;/span&gt;. The package included a numbered print of the [[:File:Aldrin Apollo 11 original.jpg|famous portrait]] of [[Buzz Aldrin]] standing on the moon, framed in &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/plexiglass plexiglass]&lt;/span&gt; and signed by the astronaut himself—and enclosed a [[lunar meteorite]]. Only 12 were created and the price was $112,500.&lt;ref name="huff" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.taschen.com/pages/en/catalogue/artists_editions/all/06329/facts.norman_mailer_moonfire_lunar_rock_edition_no_1962.htm | title = Norman Mailer, MoonFire, Lunar Rock Edition, No. 1,962 | publisher = Taschen | accessdate = 2010-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Norman Mailer died two years before the package was launched.

A conventional hard back edition of the same volume was released in 2015.

==Painting on first edition cover==

The painting on the cover of the first edition ([[Little, Brown &amp; Co]], 1970) is ''Le Monde Invisible'', a 1954 oil painting by [[René Magritte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wikiart.org/en/rene-magritte/invisible-world-1954 | title = Invisible world | publisher = wikiart.org | accessdate = 2015-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mailer describes seeing this painting in Chapter 5 ("A Dream of the Future's Face") of the first part ("Aquarius"). "In the foyer was a painting by Magritte, a startling image of a room with an immense rock situated in the center of the floor." The 1970 dust jacket cites that the painting is part of a private collection.

'''Osteosynthesis''' is the [[Reduction (orthopedic surgery)|reduction]] and [[internal fixation]] of a [[bone fracture]] with implantable [[Implant (medicine)|devices]] that are usually made of metal. It is a surgical procedure with an open or per cutaneous approach to the fractured bone. Osteosynthesis aims to bring the fractured bone ends together and immobilize the fracture site while healing takes place. In a fracture that is rigidly immobilized the fracture heals by the process of [[intramembranous ossification]].

The [[Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Osteosynthesefragen]] is a major organisation dealing with issues of osteosynthesis.

'''[[Packaging]] engineering''', also '''package engineering''', '''packaging technology''' and '''packaging science''', is a broad topic ranging from design conceptualization to product placement.  All steps along the manufacturing process, and more, must be taken into account in the design of the package for any given product.  Package engineering includes industry-specific aspects of [[industrial engineering]],  [[marketing]],  [[materials science]], [[industrial design]] and [[logistics]].  Packaging engineers must interact with research and development, manufacturing, marketing, graphic design, regulatory, purchasing, planning and so on.  The package must sell and protect the product, while maintaining an efficient, cost-effective process cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Engineers develop packages from a wide variety of rigid and flexible materials.  Some materials have scores or creases to allow controlled folding into package shapes (sometimes resembling [[origami]]&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;).  Packaging involves [[extrusion]], [[thermoforming]], [[molding (process)|molding]] and other processing technologies.  Packages are often developed for high speed fabrication, filling, processing, and shipment.  Packaging engineers use principles of [[structural analysis]] and [[thermal analysis]] in their evaluations.

==Education==
Some [[packaging]] engineers have backgrounds in other [[science]], [[engineering]], or [[design]] disciplines while some have college degrees specializing in this field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.packworld.com/schools|title=Packaging Directory-Packaging Schools|access-date=14 Feb 2015 |last= |first= |publisher=Packaging  world}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formal packaging programs might be listed as package engineering, packaging science, packaging technology, etc.  BE, BS, MS, M.Tech and PhD programs are available.  Students in a packaging program typically begin with generalized science, business, and engineering classes before progressing into industry-specific topics such as [[shelf life]] stability, [[corrugated box design]], [[cushioning]], [[engineering design]], labeling regulations,  [[project management]], [[food safety]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lee |first= Ki-Eun|authorlink= |author2=Kim, An |author3=Lyu, Lee|date=November 1998 |title=Effectiveness of modified atmosphere packaging in preserving a prepared ready-to-eat food|journal=Packaging Technology and Science|volume=21 |issue=7 |pages= 417–423|url= |accessdate= |quote= |doi=10.1002/pts.821 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[robotics]], [[RFID]] tags, [[quality management]], [[package testing]], packaging machinery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Braglia|first= Maracello|authorlink= |author2=Frosolini, Montanari|date=January 2003 |title=Fuzzy logic controller in a packaging plant|journal=Packaging Technology and Science|volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=1–45 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |doi=10.1002/pts.608 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hicks |first= A.

The '''Plan Zuid''' ("South Plan") is an urban development plan of [[Amsterdam-Zuid|Amsterdam South]] in the city of [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]], designed by architect [[Hendrik Petrus Berlage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.artzuid.nl/en/plan-zuid/ | title=Plan Zuid (1917) | publisher=[http://www.artzuid.nl/en/ artzuid.nl] | accessdate=20 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Berlage was responsible for the urban concept (1915) and the architects of the [[Amsterdam School]] (partly [[Expressionist architecture|expressionist]] architects) designed the implementation of the plan.

Some years later Berlage was one of the leading architects of a new urban plan in Amsterdam, called [[Plan West (Amsterdam)|Plan West]] (1922-1927). Here Berlage designed the center of Plan West, the architecture of the Mercatorplein (main square), see below.

==First project==

At the beginning of the 20th century, Berlage was asked by the [[Amsterdam]] city council to design a plan for developing the undeveloped area south of the city between the rivers [[Amstel]] and [[Schinkel (river)|Schinkel]]. In 1904, Berlage presented an ambitious plan of winding streets, which was closely joined to the existing city. After research showed that this plan would be very costly and inefficient, Berlage was asked to go back to the drawing board.

==Final project==

Berlage presented a new plan in 1915, with straight narrow streets and long [[urban block|blocks]], intersected by several broad axes. This plan proved much more feasible and efficient. In 1917 the City Council granted approval to the plan. The New South district was built in the style of the [[Amsterdam School]] between 1917 and 1925, consisting of the Stadium District and the Apollo and the Rivers District. A large part of the New Pipe derives from the Plan Zuid.

Berlage's design was only roughly implemented. On the spot where he had planned a teaching hospital, a large housing association designed by [[Michel de Klerk]] and [[Piet Kramer]] called "De Dageraad" (The Dawn) housing complex was built. It was opened in July 1922 by the alderman festive Housing, SR de Miranda.

'''Puberty''' is the process of physical changes through which a [[child]]'s [[Human body|body]] matures into an [[adult]] body capable of [[sexual reproduction]]. It is initiated by [[hormone|hormonal]] signals from the [[brain]] to the [[gonad]]s: the [[ovary|ovaries]] in a girl, the [[testis|testes]] in a boy. In response to the signals, the gonads produce hormones that stimulate [[libido]] and the growth, function, and transformation of the brain, [[bone]]s, [[muscle]], [[blood]], [[skin]], [[human hair growth|hair]], [[breast]]s, and [[sex organ]]s. [[Human development (biology)|Physical growth]]—height and weight—accelerates in the first half of puberty and is completed when an adult body has been developed. Until the maturation of their reproductive capabilities, the pre-pubertal physical differences between boys and girls are the external sex organs.

On average, girls begin puberty around ages 10–11 and end puberty around 15–17; boys begin around ages 11–12 and end around 16–17.&lt;ref name="Kail"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kail |first=RV |author2=Cavanaugh JC |title=Human Development: A Lifespan View |isbn=978-0495600374 |publisher=[[Cengage Learning]] |year=2010 |accessdate=September 11, 2014 |page=296 |edition=5th |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E-n5E7oyCgoC&amp;pg=PA296#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pamf.org"&gt;"For girls, puberty begins around 10 or 11 years of age and ends around age 16.

Notable among the [[morphology (biology)|morphologic]] changes in size, shape, composition, and functioning of the pubertal body, is the development of [[secondary sex characteristic]]s, the "filling in" of the child's body; from girl to woman, from boy to man. Derived from the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|puberatum}}'' (age of maturity), the word ''puberty'' describes the physical changes to sexual maturation, not the [[psychosocial]] and cultural maturation denoted by the term ''adolescent development'' in [[Western culture]], wherein [[adolescence]] is the period of mental transition from childhood to [[adult]]hood, which overlaps much of the body's period of puberty.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology'', C. T. Onions ed. Oxford University Press, 1996, p. 720.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the most significant differences between puberty in girls and puberty in boys are the age at which it begins, and the major [[sex steroid]]s involved, the testosterones and the estrogens.

Although there is a wide range of normal ages, girls typically begin the process of puberty at age 10 or 11; boys at ages 11–12.&lt;ref name="Kail" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pamf.org" /&gt; Girls usually complete puberty by ages 15–17,&lt;ref name="pamf.org" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pamf.org" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Puberty" /&gt; while boys usually complete puberty by ages 16–17.&lt;ref name="pamf.org" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pamf.org" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marshall17677" /&gt; Girls attain reproductive maturity about four years after the first physical changes of puberty appear.&lt;ref name="Puberty" /&gt; In contrast, boys accelerate more slowly but continue to grow for about six years after the first visible pubertal changes.&lt;ref name="Garn"&gt;Garn, SM. Physical growth and development. In: Friedman SB, Fisher M, Schonberg SK., editors. Comprehensive Adolescent Health Care. St Louis: Quality Medical Publishing; 1992. Retrieved on 2009-02-20&lt;/ref&gt; Any increase in height beyond the post-pubertal age is uncommon.

For boys, the [[androgen]] [[testosterone]] is the principal [[sex hormone]]; while testosterone is produced, all boys' changes  are characterized as [[virilization]]. A substantial product of testosterone metabolism in males is [[estradiol]]. The conversion of testosterone to estradiol depends on the amount of body fat and estradiol levels in boys are typically much lower than in girls. The male "growth spurt" also begins later, accelerates more slowly, and lasts longer before the [[epiphyses]] fuse. Although boys are on average {{convert|2|cm|in|1}} shorter than girls before puberty begins, adult men are on average about {{convert|13|cm|in}} taller than women. Most of this sex difference in adult heights is attributable to a later onset of the growth spurt and a slower progression to completion, a direct result of the later rise and lower adult male levels of estradiol.&lt;ref name=abbassi1998&gt;{{cite journal | author = Abbassi V | title = Growth and normal puberty. | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 102 | issue = 2 Pt 3 | pages = 507–513 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9685454 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hormone that dominates female development is an [[estrogen]] called [[estradiol]]. While estradiol promotes growth of the breasts and [[uterus]], it is also the principal hormone driving the pubertal growth spurt and [[epiphyses|epiphyseal]] maturation and closure.&lt;ref name=macgillivray1998&gt;{{cite journal | author = MacGillivray MH, Morishima A, Conte F, Grumbach M, Smith EP | title = Pediatric endocrinology update: an overview. The essential roles of estrogens in pubertal growth, epiphyseal fusion and bone turnover: lessons from mutations in the genes for aromatase and the estrogen receptor | journal = Hormone Research | volume = 49 Suppl 1 | pages = 2–8 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9554463 | last2 = Morishima | last3 = Conte | last4 = Grumbach | last5 = Smith | doi = 10.1159/000053061 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Estradiol levels rise earlier and reach higher levels in women than in men.

The hormonal maturation of females is considerably more complicated than in boys. The main [[steroid hormone]]s, testosterone, estradiol, and progesterone as well as [[prolactin]] play important physiological functions in puberty.
Gonadal steroidgenesis in girls starts with production of testosterone which is typically quickly converted to estradiol inside the ovaries. However the rate of conversion from testosterone to estradiol (driven by FSH/LH balance) during early puberty is highly individual, resulting in very diverse development patterns of [[secondary sexual characteristics]]. Production of progesterone in the ovaries begins with the development of ovulatory cycles in girls (during the lutheal phase of the cycle), before puberty low levels of [[progesterone]] are produced in the adrenal glands of both boys and girls.

==Puberty onset==
Puberty is preceded by [[adrenarche]], marking an increase of adrenal androgen production between ages 6–10. Adrenarche is  sometimes accompanied by the early appearance of axillary and pubic hair. The first androgenic hair resulting from adrenarche can be also transient and disappear before the onset of true puberty.

The onset of puberty is associated with high [[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone|GnRH]] pulsing, which precedes the rise in sex hormones, [[Luteinizing Hormone|LH]] and [[Follicle Stimulating Hormone|FSH]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Plant TM | title = Leptin, growth hormone, and the onset of primate puberty. | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 86 | issue = 1 | pages = 458–460 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11232044 | doi = 10.1210/jc.86.1.459 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Exogenous GnRH pulses cause the onset of puberty.&lt;ref&gt;Essential Reproduction, M Johnson, Blackwell Publishers, 6th Rev Ed edition (29 Jun 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Brain tumors which increase GnRH output may also lead to premature puberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Precocious Puberty |publisher=MERCK |url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/pediatrics/endocrine_disorders_in_children/precocious_puberty.html?qt=&amp;sc=&amp;alt= |date=May 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cause of the GnRH rise is unknown. [[Leptin]] might be the cause of the GnRH rise. Leptin has receptors in the hypothalamus which synthesizes GnRH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Meister B, Håkansson ML | title = Leptin receptors in hypothalamus and circumventricular organs | journal = Clinical and Experimental Pharmacology &amp; Physiology | volume = 28 | issue = 7 | pages = 610–617 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11458889 | doi = 10.1046/j.1440-1681.2001.03493.x | last2 = Håkansson }}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who are deficient in leptin fail to initiate puberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Clayton PE, Trueman JA | title = Leptin and puberty | journal = Archives of Disease in Childhood | volume = 83 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–4 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10868988 | pmc = 1718397 | doi = 10.1136/adc.83.1.1 | last2 = Trueman }}&lt;/ref&gt; The levels of leptin increase with the onset of puberty, and then decline to adult levels when puberty is completed. The rise in GnRH might also be caused by genetics. A study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Topaloglu AK, Reimann F, Guclu M, Yalin AS, Kotan LD, Porter KM, Serin A, Mungan NO, Cook JR, Ozbek MN, Imamoglu S, Akalin NS, Yuksel B, O'Rahilly S, Semple RK | title = TAC3 and TACR3 mutations in familial hypogonadotropic hypogonadism reveal a key role for Neurokinin B in the central control of reproduction | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 41 | issue = 3 | pages = 354–358 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19079066 | doi = 10.1038/ng.306 | display-authors = 8 | last2 = Reimann | last3 = Guclu | last4 = Yalin | last5 = Kotan | last6 = Porter | last7 = Serin | last8 = Mungan | last9 = Cook | last10 = Ozbek | last11 = Imamoglu | last12 = Akalin | last13 = Yuksel | last14 = O'Rahilly | last15 = Semple | pmc = 4312696 }}&lt;/ref&gt; discovered that a mutation in genes encoding both [[Neurokinin B]] as well as the Neurokinin B receptor can alter the timing of puberty. The researchers hypothesized that Neurokinin B might play a role in regulating the secretion of [[Kisspeptin]], a compound responsible for triggering direct release of [[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone|GnRH]] as well as indirect release of [[Luteinizing Hormone|LH]] and [[Follicle Stimulating Hormone|FSH]].

=== Effects of early and late puberty onset ===
Several studies about puberty have examined the effects of an early or a late onset of puberty in males and females. In general, girls who enter puberty late experience positive outcomes in adolescence and adulthood while girls who enter puberty early experience negative outcomes. Boys who have earlier pubertal timing generally have more positive outcomes in adulthood but more negative outcomes in adolescence, while the reverse is true for later pubertal timing.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Invitation to the Life Span|last = Berger|first = Kathleen Stassen|publisher = Worth Publishers|year = 2014|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Girls ====

Outcomes have generally indicated that early onset of puberty in girls can be psychologically damaging. The main reason for this detrimental effect is the issue of [[body image]]. As they physically develop, gaining weight in several areas of the body, early-maturing girls usually look larger than girls who have not yet entered puberty. A result of the social pressure to be thin, the early-maturing girls develop a negative view of their body image. In addition, people may tease the girls about their visible breasts, forcing the early-maturing girl to hide her breasts by dressing differently. Embarrassment about a more developed body may also result in the refusal to undress for gym. These experiences lead to lower self-esteem, more depression and poorer body image in these early-maturing girls.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Furthermore, as physical and emotional differences set them apart from people in their same age group, early-maturing girls develop relationships with older people. For instance, some early-maturing girls have older boyfriends, "attracted to the girls' womanly physique and girlish innocence."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While having an older boyfriend might improve popularity among peers, it also increases the risk of alcohol and drug use, increased sexual relations (often unprotected), eating disorders and bullying.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Generally, later onset of puberty in girls produces positive outcomes. They exhibit positive behaviors in adolescence that continue to adulthood.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Boys ====
In the past, early onset of puberty in boys has been associated with positive outcomes, such as leadership in high school and success in adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = A Longitudinal Investigation of Associations Between Boys' Pubertal Timing and Adult Behavioral Health and Well-Being|last = Taga|first = Keiko A.|date = 3 May 2006|journal = Journal of Youth and Adolescence|accessdate = |doi = 10.1007/s10964-006-9039-4|volume=35|issue = 3|pages=380–390}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, recent studies have revealed that the risks and problems of early maturation in males might outweigh the benefits.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Early-maturing boys develop "more aggressive, law-breaking, and alcohol abusing" behaviors, which result in anger towards parents and trouble in school and with the police. Early puberty also correlates with increased sexual activity and a higher instance of teenage pregnancy, both of which can lead to depression and other psychosocial issues.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  However, early puberty might also result in positive outcomes, such as popularity among peers, higher self-esteem and confidence, as a result of physical developments, such as taller height, developed muscles, muscular male breast and better athletic ability.

On the other hand, late-maturing boys develop lower self-esteem and confidence and generally have lower popularity among peers, due to their less-developed physiques. Also, they experience problems with anxiety and depression and are more likely to be afraid of sex than other boys.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Changes in males==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2009}}
{{see also|Tanner scale}}

===Size and virility===
In boys, testicular enlargement is the first physical manifestation of puberty (and is termed [[gonadarche]]).&lt;ref&gt;Styne (2002), p. 598&lt;/ref&gt; [[Testes]] in prepubertal boys change little in size from about 1 year of age to the onset of puberty, averaging about 2–3&amp;nbsp;cm in length and about 1.5–2&amp;nbsp;cm in width. The size of the testicles is among the parameters of the [[Tanner scale#Genitals (male)|Tanner scale for male genitals]], from stage I which represents a volume of less than 1.5 ml, to stage V which represents a testicular volume of greater than 20 ml. Testicular size reaches maximal adult size about 6 years after the onset of puberty.  While 18–20&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is an average adult size, there is wide variation in testicular size in the normal population.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall (1986), p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; After the boy's testicles have enlarged and developed for about one year, the length and then the breadth of the shaft of the [[human penis|penis]] will increase and the [[glans penis]] and corpora cavernosa will also start to enlarge to adult proportions.&lt;ref name=jonessmiths&gt;{{Cite book|author=Jones, Kenneth W.|title=Smith's Recognizable Patterns of Human Malformation|publisher=Elsevier Saunders|location=St. Louis, Mo|year=2006|pages=|isbn=978-0-7216-0615-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The testes have two primary functions: to produce [[hormone]]s and to produce [[spermatozoon|sperm]]. The [[Leydig cell]]s produce [[testosterone]], which in turn produces most of the male pubertal changes. Most of the increasing bulk of testicular tissue is spermatogenic tissue (primarily [[Sertoli cell|Sertoli]] and [[Leydig cell]]s).

===Male musculature and body shape===
By the end of puberty, adult men have heavier [[bone]]s and nearly twice as much skeletal [[muscle]]. Some of the bone growth (e.g. shoulder width and jaw) is disproportionately greater, resulting in noticeably different male and female skeletal shapes. The average adult male has about 150% of the lean body mass of an average female, and about 50% of the body fat.

This muscle develops mainly during the later stages of puberty, and muscle growth can continue even after boys are biologically adult. The peak of the so-called "strength spurt", the rate of muscle growth, is attained about one year after a male experiences his peak growth rate.

Often, the fat pads of the male breast tissue and the male nipples will develop during puberty; sometimes, especially in one breast, this becomes more apparent and is termed [[gynecomastia]]. It is usually not a permanent phenomenon.

===Erections===
[[Erection]]s during sleep or when waking up are medically known as [[nocturnal penile tumescence]] and colloquially referred to as ''morning wood''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://h2g2.com/approved_entry/A12219374 h2g2 - The Morning Glory (or Nocturnal Penile Tumescence)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The penis can regularly get erect during sleep and men or boys often wake up with an erection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5f8mQx7ULs4C&amp;pg=PA149&amp;dq=&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=u1TwTu20EYTc8QOEmPiiAQ&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Sexuality Now: Embracing Diversity: Embracing Diversity - Janell L.

===Foreskin retraction===
During puberty, if not before, the tip and opening of a boy's [[foreskin]] becomes wider, progressively allowing for retraction down the shaft of the [[Human penis|penis]] and behind the [[glans penis|glans]], which ultimately should be possible without pain or difficulty. The membrane that bonds the inner surface of the foreskin with the glans disintegrates and releases the foreskin to separate from the glans. The foreskin then gradually becomes retractable.&lt;ref name="Øster"&gt;{{vcite journal | author = Øster J | title = Further Fate of the Foreskin: Incidence of Preputial Adhesions, Phimosis, and Smegma among Danish Schoolboys | journal = Arch Dis Child | volume = 43 | pages = 200–202 | date = April 1968 | pmid = 5689532 | pmc = 2019851 | doi = 10.1136/adc.43.228.200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research by Øster (1968) found that with the onset and continuation of puberty, the proportion of boys able to pull back their foreskins increased. At ages 12–13, Øster found that only 60% of boys were able to retract their foreskins; this increased to 85% by ages 14–15, and 95% by 16–17. He also found that 1% of those unable to fully retract experienced [[phimosis]] at ages 14–17, the remainder were partially able to.&lt;ref name="Øster" /&gt; The findings were supported by further research by Kayaba ''et al'' (1996) on a sample of over 600 boys,&lt;ref name="Kayaba"&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Kayaba H, Tamura H, Kitajima S, Fujiwara Y, Kato T, Kato T | title = Analysis of Shape and Retractability of the Prepuce in 603 Japanese Boys | journal = J Urol | volume = 156 | issue = 5 | pages = 1813–1815 | date = November 1996 | pmid = 8863623 | doi = 10.1016/S0022-5347(01)65544-7 | publisher = American Urological Association, Inc. | others = Hiromi Tamura, Seiichi Kitajima, Yoshiyuki Fujiwara, Tetsuo Kato and Tetsuro Kato }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ishikawa and Kawakita (2004) found that by age 15, 77% of their sample of boys could retract their foreskins.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal| author =Ishikawa E, Kawakita M |last2=. |title=Preputial development in Japanese boys |journal= Hinyokika Kiyo |year= 2004 |volume=50 |issue=5 |pages=305–8|pmid= 15237481}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Beaugé (1997) reports that boys may assist the development of retractile foreskin by manual stretching.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |

Once a boy is able to retract his foreskin, penile hygiene should become an important feature of his routine body care. Although the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] states there is "little evidence to affirm the association between circumcision status and optimal penile hygiene",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Circumcision Policy Statement | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 103 | issue = 3 | pages = 686–93 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10049981 | doi = 10.1542/peds.103.3.686 }}&lt;/ref&gt; various studies suggest that boys be educated about the role of hygiene, including retracting the foreskin while urinating and rinsing under it and around the glans at each bathing opportunity. Regular washing under the foreskin was found by Krueger and Osborn (1986) to reduce the risk of numerous penile disorders,&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Krueger H, Osborn L | title = Effects of hygiene among the uncircumcised. | journal = J Fam Pract | volume = 22 | issue = 4 | pages = 353–5 | year = 1986 | pmid = 3958682 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however Birley et al. (1993) report excessive washing with soap should be avoided because it dries the oils out of the tissues and can cause non-specific dermatitis.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal | author=Birley HDL, Luzzi GA, Bell R | title= Clinical features and management of recurrent balanitis: association with atopy and genital washing | journal=Genitourin Med  | date=1993 | volume=69 | issue=5 | pages=400–3 | url= | doi= 10.1136/sti.69.5.400| pmid= 8244363  | pmc= 1195128 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pubic hair===
[[Pubic hair]] often appears on a boy shortly after the genitalia begin to grow.  The pubic hairs are usually first visible at the dorsal (abdominal) base of the penis. The first few hairs are described as stage 2. Stage 3 is usually reached within another 6–12 months, when the hairs are too many to count. By stage 4, the pubic hairs densely fill the "pubic triangle." Stage 5 refers to the spread of pubic hair to the [[thigh]]s and upward towards the [[navel]] as part of the developing [[abdominal hair]].

===Body and facial hair===
[[Image:Stubbly face.jpg|right|thumb|[[Facial hair]] of a male.]]
In the months and years following the appearance of pubic hair, other areas of skin that respond to androgens may develop [[androgenic hair]]. The usual sequence is: [[underarm]] (axillary) hair, [[perianal hair]], [[moustache|upper lip hair]], [[sideburn]] (preauricular) hair, periareolar hair, and the [[beard]] area.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{Cite news|title=Puberty -- Changes for Males|publisher=pamf.org|accessdate=2009-02-20 |url=http://www.pamf.org/teen/health/puberty/physicalchanges.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with most human biological processes, this specific order may vary among some individuals. Arm, leg, [[chest hair|chest]], [[abdominal hair|abdominal]], and back hair become heavier more gradually. There is a large range in amount of body hair among adult men, and significant differences in timing and quantity of hair growth among different racial groups. Facial hair is often present in late adolescence, but may not appear until significantly later.&lt;ref name="www.ppwr"&gt;{{cite web|title=Getting The Facts: Puberty|publisher=ppwr|accessdate=2009-02-20|url=http://www.ppwr.on.ca/03_07.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080104233250/http://www.ppwr.on.ca/03_07.html|archivedate=2008-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pbskids.org"&gt;{{Cite news|title=The No-Hair Scare|publisher=PBS|accessdate=2009-02-20|url=http://pbskids.org/itsmylife/body/puberty/article7.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205115944/http://pbskids.org/itsmylife/body/puberty/article7.html|archivedate=2009-02-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facial hair will continue to get coarser, darker and thicker for another 2–4 years after puberty.&lt;ref name=www.ppwr/&gt; Some men do not develop full facial hair for up to 10 years after the completion of puberty.&lt;ref name=www.ppwr/&gt; Chest hair may appear during puberty or years after, though not all men develop it.

===Voice change and Adam's apple===
{{main|Voice change}}
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[List of voice disorders]] --&gt;
Under the influence of androgens, the voice box, or [[larynx]], [[Laryngeal prominence|grows]] in both sexes. This growth is far more prominent in boys, causing the male voice to drop and deepen, sometimes abruptly but rarely "overnight," about one [[octave]], because the longer and thicker [[vocal folds]] have a lower [[fundamental frequency]]. Before puberty, the larynx of boys and girls is about equally small.&lt;ref name="www.britannica.com"&gt;{{Cite news|title=The structure of the larynx|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate=2009-02-20|url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/559032/speech/68966/The-structure-of-the-larynx}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally, voice change is accompanied by unsteadiness of vocalization in the early stages of untrained voices. Most of the voice change happens during stage 3-4 of male puberty around the time of peak growth. Adult pitch is attained at an average age of 15 years, although the voice may not fully settle until early twenties. It usually precedes the development of significant facial hair by several months to years.

==Changes in females==

===Breast development===
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Poitrine.jpg|thumb|left|Developing [[breasts]] in stage 4 of 5, with noticeable secondary mounds]] --&gt;
The first physical sign of puberty in girls is usually a firm, tender lump under the center of the [[areola]] of one or both [[breast]]s, occurring on average at about 10.5 years of age.&lt;ref name="Marshall187"&gt;Marshall (1986), p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; This is referred to as [[thelarche]]. By the widely used [[Tanner stages|Tanner staging]] of puberty, this is stage 2 of breast development (stage 1 is a flat, prepubertal breast). Within six to 12 months, the swelling has clearly begun in both sides, softened, and can be felt and seen extending beyond the edges of the areolae. This is stage 3 of breast development. By another 12 months (stage 4), the breasts are approaching mature size and shape, with areolae and [[nipple]]s forming a secondary mound. In most young women, this mound disappears into the contour of the mature breast (stage 5), although there is so much variation in sizes and shapes of adult breasts that stages 4 and 5 are not always separately identifiable.&lt;ref name="Marshall188"&gt;Marshall (1986), p. 188&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pubic hair===
[[Pubic hair]] is often the second noticeable change in puberty, usually within a few months of thelarche.&lt;ref name=tanner85&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tanner JM, Davies PS | title = Clinical longitudinal standards for height and height velocity for North American children. | journal = The Journal of Pediatrics | volume = 107 | issue = 3 | pages = 317–329 | year = 1985 | pmid = 3875704 | doi = 10.1016/S0022-3476(85)80501-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is referred to as [[pubarche]]. The pubic hairs are usually visible first along the [[labium (genitalia)|labia]]. The first few hairs are described as Tanner stage 2.&lt;ref name="Marshall188"/&gt; Stage 3 is usually reached within another 6–12 months, when the hairs are too numerous to count and appear on the [[mons pubis|pubic mound]] as well. By stage 4, the pubic hairs densely fill the "pubic triangle." Stage 5 refers to spread of pubic hair to the [[thigh]]s and sometimes as [[abdominal hair]] upward towards the [[navel]]. In about 15% of girls, the earliest pubic hair appears before breast development begins.&lt;ref name=tanner85/&gt;

===Vagina, uterus, ovaries===
[[Perineum|Perineal]] skin [[keratin]]izes due to effect of estrogen increasing its resistance to infection. The [[mucosal membrane|mucosal]] [[Vagina#Layers, regions and histology|surface]] of the vagina also changes in response to increasing levels of [[estrogen]], becoming thicker and duller pink in color (in contrast to the brighter red of the prepubertal vaginal mucosa).&lt;ref&gt;Gordon (2005), p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; Mucosa changes into a multilayered structure with superficial layer of squamous cells. Estrogen increase glycogen content in [[vaginal epithelium]], which in future plays important part in maintaining [[Vaginal ph|vaginal pH]]. Whitish secretions (physiologic [[leukorrhea]]) are a normal effect of estrogen as well.&lt;ref name="Marshall187"/&gt; In the two years following thelarche, the [[uterus]], [[ovary|ovaries]], and the [[ovarian follicle|follicles]] in the ovaries increase in size.&lt;ref name="Marshall1867"&gt;Marshall (1986), p. 186–7&lt;/ref&gt; The ovaries usually contain small follicular [[cyst]]s visible by [[medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosenfield (2002), p. 462&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid1584537"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Siegel MJ, Surratt JT | title = Pediatric gynecologic imaging. | journal = Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 103–127 | year = 1992 | pmid = 1584537 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before puberty, uterine body to cervix ratio is 1:1; which increases to 2:1 or 3:1 after completion of pubertal period.

===Menstruation and fertility===
The first [[menstrual cycle|menstrual bleeding]] is referred to as [[menarche]], and typically occurs about two years after [[thelarche]].&lt;ref name=tanner85/&gt; The average age of menarche is 12.5 in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="U.S. menarche"/&gt; Most American girls experience their first period at 11, 12 or 13, but some experience it earlier than their 11th birthday and others after their 14th birthday. In fact, anytime between 8 and 16 is normal. In [[Canada]], the average age of menarche is 12.72,&lt;ref name="Canadian menarche"/&gt; and in the [[United Kingdom]] it is 12.9.&lt;ref name="UK menarche"/&gt; The time between menstrual periods (menses) is not always regular in the first two years after menarche.&lt;ref name=apter80&gt;{{cite journal | author = Apter D | title = Serum steroids and pituitary hormones in female puberty: a partly longitudinal study. | journal = Clinical Endocrinology | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | pages = 107–120 | year = 1980 | pmid = 6249519 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2265.1980.tb02125.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ovulation]] is necessary for [[fertility]], but may or may not accompany the earliest menses.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall (1986), p. 196-7&lt;/ref&gt; In postmenarchal girls, about 80% of the cycles were anovulatory in the first year after menarche, 50% in the third year and 10% in the sixth year.&lt;ref name=apter80 /&gt; Initiation of ovulation after menarche is not inevitable. A high proportion of girls with continued irregularity in the menstrual cycle several years from menarche will continue to have prolonged irregularity and anovulation, and are at higher risk for reduced fertility.&lt;ref name=southam&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Southam AL, Richart RM | title = The prognosis for adolescents with menstrual abnormalities. | journal = American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 94 | issue = 5 | pages = 637–645 | year = 1966 | pmid = 5906589 | doi = 10.1016/0002-9378(66)90398-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Body shape, fat distribution, and body composition===
During this period, also in response to rising levels of estrogen, the lower half of the [[pelvis]] and thus [[Hip (anatomy)|hips]] widen (providing a larger [[birth canal]]).&lt;ref name="Marshall188"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/hs/pubhealth/modules/reproductiveHealth/anatomy.html |title=Hips widen during female puberty  |publisher=Columbia  |accessdate=2013-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fat tissue increases to a greater percentage of the body composition than in males, especially in the typical female distribution of breasts, hips, buttocks, thighs, upper arms, and pubis. Progressive differences in fat distribution as well as sex differences in local skeletal growth contribute to the typical female body shape by the end of puberty. On average, at 10 years, girls have 6% more body fat than boys.&lt;ref&gt;Gungor (2002), pages 699-700&lt;/ref&gt;

===Body odor and acne===
Rising levels of [[androgen]]s can change the [[fatty acid]] composition of [[perspiration]], resulting in a more "adult" [[body odor]]. This often precedes thelarche and pubarche by one or more years. Another androgen effect is increased secretion of oil ([[sebum]]) from the skin. This change increases the susceptibility to [[Acne vulgaris|acne]], a skin condition that is characteristic of puberty.&lt;ref name="ros2002"&gt;Rosenfield (2002){{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acne varies greatly in its severity.&lt;ref name=ros2002/&gt;

===Visual and other effects of hormonal changes===
In girls, [[estradiol]] (the primary female sex hormone) causes thickening of lips and [[oral mucosa]] as well as further development of the [[vulva]]. In the vulva and vagina, estradiol causes thickening ([[stratified squamous epithelium|stratification]]) of the skin and the growth of both the [[myoepithelial cells|myoepithelial layer]] and the [[smooth muscle]] of the vagina. Typically estradiol will also cause pronounced growth of the [[labia minora]] and to a lesser degree of the [[labia majora]].

Estradiol is also responsible for the increased production of [[pheomelanin]], resulting in the characteristic red color of the lips, labia minora and sometimes labia majora. Estradiol together with other ovarian steroids also cause the darker coloration of the [[areola]].

Testosterone will cause an enlargement of the [[clitoris]] and possibly has important effects on the growth and maturation of the [[vestibular bulbs]], [[corpus cavernosum of clitoris|corpus cavernosum of the clitoris]] and [[urethral sponge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kalloo NB, Gearhart JP, Barrack ER | title = Sexually dimorphic expression of estrogen receptors, but not of androgen receptors in human fetal external genitalia | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 77 | issue = 3 | pages = 692–698 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8370691 | doi=10.1210/jcem.77.3.8370691}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes of the vulva initiated by estradiol as well as its direct effects also appear to influence the functioning of the lower urinary tract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Andersson KE, Wein AJ | title = Pharmacology of the Lower Urinary Tract: Basis for Current and Future Treatments of Urinary Incontinence | journal = Pharmacological Reviews | volume = 56 | issue = 4 | pages = 581–631 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15602011 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1124/pr.56.4.4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Robinson D, Cardozo L | title = Estrogens and the lower urinary tract | journal = Neurourology and Urodynamics | volume = 30 | issue = 5 | pages = 754–757 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21661025 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1002/nau.21106 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2008}}
In a general sense, the conclusion of puberty is reproductive maturity. Criteria for defining the conclusion may differ for different purposes: attainment of the ability to reproduce, achievement of maximal adult height, maximal gonadal size, or adult sex hormone levels. Maximal adult height is achieved at an average age of 15 years for an average girl and 18 years for an average boy. Potential fertility (sometimes termed ''nubility'') usually precedes completion of growth by 1–2 years in girls and 3–4 years in boys. Stage 5 typically represents maximal gonadal growth and adult hormone levels.

===Age of onset===
The definition of the onset of puberty may depend on perspective (e.g., hormonal versus physical) and purpose (establishing population normal standards, clinical care of early or late pubescent individuals, etc.). A common definition for the onset of puberty is physical changes to a person's body.&lt;ref name="Puberty"/&gt; These physical changes are the first visible signs of neural, hormonal, and gonadal function changes.

The age at which puberty begins varies between individuals; usually, puberty begins between 10 and 13 years of age. The age at which puberty begins is affected by both genetic factors and by environmental factors such as nutritional state and social circumstances.&lt;ref name="ncbi"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kaplowitz PB, Slora EJ, Wasserman RC, Pedlow SE, Herman-Giddens ME | title = Earlier onset of puberty in girls: relation to increased body mass index and race. | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 108 | issue = 2 | pages = 347–53 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11483799 | doi = 10.1542/peds.108.2.347 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of social circumstances is the [[Vandenbergh effect]]; a juvenile female who has significant interaction with adult males will enter puberty earlier than juvenile females who are not socially overexposed to adult males.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson RJ. 2005. Introduction to Behavioral Endocrinology. Sinauer Associates: Massachusetts. p357.&lt;/ref&gt;

The average age at which puberty begins may be affected by race as well. For example, the average age of [[menarche]] in various populations surveyed has ranged from 12&lt;ref name="U.S. menarche"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Canadian menarche"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UK menarche"/&gt; to 18 years. The earliest average onset of puberty is for African-American girls and the latest average onset for high altitude subsistence populations in Asia. However, much of the higher age averages reflect nutritional limitations more than genetic differences and can change within a few generations with a substantial change in diet. The median age of menarche for a population may be an index of the proportion of undernourished girls in the population, and the width of the spread may reflect unevenness of wealth and food distribution in a population.

Researchers have identified an earlier age of the onset of puberty.  However, they have based their conclusions on a comparison of data from 1999 with data from 1969.  In the earlier example, the sample population was based on a small sample of white girls (200, from Britain).  The later study identified as puberty as occurring in 48% of African-American girls by age nine, and 12% of white girls by that age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://center4research.org/child-teen-health/early-puberty-and-problems-in-sexual-development/girls-to-women/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109061104/http://center4research.org/child-teen-health/early-puberty-and-problems-in-sexual-development/girls-to-women/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-11-09|title=Early Puberty in Girls|accessdate=2010-07-13|date=May 2009|last=Zuckerman|first=Diana|publisher=National Research Center for Women and Families}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One possible cause of a delay in the onset of puberty past the age 14 in girls and 15 in boys is [[Kallmann syndrome]], a form of [[hypogonadotropic hypogonadism]] (HH). Kallmann syndrome is also associated with a lack of sense of smell ([[anosmia]]).  Kallmann syndrome and other forms of HH affect both men and women. It is caused by a failure in [[HPG axis]] at puberty which results in low or zero [[gonadotropin]] ([[Luteinizing hormone|LH]] and [[Follicle-stimulating hormone|FSH]]) levels with the subsequent result of a failure to commence or complete puberty, secondary [[hypogonadism]] and [[infertility]].&lt;ref name="pmid21511493"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mitchell AL, Dwyer A, Pitteloud N, Quinton R | title = Genetic basis and variable phenotypic expression of Kallmann syndrome: towards a unifying theory. | journal = Trends Endocrinol.

====Historical shift====
The average age at which the onset of puberty occurs has dropped significantly since the 1840s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Harry|last=Finley|title=Average age at menarche in various cultures|publisher=Museum of Menstruation and Women s Health|url=http://www.mum.org/menarage.htm|work=|pages=|accessdate=2007-08-02|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Whincup PH, Gilg JA, Odoki K, Taylor SJ, Cook DG | title = Age of menarche in contemporary British teenagers: survey of girls born between 1982 and 1986 | journal = BMJ | volume = 322 | issue = 7294 | pages = 1095–6 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11337438 | pmc = 31261 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.322.7294.1095 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Girls maturing slightly earlier|date=2001-05-03|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/1310280.stm|work=|pages=|accessdate=2007-08-02|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In every decade from 1840 to 1950 there was a drop of four months in the average age of menarche among Western European females. In [[Norway]], girls born in 1840 had their menarche at an average age of 17 years. In France, the average in 1840 was 15.3 years. In [[England]], the average in 1840 was 16.5 years. In [[Japan]] the decline happened later and was then more rapid: from 1945 to 1975 in Japan there was a drop of 11 months per decade.

A 2006 study in Denmark found  that puberty, as evidenced by breast development, started at an average age of 9 years and 10 months, a year earlier than when a similar study  was done in 1991.  Scientists believe the phenomenon could be linked to obesity or exposure to chemicals in the food chain, and is putting girls at greater long-term risk of breast cancer.&lt;ref&gt;

===Genetic influence and environmental factors===
Various studies have found direct genetic effects to account for at least 46% of the variation of timing of puberty in well-nourished populations.&lt;ref name="xia"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Ge|first1=Xiaojia|last2=Natsuaki|first2=Misaki N.|last3=Neiderhiser|first3=Jenae M.|last4=Reiss|first4=David|title=Genetic and Environmental Influences on Pubertal Timing: Results From Two National Sibling Studies|journal=Journal of Research on Adolescence|volume=17|issue=4|pages=767–788|year=2007|doi=10.1111/j.1532-7795.2007.00546.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mustanski BS, Viken RJ, Kaprio J, Pulkkinen L, Rose RJ | title = Genetic and environmental influences on pubertal development: longitudinal data from Finnish twins at ages 11 and 14. | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 40 | issue = 6 | pages = 1188–1198 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15535766 | doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.40.6.1188 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Treloar SA, Martin NG | title = Age at menarche as a fitness trait: nonadditive genetic variance detected in a large twin sample. | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 47 | issue = 1 | pages = 137–148 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2349942 | pmc = 1683767 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kaprio J, Rimpelä A, Winter T, Viken RJ, Rimpelä M, Rose RJ | title = Common genetic influences on BMI and age at menarche. | journal = Human Biology; an International Record of Research | volume = 67 | issue = 5 | pages = 739–753 | year = 1995 | pmid = 8543288 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The genetic association of timing is strongest between mothers and daughters.

Researchers&lt;ref&gt;Diana Zuckerman, "When Little Girls Become Women: Early Onset of Puberty in Girls" (This article appeared in The Ribbon, a newsletter of the Cornell University Program on Breast Cancer and Environmental Risk Factors in New York States (BCERF), Vol 6, No. 1, Winter 2001.) [https://web.archive.org/web/20131109061104/http://center4research.org/child-teen-health/early-puberty-and-problems-in-sexual-development/girls-to-women/ Early Puberty in Girls]&lt;/ref&gt; have hypothesized that early puberty onset may be caused by certain hair care products containing estrogen or placenta, and by certain chemicals, namely [[phthalate]]s, which are used in many cosmetics, toys, and plastic food containers.

If genetic factors account for half of the variation of pubertal timing, environment factors are clearly important as well. One of the first observed environmental effects is that puberty occurs later in children raised at higher altitudes. The most important of the environmental influences is clearly nutrition, but a number of others have been identified, all which affect timing of female puberty and menarche more clearly than male puberty.

====Hormones and steroids====
There is theoretical concern, and animal evidence, that environmental hormones and [[chemical]]s may affect aspects of prenatal or postnatal sexual development in humans.&lt;ref&gt;Colborn, T., Dumanoski, D. and Myers, J.P. Our Stolen Future, 1996, Plume: New York.{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large amounts of incompletely metabolized estrogens and [[progestogen]]s from pharmaceutical products are excreted into the sewage systems of large cities, and are sometimes detectable in the environment. [[Sex steroid]]s are sometimes used in cattle farming but have been banned in chicken meat production for 40 years. Although agricultural laws regulate use to minimize accidental human consumption, the rules are largely self-enforced in the United States. Significant exposure of a child to hormones or other substances that activate estrogen or androgen [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s could produce some or all of the changes of puberty.

Harder to detect as an influence on puberty are the more diffusely distributed environmental chemicals like PCBs ([[polychlorinated biphenyl]]), which can bind and trigger estrogen receptors.

More obvious degrees of partial puberty from direct exposure of young children to small but significant amounts of pharmaceutical sex steroids from exposure at home may be detected during medical evaluation for [[precocious puberty]], but mild effects and the other potential exposures outlined above would not.

[[Bisphenol A]] (BPA) is a chemical used to make plastics, and is frequently used to make baby bottles, water bottles, sports equipment, medical devices, and as a coating in food and beverage cans.  Scientists are concerned about BPA's behavioral effects on fetuses, infants, and children at current exposure levels because it can affect the prostate gland, mammary gland, and lead to early puberty in girls. BPA mimics and interferes with the action of estrogen—an important reproduction and development regulator. It [[Leaching (chemical science)|leaches]] out of plastic into liquids and foods, and the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) found measurable amounts of BPA in the bodies of more than 90 percent of the U.S. population studied.  The highest estimated daily intakes of BPA occur in infants and children. Many plastic baby bottles contain BPA, and BPA is more likely to leach out of plastic when its temperature is increased, as when one warms a baby bottle or warms up food in the microwave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://center4research.org/child-teen-health/early-puberty-and-problems-in-sexual-development/are-bisphenol-a-bpa-plastic-products-safe-for-infants-and-children/ |title=Are Bisphenol A (BPA) Plastic Products Safe for Infants and Children? }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nutritional influence====
[[Nutrition]]al factors are the strongest and most obvious environmental factors affecting timing of puberty.&lt;ref name=xia/&gt; Girls are especially sensitive to nutritional regulation because they must contribute all of the nutritional support to a growing fetus. Surplus [[calorie]]s (beyond growth and activity requirements) are reflected in the amount of [[adipose|body fat]], which signals to the brain the availability of resources for initiation of puberty and fertility.

Much evidence suggests that for most of the last few centuries, nutritional differences accounted for majority of variation of pubertal timing in different populations, and even among social classes in the same population. Recent worldwide increased consumption of animal protein, other changes in nutrition, and increases in [[childhood obesity]] have resulted in falling ages of puberty, mainly in those populations with the higher previous ages. In many populations the amount of variation attributable to nutrition is shrinking.

Although available dietary energy (simple calories) is the most important dietary influence on timing of puberty, quality of the diet plays a role as well. Lower [[protein]] intakes and higher [[dietary fiber]] intakes, as occur with typical [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian diet]]s, are associated with later onset and slower progression of female puberty.

====Obesity influence and exercise====
Scientific researchers have linked early [[obesity]] with an earlier onset of puberty in girls.  They have cited obesity as a cause of breast development before nine years and menarche before twelve years.&lt;ref name="newscientist.com"&gt;{{cite web|first=Phil|last=McKenna|title=Childhood obesity brings early puberty for girls|publisher=''[[New Scientist]]''|date=2007-03-05|accessdate=2010-05-22|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11307-childhood-obesity-brings-early-puberty-for-girls.html |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080419072722/http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11307-childhood-obesity-brings-early-puberty-for-girls.html |archivedate = 2008-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early puberty in girls can be a harbinger of later health problems.&lt;ref&gt;Molly, M. Ginty, [http://womensenews.org/story/campaign-trail/060522/peru-campaign-quiet-reproductive-issues "US Girls' Early Puberty Attracts Research Flurry"], ''[[Women's eNews]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The average level of daily physical activity has also been shown to affect timing of puberty, especially in females. A high level of exercise, whether for athletic or body image purposes, or for daily subsistence, reduces energy calories available for reproduction and slows puberty. The exercise effect is often amplified by a lower body fat mass and cholesterol.

====Physical and mental illness====
Chronic diseases can delay puberty in both boys and girls. Those that involve chronic inflammation or interfere with nutrition have the strongest effect. In the western world, [[inflammatory bowel disease]] and [[tuberculosis]] have been notorious for such an effect in the last century, while in areas of the underdeveloped world, chronic [[parasite]] [[infection]]s are widespread.

Mental illnesses occur in puberty. The brain undergoes significant development by [[hormone]]s which can contribute to mood disorders such as [[major depressive disorder]], [[bipolar disorder]], [[dysthymia]] and [[schizophrenia]]. Girls aged between 15 and 19 make up 40% of [[anorexia nervosa]] cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bulik CM, Reba L, Siega-Riz AM, Reichborn-Kjennerud T | title = Anorexia nervosa: definition, epidemiology, and cycle of risk. | journal = The International Journal of Eating Disorders | volume = 37 Suppl | pages = S2–9; discussion S20–1 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15852310 | doi = 10.1002/eat.20107 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stress and social factors====
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2011}}
Some of the least understood environmental influences on timing of puberty are social and psychological. In comparison with the effects of genetics, nutrition, and general health, social influences are small, shifting timing by a few months rather than years. Mechanisms of these social effects are unknown, though a variety of physiological processes, including [[pheromone]]s, have been suggested based on animal research.

The most important part of a child's psychosocial environment is the family, and most of the social influence research has investigated features of family structure and function in relation to earlier or later female puberty. Most of the studies have reported that menarche may occur a few months earlier in girls in high-stress households, whose fathers are absent during their early childhood, who have a stepfather in the home, who are subjected to prolonged [[sexual abuse]] in childhood, or who are [[international adoption|adopted]] from a developing country at a young age. Conversely, menarche may be slightly later when a girl grows up in a large family with a biological father present.

More extreme degrees of environmental stress, such as wartime refugee status with threat to physical survival, have been found to be associated with delay of maturation, an effect that may be compounded by dietary inadequacy.

Most of these reported social effects are small and our understanding is incomplete. Most of these "effects" are statistical associations revealed by [[epidemiology|epidemiologic]] surveys. Statistical associations are not necessarily causal, and a variety of covariables and alternative explanations can be imagined. Effects of such small size can never be confirmed or refuted for any individual child. Furthermore, interpretations of the data are politically controversial because of the ease with which this type of research can be used for political advocacy. Accusations of bias based on political agenda sometimes accompany scientific criticism.

Another limitation of the social research is that nearly all of it has concerned girls, partly because female puberty requires greater physiologic resources and partly because it involves a unique event (menarche) that makes survey research into female puberty much simpler than male. More detail is provided in the [[menarche]] article.

===Variations of sequence===
The sequence of events of pubertal development can occasionally vary. For example, in about 15% of boys and girls, [[pubarche]] (the first pubic hairs) can precede, respectively, [[gonadarche]] and [[thelarche]] by a few months. Rarely, [[menarche]] can occur before other signs of puberty in a few girls. These variations deserve medical evaluation because they can occasionally signal a disease.

==Neurohormonal process==
The endocrine [[reproductive]] system consists of the [[hypothalamus]], the [[pituitary gland|pituitary]], the [[gonad]]s, and the [[adrenal gland]]s, with input and regulation from many other body systems. True puberty is often termed "central puberty" because it begins as a process of the [[central nervous system]]. A simple description of hormonal puberty is as follows:

#The brain's [[hypothalamus]] begins to release pulses of [[GnRH]].
#Cells in the [[anterior pituitary]] respond by secreting [[Luteinizing hormone|LH]] and [[Follicle stimulating hormone|FSH]] into the circulation.
#The [[ovary|ovaries]] or [[testes]] respond to the rising amounts of LH and FSH by growing and beginning to produce [[estradiol]] and [[testosterone]].
#Rising levels of estradiol and testosterone produce the body changes of female and male puberty.

The onset of this neurohormonal process may precede the first visible body changes by 1–2 years.

===Components of the endocrine reproductive system===

The '''[[arcuate nucleus]]''' of the '''[[hypothalamus]]''' is the driver of the reproductive system. It has [[neuron]]s which generate and release pulses of GnRH into the portal venous system of the [[pituitary gland]]. The arcuate nucleus is affected and controlled by neuronal input from other areas of the brain and hormonal input from the [[gonad]]s, [[adipose]] tissue and a variety of other systems.

The '''[[pituitary gland]]''' responds to the pulsed GnRH signals by releasing LH and FSH into the blood of the general circulation, also in a pulsatile pattern.

The '''gonads''' ([[testes]] and [[ovary|ovaries]]) respond to rising levels of LH and FSH by producing the [[steroid]] [[sex steroid|sex hormones]], [[testosterone]] and [[estrogen]].

The '''[[adrenal gland]]s''' are a second source for steroid hormones. Adrenal maturation, termed [[adrenarche]], typically precedes gonadarche in mid-childhood.

===Major hormones===

*'''[[Neurokinin B]]''' (a [[tachykinin]] [[peptide]]) and '''[[kisspeptin]]''' (a [[neuropeptide]]), both present in [[KNDy neuron|KNDy neurons]] of the [[hypothalamus]], are critical parts of the control system that switches on the release of GnRH at the start of puberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Topaloglu AK, Reimann F, Guclu M, Yalin AS, Kotan LD, Porter KM, Serin A, Mungan NO, Cook JR, Ozbek MN, Imamoglu S, Akalin NS, Yuksel B, O'Rahilly S, Semple RK | title = TAC3 and TACR3 mutations in familial hypogonadotropic hypogonadism reveal a key role for Neurokinin B in the central control of reproduction | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 41 | issue = 3 | pages = 354–8 | year = 2008 | pmid = 19079066 | doi = 10.1038/ng.306 | laydate = 2008-12-11 | laysummary = http://esciencenews.com/articles/2008/12/11/key.regulation.puberty.discovered | laysource = e! Science News | pmc = 4312696 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[GnRH]]''' ([[gonadotropin]]-releasing hormone) is a [[peptide]] [[hormone]] released from the [[hypothalamus]] which stimulates [[gonadotrope]] cells of the anterior [[pituitary gland|pituitary]].
*'''[[Luteinizing hormone|LH]]''' (luteinizing hormone) is a larger [[protein]] hormone secreted into the general circulation by gonadotrope cells of the anterior [[pituitary gland]]. The main target cells of LH are the [[Leydig cell]]s of [[Testicle|testes]] and the [[theca cell]]s of the [[Ovary|ovaries]]. LH secretion changes more dramatically with the initiation of puberty than FSH, as LH levels increase about 25-fold with the onset of puberty, compared with the 2.5-fold increase of FSH.
*'''[[Follicle-stimulating hormone|FSH]]''' ([[Ovarian follicle|follicle]] stimulating hormone) is another protein hormone secreted into the general circulation by the [[gonadotrope]] cells of the anterior pituitary. The main target cells of FSH are the [[ovarian follicle]]s and the [[Sertoli cell]]s and [[spermatogenesis|spermatogenic]] tissue of the [[Testicle|testes]].
*'''[[Testosterone]]''' is a [[steroid]] hormone produced primarily by the [[Leydig cell]]s of the [[Testicle|testes]], and in lesser amounts by the [[theca cell]]s of the ovaries and the adrenal cortex. Testosterone is the primary mammalian [[androgen]] and the "original" [[anabolic steroid]]. It acts on [[androgen receptor]]s in responsive tissue throughout the body.
*'''[[Estradiol]]''' is a [[steroid]] hormone produced by [[aromatization]] of testosterone. Estradiol is the principal human [[estrogen]] and acts on [[estrogen receptor]]s throughout the body. The largest amounts of estradiol are produced by the [[granulosa cell]]s of the [[Ovary|ovaries]], but lesser amounts are derived from [[Testicle|testicular]] and [[Adrenal gland|adrenal]] testosterone.
*'''[[Adrenal gland|Adrenal]] [[androgen]]s''' are steroids produced by the [[zona reticulosa]] of the [[adrenal cortex]] in both sexes. The major adrenal androgens are [[dehydroepiandrosterone]], [[androstenedione]] (which are precursors of testosterone), and [[dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate]] which is present in large amounts in the [[blood]]. Adrenal androgens contribute to the androgenic events of early puberty in girls.
*'''[[IGF1]]''' ([[insulin-like growth factor 1]]) rises substantially during puberty in response to rising levels of [[growth hormone]] and may be the principal mediator of the [[Adolescence#Growth spurt|pubertal growth spurt]].
*'''[[Leptin]]''' is a protein hormone produced by [[adipose tissue]]. Its primary target organ is the [[hypothalamus]]. The leptin level seems to provide the [[brain]] a rough indicator of adipose mass for purposes of regulation of [[appetite]] and [[energy metabolism]]. It also plays a permissive role in female puberty, which usually will not proceed until an adequate body mass has been achieved.

===Endocrine perspective===
The [[endocrine system|endocrine reproductive system]] becomes functional by the end of the first [[Pregnancy|trimester]] of fetal life. The testes and ovaries become briefly inactive around the time of birth but resume hormonal activity until several months after birth, when incompletely understood mechanisms in the brain begin to suppress the activity of the arcuate nucleus. This has been referred to as maturation of the prepubertal "gonadostat," which becomes sensitive to negative feedback by [[sex steroid]]s. The period of hormonal activity until several months after birth, followed by suppression of activity, may correspond to the period of infant sexuality, followed by a [[latency stage]], which [[Sigmund Freud]] described.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lehrer S | title = Modern correlates of Freudian psychology. Infant sexuality and the unconscious. | journal = The American Journal of Medicine | volume = 77 | issue = 6 | pages = 977–80 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6507468 | doi = 10.1016/0002-9343(84)90172-4 | url = http://sites.google.com/site/infantsexuality/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gonadotropin]] and sex steroid levels fall to low levels (nearly undetectable by current [[medical test|clinical assays]]) for approximately another 8 to 10 years of childhood. Evidence is accumulating that the reproductive system is not totally inactive during the childhood years. Subtle increases in gonadotropin pulses occur, and ovarian follicles surrounding [[germ cell]]s (future [[Ovum|egg]]s) double in number.

Normal puberty is initiated in the hypothalamus, with de-inhibition of the pulse generator in the arcuate nucleus. This inhibition of the arcuate nucleus is an ongoing active suppression by other areas of the brain. The signal and mechanism releasing the arcuate nucleus from inhibition have been the subject of investigation for decades and remain incompletely understood. [[Leptin]] levels rise throughout childhood and play a part in allowing the arcuate nucleus to resume operation. If the childhood inhibition of the arcuate nucleus is interrupted prematurely by injury to the brain, it may resume pulsatile gonadotropin release and puberty will begin at an early age.

Neurons of the arcuate nucleus secrete [[gonadotropin releasing hormone]] (GnRH) into the blood of the pituitary portal system. An American physiologist, Ernst Knobil, found that the GnRH signals from the hypothalamus induce pulsed secretion of LH (and to a lesser degree, FSH) at roughly 1-2 hour intervals. The LH pulses are the consequence of pulsatile GnRH secretion by the arcuate nucleus that, in turn, is the result of an [[oscillator]] or signal generator in the central nervous system ("GnRH pulse generator").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Neill JD | title = In Memoriam: Ernst Knobil (1926-2000) | journal = [[Endocrine Reviews]] | volume = 22 | issue = 6 | pages = 721–3 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11739328 | doi = 10.1210/er.22.6.721 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the years preceding physical puberty, [[Robert M. Boyar]] discovered that the gonadotropin pulses occur only during sleep, but as puberty progresses they can be detected during the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Boyar R, Finkelstein J, Roffwarg H, Kapen S, Weitzman E, Hellman L | title = Synchronization of augmented luteinizing hormone secretion with sleep during puberty. | journal = [[The New England Journal of Medicine]] | volume = 287 | issue = 12 | pages = 582–586 | year = 1972 | pmid = 4341276 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM197209212871203 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of puberty, there is little day-night difference in the amplitude and frequency of gonadotropin pulses.

An array of "autoamplification processes" increases the production of all of the pubertal hormones of the hypothalamus, pituitary, and gonads{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}.

Regulation of [[adrenarche]] and its relationship to maturation of the hypothalamic-gonadal axis is not fully understood, and some evidence suggests it is a parallel but largely independent process coincident with or even preceding central puberty. Rising levels of adrenal [[androgen]]s (termed adrenarche) can usually be detected between 6 and 11 years of age, even before the increasing gonadotropin pulses of hypothalamic puberty. Adrenal androgens contribute to the development of pubic hair ([[pubarche]]), adult [[body odor]], and other androgenic changes in both sexes. The primary clinical significance of the distinction between adrenarche and gonadarche is that pubic hair and body odor changes by themselves do not prove that central puberty is underway for an individual child.

===Hormonal changes in boys===
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2011}}
Early stages of male hypothalamic maturation seem to be very similar to the early stages of female puberty, though occurring about 1–2 years later.

LH stimulates the Leydig cells of the testes to make testosterone and blood levels begin to rise. For much of puberty, nighttime levels of testosterone are higher than daytime. Regularity of frequency and amplitude of gonadotropin pulses seems to be less necessary for progression of male than female puberty.

However, a significant portion of [[testosterone]] in adolescent boys is converted to estradiol. Estradiol mediates the growth spurt, bone maturation, and epiphyseal closure in boys just as in girls. Estradiol also induces at least modest development of breast tissue ([[gynecomastia]]) in a large proportion of boys. Boys who develop mild [[gynecomastia]] or even developing [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]]s under [[nipple]]s during puberty are told the effects are temporary in some male teenagers due to high levels of [[estradiol]].

Another hormonal change in males takes place during the teenage years for most young men. At this point in a male's life the testosterone levels slowly rise, and most of the effects are mediated through the androgen receptors by way of conversion [[dihydrotestosterone]] in target organs (especially that of the bowels).

===Hormonal changes in girls===
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2011}}
As the amplitude of LH pulses increases, the theca cells of the ovaries begin to produce testosterone and smaller amounts of [[progesterone]]. Much of the testosterone moves into nearby cells called [[granulosa cell]]s. Smaller increases of FSH induce an increase in the [[aromatase]] activity of these granulosa cells, which converts most of the testosterone to estradiol for secretion into the circulation. The remaining testosterone, together with adrenal androgens is responsible for the typical androgenic changes of female puberty: pubic hair, other androgenic hair as outlined above, body odor, acne. The bioactivity of testosterone is to a large degree limited by [[SHBG]] which in turn is mainly controlled by estradiol and [[prolactin]] levels (estradiol stimulates, prolactin decreases SHBG synthesis).

Rising levels of estradiol produce the characteristic estrogenic body changes of female puberty: growth spurt, acceleration of bone maturation and closure, [[breast]] [[Human development (biology)|growth]], increased fat composition, growth of the uterus, increased thickness of the [[endometrium]] and the vaginal mucosa, and widening of the lower pelvis.

As the estradiol levels gradually rise and the other autoamplification processes occur, a point of maturation is reached when the feedback sensitivity of the hypothalamic "gonadostat" becomes positive. This attainment of positive feedback is the hallmark of female sexual maturity, as it allows the mid cycle LH surge necessary for [[ovulation]].

Growth hormone levels rise steadily throughout puberty. [[Insulin-like growth factor 1|IGF1]] levels rise and then decline as puberty ends. Growth finishes and adult height is attained as the estradiol levels complete closure of the [[epiphyses]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3676">'''Refined grains''', in contrast to [[whole grain]]s, refers to grain products consisting of grains or grain [[flour]]s that have been significantly modified from their natural composition. The modification process generally involves the mechanical removal of [[bran]] and [[Cereal germ|germ]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/news/2006/NEW01317.html FDA Provides Guidance on "Whole Grain" for Manufacturers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; either through grinding or selective sifting. Further refining includes mixing, bleaching, and brominating; additionally, [[thiamin]], [[riboflavin]], [[niacin]], and [[iron]] are often added back in to nutritionally [[Enriched flour|enrich]] the product. Because the added nutrients represent a fraction of the nutrients removed, refined grains are considered nutritionally inferior to whole grains.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eap.agrenv.mcgill.ca/Publications/EAP35.htm Campbell, Hauser &amp; Hill, ''Nutritional Characteristics of Organic, Freshly Stone-Ground, Sourdough &amp; Conventional Breads'', McGill University, 1991]&lt;/ref&gt; However, for some grains the removal of fiber coupled with fine grinding results in a slightly higher availability of grain energy for use by the body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ksre.ksu.edu/library/grsci2/mf2050.pdf  Goodband, Tokach &amp; Nelssen, ''The Effects of Diet Particle Size on Animal Performance'', Kansas State University, 1995]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in the special case of [[maize]], the process of [[nixtamalization]] (a chemical form of refinement) yields a considerable improvement in the bioavailability of [[niacin]], thereby preventing [[pellagra]] in diets consisting largely of maize products.{{cn|date=August 2012}}

'''''Small Is Profitable: The Hidden Economic Benefits of Making Electrical Resources the Right Size''''' is a 2002 book by energy analyst [[Amory Lovins]] and others.  The book describes 207 ways in which the size of "electrical resources"—devices that make, save, or store electricity—affects their economic value. It finds that properly accounting for the economic benefits of "distributed" (decentralized) electrical resources typically raises their value by a large factor, perhaps tenfold, through improved system planning, utility construction and operation (especially off the grid), and service quality, and by avoiding [[social cost]]s.  This should change how [[renewable energy|distributed resource]]s are marketed and used, and make policy and business opportunities explicit.&lt;ref name=small&gt;
[http://www.smallisprofitable.org/ Small Is profitable]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Small Is Profitable'' was named 'Book of the Year' by ''[[The Economist]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name=small/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-96498435.html 'Small Is Profitable' Named 'Book of the Year' by The Economist; Book Brings New Thinking to Electricity Industry]&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|reason = Those links appear not to be credible, they don't actually point to the Economist, they point to self referential material |date = November 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6798">A '''stratigraphic unit''' is a volume of [[Rock (geology)|rock]] of identifiable origin and relative age range that is defined by the distinctive and dominant, easily mapped and recognizable [[petrology|petrographic]], [[lithology|lithologic]] or [[paleontology|paleontologic]] features ([[facies]]) that characterize it.

Units must be ''mappable'' and ''distinct'' from one another, but the contact need not be particularly distinct. For instance, a unit may be defined by terms such as "when the sandstone component exceeds 75%".

==Lithostratigraphic units==
[[Image:SEUtahStrat.JPG|thumb|300px|The [[Permian]] through [[Jurassic]] strata of the [[Colorado Plateau]] area of southeastern [[Utah]] demonstrate the principles of [[stratigraphy]].  These strata make up much of the famous prominent rock formations in widely spaced protected areas such as [[Capitol Reef National Park]] and [[Canyonlands National Park]].  From top to bottom: Rounded tan domes of the [[Navajo Sandstone]], layered red [[Kayenta Formation]], cliff-forming, vertically jointed, red [[Wingate Sandstone]], slope-forming, purplish [[Chinle Formation]], layered, lighter-red [[Moenkopi Formation]], and white, layered [[Cutler Formation]] sandstone.

Sequences of [[sedimentary rock|sedimentary]] and [[volcanic rock]]s are subdivided on the basis of their [[lithology]]. Going from smaller to larger in scale, the main units recognised are Bed, Member, Formation, Group and Supergroup.&lt;ref name="Mathur"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_3IXiK8VvcIC&amp;pg=PA130&amp;dq=stratigraphy+units+bed+member+formation+group+supergroup&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xjOMU4HMC8fROeqfgcgK&amp;ved=0CFsQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=stratigraphy%20units%20bed%20member%20formation%20group%20supergroup&amp;f=false | title=Elements of Geology | author=Mathur S.M. | year=2008 | pages=129–130 | isbn=9788120335158}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brookfield"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cRiWoAVOl2wC&amp;pg=PA200&amp;dq=stratigraphy+units+bed+member+formation+group+supergroup&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xjOMU4HMC8fROeqfgcgK&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=stratigraphy%20units%20bed%20member%20formation%20group%20supergroup&amp;f=false | title=Principles of Stratigraphy | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | author=Brookfield M.E. | year=2008 | page=200 | isbn=9780470693223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bed===
{{main|Bed (geology)}}
A [[bed (geology)|bed]] is a lithologically distinct layer within a member or formation and is the smallest recognisable stratigraphic unit. These are not normally named, but may be in the case of a [[marker horizon]].&lt;ref name="Stratorg_litho"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://stratigraphy.org/upload/bak/litho.htm | title=Chapter 5. Lithostratigraphic Units | publisher=[[International Commission on Stratigraphy]] | year=2013–2014 | accessdate=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Member===
A member is a named lithologically distinct part of a formation. Not all formations are subdivided in this way and even where they are recognized, they may only form part of the formation.&lt;ref name="Stratorg_litho"/&gt;

===Formation===
{{main|Geological formation}}
Formations are the primary units used in the subdivision of a sequence and may vary in scale from tens of centimetres to kilometres. They should be distinct lithologically from other formations, although the boundaries do not need to be sharp. To be formally recognised, a formation must have sufficient extent to be useful in mapping an area.&lt;ref name="Stratorg_litho"/&gt;

===Group===
{{main|Group (stratigraphy)}}
A group is a set of two or more formations that share certain lithological characteristics. A group may be made up of different formations in different geographical areas and individual formations may appear in more than one group.&lt;ref name="Stratorg_litho"/&gt;

===Supergroup===
A supergroup is a set of two or more associated groups and/or formations that share certain lithological characteristics. A supergroup may be made up of different groups in different geographical areas.&lt;ref name="Stratorg_litho"/&gt;

==Biostratigraphic units==
{{main|Biostratigraphy}}
A sequence of [[fossil]]-bearing sedimentary rocks can be subdivided on the basis of the occurrence of particular fossil [[taxon|taxa]]. A unit defined in this way is known as a biostratigraphic unit, generally shortened to [[biozone]].&lt;ref name="Rey &amp; Galeotti"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3hM2CkCYJbgC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=biostratigraphic+units&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jWCPU7maJI-w7AaMyYG4Cw&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=biostratigraphic%20units&amp;f=false | title=Stratigraphy: Terminology and Practice|chapter=Biostratigraphy from taxon to biozones and biozonal schemes | publisher=Editions OPHRYS | author=Thierry J. &amp; Galeotti S. |editors=Rey J. &amp; Galeotti S. | year=2008 | pages=64–73 | isbn=9782710809104}}&lt;/ref&gt; The five commonly used types of biozone are assemblage, range, abundance, interval and lineage zones.&lt;ref name="Stratorg_bio"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://stratigraphy.org/upload/bak/bio.htm | title=Chapter 7. Biostratigraphic Units | publisher=[[International Commission on Stratigraphy]] | year=2013–2014 | accessdate=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An ''assemblage zone'' is a stratigraphic interval characterised by an assemblage of three or more coexisting fossil taxa that distinguish it from surrounding strata.&lt;ref name="Rey &amp; Galeotti"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stratorg_bio"/&gt;
* A ''range zone'' is a stratigraphic interval that represents the occurrence range of a specific fossil taxon, based on the localities where it has been recognised.&lt;ref name="Rey &amp; Galeotti"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stratorg_bio"/&gt;
* An ''abundance zone'' is a stratigraphic interval in which the abundance of a particular taxon (or group of taxa) is significantly greater than seen in neighbouring parts of the succession.&lt;ref name="Rey &amp; Galeotti"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stratorg_bio"/&gt;
* An ''interval zone'' is a stratigraphic interval whose top and base are defined by horizons that mark the first or last occurrence of two different taxa.&lt;ref name="Rey &amp; Galeotti"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stratorg_bio"/&gt;
* A ''lineage zone'' is a stratigraphic interval that contains fossils that represent parts of the evolutionary lineage of a particular fossil group. This is a special case of a range zone.&lt;ref name="Rey &amp; Galeotti"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stratorg_bio"/&gt;

The '''Systems Biology Ontology''' (SBO) is a set of controlled, relational vocabularies of terms commonly used in [[Systems Biology]], and in particular in computational modeling. SBO is part of the [http://www.biomodels.net/ BioModels.net] effort.

==Motivation==

The rise of Systems Biology, seeking to comprehend biological processes as a whole, highlighted the need to not only develop corresponding quantitative models, but also to create standards allowing their exchange and integration. This concern drove the community to design common data format such as [[SBML]] and [[CellML]]. SBML is now largely accepted and used in the field.  However, as important as the definition of a common syntax is, it is also necessary to make clear the semantics of models. SBO is an attempt to provide the means of annotating models with terms that indicate the intended semantics of an important subset of models in common use in computational systems biology.&lt;ref&gt;Le Novère N. BioModels.net, tools and resources to support Computational Systems Biology. Proceedings of the 4th Workshop on Computation of Biochemical Pathways and Genetic Networks (2005), Logos, Berlin, pp. 69-74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Le Novère N., Courtot M., Laibe C. Adding semantics in kinetics models of biochemical pathways. Proceedings of the 2nd International Symposium on experimental standard conditions of enzyme characterizations (2007), 137-153. [http://www.beilstein-institut.de/index.php?id=196 Available online]&lt;/ref&gt; The development of SBO was first discussed  at the 9th SBML Forum Meeting in Heidelberg Oct. 14–15, 2004. During the forum, [[Pedro Pedrosa Mendes|Pedro Mendes]] mentioned that modellers possessed a lot of knowledge that was necessary to understand the model, and more importantly to simulate it,  but this knowledge was not encoded in SBML. [[Nicolas Le Novère]] proposed to create a controlled vocabulary to store the content of Pedro Mendes' mind before he wandered out of the community.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolas Le Novère, personal communication&lt;/ref&gt; The development of the ontology was  announced more officially in a message from Le Novère to Michael Hucka and Andrew Finney on October 19.

==Structure==

SBO is currently made up of seven different vocabularies:
* systems description parameter (catalytic constant, thermodynamic temperature...)
* participant role (substrate, product, catalyst...)
* modelling framework (discrete, continuous...)
* mathematical expression (mass-action rate law, Hill-type rate law...)
* occurring entity representation (biochemical process, molecular or genetic interaction...)
* physical entity representation (transporter, physical compartment, observable...)
* metadata representation (annotation)

==Resources==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:SBO small.jpg|frame|right|The Systems Biology Ontology Browser|{{deletable image-caption|1=Saturday, 25 July 2009}}]] --&gt;
To curate and maintain SBO, a dedicated resource has been developed and the public interface of the SBO browser can be accessed at [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/sbo http://www.ebi.ac.uk/sbo].
A relational database management system ([[MySQL]]) at the back-end is
accessed through a web interface based on [[Java Server Pages]] (JSP) and [[JavaBeans]].  Its
content is encoded in [[UTF-8]], therefore supporting a large set of
characters in the definitions of terms.  Distributed curation is made possible
by using a custom-tailored locking system allowing concurrent access.
This system allows a continuous update of the ontology with immediate
availability and suppress merging problems.

Several exports formats ([http://www.godatabase.org/dev/doc/obo_format_spec.html OBO] flat file, [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/sbo/docs/sboxml_schema.xsd SBO-XML] and [http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-features/ OWL]) are generated daily or on request and can be downloaded from the web interface.

To allow programmatic access to the resource, [[Web Services]] have been implemented based on [http://ws.apache.org/axis/ Apache Axis] for the communication layer and [http://www.castor.org/ Castor] for the validation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Li C, Courtot M, Le Novère N, Laibe C |title=BioModels.net Web Services, a free and integrated toolkit for computational modelling software |journal=Brief. Bioinformatics |volume= 11|issue= 3|pages= 270–7|date=November 2009 |pmid=19939940 |pmc=2913671 |doi=10.1093/bib/bbp056 |url=http://bib.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=19939940}}&lt;/ref&gt; The libraries, full documentation, samples and tutorial are available [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/sbo/SBOWSLib/ws.html online].

The sourceforge project can be accessed at [http://sourceforge.net/projects/sbo/ http://sourceforge.net/projects/sbo/].

==SBO and SBML==

Since [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=71971&amp;package_id=76633 Level 2 Version 2] [[SBML]] provides a mechanism to annotate model components with SBO terms, therefore increasing the semantics of the
model beyond the sole topology of interaction and mathematical expression.  Modelling tools such as SBMLsqueezer use SBO terms too. Simulation tools can check the consistency of a rate law, convert reaction from one modelling framework to another (e.g., continuous to discrete), or distinguish between identical mathematical expressions based on different assumptions (e.g., Henri-Michaelis-Menten Vs. Briggs-Haldane).  Other tools such as [http://www.semanticsbml.org/ semanticSBML]&lt;ref&gt;Krause F, Uhlendorf J., Lubitz T., Schulz M., Klipp E., Liebermeister W. (2010), Annotation and merging of SBML models with semanticSBML, Bioinformatics 26 (3), 421-422&lt;/ref&gt; can use the SBO annotation to integrate individual models into a larger one.  The use of SBO is not restricted to the development of models. Resources providing quantitative experimental information such as [https://web.archive.org/web/20061117195025/http://sabio.villa-bosch.de/SABIORK/ SABIO Reaction Kinetics] will be able to annotate the parameters (what do they mean exactly, how were they calculated) and determine relationships between them.

==SBO and SBGN==

All the graphical symbols used in the [[SBGN]] languages are associated with an SBO term. This permits, for instance, to help generate [[SBGN]] maps from [[SBML]] models.

==SBO and BioPAX==

The Systems Biology Pathway Exchange (SBPAX) allows SBO terms to be added to [[BioPAX|Biological Pathway Exchange (BioPAX)]]. This links BioPAX to information useful for modelling, especially by adding quantitative descriptions described by SBO.

==Organization of SBO development==

SBO is built in collaboration by the [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/compneur Computational Neurobiology Group] (Nicolas Le Novère, [[EMBL]]-[[European Bioinformatics Institute|EBI]], United-Kingdom) and the [[SBML]]Team (Michael Hucka, [[Caltech]], USA).

==Funding for SBO==
SBO has benefited from the funds of the [[European Molecular Biology Laboratory]] and the [[National Institute of General Medical Sciences]].

The '''Talkboy''' is a portable variable-speed [[Compact Cassette|cassette]] [[Cassette deck|player and recorder]] manufactured by [[Tiger Electronics]] (now owned by [[Hasbro]]) in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name=Wong-BW-2012&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wong|first1=Venessa|title=Some Fictional Brands Find Real Success|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/photo-essays/2012-12-06/some-fictional-brands-find-real-success#slide7|website=[[Bloomberg BusinessWeek]]|publisher=[[Bloomberg, L.P.]]|accessdate=21 March 2015|date=6 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally conceived as a non-working prop for the 1992 movie ''[[Home Alone 2: Lost in New York]]'', used by the main character Kevin McCallister ([[Macaulay Culkin]]). One week prior to Black Friday, a fully working retail version based on specifications provided by John Hughes and the movie studio&lt;ref name="SeattleTimes1993"&gt;{{cite web|title=Talkboy: 'Home Alone 2' Toy Is Hot, Hot, Hot|last=Reyes|first=Sonia|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19931216&amp;slug=1737234|website=[[The Seattle Times]]|accessdate=12 November 2016|date=16 December 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; was available at [[Toys "R" Us]] on November 20, 1992, the day ''Home Alone 2: Lost in New York'' was released nationwide in the United States. Initial sales were largely driven by Talkboy's movie tie-in with ''Home Alone 2''.{{cn|date=November 2016}}

The original Talkboy model released for the 1992 holiday shopping season came in ''Home Alone 2'' themed packaging with Kevin McAlister pictured on the front of the box using the Talkboy to record. The original model consists of a battery-powered handheld cassette player/recorder with an integrated [[monophonic]] speaker, grip handle, and an extendable [[microphone]]. The main controls are similar to other portable cassette devices, with play, stop, [[Fast forward|fast-forward]], rewind, and record functionality.

Several spinoff versions of the device were produced&lt;!--(some created by [[Ralph Osterhout]] at Team Machina{{citation-needed|date=September 2014}})--&gt;, including:

* '''Deluxe Talkboy''', released after the original consumer model Talkboy, the Deluxe Talkboy is nearly identical in appearance and function to the original model. The Deluxe Talkboy added a "Slow Playback" feature, which enabled users to manipulate the recording and playback speed, and in turn the pitch of the recorded sound, acting as a simple [[voice changer]]. This feature emulated Kevin McCallister's use of the Talkboy in the film, such as the scene where Kevin places reservations at the Plaza Hotel over the phone by using the Talkboy to modulate his voice to sound deeper and more convincing as an adult. The user could toggle between normal and slow playback speed using the red thumb switch which also operated the Power On/Off. The "Slow" feature used a slowed-down recording/playback speed of 76% and a sped-up speed of 130%. Deluxe Talkboy also added the word "Deluxe" above the "Talkboy" logotype to differentiate between models, and placement of the [[Headphone Jack|headphone jack]] was marginally relocated. The Deluxe Talkboy came packaged with a cassette tape, one side of the tape is initially blank for the user to record with, and the other side is write-protected and featured various lines and sound effects from ''Home Alone 2''.
* '''Talkgirl''', a pink-colored Talkboy, marketed toward young girls. The toy was recently featured in a key scene in the second season of the [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] series, [[Search Party (TV series)|''Search Party'']], in which April blackmails Dory and her friends by recording an incriminating conversation on her Talkgirl.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vulture.com/2017/12/search-party-recap-season-2-finale.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Talkboy FX Plus''', a writing pen with a built-in recorder and six buttons that play sound effects.
* '''Talkgirl FX Plus''', a pink version of the FX Plus.
* '''Talkboy Jr.''', a pocket-sized version of the Talkboy which uses internal memory rather than cassette tapes.
* '''Talkgirl Jr.''', a pink version of the Talkboy Jr.

[[File:Royal_observatory_greenwich.jpg|thumb|right|240px|[[Royal Observatory, Greenwich]], London. Installed in 1833, a time ball sits atop the Octagon Room]]

A '''time ball''' or '''timeball''' is an obsolete time-signalling device. It consists of a large, painted wooden or metal ball that is dropped at a predetermined time, principally to enable navigators aboard ships offshore to verify the setting of their [[marine chronometer]]s. Accurate timekeeping is essential to the determination of [[longitude]] at sea.

Although the use of time balls has been replaced by electronic [[time signal]]s, some time balls have remained operational as historical [[tourist attraction]]s.

==History==
The fall of a little ball was in antiquity a way to show to people the time. Ancient Greek clocks had this system in the main square of a city, as in the city of Gaza in post-Alexander era and till the 7th century AD as [[Procopius]] described in his book on Edifices.
Time ball stations set their clocks according to transit observations of the positions of the sun and stars. Originally they either had to be stationed at the [[observatory]], or had to keep a very accurate clock at the station which was set manually to observatory time. Following the introduction of the electric [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] around 1850, time balls could be located at a distance from their source of [[Local mean time|mean time]] and operated remotely.

[[File:Boston Time-Ball.jpg|thumb|left|275px|The Boston Time Ball (1881)]]

The first time ball was erected at [[Portsmouth]], England, in 1829 by its inventor [[Robert Wauchope (Royal Navy officer)|Robert Wauchope]], a captain in the [[Royal Navy]].&lt;ref name=AUB&gt;{{Cite book |last=Aubin |first=David |authorlink= |title=The Heavens on Earth: Observatories and Astronomy in Nineteenth-Century Science and Culture |publisher=Duke University Press |year=2010 |location=Durham, N.C. |page=164 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9EKzLQL3RQEC&amp;pg=PA164&amp;dq=Robert+Wauchope+time+ball#v=onepage&amp;q=Robert%20Wauchope%20time%20ball&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-8223-4640-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others followed in the major ports of the United Kingdom (including [[Liverpool]]) and around the maritime world.&lt;ref name=AUB/&gt; One was installed in 1833 at the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich|Greenwich Observatory]] in London by the [[Astronomer Royal]], [[John Pond]], and the time ball has dropped at 1 p.m. every day since then.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com/info/timeball/ "Time Ball: What time does the time-ball drop at Greenwich?"]. Greenwich Mean Time.&lt;/ref&gt; Wauchope submitted his scheme to American and French ambassadors when they visited England.&lt;ref name=AUB/&gt; The [[United States Naval Observatory]] was established in Washington, D.C., and the first American time ball went into service in 1845.&lt;ref name=AUB/&gt;

Time balls were usually dropped at 1 p.m. (although in the United States they were dropped at noon). They were raised half way about 5 minutes earlier to alert the ships, then with 2–3 minutes to go they were raised the whole way. The time was recorded when the ball began descending, not when it reached the bottom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dealtimeball.tripod.com/id1.html|title=Deal Timeball Tower: The Ball Drop |accessdate=4 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the commencement of [[Time signal|radio time signals]] (in Britain from 1924), time balls gradually became obsolete and many were demolished in the 1920s.&lt;ref name="Gdańsk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://latarnia.gda.pl/en/index.php?go=kula,czasu |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213162503/http://latarnia.gda.pl/en/index.php?go=kula,czasu |archivedate=13 February 2012 |title=The Gdańsk Nowy Port Lighthouse and Time Ball |accessdate=4 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Timeball station.jpg|thumb|right|The time ball at [[Lyttelton, New Zealand|Port Lyttelton]], New Zealand, started signalling [[Greenwich Mean Time]] to ships in the harbour beginning in 1876.

Travel}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

A contemporary version of the concept has been used since 31 December 1907 at [[New York City]]'s [[Times Square]] as part of its [[New Year's Eve]] celebrations, in which a [[Times Square Ball|lit ball]] is lowered down a pole atop the [[One Times Square]] tower to signal midnight and the arrival of the new year. Rather than the ball being dropped rapidly with its release used as the time signal, it descends slowly over the course of 60 seconds from 11:59&amp;nbsp;p.m. until midnight. For 31 December 1987, the event's organizers acknowledged the addition of a [[leap second]] by extending the drop to 61 seconds &amp;ndash; although in fact the leap second was five hours earlier, as they occur worldwide at midnight [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]. The spectacle was inspired by an organizer having seen the time ball on the [[Western Union Telegraph Building|Western Union Building]] in operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Robert D. |last=McFadden |title='88 Countdown: 3, 2, 1, Leap Second, 0 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1DC1139F93AA15751C1A961948260 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=31 December 1987 |accessdate=2 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;{{cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24314">The '''Titius–Bode law''' (sometimes termed just '''Bode's law''') is a hypothesis that the bodies in some orbital systems, including the [[Sun]]'s, orbit at [[semi-major axis|semi-major axes]] in a function of planetary sequence. The formula suggests that, extending outward, each planet would be approximately twice as far from the Sun as the one before. The hypothesis correctly anticipated the orbits of [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] (in the [[asteroid belt]]) and [[Uranus]], but failed as a predictor of [[Neptune]]'s orbit and was eventually superseded as a theory of [[Solar System]] formation. It is named for [[Johann Daniel Titius]] and [[Johann Elert Bode]].

==Formulation==
The law relates the semi-major axis &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; of each planet outward from the Sun in units such that the Earth's semi-major axis is equal to 10:
:&lt;math&gt;a=4+x&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;x=0,3,6,12,24,48...&lt;/math&gt; with the exception of the first step, each value is twice the previous value.
There is another representation of the formula: &lt;math&gt;a=2^{n} \times 3 +4&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;n=-\infty,0,1,2...&lt;/math&gt;.
The resulting values can be divided by 10 to convert them into [[astronomical unit]]s (AU), resulting in the expression
:&lt;math&gt;a=0.4+0.3 \times 2^m&lt;/math&gt;
for &lt;math&gt;m=-\infty,0,1,2...&lt;/math&gt;
For the outer planets, each planet is predicted to be roughly twice as far from the Sun as the previous object.

==Origin and history==
[[Image:Johann Daniel Titius.jpg|thumb|200px|Johann Daniel Titius]]

[[Image:Johann Elert Bode.jpg|thumb|200px|Johann Elert Bode]]

The first mention of a series approximating Bode's law is found in David Gregory's ''The Elements of Astronomy'', published in 1715. In it, he says, "...supposing the distance of the Earth from the Sun to be divided into ten equal Parts, of these the distance of Mercury will be about four, of Venus seven, of Mars fifteen, of Jupiter fifty two, and that of Saturn ninety five."&lt;ref name=Dawn&gt;{{cite web|title=Dawn: Where Should the Planets Be? The Law of Proportionalities|url=http://dawn.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/background_02.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307004322/http://dawn.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/background_02.asp|archive-date=March 7, 2016|access-date=March 16, 2018|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar sentence, likely paraphrased from Gregory,&lt;ref name=Dawn /&gt; appears in a work published by [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] in 1724.

In 1764, [[Charles Bonnet]] said in his ''Contemplation de la Nature'' that, "We know seventeen planets that enter into the composition of our solar system [that is, major planets and their satellites]; but we are not sure that there are no more."&lt;ref name=Dawn /&gt; To this, in his 1766 translation of Bonnet's work, [[Johann Daniel Titius]] added two of his own paragraphs, at the bottom of page 7 and at the beginning of page 8. The new interpolated paragraph is not found in Bonnet's original text, nor in translations of the work into Italian and English.

There are two parts to Titius's intercalated text. The first part explains the succession of planetary distances from the Sun: &lt;blockquote&gt;Take notice of the distances of the planets from one another, and recognize that almost all are separated from one another in a proportion which matches their bodily magnitudes. Divide the distance from the Sun to Saturn into 100 parts; then Mercury is separated by four such parts from the Sun, Venus by 4+3=7 such parts, the Earth by 4+6=10, Mars by 4+12=16. But notice that from Mars to Jupiter there comes a deviation from this so exact progression. From Mars there follows a space of 4+24=28 such parts, but so far no planet was sighted there. But should the Lord Architect have left that space empty? Not at all. Let us therefore assume that this space without doubt belongs to the still undiscovered satellites of Mars, let us also add that perhaps Jupiter still has around itself some smaller ones which have not been sighted yet by any telescope. Next to this for us still unexplored space there rises Jupiter's sphere of influence at 4+48=52 parts; and that of Saturn at 4+96=100 parts.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1772, [[Johann Elert Bode]], aged twenty-five, completed the second edition of his astronomical compendium ''Anleitung zur Kenntniss des gestirnten Himmels'' ("Manual for Knowing the Starry Sky"), into which he added the following footnote, initially unsourced, but credited to Titius in later versions (in Bode's memoir can be found a reference to Titius with clear recognition of his priority):&lt;ref name="hoskin"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hoskin|first=Michael|date=1992-06-26|url=http://www.astropa.unipa.it/HISTORY/hoskin.html|title=Bodes' Law and the Discovery of Ceres|publisher=Observatorio Astronomico di Palermo "Giuseppe S. Vaiana"|accessdate=2007-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This latter point seems in particular to follow from the astonishing relation which the known six planets observe in their distances from the Sun. Let the distance from the Sun to Saturn be taken as 100, then Mercury is separated by 4 such parts from the Sun. Venus is 4+3=7. The Earth 4+6=10. Mars 4+12=16. Now comes a gap in this so orderly progression. After Mars there follows a space of 4+24=28 parts, in which no planet has yet been seen. Can one believe that the Founder of the universe had left this space empty? Certainly not. From here we come to the distance of Jupiter by 4+48=52 parts, and finally to that of Saturn by 4+96=100 parts.&lt;/blockquote&gt;These two statements, for all their particular typology and the radii of the orbits, seem to stem from an antique cossist.&lt;ref&gt;The cossists were experts in calculations of all kinds and were employed by merchants and businessmen to solve complex accounting problems. Their name derives from the Italian word ''cosa'', meaning "thing", because they used symbols to represent an unknown quantity, similar to the way mathematicians use x today. All professional problem-solvers of this era invented their own clever methods for performing calculations and would do their utmost to keep these methods secret in order to maintain their reputation as the only person capable of solving a particular problem.&lt;/ref&gt; Many precedents were found from before the seventeenth century. Titius was a disciple of the German philosopher [[Christian Freiherr von Wolff|Christian Freiherr von Wolf]] (1679-1754). The second part of the inserted text in Bonnet's work is founded in a von Wolf work dated 1723, ''Vernünftige Gedanken von den Wirkungen der Natur''. Twentieth century literature about Titius–Bode law assigns the German philosopher authorship; if so, Titius could have learned from him. Another older reference was written by [[James Gregory (mathematician)|James Gregory]] in 1702, in his ''Astronomiae physicae et geometricae elementa'', where the succession of planetary distances 4, 7, 10, 16, 52 and 100 became a [[geometric progression]] of ratio 2. This is the nearest Newtonian formula, which is also contained in [[Benjamin Martin (lexicographer)|Benjamin Martin]] and Tomàs Cerdà years before the German publication of Bonnet's book.

Titius and Bode hoped that the law would lead to the discovery of new planets, and indeed the discovery of [[Uranus]] and [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], both of whose distances fit well with the law, contributed to the law's fame. Neptune's distance was very discrepant, however, and indeed Pluto—now discredited as a planet—is at a mean distance that roughly corresponds to that the Titus-Bode law predicted for the next planet out from Uranus.

When originally published, the law was approximately satisfied by all the known planets—[[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] through [[Saturn]]—with a gap between the fourth and fifth planets. It was regarded as interesting, but of no great importance until the discovery of Uranus in 1781, which happens to fit into the series. Based on this discovery, Bode urged a search for a fifth planet. {{dp|Ceres}}, the largest object in the [[asteroid belt]], was found at Bode's predicted position in 1801. Bode's law was then widely accepted until [[Discovery of Neptune|Neptune was discovered]] in 1846 and found not to satisfy the law. Simultaneously, the large number of asteroids discovered in the belt removed Ceres from the list of planets. Bode's law was discussed by the astronomer and logician [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] in 1898 as an example of fallacious reasoning.&lt;ref name="PeirceKetner1992"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Charles Sanders Peirce|authorlink1=Charles Sanders Peirce|first2=Kenneth |last1=Laine|last2= Ketner|title=Reasoning and the logic of things: the Cambridge conferences lectures of 1898|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=zdUkAQAAIAA|page=194J}}|year=1992|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|isbn=978-0-674-74966-5|pp=194–196}} [http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog/PEIREX.html HUP catalog page].&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery of [[Pluto]] in 1930 confounded the issue still further. Although nowhere near its position as predicted by Bode's law, it was roughly at the position the law had predicted for Neptune. However, the subsequent discovery of the [[Kuiper belt]], and in particular of the object {{dp|Eris}}, which is more massive than Pluto yet does not fit Bode's law, further discredited the formula.&lt;ref name="Boss"&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Alan Boss |date=October 2006 | title = Ask Astro | journal = Astronomy | volume = 30 | issue = 10 | page = 70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== A potentially earlier explanation ==
The Jesuit Tomàs Cerdà (1715-1791) gave a famous astronomy course in Barcelona in 1760, at the Royal Chair of Mathematics of the College of Sant Jaume de Cordelles (Imperial and Royal Seminary of Nobles of Cordellas).&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Ramon Parés. Distancias planetarias y ley de Titius-Bode (Historical essay). www.ramonpares.com&lt;/ref&gt; From the original manuscript preserved in the Royal Academy of History in Madrid, Lluís Gasiot remade ''Tratado de Astronomía'' from Cerdá, published in 1999, based on ''Astronomiae physicae'' from [[James Gregory (mathematician)|James Gregory]] (1702) and ''Philosophia Britannica'' from [[Benjamin Martin (lexicographer)|Benjamin Martin]] (1747). In the Cerdàs's ''Tratado'' appears the planetary distances obtained from the periodic times applying [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Kepler's third law]], with an accuracy of 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;. Taking as reference the distance from Earth as 10 and rounding to whole, the geometric progression [(D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; x 10) - 4] / [(D&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt; x 10) - 4] = 2, from n=2 to n=8 can be expressed. And using the circular uniform fictitious movement to Kepler's ''Anomaly'', R&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; values corresponding to each planet's ratios may be obtained as r&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = (R&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; - R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) / (R&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt; - R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) resulting 1.82; 1.84; 1.86; 1.88 and 1.90, which r&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = 2 - 0.02 (12 - n), the ratio between Keplerian succession and Titius-Bode Law, which would be a casual numerical coincidence. The reason is close to 2, but increases harmonically from 1.82.

The planet's average speed from n=1 to n=8 decreases moving away the Sun and differs from uniform descent in n=2 to recover from n=7 (orbital resonance).

==Data==
The Titius–Bode law predicts planets will be present at specific distances in [[astronomical units]], which can be compared to the observed data for several planets and [[dwarf planet]]s in the Solar System:

&lt;small&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; For large k, each Titius–Bode rule distance is approximately twice the preceding value. Hence, an arbitrary planet may be found within −25% to +50% of one of the predicted positions.  For small k the predicted distances do not fully double, so the range of potential deviation is smaller.  Note the semimajor axis is proportional to the 2/3 power of the [[orbital period]].  For example, planets in a 2:3 [[orbital resonance]] (such as [[plutino]]s relative to [[Neptune]]) will vary in distance by (2/3)&lt;sup&gt;2/3&lt;/sup&gt; = -23.69% and +31.04% relative to one another.

&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Ceres, now classified as a [[dwarf planet]], was considered a small planet from 1801 until the 1860s.  It orbits near the middle of the [[asteroid belt]], most of whose objects fall in three bands between -25% and +18% of the Titius-Bode rule distance (2.06 to 2.5 AU, 2.5 to 2.82 AU, 2.82 to 3.28 AU), which are separated by [[Kirkwood gaps]] representing 3:1, 5:2, and 2:1 resonances with Jupiter.

&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Pluto was considered a planet from 1930 to 2006, when it was reclassified as a dwarf planet.  Aside from the hypothetical [[Planet Nine]], none of the small objects beyond Neptune currently qualifies as a planet.
&lt;/small&gt;

==Theoretical explanations==
No solid theoretical explanation underlies the Titius–Bode law, but it is possible that given a combination of [[orbital resonance]] and shortage of [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]], any stable planetary system has a high probability of satisfying a Titius–Bode-type relationship. Since it may be a mathematical coincidence rather than a "law of nature", it is sometimes referred to as a rule instead of "law".&lt;ref name="CarrollOstlie2007"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Bradley W. |last1=Carroll|first2=Dale A. |last2=Ostlie|title=An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=M8wPAQAAMAAJ|page=716}}|year=2007|publisher=Pearson Addison-Wesley|isbn=978-0-8053-0402-2|pages=716–717}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[astrophysics|astrophysicist]] [[Alan Boss]] states that it is just a coincidence, and the [[planetary science]] journal ''[[Icarus (journal)|Icarus]]'' no longer accepts papers attempting to provide improved versions of the "law".&lt;ref name="Boss"/&gt;

Orbital resonance from major orbiting bodies creates regions around the [[Sun]] that are free of long-term stable orbits. Results from simulations of planetary formation support the idea that a randomly chosen stable planetary system will likely satisfy a Titius–Bode law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wayne Hayes|author2=Scott Tremaine|title=Fitting Selected Random Planetary Systems to Titius–Bode Laws|journal=Icarus|volume=135|issue=2|pages=549|date=October 1998|bibcode=1998Icar..135..549H|doi=10.1006/icar.1998.5999|url=https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~wayne/research/papers/bode.pdf|arxiv=astro-ph/9710116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lunar systems and other planetary systems===
Only a limited number of systems are available on which Bode's law can presently be tested. Two solar planets have enough large moons that probably have formed in a process similar to that which formed the planets. The four big satellites of [[Jupiter]] and the biggest inner satellite, [[Amalthea (moon)|Amalthea]], cling to a regular, but non-Titius–Bode, spacing, with the four innermost locked into orbital periods that are each twice that of the next inner satellite. The big moons of Uranus have a regular, non-Titius–Bode spacing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cohen |first=Howard L. |title=The Titius-Bode Relation Revisited |url=http://www.floridastars.org/9605cohe.html |accessdate=2008-02-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928205336/http://www.floridastars.org/9605cohe.html |archivedate=28 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to [[Martin Harwit]], "a slight new phrasing of this law permits us to include not only planetary orbits around the Sun, but also the orbits of moons around their parent planets."&lt;ref&gt;Harwit, Martin.

Of the recent discoveries of extrasolar planetary systems, few have enough known planets to test whether similar rules apply. An attempt with [[55 Cancri]] suggested the equation a = 0.0142 ''[[e (mathematical constant)|e]]''&lt;sup&gt; 0.9975 ''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, and controversially&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=0806.3532|title=The Titius-Bode Law Revisited But Not Revived|author=Ivan Kotliarov|author-link=Ivan Kotliarov|date=21 June 2008|class=physics.space-ph}}&lt;/ref&gt; predicts for ''n'' = 5 an undiscovered planet or asteroid field at 2 AU.&lt;ref name=lara&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Revista Mexicana de Astronomía y Astrofísica|issue=44|pages=243–246|date=2008|title=The Exo-Planetary System of 55 Cancri and the Titus-Bode Law|author=Arcadio Poveda|author2=Patricia Lara|last-author-amp=yes|url=http://www.astroscu.unam.mx/rmaa/RMxAA..44-1/PDF/RMxAA..44-1_apoveda.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the orbital period and semimajor axis of the innermost planet in the 55 Cancri system have been significantly revised (from 2.817 days to 0.737 days and from 0.038 AU to 0.016 AU respectively) since the publication of these studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Rebekah I.

Recent astronomical research suggests that planetary systems around some other stars may follow Titius–Bode-like laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eso.org/public/archives/releases/sciencepapers/eso1035/eso1035.pdf|accessdate=2010-08-24|title=The HARPS search for southern extra-solar planets|date=2010-08-23}} Section 8.2: "Extrasolar Titius-Bode-like laws?"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P.

They showed that 96% of these exoplanet systems adhere to a generalized Titius–Bode relation to a similar or greater extent than the Solar System does. The locations of potentially undetected exoplanets are predicted in each system.

Subsequent research detected five planet candidates from predicted 97 planets from the 68 planetary systems. The study showed that the actual number of planets could be larger. The occurrence rate of Mars- and Mercury-sized planets are currently unknown, so many planets could be missed due to their small size. Other reasons includes planets that do not transit the star or that the predicted space is occupied by [[circumstellar disk]]s. Despite this, the number of planets found with Titius–Bode law predictions were lower than expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1405.2259|title= Testing the Titius-Bode law predictions for Kepler multi-planet systems  |journal= Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society  |volume= 442  |pages= 674  |date=2014-05-09 |last1=  Huang  |first1= Chelsea X.  |last2=  Bakos  |first2= Gáspár Á.  |doi= 10.1093/mnras/stu906  |bibcode=2014MNRAS.442..674H  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2018 paper, the idea of a hypothetical eighth planet around [[TRAPPIST-1]] named "TRAPPIST-1i," was brought up by using the Titius–Bode law. 1i had a prediction based just on the Titius–Bode law of an orbital period of 27.53 ± 0.83 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10835|title=Predicting the Orbit of TRAPPIST-1i|last=Kipping|first=David|date=July 27, 2016|website=arXiv|archive-url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.10835.pdf|archive-date=July 27, 2016|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Václav Hampl''' (born on 1 July 1962) is a [[Czech Republic|Czech]] [[physiology|physiologist]] and politician who has been [[Senate of the Czech Republic|Senator]] from [[Senate district 27 – Prague 1|Prague 1]] since 2014. From 2006 to 2014, Hampl served as [[Rector (academia)|Rector]] of the [[Charles University]].

==Research==
Hampl was born in [[Prague]], [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1962. He received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] from the [[Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences]] in 1990.&lt;ref name=CV&gt;http://hampl.cuni.cz/doc/VH_CV.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; He did postgraduate work at the [[University of Minnesota Medical School]] and, since 2002, has been a professor of physiology at Charles University in Prague.&lt;ref name=CV/&gt; His research has focused on the [[pulmonary circulation]] and its use of [[nitric oxide]] as a [[signaling molecule|signaling agent]].&lt;ref name=CV/&gt; His research publications have been cited more than 2,500 times, his H-index is 22.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In February 2006, Hampl became the 507th [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of Charles University. After serving two four-years terms stipulated by law, he stepped down on 31 January 2014,&lt;ref name=CV/&gt; leaving the university in the hands of his elected successor [[Tomáš Zima]].

==Professional Membership==
In 2006-2011 Hampl served in the association of rectors of public, state and private higher education institutions in the Czech Republic, the Czech Rectors Conference, as its Vice-President for public relations and foreign affairs, and Vice-President for creative activities, respectively; in 2011-2014 he served as its President.&lt;ref name=CV/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://crc.muni.cz/history/elections.en.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 he was a member of the Board of Trustees of the [[Europaeum]].&lt;ref&gt;http://europaeum.org/europaeum/?q=node/906&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010-2011 he served as the Chair of the Bioethical Committee of the Czech Republic.&lt;ref name=CV/&gt;

In 2011-2015 he was a Board member of the [[European University Association]],&lt;ref name=CV/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eua.be/News/15-04-09/EUA_General_Assembly_Election_of_President_and_EUA_Board.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; where he also serves in the Research policy working group (since 2009) and the Steering Committee of Council for Doctoral Education (since 2013).&lt;ref name=CV/&gt;

==Politics==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=May 2015}}
He became publicly known mostly for successfully opposing the proposals of Minister of Health [[Tomáš Julínek]] to privatize public university hospitals in 2008, the proposals for considerably reduce academic decision-making in public universities by Minister of Education [[Josef Dobeš]] in 2012, and the successful conflict with the president of the country [[Miloš Zeman]] about the president's legal duty to nominate new university professors by following the rigorous procedures at individual school.

During his rectorship three large infrastructural project were prepared and mostly completed utilizing the European structural funds - the biomedical centers in Plzeň and Hradec Králové and a biotechnology center common with six institutions of [[Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic]] - [[BIOCEV]] in Vestec near Prague. Charles University also acquired a large building complex "Crystal" near the location of Faculty of sports, making expansion in the direction of "mini campuses" possible. The same is true for the acquisition of a double object in Opeatalova street in the centre of Prague, where still significant adjustments have to be done.

In September 2014 he was elected Senator in the district of central Prague (he run as independent with a joint support from Christian democrats and Green party). He serves as the chair of the Senate's Committee on European Union Affairs.

In 2018 [[Christian and Democratic Union – Czechoslovak People's Party]] nominated him for the President of the Senate. [[President of the Senate of the Czech Republic election, 2018|Election]] was held on 14 November 2018. Hampl advanced to the second round but was defeated by [[Jaroslav Kubera]].
