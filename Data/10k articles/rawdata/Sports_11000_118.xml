In the '''Battle of the Bowling Alley ''' (August 12–25, 1950), [[United Nations]] (UN) forces defeated [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea|North Korean]] forces early in the [[Korean War]] near the city of [[Taegu]], [[South Korea]].  The battle took place in a narrow valley, dubbed the "Bowling Alley", which was north of Taegu. It followed a week of fighting between the [[Korean People's Army]] (KPA) [[13th Division (North Korea)|13th Division]] and the [[Republic of Korea Army]]'s (ROK) [[1st Infantry Division (South Korea)|1st Division]] along the latter's last defensible line in the hills north of the city. Reinforcements, including the [[US Army]]'s [[27th Infantry Regiment (United States)|27th]] and [[23rd Infantry Regiment (United States)|23rd Infantry Regiment]]s were committed to bolster the South Koreans' defenses. This battle and several others were smaller engagements of the [[Battle of Pusan Perimeter]].

For another week, North Korean divisions launched all the troops they had in massed attacks against the ROK and US lines. Their attacks, which usually occurred at night and were supported by armor and artillery, advanced with infantry and tanks in close support of one another. Each North Korean attack ran into well-established UN lines, where US tanks, mines and entrenched infantry were positioned to counter them. Strikes by US aircraft ravaged the attacking North Koreans. The fighting was fierce with many casualties on both sides, particularly where the North and South Koreans fought one another. The repeated attacks eventually broke and pushed back the North Korean forces. They continued their push against the Pusan Perimeter until they were outflanked in the [[Battle of Inchon]].

==Background==
===Outbreak of war===
[[File:Task Force Smith.jpg|thumb|240px|alt=Soldiers carrying their bags off of a train in a Korean train station|Task Force Smith arrives in South Korea.]]
Following the invasion of the South Korea by North Korea on June 25, 1950, the UN voted to use force to defend South Korea. The United States, a member of the UN, simultaneously committed ground forces to the Korean peninsula with the goal of pushing back the North Korean invasion and preventing South Korea from collapsing. But US forces in the [[Far East]] had been steadily decreasing since the end of [[World War II]], five years earlier, and at the time the closest force was the [[24th Infantry Division (United States)|24th Infantry Division]], headquartered in Japan. The division was understrength, and most of its equipment was antiquated due to reductions in military spending. Nevertheless, the 24th was ordered to South Korea.&lt;ref name="Var3"&gt;{{harvnb|Varhola|2000|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 24th Infantry Division was the first US unit sent into Korea with the mission to take the initial "shock" of North Korean advances, delaying much larger North Korean units to buy time to allow reinforcements to arrive.&lt;ref name=Alexander52&gt;{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; The division fought for several weeks while the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry]], [[7th Infantry Division (United States)|7th Infantry]] and [[25th Infantry Division (United States)|25th Infantry]] Divisions and [[Eighth United States Army]] supporting units were arriving.&lt;ref name=Alexander52/&gt; Advance elements of the 24th were badly defeated in the [[Battle of Osan]] on July 5, the first encounter between American and North Korean forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Catchpole|2001|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first month after the defeat at Osan, the 24th Infantry Division was repeatedly defeated and forced south by superior North Korean numbers and equipment.&lt;ref name="Var4"&gt;{{harvnb|Varhola|2000|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alex90"&gt;{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; The regiments of the division were systematically pushed south in engagements around [[Battle of Chochiwon|Chochiwon]], [[Battle of Chonan|Chonan]], and [[Battle of Pyongtaek|Pyongtaek]].&lt;ref name="Var4"/&gt; The 24th was finally annihilated in the [[Battle of Taejon]], but was able to delay the North Korean forces until July 20.&lt;ref name="Alex105"&gt;{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; By that time, the Eighth Army's force of combat troops were roughly equal to North Korean forces attacking the region, with new UN units arriving every day.&lt;ref name="Fehr103"&gt;{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North Korean advance===
[[File:Pusan Perimeter.jpg|thumb|300px|Tactical map of the Pusan Perimeter in August 1950. The fight at P'ohang-dong occurred between North and South Korean forces on the northeastern line.|alt=A map of a perimeter on the southeastern tip of a land mass]]
After the fight at Taejon, UN forces were pushed back repeatedly before finally halting the North Korean advance in a series of engagements in the southern section of the country. Forces of the 3rd Battalion, [[29th Infantry Regiment (United States)|29th Infantry]], newly arrived in the country, were wiped out at [[Hadong]] in a [[Hadong Ambush|coordinated ambush]] by North Korean forces on July 27, opening a pass to the Pusan area from the west.&lt;ref name="Apple221"&gt;{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, North Korean forces took [[Chinju]], east of Hadong, pushing back the US [[19th Infantry Regiment (United States)|19th Infantry Regiment]] and leaving routes to Pusan open to direct North Korean attacks.&lt;ref name="Catch24"&gt;{{harvnb|Catchpole|2001|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN formations were subsequently able to defeat the North Koreans in the [[Battle of the Notch]] on August 2, halting their advance from the west. Suffering mounting losses, the KPA force withdrew for several days to re-equip and receive reinforcements. This granted both sides a reprieve to prepare for the attack on the Pusan Perimeter.&lt;ref name="Catchpole 2001 25"&gt;{{harvnb|Catchpole|2001|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taegu===
Meanwhile, the Eighth Army commander [[Lieutenant General (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Walton Walker]] had established [[Taegu]] as his headquarters.&lt;ref name="Fehr135"&gt;{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the center of the Pusan Perimeter line, Taegu stood at the entrance to the [[Naktong River]] valley, an area where North Korean forces could advance in large numbers in close support. The natural barriers provided by the Naktong River to the south and the mountainous terrain to the north converged around Taegu, a transportation hub and the last major South Korean city aside from Pusan itself to remain in UN hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=335}}&lt;/ref&gt; From south to north, the city was defended by the US 1st Cavalry Division, the ROK 1st Division and the [[6th Infantry Division (South Korea)|6th Division]], which were under the command of [[ROK II Corps]]. The 1st Cavalry Division was spread out along a long line on the Naktong River to the south, with its [[5th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|5th Cavalry]] and [[8th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|8th Cavalry]] regiments holding a {{convert|24000|m|sp=us|adj=on}} line along the river south of Waegwan, facing west. The [[7th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|7th Cavalry]] held position to the east in reserve, along with artillery forces, ready to reinforce anywhere a North Korean crossing could be attempted. The ROK 1st Division held a northwest-facing line in the mountains immediately north of the city while the ROK 6th Division held position to the east, guarding the narrow valley holding the Kunwi road into the Pusan Perimeter area.&lt;ref name="Apple337"&gt;{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five North Korean divisions amassed around Taegu to oppose the UN forces in the city. From south to north, the [[10th Division (North Korea)|10th]],&lt;ref name="Apple253"&gt;{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=253}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[3rd Division (North Korea)|3rd]], [[15th Division (North Korea)|15th]], [[13th Division (North Korea)|13th]],&lt;ref name="Apple254"&gt;{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=254}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[1st Division (North Korea)|1st North Korean Division]]s occupied a wide line encircling Taegu from Tuksong-dong and around [[Waegwan]] to Kunwi.&lt;ref name="Leckie112"&gt;{{harvnb|Leckie|1996|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; The North Korean army planned to use the natural corridor of the Naktong River valley from [[Sangju]] to Taegu as its main axis of attack for the next push south, so the KPA divisions all eventually moved through this valley, crossing the Naktong at different areas along the low ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=336}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elements of the [[NK 105th Armored Division]] also supported the attack.&lt;ref name="Apple337"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Catch31"&gt;{{harvnb|Catchpole|2001|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prelude==
===US forces assemble===
During mid-August, the US 27th Infantry Regiment was mopping up North Korean resistance from the southern part of the [[Battle of Naktong Bulge|Naktong Bulge]] area to counter a North Korean attack there. The regiment, temporarily attached to the US 24th Infantry Division, was recalled by the Eighth Army when a new North Korean threat formed to the north of Taegu, alarming Walker. Acting on the threat, Walker relieved the regiment from the 24th Infantry Division on August 14 and the next day ordered it northward to [[Kyongsan]] as a [[military reserve|reserve force]]. Arriving at Kyongsan on August 16, [[Colonel (US)|Colonel]] [[John H. Michaelis]], 27th Infantry's commander, was ordered to reconnoiter routes east, north, northwest, and west of Kyongsan and counter any North Korean attacks from these directions. During the day, two North Korean [[T-34]] tanks came through the ROK 1st Division lines {{convert|12|mi}} north of Taegu at [[Tabu-dong]], but South Korean [[Bazooka#Korean War|3.5-inch bazooka]] teams knocked out both of them.&lt;ref name="Apple353"&gt;{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=353}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ROK 1st Division, also in the area, was ordered to assemble in the hills around the road and wait for reinforcements or make a [[last stand]] if needed to prevent the North Koreans from coming any closer to Taegu. To its east was the ROK 6th Division and to its west was the Naktong River.&lt;ref name="Mil10220"&gt;{{harvnb|Millett|2010|p=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Maj. Gen. Paik Sun Yup.jpg|thumb|left|alt=An Asian man in a military uniform in an outdoor setting|ROK [[Brigadier General]] [[Paik Sun Yup]].]]
At 12:00 the next day, August 17, Eighth Army ordered the 27th Infantry to move its headquarters and a reinforced [[battalion]] "without delay" to a point across the [[Kumho River]] {{convert|3|mi}} north of Taegu on the road from Tabu-dong to Sangju "to secure Taegu from enemy penetration" from that direction.&lt;ref name="Mil2000464"&gt;{{harvnb|Millett|2000|p=464}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Korean sources reported a North Korean regiment, led by six T-34 tanks, had entered the village of Kumhwa, {{convert|2|mi}} north of Tabu-dong.&lt;ref name="Apple353"/&gt; The 1st Battalion, 27th Infantry, a [[platoon]] of the Heavy Mortar Company, and most of the 8th Field Artillery Battalion moved north to [[Ch'ilgok]] where the ROK 1st Division command post was located.&lt;ref name="Mil2000464"/&gt; By nightfall, the entire 27th Regiment was north of Taegu on the Tabu-dong road, reinforced by C [[Company (military)|Company]], 73rd Tank Battalion.&lt;ref name="Apple353"/&gt; US Army commanders also ordered the 37th Field Artillery Battalion to move from the area around [[Kyongju]] and [[P'ohang-dong]], where a [[Battle of P'ohang-dong|heavy battle]] had been in progress for days, for attachment to the US 27th Infantry Regiment in order to reinforce the 8th Field Artillery Battalion above Taegu. It arrived there the next day.&lt;ref name="Mil2000464"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Apple354"&gt;{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=354}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the front, ROK 1st Division commander [[Brigadier General]] [[Paik Sun-yup]] assumed senior command of the 27th Infantry and the other US units, to the chagrin of Michaelis.&lt;ref name="Mil10221"/&gt;

===North Korean forces assemble===
In its engagements during the Perimeter battle, the KPA 13th Division, with 9,500 men,&lt;ref name="Apple255"&gt;{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; had forced South Korean troops into the Tabu-dong corridor and started advancing on Taegu.&lt;ref name="Paik36"/&gt; This division had battled the ROK 11th and 12th Regiments in the [[Yuhak-san]] area for a week before it broke through to the corridor on August 17.&lt;ref name="Paik34"/&gt; A regimental commander of the division said later it suffered 1,500 casualties in the process. On August 18, the 13th Division was concentrated mostly west of the road just north of Tabu-dong.&lt;ref name="Apple354"/&gt;

To the west of the KPA 13th Division, the KPA 15th Division with 5,000 men&lt;ref name="Apple255"/&gt; was also deployed on Yuhak-san.&lt;ref name="Mil2000466"&gt;{{harvnb|Millett|2000|p=466}}&lt;/ref&gt; It, too, had begun battling the ROK 1st Division, but thus far only in minor engagements. The North Korean High Command then ordered the KPA 15th Division to move from its position northwest of Tabu-dong eastward, to the [[Yongch'on]] front, where the KPA [[8th Division (North Korea)|8th Division]] had tried and failed to advance to the Taegu lateral corridor. The KPA 15th Division left the Yuhak-san area on August 20. Meanwhile, the KPA 1st Division, to the east of the 13th, advanced to the Kunwi area, {{convert|25|mi}} north of Taegu. The North Korean command ordered it to proceed to the Tabu-dong area and maneuver astride the 13th Division for the attack on Taegu down the Tabu-dong corridor. At the same time, the North Koreans received their only substantial tank reinforcements during the Pusan Perimeter fighting.&lt;ref name="Mil2000464"/&gt; On August 15, the KPA [[105th Armored Division (North Korea)|105th Armored Division]] received 21 new T-34 tanks and 200 troop replacements, which it distributed to the divisions attacking Taegu. The tank regiment with the KPA 13th Division reportedly had 14 T-34 tanks.&lt;ref name="Mil10221"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Apple354"/&gt;

On August 18, the KPA 13th Division was astride the Sangju–Taegu road just above Tabu-dong and only {{convert|13|mi}} from Taegu. The Eighth Army ordered the 27th Infantry Regiment to attack north along the road to counter the threat.&lt;ref name="Mil10221"&gt;{{harvnb|Millett|2010|p=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, two regiments of the ROK 1st Division were to attack along high ground on either side of the road.&lt;ref name="Mil2000464"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Apple354"/&gt; The plan called for a limited-objective attack to restore the ROK 1st Division lines in the vicinity of [[Sokchok]], a village {{convert|4|mi}} north of Tabu-dong. [[M26 Pershing]] tanks of C Company, 73rd Tank Battalion, and two batteries of the 37th Field Artillery Battalion were to support the 27th Infantry in the attack.&lt;ref name="Apple355"&gt;{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terrain===
{{wide image|The Bowling Alley.jpg|600px|alt=A long, narrow valley|The Bowling Alley, 1950}}
In front of the 27th Infantry position, the [[Populus|poplar]]-lined Taegu–Sangju road ran northward in the narrow mountain valley. A stream on the west closely paralleled the road, which was nearly straight on a north-south axis through the 27th Infantry position and for some distance northward. This stretch of the road later became known as the "Bowling Alley."&lt;ref name="Apple356"&gt;{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=356}}&lt;/ref&gt; About {{convert|1|mi}} in front of the 27th Infantry position the road forked at a small village called [[Ch'onp'yong-dong]]; the western prong was the main Sangju road, the eastern one was the road to [[Kunwi]]. At the road fork, the Sangju road bends to the northwest in a long curve. The village of Sinjumak lay on this curve a short distance north of the fork. Hills protected it against direct fire from the 27th Infantry position. It was there that the North Korean tanks remained hidden during the daytime.&lt;ref name="Apple356"/&gt;

Rising from the valley on the west side was the Yuhak-san mountain range which swept up to a height of {{convert|2700|ft}}. On the east, a similar mountain range rose to a height of {{convert|2,400|ft}}, culminating {{convert|2.5|mi}} southward in a mountain called [[Ka-san]], more than {{convert|2,900|ft}} high at its walled summit. The Kunwi and Sangju roads from the northeast and northwest entered the natural and easy corridor between Yuhak-san and Ka-san at Ch'onp'yong-dong, leading into the Taegu basin. The battles in the Bowling Alley occurred south of this road junction.&lt;ref name="Apple356"/&gt;

==Battle==
===Deadlock===
The ROK 1st Infantry Division, with 7,500 men&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Paik|1992|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; had held the line around the Bowling Alley since August 12.&lt;ref name="Paik34"&gt;{{harvnb|Paik|1992|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bowling Alley area was selected because of its advantageous high ground which provided natural barriers to funnel North Korean troops into smaller fronts where South Korean defenses could attack them from the high ground in concealed positions.&lt;ref name="Paik35"&gt;{{harvnb|Paik|1992|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, the KPA 3rd, 13th, and 15th Divisions were advancing south and preparing to close on Taegu.&lt;ref name="Paik36"&gt;{{harvnb|Paik|1992|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alex144"&gt;{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; The KPA 13th Division converged on the Tabu-dong corridor and a vicious melee ensued between the North and South Korean troops, with ROK 1st Division's 11th, 12th, and 13th regiments committed against the KPA 13th Division's 19th, 21st and 23rd regiments.&lt;ref name="Paik39"/&gt; The fight became a [[Attrition warfare|battle of attrition]].&lt;ref name="Paik37"&gt;{{harvnb|Paik|1992|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the two sides closed on one another, the battle took a brutal turn by August 15 as supplies ran low and units were locked in close quarters combat with little ammunition for the weapons. Fighting across the entire front became [[hand-to-hand]] combat and [[grenade]] fights at close range. The two divisions were so evenly matched that neither could make any appreciable gains for days of fighting and huge numbers of casualties.&lt;ref name="Paik38"&gt;{{harvnb|Paik|1992|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bloody fighting obliged Paik to call for emergency reinforcements to hold the line. The Eighth Army responded immediately by sending the US 27th Infantry&lt;ref name="Alex145"&gt;{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the ROK 10th Regiment from the ROK 8th Division to reinforce the ROK 1st Division's three regiments. [[US Air Force]] aircraft also conducted a [[Battle of Taegu#Carpet bombing|carpet bombing campaign]] against the advancing North Korean positions to undetermined effect.&lt;ref name="Paik39"&gt;{{harvnb|Paik|1992|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around that time the KPA 15th Division, which had been supporting the KPA 13th Division, withdrew from the front to attack elsewhere, leaving the ROK 1st Division, with the US 27th Infantry, and the KPA 13th Division as principal opponents in the conflict that followed.&lt;ref name="Alex145"/&gt;

===US infantry advance===
As the 27th Infantry's trucks rolled northward from Tabu-dong and approached their [[Line of Departure]], the men inside could see the North Koreans and South Koreans fighting on the ridges overlooking the road. The infantry dismounted and deployed an attacking line, with the 1st Battalion on the left of the road and the 2nd Battalion on the right. With US tanks leading the infantry on the road, the two battalions crossed the line at 13:00. The tanks opened fire against the mountain [[escarpments]] to aid the South Korean infantry engaged there. The US infantry on either side of the road swept the lower hills, as the tanks on the road paced their advance with the infantry. A North Korean outpost line in the valley withdrew and there was almost no North Korean opposition during the first hour of the US advance. North Korean outpost lines were {{convert|2.5|mi}} in front of their main positions. The 27th Infantry had reached a point about {{convert|2|mi}} north of Tabu-dong when Michaelis was informed that neither of the ROK regiments on the high ground flanking the valley road had been able to advance.&lt;ref name="Alex145"/&gt; He was ordered to halt and form a perimeter defense with both battalions astride the road.&lt;ref name="Apple355"/&gt;

The two battalions of the 27th Infantry went into a perimeter defense just north of the village of Soi-ri.&lt;ref name="Paik40"&gt;{{harvnb|Paik|1992|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1st Battalion, on the left of the road, took a position with C Company on high ground in front, and with A Company on a ridge behind it. On their right, B Company was placed parallel to A Company, and carried the line across the stream and the narrow valley to the road. There the 2nd Battalion took up the defense line with E Company on the road and F Company on its right, while G Company held a ridge behind F Company. Thus, the two battalions presented a four-company front, with one company holding a [[refused flank]] position on either side. A platoon of tanks took positions on the front line, two tanks on the road and two in the stream bed, with four more tanks in reserve. The artillery went into firing positions behind the force. Six bazooka teams took up positions in front of the infantry positions along the road and in the stream bed. At the same time, the ROK 1st Division remained in control of the high ground on either side of the 27th Infantry positions.&lt;ref name="Apple355"/&gt;

=== August 18 attack ===
The first of seven successive North Korean night attacks struck the 27th Infantry defensive perimeter shortly after dark that night, August 18.&lt;ref name="Mil10221"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Paik41"&gt;{{harvnb|Paik|1992|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; North Korean mortars and artillery fired a heavy preparation for the general attack for several hours.&lt;ref name="Alex145"/&gt; Two T-34 tanks and an [[SU-76]] [[self-propelled gun]] moved out of the village of Sinjumak {{convert|2|mi}} in front of the 27th Infantry lines. Infantry followed them, some in trucks and others on foot. The lead tank moved slowly and without firing, apparently observing, while the second one and the SU-76 fired repeatedly into F Company's position. As the tanks drew near, a 3.5-inch bazooka team from F Company destroyed the second one in the line.&lt;ref name="Apple356"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alex145"/&gt;

Bazooka teams also hit the lead tank, causing its crew to abandon it. Fire from the 8th Field Artillery Battalion knocked out the self-propelled gun, destroyed two trucks, and killed or wounded an estimated 100 North Korean troops at the point of the advance. US [[First Lieutenant]] [[Lewis Millett]], an artillery [[forward observer]] and later a [[Medal of Honor]] winner after he transferred to the infantry, directed this artillery fire on the North Koreans, even as a T-34 tank approached within {{convert|50|ft}} of his position.&lt;ref name="Apple357"/&gt; Three more North Korean tanks had come down the road but, on realizing that the Americans had effective anti-tank weapons, they switched on their running lights and retreated north without engaging the UN troops.&lt;ref name="Alex146"&gt;{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 00:30 on August 19 the first North Korean attack had stalled and they withdrew. North Korean troops made a second effort, much weaker than the first, around 02:30, but artillery and mortar fire dispersed them before they reached the UN lines.&lt;ref name="Apple357"&gt;{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of the next week, the US troops were able to discern the North Koreans' system of attack and use it to their advantage. The North Koreans used a system of flares to signal various actions and coordinate them. It quickly became apparent to the defending Americans that green flares were used to signal an attack on a given area. So the 27th Infantry obtained its own green flares and then, after the North Korean attack had begun, fired them over its main defensive positions.&lt;ref name="Apple357"/&gt; This confused the attacking forces and often drew them to the points of greatest US strength where they suffered massive casualties from defensive machine-gun crossfire.&lt;ref name="Alex146"/&gt; The US troops also began using land mines in front of their positions to stall the North Koreans. The mines stopped the tanks and the infantry tried to remove them. When this happened, US troops fired flares to illuminate the scene and pre-registered artillery and mortar fire blasted the immobilized North Koreans. This tactic was effective in inflicting further significant casualties.&lt;ref name="Apple357"/&gt;

=== Stalemate ===
On the morning of August 19, the ROK 11th and 13th Regiments launched counterattacks along the ridges with some gains, however the fight continued to produce heavy casualties for both sides.&lt;ref name="Paik41"/&gt; Walker ordered another reserve unit, a battalion of the ROK 10th Regiment, to the Taegu front to close a gap between the ROK 1st and 6th Divisions.&lt;ref name="Apple358"/&gt; Later in the day, Walker also ordered the US 23rd Infantry Regiment, under command of Colonel [[Paul L. Freeman, Jr.]], to move up and establish a defense perimeter around the 8th and 37th Field Artillery Battalions at their positions {{convert|8|mi}} north of Taegu, to protect them from North Korean attack.&lt;ref name="Mil2000465"&gt;{{harvnb|Millett|2000|p=465}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the only occasion during the war that two US regiments were assigned to a South Korean command.&lt;ref name="Paik42"&gt;{{harvnb|Paik|1992|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 3rd Battalion, 23rd Infantry took up a defensive position around the artillery while the 2nd Battalion occupied a defensive position on the road behind the 27th Infantry. The next day the two battalions exchanged places.&lt;ref name="Apple358"&gt;{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=358}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Korean troops, suffering losses from the fighting, began recruiting students and civilians from nearby villages to fight.&lt;ref name="Mil2000465"/&gt;

[[File:Waegwan Tanks.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=A pair of heavily damaged tanks destroyed in a ditch|Destroyed North Korean T-34 tanks, 1950.]]
There was little fighting on the ground during the day on August 20. However, US aircraft attacked North Korean positions around Taegu repeatedly during the day, often in close proximity to American ground forces. As night fell, North Korean troops launched a second attack, firing a barrage of 120–mm. mortar shells into the 27th Infantry's Heavy Weapons Company area at 17:00; several of their tanks also began advancing down the corridor. The US troops responded with artillery and mortar fire, hitting the North Korean column and its accompanying infantry. Waiting Americans held their small arms and machine gun fire until the North Koreans were within {{convert|200|ft}} of their positions. The combined fire of all the US weapons repulsed this attack.&lt;ref name="Apple358"/&gt;

The next morning, August 21, a US patrol of two platoons of infantry and M26 Pershing tanks went up the road toward the North Korean positions. [[White flag]]s had appeared in front of the American line, and civilians in the area said many North Koreans wanted to surrender. The US patrol's mission was to investigate this situation and to form an estimate of North Koreans losses. The patrol advanced about {{convert|1|mi}}, engaging small North Korean groups and receiving some artillery fire. On its way it destroyed five disabled North Korean tanks with [[thermite]] grenades. The patrol also found a 37&amp;nbsp;mm anti-tank gun, two SU-76 self-propelled guns, and a 120&amp;nbsp;mm mortar among the destroyed North Korean equipment, as well as recognizing a large number of North Korean dead. At the point of farthest advance, the patrol found and destroyed an abandoned T-34 tank in a village schoolhouse courtyard.&lt;ref name="Apple359"&gt;{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=359}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== August 21 attack ===
That evening, the 27th Infantry placed two belts of antipersonnel mines and [[trip flare]]s across the road and stream bed {{convert|250|ft}} and {{convert|150|ft}} in front of its positions in the valley. After dusk, the North Koreans began shelling the general area of the 27th Infantry positions until just before midnight.&lt;ref name="Apple359"/&gt; ROK troops had planned to mount an attack, but it became apparent that the North Koreans would hit first.&lt;ref name="Paik43"&gt;{{harvnb|Paik|1992|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then the KPA 13th Division launched a major attack against the entire UN front in and around the valley.&lt;ref name="Mil2000467"&gt;{{harvnb|Millett|2000|p=467}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nine US tanks supported the infantry troops in the valley. Because it was on higher ground and positioned in front of all the other American units, C Company on the left of the road usually was the first to detect an approaching attack. That evening the C Company commander telephoned the regimental headquarters that he could hear tanks. When the artillery fired an illuminating shell he was able to count 19 North Korean vehicles in the attacking column on the road. The tanks and self-propelled guns approached the American positions, firing rapidly. Most of their shells landed in the rear areas. North Korean infantry moved forward on both sides of the road. Simultaneously, other North Korean units attacked the ROK troops on the high ridges flanking the valley.&lt;ref name="Apple359"/&gt;

American artillery and mortar fire bombarded the North Koreans, trying to separate the tanks from the infantry.&lt;ref name="Mil2000467"/&gt; US machine gun fire opened on the KPA infantry only after they had entered the mine field and were at close range. The US Pershing tanks in the front line held their fire until the North Korean tanks came very close. One of the American tanks knocked out the lead North Korean tank and a bazooka team from F Company knocked out a towed gun, the third vehicle in column. The trapped second tank was disabled by bazooka fire and abandoned by its crew.&lt;ref name="Apple359"/&gt; It was during this fight that the battle received its name. The US troops at the battle noted the tank shells being fired up and down the valley in the dark looked "like bowling balls."&lt;ref name="Paik42"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mil2000467"/&gt;

Artillery and 90&amp;nbsp;mm tank fire destroyed seven more North Korean T-34 tanks, three more SU-76 towed guns, and several trucks and personnel carriers. This night battle, which was at times very intense, lasted about five hours. The US B Battery, 8th Field Artillery Battalion alone fired 1,661 105&amp;nbsp;mm rounds, the 4.2-inch mortar platoon fired 902 rounds, the 81&amp;nbsp;mm mortar platoon fired 1,200 rounds, and F Company, 27th Infantry fired 385 60&amp;nbsp;mm mortar rounds. The North Korean column was completely destroyed.&lt;ref name="Apple359"/&gt; US patrols after daylight estimated the North Koreans had suffered 1,300 casualties in the fight.&lt;ref name="Alex146"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mil2000467"/&gt; Eleven prisoners captured by the patrol said the action had decimated their units and that the division was only at 25 percent strength.&lt;ref name="Apple359"/&gt;

=== North Korean flanking moves ===
During the night battle, North Korean forces infiltrated along the high ridge line around the east flank of the 27th Infantry and appeared the next day at about 12:00 {{convert|6|mi}} in the rear of that regiment and only {{convert|9|mi}} from Taegu. This force was a regiment of the KPA 1st Division and was 1,500 men strong. The regiment had just arrived from the Kunwi area to join in the battle for Taegu.&lt;ref name="Alex147"&gt;{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; It began ambushing supply lines to the American forces in the valley.&lt;ref name="Apple360"&gt;{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=360}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the regiment's companies attacked the ROK 1st Division's headquarters with intent to capture Paik, but was repulsed by the ROK 10th Regiment.&lt;ref name="Paik41"/&gt;

About this time, Michaelis sent an urgent message to Eighth Army saying that the ROK troops on his left had given way and that "those people are not fighting."&lt;ref name="Apple360"/&gt; One of the battalions of the ROK 11th Regiment had been driven back and was retreating in disarray.&lt;ref name="Paik43"/&gt; Prisoners told him that about 1,000 North Koreans were on his west flank. He asked for an air strike. Had these South Korean troops been driven from this high ground, the perimeter position of the 27th Infantry Regiment would have been untenable. Paik bitterly resented Michaelis' charge that his men were not fighting, and in the argument, Eighth Army [[Korean Military Advisory Group]] advisers visited each ROK unit to ensure they were remaining in position.&lt;ref name="Apple360"/&gt; Paik personally rallied the ROK 11th Regiment for a charge back into its positions, impressing Michaelis.&lt;ref name="Paik44"&gt;{{harvnb|Paik|1992|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Michaelis apologized to Paik though their relationship for the remainder of the battle remained strained.&lt;ref name="Mil10221"/&gt;

On the afternoon of August 22, 2nd Battalion, 23rd Infantry, guarding the support artillery behind the 27th Infantry, came under attack by the KPA 1st Division troops that had passed around the forward positions.&lt;ref name="Alex147"/&gt; Freeman reported to Eighth Army at 16:40 that the North Koreans had shelled the rear battery of the 37th Field Artillery Battalion, that North Korean infantry were between the US 27th and US 23rd Regiments on the road, and that other North Korean groups had passed around the east side of his forward battalion. An intense artillery barrage began falling on the headquarters area of the 8th Field Artillery Battalion at 16:05, and 25 minutes later two direct hits destroyed the [[fire direction center]], killing four officers and two non-commissioned officers. The individual batteries quickly took over control of the battalion fires and continued to support the infantry, while the battalion [[Headquarters and Headquarters Company]] withdrew under fire.&lt;ref name="Apple361"&gt;{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=361}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UN aircraft launched air strikes on the North Korean-held ridge east of the road and on the valley beyond.&lt;ref name="Mil10221"/&gt; That night, Walker released control of the 23rd Infantry, less the 1st Battalion, to the US 1st Cavalry Division with orders for it to clear the North Koreans from the road and the commanding ground overlooking the [[main supply route]].&lt;ref name="Alex147"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Apple361"/&gt;

About 10:00, [[Lieutenant Colonel]] Chong Pong Uk, commanding the artillery regiment supporting the KPA 13th Division, walked up alone to a ROK 1st Division position {{convert|3|mi|km}} north of Tabu-dong and defected.&lt;ref name="Mil10221"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Apple361"/&gt; Chong, the highest ranking North Korean prisoner of war thus far in the war, gave precise information on the location of his artillery.&lt;ref name="Mil2000467"/&gt; According to him, there were seven 122&amp;nbsp;mm howitzers and thirteen 76&amp;nbsp;mm guns emplaced and camouflaged in an orchard {{convert|4.5|mi}} north of Tabu-dong, in a little valley on the north side of Yuhak-san. Upon receiving this information, Eighth Army immediately prepared to destroy the North Korean weapons. Fighter-bombers attacked the orchard site with [[napalm]], and US artillery took the location under fire.&lt;ref name="Mil2000467"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Apple361"/&gt; Chong was eventually commissioned in South Korea's armed forces.&lt;ref name="Mil10221"/&gt;

=== Final moves ===
During the night of August 22–23, the North Koreans launched a weak attack against the 27th Infantry, which was quickly repulsed. Just before 12:00 on August 23, however, a violent action occurred some distance behind the front line when about 100 North Korean soldiers, undetected, succeeded in reaching the positions of K Company, 27th Infantry and of the 1st Platoon, C Company, 65th Engineer Combat Battalion. They overran parts of these positions before being driven off and suffering 50 killed. Meanwhile, as ordered by Walker, the 2nd Battalion, 23rd Infantry, after repelling several North Korean night attacks, counterattacked at dawn and seized the high ground overlooking the road at the artillery positions. At the same time the 3rd Battalion started an all-day attack that swept a stretch of high ground east of the road. This action largely cleared the North Koreans from the area behind and on the flanks of the 27th Infantry. At 13:35, Michaelis reported from the Bowling Alley to Eighth Army that the KPA 13th Division had blown the road to his front, had mined it, and was withdrawing.&lt;ref name="Apple362"&gt;{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=362}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mil2000468"&gt;{{harvnb|Millett|2000|p=468}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next day, August 24, the 23rd Infantry continued clearing the rear areas and by night it estimated that there were fewer than 200 North Koreans behind the forward positions. The Bowling Alley front was quiet during the day. Shortly after midnight on August 24 the North Koreans launched what had by now become their regular nightly attack down the Bowling Alley. This attack was in an estimated two-company strength supported by a few tanks. The 27th Infantry broke up the attack and two more North Korean tanks were destroyed by the supporting artillery fire. This was the last night the 27th Infantry Regiment spent in the Bowling Alley.&lt;ref name="Alex147"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Apple362"/&gt;

With the North Koreans turned back north of Taegu, Walker issued orders for the 27th Infantry to leave the Bowling Alley and return to the 25th Division in the [[Masan]] area.&lt;ref name="Mil2000469"&gt;{{harvnb|Millett|2000|p=469}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ROK 1st Division was to assume responsibility for the Bowling Alley, but the 23rd Infantry was to remain north of Taegu in its support. ROK relief of the 27th Infantry began at 18:00, 25 August, and continued throughout the night until completed at 03:45 August 26. Survivors of the 1st Regiment, KPA 1st Division, joined the rest of that division in the mountains east of the Taegu–Sangju road near the walled summit of Ka-san. Prisoners reported that the 1st Regiment was down to about 400 men and had lost all its 120&amp;nbsp;mm mortars, 76&amp;nbsp;mm howitzers, and antitank guns as a result of its action on the east flank of the KPA 13th Division at the Bowling Alley.&lt;ref name="Apple363"&gt;{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
The confirmed North Korean losses from August 18 to 25 included 13 T-34 tanks, five SU-76 self-propelled guns, and 23 trucks.&lt;ref name="Apple362"/&gt; The KPA 13th Division's troops suffered heavy casualties during the fight, with an estimated 3,000 killed, wounded and captured. The division withdrew to rebuild.&lt;ref name="Mil10221"/&gt; The North Koreans' total casualties from August 12 to 25 were 5,690 killed.&lt;ref name="Paik45"&gt;{{harvnb|Paik|1992|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

US losses during the battle were extremely light; unusual for fighting at a time in which other UN offensive forces were paying a heavy price when making similar pushes against the North Korean troops.&lt;ref name="Ecker29"&gt;{{harvnb|Ecker|2004|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US infantry forces suffered only five killed and 54 wounded in the 27th Infantry, plus three killed and 16 wounded in the 23rd Infantry. This brought the total American casualty count to 8 dead, 70 wounded.&lt;ref name="Ecker30"&gt;{{harvnb|Ecker|2004|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Korean troops suffered much more heavily during the fight. An estimated 2,300 South Korean men were killed in the fighting; 2,244 enlisted men and 56 officers.&lt;ref name="Paik45"/&gt; However, these losses were not crippling, as volunteers poured in from the surrounding countryside to fight for the South Korean Army.&lt;ref name="Paik46"&gt;{{harvnb|Paik|1992|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Coastal Plain League (CPL)''' is a [[List of collegiate summer baseball leagues|wood-bat collegiate summer league]], featuring [[college baseball|college players]] recruited from throughout the nation. The league takes its name from a [[Coastal Plain League (Class D)|Class D minor league baseball league]] which operated in the area from 1937 to 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/league.cgi?code=COPL&amp;class=D |title=Coastal Plain League (D) Encyclopedia and History |website=[[Baseball-Reference.com]] |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern league was formed with six teams in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailyadvance.com/sports/content/sports/stories/2005/07/18/07182005EDACPL.html |title=CPL not just a Cape Cod imitation |first1=Keith |last1=Parsons |agency=[[Associated Press]] |work=[[The Daily Advance]] |date=July 18, 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060512043530/http://www.dailyadvance.com/sports/content/sports/stories/2005/07/18/07182005EDACPL.html |archivedate=May 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The league has expanded over the years with teams across [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]], [[Virginia]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], with the 2018 addition of the [[Macon Bacon]] being the most recent addition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Coastal Plain League Announces Expansion Into Macon, Georgia For 2018 Season |url=http://www.coastalplain.com/press/coastal_plain_league_announces_expansion_into_macon_georgia_for_2018_season/ |accessdate=July 26, 2017 |date=June 20, 2017 |website=coastalplain.com |publisher=Coastal Plain League |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170625164138/http://www.coastalplain.com/press/coastal_plain_league_announces_expansion_into_macon_georgia_for_2018_season/ |archivedate=June 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Founding===
The league was founded in 1997 by Pete Bock. Bock conceived the idea in the early 1990s while traveling long distances to the [[Valley Baseball League]] in [[Virginia]] to see his son, Jeff, play [[List of collegiate summer baseball leagues|summer baseball]].  Bock, an experienced sports executive, wanted a collegiate summer league closer to his home. He acted on this and the Coastal Plain league began play for the 1997 season.&lt;ref name="hist"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coastalplain.com/index.php/cpl_08/page/today |title=Today’s CPL |website=coastalplain.com |accessdate=November 24, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5lXCxWf94?url=http://www.coastalplain.com/index.php/cpl_08/page/today |archivedate=November 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cowboy polo''' is a variation of [[polo]] played mostly in the [[western United States]]. Like regular polo, it is played in chukkas (periods) with two teams on [[horse]]s who use mallets to hit a ball through a goal. It differs from traditional polo in that five riders make up a team instead of four, [[western saddle]]s and equipment are used, and the playing field is usually a simple rodeo arena or other enclosed dirt area, indoors or out. Also, instead of the small ball used in traditional polo, the players use a large red rubber [[medicine ball]] and use mallets with long fiberglass shafts and hard rubber heads.&lt;ref name=Gazette&gt;[http://www.billingsgazette.com/news/features/magazine/article_0989e786-a56f-11de-b44e-001cc4c002e0.html Healy, Donna. "Hockey on Horseback".  ''Billings Gazette,'' September 20, 2009. Accessed September 20, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Horses==
The [[horse breed]] most often used for cowboy polo is the [[American Quarter Horse]], due to its agility. Unlike regular polo, where multiple horses are used within a single game, riders do not change horses between chukkas, but instead are only allowed two horses, and in some competitions are required to ride one horse throughout.&lt;ref name=Gazette/&gt; This ability to compete with relatively few animals has given the sport its nickname, the "average man's" sport.&lt;ref name=Wallace/&gt;  Horses competing in cowboy polo are often older, experienced animals with steady dispositions who have come to understand the basic purpose of the game and can assist their riders.&lt;ref name=Wallace/&gt;

==History==
Cowboy polo originated in New Smyrna Beach, Florida, in 1952, where it was called ''Palmetto Polo''. The name came from the mallet handles, which were made out of palm. It was renamed "cowboy polo" in 1959.&lt;ref name=Wallace&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091023041050/http://www.distinctlymontana.com/index.aspx/issues/Distinctly_Montana_Fall_2006/rsvp/Cowboy_Polo_Family_Fun_On_Horseback_Montana Wallace, Glenda. "Cowboy Polo: Family Fun on Horseback." ''Distinctly Montana'', Fall 2006. Accessed September 20, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; As it came west, it was connected almost entirely to the membership of [[sheriff's posse]]s, groups primarily dedicated to [[mounted search and rescue]], consisting of deputized law enforcement volunteers. While participation was once limited to men only, women were admitted to the sport in the mid-1990s.&lt;ref name=Gazette/&gt;  It reached its peak of popularity during the 1970s,&lt;ref name=Gazette/&gt; with clubs from Texas to Montana, as well as clubs in Australia.&lt;ref name=Wallace/&gt; However, since then, cowboy polo has been in decline, with the national organization disbanding in 2005. Today, the sport is almost exclusively played in [[Montana]].&lt;ref name=Gazette/&gt; Even in Montana, where there were once 30 clubs, there are now only five.&lt;ref name=Wallace/&gt;

==Rules==
Though the sport has written rules, the most commonly enforced rule is unwritten: any rider who falls off his or her horse must buy [[beer]] for the entire team.&lt;ref name=Gazette/&gt;

Teams consist of five players, with two horseback referees and two goal spotters.   Riders are limited to two horses per game, though most players use one horse throughout. The game is played in four periods of 15 minutes each, called, as in regular polo, "chukkas."  There are mandatory four-minute rest periods at the end of each chukka and a nine-minute break at half time. Each team is allowed four two-minute time outs during the game.&lt;ref name=Laurel&gt;[http://www.laurelsaddleclub.com/PoloClub.html Laurel Saddle Club Cowboy Polo Team. Rules, Equipment and Dress. Accessed September 20, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Teams switch ends at each chukka.&lt;ref name=Wallace/&gt;

The field is divided widthwise into four {{convert|50|ft|m}} sections or zones, and one center zone of {{convert|60|ft|m}}. Each team has one player assigned to each zone with the goal of hitting the ball toward the opponents' goal. If a player crosses into another zone, the team loses control of the ball to the other team. The goal areas are each {{convert|20|ft|m}} and located at each end of the arena.&lt;ref name=Laurel/&gt; The arena is generally {{convert|120|ft|m}} wide.&lt;ref name=Wallace/&gt;

A goal made from the first zone is worth one point. Goals made from the second zone from the goal, without being touched by either player in the first zone is worth two points. An untouched goal from the center zone counts for three points. Balls knocked out of the field are returned to the spot where the ball exited the field and the opposing team takes control of the ball.&lt;ref name=Laurel/&gt;

Unruly or disobedient horses may be asked to leave the field, as will players who endanger other players unnecessarily.   Equipment failure during the game that presents a danger to a player or horse results in a safety time out called by the referee.&lt;ref name=Laurel/&gt;

Safety is of paramount importance. There are 32 rules of play, including 11 types of personal fouls, including “reaching across an opposing player’s horse,” or “riding into and hitting an opposing player’s horse in front or back of the saddle with his/her horse’s front quarters, at greater than a 45-degree angle.”&lt;ref name=Wallace/&gt;

==Equipment==
The ball for cowboy polo is a red rubber [[medicine ball]].   The polo mallet has a maximum length of {{convert|60|in|cm}}. It was traditionally made of cane but can be made of fiberglass. Saddles must be American western saddles or Australian stock saddles. Participants are strongly encouraged to have their horses wear [[polo bandages]] or [[splint boots]]. Use of a [[breast collar]] is optional. There are no specific rules for horse headgear, as long as the equipment is humane. [[Martingale (tack)|Tie-downs]] are allowed, but officials may require the removal of any piece of equipment liable to cause discomfort to the horse.&lt;ref name=Laurel/&gt;

For riders, hats or headgear is required. Most riders now wear some form of [[equestrian helmet]] or other protective headgear, such as a [[cricket helmet]] with a face guard. However, Western or Australian style felt hats may be worn. Extra protective clothing such as knee and shin guards, is optional, though they must not be hard or sharp edged to prevent injury to your opponent or his/her horse.  Riders also must wear [[jeans]], [[riding boots]] and a shirt in the specified club color.&lt;ref name=Laurel/&gt;

==Career==
===2012–2013===
In 2012, Dutee chand became a national champion in the under-18 category, when she clocked 11.8 seconds in the 100 metres event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Dutee Chand breaks 100m record |url= http://www.thehindu.com/sport/athletics/dutee-chand-breaks-100m-record/article3636513.ece |publisher= ''The Hindu'' |date= 14 July 2012 |accessdate= 9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Clocking 23.811 seconds, Chand won the bronze in the [[2013 Asian Athletics Championships – Women's 200 metres|Women's 200 metres]] event at the [[2013 Asian Athletics Championships]] at Pune. The year also saw her become the first Indian to reach the final of a global athletics 100 metres final, when she reached the final in the [[2013 World Youth Championships in Athletics|2013 World Youth Championships]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Dutee Chand is the first Indian sprinter in World 100m final |url= http://www.drinksbreak.com/index.php/other-sports/athletics/252-iaaf-world-youth-championships/1315-dutee-chand-is-the-first-indian-sprinter-in-world-100m-final |publisher= ''drinksbreak'' |accessdate= 9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, she became the national champion in 100 metres and 200 metres when she won the events clocking 11.73 s in the final in 100 metres and a career-best 23.73 s in 200 metres at the National Senior Athletics Championships at [[Ranchi]].

===2014 Hyperandrogenism Controversy===
In June 2014, she won two gold medals at [[2014 Asian Junior Athletics Championships|Asian Junior Athletics Championships]] in 200 metres and 4x400m relays. In the 200 m event she bettered her previous timing to 23.74 secs and hoping to get qualified for the Commonwealth Games but Chand was dropped from the [[2014 Commonwealth Games]] contingent at the last minute after the Athletic Federation of India  stated that [[hyperandrogenism]] made her ineligible to compete as a female athlete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/athletics/29446276|title=Sport &amp; gender: A history of bad science &amp; 'biological racism'|first=Matt|last=Slater|publisher=BBC Sport|date=28 July 2015|accessdate=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/athletics/43890575 |title=Caster Semenya expected to be affected by IAAF rule changes |work=BBC Sport| accessdate=26 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Commonwealth Games she was also dropped from Indian contingent for [[2014 Asian Games]]. There has been no suggestion that Chand has been involved in cheating or doping—the decision was made in compliance with International Olympic Committee (IOC) regulations on “female hyperandrogenism” designed to address a perceived advantage for female athletes with high androgen levels. The decision has been condemned by Australian [[intersex]] advocates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starobserver.com.au/news/local-news/commonwealth-games-sprinters-disqualification-shows-australian-athletes-could-face-gender-testing/126004|title=Commonwealth Games sprinter’s disqualification shows Australian athletes could face "gender testing"|work=starobserver.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Athletic Federation of India and IAAF’s actions were widely criticised as an affront to Chand’s privacy and human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://iwg--gti-org.directo.fi/catalyst/august-2014/gender-struggles-for-women-to-fi/#Gender%20struggles%20for%20women%20to%20find%20equality%20in%20sport|title=Gender struggles for women to find equality in sport|work=directo.fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dutee Chand was raised in India and at an early age, started to compete in running events. She excelled at most of the competitions she was entered in, and by the time she was eighteen she was already competing professionally. [18] Chand was about to compete in the Common Wealth Games in Glasgow. However before she was able to compete in these games, Chand had to go through a series of medical test to be cleared for the games. Not thinking much of it, she went along just to get it over with so she could be ready to compete. When Chand arrived at the facilities, a doctor was the one conducting all of the tests rather than a nurse. Chand did not find this unusual, but what she did find puzzling was the fact that because a nurse was not present, the male doctor would order an ultrasound instead of the routine urine and blood samples that the nurse would normally take care of. [19] Three days later, after Chands appointment, the clinic in which the ultrasound was taken sent a letter out to the Indian Government Sports Authority saying “It has been brought to the notice of the undersigned that there are definite doubts regarding the gender of an Athlete Ms. Dutee Chand.” [20] The letter requested that Chand have a proper gender verification test because of her abnormal testosterone levels. 
A couple days later Chand was sent to a private hospital located in Bangalore where her blood was drawn to test her natural levels of testosterone (even though Chand was unaware of what was being tested). She also was forced to under go a chromosome analysis, an M.R.I. and a gynecological exam in which Chand was quoted as saying her experience with it was “horrifying.” Chand also had to undergo different tests that involved palpating and measuring of the clitoris, as well as measuring breast size and pubic hairs all to be compared on a certain scale. [21] All of these tests where deemed necessary to come to a proper conclusion to see if Dutee Chand is in fact a woman under the standards of the I.A.A.F. (International Association of Athletics Federations). A few days later, the doctor said in his statement that her “male hormone levels” were too high for the standards of what it means to be female according to I.A.A.F. Since Chand’s levels were above the threshold of the “normal” female, she could no longer compete. Since then, Chand has been a part of legal battle not only with her disqualification but also with the international policy’s that discriminates against athletes who do not develop the same way in which other athletes do. [22]

===2015 testosterone rule change ===
Chand appealed to the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport|Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS)]].  The Canadian law firm Davies, Ward, Philips &amp; Vineberg, LLP represented her on a ''pro bono'' basis. The IAAF policy on [[hyperandrogenism]], or high natural levels of [[testosterone]] in women, was suspended following the case of ''Dutee Chand v. Athletics Federation of India (AFI) &amp; The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF)'', in the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]], decided in July 2015.&lt;ref name="cas2015"&gt;{{Cite conference| publisher = [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]]| last = Court of Arbitration for Sport| title = CAS 2014/A/3759 Dutee Chand v.

[[Santhi Soundarajan]], acclaimed [[middle-distance running]] athlete for India, extended her support to Chand and said the youngster should not be victimized. She expressed her dismay at the lack of sensitivity in the handling of the issue, fearing that Chand's future may have been jeopardized, and demanded that all steps be taken to ensure Chand's return to the track.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/sport/Santhi-Urges-Establishment-to-Help-Sidelined-Dutee/2014/07/19/article2335981.ece|title=Santhi Urges Establishment to Help Sidelined Dutee|work=The New Indian Express|accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2016===
As soon as the hyperandrogenism rule changed, she started took part in track competitions, did participated at the [[2016 Asian Indoor Athletics Championships]] in [[60 metres]] where in the qualification round she made Indian national record to her name clocking 7.28 secs and went on to win the bronze medal in the final, clocking 7.37 secs.

Dutee clocked 11.33 secs in women’s 100m dash to win the gold and erase [[Rachita Mistry]]’s 16-year-old earlier national record of 11.38 secs in the 2016 Federation Cup National Athletics Championships in New Delhi, however she missed the Rio Olympics qualification norm of 11.32 secs by one-hundredth of a second.&lt;ref name="100 m" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=National Open Athletics: Golden double for Dutee, Surya|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-09-11/athletics/41969409_1_national-open-athletics-championships-services-men-services-team|accessdate=19 September 2013|newspaper=Times of India|date=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; But finally on 25 June 2016, Dutee broke the very same National record twice in one day after clocking 11.24 at the XXVI International Meeting G Kosanov Memorial at [[Almaty]], Kazakhstan, thereby qualifying for the Olympic Games.
''“I am really happy at the moment, it has been a tough year for me and I am so happy that my coach ... and my hard work has paid off. I would like to thank all the people in India who were praying for me to qualify. Your wishes have paid off.”'', she exclaimed.&lt;ref name="reuters1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Indian sprinter Dutee Chand defies the odds to make Rio 100m|url=https://in.reuters.com/article/olympics-rio-athletics-india/indian-sprinter-dutee-chand-defies-the-odds-to-make-rio-100m-idINKCN0ZB0BP|accessdate=26 August 2018|work=Reuters|date=25 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Rio 2016]] Olympics, she became the third Indian woman to participate for the [[Athletics at the 2016 Summer Olympics – Women's 100 metres|Women's 100 metres]], though she did not moved beyond the heats, where she clocked 11.69 seconds.

Since Rio, Chand has been training at Hyderabad with young athletes, most notable among them Indian Badminton Star [[P. V. Sindhu]]. The sprinter is glad to have the new training base and P. V. Sindhu as a companion. Despite being the first woman to represent India in the Olympics sprint event in 36 years, Dutee was made to feel isolated due to her condition of hyperandrogenism. After shifting her base she said, “It’s like a home away from home. There are lots of friends to gossip with”.

In 2017, at [[2017 Asian Athletics Championships|Asian Athletics Championships]] she clinched two bronze medals, one in the [[2017 Asian Athletics Championships – Women's 100 metres|Women's 100 metres]], another in the [[2017 Asian Athletics Championships – Women's 4 × 100 metres relay|Women's 4×100 m relay]] with [[Srabani Nanda]], [[Merlin K Joseph]] and [[Himashree Roy]] at Bhubaneswar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orissapost.com/dutee-srabani-sprint-to-relay-bronze/|title=Dutee, Srabani sprint to relay bronze {{!}} Orissa Post|website=www.orissapost.com|language=en-US|access-date=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[2018 Asian Games]], in the [[Athletics at the 2018 Asian Games – Women's 100 metres|Women's 100 metres]] finals Dutee won the  Silver medal, her first Asian games medal, clocking 11.32 sec on 26 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/other-asian-games-2018-india-s-dutee-chand-wins-silver-in-womens-100m-final-event-459892|title=Asian Games 2018: India's Dutee Chand wins silver in Women's 100m Final event|language=en-US|access-date=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Again on 29 August, she bagged her second silver at the Asian games in the [[Athletics at the 2018 Asian Games – Women's 200 metres|Women's 200 metres]] final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/asian-games/asian-games-dutee-chand-bags-second-medal-wins-200m-silver/articleshow/65594818.cms|title=Asian Games: Dutee Chand bags second medal, wins 200m silver|language=en-US|access-date=29 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her silver in 100 m, was India's silver medal in this category after 32 years since [[P.T.Usha]] won in [[1986 Asian Games|1986]] and Chand's first medal in Asian games as she was banned in 2014 and her 200 m silver is after 16 years for India since [[Saraswati Saha]]'s gold in [[2002 Asian Games|2002]] at Busan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sportskeeda.com/athletics/asian-games-2018-dutee-chand-wins-silver-womens-200m-her-second-medal-from-asiad|title=Asian Games 2018: Dutee Chand wins silver in women's 200m, her second medal from the Asiad|language=en-US|access-date=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As she won these two silvers after long court battle, it was indeed special for her but she expressed her concern about her future saying, ''"My legal team helped me to come back, But nobody could guarantee what will happen in the future."'' Citing [[Caster Semenya]] ongoing fight, she said, ''"Caster Semenya is still fighting.

==Support to Caster Semenya==
[[Caster Semenya]] is the present [[Athletics at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Women's 800 metres|Olympics Champion]] and [[2017 World Championships in Athletics – Women's 800 metres|World Champion]] in Women's 800 metres. She is also affected by the [[Hyperandrogenism]] rule of [[IAAF]] like that of Dutee but faced different fate. In April 2018, the [[International Association of Athletics Federations|IAAF]] announced new rules that required [[hyperandrogenism|hyperandrogenous]] athletes to take medication to lower their testosterone levels, effective beginning in November 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/athletics/2018/04/25/caster-semenya-forced-lower-testosterone-levels-face-800m-ban/ Caster Semenya to be forced to lower testosterone levels or face 800m ban].

At an interview to ''The Indian Express'', Chand expressed her pain and struggle of four years, when she was controversially not allowed to compete in any international events due to hyperandrogenism. "These four years have been extremely tough for me. The negativity, fear of my career ending prematurely, insensitive comments about my body, I have faced them all. I am extremely relieved that I can run fearlessly again, knowing that now my battle exists only on the track and not off it," Dutee told The Indian Express. She said, she was concerned about her “friend” Semenya that she wrote a mail to the multiple Olympic and World Championship winner, offering the South African to take legal help from her own team.&lt;ref&gt;[https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/sport-others/i-have-offered-caster-semenya-my-legal-team-dutee-chand-5153337/ I have offered Caster Semenya my legal team: Dutee Chand].

'''Edward A. LeLacheur Park''' is a [[baseball park]] located on the banks of the [[Merrimack River]] in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]].  It is home to the [[New York–Penn League]] [[Lowell Spinners]], the [[minor league baseball|Class A]] Short Season Affiliate of the [[Boston Red Sox]].  LeLacheur Park is also home to the [[UMass Lowell River Hawks baseball]] team, which currently competes in the [[America East]] Conference at the [[NCAA Division I]] level as of the start of the [[2014 NCAA Division I baseball season|2014 season]].

==History==
The park was built between a partnership with the city of Lowell and the [[University of Massachusetts Lowell]]. The park was named for State Representative [[Edward A. LeLacheur]], who led the initial redevelopment of Lowell, and opened in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Collins|first1=John|title='There will never be another Ed LeLacheur'|url=http://www.lowellsun.com/rss/ci_15740893|accessdate=April 29, 2016|work=Lowell Sun|date=August 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Girard|first1=Christopher J.|title=Edward A. LeLacheur, 85, longtime state legislator who quietly served others|url=http://archive.boston.com/bostonglobe/obituaries/articles/2010/08/08/edward_a_lelacheur_85_longtime_state_legislator_who_quietly_served_others/|accessdate=April 29, 2016|work=Boston.com|date=August 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The park was built adjacent to the residential section of UML. [[Populous (company)|Populous]] (formerly HOK Sport)  designed the park. It offers views of the Aiken Street Bridge, Lawrence Mills, Fox Hall, and University Suites. The seating bowl is raised above the field. A concourse surrounds the top of the park where the refreshment, merchandise stands, and bathrooms are located. The design enables an open view while waiting in line.

Two seating expansions have been considered since the park opened. One plan would have added 600-1,000 seats on the third base side. The expansion would match how the first base side is angled towards the infield. The other proposal was to add a smaller version of the [[Green Monster]] with seating for approximately 200 people. This would also would have shortened the field and raised the wall to {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on}}. Due to lack of funds, neither have been built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lowell Spinners Pitching a Monster of an Idea for LeLacheur|first=Jennifer|last=Myers|url=http://www.lowellsun.com/ci_13176051|newspaper=[[The Sun (Lowell)|Lowell Sun]]|date=August 21, 2009|accessdate=June 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium also features the Giant Hood Milk Jug from [[Fenway Park]] and all Red Sox [[squad number#Retired numbers|retired numbers]].

The ballpark held its first concert on July 10, 2008 when Boston-based Celtic punk band [[Dropkick Murphys]] played there with [[The Mighty Mighty Bosstones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A Rockin' Grand Slam at Lowell's LeLacheur Park|first=Rachel R.|last=Briere|url=http://www.lowellsun.com/ci_9849261|newspaper=[[The Sun (Lowell)|Lowell Sun]]|date=July 11, 2008|accessdate=June 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Gil Thorp''''' is a sports-oriented [[comic strip]] which has been published since September 8, 1958. The main character, Gil Thorp, is the athletic director of Milford High School and coaches the [[American football|football]], basketball, and baseball teams. In addition to the sports storylines, the strip also deals with issues facing teenagers such as teen pregnancy, [[anabolic steroid|steroids]], and drug abuse.

==History==
The strip was created by Jack Berrill, who modeled and named Thorp after baseball player [[Gil Hodges]] and Olympic athlete [[Jim Thorpe]]. Berrill continued the strip until he died of cancer on March 14, 1996. Over the course of his 38 years, Berrill broke ground with many of his stories, often dealing with sensitive social issues of the day. As editorial standards relaxed, he was able to move from stories about jalopies and after-school jobs to topics like teen pregnancy, divorce, and steroids.&lt;ref name="ct080907"/&gt;

===Writers===
Upon Berrill's death, Tribune Media Services chose author [[Jerry Jenkins]] (co-author of the ''[[Left Behind (series)|Left Behind]]'' novels) to take over writing the strip.&lt;ref name="cr980205"/&gt; Jenkins had been in discussions with TMS about expanding previous ''Gil Thorp'' stories into a series of youth novels and was a logical replacement. Many of Jenkins' stories were written uncredited by his son Chad Jenkins, a baseball coach at [[Bethel College (Indiana)|Bethel College]]. The Jenkins stories discussed overtly religious topics which had not appeared in the strip before, including an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] football player&lt;ref name="jwr010821"/&gt; and a 15-year-old pregnant girl whom Thorp talks out of getting an abortion.&lt;ref name="cr030417"/&gt;

In 2004, Jenkins was followed as writer by ''[[Detroit News]]'' columnist [[Neal Rubin]].&lt;ref name="sr040417"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ct080907"/&gt;

===Artists===
The strip was drawn by Berrill from 1958–1993 until [[glaucoma]] forced him to turn the reins over to his Connecticut Cartoonist Associate colleague [[Warren Sattler]]. Later [[Frank Bolle]] took over. Later Ray Burns took over. [[Frank McLaughlin (artist)|Frank McLaughlin]] took over following Burns' death in 2000. On February 18, 2008, ''[[Apartment 3G]]'' artist Frank Bolle again took over art chores for ''Gil Thorp'' on an interim basis. Rod Whigham became the permanent artist two months later.&lt;ref name="ct080303"/&gt;

==The Bucket==
The Bucket was an online forum hosted by the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', named after the teen burger hangout in the strip, The Bucket. It was a lively site for 15 years and featured discussions about the strip and other topics. Members of the community were known as "Bucketeers".{{cn|date=June 2013}}

In the sport of [[Australian rules football]], the '''half-back line''' refers to the positions of the 3 players on the field that occupy the centre half-back and left and right half-back flank positions.

{{Afl-field}}

==Centre half-back==
The role of the centre half-back is similar to that of a defensive midfielder in association football. As the first line of defence, the centre half-back must aim to break down opposition attacks before they can get into a scoring position.&lt;ref name="Pascoe, 1995, p. 28"&gt;Pascoe, 1995, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Given that a centre half-back's opponent is usually the centre half-forward, the role is regarded as a ''key position'' in the team, and is usually reserved for tall and well-built players.

As one of the team's leaders, centre half-backs must be able to read the play and have good communication skills.&lt;ref name=northey&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swoopercoach.com.au/2010/playing-position-full-back/|title=Playing Position Centre Half Back|date=24 March 2010|first=John|last=Northey|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121231005321/http://www.swoopercoach.com.au/2010/playing-position-full-back/|archivedate=31 December 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although their first responsibility is to defend,&lt;ref name=northey/&gt; the great centre half-backs have proven to be equally creative in attack as well as reliable in defence.

Notable centre half-backs from over the years include:
* [[Albert Chadwick]] ({{AFL Mel}} and {{AFL Haw}}, 1920–1929)&lt;ref name="Pascoe, 1995, p. 28"/&gt;

* [[Albert Collier|Albert "Leeter" Collier]] ({{AFL Col}} and {{AFL Fit}}, 1925–1941),&lt;ref name="Pascoe, 1995, p. 29"&gt;Pascoe, 1995, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Brownlow Medallist 1929

* [[Ross Glendinning]] ({{AFL NM}} and {{AFL WC}}, 1978–1988),&lt;ref name="Pascoe, 1995, p. 29"/&gt; Brownlow medallist 1983

* [[Glen Jakovich]] (West Coast, 1991–2004)&lt;ref name="Pascoe, 1995, p. 29"/&gt;

==Half-back flank==
The half-back flank was traditionally a defensive position, where reliability and toughness were more important than attacking flair.&lt;ref name="Pascoe, 1995, p. 28"/&gt; In the modern game, reliability and toughness must now be combined with the ability to run and carry the ball as well as take on the opposition in a counter-attacking style.&lt;ref name=coach&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.aflcommunityclub.com.au/fileadmin/user_upload/Coach_AFL/coaching_manual/2012_Youth_Coaching_Manual.pdf|title=AFL Youth Coaching Manual|page=92|chapter=Team Play and Game Plans: Position descriptions|year=2012|publisher=[[Australian Football League]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2579">'''Kyle Baseball Field''' was a baseball venue located in [[College Station, TX]] and was approximate to the football stadium, [[Kyle Field]]. The ballpark was installed at the same time as the football stadium in 1904; [[Texas A&amp;M University|Texas A&amp;M]] were one of the original members of the [[Southwest Conference]] in 1914 but did not begin baseball until 1915.

==Field conditions==
As compared to the more modern [[Olsen Field]], Kyle Baseball Field gave birth to rocks because it was constructed on an ancient parking lot, and the rocks came up through the surface. Each day preceding practice, the team had to line up across the field and went from one end to the other, removing the rocks so the infielders wouldn't get injured in the face from bad hops.

==Field contraction==
The ballpark had a grandstand finished in June 1923 which cost $7,500 at the time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brazosgenealogy.org/data/time6.htm&lt;/ref&gt; With [[Kyle Field#Facility improvements|expansion]] to Kyle Field in 1929, 1954, and 1969, the baseball field, in contrast, kept shrinking. Due to the small capacity of the baseball field, the Aggies had to play the 1959 District 6 playoffs with the [[University of Arizona]] at [[Travis Field (Bryan, TX)|Travis Field]] in nearby [[Bryan, TX]]; the [[Texas A&amp;M Aggies baseball|Aggies]] lost the two games in the double-elimination by identical 1-0 in front of 6,000. From 1972 to 1975, Texas A&amp;M had to make Travis Field their home away from "home" because the school representatives took Kyle Baseball Field from the baseball team during another series of augmentation of Kyle Field. The Texas A&amp;M Aggies played their last seasons at Kyle Baseball Field in 1976 and 1977. With the opening of [[UFCU Disch-Falk Field]] in [[Austin]] in 1975, the Aggies knew they had to construct a new facility in order to compete with their in-state rivals which led to [[Olsen Field]] in 1978.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

==Legacy==
The Aggies won [[Southwest Conference]] titles in 1931, 1934, 1942, 1951 (co-champions with UT-Austin), 1955, 1959, and 1977 while calling Kyle Baseball Field their home.

This is a list of individuals, groups of individuals, and companies who have owned and operated a professional sports organization. The list is organized first by sport, then by franchise or team, then by Owner. If an organization has gone through a significant change (e.g. the team has moved and/or changed names), that information is noted after the years of ownership.

=== Nippon Professional Baseball owners ===

Only one team in recent years has not borne a corporate name—the Yokohama BayStars went without a corporate name from 1993 through 2011 because its owner chose not to attach its name to the team. The company identifier is indicated in '''bold''' type in the owner list.

** From 1988 to 2018 Allen was the principal owner of the NFL's [[Seattle Seahawks]]. At the time he purchased the Seahawks in 1997, the NFL had a blanket prohibition of cross-ownership (apart from soccer), but the league soon modified the rule to allow NFL owners to own teams in other leagues under either of the following conditions:
*** The other team is in the same market as the owner's NFL team.
*** The other team is in a market without an NFL team, as is the case with Portland.

[[File:Lords Long Room.jpg|right|300px|thumb|The Long Room in the Lords pavilion]]
'''The Long Room''' is a notable, historic room at [[Lord's cricket ground]], in [[St John's Wood]], [[London]].

Described by [[Lawrence Booth (cricket writer)|Lawrence Booth]] as "the most evocative four walls in world cricket",&lt;ref name="Booth"&gt;Arm-Ball to Zooter, Lawrence Booth, Penguin 2006, {{ISBN|0-14-051581-X}}, p.150-1&lt;/ref&gt; the Long Room is situated in the [[Lord's Pavilion|Pavilion]].

==Function==

Players walk through the Long Room on their way from the dressing rooms to the [[cricket field]]; this walk is notoriously long and complex at Lord's. On his Test debut in 1975, [[David Steele (cricketer)|David Steele]] got lost "and ended up in the pavilion's basement toilets".&lt;ref name="Booth"/&gt;

Members of [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]] and their guests have free access to the room (there are windows with views of the ground) and will often greet [[Australia national cricket team|Australian]] [[batsman|batsmen]] with "witticisms ... like 'See you soon'".&lt;ref name="Booth"/&gt; On this point, Australian [[Justin Langer]],&lt;ref&gt;Langer also played at Lord's on many occasions as a (home) [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex player]]&lt;/ref&gt; described walking through the Long Room like "being bearhugged by an invisible spirit".&lt;ref name="Booth"/&gt;

As a result of the [[Pakistan cricket spot-fixing scandal]], news of which broke on the last morning of the [[Pakistani cricket team in England in 2010#Fourth Test|2010 Lord's Test match]], the presentation ceremony at the end of the match (and series) was held in the Long Room, rather than on the pitch.

The Long Room has recently been made available on a private hire basis for events such as weddings and conferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

 |title=United Kingdom: The Long Room : Events Hire
 |accessdate=17 Feb 2014
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decor==

The Long Room is lined with paintings of famous cricketers and administrators, from the 18th century to the 21st. For contemporary or overseas players to have their portrait placed here is a considerable honour and very few have been awarded this distinction. For example, only four Australian cricketers have ever been honoured in this way: Sir [[Don Bradman|Donald Bradman]], [[Keith Miller]], [[Victor Trumper]] and [[Shane Warne]],&lt;ref&gt;The following sources are, respectively, a Miller obituary from 2004, which lists Trumper and Bradman and a further piece from 2005, when Warne's portrait was added. [[Michael Atherton]], the author of the second piece, curiously overlooks Trumper's portrait; other articles of the same period do similarly.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Selvey"&gt;{{cite news

Only Warne, born in 1969 with a Test career from 1992–2007, has played more recently.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events hosted==

===2010 World Lacrosse Championships===
[[Manchester]] hosted the world's biggest lacrosse event in July 2010.  It was the third edition of the [[World Lacrosse Championships]] held in [[England]], with Manchester hosting the [[1994 World Lacrosse Championship|1994 tournament]] and [[Stockport]] hosting in [[1978 World Lacrosse Championship|1978]].  The event took place at the [[University of Manchester]], on the same campus used for the athletes' village at the [[2002 Commonwealth Games]].

===2010 Women's Rugby World Cup===
The International Rugby Board, now known as [[World Rugby]], which governs [[rugby union]], announced in September 2008 that the [[2010 Women's Rugby World Cup]] would be held in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.irb.com/newsmedia/mediazone/pressrelease/newsid=2026944.html |title=England to host Women's RWC 2010 |publisher=International Rugby Board |date=2008-09-28 |accessdate=2009-07-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090819002932/http://www.irb.com/newsmedia/mediazone/pressrelease/newsid%3D2026944.html |archivedate=2009-08-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The event was held in late August and early September. All matches took place at the [[Surrey Sports Park]] in [[Guildford]], except for the semi-finals, third-place match, and final, which were held at the [[The Stoop|Twickenham Stoop]].

===2010 Ryder Cup===
The [[2010 Ryder Cup]] was held at the Celtic Manor Resort Hotel in [[Newport, Wales|Newport]], [[South Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/golf/1569128.stm|title=Welsh bid chiefs delighted |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2001-09-28 |accessdate=2008-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally scheduled for 1–3 October, it was extended to 4 October due to delays caused by heavy rains.

===2011 European Rugby Challenge Cup and European Rugby Champions Cup===
[[Millennium Stadium]] hosted the [[2011 Heineken Cup Final]] on 21 May. This was the fourth time that the [[Cardiff]] venue, the home of [[Wales national rugby union team|Welsh rugby union]], hosted this event. The day before, the city also hosted the [[2010–11 European Challenge Cup#Final|final]] of the second-tier [[European Challenge Cup|Amlin Challenge Cup]] at [[Cardiff City Stadium]].

===2011 Women's Champions League and Champions League Finals===
[[Wembley Stadium]] hosted the [[2011 UEFA Champions League Final]] on 28 May. This was the first time the current Wembley had hosted the event; the [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|original Wembley Stadium]] had hosted the final five times. Including two finals at [[Hampden Park]] in [[Glasgow]] and one at [[Old Trafford]] in [[Manchester]], this was the ninth time that Britain had hosted the European Cup/Champions League final.

As a part of its successful bid, London was also awarded the [[2011 UEFA Women's Champions League Final]], which was held on 26 May at [[Craven Cottage]]. It was the first time Britain had hosted the final of the women's event.

===2011 International Children's Games===
[[Image:Dollan Baths, East Kilbride 1.jpg|thumb|Dollan Baths]]
The [[International Children's Games]] is the world's largest international multi-sport youth event, with nearly 2,000 athletes, coaches and officials from over 70 countries taking part.  The event is informally referred to as the 'Mini-Olympics'. [[Lanarkshire]] won the unanimous backing of the ICG Committee for hosting rights to the 2011 Games, beating strong competition from [[Singapore]] and [[Daegu]]. Scotland's First Minister [[Alex Salmond]] spoke to the Committee in a video message, pointing out that the awarding of the 2011 Games to Lanarkshire would be a major boost to the local area and informing them that the entire nation was supporting the bid. One of the prime venues was [[Strathclyde Country Park]], which is also an official [[2014 Commonwealth Games]] venue. Other venues included the new £29m sports facility at [[Ravenscraig]], the [[Historic Scotland]] Category A listed [[Dollan Baths]] and the Airdrie Lesiure Centre.

===2012 Amlin Challenge Cup and Heineken Cup Finals===
[[Twickenham Stadium|Twickenham]], home to both the [[England national rugby union team]] and England's [[Rugby Football Union|national governing body]] for the sport, hosted the [[2012 Heineken Cup Final]] on 19 May. As with Millennium Stadium the year before, this was the fourth final for Twickenham. The adjacent [[Twickenham Stoop]] hosted the [[2011–12 European Challenge Cup#Final|Amlin Challenge Cup final]] on the day before the Heineken Cup Final; this was the fourth Challenge Cup final at The Stoop.

===2012 Summer Olympics===
{{Main|2012 Summer Olympics}}
After [[Birmingham]] and [[Manchester]] failed to deliver winning bids for the [[1992 Summer Olympics|1992]], [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996]] and [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Olympic Games]], the [[British Olympic Association]] (BOA) decided that London was the best choice to pursue the goal of hosting the Summer Olympics.&lt;ref name="BBC London"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/olympics_2012/4233055.stm |title=Rivals for 2012: London |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |date=2005-06-08 |accessdate=2007-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The centrepiece of the London bid was the [[Lower Lea Valley]], the location designated to be transformed into a world-class [[Olympic Park, London|Olympic Park]] and [[Olympic Village]]. It would be connected via a high-speed [[Public transport|shuttle]] service, dubbed the [[Olympic Javelin]], and existing transport links capable of transferring 240,000 people per hour.&lt;ref name="Train"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alwaystouchout.com/project/44 |title=Stratford Olympic Park |date=2006-01-25 |accessdate=2007-03-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320223510/http://www.alwaystouchout.com/project/44 |archivedate=2007-03-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Olympics and Paralympics close, the area will be transformed into the largest urban park developed in Europe for more than 150 years, with an area of 500 [[acre]]s (2&amp;nbsp;km²),&lt;ref name="OlympicParkLegacy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.london2012.org/en/ourvision/regeneration/a+new+park.htm |title=A lasting legacy – A new park |work=Our vision |publisher=[[London 2012]] |accessdate=2007-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and will be home to the Olympic Medical Institute (OMI), a sports medical and rehabilitation centre.&lt;ref name="OMI"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.olympics.org.uk/OMI/home.aspx |title=Olympic Medical Institute |accessdate=2007-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bid called for substantial improvement of the [[London Underground]] system, which was supposed to be able to handle the Olympic crowds, and more investment into new Olympic sites throughout the city. London was considered to be the second favourite for the election after Paris, but intense lobbying by the London bid team at the later stages of the bidding process swung the votes in their favour.

On 7 July 2005, the victory celebrations were marred by the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|terrorist attacks]] on London's public transport system. This prompted immediate fears concerning the security of the 2012 Games, to which the IOC and British officials reacted in a reassuring way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.gamesbids.com/cgi-bin/news/viewnews.cgi?category=1&amp;id=1120759363 |title=London Terrorist Attack Won’t Affect Host City Status Says IOC – Celebration Cancelled |publisher=GamesBids |date=2005-07-07 |accessdate=2007-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.gamesbids.com/cgi-bin/news/viewnews.cgi?category=1&amp;id=1120936727 |title=London Will Stage Safe And Secure Games Says Sports Minister |publisher=GamesBids |date=2005-07-09 |accessdate=2007-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2012 Summer Paralympics===

London won hosting rights to the 2012 Summer Paralympics as part of its successful bid to host the Summer Olympics. The event used many of the Olympic venues.

===2013 Euroleague Final Four===
{{main|2012–13 Euroleague Final Four}}
[[Euroleague Basketball Company|Euroleague Basketball]] announced on 12 May 2012 that The O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; arena would host [[Euroleague Basketball|the league's]] [[Euroleague Final Four|Final Four]] on 10 and 12 May 2013.&lt;ref name="Euroleague Final Four"&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.euroleague.net/final-four/istanbul-2012/main-page/i/97437/7005 |title=The O2 in London to host the 2013 Turkish Airlines Euroleague Final Four |publisher=Euroleague Basketball |date=12 May 2012 |accessdate=14 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contract between Euroleague Basketball and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; arena operator [[AEG Live|AEG]] included a mutual option for the venue to host the 2014 Final Four,&lt;ref name="Euroleague Final Four"/&gt; but one or both parties decided not to exercise that option, and the 2014 Final Four was instead awarded to [[Milan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.euroleague.net/news/i/114714/180 |title=Milan, Italy to host 2014 Turkish Airlines Euroleague Final Four |publisher=Euroleague Basketball |date=4 July 2012 |accessdate=18 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2013 Women's Champions League and Champions League Finals===
{{main|2013 UEFA Champions League Final|2013 UEFA Women's Champions League Final}}
The hosting of the 2011 Champions League Final at the 90,000 Wembley Stadium was deemed such a success, UEFA announced on 16 June 2011 Wembley would host the 2013 final – the first time a stadium has hosted the European Cup final twice in three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Champions League final to return to Wembley Stadium in 2013 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/dcunited/champions-league-final-to-return-to-wembley-stadium-in-2013/2011/06/16/AGYZDRXH_story.html |work=The Washington Post |date=16 June 2011 |accessdate=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2013 final would coincide with the 150th anniversary of [[The Football Association]] – the world's oldest football governing body.

As a part of its successful bid, London was also awarded the 2013 Women's Champions League Final. As in 2011, that match was held two days before the (men's) Champions League Final. This time, [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] hosted the women's final.

===2013 ICC Champions Trophy===
{{Main|2013 ICC Champions Trophy}}
Three cities in the United Kingdom, [[London]], [[Cardiff]] and [[Birmingham]], hosted the seventh [[ICC Champions Trophy]], which was intended to be the final edition of that event. The eight major [[Test cricket#Test status|test nations]] competed in the limited overs tournament, with [[India national cricket team|India]] winning.

===2013 Rugby League World Cup===
{{Main|2013 Rugby League World Cup}}
Following the success of the [[2008 Rugby League World Cup|2008 World Cup]], the [[RLIF]] officially announced the next tournament to be held in 2013. The UK was favourites to host the sport's most prestigious event, but faced stiff competition from Australia, who had successfully hosted the 2008 competition – the most watched in [[rugby league]]'s history. On 28 July 2009 the RLIF held a meeting in Singapore and, ending months of speculation, announced that the UK would host the 2013 Rugby League World Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyleague/5925940/United-Kingdom-win-the-race-to-host-2013-Rugby-League-World-Cup.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=United Kingdom win the race to host 2013 Rugby League World Cup | first=Michael | last=Fisher | date=2009-07-28 | accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2014 Amlin Challenge Cup and Heineken Cup Finals===
Initially, the 2014 finals of the [[2013–14 Heineken Cup|Heineken Cup]] and [[2013–14 European Challenge Cup#Final|Amlin Challenge Cup]] were scheduled to be held in the [[Paris]] area in [[France]]. However, the [[French Rugby Federation]] pulled out of hosting because of uncertainty over the availability of [[Stade de France]] for the Heineken Cup Final. As a result, the organiser of both competitions, [[European Rugby Cup]], reopened the bidding for both finals (which were awarded in a single package). Bids were received from all three of the Home Nations on the island of Great Britain—[[Rugby Football Union|England]], [[Scottish Rugby Football Union|Scotland]] and [[Welsh Rugby Union|Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.ercrugby.com/eng/news/21299.php |title=Three bids for ERC European Club Rugby Finals |publisher=European Rugby Cup |date=20 June 2013 |accessdate=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, the finals were awarded to [[Cardiff]], which had most recently hosted the finals in [[#2011 Amlin Challenge Cup and Heineken Cup Finals|2011]]. This was the fifth Heineken Cup Final at Millennium Stadium, and the seventh for the city (two other finals had been held at the [[Cardiff Arms Park#National Stadium|National Stadium]] that previously occupied the Millennium Stadium site).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/rugby-union/23326691 |title=Cardiff to host Heineken Cup final for a record seventh time |publisher=BBC Sport |date=17 July 2013 |accessdate=18 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike 2011, when the Challenge Cup Final was played at [[Cardiff City Stadium]], the second-tier final was held at [[Cardiff Arms Park]], directly adjacent to Millennium Stadium. This match was the first European final ever played on an artificial surface, as the Arms Park's main tenant, the [[Cardiff Blues]] of [[Pro14|Pro12]], installed a modern artificial pitch for the 2013–14 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/heineken-cup-2012-13/rugby/story/190895.html |title=Millennium Stadium handed Heineken Cup finale |publisher=''ESPN Scrum'' |date=17 July 2013 |accessdate=18 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These were the last-ever finals of the Heineken Cup and Amlin Challenge Cup. From 2014–15, these competitions were replaced respectively by the [[European Rugby Champions Cup]] and [[European Rugby Challenge Cup]].

===2014 Tour de France Grand Depart===
The first three stages of the [[2014 Tour de France]] took place in Yorkshire, Cambridgeshire, Essex and London.

===2014 Commonwealth Games===
{{main|2014 Commonwealth Games}}
Scotland was the first country to consider hosting the 2014 Commonwealth Games in 2004, with Scottish cities being invited by the [[Commonwealth Games Council for Scotland]] to consider making a bid. In September 2004, Glasgow was announced as the Scottish candidate city over [[Edinburgh]] (which hosted the Games in [[1970 British Commonwealth Games|1970]] and [[1986 Commonwealth Games|1986]], and the inaugural [[Commonwealth Youth Games]] in [[2000 Commonwealth Youth Games|2000]]) following a [[cost-benefit analysis]] by the Commonwealth Games Council for Scotland. The [[Scottish Executive]] under then [[First Minister of Scotland]], [[Jack McConnell]], with the support of the [[Her Majesty's Government|United Kingdom government]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4846034.stm Blair enjoys Games as tour begins]&lt;/ref&gt; and all main parties in the [[Scottish Parliament]], formally announced Glasgow's intention to host the games on 16 August 2005.

In March 2006, the bidding process began, with the Glasgow Bid team presenting their case to the Commonwealth Games Federation at the [[2006 Commonwealth Games]] in [[Melbourne]], along with the other confirmed candidate cities; the [[Nigeria]]n capital, [[Abuja]] and [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]] in [[Canada]]; Halifax later withdrew due to 'unacceptably high cost projections'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4154634.stm BBC News – Glasgow launches Commonwealth bid]&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2006, the first voting delegates arrived in Glasgow, in order to inspect the city's existing and proposed amenities and facilities. Glasgow announced on 16 January 2007, the 17 sports to be included should its bid be successful.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/scotland/6267309.stm BBC Sport – Glasgow reveals 2014 bid sports ]&lt;/ref&gt; Halifax later withdrew its bid on 8 March 2007, following the withdrawal of funding from the municipal government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/6431603.stm BBC News – Commonwealth bid city pulls out]&lt;/ref&gt;

That left Abuja and Glasgow as the remaining bidders, with Abuja seen as a likely favourite due to the basis of its campaign that Africa has never before hosted the Commonwealth Games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7086584.stm BBC News – Nigerians keen to host games]&lt;/ref&gt; The deadline for formal submission of bids to the Commonwealth Games Federation, in the form of a Candidate City File, was set for May 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glasgow2014.com/Our-Bid/The-story-so-far/ Glasgow 2014 – The Story so far] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624082132/http://www.glasgow2014.com/Our-Bid/The-story-so-far/ |date=2008-06-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both bids were highly recommended, though Glasgow's bid team had made use of extensive [[benchmarking]] against the [[2002 Commonwealth Games]] in [[Manchester]] and the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne and as a result, its bid was deemed technically superior according to the CGF Evaluation Report that was released in September 2007. The Commonwealth Games Evaluation Commission concluded that: "Glasgow has shown it has the ability to stage the 2014 Commonwealth Games to a standard which would continue to enhance the image and prestige of the Games." This put Glasgow ahead in terms of the technical comprehensiveness of its bid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/6977764.stm BBC News – City ahead in Commonwealth race]&lt;/ref&gt;

The final decision on the host city of the 2014 Commonwealth Games was held in [[Colombo]], [[Sri Lanka]] on 9 November 2007 at the Commonwealth Games Federation General Assembly, attended by all 71 [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] Games member associations. Each bid city made a presentation to the General Assembly, the order of which was determined by drawing lots. Glasgow's delegation was led by Louise Martin, chair of the Commonwealth Games Council for Scotland, First Minister [[Alex Salmond]], athlete Jamie Quarry and Leader of [[Glasgow City Council]] Steven Purcell. The presentation also included a promotional film narrated by [[Sean Connery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glasgow2014.com/Media-Centre/News-releases/TEXTOFTHEPRESENTATIONSFROMSRILANKA.htm Glasgow 2014 Presentation Transcript] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723121116/http://www.glasgow2014.com/Media-Centre/News-releases/TEXTOFTHEPRESENTATIONSFROMSRILANKA.htm |date=2008-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Abuja's delegation was led by General [[Yakubu Gowon]], head of the Abuja 2014 Commonwealth Games bid team. The CGF members subsequently voted for their preferred candidate in a secret ballot. As there were only two bids, the winner was announced by the CGF President, Mike Fennell, after the first round of voting, with the winner only requiring a simple majority. Celebrations were held at Glasgow's [[Glasgow City Halls|Old Fruitmarket]], where a crowd of over 1,200 had gathered to watch the result live.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glasgow2014.com/Media-Centre/wewon/In+pictures+-+the+Old+Fruitmarket+on+NOvember+9.htm The Old Fruitmarket in Pictures]&lt;/ref&gt;

===2015 European Rugby Challenge Cup and European Rugby Champions Cup Finals===
The inaugural finals of the new European rugby union competitions, the [[European Rugby Champions Cup]] and [[European Rugby Challenge Cup]], were held in London. On 1 May 2015, the [[Twickenham Stoop]] hosted the final of the second-tier [[2014–15 European Rugby Challenge Cup|Challenge Cup]]. The following day, the adjacent [[Twickenham Stadium]] hosted the inaugural [[2015 European Rugby Champions Cup Final|Champions Cup Final]]. Including finals of the former [[Heineken Cup]] and [[European Challenge Cup]], these were the fifth European club rugby finals for each venue.

===2015 World Orienteering Championships===
The 2015 [[World Orienteering Championships]] were hosted by [[Scotland]] and based in [[Inverness]] during August 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-14579744 | work=BBC News | title=Highlands to host World Orienteering Championships | date=18 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Championships were awarded on 18 August 2011 at an [[International Orienteering Federation]] press conference, beating out a bid by Sweden. The championships were previously held in Scotland on two occasions, in 1976 and 1999.

===2015 Rugby World Cup===
{{main|2015 Rugby World Cup}}

===2017 ICC Champions Trophy===
Following the 2013 Champions Trophy, the [[International Cricket Council]] planned to replace the Champions Trophy in the cricketing calendar with the [[ICC World Test Championship]] in [[Test cricket]]. This was the second time the ICC had announced this plan; it had previously intended to launch the Test Championship in 2013, with the [[England and Wales Cricket Board]] (ECB) hosting the inaugural event, but scrapped the original plans in 2011. In 2014, the ICC again cancelled the Test Championship in favour of continuing to hold the Champions Trophy, and the ECB, which had been awarded the 2017 Test Championship, was given hosting rights for the 2017 Champions Trophy as compensation.

===2017 World Para Athletics Championships===
On 19 December 2012, London was announced as host of the [[2017 World Para Athletics Championships|2017 edition]] of the event then known as the IPC Athletics World Championships, using the [[London Stadium|Olympic Stadium]] built for the [[2012 Olympic Games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/disability-sport/20782283|title=London named host city for 2017 Paralympic World Championships|date=19 December 2012|accessdate=19 December 2012|work=BBC sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of the event, the [[International Paralympic Committee]], which serves as the governing body for disability athletics, had renamed the competition as the [[World Para Athletics Championships]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://www.paralympic.org/news/ipc-rebrand-10-sports-it-acts-international-federation |title=The IPC to rebrand the 10 sports it acts as International Federation for |publisher=International Paralympic Committee |date=30 November 2016 |accessdate=13 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The event was spectacularly successful by the standards of previous editions of these championships. In all, 305,000 tickets were sold for the event—more than were sold for the previous eight editions of these championships combined, and only 10,000 less than [[Rio de Janeiro]] sold for athletics at the [[2016 Summer Paralympics]]. The [[2015 IPC Athletics World Championships]] in [[Qatar]] had total sales of only 15,000.&lt;ref name="Inside the Games"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1055982/exclusive-london-abandons-plan-to-bid-for-2019-world-para-athletics-championships |title=Exclusive: London abandons plan to bid for 2019 World Para Athletics Championships |first=Duncan |last=Mackay |publisher=''Inside the Games''  |date=29 September 2017 |accessdate=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As for the Challenge Cup (and ''its'' predecessor, the original European Challenge Cup), this will also be the 15th final staged in the UK, and the 12th in England.

The hosting rights were awarded in April 2006, after England withdrew from the bidding to host the [[2015 Cricket World Cup]], which was held in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]. In turn, those countries had been defeated by [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], and [[Sri Lanka]] for the right to stage the [[2011 Cricket World Cup|2011]] contest.

==Events speculated==

===Super Bowl===
In 2007, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell stated that "There is a great deal of interest in holding a Super Bowl in London". However, at that time, the earliest Super Bowl London could host would have been [[Super Bowl XLVII]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3065254 |title=Goodell says NFL to look into playing Super Bowl in London |agency=Associated Press |publisher=''ESPN.com'' |date=15 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, British media reports suggested that London was planning to submit bids for the 2014, 2015 and 2017 Super Bowls, although by that time, Goodell denied any NFL interest in a London bid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=4130864 |title=Report: London eyes Super Bowl |work=ESPN.com |date=3 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the [[Super Bowl XLVIII|2014 game]] was awarded to the New Meadowlands Stadium, now known as [[MetLife Stadium]], in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]] (near [[New York City]]) with London not submitting a formal bid. London also did not submit a bid for the [[Super Bowl XLIX|2015 game]], which was awarded to [[University of Phoenix Stadium]] in the [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] area.&lt;ref name="2015 Super Bowl"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7088528/super-bowl-returning-phoenix-arizona-area-2015 |title=Arizona awarded 2015 Super Bowl |agency=Associated Press |work=ESPN.com |date=11 October 2011 |accessdate=11 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Super Bowl LI|2017 game]], which would mark the 50th anniversary of [[Super Bowl I|the first Super Bowl]] (but the 51st game in the series), was eventually awarded to [[NRG Stadium]] (previously Reliant Stadium) in [[Houston]], also without a London bid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenthal|first=Gregg|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000205086/article/san-francisco-awarded-super-bowl-l-houston-lands-li|title=San Francisco awarded Super Bowl L; Houston lands LI|publisher=[[National Football League]]|date=21 May 2013|accessdate=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UEFA Euro 2016===
In December 2006, the [[Football Association of Wales]] announced it was tentatively considering the possibility of jointly hosting the tournament with the [[Scottish Football Association]]. Scotland, along with the [[Republic of Ireland]], bid for [[Euro 2008]] and there has been much discussion over whether the nation should consider a solo bid for Euro 2016. The entrance into government of the [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) had previously boosted the hopes of such an outcome.

Ultimately it was announced on 9 March 2009 that Scotland and Wales, who had planned to bid together, decided the cost of staging the event was too great. Factors sited were principally the dire economic situation and the fact that 2016 would see the tournament expand to 24 teams from 16, greatly increasing the cost of hosting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/7918050.stm | work=BBC News | title=Wales and Scotland ditch Euro bid | date=2009-03-02 | accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Squaw Valley was an undeveloped area at the time of being awarded the Olympics, the organizing committee was free to build a tailor-made Olympic resort.&lt;ref&gt;Squaw Valley Organizing Committee: 33&lt;/ref&gt; The organizing committee originally intended to house all events in Squaw Valley proper, but real estate developments in Squaw Valley made this difficult. In 1958 the organizing committee therefore decided to move all cross-country and biathlon events to McKinney Creek.&lt;ref name=s115&gt;Squaw Valley Organizing Committee: 115&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Rolf Gerlofsen had surveyed the area in March 1957, and work on the biathlon tracks and facilities was undertaken and completed during the summer of 1958. It was the first time that pull targets were installed for a biathlon competition.&lt;ref name=s118&gt;Squaw Valley Organizing Committee: 118&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Work on the stadium began in August 1959.&lt;ref name=s109&gt;Squaw Valley Organizing Committee: 109&lt;/ref&gt; Plans for the tracks were approved by the [[International Ski Federation]]'s Knut Korsvold and [[Sigge Bergman]], after which construction of the trails could start in the summer 1959. Trial events were undertaken in 1959, in which it was found that mechanical track preparation was more efficient than manual, given that there was at least 45&amp;nbsp;centimeters (18&amp;nbsp;in) of snow.&lt;ref name=s115 /&gt; After the Olympics, the stadium was dismounted.
 
==Facilities==
McKinney Creek Stadium was located immediately off [[California State Route 89]], 19&amp;nbsp;kilometers (12&amp;nbsp;mi) south of Squaw Valley. It was the only venue to not be located in the ski resort itself.&lt;ref name=s115 /&gt; The stadium was {{convert|250|m|sp=us}} long and between {{convert|34|and|45|m|sp=us}} wide. [[Bleacher]]s were erected on one side of the finish line with space for 1,000 spectators and 200 press officers. A 16 by 4 meter (54 by 13 ft) [[scoreboard]] was built behind the finish line, which at any given time showed the latest times and the ten best results. Flags for all participating nations at the games were hoisted along the stadium.&lt;ref name=s109 /&gt;
 
The main building was the Timing Building, which consisted of a calculations room, a communications room, an office for the race secretary in addition to areas for timing staff and equipment. The upper section was used by the public announcer and featured sixteen radio booths. Two 6 by 15 meter (20 by 48 ft) [[Quonset hut]]s with a total sixteen rooms were built for competitors for waxing, resting and changing. Lack of water caused the stadium to lack showers. An identically sized Quonset hut was built for administration personnel and course preparation works. A larger 6 by 20 meter (20 by 64 ft) Quonset hut was built for the press, which included typewriters, [[teletype machine]]s, telephones and a [[darkroom]].&lt;ref name=s109 /&gt;
 
The biathlon course had four shooting ranges along the {{convert|20|km|sp=us|adj=on}} course. A {{convert|200|m|sp=us|adj=on}} range was installed at {{convert|6.5|km|sp=us}}, a {{convert|250|m|sp=us|adj=on}} range at {{convert|9.5|km|sp=us}}, a {{convert|150|m|sp=us|adj=on}} range at {{convert|12.5|km|sp=us}} and a {{convert|100|m|sp=us|adj=on}} range at {{convert|15|km|sp=us}}. The ranges had 15 pull-type targest with a "sleeve and plunger" system with five recharges. This allowed up to 75 participants in the race. An additional practacing range was built in the Squaw Valley–Deer Park area, in addition to the {{convert|250|m|sp=us|adj=on}} range being available for training. Coordination of the shooting station was undertaken by four groups of twenty men from the [[United States Air Force Rifle School]]. First aid stations were installed at each range.&lt;ref name=s118 /&gt;
 
Track preparation was undertaken every evening before the events. Crews were assigned to sections of tracks, with the responsibility of skiing the courses one and a half hours before start, policing the section and removing markers after the event. Each event was color-coded and all marking and material for each event used the colors for visual identification. Training tracks were available in the McKinney Park area and the Squaw Valley–Deer Park area. Both official electronic and unofficial manual timing was used. Interval times were taken at {{convert|5|km|sp=us|adj=on}} intervals and phoned to the stadium.&lt;ref name=s115 /&gt;
 
==Events==
Cross-country skiing consisted of [[cross-country skiing at the 1960 Winter Olympics|six events]]—four for men and two for women, including a [[relay race]] for both genders. The [[cross-country skiing at the 1960 Winter Olympics – Men's 30 kilometre|men's 30 kilometer]] saw a [[Sweden at the 1960 Winter Olympics|Swedish]] double won by [[Sixten Jernberg]] ahead of [[Rolf Ramgard]].&lt;ref name=s116&gt;Squaw Valley Organizing Committee: 116&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[cross-country skiing at the 1960 Winter Olympics – Men's 15 kilometre|men's 15 kilometer]], Jernberg finished second after [[Norway at the 1960 Winter Olympics|Norway]]'s [[Hakon Brusveen]].&lt;ref name=s115 /&gt; The [[cross-country skiing at the 1960 Winter Olympics – Men's 4 × 10 kilometre relay|men's 4 × 10 kilometer relay]] saw [[Finland at the 1960 Winter Olympics|Finland]] win ahead of Norway and the Soviet Union. The [[United States at the 1960 Winter Olympics|United States]] finished last of the eleven teams.&lt;ref name=s117&gt;Squaw Valley Organizing Committee: 117&lt;/ref&gt; The final men's race was the [[cross-country skiing at the 1960 Winter Olympics – Men's 50 kilometre|men's 50 kilometer]], which saw a Finish double with [[Kalevi Hämäläinen]] win ahead of [[Veikko Hakulinen]] followed by three SWedes.&lt;ref name=s116 /&gt; The men's relay saw the largest crowd, of 3,000 spectators.&lt;ref name=s115 /&gt;
 
The [[cross-country skiing at the 1960 Winter Olympics – Women's 10 kilometre|women's 10 kilometer]] saw the [[Soviet Union at the 1960 Winter Olympics|Soviet Union]] win the four top positions, with [[Maria Gusakova]] winning gold and [[Lyubov Kozyreva (cross-country skier)|Lyubov Kozyreva]] winning silver. Five teams entered the [[cross-country skiing at the 1960 Winter Olympics – Women's 3 × 5 kilometre relay|women's 3 × 5 kilometer relay]]. Despite the Soviet dominance in the individual race, Sweden was successful at beating the Soviet Union, ahead of Finland, [[Poland at the 1960 Winter Olympics|Poland]] and [[Germany at the 1960 Winter Olympics|Germany]].&lt;ref name=s117 /&gt;
 
The ski jumping part of the [[Nordic combined at the 1960 Winter Olympics|Nordic combined]] took place at [[Papoose Peak Jumps]] in Squaw Valley.&lt;ref name=s104&gt;Squaw Valley Organizing Committee: 104&lt;/ref&gt; Germany's [[Georg Thoma]] won the ski jumping event and succeeded at defending the gold through the 15&amp;nbsp;kilometer cross-country race. The Soviet Union's [[Dmitriy Kochkin]] finished second after the jumps, but was relegated to fifth after the cross-country event, with Norway's [[Tormod Knutsen]] taking silver.&lt;ref name=s106&gt;Squaw Valley Organizing Committee: 106&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The 1960 Winter Olympics saw the debut of biathlon. Thirty competitors from nine nations entered [[Biathlon at the 1960 Winter Olympics|the 20 kilometer race]], which was undertaken with one-minute interval start.&lt;ref name=s118 /&gt; The race was won by [[Klas Lestander]] of Sweden ahead of [[Finland at the 1960 Winter Olympics|Finland]]'s [[Antti Tyrvainen]] and four Soviet biathletes.&lt;ref name=s120&gt;Squaw Valley Organizing Committee: 120&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Olympic Committee of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea''' ({{lang-ko|조선민주주의인민공화국 올림픽 위원회}}; [[List of IOC country codes|IOC code]]: '''PRK''') is the [[National Olympic Committee]] (NOC) representing [[North Korea]] (competing either as '''DPR Korea''' or as the country's full official name, the '''Democratic People's Republic of Korea''').&lt;ref name="GrassoMallon2015"/&gt;

==History==
Before the [[Korean War]], the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) recognized a single Korean [[National Olympic Committee]] (NOC) representing both the North and [[South Korea]], based in [[Seoul]]. After the war, North Korea displayed dissatisfaction with this arrangement, and repeatedly called for the creation of a North Korean NOC. The IOC declined these pleas on the grounds that there could be only one NOC per country.&lt;ref name="Hill1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hill|first=Christopher R.|title=Olympic Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IPToAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA164|year=1996|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester|isbn=978-0-7190-4451-9|page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of the lack of recognition, the Olympic Committee of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was founded in 1953&lt;ref name="Hoare2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=James Hoare|title=Historical Dictionary of Democratic People's Republic of Korea|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZI-6NARaLusC&amp;pg=PA294|date=13 July 2012|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-6151-0|page=294}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it applied to join the IOC in June 1956.&lt;ref name="GrassoMallon2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grasso|first1=John|last2=Mallon|first2=Bill|last3=Heijmans|first3=Jeroen|title=Historical Dictionary of the Olympic Movement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uCN1CQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA316|edition=5th|year=2015|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|location=Lanham|isbn=978-1-4422-4860-1|pages=315-316|chapter=Korea, Democratic People's Republic of (North Korea) (PRK)}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 1957 session of the IOC, the [[Olympic Committee of the USSR]] asked the IOC to provisionally recognize the North Korean NOC on the grounds that the [[Nationales Olympisches Komitee für Ostdeutschland|East German NOC]] had been admitted alongside the [[Olympic Committee of West Germany]].&lt;ref name="Hill1996"/&gt; Recognition was to be done under the condition that the two Korean NOCs would agree to send a unified team to [[1960 Summer Olympics]] in [[Rome]],&lt;ref name="Hill1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GrassoMallon2015"/&gt; but the plans failed due to opposition by the South's [[Korean Olympic Committee]].&lt;ref name="GrassoMallon2015"/&gt; The matter of a unified team was debated over the following sessions, and lobbied by the [[Bulgarian Olympic Committee|Bulgarian]] and [[Romanian Olympic and Sports Committee|Romanian NOC]]s, and in 1962 the IOC finally conferred provisional recognition on the North Korean NOC.&lt;ref name="Hill1996"/&gt;

Talks about a unified team continued in 1963, but these talks failed after the NOCs could agree on nothing but the flag, which was to consist of the word "Korea" under the [[Olympic rings]].&lt;ref name="LamChang2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=S. F. Lam|author2=Julian W. Chang|title=The Quest for Gold: Fifty Years of Amateur Sports in Hong Kong, 1947-1997|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y45FBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA137|year=2006|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|isbn=978-962-209-766-7|pages=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1985 and 1988 the NOCs negotiated about co-hosting the [[1988 Summer Olympics]]. The negotiations failed, resulting in North Korea boycotting the Games held in Seoul of South Korea.&lt;ref name="GrassoMallon2015"/&gt;

[[File:Patrick Kerney sacks Aaron Rodgers.jpg|thumb|279x279px|Green Bay quarterback [[Aaron Rodgers]] being sacked by Seattle defensive end [[Patrick Kerney]].]]
In [[American football]] and [[Canadian football]], a '''sack''' occurs when the [[quarterback]] (or another offensive player acting as a passer) is [[tackle (football move)|tackled]] behind the [[line of scrimmage]] before he can throw a [[forward pass]], when the quarterback is tackled behind the line of scrimmage in the "[[passing pocket|pocket]]" and his intent is unclear, or when a passer runs out of bounds behind the line of scrimmage due to defensive pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/Stats_Manuals/Football/2011ez.pdf |title= 2011 Football Statisticians Manual, p. 17 |publisher=NCAA |access-date=October 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This often occurs if the opposing team's [[defensive team|defensive line]], [[linebacker]]s or [[defensive backs]] are able to apply '''pass pressure''' (also called a '''pass rush''') to quickly get past [[blocking (American football)|blocking]] players of the [[offensive team]] (the quarterback's protection), or if the quarterback is unable to find a back to hand the ball off to or an available [[eligible receiver]] (including [[wide receiver]]s, [[running back]]s and [[tight end]]s) to catch the ball, allowing the defense a longer opportunity to tackle the quarterback. 

Performing a sack is advantageous for the defending team as the offence loses a [[Down (gridiron football)|down]], and the line of scrimmage retreats several yards.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Even better for the defense is a sack causing the quarterback to [[fumble]] the ball at or behind the line of scrimmage; this is also known as a '''strip sack''' and can result in a [[Turnover (gridiron football)|turnover]] if the defense manages to obtain the ball. A quarterback that is pressured but avoids a sack can still be adversely affected by being forced to '''hurry'''.

In the [[National Football League]] (NFL), it is possible to record a sack for zero yards. The QB must pass the statistical line of scrimmage to avoid the sack. If a passer is sacked in his own end zone, the result is a [[Safety (gridiron football score)|safety]] and the defending team is awarded two points, unless the football is fumbled and either recovered in the end zone by the defense for a touchdown or recovered by either team outside the end zone.

==Statistical record rules==
To be considered a sack the quarterback must intend to throw a forward pass. If the play is designed for the quarterback to rush (run) the ball, any loss is subtracted from the quarterback's rushing total (and the play is ruled a [[tackle for loss]] as opposed to a sack). If the quarterback's intent is not obvious, statisticians use certain criteria, such as the offensive line blocking scheme, to decide. Unique situations where a loss reduces a quarterback's rushing total (not a sack) are "[[Quarterback kneel|kneel downs]]" (used to run time off the game clock).
[[File:Everson Griffen Aaron Rodgers sack.jpg|thumb|Rodgers sacked by Everson Griffen.]]
A player will receive credit for half of a sack when multiple players contribute to the sacking of a quarterback, even if more than two players contributed.

In the [[National Football League|NFL]] yards lost on the play are added as negative yardage to the team's passing totals; however, the quarterback's individual passing total stats remains unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nflgsis.com/gsis/documentation/stadiumguides/guide_for_statisticians.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[college football|NCAA]] continues to subtract sack yardage from individual rushing totals.

==History==
[[File:Cougars on offense at BYU at Air Force 2010-09-11.jpg|alt=|thumb|A [[BYU Cougars football|BYU]] quarterback being sacked by [[Air Force Falcons football|Air Force]].]]
The term "sack" was first popularized by [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] defensive end [[Deacon Jones]] in the 1960s, who felt that a sack devastated the offense in the same way that a city was devastated when it was sacked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jones, NFL coiner of 'sack the quarterback,' dies at 74|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/04/us/sport-deacon-jones-death/index.html|work=CNN|accessdate=June 5, 2013|date=June 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to former NFL coach [[Marv Levy]], it was [[Washington Redskins]] coach [[George Allen (American football coach)|George Allen]] who actually coined the term when referring to [[Dallas Cowboys]] quarterback [[Craig Morton]].&lt;ref&gt;http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/06/16/levy-explains-how-deacon-jones-came-up-with-sack/&lt;/ref&gt; Allen purportedly stated before a game, "Before we play those Dallas Cowboys, we’re going to take that Morton salt and pour him into a sack."

Prior to "sack", the term "dump" was often used, and the NFL's statistical office recorded all sacks under "dumping the passer".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sack or Dump: To Quarterback It's All Downhill|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19751107&amp;id=72kaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=KikEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5990,3948674|accessdate=June 5, 2013|newspaper=The Milwaukee Journal|date=November 7, 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NFL only began to keep track of times passers lost yardage in 1961&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfl.com/history/randf/records/indiv/passing NFL Records]&lt;/ref&gt; and no credit was given to the defensive player responsible until 1982.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.nfl.com/history/randf/records/indiv/sacks NFL Records]&lt;/ref&gt; Researcher John Turney of the [[Pro Football Researchers Association]] estimated that Jones recorded 173½ sacks in his career.&lt;ref name=branch&gt;{{cite news |last=Branch |first=John |title=Unofficially, Sack Record Doesn't Add Up |date=November 4, 2006 |newspaper=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/04/sports/football/04giants.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6W4mWuYGm?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/04/sports/football/04giants.html?_r=0 |archivedate=February 3, 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversial NFL rule changes made for the [[2018 NFL season|2018 season]] prohibit tacklers landing on the quarterback after making a sack, with the punishment being a [[roughing the passer]] penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2018/9/27/17911444/nfl-roughing-the-passer-penalty-explanation-clay-matthews|title=The NFL’s controversial new roughing the passer rule, explained in a 3-minute read|work=SBNation.com|access-date=2018-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pass pressure==
[[File:Nate Longshore under pressure AFB 071231-F-7061J-010.JPEG|thumb|A quarterback under pressure.]]
Of all forms of defensive pressure against the opposition's passer, sacks provide the most immediate impact by ending the offensive play.&lt;ref name=schatz&gt;{{cite news|last=Schatz|first=Aaron|title=Examining the art of the hurry|date=June 1, 2010|work=ESPN.com|url=http://insider.espn.go.com/nfl/insider/news/story?id=5238886|accessdate=February 2, 2014}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, quarterbacks sometimes avoid a sack by throwing an [[incomplete pass]] or risking an [[interception]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Long|first1=Howie|last2=Czarnecki|first2=John|title=Football For Dummies|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|page=166|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pbduM8Jyc34C&amp;lpg=PA389&amp;dq=quarterback%20hurry%20dummies&amp;pg=PA166#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=February 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Football Outsiders]], a quarterback hurry is the most common form of pass pressure. In the [[2009 NFL season]], there were 1,106 sacks and 3,268 hurries, and a hurried quarterback generally averaged fewer yards per pass play compared to the average pass play.&lt;ref name=schatz/&gt;

[[File:Mini-Rugby.jpg|thumb|left|Youth playing Flag Rugby at the Conrose Park in Halifax]]
The '''Nova Scotia Rugby Union''' (ORU) also known as '''[http://rugbyns.ns.ca Rugby Nova Scotia]'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rugbyns.ns.ca|title=Rugby Nova Scotia Homepage|last=Nova Scotia|first=Rugby|website=http://rugbyns.ns.ca|access-date=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the provincial governing body for the sport of [[rugby union]] in the [[Canada|Canadian]] province of [[Nova Scotia]] and a Provincial Union of [[Rugby Canada]]. Rugby Nova Scotia governs various levels of rugby (Mini-Rugby, Under-12, Under-14, Under-16, Under-18, Senior, Masters, Non-contact).

You can find a list of clubs in Nova Scotia [http://rugbyns.ns.ca/content_page/10022420/ here].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5655">'''Snowboard racing''' is a form of [[snowboarding]] where competitors attempt to obtain the fastest time down a course. Snowboard racing can be done against the clock, or by two or more competitors racing in a head-to-head format.

The current [[Snowboarding at the Winter Olympics|Olympic snowboarding]] racing events are [[Snowboard racing#Parallel Giant Slalom|parallel giant slalom]], [[Snowboard racing#Parallel Slalom|parallel slalom]] and [[snowboard cross]].
 
== Governing body ==
World tour events in snowboard racing are hosted by the [[Federation international du ski|FIS (Federation International De Ski).]] The FIS currently organises both a [[FIS Snowboard World Cup|world cup]] tour and a [[FIS Snowboard World Championships|world championship]] for each of the Olympic snowboard racing events (parallel giant slalom, parallel slalom and snowboard cross). The [[International Snowboard Federation]] was the former governing body.

The struggling [[International Snowboard Federation]] does not currently host a world tour in any snowboard racing format, but it is possible that it may host a tour for banked slalom in coming years.

== Events==

The major racing events are as follows:

=== Parallel giant slalom ===
(PGS): 
The '''parallel giant slalom''' event includes two evenly spaced courses (10–15 meters apart) with vertical distances of 20–27 meters between turning gates, allowing speeds up to 70&amp;nbsp;km/h. Once qualifications are complete, racers are placed in a head to head knockout format, starting with 16 athletes and moving to a final race for 1st and 2nd. It uses a much longer course than parallel slalom with gates set further apart (spaced 20–27 meters apart), resulting in even higher speeds, while racing against an opponent on a similar course place parallel to the other course. Parallel giant slalom is an Olympic event, and the FIS organises a world tour and world cup for this event.

=== Giant slalom ===
(GS): The original Olympic discipline for snowboard racing was '''giant slalom''', but it featured in only one Winter Olympics (Nagano 1998). It uses a much longer course than slalom, with gates set further apart (spaced 25–32 meters apart), resulting in even higher speeds. This event is still staged at Continental Cup and Regional level, but the last giant slalom world cup was held in 2000 at [https://archive.is/20130629051558/http://www.fis-ski.com/uk/604/1228.html?event_id=5835&amp;cal_suchsector=SB Mt. Ste Anne, Quebec, Canada], with [[Jasey-Jay Anderson]] (CAN) and  [[Karine Ruby]] (FRA)] winning.

=== Parallel slalom ===
(PSL): '''Parallel slalom''' debuted at the [[2014 Winter Olympics|Olympics in 2014 in Sochi, Russia]]. Boarders race downhill through sets of gates that force extremely tight and quick turns (spaced 8–15 meters apart), requiring plenty of technical skill while racing against an opponent in the other course.

=== Triple slalom ===
(TS): The '''triple slalom''' is a concept event that has been tested as a North American cup event in November 2011 at Copper Mountain. It was spearheaded by the Canadian team, as FIS had discussed it as a world cup event and possibly an Olympic format for slalom, but it had not been tested till that point. Once it was tested, it was realized it may have potential but was not the right fit for an Olympic discipline.

=== Slalom ===
(SL): In '''slalom''', boarders race downhill through sets of gates that force extremely tight and quick turns, (spaced 8–15 meters apart) requiring plenty of technical skill while racing against the clock. The winner of this event is based on 2 runs combined time.

=== Super-G ===
(SG):  Boarders competing in a '''Super G''' event travel through sets of gates spaced 30–40 meters apart, requiring plenty of courage and speed while testing the endurance of the racer at speeds of up to 100&amp;nbsp;km/h. This has not been a world cup event since 1999 at [http://www.fis-ski.com/uk/604/1228.html?event_id=4330&amp;cal_suchsector=SB Mt. Bachelor, Oregon]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

=== Snowboard cross ===
{{further|Snowboard cross}} 
(SBX): In '''snowboard cross''', four snowboard racers start simultaneously atop an inclined course. The racers go over a series of features while trying to reach the finish line first. '''Snowboard cross''' became an Olympic sport in 2006.

=== Team snowboard cross ===
'''Team snowboard cross''' is a relatively new event. US Snowboard requested it be a part of the Winter Olympics starting in 2018. It will be confirmed in Fall 2014. --MJB 18:06, 29 June 2014 (UTC)[http://www.fis-ski.com/snowboard/freestyle-snowboard/news-multimedia/news/article=initiatives-for-new-olympic-events-move-ahead.html FIS Snowboard ].

=== Banked slalom ===
'''Banked slalom''' is a loosely organized group of events, primarily in the Pacific Northwest, but now seen increasingly across Western North America and the rest of the Snowboard world. Well established and iconic Banked Slalom events include Mt. Baker Banked Slalom, Neil Edgeworth Banked Slalom (NEBS) at Big White, BC and Dicks Ditch Classic (Jackson Hole, Wy). It consists of a gully run that is left largely unprepared by machines, safety fencing on the turns and in spill zones and an open relaxed format that promotes a fun spirited friendship among competitors and volunteers.  It is a rite of passage to win the Baker Banked Slalom, including many of the strongest Snowboard racers and freestylers in the world including Ross Rebagliati, Terje Haakonsen and Maelle Ricker.

'''''The Crowd Goes Wild''''' is a 30-minute sports entertainment show broadcast on [[New Zealand]] nationwide television channel [[Prime (New Zealand)|Prime TV]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.primetv.co.nz/default.asp?a=7&amp;t=7&amp;View=FullStory&amp;newsID=1 Prime TV - The Crowd Goes Wild]&lt;/ref&gt; The show premiered on Monday 26 June 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/CU0606/S00099.htm The Crowd Goes Wild - Weekdays at 7pm on Prime] ''Scoop NZ Website'', 13 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Crowd Goes Wild'' is presented by sports journalist [[Andrew Mulligan]]  and [[James McOnie]], [[Hayley Holt]], [[Ric Salizzo]], [[Wairangi Koopu]], Chris Key or Huw Beynon if either of the main hosts are away.  The programme covers the sporting events of the day in a lighthearted format, broadcast live from the studio with pre-recorded segments and clips.  It airs five times per week at 7:00pm on weeknights and is replayed on both Prime and Sky Sports .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.primetv.co.nz/Default.aspx?tabid=93&amp;art_id=47 The Crowd Goes Wild] ''Prime TV''&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2010 the show was moved from its live 7pm timeslot to 10:30pm, with the show being recorded at 6:30pm (and played at that time on Sky Sport 1). This move was unpopular, criticised by at least one commentator, and ultimately reversed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/blogs/on-the-box/4297067/An-open-letter-to-The-Crowd-Goes-Wild Philpott, Chris: 'An open letter to The Crowd Goes Wild' Stuff.co.nz, 2/11/2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

Field reporters include James McOnie, [[Hayley Holt]], Chris Key, Makere Gibbons, former All Black [[Josh Kronfeld]], former [[Silver Fern]] [[Cat Tuivaiti]], Rugby League star [[Wairangi Koopu]], Winter Olympic athlete [[Anna Willcox-Silfverberg]], and former [[Silver Fern]] [[Storm Purvis]] . &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skytv.co.nz/Default.aspx?tabid=616&amp;art_id=19139 The Crowd Goes Wild Interview with James and James] ''SkyWatch''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.primetv.co.nz/Default.aspx?tabid=93&amp;art_id=47 The Crowd Goes Wild Friday] ''Prime TV''&lt;/ref&gt;

Former [[Sports Cafe]] host and veteran journalist [[Ric Salizzo]] is the show's executive producer, who also on rare occasions will host as well.

After graduation, he worked as a biomedical design engineer at the [[University of Utah]]&lt;ref name="lemelson"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/phillips.html | title = Inventor of the Week, January 2007: Van Phillips | publisher = [[Lemelson Foundation|Lemelson]]-[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] program | accessdate=2008-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; before starting his own company, Flex-Foot Incorporated in 1984.

Phillips ultimately created a workable artificial foot made from [[Carbon (fiber)|carbon graphite]]. Unlike all previous prostheses,{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} it stored kinetic energy from the wearer's steps as potential energy, like a spring, allowing the wearer to run and jump. A prosthetic foot that he created, the [[Flex-Foot Cheetah]], is used by double-amputee and [[Paralympic Games|Paralympics]] gold-medalist [[Oscar Pistorius]], and about 90 percent of Paralympics participants use a variation of the original Flex-Foot design, as well as thousands of people around the world.&lt;ref name="lemelson" /&gt; Phillips sold Flex-Foot to [[Ossur]] in 2000, which continues to manufacture the artificial foot.&lt;ref name="smithsonian" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Personal Call to a Prosthetic Invention|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/02/sports/olympics/02cheetah.html?ref=sports|date=2008-07-02|accessdate=2008-07-02|publisher=[[New York Times]] | first=Carol | last=Pogash}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Össur#Prosthetics]].

In 1999 he established Second Wind, a [[non-profit organization]] to provide inexpensive and resistant prostheses to amputees around the world, and is now working to create a prosthetic leg for [[land mine]] victims in developing countries.&lt;ref name="smithsonian"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://invention.smithsonian.org/centerpieces/ilives/van_phillips/van_phillips.html | title = Artificial Parts: Van Phillips | accessdate=2008-07-02 | author = Martha Davidson | publisher = [[Smithsonian Institution]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 he received the [[Brian Blatchford Memorial Prize]] from the [[International Society for Prosthetics and Orthotics]].&lt;ref name="smithsonian" /&gt;
