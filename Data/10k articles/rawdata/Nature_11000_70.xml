'''1KUNS-PF''' is the first [[Kenya]]n satellite to be launched into space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/the-download/611127/kenyas-first-satellite-is-now-in-earth-orbit/|title=Kenya's first satellite is now in Earth orbit|work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=12 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC Live"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-africa-44028283|title=Africa Live this week:|last=|first=|date=|work=BBC News|access-date=12 May 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 10 centimetre square satellite was developed and assembled by the University of Nairobi. Technical support was provided by [[JAXA|Japan's Aerospace Exploration Agency]] and it was launched from the International Space Station.&lt;ref name="BBC Live" /&gt;

== Background == 
The idea to have a Kenyan built satellite in space began in September 2015 with the planning and design of the space module. Financial support was obtained for the project when the University of Nairobi won a competitive grant from the [[United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs]] (UNOOSA) in 2016.&lt;ref name="Japan Times"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/05/12/national/science-health/kenyas-first-satellite-released-japans-kibo-module-iss/|title=Kenya's first satellite released from Japan's Kibo module at ISS|date=12 May 2018|work=The Japan Times Online|access-date=17 May 2018|language=en-US|issn=0447-5763}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University of Nairobi was the first institution to benefit from a joint project between the United Nations and [[JAXA]].&lt;ref name="Japan Times" /&gt; The satellite was given the acronym 1KUNS-PF which in full is First Kenya University Nano Satellite-Precursor Flight. External technical support was provided by [[Sapienza University of Rome|Sapienza University]] together with two Italian companies.&lt;ref name="VOA"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.voanews.com/a/kenya-satellite-launch/4394281.html|title=Kenya Steps Into Space with First Satellite Launch|last=Schearf|first=Daniel|work=VOA|access-date=17 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of the programme was about a million dollars.&lt;ref name="VOA" /&gt; The satellite orbits 400 kilometers above the earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cae.uonbi.ac.ke/sites/default/files/cae/engineering/engineering/1KUNS-PF_Cubesat_1.0_rev3.pdf|title=1KUNS-PF|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Launch and purpose ==
On 2 April 2018, the satellite was carried on the [[International Space Station]] onboard a [[SpaceX CRS-14]] which was launched on a Falcon 9 rocket with help from the National Aeronautic and Space Administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.n2yo.com/satellite-news/Kenyas-First-Locally-Made-Nanosatellite-Will-Be-Launched-From-ISS-in-May/4959|title=Kenya's first locally made nanosatellite will be launched from ISS in May|website=N2YO.com – Real Time Satellite Tracking and Predictions|access-date=18 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was deployed from the space station into its orbit from the [[Kibo (ISS module)|Kibō module]] on 11 May 2018.&lt;ref name="Japan Times" /&gt; Its signal was successfully received from the Ground Station in Rome by the students of Sapienza University of Rome. Its launch is the third for an African country after [[GhanaSat-1]] and [[Nigeria EduSat-1]] which went into service in 2017.&lt;ref name="Standard"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/business/article/2001280088/kenya-deploys-its-first-satellite|title=Cheers as Kenya's first satellite sent to space|last=Ngasike|first=Kenneth Kipruto and Lucas|work=The Standard|access-date=17 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pulse.ng/bi/tech/4-african-countries-with-satellites-in-the-orbit-id8078677.html|title=4 African countries with satellites in the orbit|last=Taiwo|first=Shakirudeen|access-date=17 May 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to 1KUNS-PF two other nano satellites, [[Ubakusat]] and [[Proyecto Irazú]] were also onboard the Falcon-9 rocket to the ISS. All three satellites were deployed into space from the ISS by Japanese astronaut [[Norishige Kanai]].&lt;ref name="Japan Times" /&gt;

The 1KUNS-PF is a [[Nano Satellites|nano-satellite]] with the size of a coffee cup.&lt;ref name="BBC Live" /&gt; Its operation will include the mapping of Kenya's land mass, the monitoring of the coastline and helping combat illegal logging activities.&lt;ref name="BBC Live" /&gt; The satellite will orbit the earth for about 12 to 18 months before de-orbiting and burning up in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Standard" /&gt;

'''Alternative energy''' is any energy source that is an alternative to [[fossil fuel]]. These alternatives are intended to address concerns about fossil fuels, such as its high [[carbon dioxide emissions]], an important factor in [[global warming]]. [[Marine energy]], [[hydroelectric power|hydroelectric]], [[wind power|wind]], [[geothermal power|geothermal]] and [[solar power]] are all alternative [[energy source|sources of energy]].

The nature of what constitutes an alternative energy source has  changed considerably over time, as have controversies regarding energy use.  Because of the variety of energy choices and differing goals of their advocates, defining some energy types as "alternative" is considered very controversial.&lt;ref name="Zehner 2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Zehner|first=Ozzie|title=Green Illusions|date=2012|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln and London|pages=1–169, 331–42|url=http://greenillusions.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coal as an alternative to wood===
In the late [[medieval]] period, [[coal]] was the new alternative fuel to save the society from overuse of the dominant fuel, wood. The [[deforestation]] had resulted in shortage of wood, at that time soft coal appeared as a savior. Historian [[Norman F. Cantor]] describes how:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Europeans had lived in the midst of vast forests throughout the earlier medieval centuries. After 1250 they became so skilled at deforestation that by 1500 AD they were running short of wood for heating and cooking... By 1500 Europe was on the edge of a fuel and nutritional disaster, [from] which it was saved in the sixteenth century only by the burning of soft coal and the cultivation of [[potatoes]] and [[maize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

===Petroleum as an alternative to whale oil===
[[Whale oil]] was the dominant form of lubrication and fuel for lamps in the early 19th century, but the [[History of whaling|depletion of the whale stocks]] by mid century caused whale oil prices to skyrocket setting the stage for the adoption of petroleum which was first commercialized in [[Titusville, Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]] in 1859.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

=== Ethanol as an alternative to fossil fuels===
{{Main|Ethanol fuel}}
In 1917, [[Alexander Graham Bell]] advocated ethanol from corn, wheat and other foods as an alternative to coal and oil, stating that the world was in measurable distance of depleting these fuels.  For Bell, the problem requiring an alternative was lack of renewability of orthodox energy sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Alcohol makes a beautiful, clean and efficient fuel, and where not intended for human consumption can be manufactured very cheaply from corn stalks and in fact from almost any vegetable matter capable of fermentation.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1970s, [[Ethanol fuel in Brazil|Brazil has had an ethanol fuel program]] which has allowed the country to become the world's second largest producer of [[ethanol]] (after the United States) and the world's largest exporter.&lt;ref name="RFA1E"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ethanolrfa.org/industry/statistics/#E |title=Industry Statistics: Annual World Ethanol Production by Country |publisher=Renewable Fuels Association |accessdate=2008-05-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408091334/http://www.ethanolrfa.org/industry/statistics/#E |archivedate=2008-04-08 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brazil's ethanol fuel program uses modern equipment and cheap [[sugar cane]] as feedstock, and the residual cane-waste ([[bagasse]]) is used to process heat and power.&lt;ref name="MLA_2004"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eners.ch/plateforme/medias/macedo_2004.pdf |author=Macedo Isaias |author2=M.

[[Cellulosic ethanol]] can be produced from a diverse array of feedstocks, and involves the use of the whole crop.

===Coal gasification as an alternative to petroleum===
In the 1970s, President [[Jimmy Carter]]'s administration advocated [[coal gasification]] as an alternative to expensive imported oil.  The program, including the [[Synthetic Fuels Corporation]] was scrapped when petroleum prices plummeted in the 1980s. The carbon footprint and [[environmental impact of the coal industry|environmental impact of coal]] gasification are both very high.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

==Existing types of alternative energy==
* [[Hydro electricity]] captures energy from falling water.
* [[Nuclear power|Nuclear energy]] uses nuclear fission to release energy stored in the atomic bonds of heavy elements.
* [[Wind energy]] is the generation of electricity from wind, commonly by using propeller-like turbines.
* [[Solar energy]] is the use of energy from the sun. Heat from the sun can be used for [[Solar_thermal_energy|solar thermal applications]] or light can be converted into electricity via photovoltaic devices.
* [[Geothermal energy]] is the use of the earth's internal heat to boil water for heating buildings or generating electricity.
* [[Biofuel]] and [[ethanol]] are plant-derived gasoline substitutes for powering vehicles.
* [[Hydrogen economy|Hydrogen]] can be used as a carrier of energy, produced by various technologies such as cracking of hydrocarbons or water electrolysis.

==Enabling technologies==

[[Ice storage air conditioning]] and [[Storage heater|thermal storage heaters]] are methods of shifting consumption to use low cost off-peak electricity.  When compared to resistance heating, [[heat pumps]]  conserve electrical power (or in rare cases mechanical or thermal power) by collecting heat from a cool source such as a body of water, the ground or the air.

Thermal storage technologies allow heat or cold to be stored for periods of time ranging from diurnal to [[seasonal thermal energy storage|interseasonal]], and can involve storage of [[Sensible heat|sensible energy]] (i.e. by changing the temperature of a medium) or [[latent energy]] (e.g. through phase changes of a medium (i.e. changes from solid to liquid or vice versa), such as between water and slush or ice). Energy sources can be natural (via solar-thermal collectors, or dry cooling towers used to collect winter's cold), waste energy (such as from HVAC equipment, industrial processes or power plants), or surplus energy (such as seasonally from hydropower projects or intermittently from wind farms). The [[Drake Landing Solar Community]] (Alberta, Canada) is illustrative. [[Seasonal thermal energy storage|Borehole thermal energy storage]] allows the community to get 97% of its year-round heat from solar collectors on the garage roofs.&lt;ref&gt;Wong, Bill (June 28, 2011), [http://www.districtenergy.org/assets/pdfs/2011Annual_Conf/Proceedings/A24WONG-v03.pdf "Drake Landing Solar Community"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030520/http://www.districtenergy.org/assets/pdfs/2011Annual_Conf/Proceedings/A24WONG-v03.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}, IDEA/CDEA District Energy/CHP 2011 Conference, Toronto, pp. 1–30, retrieved 21 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wong B., Thornton J.

Some applications require inclusion of a [[Heat pumps|heat pump]].

==Renewable energy vs non-renewable energy==
{{Main|Renewable energy}}
Renewable energy is generated from [[natural resource]]s—such as [[sunlight]],&lt;ref&gt;Including [[solar energy|solar]] and [[radiant energy]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[wind]], [[rain]], [[tidal energy|tides]] and [[geothermal energy|geothermal heat]]—which are renewable (naturally replenished).  When comparing the processes for producing energy, there remain several fundamental differences between renewable energy and fossil fuels.  The process of producing oil, coal, or natural gas fuel is a difficult and demanding process that requires a great deal of complex equipment, physical and chemical processes. On the other hand, alternative energy can be widely produced with basic equipment and natural processes.  Wood, the most renewable and available alternative fuel, emits the same amount of carbon when burned as would be emitted if it degraded naturally.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.whichwoodburningstoves.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; Nuclear power is an alternative to fossil fuels that is non-renewable, like fossil fuels, nuclear ones are a finite resource.

===Ecologically friendly alternatives===
A renewable energy source such as [[biomass]] is sometimes regarded as a good alternative to providing heat and electricity with fossil fuels. Biofuels are not inherently ecologically friendly for this purpose, while burning biomass is carbon-neutral, air pollution is still produced. For example, the [[Netherlands]], once leader in use of [[palm oil]] as a biofuel, has suspended all subsidies for palm oil due to the scientific evidence that their use "may sometimes create more environmental harm than fossil fuels".&lt;ref name=pal&gt;{{Cite journal

===Algae fuel===
[[Algae fuel]] is a [[biofuel]] which is derived from algae. During photosynthesis, algae and other photosynthetic organisms capture carbon dioxide and sunlight and convert it into oxygen and biomass. This is usually done by placing the algae between two panes of glass.  The algae creates three forms of energy fuel: heat (from its growth cycle), biofuel (the natural "oil" derived from the algae), and biomass (from the algae itself, as it is harvested upon maturity).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arup.com/Projects/SolarLeaf.aspx SolarLeaf - bioreactor facade], ARUP Creates First Algae Facade That Produces Energy.&lt;/ref&gt;

The heat can be used to power building systems (such as heat process water) or to produce energy.  Biofuel is oil extracted from the algae upon maturity, and used to create energy similar to the use of [[biodiesel]]. The biomass is the matter left over after extracting the oil and water, and can be harvested to produce combustible methane for energy production, similar to the warmth felt in a compost pile or the methane collected from biodegradable materials in a landfill.  Additionally, the benefits of algae biofuel are that it can be produced industrially, as well as vertically (i.e. as a building facade), thereby obviating the use of arable land and food crops (such as soy, palm, and canola).

===Biomass briquettes===
[[Biomass briquettes]] are being developed in the developing world as an alternative to charcoal.  The technique involves the conversion of almost any plant matter into compressed briquettes that typically have about 70% the calorific value of charcoal.  There are relatively few examples of large scale briquette production. One exception is in North Kivu, in eastern [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], where forest clearance for charcoal production is considered to be the biggest threat to Mountain Gorilla habitat.  The staff of [[Virunga National Park]] have successfully trained and equipped over 3500 people to produce biomass briquettes, thereby replacing charcoal produced illegally inside the national park, and creating significant employment for people living in extreme poverty in conflict affected areas.

====Biogas digestion====
[[Biogas]] digestion harnesses the methane gas that is released when organic waste breaks down in an anaerobic environment. This gas can be retrieved from landfill sites or sewage systems. The gas can be used as a fuel for heat  or, more commonly, electricity generation.

The methane gas that is collected and refined can be used as an energy source for various products.

===Biological hydrogen production===
Hydrogen gas is a completely clean burning fuel; its only by-product is water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hijikata | first1 = Tsuneo | year = 2001 | title = Research and Development of International Clean Energy Network Using Hydrogen Energy | url = | journal = [[International Journal of Hydrogen Energy]] | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 115–129 | doi=10.1016/s0360-3199(01)00089-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also contains relatively high amount of energy compared with other fuels due to its chemical structure.&lt;ref&gt;P. 12, BMW Group Clean Energy ZEV Symposium, September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Without the presence of oxygen, also known as an anaerobic environment, regular cellular respiration cannot take place and a process known as fermentation takes over.

===Hydroelectricity===
{{main|Hydroelectricity}}
[[Hydroelectricity]] provided 75% of the worlds renewable electricity in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/excel/Energy-Economics/statistical-review-2014/BP-Statistical_Review_of_world_energy_2014_workbook.xlsx Historical Data Workbook (2013 calendar year)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140622090917/http://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/excel/Energy-Economics/statistical-review-2014/BP-Statistical_Review_of_world_energy_2014_workbook.xlsx |date=2014-06-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the electricity used today is a result of the heyday of conventional hydroelectric development between 1960 and 1980, which has virtually ceased in Europe and North America due to environmental concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.internationalrivers.org/files/attached-files/world_commission_on_dams_final_report.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303231146/http://www.internationalrivers.org/files/attached-files/world_commission_on_dams_final_report.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Globally there is a trend towards more hydroelectricity. From 2004 to 2014 the installed capacity rose from 715 to 1,055 GW.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/REN12-GSR2015_Onlinebook_low1.pdf Renewables 2015. Global Status Report] Ren21, retrieved 20th January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; A popular alternative to the large dams of the past is [[Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity|run-of-the-river]] where there is no water stored behind a dam and generation usually varies with seasonal rainfall. Using run-of-the-river in wet seasons and solar in dry seasons can balance seasonal variations for both. Another move away from large dams is [[small hydro]], these tend to be situated high up on tributaries, rather than on main rivers in valley bottoms.

===Offshore wind===
Offshore [[wind farms]] are similar to land-based wind farms, but are located on the ocean. Offshore wind farms can be placed in water up to {{convert|40|m}} deep, whereas floating wind turbines can float in water up to {{convert|700|m}} deep.&lt;ref name=works&gt;{{Cite web

The advantage of having a floating wind farm is to be able to harness the winds from the open ocean. Without any obstructions such as hills, trees and buildings, winds from the open ocean can reach up to speeds twice as fast as coastal areas.&lt;ref name=works/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant generation of [[offshore wind energy]] already contributes to electricity needs in [[Europe]] and [[Asia]] and now the first offshore wind farms are under development in U.S. waters. While the offshore wind industry has grown dramatically over the last several decades, especially in Europe, there is still uncertainty associated with how the construction and operation of these wind farms affect marine animals and the [[marine environment]].

Traditional offshore [[wind turbines]] are attached to the seabed in shallower waters within the nearshore marine environment. As offshore wind technologies become more advanced, floating structures have begun to be used in deeper waters where more wind resources exist.&lt;ref name="Tethys"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tethys|url=http://tethys.pnnl.gov/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marine and hydrokinetic energy===
Marine and Hydrokinetic (MHK) or [[marine energy]] development includes projects using the following devices:
* Wave power is the transport of energy by [[wind wave]]s, and the capture of that energy to do useful work – for example, [[electricity generation]] or [[pump]]ing water into reservoirs. A machine able to exploit significant waves in open coastal areas is generally known as a [[Wave energy|wave energy converter]].
* [[Tidal power]] turbines are placed in coastal and estuarine areas and daily flows are quite predictable.
* In-stream turbines in fast-moving rivers
* Ocean current turbines in areas of strong marine currents
* Ocean thermal energy converters in deep tropical waters.&lt;ref name="Tethys"/&gt;

===Nuclear power===
In the year 2015 ten new reactors came online and 67 more were under construction including the first eight new  Generation III+ [[AP1000]] reactors in the US and China and the first four new Generation III [[EPR (nuclear reactor)|EPR]] reactors in Finland, France and China.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/ten-new-nuclear-power-reactors-connected-to-grid-in-2015-highest-number-since-1990&lt;/ref&gt; Reactors are also under construction in Belarus, Brazil, India, Iran, Japan, Pakistan, Russia, Slovakia, South Korea, Turkey, Ukraine and United Arab Emirates.

==Investing in alternative energy==
As an emerging economic sector, there are limited stock market investment opportunities in alternative energy available to the general public. The public can buy shares of alternative energy companies from various stock markets, with wildly volatile returns. The recent IPO of SolarCity demonstrates the nascent nature of this sector- within a few weeks, it already had achieved the second highest market cap within the alternative energy sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=   http://news.investors.com/technology/121412-637156-solarcity-market-cap-puts-it-after-first-solar.htm|title= SolarCity Stock Market Cap Makes It No. 2 Solar Firm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investors can also choose to invest in ETFs (exchange-traded funds) that track an alternative energy index, such as the WilderHill New Energy Index.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nexindex.com/|title= WilderHill New Energy Global Innovation Index}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, there are a number of mutual funds, such as Calvert's Global Alternative Energy Mutual Fund&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.calvert.com/fundprofile.html?fund=971|title= Calvert Global Alternative Energy Fund (CGAEX)|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141106123856/http://www.calvert.com/fundProfile.html?fund=971|archivedate= 2014-11-06|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;   that are a bit more proactive in choosing the selected investments.

Recently, [[Mosaic Inc.]] launched an online platform allowing residents of California and New York to invest directly in solar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://gigaom.com/2013/01/08/solar-mosaic-fully-crowd-funds-its-new-solar-projects-in-less-than-24-hours/|title=  Solar Mosaic fully crowd funds its new solar projects in less than 24 hours}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investing in solar projects had previously been limited to accredited investors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomkonrad/2013/01/08/new-ways-to-invest-in-solar-like-buffett/|title= New Ways to Invest in Solar Like Buffett | work=Forbes | first=Tom|last=Konrad|date=2013-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a small number of willing banks.

Over the last three years publicly traded alternative energy companies have been very volatile, with some 2007 returns in excess of 100%, some 2008 returns down 90% or more, and peak-to-trough returns in 2009 again over 100%.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}  In general there are three sub-segments of "alternative" energy investment:  solar energy, wind energy and hybrid electric vehicles. Alternative energy sources which are renewable and have lower carbon emissions than fossil fuels are hydropower, wind energy, solar energy, geothermal energy, and bio fuels. Each of these four segments involve very different technologies and investment concerns.

For example, photovoltaic solar energy is based on semiconductor processing and accordingly, benefits from steep cost reductions similar to those realized in the microprocessor industry (i.e., driven by larger scale, higher module efficiency, and improving processing technologies). PV solar energy is perhaps the only energy technology whose electricity generation cost could be reduced by half or more over the next five years. Better and more efficient manufacturing process and new technology such as advanced thin film solar cell is a good example of that helps to reduce industry cost.&lt;ref&gt;http://electronicdesign.com/article/power/is-solar-energy-really-ready-to-rumble-19153.aspx{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The economics of solar PV electricity are highly dependent on silicon pricing and even companies whose technologies are based on other materials (e.g., First Solar) are impacted by the balance of supply and demand in the silicon market.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}  In addition, because some companies sell completed solar cells on the open market (e.g., Q-Cells), this creates a low barrier to entry for companies that want to manufacture solar modules, which in turn can create an irrational pricing environment.

In contrast, because wind power has been harnessed for over 100 years, its underlying technology is relatively stable.  Its economics are largely determined by siting (e.g., how hard the wind blows and the grid investment requirements) and the prices of steel (the largest component of a wind turbine) and select composites (used for the blades).  Because current wind turbines are often in excess of 100 meters high, logistics and a global manufacturing platform are major sources of competitive advantage.  These issues and others were explored in a research report by Sanford Bernstein.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Alternative energy in transportation===
Due to steadily rising gas prices in 2008 with the US national average price per gallon of regular unleaded gas rising above $4.00 at one point,&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/2008/07/02/news/economy/gas/?postversion=2008070206 Gas Prices post third straight record, CNN Money]&lt;/ref&gt; there has been a steady movement towards developing higher fuel efficiency and more [[alternative fuel vehicle]]s for consumers. In response, many smaller companies have rapidly increased research and development into radically different ways of powering consumer vehicles. [[Hybrid electric vehicle|Hybrid]] and [[battery electric vehicle]]s are commercially available and are gaining wider industry and consumer acceptance worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

For example, Nissan USA introduced the world's first mass-production electric vehicle, the [[Nissan Leaf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nissanusa.com/leaf-electric-car/index |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-12-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111213055132/http://www.nissanusa.com/leaf-electric-car/index#/leaf-electric-car/index |archive-date=2011-12-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A plug-in hybrid car, the [[Chevrolet Volt]] also has been produced, using an electric motor to drive the wheels, and a small four-cylinder engine to generate additional electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.chevrolet.com/volt-electric-car.html|title=  Transform Your Drive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Making alternative energy mainstream==
Before alternative energy becomes mainstream there are a few crucial obstacles that it must overcome. First there must be increased understanding of how alternative energies are beneficial; secondly the availability components for these systems must increase; and lastly the pay-back period must be decreased.

For example, [[electric vehicle]]s (EV) and [[Plug-in hybrid|plug-in hybrid electric vehicle]]s (PHEV) are on the rise. The continue adoption of these vehicles depend on investment in public charging infrastructure, as well as implementing much more alternative energy for future transportation.&lt;ref&gt;http://energy.sia-partners.com/20160927/public-charging-infrastructures-essential-mass-adoption-electric-vehicles&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

There are numerous organizations within the academic, federal, and commercial sectors conducting large scale advanced research in the field of alternative energy. This research spans several areas of focus across the alternative energy spectrum. Most of the research is targeted at improving efficiency and increasing overall energy yields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Increasing the energy yield of generation from new and renewable energy sources | journal = Renewable Energy | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | year = 2007 | pages = 37–62 | author = S.C.E. Jupe | author2 = A. Michiorri | author3 = P.C. Taylor | doi=10.5772/7379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, multiple federally supported research organizations have focused on alternative energy in recent years. Two of the most prominent of these labs are [[Sandia National Laboratories]] and the [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] (NREL), both of which are funded by the [[United States Department of Energy]] and supported by various corporate partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://share.sandia.gov/news/resources/news_releases/redmesa/|title=Defense-scale supercomputing comes to alternative energy research|accessdate=2012-04-16|publisher=[[Sandia National Laboratories]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sandia has a total budget of $2.4 billion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nnsa.energy.gov/sites/default/files/nnsa/inlinefiles/SNL%20Factsheet.pdf|title=Sandia National Laboratories|accessdate=2012-04-16|publisher=[[Sandia National Laboratories]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020170422/http://nnsa.energy.gov/sites/default/files/nnsa/inlinefiles/SNL%20Factsheet.pdf|archive-date=2011-10-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while NREL has a budget of $375 million.&lt;ref&gt;*Chakrabarty, Gargi, April 16th, 2009. "Stimulus leaves NREL in cold" ''Denver Post"&lt;/ref&gt;

With the increasing consumption levels of energy, it is projected that the levels would increase by 21% in 2030.&lt;ref&gt;International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). (2016). Renewable Energy Benefits: Measuring the Economics. Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of the renewables was relatively cheaper at $2.5m/MW as compared to the non-renewables &amp; 2.7m/MW.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, M.Z. Delucch, M.A. Bauer, Z.A. (2017, April 7). 100% Clean and Renewable Wind, Water, and Sunlight (WWS) All-Sector Energy Roadmaps for 139 Countries of the World. Atmosphere/Energy Program, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Stanford University. pg 1-12
&lt;/ref&gt; Evidently, the use of renewable energy is a cost effective method of obtaining energy. Additionally, their use also dispenses with the trade-off that has existed between environmental conservation and economic growth.

=== Mechanical energy ===
Mechanical energy associated with human activities such as blood circulation, respiration, walking, typing and running, is ubiquitous but usually wasted. It has attracted tremendous attention from researchers around the globe to find methods to scavenge such mechanical energies. The best solution currently is to use piezoelectric materials, which can generate flow of electrons when deformed. Various devices using piezoelectric materials have been built to scavenge mechanical energy. Considering that the piezoelectric constant of the material plays a critical role in the overall performance of a piezoelectric device, one critical research direction to improve device efficiency is to find new material of large piezoelectric response. Lead Magnesium Niobate-Lead Titanate (PMN-PT) is a next-generation piezoelectric material with super high piezoelectric constant when ideal composition and orientation are obtained. In 2012, PMN-PT Nanowires with a very high piezoelectric constant were fabricated by a hydro-thermal approach&lt;sup&gt;[[Nanogenerator|[14]]]&lt;/sup&gt; and then assembled into an energy-harvesting device&lt;sup&gt;[[Nanogenerator|[15]]]&lt;/sup&gt;. The record-high piezoelectric constant was further improved by the fabrication of a single-crystal PMN-PT nanobelt,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wu|first=Fan|last2=Cai|first2=Wei|last3=Yeh|first3=Yao-Wen|last4=Xu|first4=Shiyou|last5=Yao|first5=Nan|date=2016-03-01|title=Energy scavenging based on a single-crystal PMN-PT nanobelt|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep22513|journal=Scientific Reports|language=en|volume=6|doi=10.1038/srep22513|issn=2045-2322|pmc=4772540|pmid=26928788|pages=22513|bibcode=2016NatSR...622513W}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was then used as the essential building block for a piezoelectric nanogenerator.

===Solar===
{{Main|Solar energy}}
[[File:Solar One Power Plant 1993 California.jpg|thumb]]
[[Solar energy]] can be used for [[Solar thermal energy|heating]], [[Solar air conditioning|cooling]] or electrical power generation using the sun.

Solar heat has long been employed in [[Passive solar building design|passively]] and [[Active solar heating|actively]] heated buildings, as well as district heating systems. Examples of the latter are the [[Drake Landing Solar Community]] is Alberta, Canada, and numerous district systems in Denmark&lt;ref&gt;Holm L. (2012).

Presentation. European Sustainable Energy Week, Brussels. 18–22 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, there are two programs for the application of solar heat: the Solar District Heating (SDH)&lt;ref&gt;Solar District Heating (SDH) platform [http://www.solar-district-heating.eu website]. Europe.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[International Energy Agency]]'s Solar Heating and Cooling (SHC) program.&lt;ref&gt;Solar Heating and Cooling programme, of the International Energy Agency. [http://www.iea-shc.org website].&lt;/ref&gt;

The obstacles preventing the large-scale implementation of solar powered energy generation is the inefficiency of current solar technology and the cost. Currently, photovoltaic (PV) panels only have the ability to convert around 16% of the sunlight that hits them into electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dspace.bracu.ac.bd/bitstream/handle/10361/732/Solar%20Photovaltic%20Cell%20application.pdf?sequence=1|title=Improvement of efficiency for solar photovoltaic cell application|accessdate=2012-04-16|publisher=BRAC University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both [[Sandia National Laboratories]] and the [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] (NREL), have heavily funded solar research programs. The NREL solar program has a budget of around $75 million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_12151611|title= Stimulus leaves NREL in cold|accessdate=2012-04-16|publisher=Denver Post|first=Gargi|last=Chakrabarty}}&lt;/ref&gt; and develops research projects in the areas of [[photovoltaic]] (PV) technology, solar thermal energy, and solar radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrel.gov/solar/|title=Solar Research|accessdate=2012-04-16|publisher=NREL}}&lt;/ref&gt; The budget for Sandia's solar division is unknown, however it accounts for a significant percentage of the laboratory's $2.4 billion budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energy.sandia.gov/?page_id=2727 |title=Photovoltaics|accessdate=2012-04-16|publisher=Sandia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several academic programs have focused on solar research in recent years. The Solar Energy Research Center (SERC) at [[University of North Carolina]] (UNC) has the sole purpose of developing a cost-effective solar technology. In 2008, researchers at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) developed a method to store solar energy by using it to produce hydrogen fuel from water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2008/oxygen-0731.html |title='Major discovery' from MIT primed to unleash solar revolution |accessdate=2012-04-17|publisher=MIT News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such research is targeted at addressing the obstacle that solar development faces of storing energy for use during nighttime hours when the sun is not shining.

In February 2012, North Carolina-based Semprius Inc., a solar development company backed by German corporation [[Siemens]], announced that they had developed the world's most efficient solar panel. The company claims that the prototype converts 33.9% of the sunlight that hits it to electricity, more than double the previous high-end conversion rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smartplanet.com/blog/intelligent-energy/breakthrough-worlds-most-efficient-solar-panel/12800 |title=Breakthrough: World's most efficient solar panel|accessdate=2012-04-17|publisher=SmartPlanet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wind===

{{Main|Wind power}}

Wind energy research dates back several decades to the 1970s when [[NASA]] developed an analytical model to predict wind turbine power generation during high winds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/vision/earth/technologies/wind_turbines.html |title=Wind energy research reaps rewards|accessdate=2012-04-17|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, both [[Sandia National Laboratories]] and [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] have programs dedicated to wind research. Sandia's laboratory focuses on the advancement of materials, aerodynamics, and sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energy.sandia.gov/?page_id=344 |title=Wind energy |accessdate=2012-04-17|publisher=Sandia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NREL wind projects are centered on improving wind plant power production, reducing their capital costs, and making wind energy more cost effective overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nrel.gov/wind |title=Wind research|accessdate=2012-04-17|publisher=NREL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Field Laboratory for Optimized Wind Energy (FLOWE) at [[Caltech]] was established to research alternative approaches to wind energy farming technology practices that have the potential to reduce the cost, size, and environmental impact of wind energy production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dabiri.caltech.edu/publications/FLOWE_APSDFD_Nov2011.pdf|title=Wind resource evaluation at the Caltech Field Laboratory for Optimized Wind Energy (FLOWE)|accessdate=2012-04-17|publisher=Caltech|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111216030309/http://dabiri.caltech.edu/publications/FLOWE_APSDFD_Nov2011.pdf|archive-date=2011-12-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Renewable energies such as wind, solar, biomass and geothermal combined, supplied 1.3% of global final energy consumption in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/REN12-GSR2015_Onlinebook_low1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721013559/http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/REN12-GSR2015_Onlinebook_low1.pdf |archivedate=2015-07-21 }} page 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Biomass can be regarded as "[[Biomaterial|biological material]]"&lt;ref&gt;In many context the term "biomaterial" refers specifically to the body-friendly materials in medical implantation, etc.; here it is used literally.&lt;/ref&gt; derived from living, or recently living organisms. It most often refers to plants or plant-derived materials which are specifically called [[lignocellulosic biomass]].&lt;ref name="Biomass Energy Center"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061008081905/http://www.biomassenergycentre.org.uk/portal/page?_pageid=76,15049&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL Biomass Energy Center]. Biomassenergycentre.org.uk. Retrieved on 28 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; As an energy source, biomass can either be used directly via combustion to produce heat, or indirectly after converting it to various forms of [[biofuel]]. Conversion of biomass to biofuel can be achieved by different methods which are broadly classified into: ''thermal'', ''chemical'', and ''biochemical'' methods. Wood remains the largest biomass energy source today;&lt;ref name="online.wsj.com"&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303740704577524822063133842] Retrieved on 12 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; examples include forest residues (such as dead trees, branches and [[tree stump]]s), yard clippings, wood chips and even [[municipal solid waste]]. In the second sense, biomass includes plant or animal matter that can be converted into fibers or other industrial [[Chemical industry|chemicals]], including [[biofuel]]s. Industrial biomass can be grown from numerous types of plants, including [[miscanthus]], [[switchgrass]], [[hemp]], [[maize|corn]], [[Populus|poplar]], [[willow]], [[sorghum]], [[sugarcane]], [[bamboo]],&lt;ref&gt;

Biomass, biogas and biofuels are burned to produce heat/power and in doing so harm the environment. Pollutants such as sulphurous oxides (SO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;), nitrous oxides (NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;), and particulate matter (PM) are produced from this combustion. The World Health Organisation estimates that 7 million premature deaths are caused each year by air pollution,&lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2014/air-pollution/en/&lt;/ref&gt; and biomass combustion is a major contributor of it.&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs313/en/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160104165807/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs313/en/ |archivedate=2016-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs292/en/&lt;/ref&gt; The use of biomas is carbon neutral over time, but is otherwise similar to burning fossil fuels.

===Ethanol biofuels===

{{Main|Ethanol biofuels}}

As the primary source of biofuels in North America, many organizations are conducting research in the area of [[ethanol]] production. On the Federal level, the [[USDA]] conducts a large amount of research regarding ethanol production in the United States. Much of this research is targeted toward the effect of ethanol production on domestic food markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=American Coalition for Ethanol |url=http://www.ethanol.org/pdf/contentmgmt/USDA_DOE_biofuels_letter_61208.pdf |title=Responses to Questions from Senator Bingaman |publisher=American Coalition for Ethanol |date=2008-06-02 |accessdate=2012-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004113944/http://ethanol.org/pdf/contentmgmt/USDA_DOE_biofuels_letter_61208.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] has conducted various ethanol research projects, mainly in the area of [[cellulosic ethanol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=National Renewable Energy Laboratory |url=http://www.nrel.gov/biomass/pdfs/40742.pdf |title=Research Advantages: Cellulosic Ethanol |publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory |date=2007-03-02 |accessdate=2012-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125101249/http://www.nrel.gov/biomass/pdfs/40742.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cellulosic ethanol]] has many benefits over traditional corn based-ethanol. It does not take away or directly conflict with the food supply because it is produced from wood, grasses, or non-edible parts of plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Net energy of cellulosic ethanol from switchgrass | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 105 | issue = 2 | date = 2008 | pages = 464–469 | author = M.R.

===Other biofuels===

{{Main|Biofuel}}

From 1978 to 1996, the [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] experimented with using algae as a biofuels source in the "[[Aquatic Species Program]]."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nrel.gov/docs/legosti/fy98/24190.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A self-published article by Michael Briggs, at the [[University of New Hampshire]] Biofuels Group, offers estimates for the realistic replacement of all motor vehicle fuel with biofuels by utilizing algae that have a natural oil content greater than 50%, which Briggs suggests can be grown on algae ponds at wastewater treatment plants.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} This oil-rich algae can then be extracted from the system and processed into biofuels, with the dried remainder further reprocessed to create ethanol.

The production of algae to harvest oil for biofuels has not yet been undertaken on a commercial scale, but feasibility studies have been conducted to arrive at the above yield estimate. In addition to its projected high yield, algaculture— unlike food crop-based biofuels — does not entail a decrease in food production, since it requires neither farmland nor fresh water. Many companies are pursuing algae bio-reactors for various purposes, including scaling up biofuels production to commercial levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.valcent.net/t/news_detailf62c.html?id=36 |title=Valcent Products Inc.

Several groups in various sectors are conducting research on Jatropha curcas, a poisonous shrub-like tree that produces seeds considered by many to be a viable source of biofuels feedstock oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Biology and genetic improvement of Jatropha curcas L.: A review| journal = [[Applied Energy]] | volume = 87 | issue = 3 | date = 2010| pages = 732–742 | author = B.N.

===Geothermal===

{{Main|Geothermal electricity}}

[[Geothermal energy]] is produced by tapping into the heat within the earths crust. It is considered sustainable because that thermal energy is constantly replenished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Geothermal Sustainability| journal = GHC Bulletin | date = 2007| pages = 2–6 | author = L. Ryback}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the science of geothermal energy generation is still young and developing economic viability. Several entities, such as the [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=NREL |url=http://www.nrel.gov/geothermal/ |title=Geothermal Technologies|publisher=NREL | accessdate=2012-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sandia National Laboratories]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sandia|url=http://energy.sandia.gov/index.php?page_id=381|title=Geothermal |publisher=Sandia | accessdate=2012-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; are conducting research toward the goal of establishing a proven science around geothermal energy. The International Centre for Geothermal Research (IGC), a German geosciences research organization, is largely focused on geothermal energy development research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= GFZ Helmholtz Center Potsdam |url=http://www.gfz-potsdam.de/portal/gfz/Struktur/GeoEngineering-Zentren/Internationales+Geothermiezentrum;jsessionid=8F6BF49D51E1BAA8273B58EAEEA40F41|title= International Centre for Geothermal Research |publisher=GFZ Helmholtz Center Potsdam | accessdate=2012-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydrogen===

The generation of alternative energy on the scale needed to replace fossil energy, in an effort to reverse global climate change, is likely to have significant negative environmental impacts. For example, [[biomass energy]] generation would have to increase 7-fold to supply current primary energy demand, and up to 40-fold by 2100 given economic and energy growth projections.&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011). [http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org ''Technofix: Why Technology Won’t Save Us or the Environment''], "Challenge #1: Serious Environmental Impacts of Large-scale Renewable Generation", New Society Publishers, {{ISBN|0865717044}}, pp. 125-133.&lt;/ref&gt; Humans already appropriate 30 to 40% of all photosynthetically fixed carbon worldwide, indicating that expansion of additional biomass harvesting is likely to stress ecosystems, in some cases precipitating collapse and extinction of animal species that have been deprived of vital food sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rojstaczer | first1 = S. | last2 = Sterling | first2 = S.M. | last3 = Moore | first3 = N.J. | date = 2001 | title = Human appropriation of photosynthesis products | journal = Science | volume = 294 | pages = 2549–2552 | doi=10.1126/science.1064375| bibcode = 2001Sci...294.2549R }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vitousek | first1 = P.M. | last2 = Ehrlich | first2 = P.R. | last3 = Ehrlich | first3 = A.H. | last4 = Matson | first4 = P.A. | date = 1986 | title = Human appropriation of the products of photosynthesis | journal = BioScience | volume = 36 | issue = 6| pages = 368–373 | doi=10.2307/1310258}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total amount of energy capture by vegetation in the United States each year is around 58 quads (61.5 EJ), about half of which is already harvested as agricultural crops and forest products. The remaining biomass is needed to maintain ecosystem functions and diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pimentel | first1 = D. | display-authors = etal  | date = 1994 | title = Achieving a secure energy future: environmental and economic issues | journal = Ecological Economics | volume = 9 | pages = 201–219 | doi=10.1016/0921-8009(94)90078-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since annual energy use in the United States is ca. 100 quads, biomass energy could supply only a very small fraction. To supply the current worldwide energy demand solely with biomass would require more than 10% of the Earth's land surface, which is comparable to the area use for all of world agriculture (i.e., ca. 1500 million hectares), indicating that further expansion of biomass energy generation will be difficult without precipitating an ethical conflict, given current world hunger statistics, over growing plants for biofuel versus food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hoffert | first1 = M.I. | display-authors = etal  | date = 2002 | title = Advanced technology paths to global climate change stability: energy for a greenhouse planet | journal = Science | volume = 298 | pages = 981–987 | doi=10.1126/science.1072357 | pmid=12411695| bibcode = 2002Sci...298..981H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nakicenovic, N., A. Gruebler, and A. McDonald (1998). ''Global Energy Perspective'', Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Given environmental concerns (e.g., fish migration, destruction of sensitive aquatic ecosystems, etc.) about building new dams to capture hydroelectric energy, further expansion of conventional [[hydropower in the United States]] is unlikely. Windpower, if deployed on the large scale necessary to substitute fossil energy, is likely to face public resistance. If 100% of U.S. energy demand were to be supplied by wind power, about 80 million hectares (i.e., more than 40% of all available farmland in the United States) would have to be covered with wind turbines (50m hub height and 250 to 500 m apart).&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, D.L., L.L. Wendell, and G.L. Gower (1992), "Wind energy potential in the United States considering environmental and land use exclusions", In: Proceedings of the Biennial Congress of the International Solar Energy Society – Solar World Congress in Denver, Colorado, edited by M.E. Ardan, S.M.A. Burley, and M. Coleman, Pergamon, Oxford, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore not surprising that the major [[environmental impact of wind power]] is related to land use and less to wildlife (birds, bats, etc.) mortality. Unless only a relatively small fraction of electricity is generated by wind turbines in remote locations, it is unlikely that the public will tolerate large windfarms given concerns about blade noise and aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, D., (1997). ''Energy, Society, and Environment – Technology for a Sustainable Future'', Chapter 11, "Case Study: Public Reaction of UK Windfarms", Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wuestenhagen | first1 = R. | last2 = Welsink | first2 = M. | last3 = Buerer | first3 = M.J. | date = 2007 | title = Social acceptance of renewable energy innovations – an introduction to the concept | journal = Energy Policy | volume = 35 | pages = 2683–2691 | doi = 10.1016/j.enpol.2006.12.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biofuels are different from fossil fuels in regard to net greenhouse gases but are similar to fossil fuels in that biofuels contribute to [[air pollution]]. Burning produces airborne carbon [[particulate]]s, [[carbon monoxide]] and [[nitrous oxide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/indoorair/interventions/antiguamod21.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disadvantages==
{{original research|date=March 2017}}
Renewable alternative forms of energy have faced opposition from multiple groups, including conservatives and liberals. Around twelve states have passed proposals written to inhibit the alternative energy movement. Kansas lawmakers struck down a bill to phase out renewable energy mandates but face the possibility of the bill reappearing.&lt;ref name="A Pushback on Green Power"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cardwell|first1=Diane|title=A Pushback on Green Power|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/29/business/energy-environment/a-pushback-on-green-power.html?_r=0|website=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=February 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opposition cites the potentially high cost of branching out to these alternatives in order to support the continuation and reliance on fossil fuels. Ohio's mandate to phase in alternative energy faces opposition who believe higher electricity prices will result, while supporters fear the loss of economic development and jobs that alternative energy could bring.&lt;ref name="A Pushback on Green Power"/&gt;

With nuclear meltdowns in Chernobyl and Fukushima, nuclear power presents a constant danger and is more unlikely to be a popular alternative source.  The costs of maintaining nuclear facilities, the potential risk of meltdowns, and the cost of cleaning up meltdowns are cited as reasons behind the movement away from the use of nuclear energy.  In some countries nuclear power plants cannot compete with fossil fuels currently due to the latter's lower price and availability. Nuclear power plants also face competition from the increasing renewable energy subsidies.&lt;ref name="The New York Times"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Porter|first1=Eduardo|title=How Renewable Energy is Blowing Climate Change Efforts off Course|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/20/business/energy-environment/how-renewable-energy-is-blowing-climate-change-efforts-off-course.html|website=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solar panels are an icon of the 'green power' movement, however the process of manufacturing the quartz based panels can be detrimental to the environment. Raw quartz (silica) is used to create solar cells must be mined using harsh chemicals that harm the surrounding environment, as well as those working in the mines. Silicosis is a form of lung disease that is caused by the inhalation of crystalline silica dust resulting in nodule lesions in the lungs. The silica must be cultivated into metallurgical-grade silicon, the process requiring a massive amount of energy as the quartz is placed into electric arc furnaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.madehow.com/Volume-6/Silicon.html|title=Silicon|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The metallurgical grade silica must be processed into polysilicon. This process also produces tetrachloride, a toxic substance that, if not disposed of correctly, can be harmful to the surrounding environment. Hydrochloric acid is formed when tetrachloride interacts with water, lowering water and soil pH. Incidents of tetrachloride spills are common in China, as the production of solar panels has shifted from Europe and the United States to Asian countries within the early 2000s. Because of such, the villagers of Gaolong are unable to leave their homes due to air and soil becoming toxic. This was due to Luoyang Zhongui High-Technology Co. repeatedly dumped tetrachloride in a nearby field for almost a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/08/AR2008030802595.html|title=Solar Energy Firms Leave Waste Behind in China|last=Eunjung Cha|first=Ariana|date=March 9, 2008|website=The Washington Post|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ampd Energy''' is a company in the [[energy industry]], which designs and manufactures [[energy storage]] systems (ESS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jlim/2017/03/01/the-hong-kong-startup-that-wants-to-power-asia-with-clean-energy/#39f33bd8674b|title=The Hong Kong Startup That Wants To Power Asia With Clean Energy|last=Lim|first=Jason|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a member of the Incu-Tech Programme, a [[Government of Hong Kong|Hong Kong Government]] and [[Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation|HK Science and Technology Park]] initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hkstp.org/hkstp_web/en/corporate-news-science-park-company-news/company-newsletter/jan-2017/ampds-launch|title=Incubatee Ampd Energy’s green energy storage solution - a boon for developing countries|last=|first=|date=|website=HK Science and Technology Park|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their mission is to provide clean, affordable and stable electricity to people and enterprises that lack access to a reliable electric supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ampd.energy/company/|title=Company-Ampd Energy|work=Ampd|access-date=2017-06-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Ampd was founded in December 2014. Its founders, Brandon Ng and Luca Valente created an [[Electric motorcycles and scooters|electric motorcycle]] company during a [[Power outage|blackout]] in the city, they reasoned that the [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] of their motorcycles could be redesigned to power buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=A Eureka moment for a greater purpose|url=https://issuu.com/imarketinsights/docs/imarket_insights_issue_02_2017|journal=Market Insights|volume=|pages=33–34|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, Ampd Energy was accepted into the Incu-Tech program. As of June 2017, the company has raised a total of $3.7 million in [[seed investment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hongkongbusiness.hk/markets-investing/exclusive/ampd-energy-offers-cutting-edge-energy-storage-companies|title=Ampd Energy offers cutting-edge energy storage for companies|last=|first=|date=|website=Hongkong Business|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-08|quote=Numerous private individuals were eventually won over by the company vision and the first prototype, leading to US$3.7m in Series Seed funding. Series A funding is expected to be completed in Q3-Q4 of 2017.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Product ==
In December 2016, the company launched an [[Energy storage|energy storage system]] called Ampd Silo, which aims to replace [[Lead–acid battery|lead acid battery]], [[Uninterruptible power supply|Uninterruptable Power Supply systems]] (UPSs) and [[diesel generator]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/tech/article/2059602/start-ampd-energy-hopes-oust-noisy-dirty-diesel-backup-generators|title=Start-up hopes to replace diesel generators|work=South China Morning Post|access-date=2017-06-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/hkedition/2016-12/29/content_27808921.htm|title=Blackouts - the answer's in the tank|last=李松|first=|date=|website=www.chinadaily.com.cn|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; primarily in countries affected by frequent blackouts.

Unlike many related companies such as [[Tesla Powerwall|Tesla]] and [[Sonnen GmbH|Sonnen]], The Ampd Silo is primarily aimed at on-grid energy storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jlim/2017/03/01/the-hong-kong-startup-that-wants-to-power-asia-with-clean-energy/2/#221bdcab3277|title=The Hong Kong Startup That Wants To Power Asia With Clean Energy|last=Lim|first=Jason|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ampd Silo uses 1,792 rechargeable [[Lithium-ion battery|lithium-ion]] batteries cells, with each Ampd Silo offering a storage capacity of 16.8 kWh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ampd.energy/product/|title=Product-Ampd Energy|work=Ampd|access-date=2017-06-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ampd Energy has patented novel methods of assembling the cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PG01&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=20170012331.PGNR|title=Published Applications Database Search Results:  in|website=appft1.uspto.gov|access-date=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards and recognition ==
In early 2017, Ampd Silo received the ''[[Consumer Electronics Show|CES2017]] Innovation Award Honoree'' in the "Tech For a Better World" category.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ces.tech/Events-Programs/Innovation-Awards/honorees/InnovationAwards/2017/Tech-For-A-Better-World/Ampd-Silo.aspx|title=Innovation Awards Honorees - Ampd Silo|last=|first=|date=|website=CES.tech|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was also shortlisted as one of the finalists in Engadgets best CES 2017 in the start-up category.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2017/01/06/introducing-the-best-of-ces-2017-finalists/|title=Introducing the Best of CES 2017 finalists!|website=Engadget|access-date=2017-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017, co-founder and [[Chief executive officer|CEO]], Brandon Ng, was named as a ''[[Forbes]] Asia 30 Under 30 honouree'' in the "Industry, Manufacturing &amp; Energy" category.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/pictures/fmhd45gdhe/brandon-ng-29/#21c84768d2b1|title=Brandon Ng, 29 - pg.21|last=Wang|first=Yue|website=Forbes|access-date=2017-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Banni Grasslands Reserve''' or '''Banni grasslands''' form a belt of [[arid]] [[grassland]] [[ecosystem]] on the outer southern edge of the [[desert]] of the marshy [[Salt pan (geology)|salt flats]] of [[Rann of Kutch]] in [[Kutch District]], [[Gujarat State]], India. They are known for rich [[wildlife]] and [[biodiversity]] and are spread across an area of 3,847&amp;nbsp;square kilometres. They are currently legally protected under the status as a [[Reserved forests and protected forests of India|protected or reserve forest in India]]. Though declared a [[protected forest]] more than half a century ago Gujarat state's forest department has recently proposed a special plan to restore and manage this ecosystem in the most efficient way.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/centre-approves-working-plan-for-banni-grassland/531693/ Centre approves working plan for Banni grassland]; by Shubhlakshmi Shukla; 22 October 2009; The Indian Express Newspaper&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/state-takes-54-years-to-prepare-working-plan-for-banni-grasslands/519540/0 State takes 54&amp;nbsp;years to prepare working plan for Banni grasslands]; by Shubhlakshmi Shukla; 21 September 2009; The Indian Express Newspaper&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wildlife Institute of India]] (WII) has identified this grassland reserve as one of the last remaining habitats of the [[cheetah]] in India and a possible [[reintroduction]] site for the [[species]].&lt;ref name="Workshop on cheetah relocation begins, views differ; Times of India"/&gt;

The word ‘Banni’ comes from [[Hindi]] word ‘banai’, meaning made. The land here was formed from the [[sediments]] that were deposited by the [[Indus]] and other rivers over thousands of years. Old villagers from this region say that before the [[1819 Rann of Kutch earthquake]], the river Indus flowed right through banni and the local farmers reaped a rich harvest of crops like red rice and sindhi chookha etc., red rice was the staple diet of the people of the region and it was even recommended by medical practitioners as a 'light diet' for ailing people. However, since the earthquake of 1819 the river Indus changed its course and now flows through [[Sindh]] in neighbouring country of [[Pakistan]] effectively turning this entire region arid.&lt;ref name="70% of cattle-breeders desert Banni"&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2002-02-14/ahmedabad/27141912_1_banni-kutch-breeders 70% of cattle-breeders desert Banni]; by Narandas Thacker, TNN, 14 February 2002; The Times of India&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lost and forgotten: grasslands and pastoralists of Gujarat"&gt;[http://www.india-seminar.com/2006/564/564_c_bharwada_&amp;_v_mahajan.htm Lost and forgotten: grasslands and pastoralists of Gujarat]; by CHARUL BHARWADA and VINAY MAHAJAN; THE FORSAKEN DRYLANDS; a symposium on some of India'smost invisible people; SEMINAR; NEW DELHI; 2006; NUMB 564, pages 35–39; {{ISSN|0037-1947}}.

Banni grassland is peculiar to the [[Rann of Kutch]], it has some forty [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] speaking [[Maldhari]] (cattle breeders) hamlets, home to the [[Halaypotra]], [[Hingora]], [[Hingorja]], [[Jats of Kutch|Jat]] and [[Mutwa]] tribes

Since then, the actual transfer of the land from the Revenue department to the Forest department has not been completed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expressindia.com/news/ie/daily/19970710/19150293.html Gujarat govt flouts Forest Act, SC fiat]; by D V Maheshwari; 10 July 1997; Indian Express Newspaper, [http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2005-07-17/ahmedabad/27862345_1_banni-grasslands-forest The death knell sounded for Banni]; Paul John, TNN, 17 July 2005; Times of India&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vegetation==
[[File:Gujarat_Geological_map.jpg|thumb|The Banni region was created by the 1819 earthquake]]
Vegetation in Banni is sparse and highly dependent on year-to-year variations in rainfall.
Banni is dominated by low-growing forbs and graminoids, many of which are halophiles (salt tolerant), as well scatted tree cover and scrub. The tree cover is primarily composed of ''Salvadora'' spp. and the invasive ''Prosopis juliflora''. Dominant species include ''[[Cressa cretica]]'', ''Cyperus'' spp., grasses in the genera ''[[Sporobolus]]'', ''[[Dichanthium]]'', and ''[[Aristida]]''.

==Wildlife==
The grasslands are home to [[mammal]]s such as the [[nilgai]] (''Boselaphus tragocamelus''), [[chinkara]] (''Gazella bennettii''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-05-06/rajkot/28154402_1_rl-meena-kutch-kala-dungar Kutch to have chinkara conservation centre]; 6 May 2009; Times of India&lt;/ref&gt; [[blackbuck]] (''Antilope cervicapra''), [[wild boar]] (''Sus scrofa''), [[golden jackal]] (''Canis aureus''), [[Indian hare]] (''Lepus nigricollis''), [[Indian wolf]] (''Canis lupus pallipes''), [[caracal]] (''Caracal caracal''), [[Asiatic wildcat]] (''Felis silvestris ornata'') and [[red fox|desert fox]] (''Vulpes vulpes pusilla'') etc. among others. The last [[Indian wild ass]] (''Equus hemionus khur'') population, which had become confined to nearby Little [[Rann of Kutch]], has been increasing in numbers since 1976 and has recently started spilling over into adjoining areas including Greater Rann of Kutch, Banni and the adjoining villages of the neighbouring Indian state of [[Rajasthan]].&lt;ref name="Bounties of a bleak landscape - The Little Rann of Kutch is hot, dry and salty, but it has rich biodiversity"&gt;[http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2308/stories/20060505000406600.htm Bounties of a bleak landscape – The Little Rann of Kutch is hot, dry and salty, but it has rich biodiversity.] by DIONNE BUNSHA; Volume 23 – Issue 08 :: 22 Apr – 5 May 2006; Frontline Magazine; India's National Magazine from the publishers of THE HINDU&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wild asses population rises by 4% (2009)"&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-04-11/ahmedabad/28050560_1_nal-sarovar-first-census-wild-asses Wild asses population rises by 4% (2009)];TNN; 11 April 2009; Times of India&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wild Ass sighted in Rajasthan villages along Gujarat"&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2009/09/13/stories/2009091354830700.htm Wild Ass sighted in Rajasthan villages along Gujarat]; by Sunny Sebastian; 13 September 2009; The Hindu, India's National Newspaper&lt;/ref&gt;

Banni grasslands also have a rich diversity of [[Bird|avifauna]], [[Herpetology|herpatofauna]] and [[invertebrate]]s. During good rainfall years the seasonal water bodies of Banni form important staging grounds for thousands of [[flamingo]]s, migratory [[Crane (bird)|cranes]] and also support large numbers of over 150 species of [[Bird migration|migratory]] and resident birds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalrestorationnetwork.org/uploads/files/CaseStudyAttachments/230_gujarat-grasslands.pdf Ecorestoration of Banni Grassland; First Annual Technical Report; December, 1998; Published by Gujarat Ecology Commission; GERI Campus, Race Course Road, Vadodara – 390 007. INDIA]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reintroduction of cheetah===
{{ main|Cheetah reintroduction in India}}
''Banni Grasslands Reserve'' and ''[[Narayan Sarovar Sanctuary]]'', both in [[Kutch]], have been classified by [[Wildlife Institute of India]] (WII) as the last remaining habitats of the [[cheetah]] (''Acinonyx jubatus'') in India and are proposed as some of the possible sites for the [[reintroduction]] of the [[species]] in India.&lt;ref name="Workshop on cheetah relocation begins, views differ; Times of India"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-10-03/ahmedabad/28084202_1_cheetahs-sq-km-semi-wild-enclosures Banni Grassland possible home for cheetahs]; Himanshu Kaushik, TNN, 3 October 2009; Times of India&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-09-12/ahmedabad/28063993_1_cheetahs-yadvendradev-jhala-gajner Cheetahs on their way to Gujarat?] 12 September 2009; Times of India&lt;/ref&gt; [[Asiatic cheetah]] (''Acinonyx jubatus venaticus'') that used to occur here are now locally [[extinct]] in India and elsewhere, except a very small [[critically endangered]] and [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmented]] population of last few, estimated to be below 100, thought to be surviving only in the [[Dasht-e Kavir|central desert]] of [[Iran]]. Thus cheetah experts from around the world have advised India to import and introduce the cheetah from Africa as genetically it is identical to the ones found is Asia, as latest genetic studies have revealed that the Asian population had separated from the African relatively recently only 5000&amp;nbsp;years ago which is not enough for a subspecies level differentiation.&lt;ref name="Workshop on cheetah relocation begins, views differ; Times of India"&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-09-09/flora-fauna/28074792_1_cheetah-m-k-ranjitsinh-tiger-reserves Workshop on cheetah relocation begins, views differ]; PTI, 9 September 2009; The Times of India&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/india-to-get-cheetahs-from-namibia/487160/ India to get cheetahs from Namibia]; by Neha Sinha; 9 July 2009; 2 Page article online; Indian Express Newspaper&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sify.com/news/cheetah-re-introduction-plan-under-discussion-news-national-jjjkkbhjfbj.html Cheetah re-introduction plan under discussion]; IANS; 2009-09-09; Sify News.

==Seasonal wetlands and abundance of waterbirds==
[[File:Caprimulgus mahrattensis.JPG|thumb|Caprimulgus mahrattensis]]
[[Monsoon]] rains each year form several [[marsh]]y [[wetland]]s which dot the Banni grasslands and the areas adjacent to it, all being [[ephemeral]] or seasonal in nature. Some better-known examples are: Vekario-Dhand, Kheerjog, Vinzar varo Thathh, Hodko Thathh, Servo-Dhand, Bhagadio Thathh, Kar near Kirro, Kunjevari Thathh, Hanjtal, and [[Chari-Dhand Wetland Conservation Reserve|Chari-Dhand]] – the biggest in size among all of them. In the local [[Kutchi language|Kutchhi]]-[[Sindhi language]] there are four terms used for wetlands in Banni and across the [[International border|border]] in Pakistan, they are Kar (smallest), Chhachh (bigger than Kar), Thathh (bigger than Chhach) and Dhand (the biggest of the wetlands). The area of each of these seasonal freshwater wetlands during any given year depends upon the amount of rainfall received during that year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wetlandwithketantatu.com/2008/12/article.html Chhari-Dhand Conservation Reserve] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160815053113/http://www.wetlandwithketantatu.com/2008/12/article.html |date=15 August 2016 }}; Jugal Kishore Tiwari; Wetlands Forever website&lt;/ref&gt;

These wetlands are located on the [[flyway]] of [[Palaearctic ecozone|palaearctic]] [[bird migration|migratory birds]] and play a very important role as foraging, roosting, resting and staging grounds for millions of [[wader]]s, [[waterfowl]], [[crane (bird)|cranes]] and other feathered migrants that visit the area from August and staying until March every year. Thousands of [[flamingo]]s in their breeding plumage, [[common crane]]s (''Grus grus'') and other wetland birds including hundreds of [[painted stork]]s (''Mycteria leucocephala'') and [[Eurasian spoonbill]]s (''Platalea leucorodia'') among others can be spotted in the larger of these seasonal wetlands of the Banni.

One of the largest of these seasonal wetlands in the Banni is [[Chari-Dhand Wetland Conservation Reserve]] which has been accorded special protected status as a protected or reserve forest to conserve its [[wildlife]] and visiting migratory birds.&lt;ref name="(Gujarat) State thinks green, banks on eco-tourism"&gt;[http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/state-thinks-green-banks-on-ecotourism/353282/ (Gujarat) State thinks green, banks on eco-tourism; by DEBARATI BASU, Shubhlakshmi Shukla; 26 Aug 2008; Indian Express Newspaper]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Migratory birds come flocking as Chari-Dhand gains ‘wet’"&gt;[http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/migratory-birds-come-flocking-as-charidhand-gains-wet/351919/ Migratory birds come flocking as Chari-Dhand gains ‘wet’; by D V MAHESHWARI; 22 Aug 2008; Indian Express Newspaper]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bhuj wetland to be turned into a tourist hot spot"&gt;[http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/bhuj-wetland-to-be-turned-into-a-tourist-hot-spot/326671/ Bhuj wetland to be turned into a tourist hot spot; by D V MAHESHWARI; 24 Jun 2008; Indian Express Newspaper]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chari-Dhand wetland yet to get conservation reserve tag"&gt;[http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/charidhand-wetland-yet-to-get-conservation-reserve-tag/322938/ Chari-Dhand wetland yet to get conservation reserve tag; by D V MAHESHWARI; 15 Jun 2008; Indian Express Newspaper]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overgrazing, recurring droughts and salinity ingress==
The Banni grasslands are under pressure due to man-made factors which are [[overgrazing]], [[Invasive species|invasion]] by ''[[Prosopis juliflora]]'', an exotic thorny tree, and natural factors which are recurring droughts and salinity ingress.&lt;ref name="Banni Grasslands; Kutch Dist., Gujarat - Water Harvesting: Addressing the problem of drinking water"&gt;[http://www.narmada.org/ALTERNATIVES/banni/alt-banni.html Banni Grasslands; Kutch Dist., Gujarat – A complex rainwater harvesting system developed over centuries by the Maldharis of Banni grasslands is threatened by natural factors and man made interventions.] Water Harvesting: Addressing the problem of drinking water; The Friends of River Narmada ([http://www.narmada.org/ALTERNATIVES/water.harvesting.html])&lt;/ref&gt;

The main sources of income of [[Maldhari]]s pastoralist communities such as the [[Halaypotra]], [[Hingora]], [[Hingorja]], [[Jats of Kutch|Jat]], [[Ker (tribe)|Ker]], and [[Mutwa]] who live here with their livestock are sale of high quality [[ghee]], milk, [[wool]], animals and handicrafts. Due to several reasons, the traditional occupational pattern is changing from livestock breeding to livestock grazing.&lt;ref name="Banni Grasslands; Kutch Dist., Gujarat - Water Harvesting: Addressing the problem of drinking water"/&gt;

The climate is [[arid]] with an average rainfall of only 315&amp;nbsp;mm per year between June and September. The number of days during which rain falls in a year usually does not exceed 4 or 5. Banni has almost no rivers or natural streams however, about 100 rivers and rivulets flowing northwards from the Kutch mainland drain into the grasslands of Banni along its southern boundary. This area near the boundary gets flooded during the rainy season mainly by the water brought by these rivers and local rainfall. It is this annual [[flooding]] and the old [[silt]] deposits that formed Banni, which were [[Fluvial|deposited]] here when the [[Indus River]] used to flow through the region until it changed its course due to the 1819 earthquake.&lt;ref name="70% of cattle-breeders desert Banni"/&gt; This gave rise to what is often called Asia's finest natural grasslands.&lt;ref name="Banni Grasslands; Kutch Dist., Gujarat - Water Harvesting: Addressing the problem of drinking water"/&gt;

This entire region of Kutch, Gujarat is however drought prone due to erratic monsoons with cattle breeding pastoralist tribes ([[Maldharis]]) living here having to move out with their livestock as the region turns into a desert in bad rainfall years.&lt;ref name="70% of cattle-breeders desert Banni"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bounties of a bleak landscape - The Little Rann of Kutch is hot, dry and salty, but it has rich biodiversity"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1710/17101200.htm Gujarat's thirst; Distress migration of people and large-scale death of livestock have peaked.

==Invasive ganda bawal tree==
''[[Prosopis juliflora]]'', a [[Introduced species|non-native]], thorny, shrubby species of [[mesquite]] locally known as ganda bawal, was planted in the area to help the Gujarat State forest department fight salinity ingress and barrenness in the Banni region of Kutch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2004-12-04/ahmedabad/27168062_1_gando-baval-tree-wild-weed 'Gando baval' overtakes 'neem' as state's (Gujarat's) no. 1 tree]; TNN, 4 December 2004, Times of India&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1173387.cms The death knell sounded for Banni]; Paul John, TNN, 17 July 2005; Times of India&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-05-22/ahmedabad/28154842_1_gando-baval-invasive-alien-species-climate-change Gando Baval an invasive alien species' in Gujarat]; TNN, 22 May 2009; Times of India&lt;/ref&gt; A ban was placed on the tree's harvest in the 1980s, at which time it covered less than 10 per cent of the Banni grasslands. However, it quickly became an [[invasive species]], occupying over 40 per cent of the land by the late 1990s. This worried the forest department, as ''P. juliflora'' is known for harming biodiversity and it was clear that it was destroying the grassland ecosystem, so the state government lifted the ban in early 2004, liberalising ''Prosopis'' cutting under Section 32 of the Indian Forest Act. The idea, on paper, had been to make [[charcoal]] from it and thus help improve the economic conditions of the people of Banni.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expressindia.com/news/ie/daily/19981026/29950904.html Govt wakes up to illegal charcoal manufacture]; by Bashir Pathan; 26 October 1998; Indian Express Newspaper&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/gsfdc-scripts-a-turnaround-story-rides-pretty-on-greenbacks/292304/ GSFDC scripts a turnaround story, rides pretty on greenbacks]; by BASHIR PATHAN; 4 April 2008; The Indian Express Newspaper&lt;/ref&gt; This was aimed at containing the brazen spread of the wild weed, the decision however backfired with an equally mindless chopping for profit where often native trees were also cut down under the garb&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/felling-of-gando-bawal-banned-in-kutch/306495/ Felling of Gando Bawal banned in Kutch]; by D V MAHESHWARI; 7 May 2008; Indian Express Newspaper&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in the crucial green cover in the region getting reduced to less than 10 per cent in 2004. In 2008, the Gujarat state government has re-imposed the ban on the cutting of ganda bawal in the Banni region of Kutch and a consensus has been reached on this at a joint meeting of the Forest department and Kutch legislators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/govt-mulls-reimposing-ban-on-ganda-bawal-cutting/298332/ Govt mulls re-imposing ban on Ganda Bawal cutting]; Express news service; 18 April 2008; The Indian Express Newspaper&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/govt-reconsiders-cutting-gando-bawal/301294/ Govt reconsiders cutting Gando Bawal]; by D V MAHESHWARI; 25 April 2008; The Indian Express Newspaper&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/forest-department-no-longer-game-for-felling-gando-bawal/308910/ Forest department no longer game for felling Gando Bawal]; D V MAHESHWARI; 13 May 2008; Indian Express Newspaper&lt;/ref&gt;

Mass cutting of [[Prosopis juliflora|ganda bawal]] trees and the air pollution from charcoal making has unexpectedly also vastly brought down the wild [[honey bee]] populations and has had a disastrous effect on wild bee [[honey]] collection, crop [[pollination]] and [[crop yield]]s in the Kutch region. The number of dwarf bee hives in one square kilometre area has reduced to only 20–25 from the earlier 60–70 colonies in and around the Banni grasslands after the large scale tree felling. Local honey hunters ([[Koli people|Koli]] community) who used to harvest about 300 tonnes of wild honey annually from Kutch after a blank for two years could only collect just 50 tonnes in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mobilepaper.timesofindia.com/mobile.aspx?article=yes&amp;pageid=18&amp;sectid=edid=&amp;edlabel=ETM&amp;mydateHid=06-06-2008&amp;pubname=Economic+Times+-+Mumbai&amp;edname=&amp;articleid=Ar01802&amp;publabel=ET Vanishing bees bring down crop yields in Kutch – The Culprit: Pollution &amp; Rampant Felling Of Mad Weed Caused Disappearance Of Dwarf Bee Species From Region]; by Avinash Nair &amp; Himanshu Darji AHMEDABAD; 6 June 2008; Mobile Paper; The Times of India.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://beekeepingtimes.com/content/view/175/1/ Bee Populations and Crop Yields Go Down in Kachchh, Gujarat]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}; compiled by: MCS; Pune; 6 June 2008; Beekeeping Times; Pune; Maharashtra; India&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ecoregion AT0704.svg|200px|thumb|right|Distribution of the Central Zambezian miombo woodlands]]

The densely forested '''Central Zambezian miombo woodlands''' that cut across southern central [[Africa]] are one of the largest ecozones on the continent and home to a great variety of wildlife, including many large mammals.

==Location and description==
The region covers a large area stretching northeast from [[Angola]], including the southeast section of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], the northern half of [[Zambia]], a large section of western [[Tanzania]], southern [[Burundi]], and northern and western [[Malawi]]. In the Congo the ecoregion is almost conterminous with [[Katanga Province]]. In Zambia it covers the northern half of the country above [[Lusaka]], including the eastern and western "ears" and the [[Copperbelt]]. In Tanzania it covers the western inland provinces between [[Lake Victoria]], [[Lake Tanganyika]] and [[Lake Malawi]].

The area is mostly flat plateau, and the soils are poor. There is a [[tropical climate]] with a long dry season, up to seven months, which leaves the forest vulnerable to fires, and a rainy season from November to March. The woodland is interspersed with riverside [[dambo]]s (grassy wetlands), which may constitute up to thirty percent of the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|name=Central Zambezian Miombo woodlands|id=at0704}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flora==
The woodlands contain much typical [[miombo]] flora of high trees with shrub and grassland underneath, but has much other plant life too. There are typically more [[evergreen]] trees than in most miombo woodlands. The classic miombo trees ''[[Brachystegia]]'', ''[[Julbernardia]]'', and ''[[Isoberlinia]]'' dominate the woodlands with other tree species such as ''[[Pterocarpus angolensis|Pterocapus angolensis]]'', Albizia sp. and ''[[Afzelia quanzensis]]''. Under the trees lie important areas of plants such as the herbaceous ''[[Crotalaria]]'' and ''[[Indigofera]]''.

==Fauna==
The fauna is diverse. The grasses, shrubs and trees sustain many large mammals including [[black rhino]], [[Cape buffalo]], [[African elephant]]s, and [[antelope]]s such as [[Taurotragus|elands]], [[sable antelope]], [[roan antelope]],  [[Lichtenstein's hartebeest]], and [[sitatunga]]. Large carnivores include [[lion]] (''Panthera leo''), [[leopard]] (''Panthera pardus''), [[cheetah]] (''Acinonyx jubatus''), [[spotted hyena]] (''Crocuta crocuta''), [[striped hyena]] (''Hyaena hyaena''), [[African wild dog]] (''Lycaon pictus'') and [[side-striped jackal]] (''Canis adustus''). There are also many [[primate]]s in the woodlands, particularly in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, including [[yellow baboon]] and [[chimpanzee]]. The [[Gombe Stream National Park]] chimpanzee reserve is in this ecoregion. The only [[endemic]] mammals are [[Monard's dormouse]] (''Graphiurus monardi''), [[Rosevear's lemniscomys]] (''Lemniscomys roseveari''), [[Ansell's shrew]] (''Crocidura ansellorum'') and [[Upemba shrew]] (''Crocidura zimmeri'').

The woodlands are also home to many reptiles and birds. There are two endemic bird species, both found in the area of the ecoregion within the Democratic Republic of the Congo: the [[Lake Lufira weaver]] (''Ploceus ruweti'') and the [[black-lored waxbill]] (''Estrilda nigriloris'').

There are nineteen endemic reptiles and thirteen endemic amphibians; a particularly rich area for these is [[Upemba National Park]].

==Urban areas and settlements==
Although the ecoregion does include large areas of wilderness and national parkland, there are also areas with quite heavy population densities, particularly in Malawi and Burundi and in densely populated urban areas such as [[Lusaka]] in Zambia, around which the forest has been largely cleared for planting, firewood and charcoal production. Most of Zambia north of Lusaka is in this ecoregion, including the [[Copperbelt]] cities of [[Ndola]], [[Kitwe]], [[Chingola]], location of the huge Nchanga Mines, [[Luanshya]], and the [[Central Province, Zambia|Central Province]] former mining town of [[Kabwe]] (Broken Hill). In Congo, Katanga has a copper and [[cobalt]] mining industry, and there is a railway line north through the province from the capital [[Lubumbashi]]. In Tanzania the [[Lake Tanganyika]] port of [[Kigoma]] is the starting point for a visit to [[Gombe Stream National Park]].

==Threats and preservation==
Threats to the area include [[bushmeat]] hunting, in particular the [[poaching]] of elephant and rhino. Fire is damaging throughout the region and where there are human populations fire is more common, including the burning of woodland to create agricultural land or for charcoal, for example in Central Zambia. In the highly urbanised Copperbelt areas of Zambia and the Congo the forest has been extensively cleared for charcoal and farming, and waterways polluted by the mining industry, while the civil war in the Congo has led to considerable damage to the environment there.

The ecoregion includes large areas of national park, game reserves and other protected areas, including:
* in Zambia -  the large [[Kafue National Park]] and the privately managed [[Kasanka National Park]] in central Zambia, the [[Chembe Bird Sanctuary]] in the Copperbelt, [[Lake Mweru]], [[Lake Bangweulu]] and [[Nsumbu National Park]] in the north near [[Lake Tanganyika]].
* in Malawi  - the large [[Nyika National Park]], [[Kasungu National Park]]
* in Tanzania- [[Gombe Stream National Park]]

Stobie the''' Disco Cuttlefish''' was the mascot of the 2014 [[Adelaide Fringe Festival]] in [[South Australia]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;McDonald, Patrick [http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/entertainment/adelaide-fringe/stobie-the-disco-cuttlefish-poles-apart-from-usual-fringe-fare/story-fnintxwl-1226825176046 "Stobie the disco cuttlefish poles apart from usual Fringe fare"] ''[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]]'', South Australia (2014-02-20). Retrieved 2014-02-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Its design was inspired by the [[cephalopod]] species ''[[Sepia apama]]'', the Giant Australian Cuttlefish. Stobie was a 13 metre long mechanised parade float which featured blinking eyes, waving tentacles and an elaborate sound, light and dance show.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://ccc-canberracriticscircle.blogspot.com.au/2014/01/adelaide-fringe-gets-ready-to-buzz.html "Adelaide Fringe gets ready to buzz"] ''Canberra Critics Circle'', ACT, Australia (2014-01-21). Retrieved 2014-02-20.&lt;/ref&gt; It made appearances each Saturday night during the festival, accompanied by a professional dance troupe which performed a set routine. This was followed by an original dance called 'The Cuttlefish' during which crowd participation was invited.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Stobie also played a pre-recorded soundtrack of disco hits including a megamix of [[Stayin' Alive]], [[Billie Jean]], [[You Should Be Dancing|You Should be Dancing]] and [[Le Freak]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytMKmOykIbU "Stobie &amp; the Disco Cuttlefish Dance Troupe"] ''[[Adelaide Fringe Festival]]'', Youtube.com. (2014-02-16). Accessed 2014-02-20.&lt;/ref&gt; The opening set routine was performed to the theme-song from the 1980 dance movie, [[Fame (1980 film)|Fame]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Development ==
Adelaide Fringe director Greg Clarke claimed responsibility for suggesting the adoption of a giant Australian cuttlefish as a festival mascot.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; He said that the festival team "wanted to create a creature unique to South Australia and were inspired by the uniqueness and beauty of the giant cuttlefish that inhabits the gulf waters of South Australia."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Fringe Parade spectacular to unveil a giant Disco Cuttlefish {{!}} Australian Arts Review|url = http://artsreview.com.au/fringe-parade-spectacular-to-unveil-a-giant-disco-cuttlefish/|website = artsreview.com.au|access-date = 2016-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was first announced with the release of the event program in November 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 2014 Adelaide Fringe Program Revealed- Introducing a Giant Disco Cuttlefish!|url = http://www.glamadelaide.com.au/main/2014-adelaide-fringe-program-revealed-introducing-a-giant-disco-cuttlefish/|website = Glam Adelaide {{!}} The Best South Australian News|access-date = 2016-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept was realised by a team of South Australian artists and technicians accredited as follows:
* Original drawing – Slade Smith
* Creation and construction – Steve Hayter and Martin Murray
* Lighting design – Geoff Cobham and Chris Petridis
* Music composition and compilation- Harry Covill
* Choreography – Larissa McGowan
* Performers- Lisa Lonero, Andrew Haycroft, Penelope Shum, Chris Mifsud, Kialea Nadine-Williams, Jaeger Man&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
A [[Utility vehicle|ute]] provided the scaffold around which the cuttlefish was constructed. Sound and lighting systems were placed in the tray of the vehicle. The finished cuttlefish changed colour, featured blinking eyes and emitted smoke as a proxy for ink.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Sponsorship ==
The Disco Cuttlefish was sponsored by [[SA Power Networks]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sapowernetworks.com.au/centric/corporate/sponsorship.jsp SA Power Networks &gt; Sponsorship] ''SA Power Networks'', South Australia. Accessed 2014-02-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Adelaide Fringe Festival's 2014 Principal Partner was [[BankSA]], and its government partners were [[ArtsSA]], the [[South Australian Tourism Commission]] and the [[Adelaide City Council]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adelaidefringe.com.au/current-partners Current Partners | Adelaide Fringe] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140224131519/http://www.adelaidefringe.com.au/current-partners |date=February 24, 2014 }} ''Adelaide Fringe Festival'', South Australia. Accessed 2014-02-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
The Adelaide Fringe Festival attracted criticism for using the image of the cuttlefish without referring to the decline of the Northern Spencer Gulf population of ''Sepia apama'' in South Australia.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The decline has been described as 'catastrophic' by conservationists,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;[http://www.conservationsa.org.au/cuttlefish.html Cuttlefish] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303040241/http://www.conservationsa.org.au/cuttlefish.html |date=March 3, 2014 }} ''[[Conservation Council of South Australia]]''. Accessed 2014-02-21.&lt;/ref&gt; as their population has dropped from over 170,000 in the late 1990s to 13,500 in 2013.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[http://www.whyallanewsonline.com.au/story/2098895/disco-cuttlefish-to-raise-awareness/?cs=2180 "Disco Cuttlefish to raise awareness"] ''[[The Whyalla News|Whyalla News]]'', South Australia (2014-02-20). Retrieved 2014-02-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists believe the Whyalla aggregation of Giant Australian cuttlefish may represent a separate and new species, and this population collapse, if continued, may lead to extinction as soon as 2016.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The festival organisers responded by acknowledging that they were aware of the decline via Twitter and Facebook. The Twitter announcement was made on 17 February and read:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"@SaveCuttlefish Adelaide Fringe as an organisation is aware of the Giant Cuttlefish plight and we hope that by highlighting Stobie the Giant Cuttlefish in this way, we will make more people aware of the issues these creatures are facing..."&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/SaveCuttlefish/status/435214076025647104&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Adelaide Fringe Festival also added a footer to the Disco Cuttlefish event page on their website, linking to additional information from the [[Conservation Council of South Australia]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;[http://www.adelaidefringe.com.au/fringetix/free-events/cuttlefish Disco Cuttlefish] ''Adelaide Fringe Festival'', South Australia (2014).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3530">The difference between atmospheric pressure and the pressure existing in the furnace or flue gas passage of a [[boiler]] is termed as '''draft'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dictionary of Scientific and Tech Terms|last=McGraw|first=Hill|publisher=Mc Graw Hill Publications|year=2003|isbn=9780070452701|location=USA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Draft can also be referred to the difference in pressure in the combustion chamber area which results in the motion of the flue gases and the air flow.&lt;ref name="bab"&gt;{{cite book|title=Steam/ its generation and use|last=Babcox &amp; Wilcox|first=|publisher=The Babcock &amp; Wilcox Company|year=1975|isbn=|edition=38|location=USA|page=17-1|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of draft==
Drafts are produced by the rising combustion gases in the stack, flue, or by mechanical means. For example, a blower can be put into four categories: natural, induced, balanced, and forced.
*Natural draft: When air or flue gases flow due to the difference in density of the hot flue gases and cooler ambient gases. The difference in density creates a pressure differential that moves the hotter flue gases into the cooler surroundings.&lt;ref name = 'bab'/&gt;
* Forced draft: When air or flue gases are maintained above atmospheric pressure. Normally it is done with the help of a forced draft fan.&lt;ref name = 'bab'/&gt;
* Induced draft: When air or flue gases flow under the effect of a gradually decreasing pressure below atmospheric pressure. In this case, the system is said to operate under induced draft. The stacks (or chimneys) provide sufficient natural draft to meet the low draft loss needs. In order to meet higher pressure differentials, the stacks must simultaneously operate with draft fans.&lt;ref name = 'bab'/&gt;
*Balanced draft: When the static pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure, the system is referred to as balanced draft. Draft is said to be zero in this system.&lt;ref name = 'bab'/&gt;

==Importance/significance==
For the proper and the optimized heat transfer from the flue gases to the boiler tubes draft holds a relatively high amount of significance. The combustion rate of the flue gases and the amount of heat transfer to the boiler are both dependent on the movement and motion of the flue gases. A boiler equipped with a combustion chamber which has a strong current of air (draft) through the fuel bed will increase the rate of combustion (which is the efficient utilization of fuel with minimum waste of unused fuel). The stronger movement will also increase the heat transfer rate from the flue gases to the boiler (which improves efficiency and circulation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Significance of Drafts in Boiler Practice|last=Ray|first=Walter T|publisher=[[Government Printing Office]]|year=1909|isbn=|location=Washington|pages=6–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drafting in steam locomotives==
Since the stack of a [[steam locomotive|locomotive]] is too short to provide natural draft, during normal running forced draft is achieved by directing the exhaust steam from the cylinders through a cone (“[[blastpipe|blast pipe]]”) upwards and into a skirt at the bottom of the stack. When the locomotive is stationary or in a restricted space “live” steam from the boiler is directed through an annular ring surrounding the blast pipe to produce the same effect.

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Erato''' ({{IPAc-en|'|Er|@|t|oU}}; [[Ancient Greek]]: Ἐρατώ  "desired" or "lovely") was the name of the following individuals.
* Erato, one of the [[Nereids]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]]. ''[[Theogony]], 240ff.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Pseudo-Apollodorus]]. ''Bibliotheca, Book 1.2.7ff.''
&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Erato]], one of the Greek [[Muse]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Apollodorus. ''Bibliotheca, Book 1.3.1.''&lt;/ref&gt;
* Erato, one of the [[Nysiads|Nymphs Dodonides]] (Nysiades), nurses of [[Dionysus]] in [[Nysa (mythology)|Mount Nysa]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'', 182&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Faun merse.jpg|thumb|A faun, as painted by [[Hungary|Hungarian]] painter [[Pál Szinyei Merse]]]]
The '''faun''' ({{Lang-lat|[[faunus]]}}, {{lang-grc|φαῦνος}}, ''phaunos'', {{IPA-el|pʰaunos|pron}}) is a mythological half [[human]]–half [[goat]] creature appearing in Ancient Rome.

The goat man, more commonly affiliated with the [[Satyr]]s of Greek mythology or Fauns of Roman, is a bipedal creature with the legs and tail of a goat and the head, arms and torso of a man and is often depicted with goat's horns and pointed ears. These creatures in turn borrowed their appearance from the god Pan of the Greek pantheon. They were a symbol of fertility, and their chieftain was [[Silenus]], a minor deity of [[Greek mythology]].&lt;ref&gt;''Canadian Oxford Dictionary'', second ed., Oxford University Press, 2004, p. 541.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Romans believed fauns inspired fear in men traveling in lonely, remote or wild places. They were also capable of guiding humans in need, as in the fable of [[The Satyr and the Traveller]], in the title of which Latin authors substituted the word ''Faunus''. Fauns and [[satyr]]s were originally quite different creatures: whereas fauns are half-man and half-goat, satyrs originally were depicted as stocky, hairy, ugly dwarves or [[woodwose]]s with the ears and tails of horses or asses. Satyrs also were more woman-loving than fauns, and fauns were rather foolish where satyrs had more knowledge.

[[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] mythological belief also included a god named [[Faunus]] often associated with enchanted woods and the Greek god [[Pan (god)|Pan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Georgikos/Phaunos.html |title=Theoi Greek Mythology - Phaunos |publisher=Theoi.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/faun|title=faun {{!}} mythical character|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-09-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a goddess named [[Fauna (goddess)|Fauna]] who were [[goat people]].

The ''[[Barberini Faun]]'' (located in the [[Glyptothek]] in [[Munich]], [[Germany]]) is a Hellenistic marble statue from about 200 BCE, found in the Mausoleum of the Emperor [[Hadrian]] (the [[Castel Sant'Angelo]]) and installed at {{lang|it|[[Palazzo Barberini]]}} by Cardinal Maffeo Barberini (later [[Pope Urban VIII]]). [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] restored and refinished the statue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utexas.edu/courses/introtogreece/lect34/hBarberiniFaun.jpg |title=View online |date= |accessdate=2014-06-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020221632/http://www.utexas.edu/courses/introtogreece/lect34/hBarberiniFaun.jpg |archivedate=2012-10-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[House of the Faun]] in Pompei, dating from the 2nd century BCE, was so named because of the dancing faun statue that was the centerpiece of the large garden. The original now resides in the National Museum in Naples and a copy stands in its place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edgarlowen.com/b3719.jpg |title=View online |date= |accessdate=2014-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[French Symbolism|French symbolist]] [[Stéphane Mallarmé]]'s famous masterpiece ''{{lang|fr|[[L'après-midi d'un faune (poem)|L'après-midi d'un faune]]}}'' (published in 1876) describes the sensual experiences of a faun who has just woken up from his [[siesta|afternoon sleep]] and discusses his encounters with several [[nymph]]s during the morning in a dreamlike monologue.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Fry's translation can be read [http://www.angelfire.com/art/doit/mallarme.html online]&lt;/ref&gt; The composer [[Claude Debussy]] based his symphonic poem ''{{lang|fr|[[Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune]]}}'' (1894) &lt;ref&gt;There is a performance on [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol4bSKpvpoc YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt; on the poem, which also served as the scenario for a ballet entitled ''{{lang|fr|L'après-midi d'un faune}}'' (or ''[[Afternoon of a Faun (Nijinsky)|Afternoon of a Faun]]'') choreographed to Debussy's score in 1912 by [[Vaslav Nijinsky]].

==In fiction==
* ''[[The Marble Faun]]'' (1860) is a romance set in Italy by [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]. It was said to have been inspired after viewing the Faun of [[Praxiteles]] in the [[Capitoline Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;The work and its connection with the statue are discussed [http://cla.calpoly.edu/~jbattenb/marblefaun/marblefaun/criticism.htm online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927211258/http://cla.calpoly.edu/~jbattenb/marblefaun/marblefaun/criticism.htm |date=2011-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[H.G. Wells]]' ''[[The Time Machine]]'' (1895), in the year 802,701 A.D., the Time Traveller sees "a statue—a Faun, or some such figure, ''minus'' the head."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Wells|1961|p=246}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mr. Tumnus]], in [[C. S. Lewis]]'s ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' (1949), is a faun. Lewis said that the famous Narnia story, ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'', all came to him from a single picture he had in his head of a faun carrying an umbrella and parcels through a snowy wood.
* In ''[[Lolita]]'', the protagonist is attracted to pubescent girls whom he dubs "[[Nubile#Nymphet|nymphets]]"; "[[Nubile#Faunlet|faunlets]]" are the male equivalent.
* In the 1981 film ''[[My Dinner with Andre]]'' it is related how fauns befriend and take a mathematician to meet [[Pan (god)|Pan]].
* In [[Guillermo del Toro]]'s 2006 film ''[[Pan's Labyrinth]]'' (''{{lang|es|El Laberinto del Fauno}}''), a faun guides the film's protagonist, Ofelia, to a series of tasks, which lead her to a wondrous netherworld.
* [[List of Camp Half-Blood characters|Don]], in [[Rick Riordan]]'s ''[[The Son of Neptune]]'' (2011), is a faun. In the book, several fauns appear, begging for money. Due to his memory of the Greek satyrs, [[Percy Jackson]] feels like there should be more to fauns. Also, in the prequel to ''The Son of Neptune'', ''[[The Lost Hero]]'', [[Jason Grace]] calls [[List of Camp Half-Blood characters|Gleeson Hedge]] a faun upon learning that he is a satyr. In the third instalment in the series, ''[[The Mark of Athena]]'', [[Frank Zhang]] calls Hedge a faun.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26646">The '''historical development of [[geophysics]]''' has been motivated by two factors. One of these is the research curiosity of humankind related to Planet Earth and its several components, its events and its problems. The second is economical usage of Earth's resources (ore deposits, petroleum, water resources, etc.) and Earth-related hazards such  as earthquakes, volcanoes, tsunamis, tides, and floods.

== Classical and observational period ==

In circa 240 BC, [[Eratosthenes]] of Cyrene measured the [[circumference of Earth|circumference of the Earth]], using trigonometry and the angle of the Sun at more than one latitude in Egypt.

There is some information about earthquakes in [[Aristotle]]'s ''Meteorology'', in ''[[Naturalis Historia]]'' by [[Pliny the Elder]], and in [[Strabo]]'s ''[[Geographica]]''. Aristotle and Strabo recorded observations on [[tide]]s.

A natural explanation of [[volcano]]es was first undertaken by the Greek philosopher [[Empedocles]] (c. 490-430 B.C.), who considered the world to be divided into four elemental forces: earth, air, fire and water. He maintained that volcanoes were manifestation of elemental fire. Winds and [[earthquake]]s would play a key role in explanations of volcanoes. [[Lucretius]] claimed [[Mount Etna]] was completely hollow and the fires of the underground driven by a fierce wind circulating near sea level. [[Pliny the Elder]] noted that the presence of earthquakes preceded an eruption. [[Athanasius Kircher]] (1602–1680) witnessed eruptions of Mount Etna and [[Stromboli]], then visited the crater of [[Vesuvius]] and published his view of an Earth with a central fire connected to numerous others caused by the burning of [[sulfur]], [[bitumen]] and [[coal]].

== Instrumental and analytical period ==
[[File:Galileo Thermometer 24 degrees.jpg|thumb|upright|110px|A Galilean thermometer]]
Arguably the first modern experimental treatise was [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]]'s ''[[De Magnete]]'' (1600), in which he deduced that compasses point north because the Earth itself is magnetic. In 1687 [[Isaac Newton]] published his ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'', which not only laid the foundations for [[classical mechanics]] and [[gravitation]] but also explained a variety of geophysical phenomena such as tides and the [[precession of the equinox]].

These experimental and mathematical analyses were applied to several areas of geophysics: Earth’s shape, density, and gravity field ([[Pierre Bouguer]], [[Alexis Clairaut]] and [[Henry Cavendish]]), Earth’s magnetic field ([[Alexander von Humboldt]], [[Edmund Halley]] and [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]]), seismology ([[John Milne]] and [[Robert Mallet]]), and the [[Age of the Earth|Earth's age]], heat and [[radioactivity]] ([[Arthur Holmes]] and [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin]]).

There are several descriptions and discussions about a philosophical theory of the [[water cycle]] by [[Vitruvius|Marcus Vitruvius]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Bernard Palissy]]. Pioneers in [[hydrology]] include [[Pierre Perrault (scientist)|Pierre Perrault]], [[Edme Mariotte]] and [[Edmund Halley]] in studies of such things as rainfall, runoff, drainage area, velocity, river cross-section measurements and discharge. Advances in the 18th century included [[Daniel Bernoulli]]'s [[piezometer]] and [[Bernoulli's equation]] as well as the [[Pitot tube]] by Henri Pitot. In the 19th century, groundwater hydrology was furthered by [[Darcy's law]], the [[Dupuit-Thiem well formula]], and the [[Hagen-Poiseuille equation]] for flows through pipes. ''Physical Geography of the Sea'', the first textbook of oceanography, was written by [[Matthew Fontaine Maury]] in 1855.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The thermoscope, or [[Galileo thermometer]], was constructed by [[Galileo Galilei]] in 1607. In 1643, [[Evangelista Torricelli]] invented the [[Barometer#Mercury barometers|mercury barometer]]. [[Blaise Pascal]] (in 1648) rediscovered that atmospheric pressure decreases with height, and deduced that there is a vacuum above the atmosphere.

== Emergence as a discipline==
The first known use of the word ''geophysics'' was by [[Julius Fröbel]] in 1834 (in German). It was used occasionally in the next few decades, but did not catch on until journals devoted to the subject began to appear, beginning with ''Beiträge zur Geophysik'' in 1887. The future ''[[Journal of Geophysical Research]]'' was founded in 1896 with the title ''Terrestrial Magnetism''. In 1898, a Geophysical Institute was founded at the [[University of Göttingen]], and [[Emil Wiechert]] became the world's first Chair of Geophysics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schröder|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; An international framework for geophysics was provided by the founding of the [[International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics]] in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Good|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 20th century ==
The 20th century was a revolutionary age for geophysics. As an international scientific effort between 1957 and 1958, the [[International Geophysical Year]] or IGY was one of the most important for scientific activity of all disciplines of geophysics: [[aurora (astronomy)|aurora]] and [[airglow]], [[cosmic rays]], [[Earth's magnetic field|geomagnetism]], gravity, ionospheric physics, longitude and latitude determinations (precision mapping), meteorology, oceanography, seismology and solar activity.

=== Earth's interior and seismology ===
[[File:Rayleigh_wave.jpg|thumb|Rayleigh wave]]
Determining the physics of Earth's interior was enabled by the development of the first seismographs in the 1880s. Based on the behavior of the waves reflected off the internal layers of the Earth, several theories developed as to what would cause variances in wave speed or loss of certain frequencies. This led to scientists like Inge Lehmann discovering the presence of the Earth's core in 1936. Beno Gutenberg and Harold Jeffreys worked at explaining the difference in Earth's density due to compression and the shear velocity of waves.&lt;ref name=Olson&gt;{{cite book|last1=Olson|first1=P.|chapter=8.01 Core dynamics: An introduction and overview|title=Treatise on Geophysics|date=2015|volume=8.01|doi=10.1016/B978-0-444-53802-4.00137-8|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since seismology is based on elastic waves, the speed of waves could help determine density and therefore the behavior of the layers within the Earth.&lt;ref name=Olson/&gt;

Nomenclature for the behavior of seismic waves was produced based on these findings. [[P-wave]]s and [[S-wave]]s were used to describe two types of elastic body waves possible.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.geo.mtu.edu/UPSeis/waves.html|title=What Is Seismology and What Are Seismic Waves?|last=Endsley|first=Kevin|website=www.geo.mtu.edu|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Love wave]]s and [[Rayleigh wave]]s were used to describe two types of surface waves possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kanao|first=Masaki|date=January 25, 2012|title=Seismic Waves- Research and Analysis|url=https://www.intechopen.com/books/seismic-waves-research-and-analysis|journal=InTech|volume=|pages=20–40|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Scientists who have contributed to advances in knowledge about the Earth's interior and [[seismology]] include [[Emil Wiechert]], [[Beno Gutenberg]], [[Andrija Mohorovičić]], [[Harold Jeffreys]], [[Inge Lehmann]], [[Edward Bullard]], [[Charles Francis Richter]], [[Francis Birch (geophysicist)|Francis Birch]], [[Frank Press]], [[Hiroo Kanamori]] and [[Walter Elsasser]].

One highly debated topic about Earth's interior is mantle plumes. These are theorized to be rising magma, which is responsible for the hotspots in the world, like Hawaii. Originally the theory was that mantle plumes rose up in a direct path, but now there is evidence that the plumes may deflect by small degrees as they rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Agius|first=Matthew R.|last2=Rychert|first2=Catherine A.|last3=Harmon|first3=Nicholas|last4=Laske|first4=Gabi|date=2017|title=Mapping the mantle transition zone beneath Hawaii from Ps receiver functions: Evidence for a hot plume and cold mantle downwellings|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0012821X17303497|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|volume=474|pages=226–236|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2017.06.033|issn=0012-821X|via=|bibcode=2017E&amp;PSL.474..226A}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also found that the proposed hotspot underneath Yellowstone may not be related to a rising mantle plume. This theory has not been fully researched.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gao|first=Stephen S.|last2=Liu|first2=Kelly H.|date=2014|title=Mantle transition zone discontinuities beneath the contiguous United States|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/2014JB011253|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth|language=en|volume=119|issue=8|pages=6452–6468|doi=10.1002/2014jb011253|issn=2169-9313|via=|bibcode=2014JGRB..119.6452G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Plate tectonics ===
In the second half of the 20th century, [[plate tectonics]] theory was developed by several contributors including [[Alfred Wegener]], [[Maurice Ewing]], [[Robert S. Dietz]], [[Harry Hammond Hess]], [[Hugo Benioff]], [[Walter C. Pitman, III]], [[Frederick Vine]], [[Drummond Matthews]], [[Keith Runcorn]], [[Bryan L. Isacks]], [[Edward Bullard]], [[Xavier Le Pichon]], [[Dan McKenzie (professor)|Dan McKenzie]], [[W. Jason Morgan]] and [[John Tuzo Wilson]]. Prior to this, people had ideas of continental drift, but no real evidence came until the late 20th century. [[Alexander von Humboldt]] observed in the early 19th century the geometry and geology of the shores of continents of the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;ref name=Kearey&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kearey|first1=Philip|last2=Klepeis|first2=Keith A|last3=Vine|first3=Frederick J.|title=Global tectonics.|date=2009|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1405107778|edition=3rd|pages=5–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Hutton]] and [[Charles Lyell]] brought about the idea of gradual change, uniformitarianism, which helped people cope with the slow drift of the continents. [[Alfred Wegener]] spearheaded the original theory of continental drift and spent much of his life devoted to this theory. He proposed "[[Pangaea]]", one unified giant continent.&lt;ref name=Kearey /&gt;

During the development of [[Continental drift|continental drift theory]], there was not much exploration  of the oceanic part of the world, only continental. Once people began to pay attention to the ocean, geologists found that the floor was spreading, and in different rates at different spots.&lt;ref name=Kearey /&gt;  There are three different main ways in which plates can move: [[Transform fault|transform]], [[Divergent boundary|divergent]], and [[Convergent boundary|Convergent]].&lt;ref name=Kearey /&gt; As well, there can be [[Rift]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, areas where the land is beginning to spread apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ethiopianrift.igg.cnr.it/rift%20valley%20significance.htm|title=Rift Valley: definition and geologic significance|website=ethiopianrift.igg.cnr.it|access-date=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Oceanography ===
Advances in [[physical oceanography]] occurred in the 20th century. Sea depth by acoustic measurements was first made in 1914. The German "Meteor" expedition gathered 70,000 ocean depth measurements using an [[echo sounding|echo sounder]], surveying the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]] between 1925 and 1927. The [[Mid-ocean ridge|Great Global Rift]] was discovered by [[Maurice Ewing]] and [[Bruce Heezen]] in 1953, and the mountain range under the Arctic was found in 1954 by the [[Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute|Arctic Institute of the USSR]]. The theory of seafloor spreading was developed in 1960 by [[Harry Hammond Hess]]. The [[Ocean Drilling Program]] started in 1966. There has been much emphasis on the application of large scale computers to oceanography to allow numerical predictions of ocean conditions and as a part of overall environmental change prediction.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

=== Geomagnetism ===
[[File:Geomagnetic_polarity_late_Cenozoic.svg|thumb|404x404px|Geomagnetic polarity, late Cenozoic]]
The motion of the conductive molten metal beneath the Earth's crust, or the Earth's [[Dynamo theory|dynamo]], is responsible for the existence of the magnetic field. The interaction of the magnetic field and solar radiation has an impact on how much radiation reaches the surface of Earth and the integrity of the atmosphere. It has been found that the magnetic poles of the Earth have reversed several times, allowing researchers to get an idea of the surface conditions of the planet at that time.&lt;ref name=Kono&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kono|first1=M.|chapter=Geomagnetism: An introduction and overview|title=Geomagnetism|series=Treatise on Geophysics|volume=5|editor1-first=M.|editor1-last=Kono|publisher=Elsevier|date=2015|doi=10.1016/B978-0-444-53802-4.00095-6|isbn=0444538038|pages=1&amp;ndash;31|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cause of the [[Geomagnetic reversal|magnetic poles being reversed]] is unknown, and the intervals of change vary and do not show a consistent interval.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lutz|first=Timothy M.|date=1985|title=The magnetic reversal record is not periodic|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=317|issue=6036|pages=404–407|doi=10.1038/317404a0|issn=1476-4687|bibcode=1985Natur.317..404L}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that the reversal is correlated to the Earth's mantle, although exactly how is still debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Glatzmaier|first=Gary A.|last2=Coe|first2=Robert S.|last3=Hongre|first3=Lionel|last4=Roberts|first4=Paul H.|date=1999|title=The role of the Earth's mantle in controlling the frequency of geomagnetic reversals|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=401|issue=6756|pages=885–890|doi=10.1038/44776|issn=1476-4687|bibcode=1999Natur.401..885G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Distortions to the Earth's magnetic field cause the phenomenon [[Aurora|Aurora Borealis]], commonly called the Northern Lights.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/themis/auroras/themis_power.html|title=THEMIS Satellites Discover What Triggers Eruptions of the Northern Lights|last=Administrator|first=NASA|date=2013-06-07|work=NASA|access-date=2018-04-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magnetic field stores energy given by cosmic particles known as solar wind, which causes the magnetic field lines to expand.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; When the lines contract, they release this energy, which can be seen as the Northern Lights.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Atmospheric influences ===
The Earth's climate changes over time due to the planet's atmospheric composition, the sun's luminosity, and the occurrence of catastrophic events.&lt;ref name=Pollack&gt;{{Cite book|first1=James B.|last1=Pollack|chapter-url=https://www.nap.edu/read/11798/chapter/7|chapter=5. Solar, Astronomical, and Atmospheric Effects on Climate |title=Climate in Earth History: Studies in Geophysics |publisher=The National Academies Press|date=1982|pages=68&amp;ndash;76|language=en|doi=10.17226/11798}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|75}}

=== Industrial application ===
Industrial applications of geophysics were developed by demand of [[petroleum]] exploration and recovery in the 1920s. Later, petroleum, [[mining]] and [[groundwater]] geophysics were improved. Earthquake hazard minimization and soil/site investigations for earthquake-prone areas were new applications of geophysical engineering in the 1990s.

Seismology is used in the mining industry to read and build models of events that may have been caused or contributed to by the process of mining.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Achievements, History and Challenges in Geophysics: 60th Anniversary of the Institute of Geophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences|last1=Bialik|first1=Robert|last2=Majdański|first2=Mariusz|last3=Moskalik|first3=Mateusz|date=2014-07-14|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319075990|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows scientists to predict the hazards associated with mining in the area.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Much like mining, seismic waves are used to create models of the Earth's subsurface. Geological features, called [[Structural trap|traps]], that commonly indicate the presence of oil, can be identified from the model and used to determine suitable sites to drill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dasgupta|first1=Shivaji N.|last2=Aminzadeh|first2=Fred|title=Geophysics for petroleum engineers|date=2013|publisher=Elsevier Science|location=Burlington|isbn=9780080929613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20175">'''Hot dry rock (HDR)''' is an abundant source of [[geothermal energy]] available for use. A vast store of thermal energy is contained within hot - but essentially dry - impervious crystalline basement rocks found almost everywhere deep beneath the earth’s surface.&lt;ref&gt;Armstead, H. C. H., and Tester, J. W., 1987. Heat Mining, E. &amp; F. N. Spon, London and New York, pp.&amp;nbsp;34–58&lt;/ref&gt; A concept for the extraction of useful amounts of geothermal energy from HDR originated at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] in 1970, and Laboratory researchers were awarded a U.S. patent covering it.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, R. M., Smith, M. C., and Robinson, E. S., 1974. “Method of extracting heat from dry geothermal reservoirs,” U. S. patent No. 3,786,858&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Renewable energy}}

==Overview==
Although often confused with the relatively limited hydrothermal resource already commercialized to a large extent, HDR geothermal energy is very different.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, D. W., 2009. "Hot dry rock geothermal energy: Important lessons from Fenton Hill," in Proceedings, 34th workshop on geothermal reservoir engineering (February 9–11, 2009: Stanford, CA). SGP-TR-187, pp.&amp;nbsp;139–142&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas hydrothermal energy production can only exploit hot fluids already in place in the earth’s crust, an HDR system (consisting of the pressurized HDR reservoir, the boreholes  drilled from the surface, and the surface injection pumps and associated plumbing) recovers the earth’s heat from hot but dry regions via the closed-loop circulation of pressurized fluid. This fluid, injected from the surface under high pressure, opens pre-existing joints in the basement rock, creating a man-made reservoir which can be as much as a cubic kilometer in size. The fluid injected into the reservoir absorbs thermal energy from the high-temperature rock surfaces and then serves as the conveyor for transporting the heat to the surface for practical use.

==Planning and control==
As the reservoir is formed by the pressure-dilation of the joints, the elastic response of the surrounding rock mass results in a region of tightly compressed, sealed rock at the periphery—making the HDR reservoir totally confined and contained. Such a reservoir is therefore fully engineered, in that the physical characteristics (size, depth at which it is created) as well as the operating parameters (injection and production pressures, production temperature, etc.) can be pre-planned and closely controlled.

==Drilling and pressurization==
As described by Brown,&lt;ref&gt;Brown, D. W., 1990. “Hot dry rock reservoir engineering,” Geotherrm. Resour. Counc. Bull. 19(3): 89–93&lt;/ref&gt; an HDR geothermal energy system is developed, first, by using conventional drilling to access a region of deep, hot basement rock. Once it has been determined the selected region contains no open faults or joints (by far the most common situation), an isolated section of the first borehole is pressurized at a level high enough to open several sets of previously sealed joints in the rock mass. By continuous pumping (hydraulic stimulation), a very large region of stimulated rock is created (the HDR reservoir) which consists of an interconnected array of joint flow paths within the rock mass. The opening of these flow paths causes movement along the pressure-activated joints, generating seismic signals (microearthquakes). Analysis of these signals yields information about the location and dimensions of the reservoir being developed.

==Production wells==
Typically, an HDR reservoir forms in the shape of an [[ellipsoid]], with its longest axis [[orthogonal]] to the least principal earth stress. This pressure-stimulated region is then accessed by two production wells, drilled to intersect the HDR reservoir near the elongated ends of the stimulated region. In most cases, the initial borehole becomes the injection well for the three-well, pressurized water-circulating system.

==Operation==
In operation, fluid is injected at pressures high enough to hold open the interconnected network of joints against the earth stresses, and to effectively circulate fluid through the HDR reservoir at a high rate. During routine energy production, the injection pressure is maintained at just below the level that would cause further pressure-stimulation of the surrounding rock mass, in order to maximize energy production while limiting further reservoir growth.

==Productivity==
The volume of the newly created array of opened joints within the HDR reservoir is much less than 1% of the volume of the pressure-stimulated rock mass. As these joints continue to pressure-dilate, the overall flow impedance across the reservoir becomes very low, leading to a high thermal productivity.

==Feasibility studies==
The feasibility of mining heat from the deep earth was proven in two separate HDR reservoir flow demonstrations—each involving about one year of circulation—conducted by the Los Alamos National Laboratory between 1978 and 1995. These groundbreaking tests took place at the Laboratory’s [[Fenton Hill Observatory|Fenton Hill]] HDR test site in the [[Jemez Mountains]] of north-central [[New Mexico]], at depths of over 8000&amp;nbsp;ft and rock temperatures in excess of 180&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="Brown 2012"&gt;Brown, D. W., Duchane, D. V., Heiken, G., and Hriscu, V. T., 2012. ''Mining the Earth’s Heat: Hot Dry Rock Geothermal Energy,'' Springer-Verlag, Berlin and Heidelberg, 655 pp&lt;/ref&gt; The results of these tests demonstrated conclusively the viability of the revolutionary new HDR geothermal energy concept. The two separate reservoirs created at Fenton Hill are still the only truly confined HDR geothermal energy reservoirs flow-tested anywhere in the world.

==Unconfirmed systems==
There have been numerous reports of the testing of unconfined geothermal systems pressure-stimulated in crystalline basement rock: for instance at the [[Rosemanowes quarry]] in Cornwall, England;&lt;ref&gt;Parker, R. H., 1989. “Hot Dry Rock Geothermal Energy, Phase 2B Final Report of the Camborne School of Mines Project,” Vol. 1–2, Pergamon Press, Oxford, U.K.&lt;/ref&gt; at the Hijiori&lt;ref&gt;Matsunaga, I., Niitsuma, H., and Oikaya, Y., 2005. "Review  of the HDR development at Hijiori Site, Japan,” in Proceedings, World Geothermal Congress (April 24–29, 2005: Antala, Turkey), pp.&amp;nbsp;3861–3865&lt;/ref&gt; and Ogachi&lt;ref&gt;Ito, H., and Kaieda, H., 2002.

Hannover, Germany, pp. 61–70&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[Cooper Basin]], Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Chopra, P., and Wyborn, D., 2003. "Australia's first hot dry rock geothermal energy extraction project is up and running in granite beneath the Cooper Basin, NE South Australia," in Proceedings, The Ishihara Symposium: Granites and Associated Metallogenesis (July 22–24, 2003: Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia), pp. 43–45&lt;/ref&gt; However, all these “engineered” geothermal systems, while developed under programs directed toward the investigation of HDR technologies, have proven to be open—as evidenced by the high water losses observed during pressurized circulation.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, D., DuTeaux, R., Kruger, P., Swenson, D., and Yamaguchi, T., 1999. Table 1: “Fluid circulation and heat extraction from engineered geothermal reservoirs,” Geothermics 28(4/5) special issue: Hot Dry Rock/Hot Wet Rock Academic Review (Abé, H., Niitsuma, H., and Baria, R., eds.), pp. 553–572&lt;/ref&gt;  In essence, they are all EGS or hydrothermal systems, not true HDR reservoirs.

==Enhanced geothermal systems==
{{main|Enhanced geothermal system}}
The EGS concept was first described by Los Alamos researchers in 1990, at a geothermal symposium sponsored by the [[United States Department of Energy]] (DOE)&lt;ref&gt;Brown, D. W., and Robinson, B. A., 1990. “Hot dry rock technology,” in Proceedings, Geothermal Program Review VIII (April 18–20, 1990: San Francisco, CA). CONF 9004131, pp. 109–112&lt;/ref&gt;—many years before the DOE coined the term EGS in an attempt to emphasize the geothermal aspect of heat mining rather than the unique characteristics of HDR.

==Fenton Hill tests==

===Phase I===
The first HDR reservoir tested at Fenton Hill, the Phase I reservoir, was created in June 1977 and then flow-tested for 75 days, from January to April 1978, at a thermal power level of 4 MW.&lt;ref&gt;Dash, Z. V., Murphy, H. D., and Cremer, G. M. (eds.), 1981. “Hot dry rock geothermal reservoir testing: 1978–1980,” Los Alamos National Laboratory Report LA-9080-SR, 62 pp&lt;/ref&gt; The final water loss rate, at a surface injection pressure of 900 psi, was 2 gpm (2% of the injection rate). This initial reservoir was shown to essentially consist of a single pressure-dilated, near-vertical joint, with a vanishingly small flow impedance of 0.5 psi/gpm.

The initial Phase I reservoir was enlarged in 1979 and further flow-tested for almost a year in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, D. W., and Duchane, D. V., 1999. "Scientific progress on the Fenton Hill HDR project since 1983,” Geothermics 28(4/5) special issue: Hot Dry Rock/Hot Wet Rock Academic Review (Abe, H., Niitsuma, H., and Baria, R., eds.), pp. 591–601&lt;/ref&gt; Of greatest importance, this flow test confirmed that the enlarged reservoir was also confined, and exhibited a low water loss rate of 6 gpm. This reservoir consisted of the single near-vertical joint of the initial reservoir (which, as noted above, had been flow-tested for 75 days in early 1978)augmented by a set of newly pressure-stimulated near-vertical joints that were somewhat oblique to the strike of the original joint.

===Phase II===
A deeper and hotter HDR reservoir (Phase II) was created during a [[Hydraulic fracturing#Massive fracturing|massive hydraulic fracturing]] (MHF) operation in late 1983.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, D. W., and Duchane, D. V., 1999. "Scientific progress on the Fenton Hill HDR project since 1983,” Geothermics 28(4/5) special issue: Hot Dry Rock/Hot Wet Rock Academic Review (Abe, H., Niitsuma, H., and Baria, R., eds.), pp. 591–601&lt;/ref&gt; It was first flow-tested in the spring of 1985, by an initial closed-loop flow test (ICFT) that lasted a little over a month.&lt;ref&gt;Dash, Z. V., et al., 1989. "ICFT: an initial closed-loop flow test of the Fenton Hill Phase II HDR reservoir,” Los Alamos National Laboratory report LA-11498-HDR, Los Alamos NM, 128 pp&lt;/ref&gt; Information garnered from the ICFT provided the basis for a subsequent long-term flow test (LTFT), carried out from 1992 to 1995.

The LTFT comprised several individual steady-state flow runs, interspersed with numerous additional experiments.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, D. W., 1993. “Recent flow testing of the HDR reservoir at Fenton Hill, New Mexico,” Geothermal Program Review XI, April, 1993. U.S. Department of Energy, Conservation and Renewable Energy, Geothermal Division, pp. 149–154&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992–1993, two steady-state circulation periods were implemented, the first for 112 days and the second for 55 days. During both tests, water was routinely produced at a temperature of over 180&amp;nbsp;°C and a rate of 90–100 gpm, resulting in continuous thermal energy production of approximately 4 MW. Over this time span, the reservoir pressure was maintained (even during shut-in periods) at a level of about 15 MPa.

Beginning in mid-1993, the reservoir was shut in for a period of nearly two years and the applied pressure was allowed to drop to essentially zero. In the spring of 1995, the system was re-pressurized and a third continuous circulation run of 66 days was conducted.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, D. W., 1995. “1995 verification flow testing of the HDR reservoir at Fenton Hill, New Mexico,” Geothermal Resources Council annual meeting (October 8–11, 1995: Reno, NV) Trans. Geotherm. Resour. Counc. 19:253–256&lt;/ref&gt; Remarkably, the production parameters observed in the two earlier tests were rapidly re-established, and steady-state energy production resumed at the same level as before. Observations during both the shut-in and operational phases of all these flow-testing periods provided clear evidence that the rock at the boundary of this man-made reservoir had been compressed by the pressurization and resultant expansion of the reservoir region.

As a result of the LTFT, water loss was eliminated as a major concern in HDR operations.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, D., 1995. "The US hot dry rock program—20 years of experience in reservoir testing," in Proceedings of the World Geothermal Congress (May 18–31, 1995: Florence, Italy), International Geothermal Association, Inc., Auckland, New Zealand, vol. 4, pp. 2607–2611&lt;/ref&gt; Over the period of the LTFT, water consumption fell to just 7% of the quantity of water injected; and data indicated it would have continued to decline under steady-state circulation conditions. Dissolved solids and gases in the produced fluid rapidly reached equilibrium values at low concentrations (about one-tenth the salinity of sea water), and the fluid remained geochemically benign throughout the test period.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, D. W., Duchane, D. V., Heiken, G., and Hriscu, V. T., 2012. Mining the Earth’s Heat: Hot Dry Rock Geothermal Energy, Springer-Verlag, Berlin and Heidelberg, Chapter 9, pp. 541–549&lt;/ref&gt; 
Routine operation of the automated surface plant showed that HDR energy systems could be run using the same economical staffing schedules that a number of unmanned commercial hydrothermal plants already employ.

===Test results===
The Fenton Hill tests clearly demonstrated the advantages of a fully engineered HDR reservoir over naturally occurring hydrothermal resources, including EGS. With all the essential physical characteristics of the reservoir—including rock volume, fluid capacity, temperature, etc.—established during the engineered creation of the reservoir zone, and the entire reservoir volume enclosed by a hyperstressed periphery of sealed rock, any variations in operating conditions are totally determined by intentional changes made at the surface. In contrast, a natural hydrothermal “reservoir”—which is essentially open and therefore unconfined(having boundaries that are highly variable)—is inherently subject to changes in natural conditions.

Another advantage of an HDR reservoir is that its confined nature makes it highly suitable for load-following operations, whereby the rate of energy production is varied to meet the varying demand for electric power—a process that can greatly increase the economic competitiveness of the technology.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, D. W., and DuTeau, R. J., 1995. "Using a hot dry rock geothermal reservoir for load following," in Proceedings, 20th annual workshop on geothermal reservoir engineering (January 27–29, 1995: Stanford, CA). SGP-TR-150, pp. 207–211&lt;/ref&gt; This concept was evaluated near the end of the Phase II testing period, when energy production was increased by 60% for 4 hours each day, by a programmed vent-down of the high-pressure reservoir regions surrounding the production borehole. Within two days it became possible to computerize the process, such that production was automatically increased and decreased according to the desired schedule for the rest of the test period. The transitions between the two production levels took less than 5 minutes, and at each level steady-state production was consistently maintained. Such load-following operations could not be implemented in a natural hydrothermal system or even in an EGS system because of the unconfined volume and boundary conditions.

The experiments at Fenton Hill have clearly demonstrated that HDR technology is unique, not only with respect to how the pressurized reservoir is created and then circulated, but also because of the management flexibility it offers. It has in common with hydrothermal technology only that both are “geothermal.”

==HWR versus HDR==
Hot Wet Rock (HWR) hydrothermal technology makes use of hot fluids found naturally in basement rock; but such HWR conditions are rare.&lt;ref&gt;Armstead, H. C. H., and Tester, J. W., 1987. Heat Mining, E. &amp; F. N. Spon, London and New York, pp. 55–58&lt;/ref&gt; By far the bulk of the world’s geothermal resource base (over 98%) is in the form of basement rock that is hot but dry—with no naturally available water. This means that HDR technology is applicable almost everywhere on earth (hence the claim that HDR geothermal energy is ubiquitous).

Typically, the temperature in those vast regions of the accessible crystalline basement rock increases with depth. This geothermal gradient, which is the principal HDR resource variable, ranges from less than 20&amp;nbsp;°C/km to over 60&amp;nbsp;°C/km, depending upon location. The concomitant HDR economic variable is the cost of drilling to depths at which rock temperatures are sufficiently high to permit the development of a suitable reservoir.&lt;ref&gt;Tester, J. W., Herzog, H. J., Chen, Z., Potter, R. M., and Frank, M. G., 1994. “Prospects for universal geothermal energy from heat mining,” Science and Global Security Vol. 5, pp. 99–121&lt;/ref&gt; The advent of new technologies for drilling hard crystalline basement rocks, such as new PDC (polycrystalline diamond compact) drill bits, drilling turbines or fluid-driven percussive technologies (such as Mudhammer &lt;ref&gt;Souchal, R., 2017, High-Power Mudhammer Drilling: A promising solution for deep geothermal reservoirs, Geotherm Deep Geothermal Energy Congress proceedings&lt;/ref&gt;) may significantly improve HDR economics in the near future.

==Possible confusion==
As noted above, in the late 1990s the DOE began referring to all attempts to extract geothermal energy from basement rock as “EGS,” which has led to both biographical and technical confusion. Biographically, a large number of publications exist that discuss work to extract energy from HDR without any mention of the term EGS. Thus, an internet search using the term EGS would not identify these publications.

But the technical distinction between HDR and EGS, as clarified in this article, may be even more important. Some sources describe the permeability of the earth’s basement rock as a continuum ranging from totally impermeable HDR to slightly permeable HWR to highly permeable conventional hydrothermal.&lt;ref&gt;Sass, J. H., and Robertson-Tait, A., 2002. “Potential for enhanced geothermal systems in the western United States,” in Geologisches Jahrbuch special edition (Baria, R., Baumgärtner, J., Gérard, A., and Jung, R., eds.), international conference—4th HDR Forum (September 28–30, 1998: Strasbourg, France). Hannover, Germany, pp. 35–42&lt;/ref&gt; However, this continuum concept is not technically correct. A more appropriate view would be to consider impermeable HDR rock as a separate state from that of the continuum of permeable rock—just as one would consider a completely closed faucet as distinct from one that is open to any degree, whether the flow be a trickle or a flood. In the same way, HDR technology should be regarded as totally distinct from EGS.

==Further reading==
A definitive book on HDR development, including a full account of the experiments at Fenton Hill, was published by Springer-Verlag in April 2012.&lt;ref name="Brown 2012"/&gt;

'''Iron(II) hydroxide''' or '''ferrous hydroxide''' is an [[inorganic compound]] with the formula Fe(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It is produced when iron(II) salts, from a compound such as [[iron(II) sulfate]], are treated with [[hydroxide]] ions. Iron(II) hydroxide is a white solid, but even traces of oxygen impart a greenish tinge.  The air-oxidized solid is sometimes known as "[[green rust]]".

==Preparation and reactions==
Iron(II) hydroxide is poorly soluble in water (1.43 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;3&lt;/sup&gt; [[gram|g]]/[[liter|L]]), or 1.59 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; mol/L. &lt;!-- (Commenting out this sentence left by an anonymous editor; no idea if there is a problem here or not; see Talk page) somehow these values don't match the ones in the table on the right. Someone please verify where the 0,72 g/100mL comes from --&gt; It precipitates from the reaction of iron(II) and hydroxide salts:&lt;ref name=brauer&gt;H. Lux "Iron(II) Hydroxide" in Handbook of Preparative Inorganic Chemistry, 2nd Ed. Edited by G. Brauer, Academic Press, 1963, NY. Vol. 1. p. 1498.&lt;/ref&gt;
:FeSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2NaOH → Fe(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

If the solution is not [[Deoxygenation|deoxygenated]] and the iron reduced, the precipitate can vary in color starting from green to reddish brown depending on the iron(III) content.  Iron(II) ions are easily substituted by iron(III) ions produced by its progressive oxidation.

It is also easily formed as a by-product of other reactions, a.o., in the synthesis of [[siderite]], an iron carbonate (FeCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), if the crystal growth conditions are imperfectly controlled.

==Structure==
Fe(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[Layered double hydroxides|layer double hydroxide]] (LDH).

===Related materials===
Green rust is a recently discovered mineralogical form. All forms of green rust (including fougerite) are more complex and variable than the ideal iron(II) hydroxide compound. The natural analogue of iron(II) hydroxide compound is a very rare mineral [[amakinite]], (Fe,Mg)(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Reactions==
Under anaerobic conditions, the iron(II) hydroxide can be oxidized by the protons of water to form [[magnetite]] (iron(II,III) oxide) and molecular [[hydrogen]].
This process is described by the [[Schikorr reaction]]:
:3 Fe(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Anions such as [[Selenite (ion)|selenite]] and [[selenate]] can be easily adsorbed on the positively charged surface of iron(II) hydroxide, where they are subsequently reduced by Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. The resulting products are poorly soluble (Se&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, FeSe, or FeSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

Iron(II) hydroxide has also been investigated as an agent for the removal of toxic [[selenate]] and [[selenous acid|selenite]] ions from water systems such as [[wetland]]s. The iron(II) hydroxide [[redox|reduces]] these ions to elemental [[selenium]], which is insoluble in water and [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitates]] out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In a basic solution iron(II) hydroxide is the electrochemically active material of the negative electrode of the [[nickel-iron battery]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4900">The most important lakes in the [[Faroe Islands]] are [[Sørvágsvatn|Leitisvatn]] on [[Vágar]], [[Fjallavatn]] also on [[Vágar]], Sandsvatn on [[Sandoy]], Lake Eiði on [[Eysturoy]] and Lake Toftir on [[Eysturoy]]. There are many other smaller lakes across the whole country, most of them used for leisure fishing. Some of the lakes are also used for electricity production, and especially Lake Eiði near [[Eiði]] and the water systems around [[Vestmanna]] are important in this context. Also in [[Strond]] on [[Borðoy]] and at [[Botnur power plant|Botnur]] in [[Suðuroy]] there are important power-plants.

The following table lists most [[river]]s of [[Sri Lanka]]. Since Sri Lanka is a trilingual country, some rivers may have a [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]] name (i.e. [[Kalu Ganga]]), while other have an [[English language|English]] name (i.e. [[Kelani River]]). In the Sinhala language, Ganga (ගඟ) translates to "river", where as Oya (ඔය) translates to "smaller river".{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} At {{Convert|335|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, the [[Mahaweli River]] is the longest river in the island, and has [[drainage basin]] covering more than one-fifth of the island.

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Melanippe''' ([[Greek language|Ancient Greek]]: Μελανίππη, "black mare") referred to several different people:

* Melanippe, daughter of the [[Centaur]] [[Chiron]]. Also known as [[Hippe]] or [[Euippe]]. She bore a daughter to [[Aeolus (son of Hellen)|Aeolus]], Melanippe or [[Arne (mythology)|Arne]] (see below). She escaped to Mount [[Pelion]] so that her father would not find out that she was pregnant, but, being searched for, she prayed to [[Artemis]] asking for assistance, and the goddess transformed her into a mare. Other accounts state that the transformation was a punishment for her having scorned Artemis, or for having divulged the secrets of gods. She was later placed among the stars.&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-[[Eratosthenes]], ''Catasterisms'', 18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyginus]], ''Poetical Astronomy'', 2. 18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0104%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DM%3Aentry+group%3D16%3Aentry%3Dmelanippe-bio-1 "Melanippe" 1.]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Melanippe (daughter of Aeolus)|Melanippe]], daughter of [[Aeolus (son of Hellen)|Aeolus]] and the precedent Melanippe (or else daughter of Hippotes or of Desmontes).
* Melanippe, daughter of [[Althaea (Greek mythology)|Althaea]] and [[Oeneus]], one of the [[Meleagrids]]. She was turned into a [[guinea fowl]] by [[Artemis]] after the death of her brother, [[Meleager]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Antoninus Liberalis]], ''Metamorphoses'', 2&lt;/ref&gt;
* Melanippe, an [[Amazons|Amazon]], sister of [[Hippolyta]], [[Penthesilea]] and [[Antiope (Amazon)|Antiope]], daughter of [[Ares]]. [[Heracles]] captured her and demanded Hippolyte's girdle in exchange for her freedom. Hippolyte complied and Heracles let her go.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], ''Library of History'', 4.16.3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freewebs.com/vitaphone1/history/justin.html Justin's Epitome of Trogus Pompeius' History of the World, Book 2, part IV] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014210005/http://www.freewebs.com/vitaphone1/history/justin.html |date=2012-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some say that it was Melanippe whom [[Theseus]] abducted and married.&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-[[Apollodorus of Athens|Apollodorus]], ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'', [[Epitome]] of Book IV, 1. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Yet others relate that she was killed by [[Telamon]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Scholia]] on [[Pindar]], Nemean Ode 3. 64&lt;/ref&gt;
* Melanippe, wife of Hippotes, son of Mimas, himself son of Aeolus, and the mother of another Aeolus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], ''Library of History'', 4. 67. 3&lt;/ref&gt;
* Melanippe, daughter of the winged horse [[Pegasus]] and [[Ocyrhoe]] the centauress.
* Melanippe, a [[nymph]] who married [[Itonus]], son of [[Amphictyon]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'', 9. 1. 1&lt;/ref&gt;
*Melanippe, possible wife of [[Chalcodon]] and mother of [[Elephenor]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Tzetzes]] on [[Lycophron]], 1034&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Melanippe'', an emendation for "Medippe" (name of one of the [[sacrificial victims of Minotaur]]) in [[Servius]]' commentaries on ''[[Aeneid]]''.

[[File:ClayOven.JPG|thumb|400px|Traditional moorish oven]]
A '''moorish oven''' (''hornos morunos'' in Spanish) is a traditional [[clay]] [[wood-fired oven]].

== Calera==
Calera is a type of [[Moors|Moorish]] traditional oven for the manufacture of plaster. It is commonly used in Morocco and environs. During the Moorish period, the plaster produced was intended to erect walls on the humble homes of Madrid. Its use dates back to the early Middle Ages, and the popularity of plaster as a building material caused the demand to surge so much that more than hundred moorish ovens were built within the Madrid community. The demand for plaster was local so all of the ovens are located near the historic centers of Madrid municipalities.

The name comes from the use made during the Al-Andalus era of ''Aljezares'' in the production of plaster. These furnaces were in production until mid-century.{{huh?|date=January 2015}}

[[File:Mt Bruce National Wildlife Centre.JPG|Mount Bruce National Wildlife Centre|thumb|280px|right]]

==History==
The forest was acquired by the government in the 1870s as part of the “[[Seventy Mile Bush]]”, which covered the area from [[Masterton]] to [[Central Hawkes Bay]] before European settlement. Most of the bush was destroyed and converted to farmland, but the 942 hectare Mount Bruce block was protected as a Forest Reserve. Some 55 ha of this were further protected as a Native Bird Reserve, administered by the Wildlife Service.

Local man Elwyn Welch became an expert in captive raising of birds, including endangered birds, leading to successes with [[Takahē]] (Porphyrio hochstetteri)  in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="DNZB Welch"&gt;{{DNZB|title=Elwyn Owen Arnold Welch|first= Gareth|last= Winter|id=5w18|accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, the centre was established to breed and release endangered native birds on these 55 hectares. [[Takahe]] (a very rare bird, thought extinct, but rediscovered in [[Fiordland]]) were the first species introduced. In the same decade, a large number of [[brown teal]], [[buff weka]] and [[kākāriki]] were released.

In 2001 the entire forest became part of the wildlife reserve, extending the area from 55 to 942 hectares, increasing capacity to breed birds and diversified species. About 100&amp;nbsp;km of tracks were cut and thousands of traps and bait stations were scattered, setting up an area for wildlife with low predator pressure.

==Pukaha Mount Bruce missions==
===Conservation===
The main objective of is to help restore native wildlife. Currently restoration mostly concerns birds, but will expand to bats and reptiles such as the [[tuatara]]. Controlling invasive pest populations is an important means to ensuring the successful rejuvenation of native wildlife in the area. Currently the [[Goodnature]] [https://www.goodnature.co.nz/products/rat-stoat/ A24] [http://www.pukaha.org.nz/sites/default/files/Restoration%20report%202015.pdf traps are being used] in conjunction with other pest control methods with the aim of bringing the rat, stoat, and possum populations down to reduce the threat these animals pose to native birds in particular. 

Bird releases started in 1996 with nine [[kākā]],&lt;ref name=MtBruce160Kaka&gt;{{cite web|title=Mt Bruce kaka population soars|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/environment/8136140/Mt-Bruce-kaka-population-soars|publisher=stuff.co.nz|accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a kind of [[parrot]].&lt;ref&gt;Berry, Raelene (1998).

Wellington: Department of Conservation. {{ISBN|0-478-21732-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There are now approximately 160 kākā in the forest,&lt;ref name=MtBruce160Kaka /&gt;  and the goal is to have a population of 600 in a few years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pukaha.org.nz/icon-birds Icon birds] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091202075839/http://www.pukaha.org.nz/icon-birds |date=2 December 2009 }}, Pukaha Mount Bruce.&lt;/ref&gt; [[North Island brown kiwi]] and [[North Island kōkako]] translocations followed in 2003. Over 15 kiwi are currently living in the forest and two in the nocturnal house, including some chicks. For the breeding programme, they incubate kiwi eggs to protect chicks and thus give them the chance to become adult.

===Education===
Many schools visit the centre. Some sponsor a kiwi, so they can follow its progress since the release. They participate in the [[LEOTC]] (Learning experiences Outside the Classroom) education programme, giving them the chance to see the kiwi and to learn about environmental problems facing New Zealand.

===Tourism===
The second biggest mission of the centre is to welcome tourists and to educate them about environmental things and the protection of the wildlife. There are about 50,000 visitors per year.

There are several tourist facilities: a café, aviaries to discover the native birds and the nocturnal house where they can see the shy kiwi. There are guided visits and a daily feeding demonstrations for kākā and eels.

==Staff==
There is a staff of about 15: two work in reception, seven work with the birds or on forest regeneration, two on marketing and communication, and three or four at the café. There are also many volunteers from all over the world, who help the rangers with various tasks including preparing for the bird feeding and maintaining the aviaries and the park for the tourists.

It is closed only on Christmas Day.

The '''Mpemba effect''' is a process in which hot [[water]] can [[freezing|freeze]] faster than cold water. The phenomenon is temperature-dependent. There is disagreement about the parameters required to produce the effect and about its theoretical basis.&lt;ref name="Burridge"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/srep37665| pmid = 27883034| pmc = 5121640| title = Questioning the Mpemba effect: Hot water does not cool more quickly than cold| journal = Scientific Reports| volume = 6| pages = 37665| year = 2016| last1 = Burridge| first1 = Henry C.| last2 = Linden| first2 = Paul F.| bibcode = 2016NatSR...637665B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tao"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/acs.jctc.6b00735| pmid = 27996255| title = Different Ways of Hydrogen Bonding in Water - Why Does Warm Water Freeze Faster than Cold Water?| journal = Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation| volume = 13| issue = 1| pages = 55–76| year = 2017| last1 = Tao| first1 = Yunwen| last2 = Zou| first2 = Wenli| last3 = Jia| first3 = Junteng| last4 = Li| first4 = Wei| last5 = Cremer| first5 = Dieter}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Mpemba-two-water-probes.svg|thumb|440x440px]]

The Mpemba effect is named after [[Erasto B. Mpemba|Erasto Batholomeo Mpemba]] (b.1950) who discovered it in 1963. There were preceding [[ancient]] accounts of similar phenomena, but lacking sufficient detail to attempt verification.

== Definition ==
The phenomenon, when taken to mean "hot water freezes faster than cold", is difficult to reproduce or confirm because this statement is ill-defined.&lt;ref name="ball" /&gt; Monwhea Jeng proposes as a more precise wording:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There exists a set of initial parameters, and a pair of temperatures, such that given two bodies of water identical in these parameters, and differing only in initial uniform temperatures, the hot one will freeze sooner.&lt;ref name="Jeng"&gt;{{Cite journal
| title=Hot water can freeze faster than cold?!?
| journal=American Journal of Physics
| year=2006
| first=Monwhea

| doi=10.1119/1.2186331|bibcode = 2006AmJPh..74..514J }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, even with this definition it is not clear whether "freezing" refers to the point at which water forms a visible surface layer of ice; the point at which the entire volume of water becomes a solid block of ice; or when the water reaches {{convert|0|C}}.&lt;ref name="ball" /&gt; A quantity of water can be at {{convert|0|C}} and not be ice; after enough heat has been removed to reach {{convert|0|C}} more heat must be removed before the water changes to solid state (ice), so water can be liquid or solid at {{convert|0|C}}.

With the above definition there are simple ways in which the effect might be observed: For example, if the hotter temperature melts the frost on a cooling surface and thus increases the thermal conductivity between the cooling surface and the water container.&lt;ref name="ball" /&gt; On the other hand, there may be many circumstances in which the effect is not observed.&lt;ref name="ball" /&gt;

[[File:Mpemba effect (30653381280).jpg|thumb|right|A pot of boiling water thrown into the winter air]]

=== Historical context ===
Various effects of heat on the freezing of water were described by ancient scientists such as [[Aristotle]]: "The fact that the water has previously been warmed contributes to its freezing quickly: for so it cools sooner. Hence many people, when they want to cool water quickly, begin by putting it in the sun. So the inhabitants of [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] when they encamp on the ice to fish (they cut a hole in the ice and then fish) pour warm water round their reeds that it may freeze the quicker, for they use the ice like lead to fix the reeds."&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]], [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/meteorology.1.i.html Meteorology] I.12 348b31–349a4&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle's explanation involved ''[[antiperistasis]]'', "the supposed increase in the intensity of a quality as a result of being surrounded by its contrary quality."

[[Early modern]] scientists such as [[Francis Bacon]] noted that, "slightly tepid water freezes more easily than that which is utterly cold."&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Bacon|Bacon, Francis]]; ''Novum Organum''de, [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/bacon/bacon.liber2.shtml Lib. II], L&lt;/ref&gt; In the original [[Latin]], "aqua parum tepida facilius conglacietur quam omnino frigida."

[[René Descartes]] wrote in his ''[[Discourse on the Method]]'', "One can see by experience that water that has been kept on a fire for a long time freezes faster than other, the reason being that those of its particles that are least able to stop bending evaporate while the water is being heated."&lt;ref&gt;[[René Descartes|Descartes, René]]; [http://posner.library.cmu.edu/Posner/books/pages.cgi?call=423_D44D_1637&amp;layout=vol0/part0/copy0&amp;file=0247 Les Météores]&lt;/ref&gt; This relates to [[Descartes' vortex theory]].

The Scottish scientist [[Joseph Black]] investigated a special case of this phenomenon comparing previously-boiled with unboiled water;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Black |first1=Joseph |title=The Supposed Effect of Boiling upon Water, in Disposing It to Freeze More Readily, Ascertained by Experiments. By Joseph Black, M. D. Professor of Chemistry at Edinburgh, in a Letter to Sir John Pringle, Bart. P. R. S. |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |date=1 January 1775 |volume=65 |pages=124–128 |doi=10.1098/rstl.1775.0014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the previously-boiled water froze more quickly. Evaporation was controlled for. He discussed the influence of stirring on the results of the experiment, noting that stirring the unboiled water led to it freezing at the same time as the previously-boiled water, and also noted that stirring the very-cold unboiled water led to immediate freezing. Joseph Black then discussed [[Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit|Fahrenheit's]] description of [[supercooling]] of water (although the term supercooling had not then been coined), arguing, in modern terms, that the previously-boiled water could not be as readily supercooled.

=== Mpemba's observation ===
The effect is named after [[Tanzania]]n [[Erasto B. Mpemba|Erasto Mpemba]]. He described it in 1963 in Form 3 of Magamba Secondary School, [[Tanganyika]], when freezing ice cream mix that was hot in cookery classes and noticing that it froze before the cold mix. He later became a student at Mkwawa Secondary (formerly High) School in [[Iringa]]. The headmaster invited [[Denis Osborne|Dr. Denis G. Osborne]] from the University College in [[Dar es Salaam]] to give a lecture on physics. After the lecture, [[Erasto B. Mpemba|Erasto Mpemba]] asked him the question, "If you take two similar containers with equal volumes of water, one at {{convert|35|C}} and the other at {{convert|100|C}}, and put them into a freezer, the one that started at {{convert|100|C}} freezes first. Why?", only to be ridiculed by his classmates and teacher. After initial consternation, Osborne experimented on the issue back at his workplace and confirmed Mpemba's finding. They published the results together in 1969, while Mpemba was studying at the [[College of African Wildlife Management]].&lt;ref name="Mpemba"&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Modern context ===
Mpemba and Osborne describe placing {{convert|70|ml|abbr=on}} samples of water in {{convert|100|ml|abbr=on}} beakers in the ice box of a domestic refrigerator on a sheet of polystyrene foam. They showed the time for ''freezing to start'' was longest with an initial temperature of {{convert|25|C}} and that it was much less at around {{convert|90|C}}. They ruled out loss of liquid volume by evaporation as a significant factor and the effect of dissolved air. In their setup most heat loss was found to be from the liquid surface.&lt;ref name="Mpemba" /&gt;
 
David Auerbach describes an effect that he observed in samples in glass beakers placed into a liquid cooling bath. In all cases the water supercooled, reaching a temperature of typically {{convert|-6|to|-18|C}} before spontaneously freezing. Considerable random variation was observed in the time required for spontaneous freezing to start and in some cases this resulted in the water which started off hotter (partially) freezing first.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

James Brownridge, a radiation safety officer at the [[State University of New York]], has said that he believes that supercooling is involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Chown |first1=Marcus |title=Revealed: why hot water freezes faster than cold |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20527535.200-revealed-why-hot-water-freezes-faster-than-cold/ |work=New Scientist |date=24 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[molecular dynamics]] simulations have also supported that changes in hydrogen bonding during supercooling takes a major role in the process.&lt;ref name="Jin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sun"&gt;{{Cite journal

In 2016, Burridge and Linden defined the criterion as the time to reach {{convert|0|°C|°F}}, carried out experiments and reviewed published work to date. They noted that the large difference originally claimed had not been replicated, and that studies showing a small effect could be influenced by variations in the positioning of thermometers. They say, "We conclude, somewhat sadly, that there is no evidence to support meaningful observations of the Mpemba effect".&lt;ref name="Burridge" /&gt;

However, in 2017, two research groups independently and simultaneously found theoretical evidence of the Mpemba effect and also predicted a new "inverse" Mpemba effect in which heating a cooled, far-from-equilibrium system takes less time than another system that is initially closer to equilibrium. Lu and Raz&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lu |first=Zhiyue |last2=Raz |first2=Oren |date=2017-05-16 |title=Nonequilibrium thermodynamics of the Markovian Mpemba effect and its inverse |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/114/20/5083 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |language=en |volume=114 |issue=20 |pages=5083–5088 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1701264114 |issn=0027-8424 |pmid=28461467 |arxiv=1609.05271 |bibcode=2017PNAS..114.5083L |pmc=5441807}}&lt;/ref&gt; yield a general criterion based on Markovian statistical mechanics, predicting the appearance of the inverse Mpemba effect in the [[Ising model]] and diffusion dynamics.

In this last work, it is suggested that a very generic mechanism leading to both Mpemba effects is due to a particle velocity [[Distribution function (physics)|distribution function]] that significantly deviates from the [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution|Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution]].

== Suggested explanations ==
The following explanations have been proposed:

* ''[[Evaporation]]'': The evaporation of the warmer water reduces the mass of the water to be frozen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal
| last= Kell |first=George S.
| title = The freezing of hot and cold water
| journal = American Journal of Physics

| doi = 10.1119/1.1975687
| issue = 5
| bibcode = 1969AmJPh..37..564K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Evaporation is [[endothermic]], meaning that the water mass is cooled by vapor carrying away the heat, but this alone probably does not account for the entirety of the effect.&lt;ref name="Jeng" /&gt;
* ''[[Convection]]'': Accelerating [[heat transfer]]s. Reduction of water density below {{convert|4|°C|°F}} tends to suppress the convection currents that cool the lower part of the liquid mass; the lower density of hot water would reduce this effect, perhaps sustaining the more rapid initial cooling. Higher convection in the warmer water may also spread ice crystals around faster.&lt;ref&gt;[[CITV]] ''[[Prove It!]]'' [http://www.proveit.tv/series-1/fs.html?p=13&amp;s=3 Series 1 Programme 13]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Frost]]'': Has [[Thermal insulation|insulating]] effects. The lower temperature water will tend to freeze from the top, reducing further heat loss by radiation and air convection, while the warmer water will tend to freeze from the bottom and sides because of water convection. This is disputed as there are experiments that account for this factor.&lt;ref name="Jeng" /&gt;
* ''[[Solution|Solutes]]'': The effects of [[calcium carbonate]], [[magnesium carbonate]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| arxiv=physics/0604224
| title=When hot water freezes before cold
| journal=American Journal of Physics

| doi=10.1119/1.2996187
| bibcode=2009AmJPh..77...27K
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Thermal conductivity]]'': The container of hotter liquid may melt through a layer of frost that is acting as an insulator under the container (frost is an insulator, as mentioned above), allowing the container to come into direct contact with a much colder lower layer that the frost formed on (ice, refrigeration coils, etc.) The container now rests on a much colder surface (or one better at removing heat, such as refrigeration coils) than the originally colder water, and so cools far faster from this point on.
*''[[Dissolution (chemistry)|Dissolved gases]]'': Cold water can contain more dissolved gases than hot water, which may somehow change the properties of the water with respect to convection currents, a proposition that has some experimental support but no theoretical explanation.&lt;ref name="Jeng" /&gt;
* ''[[Hydrogen bonding]]'': In warm water, hydrogen bonding is weaker.&lt;ref name="Tao" /&gt;
* ''[[Crystallization]]'': Another explanation suggests that the relatively higher population of water hexamer states in warm water might be responsible for the faster crystallization.&lt;ref name="Jin"&gt;{{Cite journal

== Recent views ==
A reviewer for ''[[Physics World]]'' writes, "Even if the Mpemba effect is real &amp;mdash; if hot water can sometimes freeze more quickly than cold &amp;mdash; it is not clear whether the explanation would be trivial or illuminating." He pointed out that investigations of the phenomenon need to control a large number of initial parameters (including type and initial temperature of the water, dissolved gas and other impurities, and size, shape and material of the container, and temperature of the refrigerator) and need to settle on a particular method of establishing the time of freezing, all of which might affect the presence or absence of the Mpemba effect. The required vast multidimensional array of experiments might explain why the effect is not yet understood.&lt;ref name="ball"&gt;Ball, Philip (April 2006). [http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/print/2006/mar/29/does-hot-water-freeze-first Does hot water freeze first?]. ''Physics World'', pp. 19-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[New Scientist]]'' recommends starting the experiment with containers at {{convert|35|and|5|C}} to maximize the effect.&lt;ref&gt;''How to Fossilize Your Hamster: And Other Amazing Experiments for the Armchair Scientist'', {{ISBN|1-84668-044-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a related study, it was found that freezer temperature also affects the probability of observing the Mpemba phenomenon as well as container temperature.

In 2012, the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]] held a competition calling for papers offering explanations to the Mpemba effect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsc.org/mpemba-competition/ ''Mpemba Competition''], Royal Society of Chemistry, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; More than 22,000 people entered and [[Erasto B. Mpemba|Erasto Mpemba]] himself announced Nikola Bregović as the winner. Bregović suggests two reasons for the effect — a colder sample gets supercooled rather than frozen, and enhanced convection in the warmer sample speeds up cooling by maintaining the heat gradient on the container walls.&lt;ref&gt;Bregović, Nikola; [http://www.rsc.org/images/nikola-bregovic-entry_tcm18-225169.pdf ''Mpemba effect from a viewpoint of an experimental physical chemist''], 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Tao and co-workers proposed yet another possible explanation in 2016. On the basis of results from vibrational spectroscopy and modeling with [[density functional theory]]-optimized water clusters, they suggest that the reason might lie in the vast diversity and peculiar occurrence of different [[hydrogen bond]]s. Their key argument is that the number of strong hydrogen bonds increases as [[temperature]] is elevated.  The existence of the small strongly-bonded clusters facilitates in turn the [[nucleation]] of [[Ice Ih|hexagonal ice]] when warm water is rapidly cooled down.&lt;ref name="Tao" /&gt;

== Similar effects ==
Other phenomena in which large effects may be achieved faster than small effects are
* [[Latent heat]]: turning {{convert|0|C}} ice to {{convert|0|C}} water takes the same amount of energy as heating water from {{convert|0|C}} to {{convert|80|C}} 
* [[Leidenfrost effect]]: lower temperature boilers can sometimes vaporize water faster than higher temperature boilers

'''Opacity''' is the measure of impenetrability to [[electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] or other kinds of [[radiation]], especially visible [[light]].  In [[radiative transfer]], it describes the absorption and scattering of radiation in a [[transmission medium|medium]], such as a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], [[dielectric]], [[radiation shield|shielding material]], glass, etc.  An '''opaque''' object is neither [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]] (allowing all light to pass through) nor [[translucent]] (allowing some light to pass through).  When light strikes an interface between two substances, in general some may be reflected, some absorbed, some scattered, and the rest transmitted (also see [[refraction]]). Reflection can be [[diffuse reflection|diffuse]], for example light reflecting off a white wall, or [[specular reflection|specular]], for example light reflecting off a mirror. An opaque substance transmits no light, and therefore reflects, scatters, or absorbs all of it.  Both [[mirror]]s and [[carbon black]] are opaque.  Opacity depends on the [[frequency]] of the light being considered.  For instance, some kinds of [[glass]], while transparent in the [[visible light|visual range]], are largely opaque to [[ultraviolet]] light.  More extreme frequency-dependence is visible in the [[absorption line]]s of cold [[gas]]es. Opacity can be quantified in many ways; for example, see the article [[mathematical descriptions of opacity]].

Different processes can lead to opacity including [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]], [[reflection (physics)|reflection]], and [[light scattering|scattering]].

==Radiopacity==
{{Main|Radiodensity}}
''Radiopacity'' is preferentially used to describe opacity of [[X-rays]]. In modern medicine, radiodense substances are those that will not allow X-rays or similar radiation to pass. [[Radiography|Radiographic imaging]] has been revolutionized by radiodense [[contrast medium|contrast media]], which can be passed through the bloodstream, the [[gastrointestinal tract]], or into the cerebral spinal fluid and utilized to highlight CT scan or X-ray images. Radiopacity is one of the key considerations in the design of various devices such as guidewires or [[stent]]s that are used during [[radiology|radiological]] intervention. The radiopacity of a given endovascular device is important since it allows the device to be tracked during the interventional procedure.

==Quantitative definition==
{{See also|Extinction (astronomy)|attenuation coefficient}}

The words "opacity" and "opaque" are often used as colloquial terms for objects or media with the properties described above. However, there is also a specific, quantitative definition of "opacity", used in astronomy, plasma physics, and other fields, given here.

In this use, "opacity" is another term for the [[mass attenuation coefficient]] (or, depending on context, [[mass absorption coefficient]], the difference is described [[Absorption coefficient#Attenuation versus absorption|here]]) &lt;math&gt;\kappa_\nu&lt;/math&gt; at a particular frequency &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; of electromagnetic radiation.

More specifically, if a beam of light with frequency &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; travels through a medium with opacity &lt;math&gt;\kappa_\nu&lt;/math&gt; and mass density &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;, both constant, then the intensity will be reduced with distance ''x'' according to the formula
:&lt;math&gt;I(x) = I_0 e^{-\kappa_\nu \rho x}&lt;/math&gt;
where
* ''x'' is the distance the light has traveled through the medium
* &lt;math&gt;I(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the intensity of light remaining at distance ''x''
* &lt;math&gt;I_0&lt;/math&gt; is the initial intensity of light, at &lt;math&gt;x = 0&lt;/math&gt;

For a given medium at a given frequency,  the opacity has a numerical value that may range between 0 and infinity, with units of length&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/mass.

Opacity in air pollution work refers to the percentage of light blocked instead of the attenuation coefficient (aka extinction coefficient) and varies from 0% light blocked to 100% light blocked:

&lt;math&gt;Opacity = 100\% \left(1-\frac{I(x)}{I_0} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

===Planck and Rosseland opacities===
It is customary to define the average opacity, calculated using a certain weighting scheme. '''Planck opacity''' uses the normalized [[Planck's law of black body radiation|Planck black body radiation energy density distribution]], &lt;math&gt; B_{\nu}(T)&lt;/math&gt;, as the weighting function, and averages &lt;math&gt;\kappa_\nu&lt;/math&gt; directly:
:&lt;math&gt;\kappa_{Pl}={\int_0^\infty \kappa_\nu B_\nu(T) d\nu     \over   \int_0^\infty B_\nu(T) d\nu    }=\Big( { \pi \over \sigma T^4}\Big) \int_0^\infty \kappa_\nu B_\nu(T) d\nu &lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Stefan-Boltzmann constant]].

'''Rosseland opacity''' (after [[Svein Rosseland]]), on the other hand, uses a temperature derivative of the [[Planck's law of black body radiation|Planck distribution]], &lt;math&gt;u(\nu, T)=\partial B_\nu(T)/\partial T&lt;/math&gt;, as the weighting function, and averages &lt;math&gt;\kappa_\nu^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\kappa} = \frac{\int_0^{\infty} \kappa_{\nu}^{-1} u(\nu, T) d\nu }{\int_0^{\infty} u(\nu,T) d\nu}&lt;/math&gt;.
The photon mean free path is  &lt;math&gt;\lambda_\nu = (\kappa_\nu \rho)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. The Rosseland opacity is derived in the diffusion approximation to the radiative transport equation. It is valid whenever the radiation field is isotropic over distances comparable to or less than a radiation mean free path, such as in local thermal equilibrium.
In practice, the mean opacity for [[Thomson scattering|Thomson electron scattering]] is:
:&lt;math&gt;\kappa_{\rm es} = 0.20(1+X) {\rm\, cm}^2{\rm \,g}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; is the hydrogen mass fraction.
For [[Bremsstrahlung|nonrelativistic thermal bremsstrahlung]], or free-free transitions, assuming solar [[metallicity]], it is:
:&lt;math&gt;\kappa_{\rm ff}(\rho, T) = 0.64 \times 10^{23} (\rho[ {\rm g}~ {\rm\, cm}^{-3}])(T[{\rm K}])^{-7/2} {\rm\, cm}^2 {\rm\, g}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart L. Shapiro and [[Saul Teukolsky|Saul A. Teukolsky]], "Black Holes, White Dwarfs, and Neutron Stars" 1983, {{ISBN|0-471-87317-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Rosseland mean [[attenuation coefficient]] is:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\kappa} = \frac{\int_0^{\infty} (\kappa_{\nu, {\rm es}} + \kappa_{\nu, {\rm ff}})^{-1} u(\nu, T) d\nu }{\int_0^{\infty} u(\nu,T) d\nu}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;George B. Rybicki and [[Alan Lightman|Alan P. Lightman]], "[https://books.google.com/books?id=LtdEjNABMlsC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Rosseland%20mean%20attenuation%20coefficient%22&amp;f=false Radiative Processes in Astrophysics]" 1979 {{ISBN|0-471-04815-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peijaiset''' (in dialectal forms '''peijahaiset''', '''peijaat''' or '''peijaajaiset''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Kielitoimiston sanakirja]]|publisher=KOTUS|location=headword "peijaiset"|accessdate=14 January 2012|language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a Finnish word that in its modern usage often refers to the celebrations following a successful [[moose|elk]] [[hunting|hunt]] (or the hunting season), but may mean celebrating also other things that have come to an end (figurative references to "pejaiset" over e.g. bankrupt companies occur in newspapers). Traditionally, it referred to burials, but also to other celebrations in some dialects.&lt;ref name=HS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kotus.fi/index.phtml?s=1095|title=Pidetäänkö peijaiset?|last=Länsimäki|first=Maija|date=30 October 2001|work=Helsingin Sanomat|language=Finnish|accessdate=14 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317024358/http://www.kotus.fi/index.phtml?s=1095|archivedate=17 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Karhunpeijaiset is a celebration after a bear hunt. A bear was never "hunted"; it was merely ''brought down''. A single man could claim to have hunted and killed a bear, but in a community effort, the bear simply died. The ceremony was always a much more elaborate affair than the most influential member of the community would have merited. In eastern Finland it would have copious mourners and wailers, and the people would address the bear as a relative or as the son of a god. Its flesh was not eaten &amp;mdash; that would have been cannibalism &amp;mdash; or, if it was, an elaborate show was made to symbolically render the meat into that of another animal, e.g. venison. The bear's head was usually mounted on the top of a young tree, or on a pike. Carrion-eaters would then eat it, leaving only the [[skull]], which would then become an object of veneration. A courtyard would also be cleared around the skull. Traditionally, only bears were sanctified thus.{{fact|date=January 2013}}

Sometimes the ceremony was held as a sacred [[marriage]] rather than a burial. In such cases the bear was either propped up inside a frame or strapped to a cross. With all due ceremony, the chosen bride or groom would symbolically marry the bear. {{fact|date=January 2013}}

Nowadays ''peijaiset'' usually means the festivities ending a successful hunt or hunting season, usually only for [[moose]] and [[bear]].&lt;ref name=HS /&gt; On many occasions these include making a meal of the latest kill for hunters in the evening.{{fact|date=January 2013}}

Similar customs have been reported from many other northern people who share their habitat with bears.

[[File:Gyroscope precession.gif|thumb|Precession of a [[gyroscope]]]]

'''Precession''' is a change in the [[orientation (geometry)|orientation]] of the rotational axis of a [[rotation|rotating]] body. In an appropriate [[frame of reference|reference frame]] it can be defined as a change in the first [[Euler angles|Euler angle]], whereas the third Euler angle defines the [[rotation around a fixed axis|rotation itself]]. In other words, if the axis of rotation of a body is itself rotating about a second axis, that body is said to be precessing about the second axis. A motion in which the second Euler angle changes is called ''[[nutation]]''. In [[physics]], there are two types of precession: [[torque]]-free and torque-induced.

In astronomy, ''precession'' refers to any of several slow changes in an astronomical body's rotational or orbital parameters. An important example is the steady change in the orientation of the axis of rotation of the [[Earth]], known as the [[axial precession|precession of the equinoxes]].

==Torque-free==
Torque-free precession implies that no external moment (torque) is applied to the body. In torque-free precession, the [[angular momentum]] is a constant, but the [[angular velocity]] vector changes orientation with time. What makes this possible is a time-varying [[moment of inertia]], or more precisely, a time-varying [[Moment of inertia#The inertia tensor|inertia matrix]]. The inertia matrix is composed of the moments of inertia of a body calculated with respect to separate [[Basis (linear algebra)|coordinate axes]] (e.g. {{math|''x''}}, {{math|''y''}}, {{math|''z''}}). If an object is asymmetric about its principal axis of rotation, the moment of inertia with respect to each coordinate direction will change with time, while preserving angular momentum. The result is that the [[Vector component#Decomposition|component]] of the angular velocities of the body about each axis will vary inversely with each axis' moment of inertia.

The torque-free precession rate of an object with an axis of symmetry, such as a disk, spinning about an axis not aligned with that axis of symmetry can be calculated as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

When an object is not perfectly [[solid]], internal [[vortices]] will tend to damp torque-free precession, and the rotation axis will align itself with one of the inertia axes of the body.

For a generic solid object without any axis of symmetry, the evolution of the object's orientation, represented (for example) by a rotation matrix {{math|'''''R'''''}} that transforms internal to external coordinates, may be numerically simulated. Given the object's fixed internal [[moment of inertia tensor]] {{math|'''''I'''''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} and fixed external angular momentum {{math|'''''L'''''}}, the instantaneous angular velocity is
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\omega\left(\boldsymbol R\right) = \boldsymbol R \boldsymbol I_0^{-1} \boldsymbol R ^T \boldsymbol L&lt;/math&gt;
Precession occurs by repeatedly recalculating {{math|'''''ω'''''}} and applying a small [[Rotation representation (mathematics)#Euler axis and angle .28rotation vector.29|rotation vector]] {{math|'''''ω''' dt''}} for the short time {{math|''dt''}}; e.g.:
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol R_\text{new} = \exp\left(\left[\boldsymbol\omega\left(\boldsymbol R_\text{old}\right)\right]_{\times} dt\right) \boldsymbol R_\text{old}&lt;/math&gt;
for the [[Cross product#Conversion to matrix multiplication|skew-symmetric matrix]] {{math|['''''ω''''']&lt;sub&gt;×&lt;/sub&gt;}}. The errors induced by finite time steps tend to increase the rotational kinetic energy:
:&lt;math&gt;E\left(\boldsymbol R\right) = \boldsymbol \omega\left(\boldsymbol R\right) \cdot \frac{\boldsymbol L }{ 2}&lt;/math&gt;
this unphysical tendency can be counteracted by repeatedly applying a small rotation vector {{math|'''''v'''''}} perpendicular to both {{math|'''''ω'''''}} and {{math|'''''L'''''}}, noting that
:&lt;math&gt;E\left(\exp\left(\left[\boldsymbol v\right]_{\times}\right) \boldsymbol R\right) \approx E\left(\boldsymbol R\right) + \left(\boldsymbol \omega\left(\boldsymbol R\right) \times \boldsymbol L\right) \cdot \boldsymbol v&lt;/math&gt;

Another type of torque-free precession can occur when there are multiple reference frames at work. For example, Earth is subject to local torque induced precession due to the gravity of the sun and moon acting on Earth's axis, but at the same time the solar system is moving around the galactic center. As a consequence, an accurate measurement of Earth's axial reorientation relative to objects outside the frame of the moving galaxy (such as distant quasars commonly used as precession measurement reference points) must account for a minor amount of non-local torque-free precession, due to the solar system’s motion.

==Torque-induced==
Torque-induced precession ('''gyroscopic precession''') is the phenomenon in which the [[axis of rotation|axis]] of a spinning object (e.g., a [[gyroscope]]) describes a [[Cone (geometry)|cone]] in space when an external [[torque]] is applied to it. The phenomenon is commonly seen in a [[spinning top|spinning toy top]], but all rotating objects can undergo precession. If the [[speed]] of the rotation and the [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] of the external torque are constant, the spin axis will move at [[right angle]]s to the [[Direction (geometry, geography)|direction]] that would intuitively result from the external torque. In the case of a toy top, its weight is acting downwards from its center of mass and the [[normal force]] (reaction) of the ground is pushing up on it at the point of contact with the support. These two opposite forces produce a torque which causes the top to precess.

[[Image:Gyroscopic precession 256x256.png|frame|right|The response of a rotating system to an applied torque. When the device swivels, and some roll is added, the wheel tends to pitch.]]
The device depicted on the right (or above on mobile devices) is [[gimbal]] mounted. From inside to outside there are three axes of rotation: the hub of the wheel, the gimbal axis, and the vertical pivot.

To distinguish between the two horizontal axes, rotation around the wheel hub will be called ''spinning'', and rotation around the gimbal axis will be called ''pitching''.  Rotation around the vertical pivot axis is called ''rotation''.

First, imagine that the entire device is rotating around the (vertical) pivot axis. Then, spinning of the wheel (around the wheelhub) is added. Imagine the gimbal axis to be locked, so that the wheel cannot pitch. The gimbal axis has sensors, that measure whether there is a [[torque]] around the gimbal axis.

In the picture, a section of the wheel has been named {{math|''dm''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}. At the depicted moment in time, section {{math|''dm''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is at the [[perimeter]] of the rotating motion around the (vertical) pivot axis. Section {{math|''dm''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, therefore, has a lot of angular rotating [[velocity]] with respect to the rotation around the pivot axis, and as {{math|''dm''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is forced closer to the pivot axis of the rotation (by the wheel spinning further), because of the [[Coriolis effect]], with respect to the vertical pivot axis, {{math|''dm''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} tends to move in the direction of the top-left arrow in the diagram (shown at 45°) in the direction of rotation around the pivot axis.&lt;ref name="Teodorescu"&gt;{{cite book

Note that both arrows point in the same direction.

The same reasoning applies for the bottom half of the wheel, but there the arrows point in the opposite direction to that of the top arrows. Combined over the entire wheel, there is a torque around the gimbal axis when some spinning is added to rotation around a vertical axis.

It is important to note that the torque around the gimbal axis arises without any delay; the response is instantaneous.

In the discussion above, the setup was kept unchanging by preventing pitching around the gimbal axis. In the case of a spinning toy top, when the spinning top starts tilting, gravity exerts a torque. However, instead of rolling over, the spinning top just pitches a little. This pitching motion reorients the spinning top with respect to the torque that is being exerted. The result is that the torque exerted by gravity – via the pitching motion – elicits gyroscopic precession (which in turn yields a counter torque against the gravity torque) rather than causing the spinning top to fall to its side.

Precession or gyroscopic considerations have an effect on [[bicycle]] performance at high speed. Precession is also the mechanism behind [[gyrocompass]]es.

===Classical (Newtonian)===
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}
[[Image:PrecessionOfATop.svg|thumb|right|300px|The [[torque]] caused by the normal force – {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;}} and the weight of the top causes a change in the [[angular momentum]] {{math|'''L'''}} in the direction of that torque. This causes the top to precess.]]

Precession is the change of [[angular velocity]] and [[angular momentum]] produced by a torque. The general equation that relates the torque to the rate of change of angular momentum is:

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\tau} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{L}}{\mathrm{d}t}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\tau}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}&lt;/math&gt; are the torque and angular momentum vectors respectively.

Due to the way the torque vectors are defined, it is a vector that is perpendicular to the plane of the forces that create it. Thus it may be seen that the angular momentum vector will change perpendicular to those forces. Depending on how the forces are created, they will often rotate with the angular momentum vector, and then circular precession is created.

Under these circumstances the angular velocity of precession is given by:{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\omega_\mathrm{p} = \frac{\ mgr}{I_\mathrm{s}\boldsymbol\omega_\mathrm{s}} = \frac{ \tau}{I_\mathrm{s}\boldsymbol\omega_\mathrm{s}}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[moment of inertia]], {{math|'''''ω'''''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the angular velocity of spin about the spin axis, {{math|''m''}} is the mass, {{math|''g''}} is the acceleration due to gravity and {{math|''r''}} is the perpendicular distance of the spin axis about the axis of precession.  The torque vector originates at the center of mass. Using {{math|'''''ω''''' {{=}} {{sfrac|2π|''T''}}}}, we find that the [[Frequency|period]] of precession is given by:{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

:&lt;math&gt;T_\mathrm{p} = \frac{4\pi^2 I_\mathrm{s}}{\ mgrT_\mathrm{s}} = \frac{4\pi^2 I_\mathrm{s}}{\ \tau T_\mathrm{s}}&lt;/math&gt;

Where {{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[moment of inertia]], {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the period of spin about the spin axis, and {{math|'''''τ'''''}} is the [[torque]]&lt;!-- Torque is not introduced --&gt;. In general, the problem is more complicated than this, however.

There is an easy way to understand why gyroscopic precession occurs without using any mathematics. The behavior of a spinning object simply obeys laws of inertia by resisting any change in direction. A spinning object possesses a property known as rigidity in space, meaning the spin axis resists any change in orientation. It is the inertia of matter comprising the object as it resists any change in direction that provides this property. Of course, the direction this matter travels constantly changes as the object spins, but any further change in direction is resisted. If a force is applied to the surface of a spinning disc, for example, matter experiences no change in direction at the place the force was applied (or 180 degrees from that place). But 90 degrees before and 90 degrees after that place, matter is forced to change direction. This causes the object to behave as if the force was applied at those places instead. When a force is applied to anything, the object exerts an equal force back but in the opposite direction. Since no actual force was applied 90 degrees before or after, nothing prevents the reaction from taking place, and the object causes itself to move in response. A good way to visualize why this happens is to imagine the spinning object to be a large hollow doughnut filled with water, as described in the book "Thinking Physics" by Lewis Epstein. The doughnut is held still while water circulates inside it. As the force is applied, the water inside is caused to change direction 90 degrees before and after that point. The water then exerts its own force against the inner wall of the doughnut and causes the doughnut to rotate as if the force was applied 90 degrees ahead in the direction of rotation. Epstein exaggerates the vertical and horizontal motion of the water by changing the shape of the doughnut from round to square with rounded corners.   

Now imagine the object to be a spinning bicycle wheel, held at both ends of its axle in the hands of a subject. The wheel is spinning clock-wise as seen from a viewer to the subject’s right. Clock positions on the wheel are given relative to this viewer. As the wheel spins, the molecules comprising it are traveling exactly horizontal and to the right the instant they pass the 12-o'clock position. They then travel vertically downward the instant they pass 3 o'clock, horizontally to the left at 6 o'clock, vertically upward at 9 o’clock and horizontally to the right again at 12 o'clock. Between these positions, each molecule travels components of these directions. Now imagine the viewer applying a force to the rim of the wheel at 12 o’clock. For this example’s sake, imagine the wheel tilting over when this force is applied; it tilts to the left as seen from the subject holding it at its axle. As the wheel tilts to its new position, molecules at 12 o’clock (where the force was applied) as well as those at 6 o’clock, still travel horizontally; their direction did not change as the wheel was tilting. Nor is their direction different after the wheel settles in its new position; they still move horizontally the instant they pass 12 and 6 o’clock. BUT, molecules passing 3 and 9 o’clock were forced to change direction. Those at 3 o’clock were forced to change from moving straight downward, to downward and to the right as viewed from the subject holding the wheel. Molecules passing 9 o’clock were forced to change from moving straight upward, to upward and to the left. This change in direction is resisted by the inertia of those molecules. And when they experience this change in direction, they exert an equal and opposite force in response AT THOSE LOCATIONS-3 AND 9 O’CLOCK. At 3 o’clock, where they were forced to change from moving straight down to downward and to the right, they exert their own equal and opposite reactive force to the left. At 9 o’clock, they exert their own reactive force to the right, as viewed from the subject holding the wheel. This makes the wheel as a whole react by momentarily rotating counter-clockwise as viewed from directly above. Thus, as the force was applied at 12 o’clock, the wheel behaved as if that force was applied at 3 o’clock, which is 90 degrees ahead in the direction of spin. Or, you can say it behaved as if a force from the opposite direction was applied at 9 o'clock, 90 degrees prior to the direction of spin.

In summary, when you apply a force to a spinning object to change the direction of its spin axis, you are not changing the direction of the matter comprising the object at the place you applied the force (nor at 180 degrees from it); matter experiences zero change in direction at those places. Matter experiences the maximum change in direction 90 degrees before and 90 degrees beyond that place, and lesser amounts closer to it. The equal and opposite reaction that occurs 90 degrees before and after then causes the object to behave as it does. This principle is demonstrated in helicopters. Helicopter controls are rigged so that inputs to them are transmitted to the rotor blades at points 90 degrees prior to and 90 degrees beyond the point at which the change in aircraft attitude is desired. The effect is dramatically felt on motorcycles. A motorcycle will suddenly lean and turn in the opposite direction the handle bars are turned.  

Gyro precession causes another phenomenon for spinning objects such as the bicycle wheel in this scenario. If the subject holding the wheel removes a hand from one end of its axle, the wheel will not topple over, but will remain upright, supported at just the other end. However, it will immediately take on an additional motion; it will begin to rotate about a vertical axis, pivoting at the point of support as it continues spinning. If you allowed the wheel to continue rotating, you would have to turn your body in the same direction as the wheel rotated. If the wheel was not spinning, it would obviously topple over and fall when one hand is removed. The initial action of the wheel beginning to topple over is equivalent to applying a force to it at 12 o'clock in the direction toward the unsupported side (or a force at 6 o’clock toward the supported side). When the wheel is spinning, the sudden lack of support at one end of its axle is equivalent to this same force. So, instead of toppling over, the wheel behaves as if a continuous force is being applied to it at 3 or 9 o’clock, depending on the direction of spin and which hand was removed. This causes the wheel to begin pivoting at the one supported end of its axle while remaining upright. Although it pivots at that point, it does so only because of the fact that it is supported there; the actual axis of precessional rotation is located vertically through the wheel, passing through its center of mass. Also, this explanation does not account for the effect of variation in the speed of the spinning object; it only illustrates how the spin axis behaves due to precession. More correctly, the object behaves according to the balance of all forces based on the magnitude of the applied force, mass and rotational speed of the object. Once it is visualized why the wheel remains upright and rotates, it can easily be seen why the axis of a spinning top slowly rotates while the top spins as shown in the illustration on this page. A top behaves exactly like the bicycle wheel due to the force of gravity pulling downward. The point of contact with the surface it spins on is equivalent to the end of the axle the wheel is supported at. As the top's spin slows, the reactive force that keeps it upright due to inertia is overcome by gravity. Once the reason for gyro precession is visualized, the mathematical formulas start to make sense. 

===Relativistic (Einsteinian) ===
The special and general theories of [[Theory of relativity|relativity]] give three types of corrections to the Newtonian precession, of a gyroscope near a large mass such as Earth, described above. They are:
* [[Thomas precession]] a special relativistic correction accounting for the observer's being in a rotating non-inertial frame.
* [[Geodetic effect|de Sitter precession]] a general relativistic correction accounting for the Schwarzschild metric of curved space near a large non-rotating mass.
* [[Lense–Thirring precession]] a general relativistic correction accounting for the frame dragging by the Kerr metric of curved space near a large rotating mass.

== Astronomy ==

In astronomy, precession refers to any of several gravity-induced, slow and continuous changes in an astronomical body's rotational axis or orbital path. Precession of the equinoxes, perihelion precession, changes in the [[Axial tilt#Earth|tilt of Earth's axis]] to its orbit, and the [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of its orbit over tens of thousands of years are all important parts of the astronomical theory of [[ice age]]s. ''(See [[Milankovitch cycles]].)''

=== Axial precession (precession of the equinoxes) ===
{{Main article|Axial precession}}

Axial precession is the movement of the rotational axis of an astronomical body, whereby the axis slowly traces out a cone. In the case of Earth, this type of precession is also known as the ''precession of the equinoxes'', ''lunisolar precession'', or ''precession of the equator''. Earth goes through one such complete precessional cycle in a period of approximately 26,000 years or 1° every 72 years, during which the positions of stars will slowly change in both [[equatorial coordinates]] and [[ecliptic longitude]]. Over this cycle, Earth's north axial pole moves from where it is now, within 1° of [[Polaris]], in a circle around the [[ecliptic pole]], with an angular radius of about 23.5°.

The [[Greek astronomy|ancient Greek astronomer]] [[Hipparchus]] (c. 190-120 BC) is claimed to be the earliest known astronomer to recognize and assess the precession of the equinoxes at about 1° per century (which is not far from the actual value for antiquity, 1.38°).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dioi.org/vols/w91.pdf DIO 9.1 ‡3]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Caltech]]'s Swerdlow disputes Hipparchus's knowledge of precession because Hipparchus apparently did not necessarily indicate anything like a motion of the entire sphere of the fixed stars with respect to the equinoxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The gravitational [[tidal force]]s of the [[Moon]] and [[Sun]] apply torque to the equator, attempting to pull the [[equatorial bulge]] into the plane of the [[ecliptic]], but instead causing it to precess. The torque exerted by the planets, particularly [[Jupiter]], also plays a role.&lt;ref name="Bradt"&gt;

===Apsidal precession===
[[File:Precessing Kepler orbit 280frames e0.6 smaller.gif|thumb|[[Apsidal precession]]—the orbit rotates gradually over time.]]
{{main|Apsidal precession}}

The [[orbit]]s of planets around the [[Sun]] do not really follow an identical ellipse each time, but actually trace out a flower-petal shape because the major axis of each planet's elliptical orbit also precesses within its orbital plane, partly in response to perturbations in the form of the changing gravitational forces exerted by other planets. This is called [[apsidal precession|perihelion precession or apsidal precession]].

In the adjunct image, Earth's apsidal precession is illustrated. As the Earth travels around the Sun, its elliptical orbit rotates gradually over time. The eccentricity of its ellipse and the precession rate of its orbit are exaggerated for visualization. Most orbits in the Solar System have a much smaller eccentricity and precess at a much slower rate, making them nearly circular and stationary.

Discrepancies between the observed perihelion precession rate of the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and that predicted by [[classical mechanics]] were prominent among the forms of experimental evidence leading to the acceptance of [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[Theory of Relativity]] (in particular, his [[General relativity|General Theory of Relativity]]), which accurately predicted the anomalies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Born]] (1924), ''Einstein's Theory of Relativity'' (The 1962 Dover edition, page 348 lists a table documenting the observed and calculated values for the precession of the perihelion of Mercury, Venus, and Earth.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailygalaxy.com/my_weblog/2008/03/18-billion-suns.html An even larger value for a precession has been found, for a black hole in orbit around a much more massive black hole, amounting to 39 degrees each orbit.]&lt;/ref&gt; Deviating from Newton's law, Einstein's theory of gravitation predicts an extra term of {{math|{{sfrac|''A''|''r''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}}}}, which accurately gives the observed excess turning rate of 43″ every 100 years.

The gravitational force between the Sun and moon induces the precession in Earth's orbit, which is the major cause of the climate oscillation of Earth that has a period of 19,000 to 23,000 years. It follows that changes in Earth's orbital parameters (e.g., orbital inclination, the angle between Earth's rotation axis and its plane of orbit) is important to the study of Earth's climate, in particular to the study of past ice ages.

'''Regulation on Wholesale Energy Market Integrity and Transparency''' ('''REMIT''') is an [[Regulation (European Union)|EU regulation]] designed to increase the [[Transparency (market)|transparency]] and [[Economic stability|stability]] of the European energy markets while combating [[insider trading]] and [[market manipulation]]. REMIT was adopted in the [[European Union]] in 2011. Part of the regulation went into immediate effect in all [[Member state of the European Union|EU member states]], with some obligations around registration and transaction reporting only coming into effect once the REMIT Implementing Acts have been passed. The EU agency [[Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators|ACER]] has been tasked with the supervision and regulation of energy markets in accordance with REMIT.

== EU Legislation ==
In October 2011, the [[European Parliament]] and the [[European Council]] adopted Regulation (EU) No. 1227/2011, '''R'''egulation on Wholesale '''E'''nergy '''M'''arket '''I'''ntegrity and '''T'''ransparency (REMIT). REMIT entered into force on 28 December 2011, twenty days after publication in the EU Official Journal.

The collection of transactions on the wholesale energy market as prescribed in Article 8 data is not yet implemented. Transaction reporting will begin nine months after the publication of the REMIT Implementing Acts, which happened on December 18, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=OJ:JOL_2014_363_R_0009&amp;from=EN  Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1348/2014 of 17 December 2014 on data reporting implementing Article 8(2) and Article 8(6) of Regulation (EU) No 1227/2011]''. In: ''Official Journal of the European Union'', L336 (December 18, 2014), p. 121-142.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus initially, REMIT is limited to the prohibition and mandatory reporting of insider trading and market manipulation, as well as the obligation to publish inside information.

In preparation of the Implementing Acts, the EU Directorate-General responsible for the regulation, [[Directorate-General for Energy (European Commission)|DG Energy]], commissioned a market consultation and report on the implementation of a data and transaction reporting Framework for REMIT in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/energy/gas_electricity/consultations/20121207_wholesale_energy_markets_en.htm Implementation of a Data and Transaction reporting Framework for Wholesale Energy Markets], Consultation period from  September 14, 2012  to  December 07, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content of REMIT ==
REMIT has four main elements:&lt;ref name="Regulation-1227/2011"&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:326:0001:0016:EN:PDF Regulation (EU) No. 1227/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2011 on wholesale energy market integrity and transparency (REMIT)], ''Official Journal of the European Union'', L326 (December 08, 2011), p. 1-16.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Prohibition of insider trading (Article 3) and of market manipulation (Article 5)
* Obligation of market participants to register with their competent National Regulatory Agency (Article 9)
* Obligation of market participants to report wholesale energy market transactions (Article 8) and to publish insider information (Article 4)
* Authorisation of ACER to implement REMIT, in particular to monitor the market (Article 7), to collect transaction reports (Article 8) and to register market participants (Article 9)

The REMIT definition of a "market participant" applies to any [[Legal personality|legal]] or [[natural person]] carrying out transactions in wholesale energy products. In particular, the definition encompasses energy traders, [[transmission system operator]]s, regulated exchanges for electricity or gas markets and energy brokers.&lt;ref&gt;Regulation (EU) No. 1227/2011 (REMIT), ''Official Journal of the European Union'', Article 2 (7), L326 (December 08, 2011), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The REMIT definition of "wholesale energy products" includes physical and financial contracts for electricity or for natural gas where delivery is in the European Union. In particular, the definition includes the supply, transportation contracts and derivative transactions, such as options or swaps. Supply and distribution contracts to consumers and industrial clients consuming less than 600 GWh per year are excluded from REMIT. Transactions already reported under [[European Market Infrastructure Regulation|EMIR]] do not have to be reported again under REMIT.&lt;ref&gt;Regulation (EU) No. 1227/2011 (REMIT), ''Official Journal of the European Union'', Article 2 (4), L326 (December 08, 2011), p. 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The reporting of wholesale energy market transactions is mandatory for both parties to the transaction, seller and buyer. The resulting records can be linked by ACER using the [[Unique Transaction Identifier]] (UTI), which is a field in the report being unique in the market and identical for both sides of the report. In practice, this requirement is difficult to fulfill for purely bilateral transactions.

== REMIT in national law ==
As an [[Regulation (European Union)|EU regulation]], REMIT comes into force directly in all EU Member States. However, enforcement and sanctioning of possible violations remains the responsibility of Member States. Accordingly, the competencies of national regulatory authorities (NRAs) and the nature of sanctions have to be legislated in national law. In 2014, the [[Council of European Energy Regulators]] (CEER) issued a report on the implementation of REMIT at national level. The report concluded that no more than ″a majority of Member States have completed the transposition of Articles 13 and 18 of REMIT into national law in order to ensure that NRAs have the foreseen investigatory and enforcement powers, and that a sanctioning regime is in place.″&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceer.eu/portal/page/portal/EER_HOME/EER_PUBLICATIONS/CEER_PAPERS/Cross-Sectoral/2014/C14-MIT-55-03_REMIT_CEER%20Memo_final_18092014.pdf CEER memo on REMIT implementation at national level], Ref. C14-MIT-55-03, 18 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6829">'''Samuel Birley Rowbotham''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|oʊ|b|ɒ|t|ə|m}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EPD|18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1816 – 23 December 1884, London) was an English inventor and writer who wrote ''Zetetic Astronomy: Earth Not a Globe'' under the [[pseudonym]] '''Parallax'''. His work was originally published as a 16-page pamphlet (1849), which he later expanded into a 430-page book (1881). He dropped out of school at the age of 9.

Rowbotham's method, which he called [[modern flat Earth societies|zetetic astronomy]], models the [[Earth]] as an [[flat Earth|enclosed plane]] centered at the [[North Pole]] and bounded along its perimeter by a wall of ice, with the [[Sun]], [[Moon]], planets, and stars moving only several hundred miles above the surface of Earth.

==Life==
Rowbotham started out as an organiser of an [[Owenism|Owenite commune]] in [[The Fens]], where he formulated his theories about the Earth. After measuring a lack of curvature on the long straight drainage ditches of the [[Old Bedford River|Bedford Levels]] in his first [[Bedford Level experiment]], he was convinced of the flatness of the Earth and began to lecture on the topic. He took a little time to learn his trade, running away from a lecture in [[Blackburn]] when he couldn't explain why the hulls of ships disappeared before their masts when sailing out to sea.&lt;ref name=demorgan &gt;{{cite book|title=[[Augustus De Morgan#Selected writings|A Budget of Paradoxes]]|volume=II|last=De Morgan|first=Augustus|authorlink=Augustus De Morgan|year=1872|chapter=Zetetic Astronomy|chapter-url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/26408/26408-h/26408-h.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as he persisted in filling halls by charging sixpence a lecture, his quick-wittedness and debating skills were honed so much that he could "counter every argument with ingenuity, wit and consummate skill".&lt;ref name=garwood&gt;{{harvnb|Garwood|2007|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When finally pinned down to a challenge in [[Plymouth]] in 1864 by allegations that he wouldn't agree to a test, Parallax appeared on [[Plymouth Hoe]] at the appointed time, witnessed by [[Richard A. Proctor]], a writer on astronomy, and proceeded to the beach where a telescope had been set up. His opponents had claimed that only the lantern of the [[Eddystone Lighthouse]], some 14 miles out to sea, would be visible. In fact, only half the lantern was visible, yet Rowbotham claimed his opponents were wrong and that it proved the Earth was indeed flat so that many Plymouth folk left the Hoe agreeing that "some of the most important conclusions of modern astronomy had been seriously invalidated".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Garwood|2007|pp=56–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1861, Rowbotham married for a second time (to the 16-year-old daughter of his laundress) and settled in London, producing 14 children, of whom four survived. He was also alleged to be using the name "Dr. Samuel Birley", living in a beautiful 12-roomed house, selling the secrets for prolonging human life and curing every disease imaginable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Garwood|2007|pp=132, 149}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Augustus De Morgan]] refers to him as S. Goulden.&lt;ref name=demorgan /&gt; He patented a number of inventions, including a "life-preserving cylindrical railway carriage".

His book ''Zetetic Astronomy: The Earth not a Globe'' appeared in 1864. His lectures continued and concerned citizens addressed letters to the [[Astronomer Royal]] seeking rebuttals for his claims. A correspondent to the Leeds Times observed that "One thing he did demonstrate was that scientific dabblers unused to platform advocacy are unable to cope with a man, a charlatan if you will (but clever and thoroughly up in his theory), thoroughly alive to the weakness of his opponents".&lt;ref&gt;Leeds Times, 11 May 1867, p.8. quoted by {{harvnb|Garwood|2007|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
One of Rowbotham's followers, John Hampden, a Christian polemicist, gained notoriety by engaging in raucous public debates with leading scientists of the day. A bet involving the prominent naturalist [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] in the famous [[Bedford Level experiment]] led to several lawsuits for fraud and libel and Hampden's imprisonment.

After Rowbotham's death, Lady Elizabeth Blount founded the ''Universal Zetetic Society'', which attracted thousands of followers, published a magazine entitled ''The Earth Not a Globe Review'' and remained active well into the early part of the 20th century. After World War I, the movement underwent a slow decline, but it was revived in 1956 as [[Modern flat Earth societies|The Flat Earth Society]].

In the United States, Rowbotham's ideas were taken up by the [[Christ Community Church|Christian Catholic Apostolic Church]] and promoted widely on their radio station. His work in the United States was continued by [[William Carpenter (flat Earth theorist)|William Carpenter]]. Carpenter, a printer originally from [[Greenwich]], [[England]], a supporter of Rowbotham and published ''Theoretical Astronomy Examined and Exposed&amp;nbsp;— Proving the Earth not a Globe'' in eight parts from 1864 under the name ''Common Sense''. He later emigrated to [[Baltimore]] where he published ''A hundred proofs the Earth is not a Globe'' in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;William Carpenter, ''One hundred proofs that the earth is not a globe'', (Baltimore: The author, 1885).{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/lclane2/hundreda.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-08 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308062134/http://www.geocities.com/lclane2/hundreda.html |archivedate=March 8, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
He argues that:
*"There are rivers that flow for hundreds of miles towards the level of the sea without falling more than a few feet&amp;nbsp;— notably, the Nile, which, in a thousand miles, falls but a foot. A level expanse of this extent is quite incompatible with the idea of the Earth's convexity. It is, therefore, a reasonable proof that Earth is not a globe."
*"If the Earth were a globe, a small model globe would be the very best&amp;nbsp;— because the truest&amp;nbsp;— thing for the navigator to take to sea with him. But such a thing as that is not known: with such a toy as a guide, the mariner would wreck his ship, of a certainty!, This is a proof that Earth is not a globe."

The '''second voyage of James Cook''', from 1772 to 1775, commissioned by the British government with advice from the [[Royal Society]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|2004|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; was designed to [[circumnavigate]] the globe as far south as possible to finally determine whether there was any great southern landmass, or [[Terra Australis]]. On his [[First voyage of James Cook|first voyage]], [[James Cook|Cook]] had demonstrated by circumnavigating [[New Zealand]] that it was not attached to a larger landmass to the south, and he charted almost the entire eastern coastline of [[Australia]], yet Terra Australis was believed to lie further south. [[Alexander Dalrymple]] and others of the Royal Society still believed that this massive southern continent should exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hough|1994|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a delay brought about by the botanist [[Joseph Banks]]' unreasonable demands, the ships ''[[HMS Resolution (1771)|Resolution]]'' and ''[[HMS Adventure (1771)|Adventure]]'' were fitted for the voyage and set sail for the [[Antarctic]] in July 1772.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Journal of Captain Cook's voyage round the world in HMS Resolution|url=http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-JOD-00020/29|publisher=Cambridge Digital Library|accessdate=23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 January 1773, ''Resolution'' was the first ship to cross the [[Antarctic Circle]]  which she crossed twice more on the voyage. The third crossing, on 3 February 1774, was to be the most southerly penetration, reaching latitude 71°10′&amp;nbsp;South at longitude 106°54′&amp;nbsp;West. Cook undertook a series of vast sweeps across the [[Pacific]], finally proving there was no Terra Australis by sailing over most of its predicted locations.

In the course of the voyage he visited [[Easter Island]], the [[Marquesas]], [[Tahiti]], the [[Society Islands]], [[Niue]], the [[Tonga Islands]], the [[New Hebrides]], [[New Caledonia]], [[Norfolk Island]], [[Palmerston Island]], [[South Sandwich Islands]], and [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]], many of which he named in the process. Cook proved the Terra Australis Incognita to be a myth&lt;ref name="Hough1994"&gt;{{harvnb|Hough|1994|p=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and predicted that an [[Antarctic]] land would be found beyond the ice barrier.

On this voyage the [[Larcum Kendall#K1|Larcum Kendall K1]] [[marine chronometer|chronometer]] was successfully employed by [[William Wales (astronomer)|William Wales]] to calculate longitude.  Wales compiled a log book of the voyage, recording locations and conditions, the use and testing of various instruments, as well as making many observations of the people and places encountered on the voyage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wales|first=William|title=Log book of HMS 'Resolution'|url=http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-RGO-00014-00058|publisher=Cambridge Digital Library|accessdate=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conception==
[[File:Terraaustralis.jpg|thumb|left|Map of the supposed position of the hypothetical continent of [[Terra Australis]] Incognita (1657) ]]
In 1752 a member of the  [[Royal Society of London]], [[Alexander Dalrymple]], had found [[Luis Váez de Torres]]' testimony proving the existence of a passage south of [[New Guinea]] now known as [[Torres Strait]], whilst translating some Spanish documents captured in the Philippines. This discovery led Dalrymple to publish  ''An Historical Collection of the Several Voyages and Discoveries in the South Pacific Ocean.''&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.org/stream/cihm_35630#page/n7/mode/2up An Historical Collection of the Several Voyages and Discoveries in the South Pacific Ocean]'', vol 1, on Archive.org&lt;/ref&gt; in 1770–1771 which aroused widespread interest in his claim of the existence of an unknown continent. Soon after his return from his first voyage in 1771, Commander Cook was commissioned by the Royal Society to make a second voyage in search of the supposed southern continent, [[Terra Australis|Terra Australis Incognita]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rigby|van der Merwe|2002|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparation and personnel==

===Vessels and provisions===
Cook commanded [[HMS Resolution (1771)|HMS ''Resolution'']] on this voyage, while [[Tobias Furneaux]] commanded its companion ship, [[HMS Adventure (1771)|HMS ''Adventure'']]. ''Resolution''  began her career as the 462 ton [[North Sea]] [[Collier (ship type)|collier]] ''Marquis of Granby'', launched at [[Whitby]] in 1770, purchased by the Royal Navy in 1771 for £4,151, and converted to naval specifications for a cost of £6,565. She was {{convert|111|ft|m}} long and {{convert|35|ft|m}} abeam. She was originally registered as HMS ''Drake'', but fearing this would upset the Spanish, she was  renamed ''Resolution'', on 25 December 1771. She was fitted out at [[Deptford]] with the most advanced navigational aids of the day, including an [[azimuth compass]] made by [[Henry Gregory (instrument maker)|Henry Gregory]], ice anchors and the latest apparatus for distilling fresh water from sea water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Log book of HMS 'Resolution'|url=http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-RGO-00014-00058/15|publisher=Cambridge Digital Library|accessdate=23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twelve light 6-pounder guns and twelve [[swivel gun]]s were carried. At his own expense Cook had brass door-hinges installed in the great cabin.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Villiers|1967|p=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HMS ''Adventure'' began her career as the 340 ton [[North Sea]] [[Collier (ship type)|collier]] ''Marquis of Rockingham'', launched at [[Whitby]] in 1771. She was purchased by the Navy that year for £2,103 and named ''Rayleigh'', then renamed ''Adventure''. She was {{convert|97|ft|m}} long, {{convert|28|ft|m}} abeam and her draft was {{convert|13|ft|m}} and carried ten guns. Both were built at the [[Fishburn yard]] at [[Whitby]] and purchased from Captain William Hammond of [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beaglehole|1974|p=281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cook was asked to test the [[Larcum Kendall]] K1 [[Marine chronometer|chronometer]] on this voyage. The [[Board of Longitude]] had asked Kendall to copy and develop [[John Harrison]]'s fourth model of a [[clock]] (H4) useful for navigation at sea. The first model finished by Kendall in 1769 was an accurate copy of H4, cost £450, and is known today as K1. Although constructed like a watch, the chronometer had a diameter of 13&amp;nbsp;cm and weighed 1.45&amp;nbsp;kg. Three other clocks, constructed by [[John Arnold (watchmaker)|John Arnold]] were carried but did not withstand the rigors of the journey.&lt;ref name="Villiers1967"&gt;{{harvnb|Villiers|1967|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; The performance of the clocks was recorded in the logbooks of astronomers [[William Wales (astronomer)|William Wales]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wales|first=William|title=Log book of HMS 'Resolution'|url=http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-RGO-00014-00058|publisher=Cambridge Digital Library|accessdate=6 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[William Bayly (astronomer)|William Bayly]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bayly|first=William|title=Log book of HMS Adventure|url=http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-RGO-00014-00056|publisher=Cambridge Digital Library|accessdate=6 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and as early as 1772 Wales had noted that the watch by Kendall was 'infinitely more to be depended on'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wales|first=William|title=Log book of HMS 'Resolution'|url=http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-RGO-00014-00058/17|publisher=Cambridge Digital Library|accessdate=6 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Provisions loaded onto the vessels for the voyage included {{convert|59,531|lb|kg}} of biscuit, 7,637 four-lb (appox 1,8&amp;nbsp;kg) pieces  of salt beef, 14,214 two-lb (approx 1&amp;nbsp;kg) pieces of salt pork, 19 [[Tun (unit)|tuns]] of beer, {{convert|1,397|impgal|l}} of spirits {{convert|1,900|lb|kg}} of suet and 210 gallons of 'Oyle Olive'. As [[anti-scorbutic]]s they took nearly {{convert|20,000|lb|kg}} of [[Sauerkraut|'Sour Krout']] and {{convert|30|impgal|l}} of 'Mermalade of Carrots'.{{refn|group=n|The recipe was given to him by [[Baron Storsch]].&lt;ref&gt;https://fair.alia.org.au/carrot-marmalade-muddle-cake-and-potatoe-puffs&lt;/ref&gt;}} Both ships carried livestock, including bullocks, sheep, goats (for milk), hogs and poultry (including geese). The crews had fishing gear (supplied by [[Onesimus Ustonson]])&lt;ref name="yorkshirepost1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Hello |url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/fishing-reel-proves-prize-catch-at-auction-1-2463582 |title=Fishing reel proves prize catch at auction |publisher=Yorkshire Post |date=11 July 2007 |accessdate=8 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[evaporator (marine)|water purification system]] was carried for distilling sea-water or purifying foul fresh-water. Various pieces of hardware (such as knives and axes) and trinkets (beads, ribbons, medallions) to be used for barter or as gifts for the natives were also taken aboard.&lt;ref name="Villiers1967" /&gt;

===Ships' companions===
[[File:Tobias Furneaux.jpg|framed|left|Tobias Furneaux]]

Furneaux, commander of ''Adventure'', was an experienced explorer, having served on [[Samuel Wallis]]'s [[circumnavigation]] in [[HMS Dolphin (1751)|''Dolphin'']] in 1766–1768. He headed a crew of 81 which included Joseph Shank as first lieutenant, and Arthur Kempe as second lieutenant. There were also twelve marines headed by Lieutenant James Scott, Furneaux's personal servant, James Tobias Swilley, and, as master's mate John Rowe who was a relation of Furneaux. The ship's astronomer was William Bayly.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

It was originally planned that the [[natural history|naturalist]] [[Joseph Banks]] and what he considered to be an appropriate entourage would sail with Cook, so a heightened waist, an additional upper deck and a raised [[poop deck]] were built on ''Resolution'' to suit Banks.  This refit cost {{nowrap|£10,080 12s 9d}}.  However, in sea trials the ship was found to be top-heavy, and under Admiralty instructions the offending structures were removed in a second refit at Sheerness, at a further cost of {{nowrap|£882 3s 0d}}. Banks subsequently refused to travel under the resulting "adverse conditions." The writer [[Samuel Johnson]] was briefly considered as a replacement, but declined the offer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Mill | first =Hugh Robert | title =The Romance of the Antarctic Seas | journal =Geography | volume =21 | issue =3 | page =187 | publisher =Geographic Association | date =September 1936 | jstor =40559844 | doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead the position was taken by [[Johann Reinhold Forster]] and his son, [[Georg Forster|Georg]], who were taken on as Royal Society scientists for the voyage. ''Resolution'' carried a crew of 112; as senior lieutenants Robert Cooper and [[Charles Clerke]] and among the midshipmen [[George Vancouver]] and [[James Burney]]. The master was [[Joseph Gilbert (Royal Navy)|Joseph Gilbert]] and Isaac Smith, a relation of Cook's wife was also aboard. [[William Wales (astronomer)|William Wales]] was the astronomer and [[William Hodges]] the artist. In all, there were 90 seamen and 18 royal marines as well as the supernumeraries.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

==Voyage==
[[File:Cook'sSecondVoyage53.png|center|thumb|600px|The route of Cook's second voyage]]
Cook’s second voyage of discovery departed [[Plymouth Sound]] on Monday 13 July 1772. His first port of call was at [[Funchal]] in the [[Madeira Islands]], which he reached on 1 August. Cook gave high praise to his ship's sailing qualities in a report to the Admiralty from Funchal Roads, writing that she "steers, works, sails well and is remarkably stiff and seems to promise to be a dry and very easy ship in the sea."&lt;ref name="Hough1994" /&gt; The ship was re-provisioned with fresh water, beef, fruit and onions, and after a further provisioning stop in the [[Cape Verde Islands]] two weeks later, set sail due south toward the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. The ''Resolution'' anchored in [[Table Bay]] on 30 October with the crew all in good health because of Cook's imposition of a strict dietary and cleanliness regime. It was here that a Swede, [[Anders Erikson Sparrman|Anders Sparrman]] joined the expedition as a botanist.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hough|1994|p=242}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cook in Antarctica.jpg|thumb|Cook in Antarctica drawn by [[William Hodges]]]]
The ships left the Cape on 22 November 1772 and headed for the area of the South Atlantic where the French navigator [[Jean-Baptiste Charles Bouvet de Lozier|Bouvet]]  claimed to have spotted land that he named Cape Circumcision. Shortly after leaving they experienced severe cold weather and early on 23 November 1772 the crew were issued with ''fearnaught'' jackets and trousers at the expense of the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wales|first=William|title=Log book of HMS 'Resolution'|url=http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-RGO-00014-00058/20|publisher=Cambridge Digital Library|accessdate=29 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By early December they were sailing in thick fog and seeing 'ice islands'. Cook had not found the island that Bouvet claimed to be in latitude 54°. Pack ice soon surrounded the ships but in the second week in January, in the southern mid-summer, the weather abated and Cook was able to take the ships southwards through the ice to reach the Antarctic Circle on 17 January. The next day, being severely impeded by the ice, they changed course and headed away to the north-east.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hough|1994|p=248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 February 1773 ''Resolution'' and ''Adventure''  became separated in the Antarctic fog. Furneaux directed ''Adventure'' towards the prearranged meeting point of [[Queen Charlotte Sound (New Zealand)]], charted by Cook in 1770. On the way to the rendezvous, ''Adventure'' surveyed the southern and eastern coasts of [[Tasmania]] (then known as "[[Van Diemen's Land]]"), where [[Adventure Bay, Tasmania|Adventure Bay]] was named for the ship. Furneaux made the earliest British chart of this shore, but as he did not enter [[Bass Strait]] he assumed Tasmania to be part of [[Australia]]. ''Adventure'' arrived at Queen Charlotte Sound on 7 May 1773.
Cook continued his explorations south-eastwards, reaching 61°21′s on 24 February then, in mid-March he decided to head for Dusky Bay (now [[Dusky Sound]]) in the South Island of New Zealand where the ship rested until 30 April. The ''Resolution'' reached the rendezvous at Queen Charlotte Sound on 17 May.&lt;ref name="Van2002"&gt;{{harvnb|Rigby|van der Merwe|2002|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;
From June to October the two ships explored the southern Pacific, reaching [[Tahiti]] on 15 August, where [[Omai]] of [[Ra'iatea]] embarked on ''Adventure''. (Omai later became one of the first Pacific Islanders to visit Europe, before returning to Tahiti with Cook in 1776.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Salmond | first = Anne | author-link = Anne Salmond | title = The Trial of the Cannibal Dog | place = New Haven, CT | publisher = Yale University Press | year = 2003 | url = https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300100921/trial-cannibal-dog | isbn = 978-0-300-10092-1 | page = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hodges, Resolution and Adventure in Matavai Bay.jpg|thumb|Resolution and Adventure in [[Matavai Bay]], by Hodges]]

After calling at [[Tonga]] in the [[Friendly Islands]] the ships returned to New Zealand but were separated by a storm on 22 October. This time the rendezvous at Queen Charlotte Sound was missed — ''Resolution'' departed on 26 November, four days before ''Adventure'' arrived. Cook had left a message buried in the sand setting out his plan to explore the South Pacific and return to New Zealand. Furneaux decided to return home and buried a reply to that effect. In New Zealand Furneaux lost some of his men during an encounter with [[Māori people|Māori]], and eventually sailed back to Britain, setting out for home on 22 December 1773 via [[Cape Horn]], arriving in England on 14 July 1774.&lt;ref name="Van2002" /&gt;

Cook continued to explore the Antarctic, heading south into the summer sea ice, icebergs and fog until he reached 67°31′&amp;nbsp;South before hauling north again for {{convert|2200|km|mi|order=flip}}. The third crossing of the Antarctic Circle, on 26 January 1774, was the precursor to the most southerly penetration, reaching latitude 71°10′&amp;nbsp;South at longitude 106°54′&amp;nbsp;West on 30 January when they could go no further because of the solid sea ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rigby|van der Merwe|2002|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; On this occasion, Cook wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I who had ambition not only to go farther than anyone had been before, but as far as it was possible for man to go, was not sorry in meeting with this interruption...&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The vessel was then launched north to complete a huge arc in the Pacific Ocean, reaching latitudes just below the Equator then New Guinea.  He had landed at the [[Tonga|Friendly Islands]], [[Easter Island]], [[Norfolk Island]], [[New Caledonia]], and [[Vanuatu]] before returning to Queen Charlotte Sound in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rigby|van der Merwe|2002|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Homeward voyage==
On 10 November 1774 the expedition sailed east over the Pacific and sighted the western end of the Strait of Magellan on 17 December. They spent Christmas in a bay they named ''Christmas Sound'' on the western side of [[Tierra del Fuego]]. After passing Cape Horn, Cook explored the vast South Atlantic looking for another coastline that had been predicted by Dalrymple. When this failed to materialize they turned north and discovered an island that they named [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]]. In a last vain attempt to find [[Bouvet Island]] Cook discovered the [[South Sandwich Islands]]. Here he correctly predicted that: &lt;blockquote&gt; ...there is a tract of land near the Pole, which is the Source of most of the ice which is spread over this vast Southern Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2006/12/south-sandwich/did-you-know-learn | title=South Sandwich – Did You Know? | magazine=[[National Geographic]] | first=Kathy B. | last=Maher | date=December 2002 | accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later, in February 1775, he called the existence of such a polar continent "probable" and in another copy of his journal he wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;"[I] '''firmly believe''' it and its '''more than''' probable that we have seen a part of it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Beaglehole |first1=J.C. |title=Cook, Journals, vol.2 |date=1968 |publisher=Hakluyt Society |location=Cambridge |isbn=9781472453242 |page=643, n.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 21 March 1775 ''Resolution'' anchored in Table Bay, there to spend five weeks as her rigging was refitted. She arrived home at [[Spithead]], Portsmouth on 30 July 1775 having visited [[St Helena]] and [[Fernando de Noronha]] on the way.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collingridge|2002|p=311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return home==
His reports upon his return home put to rest the popular myth of Terra Australis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hough|1994|p=263}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another accomplishment of the second voyage was the successful employment of the [[Larcum Kendall#K1|Larcum Kendall K1]] [[marine chronometer|chronometer]], which enabled Cook to calculate his [[longitude|longitudinal position]] with much greater accuracy. Cook's log was full of praise for the watch which he used to make charts of the southern Pacific Ocean that were so remarkably accurate that copies of them were still in use in the mid-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.nmm.ac.uk/upload/package/30/links-cook.php | title =Captain James Cook: His voyages of exploration and the men that accompanied him | publisher =[[National Maritime Museum]] | accessdate =10 October 2007 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070421232853/http://www.nmm.ac.uk/upload/package/30/links-cook.php | archivedate =21 April 2007 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cook was promoted to the rank of [[Captain (Royal Navy)|captain]] and given an honorary retirement from the Royal Navy, as an officer in the [[Old Royal Naval College#Greenwich Hospital|Greenwich Hospital]]. His acceptance of the post was reluctant, insisting that he be allowed to quit the post if the opportunity for active duty presented itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beaglehole|1974|p=444}}&lt;/ref&gt; His fame now extended beyond the Admiralty and he was also made a [[Royal Society|Fellow of the Royal Society]] and awarded the [[Copley Medal|Copley Gold Medal]], painted by [[Nathaniel Dance-Holland]], dined with [[James Boswell]] and described in the [[House of Lords]] as "the first navigator in Europe".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collingridge|2002|pp=334–335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication of journals==
[[File:Forsterundsohn.jpg|right|thumb|[[Johann Reinhold Forster]] and his son, [[Georg Forster|Georg]]]]
On his return to England, Forster claimed that he had been granted exclusive publication rights to the history of the voyage by the First Lord of the Admiralty, [[John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich|Lord Sandwich]]—a claim that Sandwich vehemently denied. Cook was writing his own account assisted by Dr John Douglas, Canon of Windsor. Eventually, Sandwich agreed that Forster and his son could add a scientific section to Cook's account of the voyage. This led to so much animosity between Forster and Sandwich that Sandwich banned him from writing or publishing anything about the voyage. Forster then avoided the ban by writing a book in his son's name using a draft of Cook's journal which he had earlier acquired.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} When Forster published his book, six weeks before Cook's own account, it was found to be highly critical of Cook and other members of the voyage, inaccurate and somewhat fabricated.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}  Cook never read the book because it was published after he left on his third voyage.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hough|1994|p=322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Cook's accounts of the large seal and whale populations  helped influence further exploration of the Southern Ocean from sealers in search of the mammals' valued skins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.antarcticaonline.com/history/history.htm |title=Antarctic History |year=2006|accessdate=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century over one thousand sealing ships travelled to the Antarctic regions and its shoreline.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

The '''Shatsky Rise''' is Earth's third largest [[oceanic plateau]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Geldmacher|van den Bogaard|Heydolph|Hoernle|2014|loc=Geological background and Exp. 324 drilling results, p. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; (after [[Ontong Java Plateau|Ontong Java]] and [[Kerguelen Plateau|Kerguelen]]) located in the north-west [[Pacific Ocean]] {{Convert|1500|km|abbr=on}} east of [[Japan]].  It is one of a series of Pacific Cretaceous [[large igneous province]]s (LIPs) together with [[Hess Rise]], [[Magellan Rise (oceanic plateau)|Magellan Rise]], and [[Ontong-Java Plateau|Ontong Java]]-[[Manihiki Plateau|Manihiki]]-[[Hikurangi Plateau|Hikurangi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ingle|Mahoney|Sato|Coffin|2007|loc=Fig. 1a, p. 595}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was named for [[Nikolay Shatsky]] (1895-1960), a Soviet geologist, expert in tectonics of ancient platforms.

The rise consists of three large volcanic massifs, Tamu, Ori, and Shirshov, but, in contrast, there are few traces of magmatism on the surrounding ocean floor.&lt;ref name="Sager-2005-TecHist"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sager|2005|loc=Tectonic History, pp. 725–726}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Tamu Massif]] may be the largest volcano yet discovered on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sager|Zhang|Korenaga|Sano|2013|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extent and volume==
It covers an area that has been estimated to {{Circa}} {{Convert|480000|km2|abbr=on}} (roughly the size of [[California]] or [[Sumatra]]) and a volume of {{Circa}} {{Convert|4300000|km3|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Sager-2005-Intro"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sager|2005|loc=Introduction, pp. 720–721}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Beneath Shatsky rise, however, the [[Mohorovičić discontinuity]] (Moho, the mantle-crust boundary) disappears at a depth of {{Convert|20|km|abbr=on}} whereas it is normally observed at a depth of {{Convert|17|km|abbr=on}}.  Furthermore, the crustal thickness between the massifs of the Shatsky Rise is almost twice that of normal crust thickness.  This considered, the area covered by the rise, assuming the crust was also formed by the Shatsky Rise volcanism, has been estimated to {{Convert|533000|km2|abbr=on}} and the volume to {{Convert|6900000|km3|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Zhang|Sager|Korenaga|2016|loc=Abstract; Conclusions, p. 152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsidence==
After its formation Shatsky Rise was uplifted {{Convert|2500|-|3500|m|abbr=on}} and it then subsided {{Convert|2600|-|3400|m|abbr=on}}, which, in both cases, is considerably more than in the case the Ontong-Java Plateau.  There was least subsidence at the centre of the Tamu Massif ({{Circa}} {{Convert|2600|m|abbr=on}}), subsidence increased at the northern flank of the Tamu Massif and at the Ori Massif ({{Circa}} {{Convert|3300|m|abbr=on}}), and it becomes greatest at the flank of Ori Massif.  The cause of this gradual increase in subsidence can be [[Magmatic underplating|underplating]] beneath Tamu Massif.  There was much less subsidence at Shirshov Massif farther north ({{Circa}} {{Convert|2900|m|abbr=on}}) which probably represents a later, different phase of volcanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shimizu|Shimizu|Sano|Matsubara|2013|loc=Subsidence of Shatsky Rise, pp. 42–43; Conclusions, pp. 43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin controversy==
Scientific studies of the size, shape, and eruption rate of the Shatsky Rise have concluded that the rise originated from a mantle plume, whereas studies of magnetic lineations and plate tectonic reconstructions have shown that it must have originated near a triple junction and drifted up to {{Convert|2000|km|abbr=on}} during the Early Cretaceous (140–100&amp;nbsp;Ma).  A 2016 study concluded that the Tamu Massif formed at a mid-ocean ridge that interacted with a plume head and that the Ori Massif formed off-axis probably from a plume tail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Li|Suo|Yu|Wu|2016|loc=Discussion and conclusions, pp. 575–576; Fig. 11, p. 577}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shatsky Rise formed at a triple junction, but the thickness of the plateau coupled with the depth and intensity of melting is different from those of [[MORB]] (mid-ocean ridge basalt), making a recycled mantle slab a more likely source.  A decrease in magma volume with time is more consistent with the involvement of a mantle plume.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Heydolph|Murphy|Geldmacher|Romanova|2014|loc=Conclusions, pp. 58–59}}; {{Harvnb|Geldmacher|van den Bogaard|Heydolph|Hoernle|2014|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tectonic history==
It formed during the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous at the [[Pacific Plate|Pacific]]–[[Farallon Plate|Farallon]]–[[Izanagi Plate|Izanagi]] [[triple junction]], probably making it the oldest unaltered ocean plateau.  Because this occurred before the so-called Cretaceous silent period, a long period without [[magnetic reversal]]s, its formation can be precisely dated.&lt;ref name="Sager-2005-Intro" /&gt;
Magnetic lineations on and surrounding Shatsky Rise range from M21 (147&amp;nbsp;Ma) at the south-western edge to M1 (124&amp;nbsp;Ma) at the northern tip.&lt;ref name="Sager-2005-TecHist" /&gt;

The Shatsky Rise LIP erupted at the location of the Pacific–Farallon–Izanagi triple junction {{Circa}} 147–143&amp;nbsp;Ma either because a mantle plume reached the surface or because of decompression melting at a [[mid-ocean ridge]].  The eruption coincided with a {{Convert|800|km|abbr=on}}, nine-stage jump in the location of the triple junction and a configuration change from ridge-ridge-ridge to ridge-ridge-transform.&lt;ref name="Seton-p228"&gt;{{Harvnb|Seton|Müller|Zahirovic|Gaina|2012|loc=p. 228; Fig. 6, p. 227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A set of magnetic lineations, called the Hawaiian lineations, between Shatsky Rise, Hess Rise, and the [[Mid-Pacific Mountains]], formed during the spreading between the Pacific and Farallon plates 156–120&amp;nbsp;Ma.  North of Shatsky Rise the so-called Japanese lineations are oriented in another direction and the differences in orientations trace the path of the Pacific–Farallon–Izanagi triple junction.&lt;ref name="Seton-p228" /&gt;

The triple junction moved north-west before M22 (150&amp;nbsp;Ma) after-which it started to reorganise, a microplate formed and the triple junction made an {{Convert|800|km|abbr=on}} eastward jump to the oldest part of the rise, the TAMU Massif.  The remainder of Shatsky Rise formed before M3 (126&amp;nbsp;Ma) along the trace of the triple junction.  Shaktsky volcanism was episodic and tied to at least nine ridge jumps from this episode.&lt;ref name="Sager-2005-TecHist" /&gt;

The volume of the rise decreases along the trace of the triple junction.  The TAMU Massif at the southern end has an estimated volume of {{Convert|2500000|km3|abbr=on}} whereas both ORI and Shirshov (136&amp;nbsp;Ma) attained {{Convert|700000|km3|abbr=on}}.  Papanin Ridge, the north end of the rise, has a volume of {{Convert|400000|km3|abbr=on}} but was probably emplaced over a longer period (131–124&amp;nbsp;Ma).&lt;ref name="Sager-2005-TecHist" /&gt;

The conjugates of the Shatsky and Hess rises on the [[Farallon Plate]] were most likely involved in the [[Laramide orogeny]]; the former subducted beneath North America and the latter below northern Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Liu|Gurnis|Seton|Saleeby|2010|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Siva Power, Inc.''' is an American [[solar power]] company that develops [[thin film solar cell|thin-film]] technology. The company designs and manufactures [[Copper indium gallium selenide solar cells|copper indium gallium deselenide]] (CIGS) [[photovoltaics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cleantechnica.com/2014/07/07/worlds-cheapest-solar-panels-coming-several-years/ |title=World’s Cheapest Solar Panels Coming In Several Years? |accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Siva Power is based in [[San Jose, California]]. Bruce Sohn is CEO and [[Brad Mattson]] is Chairman.

==History==
The company was founded in 2006 as Solexant (one of the founders was [[Paul Alivisatos]]) and was developing [[Cadmium telluride photovoltaics|cadmium telluride]] (CdTe) technology to create solar panels.&lt;ref name="Wang Bid"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Solar Startup's Bid To Reinvent Itself When Others Have Failed|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/uciliawang/2013/11/21/a-solar-startups-bid-to-reinvent-itself-when-others-have-failed/|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Chinese began dumping silicon solar panels and the American thin-film market worsened,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Solar Panel Makers Say China Violated Trade Rules|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/20/business/global/us-solar-manufacturers-to-ask-for-duties-on-imports.html|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the company decided to pivot and in 2011 hired Brad Mattson to take Solexant in a new direction, which he restarted in 2012.&lt;ref name="Wang Bid"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gigaom"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gigaom.com/2014/07/02/this-startup-says-it-can-make-the-worlds-cheapest-solar-panels/|title=This startup says it can make the world’s cheapest solar panels|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mattson put the company into [[stealth mode]] and ramped up the R&amp;D budget to find a different technology and process for manufacturing solar modules. In 2013 the company reemerged as Siva Power, developing CIGS photovoltaic technology.

==Technology==
Siva Power's deposition technique is [[Evaporation (deposition)|co-evaporation]], which deposits the CIGS compound alloy film by direct reactive condensation of vapors of its constituent elements (copper, indium, gallium, and selenium) onto the [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrate]], for which Siva Power uses glass.&lt;ref name="Wang Bid"/&gt; Siva Power has said its initial production capacity of a single line would be 300 megawatts of modules per annum, whereas typical pilot production lines tend to be 5 to 30 megawatts.&lt;ref name="Wang Bid"/&gt;

==Department of Energy SunShot Initiative Award==
In 2014, Siva Power won the [[Solar power in the United States#SunShot Initiative|US Department of Energy SunShot Initiative]] award under the SunShot SolarMat2 category for driving down the cost of manufacturing and implementing efficiency-increasing technology in manufacturing processes for solar modules.&lt;ref name="Semi"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.compoundsemiconductor.net/article/96214-siva-power%E2%80%99s-cigs-technology-recognised-by-us-sunshot-initiative.html |title=Siva Power’s CIGS Technology Recognised By US Sunshot Initiative |accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source|date=November 2017}} The manufacturing component Siva Power plans to build through the SunShot award are designed to have a 12x higher areal (e.g.: m2/min) manufacturing throughput than other CIGS deposition tools, enabling a fully automated CIGS deposition system at a 3x reduction in capex, labor, and overhead cost.&lt;ref name="SolarMat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energy.gov/eere/sunshot/solar-manufacturing-technology-2 |title=Solar Manufacturing Technology 2 |accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Team==
While in stealth mode, Robert Wendt, former CTO of XsunX&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poandpo.com/who-is-promoted/xsunx-promoted-grimes-to-president-and-robert-wendt-to-cto/ |title=XsunX promoted Grimes to President and Robert Wendt to CTO |accessdate= 21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the early pioneers of coevaporated CIGS technology, joined as Vice President of Process and Equipment Development. He began Siva’s CIGS program establishing the company's initial CIGS process capability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_24052388/despite-wave-sales-and-bankruptcies-thin-film-solar |title=Despite wave of sales and bankruptcies, 'thin-film' solar dream still alive |accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Siva Power came out of stealth, it also announced that energy-security expert and former [[Director of the CIA]] [[R. James Woolsey|James Woolsey]] had joined its board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Solexant-a-Thin-Film-Solar-Startup-Re-emerges-From-Stealth |title=Energy Jobs: Recurrent Energy, SunEdison, Vivint Solar, Enphase, Tenaska, Plug Power |accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, Siva Power hired Dr. Markus Beck, former Chief Scientist of [[First Solar]] and [[Solyndra]], to be Siva Power’s [[Chief technology officer|CTO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Green-Jobs-KPs-Ray-Lane-Now-Emeritus-Solexant-Nabs-Markus-Beck-for-CIGS |title=Green Jobs: KP’s Ray Lane Now Emeritus; Solexant Nabs Markus Beck for CIGS |accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Billy J.

===Technical Advisory Board===
Siva Power has also assembled a technical advisory board composed of Dr. Rommel Noufi, Dr. Charlie Gay, Dr. Markus Beck, John Benner, Dr. Bulent Basol, Scott Thomsen, Dr. BJ Stanbery and Dr. Vivek Lall, all photovoltaic and materials experts. Noufi was the Principal Scientist of the CIGS technology group at the [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory|US National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] (NREL) and is a consulting professor at [[Stanford University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eds.ieee.org/publications/239-rommel-noufi |title=IEEE Electron Devices Society - Rommel Noufi |accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gay was the former director of NREL and served as President of Applied Materials Solar Division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sivapower.com/#!technical-advisory-board/c1ij8 |title=Siva Power Technical Advisory Board |accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appliebdmaterials.com/profiles/charlie-gay-phd |title=Applied Materials Profiles: Charlie Gay, Ph.D. |accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Gay left Siva's advisory board in 2016 when he joined the DOE as Director of the SunShot Program, so as to avoid conflict of interest &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Energy-Jobs-Charlie-Gay-To-Head-DOE-SunShot-Plus-REC-Solar-Stem-JLM-Ene |title=Energy Jobs: Charlie Gay to Head DOE SunShot, Plus REC Solar, Stem, JLM Energy, Tigo, Faraday Future |accessdate=24 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benner is the Executive Director of the Bay Area Photovoltaic Consortium, an industry-led consortium managed by Stanford and [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] charged with funding next-generation PV research at US universities and national laboratories with funds from both the US DoE and its industry members, and Basol has more than 30 years of experience in photovoltaics, beginning with Monosolar, one of the first solar companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bapvc.stanford.edu/bapvc-management |title=BAPVC Management |accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encore-solar.com/team.html |title=Encore Solar: Team |accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott Thomsen is a glass materials expert who ran [[Guardian Industries]] global glass group as the company President, having previously served as the company's Head of North American glass operations and CTO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usgnn.com/newsThomsen20110418.htm |title=Scott Thomsen to Lead Guardian Glass |accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding and Acquisitions==
When the company was Solexant and developing CdTe technology, it had raised $60M over 3 rounds of venture funding from X Seed Capital, Acero Capital (formerly Olympus Capital), Medley Partners, Birchmere Ventures, Trident Capital, Firelake Capital, and DBL Investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/portland/blog/sbo/2010/06/solexant_lands_415_million_series_c_round.html?page=all |title=Solexant lands $41.5 million Series C round |accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Solexant acquired Wakonda, a solar startup based in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Solexant-Rebrands-as-Siva-and-Looks-to-Scale-CIGS-Thin-Film-Solar |title=Solexant Rebrands as Siva and Looks to Scale CIGS Thin-Film Solar |accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was recapitalized with $7M in 2015 in series D preferred equity investments from DBL, Medley, Acero and the city of [[Wuxi]], China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2015/02/02/the-daily-startup-siva-powers-funding-a-bright-spot-for-solar/ |title=The Daily Startup: Siva Power’s Funding a Bright Spot for Solar |accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Siva-Power-Lands-10M-to-Chase-Giga-Scale-Domestic-Thin-Film-Solar-Producti |title=Siva Power Lands $10M to Chase Giga-Scale Domestic Thin-Film Solar Production |accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the company added $5M more to the series D investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cleantechnica.com/2016/05/04/siva-says-scale-low-cost-solar-usa/|title=Siva Says "Scale Up!"

A '''ski season''' is a period when [[skiing]], [[snowboarding]] and other alpine sports are viable in an [[alpine resort]]. The season corresponds to when [[ski lift]]s are running and lift passes are available. Depending on the [[latitude]] and [[altitude]] of the resort, the season will typically run from early to mid-winter until mid- to late spring. Ideally the season will be over before the [[thaw (weather)|thaw]] begins.

A typical ski season has three stages, and therefore three levels of lift ticket pricing:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.travelchannel.com/interests/budget/articles/shoulder-season-savings-in-5-ski-resort-towns|title=Shoulder-Season Savings in 5 Ski Resort Towns|work=Travel Channel|access-date=2018-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Off-peak, at the very beginning and ending of the season, when the number of lifts open is limited and the snow cover in the lower sections of the mountain is typically patchy.
* Shoulder, during which the mountain is entirely snow-covered but lift pass sales are not sufficiently lucrative to justify opening all lifts or areas of the mountain.
* Peak, during which all lifts and most if not all [[Ski run|runs]] are open. These periods are usually at the height of the season or during school or public holidays.

Typically in the [[United States]], a ski season lasts from late November to early April, however larger resorts in [[Colorado]] and [[California]] are known to spin the lifts as late as the 4th of July.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-summer-skiing-20170519-story.html|title=Endless winter?

The '''South American Energy Summit''' is the name for one of a sequence of summits bringing together delegations from the countries of the [[Union of South American Nations]] to discuss [[energy]] related issues.

==First South American Energy Summit==
The first South American Energy Summit took place on April 16&amp;ndash;17 2007, on [[Isla Margarita]], in the  [[Venezuela]]n state of [[Nueva Esparta]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plenglish.com/article.asp?ID=%7BF3C665C4-7236-4F30-B7B6-AD733E6D9C2F%7D)&amp;language=EN Delegations Confirm Presence at SA Energy Summit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927190654/http://www.plenglish.com/article.asp?ID=%7BF3C665C4-7236-4F30-B7B6-AD733E6D9C2F%7D)&amp;language=EN |date=2007-09-27 }}, ''Prensa Latina'', published 2007-04-08, accessed 2007-04-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Ten of the 12 South American presidents attend in person, the exceptions being [[Tabaré Vázquez]] of [[Uruguay]] and [[Alan García]] of [[Peru]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.venezuelanalysis.com/news.php?newsno=2274 Leaders Meet in Venezuela for First South American Energy Summit], ''venezuelanalysis.com'', published 2007-04-18, accessed 2007-04-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the issues discussed was the production of [[ethanol fuel]] in the region, over which the countries have differing views. It was agreed that a new [[South American Energy Council]], headed by the energy ministers of the 12 countries, would be created to co-ordinate [[energy policy]], while the prospect of a future [[South American Energy Treaty]] was also raised.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=37380 Leaders Overcome Impasse on Ethanol] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070508232415/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=37380 |date=2007-05-08 }}, ''Inter Press Service News Agency'', published 2007-04-17, accessed 2007-04-19.&lt;/ref&gt; 

On non-energy topics, the presidents also agreed that the South American Community of Nations should be renamed the [[Union of South American Nations]].

[[File:Atmospheric circulation.svg|right|thumb|A diagram showing the relative positions of the subtropical ridge.  Where it normally lies winds are nearly calm, and locations under its normal location are known as lying in the horse latitudes.]]
The '''subtropical ridge''', also known as the '''subtropical high''' or '''horse latitudes''', is a significant belt of atmospheric [[High-pressure area|high pressure]] situated around the latitudes of [[30th parallel north|30°N]] in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and [[30th parallel south|30°S]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. It is the product of the [[atmospheric circulation|global air circulation]] cell known as the [[Hadley Cell]]. The subtropical ridge is characterized by mostly calm winds, which act to reduce [[air quality]] under its axis by causing [[fog]] overnight, and [[haze]] during daylight hours as a result of the stable atmosphere found near its location. The air descending from the upper troposphere flows out from its center at surface level toward the upper and lower [[latitude]]s of each hemisphere, creating both the [[trade wind]]s and the [[westerlies]]. The subtropical ridge moves poleward during the summer, reaching its most northern latitude in early fall, before moving equatorward during the cold season. The El Niño southern [[climate]] oscillation ([[ENSO]]) can displace the northern hemisphere subtropical ridge, with La Niñas allowing for a more northerly axis for the ridge, while El Niños show flatter, more southerly ridges.  The change of the ridge position during ENSO cycles changes the tracks of [[tropical cyclone]]s that form around their equatorward and western peripheries. As the subtropical ridge varies in position and strength, it can enhance or depress [[monsoon]] regimes around their low-latitude periphery.

==Formation==
Heating of the earth near the equator leads to large amounts of convection along the [[monsoon trough]] or [[Intertropical convergence zone]].  This air mass rises to the lower stratosphere where it diverges, moving away from the equator in the upper troposphere in both northerly and southerly directions. As it moves towards the mid-latitudes on both sides of the equator, the air cools and sinks. The resulting air mass subsidence creates a subtropical ridge of high pressure near the 30th parallel in both hemispheres. At the surface level, the sinking air diverges again with some returning to the equator, completing the Hadley circulation.  This circulation on each side of the equator is known as the [[Hadley cell]] and leads to the formation of the subtropical ridge.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Owen E. Thompson (1996). [http://www.atmos.umd.edu/~owen/CHPI/IMAGES/circs02.html Hadley Circulation Cell.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305122318/http://www.atmos.umd.edu/~owen/CHPI/IMAGES/circs02.html |date=2009-03-05 }} Channel Video Productions. Retrieved on 2007-02-11.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the world's deserts are caused by these climatological [[high-pressure area]]s.

==Migration==
[[File:Subtropicalridge2000091412.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The subtropical ridge shows up as a large area of black (dryness) on this water vapor satellite image from September 2000.]]

The subtropical ridge starts migrating poleward in late spring reaching its zenith in early autumn before retreating equatorward during the late [[fall]], winter, and early spring.  The equatorward migration of the subtropical ridge during the cold season is due to increasing north-south temperature differences between the poles and tropics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bIw9AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Atmosphere,+weather,+and+climate&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;q=|title=Atmosphere, weather, and climate|author=Roger Graham Barry, Richard J. Chorley|page=117|isbn=978-0-415-07760-6|year=1992|publisher=Routledge|accessdate=2009-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The latitudinal movement of the subtropical ridge is strongly correlated with the progression of the [[monsoon trough]] or [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]].

Most [[tropical cyclone]]s form on the side of the subtropical ridge closer to the [[equator]], then move poleward past the ridge axis before recurving into the main belt of the Westerlies.&lt;ref&gt;Joint Typhoon Warning Center (2006).

Areas west of [[Japan]] and [[Korea]] tend to experience many fewer September–November tropical cyclone impacts during [[El Niño]] and neutral years, while mainland [[China]] experiences much greater landfall frequency during [[La Niña]] years.  During El Niño years, the break in the subtropical ridge tends to lie near [[130th meridian east|130°E]], which would favor the Japanese archipelago, while in La Niña years the formation of tropical cyclones, along with the subtropical ridge position, shift west, which increases the threat to China.&lt;ref&gt;M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9615">{{about|life cycles of fungi||Anamorph (disambiguation)}}
In [[mycology]], the terms '''teleomorph''', '''anamorph''', and '''holomorph''' apply to portions of the [[Biological life cycle|life cycles]] of [[fungi]] in the [[Phylum|phyla]] [[Ascomycota]] and [[Basidiomycota]]:

*'''Teleomorph''': the sexual reproductive stage (morph), typically a [[Ascocarp|fruiting body]]
*'''Anamorph''': an asexual reproductive stage (morph), often [[mold]]-like; When a single fungus produces multiple morphologically distinct anamorphs, these are called '''synanamorphs'''.
*'''Holomorph''': the whole fungus, including anamorphs and teleomorph.

==Dual naming of fungi==
[[Fungus|Fungi]] are classified primarily based on the structures associated with [[sexual reproduction]], which tend to be  conserved. However, many fungi reproduce only asexually, and cannot be easily placed in a classification based on sexual characters; some produce both asexual and sexual states. These problematic species are often members of the [[Ascomycota]], but a few of them belong to the [[Basidiomycota]]. Even among fungi that reproduce both sexually and asexually, often only one method of reproduction can be observed at a specific point in time or under specific conditions. Additionally, fungi typically grow in mixed colonies and sporulate amongst each other. These facts have made it very difficult to link the various states of the same fungus.

Fungi that are not known to produce a teleomorph were historically placed into an artificial [[phylum]], the "[[Deuteromycota]]", also known as "Fungi Imperfecti", simply for convenience. Some workers hold that this is an obsolete concept, and that [[molecular phylogeny]] allows accurate placement of species which are only known from part of their life cycle.  Others retain the term deuteromycetes, but give it a lowercase "d" and no taxonomic rank.&lt;ref name="guarro"&gt;{{citation | pmc = 100249 | pmid = 10398676 |date=Jul 1999 |author1=Guarro, J |author2=Genéj |author3=Stchigel, Am | title = Developments in fungal taxonomy | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 454–500 | issn = 0893-8512 | journal = Clinical Microbiology Reviews | url = http://cmr.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10398676 | format = Free full text }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, Article 59 of the [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]] permitted mycologists to give asexually reproducing fungi (anamorphs) separate names from their sexual states (teleomorphs)&lt;ref&gt;[http://ibot.sav.sk/icbn/frameset/0064Ch6NoFa59.htm Article 59] of the [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]]&lt;/ref&gt; but this practice was discontinued as of 1 January 2013.&lt;ref name="Hawksworth 2011"/&gt;

The dual naming system can be confusing for novices. It is essential for workers in plant pathology, mold identification, medical mycology, and food microbiology, fields in which asexually reproducing fungi are commonly encountered.

== From dual system to single nomenclature ==
The separate names for anamorphs of fungi with a pleomorphic life-cycle has been an issue of debate since the phenomenon was recognized in the mid-19th century.&lt;ref name="Hawksworth 2011"/&gt; This was even before the first international [[Nomenclature codes|rules for botanical nomenclature]] were issued in 1867.&lt;ref name="Hawksworth 2011"/&gt; Special provisions are to be found in the earliest ''Codes'', which were then modified several times, and often substantially.&lt;ref name="Hawksworth 2011"/&gt; The rules have been updated regularly and become increasingly complex, and by the mid-1970s they were being interpreted in different ways by different [[mycologist]]s – even ones working on the same genus.&lt;ref name="Hawksworth 2011"/&gt; Following intensive discussions under the auspices of the [[International Mycological Association]], drastic changes were made at the [[International Botanical Congress]] in 1981 to clarify and simplify the procedures – and the now terms anamorph, teleomorph, and holomorph entered general use.&lt;ref name="Hawksworth 2011"/&gt; An unfortunate effect of the simplification was that many name changes had to be made, including for some well-known and economically important species; at that date, the [[Conserved name|conservation of species names]].&lt;ref name="Hawksworth 2011"/&gt;

Unforeseen in the 1970s, when the 1981 provisions were crafted, was the impact of [[molecular systematics]].&lt;ref name="Hawksworth 2011"/&gt; A decade later, it was starting to become obvious that fungi with no known sexual stage could confidently be placed in genera which were typified by species in which the sexual stage was known.&lt;ref name="Hawksworth 2011"/&gt; This possibility of abandoning the dual nomenclatural system was debated at subsequent [[International Mycological Congress]]es and on other occasions, and the need for change was increasingly recognized.&lt;ref name="Hawksworth 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cannon | first1 = P. F. | last2 = Kirk | first2 = P. M. | year = 2000 | title = The philosophies and practicalities of amalgamating anamorph and teleomorph concepts | url = | journal = [[Studies in Mycology]] | volume = 45 | issue = | pages = 19–25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the International Botanical Congress in Vienna in 2005, some minor modifications were made which allowed anamorph-typified names to be [[epitype|epitypified]] by material showing the sexual stage when it was discovered, and for that anamorph name to continue to be used.&lt;ref name="Hawksworth 2011"/&gt;

The 1995 edition of the influential ''Ainsworth and Bisby’s Dictionary of the Fungi'' sought to replace the term anamorph with ''mitosporic fungus'' and teleomorph with ''meiosporic fungus'', based on the idea that the fundamental distinction is whether [[mitosis]] or [[meiosis]] preceded sporulation.  This is a controversial choice because it is not clear that the morphological differences which traditionally define anamorphs and teleomorphs line up completely with sexual practices, or whether those sexual practices are sufficiently well understood in some cases.&lt;ref name="guarro"/&gt;

The Vienna Congress (2005) established a Special Committee to investigate the issue further, but it was unable to reach a consensus.&lt;ref name="Hawksworth 2011"/&gt; Matters were becoming increasingly desperate as mycologists using [[molecular phylogenetic]] approaches started to ignore the provisions, or interpret them in different ways.&lt;ref name="Hawksworth 2011"/&gt;

==One fungus, one name==
The International Botanical Congress in Melbourne in July 2011 made a change in the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]'' and adopted the principle "one fungus, one name".&lt;ref name="Hawksworth 2011"/&gt; After 1 January 2013, one fungus can only have one name; the system of permitting separate names to be used for anamorphs then ended.&lt;ref name="Hawksworth 2011"/&gt;  This means that all [[Nomen illegitimum|legitimate names]] proposed for a species, regardless of what stage they are [[Type (biology)|typified]] by, can serve as the correct name for that species.&lt;ref name="Hawksworth 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author1=McNeill, J. |author2=Barrie, F.R. |author3=Buck, W.R. |author4=Demoulin, V. |author5=Greuter, W. |author6=Hawksworth, D.L. |author7=Herendeen, P.S. |author8=Knapp, S. |author9=Marhold, K. |author10=Prado, J. |author11=Prud'homme Van Reine, W.F. |author12=Smith, G.F. |author13=Wiersema, J.H. |author14=Turland, N.J. |year=2012 |volume=Regnum Vegetabile 154 |title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code) adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011 |publisher=A.R.G.

All names now compete on an equal footing for [[Principle of Priority|priority]],&lt;ref name="Hawksworth 2011"/&gt; but in order not to render names for separate morphs as illegitimate, it was agreed that these should not be treated as superfluous alternative names in the sense of the ''Code''.&lt;ref name="Hawksworth 2011"/&gt;  It was further decided that anamorph-typified names should not be taken up to displace widely used teleomorph-typified names until the case has been considered by the General Committee established by the Congress.&lt;ref name="Hawksworth 2011"/&gt; It was decided that lists of names can be submitted to the General Committee and, after due scrutiny, names accepted on those lists are to be treated as conserved over competing synonyms (and listed as appendices to the ''Code'').&lt;ref name="Hawksworth 2011"/&gt; [[Lichen]]-forming fungi (but not [[lichenicolous fungi]]) had always been excluded from the provisions permitting dual nomenclature.&lt;ref name="Hawksworth 2011"/&gt;

'''Topaz Slough Wildlife Management Area''' ('''Topaz Slough WMA''') or '''Topaz Marsh''' is a marsh system that is part of the old [[Sevier River]] bed.

The water source stems from springs and irrigation runoff.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wildlife.utah.gov/waterfowl/forecasts_2015/clear_lake.php Clear Lake, Topaz Slough, Redmond and Bicknell Bottoms Waterfowl Management Areas]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fauna ==
Topaz Slough WMA is a historical use area for waterfowl and marsh dwelling species. Many different species of birds such as [[duck]]s, [[coot]]s, [[geese]], [[kestrel]]s, [[great blue heron]]s, and various shoreline birds can be found during the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7xszAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA96&amp;lpg=PA96&amp;dq=%22topaz+marsh%22+utah&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=L8dKrLh6vG&amp;sig=leAMQu4hFDXnNEWBiEAMtTkQ4NI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjIxt_2_oXWAhUJUlAKHQ5HAQM4ChDoAQgsMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22topaz%20marsh%22%20utah&amp;f=false|title=Central Utah Project, Bonneville Unit: Environmental Impact Statement|date=1973|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally, big animals like [[antelope]] use water on the west side of the slough. Furbearers include coyote, badger, red fox, and muskrat. Small game species that inhabit the WMA include cottontail rabbits, ring-necked pheasants, and mourning doves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frankstehno.com/sagemesa/destinations/utah/north/topazwma/index.htm Topaz Slough Wildlife Management Area]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4151">The [[climate]] in [[urban area]]s differs from that in neighboring [[rural area]]s, as a result of [[urban development]]. [[Urbanization]] greatly changes the form of the landscape, and also produces changes in an area's air.

In 1950 [[Åke Sundborg]] published one of the first theories on the climate of cities.&lt;ref name=kvase&gt;{{cite magazine |last= |first= |date=2008 |title=Kungl. Vetenskapsakademiens årsberättelse 2007 |url=https://www.kva.se/globalassets/om_akademien/arsberattelser/07annualreport.pdf |magazine= |location=Stockholm |publisher= |issue=81 |access-date=|language=Swedish |pages=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hoppe1986&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hoppe |first=Gunnar |author-link=Gunnar Hoppe |date=1986 |title=Åke Sundborg |url= |journal=[[Geografiska Annaler]] |volume=69 |issue=1 |pages=1–3 |doi= 10.1080/04353676.1987.11880191|access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Temperatures ==
Temperatures are higher in cities than the surrounding rural areas—this area is called the [[urban heat island]]. With rapid growth of megacities in the world, more sensible heat fluxes go to the atmosphere and thus making higher air temperature around urban area and its surrounding rural area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hong|first=Je-Woo|last2=Hong|first2=Jinkyu|date=2016-02-24|title=Changes in the Seoul Metropolitan Area Urban Heat Environment with Residential Redevelopment|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JAMC-D-15-0321.1|journal=Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology|volume=55|issue=5|pages=1091–1106|doi=10.1175/JAMC-D-15-0321.1|issn=1558-8424}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of causes of the urban heat island:
* Building materials have a lower [[specific heat capacity]] (the amount of energy that will heat a kilogram of a material by 1&amp;nbsp;°C) than grass and trees—the specific heat capacity of concrete is 800 [[Joule]]s/kg whereas for soil it can be 2000 Joules/kg, so concrete heats up more quickly in the day, warming the air around it.
* Buildings are heated while the vehicles and air conditioning systems generate heat.
* Buildings act as a barrier to winds which would otherwise distribute heat and cool the city.
* Buildings and roads with dark surfaces have a lower [[albedo]] (reflectivity) and absorb more sunlight, becoming hotter. Sunlight not absorbed by buildings is mostly reflected into other buildings.
* Natural sources of water and humidity that can exert a positive cooling [[oasis effect]] are rare (subterranean, canalized [[urban stream]]s)

The urban heat island effect tends to be stronger in winter because the colder air above the city is less able to rise by [[convection]] to allow the hot air inside the city to escape into the atmosphere. The effect is greater at night for the same reason.

== Precipitation ==
Because cities are warmer, the hot air is more likely to rise and if it has a high humidity it will cause convectional [[rainfall]] – short intense bursts of rain and [[thunderstorm]]s.  
Urban areas produce particles of dust (notably [[soot]]) and these act as [[hygroscopic]] nuclei which encourages rain production.
Because of the warmer temperatures there is less [[snow]] in the city than surrounding areas.

== Winds ==
[[Wind speed]]s are often lower in cities than the countryside because the buildings act as barriers ([[wind break]]s).  On the other hand, long streets with tall buildings can act as [[wind tunnel]]s – winds funnelled down the street – and can be gusty as winds are channelled round buildings ([[eddying]]).

== Humidity ==
Cities usually have a lower [[relative humidity]] than the surrounding air because cities are hotter, and rainwater in cities is unable to be absorbed into the ground to be released into the air by evaporation, and [[transpiration]] does not occur because cities have little [[vegetation]]. [[Surface runoff]] is usually taken up directly into the subterranean [[sewage water system]] and thus vanishes from the surface immediately.
