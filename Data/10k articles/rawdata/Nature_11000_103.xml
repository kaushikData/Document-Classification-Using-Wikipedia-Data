'''{{mp|(511002) 2013 MZ|5}} ''', provisional designation {{mp|2013 MZ|5}}, is a sub-kilometer [[asteroid]], classified as a [[near-Earth object]] of the [[Amor asteroid|Amor group]], approximately 300 meters in diameter. It was discovered on 18 June 2013, by [[Pan-STARRS]] at [[Haleakala Observatory]] on the island of Maui, Hawaii, in the United States.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt; It was the 10,000th near-Earth object ever discovered.&lt;ref name="NASA-news" /&gt;

== Orbit and classification ==

{{mp|2013 MZ|5}} is an [[Amor asteroid]] – a subgroup of near-Earth asteroids that approach the orbit of Earth from beyond, but do not cross it. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.3–1.8&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] once every 23 months (707 days; [[semi-major axis]] of 1.55&amp;nbsp;AU). Its orbit has an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.18 and an [[orbital inclination|inclination]] of 29[[Degree (angle)|°]] with respect to the [[ecliptic]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; The body's [[observation arc]] begins with its official discovery observation at Haleakala in June 2013.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;

=== Close approaches ===

The asteroid has an Earth [[minimum orbital intersection distance]] of {{convert |0.4601 |AU |km |abbr=on |lk=off |sigfig=3 |order=flip}}, which translates into 179 [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|lunar distances]]. It also makes close approaches to Mars. On 28 August 2125, it is projected to pass the Red Planet at a nominal distance of {{convert |0.0910 |AU |km |abbr=on |lk=off |sigfig=3 |order=flip}}. With an [[aphelion]] of 1.83&amp;nbsp;AU, it is also a [[Mars-crossing asteroid]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; 

=== 10,000th discovered NEO ===

{{mp|2013 MZ|5}} was the 10,000th near-Earth object (NEO) ever discovered and considered a significant milestone in exploring the NEO population.&lt;ref name="NASA-news" /&gt;

== Physical characteristics ==

=== Diameter and albedo ===

Based on a generic magnitude-to-diameter conversion, {{mp|2013 MZ|5}} measures approximately 290 meters in diameter for a measures [[absolute magnitude]] of 20.1 and an assumed [[Astronomical albedo|albedo]] 0.20, typical for [[S-type asteroid|stony asteroids]].&lt;ref name="h" /&gt;

As of 2018, no rotational [[lightcurve]] of {{mp|2013 MZ|5}} has been obtained from photometric observations. The object's [[rotation period]], [[Poles of astronomical bodies|pole]] and shape remain unknown.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt;

== Numbering and naming ==

This [[minor planet]] was numbered by the [[Minor Planet Center]] on 31 January 2018.&lt;ref name="MPC-Circulars-Archive" /&gt; It has [[List of named minor planets (numerical)|not been named]] yet.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;

'''{{mp|2012 KT|42}}''' is an [[Apollo asteroid|Apollo]] [[near-Earth asteroid]] first observed by astronomer [[Alex R. Gibbs]] of the [[Mount Lemmon Survey]] with a 1.5-meter reflecting telescope on 28 May 2012.

==Overview==

The asteroid had a close approach to the Earth on 29 May 2012, approaching to only ~8950 miles / ~14,440&amp;nbsp;km above the planet's surface. This means {{mp|2012 KT|42}} came inside the [[Clarke Belt]] of geosynchronous satellites. In May 2012, the estimated 5 to 10 meter wide asteroid ranked #6 on the top 20 list of closest-approaches to Earth. There was no danger of a collision during the close approach. {{mp|2012 KT|42}} passed roughly {{convert|0.01|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=on}} from Venus on 8 July 2012.&lt;ref name=jpl-close/&gt;

It is estimated that an [[Impact event|impact]] would produce an [[upper atmosphere]] [[air burst]] equivalent to 11 [[Nuclear weapon yield|kt TNT]],&lt;ref name=summary/&gt; roughly equal to Hiroshima's [[Little Boy]]. The asteroid would be [[Evaporation|vaporized]] as these small impacts occur approximately once per year. A comparable-sized object caused the [[Sutter's Mill meteorite]] in California on 2 April 2012. It was removed from the [[Sentry (monitoring system)|Sentry Risk Table]] on 30 May 2012.&lt;ref name="removed"/&gt;

[[File:Spectroscopy overview.svg|thumb|upright=2|right|'''An overview of [[electromagnetic radiation]] absorption'''. This example discusses the general principle using [[visible spectrum|visible light]] as specific example. A white [[light source]] — emitting light of multiple [[wavelength]]s — is focused on a sample (the pairs of [[complementary color]]s are indicated by the yellow dotted lines). Upon striking the sample, [[photon]]s that match the energy gap of the [[molecule]]s present (green light in this example) are ''absorbed'', exciting the molecules. Other photons are transmitted unaffected and, if the radiation is in the visible region (400–700&amp;nbsp;nm), the transmitted light appears as the complementary color (here red). By recording the [[attenuation]] of light for various wavelengths, an [[absorption spectroscopy|absorption spectrum]] can be obtained.]]

In [[physics]], '''absorption''' of [[electromagnetic radiation]] is the way in which the [[energy]] of a [[photon]] is taken up by matter, typically the [[electrons]] of an [[atom]]. Thus, the [[radiant energy|electromagnetic energy]] is transformed into [[internal energy]] of the absorber, for example [[thermal energy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Absorption of electromagnetic radiation|url=http://accessscience.com/content/Absorption-of-electromagnetic-radiation/001600|first=William|last=West|work=AccessScience|publisher=McGraw-Hill|accessdate=8 April 2013|doi=10.1036/1097-8542.001600}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reduction in intensity of a light wave [[wave propagation|propagating]] through a medium by absorption of a part of its photons is often called [[attenuation]]. Usually, the absorption of waves does not depend on their intensity (linear absorption), although in certain conditions (usually, in [[optics]]), the medium changes its transparency dependently on the intensity of waves going through, and [[saturable absorption]] (or nonlinear absorption) occurs.

==Quantifying absorption==
{{Main|Mathematical descriptions of opacity}}

There are a number of ways to quantify how quickly and effectively radiation is absorbed in a certain medium, for example the absorption coefficient, and some closely related derived quantities.

The [[attenuation coefficient]], which is sometimes but not always synonymous with the absorption coefficient.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

[[Molar absorptivity]] is called "molar extinction coefficient", which is the absorption coefficient divided by molarity (see also [[Beer–Lambert law]]).

The [[mass attenuation coefficient]] is also called "mass extinction coefficient", which is the absorption coefficient divided by density.

The [[absorption cross section]] and [[scattering cross-section]] are closely related to the absorption and attenuation coefficients, respectively.

[[Extinction (astronomy)|"Extinction" in astronomy]] is equivalent to the attenuation coefficient.

Other measures of radiation absorption are [[penetration depth]] and [[skin effect]], [[propagation constant]], [[propagation constant#Attenuation constant|attenuation constant]], [[propagation constant#Phase constant|phase constant]], and complex [[wavenumber]],
[[Refractive index|complex refractive index]] and [[refractive index#Dispersion and absorption|extinction coefficient]], [[Relative permittivity|complex dielectric constant]], [[electrical resistivity and conductivity]].

[[Absorbance]] (also called "optical density") and [[optical depth]] (also called "optical thickness") are two related measures.

All these quantities measure, at least to some extent, how well a medium absorbs radiation. However, practitioners of different fields and techniques tend to conventionally use different quantities drawn from the list above.

==Measuring absorption==
The [[absorbance]] of an object quantifies how much of the incident light is absorbed by it (instead of being [[reflection (physics)|reflected]] or [[refraction|refracted]]). This may be related to other properties of the object through the [[Beer–Lambert law]].

Precise measurements of the absorbance at many wavelengths allow the identification of a substance via [[absorption spectroscopy]], where a sample is illuminated from one side, and the intensity of the light that exits from the sample in every direction is measured. A few examples of absorption are [[ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy]], [[infrared spectroscopy]], and [[X-ray absorption spectroscopy]].

==Applications==
[[File:Atmospheric electromagnetic opacity.svg|thumb|right|Rough plot of Earth's atmospheric [[transmittance]] (or opacity) to various wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation, including [[visible light]]]]

Understanding and measuring the absorption of electromagnetic radiation has a variety of applications.

In [[Radio propagation]] it is represented in [[Non-line-of-sight propagation]]. 

In [[meteorology]] and [[climatology]], global and local temperatures depend in part on the absorption of radiation by [[atmospheric gases]] (such as in the [[greenhouse effect]]) and land and ocean surfaces (see [[albedo]]).

In [[medicine]], [[X-ray]]s are absorbed to different extents by different tissues ([[bone]] in particular), which is the basis for [[Projectional radiography|X-ray imaging]]. For example, see [[computation of radiowave attenuation in the atmosphere]] used in satellite link design.

In [[chemistry]] and [[materials science]], because different materials and molecules will absorb radiation to different extents at different frequencies, which allows for material identification.

In [[optics]], sunglasses, colored filters, dyes, and other such materials are designed specifically with respect to which visible wavelengths they absorb, and in what proportions.

In [[biology]], photosynthetic organisms require that light of the appropriate wavelengths be absorbed within the active area of [[chloroplast]]s, so that the [[light]] energy can be converted into [[chemical energy]] within sugars and other molecules.

In [[physics]], the D-region of Earth's [[ionosphere]] is known to significantly absorb radio signals that fall within the high-frequency electromagnetic spectrum.

In nuclear physics, absorption of nuclear radiations can be used for measuring the fluid levels, densitometry or thickness measurements &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=M. Falahati et al.|title=Design, modelling and construction of a continuous nuclear gauge for measuring the fluid levels|journal=Journal of Instrumentation|date=2018|volume=13|issue=2|page=P02028|doi=10.1088/1748-0221/13/02/P02028|bibcode=2018JInst..13P2028F}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2837">'''Alkaline Copper Quaternary''' (also known as ACQ) is a water based [[wood preservative]] method recently introduced in countries where there is a demand for alternatives to [[Chromated copper arsenate]] (CCA).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fs.fed.us/t-d/pubs/pdfpubs/pdf06772809/pdf06772809dpi72pt03.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The treatment is made up of copper, a [[bactericide]] and [[fungicide]] which makes the wood resistant to biological attack, and a [[quaternary ammonium]] compound (quat) which acts as biocide, increasing the tolerance of treated timber to copper-resistant bacteria and fungi, and also acting as an [[insecticide]].

ACQ has come into wide use in the USA, Canada, Europe, Japan and Australia following restrictions on [[Chromated copper arsenate|CCA]], as ACQ is seen as a “greener” preservative and a more sustainable option. Its use is governed by national and international standards which determine the volume of preservative uptake required for a specific timber end use. It is applied by industrial vacuum-pressure impregnation at a timber treatment plant.

As it is an alternative to CCA, ACQ can be used for wood with low to extremely high exposure to the elements and weathering. The concentrations used increase with the corresponding expected levels of exposure of the timber. The treatment lends a distinctive green tint to the timber, although pigment can be introduced during the treatment process to stain the wood in shades of brown and green. ACQ-treated timber can be painted, but this is not necessary.

In the US and other countries, ACQ is registered for use on: lumber, timbers, landscape ties, fence posts, building and utility poles, land, freshwater and [[Deep foundation#Timber|marine piling]]s, sea walls, decking, wood shingles, and other wood structures.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/oppad001/reregistration/cca/acq.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

All ACQ treatments accelerate corrosion of metal fasteners relative to untreated wood. Hot-dipped galvanized,
copper or stainless steel fasteners must be used.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fs.fed.us/t-d/pubs/pdfpubs/pdf06772809/pdf06772809dpi72pt03.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Chemical Specialties, Inc (CSI, now Viance) received [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]]’s [[Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award]] in 2002 for commercial introduction of ACQ. The widespread use of this wood preservative in some countries has eliminated the requirement for the arsenic and chromium contained in CCA.

[[Image:Twineball.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Twine ball in [[Darwin, Minnesota]] (2006)]]
[[Darwin, Minnesota]], is the home of a ball of [[baler twine]] rolled by Francis A. Johnson. It is {{convert|12|ft|m}} in diameter and weighs {{convert|17,400|lb|kg ST}}. Johnson began rolling the twine in March 1950, and wrapped four hours every day for 29 years. It is currently housed in an enclosed gazebo across from the town park on Main Street at ({{coord|45.096332|-94.410276|type:landmark_region:US-MN_scale:500}}) to prevent the public from touching it.  The town celebrates "Twine Ball Day" on the second Saturday in August every year. An adjacent volunteer-run, free to visit museum and gift shop has information on the history of the ball, as well as selling a variety of souvenirs.&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Balls of String|work=ABC Evening News|date=1993-12-28|author=Charles Murphy|publisher=Vanderbilt Television News Archive |url=http://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/program.pl?ID=145726}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WLTB-RSA"&gt;{{cite web|title=World's Largest Twine balls|publisher=RoadsideAmerica.com|date=|author1=Doug Kirby |author2=Ken Smith |author3=Mike Wilkins  |last-author-amp=yes |url=http://www.roadsideamerica.com/attract/MNDARtwine.html|accessdate=January 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Darwin's Twine Ball Museum |url=http://www.dasselenterprisedispatch.com/twine-ball-darwin.html |publisher=Dassel-Cotako Enterprise Dispatch |accessdate=January 27, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130107005243/http://www.dasselenterprisedispatch.com/twine-ball-darwin.html |archivedate=January 7, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CBS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Eye To Eye: On The Road Again|work=CBS|date=2008-11-12|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=4597446n}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was the long-standing holder of the "biggest ball of twine" title in the Guinness Book of World Records, holding the title from its completion in 1979 until 1994, and was referenced by [["Weird Al" Yankovic]] in his 1989 song "The Biggest Ball of Twine in Minnesota."&lt;ref name="atlantic2014"/&gt;

==Heaviest twine ball==
In [[Lake Nebagamon, Wisconsin]], James Frank Kotera claims to have made the heaviest ball of twine ever built. He started it in 1979 and is still working. Kotera estimates, by measuring the weight of each bag of twine that he winds on, that the ball weighs 8,770&amp;nbsp;kg (19,336 pounds), making it the heaviest ball of twine ever built. The ball is housed in an open-air enclosure in Kotera's lawn. The ball has a smaller companion, "Junior", that is made of string.&lt;ref name="CBS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/10970 |title=JFK's Twine Ball: World's Largest? |publisher=RoadsideAmerica.com |accessdate=January 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Largest nylon twine ball==
In [[Branson, Missouri]], a ball of [[nylon]] twine built by J. C. Payne of [[Valley View, Texas|Valley View]], Texas, is on display in [[Ripley's Believe It or Not]] museum. The ball, which measures 41.5 feet (12.6 m) in circumference, was certified as the world's largest ball of twine by the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] in 1993.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6309">'''Blondel's theorem,''' named after its discoverer, French electrical engineer [[André Blondel]], is the result of his attempt to simplify both the measurement of electrical energy and the validation of such measurements.  

The result is a simple rule that specifies the minimum number of [[watt-hour meter]]s required to measure the consumption of energy in any system of [[electrical conductor]]s.

'''''The theorem states that the power provided to a system of N conductors is equal to the algebraic sum of the power measured by N watt-meters.'''''  '''''The N watt-meters are separately connected such that each one measures the current level in one of the  N conductors and the potential level between that conductor and a common point.  In a further simplification, if that common point is located on one of the conductors, that conductor's meter can be removed and only N-1 meters are required.'''''  An electrical energy meter is a watt-meter whose measurements are integrated over time, thus the theorem applies to watt-hour meters as well.&lt;ref name="Knowlton"&gt;Archer E. Knowlton ''Electric Power Metering'', McGraw-Hill Book Company, Inc., 1934 page 77&lt;/ref&gt;  Blondel wrote a paper on his results that was delivered to the International Electric Congress held in Chicago in 1893.  Although he was not present at the Congress, his paper is included in the published Proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Proceedings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ORFLAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=proceedings+of+the+international+electrical+congress+chicago&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hCDqUIaRLsXI2wXqxoCgDQ&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA|accessdate=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of using N-1 separate meters, the meters are combined into a single housing for commercial purposes such as measuring energy delivered to homes and businesses.  Each pairing of a current measuring unit plus a potential measuring unit is then termed a stator or element.  Thus, for example, a meter for a four wire service will include three elements.  Blondel's Theorem simplifies the work of an electrical utility worker by specifying that an N wire service will be correctly measured by a N-1 element meter.  Unfortunately, confusion arises for such workers due to the existence of meters that don't contain tidy pairings of single potential measuring units with single current measuring units.  For example, a meter was previously used for four wire services containing two potential coils and three current coils and called a 2.5 element meter.

==Blondel Noncompliance==
Electric energy meters that meet the requirement of N-1 elements for an N wire service are often said to be ''Blondel Compliant''.  This label identifies the meter as one that will measure correctly under all conditions when correctly installed.  However, a meter doesn't have to be Blondel compliant in order to provide suitably accurate measurements and industry practice often includes the use of such non compliant meters.  The form 2S meter is extensively used in the metering of residential three wire services, despite being non compliant in such services.  This common residential service consists of two 120 volt wires and one neutral wire.  A Blondel compliant meter for such a service would need two elements (and a five jaw socket to accept such a meter), but the 2S meter is a single element meter. The 2S meter includes one potential measuring device (a coil or a voltmeter) and two current measuring devices.  The current measuring devices provide a measurement equal to one half of the actual current value.  The combination of a single potential coil and two so called half coils provides highly accurate metering under most conditions.  The meter has been used since the early days of the electrical industry.  The advantages were the lower cost of a single potential coil and the avoidance of interference between two elements driving a single disc in an induction meter.  For line to line loads, the meter is Blondel compliant.  Such loads are two wire loads and a single element meter suffices.  The non compliance of the meter occurs in measuring line to neutral loads.  The meter design approximates a two element measurement by combining a half current value with the potential value of the line to line connection.  The line to line potential is exactly twice the line to neutral connection if the two line to neutral connections are exactly balanced. Twice the potential times half the current then approximates the actual power value with equality under balanced potential. In the case of line to line loads, two times the half current value times the potential value equals the actual power.  Error is introduced if the two line to line potentials are not balanced and if the line to neutral loads are not equally distributed.  That error is given by 0.5(V1-V2)(I1-I2) where V1 and I1 are the potential and current connected between one line and neutral and V2 and I2 are those connected between the other line and neutral.&lt;ref name="Knowlton" /&gt;  Since the industry typically maintains five percent accuracy in potential, the error will be acceptably low if the loads aren't heavily unbalanced.

This same meter has been modified or installed in modified sockets and used for two wire, 120 volt services (relabeled as 2W on the meter face).  The modification places the two half coils in series such that a full coil is created. In such installations, the single element meter is Blondel compliant.  There is also a three wire 240/480 volt version that is not Blondel compliant.  Also in use are three phase meters that are not Blondel compliant, such as forms 14S and 15S, but they can be easily replaced by modern meters and can be considered obsolete.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6740">{{Globalize/US|article|date=July 2015}}
An '''electrical contractor''' is a [[business person]] or [[business entity|firm]] that performs specialized [[construction]] work related to the design, installation, and maintenance of [[electrical systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About NECA Voice of the Electrical Construction Industry National Electrical Contractors Association|url=http://www.necanet.org/about-us/overview|website=www.necanet.org|accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An electrical contractor is different from an [[electrician]]; an electrician is an individual [[tradesman]] and an electrical contractor is a business person or company that employs electricians. Both usually hold [[license]]s and [[insurance]]s to properly and safely operate a business, protecting the employees and home owners/business owners from insurance liabilities. These requirements vary from state to state. Electricians may work for an electrical contractor, or directly for individuals or companies.

== Industry classifications ==
Electrical contractors are generally classified by three major types of work performed.
* "Outside" or [[lineman (technician)|"line"]] contractors are responsible for [[high-voltage]] power transmission and distribution lines. Line contractors build and maintain the infrastructure required to transport electricity generated at a [[power plant]] through a series of high-voltage lines and substations before it is used to power facilities, buildings, and homes.
* "Inside" electrical contractors provide electricity to any structure within a property’s boundary lines, including outdoor lighting or substations. Under current construction specification guidelines, "inside" electrical contractors can serve as prime contractors for all electrical and cabling design, installation, and maintenance for commercial, institutional, and residential buildings. Projects also include Database Centers/Infrastructure and Pharmaceutical Work.
* "Integrated building systems" (IBS) or "Voice/Data/Video" (VDV) electrical contractors work primarily with low-voltage installations such as back-up power, climate controls, [[wireless networks]], energy-efficient lighting, [[telecommunications]], [[fiber optics]], and security systems. IBS contractors are particularly skilled at integrating these system controls to work together for maximum energy efficiency and building performance.

== Industry jobs ==
Electrical contractors employ workers in many capacities, determined by their level of training and experience. Some common jobs include:

* Apprentice Electrician — Receives on-the-job training and classroom instruction from licensed journeymen or master electricians about how to install, modify, repair, and maintain power and lighting systems. Most apprentice programs last 3 to 5 years and apprentices earn wages during this training period.&lt;ref name=bls&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos206.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091103103805/http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos206.htm |date=November 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Journeyman Electrician — Installs, modifies, repairs, and maintains power and lighting systems. Reads blueprints, terminates cable, and installs and troubleshoots control wiring from drawings. Has completed the apprentice program and holds a journeyman's license (according to state requirements) and supervises apprentices.
* Estimator — Calculates a project's duration and cost, including materials, overhead, and labor. This estimate is often submitted as a bid on a project and serves as a scheduling and budget guideline as the project proceeds.
* Project Supervisor — Oversees workforce to encourage safe and high-quality installations. Monitors progress to meet project deadlines. Submits required reports and forms.

== Trade associations ==

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom]], the three main [[trade association]]s are the [[National Inspection Council for Electrical Installation Contracting]] and [[Electrical Contractors' Association]], covering England, Northern Ireland and Wales, and [[SELECT - the Electrical Contractors' Association for Scotland]].

===United States===
The [[National Electrical Contractors Association]] (NECA) is the largest trade association in the electrical contracting industry, with about 4500 members. NECA publishes an industry magazine, and sponsors an annual convention and trade show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.necaconvention.org/?fa=exhibitor |title=NECA 2016 Boston &amp;#124; Revolutionary Power. Expert Solutions |publisher=Necaconvention.org |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Independent Electrical Contractors]] (IEC) is another trade association for electrical contractors with 70 chapters across the U.S. They provide education and training via a [[U.S. Department of Labor]] recognized apprenticeship program.

'''[[Morocco|Morocco's]] [[energy policy]]''' is set independently by two agencies the government, the Office of Hydrocarbons and Mining (ONHYM) which sets domestic oil policy and the Office National de l'Electricité (ONE) which sets policy with regard to electricity.  The two major weaknesses of the energy policy of Morocco are the lack of coordination between these two agencies and the lack of development of domestic energy sources. Oil exploration has been disappointing, although the country possesses some natural gas reserves that have been exploited. Its hydroelectric potential is considerable and now being tapped. Morocco covers the bulk of its growing energy needs through imports, principally of crude petroleum, which is then refined domestically. Thermal power plants produce much of the country's electricity.

==Oil and natural gas==
According to January 2006 estimates by the ''Oil and Gas Journal'', Morocco has proven oil reserves of {{convert|1070000|oilbbl|m3|order=flip}} and natural gas reserves of {{convert|60|Gcuft|m3|order=flip|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DpH6nCIQcbYC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA82#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Oil and Gas Journal Databook 2006"]&lt;/ref&gt; Morocco may have additional hydrocarbon reserves, as many of the country's sedimentary basins have not yet been fully explored.

The Moroccan Office of Hydrocarbons and Mining (ONHYM) has become optimistic about finding additional reserves – particularly offshore – following discoveries in neighboring Mauritania. At the end of 2005, 19 foreign companies were operating in Morocco, with an estimated total investment of $56 million per year. In May 2004, China Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) received a license to drill near Agadir. In April 2004, Norway's Norsk Hydro signed a 12-month exploration contract for the Safi Offshore Northwest zone, while Denmark's Maersk signed an eight-year agreement for eight blocks near Tarfaya. In March 2004, Calgary-based Stratic Energy committed to a three-year exploration program in two onshore blocks in northwest Morocco. The two concessions cover approximately {{convert|1544|sqmi|km2|order=flip|abbr=on}}. Other foreign firms engaged in exploration include Petronas, Cooper Energy NL, Shell, Total, and Tullow Oil.

Morocco produces small volumes of oil and natural gas from the Essaouira Basin and small amounts of natural gas from the [[Gharb Basin]]. Consequently, Morocco is the largest energy importer in northern Africa. Costs have been rising rapidly. High oil prices in 2005 increased import costs to approximately $2 billion for the year. In 2008, total costs related to energy imports reached $8 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://africaecon.org/index.php/africa_business_reports/read/51 Africa Economic Development Institute, "Morocco: $11 Billion to Energy Sector"]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the Moroccan government announced that foreign companies could import oil without paying import tariffs. This followed a 2000 decision, in which, Morocco modified its hydrocarbons law in order to offer a 10-year tax break to offshore oil production firms, and to reduce the government's stake in future oil concessions to a maximum of 25 percent. The entire energy sector was due to be liberalized by 2007.

Recent activity in Western Sahara, which is believed to contain viable hydrocarbon reserves, has been controversial. In 2001, Morocco granted exploration contracts to Total and Kerr-McGee, angering Premier Oil and Sterling Energy, which previously had obtained licenses from the Polisario government. In 2005, the government-in-exile of the Western Sahara invited foreign companies to bid on 12 contracts for offshore exploration, with hopes of awarding production sharing contracts by the end of 2005. Both Premier Oil and Sterling Energy received conditional exploration rights. Foreign companies operating under Moroccan concession in Western Sahara have become targets of international protest campaigns. These companies include Total, Wessex Exploration, Svitzer (the British subsidiary of the Dutch company Fugro), Wales' Robertson Research International and Norway's TGS Nopec. All have ended their operations in Western Sahara, with the exception of Kerr-McGee. As of November 2005, the company was the last to be drilling in Western Sahara, although the Polisario government has pressured it to pull out.

Morocco is a transit center for Algerian gas exports to Spain and Portugal. These are transported across the Strait of Gibraltar via the 300–350 Bcf/year Maghreb-Europe Gas (MEG) pipeline. Natural gas from the MEG pipeline will be used to power Morocco's power project in Al Wahda.

===Refining===
Morocco has two refineries that are owned by Saudi-company Corral Holdings Societe Marocaine d’Industrie de Raffinage (Samir). The refineries are located at Mohammedia and Sidi Kacem and have a combined capacity of {{convert|154901|oilbbl/d|abbr=on|order=flip}}. In 2004, the Mohammedia plant returned to near full-capacity output levels, following the completion of repairs needed after a severe flood and massive fire in November 2002. Because of the completed repairs, refinery output surged 49 percent in 2004. The Mohammedia plant currently produces 80 – 90 percent of the country's refined petroleum products. In June 2005, Samir awarded a $628 million contract to modernize the Mohammedia refinery to a consortium led by Italy's Snamprogetti SpA and Turkey's Tekefen Company. Morocco hopes the refinery upgrade will prepare the refinery for competing with foreign producers when the market is liberalized in 2009. The upgrade is expected to be complete in 2008.

==Oil shale==
{{main|Oil shale in Morocco}}
Ten known [[oil shale reserves|oil shale deposits]] in [[Morocco]] account more than {{convert|53.381|Goilbbl|order=flip|abbr=on}} of [[shale oil]]. Although Moroccan oil shale is studied since the 1930s, and there have been several pilot facilities for shale oil production, there is no commercial shale oil production yet.  The most important deposits are Timahdit (Middle Atlas Mountains) and Tarfaya (south-westernmost part of Morocco).&lt;ref name=aboulkas&gt;

==Electricity==
Morocco's electrical sector traditionally has been controlled by the state-owned Office National de l'Electricité (ONE), which the government reorganized in 1995 in order to regain profitability. Due to a growing population and economic development, Morocco's electricity demand is increasing rapidly. Power shortages and a desire to control public spending have led the Moroccan government to make more use of the private sector to meet the country's power needs. The state's share of electricity generation likely will decline to 40 percent by 2020. However, ONE will continue to be solely responsible for distribution and transmission of electricity in Morocco.

In 2003, Morocco had an installed generating capacity of 4.8 [[gigawatt|GW]]. The country's two largest electricity power stations at Mohammedia and Jorf Lasfar are both coal fired. Most of the coal is imported from South Africa, although Morocco purchased Polish coal for the Jorf Lasfar power plant in April 2005. Morocco stopped coal production in 2000, when Jerada coal mine was closed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/Morocco2014.pdf|title=Morocco 2014|last=|first=|publisher=International Energy Agency|year=2014|isbn=9789264211483|location=France|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Jorf Lasfar became Morocco's first privately operated power station in 1997, when it was taken over by a U.S.-Swiss consortium. The consortium expanded the plant’s capacity to 1,400 MW in 2001.

The expansion at Jorf Lasfar is consistent with a wider campaign to increase generating capacity in Morocco. In 2005, as part of the Moroccan government's plan, a $500 million, 350 – 400-MW combined-cycle power plant began operation in Tahaddart. The plant is owned by ONE (48%), [[Endesa (Spain)|Endesa]] (32%) and [[Siemens]] (20%). In addition to the Tahaddart plant, ONE awarded Endesa the development rights of a two-unit, 800-MW gas-fired power station in the Sidi Kacem Province, with a completion date set for 2008 [still not completed in 2010]. ONE is also considering another pumped storage plant in the Azilal region south of Rabat.

===Renewable energy===
{{Main|Renewable energy in Morocco}}
[[Renewable energy]] plays a key role in ONE's $3.4 billion energy development plan, announced in January 2004. The goal is to provide 80 percent of rural areas with electricity by 2008, while increasing the share of renewable energy from 0.24 percent in 2003 to 10 percent in 2011. The framework of regulation in Morocco generally supports the use of renewable energy in the electricity sector, as law 13-09 (“renewable energy law”) was announced in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schinke|first=Boris|last2=Klawitter|first2=Jens|date=25 April 2016|title=Background Paper: Country Fact Sheet Morocco Energy and Development at a glance 2016|url=https://germanwatch.org/en/download/15121.pdf|journal=Germanwatch Kaiserstr|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Morocco further elevated their renewable energy target by announcing that they will attain 52 percent renewable energy portion in electricity by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thenational.ae/business/morocco-sets-target-for-50-per-cent-renewable-energy-by-2030-1.102903|title=Morocco sets target for 50 per cent renewable energy by 2030|last=Graves|first=LeAnne|date=7 December 2015|website=The National|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.whitecase.com/publications/alert/moroccos-renewable-energy-ambitions|title=Morocco's renewable energy ambitions|last=Vaissier|first=François-Guilhem|date=28 November 2016|website=White &amp; Case|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to achieve the target, Morocco generates its electricity through renewable sources like wind and solar power.
[[File:Amogdoul Wind Farm Essaouira 2007.jpg|thumb|Amogdoul Wind Farm, Morocco]]

==== Wind power ====
As of 2016, Morocco has eight wind farms (Torres, Amogdoul, Lafarge, Akhfennir, Laayue, Tangier I, Cimar, and Haouma) with the total operational capacity of 487 MW, furthermore another six wind farms are anticipated to be installed by 2020 with total capacity of 1000 MW.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.export.gov/article?id=Morocco-Renewable-Energy#|title=Morocco - Renewable Energy|last=|first=|date=21 September 2016|website=export.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morocco has set a goal to have 2 GW production capacity from wind power; it is part of the Moroccan Integrated Wind Energy Project which began in 2010.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kousksou|first=T.|last2=Allouhi|first2=A.|last3=Belattar|first3=M.|last4=Jamil|first4=A.|last5=El Rhafiki|first5=T.|last6=Arid|first6=A.|last7=Zeraouli|first7=Y.|date=July 2015|title=Renewable energy potential and national policy directions for sustainable development in Morocco|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032115001458?via%3Dihub|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|volume=47|pages=46–57|via=|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2015.02.056}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Further|Wind power in Morocco}}

==== Solar power ====
{{main article|Solar power in Morocco}}

In November 2009 Morocco announced a [[solar energy]] project worth $9 billion which officials said will account for 38 percent of the North African country's installed power generation by 2020.&lt;ref name="reuters1"&gt;[https://af.reuters.com/article/investingNews/idAFJOE5A202D20091103 Morocco unveils $9 bln solar power scheme | Reuters]. Af.reuters.com (2009-11-03). Retrieved on 2010-11-21.&lt;/ref&gt; Funding would be from a mix of private and state capital. The ceremony was attended by U.S. Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] and the [[Mohammed VI|Moroccan king]].&lt;ref name="reuters1" /&gt; The project will involve five solar power generation sites across Morocco and will produce 2,000 [[megawatt|MW]] of electricity by 2020.&lt;ref name="reuters1" /&gt;
The project would add in terms of power generation the equivalent of the current electricity consumption of the country's commercial capital [[Casablanca]]. Germany has expressed its willingness to participate in the development of Morocco's solar energy project&lt;ref name="moroccobusinessnews1"&gt;[http://www.moroccobusinessnews.com/Content/Article.asp?idr=20&amp;id=1252 Germany to participate in Morocco's solar energy project]. Moroccobusinessnews.com. Retrieved on 2010-11-21.&lt;/ref&gt; which the country has decided to carry out. Germany will also take part in the development of a water-desalination plant.&lt;ref name="moroccobusinessnews1" /&gt;

The solar project focuses on developing [[Concentrated solar power|Concentrated Solar Power]] (CSP) and [[Photovoltaics|Photovoltaic]] (PV) facilities; both facilities are managed by Moroccan Agency for Solar Energy (MASEN).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=100% RENEWABLE ENERGY: BOOSTING DEVELOPMENT  IN MOROCCO|last=Leidreiter|first=Anna|last2=Schurig|first2=Stefan|publisher=World Future Council|year=2015|isbn=|location=Hamburg, Germany|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morocco pioneered solar energy technology by investing in Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) program in [[Middle East and North Africa]] (MENA) region. This project is one of the actions to reduce Morocco’s dependency on fossil fuels and to reach the goal of 52% power generation from renewables by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2016/11/08/learning-from-morocco-why-invest-in-concentrated-solar-power|title=Learning from Morocco: Why Invest in Concentrated Solar Power?|last=|first=|date=8 November 2016|website=The World Bank|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biggest CSP project in Morocco is Noor Solar, situated in city Ouarzazate, on the edge of Sahara desert. The project comprises 3 phases: [[Noor I]], Noor II and Noor III. This Noor project is supported by a [[BOOT]] (build, own, operate and transfer) basis of [[ACWA Power|ACWA Power Ouarzazate]], MASEN, Aries, and TSK. The first phase of the program - Noor I - was inaugurated in February 2016. Noor I employs 500,000 parabolic mirrors to eventually generate up to 160 MW electricity, which makes it one of the largest solar power plants in the world.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://helioscsp.com/moroccos-noor-concentrated-solar-power-plant/|title=Morocco’s Noor Concentrated Solar Power Plant|last=Narayan|first=Ranjana|date=17 April 2017|website=Helioscp|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program has two following phases - Noor II and Noor III - which are scheduled to operate by 2018. Beside CSP project, Morocco is also developing Noor PV 1 program and Noor Midelt phase 1, which essentially use photovoltaics to further increase the electricity generation from solar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://helioscsp.com/morocco-shortlists-five-international-bids-for-noor-midelt-pv-concentrated-solar-power-project/|title=Morocco shortlists five international bids for Noor Midelt PV-Concentrated Solar Power project|last=|first=|date=|website=Helioscp|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The whole complex of Noor Plant are scheduled to come online in 2018. The complex would have 582 MW of capacity, which could be utilized to provide electricity for 1.1 million houses. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; From 2010 until 2015, electricity generated by solar and wind has increased almost four times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/20524/Energy_profile_Morocco.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y|title=Morocco|last=|first=|date=24 September 2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hydro power ====
Morocco has additional renewable resources that could be developed, which the countries four perennial rivers and many dams with hydroelectric potential. In May 2005, ONE selected Temsol for a $27.6 million project to supply solar power to 37,000 rural homes by 2007. Similar contracts were awarded in May 2002 to a consortium led by Total Energie and in January 2004 to Apex-BP. Currently, only 55 percent of outlying villages have access to electricity.

==== Biomass energy ====
Biomass is also one of renewable sources that the country possesses in abundance with 12,568 GW h/year and 13,055 GWh/year potential in solid bioenergy and combination of biogas and biofuels.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; However, the country has only utilized less than 1% of the potentials due to high cost of investment and insufficient production process knowledge.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kousksou|first=T.|last2=Allouhi|first2=A.|last3=Belattar|first3=M.|last4=Jamil|first4=A.|last5=El Rhafiki|first5=T.|last6=Arid|first6=A.|last7=Zeraouli|first7=Y.|date=July 2015|title=Renewable energy potential and national policy directions for sustainable development in Morocco|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032115001458?via%3Dihub|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|volume=47|pages=46–57|via=|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2015.02.056}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nuclear energy ===
Morocco has expressed interest in nuclear power for desalination and other purposes. In September 2001, the government signed an agreement with the United States establishing the legal basis for constructing a 2-MW research reactor. Morocco signed an agreement with the U.S. company, General Atomics, to construct the research reactor east of Rabat.

==Regional integration==
Morocco is gradually integrating its electrical grid with those of its neighbours in Africa and Europe. Maghreb integration has been spearheaded by the Maghreb Electricity Committee, with physical integration initiatives that began in the 1990s. In May 2003, Moroccan representatives met with the Energy ministers from other European and Mediterranean countries to discuss the feasibility of electricity market integration. In December 2005, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and the European Union signed a funding agreement that will pay for costs related to studying the electricity market within the three countries and how they might integrate into the European electricity market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/Arab_Maghreb_Union/Morocco.html Google image map]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco networks are already connected to the European Network managed by the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity which allowed these three countries to link their electricity systems to the E.U.’s single energy market and be at the heart of the dialogue within the framework of the Euro-Mediterranean Energy Partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=uneca.org |date=December 2013 |title=Regional Cooperation Policy for the development of Renewable Energy in North Africa |url=http://www.uneca.org/sites/default/files/publications/regional_cooperation_policy_for_the_development_of_renewable_energy_in_north_africa.pdf |format=PDF }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Masaccio-TheExpulsionOfAdamAndEveFromEden-Restoration.jpg|thumb|330px|''The Expulsion from the Garden of Eden'', before and after restoration.]]
'''''The Expulsion from the Garden of Eden''''' ({{lang-it|'''Cacciata dei progenitori dall'Eden'''}}) is a [[fresco]] by the Italian Early Renaissance artist [[Masaccio]]. The fresco is a single scene from the cycle painted around 1425 by Masaccio, [[Masolino da Panicale|Masolino]] and others on the walls of the [[Brancacci Chapel]] in the church of [[Santa Maria del Carmine di Firenze|Santa Maria del Carmine]] in [[Florence]]. It depicts [[Fall of Man|the expulsion of Adam and Eve from the garden of Eden]], from the biblical [[Book of Genesis]] chapter 3, albeit with a few differences from the canonical account.&lt;ref name="smarth"/&gt;

==Possible sources of inspiration==
Many possible sources of inspiration have been pointed out that Masaccio may have drawn from. For Adam, possible references include numerous sculptures of [[Marsyas]] (from [[Greek Mythology]]) and certain [[crucifixes|crucifix]] done by [[Donatello]].

For Eve, art analysts usually point to different versions of [[Venus Pudica]], such as ''Prudence'' by [[Giovanni Pisano]].

Three centuries after the fresco was painted, [[Cosimo III de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo III de' Medici]], in line with contemporary ideas of [[decorum]], ordered that [[Fig leaf|fig leaves]] be added to conceal the [[genitals]] of the figures.  These were eventually removed in the 1980s when the painting was fully restored and cleaned.&lt;ref name="smarth"/&gt;
[[File:Cappella brancacci, cacciata.JPG|left|thumb|The scene in its context in the chapel.]]

==Influence on Michelangelo==
Masaccio provided a large inspiration to the more famous Renaissance painter [[Michelangelo]], due to the fact that [[Michelangelo]]'s teacher, [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]], looked almost exclusively to him for inspiration for his religious scenes. Ghirlandaio also imitated various designs done by Masaccio. This influence is most visible in Michelangelo's ''The Fall of Man and the Expulsion from the Garden of Eden'' on the ceiling of the [[Sistine Chapel]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Differences from Genesis==
The main points in this painting that deviate from the account as it appears in Genesis:

# Adam and Eve are shown in the nude. Although this increases the drama of the scene, it differs from Genesis 3:21 ([[KJV]]) which states, "Unto Adam also and to his wife did the {{LORD}} God make coats of skins, and clothed them."
# Only one [[Cherub]] angel is present. Genesis 3:24 states, "So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims&lt;!--SIC--&gt;, [...]" (''-im'' being the original Hebrew plural ending of Cherub, doubled with an English plural in this version).
# The arch depicted at the garden entrance does not appear in the Biblical account.

However, since artists often followed the studio tradition, painting from previous versions of a scene--and so learning from and absorbing other artists' expressive inventions into their own work--any responsible iconographic study would founder in the shallows of literal expectation if the painting were only judged by its adherence to these details and therefore seen to be successful only if it functioned as a simple illustration for the scene. 

Masaccio's evocation of Eve's howling, deeply felt pain in particular explores the meaning of the expulsion on a previously unexamined, more personal level.

In 2nd Temple Jewish texts, however, Adam is described as glorious (''Sirach'' 49, ''&amp;c.''), and in both some Rabbinic and Christian Patristic sources, there is a long tradition of reading the Hebrew word for "skin" as "light" (there is only one slight difference in the vowels between the two words), and taking the Genesis 3:21 words about God clothing the pair in the Pluperfect sense, such as Sebastian Brock has shown is done in the Syriac tradition. In Rabbinic sources there are several times when Adam is compared and contrasted with Moses, particularly in terms of Moses' luminosity after ascending the mountain, and at least one text where Moses claims that his glory is greater than Adam's, because he did not lose his glory (Deuteronomy Rabbah 11:3); Genesis Rabbah 20:12 notes that Rabbi Meir had a scroll that had "light" instead of skin. The same tradition is found in Ephrem the Syrian, who, in his ''Hymns on Paradise'' 6, talks about Christ clothing the faithful in the robe that Adam lost with the transgression. The Canon of St. Andrew of Crete has the cantor liken himself to Adam, and say "I have found myself stripped naked of God". The Venerable Bede, in his commentary ''On Genesis'', has similar comments: "having lost the glory of innocence by their transgression, they claimed for themselves the garment of an excuse". The "stripped of divinity/glory/innocence/honor motif is thus found in the Latin, Greek, and Syriac traditions of the Church. It seems quite possible that these artists were working within this very old tradition that stretches across traditions.

'''Flisom''' is a developer and manufacturer of [[photovoltaic]] (PV) [[thin film solar cell]]s, located near [[Zurich]], Switzerland. The company produces high-efficiency [[Copper indium gallium selenide solar cells|CIGS thin film solar modules]] on flexible [[Polyimide|plastic foil]] using proprietary roll-to-roll manufacturing techniques.

The innovative manufacturing technology enables price competition with established c-si PV manufacturing systems at a comparatively smaller production scale. Furthermore the lightweight, flexible, jet-black and thin solar panels potentially can bring down the overall costs for fully installed [[solar PV systems]]. This is about half the cost of conventional PV technology based on [[crystalline silicon]].&lt;ref name=IEA-roadmap-PV-2014&gt;

== History ==

Flisom AG was founded in 2005 as a spin-off company of [[Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich|ETH Zurich]], and has a long-standing research partnership with [[Empa]] – the ''Swiss Federal Laboratories for Material Science and Technology'', which has been developing this type of flexible solar cell to [[Solar cell efficiency#Comparison|world record efficiencies]] of 20.4%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empa.ch/plugin/template/empa/*/132690/---/l=1 |title=Empa signs collaboration agreement with start-up |accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.empa.ch/plugin/template/empa/1/131438/---/l=2 |title=

== Technology ==

The company's production technology is based on a [[Roll-to-roll processing|roll-to-roll manufacturing]] process of flexible solar modules, involving [[Evaporation (deposition)|deposition]] of [[thin film]]s of [[Copper indium gallium selenide|CIGS absorber material]] onto a [[polymer]] foil [[Coating|substrate]] made of [[polyimide]]. The key processes of depositing the absorber material in this manner has been proprietarily developed by the company itself. As of 2015, a 15&amp;nbsp;[[Megawatt|MW]] pilot production line is being commissioned in a new facility in [[Niederhasli]], near Zurich, Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.empa.ch/plugin/template/empa/3/158782/---/l=2 |title=With pilot plant inaugurated, Swiss PV start-up Flisom ready to take off |date=12 June 2015 |accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8699">The '''Flood Mythology of China''', or '''Great Flood of China''' ({{CJKV|t=大洪水|s=大洪水|p=Dà Hóngshuǐ}}; also known as {{CJKV|t=洪水|p=Hóngshuǐ}}) is a deluge theme which happened in China. [[Derk Bodde]] (1961) stated that "from all mythological themes in ancient Chinese, the earliest and so far most pervasive is about flood."&lt;ref name=yang&gt;{{cite book|last=Lihui|first=Yang|last2=Deming|first2=An|last3=Anderson|first3=Jessica|title=''Handbook of Chinese Mythology''|year=2005|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-533263-6|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mythology also has shared characteristics with other [[Flood myth|Great Floods]] all over the world,&lt;ref name=mark&gt;{{cite book|title=The flood myths of early China|author=Mark Edward Lewis|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=2006|location=New York|isbn=0-7914-6663-9|page=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it also has unique characteristics or different focuses. Lu Yilu (2002) groups all versions of great flood into three themes: "the heroes controls the flood; "brother-sister marriage to repopulating the world"; and "the flood which is drowning the whole city along with its citizens".&lt;ref name=yang/&gt;

==History and mythology==

===Literary history===
The [[history of China]] as a continuously recorded literary tradition begins with the ancient documents transmitted to posterity through the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]''. According to these, the great-grandson (or fourth successor) of the Yellow Emperor was Yao. Beginning with the reign of Yao, additional literary sources become available, including the ''[[Book of Documents]]'' (collected and edited by Confucius), which begins with the "Canon of Yao" ({{zh|t=堯典}}), describing the events of Yao's reign.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, 65&lt;/ref&gt; Although, the "Canon of Yao" is problematic in regards to textual transmission (at best it seems to represent an early textual reconstruction and at worst a fabrication based on available knowledge or sources from the 3rd or 4th centuries CE). "The Counsels of Great Yu" 大禹謨 is considered to be one of the reliably transmitted pre-Qin texts. In any case, these and other texts of the preserved literature mark the beginnings of the Chinese historical tradition. Other important texts include the poem ''[[Heavenly Questions]]'' collected in the ''[[Chu Ci]]'' which is attributed to [[Qu Yuan]] and the famous mythological compendium ''[[Classic of Mountains and Seas]]'' (''Shanhaijing''). Furthermore, centuries of scholarship have gone into piecing together a narrative from the bits, pieces, and occasionally longer sections found in these and other early sources, sometimes being subjected to heavy editorial handling in terms of viewpoint.

===Collected mythology===
Mythological stories besides having been preserved both in various literary forms, have also been collected from various oral traditions, some of these folktales are still told. Some of these sources are from people of the Han ethnicity and some from other ethnic groups.&lt;ref name=yang/&gt;

==The struggles to control the flood==
The [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] sources narrated the struggles of the [[culture heroes|heroes]] or [[Shen (Chinese religion)|deities]] to control the floods. From all of these stories, the struggle of [[Emperor Yao|Yao]], [[Gun (Chinese)|Gun]], and [[Great Yu|Yu]] is the most obvious in describing the hardness of human effort to control the flood.&lt;ref name=yang/&gt; Much later works from the [[Warring States period]] (''[[Shiben]]'') and ''Diwang Shiji'' (3rd century) were pairing Yu and Nuwa as a couple and their previously uncorrelated stories were then completing each other.&lt;ref name=mark/&gt;

===Gun-Yu Mythology===
{{main|Great flood of Gun-Yu}}
This theme is based on the efforts of [[Great Yu]] (and [[Gun (Chinese)|Gun]]) to control the flood, sometimes is also associated with [[Emperor Yao]] and [[Emperor Shun|Shun]], and the initial efforts of human to domesticated wild animals as [[pack animal]]s and [[livestock]].&lt;ref name=mark/&gt; The theme outline narrates Gun stole [[xirang]] to stop the flood while Great Yu channeled the flood into the [[East Sea (Chinese literature)|sea]] and succeeded to subsided the water level, and so the earth can be [[agriculture (Chinese mythology)|cultivated]].&lt;ref name=yang/&gt; There are so many mythologies which are correlated to this theme, one of which is "Dragon Gate" -a canal through the mountains which was dug by Yu. While he was digging the canal, many of the [[carps]] were swept away and fell, they were so disappointed because they couldn't swim back into the upper level. Yu promised them, if any of the carp could leap through his dam, it would transform into a [[chinese dragon|dragon]], thus the place inherited its name.&lt;ref name=roberts&gt;{{cite book|title=Chinese Mythology A to Z, Edisi kedua|author=Jeremy Roberts|publisher=Chelsea House Publishers|year=2010|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4381-2799-6 |page=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gun-Yu theme is also have political background. [[Huainanzi]] stated that the great flood was caused by [[Gong Gong]] who was use the water to make havoc on the realm of [[Emperor Yao]]. [[Shan Hai Jing]] narrated another version that the flood was caused by [[Xiangliu]], one of [[Gong Gong]]'s minister, and was not Gong Gong himself.&lt;ref name=mark/&gt;

===Nuwa repaired the heaven===
{{main|Nüwa Mends the Heavens}}
The story happened after Goddess [[Nüwa]] created (molded) humanity from yellow clay, brought them into life, and gave them the ability to [[reproduction|reproduce]]. [[Gonggong]] was banging his head into [[Mount Buzhou]], which actually was the pillar to support the heaven. [[Nüwa]] then patched the sky with five-colored pebbles and piled up reeds ashes to stop the flood.&lt;ref name=yang/&gt;

===The extinction of human race===
{{main|Great flood and procreation}}
Chen Jianxian (1996) said that this theme was one of some popular legends which was still being told by more than 40 ethnics in [[China]]. There is a possibility that the myth is rather new because the oldest recorded sources about this myth were from [[Six Dynasties]], save that the oral tradition maybe much older.&lt;ref name=yang/&gt;

The theme was made into several versions, but the outline is about a great flood which was destroyed all the humans all over the world except a pair of brother and sister, or aunt and nephew. Both were forced to [[incest|married]] in order to repopulated the world. One version stated that their children were ordinary humans, while the others said it was a lump of meat, squash, melon, or grindstone; after they opened, cut, or destroyed it, humans emerged.&lt;ref name=yang/&gt;

===Sinking city===
{{main|Sinking city myth (Chinese)}}
This theme have some specific characteristics: one or two people were survived, the statue which was crying blood, and the whole city along with its citizens were sinking. The survivor(s) was being saved by the gods because of his/her benevolent acts; may be an old lady or a devoted son. The blood crying statue was often a [[Chinese guardian lions|stone lion statue]], or sometimes tortoise statue.&lt;ref name=yang/&gt;

==Other flood myths==

===East Sea and Mulberry Field===
{{main|East Sea (Chinese literature)|Mulberry fields (idiom)}}
A less widespread flood myth involves the goddess [[Magu (deity)|Magu]]: this myth involves the cyclic rise and fall of the ocean level over the eons: sometimes the sea floor is under water; at other times, it turns into [[mulberry fields (idiom)|mulberry fields]]. However, the material about Magu seems to be distinct from the idea of a great flood upon the land of China.&lt;ref name=yang/&gt;

One tradition narrates Magu, a benevolent [[Taoist]] lady who lived on the second century. She was reclaiming a very wide seashore water bodies on [[Jiangsu|Kiangsu]] and changing it into mulberry fields.&lt;ref name=roberts/&gt;

===Heyu===
[[Shan Hai Jing]] mentions a pig-like creature with human face, yellow-colored and red-tailed, and it sounds like human singing. The creature is known as ''Heyu''; it preys on human, reptiles, and snakes. It appearance is a sign that there will be a great deluge all over the world.&lt;ref name=richard&gt;{{cite book|title=A Chinese bestiary : strange creatures from the guideways through mountains and seas|author=Richard E.

The peninsula runs in a south-westerly direction into the Aegean Sea, between the [[Dardanelles]] (formally known as the  Hellespont), and the [[Gulf of Saros]] (formally the bay of Melas).

== History ==

=== Antiquity and Middle Ages===
[[File:Thracian chersonese.png|thumb|Map of Thracian Chersonesus.]]
In ancient times, the Gallipoli Peninsula was known as the Thracian Chersonesus (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''χερσόνησος'', "peninsula"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dxerso%2Fnhsos Xερσόνησος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;) to the Greeks and later the Romans. It was the location of several prominent towns, including [[Cardia (Thrace)|Cardia]], [[Pactya]], Callipolis (Gallipoli), Alopeconnesus ({{lang-el|Ἀλωπεκόννησος}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wikimapia.org/18225845/Alopeconnesus|title=Alopeconnesus|work=wikimapia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sestos]], [[Madytos (Thrace)|Madytos]], and [[Elaeus]]. The peninsula was renowned for its [[wheat]]. It also benefited from its strategic importance on the main route between [[Europe]] and [[Asia]], as well as from its control of the shipping route from [[Crimea]]. The city of Sestos was the main crossing-point on the [[Hellespont]].

According to [[Herodotus]], the Thracian tribe of Dolonci ({{lang-el|Δόλογκοι}}) (or "barbarians" according to Cornelius Nepos) held possession of Chersonesus before the Greek colonization. Then, settlers from [[Ancient Greece]], mainly of [[Ionia]]n and [[Aeolians|Aeolian]] stock, founded about 12 cities on the peninsula in the 7th century BC.&lt;ref name="herod_6.34_nepos_1"&gt;Herodotus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=6.34.1 vi. 34]; [[Cornelius Nepos]], ''Lives of Eminent Commanders'', "Miltiades", [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/nepos.htm#Miltiades 1]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Athens|Athenian]] statesman [[Miltiades the Elder]] founded a major Athenian colony there around 560 BC. He took authority over the entire peninsula, building up its defences against incursions from the mainland. It eventually passed to his nephew, the more famous [[Miltiades the Younger]], around 524 BC. The peninsula was abandoned to the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] in 493 BC after the outbreak of the [[Greco-Persian Wars]] (499–478 BC).

The Persians were eventually expelled, after which the peninsula was for a time ruled over by Athens, which enrolled it into the [[Delian League]] in 478 BC. The Athenians established a number of [[cleruchy|cleruchies]] on the Thracian Chersonese and sent an additional 1,000 settlers around 448 BC. Sparta gained control after the decisive battle of [[Aegospotami]] in 404 BC, but the peninsula subsequently reverted to the Athenians. In the 4th century BC, the Thracian Chersonese became the focus of a bitter territorial dispute between Athens and [[Macedon]], whose king [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] sought possession. It was eventually ceded to Philip in 338 BC.

After the death of Philip's son [[Alexander the Great]] in 323 BC, the Thracian Chersonese became the object of contention among [[Diadochi|Alexander's successors]]. [[Lysimachus]] established his capital [[Lysimachia (Thrace)|Lysimachia]] here. In 278 BC, Celtic tribes from [[Galatia]] in Asia Minor settled in the area. In 196 BC, the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] king [[Antiochus III the Great|Antiochus III]] seized the peninsula. This alarmed the Greeks and prompted them to seek the aid of the [[Roman Republic|Romans]], who conquered the Thracian Chersonese, which they gave to their ally [[Eumenes II]] of [[Pergamon]] in 188 BC. At the extinction of the [[Attalid dynasty]] in 133 BC it passed again to the Romans, who from 129 BC administered it in the Roman province of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]]. It was subsequently made a state-owned territory (''ager publicus'') and during the reign of the emperor [[Augustus]] it was imperial property.

The Thracian Chersonese was part of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] from its foundation in 330 AD. In 443 AD, [[Attila the Hun]] invaded the Gallipoli Peninsula during one of the last stages of his grand campaign that year. He captured both Callipolis and Sestus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title =Attila the Hun: Barbarian Terror and the Fall of the Roman Empire| url = https://books.google.gr/books?id=f-YN6NwHqq4C| publisher = Vintage | page = 105| isbn = 978-1844139156| date = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from a brief period from 1204 to 1235, when it was controlled by the [[Republic of Venice]], the [[Byzantine Empire]] ruled the territory until 1356. During the night between  1 and 2  March 1354, a strong earthquake destroyed the city of Gallipoli and its city walls, weakening its defenses.

=== Ottoman era ===
{{further|Sanjak of Gelibolu}}

====Ottoman conquest====
After the devastating 1354 earthquake, the town of Gallipoli was [[Fall of Gallipoli|besieged and captured]] by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], making Gallipoli the first Ottoman stronghold in Europe, and the staging area for their expansion across the [[Balkans]].&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, Roger. 1453: ''The Holy War for Constantinople and the Clash of Islam and the West''. New York: Hyperion, 2005. p 31 {{ISBN|1-4013-0850-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was recaptured for Byzantium by the [[Savoyard Crusade]] in 1366, but the beleaguered Byzantines were forced to hand it back in September 1376. The [[Greeks]] living there were allowed to continue their everyday life. In the 19th century, Gallipoli ({{lang-tr|Gelibolu}}) was a district ([[kaymakamlik]]) in the [[Vilayet of Adrianople]], with about thirty thousand inhabitants: comprising Greeks, Turks, Armenians and Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Catholic|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03183c.htm|title=Callipolis|inline=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Crimean War (1853–56)====
Gallipoli became a major [[military camp|encampment]] for British and French forces in 1854 during the [[Crimean War]], and the harbour was also a stopping-off point on the way to [[Istanbul]] [[Constantinople|(formerly Constantinople]].&lt;ref name = "Plus"&gt;[http://www.pbenyon.plus.com/Crimea/Black_Sea_1854/04_28.html Crimea]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Victorian"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/crimea/usher/despatch.html|title=Charles Usherwood's Service Journal, 1852 – 1856: despatch|work=victorianweb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

British and French engineers constructed, in March 1854, a 11.5 km line of defence to protect the peninsula from a possible Russian attack and so keep control of the route to the [[Mediterranean Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Porter |first=Maj Gen Whitworth |title=History of the Corps of Royal Engineers Vol I |year=1889|publisher=The Institution of Royal Engineers |location=Chatham}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|414}}

====First Balkan War, Persecution of Greeks (1912–13)====
Gallipoli did not experience any more wars until the [[First Balkan War]], when the 1913 [[Battle of Bulair]] and several minor skirmishes took place here.
A dispatch on 7 July 1913 reported that Ottoman troops treated Gallipoli’s Greeks ‘with marked depravity’ as they ‘destroyed, looted, and burned all the Greek villages near Gallipoli’.&lt;ref name="quadrant.org.au"&gt;[https://quadrant.org.au/magazine/2013/04/the-ethnic-cleansing-of-greeks-from-gallipoli-april-1915/ The Ethnic Cleansing of Greeks from Gallipoli, April 1915]&lt;/ref&gt; Many villages were sacked and destroyed completely and also, some Greeks killed. The cause of this savagery of the Turks was their fear that if Thrace was declared autonomous the Greek population may be found numerically superior to the Muslims.&lt;ref name="quadrant.org.au"/&gt;

The Turkish Government, under pre-text that a village was within the firing line, ordered its evacuation within three hours. The residents abandoned everything they possessed, left their village and went to [[Gelibolu|Gallipoli]]. Seven of the Greek villagers who were two minutes late behind the three hours limit allowed for the evacuation were shot by the soldiers. After the Balkan War was over, the exiles were allowed to return. But as the Government allowed only the Turks to rebuild their houses and furnished them, the exiled Greeks were compelled to remain in Gallipoli.&lt;ref name="Persecution_of_the_Greeks_in_Turkey_1914_1918"&gt;{{cite book| title = Persecution of the Greeks in Turkey, 1914–1918| url = https://archive.org/details/persecutionofgre00consrich| publisher = Constantinople [London, Printed by the Hesperia Press]|date=1919}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====World War I: Gallipoli Campaign, Persecution of Greeks (1914–1919)====
{{Main|Gallipoli Campaign}}
[[File:Anzac Cove3.JPG|thumb|[[ANZAC Cove]]]]
[[File:Gallipoli ANZAC Cove Sphinx 2.JPG|thumb|The Sphinx overlooking Anzac Cove]]

During World War I, British and colonial forces attacked the peninsula in 1915, seeking to secure a route to relieve their eastern ally, [[Imperial Russia|Russia]]. The Ottomans set up defensive fortifications along the peninsula and the attackers were eventually repulsed.

In early 1915, attempting to seize a strategic advantage in World War I by capturing [[Istanbul]] (formerly [[Constantinople|Constantinople)]], the British authorised an attack on the peninsula. The first Australian troops landed at [[ANZAC Cove]] on early morning 25 April 1915, and after eight months of heavy fighting the survivors were withdrawn around the end of the year.

The campaign was one of the greatest [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] victories during the war and is considered a major [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] failure. In [[Turkey]], it is regarded as a defining moment in the nation's history: a final surge in the defence of the motherland as the Ottoman Empire crumbled. The struggle formed the basis for the [[Turkish War of Independence]] and the founding of the Republic of Turkey eight years later under [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]], who first rose to prominence as a commander at Gallipoli.

The [[Gallipoli Star (Ottoman Empire)|Gallipoli Star]] was a military decoration created by the Ottoman Empire in 1915 and awarded for the duration of World War I.

The campaign was the first major military action of [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] as independent [[dominion]]s, and is often considered to mark the birth of national consciousness in those nations. The date of the landing, 25 April, is known as "[[Anzac Day]]". It remains the most significant commemoration of military casualties and [[veteran]]s in Australia and New Zealand.

On the Allied side one of Ryder's promoters of the expedition was Britain's First Lord of the Admiralty, [[Winston Churchill]], whose reputation took years to recover.

Prior to the Allied landings in April 1915,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.gr/books?id=6k5HzkboGvcC The Berlin-Baghdad Express-p.251]&lt;/ref&gt; Ottoman Empire deported [[Ottoman Greeks|Greek residents]] from Gallipoli and surrounding region and from the islands in the [[sea of Marmara]], to the interior where they were at the mercy of hostile Turks.&lt;ref name="Terrible Fate"&gt;{{cite book| last =  Lieberman| first = Benjamin | title = Terrible Fate: Ethnic Cleansing in the Making of Modern Europe| url = https://books.google.gr/books?id=UXlfAgAAQBAJ| publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|date=December 2013| pages = 96–97| isbn = 978-1442223196}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="quadrant.org.au"/&gt; The Greeks had little time to pack and the Ottoman authorities permitted them to take only some bedding and the rest was handed over to the Government.&lt;ref name="Terrible Fate"/&gt; Also, Greek houses and properties were plundered by the Turks.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thenationalherald.com/128395/the-meaning-of-gallipoli-to-hellenism/ The Meaning of Gallipoli to Hellenism]&lt;/ref&gt; A testimony of a deportee described how the deportees were forced onto crowded steamers, standing room only; how, on disembarking, men of military age were removed (for forced labour in the [[Labour Battalions (Ottoman Empire)|labour battalions]] of the Ottoman army) and how the rest were ‘scattered… among the farms like ownerless cattle’.&lt;ref name="quadrant.org.au"/&gt;

The Metropolitan of Gallipoli on 17 July 1915, wrote that the extermination of the Christian refugees was methodical.&lt;ref name="Persecution_of_the_Greeks_in_Turkey_1914_1918"/&gt; It also mentions that: "The Turks, like beasts of prey, immediately plundered all the Christians' property and carried it off. The inhabitants and refugees of my district are entirely without shelter, awaiting to be sent no one knows where ...".&lt;ref name="Persecution_of_the_Greeks_in_Turkey_1914_1918"/&gt; In addition many Greeks died from hunger and there were frequent cases of rape among women and young girls, as well as their conversion to [[Islam]].&lt;ref name="Persecution_of_the_Greeks_in_Turkey_1914_1918"/&gt;

====Greco-Turkish War (1919–22)====
Gallipoli was occupied by Greek troops on 4 August 1920 during the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–22)|Greco-Turkish War of 1919–22]], considered part of the [[Turkish War of Independence]], and after the [[Armistice of Mudros]] it became a Greek prefecture centre as "Kallipolis". However, Greece was forced to withdraw from Eastern Thrace after the [[Armistice of Mudanya]]. Gallipoli was briefly handed over to British troops on 20 October 1922, but was finally returned to Turkish rule on 26 November 1922.

In 1920, after the defeat of the [[White movement|Russian White army]] of General [[Pyotr Wrangel]], a significant number of [[white emigre|emigre soldiers]] and their families evacuated to Gallipoli from the [[Crimean Peninsula]]. From there, many went to European countries, such as [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], where they found refuge. A stone monument was erected and a special "Gallipoli cross" was created to commemorate the soldiers, who stayed in Gallipoli.{{dubious |Sentence makes little sense. Who did the monument commemorate? Did Russian "whites" stay on in ~?|date=October 2016}} The stone monument was destroyed during an earthquake, but in January 2008 reconstruction of the monument had begun with the consent of the Turkish government.

===Turkish Republic===
Between 1923 and 1926 Gallipoli became the centre of Gelibolu Province, comprising the districts of Gelibolu, [[Eceabat]], [[Keşan]] and [[Şarköy]]. After the dissolution of the province, it became a district centre in [[Çanakkale Province]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2156">'''Interior Radiation Control Coating Systems''' (IRCCS), sometimes referred to as [[Radiant barrier|radiant barrier coatings]], are paints designed to provide [[thermal insulation]] to buildings. 

==Standards==
The American Society for Testing and Materials ([[ASTM International|ASTM]]) and the Reflective Insulation Manufacturer's Association (RIMA) have established an industry standard for evaluating paints claiming to have insulating characteristics.  The energy conserving property has been defined as [[thermal emittance]] (the ability of a surface to release [[radiant energy]] that it has absorbed).  Those coatings qualified as Interior Radiation Control Coatings must show a thermal emittance of 0.25 or less.  This means that an IRCCS will block 75% or more of the [[heat transfer|radiant heat transfer]]. 
These low "E" coatings were originally developed in 1978 at the Solar Energy Corporation (SOLEC) in Princeton, New Jersey for use in tubular evacuated solar collectors. The developer, Robert Aresty, designed them to be used as low emissivity surfaces 
on glass to replace vacuum deposited surfaces. While SOLEC was doing collaborative work with the Florida Solar Energy Center (FSEC), Phillip Fairey,  research director at FSEC and world-renowned researcher in radiant barriers discovered the availability of these coatings in the SOLEC labs. He immediately grasped that they might be used as a replacement for foil radiant barriers, and proceeded to perform experiments verifying their viability for this use. In 1986 these coatings were applied for the first commercial application in homes built by Centex Corporation.

==Uses==
Uses of IRCCS includes residential and commercial building insulation, as well as industrial and automotive applications.

The stone is known to have been processed by [[Neanderthal]]s.&lt;ref name=broodbank /&gt; In slightly more recent times, lapis Lacedaemonius has been used for making [[Minoan sealstone]]s and vases, both [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] and [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenean]]. It also was used as an element in decorative elements created with [[opus sectile]] technique (with examples known from [[Ostia Antica]] and [[Nemi]]) during Roman times, as well as in several churches in [[Rome]] (e.g. [[Santa Prassede]]) and in the pavement of [[St. Peter's Square]].&lt;ref name=ISPRA /&gt;&lt;ref name=corsi /&gt; Its use is mentioned by [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]. During the [[Middle Ages]] it was employed in mosaics in e.g. [[Palermo]], [[Constantinople]], and [[Santiago de Compostela]].&lt;ref name=broodbank /&gt; Furthermore, Roman and Byzantine decorative stones frequently were reused up until the eighteenth century. For example, in [[St. Mark's Basilica]], [[Venice]] and also as far away from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] as in [[Westminster Abbey]], [[London]].&lt;ref name=wilson /&gt;

The stone from Krokees comes from a [[lava dome]] approximately 230 million years old. Its light spots are [[plagioclase]], which over time has turned into [[albite]] and [[epidote]]. In places, iron minerals have oxidized into [[hematite]], giving it a reddish tone. Geologically similar rock, equally exploited during antiquity, may be found on [[Samothrace]].&lt;ref name=wilson /&gt;

This '''list of earthquakes in Taiwan''' charts significant earthquakes which have affected the island of [[Taiwan]].

Taiwan is in a seismically active zone, on the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]], and at the western edge of the [[Philippine Sea Plate]].&lt;ref name=TY2005-23&gt;Taiwan Yearbook 2005, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Geologists have identified 42 [[active fault]]s on the island, but most of the earthquakes detected in Taiwan are due to the convergence of the Philippine Sea plate and the [[Eurasian Plate]] to the east of the island.&lt;ref name=TY2005-23/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yu |first=S.B. |authorlink= |author2=Chen, H.Y. |author3=Kuo, L.C.  |year=1997 |title=Velocity field of GPS stations in the Taiwan area |journal=Tectonophysics |volume= 274|issue=274 |pages=41–59 |id= |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0040195196002971 |accessdate= |quote= |doi=10.1016/S0040-1951(96)00297-1 |bibcode=1997Tectp.274...41Y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the earthquakes registered in Taiwan actually occur off the east coast and cause little damage, whereas smaller quakes beneath the island itself have historically proven more destructive. The first recorded earthquake in Taiwan was in 1624, the founding year of [[Dutch Formosa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scman.cwb.gov.tw/eqv5/damage_list/1900befor.htm|publisher=Central Weather Bureau|accessdate=2009-07-20|script-title=二十世紀前 (1604–1900) 台灣地區的地震記載}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1901 and the year 2000 there were 91 major earthquakes in Taiwan, 48 of them resulting in loss of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scman.cwb.gov.tw/eqv5/damage_list/1900after.htm|script-title=zh:二十世紀 (1901–2000) 台灣地區災害性地震|publisher=[[Central Weather Bureau]]|accessdate=2009-07-17|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent major earthquake was the [[921 earthquake]], which struck on 21 September 1999, and claimed 2,415 lives.

Many modern buildings in Taiwan are constructed with earthquake safety in mind, including [[Taipei 101]], which had to cope with the dual challenges of being flexible enough to withstand earthquakes, yet rigid enough to resist wind shear. The [[Taiwan High Speed Rail|High Speed Rail]] system incorporates an automatic safety device to safely bring all trains to a halt when a significant earthquake is detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asahi.com/english/nation/TKY200410260129.html|title=SHATTERED BELIEF: Biting the bullet|publisher=Asahi Shimbun|accessdate=2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, poor construction standards have been blamed for casualties in a number of major earthquakes, including the [[1906 Meishan earthquake]] and the [[921 earthquake]]. Inside Taiwan the [[Central Weather Bureau]] is the organisation responsible for monitoring and reporting on earthquakes. Large earthquakes are also assessed by the [[United States Geological Survey]]. Scientific studies of the seismology of the island started in the [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese era]], when the first seismograph was installed in Taipei by [[Fusakichi Omori]]'s company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d-08AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA223|title=The Founders of Seismology|last=Davidson|first=Charles|year=1927|page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Earthquakes ==

Significant earthquakes are listed here from 1736 to the present. Starting with the [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese era]] in 1895 there were major improvements in detection technology, allowing more detailed gathering of data.

Retrieved on 17 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; with mostly [[tectonics|tectonic]] earthquakes in the southeast and [[induced seismicity|induced]] earthquakes in the northeast. The [[Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute]] started with seismic registrations in 1904. The heaviest earthquake was the [[1992 Roermond earthquake]] with a magnitude of 5.8.

== Seismic registration ==
The first time that seismic activity in the Netherlands was registered by the [[Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute]] (KNMI) in [[De Bilt]] was on 26 June 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.knmi.nl/cms/content/28675/eerste_seismische_registratie_in_de_bilt Eerste seismische registratie in De Bilt] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140628200228/http://www.knmi.nl/cms/content/28675/eerste_seismische_registratie_in_de_bilt |date=2014-06-28 }}, [[Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute]], 2009. Retrieved on 17 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tectonic earthquakes ==
The natural earthquakes that occur in the southeast of the Netherlands are caused by active rifts of the [[European Cenozoic Rift System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.knmi.nl/cms/content/27377/natuurlijke_aardbevingen_in_zuid-nederland Natuurlijke aardbevingen in Zuid-Nederland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112162603/http://www.knmi.nl/cms/content/27377/natuurlijke_aardbevingen_in_zuid-nederland |date=2014-11-12 }}, [[Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute]], 2007. Retrieved on 17 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1992 Roermond earthquake]] in the southeastern province of [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]] was the heaviest registered earthquake in the Netherlands. It had a magnitude of 5.8 and occurred in [[Roermond]] on 13 April 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.knmi.nl/cms/content/27523/aardbeving_bij_roermond_13_april_1992 Aardbeving bij Roermond 13 april 1992] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205220210/http://www.knmi.nl/cms/content/27523/aardbeving_bij_roermond_13_april_1992 |date=5 December 2013 }}, [[Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute]], 2010. Retrieved on 17 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Induced earthquakes ==
Since 1986, there have been around 1,000 [[Induced seismicity|induced]] earthquakes in the northeast of the Netherlands caused by the exploitation of the [[Groningen gas field]] near [[Slochteren]]. The heaviest registered earthquake in the northeastern province of [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]] had a magnitude of 3.6 and occurred in [[Huizinge]] on 16 August 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.knmi.nl/cms/content/22993/aardbevingen_door_gaswinning_in_noord-nederland Aardbevingen door gaswinning in Noord-Nederland], [[Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute]], 2013. Retrieved on 17 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
This event count shows a remarkable exponential growth in time, pointing to one event per day in 2025. While moderate in magnitude, the sheer number of events acts as a physical stressor to living conditions and gives an adverse outlook long term on structural integrity of homes and buildings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://121.183.206.200:8080/proto.board/abstractArticleContentView?page=article&amp;journal=eas&amp;volume=11&amp;num=5&amp;ordernum=7&amp;site=korsc], van Putten, M.H.P.M., van Putten, A.F.P., &amp; van Putten, M.J.A.M., 2016, Earthquakes and Structures, 11, 861&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Eshtaol Forest.jpg|thumb|Eshtaol, a [[Jewish National Fund|JNF]] forest in Israel]]
The '''forests of contemporary Israel''' are mainly the result of a massive afforestation campaign by the [[Jewish National Fund]] (JNF). This article is a list of these [[forests]].

In the 19th Century and up to [[World War I]], the [[Ottoman empire]] cleared the land of Israel of its [[natural reserve]]s of [[pine]] and [[oak]] trees, in order to build [[railways]] across the empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rejsen rundt i Israel|last=|first=|publisher=Politikkens forlag|year=1997|isbn=87-567-5751-4|location=Denmark|pages=127-128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since it was founded the JNF has planted in [[Israel]] more than 185 million trees creating 280 forests, and still operates today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/PressRoom/1997/Pages/CONSERVATION%20OF%20BIOLOGICAL%20DIVERSITY%20IN%20ISRAEL%20-%20O.aspx|title=CONSERVATION OF BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY IN ISRAEL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Solar terms}}
&lt;div style="clear: right; float: right; margin: 0em 0em 1em 1em;"&gt;{{Mangzhong}}&lt;/div&gt;
The traditional East Asian calendars divide a year into 24 [[solar term]]s.

'''''Mángzhòng''''', ''Bōshu'', ''Mangjong'', or ''Mang chủng'' is the ninth solar term. It begins when the Sun reaches the [[celestial longitude]] of 75° and ends when it reaches the longitude of 90°. It more often refers in particular to the day when the Sun is exactly at the celestial longitude of 75°. In the [[Gregorian calendar]], it usually begins around June 5 (June 6 East Asia time) and ends around June 21. 

Introduction of Grain in Ear (芒种)
“grain in ear” means the grains are mature. It happens around June 5 every year when the Sun reaches the celestial longitude of 75 degrees. During this period, crops like barley and wheat all get mature and are waiting to be harvested. In Chinese, “Grain in Ear” is called Mang Zhong. ''Mang'' means grains at the same time busy. It forecasts the farmer is getting back to the busy field work. 

It is the busiest time to seed millet and the deadline for sowing activities. During this period, areas around the middle stream and downstream of the Yangtze River enter the rainy season. Sensing the wetness, the mantis comes out, the shrike starts to sing and the mockingbird stops tweet.

The arrival of Grain in Ear signifies the ripening of awny crops such as wheat and it is also a busy period for farmers. That can be seen from many farm sayings. One of the sayings is, “Getting busy with farm work in Grain in Ear,” prevailing in many provinces. Grain in Ear is especially critical for planting rice. There is a saying in Guizhou that goes, “If you don’t plant rice in Grain in Ear, planting will be in vain.”

==Traditional customs==
As the flowers withered away, people in old times used to hold the ceremony to sacrifice for the “God of Flowers”, showing their gratitude and their eagerness to see the flowers again next year. This custom is already long gone and people can only read the scene in some of the ancient novels. In China’s south Anhui province, people steam dumplings with new fresh wheat flour after seeding the paddy rice. They make the flour into different shapes such as cereals, animals, vegetables, and fruits, color them and pray for villagers’ safety.

==Healthy living tips==
The best food to eat during “Grain in Ear” period, as suggested by Chinese doctors, is mulberry. Around two thousand years ago, mulberry had already been considered as royal food and among the folk, it was called the “holy fruit”. It has abundant glucose, cane sugar, Vitamin A, B and C and many mineral substances and is very good for humans' heart, liver, and kidney.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3981">The '''Meghalaya subtropical forests''' is a montane [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|subtropical moist broadleaf forest]] [[ecoregion]] of eastern [[India]]. The ecoregion covers an area of {{convert|41,700|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}, encompassing the [[Khasi Hills]], [[Garo Hills]], and [[Jaintia Hills]] of India's [[Meghalaya]] state, and adjacent portions of [[Assam]] state. The ecoregion is one of the most [[biodiversity|species-rich]] in India with a rich diversity of birds, mammals, and plants.

==Flora==
The ecoregion covers those portions of the Khasi, Garo, and Jaintia hills lying above 1000 meters elevation. The subtropical forests lies between the tropical lowlands of the [[Lower Gangetic Plains moist deciduous forests]] to the south and west, and the [[Brahmaputra Valley semi-evergreen forests]] to the north.

It is one of the wettest ecoregions in the world, with some places, notably [[Mawsynram]] and [[Cherrapunji]], receiving up to eleven meters of rain in a year.

It is a center of diversity for the tree genera ''[[Magnolia]]'' and ''[[Michelia]]'', and the families [[Elaeocarpaceae]] and [[Elaeagnaceae]]. Over 320 species of [[orchid]]s are native to Meghalaya. The endemic [[pitcher plant]] (''[[Nepenthes khasiana]]'') is now an endangered species. About 3,128 flowering plant species have been reported from the state, of which 1,236 are [[endemic]].&lt;ref&gt;Khan et al., 1997&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]], a British botanist and explorer, made a huge taxonomic collection for the [[Kew Herbarium]] from Khasi and Jaintia Hills and remarked the place as one of the richest [[biodiversity]] spot in India, perhaps in all of Asia as well.&lt;ref&gt;Hooker, 1872-97&lt;/ref&gt; The state is rich in [[medicinal plant]] species as well, but the natural occurrence of most medicinal plants has decreased due to [[habitat]] loss. A total of 131 RET (Rare, Endemic and Threatened) medicinal plant species, including 36 [[endemic]] and 113 species under different threat categories, are found within the state.&lt;ref&gt;Mir et al., 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fauna==
The ecoregion is home to 110 species of mammals, none of which are endemic. Species include the [[tiger]] (''Panthera tigris''), [[clouded leopard]] (''Pardofelis nebulosa''), [[Asian elephant]] (''Elephas maximus''), [[dhole]] or Asiatic wild dog (''Cuon alpinus''), [[sun bear]] (''Ursus malayanus''), [[sloth bear]] (''Melursus ursinus''), [[smooth-coated otter]] (''Lutrogale perspicillata''), [[Indian civet]] (''Viverra zibetha''), [[Chinese pangolin]] (''Manis pentadactyla''), [[Indian pangolin]] (''Manis crassicaudata''), [[Assamese macaque]] (''Macaca assamensis''), [[bear macaque]] (''Macaca arctoides''), [[capped leaf monkey]] (''Semnopithecus pileatus''), and [[hoolock gibbon]] (''Hylobates hoolock'').

A '''Molniya orbit''' ({{lang-rus|Молния|p=ˈmolnʲɪjə|a=Ru-молния.ogg}}, "Lightning") is a type of satellite orbit. It is a [[highly elliptical orbit]] with an [[inclination]] of 63.4 [[Degree (angle)|degree]]s, an [[argument of perigee]] of 270 degrees and an [[orbital period]] of approximately half a [[sidereal time|sidereal day]].&lt;ref name="exam"&gt;{{cite conference|url=http://issfd.org/ISSFD_2009/CollisionRiskII/Kolyuka.pdf |title=Examination of the Lifetime, Evolution and Re-Entry Features for the "Molniya" Type Orbits |date=28 September 2009|first1=Yu.

The high inclination of Molniya orbits provides a high [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of view]] to communications and monitoring satellites covering high latitudes.  The high [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] provides a longer dwell time over the [[Hemispheres of Earth|hemisphere]] of interest, compared to a more circular orbit.  [[Geostationary orbit]]s, which are necessarily inclined over the [[equator]], can only view these regions from a low angle, and are unable to view latitudes above 81 degrees.&lt;ref name="gsmo"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=K9Q5DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA57&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;dq=molniya+satellite+history&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WVljCbUj_R&amp;sig=DRiwwNiV1Kjs69vLbiDLJT4oLU4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwitpNuHrIzaAhVDTLwKHU0WAdU4ChDoAQhZMAs#v=onepage&amp;q=molniya%20satellite%20history&amp;f=false |title=Global Satellite Meteorological Observation (GSMO) Theory, Volume 1 |publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=978-3-319-67119-2 |author=Stojče Dimov Ilčev|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first use of the Molniya orbit was by the communications satellite series [[Molniya (satellite)|of the same name]]. After two launch failures in 1964, the first successful satellite to use this orbit, Molniya 1-01, launched on April 23, 1965. The early Molniya-1 satellites were primarily used for long-range military communications, but were also fitted with cameras used for weather monitoring and/or assessing clear areas for spy satellites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A History of Soviet/Russian Meteorological Satellites|url=http://www.bis-space.com/belgium/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/meteor.pdf|first=Bart|last=Hendrickx|page=66|website=Bis-Space.com|location=Antwerpen, Belgium|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original Molniya satellites had a lifespan of approximately 1.5 years, as their orbits were disrupted by [[Orbital perturbation analysis|perturbations]], and they had to be constantly replaced.&lt;ref name="exam"/&gt;

Its successor, the Molniya-2, provided both military and civilian broadcasting, and was used to create the [[Orbita (TV system)|Orbita]] [[television network]], spanning the Soviet Union. These were in turn replaced by the Molniya-3 design,&lt;ref name="Martin2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Donald H.|title=Communication Satellites|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_azf94TByF8C&amp;pg=PA218|accessdate=1 January 2013|year=2000|publisher=AIAA|isbn=9781884989094|pages=215–}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by the Mayak and [[Meridian (satellite)|Meridian]] satellites in 1997 and 2002 respectively.&lt;ref name=astronautix&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/m/molniyaorbit.html|title=Molniya orbit |publisher=Astronautix|author=Mark Wade |accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian [[US-K]] early-warning satellites, which watch for US missile launches were launched in Molniya orbits from 1967, as part of the [[Oko]] system.&lt;ref name="cato"&gt;{{cite journal

From 1971, the American [[Jumpseat (satellite)|Jumpseat]] and [[Trumpet (satellite)|Trumpet]] satellites were launched into Molniya orbits, and possibly used to strategically intercept Soviet communications from the Molniya satellites. Detailed information about both projects remains classified as of 2018.&lt;ref name=astronautix/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2017/09/atlas-v-preparing-to-launch-nrol-42/ |publisher=NASA spaceflight |title=Atlas V launches NROL-42 spy satellite |author=William Graham |date=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was followed by the American [[Satellite Data System|SDS]] constellation, which operates with a mix of Molniya and geostationary orbits. These satellites are used to relay imagery from lower flying satellites back to ground stations in the United States and have been active in some capacity since 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffrey T Richelson|date=2002|title=The Wizards of Langley. Inside the CIA's Directorate of Science and Technology.|publisher=Westview press |isbn=0813340594 |location=Boulder}}&lt;/ref&gt; A single classified communication satellite launch in 1998 may be related to this constellation.&lt;ref name=astronautix/&gt;

A Russian satellite constellation called Nord (and later, Tyulpan) was designed to support mobile communications at high latitudes, in a similar manner to the [[Iridium satellite constellation|Iridium constellation]], but it did not progress past the planning phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/nord.html |title=Nord:Connecting the north |publisher=Russian Space Web |author=Anatoly Zak |accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Much of the area of the former Soviet Union, and Russia in particular, is located at high latitudes. To broadcast to these latitudes from a geostationary orbit (above the Earth's [[equator]]) would require considerable power due to the low [[angle of incidence (optics)|elevation angles]]. A satellite in a Molniya orbit is better suited to communications in these regions because it looks directly down on them during large portions of its orbit. With an apogee altitude as high as 40,000&amp;nbsp;km, and a sub-satellite point of 63.4 degrees north, it spends a considerable portion of its orbit with excellent visibility of the Northern Hemisphere, from the Russian Federation but also from Northern Europe, Greenland and Canada.&lt;ref name="gsmo"/&gt;

While Molniya orbits require considerably less launch energy than geostationary orbits (especially from Russia),&lt;ref name="rus"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://geektimes.com/post/260316/ |publisher=Geek Times |title=Soviet orbital trick|accessdate=23 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the ground station needs a steerable antenna to track the spacecraft, links must be switched between satellites, the range is varying, there is a greater need for [[Orbital station-keeping|station keeping]],&lt;ref name="smad" /&gt;&lt;ref name="art"&gt;{{cite article|url=https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/1520-0426%281990%29007%3C0517%3AOTUOSI%3E2.0.CO%3B2 |page=517 |date=18 August 1989 |journal=Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology|volume=7|title= On the Use of Satellites in Molniya Orbits of Meteorological Observation of Middle and High Latitudes |first1=Stanley Q. |last1=Kidder |first2=Thomas H. |last2=Vonder Haar}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Orbital Lifetime of Molniya Satellites|journal=Jbis-journal of The British Interplanetary Society|volume=28|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/252561825_The_orbital_lifetime_of_Molniya_satellites|first=D. G.|last=King-Hele|date=1975|pages=783–796}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the spacecraft will pass through the [[Van Allen radiation belt]] four times per day.&lt;ref name="rus"/&gt;

==Properties==
A typical Molniya orbit, has:

* Semi-major axis: 26,600{{nbsp}}km
* Eccentricity: 0.74
* Inclination: 63.4°&lt;ref name="art"/&gt;
* Argument of perigee: 280°
* Period: 718 minutes&lt;ref name="exam"/&gt;

It is necessary to have a constellation of at least three spacecraft for permanent high elevation coverage of a large area, like the whole of Russia where some parts are as far south as 45°{{nbsp}}N. If three spacecraft are used, each spacecraft is active for periods of eight hours per orbit centered at apogee&lt;ref name="gsmo"/&gt; as illustrated in figure 9. 

The Earth completes half a rotation in 12 hours, so the apogees of successive Molniya orbits will alternate between one half of the northern hemisphere and the other. For the original Molniya orbit, this places the apogees over Russia and Canada, but by changing the [[longitude of the ascending node|right ascension of the ascending node]] this could be varied. For example, if the apogee longitudes are 90° E and 90°{{nbsp}}W, the apogees will alternately serve Europe and Asia (see figures 3 to 5) and next North America (see figures 6 to 8).

The orbits of the three spacecraft should then have the same orbital parameters, but different right ascension of the ascending nodes, with their passes over the apogees (for example 90°{{nbsp}}W and 90°{{nbsp}}E) separated by 7.97 hours.&lt;ref name="gsmo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|url=https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/1520-0426%281990%29007%3C0517%3AOTUOSI%3E2.0.CO%3B2 |page=519 |date=18 August 1989 |journal=Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology|volume=7|title= On the Use of Satellites in Molniya Orbits of Meteorological Observation of Middle and High Latitudes |first1=Stanley Q. |last1=Kidder |first2=Thomas H. |last2=Vonder Haar}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since each satellite has an operational period of 8 hours, when one spacecraft travels four hours after its apogee passage (see figure 5 or figure 8), the next satellite will enter its operational period. The next satellite will have a view of the earth shown in figure 3 (or figure 6) and the switch-over can take place. Note that the two spacecraft at the time of switch-over are separated about 1500&amp;nbsp;km, so that the ground stations only have to move the antennas a few degrees to acquire the new spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7565492 |page=9947 |volume=4 |year=2016 |title=Systems Engineering of a Terabit Elliptic Orbit Satellite and Phased Array Ground Station for IoT Connectivity and Consumer Internet Access |author=R. L. Sturdivant, E. K. P. Chon |journal=IEEE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orbital inclination===
In general, the [[oblate spheroid|oblateness]] of the Earth [[Orbital perturbation analysis|perturbs the argument of perigee]] (&lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;), so that even if the apogee started near the north pole, it would gradually move, according to equation {{EquationNote|1}}, unless constantly corrected with station-keeping thruster burns. 

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\Delta\omega = -2\pi\; \frac{J_2}{\mu p^2}\; 3\left(\frac{5}{4} \sin^2 i - 1\right)&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the gravitational constant, &lt;math&gt;J_2&lt;/math&gt; is the perturbing factor, and &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the [[conic section|semi-latus rectum]]. 

To avoid this expenditure of fuel, the Molniya orbit uses an inclination of 63.4°, for which these perturbations are zero.&lt;ref name="smad"&gt;{{cite book|title=Space Mission Analysis and Design |editor=Wiley J. Larson and James R. Wertz |publisher=Microcosm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="art"/&gt; At this inclination the factor &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{5}{4} \sin^2 i - 1\right)&lt;/math&gt; is zero, so there is no change in perigee over time.

===Orbital period===
To ensure the geometry relative to the ground stations repeats every 24 hours the [[nodal period]] should be about half a [[sidereal day]], keeping the longitudes of the apogees passages constant. 

However, the [[oblate spheroid|oblateness]] of the Earth also perturbs the right ascension of the [[Orbital node|ascending node]] (&lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;), which would cause the [[ground track]] to drift over time at the rate shown in equation {{EquationNote|2}}. 

{{NumBlk|:| &lt;math&gt;\Delta\Omega = -2\pi\; \frac{J_2}{\mu p^2}\; \frac{3}{2}\cos i&lt;/math&gt; |{{EquationRef|2}}}}

Since the inclination of a Molniya orbit is set, this perturbation is &lt;math&gt;\Delta \Omega = -0.0742&lt;/math&gt; degrees per orbit. To compensate, the orbital period is adjusted so that the longitude of the apogee changes enough to cancel out this effect.&lt;ref name="art"/&gt;

===Eccentricity===
The eccentricity of the orbit is based on the differences in altitudes of its apogee and perigee. To maximise the amount of time that the satellite spends over the apogee the eccentricity should be [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion#Second law of Kepler|as high as possible]].

However, the perigee needs to be high enough to keep the satellite above the atmosphere to avoid drag, and the orbital period needs to be approximately half a sidereal day. These two factors constrain the eccentricity, which becomes approximately 0.737.&lt;ref name="art"/&gt;

==Modelling==
To track satellites using Molniya orbits, scientists use the SDP4 [[simplified perturbations models|simplified perturbations model]], which calculates the location of a satellite based on orbital shape, drag, radiation, gravitation effects from the sun and moon, and earth resonance terms.&lt;ref name="spacetrackreport"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Hoots |first=Felix R.|author2=Ronald L. Roehrich |title=Models for Propagation of NORAD Element Sets|journal=United States Department of Defense Spacetrack Report|date=31 December 1988|issue=3|url=http://www.celestrak.com/NORAD/documentation/spacetrk.pdf|accessdate=16 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mount Abu''' ({{audio|Mount_Abu.ogg|pronunciation}}) is a popular [[hill station]] in the [[Aravalli Range]] in [[Sirohi district]] of [[Rajasthan]] state in western [[India]], near the border with [[Gujarat]]. The mountain forms a distinct rocky plateau 22&amp;nbsp;km long by 9&amp;nbsp;km wide. The highest peak on the mountain is [[Guru Shikhar]] at {{convert|1722|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level. It is referred to as 'an oasis in the desert' as its heights are home to rivers, lakes, waterfalls and evergreen forests.  The nearest train station is [[Abu Road railway station]]: 28&amp;nbsp;km away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mountabu.com/how_to_reach.html|title=How to reach Mount Abu by Road, Air Or Rail|last=Agarwal|first=Deepesh|website=www.mountabu.com|access-date=2017-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The ancient name of Mount Abu is Arbudaanchal. In the [[Puranas]], the region has been referred to as ''Arbudaranya'' ("forest of ''Arbhuda''") and 'Abu' is a diminutive of this ancient name. It is believed that sage [[Vashistha]] retired to the southern spur at Mount Abu following his differences with sage [[Vishvamitra]]. There is another mythology according to which a serpent named "Arbuda" saved the life of Nandi (Lord Shiva's bull). The incident happened on the mountain that is currently known as Mount Abu and so the mountain is named "Arbudaranya" after that incident which gradually became Abu.

The conquest of Mount Abu in 1311 CE by Rao Lumba of Deora-Chauhan dynasty brought to an end the reign of the Parmars and marked the decline of Mount Abu. He shifted the capital city to Chandravati in the plains. After the destruction of Chandravati in 1405, Rao Shasmal made Sirohi his headquarters. Later it was leased by the British government from the then Maharaja of Sirohi for use as the headquarters.

===Mount Abu and Gurjars===
The [[Arbuda Mountains]] (Abu Parvat ' Mount Abu) region is said to be original abode of the famous [[Gurjar]]s. The association of the Gurjars with the mountain is noticed in many inscriptions and epigraphs including ''Tilakamanjari of Dhanpala''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tilakamañjarī of Dhanapāla: a critical and cultural study|author=Sudarśana Śarmā|publisher=Parimal Publications|year=2002|page=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; These Gurjars (Gujars or Gujjars) migrated from the Arbuda mountain region. As early as sixth century CE, they set up one or more principalities in [[Rajasthan]] and [[Gujarat]]. Almost all or a larger part of Rajasthan and Gujarat had been known as ''Gurjaratra'' (country ruled or protected by the Gurjars) or ''Gurjarabhumi'' (land of the Gurjars) for centuries before the Mughal period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The History and Culture of the Indian People: The classical age|author1=Ramesh Chandra Majumdar|author2=Achut Dattatrya Pusalker|author3=A.

===Mount Abu and Rajputs===

According to a legend, sage [[Vashistha]] performed a great [[yajna]] at the peak of Mount Abu, to seek from the gods a provision for the defense of righteousness on earth. In answer to his prayer, a youth arose from the Agnikunda (fire-altar) — the first [[Agnivansha|Agnivansha Rajput]].&lt;ref name="Barua24"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FIIQhuAOGaIC&amp;pg=PA24 |page=24 |title=The State at War in South Asia |first=Pradeep |last=Barua |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |year=2005 |isbn=9780803213449}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=K7ZZzk8cXh8C&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=rajputs+origin+fire++mount+abu&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_SJnVM2aBcGeugSk44C4Bw&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; Achalgarh Fort is one of more attracting place which was built by Parmar Rajput kings.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.in/books/about/The_Rajputs_of_Rajputana.html?id=lF0FvjG3GWEC&lt;/ref&gt; Dilwara temple built by mahipala Soalanki (Chalukyu).&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.in/books/about/Rajput_Er.html?id=jfHDbwAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y&lt;/ref&gt;

Mount Abu town, the only [[hill station]] in Rajasthan, is at an elevation of {{convert|1220|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. It has been a popular retreat from the heat of Rajasthan and neighbouring [[Gujarat]] for centuries. The [[Mount Abu Wildlife Sanctuary]] was established in 1960 and covers 290&amp;nbsp;km² of the mountain.

The mountain is home to several [[Hindu temple]]s, including the Adhar Devi Temple (also known as Arbuda Devi Temple), carved out of solid rock; the Shri Raghunathji Temple; and a shrine and temple to [[Dattatreya]] built atop the [[Guru Shikhar]] peak and a number of [[Jain temple]]s including [[Dilwara Temples]], a complex of temples carved of white [[marble]] built between the 11th and 13th centuries CE. The oldest of these is the Vimal Vasahi temple, built in 1021 CE by Vimal Shah and dedicated to the first of the Jain [[Tirthankara]]s. They include the Achaleswar Mahadev Temple (1412) and the Kantinath Temple (1513). It is the location of the headquarters of the [[Brahma Kumaris]].

The [[Achalgarh Fort]], built in the 14th century by [[Kumbha of Mewar]], is nearby and at its center is the popular visitor attraction of the [[Nakki Lake]]. The Toad Rock is on a hill near the lake. Close to the fort is the [[Achaleshwar Mahadev Temple]], a popular [[Shiva]] temple.

The [[Durga]] Ambika Mata Temple lies in a cleft of rock in Jagat, just outside Mount Abu town.

In Mount Abu, the faith community of [[Brahma Kumaris]] has its spiritual headquarters, which are represented by its own account in 110 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.brahmakumaris.org/whoweare/headquarters | title=Official Website of the Brahma Kumaris | accessdate =2013-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every year about 2.5 million visitors are supposed to visit the sprawling campus of that spiritual movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://brahmakumaris.org/whoweare/headquarters | title= Official Website of the Brahma Kumaris, Spiritual Headquarters: Mount Abu | accessdate =2013-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there are hundreds of hotels for tourists, some Dharamshalas can be found for as low as Rs.700 per night. 

In summer thousands of people come here. To reach Mount Abu, the nearest approach by road is from Abu Road which is 27&amp;nbsp;km.

The setting sun scene on Mount Abu is a notable tourist attraction,  and depicted in the film ''[[Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak]]''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;http://www.google.com&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6441">[[File:Nantosuelta HistMusPfalz 3482a.jpg|thumb|A depiction of Nantosuelta from [[Speyer]], showing her distinctive sceptre and birds. The head of [[Sol (mythology)|Sol]] can be seen in the [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]].]]
In [[Celtic mythology]], '''Nantosuelta''' is the goddess of nature, the earth, fire and fertility.

Pseudo-historical texts explain how there is an uncanny resemblance between Nantosuelta and what we know of the Irish goddess  [[The Morrígan]] who was associated with death and war. Evidence suggests that Nantosuelta was the name given to the goddess [[The Morrígan]] after a transformation or joining of new alliances.&lt;ref&gt;Heichelheim &amp; Housman, 314.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mediomatrici]] ([[Alsace]], [[Lorrain (province)|Lorraine]]) depicted her in [[art]] as holding a round house on a pole and with a crow. Other likely depictions show her with a pot or bee hive. Nantosuelta's round house was a symbol of her connection to the faery habitation of her Irish counterpart and may have symbolized abundance. It was believed that Nantosuelta transformed into a crow on the battlefield, which was an appropriate transformation for the goddess or may have been a metaphor for her ability to powerfully navigate a battlefield.&lt;ref&gt;Heichelheim &amp; Housman.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nantosuelta is often associated with water and depicted as being surrounded by water. The goddess's name literally translates as 'of winding stream' or 'sun-drenched valley'.&lt;ref&gt;Journeying to the Goddess: [https://journeyingtothegoddess.wordpress.com/2012/02/11/goddess-nantosuelta The Goddess Nantusuelda], Weblog Februari 11, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
Nantosuelta is attested by statues, and by inscriptions.

== Depictions ==
[[File:Nantosuelta-Sucellus.jpg|180px|left|thumb|Relief of Nantosuelta and Sucellus from Sarrebourg]] 
In this relief from [[Sarrebourg]], near [[Metz]], Nantosuelta, wearing a long gown is standing to the left. In her left hand she holds a small house-shaped object with two circular holes and a peaked roof. Her right hand holds a [[patera]] which she is tipping onto a cylindrical altar. 
To the right [[Sucellus]] stands, bearded, in a tunic with a cloak on his right shoulder. He holds his mallet in his right hand and an [[olla]] in his left. 
Above the figures is a dedicatory inscription and below them in very low relief is bird, of a raven. This sculpture was dated by Reinach,&lt;ref&gt;Salomon Reinach (1922), ''Cultes, mythes et religions'', pp.&amp;nbsp;217–232.&lt;/ref&gt; from the form of the letters, to the end of the first century or start of the second century.

An altar from [[Metz]] has a carving of a woman with similar dress to the Sarrebourg example, also holding a small house on a pole, thus presumed to be Nantosuelta. Sucellus is not shown on this example.

She was associated with the [[cornucopia]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

== Inscriptions ==
The inscription on the Sarrebourg altar&lt;ref&gt;Jufer &amp; Luginbühl p.&amp;nbsp;129. {{CIL|13|4542}}&lt;/ref&gt; reads:
:''Deo Svcello /''
:''Nantosvelte /''
:''Bellavsvs Mas /''
:''se filivs v(otum) s(olvit) l(ibens) m(erito)''
:"To the god Sucellus and to Nantosuelta, Bellausus, son of Massa, willingly and deservedly fulfilled his vow."

The inscription on the Metz altar&lt;ref&gt;Epigraphik-Datenbank Clauss / Slab{{AE|1896|0049}}&lt;/ref&gt; says:
:''In h(onorem) {r} d(omus) d(ivinae) / ''
:''M(arcus) Tignuarius / ''
:''v(otum) s(olvit) l(ibens) m(erito)''
:"In honour of the divine house, Marcus Tignuarius willingly and deservedly fulfilled his vow."

Here the dedication is to the Imperial house, and Nantosuelta is not explicitly mentioned. The visual depiction makes the identification secure.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48943">The '''nationalization of oil supplies''' refers to the process of confiscation of [[petroleum|oil]] production operations and private property, generally in the purpose of obtaining more revenue from oil for oil-producing countries' governments.  This process, which should not be confused with restrictions on crude oil exports, represents a significant turning point in the development of oil policy. [[Nationalization]] eliminates private business operations—in which private international companies control oil resources within oil-producing countries—and allows oil-producing countries to gain control of private property.  Once these countries become the sole owners of these confiscated resources in violation of contract law, they have to decide how to maximize the [[net present value]] of their known stock of oil in the ground.&lt;ref name=OEaP&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ayoub |first1=Antoine |year=1994 |title=Oil: Economics and Political |journal=Energy Studies Review |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=47–60 |publisher=DigitalCommons@McMaster |url=http://digitalcommons.mcmaster.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1123&amp;context=esr |accessdate=2010-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Several key implications can be observed as a result of oil nationalization. "On the home front, national oil companies are often torn between national expectations that they should 'carry the flag' and their own ambitions for commercial success, which might mean a degree of emancipation from the confines of a national agenda."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

According to consulting firm [[PFC Energy]], only 7% of the world's estimated oil and gas reserves are in countries that allow private international companies free rein. Fully 65% are in the hands of state-owned companies such as [[Saudi Aramco]], with the rest in countries such as [[Russia]] and [[Venezuela]], where access by Western companies is difficult. The PFC study implies political groups unfavorable to capitalism in some countries tend to limit oil production increases in [[Mexico]], [[Venezuela]], [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Kuwait]] and Russia. [[Saudi Arabia]] is also limiting capacity expansion, but because of a self-imposed cap, unlike the other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==History==

This nationalization (reclamation) of previously privately owned oil supplies where it has occurred, has been a gradual process.  Before the discovery of oil, some Middle Eastern countries such as [[Iraq]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and [[Kuwait]] were all poor and underdeveloped.  They were desert kingdoms that had few natural resources and were without adequate financial resources to maintain the state.  Poor peasants made up a majority of the population.&lt;ref name=THaSCoaNOI&gt;{{cite news

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When oil was discovered in these developing nations during the early twentieth century, the countries did not have enough knowledge of the oil industry to make use of the newly discovered natural resources.  The countries were therefore not able to mine or market their petroleum.&lt;ref name=THaSCoaNOI/&gt; 

Major oil companies saw this as an opportunity for profit and they negotiated concession agreements with the developing countries; the companies were given exclusive rights to explore and develop the production of oil within the country.  The concession agreements made between the oil-producing country and the oil company specified a limited area the company could utilize, lasted a limited amount of time, and required the company to take all the financial and commercial risks as well as pay the host governments surface taxes, [[royalties]], and production taxes.  Despite all of this, however, the companies were able to claim any of the oil they mined.&lt;ref name=THaSCoaNOI/&gt;  As a result, the world’s oil was largely in the hands of seven corporations based in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]], often called the [[Seven Sisters (oil companies)|Seven Sisters]].&lt;ref name=WOIIA&gt;{{cite news

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Five of the companies were American ([[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]], [[Exxon]], [[Gulf Oil|Gulf]], [[Mobil]], and [[Texaco]]), one was British ([[British Petroleum]]), and one was Anglo-Dutch ([[Royal Dutch/Shell]]).&lt;ref name=THaSCoaNOI/&gt;  These companies have since merged into four: Shell, [[ExxonMobil]], [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]], and [[BP]].&lt;ref name=WOIIA/&gt;  

The established contracts between oil companies and nations with oil reserves gave the oil companies an advantageous position, leading to the inclusion of choice-of-law clauses.  In other words, disputes over contract details would be settled by a third party instead of the host country.  The only way for host countries to alter their contracts was through nationalization.  Most of the countries, with the exception of Venezuela, even signed away their right to tax the companies in exchange for one-time [[royalty payments]].&lt;ref name=THaSCoaNOI/&gt;

Although undeveloped nations originally welcomed concession agreements, some nationalists began to argue that the oil companies were exploiting them.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}  Led by Venezuela, oil-producing countries realized that they could control the price of oil by limiting the supply.  The countries joined together as [[OPEC]] and gradually governments took control of oil supplies.&lt;ref name=THaSCoaNOI/&gt;

Before the 1970s there were only two major incidents of successful oil nationalization—the first following the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] of 1917 in Russia and the second in 1938 in Mexico.&lt;ref name=ANPEoO&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Morse |first1=Edward |year=1999 |title=A New Political Economy of Oil? |journal=Journal of International Affairs |volume=53 |issue=1 |publisher=The Trustees of Columbia University |url=https://woc.uc.pt/feuc/course/MRI/2007-2008/Morse%20-%20A%20new%20political%20economy%20of%20oil.pdf |accessdate=2010-11-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727134314/https://woc.uc.pt/feuc/course/MRI/2007-2008/Morse%20-%20A%20new%20political%20economy%20of%20oil.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to the swift growth of the energy economy, natural resource industries shifted to becoming nationalized to protect themselves from adjustments in demand worldwide.

===Pre-nationalization===
Due to the presence of oil, the Middle East has been the center of international tension even before the nationalization of oil supplies.  [[United Kingdom|Britain]] was the first country that took interest in Middle Eastern oil.  In 1908, oil was discovered in [[Persia]] by the Anglo-Persian oil company under the [[stimulus (economic)|stimulus]] of the British government.  Britain maintained strategic and military domination of areas of the Middle East outside Turkish control until after [[World War I]] when the former [[Turkish Empire]] was divided between the British and the French.  It turned out that many of the areas controlled by the French had little oil potential.&lt;ref name=TSoO&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Odell |first1=Peter R. |year=1968 |title=The Significance of Oil |journal=[[Journal of Contemporary History]] |volume=3 |issue=3, The Middle East |pages=93–110 |publisher=[[Sage Publications]] |jstor=259700 |doi=10.1177/002200946800300306 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, Britain continued to expand oil interests into other parts of the [[Persian Gulf]].  Although oil resources were found in Kuwait, there was not enough demand for oil at the time to develop in this area.&lt;ref name=TSoO/&gt;

Due to political and commercial pressure, it did not take long before the [[United States]] secured an entry into Middle Eastern oil supplies.  The British government was forced to allow the US into [[Iraq]] and the [[Persian Gulf]] states.  Iraq became dominated by US oil companies while [[Kuwait]] consisted of a 50/50 split between British and American companies.&lt;ref name=TSoO/&gt;

Up until 1939, Middle Eastern oil remained relatively unimportant in world markets.  According to “The Significance of Oil,” the Middle East at the time &lt;blockquote&gt;“was contributing only 5 percent of total world oil production and its exports were limited to countries within the immediate region and, via the Suez Canal, in western Europe.”&lt;ref name=TSoO/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The real significance of pre-1939 developments in the Middle East is that they established the framework for the post-1945 oil expansion.&lt;ref name=TSoO/&gt;

After WWII, the demand for oil increased significantly.  Due to war-time oil development, which proved the great potential for oil discovery in the Middle East, there was little hesitation in investing capital in [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Kuwait]], and [[Saudi Arabia]].&lt;ref name=TSoO/&gt;

Huge investments were made to improve the infrastructure needed to transport Middle Eastern oil.  For example, investment was made on the [[Suez Canal]] to ensure that larger [[Tanker (ship)|tankers]] could utilize it.  There was also an increased construction of [[oil pipelines]].  The expansion of infrastructure to produce and transport Middle East oil was mainly under the operation of the seven major international oil companies.&lt;ref name=TSoO/&gt;

===Early nationalizations===

Prior to 1970, there were ten countries that nationalized oil production: the Soviet Union in 1918, Bolivia in 1937 and 1969, Mexico in 1938, Iran in 1951, Iraq in 1961, Burma and Egypt in 1962, Argentina in 1963, Indonesia in 1963, and Peru in 1968.  Although these countries were nationalized by 1971, all of the “important” industries that existed in developing countries were still held by foreign [[firms]].  In addition, only Mexico and Iran were significant exporters at the time of nationalization.&lt;ref name=DaaEoON&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kobrin |first1=Stephen J. |year=1985 |title=Diffusion as an Explanation of Oil Nationalization: Or the Domino Effect Rides Again |journal=[[Journal of Conflict Resolution]] |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=3–32 |publisher=[[Sage Publications]] |url=http://jcr.sagepub.com/content/29/1/3.full.pdf+html |accessdate=2010-12-20 |doi=10.1177/0022002785029001001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government of [[Brazil]], under [[Getúlio Vargas]], nationalized the oil industry in 1953, thereby creating [[Petrobras]].

==Reasons for nationalization==
===Exploitation===
Proponents of nationalization asserted that the original contracts held between an oil-producing country and an oil company were unfair to the producing country. Yet without the knowledge and skill brought into the country by the international oil companies, the countries would not have been able to even get the oil. Contracts, which could not be altered or ended in advance of the true end date, covered huge expanses of land and lasted for long durations.  [[Nationalist]] ideas began once producing countries realized that the oil companies were exploiting them.&lt;ref name=THaSCoaNOI/&gt;  Many times these countries did not even pay the companies for their loss of assets or only paid nominal amounts. 

The first country to act was Venezuela, which had the most favorable concession agreement.  In 1943, the country increased the total [[royalties]] and tax paid by the companies to 50% of their total [[Profit (accounting)|profits]].  However, true equal [[profit sharing]] was not accomplished until 1948.  Because oil companies were able to deduct the tax from their [[income tax]], profits acquired by the oil companies did not change significantly and, as a result, the oil companies did not have any major problems with the change imposed by Venezuela.  Even with increased oil prices, the companies still held a dominant position over Venezuela.&lt;ref name=THaSCoaNOI/&gt;

===Change in oil prices===
The posted price of oil was originally the determinant factor of the taxes that oil companies had to pay.  This concept was beneficial to the oil companies because they were the ones who controlled the posted prices.  Companies could increase the actual price of oil without changing the posted price, thus avoiding an increase in taxes paid to the producing country.&lt;ref name=THaSCoaNOI/&gt;
Oil-producing countries did not realize that the companies were adjusting oil prices until the cost of oil dropped in the late 1950s and companies started reducing posted prices very frequently.&lt;ref name=THaSCoaNOI/&gt;  The main reason for the reduction in oil prices was the change in the world’s energy situation after 1957 that led to competition between energy sources.  Efforts to find markets led to price cuts.  Price cutting was first achieved by shaving [[profit margins]], but soon prices were reduced to levels far lower than posted prices as companies producing oil in the Middle East started to offer crude to independent and state-owned refineries.&lt;ref name=TSoO/&gt; 

Producing countries became aggravated when the companies would reduce the prices without warning.  According to “The Significance of Oil,” &lt;blockquote&gt;“small reductions in posted prices in 1958 and 1959 produced some indications of disapproval from certain Middle East governments, but it was not until major cuts—of the order of 10 to 15 percent—were announced in 1960 that a storm broke over the heads of the companies whose decisions would reduce the oil revenues of the countries by 5 to 7 ½ percent.”&lt;ref name=TSoO/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

High oil prices, on the other hand, raise the [[bargaining power]] of oil-producing countries.  As a result, some say that countries are more likely to nationalize their oil supplies during times of high oil prices.  However, nationalization can come with various costs and it is often questioned why a government would respond to an oil price increase with nationalization rather than by imposing higher taxes.  [[Contract theory]] provides reasoning against nationalization.&lt;ref name=DoNitOS&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Guriev |first1=Sergei |last2=Kolotilin |first2=Anton |last3=Sonin |first3=Konstantin |year=2009 |title=Determinants of Nationalization in the Oil Sector: A Theory and Evidence from Panel Dat |journal=Journal of Law, Economics, and Organization |pages=1–23 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |url=http://jleo.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2009/06/23/jleo.ewp011.full.pdf+html |accessdate=2010-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structural change of oil-producing countries===
The Third World went through dramatic structural change in the decades after oil was first discovered.  Rising [[nationalism]] and the emergence of shared group [[consciousness]] among developing countries accompanied the end of the formal colonial relationships in the 1950s and 1960s.  Shared group consciousness among the oil-exporting countries was expressed through the formation of OPEC, increased contact and communication between countries, and attempts of common action among countries during the 1960s.  The structure of the industry, which led to increased nationalistic mentality, was affected by the following important changes:&lt;ref name=DaaEoON/&gt;

====Strategic control====
Originally, oil-producing countries were poor and needed oil companies to help them produce the oil and manage the [[oil reserves]] located within the country.  However, as the countries began to develop, their demands for [[revenue]] increased.  The industry became integrated into a [[local economy]] that required strategic control by the host country over pricing and the rate of production.  Gradually, foreign investors lost the trust of oil-producing countries to develop resources in the national interest.  Oil-producing countries demanded participation in the control of the oil within their country.&lt;ref name=DaaEoON/&gt;

====Increased capabilities====
Furthermore, technological innovation and managerial expertise increased dramatically after [[World War II]], which increased the [[bargaining power]] of producing countries.  Increased bargaining power allowed the companies to change their mode of operation.&lt;ref name=DaaEoON/&gt;

====Expansion of the oil industry====
Stephen J. Kobrin states that &lt;blockquote&gt;“During the interwar period and through the 1950s, international petroleum was a very tight [[oligopoly]] dominated by [[Seven Sisters (oil companies)|seven major international oil companies]] ([[Exxon]], Shell, [[BP]], [[Gulf Oil|Gulf]], [[Texaco]], [[Mobil]] and [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]]—as they are known today).  However, between 1953 and 1972 more than three hundred private firms and fifty state-owned firms entered the industry, drawn by the explosion in oil consumption and substantially diminished barriers to entry.”&lt;ref name=DaaEoON/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The new, independent companies disturbed the equilibrium between the major companies and the producing countries.  Countries became aware of their options as these companies offered better agreement terms.&lt;ref name=DaaEoON/&gt;

====Changes in supply and demand====
The shortage of oil in the 1970s increased the value of oil from previous decades.  The bargaining power of producing countries increased as both the country governments and the oil companies became increasingly concerned about the continued access to crude oil.&lt;ref name=DaaEoON/&gt;

===Diffusion of ideas between oil-producing countries===
Rogers defines diffusion as, “the process by which (1) an [[innovation]] (2) is communicated through certain channels (3) over time (4) among members of a social system.”&lt;ref name=DaaEoON/&gt;  Innovations may consist of [[technology]], [[philosophy]], or [[managerial]] techniques.  Examples of communication channels include the [[mass media]], organizations such as [[OPEC]] or the [[U.N.]], or [[educational institutions]].  Due to diffusion, attempts at oil nationalization from producing countries, and whether or not these attempts were successful, affected decisions to nationalize oil supplies.&lt;ref name=DaaEoON/&gt;

Two attempts of nationalization that had clear inhibiting effects on other producing countries were the nationalizations of Mexico in 1938 and of Iran in 1951, which occurred prior to the important structural change in the oil industry.  The Mexican nationalization proved that although it was possible to accomplish nationalization, it came at the cost of [[Isolationism|isolation]] from the international industry, which was dominated by the major companies at the time.  The Iranian nationalization also failed due to the lack of [[cooperation]] with international oil companies.  These two incidences proved to other oil-producing countries that, until the structure of the oil industry changed to rely less upon international oil companies, any attempts to nationalize would be a great risk and would likely be unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=DaaEoON/&gt; 

Once the oil industry structure changed, oil-producing countries were more likely to succeed in nationalizing their oil supplies.  The development of [[OPEC]] provided the medium in which producing countries could communicate and diffusion could occur rapidly.&lt;ref name=DaaEoON/&gt; 

The first country to successfully nationalize after the structural change of the industry was [[Algeria]], which nationalized 51% of the [[France|French]] companies only ten days after the [[1971 world oil market chronology|1971 Tehran agreement]] and later was able to nationalize 100% of their companies.  The nationalization of Algerian oil influenced Libya to nationalize British Petroleum in 1971 and the rest of its foreign companies by 1974.  A [[ripple effect]] quickly occurred, spreading first to the more-[[militant (word)|militant]] oil producers like [[Iraq]] and then followed by more-conservative oil producers like Saudi Arabia.  Stephen J. Kobrin states that &lt;blockquote&gt;“By 1976 virtually every other major producer in the mid-East, Africa, Asia, and Latin America had followed nationalizing at least some of its producers to gain either a share of participation or to take over the entire industry and employ the international companies on a contractual basis.”&lt;ref name=DaaEoON/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Implications of nationalization==
===Vertical integration of the oil industry was broken===
Due to the overall instability of supply, oil became an instrument of foreign policy for oil-exporting countries.&lt;ref name=ANPEoO/&gt; Nationalization increased the stability in the oil markets and broke the [[vertical integration]] within the system. Vertical integration was replaced with a dual system where OPEC countries controlled upstream activities such as the production and marketing of crude oil while oil companies controlled downstream activities such as transportation, refining, distribution, and sale of oil products.&lt;ref name=OEaP/&gt; 

Under the new dual structure, [[OPEC]] was neither vertically or horizontally integrated and was not able to take over the entire oil sector from the oil companies.  The temporary fear of an oil shortage during the 1970s helped to hide this consequence.  In addition, relations between producing countries of the [[Persian Gulf]] and previous concessionary companies induced an “artificial” vertical integration.  These relations included long-term contracts, discount of official prices, and phase-out clauses.  Free markets started to become prevalent in 1981 after the trade in oil switched from being a sellers’ to a buyers’ market.&lt;ref name=OEaP/&gt;

===Oil companies lost access to oil supplies===
According to the ''Energy Studies Review'', &lt;blockquote&gt;"between 1973 and 1982, companies lost around 50% of their share of the crude oil market, from 30 million barrels per day (MMbbl/d) to around 15.2 MMbbl/d, while 'free world' demand decreased only 15% over the same time period.  Even more significant, in 1982 the major (oil companies) could rely on 6.7 MMbbl/d of production from the reserves under their control, while the corresponding number in 1973 was 25.5 MMbbl/d—a decrease of 74% in less than 10 years."&lt;ref name=OEaP/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  As a result, important oil companies became important net buyers of crude oil after a long time of being vertically integrated sellers to their own refineries.&lt;ref name=OEaP/&gt;

===Change in the horizontal integration of the oil industry===
The increase in oil prices of the 70s attracted non-OPEC producers—Norway, Mexico, Great Britain, Egypt, and some African and Asian countries—to explore within their country.  In 1965, the [[Herfindahl index]] of [[horizontal integration]] for the crude oil production industry was 1600 and the horizontal integration for the exploration industry was 1250.  By 1986, it decreased to around 930 for the crude oil production industry and 600 for the exploration industry.  This created a further destabilizing factor for OPEC.&lt;ref name=OEaP/&gt;

===Restructuring of the refining sector===
The world refining capacity of the major oil companies in 1973 was {{convert|23.2|Moilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}}.  However, by 1982, their world refining capacity had decreased to {{convert|14|Moilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}}.  This decrease was a result of their decreased access to the oil reserves of OPEC countries and, subsequently, the [[Rationalization (economics)|rationalization]] of their world refining and distribution network to decrease their dependence on OPEC countries.  The increase in the refining capacity of OPEC countries that wanted to sell not only crude oil but also refined products further reinforced this trend towards rationalization.&lt;ref name=OEaP/&gt;

===Change in the spot market===
The nationalization of oil supplies and the emergence of the OPEC market caused the [[spot market]] to change in both orientation and size.  The spot market changed in orientation because it started to deal not only with crude oil but also with refined products.  The spot market changed in size because as the OPEC market declined the number of spot market transactions increased.&lt;ref name=OEaP/&gt;    
The development of the spot market made oil prices volatile.  The risks involving oil investment increased.  To protect against these potential risks, parallel markets such as the [[forward market]] developed.  As these new markets developed, price control became more difficult for OPEC.  In addition, oil was transformed from a [[strategic]] product to a [[commodity]].&lt;ref name=OEaP/&gt;    
Changes in the spot market favored [[competition]] and made it more difficult for [[oligopolistic]] agreements.  The development of many free markets impacted OPEC in two different ways:
# A destabilizing effect occurred that made it easier for OPEC members not to respect their own quota if they did not want to.&lt;ref name=OEaP/&gt;
# A stabilizing effect occurred that provided an incentive for cooperation among OPEC members.  Decreased prices due to free markets made it more profitable for OPEC countries to work together rather than to seek profit individually.&lt;ref name=OEaP/&gt;

==OPEC countries==
===Ecuador===
[[Ecuador]] has had one of the most volatile oil policies in the region, partly a reflection of the high political volatility in the country.&lt;ref name=LACEA/&gt; [[Petroecuador]] accounts for over half of oil production, however, as a result of financial setbacks combined with a drop in oil price, private companies increased oil investments in Ecuador.  In the early 1990s annual foreign investment in oil was below US$ 200 million, by the early 2000s it had surpassed US $1 billion (Campodónico, 2004).&lt;ref name=LACEA/&gt; Changes in political power led to an increase in government control over [[oil extraction]]. In particular, the election of President [[Rafael Correa]], on a resource-nationalism platform, prompted increases in government control and the approval of a [[windfall profits tax]].&lt;ref name=LACEA/&gt;

===Iran===
{{main|The nationalization of the Iran oil industry movement}}
Since its beginning, Iran's oil industry has experienced expansion and contraction.  Rapid growth at the time of [[World War I]] declined soon after the start of [[World War II]]. Recovery began in 1943 with the reopening of supply routes to the [[United Kingdom]]. The oil was produced by what became the [[Anglo-Iranian Oil Company]], but political difficulties arose with the Iranian government in the [[postwar period]].&lt;ref name=IRAN&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Riva |first1=Jonathon P. |year=1995 |title=World Oil Production After Year 2000: Business AS Usual or Crisis? |journal=CRS Report for Congress |url=http://www.localenergy.org/pdfs/Document%20Library/Riva%20World%20Oil%20Production%20after%202000.pdf |accessdate=2010-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iran sought to rid itself of British political influence and the exploitation by AIOC. Negotiations between Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and the government failed and in 1951 the oil industry was nationalized. As a result of Britain's boycott and the [[Abadan Crisis]], Iranian production dropped to virtually zero. On British initiative the [[CIA]]
overthrew [[Prime Minister of Iran]] [[Mohammad Mosaddegh|Mosaddegh]] in [[1953 Iranian coup d'état|Operation Ajax]]. Formally the nationalization remained effective, but in practice a consortium of oil companies was allowed in under a by then standard 50/50 profit-sharing deal.

The whole process had left the British a major share in what had been their single most valuable foreign asset. It had stopped the democratic transition in Iran however, leaving its mark for decades to come. The coup is widely believed to have significantly contributed to the 1979 [[Iranian Revolution]] after which the oil industry would be nationalized again.
&lt;!-- Iraq, Kuwait --&gt;

Under these circumstances, NOCs often came forward as alternative suppliers of oil.&lt;ref name=IRAQ/&gt; Nationalization of the Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC) in 1972 after years of rancor, together with restrictions on oil liftings by all but one of the IPC's former partners, put Iraq at the forefront of direct marketing.&lt;ref name=IRAQ/&gt; Iraq's oil production suffered major damage in the aftermath of the [[Gulf War]].

===Libya===
Libya, in particular, sought out independent oil firms to develop its oilfields; in 1970, the Libyan government used its leverage to restructure radically the terms of its agreements with these independent companies, precipitating a rash of contract renegotiations throughout the oil-exporting world.&lt;ref name=IRAQ/&gt;

===Nigeria===
The discovery of oil in [[Nigeria]] caused conflict within the state.  The emergence of commercial oil production from the region in 1958 and thereafter raised the stakes and generated a struggle by the indigenes for control of the oil resources.&lt;ref name=ORND&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ikelegbe |first1=Augustine |year=2005 |title=The Economy of Conflict in the Oil Rich Niger Delta Region of Nigeria |journal=Nordic Journal of African Studies |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=208–234 |url=http://www.sweetcrudemovie.com/pdf/njas2005.pdf |accessdate=2010-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The northern [[hegemony]], ruled by Hausa and Fulani, took a military [[dictatorship]] and seized control of oil production. To meet popular demands for cheaper food during the [[inflationary]] period just after the [[civil war]], government created a new state corporation, the National Nigerian Supply Company (NNSC).&lt;ref name=NIGERIA&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wilson III |first1=Ernest J. |year=1990 |title=Strategies of State Control of the Economy: Nationalization and Indigenization in Africa |journal=Comparative Politics |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=401–419 |publisher=Ph.D. Program in Political Science of the City University of New York |jstor=421971}}&lt;/ref&gt; While oil production proceeded, the region by the 1990s was one of the least developed and most poor.&lt;ref name=ORND/&gt;  The local communities responded with [[protests]] and successful efforts to stop oil production in the area if they did not receive any benefit.  By September 1999, about 50 Shell workers had been kidnapped and released.&lt;ref name=ORND/&gt;  Not only are the people of Nigeria affected, but the environment in the area is also affected by [[deforestation]] and improper [[waste treatment]]. Nigerian oil production also faces problems with illegal trade of the refined product on the [[black market]]. This is undertaken by authorized marketers in collusion with smuggling [[syndicates]].&lt;ref name=ORND/&gt;
Activities such as these severely affect the oil industries of both the state and [[MNCs]]. Oil production deferments arising from community disturbances and sabotage was 45mm barrels in 2000 and 35mm barrels in 2001.&lt;ref name=ORND/&gt; The state has not been a very effective means of controlling incursions such as these. The illegal oil economy in such a circumstance may continue to exist for a long time, albeit in
curtailed and small scales.&lt;ref name=ORND/&gt;

===Saudi Arabia===
By 1950, Saudi Arabia had become a very successful producing area, with an even greater undeveloped oil production potential. Because of favorable [[geological]] conditions and the close proximity of oil fields to the coast, Saudi Arabia operations were low cost.  American companies therefore heavily valued the oil.  The joint concessionary company, [[ARAMCO]], agreed to the government’s demand to use the introduced posted price as a way to calculate profits.  Profit-sharing between ARAMCO and Saudi Arabia was established as a 50/50 split.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saudiaramco.com/en/home.html |title=Saudi Aramco |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=saudiaramco.com |publisher=[[Saudi Aramco]] |access-date=August 24, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;Eventually the Saudi Government fully purchased Aramco in 1980 renaming it as Saudi Aramco.&lt;ref name=TSoO/&gt;

===Venezuela===
In 1958 a revolution in Venezuela brought an end to their [[military dictatorship]].&lt;ref name=THaSCoaNOI/&gt; The newly elected Minister of Mines and Hydrocarbons, [[Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonso]], acted to raise the [[income tax]] on oil companies and introduced the key aspect of [[supply and demand]] to the oil trade. Nationalization of oil supplies was achieved in 1976. Major oil companies operating in [[Venezuela]] have had difficulty with the spreading resource nationalism. After decades of high investment, in the 1960s and 1970s oil taxation of the IOCs (international oil companies) was significantly increased and oil concessions were not renewed.&lt;ref name=LACEA/&gt; [[Exxon Mobil]] and [[ConocoPhilips]] have said they would walk away from their large investment in the [[Orinoco]] heavy-oil belt rather than accept tough new contract terms that raise [[tax]]es and oblige all foreign companies to accept minority shares in joint ventures with the state oil company, [[Petróleos de Venezuela]] (PDVSA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In the late 1990s, private investment substantially increased, adding 1.2 million BD of production by 2005.&lt;ref name=LACEA/&gt; While private investors were producing more oil and PDSVA decreased oil production, Venezuela still managed to increase its oil fiscal take for each barrel. Continued shortcomings for PDSVA spurred an effort to eliminate the company, leading to a strike that severely reduced investment and production.  This gave to government opportunity to seize control and, as a result, in the last two years the contractual framework of the oil opening has been significantly changed, considerably increasing the government-take and control over private investments.&lt;ref name=LACEA&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Manzano |first1=Osmel |last2=Monaldi |first2=Francisco |date=Fall 2008 |title=The Political Economy of Oil Production in Latin America |journal=Economia |publisher=LACEA |url=http://servicios.iesa.edu.ve/Portal/CIEA/latinamerica_oilproduction_manzanomonaldi_%20lacea.pdf |accessdate=2010-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-OPEC countries==
===Argentina===
Nationalization of oil resources in [[Argentina]] began in 1907, when upon the discovery of the nation's first sizable oil field near [[Comodoro Rivadavia]], President [[José Figueroa Alcorta]] declared the area around the oil field public property. [[YPF]], the first oil company in the world established as a [[state enterprise]], was established by President [[Hipólito Yrigoyen]] and General [[Enrique Mosconi]] in 1922. The nation's mineral resources were nationalized ''in toto'' with Article 40 of the [[Argentine Constitution of 1949]] promulgated by President [[Juan Perón]]. The latter was abrogated in 1956, but oil and [[natural gas]] were renationalized in 1958 during President [[Arturo Frondizi]]'s self-described "[[oil battle]]" for [[import substitution industrialization|self-sufficiency]] in the staple, and private firms operated afterward via leases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oil and Nationalism in Argentina|author=Solberg, Carl|publisher=Stanford University Press|ISBN=0804709858|date=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; YPF was privatized in 1993, and [[Madrid]]-based [[Repsol]] acquired a majority stake in 1999. Oil and gas production subsequently weakened while demand increased, and in 2011 Argentina recorded the first energy trade deficit since 1987.&lt;ref name=info&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infonews.com/2012/04/16/politica-18075-cristina-presento-un-proyecto-para-la-expropiacion-de-las-acciones-de-ypf.php|title=Cristina presentó un proyecto para la "expropiación" de las acciones de YPF|work=Info News|date=16 April 2012|accessdate=20 April 2012|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, Argentina's president [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]] introduced a bill on April 16, 2012, for the [[renationalization of YPF|expropriation of YPF]], the nation's largest energy firm. The state would purchase a 51% share, with the national government controlling 51% of this package and ten provincial governments receiving the remaining 49%.&lt;ref name=yahoo&gt;{{cite news|title=Energy crisis provokes Argentine YPF expropriation|url=https://news.yahoo.com/energy-crisis-provokes-argentine-ypf-expropriation-155636784.html|accessdate=22 April 2012|newspaper=Yahoo!

Investment in exploration at YPF as a percentage of profits had been far below those in most other Repsol subsidiaries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/suplementos/cash/17-5831-2012-03-04.html|title=Cash|work=Página/12|date=4 March 2012|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; and declines in output at the firm represented 54% of the nation's lost oil production and 97% in the case of natural gas.&lt;ref name=mundo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/america/2012/04/16/argentina/1334600261.html|title=El proyecto para nacionalizar YPF|work=El Mundo|date=16 April 2012|accessdate=20 April 2012|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Market analysts and Repsol blamed the decline in exploration and production on government controls on exports and [[mineral exploration|prospecting lease]]s, as well as [[price control]]s on domestic oil and gas.&lt;ref name=deal&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedeal.com/content/energy/ypf-expropriation-endorsed-by-argentine-senate.php#ixzz1tY5a5QSr|title=YPF expropriation endorsed by Argentine Senate|work=The Deal Pipeline|date=26 April 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427020042/http://www.thedeal.com/content/energy/ypf-expropriation-endorsed-by-argentine-senate.php#ixzz1tY5a5QSr|archivedate=27 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=debate&gt;{{cite news|title=Argentine lower house starts YPF takeover debate|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/02/us-argentina-ypf-idUSBRE8411D620120502|accessdate=2 May 2012|newspaper=Reuters|date=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/americasview/2012/04/argentinas-oil-industry|accessdate=22 April 2012|title=Argentina's oil industry: Feed me, Seymour |work=[[The Economist]]|quote=Repsol says that the real cause of Argentina’s declining energy trade balance is its maze of price controls and subsidies, which makes investment unprofitable and encourages excess consumption.

The government announced instead that it would acquire a majority stake in YPF.&lt;ref name=yahoo/&gt; Argentine Economy Minister [[Hernán Lorenzino]] claimed that [[asset stripping]] at YPF had financed Repsol's expansion in other parts of the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ambito.com/noticia.asp?id=633578|title=Repsol vació YPF para su expansión en otros países|work=Ámbito Financiero|date=19 April 2012|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Repsol officials denied charges of underinvestment in its YPF operations.&lt;ref name=debate/&gt; 

Argentine Deputy Economy Minister [[Axel Kicillof]] rejected Repsol's initial demands for payment of US$10.5 billion for a controlling stake in YPF, citing debts of nearly US$9 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clarin.com/politica/Kicillof-directivos-Repsol-ocultaban-petrolera_0_683931808.html|title=Kicillof advirtió: No vamos a pagar lo que Repsol quiera|work=Clarín|date=17 April 2012|accessdate=20 April 2012|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[book value]] of YPF was US$4.4 billion at the end of 2011;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ypf.com/InversoresAccionistas/InfoEconomicoFinanciera/YPF%20Estados%20Contables/Estados%20Contables%20al%2031%20de%20Diciembre%20de%202011.pdf|title=Estados Contables al 31 de Diciembre de 2011|language=Spanish|publisher=YPF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620133744/http://www.ypf.com/InversoresAccionistas/InfoEconomicoFinanciera/YPF%20Estados%20Contables/Estados%20Contables%20al%2031%20de%20Diciembre%20de%202011.pdf|archivedate=2012-06-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; its total [[market capitalization]] on the day of the announcement was US$10.4 billion.&lt;ref name=incensed&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/17/spain-argentina-ypf-idUSL2E8FHD9420120417|title=Incensed Spain threatens Argentina after YPF seizure|publisher=Reuters|date=17 April 2012|accessdate=20 April 2012|author=Tracy Rucinski and Julien Toyer}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was overwhelmingly approved by both houses of [[Argentine Congress|Congress]], and was signed by the president on May 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Americas/2012/0512/Argentina-s-renationalization-of-YPF-A-push-to-manage-oil-on-its-own-terms|title=Argentina's renationalization of YPF: A push to manage oil on its own terms|work=Christian Science Monitor|date=May 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In 2010 Canada was the United States' leading oil supplier, exporting some {{convert|707316000|oilbbl|m3}} of oil per year ({{convert|1,937,852|oilbbl/d|m3/d}}), 99 percent of its annual oil exports, according to the EIA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the OPEC oil embargo in the early 1970s, Canada took initiative to control its oil supplies.  The result of these initiatives was [[Petro-Canada]], a state-owned oil company. Petro-Canada put forth national goals including, increased domestic ownership of the industry, development of reserves not located in the western provinces, that is to say, the promotion of the Canada Lands in the north and offshore, better information about the petroleum industry, security of supply, decrease dependence on the large multinational oil corporations, especially the Big Four, and increase revenues flowing to the federal treasury from the oil and gas sector.&lt;ref name=TNOO&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brownsey |first1=Keith |year=2007 |title=The New Order: The Post Staples Paradigm and the Canadian Upstream Oil and Gas Industry |journal=Canadian Political Science Review |volume=1 |pages=91–106 |url=http://ojs.unbc.ca/index.php/cpsr/article/viewFile/17/26 |accessdate=2010-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Petro-Canada has been met with opposition mainly from [[Alberta]], home to one of the main oil patches in Canada. After negotiating a royalty increase on oil and price increases for natural gas, Lougheed asserted Alberta’s position as the centre of Canada’s petroleum industry.&lt;ref name=TNOO/&gt; Alberta had since been the main source of oil in Canada since the 1970s.  The clashing viewpoints of resource control has resulted in conflict over the direction of Canada's oil industry, and as a result, the vast majority of Canada's oil ownership and profits continue to lay in foreign hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.financialpost.com/2012/05/10/majority-of-oil-sands-ownership-and-profits-are-foreign-says-analysis/|title=Majority of oil sands ownership and profits are foreign, says analysis|author=|date=10 May 2012|website=financialpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico===

{{main|Mexican oil expropriation}}
{{Update section|date=February 2018}}
[[Mexico]] nationalized its oil industry in 1938, and has never [[Privatization|privatized]], restricting [[foreign direct investment|foreign investment]]. Important reserve additions in the 1970s allowed a significant increase in production and exports, financed by the high oil prices.&lt;ref name=LACEA/&gt; Despite producing more oil than any other country in [[Latin America]], oil does not carry a relevant proportion of Mexico's exports. Since the giant [[Cantarell Field]] in Mexico is now in decline, the state oil company [[Pemex]] has faced intense political opposition to opening up the country's oil and gas sector to foreign participation. The lack of financial autonomy has limited Pemex’s own investment capacity, inducing the company to become highly indebted and to use an out of budget mechanism of deferred payment of projects (PIDIREGAS) to finance the expansion of production.&lt;ref name=LACEA/&gt; Some feel that the state oil company Pemex does not have the capacity to develop deep water assets by itself, but needs to do so if it is to stem the decline in the country's crude production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Since Putin assumed the Russian Presidency in January 2000, there has been what
amounts to a creeping re-nationalization of the Russian oil industry.&lt;ref name=RUSSIA&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hill |first1=Fiona |last2=Fee |first2=Florence |year=2002 |title=Fueling the Future: The Prospects for Russian Oil and Gas |journal=Demokratizatsiya |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=462–487 |url=http://www.brookings.edu/views/papers/hillf/200205_demokratizatsiya.pdf |accessdate=2012-12-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010154607/http://www.brookings.edu/views/papers/hillf/200205_demokratizatsiya.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Russia]], [[Vladimir Putin]]'s government has pressured [[Royal Dutch Shell]] to hand over control of one major project on [[Sakhalin]] Island, to the publicly traded company [[Gazprom]] in December. The founder of formerly private [[Yukos]] has also been jailed, and the company absorbed by state-owned [[Rosneft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia has taken notice of their increasing foreign oil investment improving politics with other countries, especially former states of the [[Soviet Union]].  Oil industry in Russia is one of the top producers in the world, however, the proven reserves in Russia are not as prevalent as in other areas.  Furthermore, previously accessible oil fields have been lost since the [[Cold War]]. With the collapse of the USSR, Russia has lost the rich Caspian Basin off-shore and on-shore oil fields in the Central Asian states and [[Azerbaijan]].&lt;ref name=RUSSIA/&gt;

The '''Oeschger Centre for Climate and Climate Change Research''' ('''OCCR'''), is the interdisciplinary centre of excellence for climate research of the [[University of Bern]].

== History ==
[[File:icecore 4x.jpg|frame|right|Ice core sample taken from drill. Photo by [[Lonnie Thompson]], [[Byrd Polar Research Center]]]]

The centre was established in 2007 and was named after [[Hans Oeschger]] (1927-1998), a pioneer of modern [[climate research]], who worked in [[Bern]]. The OCCR brings together researchers from nine institutes and four faculties. It has more than 200 members working in 26 research groups. The OCCR is at the forefront of international research in a number of different fields. Researchers from the University of Bern have participated as co-chair, coordinating lead authors or lead authors in all the assessment reports so far published by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/publications_and_data_reports.shtml#1 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Assessment Reports]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of them are still working today at the OCCR. In addition to research within disciplines, the OCCR puts special emphasis on interdisciplinary projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oeschger.unibe.ch/intranet/documentation/oeschger_broch_en.pdf Oeschger Centre Booklet]&lt;/ref&gt; Regionally rooted and globally linked, the OCCR hopes to find ways to meet the challenge of [[global climate change]] at many different levels through the collaboration of experts in the natural, human and social sciences, in economics and law. The OCCR is active not only in research; it is also involved in teaching and runs the Graduate School of Climate Sciences.

== Overview ==

=== Research ===
The Oeschger Centre (OCCR) conducts research on the one hand into the long-term development and dynamics of the climate system and the climate of the present and the future. On the other hand, it investigates the impact of climate change on important land ecosystems as well as on the economy and society. In particular it works on strategies to adapt to the changing climate and to slow down climate change. At the centre of the OCCR's research is the climate system and its interaction with society and the economy.

Specific areas of research include:
* the climate system with its different interactive components in the oceans, continents (especially vegetation, the [[cryosphere]], aquatic systems, etc.) and in the atmosphere
* energy and material cycles (e.g. water, carbon and greenhouse gases) from the global to the local level.
* the dynamics of the climate and environment over long periods of time ([[palaeoclimatology]], [[palaeoecology]]) from the late [[Pleistocene]], [[Holocene]] and the present day to the near future
* the interaction of changes in the climate and environment with the economy and society, in particular the economics of climate change and the consequences of extreme events on the economy and society

The Oeschger Centre uses models of varying kinds and complexity, and also takes measurements and carries out reconstructions of important climate variables (e.g. natural and man-made radiative forcing).

=== Teaching ===
The Oeschger Centre runs the University of Bern's Graduate School of Climate Sciences &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.climatestudies.unibe.ch/ Graduate School of Climate Sciences Webpage]&lt;/ref&gt; and offers academic training to MSc and PhD level. For the specialist "MSc in Climate Sciences" &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.climatestudies.unibe.ch/msc_programme/documents/index_en.html Documents and Guidelines «MSc in Climate Sciences»] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121220011009/http://www.climatestudies.unibe.ch/msc_programme/documents/index_en.html |date=2012-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (120 ECTS), applicants have to pass through a selection process. Students put together their own curriculum by selecting courses from a range of topics offered by several different faculties. The selection can lead to any one of five specialisations. The OCCR's main areas of research are reflected in the curriculum of the courses offered by the Graduate School of Climate Sciences.

The Oeschger Centre has a decidedly international outlook in its teaching, and works closely with the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zürich. More than a third of its students come from abroad, and all teaching is conducted in English. The PhD programme is strongly research-orientated, and lasts for three to four years. Students with a degree from the Graduate School of Climate Sciences may take up academic careers, work in the private sector – for example in banks or in insurance – or in the environmental sector for the government or with non-governmental organisations.

== Structure ==

=== Organisation ===
The Oeschger Centre for Climate Research (OCCR) is an interdisciplinary centre at the University of Bern, made up of research groups from the participating institutes. Administratively it is part of the Faculty of Science. The OCCR received its mandate from the university's governing body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oeschger.unibe.ch/intranet/documents/LA20080129.pdf University of Bern, mandate of the governing body (German Only)]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The president, director and a scientific committee made up of representatives of the participating faculties and institutes are responsible for the strategic management of the OCCR. The OCCR is run by a management centre which encourages collaboration between the research groups,  provides services for the researchers and publicises the work of the OCCR.

'''Panaji''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ʌ|n|ə|dʒ|i}} also known as '''Panjim''', ({{lang-pt|Pangim}}) is the capital of the [[India]]n state of [[Goa]] and the headquarters of [[North Goa]] district. It lies on the banks of the [[Mandovi River]] [[estuary]] in the [[Tiswadi|Ilhas de Goa]] sub-district (taluka). With a population of 114,759 in the metropolitan area, Panjim is Goa's largest [[Urban agglomeration]], ahead of [[Margao|Margão]] and [[Vasco da Gama, Goa|Vasco da Gama]].

Panjim has terraced hills, concrete buildings with balconies and red-tiled roofs, churches, and a riverside promenade. There are avenues lined with [[gulmohar]], [[acacia]] and other trees. The Baroque [[Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception Church, Goa|Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception Church]] is located overlooking the main square known as Praça da Igreja. Panjim has been selected as one of hundred Indian cities to be developed as a [[smart city]] under the [[Smart Cities Mission]].

This city of stepped streets and a seven kilometre long promenade was built on a planned [[Grid plan|grid]] system after the [[Portuguese Goa|Portuguese]] relocated the capital form [[Old Goa|Velha Goa]] in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ccpgoa.com/index.php|title=Corporation of The City of Panaji :: Official Site|website=ccpgoa.com|access-date=2018-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was elevated from a town to a city on March 22, 1843 making it the oldest civic institution in Asia (175 years).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/panaji-completes-174-years-as-states-capital-city/articleshow/57781746.cms|title=Panaji completes 174 years as state’s capital city - Times of India|work=The Times of India|access-date=2018-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The city's present official name is ''Panaji''. The [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] name was ''Pangim'', although officially named '''''Nova Goa'''''. The city is popularly also called '''''Panjim''''' (in English). It has been renamed ''Panjim'' since the 1960s after the Indian administration – in an effort to wipe out all Portuguese influence from the State.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heraldgoa.in/Edit/Opinions/Goa%E2%80%99s-silent-genocide/89034.html&lt;/ref&gt; The city is called ''Ponnjé'' in Konkani.

Earlier a small village on the river front, in 1843 the city had been renamed ''Nova Goa'' (Portuguese for "New Goa") when it officially replaced the city of Goa (now [[Old Goa]]) as the capital of [[Portuguese India]], though the Viceroy had already moved there in 1759.

The justification of the modern word ''Panaji'' is derived from the words ''panjani'' and ''khali'', which mean ''a boat'' and ''a small creek'' respectively, in [[Sanskrit]]. Thus the modern word Panjim is believed to be a corruption of the old word ''Panjanakhani'' as inscribed on the discovered Panjim copper-plates dated 1059 CE, belonging to the rule of Kadamba king Jayakesi I.&lt;ref&gt;Title: Gazetteer of the Union Territory Goa, Daman and Diu: district gazetteer, Volume 1; Publisher: Gazetteer Dept., Govt. of the Union Territory of Goa, Daman and Diu, 1979 (Original from the University of Michigan, Digitised: 30 August 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/35652/10/10_chapter%203.pdf|title=EPIGRAPHICAL AND LITERARY SOURCES ON WORSHIP IN GOA'S PAST|website=ShodhGanga}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to legend, this northern capital city was mentioned in a stone inscription of [[Kadambas of Goa|Kadamba]] king Jayakesi I dated 1054 CE as 'Panjanakhani', giving him the epithet of ''Padavalendra'' which is [[Kannada]] for  ''lord of the western ocean''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=dwYDPnEjTb4C&amp;pg=PA129&amp;lpg=PA129&amp;dq=panjanakhani&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dYPjE4F1uM&amp;sig=OrXKk3HJ8EbTEi5R99vTyt5yQ0Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjIr8yYle3LAhUFcY4KHalbCD4Q6AEIIDAA#v=snippet&amp;q=panjanakhani&amp;f=false|title=Goa Through the Ages: An economic history, Volume 2|last=De Souza|first=Teotonio R.|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|year=1990|isbn=9788170222590|pages=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some historians state that it was named after a Shia Muslim shrine also called a "Panja" on one of the coastal hill tops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=dwYDPnEjTb4C&amp;pg=PA129&amp;lpg=PA129&amp;dq=panjanakhani&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dYPjE4F1uM&amp;sig=OrXKk3HJ8EbTEi5R99vTyt5yQ0Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjIr8yYle3LAhUFcY4KHalbCD4Q6AEIIDAA#v=snippet&amp;q=panjanakhani&amp;f=false|title=Goa Through the Ages: An economic history, Volume 2|last=De Souza|first=Teotonio R.|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|year=1990|isbn=9788170222590|pages=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[geology]], '''permafrost''' is ground,&lt;ref name=Osterkamp/&gt; including [[Rock (geology)|rock]] or (cryotic) [[soil]], at or below the freezing point of water {{convert|0|C}} for two or more years. Most permafrost is located in high [[latitude]]s (in and around the [[Arctic Circle|Arctic]] and [[Antarctic Circle|Antarctic regions]]), but at lower latitudes '''alpine permafrost''' occurs at higher [[elevation]]s. Ground ice is not always present, as may be in the case of non-porous bedrock, but it frequently occurs and it may be in amounts exceeding the potential hydraulic saturation of the ground material. Permafrost accounts for 0.022% of total water on Earth&lt;ref&gt;

Permafrost is [[soil]], [[Rock (geology)|rock]] or [[sediment]] that is frozen for more than two consecutive years. In areas not overlain by ice, it exists beneath a layer of soil, rock or sediment, which freezes and thaws annually and is called the "active layer".&lt;ref name = "Definition"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, this means that permafrost occurs at an mean annual temperature of {{convert|&amp;minus;2|°C|1}} or colder. Active layer thickness varies with the season, but is 0.3 to 4 meters thick (shallow along the Arctic coast; deep in southern Siberia and the [[Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau]]).

A435&lt;/ref&gt; Most of this area is found in Siberia, northern Canada, Alaska and Greenland. Beneath the active layer annual temperature swings of permafrost become smaller with depth. The deepest depth of permafrost occurs where geothermal heat maintains a temperature above freezing. Above that bottom limit there may be permafrost, whose temperature doesn't change annually—"isothermal permafrost".&lt;ref name = "Degradation"&gt;

===Continuity of coverage===
Permafrost typically forms in any [[climate]] where the mean annual air temperature is less than the freezing point of [[water]]. Exceptions are found in moist-wintered forest climates, such as in Northern Scandinavia and the North-Eastern part of European Russia west of the [[Ural Mountains|Urals]], where snow acts as an insulating blanket. Glaciated areas may be exceptions. Since all glaciers are warmed at their base by geothermal heat, [[Glacier#Types|temperate glaciers]], which are near the [[Pressure melting point|pressure-melting]] point throughout, may have liquid water at the interface with the ground and are therefore free of underlying permafrost.&lt;ref&gt;

====Discontinuous permafrost====
Typically, the below-ground temperature varies less from season to season than the air temperature, with mean annual temperatures tending to increase with depth as a result of the geothermal crustal gradient. Thus, if the mean annual air temperature is only slightly below {{convert|0|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, permafrost will form only in spots that are sheltered—usually with a northerly [[aspect (geography)|aspect]]—creating ''discontinuous permafrost''. Usually, permafrost will remain discontinuous in a climate where the mean annual soil surface temperature is between {{convert|-5|and|0|C|F}}. In the moist-wintered areas mentioned before, there may not be even discontinuous permafrost down to {{convert|-2|°C|°F}}. Discontinuous permafrost is often further divided into ''extensive discontinuous permafrost'', where permafrost covers between 50 and 90 percent of the landscape and is usually found in areas with mean annual temperatures between {{convert|-2|and|-4|C|F}}, and ''sporadic permafrost'', where permafrost cover is less than 50 percent of the landscape and typically occurs at mean annual temperatures between {{convert|0|and|-2|C|F}}.&lt;ref name="BrownPéwé"&gt;

=== Subsea permafrost ===
Subsea permafrost occurs beneath the seabed and exists in the continental shelves of the polar regions.&lt;ref name=IPA/&gt; These areas formed during the last ice age, when a larger portion of Earth's water was bound up in ice sheets on land and when sea levels were low. As the ice sheets melted to again become seawater, the permafrost became submerged shelves under relatively warm and salty boundary conditions, compared to surface permafrost. Therefore, subsea permafrost exists in conditions that lead to its diminishment. According to Osterkamp, subsea permafrost is a factor in the "design, construction, and operation of coastal facilities, structures founded on the seabed, artificial islands, sub-sea pipelines, and wells drilled for exploration and production."&lt;ref name=Osterkamp&gt;

===Massive ground ice===
[[File:Permafrost - Massive buried ice (blue).png|thumb|Massive blue ground ice exposure on the north shore of Herschel Island, Yukon, Canada.]]

When the ice content of a permafrost exceeds 250 percent (ice to dry soil by mass) it is classified as ''massive'' ice. Massive ice bodies can range in composition, in every conceivable gradation from icy mud to pure ice. Massive icy beds have a minimum thickness of at least 2 m, a short diameter of at least 10 m.&lt;ref name = Mackay1973&gt;

Buried surface ice may derive from snow, frozen lake or sea ice, [[aufeis]] (stranded river ice) and—probably the most prevalent—buried glacial ice.&lt;ref&gt;Astakhov, 1986; Kaplanskaya and Tarnogradskiy, 1986; Astakhov and Isayeva, 1988; French, 1990; Lacelle et al., 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Intrasedimental ice forms by in-place freezing of subterranean waters and is dominated by segregational ice which results from the crystallizational differentiation taking place during the freezing of wet sediments, accompanied by water migrating to the freezing front.&lt;ref name=Shumskiy-Vtyurin1966/&gt;

Intrasedimental or constitutional ice has been widely observed and studied across Canada and also includes intrusive and injection ice.&lt;ref name=French2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shumskiy-Vtyurin1966/&gt;&lt;!----ref&gt;Shumskiy and Vtyurin, 1966; Mackay, 1971, 1973, 1989; Harry et al., 1988; French and Harry, 1990; Pollard, 1990; Mackay and Dallimore, 1992; French, 1998; Pollard, 1991; Murton et al., 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Russian investigators including I.A. Lopatin, B. Khegbomov, S. Taber and G. Beskow formulated the original theories for ice inclusions in freezing soils.&lt;ref&gt;Shumskiy and Vtyurin, 1966&lt;/ref----&gt;

Additionally, ice wedges—a separate type of ground ice—produce recognizable patterned ground or tundra polygons. Ice wedges form in a pre-existing geological substrate and were first described in 1919.&lt;ref name=French2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shumskiy-Vtyurin1966/&gt;&lt;!----ref&gt;Popov, 1962; Shumskiy and Vtyurin, 1966; Pewe, 1966b; French et al., 1982; Michel, 1990&lt;/ref----&gt;

===Carbon cycle in permafrost===
The [[permafrost carbon cycle]] (Arctic Carbon Cycle) deals with the transfer of carbon from permafrost soils to terrestrial vegetation and microbes, to the atmosphere, back to vegetation, and finally back to permafrost soils through burial and sedimentation due to cryogenic processes. Some of this carbon is transferred to the ocean and other portions of the globe through the global carbon cycle. The cycle includes the exchange of [[carbon dioxide]] and [[methane]] between terrestrial components and the atmosphere, as well as the transfer of carbon between land and water as methane, [[dissolved organic carbon]], [[dissolved inorganic carbon]], particulate inorganic carbon and particulate organic carbon.&lt;ref name=mcguire&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1890/08-2025.1 |author=McGuire, A.D., Anderson, L.G., Christensen, T.R., Dallimore, S., Guo, L., Hayes, D.J., Heimann, M., Lorenson, T.D., Macdonald, R.W., and Roulet, N. |title=Sensitivity of the carbon cycle in the Arctic to climate change |journal=Ecological Monographs |volume=79 |issue=4 |pages=523–555 |year=2009 |url=http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1890/08-2025.1|hdl=11858/00-001M-0000-000E-D87B-C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate change effects==
Arctic permafrost has been diminishing for many centuries. The consequence is thawing soil, which may be weaker, and release of methane, which contributes to an increased rate of global warming as part of a feedback loop.

===Historical changes===
[[File:Beaufort Permafrost2.JPG|thumb|right|Recently thawed Arctic permafrost and coastal erosion on the Beaufort Sea, Arctic Ocean, near [[Point Lonely Short Range Radar Site|Point Lonely, Alaska]] in 2013.]]

At the [[Last Glacial Maximum]], continuous permafrost covered a much greater area than it does today, covering all of ice-free [[Europe]] south to about [[Szeged]] (southeastern Hungary) and the [[Sea of Azov]] (then dry land)&lt;ref&gt;Sidorchuk, Aleksey, Borisova Olga and Panin; Andrey; [http://www.fluvial-systems.net/present_en/global.pdf “Fluvial response to the late Valdai/Holocene environmental change on the East European plain”]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[East Asia]] south to present-day [[Changchun]] and [[Abashiri, Hokkaidō|Abashiri]].&lt;ref&gt;Yugo Ono and Tomohisa Irino; “Southern migration of westerlies in the Northern Hemisphere PEP II transect during the Last Glacial Maximum” in ''Quaternary International'' 118–119 (2004); pp. 13–22&lt;/ref&gt; In [[North America]], only an extremely narrow belt of permafrost existed south of the [[ice sheet]] at about the latitude of [[New Jersey]] through southern [[Iowa]] and northern [[Missouri]], but permafrost was more extensive in the drier western regions where it extended to the southern border of [[Idaho]] and [[Oregon]].&lt;ref&gt;Malde, H.E.; “Patterned Ground in the Western Snake River Plain, Idaho, and Its Possible Cold-Climate Origin”; in ''Geological society of America Bulletin''; v. 75 no. 3 (March 1964); pp. 191–208&lt;/ref&gt; In the southern hemisphere, there is some evidence for former permafrost from this period in central [[Otago]] and [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[Patagonia]], but was probably discontinuous, and is related to the tundra. Alpine permafrost also occurred in the [[Drakensberg]] during glacial maxima above about {{convert|3000|m|ft|-1}}.&lt;ref&gt;Grab, Stefan; “Characteristics and palaeoenvironmental significance of relict sorted patterned ground, Drakensberg plateau, southern Africa” in ''Quaternary Science Reviews'', vol. 21, issues 14–15, (August 2002), pp. 1729–1744&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Inventory of fossil cryogenic forms and structures in Patagonia and the mountains of Argentina beyond the Andes".

The ground can consist of many substrate materials, including bedrock, sediment, organic matter, water or ice. Frozen ground is that which is below the freezing point of water, whether or not water is present in the substrate. Ground ice is not always present, as may be the case with nonporous bedrock, but it frequently occurs and may be present in amounts exceeding the potential [[phreatic zone|hydraulic saturation]] of the thawed substrate.

By definition, permafrost is ground that remains frozen for two or more years. Since frozen soil, including permafrost, comprises a large percentage of substrate materials other than ice, it thaws rather than melts even as any ice content melts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Grosse, G. |author2=Romanovsky, V. |author3=Nelson, F.E. |author4=Brown, J. |author5=Lewkowicz, A.G. |title=Why Permafrost Is Thawing, Not Melting |journal=[[Eos (journal)|Eos, Transactions, American Geophysical Union]] |volume=91 |issue=2 |pages=87 |date=March 2010 |doi=10.1029/2010EO090003 |url=http://permafrost.gi.alaska.edu/sites/default/files/Grosse%20et%20al%202010%20EOS.pdf |format=PDF |bibcode=2010EOSTr..91...87G}}&lt;/ref&gt; An analogy is when a freezer door is left open, although the ice in the freezer may change phase to a liquid, the food solids will not experience a phase change. In aggregate, the food ''thaws'' but does not ''melt''. ''Melting'' implies the phase change of all solids to liquid. One visible sign of permafrost degradation is the [[Drunken trees|random displacement of trees from their vertical orientation]] in permafrost areas.&lt;ref name=Stevens&gt;{{cite web|url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980CE6D8163DF93BA2575BC0A96E958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink|title=Dead Trees and Shriveling Glaciers as Alaska Melts|last=Stevens|first=William K.|date=1998-08-18|accessdate=2007-12-19|work=[[The New York Times]]|quote=Here and there, roadside utility poles destabilized by the melting tilt at crazy angles.

As a consequence, precipitation has increased which in turn results in the weakening and eventual collapse of buildings in areas such as Norilsk in northern Russia, which lies upon the permafrost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/oct/14/thawing-permafrost-destroying-arctic-cities-norilsk-russia|title=Slow-motion wrecks: how thawing permafrost is destroying Arctic cities|last=Luhn|first=Alec|date=2016-10-14|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect on slope stability===
Over the past century, an increasing number of alpine rock slope failure events in mountain ranges around the world have been recorded. It is expected that the high number of structural failures is due to permafrost thawing, which is thought to be linked to climate change. Permafrost thawing is thought to have contributed to the 1987 [[Val Pola landslide]] that killed 22 people in the Italian Alps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=F.|first=Dramis,|last2=M.|first2=Govi,|last3=M.|first3=Guglielmin,|last4=G.|first4=Mortara,|date=1995-01-01|title=Mountain permafrost and slope instability in the Italian Alps: The Val Pola Landslide|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/wol1/doi/10.1002/ppp.3430060108/abstract|journal=Permafrost and Periglacial Processes|language=en|volume=6|issue=1|doi=10.1002/ppp.3430060108|issn=1099-1530|pages=73–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mountain ranges, much of the structural stability can be attributed to glaciers and permafrost. As climate warms, permafrost thaws, which results in a less stable mountain structure, and ultimately more slope failures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Increasing temperatures allow deeper active layer depths, resulting in increased water infiltration. Ice within the soil melts, causing loss of soil strength, accelerated movement, and potential debris flows.

===Ecological consequences===

Formation of permafrost has significant consequences for ecological systems, primarily due to constraints imposed upon rooting zones, but also due to limitations on den and [[burrow]] geometries for [[fauna]] requiring subsurface homes. Secondary effects impact [[species]] dependent on plants and animals whose habitat is constrained by the permafrost. One of the most widespread examples is the dominance of [[Black Spruce]] in extensive permafrost areas, since this species can tolerate rooting pattern constrained to the near surface.&lt;ref&gt;C.

One gram of soil from the active layer may include more than one billion bacteria cells. If placed along each other, bacteria from one kilogram of active layer soil will form a 1000&amp;nbsp;km long chain.

===Predicted rate of change in the Arctic===
{{See also|Arctic methane release}}

According to [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report]] there is high confidence that permafrost temperatures have increased in most regions since the early 1980s. Observed warming was up to 3&amp;nbsp;°C in parts of Northern Alaska (early 1980s to mid-2000s) and up to 2&amp;nbsp;°C in parts of the Russian European North (1971–2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://templatelab.com/climatechange-WGIAR5-SPM-Approved-27Sep2013/|title=Working Group I Contribution to the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report Climate Change 2013 - Summary for Policymakers - Template Lab|date=10 November 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Yukon]], the zone of continuous permafrost might have moved {{convert|100|km}} poleward since 1899, but accurate records only go back 30 years.

Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) will in their [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report|fifth report]] establish scenarios for the future, where the temperature in the Arctic will rise between 1.5 and 2.5&amp;nbsp;°C by 2040 and with 2 to 7.5&amp;nbsp;°C by 2100. Estimates vary on how many tons of greenhouse gases are emitted from thawed permafrost soils. One estimate suggests that 110–231 billion tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalents (about half from carbon dioxide and the other half from methane) will be emitted by 2040, and 850–1400 billion tons by 2100.&lt;ref name="Schuur 2011"/&gt; This corresponds to an average annual emission rate of 4–8 billion tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalents in the period 2011–2040 and annually 10–16 billion tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalents in the period 2011–2100 as a result of thawing permafrost. For comparison, the anthropogenic emission of all greenhouse gases in 2010 is approximately 48 billion tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalents.&lt;ref&gt;UNEP 2011. Bridging the Emissions Gap.

==Other issues==
The [[International Permafrost Association]] (IPA) is an integrator of issues regarding permafrost. It convenes International Permafrost Conferences, undertakes special projects such as preparing databases, maps, bibliographies, and glossaries, and coordinates international field programmes and networks. Among other issues addressed by the IPA are: Problems for construction on permafrost owing to the change of soil properties of the ground on which structures are placed and the biological processes in permafrost, e.g. the preservation of organisms frozen ''in situ''.

===Construction on permafrost===
Building on permafrost is difficult because the heat of the building (or [[pipeline transport|pipeline]]) can thaw the permafrost and destabilize the structure. Three common solutions include: using [[foundation (architecture)|foundations]] on wood [[Deep foundation|piles]]; building on a thick [[gravel]] pad (usually 1–2 metres/3.3–6.6 feet thick); or using [[anhydrous ammonia]] [[heat pipe]]s.&lt;ref name="ASCE"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline System]] uses [[Heat pipe#Permafrost cooling|heat pipes built into vertical supports]] to prevent the pipeline from sinking and the [[Qingzang railway]] in [[Tibet]] employs a variety of methods to keep the ground cool, both in areas with [[Frost heaving#Frost-susceptible soils|frost-susceptible soil]]. Permafrost may necessitate special enclosures for buried utilities, called "[[Utility tunnel#In Arctic towns|utilidors]]".

The ''Permafrost Research Institute'' in [[Yakutsk]], found that the sinking of large buildings into the ground can be prevented by using pile foundations extending down to {{convert|15|m}} or more. At this depth the temperature does not change with the seasons, remaining at about {{convert|-5|C}}.

===Revival of organisms preserved in permafrost===
In 2012, Russian researchers proved that permafrost can serve as a natural repository for ancient life forms by reviving of ''[[Silene stenophylla]]'' from 30,000 year old tissue found in an [[Ice Age]] squirrel burrow in the [[Siberian]] permafrost. This is the oldest plant tissue ever revived. The plant was fertile, producing white flowers and viable seeds. The study demonstrated that tissue can survive ice preservation for tens of thousands of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

[[Vice-Admiral]] '''Robert FitzRoy''' [[Royal Navy|RN]], [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (5 July 1805 – 30 April 1865) was an English officer of the [[Royal Navy]] and a scientist. He achieved lasting fame as the captain of {{HMS|Beagle}} during [[Charles Darwin]]'s famous voyage, FitzRoy's second expedition to [[Tierra del Fuego]] and the [[Southern Cone]].

FitzRoy was a pioneering [[meteorology|meteorologist]] who made accurate [[weather forecasting|daily weather predictions]], which he called by a new name of his own invention: "forecasts".&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; In 1854 he established what would later be called the [[Met Office]], and created systems to get weather information to sailors and fishermen for their safety.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; He was an able surveyor and [[hydrography|hydrographer]]. As [[Governor-General of New Zealand|Governor]] of New Zealand, serving from 1843 to 1845, he tried to protect the [[Māori people|Māori]] from illegal land sales claimed by British settlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/people/robert-fitzroy|title=Robert FitzRoy biography|website=New Zealand history (NZ Govt website)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Robert FitzRoy was born at [[Ampton Hall]], [[Ampton]], Suffolk, England, into the upper echelons of the British [[aristocracy]] and a tradition of public service. Through his father, [[Lord Charles FitzRoy (British Army officer)|General Lord Charles FitzRoy]], Robert was a fourth great-grandson of [[Charles II of England]]; his paternal grandfather was [[Augustus Henry FitzRoy, 3rd Duke of Grafton]]. His mother, Lady Frances Stewart, was the daughter of the first [[Robert Stewart, 1st Marquess of Londonderry|Marquess of Londonderry]] and the half-sister of [[Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh|Viscount Castlereagh]], who became [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]]. From the age of four, Robert FitzRoy lived with his family at [[Wakefield Lodge]], their [[Palladian]] mansion in Northamptonshire.

Robert's half-brother [[Charles Augustus FitzRoy|Sir Charles FitzRoy]] later served as [[Governor of New South Wales]], [[Governor of Prince Edward Island]] and [[Governor of Antigua]].

In February 1818 at the age of 12, FitzRoy entered the [[Royal Naval Academy|Royal Naval College, Portsmouth]], and in the following year he entered the [[Royal Navy]]. At the age of 14, he embarked as a voluntary student aboard the [[frigate]] {{HMS|Owen Glendower|1808|6}}, which sailed to South America in the middle of 1820, and returned in January 1822. He was promoted to [[midshipman]] while on the vessel. FitzRoy served on {{HMS|Hind|1814|6}} as a midshipman.

He completed his course with distinction and was promoted lieutenant on 7 September 1824, having passed the examination with 'full numbers' (100%), the first to achieve this result. After serving on {{HMS|Thetis|1817|6}}, in 1828 he was appointed flag lieutenant to [[Rear-Admiral]] [[Robert Waller Otway|Sir Robert Waller Otway]], commander-in-chief of the South American station, aboard {{HMS|Ganges|1821|6}}.

At that time ''Beagle'', under Captain [[Pringle Stokes]], was carrying out a hydrographic survey of [[Tierra del Fuego]], under the overall command of Captain [[Phillip Parker King]] in [[HMS Aid (1809)|HMS ''Adventure'']]. Pringle Stokes became severely depressed and fatally shot himself. Under Lieutenant Skyring, the ship sailed to [[Rio de Janeiro]], where Otway appointed FitzRoy as (temporary) captain of the ''Beagle'' on 15 December 1828. By the ship's return to England on 14 October 1830, FitzRoy had established his reputation as a surveyor and commander.

During the survey, some of his men were camping onshore when a group of Fuegian natives made off with their boat. His ship gave chase and, after a scuffle, the culprits' families were brought on board as hostages. Eventually FitzRoy held two boys, a girl and two men (one man escaped.) As it was not possible to put them ashore conveniently, he decided to "civilise the savages", teaching them "English ... the plainer truths of Christianity ... and the use of common tools" before returning them as missionaries.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

The sailors gave them names: the girl was  called [[Fuegia Basket]] (so named because the replacement for the stolen boat was an improvised [[coracle]] that resembled a basket), the boy [[Jemmy Button]] (FitzRoy purchased him with buttons), and the man he named York Minster (after the large rock near which he was captured). The second boy was called [[Boat Memory]]. FitzRoy brought the four back with the ship to England. Boat Memory died following a [[smallpox]] vaccination. The others were cared for and taught by the trainee missionary Richard Matthews; they were considered civilised enough to be presented at Court to King William IV and Queen Adelaide in the summer of 1831.

==HMS ''Beagle''{{'}}s second voyage==
{{Main|Second voyage of HMS Beagle}}

In early May 1831 FitzRoy stood as [[Tory]] candidate for [[Ipswich]] in the General Election, but was defeated. His hopes of obtaining a new posting and organising a missionary project to Tierra del Fuego appeared to be failing. He was arranging for the charter of a ship at his own expense to return the Fuegians with Matthews when his friend [[Francis Beaufort]], [[Hydrographer of the Navy|Hydrographer]] to the [[British Admiralty]], and his "kind uncle", the [[George FitzRoy, 4th Duke of Grafton|Duke of Grafton]], interceded on his behalf at the Admiralty. On 25 June 1831 FitzRoy was re-appointed commander of the ''Beagle''. He spared no expense in fitting out the ship.

He was conscious of the stressful loneliness of command. He knew of the suicides both of Captain Stokes and of his uncle Viscount Castlereagh, who had cut his own throat in 1822 while in government office. FitzRoy talked to Beaufort in August 1831, asking him to find a suitable gentleman companion for the voyage. Such a companion should share his scientific tastes, make good use of the expedition's opportunities for researching natural history, dine with him as an equal, and provide a semblance of normal human friendship.&lt;ref name=browne&gt;{{Cite book |last=Browne |first=Janet |title=Charles Darwin: Voyaging |publisher=Pimlico |date=7 August 2003 |isbn=1-84413-314-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; While those Beaufort first approached (including Professor [[J. S. Henslow]] of the University of Cambridge) turned the opportunity down, FitzRoy eventually approved [[Charles Darwin]] for the position. Before they left England, FitzRoy gave Darwin a copy of the first volume of [[Charles Lyell]]'s ''Principles of Geology'', a book the captain had read that explained terrestrial features as the outcome of a gradual process taking place over extremely long periods. FitzRoy took a request from Lyell to record observations on geological features, such as erratic boulders.&lt;ref name=intro&gt;Introduction by Janet Browne and Michael Neve to – {{Cite book |last=Darwin |first=Charles |title=Voyage of the Beagle |publisher=Penguin Books |date=1989 |location=London |isbn=0-14-043268-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FitzRoy and Darwin got on well together, but there were inevitable strains during the five-year survey voyage. The captain had a violent temper, his outbursts had gained him the nickname "Hot Coffee",&lt;ref name=dm&gt;{{Cite book| last = Desmond | first = Adrian | author-link = Adrian Desmond | last2 = Moore | first2 = James | author2-link = James Moore (biographer) | year = 1991 | title = Darwin | publication-place = London | publisher = Michael Joseph, Penguin Group | isbn = 0-7181-3430-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; which resulted in quarrels sometimes "bordering on insanity", as Darwin later recalled. On a memorable occasion in March 1832 at [[Bahia]], Brazil, Darwin was horrified at tales of the treatment of [[slaves]]. FitzRoy, while not endorsing brutality, recounted how an ''estancia'' owner once asked his slaves if they wished to be free and was told they did not. Darwin asked FitzRoy if he thought slaves could answer such a question honestly when it was posed by their master, at which the captain lost his temper and, before storming out, told Darwin that if he doubted his word they could no longer live together; effectively he banished Darwin from his table. Before nightfall FitzRoy's temper cooled and he sent an apology, with the request that Darwin "continue to live with him." They avoided the subject of slavery from that time on. None of their quarrels were over religious or doctrinal issues; such disagreements came after the voyage.&lt;ref name=browne /&gt;

At the island of "Buttons Land" in [[Tierra del Fuego]] they set up a mission post, but when they returned nine days later, the possessions had been looted. Matthews gave up, rejoining the ship. He left the three "westernised" Fuegians to continue the missionary work.

While in the [[Falkland Islands]], FitzRoy bought a [[schooner]] out of his own funds to assist with the surveying tasks he had been asked to complete. He had it refitted and renamed ''Adventure'', hoping that the cost would be reimbursed by the [[Admiralty]]. They returned to the mission post but found only [[Jemmy Button]]. He had returned to native ways and refused the offer to go with them back to England.

At [[Valparaiso]] in 1834, while Charles Darwin was away from the ship exploring the [[Andes]], the Admiralty reprimanded FitzRoy for buying the ''Adventure''. He took the criticism badly, selling the schooner and announcing they would go back to recheck his survey, then resigning his command with doubts about his sanity. The ship's officers persuaded him to withdraw his resignation and continue as planned once Darwin returned to the ship.&lt;ref name=dm/&gt; FitzRoy continued his voyage, sailing on to the [[Galapagos]], Tahiti, New Zealand, Australia and South Africa. He detoured to [[Bahia]] in Brazil on the return voyage so that he could carry out an additional check, to ensure the accuracy of his longitude measurements before returning to England.

==Return from the voyage==
Soon after the ''Beagle'''s return on 2 October 1836, FitzRoy married Mary Henrietta O'Brien,  a young woman to whom he had long been engaged. Darwin was amazed, as not once during the entire five years of the trip had FitzRoy spoken about being engaged.

FitzRoy was awarded a gold medal by the [[Royal Geographical Society]] in 1837. Extracts from his diary read to the society on 8 May 1837 included the observation:
:Is it not extraordinary, that sea-worn, ''rolled'', shingle-stones, and alluvial accumulations, compose the greater portion of these plains? How vast, and of what immense ''duration'', must have been the actions of these waters which smoothed the shingle-stones now buried in the deserts of Patagonia!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=FitzRoy |first=R. |year=1837 |title=Extracts from the Diary of an Attempt to Ascend the River Santa Cruz, in Patagonia, with the boats of his Majesty's sloop Beagle |journal=Journal of the Royal Geographical Society of London |volume=7 |pages=114–26 |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=2&amp;itemID=A74&amp;viewtype=image |jstor=1797517}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FitzRoy wrote his account of the voyage, including editing the notes of the previous captain of the ''Beagle.'' It was published in May 1839 as the ''Narrative of the Surveying Voyages of H.M.S. Adventure and Beagle,'' in four volumes, including Darwin's ''Journal and Remarks, 1832—1836'' as the third volume. FitzRoy's account includes a section of ''Remarks with reference to the Deluge'' in which he admits that, having read works "by geologists who contradict, by implication, if not in plain terms, the authenticity of the Scriptures" and "while led away by sceptical ideas," he had remarked to a friend that the vast plain of sedimentary material they were crossing "could never have been effected by a forty days' flood." He wrote that in his "turn of mind and ignorance of scripture," he was willing to disbelieve the Biblical account. Concerned that such ideas might "reach the eyes of young sailors," he explains in detail his renewed commitment to a literal reading of the Bible, with arguments that rock layers high in the mountains containing sea shells are proof of [[Noah's Flood]] and that the six days of creation could not have extended over aeons because the grass, herbs and trees would have died out during the long nights.&lt;ref name=deluge&gt;{{Cite book |chapter=Chapter XXVIII: A Very Few Remarks with Reference to the Deluge |chapterurl=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=776&amp;itemID=F10.2&amp;viewtype=image |last=FitzRoy |first=Robert |title=Narrative of the Surveying Voyages of His Majesty's Ships Adventure and Beagle between the years 1826 and 1836, describing their examination of the southern shores of South America, and the Beagle's circumnavigation of the globe.

R.D. Keynes, in his introduction to the 2001 edition of Darwin's diary, suggests that FitzRoy had undergone a religious conversion.&lt;ref name="CD diary" /&gt; He was dissociating himself from the new ideas of [[Charles Lyell]], which he had accepted during the voyage, and from Darwin's account which embraced these ideas. Under the influence of his very religious wife, he asserted a new commitment to the doctrine of the established [[Church of England]].&lt;ref name=dm /&gt;

In 1841 FitzRoy was elected the Tory Member of Parliament for [[City of Durham (UK Parliament constituency)|Durham]]. He was appointed [[Acting Conservator of the River Mersey]] in 1842.

==Governor of New Zealand==
The first Governor of New Zealand, Captain [[William Hobson]], [[Royal Navy|R.N.]], died in late 1842. The [[Church Missionary Society]], which had a strong New Zealand presence, suggested FitzRoy as his successor and he was appointed by the government. He took up his new task in December 1843. On the journey to New Zealand, he met [[William John Warburton Hamilton]] and made him his private secretary.{{sfn|Scholefield |1940 |p=349}}

His instructions were to maintain order and protect the [[Māori people|Māori]], while satisfying the land hunger of the settlers pouring into the country. He was given very few military resources. Government revenue, mainly from customs duties, was woefully inadequate for his responsibilities.

One of his first tasks was to enquire into the circumstances surrounding the [[Wairau Affray]], in which there had been violent conflict between settlers and the Maori. He found the actions of the colonists to have been illegal and declined to take any action against [[Te Rauparaha]]. He did not have the troops to meet him on anything like equal terms. But the [[New Zealand Company]] and the settlers felt betrayed and angry. He appointed a Government Superintendent for the area, to establish a ruling presence. Fitzroy also insisted that the New Zealand Company pay the Māori a realistic price for the land they claimed to have purchased. These moves made him very unpopular.

Land sales were a continuing vexatious issue. The settlers were eager to buy land and some Māori were willing to sell, but under the provisions of the [[Treaty of Waitangi]], land sales required the Government as an intermediary, and were thus extremely slow. FitzRoy changed the rules to allow settlers to purchase Māori land directly, subject to a duty of ten shillings per acre. But land sales proved slower than expected.

To meet the financial shortfall, FitzRoy raised the customs duties, then replaced them with [[property tax|property]] and [[income tax]]es. All these expedients failed. Before long the Colony was faced with bankruptcy, and FitzRoy was forced to begin issuing [[promissory note]]s, paper money without backing.

Meanwhile, the Māori in the far North, around the [[Bay of Islands]], who had been the first to sign the Treaty of Waitangi, were feeling increasingly sidelined and resentful of the changes that had taken place in New Zealand. To signal their resentment, [[Hone Heke]] cut down the flagpole at [[Kororareka]]. Rather than address the problems, FitzRoy had the flagpole re-erected. Hone Heke cut it down again, four times altogether; by the fourth occasion the First New Zealand War, sometimes called the [[Flagstaff War]] or the Northern War, was well under way.

FitzRoy quickly realized that he did not have the resources to bring about a quick end to the war. Meanwhile, the spokesmen for the New Zealand Company were active back in the United Kingdom, lobbying against FitzRoy's Governorship, which they presented to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] in a very poor light. As a result, he was shortly afterwards recalled and replaced by [[George Grey]], then [[Governor of South Australia]]. Grey was given the backing and financial support that FitzRoy had needed but was denied.

==Later life and impact on meteorology==
[[File:FitzRoy.jpg|thumb|left|FitzRoy circa 1855]]

FitzRoy returned to Britain in September 1848 and was made superintendent of the Royal Naval Dockyards at [[Woolwich]]. In March 1849 he was given his final sea command, the screw frigate {{HMS|Arrogant|1848|6}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Agnew |first=Duncan Carr |title=Robert Fitzroy and the Myth of the 'Marsden Square': Transatlantic Rivalries in Early Marine Meteorology |journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London |volume=58 |issue=1 |page=26 |publisher=The Royal Society |location=London, UK |date=January 2004 |jstor=4142031 |doi= 10.1098/rsnr.2003.0223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1850, FitzRoy retired from active service, partly due to ill health. The following year, in 1851, he was elected to the [[Royal Society]] with the support of 13 fellows, including Charles Darwin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://royalsociety.org/~/media/Royal_Society_Content/about-us/fellowship/Fellows1660-2007.pdf?la=en-GB |title=List of Fellows of the Royal Society 1660–2007 |website=The Royal Society Library and Information Services |accessdate=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1854, on the recommendation of the President of the Royal Society, FitzRoy was appointed as chief of a new department to deal with the collection of weather data at sea. His title was ''Meteorological Statist to the Board of Trade'', and he had a staff of three. This was the forerunner of the modern [[Met Office|Meteorological Office]]. He arranged for captains of ships to provide information, with tested instruments being loaned for this purpose, and for computation of the data collected.&lt;ref name="Mellersh, H. E. L. 1968"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Mellersh |first=H. E. L. |year=1968 |title=FitzRoy of the Beagle |publisher=Hart-Davis |isbn=0-246-97452-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fitzroy fisheries barometer No 98, Stromness, Orkney.jpg|thumb|Fitzroy fisheries barometer No 98, [[Stromness]], [[Orkney]]]]
FitzRoy soon began to work on strategies to make weather information more widely available for the safety of shipping and fishermen. He directed the design and distribution of a type of [[barometer]] which, on his recommendation, was fixed at every port to be available to crews for consultation before setting out to sea. Stone housings for such barometers are still visible at many fishing harbours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.webhistorian.co.uk/pages/index.php?id=190 |title=Scottish Harbour Barometers |work=Banffshire Maritime &amp; Heritage Association |accessdate=17 September 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225234206/http://www.webhistorian.co.uk/pages/index.php?id=190 |archivedate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The invention of several different types of [[barometer]]s was attributed to him. These became popular and continued in production into the 20th century, characteristically engraved with ''Admiral FitzRoy's special remarks'' on interpretation, such as: "When rising: In winter the rise of the barometer presages frost."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.queenswood.com/barometer/admiral.htm |title=Admiral FitzRoy's special remarks |work=Queenswood.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705095138/http://www.queenswood.com/barometer/admiral.htm |archivedate=5 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Royal Charter Storm|A storm in 1859]] that caused the loss of the [[Royal Charter (ship)|''Royal Charter'']] inspired FitzRoy to develop charts to allow predictions to be made in which he coined the term "weather forecast".&lt;ref name="Mellersh, H. E. L. 1968"/&gt; Fifteen land stations were established to use the new [[telegraph]] to transmit to him daily reports of weather at set times. The first daily weather forecasts were published in ''[[The Times]]'' in 1861.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; The 1859 storm resulted in the Crown distributing [[storm glass]]es, then known as "FitzRoy's storm barometers", to many small fishing communities around the British Isles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.weathernotebook.org/transcripts/2004/05/07.php |title=Storm Glass |work=The Weather Notebook |publisher=[[Mount Washington Observatory]] |date=7 May 2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120114915/http://www.weathernotebook.org/transcripts/2004/05/07.php |archivedate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1860, FitzRoy introduced a system of hoisting storm warning cones at the principal ports when a gale was expected. He ordered fleets to stay in port under these conditions.&lt;ref name="Kington"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Climates of the British Isles: Present, Past and Future |first=John |last=Kington |editor-first1=Mike |editor-last1=Hulme |editor-first2=Elaine |editor-last2=Barrow |date=1997 |publisher=Routledge |page=147 |isbn=978-0-41513-016-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Weather Book,'' which he published in 1863, was far in advance of the scientific opinion of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/learning/library/archive-hidden-treasures/royal-charter|website=Met Office website|title=The Royal Charter Gale and the world's first National Forecasting Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Queen Victoria]] once sent messengers to FitzRoy's home requesting a weather forecast for a crossing she was about to make to the [[Isle of Wight]].&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web |title=The birth of the weather forecast |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-32483678 |last=Moore |first=Peter |date=30 April 2015 |website=BBC News |accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many fishing fleet owners objected to the posting of gale warnings, which required that fleets not leave the ports. Under this pressure, FitzRoy's system was abandoned for a short time after his death. The fishing fleet owners reckoned without the pressure of the fishermen, for whom FitzRoy had been a hero responsible for saving many lives. The system would was eventually reinstated in simplified form in 1874.&lt;ref name="Kington"/&gt;

When ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' was published FitzRoy was dismayed and apparently felt guilty for his part in the theory's development. He was in [[Oxford]] on 30 June 1860 to present a paper on storms and attended [[1860 Oxford evolution debate|the meeting]] of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] at which [[Samuel Wilberforce]] attacked Darwin's theory. During the debate FitzRoy, seen as "a grey haired Roman nosed elderly gentleman", stood in the centre of the audience and "lifting an immense Bible first with both and afterwards with one hand over his head, solemnly implored the audience to believe God rather than man". As he admitted that ''The Origin of Species'' had given him "acutest pain", the crowd shouted him down.

FitzRoy debunked Lieutenant [[Stephen Martin Saxby]]'s lunar weather forecasting method as pseudoscience. Saxby tried to counter FitzRoy's arguments in the second edition of his book ''Saxby Weather System'' (1864).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Saxby |first=S.

===Death and legacy===
[[File:Robert FitzRoy's Grave.JPG|thumb|Robert FitzRoy's grave]]
In 1863 FitzRoy was promoted to Vice-Admiral due to seniority, but in the coming years internal and external troubles at the Meteorological Office, financial concerns as well as failing health, and his struggle with [[Mood disorder|depression]] took their toll.&lt;ref&gt;Gribbin, John &amp; Mary (2003).

FitzRoy is buried in the front churchyard of All Saints' Church in [[Upper Norwood]], south London. His memorial was restored by the Meteorological Office in 1981.

FitzRoy's book ''Sailing Directions for South America'' led Chilean hydrographer [[Francisco Hudson]] to investigate the possible existence of a sailing route through internal waters from the [[Chiloé Archipelago]] to the [[Straits of Magellan]]. Hudson was the first to realise that the [[Isthmus of Ofqui]] made this route impossible.

==Personal life==
Robert FitzRoy was married twice. In 1836 he married Mary Henrietta O'Brien. They had four children: Emily-Unah, Fanny, Katherine and [[Robert O'Brien FitzRoy|Robert O'Brien]]. In 1854, after the death of his first wife, he married Maria Isabella Smyth in London. They had one daughter, Laura Elizabeth.

==Memorials==
A memorial to FitzRoy is erected atop a metamorphic outcrop beside the [[Bahia Wulaia]] dome [[middens]] on [[Isla Navarino]], in the [[Chile]]an part of [[Tierra del Fuego]] archipelago, South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |first=C. Michael |last=Hogan |year=2008 |url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=18795 |title=Bahia Wulaia Dome Middens |work=Megalithic Portal}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was presented in his bicentenary (2005) and commemorates his 23 January 1833 landing on Wulaia Cove. Another memorial, presented also in FitzRoy's bicentenary, commemorates his [[Cape Horn]] landing on 19 April 1830.

[[Mount Fitz Roy]] ([[Argentina]]–[[Chile]], at the extreme south of the continent), was named after him by the Argentine scientist and explorer [[Francisco Moreno]].  It is {{convert|3440|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} high.  The aboriginals had not named it, and used the word ''chaltén'' (meaning smoking mountain) for this and other peaks.  [[Fitzroy River (Western Australia)|Fitzroy River]], in northern Western Australia, was named after him by Lieutenant [[John Lort Stokes]] who, at the time, commanded HMS ''Beagle'' (previously commanded by FitzRoy).  The South American [[conifer]] [[Fitzroya|''Fitzroya cupressoides'']] is named after him, as well as the ''Delphinus fitzroyi'', a species of dolphin discovered by Darwin during his voyage aboard the ''Beagle''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Bryson |first=Bill |authorlink=Bill Bryson |year=2005 |title=A Short History of Nearly Everything |location=London |publisher=Transworld |page=481}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Fitzroy, Falkland Islands]] and [[Port Fitzroy]], New Zealand are also named after him.

The World War II [[captain class frigate|Captain class]] frigate {{HMS|Fitzroy|K553}} was named after him, as was the weather ship ''Admiral Fitzroy'' (formerly {{HMS|Amberley Castle|K386|6}}). In 2010 New Zealand's [[National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research]] (NIWA) named its new [[IBM]] [[supercomputer]] "FitzRoy" in honour of him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.geekzone.co.nz/content.asp?ContentId=8862|title=NIWA Installs new IBM supercomputer |work=Geekzone |date=21 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 February 2002, when the [[Shipping Forecast|shipping forecast sea area]] Finisterre was renamed to avoid confusion with the (smaller) French and Spanish forecast area of the [[Cape Finisterre|same name]], the new name chosen by the UK's Meteorological Office was "FitzRoy", in honour of their founder.

FitzRoy has been commemorated by the Fitzroy Building at the [[University of Plymouth]], used by the School of Earth, Ocean and Environmental Science.

There is [[blue plaque]] on FitzRoy's house at 38 [[Onslow Square]], London.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/blue-plaques/fitzroy-admiral-robert-1805-1865&lt;/ref&gt;

Vice-Admiral Robert FitzRoy was commemorated on two stamps issued by the [[Royal Mail]] for the [[Falkland Islands]] and [[St Helena]].

[[Fitzroy Island (Queensland)|Fitzroy Island]] in Queensland, Australia is named after FitzRoy,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hmsbeagleproject.org/timeline/robert-fitzroy-takes-his-own-life/]&lt;/ref&gt; as are the [[Fitzroy River (Western Australia)|Fitzroy River]] and subsequently [[Fitzroy Crossing, Western Australia|Fitzroy Crossing]] in Western Australia.

==In fiction==
The [[BBC]] made a [[BAFTA]] award-winning television series in 1978 titled [[The Voyage of Charles Darwin]] where Captain Robert Fitzroy was played by actor [[Andrew Burt]] with [[Malcolm Stoddard]] as [[Charles Darwin]] with a storyline that followed the historic interaction between Darwin and FizRoy before and after their time together on [[HMS Beagle]].

In 1997, the play ''FitzRoy'' by [[Juliet Aykroyd]] was first performed at the [[University of Reading]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/DARWIN-FITZROY-Juliet-Aykroyd-ebook/dp/B00FQ1D71W |title=Darwin &amp; FitzRoy |first=Juliet |last=Aykroyd |date=8 October 2013 |publisher=Sulivan &amp; Stokes |accessdate=23 March 2017 |via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has since been performed under the title ''The Ostrich and the Dolphin''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uktw.co.uk/archive/Play/The-Ostrich-and-the-Dolphin/S81754965/ |title=The Ostrich and the Dolphin (play) |work=UK Theatre Web |accessdate=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; – alluding to [[Darwin's rhea]] and the [[Dusky dolphin]], named ''Delphinus fitzroyi'' by [[Charles Darwin]] – before being published as ''Darwin &amp; FitzRoy'' in October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.staythirstymedia.com/bookpublishing/html/authors/sulivan-stokes/aykroyd-juliet.html |title=Authors: Juliet Aykroyd |work=Stay Thirsty Media |accessdate=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A novel by Argentinian writer, Sylvia Iparraguirre, entitled ''Tierra del Fuego'', was published in 2000. It retells the story of Fitzroy's experiment with "civilizing" the Yamaná from the perspective of a fictional narrator, British-Argentinian Jack Guevarra. The novel received the Sor Juana de la Cruz prize and was translated into English by Hardie St. Martin. 

A novel entitled ''[[This Thing of Darkness]]'' by [[Harry Thompson]] was published in 2005 (it was published in the U.S. in 2006 under the title ''To the Edge of the World''). The novel's plot followed the lives of FitzRoy, Darwin and others connected with the Beagle expeditions, following them between the years of 1828 and 1865. It was a nominee on the [[Short list#Literary awards|long list]] for the 2005 [[Man Booker Prize]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://themanbookerprize.com/books/thing-darkness-by |title=This Thing of Darkness |year=2005 |work=Man Booker Prize |accessdate=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (although Thompson died in November 2005).

The novel ''[[Darwin's Dreams]]'' by [[Sean Hoade]] was published in 2008 and republished in a new edition in 2016. The novel begins with the first meeting of Darwin and FitzRoy and ends with Darwin receiving notice of FitzRoy's suicide. The plot is interlaced with fictional ″dreams″ that imagine how the world would be if the ideas of evolutionary thinkers over the millennia had been literally true. The dreams also show how Darwin's subconscious dealt with major themes in his life such as the death of his beloved daughter Annie and his lifelong friendship and rivalry with FitzRoy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hoade |first=Sean |title=Darwin's Dreams |url=https://seanhoade.com/the-literary-historical-fantasy-darwins-dreams/ |accessdate=28 June 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808182900/https://seanhoade.com/the-literary-historical-fantasy-darwins-dreams/ |archivedate=8 August 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The play ''Darwins Kapten'' was published by [[Henning Mankell]] in 2009, and had its world premiere in 2010 at the [[Royal Dramatic Theatre]] in [[Stockholm]]. It is about Charles Darwin and his journey with the ''Beagle'': many years after the five-year long voyage, Darwin receives a message that his captain on the ship, FitzRoy, has committed suicide. The play portrays the reception of Darwin's discoveries, as well as the consequences of taking a stand against existing ideas in a world that is built on belief in God as the only creator of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mankell |first=Henning |title=Darwin's Captain |url=http://henningmankell.com/theater/plays/darwins-captain/ |work=henningmankell.com |accessdate=10 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222021849/http://henningmankell.com/theater/plays/darwins-captain/ |archivedate=22 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Orion1 big.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Airglow made visible from aboard the [[International Space Station|ISS]]]]

'''Sky brightness''' refers to the [[visual perception]] of the [[sky]] and how it [[light scattering|scatters]] and [[diffuse sky radiation|diffuses]] light. The fact that the sky is not completely dark at [[night]] is easily visible. If light sources (e.g. the [[moonlight|Moon]] and [[light pollution]]) were removed from the [[night sky]], it would appear absolutely dark. [[Silhouette]]s of objects against the sky itself would not be visible.

The sky's brightness varies greatly over the day, and the primary cause differs as well. During [[daytime]], when the [[Sun]] is above the horizon, the [[Rayleigh scattering|direct scattering]] of [[sunlight]] is the overwhelmingly dominant source of light. During [[twilight]] (the duration after [[sunset]] or before [[sunrise]] until or since, respectively, the full darkness of night), the situation is more complicated, and a further differentiation is required.

Twilight (both [[dusk]] and [[dawn]]) is divided into three 6° segments that mark the Sun's position below the horizon. At [[civil twilight]], the center of the Sun's disk appears to be between 1/4° and 6° below the horizon. At [[nautical twilight]], the Sun's [[horizontal coordinate system|altitude]] is between –6° and –12°. At [[astronomical twilight]], the Sun is between –12° and –18°. When the Sun's depth is more than 18°, the sky generally attains its maximum darkness.

Sources of the night sky's intrinsic brightness include [[airglow]], indirect scattering of [[sunlight]], scattering of [[starlight]], and [[skyglow|light pollution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=F. Patat |url=http://www.eso.org/~fpatat/science/skybright/ |title=The Brightness of the Night Sky |publisher=[[European Southern Observatory|ESO]] |accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Airglow==
When physicist [[Anders Ångström]] examined the spectrum of the [[aurora borealis]], he discovered that even on nights when the aurora was absent, its characteristic green line was still present. It was not until the 1920s that scientists were beginning to identify and understand the [[emission line]]s in aurorae and of the sky itself, and what was causing them. The green line Angstrom observed is in fact an emission line with a wavelength of 557.7&amp;nbsp;nm, caused by the recombination of oxygen in the upper atmosphere.

Airglow is the collective name of the various processes in the upper atmosphere that result in the emission of photons, with the driving force being primarily [[ultraviolet|UV radiation]] from the Sun. Several emission lines are dominant: a green line from oxygen at 557.7&amp;nbsp;nm, a yellow doublet from sodium at 589.0 and 589.6&amp;nbsp;nm, and red lines from oxygen at 630.0 and 636.4&amp;nbsp;nm.

The sodium emissions come from a thin [[sodium layer]] approximately 10&amp;nbsp;km thick at an altitude of 90–100&amp;nbsp;km, above the [[mesopause]] and in the D-layer of the [[ionosphere]]. The red oxygen lines originate at altitudes of about 300&amp;nbsp;km, in the F-layer. The green oxygen emissions are more spatially distributed. How sodium gets to mesospheric heights is not yet well understood, but it is believed to be a combination of upward transport of [[sea salt]] and [[meteor]]itic dust.

In daytime, sodium and red oxygen emissions are dominant and roughly 1,000 times as bright as nighttime emissions because in daytime, the upper atmosphere is fully exposed to solar UV radiation. The effect is however not noticeable to the human eye, since the glare of [[Rayleigh scattering|directly scattered]] sunlight outshines and obscures it.

==Indirect scattering of sunlight==
[[Image:Illuminated-arimass.png|250px|thumb|Amount of air still illuminated after sunset, at the horizon. Normalized so that zenith is 1 airmass]]
Indirectly scattered sunlight comes from two directions. From the atmosphere itself, and from outer space. In the first case, the sun has just set but still illuminates the upper atmosphere directly. Because the amount of scattered sunlight is proportional to the number of scatterers (i.e. air molecules) in the line of sight, the intensity of this light decreases rapidly as the sun drops further below the horizon and illuminates less of the atmosphere.

When the sun's altitude is &lt; -6° 99% of the atmosphere in [[zenith]] is in the Earth's shadow and second order scattering takes over. At the horizon, however, 35% of the atmosphere along the line of sight is still directly illuminated, and continues to be until the sun reaches -12°. From -12° to -18° only the uppermost parts of the atmosphere along the horizon, directly above the spot where the sun is, is still illuminated. After that, all direct illumination ceases and astronomical darkness sets in.

A second source sunlight is the [[zodiacal light]], which is caused by reflection and scattering of sunlight on interplanetary dust. Zodiacal light varies quite a lot in intensity depending on the position of the earth, location of the observer, time of year, and composition and distribution of the reflecting dust.

==Scattered light from extraterrestrial sources==
Not only sunlight is scattered by the molecules in the air. Starlight and the diffuse light of the milky way are also scattered by the air, and it is found that stars up to V magnitude 16 contribute to the diffuse scattered starlight.

Other sources such as galaxies and nebulae don't contribute significantly.

The total brightness of all the stars was first measured by Burns in 1899, with a calculated result that the total brightness reaching earth was equivalent to that of 2,000 first-magnitude stars &lt;ref&gt;Burns, G. J., "The total amount of starlight and the brightness of the sky," ''The Observatory, Vol. 33'', p. 123-129, March 1910; available at [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1910Obs....33..123B SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System] (retrieved 27 Nov. 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; with subsequent measurements by others.&lt;ref&gt;Yntema, L., "On the Brightness of the Sky and Total Amount of Starlight," ''Publications of the Kapteyn Astronomical Laboratory Groningen, vol. 22'', pp.1-55 (1909); available at [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1909PGro...22....1Y SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System] (retrieved 27 Nov. 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;
''

==Light pollution==
{{Main|Light pollution}}
Light pollution is an ever-increasing source of sky brightness in [[Urban area|urbanized area]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. In densely populated areas that do not have stringent light pollution control, the entire night sky is regularly 5 to 50 times brighter than it would be if all lights were switched off, and very often the influence of light pollution is far greater than natural sources (including moonlight). With [[urbanization]] and light pollution, one third of humanity, and the majority of those in developed countries, cannot see the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/jun/10/milky-way-no-longer-visible-to-one-third-of-humanity-light-pollution|title=Milky Way no longer visible to one third of humanity, light pollution atlas shows|last=Davis|first=Nicola|date=2016-06-10|website=the Guardian|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Twilight==
When the sun has just set, the brightness of the sky decreases rapidly, thereby enabling us to see the airglow that is caused from such high altitudes that they are still fully sunlit until the sun drops more than about 12° below the horizon. During this time, yellow emissions from the sodium layer and red emissions from the 630&amp;nbsp;nm oxygen lines are dominant, and contribute to the purplish color sometimes seen during civil and nautical twilight.

After the sun has also set for these altitudes at the end of nautical twilight, the intensity of light emanating from earlier mentioned lines decreases, until the oxygen-green remains as the dominant source.

When astronomical darkness has set in, the green 557.7&amp;nbsp;nm oxygen line is dominant, and atmospheric scattering of starlight occurs.

Differential refraction causes different parts of the spectrum to dominate, producing a [[Golden hour (photography)|golden hour]] and a [[blue hour]].

==Relative contributions==
The following table gives the relative and absolute contributions to night sky brightness at zenith on a perfectly dark night at middle latitudes without moonlight and in the absence of any [[light pollution]].

(The S&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; unit is defined as the surface brightness of a star whose V-magnitude is 10 and whose light is smeared over one square degree, or 27.78 mag arcsec&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.)

The total sky brightness in zenith is therefore ~220 S&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; or 21.9 mag/arcsec² in the V-band. Note that the contributions from Airglow and Zodiacal light vary with the time of year, the solar cycle, and the observer's latitude roughly as follows:

:&lt;math&gt; {\rm Airglow}/{\rm S}_{10} = 145+108(S-0.8)&lt;/math&gt;
where ''S'' is the solar 10.7&amp;nbsp;cm flux in MJy, and various sinusoidally between 0.8 and 2.0 with the 11-year solar cycle, yielding an upper contribution of ~270 S&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; at solar maximum.

The intensity of zodiacal light depends on the [[Ecliptic coordinate system|ecliptic latitude and longitude]] of the point in the sky being observed relative to that of the sun. At ecliptic longitudes differing from the sun's by &gt; 90 degrees, the relation is 
:&lt;math&gt; {\rm ZodiacalLight}/{\rm S}_{10} = 140 - 90\sin(|\beta|)&lt;/math&gt; 
where ''β'' is the ecliptic latitude and is smaller than 60°, when larger than 60 degrees the contribution is that given in the table. Along the ecliptic plane there are enhancements in the zodiacal light where it is much brighter near the sun and with a secondary maximum opposite the sun at 180 degrees longitude (the [[gegenschein]]).

In extreme cases natural zenith sky brightness can be as high as ~21.0 mag/arcsec², roughly twice as bright as nominal conditions.

{{see also|Synthetic fuels in the United States#Proposed projects|l1=Synthetic fuels in the United States}}
In the United States, a number of different synthetic fuels projects are moving forward, with the first expected to enter commercial operation starting in 2015.

Baard Energy, in its Ohio River Clean Fuels project, is developing a {{convert|53000|oilbbl/d}} Fischer Tropsch gas and biomass to liquids project with the carbon capture and sequestration. Pending close of a financing package, Baard hopes to begin on site preparation work before the end of 2009, with plant construction starting in 2010. Initial project startup is anticipated in 2013, with full production capacity targeted in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.baardenergy.com/orcf.htm| title = Baard Energy website, Ohio River Clean Fuels section| accessdate = 2009-06-24| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090225191503/http://www.baardenergy.com/orcf.htm| archivedate = 2009-02-25| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.reviewonline.com/page/content.detail/id/516873.html?nav=5008| title =Investors move forward with Baard Energy plant | accessdate = 2009-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.ohioforest.org/pdf/stevedopuchpresentation.ppt| title = Outlook for Clean Fuels from Coal and Biomass, Steve Dopuch, Baard Energy, L.L.C., March 7, 2009| accessdate = 2009-07-23| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110727141728/http://www.ohioforest.org/pdf/stevedopuchpresentation.ppt| archivedate = July 27, 2011| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===

Choren Industries in Freiberg, Germany has the only operational Biomass to Liquids (BTL) demonstration plant that produces 300 barrels of Fischer Tropsch fuels per day.

===India===

Bioleum Resources is building India's first Biomass to Liquids plant near Pune, India.

===Aviation fuel===
An effort has been undertaken to certify various synthetic fuels for use in US and international aviation fleets. This is being led by an industry coalition known as the [[Commercial Aviation Alternative Fuels Initiative]](CAAFI),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.caafi.org/information/pdf/CAAFI_factsheet_12dec2008.pdf| title =Significant progress made towards adoption of semi-synthetic aviation fuel | accessdate = 2009-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; also supported by a parallel initiative under way in the US Air Force to certify synthetic fuels for use in all aviation platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.defensenews.com/story.php?i=3969089&amp;c=FEA&amp;s=TEC| title = Synthetic Future, USAF Pushes Ahead With Fuel Production Despite Price Drop| accessdate = 2009-06-24}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The US Air Force has certified 99% of it fleet for use with a 50/50 blend of conventional and FT Synthetic Fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.af.mil/About-Us/Speeches-Archive/Display/Article/143845/leadership-balance-and-strategic-opportunities/ |title= Leadership, Balance and Strategic Opportunities |author= Undersecretary of the Air Force Erin C. Conaton |work= Remarks at the Air Force Association's 2011 Air &amp; Space Conference &amp; Technology Exposition, |date= Sep 20, 2011 |publisher= US Air Force}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CAAFI initiative has also succeeded in achieving full ASTM certification for a 50/50 blend of both FT-SPK and HEFA synthetic fuels for use in civilian aviation platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.astmnewsroom.org/default.aspx?pageid=2524| title =ASTM Aviation Fuel Standard Now Specifies Bioderived Components |date= July 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--A380 experiment--&gt;
On 1 February 2008, a three-hour [[Airbus A380]] test flight operated between Britain and France, with one of four engines using a mix of 60% standard [[jet fuel]] and 40% [[gas to liquids|GTL]] fuel supplied by [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Airbus conducts A380 alternative-fuel demonstration flight |work=Flight International |date= 1 February 2008 |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/pictures-airbus-conducts-a380-alternative-fuel-demo-221245/|author= Graham Dunn }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The aircraft needed no modifications, Airbus said the GTL used has the same [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] emmissions but contains no sulphur for better air quality.&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{Cite news |author= Dan Lalor |title= A380 makes test flight on alternative fuel |agency= Reuters |date= 1 February 2008 |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2008/02/02/environment-airbus-fuel-dc-idUSL0120071420080202?rpc=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2008, [[Sasol]] announced that they have achieved the first approval for 100% synthetic jet fuel use sanctioned by global aviation fuel specification authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.aviationpros.com/press_release/10404949/sasol-100-synthetic-fuel-wins-first-time-approval-for-use-internationally-in-commercial-aviation |title= Sasol - 100% Synthetic Fuel Wins First-Time Approval for Use Internationally in Commercial Aviation |date= April 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 October 2009, a [[Qatar Airways]] Airbus A340-600 conducted the world's first commercial passenger flight using  a mixture of kerosene and synthetic Gas-to-Liquid fuel in its flight from London's [[Gatwick Airport]] to Doha.&lt;ref name=downstream1&gt;{{cite web| url =http://topairlinereview.blogspot.com/2011/07/lufthansa-launches-regular-scheduled.html| title =Lufthansa launches regular scheduled biofuel flights | accessdate = 2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 July 2011 Lufthansa has launched a 6-month biofuel trial on regular scheduled flights. The route selected for the test flights is Hamburg-Frankfurt-Hamburg and it will be covered by an Airbus 321 with the registration D-AIDG.&lt;ref&gt;

===JBUFF (Joint Battlespace Use Fuel of the Future) fuel===
Future blends and fuel formulations may result in a JBUFF (Joint Battlespace Use Fuel of the Future) or a single battlespace fuel that can be used in both diesel and jet fuel application.  A JBUFF fuel will allow for rapid deployment and logistic enhancement for military and emergency aid environments where various types of equipment can be operated with one fuel in place of several types of fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.trbav030.org/pdf2006/265_Harrison.pdf| title = DOD &amp; DOE Assured Fuels Initiative Slide 12 &amp; 13| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120302150828/http://www.trbav030.org/pdf2006/265_Harrison.pdf| archivedate = 2012-03-02| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://isfuel.com/index.html| title =Integrated Synthetic Fuel Incorporated Developing 100% Joint Synthetic Fuel }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[ISFuel]] Incorporated received a patent for the formulation of fully synthetic joint fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.google.com/patents/US20120101317| title =Patent application title: Formula for Joint Synthetic Jet, Rocket, And Diesel Fuel US 20120101317 A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Initial consumers===
In addition to their certification efforts, the United States Air Force has publicly stated their intention to fuel half of their domestic US flights with synthetic fuel by 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,340923,00.html| title = U.S. Air Force Plans Coal-to-Fuel Conversion Plant | accessdate = 2009-06-24 | work=Fox News | date=2008-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commercial aviation industry, working with potential suppliers via [[Commercial Aviation Alternative Fuels Initiative|CAAFI]], is also pushing hard to secure sources of fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.caafi.org/about/functionnfocus.html| title = Commercial Alternative Aviation Fuels Initiative, Function and Focus | accessdate = 2009-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of Energy]] projects that domestic consumption of synthetic fuel made from coal and natural gas will rise to {{convert|3.7|Moilbbl/d}} in 2030 based on a price of $57 per barrel of high sulfur crude.&lt;ref name=outlook2006/&gt;

===Non-transportation "synfuel"===
Numerous American companies ([[TECO Energy|TECO]], [[Progress Energy Inc|Progress Energy]], [[DTE Energy]], [[Marriott International|Marriott]]) have also taken advantage of coal-based synfuel tax credits established in the 1970s, although many of the products qualifying for the subsidy are not true synthetic fuels.&lt;ref name=time1&gt;{{Cite news|last = Barlett|first = Donald|last2 = Steele|first2 = James|title = The Great Energy Scam|magazine = [[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date =  2003-10-04|url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,493241,00.html|accessdate =2009-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The coal industry uses the credit to increase profits on coal-burning powerplants by introducing a "pre-treatment" process that satisfies the technical requirements, then burns the result the same as it would burn coal.  Sometimes the amount gained in the tax credit is a major factor in the economic operation of the plant.  The synfuel tax credit has been used primarily in this manner since the [[1980s oil glut|cheap gas prices of the 1980s]] stopped any major efforts to create a transportation fuel with the credit, and its continuation is seen as a major "pork project" win for coal industry lobbyists, costing $9 billion per annum.&lt;ref name=time1/&gt;&lt;ref name=time2&gt;{{Cite news|title = A Magic Way to Make Billions|magazine = [[Time (magazine)|Time]]|url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,493241,00.html|date =  2006-02-26|accessdate =2009-07-22|first1=Donald L.|last1=Barlett|first2=James B.|last2=Steele}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total production of such synfuels in the United States was an estimated 73&amp;nbsp;million tons in 2002.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

The synthetic fuel tax credit, Section 45K, under which these activities occurred, expired 31 December 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Headwaters INC. 10-K SEC filing |publisher=Yahoo!

'''''The Cave of the Storm Nymphs''''' is a painting by British artist [[Edward Poynter]], depicting three nude [[Siren (mythology)|sirens]] or [[nymphs]] from [[Greek mythology]] that lure sailors to their deaths. Poynter painted two versions, one in 1902 and the other in 1903, with minor differences. The former is housed in the [[Norfolk]]'s Hermitage Museum,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/travel/norfolks-hermitage-museum-home-to-an-impressive-art-collection/2014/01/09/17a35a7a-74a3-11e3-8def-a33011492df2_story.html |title=Norfolk’s Hermitage Museum, home to an impressive art collection|work=[[The Washington Post]]|author=James F.

In 1901, Poynter drew a preparatory study for the painting, housed in the [[National Gallery of Canada]].&lt;ref name="gallery"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.gallery.ca/en/see/collections/artwork.php?mkey=189485|title=Study of a Nymph for "The Cave of the Storm Nymphs", 1901|publisher=[[National Gallery of Canada]]| accessdate =13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study was donated to the National Gallery of Canada by Dennis T.

The '''Tropic of Capricorn''' (or the '''Southern Tropic''') is the [[circle of latitude]] that contains the [[subsolar point]] on the December (or southern) [[solstice]]. It is thus the southernmost latitude where the Sun can be directly overhead. Its northern equivalent is the [[Tropic of Cancer]].

The Tropic of Capricorn is one of the five major circles of latitude that mark [[map]]s of [[Earth]]. As of {{TODAY}}, its latitude is {{circle of latitude|tropical|convert}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neoprogrammics.com/obliquity_of_the_ecliptic/ ''obliquity of the ecliptic (Eps Mean)'']&lt;/ref&gt; south of the [[Equator]], but it is very gradually moving northward, currently at the rate of 0.47 [[arcseconds]], or 15 metres, per year.

== Name ==
When this line of latitude was named in the last centuries BC, the Sun was in the [[constellation]] [[Capricornus]] ([[Latin]] for ''goat horn'') at the [[December solstice]], the time each year that the Sun reaches its zenith at this latitude. Due to the [[axial precession|precession of the equinoxes]], this is no longer the case; today the Sun is in [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]] at the December solstice. The word "tropic" itself comes from the Greek "trope (τροπή)", meaning to turn or change direction, referring to the fact that the Sun appears to "turn back" at the solstices.

== Geography and environment ==
The Tropic of Capricorn is the dividing line between the [[temperate|Southern Temperate Zone]] to the south and the tropics to the north. The [[Northern Hemisphere]] equivalent of the Tropic of Capricorn is the [[Tropic of Cancer]].

The Tropic of Capricorn's position is not fixed, but constantly changes because of a slight wobble in the Earth's longitudinal alignment relative to its orbit around the Sun. Earth's [[axial tilt]] varies over a 41,000 year period from 22.1 to 24.5 degrees and currently resides at about 23.4 degrees. This wobble means that the Tropic of Capricorn is currently drifting northward at a rate of almost half an arcsecond (0.468″) of latitude, or 15 metres, per year (it was at exactly 23° 27′S in 1917 and will be at 23° 26'S in 2045). See under [[circle of latitude#Movement of the Tropical and Polar circles|circles of latitude]] for information.

There are approximately 13 hours, 35 minutes of daylight during the summer solstice. During the winter solstice, there are 10 hours, 41 minutes of daylight.

In [[Australia]], areas on the Tropic have some of the most variable [[rain]]fall in the world&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/1520-0442(1999)012%3C3457%3AGPOIRV%3E2.0.CO%3B2 Geographical Patterning of Interannual Rainfall Variability in the Tropics and Near Tropics]&lt;/ref&gt; and thus even the wetter areas cannot be generally [[Agriculture|farmed]], since irrigation sources invariably dry up in [[drought]] years. In [[southern Africa]], where rainfall is more reliable, farming is possible, though yields are low even with [[fertiliser]]s.

In [[South America]], whilst in the continental [[craton]]s soils are almost as old as in Australia and Southern Africa, the presence of the geologically young and evolving [[Andes]] means that this region is on the western side of the subtropical [[anticyclone]]s and thus receives warm and humid air from the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. As a result, areas in [[Brazil]] adjacent to the Tropic are extremely important agricultural regions, producing large quantities of crops such as [[sugarcane]], and the natural [[rainforest]] vegetation has been almost entirely cleared, except for a few remaining patches of [[Atlantic Forest]]. Further south in [[Argentina]], the temperate grasslands of the [[Pampas]] region is one of the most productive agricultural regions in the world, producing of [[wheat]], [[soybeans]], [[maize]], and [[beef]], making the country one of the largest worldwide agricultural exporters, similar to the role played by the [[Prairies]] region in [[Canada]].

West of the Andes, however, the [[Humboldt Current]] makes conditions extremely arid, creating the [[Atacama Desert]], one of the driest in the world, so that no [[glacier]]s exist between [[Volcán Sajama]] at 18˚30'S and [[Nevado Tres Cruces|Cerro Tres Cruces]] at [[27th parallel south|27˚S]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hal-sde.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/29/80/60/PDF/cp-3-1-2007.pdf Exposure dating of Late Glacial and pre-LGM moraines in the Cordon de Doña Rosa, Northern/Central Chile (~31&amp;deg;S)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vegetation]] here is almost non-existent, though on the eastern slopes of the Andes rainfall is adequate for rainfed agriculture.

Further south in the region of [[Patagonia]], shared between [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]], climate becomes colder, with heavy snowfall in the winter months and throughout the year. On the Western portion of Patagonia, climate is more humid, and dominated by [[fjords]], [[coniferous forests]] and [[lakes]] owing to the presence of thawing currents from the permafrost in the peaks of the [[Andes mountains]] which divide the region. This makes the region a popular destination for [[ski]] and [[winter sports]], particularly on the Argentine city of [[Bariloche]] and surrounding area. On the Eastern portion of Patagonia climate is generally cold and dry [[steppe]], with high mesas and strong wind conditions.

The southern tip of the island of [[Tierra del Fuego]] and other islands of the South Atlantic have [[Sub-Antarctic]] climate conditions.

== Around the world ==
Starting at the [[Prime Meridian]] and heading eastwards, the Tropic of Capricorn passes through 10 countries:

In [[Lakota mythology]], '''Untunktahe''' is a [[water]] spirit.

Due to his pride, he constantly challenges against [[Wakinyan|Waukheon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://winners.virtualclassroom.org/0924/nagods3.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

He is rumoured to be associated with the destructive serpent demon [[Unhcegila]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://winners.virtualclassroom.org/0924/nagods3.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harry Hammond Hess|Harry Hess]] proposed the sea-floor spreading hypothesis in 1960 (published in 1962 &lt;ref&gt;{{Hess, H. H. (November 1, 1962). "History of Ocean Basins" (PDF). In A. E. J. Engel; Harold L. James; B. F. Leonard. Petrologic studies: a volume in honor of A. F. Buddington. Boulder, CO: Geological Society of America. pp. 599–620.}}&lt;/ref&gt;); the term "spreading of the seafloor" was introduced by geophysicist [[Robert S. Dietz]] in 1961 &lt;ref&gt;{{Dietz, Robert S. (3 June 1961). "Continent and Ocean Basin Evolution by Spreading of the Sea Floor". Nature. 190 (4779): 854–857. Bibcode:1961Natur.190..854D. doi:10.1038/190854a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;. According to Hess, seafloor was created at [[Mid-ocean ridge|mid-oceanic ridges]] by the convection of the earth's mantle, pushing and spreading the older crust away from the ridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tiseda.sakura.ne.jp/works/Plate_tectonics.html |first=Tetsuji |last=Iseda |title=Philosophical Interpretations of the Plate Tectonics Revolution |accessdate=27 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geophysicist [[Fred Vine|Frederick John Vine]] and the Canadian geologist [[Lawrence Morley|Lawrence W. Morley]] independently realized that if Hess’s seafloor spreading theory was correct, then the rocks surrounding the mid-oceanic ridges should show symmetric patterns of magnetization reversals using newly collected magnetic surveys. Both of Morley's letters to ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' (February 1963) and ''[[Journal of Geophysical Research]]''  (April 1963) were rejected, hence Vine and his PhD adviser at Cambridge University, [[Drummond Hoyle Matthews]], were first to publish the theory in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geolsoc.org.uk/Plate-Tectonics/Chap1-Pioneers-of-Plate-Tectonics/Vine-and-Matthews |title= Frederick Vine and Drummond Matthews, Pioneers of Plate Tectonics | publisher= The Geological Society |accessdate=19 Mar 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some colleagues were skeptical of the hypothesis because of the numerous assumptions made—seafloor spreading, geomagnetic reversals, and [[Natural remanent magnetization|remnant magnetism]]—all hypotheses that were still not widely accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Frankel |first= Henry | title= The development, reception, and acceptance of the Vine-Matthews-Morley hypothesis.|journal= Historical Studies in the Physical Sciences Baltimore, Md |year=1982|volume=13.1|pages=1–39 |doi=10.2307/27757504}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vine-Matthews-Morley hypothesis describes the magnetic reversals of oceanic crust. Further evidence for this hypothesis came from Cox et al. (1967) when he measured the remnant magnetization of lavas from land sites.&lt;ref name="kearey"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kearey|first1=Philip|last2=Klepeis|first2=Keith A.|last3=Vine|first3=Frederick J.|title=Global tectonics|date=2009|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Chichester|isbn=9781444303223|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter C. Pitman, III|Walter C. Pitman]] offered further evidence with a remarkably symmetric profile from the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge.

==Geomagnetism==
The Vine-Matthews hypothesis correlates the symmetric magnetic patterns seen on the seafloor with [[Geomagnetic reversal|geomagnetic field reversals]]. At mid-ocean ridges, new crust is created by the injection, extrusion, and solidification of magma. After the magma has cooled through the [[Curie temperature|Curie point]], ferromagnetism becomes possible and the magnetic minerals in the newly formed crust orient themselves with the current background geomagnetic field.&lt;ref name="kearey" /&gt; Lithospheric creation at the ridge is considered continuous and symmetrical as the new crust pushes the old crust laterally and equally on either side of the ridge. Therefore, as geomagnetic reversal occur, the crust on either side of the ridge will contain a record of remnant magnetizations of normal or reversed magnetizations in comparison to the current geomagnetic field. The ridge crest is analogous to “twin-headed tape recorder”, recording the Earth’s magnetic history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Vine |first= F.J. |title= Spreading of the ocean floor: new evidence. |journal= Science |year=1966|volume=154|pages=1405–1415 |doi=10.1126/science.154.3755.1405 |pmid=17821553 |issue=3755|bibcode=1966Sci...154.1405V}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The intensity of the remnant magnetization is greater than the [[Magnetization|induced magnetization]]. The shape of the [[magnetic anomaly]] is controlled by the combination of the orientation of its total magnetization, the summation of the induced magnetization and remnant magnetization. Consequently, the shape of the magnetic anomaly is controlled predominately by the primary remnant vector. Blocks of crust at high latitudes have magnetic vectors that dip steeply downward in a normal magnetic field. However, close to the magnetic south pole, the magnetic vectors dip steeply downward in a reversed magnetic field and inclined steeply upwards in a normal magnetic field. There are positive magnetic anomalies over normally magnetized blocks and negative anomalies over reversed blocks.&lt;ref name="kearey" /&gt; Local anomalies with a short period also exist, but are considered to be correlated with [[bathymetry]].&lt;ref name="vinemat"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Vine |first= F. J |author2= Matthews, D. H.|title= Magnetic Anomalies Over Oceanic Ridges (PDF) |journal= Nature |year=1963|volume=199|issue=4897|pages=947–949|doi=10.1038/199947a0 |bibcode=1963Natur.199..947V}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In low latitudes, the vectors are shallowly dipping and dipolar. This confuses the positive and negative anomalies. At the magnetic equator, the magnetic field is horizontal; negative anomalies are related to normally magnetized blocks and positive anomalies with reversed. The amplitude of the anomaly, magnetic field strength, and the magnitude of the remanence all decrease from the poles to the equator.&lt;ref name="kearey" /&gt;

The orientation of the ridge affects the anomaly shape and amplitude. The component of the vector that effects the anomaly is at a maximum when the ridge is east-west and the magnetic profile is north-south. The anomalies are most apparent at high magnetic latitudes, north-south trending ridges at all latitudes, and east-west trending ridges at the magnetic equator.&lt;ref name="vinemat" /&gt;

A '''Wehnelt cylinder''' (also known as ''Wehnelt cap'', ''grid cap'' or simply ''Wehnelt'') is an [[electrode]] in the [[electron gun]] assembly of some [[thermionic emission|thermionic]] devices, used for focusing and control of the [[electron beam]]. It is named after [[Arthur Wehnelt|Arthur Rudolph Berthold Wehnelt]], a German physicist, who invented it during the years 1902 and 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first= Ambrose |last= Fleming |title= On the history and development of the thermionic valve |journal= Journal of Scientific Instruments |volume= 11 |issue= 2 |pages= 44 |year= 1934 |doi= 10.1088/0950-7671/11/2/303|bibcode = 1934JScI...11...44F }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wehnelt cylinders are found in the electron guns of [[cathode ray tube]]s and [[electron microscope]]s, and in other applications where a thin, well-focused electron beam is required.

==Structure==
A Wehnelt cap has the shape of a topless, hollow cylinder. The bottom side of the cylinder has an aperture (through hole) located at its center, with a diameter that typically ranges from 200 to 1200 µm. The bottom face of the cylinder is often made from platinum or tantalum foil.

==Operation==
A Wehnelt acts as a [[control grid]] and it also serves as a convergent [[electrostatic lens]]. An electron emitter is positioned directly above the Wehnelt aperture, and an anode is located below the Wehnelt. The anode is biased to a high positive voltage (typically +1 to +30 kV) relative to the emitter so as to accelerate electrons from the emitter towards the anode, thus creating an electron beam that passes through the Wehnelt aperture.

The Wehnelt is biased to a negative voltage (typically −200V to −300V) relative to the emitter, which is usually a [[tungsten]] filament or [[Lanthanum hexaboride]] (LaB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) [[hot cathode]] with a "V" shaped (or otherwise pointed) tip. This bias voltage creates a repulsive electrostatic field that suppresses emission of electrons from most areas of the cathode.

The emitter tip is positioned near the Wehnelt aperture so that, when appropriate bias voltage is applied to the Wehnelt, a small region of the tip has a net electric field (due to both anode attraction and Wehnelt repulsion) that allows emission from only that area of the tip. The Wehnelt bias voltage determines the tip's emission area, which in turn determines both the beam current and effective size of the beam's electron source.

As the Wehnelt bias voltage increases, the tip's emitting area (and along with it, the beam diameter and beam current) will decrease until it becomes so small that the beam is "pinched" off. In normal operation, the bias is typically set slightly more positive than the pinch bias, and determined by a balance between desired beam quality and beam current.

The Wehnelt bias controls beam focusing as well as the effective size of the electron source, which is essential for creating an electron beam that is to be focussed into a very small spot (for scanning electron microscopy) or a very parallel beam (for diffraction). Although a smaller source can be imaged to a smaller spot, or a more parallel beam, one obvious trade off is a smaller total beam current.
