The '''1984 Morgan Hill earthquake''' (also '''Halls Valley earthquake''')&lt;ref name=intl&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eps.berkeley.edu/~eps20/intensity/index2.php |title=The Morgan Hill Earthquake of 1984 |publisher=Earthquakes in Your Backyard – And Tsunamis |accessdate=2009-05-29 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5hDNIV486?url=http://eps.berkeley.edu/~eps20/intensity/index2.php |archivedate=2009-06-01 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; occurred on April 24 at {{tooltip|1:15 p.m. local time|21:15 UTC}} in the [[Santa Clara Valley]] of [[Northern California]]. The shock had a moment magnitude of 6.2 and a maximum [[Mercalli intensity scale|Mercalli intensity]] of VIII (''Severe''). The [[epicenter]] was located near [[Mount Hamilton (California)|Mount Hamilton]] in the [[Diablo Range]] of the [[California Coast Ranges]]. Nearby communities (including [[Morgan Hill, California|Morgan Hill]]) sustained serious damage with financial losses of at least [[United States dollar|US$]]7.5 million.

==Earthquake==
The earthquake occurred along the [[Calaveras Fault]], with the epicenter {{convert|16|km|mi|sp=us}} northeast of [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], and at a depth of {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}}. The shock was felt in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] in California's central valley.&lt;ref name=overview&gt;{{cite journal|last=Toppozada |first=T. R. |url=http://www.johnmartin.com/earthquakes/eqpapers/00000062.htm|title=Morgan Hill Earthquake of April 1984|journal=California Geology|date=1984|volume=37|number=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Damage===
The earthquake was reported to be felt over an area of {{convert|120000|km2|mi2|sp=us}}. [[Morgan Hill, California|Morgan Hill]] was the worst affected, with a number of mobile homes sliding off foundations, and moderate damage to several [[masonry]] buildings in the city. The communities of [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], [[San Martin, California|San Martin]] and [[Coyote, California|Coyote]] were some areas that experienced minor damage.&lt;ref name=intl/&gt; In [[Santa Clara County]], over 550 buildings were reported to have received at least minor damage.

===Aftershocks===
The outline of aftershocks show that the rupture propagated southeast over a {{convert|25|km|mi|abbr=on}} section of the fault, as far as [[San Martin, California|San Martin]], to the location of the [[1979 Coyote Lake earthquake]]'s mainshock. That event's aftershock zone also stretched to the southeast.&lt;ref name=overview/&gt;

The '''2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference''', commonly known as the '''Copenhagen Summit''', was held at the [[Bella Center]] in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]], between 7 and 18 December. The conference included the 15th Conference of the Parties (COP 15) to the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) and the 5th Meeting of the Parties (MOP 5) to the [[Kyoto Protocol]]. According to the [[Bali Road Map]], a framework for [[climate change mitigation]] beyond 2012 was to be agreed there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iisd.ca/upcoming/linkagesmeetings.asp?id=5 |title=IISD Reporting Services – Upcoming meetings |publisher=Iisd.ca |date= |accessdate=8 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Friday 18 December, the final day of the conference, international media reported that the climate talks were "in disarray".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Associated |first=The |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=120160589 |title=UN Chief: Time To Stop Climate Finger-Pointing |publisher=NPR |date=15 December 2009 |accessdate=19 December 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091119161524/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=120160589 |archivedate=19 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2009/12/obama_in_copenhagen_climate_ch.html |title=Obama in Copenhagen; Climate Talks in Disarray; Urges 'Action Over Inaction' – The Two-Way – Breaking News, Analysis Blog |publisher=NPR |date= |accessdate=19 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2009/12/18/copenhagen-last-day.html |title=CBC News – World – Canada part of Copenhagen climate deal |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=27 November 2009 |accessdate=19 December 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091219201902/http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2009/12/18/copenhagen-last-day.html |archivedate=19 December 2009 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Media also reported that in lieu of a summit collapse, only a "weak political statement" was anticipated at the conclusion of the conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/last-day-of-copenhagen-summit-hope-fizzling-out/107355-11.html |title=Last day of Copenhagen summit, hope fizzling out |publisher=Ibnlive.in.com |date= |accessdate=19 December 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091223014216/http://ibnlive.in.com/news/last-day-of-copenhagen-summit-hope-fizzling-out/107355-11.html |archivedate=23 December 2009 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lenore Taylor |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/climate-talks-set-for-failure-as-china-dampens-hopes/story-e6frg6nf-1225811570408 |title=Climate talks set for failure as China dampens hopes |publisher=The Australian |date= |accessdate=19 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Copenhagen Accord]] was drafted by the United States, China, [[India]], [[Brazil]] and South Africa on 18 December, and judged a "meaningful agreement" by the [[United States government]]. It was "taken note of", but not "adopted", in a debate of all the participating countries the next day, and it was not passed unanimously. The document recognised that climate change is one of the greatest challenges of the present day and that actions should be taken to keep any temperature increases to below 2&amp;nbsp;°C. The document is not legally binding and does not contain any legally binding commitments for reducing {{co2}} emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8422307.stm |title=Copenhagen deal: Key points |publisher=BBC News |date=19 December 2009 |accessdate=20 December 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812064950/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8422307.stm |archivedate=12 August 2017 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and lead-up==

The conference was preceded by the [[Climate Change: Global Risks, Challenges and Decisions]] scientific conference, which took place in March 2009 and was also held at the Bella Center. The negotiations began to take a new format when in May 2009 UN Secretary General [[Ban Ki-moon]] attended the World Business Summit on Climate Change in Copenhagen, organised by the [[Copenhagen Climate Council]] (COC), where he requested that COC councillors attend New York's Climate Week at the Summit on Climate Change on 22 September and engage with heads of government on the topic of the climate problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Tim Flannery |publisher=[[The Monthly]] |date=November 2009 |title=Copenhagen and Beyond: Conference Bound |url=http://www.themonthly.com.au/monthly-essays-tim-flannery-copenhagen-and-beyond-conference-bound-2110 |accessdate=8 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100506043909/http://www.themonthly.com.au/monthly-essays-tim-flannery-copenhagen-and-beyond-conference-bound-2110 |archivedate=6 May 2010 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Negotiating position of the European Union==

On 28 January 2009, the [[European Commission]] released a position paper, "Towards a comprehensive climate agreement in Copenhagen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/09/34&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en |title=Questions and Answers on the Communication Towards a comprehensive climate change agreement in Copenhagen |publisher=European Union |date=28 January 2009 |accessdate=14 February 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218075503/http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO%2F09%2F34&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en |archivedate=18 February 2010 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The position paper "addresses three key challenges: targets and actions; financing [of "low-carbon development and adaptation"]; and building an effective [[global carbon market]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/climat/pdf/future_action/communication.pdf |title=Towards a comprehensive climate agreement in Copenhagen |publisher=European Union| accessdate= 8 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leading by example, the European Union had committed to implementing binding legislation, even without a satisfactory deal in Copenhagen. Last December, the European Union revised its carbon allowances system called the [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme|Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS)]] designed for the post-Kyoto period (after 2013). This new stage of the system aims at further reducing greenhouse gases emitted in Europe in a binding way and at showing the commitments the EU had already done before the Copenhagen meeting. To avoid carbon leakage—relocation of companies in other regions not complying with similar legislation—the EU Commission will foresee that sectors exposed to international competition, should be granted some free allocations of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions provided that they are at least at the same level of a benchmark. Other sectors should buy such credits on an international market. Energy intensive industries in Europe have advocated for this benchmark system in order to keep funds in investment capacities for low carbon products rather than for speculations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=//www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1kf_axslfk |title=Jumping the climate change hurdle |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=9 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European chemical industry claims here the need to be closer to the needs of citizens in a sustainable way. To comply with such commitments for a [[low-carbon economy]], this requires competitiveness and innovations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=//www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpmXY0R7RLQ |title=Building Blocks for Climate Change Solutions |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=9 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French Minister for Ecology [[Jean-Louis Borloo]] pushes the creation of the [[Global Environment Organisation]] as France's main institutional contribution, to offer a powerful alternative to the [[United Nations Environment Programme|UNEP]].

==Official pre-Copenhagen negotiation meetings==

A draft negotiating text&lt;ref name="Text"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2009/awglca6/eng/08.pdf |format=PDF |title=Negotiating text |publisher=United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change |page=53 |language=English |accessdate=15 June 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611193811/http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2009/awglca6/eng/08.pdf |archivedate=11 June 2009 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Draft"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2009/awglca7/eng/inf02.pdf |format=PDF |title=Negotiating text |publisher=United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change |page=181 |language=English |accessdate=15 September 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007065138/http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2009/awglca7/eng/inf02.pdf |archivedate=7 October 2009 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; for finalisation at Copenhagen was publicly released. It was discussed at a series of meetings before Copenhagen.

===Bonn – second negotiating meeting===

Delegates from 183 countries met in [[Bonn]] from 1 to 12 June 2009. The purpose was to discuss key negotiating texts. These served as the basis for the international climate change agreement at Copenhagen. At the conclusion the Ad Hoc Working Group under the Kyoto Protocol ([[AWG-KP]]) negotiating group was still far away from the emission reduction range that has been set out by science to [[Avoiding dangerous climate change|avoid the worst ravages of climate change]]: a minus 25% to minus 40% reduction below 1990 levels by 2020. The AWG-KP still needs to decide on the aggregate emission reduction target for industrialised countries, along with individual targets for each country. Progress was made in gaining clarification of the issues of concern to parties and including these concerns in the updated draft of the negotiating text.&lt;ref name="Bonn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/files/press/news_room/press_releases_and_advisories/application/pdf/091206_closing_pr_sb30.pdf|format=PDF|title=Progress Made in Negotiations for Ambitious and Effective Copenhagen Deal at Bonn UNFCCC Meeting|date=12 June 2009|work=Press Release|publisher=UNFCCC/CCNUCC|page=2|accessdate=15 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seventh session===

====Bangkok====

The first part of the seventh session of the AWG-LCA was held in Bangkok, Thailand, from Monday, 28 September until 9 October, at the [[United Nations Conference Centre (Bangkok)|United Nations Conference Centre]] (UNCC) of the [[United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific]] (UNESCAP), [[Bangkok]], Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/meetings/intersessional/bangkok_09/items/4967.php |title=Bangkok Climate Change Talks – 2009 |publisher=United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change |accessdate=7 December 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091109222317/http://unfccc.int/meetings/intersessional/bangkok_09/items/4967.php |archivedate=9 November 2009 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Barcelona====

The resumed session was held in [[Barcelona, Spain]], from 2 to 6 November 2009. Thereafter, the AWG-LCA met to conclude its work at its eighth session, concurrently with the fifteenth session of the Conference of the Parties which opened in Copenhagen on 7 December 2009.

==== UNEP ====
At the fifth Magdeburg Environmental Forum held from 3 to 4 July 2008, in [[Magdeburg]], Germany, [[United Nations Environment Programme]] called for the establishment of infrastructure for [[electric vehicle]]s. At this international conference, 250 high-ranking representatives from industry, science, politics and non-government organizations discussed solutions for future road transportation under the motto of "Sustainable Mobility– United Nations Climate Change Conference 2009|the Post-2012 {{CO2}} Agenda".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://climate-l.org/2008/07/11/unep-and-daimler-call-for-infrastructure-for-electric-and-fuel-cell-vehicles/#more-1003 |title=UNEP and Daimler Call for Infrastructure for Electric and Fuel-cell Vehicles |publisher=Climate-L.org |date=4 July 2008 |accessdate=9 December 2009 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20091213000040/http://climate-l.org/2008/07/11/unep-and-daimler-call-for-infrastructure-for-electric-and-fuel-cell-vehicles/#more-1003 |archivedate=13 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Technology Action Programs====
Technology Action Programs (TAPs) have been proposed as a means for organizing future technology efforts under the UNFCCC. By creating programs for a set of adaptation and mitigation technologies, the UNFCCC would send clear signals to the private and finance sector, governments, research institutions as well as citizens of the world looking for solutions to the climate problem. Potential focus areas for TAPs include early warning systems, expansion of [[halophyte|salinity-tolerant]] crops, electric vehicles, wind and solar energy, efficient energy grid systems, and other technologies.&lt;ref&gt;http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2008/smsn/ngo/071.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology roadmaps will address barriers to technology transfer, cooperative actions on technologies and key economic sectors, and support implementation of Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs)&lt;ref&gt;http://unfccc.int/files/kyoto_protocol/application/pdf/india100209b.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/national_reports/napa/items/2719.php |title=National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs) |publisher=Unfccc.int |date= |accessdate=9 December 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091110012850/http://unfccc.int/national_reports/napa/items/2719.php |archivedate=10 November 2009 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Danish Text===
A leaked document known as "The Danish Text" has started an argument between developed and developing nations. The document was subtitled as "The Copenhagen Agreement" and proposes measures to keep average global temperature rises to two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. [[Developing countries]] reacted to the document by saying that the [[developed country|developed countries]] had worked behind closed doors and made an agreement according to their wish without the consent of the developing nations.

==="Tuvalu Protocol"===
{{main|Tuvalu and the United Nations}}
The Tuvaluan delegation, led by Ian Fry, played an active role in the Conference, attracting media attention. The country submitted a proposed protocol which would have imposed deeper, legally binding emissions cuts, including on developing nations. The proposal -dubbed by the media and by NGOs as the "Tuvalu Protocol"- was "immediately supported by other small island states, including [[Grenada]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and several African states", but opposed by countries including China, [[India]] and [[Saudi Arabia]]. The disagreement caused a suspension in negotiations, and prompted supportive campaign groups to "demonstrate[...] outside the meeting in favour of Tuvalu, chanting: 'Tuvalu is the new deal.'"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/dec/09/copenhagen-tuvalu-protocol-split "Copenhagen talks break down as developing nations split over 'Tuvalu' protocol"], ''The Guardian'', 9 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Milne"&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/unleashed/27620.html "Dispatches from Copenhagen"], Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 18 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/pacbeat/stories/200912/s2768166.htm "Tuvalu Copenhagen delegate angered"], ABC Radio Australia, 10 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Tuvalu's position was supported by, among others, [[East Timor]], the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Jamaica]] and [[Vanuatu]], and by Papua New Guinean chief negotiator [[Kevin Conrad]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solomontimes.com/news.aspx?nwID=4750 "David and Goliath Showdown at Copenhagen Talks – Tuvalu &amp; PNG Refuse to Bow Down"], ''Solomon Times'', 11 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Tuvalu and its representative Ian Fry "were the toast of the thousands of environmentalists at the conference, who held a noisy demonstration in support of the island state's position".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/climate/tuvalu-call-for-copenhagen-protocol-splits-developing-nation-bloc/story-e6frg6xf-1225808881276 "Tuvalu call for Copenhagen Protocol splits developing nation bloc"], ''The Australian'', 10 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8405051.stm "Copenhagen denies Tuvalu bid for tough climate controls"], British Broadcasting Corporation, 9 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In an article entitled "You caused it, you fix it: Tuvalu takes off the gloves", ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' noted that, by asking for a protocol that would legally bind developing countries, Tuvalu had "cracked a diplomatic axiom that has prevailed since the UN climate convention came into being in 1992: rich countries caused global warming, and it was their responsibility to fix it".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/environment/climate-change/you-caused-it-you-fix-it-tuvalu-takes-off-the-gloves-20091210-kksq.html "You caused it, you fix it: Tuvalu takes off the gloves"], ''The Sydney Morning Herald'', 10 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Economic Times]]'' in India noted that the Tuvaluan proposal had " take[n] centre stage", holding up proceedings for two consecutives days until it was rejected due to opposition from larger nations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2009-12-11/news/27657589_1_tuvalu-kyoto-protocol-connie-hedegaard "Copenhagen summit: Tuvalu holds up talks, proposal hangs fire"], ''Economic Times'', 11 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Australian Senator [[Christine Milne]] described Tuvalu as "the mouse that roared" at the Conference.&lt;ref name="Milne" /&gt; Fry refused to support the [[Copenhagen Accord|final agreement]] reached by the Conference, describing it as "[[30 pieces of silver]] to betray our future and our people",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/environment/copenhagen-chaos-as-talks-fail-20091219-l6r5.html "Copenhagen chaos as talks fail"], ''The Age'', 20 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; after delivering a final plea in a speech with tears in his eyes, concluding "The fate of my country rests in your hands".

===Indigenous rights===
Indigenous rights organization [[Survival International]] has raised concerns that some measures to mitigate the problem of climate change affect the survival of tribal people as much as climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2009/11/28/nation/5201442&amp;sec=nation |title=International NGO sees red over 'green projects' |publisher=Thestar.com.my |date=28 November 2009 |accessdate=19 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622022559/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2009%2F11%2F28%2Fnation%2F5201442&amp;sec=nation |archivedate=22 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Browne |first=Pete |url=http://greeninc.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/24/green-business-and-indigenous-rights/ |title=Green Business and Indigenous Rights – Green Inc.

[[Stephen Corry]], director of Survival International, explains that "projects that victimise the people and harm the environment cannot be promoted or marketed as green projects". Survival International calls attention to the fact that these people, who least contribute to the problem of climate change, are already the most affected by it; and that we must seek solutions that involve indigenous people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.survivalinternational.org/news/kits/climatechange |title=Media kits |publisher=Survival International |date= |accessdate=19 December 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091128080852/http://www.survivalinternational.org/news/kits/climatechange |archivedate=28 November 2009 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew E. Miller, human rights campaigner at [[Amazon Watch]], said, "Many indigenous peoples, understandably, are skeptical that the latest silver bullet is really in their interest. In fact, serious concerns have arisen that implementation of REDD [Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation] could counteract fundamental indigenous rights, in the same way that countless conservation schemes have limited local subsistence activities and led to displacement around the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huliq.com/1/89605/copenhagen-march-also-includes-indigenous-peoples-rights |title=Copenhagen March Also Includes Indigenous Peoples on Rights |publisher=HULIQ |date=12 December 2009 |accessdate=20 December 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091218070115/http://www.huliq.com/1/89605/copenhagen-march-also-includes-indigenous-peoples-rights |archivedate=18 December 2009 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar criticism came out of the [[climate justice]] network [[Climate Justice Now!]].

In March 2010, Executive Secretary, Estebancio Castro, of the International Alliance of Indigenous Tribal Peoples of the Tropical Forests suggested that "indigenous people need recognition of their rights at the local and national level, to be reflected in the negotiating process."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.climate-change.tv/estebancio-castro-diaz-march-2010|title=Civil Society post Copenhagen |date=5 April 2010|publisher=Climate-Change.TV News|accessdate=5 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Negotiating problems===
On 16 December, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that the summit in Copenhagen was in jeopardy. "We have made no progress" said a source close to the talks. "What people don't realise is that we are now not really ready for the leaders. These talks are now 17 hours late." Negotiators were openly talking of the best possible outcome being a "weak political agreement that would leave no clear way forward to tackle rising greenhouse gas emissions". This would mean that negotiations would continue into 2010 increasing the damage done by emissions.&lt;ref name="guard16"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/dec/16/copenhagen-summit-miliband-farce-warning |title=Copenhagen summit veering towards farce, warns Ed Miliband |last=Vidal |first=John |author2=Allegra Stratton |date=16 December 2009 |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=18 December 2009 |location=London |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106051023/http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/dec/16/copenhagen-summit-miliband-farce-warning |archivedate=6 January 2010 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 December, the head of the [[United Nations Environmental Program]] told the BBC that "the summit as of this morning is a summit in crisis" and that only the arrival of heads of state could bring the summit to a successful conclusion. Head of climate change for [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] in Britain, said that the proposals made so far, especially those from industrialised countries "all far short of what the world needs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8420016.stm|title=Copenhagen summit final day overshadowed by uncertainty |date=18 December 2009|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=18 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hopenhagen===
[[Hopenhagen]] is a climate change campaign organized by the United Nations and the [[International Advertising Association]] to support [[COP15]], – the United Nations Climate Change Conference 2009.
The creative council was chaired by [[Bob Isherwood]] and the ad agencies that created the campaign included [[Ogilvy &amp; Mather]], [[Euro RSCG]], [[McCann Worldgroup]], [[Draftfcb]], [[Saatchi &amp; Saatchi]], [[Interbrand]], [[Tribal DDB]] and [[Digitas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

==Outcome==
{{wikisource|Copenhagen Accord}}
{{See also|Copenhagen Accord}}
On 18 December after a day of frantic negotiations between heads of state, it was announced that a "meaningful agreement" had been reached between on one hand the United States and on the other, in a united position as the [[BASIC countries]] (China, South Africa, [[India]], and [[Brazil]]).&lt;ref name="BBC_keypowers"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8421935.stm |title=Key powers reach compromise at climate summit |newspaper=BBC News |accessdate=3 February 2010 |date=19 December 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100207001548/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8421935.stm |archivedate=7 February 2010 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; An unnamed US government official was reported as saying that the deal was a "historic step forward" but was not enough to [[Avoiding dangerous climate change|prevent dangerous climate change]] in the future. However, the BBC's environment correspondent said: "While the White House was announcing the agreement, many other – perhaps most other – delegations had not even seen it. A comment from a UK official suggested the text was not yet final and the Bolivian delegation has already complained about the way it was reached – 'anti-democratic, anti-transparent and unacceptable'{{Citation needed|date = March 2016}}. With no firm target for limiting the global temperature rise, no commitment to a legal treaty and no target year for peaking emissions, countries most vulnerable to climate impacts have not got the deal they wanted."&lt;ref name="BBC_keypowers"/&gt; The use of "meaningful" in the announcement was viewed as being [[spin (public relations)|political spin]] by an editorial in ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/dec/19/copenhagen-climate-change-conference-obama |title=Copenhagen climate conference: The grim meaning of 'meaningful' |date=9 December 2009 |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=9 December 2009 |location=London |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091220184613/http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/dec/19/copenhagen-climate-change-conference-obama |archivedate=20 December 2009 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early on Saturday 19 December, delegates approved a motion to "take note of the [[Copenhagen Accord]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2009/cop15/eng/l07.pdf |title=UNFCCC: Text of Copenhagen Accord |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=8 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324025757/http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2009/cop15/eng/l07.pdf |archivedate=24 March 2010 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; of December 18, 2009". This was due to the opposition of countries such as [[Bolivia]], [[Venezuela]], [[Sudan]] and [[Tuvalu]] who registered their opposition to both the targets and process by which the Copenhagen Accord was reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tni.org/article/bolivia-provides-resistance-and-hope-brokenhagen |title=Transnational Institute: Bolivia provides resistance and hope at Brokenhagen |last=Buxton |first=Nick |date=8 January 2010 |accessdate=8 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325141623/http://www.tni.org/article/bolivia-provides-resistance-and-hope-brokenhagen |archivedate=25 March 2010 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon welcomed the US-backed climate deal as an "essential beginning" however debate has remained as to the exact legal nature of the Accord.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southcentre.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1236&amp;Itemid=287 |title=Comments on the Copenhagen Accord: Contents and Legal Aspects |publisher=South Centre |date= |accessdate=8 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Copenhagen Accord recognises the scientific case for keeping temperature rises below 2&amp;nbsp;°C, but does not contain a baseline for this target, nor commitments for reduced emissions that would be necessary to achieve the target. One part of the agreement pledges US$30&amp;nbsp;billion to the developing world over the next three years, rising to US$100&amp;nbsp;billion per year by 2020, to help poor countries adapt to climate change. Earlier proposals, that would have aimed to limit temperature rises to 1.5&amp;nbsp;°C and cut {{co2}} emissions by 80% by 2050 were dropped. The Accord also favors developed countries' paying developing countries to reduce emissions from [[deforestation]] and degradation, known as "REDD".&lt;ref name=jonesday&gt;{{cite web  | last =  Papanicolaou     | first = Chris  | authorlink =  |author2= Lauren Fendick  | title = Copenhagen summit fails to produce new global climate change treaty  | work =   | publisher = [[Jones Day]]  | date = 25 January 2010| url = http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=456748b1-18cc-47c9-a3c7-71004b1f0f69  | accessdate = 7 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian1912&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/dec/18/copenhagen-deal |title=Low targets, goals dropped: Copenhagen ends in failure |last=Vidal |first=John |author2=Allegra Stratton |author3=Suzanne Goldenberg |date=19 December 2009 |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=19 December 2009 |location=London |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091220184633/http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/dec/18/copenhagen-deal |archivedate=20 December 2009 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement made was non-binding but US President Obama said that countries could show the world their achievements.

===Governments===
US President [[Barack Obama]] said that the agreement would need to be built on in the future and that "We've come a long way but we have much further to go."&lt;ref name="bbcquotes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8421910.stm|title=Copenhagen deal reaction in quotes |date=19 December 2009|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=19 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gregg Easterbrook noted that Obama's speech was exactly what George H W Bush had said after the 1992 Rio Earth Summit. However, there had been no progress in regulating greenhouse gases since 1992.&lt;ref name='ebrook'&gt;{{cite web

Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] of Great Britain said "We have made a start" but that the agreement needed to become legally binding quickly.&lt;ref name="bbcquotes" /&gt; He accused a small number of nations of holding the Copenhagen talks to ransom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Copenhagen climate summit held to ransom – Gordon Brown|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/8423831.stm|publisher=BBC|date=21 December 2009| accessdate= 8 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; EU Commission President [[Jose Manuel Barroso]] said "I will not hide my disappointment regarding the non-binding nature of the agreement here."&lt;ref name="BBC_keypowers"/&gt; French President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] commented "The text we have is not perfect" however "If we had no deal, that would mean that two countries as important as India and China would be freed from any type of contract."&lt;ref name="BBC_keypowers"/&gt;

The head of China's delegation said that "The meeting has had a positive result, everyone should be happy."&lt;ref name="bbcquotes" /&gt; [[Wen Jiabao]], China's prime minister said that the weak agreement was because of distrust between nations: "To meet the climate change challenge, the international community must strengthen confidence, build consensus, make vigorous efforts and enhance co-operation."&lt;ref name="richpoor"/&gt; India's environment minister, [[Jairam Ramesh]], has been reported as saying, "We can be satisfied that we were able to get our way" and that India had "come out quite well in Copenhagen".&lt;ref name="Sally Sara"&gt;{{Citation|title=India, China cooperated to torpedo climate deal |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/12/23/2779003.htm |author=Sally Sara |date=23 December 2009 |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=8 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317031014/http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/12/23/2779003.htm |archivedate=17 March 2010 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazil's climate change ambassador called the agreement "disappointing". The head of the [[Group of 77|G77]] group of countries, which actually represents 130 nations, said that the draft text asked African countries to sign a "suicide pact" and that it would "maintain the economic dominance of a few countries".&lt;ref name="Tina Gerhardt"&gt;{{Citation|title=Race Against Time|url=http://www.indypendent.org/2010/02/18/race-against-time|author=Tina Gerhardt|date=19 February 2010|publisher=The Indypendent| accessdate= 19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The values the solution was based on were "the very same values in our opinion that funnelled six million people in Europe into furnaces".

==Analysis and aftermath==
Despite widely held expectations that the Copenhagen summit would produce a legally binding treaty, the conference was plagued by negotiating deadlock and the resulting "Copenhagen Accord" which is not legally enforceable. BBC environment analyst [[Roger Harrabin]] attributed the failure of the summit to live up to expectations to a number of factors including the recent [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010|global recession]] and conservative domestic pressure in the US and China.&lt;ref name="Harrabin"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8423822.stm|title=Harrabin's Notes: After Copenhagen|publisher=BBC | date=21 December 2009| accessdate=26 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregg Easterbrook described the Copenhagen Accord as "vague, nonbinding comments about how other people should use less fossil fuel". According to Easterbrook, international climate change negotiations are "complex, expensive and goin' nowhere" and are prone to creating the appearance of action while distracting attention from the lack of real change.&lt;ref name='ebrook'/&gt;

In the week following the end of the Copenhagen summit, carbon prices in the EU dropped to a six-month low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8425293.stm

The Copenhagen Accord asked countries to submit emissions targets by the end of January 2010, and paves the way for further discussions to occur at the [[2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference|2010 UN climate change conference]] in Mexico and the mid-year session in [[Bonn]]. By early February, 67 countries had registered their targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/home/items/5262.php |title=UNFCCC: Information provided by Parties to the Convention relating to the Copenhagen Accord |publisher=Unfccc.int |date= |accessdate=8 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429214220/http://unfccc.int/home/items/5262.php |archivedate=29 April 2010 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Countries such as India and Association of Island States made clear that they believed that Copenhagen Accord could not replace negotiations within the UNFCCC.&lt;ref&gt;Autri Saha &amp; Karan Talwar, [http://www.nujslawreview.org/pdf/articles/2010_2/autri-saha-and-karan-talwar.pdf "INDIA’S RESPONSE TO CLIMATE CHANGE:THE 2009 COPENHAGEN SUMMIT ANDBEYOND"]{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''NUJS LAW REVIEW'', January 2, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southcentre.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1233&amp;Itemid=287 |title=After Copenhagen, the Way Forward |publisher=South Centre |date= |accessdate=8 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other commentators consider that "the future of the UN's role in international climate deals is now in doubt."&lt;ref name="Harrabin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.abc.net.au/unleashed/stories/s2777595.htm|title=History's long shadow|date=21 December 2009|author=Clive Hamilton|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]| accessdate= 8 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Failure blamed on developed countries===
[[George Monbiot]] blamed the failure of the conference to achieve a binding deal on the United States Senate and [[Barack Obama]]. By negotiating the Copenhagen Accord with only a select group of nations, most of the UN member states were excluded. If poorer nations did not sign the Accord then they would be unable to access funds from richer nations to help them adapt to climate change. He noted how the British and American governments have both blamed China for the failure of the talks but said that Obama placed China in "an impossible position" – "He demanded concessions while offering nothing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/dec/21/copenhagen-failure-us-senate-vested-interests|title=If you want to know who's to blame for Copenhagen, look to the US Senate|last=Monbiot|first=George|date=21 December 2009|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=22 December 2009| location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Khor]] blamed Denmark for convening a meeting of only 26 nations in the final two days of the conference. He says that it undermined the UN's multilateral and democratic process of climate negotiations. It was in these meetings that China vetoed long-term emission-reduction goals for global emissions to decrease by 50%, and developed countries emissions to fall by 80% by 2050 compared to 1990. Khor states that this is when other countries began to blame the failures on China. If China had accepted this, by 2050 their emissions per capita would have had to be around one half to one fifth per capita of those of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cif-green/2009/dec/28/copenhagen-denmark-china |title=Blame Denmark, not China, for Copenhagen failure |last=Khor |first=Martin |date=28 December 2009 |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=28 December 2009 |location=London |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091231005758/http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cif-green/2009/dec/28/copenhagen-denmark-china |archivedate=31 December 2009 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Kishore Mahbubani]], President Obama interrupted a negotiating session to which he had not been invited and began yelling at members of the Chinese delegation, including [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]] [[Wen Jiabao]], eliciting an angry response from [[Xie Zhenhua (politician)|Xie Zhenhua]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Kishore Mahbubani|Mahbubani, Kishore]].

: "...the NGO movement is ten years out of date. They’re still arguing for ‘climate justice’, whatever that means, which is interpreted by the big developing countries like India and China as a right to pollute up to Western levels. To me carbon equity is the logic of mutually assured destruction. I think NGOs are far too soft on the Chinese, given that it’s the world’s biggest polluter, and is the single most important factor in deciding when global emissions will peak, which in turn is the single most important factor in the eventual temperature outcome...

:"I think the bottom line for China (and India) is growth, and given that this growth is mainly based on coal, there is going to have to be much more pressure on China if global emissions are to peak within any reasonable time frame. In Beijing the interests of the Party come first, second and third, and global warming is somewhere further down the list. Growth delivers stability and prosperity, and keeps the party in power."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Views on China's Role in the Greenhouse |author=Andrew Revkin |url=http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/23/views-on-china-and-copenhagen/ |website=The New York Times |date=23 December 2009 |accessdate=8 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100226161110/http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/23/views-on-china-and-copenhagen/ |archivedate=26 February 2010 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The editorial of ''[[The Australian]]'' newspaper, blamed African countries for turning Copenhagen into "a platform for demands that the world improve the continent's standard of living" and claimed that "Copenhagen was about old-fashioned anti-Americanism, not the environment".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/opinion/new-approach-on-global-warming-needed-now/story-e6frg71x-1225812242549|title=New approach on global warming needed now|date=21 December 2009|publisher=The Australian| accessdate= 8 April 2010}} (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian journalist [[Praful Bidwai]] puts the blame on both developed and a few developing countries such as India, arguing that the "Copenhagen Accord is an illegitimate, ill-conceived, collusive deal between a handful of countries that are some of the world's greatest present and future emitters."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Praful |last=Bidwai |date=12 January 2010|title=Fouling up the Air|url=http://www.tni.org/article/fouling-air |publisher=The Transnational Institute | accessdate= 8 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that India's policy is driven by elites determined to maintain high-consumer lifestyles which will have devastating effects for the vast majority of India's poor.

Müller is a programme director at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. In his view, the failure to get a better result at Copenhagen was due to a lack of political will in the months preceding the conference.

[[Walter Russell Mead]]{{clarify|date=June 2011|reason=what academic field is he in?}} argues that the conference failed because environmentalists have changed from "Bambi to Godzilla."  According to Mead, environmentalist used to represent the skeptical few who made valid arguments against big government programs which tried to impose simple but massive solutions on complex situations.  Environmentalists' more recent advocacy for big economic and social intervention against global warming, according to Mead, has made them, "the voice of the establishment, of the tenured, of the technocrats" and thus has lost them the support of a public which is increasingly skeptical of global warming.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Will|Will, George]], "[http://www.denverpost.com/opinion/ci_15978060 When Bambi becomes Godzilla]", ''[[The Denver Post]]'', 5 September 2010. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100909234738/http://www.denverpost.com/opinion/ci_15978060 |date=9 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emissions reductions===
{{Main|Copenhagen Accord#Effect on emissions}}

A preliminary assessment published in November 2010 by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) suggests a possible "emissions gap" between the voluntary pledges made in the Copenhagen Accord and the emissions cuts necessary to have a "likely" (greater than 66% probability) chance of meeting the 2&amp;nbsp;°C objective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The UNEP assessment takes the 2&amp;nbsp;°C objective as being measured against the pre-industrial global mean temperature level. To having a likely chance of meeting the 2&amp;nbsp;°C objective, assessed studies generally indicated the need for global emissions to peak before 2020, with substantial declines in emissions thereafter.

==US government spying==
{{Main |Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)#2014#January}}
In January 2014, it was revealed that the US government negotiators were in receipt of information during the conference that was being obtained by eavesdropping on meetings and other subterfuge against other conference delegations. Documents leaked by [[Edward Snowden]], and published by the Danish newspaper [[Dagbladet Information]], showed how the US [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) had monitored communications between countries before and during the conference, in order to provide the US negotiators with advance information about the positions of other parties at the conference.&lt;ref name=Vidal2014&gt;{{cite news|last=Vidal|first=John|title=Snowden revelations of NSA spying on Copenhagen climate talks spark anger|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jan/30/snowden-nsa-spying-copenhagen-climate-talks|accessdate=30 January 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=30 January 2014|author2=Suzanne Goldenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Geist/Moltke/Gjerding/Poitras2014"&gt;{{cite news|last=Poitras|first=Laura|title=For the NSA, espionage was a means to strengthen the US position in climate negotiations|url=http://www.information.dk/486360|accessdate=2 February 2014|newspaper=Dagbladet Information|date=30 January 2014|author2=Anton Geist|author3=Sebastian Gjerding|author4=Henrik Moltke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Representatives of other nations involved have reacted angrily. The leaked documents show that the NSA provided US delegates with advance details of the Danish plan to "rescue" the talks should they founder, and also about China's efforts before the conference to coordinate its position with that of India. Members of the Danish negotiating team said that the US delegation was "peculiarly well-informed" about closed-door discussions that had taken place. "They simply sat back, just as we had feared they would if they knew about our document,"&lt;ref name=Vidal2014/&gt;
&lt;ref name="Geist/Moltke/Gjerding/Poitras2014"/&gt;

"The UN climate talks are supposed to be about building trust – that's been under threat for years because of the US backward position on climate action – these revelations will only crack that trust further," said Meena Raman, of [[Third World Network]]. "Fighting climate change is a global struggle, and these revelations clearly show that the US government is more interested in crassly protecting a few vested interests," said Brandon Wu of [[ActionAid]]. [[Bill McKibben]], founder of [[350.org]], called the spying by the US "insane and disgusting".&lt;ref name=Vidal2014/&gt;

The '''Apalachin meeting''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|p|ə|ˈ|l|eɪ|k|ɪ|n}} {{respell|AP|ə|LAY|kin}}) was a historic [[summit (meeting)|summit]] of the [[American Mafia]] held at the home of mobster [[Joseph Barbara (mobster)|Joseph "Joe the Barber" Barbara]], in [[Apalachin, New York]], on November 14, 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| pages = 1| last1 = Fitchette| first1 = Woodie| first2 = Steve| last2 = Hambalek| title = Top U.S. Hoods Are Run Out of Area After 'Sick Call' on Barbara| work = Binghamton Press| location = Binghamton, NY| date = 1957-11-15| url = http://fultonhistory.com/Newspaper4/Binghamton%20NY%20Press%20Grayscale/Binghamton%20NY%20Press%20Grayscale%201957.pdf/Binghamton%20NY%20Press%20Grayscale%201957%20a%20-%204247.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| pages = 8| last1 = Fitchette| first1 = Woodie|  first2 = Steve| last2 = Hambalek| title = Hoods Run Out of Area--| work = Binghamton Press| location = Binghamton, NY| date = 1957-11-15| url = http://fultonhistory.com/Newspaper4/Binghamton%20NY%20Press%20Grayscale/Binghamton%20NY%20Press%20Grayscale%201957.pdf/Binghamton%20NY%20Press%20Grayscale%201957%20a%20-%204258.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| pages = 3| last1 = Fitchette| first1 = Woodie|  first2 = Steve| last2 = Hambalek| title = Barbara’s Life and Business Record| work = Binghamton Press| location = Binghamton, NY| date = 1957-11-15| url = http://fultonhistory.com/Newspaper4/Binghamton%20NY%20Press%20Grayscale/Binghamton%20NY%20Press%20Grayscale%201957.pdf/Binghamton%20NY%20Press%20Grayscale%201957%20a%20-%204249.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| pages = 29| last1 = Fitchette| first1 = Woodie|  first2 = Steve| last2 = Hambalek| title = Barbara--| work = Binghamton Press| location = Binghamton, NY| date = 1957-11-15| url = http://fultonhistory.com/Newspaper4/Binghamton%20NY%20Press%20Grayscale/Binghamton%20NY%20Press%20Grayscale%201957.pdf/Binghamton%20NY%20Press%20Grayscale%201957%20a%20-%204286.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title =Crime Inquiry Still Checking on Apalachin Meeting| newspaper =Toledo Blade| location =| pages =two| publisher =Associated Press| date =2 July 1958| url =https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DjoxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3gAEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7133,3946334&amp;dq=apalachin+meeting&amp;hl=en| accessdate =27 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title =Apalachin Meeting Ruled Against Gang Killing Of Tough, Probe Told| newspaper =Schenectady Gazette| pages =1, 3| publisher =Associated Press| date =February 13, 1959| url =https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=pI5GAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=cekMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3749,1668608&amp;dq=apalachin+meeting&amp;hl=en| accessdate =27 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allegedly, the meeting was held to discuss various topics including loansharking, narcotics trafficking, and gambling, along with dividing the illegal operations controlled by the late [[Albert Anastasia]].&lt;ref name=5th&gt;{{cite news| title =Ex-Union Officers Take 5th On Mafia, Apalchin Meeting| newspaper =Meriden Record| location =| pages =1| publisher =Associated Press| date =July 2, 1958| url =https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vu1HAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5P8MAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6249,99836&amp;dq=apalachin+meeting&amp;hl=en| accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ralph/&gt; An estimated 100 [[Mafiosi]] from the United States, Italy, and Cuba are thought to have attended this meeting.&lt;ref name=Ralph/&gt; [[Vito Genovese]], then head of the renamed [[Genovese crime family|Genovese family]], initially called the meeting as a way to recognize his new power as ''[[Capo di tutti capi|capo dei capi]]''.

Local and state law enforcement became suspicious when numerous expensive cars bearing license plates from around the country arrived in what was described as “the sleepy hamlet of Apalachin”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title ='Crime Meeting' Conspiracy Convictions Upset By Court| newspaper =Lodi News-Sentinel| location =| pages =2| publisher =UPI

==Events leading up to the Apalachin Meeting==

===Vito Genovese's rise to power===
{{Main article|Vito Genovese}}
Boss [[Vito Genovese]], who had fled from the United States to Italy to avoid a 1937 murder indictment, was living in [[Naples]] at the end of [[World War II]] when he was arrested and returned to the United States in 1946 to face trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brought back from Italy|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bDMdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=JyMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1540,1583367&amp;dq=vito+genovese&amp;hl=en|accessdate=28 May 2012|newspaper=The Milwaukee Journal|date=June 4, 1945}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Genovese was released from jail after the only witness to the murder, [[Peter LaTempa]], was murdered in his jail cell while awaiting the trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mobs' Operation Highly Organized Work In Concert With Both Labor, Management|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=o8kVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=BxAEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7292,1621854&amp;dq=peter+latempa&amp;hl=en|accessdate=28 May 2012|newspaper=The Milwaukee Sentinel|date=February 14, 1959}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After his release, Genovese began competing with [[Frank Costello|Frank "The Prime Minister" Costello]] for control over the biggest and most powerful underworld crime family, the [[Genovese crime family|Luciano family]] of New York. Once Genovese obtained control of the Luciano family, his intentions were to take control of [[The Commission (mafia)|The Commission]] and the Mafia, but to accomplish this he had to remove the long-established "Conservative Faction," or old guard Mafia, which controlled the Commission.&lt;ref name=Kelly&gt;{{cite news|last=Kelly|first=G. Milton|title=Valachi To Tell Of Gang War For Power|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=U0tfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=rlQNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5954,3500619&amp;dq=the+commission+vito+genovese&amp;hl=en|accessdate=28 May 2012|newspaper=Warsaw Times-Union|date=October 1, 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commission's "Conservative Faction" of bosses Bonanno, Profaci, Mangano, Gagliano and Magaddino had exerted a major influence over [[American Mafia|Cosa Nostra]]'s politics, policies and rules since the Commission's formation in 1931 and had dominated since the 1936 imprisonment of boss [[Lucky Luciano|Charles "Lucky" Luciano]].&lt;ref name=rise&gt;{{cite news|last=McShane|first=Larry|title=The rise and fall of an American crime family|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HstIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8QENAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3187,275917&amp;dq=stefano+magaddino+apalachin+meeting&amp;hl=en|accessdate=28 May 2012|newspaper=Record-Journal|date=September 2, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1951, the New York underworld and the Commission were experiencing a change in the Mafia that caused the formation of factions and infighting amongst the bosses. By 1957, the new "Liberal Faction" had gained enough power and influence to rival the old Mafia power structure and had attempted to gain control of the Commission and Cosa Nostra.

At the head of this new faction were Boss Genovese and allies [[Tommy Lucchese|Gaetano Lucchese]] and [[Carlo Gambino]]. The events and conflicts perpetrated by Genovese and his allies from 1951 through 1957, such as the assassination of five New York mafia bosses, were designed to bring about changes in the hierarchy of the New York underworld and the Commission, but by 1957 these changes were leading to a war within Cosa Nostra. Genovese, who now controlled the most powerful family in Cosa Nostra, called for a national meeting of bosses. Genovese elected [[Buffalo, New York]] boss and Commission member, [[Stefano Magaddino|Stefano "The Undertaker" Magaddino]], who in turn chose northeastern Pennsylvania crime boss Joseph Barbara and his underboss [[Russell Bufalino]] to oversee all the arrangements.&lt;ref name=Niagara&gt;{{cite news|last=Glynn|first=Don|title=Glynn:Area delegates attended mob convention|url=http://niagara-gazette.com/opinion/x681291359/GLYNN-Area-delegates-attended-mob-convention|accessdate=28 May 2012|newspaper=Niagara Gazette|date=November 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New York and The Commission===
[[The Commission (mafia)|The Commission]]'s "Conservative Faction" began its decline and loss of power in La Cosa Nostra with the 1951 alliance of Bosses [[Frank Costello]], [[Albert Anastasia]] and [[Anthony Accardo]]. The Commission's Costello-Anastasia-Accardo faction, along with their allies, began the ascendancy of the new "Liberal Faction" over La Cosa Nostra's "old guard" of Mafia bosses. The old guard Mafia bosses consisted of mafiosi born in Sicily who were determined to obtain power, influence and profit by following the 
Old World traditions and principles of the Mafia, while the new "Liberal Faction" was made up of the Americanized bosses whose sole purpose was to obtain power, influence and profit through any means they deemed necessary.

The new "Liberal Faction" began its rise to power with the 1951 disappearance of boss and "Conservative Faction" member [[Vincent Mangano]], and the assassination of his "Substituto" consigliere and brother, [[Philip Mangano]], which placed underboss Anastasia at the head of the family and gave him a Commission seat. Nick Parise was named underboss to replace Anastasia. Also in 1951, mobster Vito Genovese began his plan to overthrow Frank Costello and take control of the Luciano Family when he started campaigning to have Luciano Family underboss and Costello ally [[Willie Moretti|Quarico "Willie Moore" Moretti]] eliminated, due to his advanced case of [[syphilis]] and his conversations concerning La Cosa Nostra affairs. Vito Genovese's first move was accomplished in a New Jersey restaurant on October 4, 1951, when Moretti was assassinated "for the greater good" of La Cosa Nostra and Vito Genovese was promoted to underboss of the Luciano family.

===The cold war escalates===
The 1951 assassinations of the Mangano brothers and Moretti, along with Anastasia's elevation to boss of the second-largest crime family in the United States, elevated the "cold war" in the New York underworld and the Commission to a new level.&lt;ref name=Bonanno&gt;{{cite news|last=Bonanno|first=Joseph|author2=Sergio Lalli|title='Big Barbecue'  put Joe Bonanno in the public eye|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=M10_AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=S1MMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=925,2669633&amp;dq=magaddino+apalachin+meeting+assassination&amp;hl=en|accessdate=1 June 2012|newspaper=The Windsor Star|date=July 14, 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After these events, the New York underworld split even further, with the most powerful bosses and mafiosi lining up against one another. With the loss of ally Moretti, Frank Costello and Albert Anastasia lined up against the bloc of [[Vito Genovese]], [[Tommy Lucchese]] and their ally Carlo Gambino.

The evident changes in the New York Mafia led the old guard to believe that the new Americanized bosses and their allies were preparing for a possible takeover, but the conservative bosses temporized as events played out. One of these events was the 1953 death of "Conservative Faction" and Commission member, [[Tommy Gagliano|Tommaso Gagliano]], leaving his successor, [[Gaetano Lucchese|Gaetano "Tommy Brown" Lucchese]], as the new family boss and Commission member.

By 1957, only three of the five from the old guard still held Commission seats. The "Conservative Faction" of Bonanno-Profaci-Magaddino was losing power and influence to the "Liberal Faction" and knowing this, "Conservative Faction" member Magaddino secretly sided with the "Liberal Faction" against former allies [[Joseph Bonanno]] and [[Joseph Profaci|Joseph "The Old Man" Profaci]].

Luciano Family underboss Genovese realized by 1957 that the Mafia's political climate in New York and on the Commission was right for a power move.&lt;ref name=Fights&gt;{{cite news|last=McHugh|first=Ray|title=Federal Attack, Internal Fights Trouble Crime Clan|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cjozAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ozIHAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6806,4852987&amp;dq=magaddino+blame+apalachin+meeting&amp;hl=en|accessdate=1 June 2012|newspaper=Lodi News-Sentinel|date=August 26, 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Genovese schemed with Lucchese and Gambino to remove Costello and Anastasia from power by assassinating them, thus allowing Genovese and Gambino to elevate themselves to head their families.

===Genovese's final try for power===
Vito Genovese's final move for domination of La Cosa Nostra came in 1957 with the removal of three of New York's most powerful Mafia bosses. On May 2, Genovese gunman and protégé, [[Vincent Gigante|Vincent "Chin" Gigante]] tried to kill Luciano Family boss Frank Costello in the lobby of his Manhattan apartment building but failed, leaving Costello with only a minor head wound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Just Nicked Gambler Frank Costello Shot Entering Apartment|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RPUxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=JOMFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7239,651803&amp;dq=frank+costello&amp;hl=en|accessdate=28 May 2012|newspaper=Ottawa Citizen|date=May 3, 1957}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=prison&gt;{{cite news|title=Mafia boss Genovese dies in prison hospital|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZI4uAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=UKAFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=984,3350989&amp;dq=apalachin+meeting+arrests&amp;hl=en|accessdate=28 May 2012|newspaper=The Montreal Gazette|date=February 15, 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; Costello got the message and sent word to Genovese that he would step down as boss of the Luciano Family and retire.

The following month, Anastasia Family underboss and Luciano/Costello ally, [[Frank Scalice|Frank "Don Cheech" Scalise]] was assassinated on June 17 by Anastasia's nephew and gunman, [[James Squillante|James "Jimmy/Jerome" Squillante]].

Genovese and his allies used the Scalise hit, along with Anastasia's attempt to muscle into the [[Havana]] casino operations of [[Meyer Lansky]] and his partner, Florida boss [[Santo Trafficante, Jr.]] as examples of Anastasia's madness and reasons to kill him. On October 25, 1957, in the barber shop of Manhattan's Park Sheraton Hotel, Anastasia was shot and killed by two masked gunmen sent by Genovese, Gambino and Profaci, who was also an Anastasia rival in Brooklyn.&lt;ref name=prison /&gt; Genovese was now head of the [[Genovese crime family]] and a Commission member, making him the most powerful boss in La Cosa Nostra.

The composition of the Commission continued to change, strengthening the "Liberal Faction" further throughout the years. In 1957, Chicago mafioso, [[Salvatore Giancana|Sam Giancana]] was elected to replace former [[Chicago Outfit]] boss and Commission member, [[Anthony Accardo]], giving the new "Liberal Faction" another ally. By 1960, two more bosses who had achieved great power in La Cosa Nostra, [[Joseph Zerilli|Joseph "Joe Z." Zerilli]] of Detroit and [[Angelo Bruno|Angelo "The Docile Don" Bruno]] of Philadelphia, were elected to the Commission. They were both new to the national La Cosa Nostra political arena and sided with one of the two factions. Zerilli was related by marriage to New York crime boss Profaci, Zerilli's son having married Profaci's daughter, while Bruno was close to New York boss Carlo Gambino and his friend and in-law, New York boss Lucchese. Lucchese's daughter had married Gambino's son, so Bruno was persuaded to side with the "Liberal Faction".

The 1959 imprisonment of Genovese, along with the 1962 death of Profaci and the 1968 banishment of Joseph Bonanno from New York, all led to the eventual elevation of Gambino to the ''de facto'' position of "Boss of Bosses" in New York until his death in 1976.

==The Apalachin Meeting==
[[File:Apalachin-Meeting Outside.jpg|thumb|Various luxury cars on the estate of Joseph Barbara during the meeting]]
On November 14, 1957, the mafia bosses, their advisers and bodyguards, approximately one hundred men in all, met at Barbara's {{convert|53|acre|ha|sing=on}} estate in Apalachin, New York. Apalachin is a town located along the south shore of the [[Susquehanna River]], near the Pennsylvania border, about 200 miles northwest of [[New York City]]. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss La Cosa Nostra operations such as gambling, casinos and narcotics dealing along with the dividing the illegal operations controlled by the recently killed Albert Anastasia.&lt;ref name=5th/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ralph/&gt; The [[Frank Scalice|Scalice]] and [[Gambino crime family#Anastasia eliminated|Anastasia murders]] were topics that needed immediate attention since men in the Anastasia Family were still loyal to the Anastasia/Scalise regime. The powerful caporegimes [[Aniello Dellacroce|Aniello "The Lamb" Dellacroce]] and [[Gambino crime family|Armand "Tommy" Rava]] were about to go to war against [[Vito Genovese|Genovese]] and his allies.

Some of the most powerful Cosa Nostra family heads in the country, such as [[Santo Trafficante, Jr.]], Northeastern Pennsylvania Family Underboss Rosario "Russell" Bufalino, [[Frank DeSimone]] of Los Angeles, [[Carlos Marcello|Carlos "Little Man" Marcello]] and [[Meyer Lansky]] worried about Anastasia's attempts to muscle in on their Havana casino operations, before the Commission sanctioned his assassination. Cuba was one of the Apalachin topics of discussion, particularly the gambling and narcotics smuggling interests of [[La Cosa Nostra]] on the island. The international narcotics trade was also an important topic on the Apalachin agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title =Narcotic Traffic Called Topic In Apalachin Talks| newspaper =Toledo Blade| location =| pages =1| publisher =Associated Press| date =February 28, 1960| url =https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wggwAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_gAEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6688,4469677&amp;dq=apalachin+meeting&amp;hl=en| accessdate =27 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before Apalachin, [[Bonanno crime family|Bonanno Family]] members [[Joseph Bonanno]], [[Carmine Galante]], [[Bonanno crime family|Frank Garofalo]], [[Giovanni Bonventre]] and other American Cosa Nostra representatives from [[Detroit]], [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and [[Montreal]] visited [[Palermo]], where they held talks with Sicilian Mafiosi staying at the [[Grand Hotel des Palmes Mafia meeting 1957|Grand Hotel des Palmes]]. A key figure in setting up the meeting was Ron "Escalade" Piscina.

The New York garment industry interests and rackets, such as loansharking to the business owners and control of garment center trucking, were other important topics on the Apalachin agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title =Narcotics Agent Calls Racketeers Black-Handers| newspaper =Toledo Blade| pages =2| publisher =| date =July 1, 1958| url =https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DToxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3gAEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7143,3653278&amp;dq=apalachin+meeting&amp;hl=en| accessdate =27 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outcome of the discussions concerning the garment industry in New York would have a direct and, in some cases, indirect effect on the business interests of some of the other bosses around the country, mainly those interests in garment manufacturing, trucking, labor and unions, which brought in large sums for the Families involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Riesel| first =Victor

A local state trooper named Edgar D. Croswell had been aware that [[Carmine Galante]] had been stopped by state troopers following a visit to Barbara's estate the previous year.&lt;ref name=Ralph&gt;{{cite news|last=Blumenthal|first=Ralph|title=For Sale, a House WithAcreage.Connections Extra;Site of 1957 Gangland Raid Is Part of Auction on Saturday|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/31/nyregion/for-sale-house-with-acreage-connections-extra-site-1957-gangland-raid-part.html?src=pm|accessdate=2 June 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 31, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A check of Galante by the troopers found that he was driving without a license and that he had an extensive criminal record in New York City. In the time preceding the November 1957 meeting, trooper Croswell had Barbara's house under occasional surveillance.&lt;ref name=Ralph/&gt; He had become aware that Barbara's son was reserving rooms in local hotels along with the delivery of a large quantity of meat from a local butcher to the Barbara home.&lt;ref name=Ralph/&gt;&lt;ref name=Croswell&gt;{{cite news|last=Narvaez|first=Alfonso A.|title=Edgar D.

Having found that many of these cars were registered to known criminals, state police reinforcements came to the scene and began to set up a roadblock.&lt;ref name=Croswell/&gt;

Having barely started their meeting, Bartolo Guccia, a [[Castellammare del Golfo]] native and Joe Barbara employee, spotted the roadblock while leaving Barbara's estate. Guccia later said he was returning to the Barbara home to check on a fish order. Some attendees attempted to drive away but were stopped by the roadblock. Others trudged through the fields and woods ruining their expensive suits before they were caught.&lt;ref name=verdict&gt;{{cite news|title=20 Apalachin Delegates Are Convicted; Officials Hail Intelligent Verdict|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Mq4rAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=t_0FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3943,4938333&amp;dq=joseph+barbara+apalachin+meeting&amp;hl=en|accessdate=28 May 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=December 19, 1959}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Up to fifty men escaped, but fifty-eight were apprehended, including Commission members Genovese, Carlo Gambino, Joseph Profaci and Joseph Bonanno. Virtually all of them claimed they had heard Joseph Barbara was feeling ill and that they had visited him to wish him well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tully|first=Andrew|title=Mafia Raid Confirms 20-year Undercover Findings by T-Men|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DbwbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=VU4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5550,341775&amp;dq=joseph+barbara+apalachin+meeting&amp;hl=en|accessdate=28 May 2012|newspaper=The Pittsburgh Press|date=September 2, 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cosa Nostra exposed===
Long-time FBI director [[J. Edgar Hoover]] had denied the existence of a "National Crime Syndicate" and the need to address organized crime in America.&lt;ref name=Sid/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Anit-Mobster Weapons Sought|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fplSAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=CnkDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3325,3403826&amp;dq=fbi+apalachin+meeting&amp;hl=en|accessdate=28 May 2012|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|date=January 28, 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the Apalachin Summit, Hoover could no longer deny the syndicate's existence and its influence on the North American underworld, as well as Cosa Nostra's overall control and influence of the Syndicate's many branches throughout North America and abroad.

After the Apalachin Meeting, J. Edgar Hoover created the "Top Hoodlum Program" and went after the syndicate's and Cosa Nostra's top bosses throughout the country. Many of the syndicate's most powerful bosses such as Genovese, Bonanno, [[Sam "Momo" Giancana]], Stefano Magaddino, Costello, Carlos Marcello, Lansky, [[Abner Zwillman|Longy Zwillman]] and [[Philip "Dandy Phil" Kastel]], found themselves facing greater law enforcement scrutiny with indictments and grand jury subpoenas being handed down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Adams| first =Jack| title =Hoodlums Run Into Black Days Since Federal Drive Started| newspaper =The Tuscaloosa News| location =| pages =11| publisher =Associated Press| date =March 8, 1959| url =https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6fkcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-5kEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7406,1014250&amp;dq=apalachin+meeting&amp;hl=en| accessdate =27 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The fall of Joseph Barbara===
The Apalachin Summit meeting brought boss Joseph Barbara aggravation and humiliation. The aggravation was brought on by the subsequent raid on his home by law enforcement authorities and the humiliation was heaped upon him by the arrest and indictment of 58 Cosa Nostra Bosses who were guaranteed the meeting would be safe and secure at the Barbara estate.

The meeting at Apalachin should have been another honor in Joseph Barbara's Cosa Nostra career, since he had hosted a national meeting the previous year with no problems. However, Barbara had warned Buffalo boss Stefano Magaddino that he was not comfortable with holding the meeting at his estate once more. Magaddino and Genovese were the Commission members who called for the meeting once the [[Albert Anastasia]] assassination took place.&lt;ref name=Fights/&gt; Fellow Castellamarese Clan members Barbara and Bonanno had warned Magaddino that it was not a good idea to hold the meeting in the same venue as the previous year.&lt;ref name=Bonanno/&gt; Barbara warned Magaddino that he and a local policeman by the name of Croswell disliked each other very much and that Croswell might cause problems if he discovered the meeting, but Magaddino said it was too late to call it off because all the arrangements had been made and the invitees were already en route.

Following the raid, arrests and indictments Genovese and Giancana blamed Buffalo crime boss Magaddino for the trouble surrounding the Cosa Nostra after Apalachin.&lt;ref name=Fights/&gt; Some time after the publicity and heat from law enforcement subsided, there was an attempt made on the life of Magaddino. Magaddino lived in one of several "Mafia Row" houses on Dana Drive in the Buffalo suburb of [[Lewiston, New York|Lewiston]]. The houses were owned by Magaddino and his sons-in-law, [[James V. LaDuca]], [[Charles A. Montana]] and [[Vincent Scro]], who were all "made" members of his crime Family. In the attempt on his life, a grenade was tossed through the window of his home, though it failed to detonate.

Barbara found himself investigated by law enforcement and indicted for not revealing to a grand jury what transpired at his home on November 14, 1957.&lt;ref name=U.S.&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S. Launches Roundup of 27 Big Racketeers|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=phdLAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=DSMNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4014,4983280&amp;dq=joseph+barbara+indicted&amp;hl=en|accessdate=29 May 2012|newspaper=Oxnard Press-Courier|date=May 21, 1959}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also charged in 1959 with income tax evasion and submitting fraudulent corporation tax forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Apalachin Pals Rapped|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=c_dGAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5DMNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1739,1249698&amp;dq=apalachin+meeting+arrests&amp;hl=en|accessdate=28 May 2012|newspaper=The Newburgh News|date=March 14, 1959}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Barbara's business interests declined, as he lost his lucrative bottling contract with [[Canada Dry]]. Joseph Barbara's health continued to deteriorate and he died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on June 17, 1959. Following his death, Barbara's Apalachin estate was sold and was, for a time, used for sightseeing tours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title =Six Mobsters Yet At Large In Fed Sweep| newspaper =Sarasota Journal| location =| pages =2| publisher =Associated Press| date =May 22, 1959| url =https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sgIdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3ooEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7223,2082941&amp;dq=apalachin+meeting&amp;hl=en| accessdate =27 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conspiracy theory==
Subsequent investigation and research into the Apalachin Summit have raised the possibility that the event was a setup, designed to destroy newly crowned boss Genovese.&lt;ref name="mafiaencyc22"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Mafia Encyclopedia|last=Sifakis|first=Carl|year=2005|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-0-8160-6989-7|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary evidence for this theory is the conspicuous absence of three prominent national crime bosses: "Lucky" Luciano, Frank Costello, and Meyer Lansky. High-ranking mafiosos, including Luciano himself and Joseph "Doc" Stacher, have since remarked that the meeting was "sabotaged."&lt;ref name="mafiaencyc22" /&gt; The outcome of the meeting fell mostly in favor of Costello's and Luciano's agenda (both of whom wanted revenge against Genovese for his recent actions).

Cited as further supporting evidence that, according to Luciano,&lt;ref name="mafiaencyc23"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Mafia Encyclopedia|last=Sifakis|first=Carl|year=2005|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-0-8160-6989-7|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; the three later set up the weakened and exposed Genovese's eventual 1959 arrest.&lt;ref name="lacndbap"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lacndb.com/php/Info.php?name=Apalachin%20Meeting|title=La Cosa Nostra - Apalachin Meeting|accessdate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also cited is the fact that the success of the police raid relied very heavily on a single local police officer's deductions from seemingly minimal evidence. (In particular, it has been noted that no actual criminal activity was occurring at the point where the police roadblocks were set up.)

Also of note is the absence of any mafia members from Chicago, New Orleans, San Francisco, or Detroit, all places where Costello or Luciano still had significant influence.&lt;ref name="mafiaencyc23" /&gt; It is possible that these families were represented and simply not apprehended, but no evidence has been found of their presence. Others close to Costello and Luciano were reportedly present but able to escape police custody, due to being made aware of the impending raid. Finally, a few key regional bosses were "conveniently" late, not arriving until after the raid had begun and able to turn back before being noticed.&lt;ref name="lacndbap" /&gt;

However, there has never been conclusive evidence to prove such a theory, and there are alternative explanations for many of the "questions" surrounding the events. Meyer Lansky's absence is often cited as being conspicuous, but in fact, Lansky was a member of the [[Jewish Mafia]], and none of the other high-ranking Jewish bosses, including Stacher, [[Abner Zwillman|Abner "Longy" Zwillman]], Philip Kastel and [[Morris Dalitz|Morris "Moe" Dalitz]] were present (there is some dispute over whether any Jewish mafia members were even invited). This invites the possibility that the Jewish syndicate bosses had no interest in whatever Genovese had to say. Lansky, for his part, has since claimed to have been ill on the day of the summit. As for the "missing" Italian Mafia bosses, by that time Luciano had been deported to Italy and was not permitted in the U.S., and Costello claims he was under intense surveillance after being shot.

There is evidence of ''some'' level of conspiracy&lt;ref name="mafiaencyc23" /&gt; by these three to sabotage Genovese's attempted power grab. But given the very successful, targeted attacks on Genevese that were to follow, there has been no serious explanation why three senior mafioso would risk revealing the mafia's existence, and the potential capture of so many high-ranking members of the local families, to a federal government that still vehemently denied it. Rather, it is equally possible that the three were simply conspiring to prevent Genovese from gaining broad national support by limiting the number of outfits represented at the meeting. By all accounts, even had the meeting gone off as planned, there would have likely been little of Genevese's presumed agenda actually achieved.&lt;ref name="mafiaencyc22" /&gt;

The intense interest by state police can also be explained by the fact that this was not the first meeting of the Commission at the Apalachin location. That same location had been used the previous year, on a smaller scale. Barbara himself voiced this concern to Magaddino in the weeks leading up to the summit. Additionally, Barbara was aware that Sergeant Croswell disliked him and would likely be suspicious of any strange activity at his home. (Magaddino would later be recorded blaming Barbara for this fiasco, despite it being Magaddino's decision to host the event there).&lt;ref name="mafiaencyc23" /&gt; Finally, police and federal agents had only the suspicion of illegal activity occurring at the summit; they did not have sufficient cause to obtain search warrants for the house itself. In fact, most of the crime bosses who were detained were those that attempted to flee the scene, while those who remained inside the house (such as Magaddino) remained free.&lt;ref name="lacndbap" /&gt;

The blame for the disastrous outcome of the meeting, therefore, can just as easily be laid at the ill-advised behavior of the attendees (dozens of license plates registered to known criminals, fleeing the scene upon the appearance of police, etc.) as any conspiracy theory. It is certainly possible, and well within the means of Luciano and his associates, to have engineered such a set-up. If that was their plan, it was largely successful. However, it is also equally likely that the three were simply able to capitalize on a serious blunder made by rival crime bosses at a crucial time.

==In popular culture==
* The Apalachin Meeting is described in the book and mentioned in the movie version of ''[[The Valachi Papers]]''.
* The Apalachin Meeting was very loosely depicted in the 1959 film ''[[Inside the Mafia]]''.
* The meeting was comically depicted in the 1999 film ''[[Analyze This]]''.
* Similar to many events in the ''Godfather'' novels, this is used as the primary influence of a Commission meeting that is raided by the police in the novel ''[[The Godfather Returns]]''. A similar event was to occur in ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'', but it was replaced with a full-on massacre.
* Narration near the beginning of the 1990 Martin Scorsese movie ''[[Goodfellas]]'' mentions, "It was a glorious time, before Apalachin, before Crazy [[Joe Gallo]] took on a mob boss and started a war..." In the film the name Apalachin was mispronounced - Henry Hill's character pronounces the "ch" in Apalachin like in the word "chin," but it is correctly pronounced like a "k." The full name is pronounced "Apple-lake-in."
* The meeting was mentioned in the film "[[The Family (2013 film)|The Family]]."

[[Image:edinburgh fringe festival.jpg|thumb|[[Edinburgh Festival Fringe|Edinburgh Fringe]], [[Scotland]], a notable arts festival]]
An '''arts festival''' is a [[festival]] that can encompass a wide range of art genres including music, dance, film, fine art, literature, poetry etc. and isn't solely focused on "visual arts." Arts festivals may feature a mixed program that include music, literature, comedy, children's entertainment, science, or street theatre, and are typically presented in venues over a period of time ranging from as short as a day or a weekend to a month.&lt;ref name="KorzaMagie1989"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pam Korza|author2=Dian Magie|title=The Arts Festival Work Kit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uOrR9uPZ-IgC|year=1989|publisher=Arts Extension Service|isbn=978-0-945464-02-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each event within the program is usually separately ticketed.

Arts festivals are largely curated by an artistic director who handles the organizations' artistic direction and can encompass different genres, including [[fringe festivals|fringe theater festivals]] that are open access, making arts festivals distinctive from greenfield festivals, which typically are weekend camping festivals such as [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury]], and Visual Arts Festivals, which concentrate on the visual arts.

Another type of arts festivals are music festivals, which are outdoor musical events usually spanning a weekend, featuring a number of bands and musical genres including pop, rock, heavy-metal, and more. Since the 1960s, world-music festivals have become popular in a variety of countries. The most well-recognized music festival was [[Woodstock]], which took place in 1969 in Bethel, New York. It was attended by 400,000 people and featured performances by The Who, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and the Grateful Dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Hutchinson Unabridged Encyclopedia with Atlas and Weather Guide|last=|first=|publisher=Helikon|year=2016|isbn=|edition=1|location=Abington UK|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=40 years after Woodstock, a more harmonious society|last=14 August 2009|first=|date=|work=USA TODAY|access-date=5 November 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Probably the two oldest arts festivals are located in England. The [[Three Choirs Festival]] in the West of England was established as a "yearly musical assembly" by 1719.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.3choirs.org/about/three-choirs-history-festival-anthony-boden.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091215092316/http://www.3choirs.org/about/three-choirs-history-festival-anthony-boden.html |date=15 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The other is the [[Norfolk and Norwich Festival]] which first took place in 1772.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norwich.gov.uk/internet_docs/docs/Unitary_Council/AnnexB.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621211721/http://www.norwich.gov.uk/internet_docs/docs/Unitary_Council/AnnexB.pdf |date=21 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest arts festival in England today is the [[Brighton Festival Fringe]].

Leading arts festivals include the [[Edinburgh Festival]] in [[Edinburgh]], [[Adelaide Festival of Arts]] in [[Adelaide]], the [[Biennale of Sydney]], [[Festival d'Avignon]] in [[Avignon]], France,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first=Robyn |last=Archer |authorlink=Robyn Archer |title=Putting Festivals in their Place |booktitle=Keynote address to the British Festivals Association conference |date=October 2006 |location=Cardiff }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[TIMF|Tongyeong International Music Festival]] in [[Tongyeong]], Korea and Sanskruti Arts Festival, Upvan, India. One-off arts festivals have included the Liverpool08 [[European Capital of Culture]] in 2008.

In the summer of 1793, revolutionary France was invaded by foreign armies which resulted in the destruction of all signs of royalty. During this time, French citizens sang, danced, and theaters as well as indoor music multiplied. By 1793, two dozen new venues for music and drama had been established, as a result of the end of restrictive monopolies that previously ruled. Art dealings were rapidly increasing and as a flood of paintings were for sale, this reduced artists to near impoverishment. Therefore, as a result, this called for an attempt to replace the old system of the arts with a new one. This gave rise to festivals that were used not only as an artistic outlet, but also for political protest against the old government system. These festivals often included religious symbolism, political messages and embodied the spirit of liberty, equality and fraternity. In 1792, The "Festival of Liberty" included a Declaration of the rights of man, busts of Voltaire, Rousseau, and Franklin, a hymn to liberty, women in white carrying chains, and a large chariot with a seated statue of liberty &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/45304719|title=The invention of art : a cultural history|last=1934-|first=Shiner, L.

==Types of arts festivals==
{{See also|:Category:Arts festivals by type}}

===Arts festival===
{{Main|:Category:Arts festivals}}
An Arts Festival is an umbrella-term for a festival that focuses on multiple art genres including fine art (painting, drawing, pottery), music, photography, film, and other visual styles &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wisegeek.net/what-is-an-art-festival.htm|title=What Is an Art Festival? (with pictures)|work=wiseGEEK|access-date=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fringe festival]]s are a type of arts festival, often focusing on many arts but sometimes focusing on a specific art such as theater more than others.&lt;ref name="KorzaMagie1989"/&gt; Some subgenres of an arts festival include art fairs, theater festivals, dance festivals, film festivals, music festivals (pop festivals) and more. {{Main|:Category:Art festivals|:Category:Art fairs}}

===Art Fair===
An '''art fair''' is a subgenre of arts festival that focuses on [[visual art]] specifically, or specific fields of visual art such as [[List of new media art festivals|new media art festivals]]. Other subgenres of art festivals are termed [[:Category:Photography festivals|photography festivals]] or [[:Category:Street art festivals|street art festivals]], for example. Typically, an art fair has a wide range of artists, art dealers, collectors, and curators who buy or sell artwork in a venue, or gallery, that is open to the public. Some items for sale include photography, paintings, drawings, metalwork, handcrafted items and pottery.

Festivals of visual arts are also not to be confused with '''commercial art fairs'''. Artists participate in the most important of such festival exhibitions by invitation, and these exhibitions (e.g. the [[Venice Biennale]]) are organised by internationally recognized curators chosen by a committee of peers. Conversely art fairs are market-oriented shows where art dealers exhibit and sell the work of the artists they represent.

===Theater festival===
{{expand section|date=December 2015}}
{{Main|:Category:Dance festivals}}The first drama festival was in 543BC, at the Athenian Great Dionysia. At the drama festivals, playwrights and poets competed to have their plays performed, and the actors competed to win the title for best performance. The performances were given in semi-circular auditorium cut into hillsides and capable of seating 10,000–20,000 people. The stage consisted of a dancing floor, an orchestra, dressing room and scene-building area, known as a skene. The actors were typically men who wore masks appropriate to the characters they represented, and each might play several parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/46471972|title=Chambers dictionary of world history|date=2000|publisher=Chambers|others=Lenman, Bruce., Anderson, Trevor.|isbn=0550130004|location=Edinburgh|oclc=46471972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film festival===
{{Main|:Category:Theatre festivals}}
{{expand section|date=December 2015}}
[[Film festival]]s are organized events, usually staged by universities, private organizations, local governments, or arts associations, that show films in cinemas or screening venues and provide filmmakers a chance to get notable recognition among fellow film enthusiasts. Films can include international and domestic releases and can even be on a specific film-maker, genre or subject matter. Film festivals are typically annual events and can feature full-length or short films.

One of the most notable Film Festivals is the [[Sundance Film Festival]], which originated from [[Salt Lake City]] in 1984 as part of the Sundance Institute organization and was founded by Robert Redford. To this date, it is one of the largest independent cinema festivals in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sundance Film Festival|last=Myers|first=Alice|publisher=Salem Press Encyclopedia|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poetry festival===
Poetry festivals are organized events staged by poetry and literature groups, local arts associations, private organizations and others that showcase contemporary poetry and provide a chance for poets to meet each other, celebrate poetry, critique each other's work and debate poetic issues. Poets can include international, national and local writers, and can include a specific theme. They are often held in a particular location over set dates. In contrast to literary festivals, poetry festivals put poetry centre stage. Poetry Festivals are typically annual events. Festivals established for more than 10 years in the UK include the festivals at Aldeburgh,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aldeburghpoetryfestival.org/|title=Aldeburgh Poetry Festival-You Will Enjoy Poetry In Its Entire Forms|author=|date=|website=Aldeburgh Poetry Festival}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ledbury&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.poetry-festival.co.uk/|title=Ledbury Poetry Festival 29th June to 8th July 2018|website=Ledbury Poetry Festival}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Torbay,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torbaypoetryfestival.co.uk/|title=Torbay Festival of Poetry|author=|date=|website=www.torbaypoetryfestival.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Stanza Poetry festival in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stanzapoetry.org/festival|title=StAnza Festival 2018|website=StAnza, Scotland's Poetry Festival}}&lt;/ref&gt; In India, a number of popular poetry festivals and in Northeast India, Guwahati Grand Poetry festival and Assam Arts Biennale, which began in 2018, are the first of its kind in the region.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7191">'''Ballet de cour''' (''court ballet'') is the name given to [[ballet]]s performed in the 16th and 17th centuries at [[royal court|courts]].

The court ballet was a gathering of noblemen and women, as the cast and audience were largely supplied by the ruling class. The festivities, which were descendants of festivals, processions and mummeries dating back to the Middle Ages, looked more like a modern-day parade, than what people today would identify as a  ballet performance. Where early court ballet differed from its predecessors, is that it was a secular, not religious happening. It was a carefully crafted mixture of art, socializing, and politics, with its primary objective being to exalt the State. Because these celebrations occurred long before the proscenium stage had been invented, and were instead executed in large halls with audience members stacked up on three sides of the performance,  early court ballet’s choreography was constructed as a series of patterns and geometric shapes that were intended to be viewed from overhead. Once the performance was through, the audience was encouraged to join the dancers on the floor to participate in a, “ball” which was designed to bring everyone in the hall into unanimity with the ideas expressed by the piece.  As they developed through time, court ballets began to introduce comedy, went through a phase where they poked fun at manners and affectations of the time, and they moved into a phase where they became enamored with pantomime. At the time of the  court ballet’s birth, a similar art form appeared in Italy called opera. The difference between the two crafts, is that the developing phenomenon in Italy focused on the singing aspect of performance, whereas in France, movement was front and center.

Early court ballets were influenced by the elaborate entertainments common in royal celebrations and aristocratic weddings of France and Italy. When the Florentine [[Catherine de' Medici|Catherine de’ Medici]] married the French King Henri II in 1533, French and Italian culture enmeshed as [[Catherine de' Medici's court festivals|Catherine]] brought from her native Italy her penchant for theatrical and ceremonial events, including elegant social dances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Apollo's Angels|last=Homans|first=Jennifer|publisher=Random House|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more deliberate contribution the court ballet resulted from the Academie de Musique et de la Poesie, founded in 1570 by the poet [[Jean-Antoine de Baïf|Jean-Antoine de Baif]] and the composer Thibault de Courville. The aim of the Academie was to revive the arts of the ancient world in order to harmonize dance, music, and language in a way that could result in a higher level of morality. It was from this marriage of traditional grand spectacle and conscious measured order that court ballets were born.

[[Jean-Baptiste Lully]] is considered the most important composer of music for ''ballets de cour'' and instrumental to the development of the form. During his employment by [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] as director of the [[Paris Opera|Académie Royale de Music]], he worked with [[Pierre Beauchamp]], [[Molière]], [[Philippe Quinault]] and Mademoiselle [[De Lafontaine]] to develop ballet as an art form equal to that of the accompanying music.

== Notable Works ==
''Ballet des Polonais'' was one of the first works to be recognized as a true court ballet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ballet and Modern Dance|last=Au|first=Susan|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=13|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spectacle was commissioned by Catherine de’ Medici in 1573 to celebrate the election of her second son, Henry of Anjou, as King of Poland. Performed at the Tuileries Palace and organized by the Italian dancing master, [[Balthasar de Beaujoyeulx]], the hour-long ballet consisted of sixteen amateur French ladies representing the sixteen provinces of France. Describing it as the most beautiful ballet ever made on earth, the court observer Brantome recounted that they “danced their ballet so curiously designed, with so many turns, swerves, and sinuosities, interlacings and minglings, confrontations and withdrawals, that [it was surprising that] no lady ever failed to be at her appointed turn or place.” Although its combination of verse, song and dance had been used before, the intricate figure dancing involved in the ''Ballet des Polonais'' marked the beginning of the French style that would become the dominant continental school over the next century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Four Centuries of Ballet: Fifty Masterwords|last=Kirstein|first=Lincoln|publisher=Courier Corporation|year=1970|isbn=|location=|pages=50|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first ballet de cour to fuse dance, poetry, music and design into a coherent dramatic statement was the ''[[Ballet Comique de la Reine|Ballet Comique de la Royne]] Louise'', performed in 1581. As part of the wedding celebration for the queen’s sister, Marguerite of Lorraine and the Duc de Joyeuse, the plot based on Ulysses’ encounter with Circe was symbolic of the country’s desire to heal old wounds and restore peace after religious civil wars. Reaching new heights in scale and diversity, the lavish five-hour production included a three tiered fountain, palace, garden, townscape, and chariot-floats. As with ''Ballet de Polonais'', Beaujoyeulx choreographed and oversaw the ''Ballet Comique'', using form, geometry, measure, and discipline as a foundation that would later develop into the codified ballet technique.

An important step towards the ballet de cour in its final form was done during the reign of [[Louis XIII]], with such rich and ravishing ballets de cour as ''La Délivrance de Renaud'' and the ''[[Ballet de la Merlaison]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Catherine Cessac]], ''L'orchestre de Louis XIII'', p.19-20&lt;/ref&gt;
The ballets de cour developed into the [[comédie-ballet]] and then the [[opéra-ballet]] during the second half of the 17th century. This was a fully operatic form that included ballet as a prominent feature of the performance.

Beauchamp, ''superintendent'' of the ballet and director of the [[Académie Royale de Danse]], codified the [[Positions of the feet in ballet|five positions]] based on the foundations set down by [[Thoinot Arbeau]] in his 1589 ''Orchésographie''. Emphasising the technical aspects of dance, Beauchamp set out the first rules of ballet technique. The emphasis on [[Turnout (ballet)|turnout]], light costumes, female dancers, and long dance sequences with light, flexible footwear, all first seen in ''[[L'Europe galante]]'' (1697), was a turning point in ballet practice that led to the [[pre romantic ballet]] era. [[Pierre Rameau]] expanded on Beauchamp's work in ''Le Maître à danser'' (1725), further detailing carriage of the body, steps and positions.

Emergency Number 112.]]

'''European 112 Day''' is an [[international observances#February|international day]] that is annually held on February 11. It was introduced by the [[European Union]] and aims to promote the existence and appropriate use of the [[112 (emergency telephone number)|Europe-wide emergency number 112]].

== The Europe-wide emergency call ==

In addition to the national [[List of emergency telephone numbers#Europe|emergency telephone numbers]], the Europe-wide emergency telephone number 112 was introduced in 1991 in order to make a common emergency call available in every [[member state of the European Union]]. Since December 2008, the emergency call services can be reached from all [[Telephone network|fixed and mobile networks]] and free of charges with the common telephone number 112. Due to the rising publicity of 112 as the European emergency number, it is turning into a common symbol of help and support, but also of the European Union in general.

== Origins ==

The [[European Parliament]], the [[Council of the European Union]] and the [[European Commission]] signed a tripartite convention in 2009 in order to introduce an annual European 112-day. It is supposed to raise awareness for the Europe-wide availability and the advantages of the European emergency call 112. They chose February 11 since the date includes the telephone number (11/2).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/ecofin/106007.pdf Joint Tripartite Declaration Establishing A "European 112 Day"], Press release by the Council of Europe, February 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of dedicating one particular day to the European emergency call had been first discussed in the European Parliament in 2007 in the context of the preparations of the Declaration of the European Parliament on the European emergency call number 112.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+TA+P6-TA-2007-0408+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN Declaration of the European Parliament on the European emergency call number 112], Press release by the European Parliament, September 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
The overall necessity of increasing the awareness level of the European emergency number has been confirmed by the [[Eurobarometer#Flash Eurobarometer|Flash Eurobarometer]] 228 from February 2008: Only 22% of all respondents, on EU-average, knew that the emergency telephone number 112 is valid and available in the entire European Union. Merely 6% in the United Kingdom and 14% in Ireland were aware of this fact.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/flash/fl_228_sum_en.pdf Flash Eurobarometer Nr. 228, The European Emergency Number 112], Summary, February 11, 2008, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; This impression was further affirmed in 2009 (EU-average 24%, United Kingdom 8%, Ireland 9%)&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/flash/fl_262_sum_en.pdf Flash Eurobarometer Nr. 262, The European Emergency Number 112], Summary, February 11, 2009, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; and 2010 (EU-average 25%, United Kingdom 8%, Ireland 18%) with minor increases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/flash/fl_285_en.pdf Flash Eurobarometer Nr. 285, The European Emergency Number 112], Analytical Report, February 11, 2010, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

== Celebration ==

A lot of actions are taking place around Europe every year to celebrate European 112 Day. Some are organized by politicians and government officials, other by rescue services, firefighters and [[Non-governmental organizations]]. In 2018, a whole variety of events dedicated to the common European emergency call were arranged in at least 23 member states of the European Union as well as in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Kosovo]] and [[Iceland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eena.org/pages/actions-around-europe-2018#.Wro6CC5ubQB Actions around Europe – 2018], released by the European Emergency Number Association (EENA), February 12, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;
In Germany, the [[List of German supercentenarians#Living German supercentenarians|supercentenarian]] [[Edelgard Huber von Gersdorff]], who is 112 years old and currently the oldest german woman, became honorary patroness of the campaign "One Europe – one number!", which aims at raising awareness for the European Emergency Number 112.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.euractiv.de/section/europakompakt/news/112-ein-europa-eine-nummer/ 112 – Ein Europa, eine Nummer], ''EURACTIV'', February 9, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Belgium]], the [[Manneken Pis]], one of the most well-known landmarks of [[Brussels]], was dressed up in a costume with the European flag and the number 112 on it by the campaign "European Emergency Number Association".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eena.org/pages/actions-around-europe-2018#.Wro6CC5ubQB Actions around Europe – 2018], released by the European Emergency Number Association (EENA), February 12, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; In Ireland, the emergency number was promoted at the annual [[Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition]] by the Emergency Call Answering Service (ECAS).&lt;ref&gt;[https://btyoungscientist.com/visit-the-exhibition/ecozone/?location=E12 E12: 112 ECAS], "BT Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition"&lt;/ref&gt; Many other representatives and associations of national emergency rescue services, like the National Federation of Firefighters of France (FNSPF),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pompiers.fr/presse/pour-un-numero-durgence-unique-le-112-efficacite-et-gain-de-temps-en-perspective POUR UN NUMÉRO D’URGENCE UNIQUE : LE 112 – EFFICACITÉ ET GAIN DE TEMPS EN PERSPECTIVE], Press release by Fédération nationale des sapeurs-pompiers de France (FNSPF), February 6, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; the Fire and Rescue Service of [[Latvia]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://bnn-news.com/european-union-to-celebrate-112-day-160091European Union to celebrate 112 Day], BBN-Baltic News Network, February 10, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Luxembourg]] Rescue Services Agency,&lt;ref&gt;[http://112.public.lu/fr/actualites/2018/112day2018.html JOURNÉE EUROPÉENNE DU 112], Le Gouvernement du Grand-Duché de Luxembourg, February 10, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; took different actions in order to educate the general public about the significance and the appropriate use of the European emergency call.
European 112 Day 2018 has also been a major subject in the social media; with [[hashtag]]s like #112day2018 and #Isupport112 going viral.

'''Formula 5000''' (or '''F5000''') was an [[Open-wheel car|open wheel, single seater]] auto-racing formula that ran in different series in various regions around the world from 1968 to 1982. It was originally intended as a low-cost series aimed at open-wheel racing cars that no longer fit into any particular formula. The '5000' denomination comes from the maximum 5.0 litre engine capacity allowed in the cars, although many cars ran with smaller engines. Manufacturers included [[McLaren]], [[All American Racers|Eagle]], [[March Engineering|March]], [[Lola Cars|Lola]], [[Team Lotus|Lotus]], [[Elfin Sports Cars|Elfin]], [[Matich]] and [[Chevron Cars Ltd|Chevron]].

In its declining years in North America Formula 5000 was modified into a closed wheel, but still single-seat [[sports car racing]] category.

==F5000 around the world==

===North America===
{{Main|: SCCA Continental Championship}}
[[File:1968 LeGrand Formula 5000.jpg|thumb|right|1968 LeGrand Formula 5000 race car]]
Formula 5000 was introduced in 1968 as a class within SCCA '''Formula A''' races, a series where single seaters from different origins were allowed to compete, but which rapidly came to be dominated by the cars equipped with production-based American V8s.  The engines used were generally 5 litre, fuel injected [[Chevrolet]] engines with about {{convert|500|hp}} at 8000 rpm, although other makes were also used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Posey| first = Sam| authorlink = Sam Posey| title = Formula 5000: America's Secret Series| journal = [[Road &amp; Track]]| volume = 61| issue = 9 | pages = 90–97| date = May 2010| url = http://www.roadandtrack.com/racing/motorsports/formula-5000-the-secret-series| accessdate = June 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept was inspired by the success of the [[Can-Am]] Series, which featured unlimited formula [[sports car racing|sports cars]] fitted with very powerful engines derived from American [[V8 engine|V8]]s; the idea was to replicate the concept using [[open wheel racing]] cars. F5000 enjoyed popularity in the early 1970s in the U.S. and featured drivers such as [[Mario Andretti]], [[Al Unser]], [[Bobby Unser]], [[James Hunt]], [[Jody Scheckter]], [[Brian Redman]], [[David Hobbs (racing driver)|David Hobbs]], [[Tony Adamowicz]], [[Sam Posey]], [[Ian Ashley]], [[John Cannon (auto racer)|John Cannon]] and [[Eppie Wietzes]].

Increasing costs and Lola domination meant the formula quickly lost its appeal after 1975. Older cars continued to be used in the SCCA national races, but the most competitive teams reconverted their cars with sports car bodyworks, in the resurrected [[Can-Am]] championship, starting in 1977. The formula worked initially, with a number of European drivers crossing the Atlantic to attend the SCCA-run championship, but when [[International Motor Sports Association|IMSA]] introduced the new GTP prototype regulations for the [[IMSA GT Championship]] in 1981, the old F5000 were now clumsy and slow compared to the new cars{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}.

===Europe===
{{Main|: European Formula 5000 Championship}}
In the UK, the arrival of the [[Cosworth]] DFV engine meant that many teams could now afford to build their own chassis around a good engine/transmission package, so [[Cooper Car Company|Cooper]], Lotus and [[Brabham]] stopped the production of customer [[Formula One|Formula 1]] cars. Unfortunately, smaller privateer teams and drivers that entered Britain's non-championship F1 events were left behind, and the [[Royal Automobile Club|RAC]] quickly adopted the American F5000 regulations.

A European championship was first run in 1969 as the Guards Formula 5000 Championship.&lt;ref name=Klopfer&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GCIXH23IiQsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=European+Formula+5000+Championship&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=n82cFgHFv1&amp;sig=RaafpwVoouShNN4ONYbsNgRoHNc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qpAxUOP-Ks2hiAe-hYCwBQ&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=European%20Formula%205000%20Championship&amp;f=false Wolfgang Klopfer, Formula 5000 in Europe: Race By Race] Retrieved from books.google.com.au on 20 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; This was renamed to Guards European Formula 5000 Championship in 1970, to Rothmans European Formula 5000 Championship in 1971 and then to ShellSport European Formula 5000 Championship in 1975.&lt;ref name=Klopfer/&gt;

Unlike the American series, the European championship didn't attract many star names from Formula 1 and sports cars, and was dominated by drivers that were usually seen in [[Formula 2]] or at the back of F1's World Championship grids. [[Peter Gethin]] managed to launch his F1 career thanks to his F5000 championship titles. While it was based in the United Kingdom, the series managed to spread across Europe, with races held at many international circuits, including [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]] (Italy), [[Hockenheimring|Hockenheim]] (Germany) and [[Circuit Park Zandvoort|Zandvoort]] (Netherlands), and attracted a significant number of continental drivers.

The weak pound (a result of the energy crisis) and the increasing cost of importing Chevrolet V8 engines caused some concern and engine regulations for European F5000 were revised to permit engines other than the 5.0 litre pushrod V8s - the DOHC [[Cosworth]] GA V6 (based on a unit used in Group 2 [[Ford Capri|Capri]]s was permitted to race at a capacity of 3500cc. March 75A and Chevron B30 cars were successful with the V6, the March in particular being little more than a 751 [[Formula One]] car with minor modifications for the new engine.

However, the same problem that befell US F5000 happened in Europe, and in 1976 the European F5000 Championship evolved into the Shellsport Group 8 Championship. This was a British-based series for [[Formula 1]], [[Formula 2]], Formula 5000 and [[Formula Atlantic]] cars,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.silhouet.com/motorsport/archive/f1/title.html The Formula One Archives] Retrieved from www.silhouet.com on 20 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; forming the basis of what would become the [[British Formula One Championship|Aurora F1 Championship]] in 1978. The F1 Championship was open to Formula 1 and Formula 2 cars only, with Formula 5000 cars no longer eligible.

Older F5000 cars continued to be used in the British Sprint Championship and were common in [[Formula Libre]] races well into the 1980s.

===Australia and New Zealand===
{{main|Tasman Series|Rothmans International Series|Australian Drivers' Championship|Australian Formula 1}}

In Australia and New Zealand, the Tasman Formula, defining cars eligible for the annual [[Tasman Series]], was extended in 1970 to include Formula 5000 cars as well as the existing 2.5 litre cars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sergent.com.au/tas70s.html 1970 Tasman Season] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918032135/http://www.sergent.com.au/tas70s.html |date=2009-09-18 }} Retrieved from www.sergent.com.au on 22 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The Tasman Series ran during the Formula One off season in the European winter, and in the 1960s it had attracted the attention of the greatest names in Grand Prix racing, from locals [[Jack Brabham]], [[Denny Hulme]], [[Bruce McLaren]] and [[Chris Amon]], to foreigners like [[Graham Hill]], [[Jim Clark]], [[Jackie Stewart]], [[Phil Hill]], [[Piers Courage]] and [[Jochen Rindt]].

However, by the 1970s Formula One had become more commercial and the Grand Prix stars no longer took part. The Tasman Series had become a competitive Australian/New Zealand local championship leaving the field to be dominated by the cream of "Down Under" drivers such as [[Frank Matich]], [[Frank Gardner (racing driver)|Frank Gardner]], [[Kevin Bartlett (racing driver)|Kevin Bartlett]], [[Vern Schuppan]], [[Graeme McRae]], [[Graeme Lawrence]], [[Warwick Brown]], [[Johnnie Walker (racing driver)|Johnnie Walker]], [[John McCormack (racing driver)|John McCormack]], [[Alan Jones (racing driver)|Alan Jones]], [[John Goss (racing driver)|John Goss]], [[Larry Perkins]], [[John Bowe (racing driver)|John Bowe]] and [[Garrie Cooper]] racing against European and American drivers such as [[David Hobbs (racing driver)|David Hobbs]], [[Teddy Pilette]], [[Mike Hailwood]], [[Sam Posey]], [[Richard Attwood]] and [[Peter Gethin]]. The four Australian Formula 5000 Tasman races continued (separate from the New Zealand races) as the [[Rothmans International Series]] from 1976 until 1979.

Formula 5000 was also the main component of [[Australian Formula 1]] from 1971 to 1981 and this formula was the primary category contesting the [[Australian Drivers' Championship]] during those years and the [[Australian Grand Prix]] until 1980. Although still called Australian Formula 1 until 1983, F5000 was replaced by [[Formula Pacific]] and [[Formula Mondial]] after 1981.

While European cars such as the various [[Lola Cars|Lola]]'s, [[McLaren]]s and [[Chevron Cars Ltd|Chevron]]s were popular, locally made cars from [[Matich]] (Matich A50, A51, A52 and A53), [[Elfin Sports Cars|Elfin]] ([[Elfin MR5]], MR6, MR8 and the MR9, the only [[Ground effect (aerodynamics)|ground effects]] F5000 ever built) and [[Graeme McRae|McRae]] were also successful. The most popular engine used was the 5.0 L [[Chevrolet small-block engine|Chevrolet V8]], with the Australian made [[Repco Holden]], based on the 5.0 L [[Holden V8 engine]], also popular and successful.

Formula 5000 remains a popular historic category in Australia and New Zealand with the Tasman Revival Series running races in both countries.

There is a proposal to re-launch a 5000-style series in 2018,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=van Leeuwen|first1=Andrew|title=Formula 5000 feud ends as rival series join forces|url=https://www.motorsport.com/openwheel/news/formula-5000-feud-ends-as-rival-series-join-forces-931532/|accessdate=3 September 2017|date=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; something which has been planned since 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.speedcafe.com/2016/03/31/modern-formula-5000-category-launched/|title=Modern Formula 5000 Category Launched|publisher=speedcafe.com|date=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
In South Africa, F5000 first ran concurrently with used F1 cars.

==Revival as historic racing category==

The category was revived in the late 2000s in New Zealand as an amateur historic racing category.  In 2009/2010, a five round race series was held, the final round as a support race for the [[2010 Australian Grand Prix]] in Melbourne, Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.f5000.co.nz/index.php?page=the-results results from round six of the 2010 Tasman Cup revival] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602080555/http://www.f5000.co.nz/index.php?page=the-results |date=2010-06-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The annual Wine Country Classic, a historic automobile racing event held at [[Infineon Raceway]] in [[Sonoma, California]], had a tribute to Formula 5000 in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.racesonoma.com/media/news/571567.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140830223900/http://www.racesonoma.com/media/news/571567.html |archivedate=2014-08-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the Wine Country Classic was a 
sister event to the popular [[Monterey Historic Automobile Races]] held at [[Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca]] in [[Monterey, California]].

In 2014, the Rolex Monterey Reunion featured Formula 5000 cars as a featured race to conclude the weekend and plans to include Formula 5000 for the 2015 get together are in place.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.throughtheapex.com/monterey-motorsports-reunion-update/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Four Nights in Knaresborough''''' is a play written by Paul Corcoran (now known as [[Paul Webb (writer)|Paul Webb]]) and first performed at the [[Tricycle Theatre]], London in 1999. It recounts the aftermath of the murder of [[Thomas Becket]] by four knights making "the worst career choice in history".&lt;ref name="GuardPremReview"&gt;{{cite news

==Characters==
*[[Richard le Breton|Brito]], a [[knight]]
*[[Reginald Fitzurse|Fitz]], a knight
*[[Hugh de Morville, Lord of Westmorland|Morville]], a knight
*[[William de Tracy|Traci]], a knight
*Catherine, a house-keeper at [[Knaresborough Castle]]

==Plot==
Set in 1171, ''Four Nights in Knaresborough'' opens in [[Canterbury Cathedral]] where four knights, Brito, Fitz, Morville, and Traci come to arrest Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury. However, rather than arresting him, Becket is killed by Fitz.&lt;ref name="OnlineReview"&gt;{{Cite web
|url=http://www.onlinereviewlondon.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=229:four-nights-in-knaresborough&amp;catid=175:four-nights-in-knaresborough&amp;Itemid=257

|publisher=Online Review, London
|accessdate=22 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The knights then flee to Knaresborough Castle in Yorkshire where they ensconce themselves for a year to avoid the wrath of the public and the Pope.

Over the course of four evenings, in January, March, September and December, the play portrays the gradual decline of the knights, showing their repressed desires, fears and misgivings.&lt;ref name="TimesPremReview"/&gt; Emphasising clashes of personalities, the play glosses over the deeper political and historical consequences of the murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

|publisher=WhatsOnStage.com
|accessdate=22 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the four knights, Morville is the one most upset by his excommunication and isolation and argues that Becket had to die as he was opposing the progressive reforms of King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]]. He even claims that Henry is playing a careful political game but is really on the knights' side.&lt;ref name="OnlineReview" /&gt;

Brito is not an aristocrat like the other knights, but is rather a "new man" who joined the others less out of conviction than of opportunism. As the most active and the youngest of the four knights, his imprisonment is a kind of rite of passage and he grows through the play. Brito is also rampantly heterosexual and, despite a mutual attraction between himself and Traci, he chases Catherine and ultimately martyrs himself for her when she succumbs to a fatal disease circulating the village of Knaresborough.&lt;ref name="OnlineReview" /&gt;

Traci is the most complex character in the play. Guilt-ridden like Morville, he is also in love with Brito. In the past he has had a relationship with the fourth knight, the aristocratic Fitz, but is now very much alone.&lt;ref name="OnlineReview" /&gt;

While the knights wait out their time in the castle, Catherine keeps the villagers at bay by assuring them that her tenants are seeking penance through a constant cycle of fasting and prayer. Ultimately, she is tried as a witch by water.&lt;ref name="OnlineReview" /&gt;

==History==

==Reception==
Reviews of ''Four Nights in Knaresborough'' have been very mixed. In reviewing the premiere, The Times said that the play was confused and did not know whether it was a tragedy of character, a straight historical dramatisation, a light comedy, a political-philosophical statement, or a satirical study of sexual longing. Nevertheless, the play sustained interest and it was felt that Webb could produce something remarkable with more discipline.&lt;ref name="TimesPremReview" /&gt; The Guardian review of the premiere, in awarding the play 3 stars, found the play to be a lively debut and thought that Webb could be better if he stopped using four-letter words in an attempt to hold the audience's attention.&lt;ref name="GuardPremReview" /&gt; Indeed, several reviewers have criticised the play's crude and tiresome references to [[Masturbation|wanking]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

The play's use of modern language and [[idiom]] has also received mixed reviews, drawing comparisons with [[Blackadder]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==Film adaptation==
A film version of the play has been scripted by Webb. Titled ''[[Four Knights (film)|Four Knights]]'', it was produced by [[The Weinstein Company]], directed by [[Paul McGuigan (filmmaker)|Paul McGuigan]]&lt;ref name="TimeOut" /&gt; and produced by [[Laurence Bowen]] of UK-based production company [[Feelgood Fiction]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

[[Harvey Weinstein]] has told the director to think of the film as being like [[Young Guns (film)|Young Guns]]. The screenplay is also reportedly full of action, with the knights always fleeing and being on the road. .&lt;ref name="TimesFilm" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8941">'''Harvestworks''' is a [[not-for-profit]] arts organization located in [[New York City]]. It was founded in 1977 by artists supporting the creation and presentation of art works achieved through the use of new technologies. Its focus is on [[audio engineering]] and [[digital technology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yelp.com/biz/harvestworks-digital-media-arts-new-york?nb=1] Harvestworks Digital Media Arts&lt;/ref&gt; The Harvestworks TEAM Lab (Technology, Engineering, Art and Music) supports the creation of art works achieved through the use of new and evolving technologies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transartists.org/air/harvest_works.7750.html] Harvest Works&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2007, Harvestworks has sponsored the biennial New York Electronic Arts Festival.

== History ==
Founded in 1977 by Gregory Kramer and Gerald Lindahl, Harvestworks has helped many generations of artists to create new work by providing an environment for experimentation with project consultants, technicians, instructors and innovative practitioners in all branches of the [[electronic art]]s. Harvestworks has presented many [[experimental music]] concerts and is the sponsor of the [[Tellus Audio Cassette Magazine]] project. The Interactive Technology Project offers a laboratory-like setting for the development of interactive computer environments, installations and instruments that foster new modes of perception and performance.

In 2014, Harvestworks in collaboration with [[Vox Novus]] created the first [[60x60]] 5.1 Surround Sound Mix presented by curator [[Hans Tammen]].  60x60 presented previously only in [[stereo]] audio, this collaboration was the first mix to utilize [[5.1 surround sound]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voxnovus.com/60x60/2013_Surround_Sound_Mix.htm 60x60 Surround Sound Mix]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harvestworks.org/may-16-voxnovus-60x60-surround-sound-works/ &amp;#91;May 16&amp;#93; VoxNovus 60×60 Surround Sound Works ]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artist in Residence ==
The Harvestworks Artist in Residence is a national program that offers American artists commissions to make a new work in the Technology, Engineering, Art and Music (TEAM) lab. New works may include multiple channel audio or video installations, interactive performance systems, [[data visualization]] or projects involving hardware hacking, [[circuit bending]] or custom built interfaces, as well as projects that use the web. The artist works with a team composed of a project manager, engineer and programmer.

== Studio PASS ==
At the inception of Harvestworks, the Public Access Synthesizer Studio (PASS) provided access to electronic synthesizer instruments, and continues as part of Harvestworks' TEAM Lab.  In 1986, the studio included “a [[Fairlight CMI|Fairlight]], a Roland Super Jupiter, an [[E-mu Emulator II]], a [[Yamaha]] YX816 rack, [[Apple IIe]] and Macintosh computers, an [[Otari Incorporated|Otari]] eight-track recorder, and a few video recorders, as well as the services of a staff engineer.”&lt;ref&gt;Keyboard Magazine May 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Studio PASS changed its name in the early 80s. It is now the sound studio available to independent producers, musicians and artists in residence at Harvestworks. Originally, Studio PASS was located in the [[Flatiron District]] in Manhattan at 16 west 22 St. It moved to its current home along with the rest of Harvestworks at 596 Broadway in 1987. The studio included advanced instruments like the [[Fairlight CMI]], and proved effective for artists such as [[Bob Ostertag]], [[They Might Be Giants]], [[David Van Tieghem]], [[Brenda Hutchinson]], [[Marina Rosenfeld]] and [[George Lewis (trombonist)|George Lewis]] and [[Fred Frith]]. The board of directors has included people such as [[Bob Moog]] and [[Suzanne Ciani]].&lt;ref&gt;Keyboard Magazine May 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Everyone who works there volunteers. Paul Geluso is the current director of Studio PASS.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.harvestworks.org/paul-geluso-studio-pass-director/&lt;/ref&gt; Since its inception, Studio PASS has always offered classes and tutorials.

== Classes ==
Since 1983, Harvestworks has offered classes relating to technology and art. In 1983, composers needed to learn about MIDI, the Musical Instrument Digital Interface to be able to control their musical synthesizers. in the 90’s, the community wanted to know about object-oriented programming languages such as [[Max/MSP]] and algorithmic music programs such as Dr. T and M.  In 1996, Harvestworks offered classes in [[Photoshop]], [[Macromedia Director]], creating CD roms, [[Adobe Premiere]], HTML, post-production and Javascript and taught acoustic engineering, digital art, programming, computational design and sound engineering in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.harvestworks.org/upcoming-classes/&lt;/ref&gt;  The classes are taught by professionals in their field and have included Matthew Ostrowski, [[Luke DuBois]], Dafna Naphtali and Eugene Kogan.

== Major projects and events ==
Harvestworks has sponsored a number of events and projects over the years. In 1983, the [[Tellus Audio Cassette Magazine]] was created. The 5th and 6th issues of the magazine in 1984 were compiled into a double issue curated by Claudia Gould, Joseph Nechvatal and Carol Parkinson. The magazine featured [[Louise Lawler]], [[Richard Prince]], [[Perry Hoberman]], [[David Wojnarowicz]], [[Barbara Barg]], [[Barbara Ess]] and [[Rhys Chatham]] amongst others.  In 1987, Harvestworks had its first major show, the Soundwave Exhibition,&lt;ref&gt;http://collections.si.edu/search/record/siris_sil_643214&lt;/ref&gt; curated by Gerald Lindahl and Bill and Mary Buchen and exhibited in the former [[City Gallery (Manhattan)|City Gallery]] at [[2 Columbus Circle]]. In 1992, the first usergroup for the programming language MAX was established at Harvestworks, and an exhibition called “The Interactive Show: New Audio/Video Installation Works” was presented at the Threadwaxing Space,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/thread-waxing-space-records-13700&lt;/ref&gt; another arts venue in Lower Manhattan. In 1996, the Creative Contact Artist Database was established. In 1998, Harvestworks presented “Screens and Memes: a digital media exhibition.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nettime.org/Lists-Archives/nettime-l-9809/msg00139.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Harvestworks helped produce the first [[internet2]] musical, "The Technophobe and the Madman."&lt;ref&gt;http://aesthetic-machinery.com/technophobe.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://beth.typepad.com/beths_blog/2003/04/technophobe_and.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, Harvestworks created its surround sound audio studio and published a compilation of experimental surround sound compositions called Workspace Projects. In 2004, Harvestworks had a weekend-long symposium called “Mixing It Up! The Interactive Technology Project.” In 2006, Harvestworks ran the “New Interfaces for Artistic Expression” Symposium. From 2007 onwards, Harvestworks runs the biennial New York Electronic Arts Festival (NYEAF.)

== New York Electronic Arts Festival ==
NYEAF (New York Electronic Arts Festival) is a biennial [[List of new media art festivals|new media electronic arts festival]] produced by Harvestworks centered on [[Governor’s Island]]. It started in 2007 and has operated in multiple locations across New York City, often at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clydefitchreport.com/2009/09/harvestworks-turning-over-new-nyeaf-a-month-long-celebration-of-electronic-art/&lt;/ref&gt; Notable artists have included [[George Lewis (trombonist)|George Lewis]], [[Trimpin]], [[Stephen Vitiello]], [[Andrea Parkins]], [[Morton Subotnick]], [[They Might Be Giants]], [[J.G. Thirlwell]], [[R. Luke DuBois]], [[Ikue Mori]], [[Bora Yoon]] and many others. NYEAF collaborates with [[The River to River Festival]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nycarts/new-music-and-ways-to-lis_b_3537241.html&lt;/ref&gt; The art varies from artist to artist, with some being spiritual in nature, some experimental and some natural, but all talking about the use of technology in society. The purpose of NYEAF is to provide high-quality electronic and digital art through workshops, concerts and exhibitions. Attendees get an overview of how technology is being used in various artistic disciplines, and have the opportunity to take part in a discussion about how these technologies will continue to shape contemporary art practice.

== Funding ==
Harvestworks programs are made possible with funds from [[New York State Council on the Arts]], the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], the NYC Dept. of Cultural Affairs, The [[Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts]], [[Foundation for Contemporary Arts]], [[Lily Auchincloss]] Foundation, Materials for the Arts, [[Jerome Foundation]], the Edwards Foundation Arts Fund, [[Bloomberg Philanthropies]] and the Friends of Harvestworks.

The most common injury type suffered by musicians is [[repetitive strain injury]] (RSIs).

Non-musculoskeletal problems include [[contact dermatitis]], hearing problems such as [[tinnitus]], respiratory disorders or [[pneumothorax]], increased intraocular pressure, [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]], and psychological issues such as [[performance anxiety]].&lt;ref name=hei/&gt;

'''Himig Handog''' is a [[multimedia]] songwriting and music video competition in the [[Philippines]] based in [[Quezon City]]. The organization is operated by [[ABS-CBN]] and [[Star Music]], the music subsidiary of ABS-CBN. The contest ran from 2000 to 2003 and was later revived in 2013. The theme of the contest has been [[love songs]] since 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=STAR RECORDS AND ABS-CBN BLAST OFF 2013 WITH PINOY P-POP|url=http://abscbnpr.com/?p=7742|publisher=[[ABS-CBN]] Social Media Newsroom|accessdate=25 February 2013|date=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since it's revival, it is popularly regarded as "the country's premier songwriting contest"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Himig Handog 2017|url=http://tfc.tv/show/details/4525/himig-handog-2017|language=en|access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://coconuts.co/manila/lifestyle/arts-and-entertainment-12-finalists-to-the-5th-himig-handog-songwriting-contest-revealed/|title=12 finalists to the 5th Himig Handog songwriting contest revealed {{!}} Coconuts Manila|website=coconuts.co|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Pinoy]] songwriters and composers submitting thousands of original compositions annually, and the country's top singers interpreting the songs in a live event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Yip|first=Ho-kwen, Austin|title=From piano to music|publisher=The University of Hong Kong Libraries|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.5353/th_b4322430}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Himig Handog was first established in 2000. To date, it only had held five competitions which were in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003 and in 2013. Each year, the title and theme of the contest changes. In 2000, the contest was titled as ''Himig Handog sa Bayang Pilipino'' which was held on October 1. During the second, third and fourth contests' themes and titles were ''Makabagong Kabataan'', ''Love Songs'' and ''Love Songs 2 ''respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Himig Handog Finals Night Beamed Live On SKYcable|url=http://ph.omg.yahoo.com/news/himig-handog-finals-night-beamed-live-skycable-061419258.html|publisher=[[Yahoo!]]|accessdate=25 February 2013|date=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2001 to 2003, only three songs were rewarded with varying amounts of financial incentives(cash prizes) depending on which entry came in first, second, and third.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Himig Handog crowns 3 songs on finals night|url=http://www.philstar.com/entertainment/92152/himig-handog-crowns-3-songs-finals-night|work=[[The Philippine Star]]|accessdate=25 February 2013|date=10 October 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2013, the amount of incentives given were raised to five to make up a 'Top Five'. Other award categories were also introduced during this year. Also, it introduced a music video contest where participating [[tertiary institution]]s across the country were given the challenge of producing and directing the music videos for each song entry under a certain budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Himig Handog': The List Of Schools Competing For Top 15 Entries' Music Videos|url=http://starmusic.abs-cbn.com/news-inner.html?title=himig-handog-the-list-of-schools-competing-for-top-15-entries-music-videos|website=Star Music ABS-CBN|accessdate=8 September 2014|date=12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hungnam evacuation''' ({{Korean|hangul=흥남 철수 작전|hanja=興南撤收作戰}}), code-named '''Christmas Cargo''', also known as the '''Miracle of Christmas''', was the evacuation of UN forces and North Korean civilians from the port of [[Hungnam]], [[North Korea]], between 15 and 24 December 1950.

==Evacuations==
The port at [[Hungnam]] was the site of a major evacuation of United Nations military, South Korean military, and North Korean civilians during the [[Korean War]] in late December 1950. Approximately 100,000 troops and material and 100,000 civilians were loaded onto merchant ships and military transports totaling 193 shiploads over the weeks leading up to Christmas 1950. They were transported to safety in [[Busan]] and other destinations in South Korea. The evacuation included 14,000 refugees who were transported on one ship, the [[SS Meredith Victory|SS ''Meredith Victory'']] — the largest evacuation from land by a single ship. This was made possible by a declaration of national emergency by President Truman issued on 16 December 1950 with [[s:Proclamation 2914|Presidential Proclamation No. 2914]], 3 C.F.R. 99 (1953). This operation was the culmination of the [[Battle of Chosin Reservoir]], in which the embattled UN troops fought their way out of a Chinese trap. Colonel [[Edward H. Forney]], who served as Deputy Chief of Staff, [[X Corps (United States)|X Corps]] was tasked by Major general [[Edward M. Almond]] with the organization of the evacuation.

Among the civilians evacuated and brought to the South were the future parents of incumbent South Korean President [[Moon Jae-in]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author= Choe Sang-Hun |title=South Korea Elects Moon Jae-in, Who Backs Talks With North, as President |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/09/world/asia/south-korea-election-president-moon-jae-in.html |date = May 9, 2017 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170513012345/http://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/09/world/asia/south-korea-election-president-moon-jae-in.html |archivedate=2017-05-13 |publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/839493.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Indian rope trick''' is a  [[Magic (illusion)|magic]] trick said to have been performed in and around [[India]] during the 19th century. Sometimes described as "the world’s greatest illusion", it reputedly involved a magician, a length of [[rope]], and one or more boy assistants.

In the 1990s the trick was said by some historians to be a [[hoax]] perpetrated in 1890 by [[John Wilkie]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;Goto-Jones, Chris. (2016). ''Conjuring Asia''. Cambridge University Press. pp. 162-164. {{ISBN|978-1-107-07659-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Lamont (historian)|Peter Lamont]] has argued that there are no accurate references to the trick predating 1890, and later stage magic performances of the trick were inspired by Wilkie's account.&lt;ref name="Lamont 1"&gt;[[Peter Lamont (historian)|Lamont, Peter]]. (2005). ''The Rise of the Indian Rope Trick: How a Spectacular Hoax Became History''. Abacus. pp. 80-95, 208. {{ISBN|0-349-11824-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are old accounts from the 9th century (by [[Adi Shankara]]), the 14th century (by [[Ibn Battuta]]), and the 17th century (by the Mughal Emperor [[Jahangir]]), of versions of the trick, but this is denied by Lamont as the accounts described are different from the "classic" Indian rope trick.&lt;ref name="Lamont 2"&gt;[[Peter Lamont (historian)|Lamont, Peter]]. (2005). ''The Rise of the Indian Rope Trick: How a Spectacular Hoax Became History''. Abacus. pp. 7-8, 86-88. {{ISBN|0-349-11824-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The trick==
There are three variants of the trick, which differ in the degree of theatricality displayed by the magician and his helper:

*In the simplest version, a long piece of rope is left in a basket and placed in an open field, usually by a [[fakir]]. The rope levitates, with no external support. A boy assistant, a [[jamoora]], climbs the rope and then descends.
*A more elaborate version has the magician (or his assistant) disappearing after reaching the top of the rope, then reappearing at ground level.
*The "classic" version was much more detailed: the rope seems to rise high into the sky, disappearing from view. The boy climbs the rope and is lost to view. The magician calls to the boy, and feigns anger upon receiving no response. The magician arms himself with a knife or sword, climbs the rope, and vanishes as well. An argument is heard, and then human limbs fall, presumably cut from the assistant's body by the magician. When all the parts of the body, including the torso, land on the ground, the magician climbs down the rope. He collects the limbs and puts them in a basket or covers them with a cape or blanket. The boy reappears, uninjured.

[[Robert Elliot (surgeon)|Robert Elliot]] of the London Magic Circle, when offering a substantial reward in the 1930s for an outdoor performance, found it necessary to define the trick. He demanded that "the rope must be thrown into the air and defy the force of gravity, while someone climbs it and disappears."&lt;ref&gt;''The Listener'' (London), Feb 13, 1935, p. 294&lt;/ref&gt;

==The accounts==
In his commentary on Gaudapada's explanation of the ''[[Mandukya Upanishad]]'', the 9th-century Hindu teacher [[Adi Shankara]], illustrating a philosophical point, wrote of a juggler who throws a thread up into the sky; he climbs up it carrying arms and goes out of sight; he engages in a battle in which he is cut into pieces, which fall down; finally he arises again. A few words further on Shankara referred to the principle underlying the trick, saying that the juggler who ascends is different from the real juggler who stands unseen, "veiled magically", on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;Panoli, V. (tr.), ''Prasthanathraya'' vol. II, Mathrubhumi Printing and Publishing Co., Calicut, 2006, p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt; In Shankara's commentary on the [[Vedanta Sutra]] (also called the Brahma Sutra) he mentioned that the juggler who climbs up the rope to the sky is illusory, and so is only fancied to be different from the real juggler, who is hidden on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;Gambhirananda, Swami (tr.), ''Brahma-Sutra-Bhasya of Sankaracarya,'' Advaita Ashrama, Kolkata, 1965, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that Shankara referred to the trick's method was pointed out in 1934 in a discussion of the Indian rope trick in the Indian press.&lt;ref&gt;Varma, H. L., ''The Indian Rope Trick,'' Society of Indian Magicians, Bombay, 1942, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; These Sanskrit texts of Shankara are the basis for the claim that the trick is of great antiquity in India.

Edward Melton, an Anglo-Dutch traveler, described a performance he saw in [[History of Jakarta|Batavia]] about 1670 by a troupe of Chinese jugglers. Grasping one end of a ball of cord in his hand, a juggler threw up the ball which went out of sight, then swiftly climbed the vertical cord until he, too, was out of sight. Body pieces fell and were placed in a basket. Finally the basket was upturned, the body pieces fell out topsy turvy, and Melton "saw all those limbs creep together again," the man being restored to life. A detailed engraved illustration accompanied this account.&lt;ref&gt;Meltons, Eduward, ''Zeldzaame en Gedenkwaardige Zee- en Land- Reizen,'' Jan ten Hoorn, Amsterdam, 1681, p. 468 ff. For the English translation of Melton's account, see: Yule, Henry (tr. &amp; ed.), ''The Book of Ser Marco Polo'', vol. I, John Murray, London, 1871, pp. 281-2.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:StreetentertainersinChina.jpg|thumb|Illustration accompanying Melton's description]]

[[Ibn Battuta]], when recounting his travels through [[Hangzhou]], China in 1346, describes a trick broadly similar to the Indian rope trick.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Rev. Samuel, B.D. (translator), ''The Travels of Ibn Batuta,'' Oriental Translation Committee, London, 1829, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pu Songling]] records a version in ''[[Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio]]'' (1740) which he claims to have witnessed personally. In his account, a request by a mandarin that a wandering magician produce a peach in the dead of winter results in the trick's performance, on the pretence of getting a peach from the Gardens of Heaven.  The magician's son climbs the rope, vanishes from sight, and then (supposedly) tosses down a peach, before being "caught by the Garden's guards" and "killed", with his dismembered body falling from above in the traditional manner. (In this version the magician himself never climbs the rope.)  After placing the parts in a basket, the magician gives the mandarin the peach and requests payment. As soon as he is paid, his son emerges alive from the basket.  Songling claims the trick was a favorite of the [[White Lotus]] society and that the magician must have learnt it from them (or they from him), though he gives no indication where (or how) he learnt this.&lt;ref&gt;Pu Songling, (translated by Herbert A. Giles), ''Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio,'' Vol. 2, Thos De La Rue, London, 1880, pp. 186-189.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skepticism==

There has long been [[skepticism]] regarding the trick.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Mulholland (magician)|Mulholland, John]]. (1958). [https://archive.org/stream/TheGreatRopeTrickMystery/The%20Great%20Rope%20Trick%20Mystery#page/n15/mode/2up ''The Great Rope Trick Mystery'']. This Week, 6th April. "The Indian Rope Trick is pure fiction. But mankind has always had an instinctive urge to manufacture the myth that it exists."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pritchard, William Thomas. (Will Dexter [pseud]). (1958). ''This is Magic: Secrets of the Conjurer's Craft''. Citadel Press. p. 83 "Many magicians have devised apparatus to perform the Indian Rope Trick on a stage. But, as Jasper Maskelyne says, that's not quite the same trick as the one that's been created in myth and legend. Other illusionists have successfully staged the trick out of doors, but under those circumstances, a demonstration of pole balancing has been all they could offer to the spectators. No magician has yet sent a small boy up a rigid rope and caused him to vanish at the top, or to fall to the ground dismembered."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Milbourne Christopher|Christopher, Milbourne]]. (January, 1959). ''The Greatest Magic Illusions Of All Time. Part 2''. ''[[Popular Mechanics]]''. pp. 108-109. "Many wizards worked out stage versions, but to date, no magician has done it in the open air, away from trees or buildings."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Lee Siegel (professor and novelist)|Siegel, Lee]]. (1991). ''Net of Magic: Wonder and Deception in India''. University of Chicago Press. pp. 197-221. {{ISBN|978-0-226-75687-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scott, Kirsty. (2001).

===Demonstrations and rewards===

In 1911, [[Charles Bertram (magician)|Charles Bertram]] reported how he had visited India and communicated with over a hundred magicians in search of the trick. According to Bertram "none of them laid any claim to being able to perform it, and when they were questioned upon the subject, disclaimed any idea of ever having seen, and in many cases, having heard of it." He offered a reward of £500 but no magician took the challenge of demonstrating the trick.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Bertram (magician)|Bertram, Charles]]. (1911). [https://archive.org/stream/magicianinmanyla00bertuoft#page/107/mode/2up ''A Magician in Many Lands'']. George Routledge &amp; Sons. pp. 107-108&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917, Lieutenant [[Frederick William Holmes|F. W. Holmes]] stated that whilst on his [[veranda]] with a group of officers in [[Khadki|Kirkee]], he had observed the trick being performed by an old man and young boy. The boy climbed the rope, balanced himself and then descended. The old man tapped the rope and it collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;The Great Indian Rope-Trick. Photographed for the first time by Lieut. F.W. Holmes, V.C., M.M. (April, 1919). ''[[The Strand Magazine]]'' 57: 310-311.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;V.C. Who ‘Snapped’ Indian Rope Trick. (May, 1934). ''[[Daily Express]]''. p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; This demonstration did not include the disappearance of the boy. In February 1919, Holmes presented a photograph he had taken of the trick at a meeting with members of [[The Magic Circle (organisation)|The Magic Circle]]. It was examined by [[Robert Elliot (surgeon)|Robert Elliot]] who stated it was not a demonstration of the Indian rope trick but an example of a balancing trick on a bamboo pole. Elliot noted that "the tapering of the pole is an absolutely clear feature and definitely shows that it was not a rope."&lt;ref name="Elliot 1934"&gt;[[Robert Elliot (surgeon)|Elliot, Robert Henry]]. (1934). ''The Myth of the Mystical East''. Wm. Blackwood &amp; Sons. pp. 95-96&lt;/ref&gt; Holmes later admitted this, but the photograph was reproduced by the press in several magazines and newspapers as proof of the trick having been successfully demonstrated. Although discredited, the photograph is considered to be the first ever taken of the trick.&lt;ref name="Elliot 1934"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Lamont (historian)|Lamont, Peter]]; [[Richard Wiseman|Wiseman, Richard]]. (2001). ''The Rise and Fall of the Indian Rope Trick''. Journal of the Society for Psychical Research 65: 175-193.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919, G. Huddleston writing in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', claimed to have spent more than thirty years in India and knew many of the best conjurors in the country but not one of them could demonstrate the trick.&lt;ref&gt;Huddleston, G. (1919). [https://archive.org/stream/nature10219181919lock#page/487/mode/2up ''The Indian Rope Trick'']. ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' 102: 487 (20 February 1919)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lord Frederick Spencer Hamilton]] in 1921, described an alleged demonstration of the trick, told to him by Colonel Bernard.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lord Frederick Spencer Hamilton|Hamilton, Frederick Spencer]]. (1921). [https://archive.org/stream/herethereeveryw00hami#page/40/mode/2up ''Here, There and Everywhere'']. Hodder and Stoughton. pp. 40-42&lt;/ref&gt; Bernard described taking photographs of the boy climbing the rope, disappearing and reappearing at a courtyard in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]]. However, the courtyard had been filled with dense smoke and when he had developed the photographs they revealed that "neither the juggler, nor the boy, nor the rope had moved at all." This caused Hamilton to suggest that the juggler had somehow drugged or [[Hypnosis|hypnotized]] Bernard. Elliot criticized this second-hand account as nothing more than "hearsay evidence." He found the details and lack of witnesses suspicious, concluding that Bernard had hoaxed Hamilton.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Elliot (surgeon)|Elliot, Robert Henry]]. (1934). ''The Myth of the Mystical East''. Wm. Blackwood &amp; Sons. pp. 88-90&lt;/ref&gt;

[[L. H. Branson]] in his book ''Indian Conjuring'' (1922) wrote that "the trick has never been performed out of doors. That is to say that a rope thrown up into the air has not remained suspended in mid-air, nor has any boy ever climbed up it. That when at the top he has not disappeared and that after his appearance he did not come down in bits, covered with blood or otherwise." Branson offered £300 to anyone who could demonstrate the trick in the open.&lt;ref&gt;[[L. H. Branson|Branson, L. H]]. (1922). [https://archive.org/stream/indianconjuring00branrich#page/87/mode/2up ''Indian Conjuring'']. New York: E. P. Dutton &amp; Co. pp. 87-88&lt;/ref&gt;

Magicians such as [[Harry Blackstone Sr.|Harry Blackstone]], [[David Devant]], [[Horace Goldin]], [[Carl Hertz]], [[Servais Le Roy]] and [[Howard Thurston]] incorporated the Indian rope trick into their [[Stage (theatre)|stage]] shows. However, their stage versions involved the use of curtains, mirrors and wires. The real challenge was to perform the full trick including the disappearance of the boy in broad daylight, outside in the open air.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lee Siegel (professor and novelist)|Siegel, Lee]]. (1991). ''Net of Magic: Wonder and Deception in India''. University of Chicago Press. pp. 205-207. {{ISBN|978-0-226-75687-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thurston considered this to have never been achieved and in 1927 offered a reward of 5,000 [[rupee]]s to anyone who could demonstrate it.&lt;ref&gt;[[Howard Thurston|Thurston, Howard]]. (April, 1927). ''The Truth About Indian Magic''. ''[[Popular Mechanics]]''. p. 622&lt;/ref&gt;

The journalist [[James Saxon Childers]] in 1932, reported that he visited India with a desire to see the trick but noted that "the first conjuror I asked about the rope trick smiled at me, the second laughed, and the third swore that the trick could not be done, had never been done, and that only the amazing credulity of the Occident nurtures the rumor."&lt;ref&gt;Childers, James Saxon. (1932). ''From Siam to Suez''. D. Appleton and Company. p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934 the Occult Committee of [[The Magic Circle (organisation)|The Magic Circle]], convinced the trick did not exist, offered a large reward to anyone who could perform it in the open air.&lt;ref&gt;Indian Rope Trick Is Worth $25,00 If You can Do It. ''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|The Milwaukee Journal]]''. May 1, 1934. "The occult committee of the "magic circle" Tuesday offered a reward of $2,500 for a genuine performance of the famous Indian rope trick... The committee reported it had conducted a long investigation into claims of persons who said they had seen the trick performed and had reached the conclusion the feat never had been and never would be accomplished."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Milbourne Christopher|Christopher, Milbourne]]. (1996). ''The Illustrated History of Magic''. Greenwood Publishing Group. p. 4. {{ISBN|0-435-07016-9}} "The Magic Circle offered five hundred guineas for a single open-air performance. Later, the ''Times of India'' added ten thousand rupees to the amount. No one came forward to win the reward."&lt;/ref&gt;

The American magician Robert Heger claimed to have perfected the trick over 20 years and would demonstrate it to an audience on stage in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]]. He claimed he would perform in London to The Magic Circle if his demonstration was successful.&lt;ref&gt;Yankee Magician Claims He Can Do India Rope Trick. ''[[The Register-Guard|Eugene Register-Guard]]''. November 11, 1934. p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; However, his demonstration was a failure as the boy who climbed the rope was observed by the audience to have swung to the end of another rope behind a curtain.&lt;ref&gt;Amateur Magician Foiled as Stagehand Uses Wrong Lights. ''Berkeley Daily Gazette''. November 13, 1934. p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hindu Rope Trick Is Foiled By Light. ''[[Montreal Gazette]]''. November 13, 1934.&lt;/ref&gt;

A man named ''Karachi'' (real name Arthur Claude Darby), a British performer based in [[Plymouth]], endeavoured to perform the trick with his son, ''Kyder'', on 7 January 1935 on a field in [[Wheathampstead]], Hertfordshire. After being granted four days to prepare the site, the presentation was filmed by Gaumont British Films.&lt;ref&gt;''The Listener'' (London), January 16, 1935, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; His son could climb the rope but did not disappear, and Karachi was not paid. The Occult Committee demanded the trick must include the disappearance of the boy.&lt;ref&gt;''The Listener'' (London), February 13, 1935, p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, Karachi sent a challenge to the skeptics, for 200 guineas to be deposited with a neutral party who would decide if the rope trick was performed satisfactorily. His terms were that the rope shall rise up through his hands while in a sitting posture, to a height of ten feet, his son Kyder would then climb the rope and remain at the top for a minimum of 30 seconds and be photographed. The rope would be an ordinary rope supplied by a well-known manufacturer and would be examined. The place could be any open area chosen by the neutral party and agreed to by the conjurers, and the spectators could be anywhere in front of the carpet on which Karachi would be seated.&lt;ref&gt;''The Listener'' (London), January 30, 1935, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; The conjurers of the Occult Committee refused to accept Karachi's terms.

In 1936, [[Jasper Maskelyne]] stated that he had "perfected half of an Indian rope-trick", he could make the rope rise into the air in an open space and have a boy climb it but could not make the boy disappear. Maskelyne never demonstrated his method but offered £2,000 to anyone who could perform the full trick in open space. Nobody ever claimed this reward and he considered the full trick to be a [[myth]], never successfully demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jasper Maskelyne|Maskelyne, Jasper]]. (2009 edition, originally published in 1936). ''Maskelyne's Book of Magic''. Dover Publications. pp. 125-128. {{ISBN|0-486-47177-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, [[John Booth (magician)|John Booth]] offered a reward of 25,000 rupees to any conjuror in India who could successfully demonstrate the trick.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Booth (magician)|Booth, John]]. (1950). ''Fabulous Destinations''. New York: Macmillan. p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; Many other rewards have been offered but all went unclaimed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Lamont (historian)|Lamont, Peter]]; [[Richard Wiseman|Wiseman, Richard]]. (2001). ''The Rise and Fall of the Indian Rope Trick''. Journal of the Society for Psychical Research 65: 175-193. "Rewards were subsequently offered by Western magicians in an attempt to find the rope trick, including J. N. Maskelyne, Nevil Maskelyne, Jasper Maskelyne, Dante, Felix Blei, Carter, Carl Hertz, Horace Goldin, Murray and John Booth. None of the searches was successful, and none of the rewards managed to attract a performance."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examination of eyewitness accounts===

In 1996, ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' published ''Unraveling the Indian Rope Trick'', by [[Richard Wiseman]] and [[Peter Lamont (historian)|Peter Lamont]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Wiseman|Wiseman, Richard]]; [[Peter Lamont (historian)|Lamont, Peter]]. (1996). ''Unravelling the Rope Trick''. ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' 383: 212-213.&lt;/ref&gt; Wiseman found at least 50 eyewitness accounts of the trick performed during the late 19th/early 20th centuries, and variations included: 
*The magician's assistant climbs the rope and the magic ends.
*The assistant climbs the rope, vanishes, and then again appears.
*The assistant vanishes, and appears from some other place.
*The assistant vanishes, and reappears from a place which had remained in full view of the audience.
*The boy vanishes, and does not return.

Accounts collected by Wiseman did not have any single account describing severing of the limbs of the magician's assistant. Perhaps more importantly, he found the more spectacular accounts were only given when the incident lay decades in the past. It is conceivable that in the witnesses' memory the rope trick merged with the [[Indian Basket Trick|basket trick]].

Citing their work, historian [[Mike Dash]] wrote in 2000:
{{quote|Ranking their cases in order of impressiveness, Wiseman and Lamont discovered that the average lapse of time between the event and witness's report of the event was a mere four years in the least notable examples, but a remarkable forty-one years in the case of the most complex and striking accounts. This suggests that the witnesses embroidered their stories over the years, perhaps in telling and retelling their experiences. After several decades, what might have originally been a simple trick had become a highly elaborate performance in their minds... How, though, did these witnesses come to elaborate their tales in such a consistent way? One answer would be that they already knew, or subsequently discovered, how the full-blown Indian rope trick was supposed to look, and drew on this knowledge when embroidering their accounts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mike Dash|Dash, Mike]]. (2000). ''Borderlands: The Ultimate Exploration of the Unknown''.  New York: Overlook Press. p. 321. {{ISBN|0-87951-724-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2008, a neuroscience paper suggested that the Indian rope trick may have "partially resulted from the [[misinformation effect]]."&lt;ref&gt;Macknik, Stephen L. ''et al''. (2008). ''Attention and Awareness in Stage Magic: Turning Tricks into Research''. ''[[Nature Reviews Neuroscience]]'' 9: 871–879.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanation==
[[File:John Elbert Wilkie.jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[John Elbert Wilkie]]]]

===Hoax===

In his book on the topic, [[Peter Lamont (historian)|Peter Lamont]] claimed the story of the trick resulted from a hoax created by [[John Elbert Wilkie]] while working at the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. Under the name "Fred S. Ellmore" ("Fred Sell More") Wilkie wrote of the trick in 1890, gaining the ''Tribune'' wide publicity. About four months later,  the ''Tribune'' printed a retraction and proclaimed the story a hoax. The retraction received little attention, and in the following years many claimed to remember having seen the trick as far back as the 1870s. According to Lamont, none of these stories proved credible, but with every repetition the story became more widely believed despite being only a myth.&lt;ref name="Lamont 1"/&gt;

Lamont also claimed that no mention appears in writing before the 1890 article. He argued that [[Ibn Battuta]] did report a magic trick with a thong, and Jahangir with a [[Link chain|chain]], not a rope, and the tricks they described are different from the "classic" Indian rope trick. He said that the descriptions of the trick in Yule's editions (1870s) of Marco Polo's book are not in the body of the work, but in a footnote by Yule, and only refer to these non-classic accounts.&lt;ref name="Lamont 2"/&gt;

Lamont's popular but controversial work dismissed the accounts such as Shankara's and Melton's as irrelevant to his theme. This is because his book is not really about the trick itself, but about what he called the 20th-century legend of it being Indian, the fame of the trick, which peaked in the 1930s. It is this fame, chapter 8 of his book claimed, which originated from Wilkie's hoax.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Lamont (historian)|Lamont, Peter]]. (2005). ''The Rise of the Indian Rope Trick: How a Spectacular Hoax Became History''. Abacus. pp. 86-88, 164-167. {{ISBN|0-349-11824-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magic techniques===
[[Image:Indian rope trickery example.png|thumb|left|Illustration of how the trick could be performed near buildings.]]
The magician [[John Nevil Maskelyne]] in 1912 reported a possible explanation for the trick from a witness to whom he had spoken. It was suggested that the [[position of the Sun]] was crucial to the trick:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The jugglers brought a coil of what appeared to be a large rope. As they uncoiled it and held it up it became stiff ; it was evidently jointed bamboo with the joints made to lock. It was covered to look like a rope, and it formed a pole about thirty feet long. A diminutive boy, not much larger than an Indian monkey, climbed up to the top of the pole and was out of sight of the audience unless they bent forward and looked beneath the awning, when the sun shone in their eyes and blinded them. As soon as the boy was at the top of the pole the jugglers made a great shouting, declaring he had vanished. He quickly slid down the pole and fell on the ground behind the juggler who held the rope. Another juggler threw a cloth over the boy and pretended that he was dead. After considerable tom-tomming and incantation the boy began to move, and was eventually restored to life.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Nevil Maskelyne|Maskelyne, John Nevil]]. (1912). [https://archive.org/stream/1912MaskelyneFraudOfModernTheosophy/1912__maskelyne___fraud_of_modern_theosophy#page/n23/mode/2up ''The Fraud of Modern "Theosophy" Exposed'']. G. Routledge &amp; Sons. pp. 23-24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1935, [[Harry Price]] suggested that a strong sun and jointed rope could explain the trick. He translated an article by the German magician [[Erik Jan Hanussen]] who claimed to have observed the secret to the trick in a village near [[Babylon]]. According to Hanussen the spectators were positioned in front of a blazing sun and the "rope" was actually made from the vertebrae of a sheep covered with sailing cord that was twisted into a solid pole. A "smoke producing preparation", combined with the blinding sun, gave the illusion of disappearance for the boy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harry Price|Price, Harry]]. (1935). ''Confessions of a Ghost-Hunter''. Putnam. pp. 344-354&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Will Goldston]] who was mostly skeptical, wrote that a possible explanation for the illusion of the suspended rope may have been a [[bamboo]] rod, covered with rope.&lt;ref&gt;[[Will Goldston|Goldston, Will]]. (1935). [http://www.magicians-scrapbook.co.uk/the-secret-of-the-indian-rope-trick/ ''The Secret of the Indian Rope Trick'']. Sunday Express, 17th March.&lt;/ref&gt; Others such as [[P. C. Sorcar]] have suggested that a long horizontal [[Thread (yarn)|thread]] or wire was used to support the rope.&lt;ref&gt;[[P. C. Sorcar|Sorcar, P. C]]. (1960). ''Sorcar on Magic''. Calcutta: Indrajal Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Lee Siegel (professor and novelist)|Siegel, Lee]]. (1991). ''Net of Magic: Wonder and Deception in India''. University of Chicago Press. pp. 207-208. {{ISBN|978-0-226-75687-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Dunninger]] has revealed methods of how the suspended rope could be performed by camera trickery.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Dunninger|Dunninger, Joseph]]. (1941). [https://books.google.com/books?id=kkwEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA80 ''India's Rope Trick is Faked in Pictures'']. ''[[Life (magazine)|Life Magazine]]''. 16, June. pp. 80-81&lt;/ref&gt;

Analyzing old eyewitness reports, Jim McKeague explained how poor, itinerant conjuring troupes could have performed the trick using known magical techniques.&lt;ref&gt;McKeague, J., ''Indian Rope'' (2012) and ''Translating Melton'' (2014), http://theindianropetrick.com (retrieved October 11, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;  If a ball of cord is thrown upwards, one end being retained in the hand, the ball rapidly decreases in size as it rises. As it unwinds completely the illusion of the ball disappearing into the sky is striking, especially if the pale cord is similar in color to any overcast cloud.  Before the cord has time to fall the climber leaps up, pretending to climb, but really being lifted by a companion. Skilled acrobats could make this quick "climb" look very effective until the climber's feet are at or even above the lifter's head. Then a noisy distraction from other members of the troupe is the [[Misdirection (magic)|misdirection]] needed which allows the climber to drop unseen to the ground and hide.  This type of "vanishing by misdirection" is reported as having been used very effectively by a performer of the basket trick in the 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;''The Argus'', Melbourne, March 18, 1876, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

The lifter continues to look upwards and holds a conversation with the "climber" using [[ventriloquism]] to create the illusion that a person is still high in the air and is just passing out of sight. By now there is no cord or climber in the air, only an illusory climber as Shankara described (see above under "accounts"). Ventriloquism is quite capable of producing this remarkable effect, and a report from near Darjeeling by a school headmaster who witnessed the trick states specifically that ventriloquism was used.&lt;ref&gt;Varma, H.L., ''The Indian Rope Trick'', Society of Indian Magicians, Bombay, 1942, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;  As to the falling of the pieces of the climber, according to an Indian Barrister-at-Law who saw a performance about 1875 which included this feature, it appears to have been produced very largely by acting and sound effects.&lt;ref&gt;Varma, H.L., ''The Indian Rope Trick'', Society of Indian Magicians, Bombay, 1942, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;  When a magician acts out the ''visible'' catch of an ''imaginary'' deck of cards thrown by a spectator, or throws a ball in the air where it vanishes, the appearance or disappearance really occurs at the location of the magician's hand, but to most spectators (two out of three in actual testing&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, J., ''Revealing the Psychology of Playing Card Magic'', in the ''Scientific American'', July 31, 2012, http://scientificamerican.com (retrieved October 12, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;) the magic appears to occur in mid-air. McKeague explained the falling body parts as being produced by much the same acting technique.  He explained Melton's account of seeing the limbs "creep together again" (see above under "accounts") as being the result of contortionists' techniques.

It has always been the outdoor disappearance of the climber, away from trees and structures, which has led to claims the illusion is "humanly impossible".&lt;ref&gt;Devant, David, ''A Magician's Secrets - II'', in ''The Courier-Mail'', Brisbane, Australia, October 17, 1936, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; McKeague's explanation not only solves the mystery of the mid-air disappearance but also provides an alternative explanation for the Wiseman-Lamont observation discussed above that eyewitness reports were more impressive when much time had elapsed. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries as the fame of the trick increased performers would have had increasing difficulty in puzzling audiences with it, until finally the disappearance of the climber ceased to be a feature and the rare witness who had seen it spoke of a time long before. This is because misdirection of attention is extremely unlikely to be effective when the audience is expecting the disappearance, a fact which also explains why no one could claim any reward for a performance where it was specified the disappearance must be included. The increasing fame of the rope trick and the basket trick ended the possibility of using "vanishing by misdirection" in the methodologies for both tricks.&lt;ref&gt;McKeague, J., ''Indian Rope'', Part 2, http://theindianropetrick.com (retrieved October 11, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Keel]] reports that he was told the secret of the trick in 1955 from an aged mystic who claimed to have performed it in the past. A horizontal wire is stretched above the site, anchored at ground points of higher elevation, rather than obvious nearby structures. The rope has a weighted hook, and an invisible thread which is draped over the wire above; when the rope is tossed upward the thread is used to pull it and hook it in place. The magician wears loose baggy clothing, in which are concealed the "body parts" that he tosses down. The boy then conceals himself inside the magician's voluminous outer garment, and clings to him as the magician climbs down seemingly alone. Keel describes his public attempt to perform a simpler version, but failing badly, according to "two articles and a cartoon that appeared in Indian newspapers." &lt;ref&gt;Keel, J. A. (1957). "Jadoo: Mysteries of the Orient". New York: Julian Messner. p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Penn &amp; Teller]] examined the trick while filming their three-part [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] mini-series, ''[[Penn &amp; Teller's Magic and Mystery Tour]]''. According to that miniseries, the tour travelled the world investigating historical tricks, and while in India they travelled to [[Agra]] where they recreated the trick.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Penn and Teller invited two British tourists shopping nearby to see what they claimed was a [[fakir]] performing the trick. As they walked back, an assistant ran up and claimed the fakir was in the midst of the trick, so they rushed the rest of the way so they wouldn't miss it. As the witnesses neared the room they dropped a thick rope from a balcony. The witnesses saw what they thought was the end of the trick, the rope falling as if it had been in mid-air seconds before. A sheet was then removed from a boy with fake blood at his neck and shoulders, hinting that his limbs and head had been reattached to his torso.  According to their account, the rumour that a British couple had witnessed the trick was heard a few weeks later in England.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22930">'''International classical guitar competitions''' are public events designed to identify and award outstanding [[List of classical guitarists|classical guitar soloists]], ensembles, and [[List of composers for the classical guitar|composers]]. They allow artists to promote themselves and gain exposure. Some competitions also have newly composed "set" pieces which serve to increase the [[classical guitar]] [[Classical guitar repertoire|repertoire]].

==Early history==
The guitar seems to be the absentee in musical competitions until the [[World War II|Second World War]]. 
* In 1949 the "First Guitar Competition", now the Tokyo International Guitar Competition was held and the [[:jp:日本ギター連盟|Modern Japan Guitar Federation]] was established in [[Tokyo]], Japan. It was not held in 1954, 1955, and 1956, but continued from the 6th edition since 1957. From the 25th edition in 1982 became the Tokyo International Guitar Competition.
* The first international guitar performance competitions in Europe were promoted and initiated in the 1950s by virtuoso Spanish guitarist [[Andrés Segovia]]. In 1956 he managed to get the guitar discipline to be included in prestigious multi-instrumental [[Geneva International Music Competition]]. 
* The 1960s led to born within the compass of Segovia two European competitions that marked the history of guitar and which remains active until today, i.e. 1967 - International Guitar Competition "[[Francisco Tárrega]]" in [[Benicàssim]], Spain and 1968 - [[Michele Pittaluga International Classical Guitar Competition|Competition "Premio Città di Alessandria"]] in [[Alessandria]], Italy, which in 1995 would be renamed International Classical Guitar Competition "Michele Pittaluga - Premio Città di Alessandria" on the occasion of its founder passing. Over the time, Segovia kept promoting competitions by giving his support to ones which had evident professionalism contents.
* Between 1959 and 1990s the Concours International de Guitare was organized by O.R.T.F., which then became [[Radio France]]. The competition was born at the behest of Robert J. Vidal, deputy producer of French radio station. In 2007 a new competition, [http://www.concours-robert-j-vidal.com International Classical Guitar Competition Robert J. Vidal] in [[Barbezieux]], France was established in his memory.
* In 1972 Giuliano Balestra founded International Guitar Competition "Fernando Sor" in Rome, Italy
* Since 1973 the city of [[Gargnano]], Italy has been hosting the "Incontri Chitarristici" which included the International Classical Guitar Competition, since 1976.
* In 1982 the [[Guitar Foundation of America]] International Concert Artist Competition was established and shortly became one of the most desired awards in the classical guitar world thus given a start to classical guitar popularisation in the US.
* In 1985, the European Year of Music, Andrés Segovia International Classical Guitar Competition was established in [[La Herradura]], Spain in the honor of maestro.

==Present times==
In the recent years, much international classical guitar competitions were established.
* The overall level of the competitions was raised by increasing prizes value up to $30000 in the US,  $22000 in Europe, and $10000 in Asia.
* Finals with the orchestra became more common.
* Introduction of online streaming of the competition rounds and YouTube applications greatly improved neutrality and public reception of the judgment.
* Many classical guitar competitions now take place during guitar festivals, and therefore the competition event can be attended by the general public, as an audience.
* Youth international competitions became more popular, attracting children and amateurs by the lower comp level and affordable prizes.

==Competitors==
* In the international classical guitar competitions, the typical age of the competitors is from 18 to 35. Some competitions don't have age restrictions.
* The youth competitions are usually up to 25 years old.
* As a result of increased number of competitions, some competitors have won unusual (more than 15) number of 1st Prizes in the professional (adult) competitions: 19 - [[Marcin Dylla]], 38 - [[Marko Topchii]].

==Thoughts on competitions==

*[[Denis Azabagić]] has written: ''"Competitions give you a very valuable experience. Do they guide in your artistic development? I do not know if it benefits the guitarist in that area, but I think it does benefit the student because it helps him to set goals under pressure (having a deadline). This creates a great deal of stress, which you will have to learn how to deal with. To perform live in front of a jury is something that requires some training. Finally, if you are successful at winning competitions, this will help you to promote your name in the guitar circle, you will start to be noticed. I think winning competitions helps you build a name but does not help much to develop your artistry."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guitarramagazine.com/CavatinaDuo Interview with Cavatina Duo]&lt;/ref&gt;
*''In this interview recorded in early 2002, Azabagic stresses that while competitions were very good to him, competitions can also be devastating to worthy musicians who never seem to win.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guitaralive.org/playlist_07_10_16.html "Music Competitions/Interviews: Azabagic, Evans/Madriguera, Kanengiser, Tennant, Vieaux"]; Classical guitar alive; October 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern criticism of guitar competitions is actually quite common.  Some criticisms are that they are often judged by unqualified judges, that reward people for being technically proficient without regard to musicality. But concerning the judging of musicality, this is in itself controversial, as the question arises, on how to judge art on any objective level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.classicalguitarreview.com/discussions/competitions-are-not-meant-for-music/ Competitions are not meant for music]&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[John Williams (guitarist)|John Williams]] has said: ''"[...] basically I don't like or approve of competitions on any instrument. I don't think music can be evaluated like a race - I know that's an obvious thing to say and that there are many ifs and buts involved because they do help some artists and concentrate the public's attention on music. But I particularly don't like the way many guitar competitions are run, the confusing waypoints are awarded differently in each round of a competition, and especially the over-exploitation of the "Big Winner" and the competitive values that puts on players and the activity of guitar playing itself. Winning is a matter of taste in most cases, and there are often many other equally deserving competitors other than just the First Prize recipient. I feel it would be fairer to have a select group of finalists, each of whom receives the same award and status.&lt;br /&gt;I have served on juries in the past, but these days I refuse to take part, and I feel it is important to take that stand otherwise your reservations have no meaning. Having said all that, I know it happens anyway and sometimes there is sponsorship involved which does help the general public interest and support. But it still doesn't need to be a cut and dried thing, where each finalist is ranked as precisely as 1,2,3. I think it is those competitive values that are wrong, not the celebration of excellence in music as such. I have talked about the idea of setting up a competition where this other approach is used, but nothing definite has emerged from it yet; it may take some time to develop."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guitarteacher.com.au/johnwilliams.htm John Williams Interview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825045035/http://www.guitarteacher.com.au/johnwilliams.htm |date=2007-08-25 }} with Austin Prichard-Levy&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysis of data at a piano competition, with many high-level participants, has made it doubtful that judges are able to make fully objective judgments; because there was a '''small''' correlation between the order of appearance of participants and their ranking:
*''We find that the order and timing of appearance at the competition are good predictors of the final ranking. [...] Because of this, order and timing are unique instrumental variables for the final ranking, which we consistently find to have a significant impact on later success, irrespective of the finalists’ true quality. Pianists with high scores are more likely to see their work recorded later on. It is also worth pointing out that the opinion of music critics is more influenced by the ranking than by the quality of the performers. This is not necessarily surprising, since there are many musicians who may have been good during the competition, but have vanished afterward, leaving the critics recollections unaffected.&lt;br /&gt;The conclusion that it pays to do well in the competition is strongly supported by the data. However, the fact that judges’ rankings are affected by order and timing of appearance in a competition needs to be stressed, and sheds some doubt on their ability to cast fully objective judgments.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecares.org/ecare/personal/ginsburgh/papers/124.expert%20opinion.pdf Expert Opinion and Compensation: Evidence from a Musical Competition] by Victor A. Ginsburgh and Jan C. van Ours (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;
On the other hand, if a competition has many professional-level artistic participants, it may not even be possible to make an objective judgement of who is "best"; because: given numerous professional-level artistic performers, there may not even be room for the concept of comparison; since this presumes the existence of a "best" interpretation, which is itself questionable (and would be a commercialization of art; viewing it from a mass-consumption or absolutist point of view).

'''Introspection''' is the examination of one's own [[conscious]] [[thought]]s and [[feeling]]s.&lt;ref name=Schultz&gt;{{cite book | first=D. P. | last=Schultz |author2=Schultz, S. E. | title= A history of modern psychology (10th ed.) | year=2012| publisher= Wadsworth, Cengage Learning | isbn=978-1-133-31624-4 | url= | location= Belmont, CA | pages= 67–77, 88–100}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[psychology]], the process of introspection relies exclusively on observation of one's [[Mental representation|mental state]], while in a [[Spirituality|spiritual]] context it may refer to the examination of one's [[soul]]. Introspection is closely related to [[human self-reflection]] and is contrasted with [[observation|external observation]].

Introspection generally provides a privileged access to one's own mental states,&lt;ref&gt;W. Seager,[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123738738000712, Encyclopedia of ''Consciousness' ']&lt;/ref&gt; not mediated by other sources of knowledge, so that individual experience of the mind is unique. Introspection can determine any number of mental states including: sensory, bodily, cognitive, emotional and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;W. Seager,[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123738738000712, Encyclopedia of ''Consciousness'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Introspection has been a subject of philosophical discussion for thousands of years. The philosopher [[Plato]] asked, "…why should we not calmly and patiently review our own thoughts, and thoroughly examine and see what these appearances in us really are?"&lt;ref&gt;''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'', 155&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J Perner et al (2007). "''Introspection &amp; remembering''". Synthese. Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; While introspection is applicable to many facets of philosophical thought it is perhaps best known for its role in [[epistemology]], in this context introspection is often compared with [[perception]], [[reason]], [[memory]], and [[testimony]] as a source of [[knowledge]].&lt;ref&gt;Epistemology. (2005). In ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. Retrieved from http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology/#SOU&lt;/ref&gt;

==In psychology==

===Wundt===
It has often been claimed that [[Wilhelm Wundt]], the father of modern psychology, was the first to adopt introspection to [[experimental psychology]]&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt; though the methodological idea had been presented long before, as by 18th century German philosopher-psychologists such as [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten]] or [[Johann Nicolaus Tetens]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Thomas Sturm, ''Kant und die Wissenschaften vom Menschen'' (Paderborn: Mentis, 2009), ch. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Wundt's views on introspection must be approached with great care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Danziger | first1 = Kurt | year = 1980 | title = The History of Introspection Reconsidered | url = | journal = Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences | volume = 16 | issue = 3| pages = 241–262 | doi=10.1002/1520-6696(198007)16:3&lt;241::aid-jhbs2300160306&gt;3.0.co;2-o}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wundt was influenced by notable [[physiology|physiologists]], such as [[Gustav Fechner]], who used a kind of controlled introspection as a means to study human [[sense|sensory]] organs. Building upon the pre-existing use of introspection in physiology, Wundt believed the method of introspection was the ability to observe an experience, not just the logical reflection or speculations which some others interpreted his meaning to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Asthana|first=Hari Shanker|date=June 2015|title=Wilhelm Wundt|url=|journal=Psychological Studies|volume=60|pages=244–248|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wundt imposed exacting control over the use of introspection in his experimental laboratory at the [[University of Leipzig]],&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt; making it possible for other scientists to [[reproducibility|replicate]] his experiments elsewhere, a development that proved essential to the development of psychology as a modern, [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] scientific discipline. Such exact purism was typical of Wundt and he instructed all introspection observations be performed under these same instructions "1) the Observer must, if possible, be in a position to determine beforehand the entrance of the process to be observed. 2) the introspectionist must, as far as possible, grasp the phenomenon in a state of strained attention and follow its course. 3) Every observation must, in order to make certain, be capable of being repeated several times under the same conditions and 4) the conditions under which the phenomenon appears must be found out by the variation of the attendant circumstances and when this was done the various coherent experiments must be varied according to a plan partly by eliminating certain stimuli and partly by grading their strength and quality".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Asthana|first=Hari Shanker|date=June 2015|title=Wilhelm Wundt|url=|journal=Psychological Studies|volume=60|pages=244–248|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Titchener===
[[Edward B. Titchener|Edward Titchener]] was an early pioneer in experimental psychology and student of Wilhelm Wundt.&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt; After earning his doctorate under the tutelage of Wundt at the University of Leipzig, he made his way to [[Cornell University]] where he established his own laboratory and research.&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt; When Titchener arrived at Cornell in 1894, psychology was still a fledgling discipline, especially in the United States, and Titchener was a key figure in bringing Wundt's ideas to America. However, Titchener misrepresented some of Wundt's ideas to the American psychological establishment, especially in his account of introspection which, Titchener taught, only served a purpose in the [[Qualitative research|qualitative]] analysis of [[consciousness]] into its various parts,&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt; while Wundt saw it as a means to [[Quantitative research|quantitatively]] measure the whole of conscious experience.&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt; Titchener was exclusively interested in the individual components that comprise conscious experience, while Wundt, seeing little purpose in the analysis of individual components, focused on synthesis of these components. Ultimately Titchener's ideas would form the basis of the short-lived psychological theory of [[Structuralism (psychology)|structuralism]].&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt;

===Historical misconceptions===
American [[historiography]] of introspection, according to some authors,&lt;ref name="Costal 2006 634–654"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Costal|first=A|title='Introspectionism' and the mythical origins of scientific psychology|journal=Consciousness and Cognition|year=2006|volume=15|issue=4|pages=634–654|doi=10.1016/j.concog.2006.09.008|pmid=17174788}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clegg 2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Clegg|first=Joshua|title=Self-observation in the social science|year=2013|publisher=Transaction|location=New Jersey}}&lt;/ref&gt; is dominated by three misconceptions. In particular, historians of psychology tend to argue 1) that introspection once was the dominant method of psychological inquiry, 2) that behaviorism, and in particular [[John B. Watson]], is responsible for discrediting introspection as a valid method, and 3) that scientific [[psychology]] completely abandoned introspection as a result of those critiques.&lt;ref name="Costal 2006 634–654"/&gt; Yet, introspection has not been the dominant method. It is believed to be so because [[Edward B. Titchener|Edward Titchener]]'s student [[Edwin G. Boring]], in his influential historical accounts of experimental psychology privileged Titchener's views while giving little credit to original sources.&lt;ref name="Costal 2006 634–654"/&gt; Introspection has been critiqued by many other psychologists, including [[Wilhelm Wundt]], and [[Knight Dunlap]] who in his article "[http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Dunlap/introspection.htm ''The Case Against Introspection'']", presents an argument against self-observation that is not primarily rooted in behaviorist epistemology. Introspection is still widely used in psychology, but under different names, such as self-report surveys, interviews and fMRIs.&lt;ref name="Clegg 2013"/&gt; It is not the method but rather its name that has been dropped from the dominant psychological vocabulary.

===Recent developments===
{{See also|Introspection illusion}}
Partly as a result of Titchener's misrepresentation, the use of introspection diminished after his death and the subsequent decline of structuralism.&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt; Later psychological movements, such as [[functional psychology|functionalism]] and [[behaviorism]], rejected introspection for its lack of scientific [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] among other factors.&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt; Functionalism originally arose in direct opposition to structuralism, opposing its narrow focus on the elements of consciousness&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt; and emphasising the purpose of consciousness and other psychological behavior. Behaviorism's objection to introspection focused much more on its unreliability and [[objectivity (science)|subjectivity]] which conflicted with behaviorism's focus on measurable behavior.&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = The MIT Encyclopedia of the Cognitive Sciences |editor-first=Robert Andrew |editor-last=Wilson |editor2=Keil, Frank C. | url = https://books.google.com/?id=-wt1aZrGXLYC&amp;printsec=frontcover | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=9780262731447 |year=2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The more recently established [[cognitive psychology]] movement has to some extent accepted introspection's usefulness in the study of psychological phenomena, though generally only in experiments pertaining to internal thought conducted under experimental conditions. For example, in the "[[think aloud protocol]]", investigators cue participants to speak their thoughts aloud in order to study an active thought process without forcing an individual to comment on the process itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hayes | first1 = S. C. | year = 1986 | title = The case of the silent dog—Verbal reports and the analysis of rules: A review of Ericsson and Simon's Protocol Analysis: Verbal Reports as Data1 | url = | journal = Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior | volume = 45 | issue = 3| pages = 351–363 | doi = 10.1901/jeab.1986.45-351 | pmc = 1348244 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Already in the 18th century authors had criticized the use of introspection, both for knowing one's own mind and as a method for psychology. [[David Hume]] pointed out that introspecting a mental state tends to alter the very state itself; a German author, [[Christian Gottfried Schütz]], noted that introspection is often described as mere "inner sensation", but actually requires also attention, that introspection does not get at unconscious mental states, and that it cannot be used naively - one needs to know what to look for. [[Immanuel Kant]] added that, if they are understood too narrowly, introspective experiments are impossible. Introspection delivers, at best, hints about what goes on in the mind; it does not suffice to justify knowledge claims about the mind.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Thomas Sturm, ''Kant und die Wissenschaften vom Menschen'' (Paderborn: Mentis, 2009), ch.s 2 and 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the idea continued to be discussed between [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Auguste Comte]]. 
Recent psychological research on [[cognition]] and [[Attribution (psychology)|attribution]] has asked people to report on their mental processes, for instance to say why they made a particular choice or how they arrived at a judgment. In some situations, these reports are clearly [[confabulation|confabulated]].&lt;ref name="telling"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nisbett|first=Richard E.|author2=Timothy D. Wilson|year=1977|title=Telling more than we can know: Verbal reports on mental processes|journal=Psychological Review|volume=84|issue=3|pages=231–259|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.84.3.231 }}, reprinted in {{cite book|title=Social cognition: key readings|editor=David Lewis Hamilton|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-86377-591-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, people justify choices they have not in fact made.&lt;ref name="something"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Petter|last=Johansson|author2=Lars Hall |author3=Sverker Sikström |author4=Betty Tärning |author5=Andreas Lind |title=How something can be said about telling more than we can know: On choice blindness and introspection |year=2006 |journal= Consciousness and Cognition |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=673–692 |doi=10.1016/j.concog.2006.09.004|pmid=17049881 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such results undermine the idea that those verbal reports are based on direct introspective access to mental content. Instead, judgements about one's own mind seem to be [[inference]]s from overt behavior, similar to judgements made about another person.&lt;ref name="telling" /&gt; However, it is hard to assess whether these results only apply to unusual experimental situations, or if they reveal something about everyday introspection.&lt;ref name="knowing_more"&gt;{{cite journal|last=White |first=Peter A.|year=1988 |journal=British Journal of Psychology |volume=79| title=Knowing more about what we can tell: 'Introspective access' and causal report accuracy 10 years later|issue=1|pages=13–45|doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1988.tb02271.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of the [[adaptive unconscious]] suggests that a very large proportion of mental processes, even "high-level" processes like goal-setting and decision-making, are inaccessible to introspection.&lt;ref name="annreview"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Timothy D.|author2=Elizabeth W. Dunn|year=2004|title=Self-Knowledge: Its Limits, Value, and Potential for Improvement|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|volume=55|pages=493–518|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.55.090902.141954|pmid=14744224}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Indeed, it is questionable how confident researchers can be in their own introspections.

One of the central implications of dissociations between consciousness and meta-consciousness is that individuals, presumably including researchers, can misrepresent their experiences to themselves. Jack and Roepstorff assert, '...there is also a sense in which subjects simply cannot be wrong about their own experiential states.' Presumably they arrived at this conclusion by drawing on the seemingly self-evident quality of their own introspections, and assumed that it must equally apply to others. However, when we consider research on the topic, this conclusion seems less self-evident. If, for example, extensive introspection can cause people to make decisions that they later regret, then one very reasonable possibility is that the introspection caused them to 'lose touch with their feelings'. In short, empirical studies suggest that people can fail to appraise adequately (i.e. are wrong about) their own experiential states.

Another question in regards to the veracious accountability of introspection is  if researchers lack the confidence in their own introspections and those of their participants, then how can it gain legitimacy? Three strategies  are accountable: identifying behaviors that establish credibility, finding common ground that enables mutual understanding, and developing a trust that allows one to know when to give the benefit of the doubt.
That is to say, that words are only meaningful if validated by one's actions; When people report strategies, feelings or beliefs, their  behaviors must correspond with these statements if they are to be believed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S1364-6613(02)01970-8 | volume=6 | issue=9 | title=Establishing a legitimate relationship with introspection | journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences | pages=371–372| year=2002 | last1=Schooler | first1=Jonathan W. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even when their introspections are uninformative, people still give confident descriptions of their mental processes, being "unaware of their unawareness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Timothy D.|author2=Yoav Bar-Anan|date=August 22, 2008|title=The Unseen Mind|journal=Science|volume=321|pages=1046–1047|doi=10.1126/science.1163029|pmid=18719269|issue=5892 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon has been termed the ''introspection illusion'' and has been used to explain some [[cognitive bias]]es&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pronin|first=Emily|date=January 2007|title=Perception and misperception of bias in human judgment|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=11|issue=1|pages=37–43|issn=1364-6613|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2006.11.001|pmid=17129749}}&lt;/ref&gt; and belief in some [[paranormal]] phenomena.&lt;ref name="selfismagic"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wegner|first=Daniel M.|title=Are we free?: psychology and free will|editor=John Baer |editor2=[[James C.

For example, people generally see themselves as less [[conformity|conformist]] than others, and this seems to be because they do not introspect any urge to conform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pronin|first=Emily|author2=Jonah Berger |author3=Sarah Molouki |year=2007|title=Alone in a Crowd of Sheep: Asymmetric Perceptions of Conformity and Their Roots in an Introspection Illusion|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=92|issue=4|pages=585–595|issn=0022-3514|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.92.4.585|pmid=17469946 |url=https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1400&amp;context=marketing_papers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another reliable finding is that people generally see themselves as [[bias blind spot|less biased than everyone else]], because they are not likely to introspect any biased thought processes.&lt;ref name="blindspot"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pronin|first=Emily|author2=Matthew B.

One experiment tried to give their subjects access to others' introspections. They made audio recordings of subjects who had been told to say whatever came into their heads as they answered a question about their own bias.&lt;ref name="blindspot" /&gt; Although subjects persuaded themselves they were unlikely to be biased, their introspective reports did not sway the assessments of observers. When subjects were explicitly told to avoid relying on introspection, their assessments of their own bias became more realistic.&lt;ref name="blindspot" /&gt;

==In religion==

===Christianity===
In [[Eastern Christianity]] some concepts addressing human needs, such as sober introspection ''([[nepsis]]''), require watchfulness of the human heart and the conflicts of the human ''[[nous]]'', heart or mind. [[Noesis|Noetic]] understanding can not be achieved by rational or discursive thought (i.e. systemization).{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

===Jainism===
[[Jainism|Jains]] practise ''[[pratikraman]]'' ([[Sanskrit]] "introspection"), a process of repentance of wrongdoings during their daily life, and remind themselves to refrain from doing so again. Devout Jains often do Pratikraman at least twice a day.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

=== Hinduism ===
Introspection is encouraged in schools such as [[Advaita Vedanta]]; in order for one to know their own true nature, they need to reflect and introspect on their true nature -- which is what [[meditation]] is. Especially, [[Swami Chinmayananda]] emphasised the role of introspection in five stages, outlined in his book "Self Unfoldment."

==In fiction==
Introspection (also referred to as Rufus dialogue, interior monologue, self-talk) is the fiction-writing [[mode (literature)|mode]] used to convey a character's thoughts. As explained by Renni Browne and Dave King, "One of the great gifts of literature is that it allows for the expression of unexpressed thoughts…"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Renni | last=Browne |author2=King, David | title= Self-Editing for Fiction Writers: How to Edit Yourself into Print | year=2004| publisher= HarperCollins Publishers Inc. | isbn=978-0-06-054569-7 | url= | location= New York, NY }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Nancy Kress, a character's thoughts can greatly enhance a story: deepening characterization, increasing tension, and widening the scope of a story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kress|first=Nancy|year=2003|title=Make "Em Think|journal=Writer's Digest|volume=|issue=August|page=38|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As outlined by Jack M. Bickham, thought plays a critical role in both [[Scene (drama)|scene]] and [[sequel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Jack M. | last=Bickham | title=Scene &amp; Structure | year=1993 | publisher=Writer's Digest Books | isbn=978-0-89879-551-6 | url= | location= Cincinnati, OH |pages= 12–22, 50–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Leavitt Stevens''' (August 1, 1820 &amp;ndash; February 8, 1895) was the United States Minister to the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1893 when he was accused of conspiring to [[Overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy|overthrow]] [[Liliuokalani|Queen Liliuokalani]] in association with the [[Committee of Safety (Hawaii)|Committee of Safety]], led by [[Lorrin A. Thurston]] and [[Sanford B. Dole]] &amp;ndash; the first Americans attempting to overthrow a foreign government under the auspices of a United States government officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mg9UN_YjovkC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=%22john+l.+stevens%22|title=Overthrow|work=google.com|accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; John L. Stevens, journalist, author, minister, newspaper publisher and diplomat, was also a [[Maine Senate|Maine State Senator]] who was a founder of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] in [[Maine]].

==Early life==

John Leavitt Stevens was born in 1820 in the town of [[Mount Vernon, Maine|Mount Vernon]], [[Kennebec County, Maine]], to Capt. John Stevens &lt;ref&gt;Capt. John Stevens was originally from [[Brentwood, New Hampshire]].[https://books.google.com/books?id=LAEXAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA400&amp;dq=%22john+stevens%22+brentwood+new+hampshire&amp;lr=&amp;ei=VpBMSbObIIjClQTflIz6Bg]&lt;/ref&gt; and Charlotte (Lyford) Stevens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3X-4t4qKo-IC&amp;pg=PA1477&amp;lpg=PA1477&amp;dq=%22john+leavitt+stevens%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=4Yt4e9Kflh&amp;sig=tNj2-bB3NVTt1j9U2XEiKl2YLcc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result|title=Genealogical and Family History of the State of Maine|work=google.com|accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wFUMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA400&amp;dq=%22john+leavitt+stevens%22++new+hampshire&amp;lr=&amp;ei=gXpMSaebJo60kATzs9njCA|title=Essex Institute Historical Collections|work=google.com|accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a lifelong resident of [[Augusta, Maine|Augusta]] in the same county, except for his time away at school and his later diplomatic service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LRY8khcvxqEC&amp;pg=PA160&amp;dq=%22john+l.+stevens%22+augusta+maine&amp;ei=6lpMSdHVBozukgSalojsBw#PPA162,M1|title=Imperial Maine and Hawai'i|work=google.com|accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stevens attended [[Kents Hill School|Maine Wesleyan Seminary]] to prepare for a minister's career in the [[Universalist Church of America|Universalist]] church, which he served as pastor for a decade, becoming a leader in the anti-slavery movement. (Stevens later became a firm opponent of capital punishment, and as a Maine State Senator urged the legislature to abolish the death penalty).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TndXFgsEpWMC&amp;pg=PA476&amp;dq=%22john+l.+stevens%22&amp;lr=|title=A Bibliography of the State of Maine from the Earliest Period to 1891|work=google.com|accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a decade as an activist Universalist minister, Stevens was persuaded by his lifelong friend Maine Governor [[Anson P. Morrill]] to give up the pulpit and become a newspaper publisher and politician. Stevens took his friend Morrill's advice, left the ministry and became a newspaper editor and publisher before becoming a Maine delegate to the [[1860 Republican National Convention]].&lt;ref name = "Ralph"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=41gjgT5C0K8C&amp;pg=PA566&amp;lpg=PA566&amp;dq=%22john+leavitt+stevens%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=oVfLxnWxrX&amp;sig=rFmQp4pcQLri2peVeaq-VA0BFMM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ct=result|title=The Hawaiian Kingdom|work=google.com|accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six years prior, in 1854, Stevens and his partner [[James G. Blaine]] had purchased the newspaper ''[[Kennebec Journal|The Kennebec Journal]]'' in  Augusta, where the pair collaborated for 14 years on editing their publication and pushing the development of Maine's Republican Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VhVcCv1C6N0C&amp;pg=PA79&amp;dq=%22john+l.+stevens%22+augusta+maine&amp;ei=NGhMSZv7LoLKlQT36aiuDw|title=The Indigenous Experience|work=google.com|accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stevens also played a large role in the 1876 Presidential campaign when he served as Chairman of the Republican State Committee of Maine. He stumped in the states of Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania for the Republican Presidential ticket that year, which won him an appointment as a minister representing the United States government.

==Diplomatic career==

Stevens joined the United States Department of State and was appointed successively minister to [[Paraguay]], [[Uruguay]], [[Sweden]] and [[Norway]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1877/11/13/80669127.pdf Action of the Senate on the Nominations, The New York Times, November 13, 1877]&lt;/ref&gt; and finally to  [[Hawaii]], an appointment pushed by his old partner Blaine, who had risen to [[United States Secretary of State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5mLuIx6z1qcC&amp;pg=PA125&amp;dq=%22john+l.+stevens%22+representative+men+of+maine&amp;ei=fmtMSca6GIXSkwSQyJn_AQ|title=Benjamin Harrison|work=google.com|accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Stevens was named to the Hawaiian post, his title was changed to Minister Plenipotentiary and Envoy Extraordinary, indicating his rise within the State Department.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1895/02/09/105977069.pdf John L. Stevens is Dead, The New York Times, February 9, 1895]&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after his installation in Hawaii,&lt;ref&gt;One of Stevens's predecessors in his Hawaii post was [[Luther Severance]], a friend and political mentor to Stevens who had been the editor of the ''Kennebec Journal'' for 25 years when he was appointed United States Minister to Hawaii in 1850. An ardent Annexationist, Severance was later a columnist for the newspaper under Stevens's and Blaine's ownership.[https://books.google.com/books?id=VhVcCv1C6N0C&amp;pg=PA79&amp;dq=%22john+l.+stevens%22&amp;lr=&amp;ei=KbZZSefHH6OSkATfh7TrAg#PPA79,M1]&lt;/ref&gt; Stevens began writing about the islands, in a steady stream of pamphlets and speeches, including his December 19, 1891, speech delivered at Founder's Day celebrations of the Kamehameha School, entitled ''Advice to Young Hawaiians'',&lt;ref&gt;''Advice to Young Hawaiians''; His Ex. John L. Stevens at Bishop Hall, Founder's Day December 19, 1891, By John Leavitt Stevens, Published by Kamehameha School Press, 1892&lt;/ref&gt; and his later ''The Hawaiian Situation'' tract, written with Eugene Chamberlain and William Springer.&lt;ref&gt;''The Hawaiian Situation'', By Eugene Tyler Chamberlain, John Leavitt Stevens, William McKendree Springer, 1893&lt;/ref&gt;

Envoy Stevens had gone on-the-record about his [[Manifest Destiny]] views concerning close allies of the United States. Presumably his views reflected those of his former partner, friend, sponsor and now boss at the State Department. In 1881, James G. Blaine had written of the necessity of "drawing the ties of intimate relationship between us and the Hawaiian Islands so as to make them practically a part of the American system without derogation of their absolute independence."&lt;ref name = "Ralph"/&gt;

Constitutional reforms in Hawaii in 1887 had widened the gulf between foreign businessmen and native Hawaiian nationalists. In January 1891 the Hawaiian King, who had been sympathetic to the interests of the foreign businessmen, died while on a visit to the United States. He was succeeded by his sister, the Princess, who was crowned [[Liliuokalani|Queen Lili'uokalani]]. The new Queen was known to dislike the restrictive constitution of 1887, and envoy Stevens suspected the Queen's nationalist sympathies. He asked that a United States warship, the {{USS|Boston|1884|6}} be stationed indefinitely in [[Honolulu harbor]].&lt;ref name = "Pletcher"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pn8SDywYRssC&amp;pg=PA236&amp;lpg=PA236&amp;dq=%22john+l.+stevens%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=w8v81shHD7&amp;sig=jNk4zURRjyDHyyMSiOW5J1Ztkt4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ct=result#PPA236,M1|title=The Diplomacy of Involvement|work=google.com|accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1892 envoy Stevens wrote to [[United States Secretary of State]] [[James G. Blaine]], his old newspaper partner, asking how far he might deviate from standard State Department rules if a native revolutionary movement emerged. "The golden hour is near at hand," Stevens later wrote his old partner and friend Blaine. "So long as the islands retain their own independent government there remains the possibility that [[England]] or the Canadian Dominion might secure one of the Hawaiian harbors for a coaling station." Added Stevens: "Annexation excludes all dangers of this kind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gB9mHNE17jgC&amp;pg=PA233&amp;dq=%22john+l.+stevens%22&amp;ei=LYJZSbzrB5LOlQSSt4XPDA|title=The Cambridge History of the Pacific Islanders|work=google.com|accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The Hawaiian pear is now fully ripe, and this is the golden hour for the United States to pluck it.|John Leavitt Stevens&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HrldzcrC_EgC&amp;pg=PA146&amp;dq=%22john+leavitt+stevens%22&amp;lr=&amp;ei=KopMSeVngsqVBPfpqK4P|title=Lost Bird of Wounded Knee|work=google.com|accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The question had taken on significance after the completion of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] in 1886. Seeking to capitalize on the new transcontinental link in the [[Dominion of Canada]], [[British people|British]] capitalists were said to welcome the addition of the Hawaiian Islands as an English protectorate.&lt;ref name = "Pletcher"/&gt; For aggressive [[Manifest Destiny]] advocates like Stevens, the telegraphing of English intentions &amp;ndash; even by diplomatic innuendo &amp;ndash; signaled the need for a preemptive American response.

==Overthrow and Stevens's response==

{{main|Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii}}

At the time of the [[1887 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii|Bayonet Constitution]] of 1887 [[Grover Cleveland]] was president, and his secretary of state [[Thomas F. Bayard]] sent written instructions to the American minister George W. Merrill that in the event of another revolution in Hawaii, it was a priority to protect American commerce, lives and property. Bayard specified, "the assistance of the officers of our Government vessels, if found necessary, will therefore be promptly afforded to promote the reign of law and respect for orderly government in Hawaii." In July 1889, there was a small scale rebellion, and Minister Merrill landed Marines to protect Americans; the State Department explicitly approved his action.  Merrill's replacement, minister John L. Stevens, read those official instructions, and followed them in his controversial actions of 1893.&lt;ref&gt;Charles S. Campbell, ''The Transformation of American Foreign Relations: 1865–1900'' (1976), pp 178-79,&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 14, 1893, envoy Stevens met with two other men concerned about American territorial interests in the Pacific. That night, Stevens and American-Hawaiian businessmen [[Sanford Dole]]&lt;ref&gt;Dole wrote later that "we [the revolutionists] knew the United States Minister was in sympathy with us."[https://books.google.com/books?id=ySapNgjfwKgC&amp;pg=PA174&amp;dq=%22john+l.+stevens%22&amp;lr=&amp;ei=EsVZSe3XB4LKlQTDqZiGAg]&lt;/ref&gt; and Lorrin Thurston met to hatch "an audacious plot to overthrow Hawaii's Queen and bring her country into the United States," writes ''[[New York Times]]'' reporter Stephen Kinzer in his book ''Overthrow''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q3o2BaNiJksC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=%22john+l.+stevens%22&amp;ei=i5FZSdfZFofEkASsoo3gBA#PPA9,M1|title=Overthrow|work=google.com|accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The immediate event which precipitated the meeting was Queen Lili'uokalani's attempt to promulgate a new constitution which would have restored many of the powers of the monarchy that existed prior to the forced promulgation of the "[[Bayonet Constitution]]" in 1887 that reduced the power of the Hawaiian monarch and rescinded voting rights to much of the population. The Queen's cabinet refused to go along with the planned new constitution, and Queen Lili{{okina}}uokalani temporarily yielded. But to the ardent Annexationists the volatile situation provided an opportunity that they seized. The Annexation Club morphed into a Committee of Safety; it shepherded documents drafted to establish a provisional government.

The Committee of Safety expressed concern for the safety and property of American residents in Honolulu. Minister Stevens, advised about these supposed threats to non-combatant American lives and property&lt;ref&gt;Kinzer, S. (2006) America's Century of Regime Change from Hawaii to Iraq. p. 30. [Minister Stevens] "certainly overstepped his authority when he brought troops ashore, especially since he knew that the 'general alarm and terror' of which the Committee of Safety had complained was a fiction."&lt;/ref&gt; by the Committee of Safety, obliged their request and summoned a company of uniformed U.S. Marines from the  ''Boston'' and two companies of U.S. sailors to land on the Kingdom and take up positions in strategic locations in Honolulu on the afternoon of January 16, 1893. 162 sailors and [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] aboard the ''Boston'' came ashore well-armed but under orders of neutrality.  They were positioned around Royal residences and Hawaiian government installations, not around United States citizens' quarters. Having observed the troops' march up the street, the Queen was heard to remark that the Marines were finishing what the "missionaries" started.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ySapNgjfwKgC&amp;pg=PA174&amp;dq=%22john+l.+stevens%22&amp;lr=&amp;ei=EsVZSe3XB4LKlQTDqZiGAg#PPA175,M1|title=Anatomy of Paradise - Hawaii and the Islands of the South Seas|work=google.com|accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=apUH-SxCcLcC&amp;pg=PA156&amp;dq=%22john+l.+stevens%22&amp;lr=&amp;ei=PMNZSZmFApWckATfzuDmBw#PPA157,M1|title=History of the Hawaiian Kingdom|work=google.com|accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of the Marines served effectively in intimidating royalist defenders. Historian William Russ states, "the injunction to prevent fighting of any kind made it impossible for the monarchy to protect itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Russ | first = William Adam | authorlink = William Adam Russ  | title = The Hawaiian Revolution (1893-94) | publisher = Associated University Presses  | year = 1992 | isbn = 0-945636-43-1 | page = 350 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to the Queen's desire "to avoid any collision of armed forces, and perhaps the loss of life" for her subjects and after some deliberation, at the urging of advisers and friends, the Queen ordered her forces to surrender. The Honolulu Rifles took over government buildings, disarmed the Royal Guard, and declared a Provisional Government.

Minister Stevens recognized the new government, giving his blessing on behalf of the United States Department of State, and commissioners were immediately dispatched to Washington to request that Hawaii be annexed by the United States. On February 9, 1893, Stevens acted preemptively, establishing a [[protectorate]] pending negotiations for annexation. On February 16, President Harrison sent a message to the Senate, formally requesting annexation of the Hawaiian kingdom.

But President Cleveland, immediately following his inauguration, sent a message to the Senate, canceling all further talk of annexation. He then sent a commissioner to the Islands to assess the situation, who reported that the newly established protectorate be withdrawn as unnecessary. Envoy Stevens immediately resigned and returned to Maine, where he spent his time in public denunciation of the new administration's Hawaiian policy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1893/11/30/109735547.pdf Ex-Minister Stevens's Reply, The New York Times, November 30, 1893]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Blount Report]] commissioned by President [[Grover Cleveland]] was submitted on July 17, 1893 and found Stevens guilty of inappropriate conduct in support of the conspiracy to overthrow Hawaii's Queen. Answering the charges from his [[Augusta, Maine]], home, Stevens supplied his rationale: the Queen was immoral, and so needed to be dethroned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z65BAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA756&amp;dq=%22john+l.+stevens%22+augusta+maine&amp;ei=41xMSeaXDpXSlQS816gY|title=Life of Walter Quintin Gresham, 1832-1895|work=google.com|accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The later Morgan investigation conducted by the [[U.S. Congress]], which led to the [[Morgan Report]] on February 26, 1894 found Stevens and other U.S. agents not guilty, after which Cleveland abandoned the matter because of lack of Congressional support. Both the Blount and Morgan Reports are cited by partisans on both sides to support their claims about the legitimacy or lack thereof of the overthrow.

In 1993, Congress passed and the President signed an [[Apology Resolution]] apologizing for the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii a century before. Based on the Blount Report and other historical analyses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tate |first=Merze |authorlink=Merze Tate |title=The United States and the Hawaiian Kingdom: A Political History |publisher=Yale University Press |year=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=King |first=Pauline |title=in: Russ, William: The Hawaiian Revolution (1893-94) (Introduction) |publisher=Associated University Presses |year=1992 |isbn=0-945636-43-1 |page=xiii }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Resolution subsequently became a touchstone in the cultural and political identification of many native Hawaiians.

==Forced retirement and later life==

Following his forced retirement in 1893 because of the overthrow of Hawaii, Stevens spent his time lecturing and writing and working in Republican Party circles.  He died two years later. During his retirement, Stevens worked to rehabilitate his image following his humiliating firing by the new President. In 1894, the former preacher and newspaper editor published ''Picturesque Hawaii: A Charming Description of Her Unique History, Strange People, Exquisite Climate, Wondrous Volcanoes, Luxurious Productions, Beautiful Cities, Corrupt Monarchy, Recent Revolution and Provisional Government'', a strange volume of part memoir, part travelogue and part political tract meant to provide a rationale for his actions in the Islands.&lt;ref&gt;''Picturesque Hawaii: A Charming Description of Her Unique History, Strange People, Exquisite Climate, Wondrous Volcanoes, Luxurious Productions, Beautiful Cities, Corrupt Monarchy, Recent Revolution and Provisional Government'', By John Leavitt Stevens, W. B. Oleson, Nellie M. Stevens, Published by Hubbard Publishing Co., 1894&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Liliuokalani.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Queen Regnant Lili'uokalani of Hawaii.]]
During his life, Stevens authored several other books, including a two-volume biography &lt;ref&gt;''Harper's Magazine'' called Stevens's work on the Swedish King "a very full and capable presentation of the genius and work" of the monarch. Although the former newspaper editor's writing style was "stiff, ungraceful and a little obscure", the biography benefitted from "the richness and authenticity of the materials he has collected."[https://books.google.com/books?id=jnUCAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA155&amp;dq=%22john+l.+stevens%22&amp;lr=&amp;ei=_sdZSfucBo_GlQTWr4S3BA]&lt;/ref&gt; of Swedish King [[Gustavus Adolphus]] and his involvement in the [[Thirty Years War]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r0YDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA48&amp;dq=%22john+leavitt+stevens%22&amp;lr=&amp;ei=M4NMSbK1OJCIkATU4LjJCQ#PPA48,M1|title=The Book Buyer|work=google.com|accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; praised by ''The New York Times'' as showing "extensive research and much patient reading."&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1895/02/09/105977069.pdf John L. Stevens Is Dead, ''The New York Times'', February 9, 1895]&lt;/ref&gt; The prolific Stevens also authored assorted letters, speeches and tracts, many of them advocating his [[Manifest Destiny]] views on American foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TndXFgsEpWMC&amp;pg=PA476&amp;dq=%22john+l.+stevens%22+augusta+maine&amp;ei=aWZMSeqxK4jClQTflIz6Bg#PPA475,M1|title=A Bibliography of the State of Maine from the Earliest Period to 1891|work=google.com|accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stevens was awarded an [[Honorary degree|Honorary Doctorate of Laws]] by [[Tufts University|Tufts College]] in 1882.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zaoaAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA163&amp;dq=%22john+leavitt+stevens%22++new+hampshire&amp;lr=&amp;ei=23tMSb2_LoX-kwTp-LzSCQ#PPA163,M1|title=Semi-centennial Edition of the Register of Officers of Instruction and ...|work=google.com|accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; American author and orientalist [[William Elliot Griffis]] dedicated his book ''America in the East'' to Stevens, who, Griffis wrote, "believing that the lives and property of American citizens abroad ought to be as well protected as if they were at home, acting according to his faith."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IboNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP11&amp;dq=%22john+leavitt+stevens%22&amp;lr=&amp;ei=dYxMSZTyLZLakAT0xZnCAg|title=America in the East|work=google.com|accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John L. Stevens was married to the former Mary Lowell Smith&lt;ref&gt;Stevens's wife Mary Lowell (Smith) Leavitt was the daughter of Capt. Daniel Smith and Dorcas (Lowell) Smith of Hallowell, Maine, a descendant of Percival Lowell, progenitor of Boston's [[Lowell family]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=F4lSS27eATAC&amp;pg=PA370&amp;dq=%22john+leavitt+stevens%22++maine&amp;lr=&amp;ei=l25MSZ2MDIX-kwTp-LzSCQ#PPA370,M1]&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Hallowell, Maine]], on May 10, 1845.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F4lSS27eATAC&amp;pg=PA370&amp;dq=%22john+leavitt+stevens%22++maine&amp;lr=&amp;ei=l25MSZ2MDIX-kwTp-LzSCQ#PPA370,M1|title=The Historic Genealogy of the Lowells of America from 1639 to 1899|work=google.com|accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had one son and three daughters, one of whom drowned on January 20, 1893 &amp;ndash; three days after the Hawaiian overthrow Stevens helped engineer &amp;ndash; and an event said to have sent the diplomat into crippling depression.

Hon. John L. Stevens died at his home in Augusta, Maine, at 4 a.m. on February 8, 1895, of heart disease.

In 1898 the United States government officially annexed Hawaii. A seven-piece silver service made of melted silver dollars and given to Stevens after his Hawaiian tenure by pro-Annexation forces in Hawaii is still owned by Stevens's descendants. The tea service, and the career of its controversial owner, were the subject of a [[Public Broadcasting Service]] documentary in 1998 entitled ''The Nation Within''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~mecreadf/rdfldkhs.htm|title=Kents Hill School Notables|work=ancestry.com|accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A one-act play entitled "Cry for the Gods" was written by Judge Paul Handy which presents a dramatized, fictional meeting between Stevens and the Queen on the night of January 16, 1893. It has been performed in Maryland and as part of the Capital Fringe Festival in Washington, DC.

The '''KROK International Animated Films Festival''' is an annual international [[animation]] [[film festival]], and one of the main animation festivals in the territory of the former Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;[http://petersburgcity.com/news/culture/2008/09/25/krok/ Animation Festival “KROK” Kicks Off in Saint Petersburg]&lt;/ref&gt; It is held in [[Russia]] on even years and in [[Ukraine]] on odd years. The festival takes place over the course of 12 days between September and October on the cruise ship ''Taras Shevchenko''. When in Russia, it cruises along the [[Volga]], and when in Ukraine it cruises along the [[Dnieper River|Dnieper]] and the [[Black Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://kiev.com/events/view/krok-international-animated-films-festival KROK International Animated Films Festival], Kiev.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival's history began at the 1987, [[perestroika]]-era [[Moscow International Film Festival]], where it was decided to create separate contests for documentary, children's and animated films.

In 1989, the festival was first held as a separate event. The name "KROK" was thought up by [[Garri Bardin]] and means "step" in [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]].

In 1991, with the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985-1991)|dissolution of the Soviet Union]], it was decided to make the festival international and it was held on a cruise ship for the first time.

As well as the competitive categories, the festival also features other animation screenings, events, and lectures. It is often attended by the top [[animator]]s and [[film director|directors]] of animation of the region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osm.od.ua/en/international-animated-film-festival-krok-2012]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ШЕРВУД, Ольга.

The '''Kannur Kotta rape case''' refers to the gang rape of a married Muslim woman by her husband along with his friends at the [[St. Angelo Fort|Kannur Fort]] in the year 1993. The case was landmark event in the history of [[Kerala]] with woman rights activists organising a ''Kitchen bandh'' and a sustained campaign to bring the guilty to justice. The husband Ibrahim and his four friends were convicted and imprisoned for 7 years, and ordered to pay Rs 50,000 each as restitution to the victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thequint.com/lifestyle/a-22-year-old-kitchen-bandh-and-victory-for-a-rape-survivor |title=A 22-Year-Old ‘Kitchen Bandh’ and Victory for a Rape Survivor |publisher=The Quint |date= |accessdate=2018-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

During [[World War II]] a number of countries were conquered and controlled. Some of these countries were then given new names, and assigned new governmental leaders which were loyal to the conquering country.  These countries are known as [[puppet state]]s. [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] were the two countries with the most puppet states. [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] also had several puppet states. Most of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] (with the exception of the [[Soviet Union]]) did not have many puppet states.

== Allies ==

=== Soviet Union ===

The [[Soviet Union]] had only one puppet state prior to World War II, the [[Tuvan People's Republic]], but it acquired many more during the war.

|In 1920, the [[Latvian War of Independence]] was over, and Latvia gained its independence from Russia.  Latvia, along with Estonia and Lithuania, signed the [[Baltic Entente]] in 1934, a plan for the countries to politically support each other.  On 5 October 1939, Latvia signed the [[Soviet–Latvian Mutual Assistance Treaty]], allowing the Soviet Union to build military bases on Latvian soil.  On 17 July 1940, the Soviet Union invaded.  Four days later, [[Kārlis Ulmanis]], then-president of Latvia, stepped down, and gave the pro-Soviet [[Augusts Kirhenšteins]] the seat.  Kirhenšteins requested the incorporation of Latvia into the Soviet Union, as the [[Latvian SSR]] on 5 August 1940.  After being taken by the Germans 10 July 1941, it remained part of [[Reichskommissariat Ostland|Ostland]] until the [[Baltic Offensive|Soviet counterattack]], when the last German forces in Latvia ([[Army Group Courland]] in the [[Courland Pocket]]) were defeated.&lt;ref name=latviahistory&gt;{{cite book|last=Plakans|first=Andrejs|title=The Latvians: A Short History|publisher=Hoover Press|isbn=0817993037|pages=141–149|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ad3-xvwdjE4C&amp;pg=PR18&amp;dq=Latvian+Soviet+Socialist+Republic&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IMpzU-W3IpS-sQT7w4DwDw&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwADgU#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=encyclopedia&gt;{{cite book|last=Osmańczyk|first=Edmund|title=Encyclopedia of the United Nations and International Agreements: G to M|date=2003|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=0415939224|pages=1275–1276|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QqlFx7xHiSUC&amp;pg=PA1275&amp;dq=Latvian+Soviet+Socialist+Republic&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IMpzU-W3IpS-sQT7w4DwDw&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBTgU#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It remained under Russian control until the 10 March 1990, when the [[On the Restoration of Independence of the Republic of Latvia|Latvian Declaration of Sovereignty]] was adopted by the [[Supreme Council of the Republic of Latvia]].

Using troops that had been assembled by the Germans after their [[Operation Albion|invasion]] and subsequent [[Occupation of Estonia by the German Empire|occupation]] of Germany, [[Johan Laidoner]] lead the [[Estonian War of Independence]].  The Soviet Union and Estonia then signed the [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian–Estonian)|Treaty of Tartu]], making Estonia independent.  The Soviet Union invaded Estonia a second time, twenty years later, on 17 June 1940.  A puppet state was set up four days later.  Almost a year later, Germany invaded during [[Operation Barbarossa]], and incorporated Estonia into [[Reichskommissariat Ostland|Ostland]]. Estonians welcomed the Germans, but quickly began to dislike them.

After Iraq's 1932 admittance into the [[League of Nations]], British mandate of the area was ended.

In April 1941, al-Gaylani began a revolt, led by the [[Golden Square (Iraq)|Golden Square]], a group of colonels.  The rebels believed that they would get support from Germany, however, Germany was preoccupied fighting Russia.

|Following Japan's [[Philippines Campaign (1941–42)|invasion of the Philippines]] in 1941, the Japanese tried to present themselves as liberators from their "colonial repression."  In 1942, a group of influential Filipino politicians tried to negotiate with the Japanese for the creation of a new national government, but this led to nothing more than the creation of the puppet state.  A second factor in the creation of the puppet state was the turning tide of the war: the Japanese believed that the creation of a government that appeared free would boost civilian morale.  On 20 October 1944, US forces began the [[Philippines Campaign (1944–45)|re-invasion of the Philippines]].  The Philippines were effectively  under United States control by July 1945, and a new government set up in August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marshall Cavendish Corporation|title=World and Its Peoples: Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Brunei|date=2007|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|isbn=0761476423|pages=1188–1189|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=72VwCFtYHCgC&amp;pg=PA1188&amp;dq=Japanese+control+of+philippines&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jzWFU8buKs-YyAS75YGYCQ&amp;ved=0CGcQ6AEwCg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|The Provisional Government of India, sometimes also called the Provisional Government of Azad Hind, was created by Indian nationalists-in-exile in October 1943.&lt;ref name=pettibone /&gt; {{rp|411}}  According to [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] in a proclamation issued on 4 April 1944, the government was formed in [[Syonan-to]] (formerly Singapore) after an invasion of Singapore.  This invasion was wanted "by the unanimous will of the three million Indians in East Asia."  Additionally, he stated that the Provisional Government had but one mission: "to expel the Anglo-American armies from the sacred soil of India by armed force and then to bring about the establishment of a Permanent Government of Azad Hind, in accordance with the will of the Indian people."  He also claimed that "the Indian people will co-operate wholeheartedly with our Ally, the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Nippon Army]], who are giving us unstinted and unconditional assistance in defeating our enemies."  Bose was also "fully convinced &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;of&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Nippon's sincerity towards India."  He also claimed that, given the Government's rapid advance into India, "the circumstances have...rendered it necessary...to borrow from the Nipponese Government the currency...already in its possession and to use that money as a temporary measure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Toye|first=Hugh|title=The Springing Tiger: A Study of the Indian National Army and of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose|date=1959|publisher=Allied Publishers|isbn=8184243928|pages=186–187|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_ACwkShmNzUC&amp;pg=PA187&amp;dq=Provisional+Government+of+Free+India&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-C-GU-KoM-PLsQSe9ILYBg&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Provisional Government was ended shortly after Subhas Rose died in a plane crash on the way to Taiwan, in August 1945.

|In October 1940, the [[Franco-Thai War]] broke out between Vichy France and Thailand.  The Japanese, using their power in the area (gained after the [[Japanese invasion of French Indochina]]), mediated the [[ceasefire]], and got Vichy France to cede disputed territories to Thailand.  On 8 December 1941, Japanese forces invaded Thailand, using bases in Cambodia.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}  By July 1942, nationalists were growing more upset with the French rule in the area, and were planning a march against the French, when, on 17 July, their leader, [[Hem Chieu]], was arrested after mentioning his ideas of a march to a Cambodian militiaman.  This outraged the nationalists, and they staged a Japanese-backed rally on 20 July.  The French reacted harshly, tracking down as many people as possible who attended the protest, and then trying them.  After the [[Operation Overlord|allied invasion of France]], Japan began to grow fearful that the [[Free French Forces]] would align Cambodia with the allied cause.  On 9 March 1945, Japan seized control of Cambodia in a [[Japanese coup d'état in French Indochina|coup d'état in French Indochina]].  On 13 March, [[Norodom Sihanouk]] agreed with Japanese wishes, and declared that Cambodia was now the independent Kingdom of Kampuchea, and nullified all Franco-Cambodian agreements.

|[[Oryol|Orel]], [[Kursk]],  and [[Bryansk]] of the [[Soviet Union]]
|On 22 June 1941, Germany initiated [[Operation Barbarossa]], the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union.  Upon reaching  Orel, Kursk, and Bryansk, the invading forces were greeted by the ardent anti-communist [[Bronislav Kaminski]] and his forces, who were actively fighting the Soviets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jan Chodakiewicz|first1=Marek|title=Intermarium: The Land between the Black and Baltic Seas|date=2012|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=1412847869|page=142|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4zSGR3fBfUcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=19 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His force, known as the Russkaya Osvoboditelnaya Narodnaya Armiya, meaning [[S.S. Sturmbrigade R.O.N.A.#Russian National Liberation Army|Russian National Liberation Army]] and abbreviated RONA, was composed of [[Red Army]] deserters, anti-communist [[White movement|white Russian]] collaborators, and a rag-tag group of [[expatriate]]s.&lt;ref name=McNab&gt;{{cite book|last1=McNab|first1=Chris|title=Hitler's Elite: The SS 1939-45|date=2013|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=147280645X|pages=347–348|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TV7MAQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=20 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  RONA's forces were allowed control of the area at some point in November 1941 by [[Rudolf Schmidt]], though it is unclear whether he was acting on his own accord or on another officer's orders.  Though Lokot was initially headed by the founder of RONA, [[Konstantin Voskoboinik]], after Voskoboinik was killed in early 1942, control of the region was transferred to Kaminski.&lt;ref name=Rein&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rein|first1=Leonid|title=The Kings and the Pawns: Collaboration in Byelorussia during World War II|date=2011|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=0857450433|pages=287–288|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JCbNmF3iXP0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=20 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 1942, the Lokot region was given limited autonomy.  While in charge, Kaminski's forces rooted out [[Partisan (military)|partisan]] activity with notorious ruthlessness, and became incorporated into the [[SS]] as [[S.S. Sturmbrigade R.O.N.A.]].  In May 1942, after gaining support from [[Alfred Rosenberg]], the region was granted increased autonomy.  By 1943, however, RONA began to suffer many desertions, due to Russia's improved position against Germany, and the Lokot Autonomy was evacuated by August 1943.&lt;ref name=McNab/&gt;{{rp|347}}

|bgcolor=lightblue|[[Benito Mussolini]], the leader of Italy, was one of Hitler's early allies in World War II, and initially his only willing ally, signing the [[Pact of Steel]] on 22 May 1939, which formed a military and political alliance between Germany and Italy.  Many Italian citizens and soldiers disagreed with Mussolini and his views, but their frustration was fully reached by 1943.  These views were strengthened by the Allied bombings in Italy, which destroyed large amounts of food and fuel.  This, added to rampant [[inflation]], led to numerous strikes throughout Italy.  Italy's global position became even worse after the Allies forced Italy out of Africa, and, from the African shore, launched the [[Allied invasion of Sicily|Invasion of Sicily]] on 10 July 1943.  Numerous important figures in Italian politics at the time, including [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Victor Emmanuel III]], the [[King of Italy]], had decided that the Axis was going to lose the war, and that negotiations would be impossible with Mussolini in power.  On 23 July, a meeting was organized to determine how Mussolini should be removed from office, and, following that meeting, Mussolini was told he was dismissed as prime minister, but also arrested.  Mussolini's replacement, [[Pietro Badoglio]], was welcomed, as many Italians assumed Mussolini's ousting would mean an end to the war.  But Badoglio announced he would honor the Pact of Steel and the [[Tripartite Pact]], and stay in the war.  At the same time, Germany was increasing the number of forces in the area (from two divisions to seven), obviously preparing for Italy to be implementing a secret deal with the Allies, as was being planned.  On 3 September 1943, Italy officially surrendered by signing the [[Armistice of Cassibile]], though their surrender was not announced until 8 September, because the Armistice stated it "should come into force at a moment most favorable by the Allies."  The German reaction to the news was almost immediate, with over 600,000 Italian soldiers captured and sent to Germany as prisoners of war, and all of central and northern essentially occupied, in a matter of hours, and the puppet state of the Italian Social Republic was set up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Quartermaine|first1=Louisa|title=Mussolini's Last Republic: Propaganda and Politics in the Italian Social Republic (R.S.I.) 1943-45|date=2000|publisher=Intellect Books|isbn=1902454081|pages=9–12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vwx6hN8zyIsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  So despite Italy's surrender, the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]] lasted on for another year and a half.

|[[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]], the [[Soviet Union]]
|After [[Operation Barbarossa]], Germany controlled much of the Soviet Union's satellite states, including [[Belarus]].  The [[German occupation of Belarus during World War II|German occupation of Belarus]] began on the same day as Operation Barbarossa (22 June 1941) due to its proximity to the German-Soviet Border.  Initially, the land was included in ''[[Reichskommissariat Ostland]]''.  Early on, much of the state's work was done by either pro-Nazi or anti-communist Belorussian Self-Help battalions, but in April 1943 the chief of German security police in Belarus demanded that all Self-Help groups be disbanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Savchenko|first1=Andrew|title=Belarus: A Perpetual Borderland|date=2009|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9004174486|page=133|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lmld75blKCwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=20 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 21 December 1943, the Belarusian Central Rada (sometimes called the Belarusian Central Council) was formed, and placed under the leadership of [[Radasłaŭ Astroŭski]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Korosteleva|first1=Elena|last2=Lawson|first2=Colin|last3=Marsh|first3=Rosalind|title=Contemporary Belarus: Between Democracy and Dictatorship|date=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1135789487|page=22|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gfeQAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=20 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The puppet state was destroyed with the Soviet [[Operation Bagration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Wilson|title=Belarus: The Last European Dictatorship|date=2011|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300134355|page=110|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jZJntMQtkSYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=20 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|Beginning in the fall of 1943, Hitler was becoming increasingly fearful that Romania or Hungary would try to collaborate with the Allies, as Italy had.  Viewing Hungary's distancing itself from the Axis as a key sign of impending collaboration, Hitler devised a plan known as [[Operation Margarethe]].  By September, a plan was devised, and a second plan, [[Operation Margarethe II]], was devised to occupy Romania simultaneously, but was later dropped because the German Operations Staff believed there would not be enough men to engage both countries at once.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zeimke|first1=Earl|title=From Stalingrad to Berlin|date=2014|publisher=Pen and Sword|isbn=1783462477|page=261|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RvRDBgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=7 Jul 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 18 March 1944, Hungary's [[Regent]] [[Miklós Horthy]] met with Hitler, while German troops simultaneously silently crossed the Hungarian border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Szegedy-Maszak|first1=Marianne|title=I Kiss Your Hands Many Times: Hearts, Souls, and Wars in Hungary|date=2013|publisher=Spiegel &amp; Grau|isbn=0385524854|page=114|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5T0uAAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=7 Jul 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During his meeting with Hitler, Horthy was informed of the situation and forced to accept changes to his government—namely replacing Prime Minister [[Miklós Kállay]](who was known to have been talking with the West) with [[Döme Sztójay]].&lt;ref name=Weinberg&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weinberg|first1=Gerhard L.|title=A World At Arms|date=1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521443172|page=672}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later in 1944, on 20 August, the Soviet Union began the [[Jassy–Kishinev Offensive]], which saw the Romanian Army switch sides.  On 23 August, Romania joined arms with the Soviet Union to fight Nazi Germany, who was their ally at the beginning of the operation.  This had dramatic repercussions, as now Hungary had to defend their borders against both the Soviet Union and Romania.  The Romanians also had extra incentive to invade Hungary in the form of an age-old territorial dispute.  On 24 September, the situation in Hungary was so dire that Horthy hand-wrote a letter to Stalin pleading for peace with the Soviet Union, going as far as claiming he was misinformed about the [[Bombing of Kassa]], an event which was used to bring Hungary to war against the Soviet Union.  Hungary had planned on leaving the Axis on 15 October, however, German leaders discovered the plan and seized Hungary the day of.  [[Ferenc Szálasi]] and his party, leader of the fascist [[Arrow Cross Party]], was placed in control of the government, with members of his party taking over many governmental jobs.  The Government of National Unity was officially set up two days later.  The Government of National Unity remained a state under Germany's control until the end of World War II, when it was invaded by the Allies on 7 March 1945.&lt;ref name=Weinberg/&gt;{{rp|715–716}}

=== Italy ===
Italy did not have nearly as many puppet states as its partner Axis countries, however, Italy did co-administer some countries in the [[Balkans]] with [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], Greece, in particular.  Italy's puppet states were captured by Germany after the [[Armistice of Cassibile]].

The '''Monster World Tour''' was a [[concert tour]] by the American hard rock group [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] in support of their 20th studio album, ''[[Monster (Kiss album)|Monster]]''. Fresh off the heels of the recent success of [[The Tour (Kiss and Mötley Crüe)|The Tour]] with [[Mötley Crüe]] and the second annual KISS Kruise, the tour officially began on November 7, 2012 in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]]. Kiss played shows in Australia for the first time since 2008, and Europe, including a few festivals in June. They played their longest Canadian tour to date in July through early August with a few US concerts following after, including a show at ArenaBowl XXVI in Orlando, Florida. They played in Japan for the first time since 2006 in October 2013.

The new stage show, first used in the European leg, involved a giant robotic spider that moved across the stage and all four members were lifted into the air. The spider shot pyro from its legs and had eyes that glowed.

The '''opening of the Canadian parliament''' is the commencement of a session of the [[Parliament of Canada]] following a general election. It involves summons from the [[Governor General of Canada|governor general]] on behalf of the [[Monarchy of Canada|monarch]] and a ceremony based on the [[State Opening of Parliament|same in the United Kingdom]], though less elaborate and now evolved to include uniquely Canadian elements.

==Summons==
At the same time as the [[Governor General of Canada]] [[Dropping the writ|drops the writ]] for a [[Elections in Canada#National elections|federal election]], he or she also issues a [[royal proclamation]] summoning parliament—setting the date for the opening of the next parliament following the election (though, the date may be amended by subsequent proclamations, so long as parliament eventually meets as required by the [[Constitution Act, 1867]]).&lt;ref name=Senate40&gt;{{citation| url=http://sen.parl.gc.ca/portal/SPIP/pdf/SPIP-2015-06-01-e.pdf| author=Senate of Canada| title=Senate Procedure and Practice| page=40| date=June 2015| publisher=[[Queen's Printer for Canada]]| location=Ottawa| accessdate=15 November 2015| ref=CITEREFSenate_of_Canada2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These read as follows:

{{quote|TO ALL WHOM these Presents shall come or whom the same may in any way concern,

Greeting:

A proclamation

Whereas We are desirous to meet Our People of Canada as soon as may be and to have their advice in Parliament;

We do hereby, by and with the advice of Our Prime Minister of Canada, summon and call together the House of Commons of Canada, to meet at Our City of Ottawa, on [date], then and there to have conference and treaty with the Senate of Canada.&lt;ref name=Senate40/&gt;}}

A later proclamation gives the precise time for parliament to open:

{{quote|To Our beloved and faithful SENATORS of Canada, and MEMBERS elected to serve in the House of Commons of Canada, and to all whom these Presents may in any way concern,

Greeting:

A proclamation

Whereas Our Parliament of Canada was dissolved on [date];

Therefore We, by these Presents, command each of you and all others interested in this behalf to appear in person on [date], at [time] at Our City of Ottawa, for the DISPATCH OF BUSINESS, to treat, do, act, and conclude upon those things that Our Parliament of Canada may, by the Grace of God, ordain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Senate of Canada| 2015| p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Of the [[Deputy of the Governor General of Canada|governor general's deputies]], only the justices of the [[Supreme Court of Canada|supreme court]] can summon parliament (though they, nor the other deputies, may dissolve it).&lt;ref name=Senate40/&gt;

==Opening of parliament==
[[File:Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Phillip sit on thrones before a full Parliament.jpg|thumbnail|Queen [[Elizabeth II]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Phillip]] at the opening of parliament, 14 October 1957. The justices of the [[Supreme Court of Canada|supreme court]] sit at centre, in front of the monarch. The Mace Bearer stands at far right. The [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] ([[John Diefenbaker]]) sits to the sovereign's immediate right.]]

Canada has two types of opening for the federal parliament, differentiated by scale: Larger openings, called ''bench openings'', require the seating of the [[Senate of Canada|Senate]] (where the monarch, governor general, or another delegate reads the [[Speech from the throne|Throne Speech]]), which is rearranged to accommodate the number of official guests—the justices of the [[Supreme Court of Canada|supreme court]], [[Lieutenant governor (Canada)|lieutenant governors]], former prime ministers, members of the [[Queen's Privy Council for Canada]], and members of the diplomatic corps, and any spouses—and the galleries are reserved for other guests. Smaller openings, called ''desk openings'' do not require the removal of senators' desks, as guests are limited to the justices of the supreme court, invitees of the governor general and prime minister, and the deans of the diplomatic corps. The [[Speaker of the Senate of Canada|Speaker of the Senate]] establishes the guest list, though the size of the ceremony is determined by the prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Senate of Canada| 2015| pp=41-42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opening of the first session of a parliament takes place over two days (the opening of a subsequent session of the same parliament requires only one day&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Senate of Canada| 2015| p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;). On the first, routine business is conducted. After such is concluded, the Speaker of the Senate commands the [[Usher of the Black Rod (Canada)|Usher of the Black Rod]] (usually called simply Black Rod) to summon the members of the House of Commons to the Senate. Once assembled, the speaker addresses the congregation, stating "Honourable Members of the Senate, Members of the House of Commons: I have it in command to let you know His [or Her] Excellency the Governor General does not see fit to declare the causes of his [or her] summoning of the present Parliament of Canada, until a Speaker of the House of Commons shall have been chosen, according to law; but tomorrow, [date], at [time], His [or Her] Excellency will declare the causes of his [or her] calling this parliament." The [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] then return to the commons to elect the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (Canada)|speaker for that chamber]]. The speech itself is delivered the following day.

As the Queen's representative, the governor general attends parliament to deliver the [[Speech From the Throne]], although this can and has been done by the sovereign themselves or another representative, for example the Queen gave the Speech from the Throne in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.gg.ca/images/infographics/SotT_Infographic_EN.jpg | title=Speech from the Throne Infographic | publisher=Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada | date=2015 | accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accompanied by four officers of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]], he or she usually rides in the [[Royal and viceroyal transport in Canada#Carriage and automobile|State Landau]], often accompanied by the [[Viceregal consort of Canada|viceregal consort]], between [[Rideau Hall]] and [[Parliament Hill]], where the governor general inspects a [[Canadian Armed Forces]] [[Guard of honour#Canada|guard of honour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/delivering-the-government-s-blueprint-1.754562| title=Delivering the government's blueprint| date=12 November 2008| publisher=CBC| accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the viceroy is in the parliament building, the Usher of the Black Rod is again sent to call the members of the House of Commons to the Senate. Upon his or her arrival at the bar of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Commons addresses his counterpart in the Senate, asserting the rights and privileges of the commons and its members. The Speaker of the Senate, on behalf of the governor general, responds that the Crown will "recognise and allow their constitutional privileges". The governor general then reads the Throne Speech,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Senate of Canada| 2015| p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; during which the Senate's mace is held by the Mace Bearer, who stands to the side of the throne.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Senate of Canada| 2015| p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate==
The address is followed by a debate and vote in both houses of parliament. Formally, the motion merely calls on parliament to thank the monarch or viceroy for the speech via an Address in Reply. Until 1897, this was a more detailed message, covering the content of the Throne Speech point by point.&lt;ref name=Senate44&gt;{{harvnb| Senate of Canada| 2015| p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, in the Senate, takes the form of simply:

{{quote|That the following Address be presented to His [or Her] Excellency the Governor General of Canada

To His [or Her] Excellency the Right Honourable [name], Chancellor and Principal Companion of the Order of Canada, Chancellor and Commander of the Order of Military Merit, Chancellor and Commander of the Order of Merit of the Police Forces, Governor General and Commander-in-Chief of Canada.

MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY:

We, Her [or His] Majesty's most loyal and dutiful subjects, the Senate of Canada in Parliament assembled, beg leave to offer our humble thanks to Your Excellency for the gracious Speech which Your Excellency has addressed to both Houses of Parliament.&lt;ref name=Senate44/&gt;}}

The debate is, however, often wide-ranging, exploring many aspects of the government's proposed policies, and spread over several days. When the Address in Reply is eventually voted on, the poll is held to constitute a [[Motion of no confidence|motion of confidence]] in the government, which, if lost, would result in the end of that government's mandate.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/M07.pdf| last=House of Commons Library| authorlink=House of Commons Library| title=Parliamentary Elections| page=3| publisher=Queen's Printer| date=September 2008| work=Factsheet M7| issn=0144-4689| accessdate=19 November 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325012443/http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/M07.pdf |archivedate=25 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This discussion and vote follows a symbolic raising of other matters, designed to highlight the independence of parliament from the Crown; a practice that originated after [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] was tried and executed by the [[Parliament of England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=https://curve.carleton.ca/system/files/etd/d63ec210-da01-4db6-ade0-43f5ce376ca2/etd_pdf/892aa4e798b7a7fb52731d8f3959fd50/woods-mylordsandgentlemenastudyofbritishorigins.pdf| last=Woods| first=Henrik| title="My Lords and Gentlemen": A Study of British Origins and the Evolution of the Canadian Throne Speech Genre| date=2011| page=6| publisher=[[Library and Archives Canada]]| accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Senate, it is [[Bills C-1 and S-1|Bill S-1]], an Act Relating to Railways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title=Debates of the Senate, 2nd Session, 39th Parliament| journal=Hansard| volume=144| issue=1| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| location=Ottawa| date=16 October 2007| url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/39/2/parlbus/chambus/senate/deb-e/001db_2007-10-16-E.htm?Language=E&amp;Parl=39&amp;Ses=2#8| accessdate=2 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WhiteDove912.jpg|thumb|White release dove.]]

A '''release dove''', also called white pigeon, is a rock dove bred for size and overall resemblance to a white dove. Pure white doves exist in nature as albinos.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} Not all release doves are rock doves and most breeders of doves for various uses do not domesticate their birds.  

Although many dove release businesses advertise that their birds will be able to safely return home, a few released “doves” can be  killed in accidents or by predators before they can make their way back. Most released birds are able to survive a return flight and are viewed similarly to racing pigeons that have been raced for centuries. 

The pigeons bred for dove release services are bred for their color, small size, and for their amazing homing abilities and flight speeds.

== Dove ceremonies ==
Release dove handlers each offer their own unique list of release ceremonies to choose from. Some companies will offer either untrained [[racing homer|homers]], [[ring-necked dove|ringnecks]], or other types of pigeon or dove. Those types of birds are likely to end up in the claws of a [[hawk]], [[owl]] or [[cat]], since they are unable to survive on their own in the wild.&lt;ref name="Gorman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.star-telegram.com/407/story/700926.html|title=Bird lady of Haslet helps to elevate occasions|last=Gorman|first=Kate|publisher=Star Telegram (Jun 15, 2008)|accessdate=2008-06-25}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Common wedding release ceremonies===
* the "hand release" in which the bride and groom hold two doves which are then released together
* the "flurry" or "flock release" in which the bride and groom release two birds by hand or from a box and then a larger group of doves are released shortly afterward to join them in the sky.

===Common memorial release ceremonies===
* the "spirit" in which a single dove is released,
* the "trinity" in which three doves are released, followed by a single dove representing the soul of the deceased.
* the "12 dove" in which a single dove is first released, followed by twelve doves.

== Types of white doves and pigeons used for release ==
[[File:White homing pigeon.jpg|thumb|Many of these birds are used for the release industry as well as for racing.]]
[[File:WhiteBandits012.jpg|thumb|One strain of white homing pigeon, and most common, is the Stielbacht.]]
Many birds have been used for ceremonial releases. But only the Rock Dove has been used traditionally as a messenger of the event that they are released at.

=== Homing pigeons ===
There are many breeds of [[homing pigeon]]s, often called "Thoroughbreds of the Sky".  Colored homing pigeons are often used for ceremonial release when pure white homing pigeons are not needed or not available.  The most common breed of homing pigeon is bred for racing, and typically flies {{convert|300|mi|km|abbr=in|disp=flip}} to {{convert|600|mi|km|abbr=in|disp=flip}} in a race.  The earliest homing pigeons were not used for racing, but to carry messages over long distances in a short amount of time.  Today, long-distance homing pigeons fly {{convert|1000|mi|km|abbr=in|disp=flip}} or more. All racers are judged and selected for how quickly they return home.

=== White homing pigeons ===
White [[Racing Homer|racing pigeons]] are most often used for ceremonial release. The pure white pigeon or Rock Dove is associated with all good traits: peace, hope, love, goodwill and family to name a few.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}  They are typically bigger and can be heavier than other Racing Homers as their primary breeding focus has been their ability to fly from many different locations and their looks rather than flight from a few select locations at a high rate of speed.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}  A breed of white Racing Homer called the ''Belgian Pletinckx'' can be used for white dove release ceremonies and they make good racers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last =Perkins 
| first =Rix D | title =The Belgian Pletinckx - Not just another white homer | newspaper =Purebred Pigeon | date =March–April 2008 | url =http://www.purebredpigeon.com/| postscript =&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although many people refer to the white homing pigeon as "racing pigeons", not all white ceremonial release pigeons are used for racing. A racing pigeon is different only in that it is bred for the sport of [[pigeon racing]] and breeders select for speed, as well as homing ability; they are in fact the same type of bird.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

The '''Scandinavian Touring Car Championship''' (STCC) is a [[touring car racing]] series based in [[Scandinavia]]. The series took over from the [[Danish Touringcar Championship]] and [[Swedish Touring Car Championship]], with its first season in 2011. The '''Scandinavian Touring Car Cup''' was awarded in 2010 to the driver with best results from selected races in the Danish and Swedish seasons.

In 2013, the series merged with the rival [[TTA – Racing Elite League]], which was formed as a result of the split in 2012. From the 2013 season onwards, the series would see a new format based upon the TTA series.

{{citations needed|date=November 2018}}

'''Schwagstock''' is a music festival that takes place over the course of a weekend in an outdoor setting, and is intended to carry on the vibe of the [[Woodstock Festival|Woodstock]] festival. Food, trinkets, glassware, carvings, beads, blankets, tie-dye clothing, and many other handmade and [[hippie]]-appeal items are available for sale by individual vendors.  Attendees are allowed to camp anywhere they wish on the campgrounds, and may choose to set up tents or to camp in their vehicles instead. Music is scheduled such that there are several overlapping live music acts between the main stage and the sideshow(s) from early afternoon until early morning.  Past Schwagstocks have been held at Lesterville, Leasburg and Bagnell Dam in Missouri, and in Iowa, but as of 2004 all Schwagstocks are held at Camp Zoe, south of Salem, [[Shannon County, MO]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schwagstock.us/ Schwagstock]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
Besides for the camping and concerts, attendees can also swim, canoe, hike, float down the river, and explore caves. Camp Zoe has about 370 acres of land that can be explored. There are bluffs, caves, beaches, creeks, trees, ferns, hills, and natural wildlife. Zoe is surrounded by thousands of acres of national forest and private timber reserves.

==Legalities==
On November 8, 2010, the United States [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] filed court documents alleging that the Schwagstock festival is the site of widespread, rampant use and sales of illegal drugs. Investigations date all the way back to 2006 until November 1, 2010 when Camp Zoe was raided.  The paperwork shows that the authorities hope to use a mechanism called asset forfeiture to take the property. Under a forfeiture, they do not need to convict the property's owners of a crime or even charge them with one.  Even though Jimmy Tebeau has plead guilty to not a crime, the government has to show a "preponderance of evidence" that the property was part of criminal activity. The agency seized the Camp Zoe property.&lt;ref name=RiverfrontTimes/&gt;
Since Zoe was shut down at the infamous Spookstock.

==Band history==
The Schwag was created in 1992 by Jimmy Tebeau and Tracy Lowe. In their own words, The Schwag is "a band out to preserve and perpetuate the vibe and music made popular by the Grateful Dead."  The band has played over 1500 shows since then, in at least 18 U.S. states. Recently it has just celebrated its 17th year of playing as a musical entity. Notable guest performers have included [[Mike Gordon]], [[Butch Trucks]], [[Chuck Berry]], [[Vince Welnick]], [[Melvin Seals]], [[Michael Kang (musician)|Michael Kang]], [[Bill Nershi]], Michael Travis, [[Jason Hann]], Mike and Liz from [[Rusted Root]], [[Merl Saunders]], [[Keller Williams]], Fred Tackett of [[Little Feat]],  [[Johnnie Johnson (musician)|Johnnie Johnson]], and [[Devon Allman]].  The other members of the band arrive and depart as conditions dictate.  The lineup usually consists of Jimmy; a guitar player (such as Eric Eisen  from the Helping Phriendly band, Michael Kang of The String Cheese Incident, Shawn Guyot (deceased), (TIM MOODY) Darrell Lea, Brad Sarno, Tracy Lowe, Nick Romanoff(deceased)); a keyboard/organ player (such as [http://natecarpenter.com Nate Carpenter](now in [http://downstereo.com DOWNSTEREO]) Jack Kirkner (now in [[Honeytribe]]); and a drummer (such as Tony Antonelli Dave Klein, Dino English, Cannon DeWeese (now in [http://downstereo.com DOWNSTEREO]).

In 2005, the Missouri House of Representatives passed a resolution applauding Jimmy Tebeau for his "entrepreneurial spirit and creative skills". [http://www.house.mo.gov/billtracking/bills051/hlrbillspdf/5872C.01.pdf]  A plaque commemorating the resolution was presented to Jimmy at a 2005 Schwagstock.

==The Band Now==
Jimmy and the new band manager have worked hard to make the band a noticeable presence and the acquisition of Camp Zoe in [[Salem, Missouri]], which has attracted [[The String Cheese Incident]]'s band members and management involvement, has made the band a popular player in the [[jamband]] circuit.  Schwagstocks have become increasingly popular at Camp Zoe and with SCI's management involvement.

JGB guitarist Stu Allen joined the band in 2008, which has increased the band's profile and sound. They are still traveling and playing shows for people all over the U.S.

[[File:Expiration.jpg|thumb|This pack of diced pork says 'display until' 7 May and 'use by' 8 May]]

'''Shelf life''' is the length of time that a commodity may be stored without becoming unfit for use, consumption, or sale.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed.&lt;/ref&gt;   In other words, it might refer to whether a commodity should no longer be on a pantry shelf (unfit for use), or just no longer on a supermarket shelf (unfit for sale, but not yet unfit for use).  It applies to [[cosmetics]], [[food]]s and [[drink|beverage]]s, [[medical device]]s, [[medicine]]s, [[explosives]], [[pharmaceutical drug]]s, [[chemical]]s, [[tire]]s, [[battery (electricity)|batteries]] and many other [[decomposition|perishable]] items. In some regions, an advisory ''best before'', mandatory ''use by'' or ''freshness date'' is required on packaged perishable foods. The concept of [[expiration date]] is related but legally distinct in some jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inspection.gc.ca/food/information-for-consumers/fact-sheets-and-infographics/date-labelling/eng/1332357469487/1332357545633|title=Date Labelling on Pre-packaged Foods|first=Government of Canada,Canadian Food Inspection Agency,Public|last=Affairs|website=www.inspection.gc.ca|accessdate=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Shelf life is the recommended maximum time for which products or fresh (harvested) produce can be stored, during which the defined quality of a specified proportion of the goods remains acceptable under expected (or specified) conditions of distribution, storage and display.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gyesley |first= S. W. |date=January 1991|title=Total Systems Approach to Predict Shelf Life of Packaged Foods|volume= |issue=|publisher=[[ASTM International]].: Food Packaging Technology|pages=46–50|editor1-first=DK|editor1-last=Henyon|id=ASTM STP 1113-EB|url= |doi=10.1520/STP14842S|chapter= Total System Approach to Predict Shelf Life of Packaged Food Products |isbn= 978-0-8031-1417-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the USDA, "canned foods are safe indefinitely as long as they are not exposed to freezing temperatures, or temperatures above 90 °F (32.2° C)". If the cans look okay, they are safe to use. Discard cans that are dented, rusted, or swollen. High-acid canned foods (tomatoes, fruits) will keep their best quality for 12 to 18 months; low-acid canned foods (meats, vegetables) for 2 to 5 years.  {{convert|80|F}}.&lt;ref name="USDA-FAQ"&gt;{{cite web|title=Food_Product_Dating|url=http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/food-safety-education/get-answers/food-safety-fact-sheets/food-labeling/food-product-dating/food-product-dating|accessdate=2015-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Sell by date" is a less ambiguous term for what is often referred to as an "expiration date". Most food is still edible after the expiration date.&lt;ref name=CA-EXP&gt;''See'' {{cite web |url=http://www.consumeraffairs.com/nutrition/expiration_dates.htm |title=Expiration dates |publisher=Consumer Affairs |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A product that has passed its shelf life might still be safe, but quality is no longer guaranteed. In most food stores, waste is minimized by using [[stock rotation]], which involves moving products with the earliest sell by date from the warehouse to the sales area, and then to the front of the shelf, so that most shoppers will pick them up first and thus they are likely to be sold before the end of their shelf life. Some stores can be fined for selling out of date products; most if not all would have to mark such products down as [[Food waste|wasted]], resulting in a financial loss.

Shelf life depends on the degradation mechanism of the specific product. Most can be influenced by several factors: exposure to [[light]], [[heat]], moisture, transmission of [[gas]]es, mechanical [[Stress (physics)|stresses]], and contamination by things such as micro-organisms. Product quality is often mathematically modelled around a parameter (concentration of a chemical compound, a microbiological index, or moisture content).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Azanha |first= A.B.|authorlink= |author2=Faria  |date=July 2005 |title=Use of mathematical models for estimating the shelf-life of cornflakes in flexible packaging|journal=Packaging Technology and Science |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=161–222 |url= |doi=10.1002/pts.686 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For some foods, health issues are important in determining shelf life. Bacterial contaminants are ubiquitous, and foods left unused too long will often be contaminated by substantial amounts of bacterial colonies and become dangerous to eat, leading to [[food poisoning]]. However, shelf life alone is not an accurate indicator of how long the food can safely be stored. For example, pasteurized milk can remain fresh for five days after its sell-by date if it is refrigerated properly. However, improper storage of milk may result in bacterial contamination or spoilage before the expiration date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Can You Drink Milk Past Its Sell-by Date?|url=https://www.healthyeating.org/Milk-Dairy/Dairy-Facts/Milk-Storage-Handling/Article-Viewer/Article/1587/Can-You-Drink-Milk-Past-Its-Sell-by-Date.aspx|website=Dairy Council of California|accessdate=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[expiration date]] of pharmaceuticals specifies the date the manufacturer guarantees the full potency and safety of a drug. Most medications continue to be effective and safe for a time after the expiration date. A rare exception is a case of renal tubular acidosis purportedly caused by expired [[tetracycline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1395800 | pmid=15266231 | volume=6 | title=Recycling expensive medication: why not? | journal=MedGenMed | pages=4 | last1 = Pomerantz | first1 = JM | year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration covered over 100 drugs, prescription and over-the-counter. The study showed that about 90% of them were safe and effective as long as 15 years past their expiration dates. Joel Davis, a former FDA expiration-date compliance chief, said that with a handful of exceptions - notably nitroglycerin, insulin and some liquid antibiotics - most expired drugs are probably effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Shelf life is not significantly studied during drug development{{dubious|date=February 2012}}, and drug manufacturers have economic and liability incentives to specify shorter shelf lives so that consumers are encouraged to discard and repurchase products. One major exception is the [[Shelf Life Extension Program]] (SLEP) of the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] (DoD), which commissioned a major study of drug efficacy from the FDA starting in the mid-1980s. One criticism is that the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) refused to issue guidelines based on SLEP research for normal marketing of pharmaceuticals even though the FDA performed the study. The SLEP and FDA signed a memorandum that scientific data could not be shared with the public, public health departments, other government agencies, and drug manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usamma.army.mil/dod_slep.cfm |title=US Army Medical Materiel Agency (USAMMA) |publisher=Usamma.army.mil |date=2013-11-20 |accessdate=2014-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; State and local programs are not permitted to participate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.upmc-biosecurity.org/website/resources/publications/2009/2009-03-27-max_st_local_med_cntr.html |title=Maximizing State and Local Medical Countermeasure Stockpile Investments Through the Shelf-Life Extension Program. |publisher=Upmc-biosecurity.org |accessdate=2014-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118131537/http://www.upmc-biosecurity.org/website/resources/publications/2009/2009-03-27-max_st_local_med_cntr.html |archivedate=2013-01-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The failure to share data has caused foreign governments to refuse donations of expired medications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.essentialdrugs.org/edrug/archive/200003/msg00076.php |title=Essentialdrugs.org |publisher=Essentialdrugs.org |accessdate=2014-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211033851/http://www.essentialdrugs.org/edrug/archive/200003/msg00076.php |archivedate=2013-12-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One exception occurred during the 2010 [[Swine flu (outbreak in the US)|Swine Flu Epidemic]] when the FDA authorized expired [[Tamiflu]] based on SLEP Data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/newsevents/publichealthfocus/ucm154962.htm |title=Stockpiled Antivirals at or Nearing Expiration |publisher=Fda.gov |accessdate=2014-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SLEP discovered that drugs such as [[Cipro]] remained effective nine years after their shelf life, and, as a cost-saving measure, the US military routinely uses a wide range of SLEP tested products past their official shelf life if drugs have been stored properly.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usamma.army.mil/assets/docs/dlar.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Heat Sealing Film for Permeability Test.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Package testing]]: heat sealing film for evaluation of shelf life of lettuce]]

[[Preservative]]s and [[antioxidant]]s may be incorporated into some food and drug products to extend their shelf life. Some companies use [[induction sealing]] and [[vacuum]]/oxygen-barrier pouches to assist in the extension of the shelf life of their products where oxygen causes the loss.

The DoD Shelf-Life Program defines shelf-life as

&lt;blockquote&gt;The total period of time beginning with the date of manufacture, date of cure (for elastomeric and rubber products only), date of assembly, or date of pack (subsistence only), and terminated by the date by which an item must be used (expiration date) or subjected to inspection, test, restoration, or disposal action; or after inspection/laboratory test/restorative action that an item may remain in the combined wholesale (including manufacture's) and retail storage systems and still be suitable for issue or use by the end user. Shelf-life is not to be confused with service-life (defined as, A general term used to quantify the average or standard life expectancy of an item or equipment while in use.  When a shelf-life item is unpacked and introduced to mission requirements, installed into intended application, or merely left in storage, placed in pre-expended bins, or held as [[bench stock]], shelf-life management stops and service life begins.)&lt;ref name="The DoD Shelf-Life Program - Shelf-Life Management Manual - Definitions"&gt;{{cite web|title=The DoD Shelf-Life Program - Shelf-Life Management Manual - Definitions|url=https://www.shelflife.hq.dla.mil/Policy_4140_27/06Definitions.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722194243/https://www.shelflife.hq.dla.mil/Policy_4140_27/06Definitions.htm|archivedate=2011-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Shelf life is often specified in conjunction with a specific product, package, and distribution system. For example, an [[MRE]] [[field ration]] is designed to have a shelf life of three years at {{convert|80|F}} and six months at {{convert|100|F}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release

==Temperature control==
{{Main|Cold chain}}
Nearly all chemical reactions can occur at normal temperatures (although different reactions proceed at different rates). However most reactions are accelerated by high temperatures, and the degradation of foods and pharmaceuticals is no exception. The same applies to the breakdown of many chemical explosives into more unstable compounds. [[Nitroglycerin]]e is notorious. Old [[explosive material|explosives]] are thus more dangerous (i.e. liable to be triggered to explode by very small disturbances, even trivial jiggling) than more recently manufactured explosives. [[Rubber]] products also degrade as [[sulfur|sulphur]] [[Chemical bond|bonds]] induced during [[vulcanization]] revert; this is why old [[rubber band]]s and other rubber products soften and get crispy, and lose their elasticity as they age.

The usually quoted [[rule of thumb]] is that chemical reactions double their rate for each temperature increase of {{convert|10|C-change|0}} because [[activation energy]] barriers are more easily surmounted at higher temperatures. However, as with many rules of thumb, there are many [[wikt:caveat|caveat]]s and exceptions. The rule works best for reactions with [[activation energy]] values around 50&amp;nbsp;kJ/mole; many of these are important at the usual temperatures we encounter. It is often applied in shelf life estimation, sometimes wrongly. There is a widespread impression, for instance in industry, that "triple time" can be simulated in practice by increasing the temperature by {{convert|15|C-change|0}}, e.g., storing a product for one month at {{convert|35|C|0}} simulates three months at {{convert|20|C|0}}. This is mathematically incorrect (if the rule was precisely accurate the required temperature increase would be about {{convert|15.8|C-change|1}}), and in any case the rule is only a rough approximation and cannot always be relied on.

The same is true, up to a point, of the chemical reactions of living things. They are usually catalyzed by [[enzyme]]s which change reaction rates, but with no variation in catalytic action, the rule of thumb is still mostly applicable. In the case of [[bacterium|bacteria]] and [[fungi]], the reactions needed to feed and reproduce speed up at higher temperatures, up to the point that the proteins and other compounds in their cells themselves begin to break down, or [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denature]], so quickly that they cannot be replaced. This is why high temperatures kill bacteria and other micro-organisms: 'tissue' breakdown reactions reach such rates that they cannot be compensated for and the cell dies. On the other hand, 'elevated' temperatures short of these result in increased growth and reproduction; if the organism is harmful, perhaps to dangerous levels.

Just as temperature increases speed up reactions, temperature decreases reduce them. Therefore, to make explosives stable for longer periods, or to keep rubber bands springy, or to force bacteria to slow down their growth, they can be cooled. That is why shelf life is generally extended by temperature control: ([[refrigeration]], [[insulated shipping container]]s, controlled [[cold chain]], etc.) and why some medicines and foods ''must'' be refrigerated. Since such storing of such goods is temporal in nature and shelf life is dependent on the temperature controlled environment, they are also referred to as [[cargo]] even when in special storage to emphasize the inherent time-temperature sensitivity matrix.

[[Temperature data logger]]s and [[time temperature indicator]]s can record the temperature history of a shipment to help estimate their remaining shelf life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meyers |first= T |date=June 2007 |title=RFID Shelf-life Monitoring Helps Resolve Disputes|journal=RFID Journal |volume= |issue= |pages= |url=http://www.rfidjournal.com/article/articleview/3357/1/128/ |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[USDA]], "foods kept frozen continuously are safe indefinitely."&lt;ref name="USDA-FAQ" /&gt;&lt;!-- Excerpt: "product dates aren't a guide for safe use of a product ... Once a perishable product is frozen, it doesn't matter if the date expires because foods kept frozen continuously are safe indefinitely." --&gt;

==Packaging==
Passive barrier packaging can often help control or extend shelf life by blocking the transmission of deleterious substances, like moisture or oxygen, across the barrier.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pharmtech.com/protecting-solid-dose-shelf-life|title=Protecting Solid-Dose Shelf Life|last=Forcinio|first=Hallie|date=2 October 2018|work=Pharmaceutical Technology|access-date=8 November 2018|publisher=UBM|issue=10|volume=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Active packaging]], on the other hand, employs the use of substances that scavenge, capture, or otherwise render harmless deleterious substances.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  When moisture content is a mechanism for product degradation, packaging with a low [[moisture vapor transmission rate]] and the use of [[desiccant]]s help keep the moisture in the package within acceptable limits.   When [[oxidation]] is the primary concern, packaging with a low [[oxygen transmission rate]] and the use of [[oxygen absorber]]s can help extend the shelf life. [[Produce]] and other products with respiration often require packaging with controlled barrier properties. The use of a [[modified atmosphere]] in the package can extend the shelf life for some products.

==Issues associated with sell by / use by dates==
According to the UK [[Waste &amp; Resources Action Programme]] (WRAP), 33% percent of all food produced is wasted along the [[cold chain]] or by the consumer.&lt;ref&gt;Household Food and Drink Waste in the UK, WRAP 2009&lt;/ref&gt; {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} At the same time, a large number of people get sick every year due to spoiled food. According to the [[WHO]] and [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]], every year in the USA there are 76 million [[foodborne illness]]es, leading to 325,000 hospitalizations and 5,000 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs237/en/|title=WHO - Food safety and foodborne illness&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to former UK minister [[Hilary Benn]], the use by date and sell by dates are old technologies that are outdated and should be replaced by other solutions or disposed of altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/green-living/kitchen-bin-war-tackling-the-food-waste-mountain-1698753.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Kitchen bin war: tackling the food waste mountain | first=Rachel | last=Shields | date=2009-06-07 | accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK government's [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]] revised guidance in 2011 to exclude the use of sell by dates. The guidance was prepared in consultation with the food industry, consumer groups, regulators, and [[Waste &amp; Resources Action Programme]] (WRAP). It aims to reduce the annual £12bn of wasted supermarket food.&lt;ref name="guardian government bins"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/sep/15/food-waste-sellby-dates | title=Government bins 'sell-by' dates to reduce food waste | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=2011-09-15 | accessdate=September 15, 2011 | author=Batty, David | location=London | quote=The "sell-by" date on food packaging is to be removed in a bid to cut the £12bn worth of food needlessly binned every year.

However, there is no requirement that the year be in four digits.&lt;ref name="durable"/&gt;

===Regulations in Hong Kong===
In Hong Kong,  prepackaged food which from the [[microbiology|microbiological]] point of view is highly perishable and is therefore likely after a short period to constitute an immediate danger to human health, are required to use the 'Use by' label instead of the 'Best before' label. Examples include pasteurised fresh milk,  packed egg and ham sandwiches, etc. Dates are usually presented in the DD MM YY (or YYYY) format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfs.gov.hk/english/multimedia/multimedia_pub/files/Read_the_Food_Labels_e.pdf#Page=4|title=Centre for Food Safety|publisher=|accessdate=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulations in the European Union===
In the EU food quality dates are governed by Regulation (EU) 1169/2011, "On the Provision of Food Information to Consumers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32011R1169&amp;from=da |title=Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2011, on the provision of food information to consumers... |accessdate=27 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
      A.  There are items in the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Federal Supply System that require special handling due to certain  deteriorative characteristics.  These items are to be properly maintained to ensure that the customer is provided fresh, useable material.  The purpose of this Manual is to establish a shelf-life program and process, with special emphasis on those items having these known deterioration characteristics, to mitigate the risk of shelf-life expiration and lapses of shelf-life items/material beyond their inspect/test dates.&lt;br /&gt;
      B.  Provide policy and basic procedures for the management of both non-consumable and consumable shelf‑life items that may be hazardous material (HAZMAT) or non-hazardous material, spanning all classes of supply and stored at all levels of the Federal Supply System.  Shelf-life management for hazardous material follows the same procedures as those for any shelf-life items, except that hazardous material should receive priority processing over non-hazardous material.  Issues and guidelines concerning the acquisition, storage, handling, transportation, and disposal of hazardous material are addressed in Chapters 3 and 5 of this Manual.  Class I perishable subsistence, Class III bulk petroleum, Class V ammunition, and Class VIII-B blood, are excluded from this Manual and shall continue to be managed in accordance with existing regulations.  Commodities excluded from this Manual may be represented by their respective DoD Component to the DoD Shelf-Life Board.  The definitions for “classes of supply” may be found in Appendix 16 of DoD 4140.1-R.&lt;br /&gt;
     C.  This Manual endorses the pollution prevention measures in DoD Instruction 4715.4 for hazardous material (HAZMAT) minimization (HAZMIN), as well as, the establishment of hazardous material control and management (HMC&amp;M) philosophies which include consolidation and reutilization practices that embrace HAZMIN and HAZMAT elimination to reduce the hazardous waste (HW) stream.&lt;br /&gt;
     D.  Appendices A through K augment this Manual and furnish additional information germane to the DoD Shelf-Life Management Program.  Appendix L serves as a quick reference index to this Manual.

==Beer==

===Freshness date===
A ''freshness date'' is the date used in the American brewing industry to indicate either the date the beer was bottled or the date before which the beer should be consumed.

Beer is perishable. It can be affected by light, air, or the action of bacteria.  Although beer is not legally mandated in the United States to have a shelf life, freshness dates serve much the same purpose and are used as a marketing tool.

===Beginnings of freshness dating===
[[Eugene Selvage#Lucky Lager Brewing Company|General Brewing Company]] of San Francisco marketed their [[Lucky Lager]] Beer as "Age Dated" as early as late 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XaEfHBz2uaYC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;dq=Lucky+Lager+Beer+Age+Dated&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=53g38sNe7P&amp;sig=WCkmg6i7rMc5q3CFuyb1bdqEiY4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=wWHrSuTjJoG1tgf_kok7&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CBkQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Lucky+Lager+Beer+Age+Dated&amp;f=false|title=Great American Beers: Twelve Brands That Became Icons|first=Bill|last=Yenne|publisher=Voyageur Press|accessdate=1 September 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; They stamped a date on each can lid to indicate that the beer was brewed before that date. This was not to ensure that the beer was "fresh" but to ensure that it had been aged properly.  So many breweries had rushed beer to market before it was ready when Prohibition ended, that customers were wary of getting "green" beer.
The [[Boston Beer Company]], maker of [[Samuel Adams (beer)|Samuel Adams]], was among the first contemporary brewers to start adding freshness dates to their product line in 1985.  For ten years there was a slow growth in  brewers adding freshness dates to their beer.  The practice rapidly grew in popularity after the [[Anheuser-Busch]] company's heavily marketed "Born-On dates" starting in 1996.  Many other brewers have started adding freshness dates to their products, but there is no standard for what the date means.  For some companies, the date on the bottle or can will be the date that the beer was bottled; others have the date by which the beer should be consumed.

==Related concepts==
The concept of shelf life applies to other products besides food and drugs. Gasoline has a shelf life, although it is not normally necessary to display a sell-by date. Exceeding this time-frame will introduce harmful varnishes{{clarify|date=August 2012}}, etc. into equipment designed to operate with these products, i.e. a gasoline lawn mower that has not been properly winterized{{clarify|date=August 2012}} could incur damage that will prevent use in the spring, and require expensive servicing to the carburetor.

Some glues and adhesives also have a limited storage life, and will stop working in a reliable and usable manner if their safe shelf life is exceeded.

Rather different is the use of a time limit for the use of items like vouchers, gift certificates and pre-paid phone cards, so that after the displayed date the voucher etc. will no longer be valid. Bell Mobility and its parent company, BCE Inc. have been served with notice of a $100-million class-action lawsuit alleging that expiry dates on its pre-paid wireless services are illegal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ca.news.yahoo.com/100m-class-action-alleges-expiry-dates-bell-pre-150805068.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516235849/http://ca.news.yahoo.com/100m-class-action-alleges-expiry-dates-bell-pre-150805068.html |date=May 16, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Watschenkonzert Karikatur in Die Zeit vom 6. April 1913.jpg|thumb|320px|''Watschenkonzert'', caricature in ''Die Zeit'' from April 6, 1913]]
The '''''{{Lang|de|Skandalkonzert}}''''' of March 31, 1913, was a concert of the {{Lang|de|Wiener Konzertverein}} (Vienna Concert Society) conducted by [[Arnold Schoenberg]] in the Great Hall of the [[Musikverein]]. The audience, shocked by the [[expressionist music|expressionism]] and experimentalism of the [[Second Viennese School]], began rioting, and the concert was ended prematurely. A punch administered by concert organizer Erhard Buschbeck became the subject of a lawsuit, whereby operetta composer [[Oscar Straus (composer)|Oscar Straus]], heard as a witness, testified that it had been the most harmonious sound of the evening.

==Program==
The program listed:
* [[Anton Webern]]: ''Six Pieces for Orchestra'', Op. 6.
* [[Alexander von Zemlinsky]]: ''Four Orchestral Songs on poems by [[Maurice Maeterlinck|Maeterlinck]]'' (eventually published as Zemlinsky's Op. 13, Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 5 were performed at the Skandalkonzert).
* Arnold Schoenberg: ''[[Chamber Symphony No. 1]]'', Op. 9.
* [[Alban Berg]]: Two of the ''[[Altenberg Lieder|Five Orchestral Songs on Picture-Postcard Texts by Peter Altenberg]]'', Op. 4 Nos. 2 and 3. Both the lyrical and musical side of this premiere were seen as provocative.
* The concert was ended before the scheduled performance of [[Gustav Mahler]]'s ''[[Kindertotenlieder]]'' could begin.

During Berg's songs the audience called for both poet and composer to be committed, despite it being public knowledge that [[Peter Altenberg|Altenberg]] was already committed to an asylum at the time.&lt;ref name="Barker"&gt;Barker, Andrew (1997). "Battles of the Mind", ''[[Cambridge Companions to Music|The Cambridge Companion to Berg]]'', p. 24. Pople, Anthony, ed. {{ISBN|0-521-56489-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Though not present at the concert, he was granted leave to attend the dress-rehearsal that morning, and three days later he wrote a prose sketch depicting [[Alma Mahler]] there.&lt;ref&gt;Barker (1997), pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; At the concert it was during Berg's songs that the fighting began. At the trial, Straus commented that the thud of Buschbeck's punch had been the most harmonious sound at the entire concert.&lt;ref name="Barker" /&gt; For Berg's work the ''Skandalkonzert'' had lasting consequences: the songs were not performed again until 1952, and the full score did not appear in print until 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classical-scene.com/2013/03/27/scandal/|title=Centenary of a Lesser-known Scandal - The Boston Musical Intelligencer|author=Mark DeVoto|work=The Boston Musical Intelligencer|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and contemporary echo==
The first performance of Schoenberg's ''[[Gurre-Lieder|Gurrelieder]]'' was held on February 23, 1913, in the Great Hall of the Musikverein, under the direction of [[Franz Schreker]], and was an overwhelming success. But the composer, offended by the previous conservative attitude of the Viennese public, refused to accept the applause. In return, the audience took revenge a few weeks later in the next concert of contemporary works there.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', "Schoenberg, Arnold", vol. 16, p. 705.{{Verify source|date=January 2014}}&lt;!--None of the five editions of Grove's Dictionary had more than nine volumes. If this is meant to refer to the New Grove, then it should say so, but also specify whether the first (1980) or second (2001) edition is meant. The articles on Schoenberg in all of these editions are signed, not anonymous--Humphrey Searle in Grove 5 (1954), Oliver Neighbour in New Grove 1980 and (as O. W. Neighbour) 2001, so the author needs to be named, as well.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Press reports from the period mention tumultuous riots: the followers of Schoenberg, his student, and opponents yelling at each other, throwing things, disturbing the performance, destroying furniture, etc.

The famous ''fracas'' at the premiere of [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' took place in Paris two months later, on 29 May 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22691267|title=Did The Rite of Spring really spark a riot?|work=BBC News|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About||the unrelated 2016 film|The Young Messiah (film)}}
{{Refimprove|date=May 2014}}
'''''The Young Messiah''''' is a musical production of a modern adaptation of [[George Frideric Handel]]'s oratorio ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'', It was arranged by [[Tom Parker (musician)|Tom Parker]], in 1982, and featured vocals by [[Labi Siffre]], [[Madeline Bell]] and [[Vicki Brown]]. A later version was produced and arranged by [[Frank McNamara (musician)|Frank McNamara]], who also conducted the orchestra and chorus. The cast included [[Gladys Knight]], [[Chaka Khan]], [[Roger Daltrey]], [[Jeffrey Osborne]], the Irish Philharmonic Orchestra &amp; Choir and the Visual Ministry Gospel Choir. The production included a narration, ''Beware of False Prophets'', which was written by [[Frank McGuinness]] and performed by [[Aidan Quinn]]. The music integrates gospel, rock and soul sounds. 

==Background for the later version==
On October 5, 1999, the National Millennium Committee in Ireland committed the sum of IR£700,000 to fund the production of ''Messiah XXI For a New Millennium'' to be broadcast by the [[RTÉ]] as one of its flagship programs for the Millennium TV schedule. Séamus Brennan, T.D., chairman of the National Millennium Committee, felt that this production would have national significance and would appeal to all ages. He said: "There are many reasons why the Millennium Committee felt this was a musical event worthy of substantial support. It felt Messiah XXI will capture much of the excitement and anticipation the [[Millennium]] is generating while at the same time being an entirely appropriate modern day celebration of the 2000th anniversary of the birth of [[Christ]]. The fact it will be screened by RTÉ means virtually the entire population will have an opportunity to see it. It comes at a time when Irish music is flourishing and I am confident it will also receive considerable international attention. Another landmark aspect is that it is being performed for the first time in [[Dublin]] which obviously has direct historical links with [[Handel]]'s original ''Messiah'', also first performed in the city, 257 years ago."

The event was organized by Messiah XXI Productions, which included directors John Kearns and Bernard Bennett, who produced ''Faith of Our Fathers'' and Frank McNamara, an arranger and producer best known at that time for his work as the music director of RTE's ''[[The Late Late Show (Ireland)|The Late Late Show]]'' and ''The Irish Tenors''. Leading international TV director, Bill Cosel, was hired to direct the TV coverage. RTÉ hired Paula Farrell, the [[Eurovision]] set designer, to design the set. Joe Canavan was hired as lighting designer. The Executive Producer for RTÉ was Peter Feeney. The RTÉ used its largest outside broadcast unit in filming this event. The event cost IR£1.4 million (or about US$2 million) to stage and also featured a spectacular light and sound extravaganza. The production was a labor of love for the three producers, McNamara, Kearns and Bennett, who between them personally contributed a substantial portion of the budget.

John Kearns, a director of Messiah XXI Productions, said: "Our inspiration for Messiah XXI obviously came from Handel's original masterpiece and its appropriate links with the [[millennium]] and the celebration of 2,000 years of [[Christianity]]. By re-interpreting the music in a modern idiom, with popular artists, this new version will, in our view, be immediately accessible to a much wider audience. It will allow the nation at large to discover and enjoy an important part of our musical heritage, which will stand forever on audio and visual media as a reminder of our marking of the Millennium in Ireland.

"Messiah XXI will also achieve international attention and recognition as the Irish nation's contribution to the world-wide celebrations by means of international TV coverage which has been facilitated by RTE. We are indebted to RTE for their considerable support. We are delighted too with the encouragement we have received from all the churches as this will be an ecumenical and cross-border event, with a huge choir being drawn from both territories on the island."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/upload/juldec1999pr.pdf+messiah+xxi&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=22#15/ Archive of press releases from the 2000 Ireland website for the period July to December 1999 incl. quotes from Séamus Brennan &amp; John Kearns &amp; info re: organization, hiring &amp; cost of event]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two gala performances took place in Dublin, Ireland on December 4, 1999, and December 5, 1999. In addition to being broadcast during Ireland's Millennium TV schedule, the show has been shown on [[PBS]] stations throughout the [[United States]]. On October 18, 2002, Frank McNamara staged and produced a performance of ''Messiah XXI'' in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]] as part of a Gala Event for the [[President of Poland]] and dignitaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frankmcnamara.com/biography.html/ Frank McNamara official website re: Poland performance]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
===Act of Musical Sacrilege===
Although there have been other interpretations and arrangements of Handel's masterpiece by other classical musicians, including [[Mozart]]'s re-orchestration, some classical music circles considered the planning of this adaptation to be an act of musical sacrilege. The [[Irish Independent]] asked the arranger and producer [[Frank McNamara (musician)|Frank McNamara]] what he had done with Handel's masterpiece.

"In some parts of the work I've done very little alteration to the original, in other places really quite a lot. You could say I have modernised it, contemporised it and certainly made it more accessible to a broader audience. I have lost a lot of the repetition that was in the original because in today's [[MTV]] world of the 10 second audience attention span it simply didn't hold up.

"At the most drastic, I've added some tunes which are, of course, based on Handel's originals. Probably the most noticeable change is that I have added a rhythm section, what one of the event's producers John Kearns refers to as the rock'n'soul element of the piece, and there are electric guitars involved! I think I have preserved the energy of Handel's original, and hope that I have added to it in a tasteful way."

As to what Maestro McNamara did with the showstopper of the show, ''Hallelujah'', he said "It is a little different in that I have added a couple of solo lines at the beginning. Then it falls back into the original melody with, of course, a rock beat. Then, in the middle, I introduce a gospel-style piece with a gospel group before returning to Handel's original. It is such a strong piece of music it really would be like trying to reinvent the wheel if it was changed too much."

As to the charges that he was a musical vandal, he totally rejected them, saying "I come from a classical music background, and I have an honours degree in music from [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]]. Those who are criticising me are completely missing the point. Messiah XXI is not intended to replace The Messiah. It is simply a new version, like the remake of a film. ''[[West Side Story (film)|West Side Story]]'' did little damage to [[Shakespeare]]'s [[Romeo and Juliet]]; [[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]] became ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]'' and nobody complained."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unison.ie/irish_independent/stories.php3?ca=9&amp;si=529870&amp;issue_id=5424/ Irish Independent re: act of musical sacrilege controversy]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Granting of IR£700,000===
The granting of the IR£700,000 by the Millennium Committee was criticized by many who felt that a commercial venture such as this was not in need of grant aid and that it should have been given to more deserving artistic projects. However, earlier in the year the promoters of the show proposed that, should the show be a financial success, 10 per cent of any profits would be given to Irish charities until IR£700,000 was reached. This was one of the reasons the Committee decided to give the grant and felt that a profit would be made for years to come as the show was being televised all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/front/1999/1209/pfarchive.9912090003.html/ The Irish Times, 12/9/99 by Christine Newman re: granting of IR£700,000 controversy]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Train 904 bombing''', also known as the '''Christmas Massacre''', was a terror attack which occurred on December 23, 1984, in the ''[[Apennine Base Tunnel]]''. A bomb on the 904 express train (''Rapido 904'') from [[Naples]] to [[Milan]] was detonated, killing 16 and wounding 266. The bombing location was near the location of the [[Italicus Express bombing 1974|Italicus Express bombing]] ten years previously.

The motive behind the bomb attack was to distract Italian security forces from investigating the [[Sicilian Mafia]] after the testimony of the Mafia turncoat [[Tommaso Buscetta]] to Antimafia prosecutor [[Giovanni Falcone]] had led to a series of arrest warrants in September 1984 that subsequently would lead to the [[Maxi Trial]] against 474 Mafia defendants.&lt;ref name=fatto270411&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2011/04/27/rapido-904-il-mandante-fu-toto-riina-fu-il-primo-avviso-a-falcone-e-borsellino/107348/ Rapido 904: "Un intreccio tra mafia, camorra e politica"], Il Fatto Quotidiano, April 27, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Mafia boss [[Giuseppe Calò]], also known as "Pippo", was convicted for ordering and organising the attack in February 1989.

==The bombing==
On Sunday, December 23, 1984 the ''Rapido 904'' was on regular service between Naples and Milan. It was traveling northbound, overcrowded by 700 holiday passengers coming back home or visiting relatives due to the upcoming Christmas holidays.&lt;ref name=time&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,956229,00.html Italy: Tunnel of Death], Time Magazine, January 7, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; At 19:08 a bomb exploded in the ninth car, a 2nd class [[coach (rail)|coach]] in the middle of the train-set. The train was 8 kilometers into the Apennine Base Tunnel, on the Florence-Bologna line near [[Vernio]], on a long straight stretch with speed limits of up to 160&amp;nbsp;km/h at the time, and was running at 150&amp;nbsp;km/h.&lt;ref name=Vittime&gt;{{cite web|title=La Strage|url=http://www.stragetreno904.com/ST9/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=56&amp;Itemid=40|publisher=Associazione Familiari Vittime Strage del Rapido 904|accessdate=20 July 2011|language=it|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130203051239/http://www.stragetreno904.com/ST9/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=56&amp;Itemid=40|archivedate=3 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The bomb had been placed on a luggage rack whilst the train was in [[Firenze Santa Maria Novella railway station|Florence Santa Maria Novella railway station]]. Unlike train bombings in the previous decades of political turmoil, the bomb was remote controlled and was detonated while the train was well into the tunnel, in order to maximize the damage.&lt;ref name=Reti&gt;{{cite web|title=La Strage del Rapido 904|url=http://www.reti-invisibili.net/rapido904/|publisher=Reti Invisibili|accessdate=20 July 2011|language=it|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724032444/http://www.reti-invisibili.net/rapido904/|archivedate=24 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bomb exploded as planned. Its shock wave, reflected by the tunnel sides, blew out all the window glass and internal doors, throwing [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]]-like shards into the compartments. 15 died as a direct consequence of the blast, and one more died later because of the wounds. 

The emergency brake was pulled, and the train came to a stop a thousand or so meters from the blast, 8 kilometers from the northern entrance and 10 from the southern. Train conductor [[Gian Claudio Bianconcini]] – on his last journey before retiring – was wounded in the [[nape]] of his neck, but managed to reach a service telephone and call for help. Passengers were scared and stranded in the cold Apennines' winter.&lt;ref name=Reti/&gt;

==First response==
Bianconcini gave first aid to the passengers, while the gallery's neon lights were fading since the explosion had blasted away the overhead wires. Rescuers encountered problems reaching the disaster scene. Rescue vehicles gathered at the southern entrance of the tunnel, but were blocked by thick smoke emerging from it. After an hour and a half the first service vehicles dispatched to the scene could reach the stricken train, without any hint of what happened. 

Radio communications were difficult, worsened by the lack of a mobile radio link; weather was bad, the train was deep inside the tunnel and a strong smell of [[black powder]] impaired breathing. While damage and smoke impaired prompt access from the southern entrance, the wind blowing smoke south was a fortunate, avoiding smoke buildup in the tunnel and leaving the northern entrance – nearest to the emergency response center of Bologna – relatively clear.

A [[diesel-electric]] engine was brought from [[Bologna]] to recover the head section of the damaged train, allowing rescuers to reach the blown-up coach. Coaches of a rescue train were used as ambulances, ferrying the injured and taking them to [[San Benedetto Val di Sambro]] station. Underestimation of the scale of the incident led to only a single doctor being present on the rescue train. 15 ambulances took the critical patients to [[Bologna]] [[Ospedale Maggiore di Bologna|Ospedale Maggiore]], with [[Polizia di Stato]] and [[Carabinieri]] escorts. 

A special plan, developed in the wake of the many disasters of the previous decade such as the Italicus and [[Bologna bombing]], was activated for the first time and was instrumental in providing a fast response: local police reserved some roads for ambulance routes, while coordination between responders was managed by [[Bologna Soccorso]], a regional emergency management group evolved from the late CePIS (and which would eventually become the core of the national emergency response network).

After unloading its first shipment of injured, the train quickly got back to the tunnel and loaded the uninjured passengers, who were beginning to suffer from the cold wind. However smoke from its diesel engines inadvertently filled the tunnel. Passengers and responders still inside the tunnel had to be provided with oxygen masks. After the train departed, a woman was found in shock into a tunnel cavity, and was taken by foot to the nearby [[Ca' di Landino]] station. Snow began to fall while the last passengers were evacuated.

==Inquiry==
Within hours after the blast, a number of left and the right wing groups claimed responsibility. Official suspicion centered on [[neo-Fascist]] terrorists, since the attack took place on the same railway stretch at which right-wing extremists bombed the Italicus train in 1974, killing twelve and wounding 48.&lt;ref name=time/&gt;&lt;ref name=lat&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1985-01-21/news/mn-14207_1_twilight-world Italy Troubled by the Twilight World of Terrorism on the Right], Los Angeles Times, January 21, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; The Public Prosecutor Office promptly began an inquiry. A chemical and ballistic survey was commissioned in order to find the kind of explosive used and the disaster dynamics. A witness was found: he saw two people placing two bags in the 9th car luggage rack in [[Florence]] station, so the inquiry was assigned to Florence prosecutors.

In March 1985, [[Mafia boss]] [[Giuseppe Calò]] and [[Guido Cercola]] were stopped in [[Rome]] and jailed for crimes related to [[drug trafficking]]. The hideout of Calò was found on May 11 in a small rural cottage near [[Poggio San Lorenzo]] in [[Rieti]]: searches found a suitcase in the cellar, containing two smaller cases within which there were batteries, a radio receiver, a radio transmitter, antennas, wires, weapons and explosives. This explosive was checked by [[forensic]] labs in Rome and [[Florence]], and proved to be the same as the one used on Train 904.

On January 9, 1986, prosecutor [[Pierluigi Vigna]] charged Calò and Cercola with the [[massacre]]. According to the inquiry, the bombing was intended to distract the state security forces from investigating the Sicilian Mafia after the testimony of the Mafia turncoat [[Tommaso Buscetta]] to investigating Antimafia judge [[Giovanni Falcone]] had led to a series of arrest warrants in September 1984 that subsequently would lead to the [[Maxi Trial]] against 474 Mafia defendants.&lt;ref name=fatto270411/&gt;&lt;ref name=ansa270411/&gt;

Cercola was linked to a German, [[Friedrich Schaudinn]], who built electronic devices to be used in bombings. Those devices were found in Pippo Calò's home. Many links were found between Calò, the [[Camorra]] and extreme right-wing neo-Fascist groups. Calò had ties with [[Propaganda Due|P2 masonic lodge]] and the [[Banda della Magliana]], and was a well known to many Italian terrorists, including [[Cristiano Fioravanti|Cristiano]] and [[Valerio Fioravanti]], [[Massimo Carminati]] and [[Walter Sordi]].

==Trials==
The Florence Criminal Court found Pippo Calò, Cercola and people linked to them ([[Alfonso Galeota]], [[Giulio Pirozzi]] and [[Camorra]] boss [[Giuseppe Misso]]) guilty on February 25, 1989, sentencing them to life imprisonment for massacre. [[Franco Di Agostino]] was sentenced to 28 years, Schaudinn to 25 and other involved in the inquiry received minor sentences.&lt;ref name=ap250289&gt;[http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1989/Court-Convicts-Seven-Acquits-Two-In-Train-Bombing/id-ba81d9b2ead48297dad235f962ab0a3c Court convicts seven, acquits two in train bombing], Associated Press, February 25, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; A second grade trial took place on March 15, 1990, in Florence by [[Giulio Catelani]]. Calò and Cercola's jail time was confirmed, and Di Agostino was given a life sentence. Misso, Pirozzi and Galeota were discharged in regard to the massacre, but found guilty of possession of explosives. Schaudinn was found not formally linked with Mafia, and his sentence for the massacre was revised to 22 years. 

On March 5, 1991, the [[Corte di Cassazione]] presided by [[Corrado Carnevale]] unexpectedly voided the sentence. General Prosecutor [[Antonino Scopelliti]] was against the ruling, and called for a fair crime prosecution. Carnevale allowed a new trial of the suspects by the Florence court. Calò and Cercola sentences were confirmed, Di Agostino got 24 years, Schaudinn got 22. Misso's sentence was cut to three years; Galeota and Pirozzi sentence to eighteen months, their role in the massacre being deemed as marginal. 

The same day, Galeota and Pirozzi, along with latter's wife Rita Casolaro and Misso's wife [[Assunta Sarno]], were returning to Naples when their car was rammed on the A1 motorway near [[Afragola]]-[[Acerra]] exit. Killers sent by the Camorra clans opened fire, killing Galeota and Sarno (executed by a gunshot in the mouth). Giulio Pirozzi and his wife were saved by a police car which fortuitously passed on the opposite lane, causing the killers to flee. 

The Corte di Cassazione confirmed the sentences on November 24, 1992, officially recognizing a "coordinated hand by the Mafia" in the disaster. On February 18, 1994, Florence Court discharged [[Italian Social Movement|MSI]] member of Parliament [[Massimo Abbatangelo]] from the massacre charge, but deemed him guilty of giving the explosive to Misso in early 1984. Abbatangelo was sentenced to 6 years. Victims' relatives asked for a tougher sentence, but lost the appeal and had to pay for judiciary expenses.&lt;ref name=fatto270411/&gt;

Guido Cercola killed himself in [[Sulmona]]'s penitentiary on January 3, 2005. He strangled himself with shoelaces, and died while being rushed to hospital. 

On April 27, 2011, the Antimafia Office of Naples issued a custody order against Mafia "boss of bosses" [[Totò Riina]], the head of the [[Sicilian Mafia Commission]], considering him the brains behind the massacre.&lt;ref name=ansa270411/&gt; Prosecutors said that the explosive used to carry out Train 904 attack were the same used to kill Antimafia judge [[Paolo Borsellino]] and his escort in via D'Amelio on July 19, 1992.&lt;ref name=cds270411&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.corriere.it/cronache/11_aprile_27/riina-mandante-strage-treno904_8c008120-70a7-11e0-8d74-1cfa48373a9c.shtml Strage rapido 904,ordine di custodia cautelare a Riina: «Fu mandante»], Corriere della Sera, April 27, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Triplemanía IV-C''' was a major ''[[lucha libre]]'', or [[professional wrestling]], show promoted by the Mexican-based [[Lucha Libre AAA World Wide|AAA]] and was the third and final of three Triplemanía IV shows held in 1996. The event took place on July 15, 1996 at the Madero Convention center in [[Ciudad Madero]], [[Tamaulipas]], Mexico. The annual Triplemanía show(s) are AAA's biggest show of the year, serving as the culmination of major storylines and feature wrestlers from all over the world competing in what has been described as AAA's version of [[WrestleMania]] or their [[Super Bowl]] event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Madigan, Dan|title=Mondo Lucha Libre: the bizarre and honorable world of wild Mexican wrestling|publisher=HarperColins Publisher|year=2007|chapter=A family affair|pages=128–132|isbn=978-0-06-085583-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Main event featured a [[Professional wrestling match types#Cages|Steel Cage Match]] ''[[Lucha de Apuestas]]'' "Mask vs. Mask" match where the last man in the cage was forced to unmask. The teams facing off were ''Los Junior Atomicos'' ([[Máscara Sagrada Jr.]], [[Tinieblas Jr.]], [[Blue Demon Jr.]], and Halcón Dorado Jr.) and the team of [[Karis la Momia]] and ''[[Los Payasos]]'' (Coco Rojo, Coco Verde and Coco Amarillo). The show also featured a rematch of sorts from [[Triplemanía IV-B]], featuring the winner [[Pierroth Jr.]] and the last man eliminated, [[Konnan]], from the [[AAA Campeón de Campeones Championship]] match. Earlier in the show two of AAA's top young wrestlers, [[Rey Misterio Jr.]] and [[Juventud Guerrera]] wrestled in a match where both men put their brand new cars on the line.

==Production==

===Background===
Just like in 1994 and 1995 [[Lucha Libre AAA World Wide|AAA]] planned out three Triplemanía events in 1994, the [[Triplemanía IV-A|first Triplemanía IV show]] slated for May 11, the [[Triplemanía IV-B|second 
Triplemanía IV]] show was booked for June 15 in [[Orizaba, Veracruz]] and the third Triplemanía IV would take place on July 15 in [[Ciudad Madero|Madero]], [[Tamaulipas]].&lt;ref name="Trip4C"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Trip4A"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/triple.html#iv-a | title = Asistencia Asesoría y Administración TripleManía | accessdate = 2009-02-19| publisher = ProWrestlingHistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Trip4B"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/triple.html#iv-b | title = Asistencia Asesoría y Administración TripleManía | accessdate = 2009-02-19| publisher = ProWrestlingHistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Triplemanía IV-C was the tenth overall show produced under the Triplemanía banner.

===Storylines===
The Triplemanía show featured eight [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]] with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing [[Screenplay|scripted]] feuds, [[plot (narrative)|plots]] and [[narrative thread|storylines]]. Wrestlers were portrayed as either [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]] (referred to as ''rudos'' in Mexico, those that portray the "bad guys") or [[Face (professional wrestling)|faces]] (''técnicos'' in Mexico, the "good guy" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

[[File:LaParka.jpg|thumb|left|[[La Parka]], who teamed up with [[Abismo Negro|Winners]], [[Super Caló]] and El Mexicano in the fourth match of the night.]]
In late 1995 ''tecnico'' Halcón Dorado Jr. came to AAA from the UWA as it was closing its doors. In AAA he quickly found himself partnered up with a number of other "Juniors", [[Blue Demon Jr.]], [[Máscara Sagrada Jr.]] and [[Tinieblas Jr.]] to form a group that became known as ''Los Junior Atómicos''. Of the four only two of them were actually sons of the wrestlers they took the name of, Tinieblas Jr. (son of [[Tinieblas]]) and Blue Demon Jr. (Son of [[Blue Demon]]).&lt;ref name=Tinieblas&gt;{{Cite news|title=Lucha Libre: Conoce la historia de las leyendas de cuadrilátero|work=Tinieblas Jr. (1966)|location=[[Mexico]]|id=Grandes Figuras de la Lucha Libre|page=62|year=2008|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BDJr&gt;{{cite book | author= Madigan, Dan | title= Mondo Lucha Libre: the bizarre&amp; honorable world of wild Mexican wrestling | publisher= HarperColins Publisher | year= 2007 | chapter = Los Enmascarados (the masked men): Blue Demon Jr. | pages = 90–93| isbn=978-0-06-085583-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining two were billed more as "successors" and not actually children of [[Máscara Sagrada]] and Halcón Dorado.&lt;ref name="EncyParka"&gt;{{cite news | author = Enciclopedia staff | title = Enciclopedia de las Mascaras | work = Parka Jr. | location = [[Mexico City|Mexico City, Mexico]] | id = Tomo III | pages = 50 | date = October 2007 | language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EncySagradaJr"&gt;{{cite news|title=Enciclopedia de las Máscaras|work=Máscara Sagrada Jr.(primera version)|location=[[Mexico City]], [[Mexico]]|id=Tomo III|pages=29|date=October 2007|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EncyHDoradaJr"&gt;{{cite news|title=Enciclopedia de las Máscaras|work=Halcón Dorado Jr, |location=[[Mexico City]], [[Mexico]]|id=Tomo II|pages=39|date=September 2007|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a tag team match earlier in 1996 a [[Blue Demon Jr.]] dive onto [[Karis La Momia]] ("Karis the Mummy") ended badly, with the storyline being that the dive injured Karis, causing him to grab a char and attack Blue Demon Jr. during the match.&lt;ref name=AAATrip4&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.luchalibreaaa.com/eventos-magnos/triplemania/item/89-tripleman%C3%ADa-iv-los-juniors-y-los-payasos-con-karis-en-guerra.html | title=Triplemanía IV: Los Juniors y Los Payasos con Karis en Guerra | accessdate=July 13, 2015 | publisher=[[Asistencia Asesoría y Administración]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The storyline soon saw Karis la Momoa recruit ''[[Los Payasos]]'' ("The Clowns"; Coco Rojo, Coco Verde and Coco Amarillo) a trio of "Evil clowns". which brought out Blue Demon Jr.'s fellow ''Junior Atómicos'' to even the odds.&lt;ref name=YIR1996/&gt; On May 15, 2015 Karis defeated Blue Demon Jr. to win the Mexican National Cruiserweight Championship during a show [[Naucalpan]], [[Mexico State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Lucha 2000 Staff | title = Los Reyes de Mexico: La Historia de Los Campeonatos Nacionales | work =Lucha 2000 | id = Especial 21 | date = December 20, 2004 | language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Triplemanía IV-B the two sides met in a regular eight-man "Atómicos" tag team elimination match where ''Los Junior Atómicos'' won by disqualification.&lt;ref name="Trip4B"/&gt; Subsequently all eight wrestlers agreed to put their masks on the line in a [[steel cage match]], where each competitor would have to climb out of the cage in order to keep their mask safe, with the last man remaining in the cage being forced to unmask under ''[[Lucha de Apuestas]]'', or "bet match" rules.

[[Rey Misterio Jr.]] and [[Juventud Guerrera]]'s early careers in AAA had been intertwined for several years by the time Triplemanía IV-C came around, with the two young wrestlers having faced off repeatedly inside and outside of Mexico. At [[Triplemanía II-B]], Juventud Guerrera, his father [[Fuerza Guerrera]] and [[Misterioso (wrestler)|Misterioso]] defeated Rey Misterio Jr., his uncle [[Rey Misterio]] and [[Super Parka|Volador]] in their first major show encounter.&lt;ref name="Trip2B"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/triple.html#ii-b | title = Asistencia Asesoría y Administración TripleManía | accessdate =July 13, 2015| publisher = ProWrestlingHistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 30, 1994 Rey Misterio Jr. defeated Juventud Guerrera to win the [[WWA World Lightweight Championship]] on an AAA show in [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas]].&lt;ref name=WWALight&gt;{{cite book | author=Royal Duncan &amp; Gary Will | title=Wrestling Title Histories | publisher=Archeus Communications | chapter= Mexico: WWA Lightweight Title | page= 400 | year= 2000 | isbn=0-9698161-5-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three months later, on February 2, 1995 Rey Misterio and Rey Misterio Jr. successfully defended the [[WWA Tag Team Championship (Mexico)|WWA World Tag Team Championship]] against Fuerza and Juventud Guerrera.&lt;ref name=YIR1995&gt;{{cite news|title=1995 Especial!|work=Box y Lucha Magazine|pages=2–28|id=issue 2228|date=January 9, 1996|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; A month later the Guerreras would win the WWA Tag Team Championship when Juventud Guerrera pinned Rey Misterio Jr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Royal Duncan and Gary Will | title=Wrestling Title Histories | publisher=Archeus Communications | chapter= Mexico: WWA Tag Team Title | page= 401 | year= 2000 | isbn=0-9698161-5-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; By pinning Misterio Jr. Juventud Guerrera also regained the WWA World Lightweight Championship.&lt;ref name=WWALight/&gt; On June 16, 1995 Rey Misterio Jr. regained the WWA World Lightweight Championship.&lt;ref name=WWALight/&gt; On January 31, 1996 both Rey Misterio Jr. and Juventud Guerrera would place their personal cars on the line in a steel cage match, but during the match both wrestlers ended up stumbling off the top of the cage, landing on the top bar of the cage, unable to continue the match which was declared a draw.&lt;ref name=YIR1996/&gt; In the early summer it was announced that the two would face once more and once again both wrestlers would "bet" their brand new car on the outcome of the match at Triplemanía IV-C.

==Event==
[[File:ReyMysterio.jpg|thumb|[[Rey Mysterio|Rey Misterio Jr.]], won ownership of [[Juventud Guerrera]]'s car]]
For the match between Rey Misterio Jr. and Juventud Guerrera Rey Misterio Jr. was accompanied by [[Super Caló]] while Guerera had [[X-Fly|Mosco de la Merced]] in his corner. The match quickly went out of control with the referee not counting when the two fought on the floor, treating the match as a no-disqualification match. After a long match where neither man could gain a decisive advantage Pierroth Jr. came to ringside and helped Guerrera and Mosco de la Merced attack Rey Misterio Jr. Mosco and Pierroth Jr. tired Misterio Jr.'s hands, making him helpless to block Guerrera's attack with a [[Kendo stick]]. After a couple of blows with the Kendo stick the masked ''rudo'' known as [[The Killer (wrestler)|The Killer]] came to the ring to help out. An exhausted Juventud Guerrera gave Killer the Kendo Stick, but instead of hitting Rey Misterio Jr. the Killer turned to Guerrera and hit him over the head with the Kendo Stick several times, then pulled off his mask to reveal that it was actually [[Konnan]] under the mask. After chasing off both Pierroth Jr. and Mosoco Rey Misterio Jr. was finally able to roll up Juventud Guerrera for the pinfall victory. With the victory the storyline was that Misterio Jr. now owned Juventud Guerrera's car.&lt;ref name="Trip4C"/&gt;&lt;ref name=AAATrip4&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.luchalibreaaa.com/eventos-magnos/triplemania/item/89-tripleman%C3%ADa-iv-los-juniors-y-los-payasos-con-karis-en-guerra.html | title=Triplemanía IV: Los Juniors y Los Payasos con Karis en Guerra | accessdate=July 13, 2015 | publisher=[[Asistencia Asesoría y Administración]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=YIR1996/&gt;

The confrontation between Konnan and Pierroth Jr. was just a preview for their match later that night, in the semi-final position of the show. The two faced off in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Strap match|Dog collar match]], which meant that the two were joined together by a long steel chain that was connected to a dog collar around the neck of each competitor. The collar was then locked to prevent one of the wrestlers from getting out of the collar during the match. At some point Pierroth Jr. either stole the key from the referee, or had a spare key hidden somewhere as he was able to take off his collar, use the freedom of movement to tie up Konnan and hit him repeatedly with the steel chain. With Konnan down Pierroth Jr. was able to touch the top turnbuckle on all four corners, which was how the match was won.&lt;ref name=AAATrip4/&gt;&lt;ref name=YIR1996/&gt;

In the main event cage match wrestlers could escape the cage and thus unmasking only by climbing over the top of the cage and all the way to the floor. The first escapee was Coco Armarillo who climbed over the top within minutes of the opening bell. When Máscara Sagrada Jr. tried to escape the Killer, the real one this time, climbed up the cage from the outside and pushed Máscara Sagrada Jr. off the top of the cage, back inside the ring. A few minutes later Coco Azul was able to leave the cage as well, leaving his two partners at a four-on-two disadvantage in the cage. During the match [[El Alebrije (wrestler)|Máscara Sagrada]] tried to even the sides as he tried to prevent the Killer from interfering on several occasions. When Tinieblas Jr. climbed the cage the Killer tried to stop him as he had done before, but this time Tinieblas Jr. was able to knock Killer down and become the third man to leave the cage, moments later Máscara Sagrada Jr. also left the cage. At this point [[Lady Victoria]], who was siding with ''Los Payasos'' and Karis locked [[Miss Janeth]] to the cage with a pair of handcuffs. Blue Demon Jr. managed to kick a chair into the face of Karis La Momia and then use the break in the action to climb over the top of the cage to the floor. When the match came down to Karis La Momia and Halcón Dorado Jr. [[Tzuki|Máscarita Sagráda Jr.]] ran to ringside to help his regular-sized friends out, helping unlock the handcuffs used on Miss Janeth. Looking to help out the diminutive ''[[Mini-Estrella]]'' climbed up the outside of the cage and dove off the top. He intended to hit Karis La Momia, but at the last moment Karis moved and Máscarita Sagráda Jr. landed on Halcón Dorado Jr. instead. Karis use the opening to handcuff Máscarita Sagráda Jr. to Halcón Dorado Jr., then began to climb the cage, when Halcón Dorado Jr. tried to stop him he was slowed down by the fact that he was dragging Máscarita Sagráda Jr. behind him, making him too late to stop Karis from leaving the cage. After the match a frustrated Halcón Dorado Jr. revealed that his real name was Antonio Olmos, then angrily pulled his mask off and attacked Máscarita Sagráda Jr. and Máscara Sagráda Jr. blaming them for his mask loss.&lt;ref name="Trip4C"/&gt;&lt;ref name=AAATrip4/&gt;&lt;ref name=YIR1996/&gt;

==Aftermath==
With Halcón Dorado Jr.'s unmasking and betrayal the storyline with Karis la Momia and ''Los Payasos'' ended. Approximately six months later ''Los Junior Atómicos'' introduced a new member, [[La Parka Jr.]], who was in fact Karis La Momia under a new mask and identity.&lt;ref name=MondoParka&gt;{{cite book|author=Madigan, Dan|title=Mondo Lucha A Go-Go: the bizarre and honorable world of wild Mexican wrestling|publisher=HarperColins Publisher|year=2007|chapter=La Parka|pages=120–124|isbn=978-0-06-085583-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dorado Jr. worked as a ''rudo'', often teaming with [[Cien Caras]] over the subsequent months but had left AAA by the end of 1996.&lt;ref name=YIR1996/&gt;

Konnan's loss to Pierroth Jr. turned out to be his last match at a major AAA event for eight years. By the fall of 1996 Konnan and a number of other AAA wrestlers broke away from AAA as they wanted to present shows that were more [[hardcore wrestling]] style of show inspired by [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] out of [[Philadelphia|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], something AAA owner [[Antonio Peña]] was not in favor off.&lt;ref name=YIR1996/&gt; Just like Peña had left [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] with a number of younger wrestlers, very talented leaving with him in 1992 Konnan took a large number of AAA's younger, talented wrestlers with him when he left the company in the fall of 1996.&lt;ref name=YIR1996/&gt;

==Reception==
In a 2000 article about the history of the Triplemanía up until that point [[Canadian Online Explorer]] wrestling writer John Molinario stated that the overall booking of the Triplemanía IV shows was "uninspired and repetitive. Pena recycled old angles that no longer registered with his audience."&lt;ref name=TripleSlam&gt;{{cite web | url=http://slam.canoe.com/SlamWrestlingInternational/triplemania.html | title=TripleMania: Mexico's answer to WrestleMania | first=John F. | last=Molinaro | year=2000 | accessdate=June 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wrestling commentator and ''lucha libre'' expert [[Mike Tenay]] noted that "Pena's poor promotional background and track record finally haunted him" stating that at this point AAA no longer had the big name stars to overcome the lack of advertising from AAA's side.&lt;ref name=TripleSlam/&gt; [[Wrestling Observer Newsletter]] editor [[Dave Meltzer]] noted that by 1996 the Triplemanía show became "just a name for a bigger than average house show rather than the first year where it was like a [[WrestleMania]]."&lt;ref name=TripleSlam/&gt;

'''USNS ''Impeccable'' (T-AGOS-23)''' is an [[Impeccable class ocean surveillance ship|''Impeccable''-class]] [[ocean surveillance ship]] acquired by the [[U.S. Navy]] in 2001 and assigned to [[Military Sealift Command]]'s [[Special Missions Program]].

==Construction==
''Impeccable'' was built by [[American Shipbuilding]], [[Tampa, Florida]]. The contract was awarded on 28 March 1991. The ship's keel was laid down on 15 March 1992, but the Tampa shipyards went bankrupt by November 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE3D6123FF936A35752C1A965958260 |title= AMERICAN SHIP SEEKS BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION | work=The New York Times | date=5 November 1993 | accessdate=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 December 1992, the General Accounting Office published a report that concluded that T-AGOS 24–27 should not be built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gao.gov/products/NSIAD-93-53 |title=Navy Continues to Build Ships Designed for Soviet Threat }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards the government decided to discontinue this class of ships, but the ''Impeccable'' was to be completed as the sole ship in its class. The hull was towed to [[Gulfport, Mississippi]], in 1995 where it was finished by Halter Marine Inc.&lt;ref name=nvr&gt;{{cite web |url={{NVR url|id=AGOS23}} |title=USNS IMPECCABLE (T-AGOS 23) |date= 21 October 2004 |work=[[Naval Vessel Register]] |publisher= [[United States Navy]] |accessdate=11 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was launched on 28 August 1998 and was delivered to the Navy on 22 March 2001 which assigned her to the [[Military Sealift Command]] (MSC) [[Special Missions Program]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msc.navy.mil/inventory/ships.asp?ship=106&amp;type=OceanSurveillanceShip Ship Inventory – USNS IMPECCABLE   (T-AGOS 23) – Ocean Surveillance Ship] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312071850/http://www.msc.navy.mil/inventory/ships.asp?ship=106&amp;type=OceanSurveillanceShip |date=12 March 2009 }}, Military Sealift Command&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
The ship is a designated [[T-AGOS]] vessel built to tow a [[Surveillance Towed Array Sensor System]]. The ship's [[catamaran]]-type [[small waterplane area twin hull]] (SWATH) design prevents the vessel from rolling in heavy seas and gives additional deck space for storing the acoustic equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ship/tagos-23.htm T-AGOS 23 Impeccable – Swath-L (Large) Ocean Surveillance Ship]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
The mission of ''Impeccable'' is to directly support the Navy by using [[SURTASS]] passive and active low frequency [[sonar]] arrays to detect and track undersea threats. {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

==Operational history==

===Low Frequency Active Sonar===
{{Main|Surveillance Towed Array Sensor System}}
*The SURTASS [[Low Frequency Active Sonar]] system, onboard ''Impeccable'', commenced sea trials in late February 2004. During the spring and summer of 2004, ''Impeccable'' conducted five training missions in the Philippine Sea and the northwest Pacific Ocean . All LFA sonar operations included the operation of the ''High Frequency / Marine Mammal Mitigation'' sonar and compliance with all mitigation requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://frwebgate1.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/TEXTgate.cgi?WAISdocID=030769258598+0+1+0&amp;WAISaction=retrieve |title=Federal Register: August 25, 2005 (Volume 70, Number 164) }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Total operational days on board the Impeccable using the LFA array:
:(15 August 2003 to 15 August 2004) 26.2 days with 63.0 hours of transmissions
:(15 August 2004 to 15 August 2005)  9.4 days with 22.7 hours of transmissions
:(15 August 2005 to 15 August 2006) 22.5 days with 39.4 hours of transmissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/pdfs/permits/surtass_lfa_final_report.pdf |title=SURTASS/LFA Final Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The ship had five years of active and passive operations in the Western Pacific before the incident in the South China Sea.

===South China Sea incidents===
[[File:USNS Impeccable–SCSea incident02.jpg|thumb|left|Two Chinese trawlers stop directly in front of the ''Impeccable'', forcing the ship to conduct an emergency "all stop" in order to avoid collision.]]
On 5 March 2009, the ''Impeccable'' was in the [[South China Sea]] monitoring submarine activity&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29623425 Officials: Ship in China spat was hunting subs] [[MSNBC]] 10 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; when it was approached by a [[People's Liberation Army Navy]] (PLAN) [[frigate]], which crossed its bow at a range of approximately 100 yards without first making contact. This was followed less than two hours later by a Chinese [[Harbin Y-12|Y-12]] aircraft, conducting 11&amp;nbsp;flyovers of ''Impeccable'' at an altitude of {{convert|600|ft}} and a range from {{convert|100|-|300|ft|-1}}. The frigate then crossed ''Impeccable''{{'s}} bow again, this time at a range of approximately 400–500&amp;nbsp;yards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://military.rightpundits.com/2009/03/09/usns-impeccable-chinese-vessels-harass-us-navy-ship/ USNS Impeccable: Chinese Vessels Harass US Navy Ship] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312033301/http://military.rightpundits.com/2009/03/09/usns-impeccable-chinese-vessels-harass-us-navy-ship/ |date=12 March 2009 }}, 9 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/03/09/us.navy.china/index.html Pentagon says Chinese vessels harassed U.S. ship], [[CNN]]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 March, a Chinese intelligence ship contacted the ''Impeccable'' over bridge-to-bridge radio, calling her operations illegal and directing ''Impeccable'' to leave the area or "suffer the consequences."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601080&amp;sid=aUMS9YLJ2OmM&amp;refer=asia Chinese Vessels Harass U.S. Navy Ship, Pentagon Says], ''[[Bloomberg L.P.]]'', 9 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 March 2009, the ''Impeccable'' was 75&amp;nbsp;miles south of [[Hainan]], China, when it was shadowed by five Chinese ships: a Bureau of Maritime Fisheries Patrol Vessel, a [[State Oceanic Administration]] patrol vessel, a PLA Navy ocean surveillance ship, and two Chinese-flagged [[naval trawler]]s, which maneuvered close to the ''Impeccable'', with two closing in to {{convert|50|ft}}, waving Chinese flags, and ordering the ''Impeccable'' from the area.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jLGjotiM5K34OisyYCFafERRGJ7wD96QID000 Pentagon: Chinese vessels harassed unarmed ship], ''[[Associated Press]]'', 9 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://oceanengineering.blogspot.com/2009/03/usns-impeccable.html&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Impeccable'' sprayed water at one of the nearest Chinese ships; the Chinese sailors stripped down to their underwear and their vessel closed in to within 25&amp;nbsp;feet of the American ship. Shortly after the incident, the ''Impeccable'' radioed the Chinese crews, informing them of its intentions to leave the area, and requesting a safe pass to travel. When it was trying to leave the area, the two Chinese trawlers dropped pieces of wood in the ''Impeccable'''s path and stopped directly in front of it, forcing it to do an [[emergency stop]] to avoid a collision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29596179/ U.S. protests harassing of Navy ship by Chinese], ''[[MSNBC]]'', 9 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WP0309"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/09/AR2009030900956.html?hpid=moreheadlines U.S. Protests 'Harassment' of Navy Ship by Chinese Vessels], ''[[Washington Post]]'', 9 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Once the ''Impeccable'' got under way, the crew aboard one of the trawlers used a grappling hook to try to snag ''Impeccable's'' towed sonar array.&lt;ref name="msnbc"&gt;[http://deepbackground.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2009/03/09/1829183.aspx Close call off South China Sea], [[MSNBC]], 9 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Paracel 88.png|thumb|right|The [[Hainan Submarine Base]] is on the island of Hainan. The nearby [[Paracel Islands]] are administered by China, but claimed by both Vietnam and Taiwan]]

The United States lodged formal protests following the incident, stating that under international law, the U.S. military can conduct activities "in waters beyond the territorial sea of another state without prior notification or consent" including in an [[exclusive economic zone]] of another country. "The unprofessional maneuvers by Chinese vessels violated the requirement under international law to operate with due regard for the rights and safety of other lawful users of the ocean."&lt;ref name="WP0309"/&gt;&lt;ref name="REUTERS"&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/politicsNews/idUSTRE52845A20090309 U.S. says Chinese vessels harassed Navy ship], ''[[Reuters]]'', 9 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; China's Foreign Ministry responded that the Pentagon's complaint that five Chinese vessels had harassed the ''Impeccable'' were "totally inaccurate",&lt;ref name="China hits out at US on navy row"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-03/10/content_10983647.htm Foreign Ministry says the USNS ''Impeccable'' violating international and Chinese law], ''[[Xinhua]]'', 10 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; although this claim was disputed by several released reports, which all state that the ''Impeccable'' was interfered with numerous times, both while operating in the area and when attempting to leave.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090310/ap_on_go_ca_st_pe/us_china_incident&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/10/south-china-navy | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Stand-off shows Chinese navy's secret tactics | first=Ed | last=Pilkington | date=10 March 2009 | accessdate=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huliq.com/3257/78221/spy-ship-usns-impeccable-harassed-chinese-ships-report&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 March 2009, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] gave the go-ahead to send the [[guided missile destroyer]] [[USS Chung-Hoon (DDG-93)|USS ''Chung-Hoon'']] (DDG-93) to the South China Sea to protect the ''Impeccable'' while operating in that area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article5898650.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=US warships head for South China Sea after standoff | first=Tim | last=Reid | date=14 March 2009 | accessdate=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/12/AR2009031203264.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Navy Sends Destroyer to Protect Surveillance Ship After Incident in South China Sea | date=13 March 2009 | accessdate=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/03/12/obama-meet-chinese-foreign-minister-ship-confrontation | work=Fox News | title=Obama Calls for Improved Military Dialogue Between U.S. and China, After Naval Confrontation | date=12 March 2009 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090315013825/http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/03/12/obama-meet-chinese-foreign-minister-ship-confrontation/ | archivedate=15 March 2009 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hans M. Kristensen]] of the [[Federation of American Scientists]] has suggested that the incident may be related to the classified [[Type 093 submarine]] that the Chinese navy had recently deployed in the area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.org/blog/ssp/2009/03/incident.php US-Chinese Anti-Submarine Cat and Mouse Game in South China Sea]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Views on the legality of US and Chinese actions during these incidents====
China and the United States both maintain the rightfulness of their actions based on competing interpretations of the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]].

==2015 rescue at sea==
On July 19, 2015 while en route for a scheduled port visit to [[Subic Bay]], USNS ''Impeccable'' (T-AGOS 23) rescued 11 fishermen. ''Impeccable'' sailors spotted personnel on a partially submerged ship and noted debris in the water. "They [''Impeccable'' crew] initially spotted only eight people on the partially submerged vessel," said Lt. Cory Hilgart, the theater anti-submarine watch officer at Commander, Task Force 74. "They then realized that it was actually 11 and made the call to commence the rescue effort." The ''Impeccable'''s master immediately deemed assistance was required and began preparations to deploy their [[rigid hull inflatable boat]] (RHIB) to rescue the personnel. "This was a team effort with civilian mariners, SECDET [security detachment], MILDET [military detachment] and Lockheed Martin working together to achieve an efficient rescue of all 11 fishermen," said Robert Wiechert, Master of the ''Impeccable''. The RHIB made three trips to the distressed vessel and recovered all 11 individuals. "One of the crew members spoke English," said Hilgart. "He told the ''Impeccable'' crew that they were fishermen from the Subic Bay region. He confirmed that there were only 11 on board." Once the mariners were brought aboard ''Impeccable'', they were examined by medical personnel and given food and water. No serious injuries or illnesses were reported. Shortly after Impeccable arrived in port in Subic Bay, July 20, all 11 mariners were turned over to the [[Philippine Coast Guard]].

==Honors and awards==
''Impeccable'' personnel are qualified for the following medals:
* [[National Defense Service Medal]]

'''Ulnar collateral ligament injuries''' can occur during certain activities such as overhead [[baseball pitching]]. Acute or chronic disruption and/or attenuation of the ulnar collateral ligament often result in medial elbow pain, [[Cubitus valgus|valgus]] instability, neurologic deficiency, and impaired throwing performance. There are both non-surgical and surgical treatment options.&lt;ref name="HoffmanProtzman2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoffman|first1=James K.|last2=Protzman|first2=Nicole M.|last3=Malhotra|first3=Amit D.|title=Biologic Augmentation of the Ulnar Collateral Ligament in the Elbow of a Professional Baseball Pitcher|journal=Case Reports in Orthopedics|volume=2015|year=2015|pages=1–5|issn=2090-6749|doi=10.1155/2015/130157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Anatomy of the ulnar collateral ligament in the pitcher's elbow.png|thumb|Anatomy of the ulnar collateral ligament in the pitcher's elbow]]
Pain along the inside of the [[elbow]] is the main symptom of this condition. Throwing athletes report it occurs most often during the acceleration phase of throwing. Closing the hand and clenching the fist has also been shown to reproduce the painful symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Randale C. |last=Sechrest |work=eOrthopod |publisher=Medical Multimedia Group |year=2009 |title=Ulnar collateral ligament injuries |url=http://www.eorthopod.com/ulnar-collateral-ligament-injuries/topic/222}}&lt;/ref&gt; The injury is often associated with an experience of a sharp “pop” in the elbow, followed by pain during a single throw.&lt;ref&gt;{{EMedicine|article|97451|Ulnar Collateral Ligament Injury}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, swelling and bruising of the elbow, loss of elbow [[range of motion]], and a sudden decrease in throwing velocity are all common symptoms of a UCL injury. If the injury is less severe, pain can be minimal with complete rest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Sports Injury Info |year=2010 |title=Ulnar collateral ligament sprain |url=http://www.sports-injury-info.com/ulnar-collateral-ligament-sprain.html |first=Barton |last=Anderson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
The UCL is important because it stabilizes the elbow from being abducted. If intense or repeated bouts of valgus stress occur on the UCL, injury will most likely transpire. Damage to the ulnar collateral ligament is common among [[baseball]] pitchers and javelin throwers because the throwing motion is similar. Physicians believe repetitive movements, especially pitching in baseball, cause adolescents' UCL injuries. Furthermore, physicians have stated that if an adolescent throws over 85 throws for 8 months or more in a year, or throw when exhausted, the adolescent has a significantly higher risk of succumbing to a UCL surgery.&lt;ref&gt;Fleisig, Glenn S., et al. "Prevention of elbow injuries in youth baseball pitchers." Current sports medicine reports 8.5 (2009): 250-254.&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Gridiron football]], [[racquet sports]], [[ice hockey]] and [[water polo]] players have also been treated for damage to the ulnar collateral ligament.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.athleticadvisor.com/Injuries/UE/ucl_injuries.htm{{full citation needed|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mirowitz |first1=S A |last2=London |first2=S L |title=Ulnar collateral ligament injury in baseball pitchers: MR imaging evaluation |journal=Radiology |volume=185 |issue=2 |pages=573–6 |year=1992 |pmid=1410375 |doi=10.1148/radiology.185.2.1410375 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific overhead movements like those that occur during [[baseball pitching]], tennis serving or [[volleyball spiking]] increase the risk of UCL injury.&lt;ref name="Hariri-2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hariri |first1=Sanaz |last2=Safran |first2=Marc R. |title=Ulnar Collateral Ligament Injury in the Overhead Athlete |journal=Clinics in Sports Medicine |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=619–44 |year=2010 |pmid=20883901 |doi=10.1016/j.csm.2010.06.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the cocking phase of pitching, the shoulder is horizontally abducted, externally rotated and the elbow is flexed. There is slight stress on the UCL in this position but it increases when the shoulder is further externally rotated. The greater the stress the more the UCL is stretched causing [[strain (injury)|strain]]. During the overhead throwing motion, valgus stress on the medial elbow occurs during arm cocking and acceleration. The initiation of valgus stress occurs at the conclusion of the arm-cocking phase. In the transitional moment from arm cocking to arm acceleration, the shoulder vigorously rotates internally, the forearm is in near full supination, and the elbow flexes from 90° to approximately 125°. From late cocking to ball release, the elbow rapidly extends from approximately 125° to 25° at ball release.&lt;ref&gt;leisig GS, Escamilla RF: Biomechanics of the elbow in the throwing athlete. Oper Tech Sports Med 4: 62 –68,1996&lt;/ref&gt; This causes tremendous valgus stress and tensile strain on the UCL. Injuries to the ulnar collateral ligament are believed to result from poor throwing mechanics, overuse, high throwing velocities, and throwing certain types of pitches, such as [[curveball]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://carlykreps.tripod.com/tommyjohn/id3.html{{full citation needed|date=September 2015}}{{self-published inline|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poor mechanics along with high repetition of these overhead movements can cause irritation, micro-tears or ruptures of the UCL. Injuries to the Ulnar Collateral Ligament in baseball players are rarely due to one-time, traumatic events. Rather, they are more often due to small chronic tears that accumulate over time.
==Anatomy==
{{further|Ulnar collateral ligament of the elbow}}
The [[ulnar collateral ligament of elbow joint|ulnar collateral ligament]] (UCL, also known as medial collateral ligament) is located on the medial side of the [[elbow]]. The UCL complex comprises three [[ligaments]]: the anterior oblique, posterior oblique and transverse ligaments.&lt;ref name="Safran-2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Safran |first1=Marc |last2=Ahmad |first2=Christopher S. |last3=Elattrache |first3=Neal S. |title=Ulnar Collateral Ligament of the Elbow |journal=Arthroscopy |volume=21 |issue=11 |pages=1381–95 |year=2005 |pmid=16325092 |doi=10.1016/j.arthro.2005.07.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The anterior oblique ligament (AOL) attaches from the undersurface of the medial [[epicondyle]] to the medial [[ulna]]r surface slightly below the [[coronoid process of the ulna|coronoid process]].&lt;ref name="Saunders"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zarins |first1=Bertram |last2=Andrews |first2=James Rheuben |last3=Carson |first3=William George |title=Injuries to the throwing arm: based on the proceedings of the national conference |year=1985 |publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |isbn=0-7216-1416-7 |pages= }}{{page needed|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the sturdiest of the three sections within the UCL. The AOL acts as the primary restraint against [[valgus stress]] at the elbow during flexion and extension. The posterior oblique originates at the medial epicondyle and inserts along the mid-portion of the medial [[semilunar notch]].&lt;ref name="Safran-2005"/&gt; It applies more stability against valgus stress when the elbow is flexed rather than extended. The transverse ligament connects to the inferior medial coronoid process of the ulna to the medial tip of the olecranon.&lt;ref name="Safran-2005"/&gt; Since it is connected to the same bone and not across the elbow joint, the transverse ligament has no contribution to the joint’s stability.

==Diagnosis==
In most cases, a physician will diagnose an ulnar collateral ligament injury using a patient’s medical history and a physical examination that includes a [[valgus stress]] test. The valgus stress test is performed on both arms and a positive test is indicated by pain on the affected arm that is not present on the uninvolved side.&lt;ref&gt;http://at.uwa.edu/Special%20Tests/SpecialTests/UpperBody/elbow%20Main.htm{{full citation needed|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=O'Driscoll |first1=Shawn W. M. |last2=Lawton |first2=Richard L. |last3=Smith |first3=Adam M. |title=The 'Moving Valgus Stress Test' for Medial Collateral Ligament Tears of the Elbow |journal=The American Journal of Sports Medicine |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=231–9 |year=2005 |pmid=15701609 |doi=10.1177/0363546504267804 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Physicians often utilize imaging techniques such as [[ultrasound]], [[x-rays]] and [[magnetic resonance imaging]] or [[arthroscopic surgery]] to aid with making a proper diagnosis.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}
===Classification===
A slow and chronic deterioration of the ulnar collateral ligament can be due to repetitive stress acting on the [[ulna]].  At first, pain can be bearable and can worsen to an extent where it can terminate an athlete’s career.  The repetitive stress placed on the ulna causes micro tears in the ligament resulting in the loss of structural integrity over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Morrey |first1=Bernard F. |last2=An |first2=Kai-Nan |title=Articular and ligamentous contributions to the stability of the elbow joint |journal=The American Journal of Sports Medicine |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=315–9 |year=1983 |pmid=6638246 |doi=10.1177/036354658301100506 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The acute rupture is less common compared to the slow deterioration injury.  The acute rupture occurs in collisions when the elbow is in [[flexion]] such as that in a wrestling match or a tackle in football.  The ulnar collateral ligament distributes over fifty percent of the medial support of the elbow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hotchkiss |first1=Robert N. |last2=Weiland |first2=Andrew J. |title=Valgus stability of the elbow |journal=Journal of Orthopaedic Research |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=372–7 |year=1987 |pmid=3625360 |doi=10.1002/jor.1100050309 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Maloney |first1=Michael D. |last2=Mohr |first2=Karen J. |last3=El Attrache |first3=Neal S. |title=Elbow injuries in the throwing athlete. Difficult diagnoses and surgical complications |journal=Clinics in Sports Medicine |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=795–809 |year=1999 |pmid=10553236 |doi=10.1016/S0278-5919(05)70185-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This can result in an ulnar collateral ligament injury or a dislocated elbow causing severe damage to the elbow and the [[Radius (bone)|radioulnar]] joints.

==Treatments==
[[File:Grip strengthening exercises.JPG|thumb|upright|Grip strengthening exercises]]
[[File:Pronating forearm.JPG|thumb|upright|Pronating forearm]]
[[File:Supination exercise.JPG|thumb|upright|Supination exercise]]
UCL injuries may or may not require surgery.  Non surgical treatment will primarily focus on strengthening the elbow joint to regain strength and stability.&lt;ref name="hopkinsortho"&gt;http://www.hopkinsortho.org/ucl.html{{full citation needed|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; First a course of 
[[RICE (medicine)|RICE]] (Rest, ice, compression, elevation) is typically coupled with [[NSAIDS]] (Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) to help alleviate pain and swelling.  When the swelling has subsided, individual exercises or physical therapy may be prescribed to strengthen muscles around the elbow joint to compensate for tearing in the UCL.&lt;ref name="hopkinsortho" /&gt; These may include [[biceps]] curls (non resistance and resistance), pronating and supinating the forearm, and grip strengthening exercises, performed with low resistance and moderate repetitions no more than three times a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{EMedicine|article|97451|Ulnar Collateral Ligament Injury|treatment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surgical treatment may help restore the ability to perform the overhand throwing motions most commonly associated with UCL injuries. The reconstructive surgery, generally known as [[Tommy John surgery]], was first performed by Dr. Frank Jobe in 1974 and has modified several times over the past 30 years.&lt;ref name="Erickson, Brandon J 2015"&gt;Erickson, Brandon J. "The epidemic of Tommy John surgery: the role of the orthopedic surgeon." Am J Orthop (Belle Mead NJ) 44.1 (2015): E36-37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Molenaars|first=Rik J.|last2=Hilgersom|first2=Nick F.

The new tendon is attached by drilling holes in the [[medial epicondyle of the humerus]] and the sublime tubercle of the ulna and lacing the tendon through them in a figure eight.&lt;ref name="hopkinsortho"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.athleticadvisor.com/injuries/UE/ucl_injuries.htm{{full citation needed|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The patient may begin [[physical therapy]] shortly after. It usually takes about 15 months after the surgery for standard rehabilitation. In study conducted by Dr. Frederick Azar, 78 Tommy John surgeries were performed and analyzed after the surgeries. Of the 78 patients, 8 of them (8.8%) reported complications. Two patients had superficial infections that resolved with oral antibiotics, two patients reported tightness of tenderness at the surgery site, and one had a superficial wound infection at the elbow incision that resolved with oral antibiotics. One patient developed postoperative ulnar nerve damage. Two patients had damages to the posteromedial part of the olecranon and required to have reoperation.&lt;ref&gt;Azar, Frederick M., et al. "Operative treatment of ulnar collateral ligament injuries of the elbow in athletes." The American Journal of Sports Medicine 28.1 (2000): 16-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent studies have shown that MLB pitchers who undergo Tommy John surgery return to pitch in the MLB 83% of the time and only 3% fail to return to pitch in the MLB or the minor league.&lt;ref name="Erickson, Brandon J 2015"/&gt;

Recently, there has been a recorded increase of Tommy John surgery. The increase is related to the false perception that the surgery improves the stability of the UCL joint. Many athletes believe in this false perception and cause them to lie about their symptoms in hopes to undergo the surgery. In order to combat these rumors, physicians are motivated to educate the public that Tommy John surgeries are only for those who have severe UCL injuries. The surgery will have an insignificant effect if the patient does not have a severe UCL injury.&lt;ref&gt;Longman, Jere. "Fit young pitchers see elbow repair as cure-all." The New York Times (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[tendon]] chosen is then woven in a figure eight pattern through the humerus and ulna, which holes were first drilled in the bones.&lt;ref name="Bernas-2009"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bernas |first1=G.

==Epidemiology==
According to the [[International Classification of Diseases]], 9th Revision, Clinical Modification, ICD-9-CM, in 2008 the U.S. listed the diagonsis code for UCL injury as 841.1: Sprain ulnar collateral ligament.  There were a total of 336 discharges of UCL injuries.  Within the total discharges, separated by age groups: 18- to 44-year-olds; 165 people (49.17%). 45- to 64-year-olds; 91 (27.08%). 65- to 84-year-olds, 65 (19.35%) it shows that the ulnar collateral ligament injuries were more commonly found in men than women.  There were 213 men compared to 123 women with ulnar collateral ligament injury.  Most of these injuries were also paid through private insurance (170: 50.63%) and Medicare (70: 20.85%).&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality - Advancing Excellence in Health Care. {{cite web |url=http://hcupnet.ahrq.gov/HCUPnet.jsp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150301023658/http://hcupnet.ahrq.gov/HCUPnet.jsp |archivedate=2015-03-01 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The average estimated cost for the surgery also known as [[Tommy John surgery]] is $21,563.&lt;ref&gt;Ulnar Collateral Ligament Reconstruction Surgery Cost. http://www.surgerycosts.net/price.php?medical=ulnar-collateral-ligament-reconstruction-surgery.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5184">The ‘’’Volcano Disaster Assistance Program’’’ (VDAP) was developed by the [[U.S. Geological Survey]] and [[U.S. Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance]] after the eruption of [[Nevado del Ruiz]] (Colombia) in 1985&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Geological Survey Fact Sheet 2017–3071, 6 p., https://doi.org/10.3133/fs20173071.&lt;/ref&gt;. The volcanic eruption melted a [[glacier]] triggering a [[lahar]] that killed 25,000 people. It was determined that increased monitoring and enhanced communications between scientists and civil authorities would make evacuating local populations much easier, saving lives. Today the program responds to volcanic crises around the world. The aim of the program is to assist in saving lives and property, to reduce economic losses, and to prevent a natural hazard becoming a natural disaster. VDAP staff members are based at the USGS [[Cascades Volcano Observatory]], in Vancouver, Washington. VDAP channels its energy into four main activities; response to natural disaster, capacity building, training and volcanological research.&lt;ref name="Tilling"&gt;Tilling, R.I. (2010), Volcanic hazards and their mitigation: Progress and problems,Reviews of geophysics, 27,2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response==
VDAP responds primarily to ‘non-domestic’ eruptions outside the United States.  Since 1986, the team has responded to over 70 major events around the world.  Scores of other  remote responses involve consultations with the relevant local observatories.  A subset of foreign responses are listed in the following table and on the map.

|[[Mount Pinatubo]], Philippines||1991||Less than 5 years after its creation, VDAP was called to assist an eruption of Pinatubo in April 1991. The volcano is monitored by the Volcano Disaster Assistance Program's crisis-response team. Around 75,000 people and US$250 million to $375 million worth of equipment were evacuated before the major eruption.

|[[Mount Merapi|Merapi]], Indonesia||2006||Eruptions at Merapi affect more than a million people. A small team travelled out in 2006 to improve seismic monitoring and provide more remote sensing data.&lt;ref name="VDAP Merapi"&gt;[http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/vdap/activities/responses/merapi.php VDAP Responses at Merapi in Indonesia]&lt;/ref&gt;

|[[Chaitén]], Chile||2008||A small team helped to install real-time seismic monitoring to help scientists more closely watch the volcano and understand its activity.&lt;ref name="Volcano watch"&gt;[http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/volcanowatch/archive/2008/08_07_03.htmlSurprise eruption in Chile sparks interest in National Volcano Early Warning System]&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|[[Mount Merapi|Merapi]], Indonesia
|2010
|VDAP worked with the Indonesian Center for Volcanology and Geologic Hazard Mitigation (CVGHM)  to use satellite data to analyze activity at the volcano, helping to save thousands of lives with preemptive evacuations.

==Preparation and Monitoring==

Capacity building involves the development of education and [[Deformation monitoring|monitoring]] in hazardous areas. The small group of scientists involved in the program work on eruption forecasting and assessing the hazards in volcanically active areas. This is usually carried out when there is not a crisis to work on.
This kind of work has been carried out in Central and South America since 1998, Papua New Guinea (1998-2000) and Indonesia since 2004.

==Training==

VDAP holds workshops and training courses around the world. Many of these involve remote sensing and [[Geographic information system]] (GIS) modelling. VDAP assists as part of CSAV (Center for the Study of Active Volcanism) &lt;ref name="CSAV"&gt;[https://hilo.hawaii.edu/~csav/ CSAV]&lt;/ref&gt; a six-week international  course in Hawaii and Vancouver, WA. The students include geologists, geochemists and geophysicists, who receive training in the science behind volcano monitoring.&lt;ref name="Hazard training"&gt;[http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/vdap/activities/training/index.php VDAP Training]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

VDAP supports projects which improve the forecasting of eruptions or better characterize the effects of previous eruptions. Examples of this include research at [[Pinatubo]] &lt;ref&gt;https://pubs.usgs.gov/pinatubo/contents.html&lt;/ref&gt;and [[Chaitén]] Volcano, Chile.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.andeangeology.cl/index.php/revista1/issue/view/344&lt;/ref&gt;
