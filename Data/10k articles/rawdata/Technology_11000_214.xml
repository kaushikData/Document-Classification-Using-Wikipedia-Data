'''ACE''' (''ACE - a collaborative editor'') is a platform-independent, [[collaborative real-time editor]]. It is a real-time cooperative editing system that allows multiple geographically dispersed users to view and edit a shared text [[document]] at the same time.

==Introduction==
ACE is a simple [[text editor]] with standard features such as copy/paste and load/save. Multiple documents can be edited at the same time. Furthermore, ACE can share documents with other users on different computers, connected by communication networks ([[LAN]], [[Internet]]). ACE also discovers users and their shared documents automatically in a local area network. Users can opt to join any discovered shared document. For all this, no configuration is necessary because it is based on [[Zero configuration networking|zero-conf networking]].

Once a user has joined a shared document, he can freely edit the document at the same time with all participants as a virtual team. So-called awareness information helps to avoid unnecessary conflicts (that is,  two users editing at the same time and text location). Awareness information includes the cursor and the currently selected text of the other users marked with the color of the respective user.

The heart of the application is a concurrency control algorithm based on the innovative concept of [[operational transformation]], which allows for lock-free editing of a document by multiple users. It imposes no editing constraints and resolves all conflicts automatically. The algorithm overcomes one of the most significant challenges in designing and implementing real-time collaborative editing systems, namely consistency preservation. That is to ensure that at quiescence (that is,  when no messages are in transit) the shared document is identical for all participants.

ACE builds upon open technologies such as [[BEEP]] (RFC 3080) and zero-conf networking. All this leaves the possibility open to communicate even with different applications that understand the public protocol of ACE.

ACE runs on all major operating systems such as [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Mac OS X]], or [[Linux]] and is [[free software]].



==Example use case==
Consider a collaborative editing session with three participants, named Bill, Steve, and Scott, as depicted by the figure. There is also a fourth user, named Sam, who does not participate in the session. The document which the users collaboratively edit is ''Collaboration.txt''. User Scott is the owner and publisher of it. Note that users Steve and Bill work on [[Microsoft Windows]] OS, whereas Scott uses [[Mac OS X]] and Sam [[Linux]] OS. Note that the blue color always denotes the text written by the local user of the ACE instance. The color to matching a participant is depicted in the participants view of the [[GUI]].

==Usage==
Here is a list with a few examples on how ACE can be used:
* Group brainstorming
* Source code development ([[Extreme Programming|XP]])
* Collective note-taking
* Write texts together (e-mails, letters, journals, etc.)
* Educational purposes

The last point reveals some more potential for cooperative editing systems: Groups of two to three students can write essays together. On the one hand, they teach each other how to use the written language, and on the other hand, they can have fun together using a hands-on application on the computer, thus losing fear of contact with the computer, which is essential in today's education.

==Technology background==
A real-time cooperative editing system such as ACE allows multiple users to view and edit the same document at the same time from multiple geographically dispersed sites. The sites are connected by communication networks.
The following requirements have been identified for such systems:
* ''[[Real-time computing|Real-time]]'': The response to local user actions must be quick, ideally as quick as a single user editor, and the [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] for reflecting remote user actions is low (determined by external communication latency only).
* ''Distributed'': Cooperating users may reside on different machines connected by communication networks with nondeterministic latency.
* ''Unconstrained'': Multiple users are allowed to concurrently and independently edit any part of the document at any time, in order to facilitate free and natural information flow among multiple users.

A real-time cooperative editing system consists of ''n'' instances, each instance run by a different user. All instances are connected by a network. One of the most significant challenges in designing and implementing real-time cooperative editing systems is consistency maintenance among the different document replicas (one for each site). A cooperative editing system is said to be consistent if it always maintains the following properties:
* ''[[Wikt:convergence|Convergence]]'': Guarantees when the same set of operations (for example, an operation can be an insert/delete of a character) have been executed at all sites, that all copies (also known as replicas) of the shared document are identical. That is, this property ensures the consistency of the final results at the end of a cooperative editing session.
* ''Causality-preservation'': For any pair of operations ''Oa'' and ''Ob'', if ''Oa'' -&gt; ''Ob'' (that is,  ''Ob'' is dependent on ''Oa''), then ''Oa'' is executed before ''Ob'' at all sites.  That is, this property ensures the consistency of the execution orders at all sites of dependent operations during a cooperative editing session.
* ''Intention-preservation'': For any operation ''O'', the effects of executing ''O'' at all sites are the same as the intention of ''O'', and the effect of executing ''O'' does not change the effects of independent operations. That is, this property ensures that executing an operation at remote sites achieves the same effect as executing this operation at the local site at the time of its generation, and the execution effects of independent operations do not interfere with each other.

One solution to achieve consistency control is provided by [[operational transformation|''Operational Transformation'']] (OT) algorithms. The OT algorithm approach consists of two main components:
* The ''integration algorithm'' which is responsible of receiving, broadcasting and executing operations. It is independent of the type of document replica and application.
* The ''transformation function'' is responsible for merging two concurrent operations. It is application dependent. For example, a text editor has different operations than a whiteboard application.

The theory on consistency maintenance stems from the research field called ''[[Computer Supported Cooperative Work]]'', for short ''[[CSCW]]''.

[[File:Alb-Leisa Späths Alblinse I.JPG|thumb|500 g package]]

The term '''Alb-Leisa''' firstly means the ''Öko-Erzeugergemeinschaft Alb-Leisa'' (engl. "Eco-producer association Alb-Leisa"), secondly a trade name and thirdly traditional varieties of lentils from the [[Swabian Jura]]. "Leisa" means lentils in [[Swabian German|Swabian]]. 

The Alb-Leisa was included in the [[Ark of Taste]] at Slow Food Deutschland in 2012. There are currently 70 small farms in this group. The marketing of Alb-Leise is done by ''Lauteracher Alb-Feld-Früchte'', formerly known as ''Biohof Mammel''. Especially in the region [[Baden-Württemberg]] and [[Bavaria]], but also via webshops.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.slowfood.de/biokulturelle_vielfalt/die_arche_passagiere/alblinse/ Slow Food Deutschland, Arche-Passagiere: Alb-Leisa]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Until the 1950s, the Swabian Jura and its surroundings were the centre of lentil cultivation in [[Germany]]. After that there was no lentil cultivation in this region anymore, it had become uneconomical. In 1985 the Biohof Mammel in [[Lauterach]] started again with the cultivation of lentils. Demand rose slowly. From 2001 onwards, other organic farms were also interested in lentil cultivation. That is why the ''Öko-Erzeugergemeinschaft Alb-Leisa'' (Eco-producer association Alb-Leisa) was founded.

=== Renaissance of the Swabian lentil varieties ===

The traditional Swabian lentil varieties have been disappeared completely in 1985. There was no seed available at all. For this reason, the organic farm Mammel and later the producer's association cultivated the French ''Puy lentil''. In 2006, in the gene bank of the Wawilow Institute in [[St. Petersburg]] the classic Swabian lentil varieties have been accidentally discovered and brought back to Germany. Since then they have been grown again on the Swabian Jura.&lt;ref&gt;Kraut, Eva; Genotypenscreening der historischen Alblinsen und ihre agronomische Eignung unter heutigen Anbaubedingungen, 2008, p. 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

At present, three genotypes of these lentils are used in the Swabian Jura, which are protected by the producers' association under the name of Alb-Leisa. These are the classic Swabian varieties of lentils of the breeder Fritz Späth from [[Haigerloch]]: "Späths Alb-Leisa small", "Späths Alb-Leisa large" and "Späths Heller-Leisa".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bioland.de/im-fokus/hintergrund/detail/article/ein-schwaebisch-russisches-linsen-maerchen.html Regionales aus St. Petersburg: Ein schwäbisch-russisches Linsen-Märchen] &lt;/ref&gt;

A '''bend stiffener''' is a type of [[cable protection system]]. They are conically shaped polyurethane mouldings designed to add local stiffness to a riser, flowline, cable or [[Umbilical cable|umbilical]]. They limit the bending stresses and curvature to acceptable levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url        = http://www.abcosubsea.com/umbilical-management2/bend-stiffener.html
 |title      = Bend Stiffeners

 |accessdate = May 9, 2013
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
They are used in the [[oil and gas industry]] as part of [[Offshore drilling|offshore deep sea drilling]] operations.

Her inventions include a bobbin-free sewing machine and a vacuum ice cream freezer. Though she was awarded around 49 patents over her lifetime, she had around 110 inventions total.&lt;ref name="mit"/&gt;

==Early life and education==

She was born in North Carolina,&lt;ref&gt;Entry for Walter R. Henry, ''1910 U.S. Census'', Charlotte, North Carolina&lt;/ref&gt; the daughter of Walter R. and Beulah Henry. She was the granddaughter of former North Carolina Governor [[W. W. Holden]] and a direct descendant of [[Patrick Henry]]. From 1909 to 1912 she attended North Carolina Presbyterian College and [[Elizabeth College, Virginia|Elizabeth College]] in Charlotte, North Carolina, where she submitted her first patents.&lt;ref name="mothers"/&gt;

==Career as inventor - New York City==

She moved to New York City by 1924, where she founded two companies. She worked as an inventor for the Nicholas Machine Works from 1939 to 1955. She also served as a consultant for many companies that manufactured her inventions, including the [[Mergenthaler Linotype Company]] and the International Doll Company. She lived in New York hotels, belonged to a variety of scientific societies, and never married.&lt;ref name="mothers"/&gt;

A '''Blue Ribbon Commission on America’s Nuclear Future''' was appointed by President Obama to look into future options for existing and future [[High-level radioactive waste management|nuclear waste]], following the ending of work on the incomplete [[Yucca Mountain Repository]]. At present there are 70 nuclear power plant sites where 65,000 tons of [[spent fuel]] is stored in the USA. Each year, more than 2,000 tons are added to this total.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blue-ribbon-commission-on-americas-nuclear-future-issues-final-report-to-secretary-of-energy-138140713.html Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future Issues], Final Report to Secretary of Energy, Jan 26, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;''[http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2013/04/f0/brc_finalreport_jan2012.pdf Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future: Executive Summary]'', January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nine states have "explicit moratoria on new nuclear power until a storage solution emerges".&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=presidential-commission-seeks-volunteers-to-store-nuclear-waste |title=Presidential Commission Seeks Volunteers to Store U.S. Nuclear Waste |author=David Biello |date=July 29, 2011 |work=Scientific American }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bluerib/&gt; A [[deep geological repository]] seems to be the favored approach to storing nuclear waste.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

On January 26, 2012, the Commission submitted its final report to Energy Secretary [[Steven Chu]].&lt;ref name="brc.gov"&gt;http://www.brc.gov&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission put forth seven recommendations for developing a comprehensive strategy to pursue. A major recommendation was that "the United States should undertake an integrated nuclear waste management program that leads to the timely development of one or more permanent deep geological facilities for the safe disposal of spent fuel and high-level nuclear waste".&lt;ref name="Blue Ribbon Commission on America’s Nuclear Future"/&gt;

==Background==
In the United States, a '''blue-ribbon panel''' (or '''blue ribbon commission''') is a group of exceptional people appointed to investigate or study or analyze a given issue. Blue-ribbon panels generally have a degree of independence from political influence or other authority, and such panels usually have no direct authority of their own. Their value comes from their ability to use their expertise to issue findings or recommendations which can then be used by those with decision-making power to act.

At present there are 70 nuclear power plant sites where 65,000 tons of [[spent fuel]] is stored in the USA. Each year, more than 2,000 tons are added to this total.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; US [[High-level radioactive waste management|nuclear waste management policy]] completely broke down with the ending of work on the incomplete [[Yucca Mountain Repository]].&lt;ref name = "auto2"/&gt;  Without a long-term solution to store nuclear waste, a [[Nuclear renaissance in the United States|nuclear renaissance in the U.S.]] remains unlikely. Nine states have "explicit moratoria on new nuclear power until a storage solution emerges".&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=bluerib/&gt;

In a Presidential Memorandum dated January 29, 2010, President Obama established the Blue Ribbon Commission on America’s Nuclear Future (the Commission).&lt;ref name="About the Commission"&gt;{{cite web |title=About the Commission |url= http://www.brc.gov/index.php?q=page/about-commission }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission, composed of fifteen members, conducted an extensive two-year study of nuclear waste disposal, what is referred to as the "back end" of the nuclear energy process.&lt;ref name="About the Commission"/&gt;  The Commission established three subcommittees: Reactor and Fuel Cycle Technology, Transportation and Storage, and Disposal.&lt;ref name="About the Commission"/&gt;

During their research the Commission visited Finland, France, Japan, Russia, Sweden, and the UK, and in 2012, the Commission submitted its final report.&lt;ref name="brc.gov"/&gt; The Commission did not issue recommendations for a specific site but rather presented a comprehensive recommendation for disposal strategies.&lt;ref name="Blue Ribbon Commission on America’s Nuclear Future"&gt;{{cite web |title= Disposal Subcommittee Report to the Full Commission |author= Blue Ribbon Commission on America’s Nuclear Future |url= http://www.brc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/disposal_report_updated_final.pdf |accessdate= 1 January 2016 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120601181726/http://brc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/disposal_report_updated_final.pdf# |archive-date= 2012-06-01 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some nuclear power advocates argue that the United States should develop factories and reactors that will recycle some spent fuel. However, the Obama administration has disallowed [[Nuclear reprocessing|reprocessing]] of nuclear waste, citing [[nuclear proliferation]] concerns.&lt;ref name="nature.com"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v460/n7252/full/460152b.html |title=Adieu to nuclear recycling |author= |date=8 July 2009 |work=Nature |volume=460 |doi=10.1038/460152b |page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Blue Ribbon Commission said that "no existing technology was adequate for that purpose, given cost considerations and the risk of [[nuclear proliferation]]".&lt;ref name=bluerib&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/27/science/earth/nuclear-waste-panel-urges-consent-based-approach.html?ref=atomicenergy |title=Revamped Search Urged for a Nuclear Waste Site |author=Matthew Wald |date=January 26, 2012  |work=New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[deep geological repository]] seems to be favored.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

==Final report==
On January 26, 2012, the Commission submitted its final report to Energy Secretary Steven Chu.&lt;ref name="brc.gov"/&gt; In their final report the Commission put forth several recommendations for developing a comprehensive strategy to pursue. A major recommendation was that "the United States should undertake an integrated nuclear waste management program that leads to the timely development of one or more permanent deep geological facilities for the safe disposal of spent fuel and high-level nuclear waste".&lt;ref name="Blue Ribbon Commission on America’s Nuclear Future"/&gt; There is an "international consensus on the advisability of storing nuclear waste in deep underground repositories",&lt;ref name=go/&gt; but no country in the world has yet opened such a site.&lt;ref name=go&gt;Al Gore (2009).

In their final report the Commission put forth seven recommendations for developing a comprehensive strategy to pursue:&lt;ref name="Blue Ribbon Commission on America’s Nuclear Future"/&gt;

; Recommendation #1: The United States should undertake an integrated nuclear waste management program that leads to the timely development of one or more permanent deep geological facilities for the safe disposal of spent fuel and high-level nuclear waste.&lt;ref name="Blue Ribbon Commission on America’s Nuclear Future"/&gt;

; Recommendation #2: A new, single-purpose organization is needed to develop and implement a focused, integrated program for the transportation, storage, and disposal of nuclear waste in the United States.&lt;ref name="Blue Ribbon Commission on America’s Nuclear Future"/&gt;

; Recommendation #3: Assured access to the balance in the Nuclear Waste Fund (NWF) and to the revenues generated by annual nuclear waste fee payments from utility ratepayers is absolutely essential and must be provided to the new nuclear waste management organization.&lt;ref name="Blue Ribbon Commission on America’s Nuclear Future"/&gt;

; Recommendation #4: A new approach is needed to site and develop nuclear waste facilities in the United States in the future. We believe that these processes are most likely to succeed if they are:
* Adaptive—in the sense that process itself is flexible and produces decisions that are responsive to new information and new technical, social, or political developments.
* Staged—in the sense that key decisions are revisited and modified as necessary along the way rather than being pre-determined in advance.
* Consent-based—in the sense that affected communities have an opportunity to decide whether to accept facility siting decisions and retain significant local control.
* Transparent—in the sense that all stakeholders have an opportunity to understand key decisions and engage in the process in a meaningful way.
* Standards- and science-based—in the sense that the public can have confidence that all facilities meet rigorous, objective, and consistently-applied standards of safety and environmental protection.
* Governed by partnership arrangements or legally-enforceable agreements with host states, tribes and local communities.&lt;ref name="Blue Ribbon Commission on America’s Nuclear Future"/&gt;

; Recommendation #5: The current division of regulatory responsibilities for long-term repository performance between the NRC and the EPA is appropriate and should continue. The two agencies should develop new, site-independent safety standards in a formally coordinated joint process that actively engages and solicits input from all the relevant constituencies.&lt;ref name="Blue Ribbon Commission on America’s Nuclear Future"/&gt;

; Recommendation #6: The roles, responsibilities, and authorities of local, state, and tribal governments (with respect to facility siting and other aspects of nuclear waste disposal) must be an element of the negotiation between the federal government and the other affected units of government in establishing a disposal facility. In addition to legally-binding agreements, as discussed in Recommendation #4, all affected levels of government (local, state, tribal, etc.) must have, at a minimum, a meaningful consultative role in all other important decisions. Additionally, states and tribes should retain—or where appropriate, be delegated—direct authority over aspects of regulation, permitting, and operations where oversight below the federal level can be exercised effectively and in a way that is helpful in protecting the interests and gaining the confidence of affected communities and citizens.&lt;ref name="Blue Ribbon Commission on America’s Nuclear Future"/&gt;

; Recommendation #7: The Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board (NWTRB) should be retained as a valuable source of independent technical advice and review.'' &lt;ref name="Blue Ribbon Commission on America’s Nuclear Future"/&gt;

==Membership==
Co-chairmen of the Commission were [[Lee H. Hamilton]] and [[Brent Scowcroft]], and members of the Commission included, [[Vicky Bailey]], [[Albert Carnesale]], [[Pete Domenici]], [[Susan Eisenhower]], [[Chuck Hagel]], [[Jonathan Lash]], [[Allison M.

A '''broom''' is a [[cleaning tool]] consisting of usually stiff fibers (often made of materials such as plastic, hair, or corn husks) attached to, and roughly parallel to, a [[cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]] [[handle (grip)|handle]], the '''broomstick'''. It is thus a variety of [[brush]] with a long handle. It is commonly used in combination with a [[dustpan]].

A distinction is made between a "hard broom" and a "soft broom". Soft brooms are for sweeping walls of cobwebs and [[spiders]]. Hard brooms are for sweeping dirt off sidewalks.

== Etymology ==
The word "broom" derives from the name of certain thorny [[broom (shrub)|shrubs]] (''[[Genista]]'' and others) used for sweeping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Shorter Oxford English dictionary, 6th ed.|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=United Kingdom|isbn=0199206872|pages=3804}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the shrubs began to be used for the household implement in [[Late Middle English]] and gradually replaced the earlier ''[[besom]]'' during the [[Early Modern English]] period. The song ''[[Broom Buzzems|Buy Broom Buzzems]]'' (by [[William Purvis (Blind Willie)|William Purvis]] 1752–1832) still refers to the "broom besom" as one type of [[besom]] (i.e. "a besom made from broom").

Flat brooms, made of [[Sorghum bicolor|broom corn]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=How to make a broom | url=http://www.motherearthnews.com/Do-It-Yourself/How-To-Make-A-Broom.aspx | publisher=Ogden Publications, Inc. | accessdate=2010-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; were invented by [[Shakers]] in the 19th century with the invention of the [[Shaker broom vice|broom vice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Broom |url=http://www.enotes.com/how-products-encyclopedia/broom |accessdate=2008-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A smaller whisk broom or brush is sometimes called a duster.

== Manufacture ==
{{see also|Shaker broom vise}}
[[File:Besenbinder.JPG|thumb|upright|Making brooms, 2012]]
In 1797, the quality of brooms changed when Levi Dickenson, a farmer in [[Hadley, Massachusetts]], made a broom for his wife, using the tassels of [[sorghum]], a grain he was growing for the seeds. His wife spread good words around town, creating demand for Dickenson's sorghum brooms. The sorghum brooms held up well, but ultimately, like all brooms, fell apart. Dickenson subsequently invented a machine that would make better brooms, and faster than he could. In 1810, the foot treadle broom machine was invented. This machine played an integral part in the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = History of Early American Brooms and Broom Making - BroomShop.com|url = http://broomshop.com/history/|website = broomshop.com|accessdate = 2015-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
One source mentions that the United States had 303 broom factories by 1839 and that the number peaked at 1,039 in 1919. Most of these were in the [[Eastern United States]]; during the [[Great Depression]] in the 1930s, the number of factories declined to 320 in 1939.&lt;ref name="EOHC-Broom"&gt;{{cite web|last=Fugate|first= Tally D. |title=Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History &amp; Culture|work= Broom Factories|accessdate=August 13, 2012|url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/B/BR024.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state of [[Oklahoma]] became a major center for broom production because broom corn grew especially well there, with The Oklahoma Broom Corn Company opening a factory in [[El Reno, Oklahoma|El Reno]] in 1906. Faced with competition from imported brooms and synthetic bristles, most of the factories closed by the 1960s.&lt;ref name="EOHC-Broom" /&gt;

== Magic ==
[[File:Goya - Caprichos (68).jpg|thumb|left|[[Francisco Goya]]'s ''[[Los Caprichos]]'': ''¡Linda maestra!'' ("The Follies: Beautiful Teacher!")&amp;nbsp;– witches heading to a [[Witches' Sabbath|Sabbath]] on a broomstick]]

In the context of [[witchcraft]], ''broomstick'' is likely to refer to the broom as a whole, known as a '''[[besom]]'''. The first known reference to [[witch]]es flying on broomsticks dates to 1453, confessed by the male witch [[Guillaume Edelin]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Man, Myth &amp; Magic (encyclopedia)|Man, Myth and Magic]]: An Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Supernatural''. 1970, edited by Richard Cavendish.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of a [[flying ointment]] used by witches appears at about the same time, recorded in 1456.

In [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]'s 1939 film, ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', the [[Wicked Witch of the West]] used a broomstick to fly over [[Land of Oz|Oz]]. She also used it to skywrite "[[Surrender Dorothy]]" above the [[Emerald City]]. [[Wizard of Oz (character)|The Wizard]] commands [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]] and her three traveling companions to bring the Wicked Witch's broomstick to him in order to grant their wishes.

In [[Disney]]'s 1940 film ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'', [[Mickey Mouse]], playing [[The Sorcerer's Apprentice]], brings a broom to life to do his chore of filling a well full of water. The broom overdoes its job and when chopped into pieces, each splinter becomes a new broom that flood the room until [[Yen Sid]] stops them. This story comes from a poem by [[Goethe]] called ''Der Zauberlehrling'' ("The Sorcerer's Apprentice"). The Disney brooms have had recurring cameos in Disney media, mostly portrayed as janitors, albeit not out of control or causing chaos such as in the original appearance.

This flight was also in ''[[Bedknobs and Broomsticks]]'' as well as ''[[Hocus Pocus (1993 film)|Hocus Pocus]]''.

In [[Swaziland|eSwatini]], witches' broomsticks are short bundles of sticks tied together without a handle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Spooner|first1=Samantha|title=From hippie bans to broomstick flying limits, here are Africa's most absurd laws|url=http://mgafrica.com/article/2014-10-14-from-sex-toy-bans-to-broomstick-flying-limits-presenting-africas-absurd-laws|work=[[Mail &amp; Guardian|Mail &amp; Guardian Africa]]|date=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flying brooms play an important role in the fantasy world of [[Harry Potter]], used for transportation as well as for playing the popular airborne game of [[Quidditch]]. Flying brooms, along with [[Flying carpets]], are the main means of transportation in the world of [[Poul Anderson]]'s

* "[[Jumping the broom]]" is an [[African-American]] wedding tradition that originated in marriages of [[slavery in the United States|slaves in the United States]] in the 19th century. Its revived popularity among African Americans is due to the 1976 novel ''[[Roots: The Saga of an American Family]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Dundes, A.

* During [[World War II]], American submarine crews would hoist a broom onto their boat's fore-truck when returning to port to indicate that they had "swept" the seas clean of enemy shipping.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victortradingco.com/BroomLore.html Broom Lore] - Victoria Trading Company - Retrieved 25 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition has been devalued in recent years by submarine crews who fly a broom simply when returning from their boat's shake-down cruise. This tradition no doubt stems from the action of the Dutch admiral [[Maarten Tromp]] who tied a broom to his main mast after defeating the British admiral [[Robert Blake (admiral)|Robert Blake]] at the [[Battle of Dungeness]] in 1652. This has often been interpreted as a message that he would "sweep the British from the seas". This story remains unsubstantiated,&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Companion to Ships and the Sea. 1988, edited by Peter Kemp&lt;/ref&gt; but may have its origin in the tradition of hoisting a broom as a sign that a ship was for sale, which seems more likely as Tromp had captured two of Blake's ships in the battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/battles_dungeness.html|title=Battle of Dungeness, 30 November 1652|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Literature ===
* In 1701 [[Jonathan Swift]] wrote a "[[Meditation Upon a Broomstick]]", a parody of [[Robert Boyle]]'s ''Occasional Reflections upon Several Subjects'':

* Poets use the broom in metaphor-making. In [[Emily Dickinson]]'s poem ''Mother Nature'', Nature "... sweeps with many colored brooms, and leaves the shreds behind ..."
*In [[J.K. Rowling]]'s ''[[Harry Potter]]'' novels and [[Harry Potter (film series)|film adaptations]], broomsticks are a common form of transport for wizards and witches in [[United Kingdom|Britain]].

=== Religion ===
* In the [[Gospel of Luke]] 15:8 ("[[Parable of the Lost Coin|The Parable of the Lost Coin]]"), sweeping is mentioned, using a verb related to the word for a broom: "Suppose a woman has ten silver coins and loses one. Does she not light a lamp, sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it?"
* "I will sweep it with the besom of destruction" Isaiah 14:23
* In [[Jainism]], monks and nuns have a little broom with them, in order to gently brush aside ants and small animals, to avoid crushing them. This is part of observing the principle of ''[[Ahimsa in Jainism|Ahiṃsā]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beliefnet.com/Faiths/Jainism/index.aspx|title=Jainism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sports ===
* [[Curling broom]]
* In [[baseball]], when the [[home team]] is close to accomplishing a sweep (having won the first two games of a three-game series or first three games of a four-game series), some fans will bring brooms to the ballpark and brandish them as a way of taunting the visiting team (examples: Arkansas vs. LSU, 2011; Red Sox vs. Yankees, May 13–15, 2011 and June 7–9, 2011).
* In [[broomball]], broomsticks have their heads removed and are used to push a ball into a goal, on an ice surface. The game is similar to hockey, except players do not wear skates.

A '''cable protection system''' ('''CPS''') protects [[Submarine power cable|subsea power cables]] against various factors that negatively impact on the cable lifetime, normally used when entering an [[Offshore construction|offshore structure]].  When a subsea power cable is laid, there is an area where the cable can be subjected to increased dynamic forces, which the cable is not necessarily designed to survive over the lifetime of the installation.

Cable protection systems are used to allow the specification, and thus cost, of a subsea power cable to be reduced, by removing the need to include additional armoring of the cable.  The resulting cables can be produced more cheaply, whilst still prividing the 20 years + lifetime required.

[[Offshore windfarm]] developers in particular have adopted the use of Cable protection systems due to the dynamic area where the cable comes from the [[seabed]] and enters the [[monopile]]/J-tube. This is in part due to the potential for localised [[Bridge scour|scouring]] to occur near the structure.

A CPS generally consists of three sections, a Centraliser or Monopile interface, a protection system for the dynamic area, and a protection system for the static area.

The installation of J-Tubes for offshore renewable monopiles was viewed as a costly approach, and a 'latching' type of cable protection system which penetrates the outer wall of the monopile, via a specifically designed angled aperture enables the simplification of monopile design, and removes the need for additional works post pile driving which usually involved the use of divers. This approach is becoming the industry standard in monopile design, assisting developers to reduce their costs for construction.

== History ==
Articulated half-pipe Cable protections systems have traditionally been used for the protection of cables at shore landings, and other areas where cable damage could be envisaged, and burial was not practical. Patents for variations of articulated pipe cable protections date back to 1929. The system was described as a cable armor shield 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"adapted to protect the cable from damage and wear occasioned by rubbing on rocks, contacting with ships, anchors or other objects, and has for its object to provide a practical flexible armor shield of this class which can be readily applied to the cable at any point along its length."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Cable shield - US1822624 A|date=September 8, 1931|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US1822624|last=O|first=Hoeftmann Alexander (inventor)|website=Google patents|accessdate=2017-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From their outset cable protection systems were designed to be simple, effective, and easy to assemble. The systems consisted of a series of half shells which had a convex flange at one end and a larger socket flange at the other allowing the sections to form a flexible universal joint connection between them. Due to the intended use of heavy [[Cast metal|cast]] or [[Forging|forged]] metals they also had the added advantage of increasing the weight of the cable being installed, thus reducing movement on the seabed.

Over the years innovations have occurred improving the articulation of the joints with modern articulated pipes being more akin to [[Ball and socket joint|ball-joints]], and some manufacturers providing 'boltless' articulated pipes, thus saving assembly time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vos-prodect.com|title=Vos Prodect|last=|first=|date=|website=www.vos-prodect.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cpnl.eu|title=CPNL Engineering {{!}} cable protection solutions|website=CPNL Engineering {{!}} cable protection solutions|access-date=2017-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.protectorshell.com|title=Protectorshell Articulated / Split pipe|website=www.protectorshell.com|access-date=2017-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes in the [[metallurgy]] have also happened, leading to most half shell articulated pipe now being made from [[ductile iron]], due to its improved strength and elasticity characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ductile.org/didata/Section3/3part1.htm|title=Ductile Iron Data - Section 3 - Part 1|website=www.ductile.org|access-date=2017-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today these articulated pipes are also utilised for their bend restriction properties, allowing them to be utilised as bend restrictors for the protected cable.

== Design considerations ==
Cable protection systems are predominantly designed to protect the system from damage throughout the lifetime of the cable caused by [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]], overbending of the cable, and to provide protection of the cable until it reaches an area of burial.

=== Design life ===
The cable protection system will be designed to provide protection for a specific lifetime, the 'design life' of the system, which may vary dependent upon the conditions encountered.

=== Overbending of cable ===
Overbending of the cable occurs when the cable is bent in a radius of less than the minimum bending radius defined by the manufacturer. Although the cable may initially survive the overbending, this can lead to subsequent fatigue within the cable ultimately leading to cable failure.  The CPS selected should maintain a radius which is greater than the specified minimum bend radius.

=== Fatigue of CPS/cable within ===
Subsea cable protection systems can encounter wear due to movement, and general changes in composition due to being submerged for a prolongued period of time, such as [[corrosion]] or changes in [[polymer]] based compounds. Consideration should be given to the induced effects on the CPS resulting from the dynamic elements in the environment.  Simple changes such as changes in temperature, current or [[salinity]] can result in changes in the ability of the CPS to offer protection for the life of the cable. It is advisable to carefully assess the potential effects of movement of the CPS, relating to the dynamic abilities of the cable. The CPS may withstand the worst conditions seen over a 100yr period, but would the cable inside the CPS survive these movements.  In some instances, such as shore ends for fibre optic cables where rocky outcrops are present, dynamic influences can be reduced by securing the articulated pipe to the seabed rock, thus reducing the degree of movement remaining.

Some manufacturers have performed independent empirical testing to provide a simulated 25yr life cycle of the dynamic forces applicable to their product in order to provide customers with improved confidence in the survivability of the system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Another cause for failure of subsea power cables is caused by overheating, which can occur where a cable is contained within a CPS without adequate ability to dissipate the heat produced by the cable. These lead to early fatigue of the cable insulation, necessitating the replacement of the cable.

Subsea cable incidents account for around 77% of the total global cost of wind farm losses. Since 2007 this percentage, which has varied between 70% and 80%, is statistically reported year after year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Seabed stability ===
Seabed stability is an important factor associated with cable protection systems. Should the cable protection system be too [[Buoyancy|buoyant]], it is less likely to remain in contact with the seabed, thus the CPS is more likely to require additional remedial stability measures, such as installation of concrete mattresses, rockbags, or rockdumping.

=== Suspension strength ===
When a CPS is being installed to interface with a monopile structure, there is likely to be seabed scouring to some degree. Should the scouring become excessive, the CPS may be suspended within a scour hole, and needs to be capable of supporting its own weight, and that of the cable within.  Failure to sustain this loading scenario will lead to failure of the CPS, which will in turn allow the forces to act upon the cable within, ultimately leading to cable damage.

=== Installation ===
Within the [[renewables]] market in particular, installation of CPS's are preferred to be completely diverless, as this reduces the developers cost, and removes risk to human life through diving in a hazardous area.

=== Removal/Reinstallation ===
A final consideration for CPS is that of removal of the cable should a failure occur.  Some designs require diver intervention to recover the cable with the CPS. Due consideration should also be given to the removal of a CPS should the CPS itself fail.  The costs associated with CPS replacement during the operational lifetime of an offshore wind farm are not insignificant, as the cable will most likely require repair/replacement as part of the process.

}}
Various innovative systems have been developed to provide restriction of bending, including ductile iron articulated pipe, and polymer or metal based vertebrae systems. Vertebrae bend restrictors are available in both metal and polymer based forms. Some cable protection systems include a polymer based vertebrae system which restricts the bend radius to a maximum of a few degrees per segment.  These systems are lighter than their metal equivalents and often cheaper to produce but must be carefully assessed for longevity in the proposed application.  Due to the use of polymers these systems tend to be of a larger diameter than their metal counterparts, which presents a larger surface area for drag induced forces caused by currents.

== Bend stiffeners ==
{{main|Bend stiffener}}
Bend stiffeners are conically shaped polymer mouldings designed to add local stiffness to the product contained within, limiting bending stresses and curvature to acceptable levels. Bend stiffeners are generally suitable for water depths of 35 metres or less, and their suitability is highly dependent on currents and seabed conditions at site. Extreme care must be taken when selecting a stiffener, especially relating to the lifespan of the system as these themselves can become fatigued/fragile. As the stiffness of these products are dependent upon the nature of the plastic used, careful testing and QA of plastics should be carefully considered as flaws introduced during material manufacture, processing, machining and molding.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Other systems ==
Various other polymer based systems have been developed which provide a flexible 'tube' which can be attached to the structure in advance of the cable being installed, although these are relatively new to the industry, and considered by some as unproven.

=== Applicable Standards ===
Although there are no specific standards for cable protections systems, DNVGL-RP-0360 Subsea power cables in shallow water includes a section on Cable Protection at the interface to a structure (Section 4.7).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8606">The '''Carnegie Commission on Educational Television''' was established in 1965 by the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]] in the [[United States]]. This commission was created to research the role noncommercial [[educational television]] played on society in America. The 15 member commission attempted to carry out this goal by; distinguishing between [[commercial television]], entertainment for large mass audiences: instructional television, in-class educational material, and [[public television]]. Public television was considered anything else that largely helped [[Public affairs (broadcasting)|public affairs]] and was not supported by [[advertising]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Broadcasting PolicyBase |url=http://www.current.org/pbpb/carnegie/carnegieISummary.html |work=Carnegie Commission on Educational Television,  Summary, 1967 |publisher=Current Publishing Committee and National Public Broadcasting Archives |accessdate=28 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810063334/http://www.current.org/pbpb/carnegie/CarnegieISummary.html |archivedate=10 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==
The commission first gained momentum at the First National Conference on Long-Range Financing of Educational Television Stations in December 1964. Although not created until 1965, the commission was first incepted at this [[Academic conference|conference]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Carnegie Commission on Educational Television|url=http://www.lib.umd.edu/NPBA/subinfo/ccet.html|publisher=National Public Broadcasting Archives|accessdate=5 September 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623115539/http://www.lib.umd.edu/NPBA/subinfo/ccet.html|archivedate=23 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Public Television: A Program for Action'' ==
On January 26, 1967, the commission published its most famous and influential report on broadcast history, ''Public Television: A Program for Action''. The reports main rhetoric was persuading America’s institutions (and proposing new institutions) to enhance educational television. Among the final recommendations in the report were; that a Corporation for Public Television be created to receive and disburse funds from the government and other sources, that it support at least two national and many local production agencies, that it seek ways to encourage interconnection of stations, and that sufficient funds, not subject to the annual [[Appropriation (law)|appropriation]] process, be provided through a 2-5% tax on [[television receiver]]s. The recommendations of the report were stated with 12 actions to be carried out by [[United States Congress|Congress]] and the Commission itself, although some of these actions were vague as to whom the primary target was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Broadcasting PolicyBase |url=http://www.current.org/pbpb/carnegie/carnegieISummary.html |work=Carnegie Commission on Educational Television,  Summary, 1967 |publisher=Current Publishing Committee and National Public Broadcasting Archives |accessdate=28 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810063334/http://www.current.org/pbpb/carnegie/CarnegieISummary.html |archivedate=10 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sections ===
The following actions were used by the Commission to persuade U.S. political institutions to enhance educational television, authorize the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and provide said organization with funds, and sponsor further research and studies to improve and advocate educational television. These actions also included steps that the proposed [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]] should carry out to reach their goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Broadcasting PolicyBase |url=http://www.current.org/pbpb/carnegie/carnegieISummary.html |work=Carnegie Commission on Educational Television,  Summary, 1967 |publisher=Current Publishing Committee and National Public Broadcasting Archives |accessdate=28 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810063334/http://www.current.org/pbpb/carnegie/CarnegieISummary.html |archivedate=10 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

#“We recommend concerted efforts at the federal, state, and local levels to improve the facilities and to provide for the adequate support of the individual educational television stations and to increase their number.”
#“We recommend that Congress act promptly to authorize and to establish a federally chartered, [[Non-profit organization|nonprofit]], [[Non-governmental organization|nongovernmental corporation]], to be known as the "Corporation for Public Television." The Corporation should be empowered to receive and disburse governmental and private funds in order to extend and improve Public Television programming. The Commission considers the creation of the Corporation fundamental to its proposal and would be most reluctant to recommend the other parts of its plan unless the corporate entity is brought into being.”
#“We recommend that the Corporation support at least two national production centers, and that it be free to contract with independent producers to prepare Public Television programs for educational [[television station]]s.”
#“We recommend that the Corporation support, by appropriate grants and contracts, the production of Public Television programs by local stations for more-than-local use.”
#“We recommend that the Corporation on appropriate occasions help support local programming by local stations.”
#“We recommend that the Corporation provide the educational television system as expeditiously as possible with facilities for live interconnection by conventional means, and that it be enabled to benefit from advances in technology as domestic communications satellites are brought into being. The Commission further recommends that Congress act to permit the granting of preferential rates for educational television for the use of interconnection facilities, or to permit their free use, to the extent that this may not be possible under existing law.”
#“We recommend that the Corporation encourage and support research and development leading to the improvement of programming and program production.”
#“We recommend that the Corporation support technical experimentation designed to improve the present television technology.”
#“We recommend that the Corporation undertake to provide means by which technical, artistic, and specialized personnel may be recruited and trained.”
#“We recommend that Congress provide the federal funds required by the Corporation through a manufacturer's [[excise tax]] on television sets (beginning at 2 percent and rising to a ceiling of 5 percent). The revenues should be made available to the Corporation through a trust fund.”
#“We recommend new legislation to enable the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to provide adequate facilities for stations now in existence, to assist in increasing the number of stations to achieve nationwide coverage, to help support the basic operations of all stations, and to enlarge the support of instructional television programming.”
#“We recommend that federal, state, local, and private educational agencies sponsor extensive and innovative studies intended to develop better insights into the use of television in formal and informal education."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Broadcasting PolicyBase |url=http://www.current.org/pbpb/carnegie/carnegieISummary.html |work=Carnegie Commission on Educational Television,  Summary, 1967 |publisher=Current Publishing Committee and National Public Broadcasting Archives |accessdate=28 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810063334/http://www.current.org/pbpb/carnegie/CarnegieISummary.html |archivedate=10 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reception ===
''Public Television: A Program for Action'' sold 50,000 copies in just a few days and received wide attention. The report also led to rapid and drastic actions. [[Lyndon B. Johnson|President Johnson]] mentioned public television in his 1967 [[State of the Union address]], and shortly afterwards proposed legislation that was similar to the proposals in the report. In November 1967, the [[Public Broadcasting Act of 1967]] became law and created the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sterling, Kittross|first=Christopher, John|title=Stay Tuned: A Concise History of American Broadcasting|year=1990|publisher=Wadsworth Publishing Company|isbn=0-534-11905-0|pages=389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8637">'''Co-processing''' is the use of [[waste]] as raw material, or as a source of energy, or both to replace natural mineral resources (material recycling) and fossil fuels such as coal, petroleum and gas ([[energy recovery]]) in industrial processes, mainly in energy intensive industries (EII) such as [[cement]], [[Lime mortar|lime]], [[steel]], [[glass]], and [[power generation]]. Waste materials used for Co-processing are referred to as alternative fuels and raw materials (AFR).

==Concept of Co-processing==
Co-processing is a proven [[sustainable development]] concept that reduces demands on natural resources, reduces pollution and landfill space, thus contributing to reducing the [[environmental footprint]]. Co-processing is also based on the principles of [[industrial ecology]], which considers the best features of the flow of information, materials, and energy of biological ecosystems, with the aim of improving the exchange of these essential resources in the industrial world.

[[image:Types of Co-processing.gif]]

Figure 1: Types of Co-processing

In summary, the benefits of Co-processing are:
* to conserve natural (non-renewable) resources of energy and materials,
* to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in order to slow global warming and demonstrate a positive impact on integrated environmental indicators, such as the [[ecological footprint]],
* to reduce the environmental impacts of the extraction (mining or quarrying), transporting, and processing of raw materials,
* to reduce dependence on primary resource markets,
* to save landfill space and reduce the pollution caused by the disposal of waste, and
* to destroy waste completely eliminating potential future liabilities.

Co-processing contributes to the industrial competitiveness, is a complementary technology to concepts such as [[cleaner production]] or [[recycling]] and should be considered as a treatment alternative within an integrated waste management concept. Some EII offer co-processing as a sustainable waste management service. It is usually more cost effective to adapt existing facilities of EII than building new waste treatment capacities thereby reducing waste management cost to society.

The waste management hierarchy (see figure below) shows that Co-processing is a recovery activity which should be considered after waste prevention and recycling; Co-processing ranks higher in this hierarchy in comparison to disposal activities such as landfilling or incineration.

Figure 2: Waste Management Hierarchy

==Potential of Co-processing==

The global industrial demand for energy is roughly 45% of the total demand and the requirements of the energy intensive industries (EII) are more than half of the total industrial demand, at 27%.

Worldwide, wastes suitable for Co-processing have an energy potential equivalent to nearly 20% of the fossil fuel energy used by the EII and coal-fired power plants. By 2030, the thermal substitution rate of waste could rise to nearly 30%. In the [[EU-25]]  countries of Europe, the available energy potential in waste currently represents nearly 40% of this demand, and this is expected to rise to almost 50% by 2030.

The EU cement industry already uses more than 40% fuels derived from waste and biomass in supplying the thermal energy to the grey clinker making process. Although the choice for this so-called alternative fuels (AF) is typically cost driven, other factors are becoming more important. Use of AF provides benefits for both society and the company: CO2-emissions are lower than with fossil fuels, waste can be co-processed in an efficient and sustainable manner and the demand for certain virgin materials can be reduced. Yet there are large differences in the share of AF used between the European Union (EU) member states. Clearly, the societal benefits can be enlarged if more member states increase their AF share. In this study Ecofys assess the barriers and opportunities for further uptake of AF in 14 EU member states. Ecofys found that local factors constrain the market potential to a much larger extent than the technical and economic feasibility of the cement industry itself. In this summary they present the overall findings. The detailed assessments are available in separate cases studies.[https://cembureau.eu/media/1618/full-report-_-2017-05-11_ecofys_publication_alternativefuels_report.pdf Source]

Roughly 60% of the waste that could be used for Co-processing is biomass and therefore [[carbon neutral]]. In this way Co-processing offers a significant potential for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels. Furthermore, diverting industrial waste streams from landfills and incinerators without energy recovery contributes to reducing overall CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions when used to substitute fossil fuels through Co-processing (as illustrated in the figure below).

Other factors that must be considered when Co-processing waste include product quality standards, permitting aspects, and transparent communication in order to gain public acceptance.

==Coprocessing in Pharmaceutical Excipients Development==
Coprocessing is the combination of two or more excipients to form materials (coprocessed excipients) of superior functionality and limited unwanted effects. Co-processing is a tool that is employed by pharmaceutical excipients manufacturers and formulation scientists to develop materials with superior performance. Coprocessing is fundamentally based on particle engineering that allows modification of Critical Material Attributes (CMA) of the primary excipients. These modifications are reflected in the resulting coprocessed material as enhanced functionality. The primary excipients are established pharmacopoeial materials.

'''Colored fire''' is a common pyrotechnic effect used in stage productions, fireworks and by fire performers the world over. Generally, the color of a flame may be red, orange, blue, yellow, or white, and is dominated by [[blackbody radiation]] from soot and steam. When additional chemicals are added to the fuel burning, their [[atomic emission]] spectra can affect the frequencies of visible light radiation emitted - in other words, the flame appears in a different color dependent upon the chemical additives. Flame coloring is also a good way to demonstrate how fire changes when subjected to heat and how they also change the matter around them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140108070918/http://voyager.egglescliffe.org.uk/physics/astronomy/blackbody/bbody.html] &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr162/lect/light/absorption.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-04-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326193215/http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr162/lect/light/absorption.html |archive-date=2014-03-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To color their flames, pyrotechnicians will generally use metal salts. Specific combinations of fuels and co-solvents are required in order to dissolve the necessary chemicals. Color enhancers (usually chlorine donors) are frequently added too, the most common of which is [[polyvinyl chloride]]. A practical use of colored fire is the [[flame test]], where metal cations are tested by placing the sample in a flame and analyzing the color produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chemguide.co.uk/inorganic/group1/flametests.html|title=flame tests|website=Chemguide.co.uk|access-date=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.skylighter.com/fireworks/making-fireworks-projects/chlorine-donor-fireworks-chemicals.asp|title=Pyrotechnic Chemicals - Chlorine Donors|website=Skylighter.com|access-date=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emitted colors depend on the electronic configuration of the elements involved. Heat energy from the flame excites electrons to a higher quantum level, and the atoms emit characteristic colors (photons with energies corresponding to the visible spectrum) as they return to lower energy levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/chemical/flame.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-04-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007091024/http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/chemical/flame.html |archive-date=2014-10-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campfire colorants==
{{main|Pyrotechnic composition}}
Flame colorants are becoming popular while camping. Scouts {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} and other outdoor "enthusiasts" have placed sections of [[copper]] pipe with holes drilled throughout and stuffed with garden hose onto [[campfire]]s to create a variety of flame colors.  An easier method of coloring campfires has been fueled by commercial products.  These packages of flame colorants are tossed onto a campfire or into a [[fireplace]] to produce effects.

Although these chemicals are very effective at imparting their color into an already existing flame, these substances are not [[flammable]] alone. To produce a powder or solid that, when lit, produces a colored flame, the necessary steps are more complex. To get a powder to burn satisfactorily, both a fuel and [[oxidizer]] will mostly be needed. Common oxidizers include.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.campfiredude.com/campfire-magic.shtml|title=Colored Fire Flames|website=Campfiredude.com|access-date=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Barium chlorate]]
* [[Guanine nitrate]]
* [[Potassium nitrate]] (saltpeter)
* [[Potassium chlorate]]
* [[Potassium perchlorate]]
* [[Strontium nitrate]]
* [[Sodium nitrate]]

Many of these oxidizers also produce a colored flame by themselves. Some of them - as well as the main colorants - are severely [[toxic]] and therefore [[environmental damage|environmentally damaging]].

'''Computer magazines''' are about [[computer]]s and related subjects, such as [[computer network|networking]] and the [[Internet]]. Most computer [[magazines]] offer (or offered) advice, some offer programming tutorials, reviews of the latest technologies, and advertisements.

== History ==
{{expand section|date=October 2013}}

=== 1940s-1950s===
[[Mathematics of Computation]] established in 1943, articles about computers began to appear from 1946 (Volume 2, Number 15) to the end of 1954. [[Scientific journal]].

''Digital Computer Newsletter'', 1949-1968, founded by [[Albert Eugene Smith]].

''Computers and Automation'' was published from 1951 to 1978 and is arguably the first computer magazine. It was briefly called ''Roster of Organizations in the Computing Machinery Field'' (1951-1952), and ''The Computing Machinery Field'' (1952-1953)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Computers and People|date=1957|page=111|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KC8-AQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Roster+of+Organizations+in+the+Computing+Machinery+Field%22+1953&amp;dq=%22Roster+of+Organizations+in+the+Computing+Machinery+Field%22+1953&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwie8P_m-KbbAhWGkSwKHe9HAUAQ6AEIKTAA|publisher=Berkeley Enterprises|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was published by [[Edmund Berkeley]]. It held the first Computer Art Contest circa 1963 and maintained a  bibliography on computer art starting in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/bitsavers_computersAndAutomation&amp;tab=about The BITSAVERS.ORG Documents Library: Computers and Automation Journal]&lt;/ref&gt; It also included a monthly estimated census of all installed computer systems starting in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/bitsavers_computersArCensus196274_16451676&lt;/ref&gt;

[[IEEE Transactions on Computers]] from 1952, scientific journal.

[[Journal of the ACM]] from 1954, scientific journal.

[[Datamation]] published in 1957 was another early Computer and Data Processing magazine. It is still being published as an ePublication on the Internet. Futurist [[Donald Prell]] was its founder. 

[[Information and Computation]] from 1957, scientific journal.

[[IBM Journal of Research and Development]] from 1957, scientific journal.

[[Communications of the ACM]] from 1958, mix of [[List of science magazines|science magazine]], [[trade magazine]], and a scientific journal

[[The Computer Journal]] from 1958, scientific journal.

=== 1960s-1970s===
''ACS Newsletter'' 1966-1976, Amateur Computer Society newsletter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Amateur Computer Society Newsletter {{!}} 102654910 {{!}} Computer History Museum |journal=www.computerhistory.org |url=http://www.computerhistory.org/collections/catalog/102654910 |language=en|quote=Claims to be "the first hobby-computer publication in the world."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dr Dobbs Journal]] (1976) is one of the oldest computer magazines still being published, and it was the first to focus on software, rather than hardware.

===1980s ===


1980s computer magazines skewed their content towards the [[hobbyist]] end of the then-[[microcomputer]] market, and used to contain [[type-in program]]s, but these have gone out of fashion. The first magazine devoted to this class of computers was [[Creative Computing]]. [[Byte (magazine)|Byte]] was an influential technical journal that published until the 1990s.

In 1983 an average of one new computer magazine appeared each week.&lt;ref name="berg19840908"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/08/business/the-computer-magazine-glut.html |title=The Computer Magazine Glut |last=Berg |first=Eric N. |date=1984-09-08 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2017-07-03 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; By late that year more than 200 existed. Their numbers and size grew rapidly with the industry they covered, and ''BYTE'' and ''[[80 Micro]]'' were among the three thickest magazines of any kind per issue.&lt;ref name="nyt19831109"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/09/business/boom-in-computer-magazines.html | title=Boom in Computer Magazines | accessdate=2011-02-25 | date=1983-11-09 | work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Compute!]]''{{'}}s editor in chief reported in the December 1983 issue that "all of our previous records are being broken: largest number of pages, largest-number of four-color advertising pages, largest number of printing pages, and the largest number of editorial pages".&lt;ref name="lock198312"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Lock |first=Robert |date=December 1983 |title=Editor's Notes |url=https://archive.org/stream/1983-12-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_043_1983_Dec#page/n7/mode/2up |magazine=Compute! |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Computers were the only industry with product-specific magazines, like ''80 Micro'', ''[[PC Magazine]]'', and ''[[Macworld]]''; their editors vowed to impartially cover their computers whether or not doing so hurt their readers' and advertisers' market, while claiming that their rivals pandered to advertisers by only publishing positive news.&lt;ref name="bartimo19841210"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=si4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA35&amp;pg=PA35#v=onepage&amp;f=false | title=Magazines Woo Users | accessdate=March 14, 2011 | author=Bartimo, Jim | date=1984-12-10 | pages=35–36 | work=InfoWorld}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many magazines ended in 1984, however, as their number exceeded the amount of available advertising revenue despite revenue in the first half of the year five times that of the same period in 1982. Consumers typically bought computer magazines more for advertising than articles, which benefited already leading journals like ''BYTE'' and ''PC Magazine'' and hurt weaker ones. Also affecting magazines was the computer industry's economic difficulties,{{r|berg19840908}} including the [[video game crash of 1983]], which badly hurt the home-computer market. [[Dan Gutman]], the founder of ''Computer Games'', recalled in 1987 that "the computer games industry crashed and burned like a bad night of ''[[Microsoft Flight Simulator|Flight Simulator]]''—with my magazine on the runway".&lt;ref name="gutman198712"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/COMPUTEs_Apple_Applications_Vol._5_No._2_Issue_6_1987-12_COMPUTE_Publications_US#page/n65/mode/2up | title=The Fall And Rise Of Computer Games | work=Compute!'s Apple Applications | date=December 1987 | accessdate=18 August 2014 | author=Gutman, Dan | pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Antic (magazine)|Antic]]''{{'}}s advertising sales declined by 50% in 90 days,&lt;ref name="bisson198605"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1986-05-anticmagazine/Antic_Vol_5-01_1986-05_Fourth_Anniversary_Issue#page/n15/mode/2up/search/raiders | title=Antic Then &amp; Now | work=Antic | date=May 1986 | accessdate=28 January 2015 | author=Bisson, Gigi | pages=16-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Compute!''{{'s}} number of pages declined from 392 in December 1983 to 160 ten months later,&lt;ref name="maher20130728"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.filfre.net/2013/07/a-computer-for-every-home/ | title=A Computer for Every Home? | publisher=The Digital Antiquarian | date=2013-07-28 | accessdate=19 March 2016 | author=Maher, Jimmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Compute!'' and ''[[Compute!'s Gazette]]''{{'}}s publisher assured readers in an editorial that his company "is and continues to be quite successful ... even during these particularly difficult times in the industry".&lt;ref name="lock198601"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Lock |first=Robert C. |date=January 1986 |title=Editor's Notes |url=https://archive.org/stream/1986-01-computegazette/Compute_Gazette_Issue_31_1986_Jan#page/n7/mode/2up |magazine=Compute's Gazette |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' stated in 1988 that it was the only one of the 18 color magazines that covered computer games in 1983 to survive the crash.&lt;ref name="sipe198808"&gt;{{cite news | title=The Greatest Story Ever Told | work=Computer Gaming World | date=August 1988 | author=Sipe, Russell | pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Compute!'' similarly stated that year that it was the only general-interest survivor of about 150 consumer-computing magazines published in 1983.&lt;ref name="mansfield198801"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1988-01-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_092_1988_Jan#page/n7/mode/2up | title=Editor's Notes | work=Compute! | date=January 1988 | accessdate=10 November 2013 | author=Mansfield, Richard | pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some computer magazines in the 1980s and 1990s were issued only on disk (or cassette tape, or CD-ROM) with no printed counterpart; such publications are collectively (though somewhat inaccurately) known as ''[[disk magazine]]s'' and are [[List of disk magazines|listed separately]].

=== 1990s ===
In some ways the heyday of printed computer magazines was a period during the 1990s, in which a large number of computer manufacturers took out [[advertisement]]s in computer magazines, so they became quite thick and could afford to carry quite a number of articles in each issue, ([[Computer Shopper (UK magazine)]] was a good example of this trend). Some printed computer magazines used to include [[floppy disk]]s, [[CD-ROM]]s, or other media as inserts; they typically contained [[software]], [[Demoware|demo]]s, and electronic versions of the print issue.

=== 2000s-2010s ===
However, with the rise in popularity of the [[internet]], many computer magazines went bankrupt or transitioned to an online-only existence. Exceptions include [[Wired magazine]], which is more of a technology magazine than a computer magazine.

On offshore [[oil platform]]s, '''conductor support systems''', also known as conductor supported systems or satellite platforms, are small unmanned installations consisting of little more than a [[well bay]], and a small process plant. They are designed to operate in conjunction with a static [[production platform]] which is connected to the platform by flow lines and/or by [[Umbilical cable]].

Traditionally, these jacket-type  structures have been installed and used in shallow to medium water depths of up to 40 – 60 meters. The conductor supported system use its inherited strength of the well conductors to support both the wells and the topside structure.  

The conductor supported system is particularly suited to areas with more benign environmental conditions, however it is a common development option even in hurricane / cyclone prone areas such as the Gulf of Mexico or Australia's Carnarvon Basin. The well conductors act as both structural, weight-supporting piles and flowlines for the produced fluids from the well. These are drilled and installed with a drilling jackup rig using conventional drilling / lifting techniques.   

A leading proponent of this cost effective style of offshore development was [[Apache Energy]] which commissioned numerous Conductor Supported Wellhead Platforms in the [[Carnarvon Basin]] to feed its so called "String of Pearls" discoveries. 

Notably, in this Basin, the small field designs such as Conductor Supported Platforms and Monopods, often lay in proximity to the massive offshore [[Liquefied natural gas|Liquefied Natural Gas]] fields of the [[North West Shelf Venture|North West Shelf]], [[Gorgon gas project|Gorgon]], [[Wheatstone LNG|Wheatstone]] and Pluto developments.

[[File:Crampon.JPG|thumb|Rigid step-in crampons used for vertical [[ice climbing]]]]
A '''crampon''' is a traction device that is attached to footwear to improve mobility on snow and ice during [[ice climbing]].&lt;ref name=Cox2003&gt;{{cite book|edition=7|editor=Cox, Steven M. |editor2=Kris Fulsaas |title=[[Mountaineering: The Freedom of the Hills]]|publisher=The Mountaineers|isbn=0-89886-828-9|location=Seattle|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides ice climbing, crampons are also used for secure travel on snow and ice, such as crossing [[glacier]]s, [[Snow field|snowfields]] and [[Ice field|icefields]], ascending snow slopes, and scaling ice-covered rock. There are three main attachment systems for footwear: step-in, hybrid, and strap bindings. The first two require boots with [[welt (shoe)|welts]], as a tension lever attaches the crampon to the heel. The last type (strap bindings) are more versatile and can adapt to virtually any boot or shoe, but often do not fit as precisely as the other two types.&lt;ref name=REI2014&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/crampons-snow-ice-climbing.html|title=Crampons: How to Choose|publisher=REI|accessdate=2014-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Oscar Eckenstein]] designed the first 10-point crampon in 1908, dramatically reducing the need for step cutting. This design was then made commercially available by the Italian Henry Grivel.

==Characteristics==
[[File:Strap-on crampon.JPG|thumb|Yellow/grey plastic "anti-balling" plates prevent snow from building up]]
[[File:Aa walking crampons.jpg|thumb|Walking crampons]]
===Materials===
Crampons are made of steel alloy, light weight aluminium, or a combination of the two. Lighter weight crampons are popular for [[ski touring|alpine ski touring]] where demands are generally lower and light weight a premium.

===Points===
Early 10-point crampons lacked forward angled spikes and thus required step cutting on steep terrain. In the 1930s two additional forward-slanting points were added, making them exceptional for [[mountaineering]] and glacier travel and beginning a revolution in [[front pointing]]. There is currently a range of models, including specialized crampons with as many as 14 points and models with single points for ice climbing.

===Attachment===
Crampons are fastened to footwear by means of a binding system.  Improved attachment systems - such as a cam action "step-in" system similar to a ski binding and particularly well adapted to plastic technical mountaineering boots - have widely increased crampon use.  Crampons also use a full "strap-in" system and a "hybrid" binding that features a toe strap at the front and a heel lever at the back.&lt;ref name=cramponsguide&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cramponsguide.co.uk/crampon-attachment|title=Crampon Attachment|publisher=Crampons Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-balling===
To prevent snow from balling up under crampons, especially in temperatures around freezing, most models can be fitted with plastic or rubber "anti-balling" systems to reduce build-up.  Rubber models use flexion to repel snow while plastic anti-balling plates employ a [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] surface to prevent adhesion.

===Grades===
Crampons are graded C1, C2 and C3 relative to their flexibility and general compatibility with different styles of boots.&lt;ref name=H2G2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A1931546|title=The Hike Boot Grading System and the Crampon Grading System|publisher=H2G2}}&lt;/ref&gt; No crampons are suitable for B0 boots (flexible walking boots).

==Ski crampons==
Specialized "ski crampons" are employed in [[ski mountaineering]] on hard snow and ice. Far more common in the [[Alps]] than in the United States, these ski crampons are known by their European names: ''[[:de:Harscheisen|Harscheisen]]'' (German), ''couteaux'' (French) and ''coltelli'' (Italian){{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}, literally French and Italian for "[[Knife|knives]]" in those languages.

'''Delivery Bar Code Sorter''' or '''DBCS''' refers to a set of sorting machines used in mail sorting industry primarily by [[USPS]]. They sort letters at a rate of approximately 38,000 pieces per hour, with a 99% accuracy rate. A computerized camera reads the addresses of the mail, and sorts it to one of up to 286 pockets, setting it up for delivery by the letter carrier.

The [[Philippines]]' '''Department of Science and Technology''' (abbreviated as '''DOST'''; {{lang-fil|Kagawaran ng Agham at Teknolohiya}}), is the [[Executive departments of the Philippines|executive department]] of the Philippine Government responsible for the coordination of science and technology-related projects in the Philippines and to formulate policies and projects in the fields of science and technology in support of national development.

==History==
The DOST was formed as the National Science Development Board in June 13, 1958, during the administration of President [[Carlos P. Garcia]]. The science body was formed as a result of a law passed in the [[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]] upon the recommendation of Dr. Frank Co Tui, who was tasked by Garcia to conduct a survey regarding the state of science and technology in the country. It was reorganized as the National Science and Technology Authority (NSTA) in March 17, 1981 and was given broader policy-making and program implementing functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DOST-SEI History|url=http://www.dostscholars.com/boards/content.php?article=2|website=DOST-SEI Scholars Online|publisher=DOST-SEI Scholars Online Community.|accessdate=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brief"&gt;{{cite web|title=The DOST in Brief|url=http://www.dost.gov.ph/index.php/transparency/about-dost/history-and-logo|website=Department of Science and Technology|accessdate=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 30, 1987, during the administration of President [[Corazon Aquino]], the NSTA was elevated to [[Cabinet of the Philippines|cabinet-level status]] with the signing of Executive Order 128, and was renamed as the Department of Science and Technology.&lt;ref name="brief"/&gt;

==Functions==

# Formulate and adopt a comprehensive National Science and Technology Plan, and monitor and coordinate its funding and implementation;
# Promote, assist and, where appropriate, undertake scientific and technological research and development in areas identified as vital to the country's development;
# Promote the development of indigenous technology and the adaptation and innovation of suitable imported technology, and in this regard, undertake technology development up to commercial stage;

{{Outdated|date=January 2015}}[[File:VCF 2010 Domesday tray open.jpg|thumb|300px|A Domesday Project machine with its modified [[Laserdisc]]. The Domesday Project was published in 1986.]]
'''Digital obsolescence''' is a situation where a digital resource is no longer readable because of its archaic format: the physical media, the reader (required to read the media), the hardware, or the software that runs on it is no longer available.&lt;ref name='national-archives'&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | title =Managing Digital Obsolescence Risks | work = | publisher =The National Archives | date =April 2009 | url = http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/information-management/siro-guidance-on-the-risk-of-digital-obsolescence.pdf| format = pdf| doi = | accessdate = | archiveurl =http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110628093401/http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/information-management/siro-guidance-on-the-risk-of-digital-obsolescence.pdf | archivedate = 28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A prime example of this is the [[BBC Domesday Project]] from the 1980s, although its data was eventually recovered after a significant amount of effort. [[Cornell University]] Library’s [http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/dpm/dpm-eng/eng_index.html digital preservation tutorial] (now hosted by [[ICPSR]]) has a timeline of obsolete media formats, called the [http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/dpm/dpm-eng/oldmedia/index.html "Chamber of Horrors"], that shows how rapidly new technologies are created and cast aside.

==Introduction==
The rapid evolution and proliferation of different kinds of [[computer hardware]], modes of digital encoding, [[operating systems]] and general or specialized [[software]] ensures that digital obsolescence will become a problem in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Rothenberg, J. (1998). [http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/rothenberg/introduction.html#longevity Avoiding Technological Quicksand: Finding a Viable Technical Foundation for Digital Preservation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205034223/http://clir.org/pubs/reports/rothenberg/introduction.html |date=2007-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many versions of word-processing programs, data-storage media, standards for encoding images and films are considered "standards" for some time, but in the end are always replaced by new versions of the software or completely new hardware. Files meant to be read or edited with a certain program (for example [[Microsoft Word]]) will be unreadable in other programs, and as operating systems and hardware move on, even old versions of programs developed by the same company become impossible to use on the new platform (for instance, older versions of [[Microsoft Works]], before Works 4.5, cannot be run under [[Windows 2000]] or later). 

Early attention was brought to the challenges of preserving [[machine-readable data]] by the work of [[Charles M Dollar]] in the 1970s, but it was only during the 1990s that libraries and archives came to appreciate the significance of the problem&lt;ref&gt;Hedstrom, M. (1995). [http://www.uky.edu/%7Ekiernan/DL/hedstrom.html Digital Preservation: A Time Bomb for Digital Libraries] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161129124739/http://www.uky.edu/~kiernan/DL/hedstrom.html |date=2016-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been discussed among professionals in those branches, though so far without any obvious solutions other than continual forward-migration of files and information to the latest data-storage standards. File formats should be widespread, backward compatible, often upgraded, and, ideally, open format. In 2002, the National Initiative for a Networked Cultural Heritage cited&lt;ref&gt;National Initiative for a Networked Cultural Heritage. (2002). [http://www.nyu.edu/its/humanities/ninchguide/V/ NINCH Guide to Good Practice in the Digital Representation and Management of Cultural Heritage Materials] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212150633/http://www.nyu.edu/its/humanities/ninchguide/V/ |date=2007-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the following as "de facto" formats that are unlikely to be rendered obsolete in the near future: uncompressed [[TIFF]] and [[ASCII]] and [[Rich Text Format|RTF]] (for text).

In order to prevent this from happening, it is important that an institution regularly evaluate and explore its current technologies and evaluate its long term business model.&lt;ref name='national-archives'/&gt;

== Types ==
Digital objects are vulnerable to three types of obsolescence:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=National Archives of Australia |title=Obsolescence – a key challenge in the digital age |url=http://www.naa.gov.au/records-management/agency/preserve/e-preservation/obsolescence.aspx |accessdate=17 March 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317184658/http://www.naa.gov.au/records-management/agency/preserve/e-preservation/obsolescence.aspx |archivedate=17 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Physical media''': the physical carrier of the digital file becomes obsolete; e.g. 8 inch floppy disks, which are no longer commercially available. 
# '''Hardware''': the hardware needed to access the digital file becomes obsolete; e.g. floppy disk drive, which computers are no longer manufactured with.
# '''Software''': the software needed to access the digital file becomes obsolete; e.g. [[WordStar]], a word processor popular in the 1980s which used a [[Open data|closed data]] format and is no longer readily available. Another form, especially for video games, is [[Abandonware]] which is without continued support very fast obsolete and incompatible with recent systems.

==Intentional obsolescence==
In some cases, obsolete technologies are used in a deliberate attempt to avoid data intrusion in a strategy known as "[[security through obsolescence]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.linux.com/articles/23313 |title=Security through obsolescence |first=Robin |last=Miller |publisher=Linux.com |date=2002-06-06 |accessdate=2008-07-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080628150837/http://www.linux.com/articles/23313 |archivedate=2008-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Copyright issues as challenge ==
Untangling [[copyright]] issues also presented a significant challenge for projects attempting to overcome the obsolescence issues related to the BBC Domesday Project. In addition to copyright surrounding the many contributions made by the estimated 1 million people who took part in the project, there are also copyright issues that relate to the technologies employed. It is likely that the Domesday Project will not be completely free of copyright restrictions until at least 2090, unless copyright laws are revised for earlier [[Copyright term|expiration]] of software into [[Public domain software|public domain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.si.umich.edu/CAMILEON/reports/IPRreport.doc |title=The CAMiLEON Project: Legal issues arising from the work aiming to preserve elements of the interactive multimedia work entitled "The BBC Domesday Project." |first=Andrew |last=Charlesworth |date=5 November 2002 |publisher=Information Law and Technology Unit, [[University of Hull]] |location=Kingston upon Hull |format=Microsoft Word |accessdate=23 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110206080418/http://www2.si.umich.edu/CAMILEON/reports/IPRreport.doc |archivedate=6 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Strategies ==
Any organization that has digital records should assess its records to identify any potential risks for file format obsolescence. The Library of Congress maintains [http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/intro/intro.shtml Sustainability of Digital Formats], which includes technical details about many different format types. The UK National Archives maintains an online registry of file formats called [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/PRONOM/Default.aspx PRONOM].

In its 2014 agenda, the National Digital Stewardship Alliance recommended developing File Format Action Plans: "it is important to shift from more abstract considerations about file format obsolescence to develop actionable strategies for monitoring and mining information about the heterogeneous digital files the organizations are managing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=National Digital Stewardship Alliance |title=National Agenda for Digital Stewardship 2014 |url=http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/ndsa/documents/2014NationalAgenda.pdf |accessdate=17 March 2014 |date=2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317182537/http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/ndsa/documents/2014NationalAgenda.pdf |archivedate=17 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

File Format Action Plans are documents internal to an organization which list the type of digital files in its holdings and assess what actions should be taken to ensure its ongoing accessibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Owens |first=Trevor |title=File Format Action Plans in Theory and Practice |url=http://blogs.loc.gov/digitalpreservation/2014/01/file-format-action-plans-in-theory-and-practice/ |accessdate=17 March 2014 |date=6 January 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317194510/http://blogs.loc.gov/digitalpreservation/2014/01/file-format-action-plans-in-theory-and-practice/ |archivedate=17 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples include the [http://fclaweb.fcla.edu/node/795 Florida Digital Archive Action Plan] and University of Michigan's [http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/static/about/deepbluepreservation.html Deep Blue Preservation and Format Support Policy].

[[Open source software]] is often cited as solution for preventing digital obsolescence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cassia |first=Fernando |title=Open Source, the only weapon against 'planned obsolescence' |date=March 28, 2007 |publisher=[[The Inquirer]] |url=http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1001739/open-source-weapon-planned-obsolescence |accessdate=August 2, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420223957/http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1001739/open-source-weapon-planned-obsolescence |archivedate=April 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Also, there is in general a strong [[cross-platform]] culture in the open source software ecosystem, which makes the systems and software more future proof.

[[Open standard]]s were created to prevent digital obsolesce of file formats and hardware interfaces. For instance, [[PDF/A]] is an [[open standard]] based on [[Adobe Systems]] [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://acroeng.adobe.com/wp/?page_id=303|title = Adobe Acrobat Engineering:PDF Standards|accessdate = 7 July 2013|date = 12 March 2013|publisher = Adobe|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130707172612/http://acroeng.adobe.com/wp/?page_id=303|archivedate = 7 July 2013|deadurl = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been widely adopted by governments and archives around the world, such as the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Viewing government documents |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-standards-for-government/viewing-government-documents |publisher=Cabinet Office |website=GOV.UK |date=6 August 2015 |accessdate=10 September 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151003081919/https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-standards-for-government/viewing-government-documents |archivedate=3 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[OpenDocument|The Open Document Format for Office Applications (OpenDocument)]] has been standardized by [[OASIS (organization)|OASIS]] in 2005, and by ISO in 2006.

The '''Electronics Technicians Association, International''' (dba '''ETA&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; International''') is a US-based [[not-for-profit]] 501(c) 6 professional association founded in 1978. The association provides certifications in industries such as basic [[electronics]], [[fiber optics]] and [[data cabling]], [[renewable energy]], [[information technology]], [[photonics]] and precision [[optics]], [[customer service]], [[biomedical]], [[avionics]], [[wireless communications]], [[radar]], and [[smart home]]. ETA is also one of the 13 COLEMs (Commercial Operator License Examination Manager) for U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wireless.fcc.gov/commoperators/index.htm?job=cole|title=Commercial Radio Operator License Program|work=fcc.gov|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ETA works with technicians, educators, and military personnel. ETA also partners with companies such as [[Motorola Solutions]] to provide certification to their employees.

==History==
In 1965 the U.S. Labor Department, Bureau of Apprenticeship &amp; Training (BAT) instigated a jobs program in cooperation with NEA (National Electronics Association). Local school systems, local TV association members and USDL worked together on an 8,000 hour apprenticeship program aimed at solving the labor shortage problem while finding new vocations for those put out of work by modern technology. This new program would reward trainees, but would not cover experienced technicians. Because of this, the Certified Electronics Technician (CET) program was created.

In 1970 a group of technicians decided to form an organization to promote the CET program and the electronics industry as a whole. This organization would be called the International Society of Certified Electronics Technicians (ISCET). It became a subdivision of NEA.

In the mid-1970s NEA and NATESA merged to form the National Electronic Service Dealers Association (NESDA) with ISCET remaining as a subdivision. Due to a power struggle within the organization, ETA was formed in 1978 by a group of former NESDA members and officers. Among those were Richard "Dick" Glass and Ron Crow, two of the original founders of the CET program and only administrators at that time. This made it easy to continue the CET program with the new organization.

An '''embedded hypervisor''' is a [[hypervisor]] that supports the requirements of [[embedded system]]s.

The requirements for an embedded hypervisor are distinct from hypervisors targeting server and desktop applications.
An embedded hypervisor is designed into the embedded device from the outset, rather than loaded subsequent to device deployment.
While desktop and enterprise environments use hypervisors to consolidate hardware and isolate computing environments from one another, in an embedded system, the various components typically function collectively to provide the device's functionality. [[Mobile virtualization]] overlaps with embedded system virtualization, and shares some use cases.

Typical attributes of embedded virtualization include efficiency, security, communication, isolation and real-time capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-embedded-virtualization/] Virtualization for Embedded Systems&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

Software virtualization has been a major topic in the enterprise space since the late 1960s, but only since the early 2000s has its use appeared in embedded systems. The use of virtualization and its implementation in the form of a hypervisor in embedded systems are very different from enterprise applications. An effective implementation of an embedded hypervisor must deal with a number of issues specific to such applications.  These issues include the highly integrated nature of embedded systems, the requirement for isolated functional blocks within the system to communicate rapidly, the need for real-time/deterministic performance, the resource-constrained target environment and the wide range of security and reliability requirements.

=== Hypervisor ===
A [[hypervisor]] provides one or more software virtualization environments in which other software, including [[operating system]]s, can run with the appearance of full access to the underlying system hardware, where in fact such access is under the complete control of the hypervisor.  These virtual environments are called [[virtual machine]]s (VM)s, and a hypervisor will typically support multiple VMs managed simultaneously.

==== Classification ====
Hypervisors are generally classed as either type 1 or type 2, depending on whether the hypervisor runs exclusively in [[supervisor mode]] or privileged mode (type 1) or is itself hosted by an operating system as a regular application (type 2).

Type 1 hypervisors manage key system resources required to maintain control over the virtual machines, and facilitate a minimal [[trusted computing base]] (TCB). Type 2 hypervisors typically run as an application within a more general purpose operating system, relying on services of the OS to manage system resources. Nowadays kernel extensions are often loaded to take advantage of hardware with virtualization support.

=== Embedded hypervisor ===
An embedded hypervisor is most often a type 1 hypervisor which supports the requirements of [[embedded system]]s development.   See references&lt;ref&gt;[https://ts.data61.csiro.au/publications/nicta_full_text/553.pdf] Role of Virtualization in Embedded Systems&lt;/ref&gt; and&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.electronicproducts.com/Virtualization_and_hypervisors_aid_embedded_design-article-FAJH05_LynuxWorks-Apr2008-html.aspx] Virtualization and hypervisors aid embedded design&lt;/ref&gt; for a more detailed discussion.

These requirements are summarized below.

* ''A small, fast hypervisor with support for multiple isolated VMs;''
* ''Support for lightweight but secure encapsulation of medium-grain subsystem components that interact strongly;''
* ''High-bandwidth, low-latency communication between system components, subject to a configurable, system-wide security policy;''
* ''Minimal impact on system resources and support real-time latency guarantees;''
* ''Ability to implement a scheduling policy between VMs and provide support for real-time system components;''

== Implementation ==
An embedded hypervisor typically provides multiple VMs, each of which emulates a hardware platform on which the virtualised software executes. The VM may emulate the underlying native hardware, in which case embedded code that runs on the real machine will run on the virtual machine and vice versa.  An emulation of the native hardware is not always possible or desired, and a ''virtual platform'' may be defined instead.

When a VM provides a virtual platform, guest software has to be [[Porting|ported]] to run in this environment, however since a virtual platform can be defined without reliance on the native hardware, guest software supporting a virtual platform can be run unmodified across various distinct hardware platforms supported by the hypervisor.

Embedded hypervisors employ either [[paravirtualization]] or use virtualization features of the underlying CPU. Paravirtualization
is required in cases where the hardware does not assist, and involves often extensive modifications to core architecture support core of guest kernels. Emulation of hardware at the register level is rarely seen in embedded hypervisors as this is very complex and slow. The custom nature of embedded systems means that the need to support unmodified binary-only guest software which require these techniques is rare.

The size and efficiency of the implementation is also an issue for an embedded hypervisor, as embedded systems are often much more resource constrained than desktop and server platforms. It is also desirable for the hypervisor to maintain, as closely as possible, the native speed, real-time response and determinism and power efficiency of the underlying hardware platform.

=== Hypervisor design ===


Implementations for embedded systems applications have most commonly been based on small [[microkernel]] and [[separation kernel]] designs, with virtualization built-in as an integral capability. This was introduced with [[PikeOS]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sysgo.com/services-solutions/sysgo-solutions-at-work/success-stories/five-years-of-reinventing-embedded-systems-design/] Five years of reinventing embedded systems design&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of these approaches have been produced by companies such as [[Open Kernel Labs]] (microkernel followed by a separation kernel) and [[LynuxWorks]] (separation kernel). [[VirtualLogix]] appears to take the position that an approach based on a dedicated [[Virtual Machine]] Monitor (VMM) would be even smaller and more efficient.  This issue is the subject of some ongoing debate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://os.inf.tu-dresden.de/papers_ps/reducingtcb.pdf] Small kernels versus virtual-machine monitors&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/srg/netos/papers/2005-hotos-vmm.pdf] Are Virtual Machine Monitors Microkernels Done Right?&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.l4ka.org/publications/2005/PA005103_NICTA.pdf] (Response to) Are Virtual-Machine Monitors Microkernels Done Right?&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the main point at issue is the same on all sides of the discussion – the speed and size of the implementation (for a given level of functionality) are of major importance. For example: " ... hypervisors for embedded use must be real-time capable, as well as resource-miserly."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eembc.org/benchmark/hyper_sl.php] Embedded hypervisor performance &amp; benchmarking&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Resource requirements ===

Embedded systems are typically highly resource constrained due to cost and technical limitations of the hardware. It is therefore important for an embedded hypervisor to be as efficient as possible. The microkernel and separation kernel based designs allow for small and efficient hypervisors. 
Thus embedded hypervisors usually have a [[memory footprint]] from several tens to several hundred kilobytes, depending on the efficiency of the implementation and the level of functionality provided.  An implementation requiring several megabytes of memory (or more) is generally not acceptable.

With the small TCB of a type 1 embedded hypervisor, the system can be made highly secure &amp; reliable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usenix.org/publications/login/2007-12/pdfs/heiser.pdf] Is Your System Secure?&lt;/ref&gt; Standard software-engineering techniques, such as code inspections and systematic testing, can be used to reduce the number of bugs in such a small code base to a tiny fraction of the defects that must be expected for a hypervisor and guest OS combination that may be 100,000–300,000 lines in total.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.ok-labs.com/GetEducated?action=AttachFile&amp;do=view&amp;target=Trustworthy_Computing_Systems.pdf] Trustworthy Computing Systems&lt;/ref&gt;

=== VM communication ===


One of the most important functions required in an embedded hypervisor is a secure message-passing mechanism, which is needed to support real-time communication between processes. In the embedded environment, a system will typically have a number of closely coupled tasks, some of which may require secure isolation from each other.   In a virtualized environment, the embedded hypervisor will support and enforce this isolation between multiple VMs.  These VMs will therefore require access to a mechanism that provides low-latency communication between the tasks.

An [[inter-process communication]] (IPC) mechanism can be used to provide these functions, as well as invoking all system services, and implemented in a manner which ensures that the desired level of VM isolation is maintained. Also, due to its significant impact on system performance, such an IPC mechanism should be highly optimised for minimal latency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.55.9939] Improving IPC by Kernel Design&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hardware requirements ===


An embedded hypervisor needs to be in complete control of system resources, including memory accesses, to ensure that software cannot break out of the VM. A hypervisor therefore requires the target [[Central processing unit|CPU]] to provide [[memory management]] support (typically using an [[Memory management unit|MMU]]). Many embedded processors including such as [[ARM_architecture|ARM]], [[MIPS_Technologies|MIPS]] and [[PowerPC]] have followed desktop and server chip vendors in adding hardware support for virtualization. There are still a large proportion of embedded processors however which do not provide such support and a hypervisor supporting [[paravirtualization]] is required.

ARM processors are notable in that most of their application class processor designs support a technology called ARM TrustZone, which provides essentially hardware support for one privileged and one unprivileged VM. Normally a minimal Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) OS is run in the ''Secure World'' and a native kernel running in the ''Non-secure World''.

== Use cases ==
Some of the most common use cases for an embedded hypervisor are:&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1.	OS independence'''&lt;br /&gt;
Designers of embedded systems may have many hardware drivers and system services which are specific to a target platform.  If support for more than one OS is required on the platform, either concurrently or consecutively using a common hardware design, an embedded hypervisor can greatly simplify the task.   Such drivers and system services can be implemented just once for the virtualized environment; these services are then available to any hosted OS.  This level of abstraction also allows the embedded developer to implement or change a driver or service in either hardware or software at any point, without this being apparent to the hosted OS.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''2.	Support for multiple operating systems on a single processor'''&lt;br /&gt;
Typically this is used to run a [[real-time operating system]] (RTOS) for low-level real-time functionality (such as the communication stack) while at the same time running a general purpose OS, [[Operating system|(GPOS)]] like [[Linux]] or [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], to support user applications, such as a web browser or calendar.  The objective might be to upgrade an existing design without the added complexity of a second processor, or simply to minimize the [[bill of materials]] (BoM).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''3.	System security'''&lt;br /&gt;
An embedded hypervisor is able to provide secure encapsulation for any subsystem defined by the developer, so that a compromised subsystem cannot interfere with other subsystems.  For example, an encryption subsystem needs to be strongly shielded from attack to prevent leaking the information the encryption is supposed to protect.  As the embedded hypervisor can encapsulate a subsystem in a VM, it can then enforce the required security policies for communication to and from that subsystem.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''4.	System reliability'''&lt;br /&gt;
The encapsulation of a subsystem components into a VM ensures that failure of any subsystem cannot impact other subsystems. This encapsulation keeps faults from propagating from a subsystem in one VM to a subsystem in another VM, improving reliability. This may also allow a subsystem to be automatically shut down and restarted on fault detection. This can be particularly important for embedded device drivers, as this is where the highest density of fault conditions is seen to occur, and is thus the most common cause of OS failure and system instability. It also allows the encapsulation of operating systems that were not necessarily built to the reliability standards demanded of the new system design.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''5.	Dynamic update of system software'''&lt;br /&gt;
Subsystem software or applications can be securely updated and tested for integrity, by downloading to a secure VM before “going live” in an executing system.  Even if this process then fails, the system can revert to its former state by restarting the original software subsystem/application, without halting system operation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''6.	Legacy code re-use'''&lt;br /&gt;
Virtualization allows legacy embedded code to be used with the OS environment it has been developed and validated with, while freeing the developer to use a different OS environment in a separate VM for new services and applications.  Legacy embedded code, written for a particular system configuration may assume exclusive control of all system resources of memory, I/O and processor.  This code base can be re-used unchanged on alternative system configurations of I/O and memory through the use of a VM to present a resource map and functionality that is consistent with the original system configuration, effectively de-coupling the legacy code from the specifics of a new or modified hardware design.&lt;br /&gt;
Where access to the operating system source code is available, [[paravirtualization]] is commonly used to virtualize the OS’s on processors without hardware virtualization support, and thus the applications supported by the OS can also run unmodified and without re-compilation  in new hardware platform designs.&lt;br /&gt;
Even without source access, legacy binary code can be executed in systems running on processors with hardware virtualization support such as the [[x86 virtualization#AMD virtualization .28AMD-V.29|AMD-V]], [[x86 virtualization#Intel virtualization .28VT-x.29|Intel VT]] technologies and the latest [[ARM architecture|ARM]] processors with virtualization support.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arm.com/products/processors/technologies/virtualization-extensions.php] ARM Virtualization Extensions&lt;/ref&gt;  The legacy binary code could run completely unmodified in a VM with all resource mapping handled by the embedded hypervisor, assuming the system hardware provides equivalent functionality.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''7.   IP protection'''&lt;br /&gt;
Valuable proprietary [[Intellectual property|IP]] may need protection from theft or misuse when an embedded platform is being shipped for further development work by (for example) an [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]] customer.    An embedded hypervisor makes it possible to restrict access by other system software components to a specific part of the system containing IP that needs to be protected.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''8.  Software license segregation'''&lt;br /&gt;
Software IP operating under one licensing scheme can be separated from other software IP operating under a different scheme.   For example, the embedded hypervisor can provide an isolated execution environment for proprietary software sharing the processor with open source software subject to the GPL.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/gpl-faq.html] GPL FAQ&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''9.	Migration of applications from uni-core to multi-core systems'''&lt;br /&gt;
As new processors utilise multi-core architectures to increase performance, the embedded hypervisor can manage the underlying architecture and present a uni-processor environment to legacy applications and operating systems while efficiently using the new multiprocessor system design.  In this way a change in hardware environment does not require a change to the existing software.

The '''Enzmann starship''' is a concept for a manned [[interstellar spacecraft]] proposed in 1964 by Dr. Robert Enzmann.&lt;ref name=ridpath78/&gt;&lt;ref name=Long&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=EAD2-GrarkEC&amp;pg=PA189&amp;lpg=PA189&amp;dq=enzmann+starship&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dPluuHg0JS&amp;sig=kUy_ywxkSrzrpShnuhiYY8M2ns8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=na-WT7HxB9PptgfdytiIDw&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=enzmann%20starship&amp;f=false K. F.

The ball of frozen deuterium would fuel thermonuclear-powered [[Nuclear pulse propulsion|pulse propulsion]] units, similar to [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Project Orion]] engines. The spacecraft would be assembled in Earth orbit as part of a larger project preceded by [[interstellar probe]]s and telescopic observation of target star systems. The rest of the spacecraft would be attached behind the ball as a seamless metallic fuel tank. The proposed method of tank construction would be to expand a plastic balloon in space and coat it with metal.

The spacecraft would be modular, and the main living area would be three identical {{convert|300|ft|m}} wide and long cylindrical modules.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VVQEAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22Enzmann+starship%22&amp;dq=%22Enzmann+starship%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7EHlTM_BOYP88Ab7ldDUDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAQ Analog science fiction/science fact, Volume 91, Issue 4, Page 22 (Google Books link accessed November 18, 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt; The Enzmann could function as an [[interstellar ark]], supporting a crew of 200 but with space for expansion.&lt;ref name=ridpath78&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=REEIAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Enzmann+starship&amp;dq=Enzmann+starship&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=d5LmTOfOGIP_8AbYpLWvDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwCQ Ian Ridpath - '''Messages from the stars: communication and contact with extraterrestrial life''' (1978, Harper &amp; Row, 241 pages) = Google Books 2010], Quote: "As long ago as 1964, Robert D. Enzmann of the Raytheon Corporation proposed an interstellar ark driven by eight nuclear pulse rockets. The living quarters of the starship, habitable by 200 people but with room for growth, ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

The Enzmann starship was detailed in the October 1973 issue of ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Analog]]'', with a cover by space artist [[Rick Sternbach]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/pl.cgi?ANLGOCT73 ISFDB Publication Listing: Analog Science Fiction/Science Fact, October 1973]&lt;/ref&gt; The spacecraft described in that issue had some differences compared to the 1960s proposal, such as using a 12,000,000 ton (11,000,000 [[tonne]]s) ball of frozen [[deuterium]]. Enzmanns have been depicted by many space artists including [[Don Dixon (artist)|Don Dixon]], [[David A. Hardy]], [[Syd Mead]], [[Bob Eggleton]], and [[Rick Sternbach]].

Sources conflict about the projected speed, perhaps 30%&lt;!-- sources conflict about top speed --&gt; of the [[speed of light]], ''c'', but 9% may be more likely. At 30%, [[special relativity|relativistic effects]] between people on Earth and on the spacecraft, such as [[time dilation]] would become more noticeable, such as the shipboard time being less than the Earth observed time.

Overall specifications have varied somewhat, but the design has nuclear pulse engines at the rear, then cylinders for human habitation, then closer the front a large ball of fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EAD2-GrarkEC&amp;pg=PA189&amp;dq=Enzmann+starship&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjCjszU-brcAhUCMqwKHaFkDmQQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Enzmann%20starship&amp;f=false|title=Deep Space Propulsion: A Roadmap to Interstellar Flight|last=Long|first=K.

'''Forever Living Products International, Inc.''' (FLPI) is an American [[Privately held company|privately-held]] [[multi-level marketing]] (MLM) company based in [[Scottsdale, Arizona|Scottsdale]], [[Arizona]], which manufactures and markets [[aloe vera]]-based drinks and [[bee]]-derived cosmetics, [[dietary supplements]], and personal care products.&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt; The company was founded in 1978 by CEO [[Rex Maughan]]. After acquiring the company '''Aloe Vera of America''' by the 1990s,&lt;ref name="flabaloeveraofmaerica"/&gt; In 2010, the company reported having over 4,000 employees, a network of 9.3 million distributors, and revenue of $1.7 billion.&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="flademmert"/&gt;

==History==
Forever Living was founded in 1978 in [[Tempe, Arizona]]&lt;ref name=FLP/&gt; by Carl Jensen and [[Rex Maughan]].&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt; By the 1990s, Maughan had purchased the Texas company Aloe Vera of America, with Aloe Vera of America selling its products to Forever Living for distribution.&lt;ref name="flabaloeveraofmaerica"/&gt; Some journalists have likened the [[multi-level marketing]] business model of Forever Living's distribution system to that of a [[pyramid scheme]].&lt;ref name="manilatimes"/&gt;

[[File:Forever Living in McCormick Ranch in 2007.png|thumb|Forever Living Products headquarters in McCormick Ranch in Arizona in 2007. The company's resort division owns several similar properties.]]
In 1983, the company was named No. 6 on [[Inc. (magazine)|''Inc. Magazine'']]'s annual Inc. 500 list of the fastest-growing private companies in the United States.&lt;ref name="cmor"/&gt;

According to Arthur Andersen's Top 100, as of 1993, Forever Living Products International was Arizona's second-largest private company.&lt;ref name="flaabestkeptsecret"/&gt; As of August 1995, ''[[Forbes]]'' reported the company's product line included "deodorants, toothpaste, [[laundry detergent]] and three dozen other products, nearly all of which contain extract of aloe."&lt;ref name="dmor"/&gt;

Annual revenue exceeded $1.15 billion in 2005&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt; and Forever Living ended the year with around 150,000 distributors,&lt;ref name="zfro"/&gt; and 55 employees.&lt;ref name="zffinancier"/&gt; The following year, Forever Living was listed at No. 340 on the [[Forbes 400]] list, which ranks the largest private companies in the United States. At the time, the company was described as having 4,100 employees and sold its product in 100 countries."&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt;

In 2010, revenue was $1.7 billion, and the company was selling its products through 9.3 million distributors.&lt;ref name="flademmert"/&gt; In 2013 the publication ''[[New Vision (newspaper)|New Vision]]'' reported that Forever Living had over 20,000 distributors in [[Uganda]], of which only 83 had reached a managerial level and begun to recoup expenses; their investigation concluded that Forever Living Products' "distribution system does not guarantee profits and majority of members drop out along the way, after losing millions."&lt;ref name=kagolo /&gt; The company was active in over 150 countries as of 2015.&lt;ref name=FLP/&gt; In February 2015, the company announced they had appointed a new management team to "oversee the affairs of the company in [[Nigeria]]."&lt;ref name="amortidenews"/&gt;

In 1996, upon suggestion of the American authorities, the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) and the [[National Tax Agency]] of Japan (NTA) initiated a joint audit of Rex and Ruth Maughan and related entities Aloe Vera of America (AVA), Selective Art Inc., FLP International, and FLP Japan for the period of 1991 to 1995.&lt;ref name="bcoptexax"/&gt; In 1997, the NTA imposed a penalty tax of 3.5 billion yen on Forever Living's Japan division for concealing income of 7.7 billion yen over the five-year period.&lt;ref name="niflbkyodo"/&gt; Later that year, AVA, Rex and Ruth Maughan, Maughan Holdings, Gene Yamagata, and Yamagata Holdings&lt;ref name="aaloevera"/&gt; sued the IRS for unauthorized disclosure of tax return information.&lt;ref name="niflbkyodo"/&gt; In the midst of the lawsuit, The IRS asked the NTA to drop its decision against Forever Living, and in 2002, the agency “grudgingly complied with the IRS's request”, announcing that the penalty tax had been effectively withdrawn.&lt;ref name="niflbkyodo"/&gt; In February 2015, a USA district court ruled that the IRS knowingly provided some false information about AVA to the NTA, in violation of the United States' tax treaty with Japan.&lt;ref name="niflasixty"/&gt; and awarded three of the plaintiffs one thousand dollars each in statutory damages.&lt;ref name="niflasixty"/&gt;

In 2004 claims made about Forever Living products were found to be in violation of several laws in Hungary related to advertising, registration of nutritional products, and the use of cosmetics as medicinal agents. As a result, the company was fined 60 million HUF (approximately $280,000 USD).&lt;ref name="hun"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gvh.hu/gvh/alpha?do=2&amp;pg=11&amp;m5_doc=3743|title=Hungarian Economic Competition Office fined FLP for 60 million HUF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, author [[Richard Bach]] made claims against the company for [[copyright infringement]] and [[trademark infringement]].&lt;ref name=fanfiction/&gt; The lawsuit stated that for over 20 years Forever Living had used the character, storyline, and copyrighted excerpts from the novel ''[[Jonathan Livingston Seagull]]'' to promote its marketing plan, and also used the [[Jonathan Livingston Seagull (film)|motion picture]] and novel as its corporate logo.&lt;ref name="copyright"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3858152414403488946&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr|title=Richard BACH, et al., Plaintiffs, v.

In 2015, Forever Living was criticized by the UK Advertising Standards Authority for making false claims about the health benefits of its products, which were sold as a cure for various diseases ranging from diabetes to Crohn's disease. The company was also warned not to use health professionals in its promotional materials.

'''Fuels America''' is a coalition of organizations working in support of the [[Renewable Fuel Standard]]. The website of the group states their purpose as "promoting the benefits of all types of renewable fuel already growing in America.

==Founding and mission==
Fuels America was announced in 2012 during a conference call of the [[Biotechnology Industry Organization]] (BIO).&lt;ref name="Found"&gt;{{cite news |last=Schill |first=Susanne Retka |date=27 September 2012 |title=New Fuels America coalition launches campaign to defend RFS |url=http://ethanolproducer.com/articles/9152/new-fuels-america-coalition-launches-campaign-to-defend-rfs |newspaper=Ethanol Producer Magazine |location=United States |access-date=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ad campaigns==
Examples of the efforts of Fuels America include an ad campaign launched in July 2013, with a focus on choice in energy. The ad campaign was "targeted to policy makers in Washington DC and focused on supporting the Renewable Fuel Standard." Concurrent activities also included testifying in front of the United States Congress, such as testimony given by Bob Dinneen in July 2013 to a subcommittee for the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce]].&lt;ref name="campaign1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Zimmerman |first=Cindy |date=22 July 2013 |title=Fuels America Announces New Ad Campaign |url=http://energy.agwired.com/2013/07/22/fuels-america-announces-new-ad-campaign/ |newspaper=AGWIRED.COM |location=United States |access-date=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2015, Fuels America conducted an advertising campaign to support the Renewable Fuel Standard. The campaign included a full-page advertisement in the New York Times and online ads targeted at the Washington, DC area.&lt;ref name="campaign2"&gt;{{cite news |last=Joanna |first=Schroeder |date=20 November 2015 |title=Fuels America Launches RFS Climate Ad Campaign |url=http://energy.agwired.com/2015/11/20/fuels-america-launches-rfs-climate-ad-campaign/ |newspaper=AGWIRED.COM |location=United States |access-date=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Magellan Trailblazer XL GPS Handheld Receiver.jpg|thumb|A 1993 Magellan Trailblazer XL GPS Handheld Receiver]]

[[File:Garmin eTrex10.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Garmin eTrex10 edition handheld]]
A '''GPS navigation device''', '''GPS receiver''', or simply '''GPS''' is a device that is capable of receiving information from [[GPS satellites]] and then to calculate the device's geographical position. Using suitable software, the device may display the position on a map, and it may offer directions. The [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) is a [[satellite navigation|global navigation satellite system]] (GNSS) made up of a network of a minimum of 24, but currently [[List of GPS satellites|30, satellites]] placed into orbit by the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]].&lt;ref name="GPS.gov advice"&gt;{{cite web |last1=US Government|title=GPS.gov|url=http://www.gps.gov/support/faq/#gap1|website=GPS.gov|publisher=US Govt.|accessdate=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GPS was originally developed for use by the United States military, but in the 1980s, the United States government allowed the system to be used for civilian purposes. Though the GPS satellite data is free and works anywhere in the world, the GPS device and the associated software must be bought or rented.

A GPS device can retrieve from the GPS system location and time information in all weather conditions, anywhere on or near the Earth. A GPS reception requires an unobstructed line of sight to four or more GPS satellites,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a GPS?|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/scitech/mysteries/global.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is subject to poor satellite signal conditions. In exceptionally poor signal conditions, for example in urban areas, satellite signals may exhibit [[multipath propagation]] where signals bounce off structures, or are [[Radio propagation#Absorption|weakened]] by meteorological conditions. Obstructed lines of sight may arise from a tree canopy or inside a structure, such as in a building, garage or tunnel. Today, most standalone GPS receivers are used in automobiles. The GPS capability of [[smartphone]]s may use [[assisted GPS]] (A-GPS) technology, which can use the base station or [[cell tower]]s to provide a faster [[Time to First Fix]] (TTFF), especially when GPS signals are poor or unavailable. However, the mobile network part of the A-GPS technology would not be available when the smartphone is outside the range of the mobile reception network, while the GPS aspect would otherwise continue to be available.

The Russian Global Navigation Satellite System ([[GLONASS]]) was developed contemporaneously with GPS, but suffered from incomplete coverage of the globe until the mid-2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Russia Launches Three More GLONASS-M Space Vehicles|url=http://www.insidegnss.com/node/982|publisher=''[[Inside GNSS]]''|accessdate=December 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; GLONASS can be added to GPS devices to make more satellites available and enabling positions to be fixed more quickly and accurately, to within 2 meters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.clove.co.uk/2012/01/10/glonass-the-future-for-all-smartphones/|title=index.php|author=|date=10 January 2012|website=clove.co.uk|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Automotive navigation system==
Using the GPS information and subject to the sophistication of installed GPS software, a GPS device used as an [[automobile navigation system]] may be used in a number of contexts, including:
* maps, including street maps, displayed in human readable format via text or in a graphical format,
* [[turn-by-turn navigation]] directions to a human in charge of a vehicle or vessel via text or speech,
* directions fed directly to an [[Autonomous car|autonomous vehicle]] such as a robotic probe,
* [[traffic congestion map]]s (depicting either historical or real time data) and suggested alternative directions,
* information on nearby amenities such as restaurants, fueling stations, and [[tourist attraction]]s.

GPS devices may be able to indicate:
* the roads or paths available, 
* traffic congestion and alternative routes,
* roads or paths that might be taken to get to the destination,
* if some roads are busy (now or historically) the best route to take,
* The location of food, banks, hotels, fuel, airports or other places of interests,
* the shortest route between the two locations,
* the different options to drive on highway or back roads.

As with many other technological breakthroughs of the latter 20th century, the modern GPS system can reasonably be argued to be a direct outcome of the [[Cold War]] of the latter 20th century. The multibillion-dollar expense of the program was initially justified by military interest.

In 1960, the US Navy put into service its [[Transit (satellite)|Transit satellite]] based navigation system to aid in ship navigation. Between 1960 and 1982, as the benefits were been shown, the US military consistently improved and refined its satellite navigation technology and satellite system. In 1973, the US military began to plan for a comprehensive worldwide navigational system which eventually became known as the GPS (global positioning system). In 1983, in the wake of the tragedy of the downing of the [[Korean Airlines Flight 007]], an aircraft which was shot down while in Soviet airspace due to a navigational error, President Reagan made the navigation capabilities of the existing military GPS system available for dual civilian use. However, civilian use was initially only a slightly degraded "[[Selective Availability]]" positioning signal. This new availability of the US military GPS system for civilian use required a certain technical collaboration with the private sector for some time, before it could become a commercial reality. In 1989, [[Magellan Navigation|Magellan Navigation Inc.]] unveiled its Magellan NAV 1000, the world’s first commercial handheld GPS receiver. These units initially sold for approximately US$2,900 each. In 2000, the Clinton administration removed the military use signal restrictions, thus providing full commercial access to the US GPS satellite system.

In 1990, [[Mazda]]'s [[Eunos Cosmo]] was the first production car in the world with a [[automotive navigation system|built-in GPS navigation system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.motortrend.com/classic/features/12q2_1993_eunos_mazda_cosmo_drive/ |title=1993 Eunos/Mazda Cosmo Classic Drive Uncosmopolitan: Meet the rarest Mazda in America |date=February 2012 |website=Motor Trend |publisher=TEN: The Enthusiast Network |accessdate=18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, [[Mitsubishi]] introduced GPS car navigation on the [[Mitsubishi Debonair]] (MMCS: Mitsubishi Multi Communication System).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXd32z5vN18|title=Mitsubishi DEBONAIR Commercial 1991 Japan|first=|last=Sigma Heart|date=16 January 2015|publisher=|accessdate=3 April 2018|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, a navigation system using [[Differential GPS]] was developed as a factory-installed option on the [[Toyota Prius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.player-top.fr/|title=Autoradio GPS Android pas cher, Caméra radar de recul - Player Top|website=www.player-top.fr|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As GPS navigation systems became more and more widespread and popular, the pricing of such systems began to fall, and their widespread availability steadily increased. Also, several additional manufacturers of these systems, such as [[Garmin]] (1991), [[Twig Com|Benefon]] (1999), [[Mio Technology|Mio]] (2002) and [[TomTom]] (2002) entered the market. Mitac Mio 168 was the first PocketPC to contain a built-in GPS receiver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pocketgpsworld.com/mitacmio168.php|title=Mitac Mio 168 Review|first=Darren|last=Griffin|date=|website=www.pocketgpsworld.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benefon's 1999 entry into the market also presented users with the world's first phone based GPS navigation system. Later, as smartphone technology developed, a GPS chip eventually became standard equipment for most smartphones. To date, ever more popular GPS navigation systems and devices continue to proliferate with newly developed software and hardware applications. It has been incorporated, for example, into cameras.

While the American GPS was the first [[satellite navigation]] system to be deployed on a fully global scale, and to be made available for commercial use, this is not the only system of its type. Due to military and other concerns, similar global or regional systems have been, or will soon be deployed by Russia, the European Union, China, India, and Japan.

== Sensitivity ==
GPS devices vary in sensitivity, speed, vulnerability to [[multipath propagation]], and other performance parameters. '''High Sensitivity [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]''' receivers use large banks of correlators{{clarify|date=June 2016}}{{cit|date=June 2016}} and [[digital signal processing]] to search for GPS signals very quickly. This results in very fast [[time to first fix|times to first fix]] when the signals are at their normal levels, for example outdoors. When GPS signals are weak, for example indoors, the extra processing power can be used to integrate weak signals to the point where they can be used to provide a position or timing solution.

GPS signals are already very weak when they arrive at the Earth’s surface. The [[GPS satellite]]s only transmit 27&amp;nbsp;W (14.3&amp;nbsp;dBW) from a distance of 20,200&amp;nbsp;km in [[orbit]] above the Earth. By the time the signals arrive at the user's receiver, they are typically as weak as −160 [[dBW]], equivalent to one tenth of a million-billionth of a watt (100&amp;nbsp;attowatts). This is well below the thermal noise level in its bandwidth. Outdoors, GPS signals are typically around the −155 dBW level (−125 [[dBm]]).

Conventional GPS receivers integrate the received GPS signals for the same amount of time as the duration of a complete [[Global Positioning System#Navigation signals|C/A code cycle]] which is 1 ms. This results in the ability to acquire and track signals down to around the −160 dBW level. High Sensitivity GPS receivers are able to integrate the incoming signals for up to 1,000 times longer than this and therefore acquire signals up to 1,000 times weaker, resulting in an integration gain of 30&amp;nbsp;dB. A good High Sensitivity GPS receiver can acquire signals down to −185 dBW, and tracking can be continued down to levels approaching −190 dBW.

High Sensitivity GPS can provide positioning in many but not all [[Indoor positioning system|indoor locations]]. Signals are either heavily [[attenuation|attenuated]] by the building materials or reflected as in [[Multipath propagation|multipath]]. Given that High Sensitivity GPS receivers may be up to 30 [[decibel|dB]] more sensitive, this is sufficient to track through 3 layers of dry bricks, or up to 20&amp;nbsp;cm (8 inches) of steel reinforced concrete for example.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Examples of high sensitivity receiver chips include [[SiRFstarIII]] and [[MediaTek]]ʼs MTK II.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite patent | country = US | number = 6674401 | status = Patent | title = High sensitivity GPS receiver and reception | pubdate = 21 August 2003 | gdate = 6 January 2004 | fdate = YYYY-MM-DD | pridate = YYYY-MM-DD | inventor = MCBURNEY PAUL W [US]; WOO ARTHUR N [US] | class = G01S19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consumer applications ==
Consumer GPS navigation devices include:
* Dedicated GPS navigation devices
* GPS modules that need to be connected to a computer to be used
* GPS loggers that record trip information for download. Such [[GPS tracking]] is useful for trailblazing, mapping by hikers and cyclists, and the production of [[geocoded photograph]]s.
* Converged devices, including GPS Phones and [[Auto-geotagging|GPS cameras]], in which GPS is a feature rather than the main purpose of the device. The majority of GPS devices are now converged devices, and may use [[assisted GPS]] or standalone (not network dependent) or both. The vulnerability of consumer GPS to radio frequency interference from [[LightSquared#Interference issues|planned wireless data services]] is controversial.

=== Dedicated GPS navigation devices ===
{{see also|automotive navigation system|personal navigation assistant}}
[[File:GPS Receivers 2007.jpg|thumb|Hand-held receivers]]
[[Image:KyotoTaxiRide.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Taxicab|taxi]] equipped with GPS]]

Dedicated devices have various degrees of mobility. ''Hand-held'', ''outdoor'', or ''sport'' receivers have replaceable batteries that can run them for several hours, making them suitable for [[hiking]], [[bicycle touring]] and other activities far from an electric power source. Their screens are small, and some do not show color, in part to save power. Some use [[transflective liquid-crystal display]]s, allowing use in bright sunlight. Cases are rugged and some are water resistant.

Other receivers, often called ''mobile'' are intended primarily for use in a car, but have a small rechargeable internal battery that can power them for an hour or two away from the car. Special purpose devices for use in a car may be permanently installed and depend entirely on the automotive electrical system.

The pre-installed embedded software of early receivers did not display maps; 21st century ones commonly show interactive street maps (of certain regions) that may also show [[Point of interest|points of interest]], route information and step-by-step routing directions, often in spoken form with a feature called "[[text to speech]]".

Manufacturers include:

=== Mobile phones with GPS capability ===
{{further|Comparison of GPS software (disambiguation){{!}}Comparison of GPS software}}

Due in part to regulations encouraging [[mobile phone tracking]], including [[E911]], the majority of GPS receivers are built into [[mobile telephone]]s, with varying degrees of coverage and user accessibility. Commercial navigation software is available for most 21st-century [[smartphone]]s as well&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poi-factory.com/node/36948|title=Smartphone Offline Navigation Software|work=poi-factory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; as some [[Java (programming language)|Java]]-enabled phones that allows them to use an internal or external GPS receiver (in the latter case, connecting via [[serial communications|serial]] or [[Bluetooth]]). Some phones using [[assisted GPS]] (A-GPS) function poorly when out of range of their carrier's cell towers. Others can navigate worldwide with satellite GPS signals as well as a dedicated portable GPS receiver does, upgrading their operation to A-GPS mode when in range. Still others have a [[hybrid positioning system]] that can use other signals when GPS signals are inadequate.

&lt;!--Not sure whether the broadband connection is used to determine GPS (e.g., via SkyHook, ... or whether GPS is separate; meaning that you may or may not receive gps if your broadband access expires; please look up and add--&gt;
More [[bespoke]] solutions also exist for [[smartphone]]s with inbuilt GPS capabilities. Some such phones can use [[tethering]] to double as a [[wireless modem]] for a [[laptop]], while allowing GPS-navigation/localisation as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402151446/http://www.track-phone.net/monitor/example-of-hookup-of-gps-phone/|title=Sony Ericsson - Mobile Broadband - Overview - EC400g|author=|date=2 April 2015|website=archive.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such example is marketed by [[Verizon Wireless]] in the [[United States]], and is called [[VZ Navigator]]. The system uses [[gpsOne]] technology to determine the location, and then uses the mobile phone's data connection to download maps and calculate navigational routes. Other products including [[iPhone]] are used to provide similar services. [[Nokia]] gives [[HERE Maps]] free on mobile operating systems: Windows Phone 8, Android, Sailfish OS and FirefoxOS, but excluding iOS. Maps can be preloaded onto the device.

According to market research from the independent analyst firm Berg Insight, the sales of GPS-enabled GSM/WCDMA handsets was 150 million units in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berginsight.com/ReportPDF/Summary/bi-gps4-sum.pdf |title=GPS and Mobile Handsets – 4th edition |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=1 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; while only 40 million separate GPS receivers were sold.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/15/technology/15iht-navigate.html Kevin J. O'Brien, New York Times, 15 November 2010] Smartphone Sales Taking Toll on G.P.S. Devices&lt;/ref&gt;

GPS navigation applications for mobile phones include on-line (e.g. [[Waze]], [[Google Maps Navigation]], [[Apple Maps]]) and off-line (e.g. [[iGO (software)|iGo]] for Android, Maverick and [[Here (company)|HERE]] for Windows Phone) navigation applications. [[Google Maps Navigation]], which is included with [[Android (operating system)|Android]], means most smartphone users only need their phone to have a [[personal navigation assistant]].

Many Android smartphones have an additional GPS feature, called ''Extended Prediction Orbit'' (EPO). The phone downloads a file to help it locate GPS satellites more quickly and reduce the [[time to first fix]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bt747.org/book/agps Extended Prediction Orbit] GPS data logger software&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Palm, pocket and laptop PC ===
{{For|manufacturers of commercial software|GPS_navigation_software#Software}}
{{further|Comparison of GPS software (disambiguation){{!}}Comparison of GPS software}}
Software companies have made available [[GPS navigation software]] programs for in-vehicle use on laptop computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laptopgpsworld.com/37-list-laptop-gps-navigation-software-programs-reviews#post73 |title=List of laptop GPS navigation software programs and reviews |publisher=Laptopgpsworld.com |date=27 July 2008 |accessdate=1 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benefits of GPS on a laptop include larger map overview, ability to use the keyboard to control GPS functions, and some GPS software for laptops offers advanced trip-planning features not available on other platforms, such as midway stops, capability of finding alternative scenic routes as well as only highway option.

Palms&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpsinformation.org/dale/Palm/pilotgps.htm#soft|title=Navigation with Palm OS|author=Dale DePriest|work=gpsinformation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pocket PC]]'s can also be equipped with GPS navigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpss.force9.co.uk/navi.htm|title=GPS Navigation with the GPS Software|work=force9.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; A pocket PC differs from a dedicated navigation device as it has an own operating system and can also run other applications.

=== GPS modules ===
[[Image:GPS receiver (mouse).jpg|thumb|A modern SiRFstarIII chip based 20-channel GPS receiver with WAAS/EGNOS support]]
Other GPS devices need to be connected to a computer in order to work. This computer can be a [[home computer]], [[laptop]], [[personal digital assistant|PDA]], [[digital camera]], or [[smartphone]]s. Depending on the type of computer and available connectors, connections can be made through a [[serial cable|serial]] or [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] cable, as well as [[Bluetooth]], [[CompactFlash]], [[Secure Digital card|SD]], [[PC Card|PCMCIA]] and the newer [[ExpressCard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buygpsnow.com/compactflash-sd-gps_10.aspx |title=PCMCIA GPS adaptors |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=5 June 2008 |accessdate=1 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605145708/http://www.buygpsnow.com/compactflash-sd-gps_10.aspx |archivedate=5 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some PCMCIA/ExpressCard GPS units also include a [[wireless modem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108061831/http://www.sonyericsson.com/cws/products/pccards/overview/ec400g?cc=be&amp;lc=en|title=Sony Ericsson - Mobile Broadband - Overview - EC400g|author=|date=8 January 2009|website=archive.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Devices usually do not come with pre-installed [[GPS navigation software]], thus, once purchased, the user must install or write their own software. As the user can choose which software to use, it can be better matched to their personal taste. It is very common for a PC-based GPS receiver to come bundled with a navigation software suite. Also, GPS modules are significantly cheaper than complete stand-alone systems (around [[Euro|€]]50 to €100). The software may include maps only for a particular region, or the entire world, if software such as Google Maps are used.

Some hobbyists have also made some GPS devices and open-sourced the plans. Examples include the Elektor GPS units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elektor-magazine.com/en/magazine-contents/previous-issues.html?tx_elektorarticle_listissues[article]=18921&amp;tx_elektorarticle_listissues[action]=show&amp;cHash=15557dd0aaa057b844b945af27d6960d |title=Multi-purpose GPS Receiver (link1) |publisher=Elektor International Media BV |date=1 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407104044/http://www.elektor-magazine.com/en/magazine-contents/previous-issues.html?tx_elektorarticle_listissues |archivedate=7 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.elektormagazine.com/magazine/elektor-200810/18921 |title=Multi-purpose GPS Receiver (link2)|publisher=ELEKTOR INTERNATIONAL MEDIA BV |date=1 October 2008 |accessdate=16 July 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160716103558/https://www.elektormagazine.com/magazine/elektor-200810/18921 |archivedate=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are based around a [[SiRFstarIII]] chip and are comparable to their commercial counterparts.

== Commercial aviation ==
Commercial aviation applications include GPS devices that calculate location and feed that information to large multi-input navigational computers for [[autopilot]], course information and correction displays to the pilots, and course tracking and recording devices.

== Military ==
Military applications include devices similar to consumer sport products for foot soldiers (commanders and regular soldiers), small vehicles and ships, and devices similar to commercial aviation applications for aircraft and missiles. Examples are the United States military's '''Commander's Digital Assistant''' and the '''Soldier Digital Assistant'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://peosoldier.army.mil/factsheets/SWAR_LW_DBCS.pdf |title=Commanders Digital Assistant explanation and photo |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=1 December 2007 |accessdate=1 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201034857/http://peosoldier.army.mil/factsheets/SWAR_LW_DBCS.pdf |archivedate=1 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://peosoldier.army.mil/factsheets/SWAR_LW_CDA.pdf |title=Latest version Commanders Digital Assistant |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001155532/http://peosoldier.army.mil/factsheets/SWAR_LW_CDA.pdf |archivedate=1 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=4 October 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army-technology.com/contractors/computers/lago/lago6.html |title=Soldier Digital Assistant explanation and photo |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=10 June 2008 |accessdate=1 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610092154/http://www.army-technology.com/contractors/computers/lago/lago6.html |archivedate=10 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sinha |first=Vandana |url=http://gcn.com/articles/2003/07/24/soldiers-take-digital-assistants-to-war.aspx |title=Commanders and Soldiers' GPS receivers |publisher=Gcn.com |date=24 July 2003 |accessdate=1 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to May 2000 only the military had access to the full accuracy of GPS. Consumer devices were restricted by [[Error analysis for the Global Positioning System#Selective availability|selective availability]] (SA), which was scheduled to be phased out but was removed abruptly by President Clinton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gps.gov/systems/gps/modernization/sa/|title=GPS.gov: Selective Availability|work=gps.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Differential GPS]] is a method of cancelling out the error of SA and improving GPS accuracy, and has been routinely available in commercial applications such as for golf carts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leaderboard.com/ABOUTGPS.htm|title=GPS and Golf|author=|date=|website=leaderboard.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; GPS is limited to about 15 meter accuracy even without SA. DGPS can be within a few centimeters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oc.nps.edu/oc2902w/gps/gpsacc.html|title=GPS Accuracy Levels|work=nps.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sequential receivers ==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}
A '''sequential GPS receiver''' tracks the necessary satellites by typically using one or two hardware channels. The set will track one satellite at a time, time tag the measurements and combine them when all four satellite [[pseudorange]]s have been measured. These [[Receiver (information theory)|receivers]] are among the least expensive available, but they cannot operate under high dynamics and have the slowest [[Time to first fix|time-to-first-fix (TTFF)]] performance.

== Mishaps ==
GPS maps and directions are occasionally imprecise.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Some people have gotten lost by asking for the shortest route, like a couple in the United States who were looking for the shortest route from South Oregon to [[Jackpot, Nevada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|title=Body of missing B.C. man Albert Chretien found in Nevada|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/story/2012/10/01/albert-chretien-body-found.html|accessdate=3 October 2012|newspaper=CBC|date=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|title=Husband died just SIX miles from help after he and wife got lost in wild because of GPS ... he died trying to raise alarm but she survived for seven weeks by staying put|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2211532/Albert-Chretien-Remains-Canadian-lost-Nevada-wilderness-miles-town-18-months-later.html|accessdate=3 October 2012|newspaper=Daily Mail|date=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2009 a young mother and her six-year-old son became stranded in [[Death Valley]] after following GPS directions that led her up an unpaved dead end road.

Obsolete maps sometimes cause the unit to lead a user on an indirect, time-wasting route, because roads may change over time. Smartphone GPS information is usually updated automatically, and free of additional charge. Manufacturers of separate GPS devices also offer map update services for their merchandise, usually for a fee.

== Privacy concern ==
Due to the popularity of GPS devices, [[privacy]] of the user becomes a subject of debate. This is because they can give geo-location information of the user. Some commentators think this is private information, and not to be violated without legal approval. However, there were several incidents where the privacy of GPS devices was questioned.

Since GPS devices can give the user's exact location, this helps with [[location-based advertising]].&lt;ref name="Messmer"&gt;{{cite web|last=Messmer|first=Ellen|title=Want security, privacy? Turn off that smartphone, tablet GPS|url=http://www.networkworld.com/news/2012/082112-gps-261824.html|publisher=Network World|accessdate=12 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424220236/http://www.networkworld.com/news/2012/082112-gps-261824.html|archivedate=24 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agencies might promote shops which are near the user, rather than irrelevant, distant ones. The [[advertising agency]] also will store the user's location for future use.&lt;ref name="Messmer"/&gt; However, regulatory agents (especially in USA and Europe) have questioned whether geo-location data should be a sensitive data or not. If it is sensitive data, the can not store it since this amounts to a privacy violation.&lt;ref name="Messmer"/&gt; However, if the regulatory agents choose to consider geo-location as non-sensitive data, then private companies can have permission to store it.

Privacy concerns also arise when employers use [[GPS tracking unit]]s to track their employees' location, for example using [[vehicle tracking system]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=J. Joyce|first=Kenneth|title=Global Positioning Systems and Invasion of Privacy|url=http://www.brinkleymorgan.com/news/191/global-positioning-systems-and-invasion-of-privacy|publisher=Legal Talk|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This raises a major question about whether this violates personal privacy of employees. Concern heightens if the employers collect geo-location data of their employee when not at work. In 2010, [[New York Civil Liberties Union]] filed a case against the Labor Department for firing Michael Cunningham after tracking Michael Cunningham's daily activity and locations using a GPS device that was attached to his car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=KARLIN|first=RICK|title=GPS used to track fired state worker raises privacy issue|url=http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/GPS-used-to-track-fired-state-worker-raises-2172601.php|publisher=TIMESUNION|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This raises a few questions regarding the limit of surveillance. In 2011 the FBI tracked down Antoine Jones's GPS devices, without a search warrant. Later the Federal Appeal Court rejected the FBI's surveillance data as evidence against Antoine Jones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=ASSOCIATED PRESS|title=New privacy fears as police could track your GPS without a warrant |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2059001/GPS-Privacy-Issues-Fears-police-track-GPS-warrant.html#axzz2KaG9bNlY |newspaper=MAIL ONLINE |date=9 November 2011 |accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GPS devices are also used by [[private investigator]]s to give more information to their clients. They will plant their own GPS devices to learn about their target. Moreover, some [[rental car]] services use the same technique to prevent their customers from going out of their targeted area. They charge additional fees for those who violate their rules. They get this information from the car's GPS devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yamshon|first=Leah|title=GPS: A Stalker's Best Friend|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/188274/gps_a_stalkers_best_friend.html|publisher=PCWorld|accessdate=12 February 2013|date=10 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[architecture]] or [[structural engineering]], a '''girt''' is a horizontal structural member in a framed [[wall]]. Girts provide lateral support to the wall panel, primarily, to resist wind loads.

May also be known as a sheeting rail.

A comparable element in roof construction is a [[purlin]].

==Stability in steel building construction==
The girt is commonly used as a stabilizing element to the primary structure (e.g. column, post). Wall cladding fastened to the girt, or a discrete bracing system which includes the girt, can provide shear resistance, in the plane of the wall, along the length of the primary member. Since the girts are normally fastened to, or near, the exterior flange of a column, stability braces may be installed at a girt to resist rotation of the unsupported, inner flange of the primary member. The girt system must be competent and adequately stiff to provide the required stabilizing resistance in addition to its role as a wall panel support.

Girts are stabilized by (sag) rods/angles/straps and by the wall cladding. Stabilizing rods are discrete brace members to prevent rotation of an unsupported flange of the girt. Sheet metal wall panels are usually considered to provide lateral bracing to the connected, typically exterior flange along the length of the girt. Under restricted circumstances,&lt;ref&gt;North American Specification for the Design of Cold-Formed Steel Structural Members&lt;/ref&gt; sheet metal wall panels are also capable of providing rotational restraint to the girt section.

In general: Girt supports panel, panel stabilizes girt; Column supports girt, girt stabilizes column. The building designer should be knowledgeable in the complexities of this interactive design condition to ensure competent design of the complete structure.

An article of clothing: Reference to wearing a girt and having to bleach it often was made by British soldiers during World War II.

'''Glitching''' is an activity in which a person finds and exploits flaws or [[glitch#Video game glitches|glitches]] in [[video game]]s to achieve something that was not intended by the game designers. Gamers who engage in this practice are known as glitchers. Glitches can help or disable the player.

"Glitching" is also used to describe the state of a video game undergoing a glitch. The frequency in which a game undergoes glitching is often used by reviewers when examining the overall gameplay,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rr.ps2.ign.com/rrview/ps2/espn_college_hoops_2k5/683882/23375/ |title=ESPN College Hoops 2K5 Review |accessdate=2008-06-29 |last=ethikal1 |date=February 8, 2005 |work= |publisher=IGN |quote=Fun, until it started glitching |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211163143/http://rr.ps2.ign.com/rrview/ps2/espn_college_hoops_2k5/683882/23375/ |archivedate=February 11, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or specific game aspects such as graphics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.psx.ign.com/articles/064/064422p1.html |title=Tekken 3 vs. The Rest |accessdate=2008-06-29 |last=IGN Staff |date=March 13, 1998 |work= |publisher=IGN |quote=GRAPHICS, Bloody Roar: Solid graphics, little glitching |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211163311/http://uk.psx.ign.com/articles/064/064422p1.html |archivedate=February 11, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some games such as [[Metroid (video game)|Metroid]] have lower review scores today because in retrospect, the game may be very prone to glitches and be below what would be acceptable today.

Video game glitches that go "out of bounds" are mostly performed by either moving through walls or corners or jumping to places in the [[Level (computer and video games)|map]] that do not have [[invisible wall]]s. For example, in ''[[Tony Hawk's Underground 2]]'', in the L.A. level there is a glitch that can allow players to leave the provided play area and pass through the background.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gamefaqs.com/gamecube/920662-tony-hawks-underground-2/faqs/55792&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of this is a glitch on the [[Nürburgring]] track in [[Gran Turismo 5]] where if the player squeezes through any gap between the walls, the car can drive through the scenery and under the paved course and can finish a lap or the race faster than usual by driving directly under the finish line in the direction of the race's path.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} Another example in the [[Need for Speed]] series is [[Need for Speed: World]]. In Rockport there is a spot where you can glitch in Point Camden near Bay Bridge.{{clarify|date=January 2015}}{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}

In "out of bounds" areas, many maps have hollow objects that the player can move through freely. These objects usually are in the distance and are for decoration. The floor or terrain can also be hollow. The floor can appear the same as a normal floor, but moving over it will cause the player to fall as if it does not exist. Depending on the game, after falling a certain distance the player will freeze, die, respawn on the map again or just keep falling. Two good examples are the [[Nintendo 64]] games ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time]]'' and ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask]]''. In the former, there is a section of "wall" at the entrance to the water temple that will allow players to fall through the ground. Eventually players respawn rather than the game crashing. In the latter, there is a 3-day cycle (after which the moon will fall) that can be surpassed by going to the observatory and looking out the telescope on the last minutes of the final day. If you look out the telescope while the timer is counting down and exit the telescope when the timer hits 0, (if you're lucky) the timer will be gone and you can continue the game without it. The glitch is removed when you play the Song of Time.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Many other glitches may also include background music being played at the time it was not intended to play, such as the Western ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' (based on the Japan-only game ''[[Doki Doki Panic]]'') has a glitch where the Subspace music ([[Super Mario Bros. theme|the Overworld background music]] from the original ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'') can be played outside of Subspace after the player becomes invincible and enters Subspace and leaves before invincibility drains away (this was fixed for ''[[Super Mario All-Stars]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Advance]]'' so Subspace music can only be played in Subspace). One of the best known examples for glitching in an online game is [[Grand Theft Auto: IV]], where people can glitch into rooms they're not supposed to, or get under the map (for example by glitching a helicopter to spawn under the map and fly into beta rooms). [[Transformers: War for Cybertron]] is also known for glitching and [[hacker (programmer subculture)|hacking]]. Glitching Players are able to edit the classes far beyond regular players.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} The two almost make the game unplayable because of the cheating from the glitching and hacking.

Some games you can take advantage of the programmers only assuming that you will have positive values for things like money and when a negative value is acquired you can then get near-unlimited money. An example of this is in FIFA 11 where if you have a player on loan and no money left in the transfer budget, you can cancel the contract and the game will not check for a negative value. Once the loan is cancelled, the money is subtracted from the player resulting in a negative money value that then overflows back to the top of the positive value possibilities, resulting in the player having near the highest amount of money possible.

There are also physics glitches, such as the glitch with the swingset in ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'', where if the player climbs on top of the swingset, the shaking of its chains will cause the physics to oversell the impact and send the player flying a great distance away. Similarly in GTA III, if the player stands in a gate or is in a car (but still aligned within in a gate) and the gate is closed, the player character will be flung a great distance.

Some glitches occur randomly, as with a glitch in [[NCAA Football 11]] which will cause the football game to run longer than the time indicated on the clock and, most often, indefinitely.

The '''Homeostat''' is one of the first devices capable of adapting itself to the environment; it exhibited behaviours such as habituation, reinforcement and learning through its ability to maintain [[homeostasis]] in a changing environment. It was built by [[William Ross Ashby]] in 1948 at [[Barnwood House Hospital]]. After a few technical hiccups with short-circuits causing burn-outs, the homeostat was finally completed on the 16th March, 1948.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashby.de/rossashby.info/journal/page/2435.html The W. Ross Ashby Digital Archive, Journals, vol.11, p2435.]&lt;/ref&gt; It was an adaptive ultrastable system, consisting of four interconnected [[Royal Air Force]] bomb control units&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashby.de/rossashby.info/journal/page/2432+01.html Homeostat description and circuit diagram on pages 2431-2 of Ashby's journal], The W. Ross Ashby Digital Archive.&lt;/ref&gt; with inputs, [[feedback]], and magnetically driven, water-filled [[potentiometers]]. It illustrated his law of requisite variety&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a908384398~db=all~jumptype=rss The Homeostat as embodiment of adaptive control], Peter A. Cariani.&lt;/ref&gt; — automatically adapting its configuration to stabilize the effects of any disturbances introduced into the system.

In 1946, Ashby described the design of the units thus "Its principle is that it uses multiple coils in a milliammeter &amp; uses the needle movement to dip in a trough carrying a current, so getting a potential which goes to the grid of a valve, the anode of which provides an output current."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashby.de/rossashby.info/journal/page/2094.html Description of the Homeostat's unit from Ashby's journal page 2094] The W. Ross Ashby Digital Archive.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was the realization of what he had described in 1946 as an "[[Isomorphism]] making machine".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashby.de/rossashby.info/biography.html#homeostat Biography of W. Ross Ashby: The Homeostat and newspaper articles about it], by Jill Ashby, The W. Ross Ashby Digital Archive.&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Alan Turing]] heard of Ashby's intention to build the Homeostat, he wrote to Ashby to suggest that he could run a simulation on Turing's [[Automatic Computing Engine]] (ACE) instead of building a special machine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashby.de/rossashby.info/letters/turing.html Alan Turing letter] The W. Ross Ashby Digital Archive.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first published account of the homeostat appeared under the title of "Design for a Brain" in the December 1948 issue of 'Electronic Engineering',&lt;ref&gt;W.R. Ashby, Design for a Brain, Electronic Engineering, 20, 379-383, December 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; where he speculates about a perfected homeostat that could eventually play chess "with a subtlety and depth of strategy beyond that of the man who designed it."

In 1949 ''Time'' described it as "the closest thing to a synthetic brain so far designed by man".&lt;ref&gt;The thinking machine, ''Time'', 24 January 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, Ashby demonstrated it at the ninth [[Macy conference]] on [[cybernetics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cogs.susx.ac.uk/users/inmanh/beer-com2.pdf Decisions and noise: the scope of evolutionary synthesis and dynamical analysis], Ezequiel A. Di Paolo and Inman Harvey.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year he published a description of the Homeostat in his influential book ''[[Design for a brain]]''. In total, between 1946 and 1967, he wrote 38 entries about the Homeostat in his journal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashby.de/rossashby.info/journal/index/thumbs/homeostat.html Ashby's journal references to the Homeostat] The W.

In communications and [[electronic engineering]], an '''intermediate frequency''' ('''IF''') is a [[frequency]] to which a [[carrier wave]] is shifted as an intermediate step in [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] or reception.&lt;ref name=Smith46/&gt; The intermediate frequency is created by mixing the carrier signal with a [[local oscillator]] signal in a process called [[heterodyning]], resulting in a signal at the difference or [[beat frequency]].   Intermediate frequencies are used in [[Superheterodyne receiver|superheterodyne]] [[radio receiver]]s, in which an incoming signal is shifted to an IF for [[Amplifier|amplification]] before final [[Detector (radio)|detection]] is done.

Conversion to an intermediate frequency is useful for several reasons. When several stages of filters are used, they can all be set to a fixed frequency, which makes them easier to build and to tune. Lower frequency transistors generally have higher gains so fewer stages are required.  It's easier to make sharply selective filters at lower fixed frequencies.

There may be several such stages of intermediate frequency in a superheterodyne receiver; two or three stages are called  ''double'' (alternatively, ''dual'') or ''triple'' ''conversion'', respectively.

==Reasons for using IF==
Intermediate frequencies are used for three general reasons.&lt;ref name="ArmyManual"&gt;{{cite book

 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; At very high ([[gigahertz]]) frequencies, signal processing circuitry performs poorly. Active devices such as [[transistor]]s cannot deliver much amplification ([[Gain (electronics)|gain]]).&lt;ref name="Smith46"&gt;F. Langford Smith (ed) ''[[Radiotron Designer's Handbook]]'', 3rd Edition (Wireless Press 1946) Page 99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The 1946 ''[[Radiotron Designer's Handbook]]'' observes on page 159 that some short-wave receivers operate with an IF of 1600 kHz and that "At such a high frequency one or two additional IF stages are required are necessary to provide sufficient gain."&lt;/ref&gt;  Ordinary circuits using [[capacitor]]s and [[inductor]]s must be replaced with cumbersome high frequency techniques such as [[stripline]]s and [[waveguide]]s. So a high frequency signal is converted to a lower IF for more convenient processing.  For example, in [[satellite dish]]es, the microwave downlink signal received by the dish is converted to a much lower IF at the dish, to allow a relatively inexpensive [[coaxial cable]] to carry the signal to the receiver inside the building.  Bringing the signal in at the original microwave frequency would require an expensive [[waveguide]].

A second reason, in receivers that can be tuned to different frequencies, is to convert the various different frequencies of the stations to a common frequency for processing. It is difficult to build multistage [[amplifier]]s, [[Electronic filter|filters]], and [[detector (radio)|detector]]s that can have all stages track in tuning different frequencies, but it is comparatively easy to build tunable [[Electronic oscillator|oscillators]]. Superheterodyne receivers tune in different frequencies by adjusting the frequency of the local oscillator on the input stage, and all processing after that is done at the same fixed frequency, the IF.   Without using an IF, all the complicated filters and detectors in a radio or television would have to be tuned in unison each time the frequency  was changed, as was necessary in the early [[tuned radio frequency receiver]]s.   A more important advantage is that it gives the receiver a constant bandwidth over its tuning range.  The bandwidth of a filter is proportional to its center frequency.  In receivers like the TRF in which the filtering is done at the incoming RF frequency, as the receiver is tuned to higher frequencies its bandwidth increases.

The main reason for using an intermediate frequency is to improve frequency [[Selectivity (electronic)|selectivity]].&lt;ref name="Smith46" /&gt; In communication circuits, a very common task is to separate out or extract signals or components of a signal that are close together in frequency. This is called [[Filter (signal processing)|filtering]]. Some examples are, picking up a radio station among several that are close in frequency, or extracting the [[chrominance]] subcarrier from a TV signal. With all known filtering techniques the filter's [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] increases proportionately with the  frequency. So a narrower bandwidth and more selectivity can be achieved by converting the signal to a lower IF and performing the filtering at that frequency.  [[FM broadcasting|FM]] and [[television broadcasting]] with their narrow channel widths, as well as more modern telecommunications services such as [[cell phone]]s and [[cable television]], would be impossible without using frequency conversion.&lt;ref name="Dixon"&gt;{{cite book

==Uses==
Perhaps the most commonly used intermediate frequencies for broadcast receivers are around 455&amp;nbsp;kHz for AM receivers and 10.7&amp;nbsp;MHz for FM receivers. In special purpose receivers other frequencies can be used. A dual-conversion receiver may have two intermediate frequencies, a higher one to improve image rejection and a second, lower one, for desired selectivity. A first intermediate frequency may even be higher than the input signal, so that all undesired responses can be easily filtered out by a fixed-tuned RF stage.&lt;ref name=ARRL77&gt;Wes Hayward, Doug De Maw (ed),''Solid state design for the radio amateur'', (American Radio Relay League, 1977) pp. 82-87&lt;/ref&gt;

In a digital receiver, the analog to digital converter ([[analog to digital converter|ADC]]) operates at low sampling rates, so input RF must be mixed down to IF to be processed. Intermediate frequency tends to be lower frequency range compared to the transmitted RF frequency.   However, the choices for the IF are most dependent on the available components such as mixer, filters, amplifiers and others that can operate at lower frequency. There are other factors involved in deciding the IF frequency, because lower IF is susceptible to noise and higher IF can cause clock jitters.

Modern [[satellite television]] receivers use several intermediate frequencies.&lt;ref name="Lundstrom"&gt;{{cite book

The downlink signal is received by a [[satellite dish]].  In the box at the focus of the dish, called a [[low-noise block downconverter]] (LNB), each block of frequencies is converted to the IF range of 950 - 2150&amp;nbsp;MHz by two fixed frequency local oscillators at 9.75 and 10.6&amp;nbsp;GHz.  One of the two blocks is selected by a control signal from the set top box inside, which switches on one of the local oscillators.   This IF is carried into the building to the television receiver on a coaxial cable.  At the cable company's [[set top box]], the signal is converted to a lower IF of 480&amp;nbsp;MHz for filtering, by a variable frequency oscillator.&lt;ref name="Lundstrom" /&gt;  This is sent through a 30&amp;nbsp;MHz bandpass filter, which selects the signal from one of the [[transponder]]s on the satellite, which carries several channels.  Further processing selects the channel desired, demodulates it and sends the signal to the television.

==History==

An intermediate frequency was first used in the superheterodyne radio receiver, invented by American scientist Major [[Edwin Armstrong]] in 1918, during [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2008-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A member of the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal Corps]], Armstrong was building radio [[direction finding]] equipment to track German military signals at the then-very high frequencies of 500 to 3500&amp;nbsp;kHz. The [[triode]] [[vacuum tube]] amplifiers of the day would not amplify stably above 500&amp;nbsp;kHz, however, it was easy to get them to [[Electronic oscillator|oscillate]] above that frequency.   Armstrong's solution was to set up an oscillator tube that would create a frequency near the incoming signal, and mix it with the incoming signal in a 'mixer' tube, creating a 'heterodyne' or signal at the lower difference frequency, where it could be amplified easily. For example, to pick up a signal at 1500&amp;nbsp;kHz the local oscillator would be tuned to 1450&amp;nbsp;kHz. Mixing the two created an intermediate frequency of 50&amp;nbsp;kHz, which was well within the capability of the tubes.

After the war, in 1920, Armstrong sold the patent for the superheterodyne to [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]], who subsequently sold it to [[RCA]]. The increased complexity of the superheterodyne circuit compared to earlier [[Regenerative receiver|regenerative]] or [[tuned radio frequency receiver]] designs slowed its use, but the advantages of the intermediate frequency for selectivity and static rejection eventually won out; by 1930, most radios sold were 'superhets'. During the development of [[radar]] in [[World War II]], the superheterodyne principle was essential for downconversion of the very high radar frequencies to intermediate frequencies. Since then, the superheterodyne circuit, with its intermediate frequency, has been used in virtually all radio receivers.

==Commonly used intermediate frequencies==
* 110&amp;nbsp;kHz was used in [[Long wave]] broadcast receivers.&lt;ref name="Smith46"/&gt;{{rp|159}}
*[[Analog transmission|Analogue]] television receivers using system M: 41.25&amp;nbsp;MHz (audio) and 45.75&amp;nbsp;MHz (video). Note, the channel is flipped over in the conversion process in an [[intercarrier method|intercarrier]] system, so the audio IF frequency is lower than the video IF frequency. Also, there is no audio local oscillator, the injected video carrier serves that purpose.
*[[Analog transmission|Analogue]] television receivers using system B and similar systems: 33.4&amp;nbsp;MHz. for aural and 38.9&amp;nbsp;MHz. for visual signal. (The discussion about the frequency conversion is the same as in system M).
*[[FM radio]] receivers: 262&amp;nbsp;kHz, 455&amp;nbsp;kHz, 1.6&amp;nbsp;MHz, 5.5&amp;nbsp;MHz, 10.7&amp;nbsp;MHz, 10.8&amp;nbsp;MHz, 11.2&amp;nbsp;MHz, 11.7&amp;nbsp;MHz, 11.8&amp;nbsp;MHz, 21.4&amp;nbsp;MHz, 75&amp;nbsp;MHz and 98&amp;nbsp;MHz. In double-conversion superheterodyne receivers, a first intermediate frequency of 10.7&amp;nbsp;MHz is often used, followed by a second intermediate frequency of 470&amp;nbsp;kHz. There are triple conversion designs used in police scanner receivers, high-end communications receivers, and many point-to-point microwave systems. Modern DSP chip consumer radios often use a 'low-IF' of 128kHz for FM.
*[[AM radio]] receivers: 450&amp;nbsp;kHz, 455&amp;nbsp;kHz, 460&amp;nbsp;kHz, 465&amp;nbsp;kHz, 467&amp;nbsp;kHz, 470&amp;nbsp;kHz, 475&amp;nbsp;kHz, 480&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref&gt;Ravalico D. E., ''Radioelementi'', Milan, Hoepli, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Satellite [[uplink]]-[[downlink]] equipment: 70&amp;nbsp;MHz, 950–1450&amp;nbsp;MHz (L-band) downlink first IF.
*Terrestrial [[microwave]] equipment: 250&amp;nbsp;MHz, 70&amp;nbsp;MHz or 75&amp;nbsp;MHz.
*[[Radar]]: 30&amp;nbsp;MHz.
*[[Radio frequency|RF]] Test Equipment: 310.7&amp;nbsp;MHz, 160&amp;nbsp;MHz, 21.4&amp;nbsp;MHz.

'''Internally grooved copper tubes''' also known as "microfin tubes" are a small diameter coil technology for modern air conditioning and refrigeration systems. Grooved coils facilitate more efficient [[heat transfer]] than smooth coils.&lt;ref&gt;Cotton, Nigel (2012). “COOL TECHNOLOGY: Small copper tubes make a big impact on air-conditioner efficiency,” ''Machine Design'', August 23; http://machinedesign.com/news/cool-technology-small-copper-tubes-make-big-impact-air-conditioner-efficiency/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weed, Robert and Hipchen, John (2011). “Benefits of Reduced Diameter Copper Tubes in Evaporators and Condensers,” ASHRAE Annual Conference, Montreal, Quebec Canada, June 25–29; http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Benefits+of+reduced+diameter+copper+tubes+in+evaporators+and...-a0272754902&lt;/ref&gt; Small diameter coils have better rates of heat transfer than conventional-sized [[condenser coil|condenser]] and [[evaporator]] coils with round copper tubes and aluminium or copper fin that have been the standard in the [[HVAC]] industry for many years. Small diameter coils can withstand higher pressures required by the new generation of environmentally friendlier refrigerants. They have lower material costs because they require less refrigerant, fin, and coil materials. And they enable the design of smaller and lighter high-efficiency air conditioners and refrigerators because the evaporators and condensers coils are smaller and lighter.

The performance benefits of copper as a heat transfer material include its high heat exchange properties, long-term durability, resistance to corrosion, low maintenance cost, and antimicrobial properties.

With MicroGroove technology, heat transfer is enhanced by grooving the inside surface of the tube. This increases the surface to volume ratio, mixes the [[refrigerant]], and [[homogenize]]s refrigerant temperatures across the tube.&lt;ref&gt;Cotton,Nigel (2013). Building Better Appliances with Smaller-Diameter Copper Tubes, ''International Appliance Manufacturing'', October 23; http://www.appliancedesign.com/articles/93807-building-better-appliances-with-smaller-diameter-copper-tubes&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hipchen, John (2010). “Small Tubes of Copper in ACR Applications," Webinar presented by ''ACHR News and Appliance Design.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ding, Guoliang ''et. al'' (2010). “Condensation Heat Transfer Characteristic of R410A-oil Mixture Inside Small Diameter Smooth Copper Tubes,” ''ASME-ATI-UIT Conference on Thermal and Environmental Issues in Energy Systems'', Sorrento, Italy, May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ding, Guoliang ''et. al'' (2010). “Two-phase Heat Transfer Characteristics of R410A-oil Mixture Flow Condensation Inside Small Diameter Microfin Copper Tubes,” ''Conference on Thermal and Environmental Issues in Energy Systems'', Sorrento, Italy, May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tubes with MicroGroove technology can be made with copper or aluminium. Copper fins are an attractive alternative to aluminium due to the better corrosion resistance of copper and its antimicrobial benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2013 | title = Exploring the wonderful world of antimicrobial coils | url = | journal = Air Conditioning &amp; Refrigeration News | volume = 29 | issue = 13| page = 34 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 19943884 | doi=10.1111/j.1472-765X.2009.02753.x | volume=50 | title=Potential for preventing spread of fungi in air-conditioning systems constructed using copper instead of aluminium | date=January 2010 | journal=Lett.

==Design==
To use smaller tubes instead of conventional-sized tubes in air conditioners, heat exchangers must be redesigned. This includes redesigning the fin and tube circuits.&lt;ref&gt;Principle of Designing Fin-and-Tube Heat Exchanger With Smaller Tubes for Air Conditioner

http://www.conftool.com/2012Purdue/index.php?page=browseSessions&amp;abstracts=show&amp;mode=list&amp;search=2223&lt;/ref&gt; Design optimization requires the use of computational fluid dynamics to analyze airflow around the tubes and fins, as well as computer simulations of refrigerant flow and temperatures inside the tubes. This is important because the overall heat transfer coefficient of a coil is a function of the [[convection]] of the [[refrigerant]] inside the tube to the tube wall, conduction through the tube wall, and dissipation through the fins.&lt;ref&gt;Ding, G.L., Ren,T., Zheng, Y.X., and Gao,Y.F.

Published experiments on MicroGroove coil performance and energy efficiency take into account the effects of fin spacing and fin design, tube diameter, and tube circuitry.&lt;ref&gt;G.L. Ding et al. (YEAR), 23rd IIR International Congress of Refrigeration, Prague, August 23–26.&lt;/ref&gt; Tube circuitry is substantially different than for conventional coils. Coils should be optimized with respect to the number of paths between the inlet and outlet manifolds. Typically, smaller diameter tubes require more paths of shorter lengths. Published research on tube circuitry&lt;ref&gt;Wei-kun Ding et al. (Xi’an and ICA) "Development of Small-diameter Tube Heat Exchanger: Circuit Design and Performance Simulation," presented at the Conference on Thermal and Environmental Issues in Energy Systems, Sorrento, Italy, May 2010 (CTEI-ES 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; and fin design for heat exchangers made with 4&amp;nbsp;mm tubes&lt;ref&gt;Ju-fang Fan et al.; "Development of Small-diameter Tube Heat Exchanger: Fin Design and Performance Research," presented at CTEI-ES 2010&lt;/ref&gt; are available.

Research on a heat exchanger redesign with 5-mm diameter tubes demonstrated a 5% greater heat exchange capacity than that of the same size heat exchanger with 7-mm diameter tubes. Also, the refrigerant charge of the 5-mm diameter tubes was less than the 7-mm diameter tubes.&lt;ref&gt;Principle of Designing Fin-and-Tube Heat Exchanger With Smaller Tubes for Air Conditioner; Wei Wu, Guoliang Ding, Yongxin Zheng, Yifeng Gao, Ji Song; International Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Conference at Purdue, July 16–19, 2012; http://www.conftool.com/2012Purdue/index.php?page=browseSessions&amp;abstracts=show&amp;mode=list&amp;search=2223&lt;/ref&gt; In China, Chigo, Gree, and Kelon are producing air conditioners with coils that have 5-mm diameter tubes.&lt;ref&gt;Cool Technology: Small copper tubes make a big impact on air conditioner efficiency; MachineDesign.com; August 23, 2012; http://machinedesign.com/article/cool-technology-small-copper-tubes-make-a-big-impact-on-air-conditioner-efficiency-0823?page=0%2C3&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of fin designs have been developed for use with small-diameter copper tubes. The performance of slotted and louvered fin designs have been evaluated and compared as a function of various fin dimensions. Simulations have been used to optimize fin design performance.&lt;ref&gt;Ju-fang Fan, Wei-kun Ding, Wen-quan  Tao, Wenson Zheng, Frank Gao, and Kerry Song; Development of small-diameter tube heat exchanger: Fin design and performance research.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Refrigerants==
The phasing out of [[Chlorofluorocarbon|CFC]] and [[HCFC]] refrigerants (e.g., [[HCFC-22]], also known as [[Chlorodifluoromethane|R22]]) due to [[global warming]] concerns  has helped to spur innovations in cooling technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Shabtay, Yoram, Black, J. and Kraft, Frank (2014).  New Copper-based Heat Exchangers for Alternative Refrigerants, ''Fifteenth International Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Conference;'' Purdue Conferences in West Lafayette, Indiana; Paper 1532; https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/iracc/1532/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Microgroove™ Update Newsletter: Volume 2, Issue 1, January 2012: http://www.microgroove.net/sites/default/files/4600_microgroove_nl_jan2012_2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Natural refrigerants such as [[carbon dioxide]] ([[R744]]) and [[propane]] ([[Propane|R290]]), as well as R-410A, have become attractive replacements for [[air conditioning]] and [[refrigeration]] applications.

Higher pressures are typically required to condense these new environmentally friendly refrigerants compared to those that are being phased out. Small diameter copper tubes are more desirable in applications with higher pressures. For tubes of the same thickness, smaller diameter tubes can withstand higher pressures than larger diameter tubes.&lt;ref&gt;Cotton,Nigel (2013). Building Better Appliances with Smaller-Diameter Copper Tubes, ''International Appliance Manufacturing'', October 23; http://www.appliancedesign.com/articles/93807-building-better-appliances-with-smaller-diameter-copper-tubes&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hipchen, John (2010). “Small Tubes of Copper in ACR Applications," Webinar presented by ''ACHR News and Appliance Design.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ding, Guoliang ''et. al'' (2010). “Condensation Heat Transfer Characteristic of R410A-oil Mixture Inside Small Diameter Smooth Copper Tubes,” ''ASME-ATI-UIT Conference on Thermal and Environmental Issues in Energy Systems'', Sorrento, Italy, May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ding, Guoliang ''et. al'' (2010). “Two-phase Heat Transfer Characteristics of R410A-oil Mixture Flow Condensation Inside Small Diameter Microfin Copper Tubes,” ''Conference on Thermal and Environmental Issues in Energy Systems'', Sorrento, Italy, May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;FAQs: Thirty Questions with Answers about Economical, Eco-friendly Copper Tubes for Air Conditioner Applications; http://www.microgroove.net/sites/default/files/overview-ica-questions-and-answers-qa30.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, as tube diameters decrease, burst pressures increase. This is because working pressure is directly proportional to wall thickness and inversely proportional to diameter. By designing coils with shorter tube lengths, less work is required to circulate the refrigerant. Therefore, refrigerant pressure drop factors due to small diameter tubes can be offset.

Carbon dioxide (R744) refrigerants are used in modern [[vending machine]]s, refrigerated [[supermarket]] display cases, [[ice-skating rink]]s, and other emerging applications.&lt;ref&gt;Microgroove™ Update Newsletter: Volume 1, Issue 3, December 2011: http://www.microgroove.net/sites/default/files/4473_ica_microgroove_nl_final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Filippini S., Merlo U. (2011). Air Cooled Heat Exchangers For CO2 Refrigeration Cycles; ''23rd IIR International Congress of Refrigeration;'' Prague, Czech Republic; July; Paper 2232.&lt;/ref&gt; Microgroove’s smaller diameter copper tubes have the strength to withstand the very high gas cooler and burst pressures of [[R744]] while allowing for lower overall refrigerant volumes.&lt;ref&gt;"Natural Refrigerant CO2," a handbook edited by Walter Reulens, ATMOsphere 2009. Compressors are described in Section 8.1 (pp. 348-382) and heat exchangers are described in section 8.2 (pp. 383-410) of the Handbook, available online free of charge as a PDF here: www.atmosphere2009.com/files/NaReCO2-handbook-2009.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Propane ([[Propane|R290]]) is an eco-friendly refrigerant with outstanding [[thermodynamic]] propertiies.&lt;ref&gt;Ding, Guoliang ''et. al,'' (2012). Developing Low Charge R290 Room Air Conditioner By Using Smaller Diameter Copper Tubes, ''10th IIR Gustav Lorentzen Conference on Natural Refrigerants;'' Delft, The Netherlands; Paper 183&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Microgroove™ Update Newsletter: Volume 1, Issue 3, December 2011: http://www.microgroove.net/sites/default/files/4473_ica_microgroove_nl_final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The pressure requirements for R290 are much less than for carbon dioxide, but R290 is extremely flammable. Research has demonstrated that MicroGroove is suitable for R290-charged room air conditioners because the refrigerant charge requirement is dramatically reduced with smaller diameter copper tubes. The risk of tube explosions is dramatically reduced as well.&lt;ref&gt;"Principle of Designing Fin-And-Tube Heat Exchanger with Smaller Diameter Tubes for Air Conditioner" by Wei Wu, Guoliang Ding, Yongxin Zheng, Yifeng Gao and Ji Song, The Fourteenth International Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Conference, Purdue University, July 2012; http://www.conftool.com/2012Purdue/index.php?page=browseSessions&amp;abstracts=show&amp;mode=list&amp;search=2223&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Read also:  "Developing Low Charge R290 Room Air Conditioner by Using Smaller Diameter Copper Tubes" by Guoliang Ding, Wei Wu, Tao Ren, Yongxin Zheng, Yifeng Gao, Ji Song, Zhongmin Liu and Shaokai Chen; The Tenth IIR Gustav Lorentzen Conference on Natural Refrigerants, June 2012 (GLC)&lt;/ref&gt; Research conducted with [[propane]] in MicroGroove has implications for heat exchanger coils used in [[refrigerators]], [[heat pumps]] and commercial [[air conditioning]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;Professor Guoliang Ding of Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) Presents New Research on Smaller Diameter Copper Tubes at the Tenth IIR Gustav Lorentzen Conference on Natural Refrigerants; June 26, 2012; http://www.microgroove.net/press/professor-guoliang-ding-shanghai-jiao-tong-university-sjtu-presents-new-research-smaller-diame&lt;/ref&gt;

==Weight savings==
In a design study of functionally equivalent 5-kW [[HVAC]] heat exchangers, tube materials in the coils weighed 3.09&amp;nbsp;kg for 9.52-mm diameter tube, 2.12&amp;nbsp;kg for 7-mm diameter tube, and 1.67&amp;nbsp;kg for 5-mm diameter tube. Tube weight was reduced by 31% when copper tube diameters were downsized from 3/8 inch to 7&amp;nbsp;mm. Tube weight was reduced by 46% when copper tube diameters were downsized from 3/8 inch to 5&amp;nbsp;mm. The weights of the fin materials in the coils was 3.55&amp;nbsp;kg for the 9.52&amp;nbsp;mm coils, 2.61&amp;nbsp;kg for the 7&amp;nbsp;mm coils, and 1.55&amp;nbsp;kg for the 5&amp;nbsp;mm coils.&lt;ref&gt;Cotton,Nigel (2013). Building Better Appliances with Smaller-Diameter Copper Tubes, ''International Appliance Manufacturing'', October 23; http://www.appliancedesign.com/articles/93807-building-better-appliances-with-smaller-diameter-copper-tubes&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hipchen, John (2010). “Small Tubes of Copper in ACR Applications," Webinar presented by ''ACHR News and Appliance Design.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ding, Guoliang ''et. al'' (2010). “Condensation Heat Transfer Characteristic of R410A-oil Mixture Inside Small Diameter Smooth Copper Tubes,” ''ASME-ATI-UIT Conference on Thermal and Environmental Issues in Energy Systems'', Sorrento, Italy, May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ding, Guoliang ''et. al'' (2010). “Two-phase Heat Transfer Characteristics of R410A-oil Mixture Flow Condensation Inside Small Diameter Microfin Copper Tubes,” ''Conference on Thermal and Environmental Issues in Energy Systems'', Sorrento, Italy, May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;FAQs: Thirty Questions with Answers about Economical, Eco-friendly Copper Tubes for
Air Conditioner Applications; http://www.microgroove.net/sites/default/files/overview-ica-questions-and-answers-qa30.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antimicrobial==
Copper is an [[antimicrobial]] material. Bio buildup can be reduced with copper coils. This helps to maintain high levels of energy efficiency for longer periods of time and avoids energy efficiency drop off over time.

The use of copper coils to inhibit the growth of [[fungi]] and [[bacteria]] is a recent development in innovative air conditioning and refrigeration products. [[OEM]] companies, such as Chigo in China and Hydronic in France, are now manufacturing all-copper antimicrobial air conditioning systems to improve indoor air quality.&lt;ref&gt;Microgroove™ Update Newsletter: Volume 2, Issue 1, January 2012: http://www.microgroove.net/sites/default/files/4600_microgroove_nl_jan2012_2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Materials==
Smaller diameter refrigerant paths can also be realized with extruded aluminium tubes. These have been designed with several microchannels in one flat, ribbon-like tube. Aluminium microchannel technology offers significant advantages over conventional copper-aluminium round tube plate fin coil, including improved heat transfer performance and reduced refrigerant charge.&lt;ref&gt;Q&amp;A: Microchannel air-cooled condenser; Heatcraft Worldwide Refrigeration; April 2011; http://www.heatcraftrpd.com/landing/2011/air-cooled-condenser/res/pdfs/H-ACCMCX-QA.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
However, copper MicroGroove offers higher heat transfer efficiencies than aluminium microchannel tubes and it enables smaller refrigerant volumes because the tube ends of MicroGroove are connected by small U-joints rather than large headers.&lt;ref&gt;Filippini, S., (2010). A new heat exchanger geometry for next condenser generation with ultra low refrigerant charge; ''IIR Second Workshop on Refrigerant Charge Reduction Conference;'' Stockholm, Sweden; June.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacturing==
Copper tubes are often produced by a cast and roll process. Copper [[ingot]]s are cast into mother tubes and these tubes are then drawn to a final shape, [[annealing (metallurgy)|annealed]], and enhanced with an inner surface texture to improve heat transfer performance. The production of small diameter copper tubes requires only the addition of one or two additional drawing passes to achieve 5-mm tube diameters.&lt;ref&gt;Cotton, Nigel (2014).

The equipment used in manufacturing Microgroove products expands the tubes circumferentially (i.e., the circumference of the tube is increased without changing the length). This "non-shrinkage" expansion allows for better control of tube lengths in preparation for subsequent assembly operations. Tubes are inserted, or laced, into the holes in a stack of precisely spaced fins. Expanders are inserted into the tubes and the tube diameters are increased slightly until mechanical contact is achieved between the tubes and fins. The high ductility of copper allows for this process to be performed accurately and precisely. Heat exchanger coils made in this manner have excellent durability and heat transfer properties.&lt;ref&gt;Cotton, Nigel (2013).

==Manhattan Project==
From 1944-1947 Howland served in the [[Armed Forces]]. In 1944 he joined the [[Manhattan Project]] of the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Corps of Engineers]], which had started to develop a fission bomb. He served as [[medical officer]] in charge of special problems. This opportunity allowed him to become one of the early authorities on the medical effects of [[Ionizing radiation|radiation exposure]]. Howland designed [[toxicity]] [[experiments]] and established [[occupational standards]] and emergency procedures.
In 1945 he was assigned to [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]] as Assistant Chief of Medical Research for the [[Manhattan Project]]. He organized the information from the [[Manhattan Project]]'s laboratories and work sites. Howland organized the parties that went to [[Japan]] to analyze the effects of [[radiation poisoning]], and served as chief [[internist]]-[[pathologist]] to the [[Nagasaki]] group. This was the first American group to investigate the effects of [[radiation]] on the [[casualties]] at [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]]. The group was replaced by the [[U.S. Army]] team led by [[Stafford Warren]] which later became the [[Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;Papers of Joe Wiseman Howland. (1981). University of Rochester Medical Center, Edward G. Miner Library.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joe W. Howland. (1947). (Book).

In 1946 Howland was appointed Chief of Medical Research for the [[Manhattan District]] during the transition into the [[U.S. Atomic Energy Commission]]. In 1947 he was discharged with the rank of [[major]], and remained a [[consultant]] to the [[U.S. Atomic Energy Commission]].

===Atomic Energy Project===
Howland returned to Rochester. He was: "convinced that there was a future in atomic medicine." He advanced to [[Professor]] of Radiation Biology and Chief of the Medical Division of the [[Atomic Energy Project]] at the [[Medical School]].&lt;ref&gt;Ingram, M., Mason, W. B., WHIPPLE, G. H., &amp; Howland, J. W. (1952). Biological effects of ionizing radiation. University of Rochester Atomic Energy Project W-7401-erg-49. Report UR-196.&lt;/ref&gt;
From 1947-1965 Howland was Chief, [[Atomic Energy Project]] Medical Division, and supervised the health &amp; safety activities. He directed and conducted research into the [[pathologic]] [[physiology]] of exposure to [[ionizing radiation]], [[dosimetry]] of [[Ionizing radiation|radiation exposure]], effects of [[microwave]] irradiation, standards for [[radiation protection]] and the medical aspects of [[civil defense]].&lt;ref&gt;Papers Of Joe Wiseman Howland.

==The Lockport Incident==
On 8 March 1960 in [[Lockport, New York]] an accidental X-ray exposure was received by nine [[civilian]] [[radar]] [[technicians]] that worked at the [[Lockport Air Force Station]], a [[U.S. Air Force]] [[radar station]] that was part of the [[Semi-Automatic Ground Environment|SAGE]] [[SAGE radar stations|network]]. The recently installed [[Klystron]] tube failed to operate properly when voltage was applied. The technicians were exposed to [[X-rays]] while [[troubleshooting]] the problem. ('''NOTE:''' The Klystron tube serves as a voltage amplifier for the [[radar]] [[transmitter]].) The technicians made an error in judgment and thought that the Klystron tube would not produce X-rays when the machine was not producing a [[radiofrequency]] signal. The men were exposed for a two-hour period with the Klystron tube at 60 percent of full [[voltage]] with 150 [[KeV]] X-rays being produced at 90 mA [[Electric current|current]].&lt;ref&gt;Howland, J.

==Consultant==
Howland worked as a consultant to the [[Surgeon General]]'s Office, [[Walter Reed Army Institute of Research]], the [[Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute]], [[NASA]], the [[New York State Department of Health]], and the [[New York State Energy Research and Development Authority|New York State Office of Atomic and Space Development]].

==Medical Doctor and Author==
Howland was a prolific writer for medical and scientific journals. He also maintained a private [[medical practice]]. He was married and the father of four sons.
In 1973 Howland moved to [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]] and was Director of the North Carolina Alcoholic Rehabilitation Center at [[Butner, North Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;Howland, Richard W., and Joe W.

==Early life and education==
John Robert Huizenga was born on a farm near [[Fulton, Illinois]], the son of Henry (Harry) and Josie (Brands) Huizenga.&lt;ref name=ClintonObit/&gt;  He attended [[Erie High School (Illinois)|Erie High School]] and [[Morrison High School (Illinois)|Morrison High School]], graduating from the latter in 1940.  He continued his education at [[Calvin College]] in Michigan, from which he received a bachelor's degree in 1944.  He would maintain his ties to Calvin later in life, for example collaborating on fundamental nuclear research with his Calvin friend Roger Griffioen,&lt;ref name=GriffPaper&gt;For example, {{cite journal | last1=Griffioen | first1=R.D. | last2=Thompson | first2=R.C. | last3=Huizenga | first3=J.R. | title=Levels of 235Np excited by the 234U(3He, d) and 234U(alpha, t) reactions | journal=Physical Review C | volume=18 | year=1978 | pages=671–678|bibcode = 1978PhRvC..18..671G |doi = 10.1103/PhysRevC.18.671 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who had gone on to become a professor there.  Calvin would name him one of the college's Distinguished Alumni in 1975.&lt;ref name=CC-alum&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.calvin.edu/alumni/about/awards/daa_recipients.htm | title=Calvin Alumni Association Awards: Distinguished Alumni Award: Past Recipients | publisher=Calvin College Alumni Association | accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with other Calvin students, he was recruited after graduation to work for the [[Manhattan Project]], at the Project's site in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]] that was dedicated to the production of [[Enriched uranium#Highly enriched uranium (HEU)|highly enriched uranium]].  Following his time in Oak Ridge, he continued his education at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|University of Illinois]], receiving a Doctor of Philosophy degree in physical chemistry in 1949. On completing his studies he held joint appointments at the [[University of Chicago]] and [[Argonne National Laboratory]].&lt;ref name=UoRObit/&gt;

==Professional career==
During World War II, Huizenga supervised teams at the [[Manhattan Project]] in Oak Ridge, Tenn. involved in enriching uranium used in the atomic weapon dropped on Hiroshima in August 1945. During his Argonne years, as a result of examining debris from the "[[Ivy Mike]]" [[Nuclear weapons testing|nuclear test]] in 1952, Huizenga was part of the team that added two new [[Synthetic element|synthetic chemical elements]], [[einsteinium]] and [[fermium]], to the [[periodic table]].&lt;ref name=NYTBio/&gt;&lt;ref name=UoRObit/&gt;&lt;ref name = "ES_FM"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=[[Albert Ghiorso|Ghiorso]] | first1=A. | last2=Thompson | first2=S. | last3=Higgins | first3=G. | last4=[[Glenn T.

During his Argonne years he was one of the founders of the [[Gordon Research Conferences]] on [[nuclear chemistry]], serving as chairman of the nuclear chemistry Gordon Conference in 1958.&lt;ref name="GordConf"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.grc.org/conferences.aspx?id=0000181 | title=Conference Portfolio: Nuclear Chemistry | date= 2014 | website= | publisher=Gordon Research Conferences | accessdate= 30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in 1964 and took a sabbatical from Argonne to further his studies as a visiting professor at the [[University of Paris]] for the 1964-1965 academic year.

In 1967, he became a professor of chemistry and physics at the [[University of Rochester]] where he worked for the remainder of his career, apart from a second Guggenheim Fellowship that allowed him to engage in research during the 1973-1974 school year at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], the [[Technische Universität München]], and the [[Niels Bohr Institute]] in [[Copenhagen]].  His research interests at Rochester covered topics in [[nuclear structure]] of [[actinide]]s, [[nuclear fission]], and [[nuclear reaction]]s between heavy ions.  He was chairman of the Department of Chemistry from 1983 to 1988,&lt;ref name=UoRChemHist&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.chem.rochester.edu/about/resources/history.pdf | title=Chemistry at Rochester: 75th Anniversary of Graduate Education | editor=Debra Haring | date=October 2007 | publisher= The University of Rochester Chemistry Department | accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; retiring as Tracy H. Harris Professor (later Professor Emeritus) of Chemistry.

During Huizenga's time at Rochester, the university had its own [[particle accelerator]], a [[Van de Graaff generator|tandem Van de Graaff accelerator]] that produced beams of nuclei accelerated to energies of several [[Electronvolt|MeV]] per nucleon.  This facility, which opened in 1966,&lt;ref name="Gove"&gt;{{cite book |last= Gove |first= Harry E. |date= 1998|title= From Hiroshima to the Iceman: The Development and Applications of Accelerator Mass Spectrometry|publisher= CRC Press|page= 4|isbn= 0750305584}}&lt;/ref&gt; afforded him the opportunity to continue his research program in experimental nuclear science.  However, the limited beam energies available led him to more powerful accelerators, such as the [[SuperHILAC]] at Berkeley and the [[Los Alamos Neutron Science Center|Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility]], LAMPF, at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], for his experimental work.  His LAMPF proposal to study actinide [[Exotic atom|muonic atom]]s was one of the earliest experiments to receive beam time at the LAMPF stopped-muon facility.&lt;ref name="MWJ-muons"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Johnson | first=M.W. | last2=Schröder | first2=W.U. | last3=Huizenga | first3=J.R. | last4=Hensley | first4=W.K. | last5=Perry | first5=D.G. | last6=[[John C.

In 1989, Huizenga co-chaired, with [[Norman Foster Ramsey, Jr.|Norman Ramsey]], a panel convened by the [[United States Department of Energy]] which attempted to debunk claims by two [[University of Utah]] chemists that they had achieved [[Cold fusion|nuclear fusion at room temperature]].  The findings of the Huizenga/Ramsey panel, although highly skeptical of the reality of cold fusion, were cautious:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Based on the examination of published reports, reprints, numerous communications to the Panel and several site visits, the Panel concludes that the experimental results of excess heat from calorimetric cells reported to date do not present convincing evidence that useful sources of energy will result from the phenomena attributed to cold fusion. ...&amp;nbsp;The Panel concludes that the experiments reported to date do not present convincing evidence to associate the reported anomalous heat with a nuclear process.&amp;nbsp;...

Current understanding of the very extensive literature of experimental and theoretical results for hydrogen in solids gives no support for the occurrence of cold fusion in solids. Specifically, no theoretical or experimental evidence suggests the existence of D-D distances shorter than that in the molecule D2 or the achievement of "confinement" pressure above relatively modest levels. The known behavior of deuterium in solids does not give any support for the supposition that the fusion probability is enhanced by the presence of the palladium, titanium, or other elements.

Nuclear fusion at room temperature, of the type discussed in this report, would be contrary to all understanding gained of nuclear reactions in the last half century; it would require the invention of an entirely new nuclear process.&lt;ref name="ERAB-summary"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://files.ncas.org/erab/execsumm.htm | title=Executive Summary of the Energy Resources Advisory Board's Cold Fusion Panel | date=26 November 1989 | accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Huizenga later published a book titled "Cold Fusion: The Scientific Fiasco of the Century".&lt;ref name=NYTBio/&gt;&lt;ref name=UoRObit/&gt;

==Awards and honors==
Huizenga was elected to the [[National Academy of Sciences]] in 1976 and the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (Fellow) in 1992.  He was a 1966 recipient of the [[Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award]] bestowed by the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]].

==Personal life==
Huizenga married the former Dorothy (Dolly) Koeze in 1946.&lt;ref name=ClintonObit&gt;{{cite news|title=The life journey of Whiteside County native, John R. Huizenga

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They had two sons and two daughters.  Their son [[Robert Huizenga]] is a prominent physician whose career has included a stint as [[team physician]] for the [[Oakland Raiders#The Los Angeles era (1982–1994) and third world championship|Los Angeles Raiders]] American football team.  Dolly Huizenga died in 1999.

Following his retirement from Rochester, Huizenga and his wife moved to North Carolina, where he continued to serve on advisory committees at major accelerator laboratories, worked to debunk cold fusion, and wrote his memoirs.  He died of [[heart failure]] in San Diego, California in January 2014.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2894">In [[Combustion]], the '''Karlovitz number''' is defined as the ratio of chemical time scale &lt;math&gt;t_F&lt;/math&gt; to Kolmogorov time scale &lt;math&gt;t_\eta&lt;/math&gt;, named after [[Béla Karlovitz]].&lt;ref&gt;Peters, N. (2000). Turbulent combustion. Cambridge university press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Libby, P. A., &amp; Williams, F. A. (1980). Turbulent reacting flows. Turbulent reacting flows.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, F. A. (2018). Combustion theory. CRC Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The number reads as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Ka} = \frac{t_F}{t_\eta}&lt;/math&gt;.

In premixed turbulent combustion, the chemical time scale can be defined as &lt;math&gt;t_F = D_T/S_L^2&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;D_T&lt;/math&gt; is the [[thermal diffusivity]] and &lt;math&gt;S_L&lt;/math&gt; is the [[premixed flame|laminar flame speed]] and the flame thickness is given by &lt;math&gt;\delta_L = D_T/S_L&lt;/math&gt;, in which case,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Ka} = \frac{\delta_L^2}{\eta^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; is the Kolmogorov scale. The Karlovitz number is related to [[Damköhler numbers|Damköhler number]] as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Ka} = \frac{1}{\mathrm{Da}}&lt;/math&gt;

if the Damköhler number is defined with Kolmogorov scale. If &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Ka}&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;, the premixed turbulent flame falls into the category of corrugated flamelets and wrinked flamelets, otherwise into the thin reaction zone or broken reaction zone flames.

==Klimov-Williams criterion==
In premixed turbulent combustion, '''Klimov-Williams criterion''' or '''Klimov-Williams limit''' is the condition where &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Ka}=1&lt;/math&gt;, named after [[A.M. Klimov]]&lt;ref&gt;Klimov, A. M. (1963). Laminar ame in a turbulent ow. Zhur. Prikl. Mekh. Tekh. Fiz, 3, 4958.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klimov, A. M. (1988).

" A Review of Some Theoretical Considerations of Turbulent Flame Structure." in analytical Numerical Methods for Investigation of Flow Fields with Chemical Reactions, Especially Related Fields to Combustion. In AGARD Conference Proceedings, 1975 (Vol. 164).&lt;/ref&gt; When &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Ka}&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;, the flame thickness is smaller than the Kolmogorov scale, thus the flame burning velocity is not affected by the turbulence field. Here, the burning velocity is given by the [[premixed flame|laminar flame speed]] and these laminar flamelets are called as wrinkled flamelets or corrugated flamelets, depending on the turbulence intensity. When &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Ka}&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, the turbulent transport penetrates into the preheat zone of the flame (thin reaction zone) or even into the reactive-diffusive zone (distributed flames).

== History ==

Lise Watier was born in Montreal in 1942. Her father worked his way up to become manager of a car dealership and her mother had a sense of fashion.&lt;ref name="JaimerBusiness"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Jaimer |first1=Kate |title=A touch of beauty: Determination and hard work have made Lise Watier the Celine Dion of Quebec's cosmetics business |url=https://search.proquest.com/news/docview/240263430/fulltext/32944B39CF844F9BPQ/8?accountid=10226 |accessdate=14 June 2018 |publisher=Ottawa Citizen |date=31 July 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She told the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' that the heavy makeup she wore for her job as a researcher and host for a women's interest television program from 1963 to 1968 inspired her to create a self-improvement and makeup course company, Charme et Beauté Lise Watier Inc., in 1965, and to launch her own line of cosmetics in 1972.&lt;ref name="BotLook"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bot |first1=Ellen |title=Watier favors subtle makeup look |url=https://search.proquest.com/news/docview/435598489/fulltext/32944B39CF844F9BPQ/6?accountid=10226 |accessdate=14 June 2018 |publisher=Toronto Star |date=2 July 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Montreal-based company first attempted to expand in the 1980s, but a fire in the company's factory and offices was a major setback. Watier later told the ''[[National Post]]'', "It took until 1995 to get back to the point we were at in 1990."&lt;ref name="AllosseryMarket"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Allossery |first1=Patrick |title=Quebec's Watier finds the sweet smell of success It's all in the family; Despite setbacks, firm is still tops in its home market |url=https://search.proquest.com/news/docview/329574649/fulltext/DE9C6CAEE4E4D0FPQ/5?accountid=10226 |accessdate=12 June 2018 |publisher=National Post |date=25 October 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the turn of the century, the company's cosmetics were distributed in France and across Canada.&lt;ref name="AllosseryMarket"/&gt;

Watier was a family-owned company; Watier's husband, Serge Rocheleau was chairman and general manager, and daughters Nathalie and Marie-Lise worked in marketing.&lt;ref name="AllosseryMarket"/&gt;

The brand is distributed in Canada and the United States.

In 1986, the company's founder was honoured as Canadian business woman of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1946&amp;dat=19860523&amp;id=Z4oxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=UagFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=907,1880925 |title=Founder of Lise Watier cosmetics honoured as businesswoman of the year  |work=The Montreal Gazette |date= May 23, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Imperial Capital Corporation of Toronto, an investment firm, purchased a majority stake in the company, with Watier and Rocheleau retaining seats on the board and a minority share in the company.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pressreader.com/canada/montreal-gazette/20130918/281883001030695|title=End of an era: Tearful CEO Lise Watier steps down|last=Friede|first=Eve|date=September 18, 2013|website=|publisher=The Montreal Gazette|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the company signed [[Mitsou Gélinas]], a Canadian singer, actor and television personality, as ambassador.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-196534343.html

In 2013, Watier stepped down as CEO, appointing Pierre Plasard, previously of [[L'Oréal]], to take her place.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As of that time, the company had 175 employees and did approximately $90 million in sales annually.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The company was acquired by [[Groupe Marcelle|Groupe Marcelle Inc.]] in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/business/montreal-s-groupe-marcelle-buys-lise-watier-cosmetiques-with-help-from-caisse-de-depot-1.2783801|title=Montreal's Groupe Marcelle buys Lise Watier Cosmetiques with help from Caisse de depot|date=February 18, 2016|publisher=CTV News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://montrealgazette.com/business/local-business/groupe-marcelle-buys-lise-watier-cosmetics-company|title=Groupe Marcelle buys Lise Watier cosmetics company|date=February 18, 2016|work=Montreal Gazette}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of weapons ([[aircraft ordnance]]) carried by aircraft.

==Guns==
In [[World War I]], aircraft were initially intended for [[aerial reconnaissance]], however some pilots began to carry rifles in case they spotted enemy planes. Soon, planes were fitted with machine guns with a variety of mountings; initially the only guns were carried in the rear cockpit supplying defensive fire (this was employed by two-seat aircraft all through the war). Seeing a need for offensive fire, forward-firing weapons were devised. The [[Airco DH.2]] [[Pusher configuration|pusher plane]] had its gun in the front while the engine was in the back, some experimented with mountings on the (side) wing or on the biplane's upper wing (above the cockpit), until by 1916 most fighter aircraft mounted their guns in the forward fuselage using a [[synchronization gear]] so that the bullets did not strike the propeller.

In [[World War II]], fighter aircraft carried [[machine gun]]s and [[Cannon#Autocannon|cannons]] mounted in the wings, engine cowlings, nose, or between the banks of the engine, firing through the propeller spinner. [[Night fighters]] sometimes utilized guns [[Schrage Musik|firing upwards]] as well. Bombers typically carried from one to 14 flexible machine guns and/or autocannon as defensive armament, while certain types added fixed offensive guns as well.

While missiles have been the primary armament since the early 1960s, the [[Vietnam War]] showed that guns still had a role to play and most fighters built since then are fitted with cannons (typically between 20 and 30&amp;nbsp;mm in caliber) as an adjunct to missiles. Modern European fighter aircraft are usually equipped with the [[revolver cannon]], whereas the United States and to some extent Russia generally favor the [[Gatling gun#Development of modern Gatling-type guns|Gatling gun]]. The Gatling gun quickly became the weapon of choice for most air forces.

{{History of printing}}

'''Movable type''' (US English; '''moveable type''' in British English) is the system and [[technology]] of [[printing]] and [[typography]] that uses movable [[Sort (typesetting)|components]] to reproduce the elements of a document (usually individual [[alphanumeric characters]] or [[punctuation marks]]) usually on the medium of [[paper]].

The world's first movable type printing press technology for printing [[paper]] [[books]] was made of [[porcelain]] materials and was invented around AD 1040 in China during the [[Northern Song Dynasty]] by the inventor [[Bi Sheng]] (990–1051).&lt;ref name="needhamb"&gt;{{cite book |last = Needham |first = Joseph |title = The Shorter Science and Civilisation in China, Volume 4 |year = 1994 |publisher = Cambridge University Press |page = 14 |isbn = 9780521329958 |quote = Bi Sheng... who first devised, about 1045, the art of printing with movable type}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently in 1377, the world's oldest extant movable metal print book, [[Jikji]], was printed in Korea during the [[Goryeo]] dynasty. 

Because of this, the diffusion of both movable-type systems was, to some degree, limited to primarily [[East Asia]], although various sporadic reports of movable type technology were brought back to Europe by Christian missionaries, traders and business people who were returning to Europe after having worked in China for several years; and influenced the development of printing technology in Europe. Some of these [[medieval European]] accounts are still preserved in the library archives of the [[Vatican Library|Vatican]] and [[Bodleian Library|Oxford University]] among many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = He | first1 = Zhou | year = 1994 | title = Diffusion of Movable Type in China and Europe: Why Were There Two Fates? | journal = International Communication Gazette | volume = 53 | issue = 3 | pages = 153–173 | doi = 10.1177/001654929405300301 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Around 1450, [[Johannes Gutenberg]] introduced the metal movable-type [[printing press]] in Europe, along with innovations in casting the type based on a [[matrix (printing)|matrix]] and [[hand mould]]. The small number of [[alphabet|alphabetic]] characters needed for European languages was an important factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beckwith |first=Christopher I. |title=Empires of the Silk Road: A History of Central Eurasia from the Bronze Age to the Present |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-691-15034-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gutenberg was the first to create his type pieces from an alloy of [[lead]], [[tin]], and [[antimony]]—and these materials remained standard for 550 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Britannica|477017|Printing (publishing)}} Retrieved &lt;/ref&gt;

For [[alphabetic script|alphabetic scripts]], movable-type [[page setting]] was quicker than [[woodblock printing]]. The metal type pieces were more durable and the lettering was more uniform, leading to typography and [[font]]s. The high quality and relatively low price of the [[Gutenberg Bible]] (1455) established the superiority of movable type in Europe and the use of [[printing presses]] spread rapidly. The printing press may be regarded as one of the key factors fostering the [[Renaissance]]&lt;ref&gt;Eisenstein, Elizabeth L., ''The Printing Revolution in Early Modern Europe'', Cambridge University Press, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; and due to its effectiveness, its [[Global spread of the printing press|use spread around the globe]].

The 19th-century invention of [[hot metal typesetting]] and its successors caused movable type to decline in the 20th century.

== Precursors to movable type ==
=== Letter punch and coins ===
[[File:Tetradrachm 5th century BC athens detail.jpg|right|thumb|Movable type traces its origins to the punches used to make [[coin]]s: the reverse face of a [[Tetradrachm]] [[Ancient Greek coinage|Greek coin]] from [[Athens]], 5th century BC, featuring various letters and the owl symbol of [[Athena]].]]

The technique of imprinting multiple copies of [[symbol]]s or [[glyph]]s with a master ''type'' punch made of hard metal first developed around 3000 BC in [[Sumer|ancient Sumer]]. These metal punch types can be seen as precursors of the letter punches adapted in later millennia to printing with movable metal type. [[Cylinder seal]]s were used in [[Mesopotamia]] to create an impression on a surface by rolling the seal on wet clay.&lt;ref name="Clair"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clair|first1=Kate|last2=Busic-Snyder|first2=Cynthia |title=A Typographic Workbook: A Primer to History, Techniques, and Artistry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lf0iDYCr6w0C|year=2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-39988-0|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were used to "sign" documents and mark objects as the owner's property. Cylinder seals were a related form of early typography capable of printing small page designs in relief (''[[cameo (carving)|cameo]]'') on wax or clay—a miniature forerunner of [[rotogravure|rotogravure printing]] used by wealthy individuals to seal and certify documents. By 650 BC the ancient Greeks were using larger diameter punches to imprint small page images onto [[coin]]s and [[token coin|tokens]].

The [[graphic design|designs]] of the artists who made the first coin punches were stylized with a degree of skill that could not be mistaken for common handiwork—salient and very specific types designed to be reproduced ''ad infinitum''. Unlike the first typefaces used to print books in the 13th century, coin types were neither combined nor printed with [[ink]] on [[paper]], but "published" in metal—a more durable medium—and survived in substantial numbers. As the portable face of ruling authority, coins were a compact form of standardized knowledge issued in large editions, an early mass medium that stabilized trade and civilization throughout the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] world of [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]].

=== Seals and stamps ===

[[File:PhaistosDiskLarge.jpg|thumb|right|A replica of the [[Phaistos Disc]]]]

Seals and stamps may have been precursors to movable type. The uneven spacing of the impressions on brick stamps found in the [[Mesopotamia]]n cities of [[Uruk]] and [[Larsa]], dating from the [[2nd millennium BC]], has been conjectured by some archaeologists as evidence that the stamps were made using movable type.&lt;ref name="brickstamps"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sass|first=Benjamin|last2=Marzahn|first2=Joachim |title=Aramaic and Figural Stamp Impressions on Bricks of the Sixth Century B.C. from Babylon|year=2010|publisher=Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=978-3-447-06184-1|pages=11, 20, 160|quote="the latter has cuneiform signs that look as if made with a movable type, and impressions from Assur display the same phenomenon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The enigmatic [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] Phaistos Disc of 1800–1600 BC has been considered by one scholar as an early example of a body of text being reproduced with reusable characters: it may have been produced by pressing pre-formed hieroglyphic "seals" into the soft clay. A few authors even view the disc as technically meeting all definitional criteria to represent an early incidence of movable-type printing.&lt;ref name="Herbert E. Brekle"&gt;Herbert E. Brekle, "Das typographische Prinzip", ''Gutenberg-Jahrbuch'', Vol. 72 (1997), pp.&amp;nbsp;58–63 (60f.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://themodernantiquarian.com/site/10857/phaistos.html#fieldnotes |first = C.

The [[Prüfening dedicatory inscription]] is medieval example of movable type stamps being used.

===Woodblock printing===
{{Main|Woodblock printing}}
[[File:Jingangjing.jpg|thumb|The intricate frontispiece of the ''[[Diamond Sutra]]'' from [[Tang Dynasty]] China, an early woodblock-printed book, AD 868 ([[British Museum]])]]

Following the [[Cai Lun|invention of paper]] in the 2nd century AD during the Chinese [[Han Dynasty]], writing materials became more portable and economical than the bones, shells, bamboo slips, metal or stone tablets, silk, etc. previously used. Yet copying books by hand was still labour-consuming. Not until the Xiping Era (172–178 AD), towards the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty did sealing print and [[monotype]] appear. It was soon used for printing designs on fabrics, and later for printing texts.

[[Woodblock printing]], invented by about the 8th century during the [[Tang Dynasty]], worked as follows. First, the neat hand-copied script was stuck on a relatively thick and smooth board, with the front of the paper, which was so thin that it was nearly transparent, sticking to the board, and characters showing in reverse, but distinctly, so that every stroke could be easily recognized. Then carvers cut away the parts of the board that were not part of the character, so that the characters were cut in relief, completely differently from those cut intaglio. When printing, the bulging characters would have some ink spread on them and be covered by paper. With workers' hands moving on the back of paper gently, characters would be printed on the paper. By the [[Song Dynasty]], woodblock printing came to its heyday. Although woodblock printing played an influential role in spreading culture, there remained some apparent drawbacks. Firstly, carving the printing plate required considerable time, labour and materials; secondly, it was not convenient to store these plates; and finally, it was difficult to correct mistakes.

With woodblock printing, one printing plate could be used for tens of hundreds of books, playing a magnificent role in spreading culture. Yet carving the plate was time and labour consuming. Huge books cost years of effort. The plates needed a lot of storage space, and were often damaged by deformation, worms and corrosion. If books had a small print run, and were not reprinted, the printing plates would become nothing but waste; and worse, if a mistake was found, it was difficult to correct it without discarding the whole plate.

=== Ceramic movable type ===
[[Bi Sheng]] (毕昇/畢昇) (990–1051) developed the first known movable-type system for printing in China around 1040 AD during the [[Northern Song]] dynasty, using ceramic materials.&lt;ref name="tsien" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Man"&gt;{{cite book |last=Man |first=John |title=The Gutenberg Revolution: The story of a genius that changed the world |year=2002 |publisher=Headline Book Publishing |location=London |isbn=0-7472-4504-5}} A detailed examination of Gutenberg's life and invention, interwoven with the underlying social and religious upheaval of [[Medieval Europe]] on the eve of the Renaissance.&lt;/ref&gt; As described by the Chinese scholar [[Shen Kuo]] (沈括) (1031–1095):

{{quote|When he wished to print, he took an iron frame and set it on the iron plate. In this he placed the types, set close together. When the frame was full, the whole made one solid block of type. He then placed it near the fire to warm it. When the paste [at the back] was slightly melted, he took a smooth board and pressed it over the surface, so that the block of type became as even as a whetstone.

For each character there were several types, and for certain common characters there were twenty or more types each, in order to be prepared for the repetition of characters on the same page. When the characters were not in use he had them arranged with paper labels, one label for each rhyme-group, and kept them in wooden cases.

If one were to print only two or three copies, this method would be neither simple nor easy. But for printing hundreds or thousands of copies, it was marvelously quick. As a rule he kept two forms going. While the impression was being made from the one form, the type was being put in place on the other. When the printing of the one form was finished, the other was then ready.

In 1193, [[Zhou Bida]], an officer of Southern Song Dynasty, made a set of clay movable-type method according to the method described by Shen Kuo in his ''[[Dream Pool Essays]]'', and printed his book ''Notes of The Jade Hall'' (《玉堂雜記》).&lt;ref name="Yinong"&gt;Xu Yinong, ''Moveable Type Books'' (徐憶農《活字本》) {{ISBN|7-80643-795-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The claim that Bi Sheng's clay types were "fragile" and "not practical for large-scale printing" and "short lived"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sohn |first=Pow-Key |title=Early Korean Printing |journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society |volume=79 |issue=2 |year=1959 |pages=96–103 |jstor=595851 |doi=10.2307/595851}}&lt;/ref&gt; was refuted by facts and experiments. Bao Shicheng (1775–1885) wrote that baked clay moveable type was "as hard and tough as horn"; experiments show that clay type, after being baked in an oven, becomes hard and difficult to break, such that it remains intact after being dropped from a height of two metres onto a marble floor. The length of clay movable types in China was 1 to 2 centimetres, not 2mm, thus hard as horn.

There has been an ongoing debate regarding the success of ceramic printing technology as there have been no printed materials found with ceramic movable types. However, it is historically recorded to have been used as late as 1844 in China from the Song dynasty through the Qing dynasty.&lt;ref name="Yinong" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jixing"&gt;Pan Jixing, A history of movable metal type printing technique in China 2001&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|22}}

=== Wooden movable type ===
[[Bi Sheng]] (990–1051) also pioneered the use of wooden movable type around 1040 AD, as described by the Chinese scholar [[Shen Kuo]] (1031–1095). However, this technology was abandoned in favour of clay movable types due to the presence of wood grains and the unevenness of the wooden type after being soaked in ink.&lt;ref name="tsien" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = [[Shen Kuo]] |title = [[Dream Pool Essays]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chinese movable type 1313-ce.png|thumb|A revolving typecase for wooden type in China, from [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]]'s book published in 1313]]
In 1298, [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]] (王祯/王禎), a [[Yuan dynasty]] governmental official of [[Jingde County]], [[Anhui|Anhui Province]], China, re-invented a method of making movable wooden types. He made more than 30,000 wooden movable types and printed 100 copies of ''Records of Jingde County'' (《旌德縣志》), a book of more than 60,000 [[Chinese characters]]. Soon afterwards, he summarized his invention in his book ''A method of making moveable wooden types for printing books''. Although the wooden type was more durable under the mechanical rigors of handling, repeated printing wore the character faces down, and the types could only be replaced by carving new pieces. This system was later enhanced by pressing wooden blocks into sand and casting metal types from the depression in copper, bronze, iron or tin. This new method overcame many of the shortcomings of woodblock printing. Rather than manually carving an individual block to print a single page, movable type printing allowed for the quick assembly of a page of text. Furthermore, these new, more compact type fonts could be reused and stored.&lt;ref name="tsien" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Man" /&gt; The set of wafer-like metal stamp types could be assembled to form pages, inked, and page impressions taken from rubbings on cloth or paper.&lt;ref name="Man" /&gt; In 1322，a [[Fenghua|Fenghua county]] officer Ma Chengde (馬称德) in Zhejiang, made 100,000 wooded movable types and printed the 43-volume ''Daxue Yanyi'' (《大學衍義》). Wooden movable types were used continually in China. Even as late as 1733, a 2300-volume ''Wuying Palace Collected Gems Edition'' (《武英殿聚珍版叢書》) was printed with 253,500 wooden movable types on order of the [[Qianlong Emperor]], and completed in one year.

A number of books printed in [[Tangut script]] during the [[Western Xia]] (1038–1227) period are known, of which the [[Auspicious Tantra of All-Reaching Union]] that was discovered in the ruins of [[Baisigou Square Pagoda]] in 1991 is believed to have been printed sometime during the reign of [[Emperor Renzong of Western Xia]] (1139–1193).&lt;ref name="zhang-yuzhen-2003"&gt;{{Cite journal |author = Zhang Yuzhen (張玉珍) |title = 世界上現存最早的木活字印本—宁夏贺兰山方塔出土西夏文佛經《吉祥遍至口和本讀》介紹 |trans-title=The world's oldest extant book printed with wooden movable type |journal = Library and Information (《書與情报》) |year = 2003 |issue = 1 |url = http://www.zhg1.cn/science/ShowArticle.asp?ArticleID=244&amp;Page=1 |issn = 1003-6938 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120402150528/http://www.zhg1.cn/science/ShowArticle.asp?ArticleID=244&amp;Page=1 |archivedate = 2012-04-02 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered by many Chinese experts to be the earliest extant example of a book printed using wooden movable type.&lt;ref name="beijing-daily"&gt;{{Cite news |author1 = Hou Jianmei (侯健美) |author2 = Tong Shuquan (童曙泉) |title = 《大夏寻踪》今展國博 |trans-title='In the Footsteps of the Great Xia' now exhibiting at the National Museum |newspaper = [[Beijing Daily]] (《北京日报》) |date = 20 December 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The logistical problems of handling the several thousand [[logograph]]s (required for full literacy in [[Middle Chinese|Chinese language]]) posed a particular difficulty. It was faster to carve one woodblock per page than to composit a page from so many different types. However, if one used movable type to produce multiple copies of the same document, the speed of printing would increase relatively.&lt;ref name="tsien" /&gt;{{rp|201}}

=== Metal movable type in China ===
At least 13 material finds in China indicate the invention of bronze movable type printing in China no later than the 12th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.ifeng.com/history/zhongguogudaishi/special/huoziyinshua/|title=韩国剽窃活字印刷发明权只是第一步|website=news.ifeng.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the country producing large-scale bronze-plate-printed paper money and formal official documents issued by the [[Jin dynasty (1115-1234)|Jin]] (1115–1234) and [[Southern Song]] (1127–1279) dynasties with embedded bronze metal types for anti-counterfeit markers. Such paper-money printing might date back to the 11th-century [[jiaozi (currency)|''jiaozi'']] of [[Northern Song]] (960–1127).&lt;ref name="Jixing" /&gt;{{rp|41–54}}

[[File:五贯宝卷.jpg|thumb|right|Copperplate of 1215–1216 5000-[[Chinese cash (currency unit)|cash]] [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)]] [[paper money]] with bronze movable type counterfeit markers]]
The typical example of this kind of bronze movable type embedded copper-block printing is a printed "check" of the Jin Dynasty with two square holes for embedding two bronze movable-type characters, each selected from 1,000 different characters, such that each printed paper note has a different combination of markers. A copper-block printed note dated between 1215–1216 in the collection of [[Luo Zhenyu]]'s ''Pictorial Paper Money of the Four Dynasties'', 1914, shows two special characters – one called ''Ziliao'', the other called ''Zihao'' – for the purpose of preventing counterfeiting; over the ''Ziliao'' there is a small character (輶) printed with movable copper type, while over the ''Zihao'' there is an empty square hole – apparently the associated copper metal type was lost. Another sample of [[Song dynasty]] money of the same period in the collection of the [[Shanghai Museum]] has two empty square holes above ''Ziliao'' as well as ''Zihou'', due to the loss of the two copper movable types. Song dynasty bronze block embedded with bronze metal movable type printed paper money was issued on a large scale and remained in circulation for a long time.&lt;ref&gt;''A History of Moveable Type Printing in China'', by Pan Jixing, Professor of the Institute for History of Science, Academy of Science, Beijing, China, English Abstract, p.&amp;nbsp;273.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1298 book ''Zao Huozi Yinshufa'' (《造活字印书法》/《造活字印書法》) by the [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271–1368) official [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]] mentions [[tin]] movable type, used probably since the [[Southern Song]] dynasty (1127–1279), but this was largely experimental.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]] |year = 1298 |title = Zao Huozi Yinshufa (《造活字印書法》) |quote = 近世又铸锡作字, 以铁条贯之 (rendering: In the modern times, there's melten Tin Movable type, and linked them with iron bar)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was unsatisfactory due to its incompatibility with the [[ink]]ing process.&lt;ref name="tsien" /&gt;{{rp|217}}

During the [[Mongol Empire]] (1206–1405), printing using movable type spread from China to Central Asia.{{clarify |reason = which others? names of cultures please. It beats saying "among others..." |date = February 2012}} The [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]] of Central Asia used movable type, their script type adopted from the Mongol language, some with Chinese words printed between the pages – strong evidence that the books were printed in China.&lt;ref name="TsienACH"&gt;''Chinese Paper and Printing, A Cultural History'', by Tsien, Tsuen-Hsuin&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Removeable type book.jpg|thumb|A page from bronze movable-type book by [[Hua Sui]], printed in 1490]]

During the [[Ming Dynasty]] (1368–1644), [[Hua Sui]] in 1490 used bronze type in printing books.&lt;ref name="tsien" /&gt;{{rp|212}} In 1574 the massive 1000-volume encyclopedia ''[[Imperial Readings of the Taiping Era]]'' (《太平御览》/《太平御覧》) was printed with bronze movable type.

In 1725 the [[Qing Dynasty]] government made 250,000 bronze movable-type characters and printed 64 sets of the encyclopedic ''[[Gujin Tushu Jicheng]]'' (《古今图书集成》/《古今圖書集成》, ''Complete Collection of Illustrations and Writings from the Earliest to Current Times''). Each set consisted of 5,040 volumes, making a total of 322,560 volumes printed using movable type.&lt;ref name="TsienACH" /&gt;

Commenting on the invention of metallic types by Koreans, French scholar Henri-Jean Martin described this as "[extremely similar] to Gutenberg's".&lt;ref name="Briggs 2002 pp.15-23"&gt;Briggs, Asa and Burke, Peter (2002) ''A Social History of the Media: from Gutenberg to the Internet'', Polity, Cambridge, pp.&amp;nbsp;15–23, 61–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

The techniques for bronze casting, used at the time for making coins (as well as bells and statues) were adapted to making metal type. The [[Joseon dynasty]] scholar Seong Hyeon (성현, 成俔, 1439–1504) records the following description of the Korean font-casting process:

{{quote|At first, one cuts letters in beech wood. One fills a trough level with fine sandy [clay] of the reed-growing seashore. Wood-cut letters are pressed into the sand, then the impressions become negative and form letters [moulds]. At this step, placing one trough together with another, one pours the molten bronze down into an opening. The fluid flows in, filling these negative moulds, one by one becoming type. Lastly, one scrapes and files off the irregularities, and piles them up to be arranged.&lt;ref name="christensen" /&gt;}}

A potential solution to the linguistic and cultural bottleneck that held back movable type in Korea for 200 years appeared in the early 15th century—a generation before Gutenberg would begin working on his own movable-type invention in Europe—when [[Sejong the Great of Joseon|Sejong the Great]] devised a simplified [[alphabet]] of 24 characters ([[hangul]]) for use by the common people, which could have made the typecasting and compositing process more feasible. But Korea's cultural elite, "appalled at the idea of losing [[hanja]], the badge of their elitism", stifled the adoption of the new alphabet.&lt;ref name="Man" /&gt;

A "[[Confucianism|Confucian]] prohibition on the commercialization of printing" also obstructed the proliferation of movable type, restricting the distribution of books produced using the new method to the government.&lt;ref name="Burke" /&gt; The technique was restricted to use by the royal foundry for official state publications only, where the focus was on reprinting Chinese classics lost in 1126 when Korea's libraries and palaces had perished in a conflict between dynasties.&lt;ref name="Burke"&gt;Burke&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johannes Gutenberg]] of [[Mainz]], Germany is acknowledged as the first to invent a metal movable-type printing system in Europe, the [[printing press]]. Gutenberg was a [[goldsmith]] familiar with techniques of [[punchcutting|cutting punches]] for making coins from moulds. Between 1436 and 1450 he developed hardware and techniques for casting letters from [[matrix (printing)|matrices]] using a device called the [[hand mould]].&lt;ref name="meggs58-69" /&gt; Gutenberg's key invention and contribution to movable-type printing in Europe, the hand mould, was the first practical means of making cheap copies of letterpunches in the vast quantities needed to print complete books, making the movable-type printing process a viable enterprise.

Before Gutenberg, books were copied out by hand on scrolls and paper, or printed from hand-carved wooden blocks. It was extremely time-consuming; even a small book could take months to complete, and because the carved letters or blocks were flimsy and the wood susceptible to ink the blocks had a limited lifespan.

Gutenberg and his associates developed oil-based inks ideally suited to printing with a [[printing press|press]] on paper, and the first Latin [[typeface]]s. His method of casting type may have been different from the hand mould used in subsequent decades. Detailed analysis of the type used in his 42-line Bible has revealed irregularities in some of the characters that cannot be attributed to ink spread or type wear under the pressure of the press. Scholars conjecture that the type pieces may have been cast from a series of matrices made with a series of individual stroke punches, producing many different versions of the same glyph.[[File:Miklós Andor in the page-setting room of Athenaeum Printing House - cca. 1920 (1).tiff|thumb|Editing with movable metal – cca. 1920]]

&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that the method used by Gutenberg involved using a single punch to make a mould, but the mould was such that the process of taking the type out disturbed the casting, creating variants and anomalies, and that the punch-matrix system came into use possibly around the 1470s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.open2.net/home/view?entityID=15599&amp;jsp=themed_learning%2Fexpanding_viewer&amp;sessionID=-1161756493749&amp;entityName=object |title=What Did Gutenberg Invent?—Discovery |accessdate=2006-10-25 |year=2006 |publisher=BBC / [[Open University]] }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gutenberg's movable-type printing system spread rapidly across Europe, from the single Mainz printing press in 1457 to 110 presses by 1480, of which 50 were in [[Italy]]. [[Venice]] quickly became the center of typographic and printing activity. Significant were the contributions of [[Nicolas Jenson]], [[Francesco Griffo]], [[Aldus Manutius]], and other printers of late 15th-century Europe.

== Type-founding ==
[[File:Long S-I Garamond sort 001.png|thumb|upright|A piece of cast metal type, [[Garamond]] style [[long s]] [[i]] [[Ligature (typography)|ligature]]. See also: [[Sort (typesetting)|Sort]].]]

Type-founding as practiced in Europe and the west consists of three stages.

; [[Punchcutting]]: If the glyph design includes enclosed spaces ([[counter (typography)|counters]]) then a counterpunch is made. The counter shapes are transferred in relief ([[cameo (carving)|cameo]]) onto the end of a rectangular bar of [[mild steel]] using a specialized [[engraving]] tool called a [[Burin (engraving)|graver]]. The finished counterpunch is hardened by heating and quenching ([[tempering (metallurgy)|tempering]]), or exposure to a cyanide solution ([[case hardening]]). The counterpunch is then struck against the end of a similar rectangular steel bar—the letterpunch—to impress the counter shapes as recessed spaces ([[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]]). The outer profile of the glyph is completed by scraping away with a graver the material outside the counter spaces, leaving only the stroke or lines of the glyph. Progress toward the finished design is checked by successive ''smoke proofs''; temporary prints made from a thin coating of carbon deposited on the punch surface by a candle flame. The finished letter punch is finally hardened to withstand the rigors of reproduction by striking. One counterpunch and one letterpunch are produced for every letter or glyph making up a complete font.
; [[Matrix (printing)|Matrix]]: The letterpunch is used to strike a blank die of soft metal to make a negative letter mould, called a matrix.
; Casting: The matrix is inserted into the bottom of a device called a ''hand mould''. The mould is clamped shut and molten type metal alloy consisting mostly of [[lead]] and [[tin]], with a small amount of [[antimony]] for hardening, is poured into a cavity from the top. Antimony has the rare property of expanding as it cools, giving the casting sharp edges.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = Answers.com page on antimony | work = McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science and Technology | publisher = McGraw-Hill | date = 2005-01-01 | url = http://www.answers.com/topic/antimony | accessdate = 2009-06-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the type metal has sufficiently cooled, the mould is unlocked and a rectangular block approximately 4 centimeters long, called a ''[[sort (typesetting)|sort]]'', is extracted. Excess casting on the end of the sort, called the ''tang'', is later removed to make the sort the precise height required for printing, known as "type height".

The type-height was quite different in different countries. The Monotype Corporation Limited in London UK produced moulds in various heights:

* {{convert|0.918|in|mm}} : United Kingdom, Canada, U.S.
* {{convert|0.928|in|mm}} : France, Germany, Switzerland and most other European countries
* {{convert|0.933|in|mm}} : Belgium height
* {{convert|0.9785|in|mm}} : Dutch height

A Dutch printers manual mentions a tiny difference between French and German Height:&lt;ref&gt;Blankenstein A.H.G., Wetser Ad: ''Zetten, uitgebreide leerstof, deel 1'', p.&amp;nbsp;26, Edecea, Hoorn, The Netherlands, 5th edition, (~1952)&lt;/ref&gt;

* 62.027 points Didot = {{convert|23.30|mm}} = English height
* 62.666 points Didot = {{convert|23.55|mm}} = French height
* 62.685 points Didot = {{convert|23.56|mm}} = German height
* 66.047 points Didot = {{convert|24.85|mm}} = Dutch Height
 
Tiny differences in type-height will cause quite bold images of characters.

At the end of the 19th century there were only two typefoundries left in the Netherlands: [[Joh. Enschedé|Johan Enschedé &amp; Zonen]], at [[Haarlem]], and [[Amsterdam Type foundry|Lettergieterij Amsterdam, voorheen Tetterode]]. They both had their own type-height: Enschedé: 65 23/24 points Didot, and Amsterdam: 66 1/24 points Didot. Enough difference to prevent a combined use of fonts of both typefoundries: Enschede would be to light, or otherwise the Amsterdam-font would print rather bold. A perfect way of binding clients.&lt;ref&gt;P.J.W.Oly, de grondslag van het bedrijf der lettergieterij Amsterdam, formerly N.Tetterode, edition: Stichting Lettergieten 1983, Westzaan, pag. 82-88&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905 the Dutch governmental "Algemeene Landsdrukkerij", later: "State-printery" (Staatsdrukkerij) decided during a reorganisation to use a standard type-height of 63 points Didot. "Staatsdrukkerij-hoogte", actually Belgium-height, but this fact was not widely known.

== Typesetting ==
[[File:Metal movable type.jpg|right|thumb|A case of cast metal type pieces and typeset matter in a [[composing stick]]]]
{{Main|Typesetting|Type case}}

Modern, factory-produced movable type was available in the late 19th century. It was held in the printing shop in a ''job case'', a drawer about 2&amp;nbsp;inches high, a yard wide, and about two feet deep, with many small compartments for the various letters and ligatures. The most popular and accepted of the job case designs in America was the [[California Job Case]], which took its name from the Pacific coast location of the foundries that made the case popular.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amateurpress.org/bundle/camp194.htm National Amateur Press Association], Monthly Bundle Sample, Campane 194, ''The California Typecase'' by Lewis A. Pryor (Edited)&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, the capital letters were stored in a separate drawer or case that was located above the case that held the other letters; this is why capital letters are called "upper case" characters while the non-capitals are "lower case".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ewSglB2f7qYC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=capital+uppercase+typesetting+term&amp;source=web&amp;ots=6tr9ttWJM7&amp;sig=XVBi9LMycbrSTaYzeK4fPI7r8ZI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result Glossary of Typesetting Terms], by Richard Eckersley, Charles Ellerston, Richard Hendel, Page 18&lt;/ref&gt;

Compartments also held spacers, which are blocks of blank type used to separate words and fill out a line of type, such as ''em'' and ''en'' quads (''quadrats'', or spaces. A ''quadrat'' is a block of type whose face is lower than the printing letters so that it does not itself print.). An em space was the width of a capital letter "M" – as wide as it was high – while an en space referred to a space half the width of its height (usually the dimensions for a capital "N").

Individual letters are assembled into words and lines of text with the aid of a [[composing stick]], and the whole assembly is tightly bound together to make up a page image called a ''forme'', where all letter faces are exactly the same height to form a flat surface of type. The forme is mounted on a [[printing press]], a thin coating of viscous ink is applied and impressions made on paper under great pressure in the press. "Sorts" is the term given to special characters not freely available in the typical type case, such as the "@" mark.

== Metal type combined with other methods ==
[[File:Ceramic type 02.jpg|thumb|Ceramic type from the collections of [[University of Reading]].]]

Sometimes it is erroneously stated that printing with metal type replaced the earlier methods. In the industrial era printing methods would be chosen to suit the purpose. For example, when printing large scale letters in posters etc. the metal type would have proved too heavy and economically unviable. Thus, large scale type was made as carved wood blocks as well as ceramics plates.&lt;ref&gt;Meggs, Philip B., Purvis, Alston W. "Graphic Design and the Industrial Revolution" ''History of Graphic Design''. Hoboken, N.J: Wiley, 2006. p.&amp;nbsp;139.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in many cases where large scale text was required, it was simpler to hand the job to a [[Sign painting|sign painter]] than a printer.
Images could be printed together with movable type if they were made as [[woodcut]]s or [[wood engraving]]s as long as the blocks were made to the same type height. If [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] methods, such as copper plates, were used for the images, then images and the text would have required separate print runs on different machines.

'''Neihu District''' is a [[District (Taiwan)|district]] of [[Taipei|Taipei City]], [[Taiwan]]. Neihu means "inner lake." The older name originates from the [[Ketagalan]] word ''Tayour'' (transliterated by the Dutch as ''Cattajo''), meaning woman's head ornament.

Many mountainous roads and paths, which are ideal for hiking, connect Neihu with the neighboring [[Shilin District]] and [[Yangmingshan National Park]]. The Tri-Service General Hospital, which is a teaching hospital of the National Defense Medical Center, is also in Neihu. The [[Wuchih Mountain Military Cemetery]] borders Neihu.

In 2018, Neihu became the seat of the [[American Institute in Taiwan]] (AIT), the de facto embassy of the United States in Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-taiwan-diplomacy/u-s-unveils-de-facto-embassy-in-taiwan-amid-china-tensions-idUSKBN1J72QS|title=U.S. shows new de facto embassy in Taiwan amid China tensions|last=Yu|first=Jess Macy|date=2018-06-11|work=U.S.|access-date=2018-09-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Remote central locking.jpg|thumb|right|A remote control for a keyless entry system built into an ignition key. Pressing a button on the key unlocks the car doors. Another button locks the car.]]
A '''keyless entry system''' is an [[electronic lock]] that controls access to a building or [[vehicle]] without using a traditional mechanical [[key (lock)|key]].  The term ''keyless entry system'' originally meant a lock controlled by a [[keypad]] located at or near the driver's door, which required entering a predetermined (or self-programmed) numeric code. Such systems now have a hidden touch-activated keypad and are still available on certain [[Ford]] and [[Lincoln (automobile)|Lincoln]] models.

The term '''remote keyless system''' (RKS), also called '''keyless entry''' or '''remote central locking''', refers to a lock that uses an electronic remote control as a key which is activated by a handheld device or automatically by proximity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Job|first=Ann|title=Driving Without Car Keys|url=http://editorial.autos.msn.com/article.aspx?cp-documentid=435298|work=MSN Autos|accessdate=27 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Widely used in automobiles, an RKS performs the functions of a standard  [[Key (lock)|car key]] without physical contact.  When within a few yards of the car, pressing a button on the remote can lock or unlock the doors, and may perform other functions.  A remote keyless system can include both a '''remote keyless entry system''' (RKE), which unlocks the doors, and a '''remote keyless ignition system''' (RKI), which starts the engine.

==History==
One of the first introductions was in 1980 on the [[Ford Thunderbird (eighth generation)|Ford Thunderbird]], [[Mercury Cougar#Fifth generation (1980–1982)|Mercury Cougar]], [[Lincoln Continental Mark VI|Continental Mark VI]], and [[Lincoln Town Car]], which Ford called '''Keyless Entry System''' (later renamed SecuriCode). It was a keypad on the driver-side exterior door above the door handle. It consisted of a keypad with five buttons that when the code was entered, would unlock the driver's door, with subsequent code entries to unlock all doors, and the trunk. [[Nissan]] offered the same technology on the [[Nissan Maxima#Second generation (PU11; 1984–1988)|Nissan Maxima]] and [[Nissan 300ZX#Z31|Nissan Fairlady]] beginning in 1984, essentially using the same approach as Ford, with the addition of being able to roll the windows down and open the optional [[moonroof]] from outside the vehicle on the door handle installed keypad on both the driver's and front passengers door.

The remote keyless systems using a handheld transmitter first began appearing on the French made [[Renault Fuego]] in 1982,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1980-1985 RENAULT Fuego Turbo|url=http://www.classicandperformancecar.com/front_website/octane_interact/carspecs.php/?see=3341|work=Octane|accessdate=27 February 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121027091155/http://www.classicandperformancecar.com/front_website/octane_interact/carspecs.php/?see=3341|archivedate=27 October 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as an option on several [[American Motors]] vehicles in 1983, including the [[Renault Alliance]]. The feature gained its first widespread availability in the U.S. on several [[General Motors]] vehicles in 1989.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==Function==
{{refimprove|section, except for two footnotes,|date=November 2013}}
Keyless remotes contain a short-range [[radio transmitter]], and must be within a certain range, usually 5–20 meters, of the car to work.  When a button is pushed, it sends a coded signal by  [[radio wave]]s to a receiver unit in the car, which locks or unlocks the door.  Most RKEs operate at a [[frequency]] of 315&amp;nbsp;MHz for North America-made cars and at [[LPD433|433.92&amp;nbsp;MHz]] for European, Japanese and Asian cars. Modern systems since the mid-1990s implement [[encryption]] as well as rotating entry codes to prevent car thieves from intercepting and [[Spoofing attack|spoofing]] the signal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/07/technology/how-it-works-remote-keyless-entry-staying-a-step-ahead-of-car-thieves.html|title=HOW IT WORKS; Remote Keyless Entry: Staying a Step Ahead of Car Thieves|last=Lake|first=Matt|date=2001-06-07|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=2017-02-10|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier systems used infrared instead of radio signals to unlock the vehicle, such as systems found on Mercedes-Benz,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.benzworld.org/forums/r129-sl-class/1524730-infrared-keyless-entry-95-sl500.html infrared-keyless-entry], benzworld.org.&lt;/ref&gt; BMW&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bimmernut.com/forum/5-series-bmw/31110-infrared-keyless-entry-1990-a.html |title=Archived copy of post to BMW forum |accessdate=2012-06-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109220901/http://www.bimmernut.com/forum/5-series-bmw/31110-infrared-keyless-entry-1990-a.html |archivedate=2013-11-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and other manufacturers.

The system signals that it has either locked or unlocked the car usually through some fairly discreet combination of flashing vehicle lamps, a distinctive sound other than the horn, or some usage of the horn itself. A typical setup on cars is to have the horn or other sound chirp twice to signify that the car has been unlocked, and chirp once to indicate the car has been locked. For example, Toyota, Scion, and Lexus use a chirp system to signify the car being locked/unlocked. While two beeps means that driver's door is unlocked, four beeps means all doors are unlocked. One long beep is for the trunk or power tailgate. One short beep signifies that the car is locked and alarm is set.

The functions of a remote keyless entry system are contained on a [[key fob]] or built into the [[ignition system|ignition]] key handle itself. Buttons are dedicated to  locking or unlocking the doors and opening the trunk or tailgate. On some minivans, the power sliding doors can be opened/closed remotely. Some cars will also close any open [[power window|windows]] and roof when remotely locking the car. Some remote keyless fobs also feature a red [[panic button]] which activates the [[car alarm]] as a standard feature. Further adding to the convenience, some cars' engines with remote keyless ignition systems can be started by the push of a button on the key fob (useful in cold weather), and convertible tops can be raised and lowered from outside the vehicle while it's parked.

On cars where the trunk release is electronically operated, it can be triggered to open by a button on the remote. Conventionally, the trunk springs open with the help of [[hydraulic cylinder|hydraulic strut]]s or [[torsion spring]]s, and thereafter must be lowered manually. Premium models, such as SUVs and estates with tailgates, may have a motorized assist that can both open and close the tailgate for easy access and remote operation.

For offices, or residences, the system can also be coupled with the security system, garage door opener or remotely activated lighting devices.

===Rolling Code===
Most keyless systems use a technique called [[rolling code]] to avoid [[replay attack]]s, in which the open command is intercepted to be used by a thief at a later time.&lt;ref&gt;Brain, M., "[https://auto.howstuffworks.com/remote-entry.htm How Remote Entry Works]", ''HowStuffWorks''  Auto Auto Basics. Retrieved July 8, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; In the rolling code, a [[Pseudorandomness | pseudorandom number]] generator is used to generate a different unlock sequence to be sent each time the car is unlocked.

==Programming==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2013}}
Remote keyless entry [[Security token|fobs]] emit a [[radio frequency]] with a designated, distinct digital identity code. Inasmuch as "programming" fobs is a proprietary technical process, it is typically performed by the automobile manufacturer. In general, the procedure is to put the car computer in 'programming mode'. This usually entails engaging the power in the car several times while holding a button or lever. It may also include opening doors, or removing [[Fuse (automotive)|fuses]]. The procedure varies amongst various makes, models, and years. Once in 'programming mode' one or more of the fob buttons is depressed to send the digital identity code to the car's onboard computer. The computer saves the code and the car is then taken out of programming mode.

As RKS fobs have become more prevalent in the automobile industry a secondary market of unprogrammed devices has sprung up. Some websites sell steps to program fobs for individual models of cars as well as accessory kits to remotely activate other car devices.

On early (1998-2012) keyless entry remotes, the remotes can be individually programmed by the user, by pressing a button on the remote, and starting the vehicle. However, newer (2013+) keyless entry remotes require [[Car dealership|dealership]] or [[locksmith]] programming via a [[computer]] with special software . The [[Infrared]] keyless entry systems offered user programming, though [[radio frequency]] keyless entry systems mostly require dealer programming.

== Smart key ==
{{see also|Smart key|Immobiliser}}
Some cars have a proximity system that is triggered if a [[transponder car key]] is within a certain distance of the car and is sometimes called [[hands-free]] or advanced key.

One of the earliest systems was found on the [[Chevrolet Corvette#C4 Generation .281984.E2.80.931996.29|1993 Chevrolet Corvette]] (called the Passive Keyless Entry System) and in [[Mercedes-Benz]] vehicles from 1998. {{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Today, this system is commonly found on a variety of vehicles, and although the exact method of operation differs between makes and models, their operation is generally similar: a vehicle can be unlocked without the driver needing to physically push a button on the key fob to lock or unlock the car and is also able to start or stop the ignition without physically having to insert the key and turning the ignition. Instead, the vehicle senses that the key (which may be located in the user's pocket, purse, etc.) is approaching the vehicle.

A simpler version of the smart key system is the [[Immobiliser|engine immobiliser]], involving a security key system embedded into most modern vehicle's keys. A small chip rests on the vehicle's key or under the plastic key cover. When any key is inserted into the ignition, the ignition is coded. The key sends its security code to the ignition, which also has its own security code, and if the security codes match, the vehicle will start when the key is turned. However, if the key codes do NOT match, the vehicle will NOT start when the key is turned. Some early examples of this technology include [[Chrysler Corporation]]'s [[Sentry Key]] System, or [[General Motors]]'s [[PASSKey]] System.

Some security keys can be programmed by the user, though most of these keys have to be programmed by a dealership or [[locksmith]] via a [[computer]]. It was not possible to copy these keys at a [[hardware store]] or [[auto parts]] store, but nowadays it is.

== Security ==
Keyless ignition does not by default provide better security. In October 2014, it was found that some insurers in the United Kingdom would not insure certain vehicles with keyless ignition unless there were additional mechanical locks in place due to weaknesses in the keyless system.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/oct/27/thieves-range-rover-keyless-locking&lt;/ref&gt;

News media have reported cases where it is suspected that criminals managed to open cars by using signal boosters to trick vehicles into thinking that their keyless entry fobs were close by even when they were far away, though they have not reported that any such devices have been found. The articles speculate that keeping fobs in aluminum foil or a freezer when not in use can prevent criminals from exploiting this vulnerability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Vulnerability In Car Keyless Entry Systems Allows Anyone To Open And Steal Your Vehicle |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/josephsteinberg/2015/05/12/vulnerability-in-car-keyless-entry-systems-allows-anyone-to-open-and-steal-your-car/ |work=Forbes |first=Joseph |last=Steinberg |authorlink=Joseph Steinberg |date=May 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, it was reported that [[Samy Kamkar]] had built an inexpensive electronic device about the size of a wallet that could be concealed on or near a locked vehicle to capture a single keyless entry code to be used at a later time to unlock the vehicle.  The device transmits a jamming signal to block the vehicle's reception of [[rolling code]] signals from the owner's fob, while recording these signals from both of his two attempts needed to unlock the vehicle.  The recorded first code is sent to the vehicle only when the owner makes the second attempt, while the recorded second code is retained for future use.  Kamkar stated that this vulnerability had been widely known for years to be present in many vehicle types but was previously undemonstrated.&lt;ref name="RollinCode"&gt;{{cite news | title=A hacker made a $30 gadget that can unlock many cars that have keyless entry | url=http://www.techinsider.io/samy-kamkar-keyless-entry-car-hack-2015-8 | work=[[Tech Insider]] | first=Cadie | last=Thompson | date=2015-08-06 | accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A demonstration was announced for [[DEF CON]] 23.&lt;ref name="DC23"&gt;{{cite web | title=Drive It Like You Hacked It: New Attacks and Tools to Wirelessly Steal Cars | url=https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-23/dc-23-speakers.html#Kamkar | work=[[DEF CON]] 23 | first=Samy | last=Kamkar | date=2015-08-07 | accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''roadbook''' is a diagrammatic book typically used by [[rallying|rally]] [[co-driver]]s and [[overlanding|overland]] travelers to navigate across uncertain terrain. Usually, the roadbook consists of several pages of [[tulip-diagram]]s{{clarifyme|date=August 2015}}, [[GPS]] co-ordinates and written instructions to assist in [[navigation]].

In rally sport, the term [[pacenotes]] is more usual.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3450">A '''self-heating can''' is an enhancement of the common food [[tin can|can]]. Self-heating cans have dual chambers, one surrounding the other, making a [[self-heating food package]].

In one version, the inner chamber holds the food or drink, and the outer chamber houses chemicals which undergo an [[exothermic reaction]] when combined. When the user wants to heat the contents of the can, a ring on the can - when pulled - breaks the barrier which keeps the chemicals in the outer chamber apart from the water. In another type, the chemicals are in the inner chamber and the beverage surrounds it in the outer chamber. To heat the contents of the can, the user pushes on the bottom of the can to break the barrier separating the chemical from the water. This design has the advantages of being more efficient (less heat is lost to the surrounding air) as well as reducing excessive heating of the product's exterior, causing possible discomfort to the user. In either case, after the heat from the reaction has been absorbed by the food, the user can enjoy a hot meal or drink.

Self-heating cans offer benefits to campers and people without access to oven, stove or camp-fire, but their use is not widespread. This is because self-heating cans are considerably more expensive than the conventional type, take more space, and have problems with uneven heating of their contents.

==Technology==
The source of the heat for the self-heated can is an [[exothermic reaction]] that the user initiates by pressing on the bottom of the can. The can is manufactured as a triple-walled container. A container for the beverage surrounds a container of the heating agent separated from a container of water by a thin breakable membrane. When the user pushes on the bottom of the can, a rod pierces the membrane, allowing the water and heating agent to mix. The resulting reaction releases heat and thus warms the beverage surrounding it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5461867.html Container with integral module for heating or cooling the contents - Patent 5461867&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The heating agent and responsible reaction vary from product to product. [[Calcium oxide]] is used in the following reaction:
: CaO(s)+ H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(aq) → Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(s)

[[Copper sulphate]] and powdered [[zinc]] can also be used, but this process is less efficient:
: CuSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(s) + Zn(s) → ZnSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(s) + Cu(s)

Anhydrous [[calcium chloride]] is often used as well. In this case, no chemical reaction occurs, instead the [[Enthalpy change of solution|heat of solution]] is generated.

[[File:Spade.jpg|thumb|Small spade for clay soil; the other one for sandy soil and [[loam]]y soil]]
A '''spade''' is a tool primarily for digging, comprising a blade – typically narrower and less curved than that of a [[shovel]] – and a long handle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/spade Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1) definition of spade]&lt;/ref&gt;  Early spades were made of [[Riving|riven]] wood or of animal bones (often [[scapula|shoulder blade]]s). After the art of [[metalworking]] was developed, spades were made with sharper tips of metal. Before the introduction of metal spades manual labor was less efficient at moving [[dirt|earth]], with picks being required to break up the soil in addition to a spade for moving the dirt.  With a metal tip, a spade can both break and move the earth in most situations, increasing efficiency.

==Etymology==
English ''spade'' is from [[Old English]] ''{{lang|ang|spadu, spædu}}'' (f.) or ''{{lang|ags|spada}}'' (m.). The same word is found in [[Old Frisian]] ''{{lang|gem|spade}}'' and [[Old Saxon]] ''{{lang|gem|spado}}''. [[High German]] ''{{lang|de|spaten}}'' only appears in [[Early Modern German]], probably loaned from [[Low German]]. In Denmark, Sweden and Norway the word is ''spade'' as well. Other Scandinavian forms are in turn loaned from [[German language|German]].
The term may thus not originate in [[Common Germanic]] and appears to be a [[North Sea Germanic]] innovation or loaned. Closely related is [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|σπαθη}}, whence [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|[[spatha]]}}''.

==Designs of spades==
Spades are made in many shapes and sizes, for a variety of different functions and jobs, and there are many different designs used in spade manufacturing. People often mistakenly use the term ''[[shovel]]'' interchangeably with spade—but, strictly speaking, shovels generally are broad-bottomed tools for moving loose materials, whereas spades tend to have a flat bottom edge for digging.

The most common spade is a ''garden spade,'' which typically has a long handle, is wide, and is treaded (has rests for the feet to drive the spade into the ground).  An ''Irish spade'' is similar to a common garden spade, with the same general design, although it has a much thinner head. A ''sharpshooter'' is a narrow spade. A ''turfing iron'' has a short, round head, and is used for cutting and paring off turf.  A ''digging fork,'' or ''grape,'' is forked much like a pitchfork, and is useful for loosening ground and gardening. There can also be toy spades for children.

==Loy ploughing==
{{main article|Loy (spade)}}
Loy ploughing was a form of manual ploughing carried out in [[Ireland]] using a form of spade called a loy. It took place on very small farms or on very hilly ground, where horses couldn't work or where farmers couldn't afford them.&lt;ref name= WE2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westmeathexaminer.ie/news/roundup/articles/2009/03/03/36691-castlepollard-venue-to-host-westmeath-ploughing-finals/print|title=Castlepollard venue to host Westmeath ploughing finals|publisher=''Westmeath Examiner''|author=Paul Hughes|date=3 March 2011|accessdate=1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was used up until the 1960s on poorer land.&lt;ref name=Tribune&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribune.ie/archive/article/2009/sep/27/the-plough-and-the-stars/|publisher=''The Tribune''|title=The plough and the stars
|date=27 September 2009|accessdate=1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suited the moist climate of Ireland as the trenches formed by turning in the sods providing [[drainage]]. It also  allowed the growing of potatoes on mountain slopes where no other cultivation could take place.

==Digging tool==
In [[gardening]], a spade is a hand [[tool]] used to dig or loosen ground, or to break up lumps in the soil. Together with the fork it forms one of the chief implements wielded by the hand in agriculture and horticulture. It is sometimes considered a type of shovel. Its typical shape is a broad flat [[blade]] with a sharp lower edge, straight or curved. The upper edge on either side of the handle affords space for the user's foot, which drives it into the ground. The wooden handle ends in a cross-piece, sometimes T-shaped and sometimes forming a kind of loop for the hand.

A small, narrow one-hand shovel for gardening is called a transplanter.

Small and/or plastic toy versions of the same tool are used to dig sand castles on a [[beach]] or in a [[sandpit|sand-box]].

==Currency==
The blade of the spade was used as currency in ancient China.  Later, they were miniaturized and then stylized into a flat piece.  The [[Qin Dynasty]] replaced them with round coins.

==Other uses of the term==
* '''In the oil and chemical process industries''', a spade is a round piece of metal with a small tab that is placed in between two pipe flanges to give positive isolation from the centre; usually to prevent cross contamination between fluids or to allow work on the line. The name comes from the shape: a little like a garden spade. The small tab lets one see that the spade is in place. 
* '''In kitchenware''', certain ice cream scoops are called spades due to the shape.  These scoops are used more in making hand-scooped milkshakes or desserts where a lot of ice cream can be scooped at once and the  typical "ball" shape of scooped ice cream (i.e., scoops on a [[ice cream cone|cone]]) is not needed. The spade-shaped head also helps scrape off the ice cream stuck to the sides of the cartons. 
* '''In typography''', the spade is a symbol (♠) stylized from the idea of the tool. It is used as a representation of one of the [[suit (cards)|suits]] of [[playing card]]s called "[[spades]]".
* A 'spade' also refers to a derogatory term for black African Americans, commonly used in the post-Civil War era.{{contradict-inline|article=List of ethnic slurs|section=S|reason=The List of ethnic slurs article says 1928, not post-Civil War era, and cites the OED.|date=January 12, 2017}}

'''Structural Soil''' is a medium that can be compacted to [[Road surface|pavement]] design and installation requirements while permitting [[root]] growth. It is a mixture of gap-graded [[gravel]]s (made of crushed stone), clay loam, and a hydrogel stabilizing agent to keep the mixture from separating.  It provides an integrated, root penetrable, high strength pavement system that shifts design away from individual tree pits.&lt;ref name="nina"&gt;Bassuk, Nina, Jason Grabosky, [[Peter Trowbridge]], and James Urban. "Structural Soil." Urban Horticulture Institute. Cornell University, 1996. Web. 26 Apr 2010. &lt;http://www.hort.cornell.edu/uhi/outreach/csc/article.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[File:1Structural_Soil_Diagramx800.png|thumb|Structural Soil diagram]]

==Problems with typical installations==
[[File:4Planting_Island_Plan_Viewx800.png|thumb|Plan view of Structural Soil extents]]
Previously the main problem facing the establishment of trees in paved areas is the lack of enough volume of [[soil]] for tree root growth. Soils under pavements are typically so compacted that it stops roots from growing. Older established trees with their roots under pavement grow poorly and often die. They can also cause pavement failure and displacement. Overall pavement preparation and repairs can shorten the life expectancy of a tree to 7–10 years where we could see them grow for at least 50 more years.&lt;ref name="nina"/&gt;

==CU-Structural Soil==
Structural soil was researched and developed in the 1990s by [[Cornell University]]’s Urban Horticulture Institute. In 1999, AMEREQ signed a licensing agreement with Cornell University and currently holds the patent rights to Cornell’s CU-Structural Soil Urban Tree Planting Mix. It is marketed as CU-Structural Soil for quality control and is produced by a network of qualified AMEREQ-licensed companies. CU-Structural Soil on average costs $35–$42 per [[ton]]. Other companies have formed their own brand of structural soil based on Cornell’s work. For example, STALITE has developed STALITE MATRIX Structural Soil that they claim holds more moisture.&lt;ref&gt;Kalter, Brian. "CU-Soil." Amereq, Inc.. Amereq, Inc., 2008. Web. 20 Apr 2010. &lt;http://amereq.com/pages/2/index.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Structural Soil." America's Premier Paver. Pine Hall Brick, n.d. Web. 20 Apr 2010. &lt;http://www.americaspremierpaver.com/alliedproducts/structural_soil.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="second"&gt;Bassuk, Nina. "CU-Structural Soil: An Update after More than a Decade of Use in the Urban Environment." www.urban-forestry.com. 16-19. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wallace Structural Soil/Gap Graded Soil==
[[File:3Street_Tree_Planting-View_2x800.png|thumb|Typical street planting section with Structural Soil]]
Wallace Laboratories modified work in 1994 which had been done by others to help improve the technology. The concept had been used in Europe in the 1980s. They did not seek a patent on their work but left the technology in the public domain for others to freely use. Their work preceded the filing of the [[Cornell University]] patent.

Briefly, the aggregate size was increased to about {{Convert|2|in|cm}}, the soil texture was changed to a clay or clay loam in order to increase the water holding capacity and nutrient capacity, the soil was conditioned with the linear polyacrylamide, and the soil chemical and physical properties were specified.

Their procedure has been extensively used worldwide. One municipal installation used about 50,000 cubic yards of the Wallace Labs formulation.

==Composition==
[[File:5Planting_Island_Detailx800.png|thumb|left|Plan view of Structural Soil extents]]
Structural soil is composed of crushed stone (typically [[limestone]] or [[granite]]) narrowly graded from ¾-1 ½” highly angular with no fines, clay loam which should conform to the USDA soil classification system. The hydrogel is added in a small amount to prevent the separation of the stone and soil during mixing and installation. Usually a layer of stone is spread, then the dry hydrogel is spread evenly on top and screened moist loam is placed on top. The entire mixture is then turned until a uniform blend is produced. Structural soil is not typically stockpiled; it should be mixed and installed soon after delivery. If a stockpile is required, the soil needs to be protected from the elements so it does not become contaminated. Installation typically calls for two cubic feet of soil is needed for every square foot of crown projected. It is also recommended for irrigated trees to have a low-volume drip irrigation. Cornell also suggests a minimum of 24” to 36” for CU-Structural Soil depth and they have established no minimum for length and width of installation, however, because it is a structural soil it was designed to go under the entire pavement area. Testing has shown that structural soil is safe around utilities and that you can use trees from any production system such as balled-and-bur lapped, bare root, containerized and boxed trees.&lt;ref name="nina"/&gt;&lt;ref name="second"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Day,S.d,and S.B. Dickinson (Eds.) 2008. Managing Stormwater for Urban Sustainability using Trees and Structural Soils. Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State university, Blacksburg, VA.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Continued development==
Cornell is continuing its development of CU-Structural Soil, expanding its use as the need for trees and other greenery within highly urbanized areas grows. CU-Structural Soil has been used in over 1000 applications and has been proven a very viable option for construction in cities.&lt;ref name="second"/&gt;

'''''The Wright Brothers''''' is a 2015 non-fiction book written by the popular historian [[David McCullough]] and published by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]].  It is a history of the American inventors and aviation pioneers [[Wright brothers|Orville and Wilbur Wright]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Okrent |first=Daniel |authorlink=Daniel Okrent |title='The Wright Brothers,' by David McCullough |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 4, 2015 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/10/books/review/the-wright-brothers-by-david-mccullough.html |accessdate=August 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book was on [[The New York Times Non-Fiction Best Sellers of 2015|''The New York Times'' Non-Fiction Best Sellers list]] for seven weeks in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Whitall |first=Susan |title=First in flight: David McCullough's 'Wright Brothers' |work=[[The Detroit News]] |date=June 23, 2015 |url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/books/2015/05/22/pulitzer-winner-david-mccullough-discuss-book-wright-brothers-henry-ford/27821419/ |accessdate=August 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
McCullough first became interested in writing a book on the Wright brothers while researching for his book ''[[The Greater Journey]]'', which explored the history of various notable Americans who lived in [[Paris]] during the [[19th century]].  In an interview with ''[[The Seattle Times]]'', McCullough recalled, "I didn't know when (chronologically) I was going to end that book, and who do I run into in France but the Wright brothers."  He continued, "I was delighted to find that Wilbur, at every chance, went to the [[Louvre]] to look at paintings, and the degree that he was moved by the great [[Gothic art|Gothic]] works of France was far beyond that of an ordinary tourist.  [...]  Much of what has been written about the Wright brothers (in French) has been ignored. That's what pulled me into doing the book."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gwinn |first=Mary Ann |title=Q&amp;A: David McCullough spills some secrets of 'The Wright Brothers' |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=June 14, 2015 |url=http://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/books/qa-david-mccullough-spills-some-secrets-of-the-wright-brothers/ |accessdate=August 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McCullough has had a lifelong interest in aviation.  In an interview with the ''[[Santa Barbara Independent]]'', he remarked, "I loved to make model airplanes when I was a young boy and I took flying lessons later on; I would have continued if they weren’t so expensive. But I have to say in all candor that I knew very little about [the Wright brothers]. I knew they were from Ohio, I knew they were bicycles mechanics, and I knew they invented the airplane. But I really didn’t know anything beyond that of any substance..."  He added, "Once I got into their lives and into all that they went through and the truly admirable human qualities that they personified, I would have wanted to write the book even if they hadn't succeeded in inventing the flying machine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Drown |first=Michelle |title=David McCullough Talks the Wright Brothers: Pulitzer Prize-Winning Author Explains Birth of the Airplane |work=[[Santa Barbara Independent]] |date=September 24, 2015 |url=http://www.independent.com/news/2015/sep/24/david-mccullough-talks-wright-brothers/ |accessdate=August 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''The Wright Brothers'' has been praised by literary critics and historians.  [[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' described it as a "concise, exciting and fact-packed book [that] sees the easy segue between bicycling and aerial locomotion, which at that point was mostly a topic for bird fanciers and dreamers."  She added, "Mr. McCullough presents all this with dignified panache, and with detail so granular you may wonder how it was all collected."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Maslin |first=Janet |authorlink=Janet Maslin |title=Review: The Wright Brothers' by David McCullough |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 3, 2015 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/04/books/review-the-wright-brothers-by-david-mccullough.html |accessdate=August 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', the novelist [[James Salter]] wrote, "Having twice won both the [[National Book Award]] and the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for his best-selling histories and biographies, McCullough is a much-loved dean of Americana, and his new book, a dual biography, has a warm appeal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Salter |first=James |authorlink=James Salter |title=They Began a New Era |work=[[The New York Review of Books]] |date=August 13, 2015 |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2015/08/13/wright-brothers-they-began-new-era/ |accessdate=August 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Writing in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', [[Reeve Lindbergh]], daughter of the famed aviator [[Charles Lindbergh]], called ''The Wright Brothers'' a "superb new book" and wrote, "McCullough's magical account of their early adventures — enhanced by volumes of family correspondence, written records, and his own deep understanding of the country and the era — shows as never before how two Ohio boys from a remarkable family taught the world to fly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lindbergh |first=Reeve |title=David McCullough turns his attention to the Wright brothers |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=May 8, 2015 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/how-two-ohio-boys-taught-the-world-to-fly/2015/05/06/ef150572-d711-11e4-8103-fa84725dbf9d_story.html |accessdate=August 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bruce Watson of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' observed, "''The Wright Brothers'' will do more than help Americans tell Orville from Wilbur. Fighting the persistent myth of invention's 'aha' moment, McCullough shows the importance of experiment, error and inspiration in nature. Although they studied early gliders, Orville and Wilbur also watched birds. 'Learning the secret of flight from a bird,' Orville said, 'is a good deal like learning the secret of magic from a magician.' Likewise, to learn history from a master storyteller is to relive the past."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Watson |first=Bruce |title='The Wright Brothers,' by David McCullough |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=June 21, 2015 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/books/article/The-Wright-Brothers-by-David-McCullough-6334101.php |accessdate=August 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bob Hoover of the ''[[Star Tribune]]'' was slightly more critical of the work, remarking, "Although this new biography, ''The Wright Brothers'', refreshes their often-told story in McCullough's upbeat, minutely researched manner, something's lacking — interesting characters. While the brothers accomplished their goal of powered flight, they missed out on the stuff that makes life interesting — relationships, children, hobbies, fun and, most of all, self-reflection."  He concluded, "Despite their old-fashioned manners and plain style, the Wright brothers were reticent and difficult people, traits that McCullough seemed unwilling to explore in his search for the virtues and strengths he values so much in American life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hoover |first=Bob |title=Review: 'The Wright Brothers,' by David McCullough, doesn't really take off |work=[[Star Tribune]] |date=May 15, 2015 |url=http://www.startribune.com/review-the-wright-brothers-by-david-mccullough-doesn-t-really-take-off/303917981/ |accessdate=August 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Buzzy Jackson of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' similarly described it as "a tidy and relatively short history" of the Wright brothers and praised the author's attention to detail, despite noting, "While there is much to like here, McCullough's gee-whiz attitude toward America's favorite flying Boy Scouts does feel a bit retro."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Jackson |first=Buzzy |title='The Wright Brothers' by David McCullough |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=May 23, 2015 |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/books/2015/05/23/the-wright-brothers-david-mccullough/2RQ61B6xc80Onr155OYO8L/story.html |accessdate=August 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="938">'''Udhcpc''' is a very small [[DHCP]] client program geared towards [[embedded systems]].  The letters are an abbreviation for Micro - DHCP - Client (µDHCPc). The program tries to be fully functional and [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2131 RFC 2131] compliant.

It was once packaged with a similarly small DHCP server program named '''udhcpd''', with the package called '''udhcp'''.  It is now maintained as part of [[Busybox]].

Built for [[uClibc]], the client executable is around 18k.

The program accepts all options on the command line, and calls external scripts to handle the configuration of interfaces.

Udhcp was originally developed in 1999 by Matthew Ramsay and distributed under the [[GNU GPL]] by Moreton Bay.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linuxjournal.com/node/3965/print Linux Journal PPTP Implementation]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2416">A '''unitized regenerative fuel cell''' (URFC) is a [[fuel cell]] based on the [[proton exchange membrane]] which can do the [[electrolysis of water]] in [[Regenerative fuel cell|regenerative mode]] and function in the other mode as a fuel cell recombining oxygen and [[hydrogen gas]] to produce electricity. Both modes are done with the same fuel cell stack&lt;ref&gt;[http://pdf.aiaa.org/preview/CDReadyMIECEC03_846/PV2003_5939.pdf The unitized regenerative fuel cell]&lt;/ref&gt;

By definition, the process of any fuel cell could be reversed. However, a given device is usually optimized for operating in one mode and may not be built in such a way that it can be operated backwards. Fuel cells operated backwards generally do not make very efficient systems unless they are purpose-built to do so as in [[High pressure electrolysis|high pressure electrolyzers]], unitized regenerative fuel cells and [[regenerative fuel cell]]s.

==History==
[[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|Livermore]] physicist Fred Mitlitsky studied the possibilities of reversible technology.  In the mid-1990s  Mitlitsky received some funding from [[NASA]] for development of [[NASA Helios|Helios]] and from the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] for leveling peak and intermittent power usage with sources such as solar cells or wind turbines. By 1996 he produced a 50-watt prototype single proton-exchange membrane cell which operated for 1,700 ten-minute charge-discharge cycles, and degradation was less than a few percent at the highest current densities. A rated power of 18.5&amp;nbsp;kW&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/news/NewsReleases/2003/03-33.html NASA Press Release June 24 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; URFC  was installed in the Helios and was tested on-board during test flights in 2003. The aircraft unfortunately crashed on its second URFC test flight June 26, 2003.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14324">'''Voice logging''' is the practice of regularly recording telephone conversations. Business sectors which often do voice logging include public safety (e.g. [[9-1-1]] and emergency response systems), customer service call centers (conversations are recorded for quality assurance purposes), and finance (e.g. telephone-initiated stock trades are recorded for compliance purposes).  Although voice logging is usually performed on conventional telephone lines, it is also frequently used for recording open microphones (e.g. on a stock trading floor) and for broadcast radio.

Early voice loggers recorded [[Plain old telephone service|POTS]] lines onto analog magnetic tape.  As telephony became more digital, so did voice loggers, and starting in the 1990s, voice loggers digitized the audio using a [[codec]] and recorded to digital tape.  With modern [[VoIP]] systems, many voice loggers now simply store calls to a file on a hard drive.

==History==
The original voice logging system was a large analog [[tape recorder]] developed by Magnasync in 1950.  In 1953, Magnasync Corporation sold 300 voice loggers to the U.S. Air Force.  Later systems were designed and manufactured by Arcane logger, ASC, [[Comverse]], Cybertech, [[Dictaphone]], [[Eventide, Inc|Eventide]], Eyretel, Mercom, [[NICE Systems|NICE]], [[Racal]], [[Verint Systems|Verint]], and Witness.  Over the years, there has been substantial consolidation in the field and current major vendors include [https://www.asctechnologies.com ASC], [[NICE Systems|NICE]], Red Box, [[Verint Systems|Verint]].

==Types of Voice Loggers==

* '''Analog tape''': the oldest models use [[Reel to reel|reel-to-reel]] tape to record multiple phone lines to multiple tracks on the tape.  Simple recorders also exist which use individual [[Compact Cassette|cassette]] or [[microcassette]] tape recorders on each individual phone.  Later analog systems recorded 64 simultaneous phone calls onto a [[VHS]] cartridge.
* '''Digital tape (or recordable disk)''': These are the most commonly used today. They typically consist of proprietary hardware which is attached to the trunk lines for the enterprise (typically [[Plain old telephone service|POTS]], [[T-carrier|T1]], or [[E-carrier|E1]] lines).  Later systems often consist of a PC motherboard with specialized interface hardware in a PCI slot.  Digital systems also record detailed metadata about recorded calls, including start/stop timestamps, extension number or name, dialed [[DTMF]] tones, [[Caller ID]], [[DNIS]], and more. Many systems allow administrators to listen to live conversations or to access records from any remote location over a LAN.  In addition, analytical tools are available which allow searching and quality reporting.
* '''Software-only systems''': These systems may be all-software running on industry-standard servers, or use hardware such as a sound card on a PC, to do the work of recording and monitoring telephone calls.  Some are simple single-user systems that typically only require a user to install the software on their PC, and use some type of simple adapter to connect the PC to a phone. However this type of software can usually only record a single line at a time, and is much more limited in features.  Business-class recording and monitoring systems enable businesses of all sizes to deploy centralized call recording and monitoring for IP telephony systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1234">'''Wartime reserve modes''' (abbreviated as '''WARM''') are [[military]] procedures held in reserve for [[war]]time or emergency use. They concern the characteristics and operating procedures of sensor, [[Military communications|communications]], navigation aids, threat recognition, weapons, and [[countermeasure]]s systems. Since the military effectiveness of these procedures links to them being unknown to or misunderstood by opposing commanders before they are used, stopping their use by making them reserved has the effect of helping to ensure they remain effective by making it difficult for them to be known about in advance by such opposing commanders. This prevents them being exploited or neutralized.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA439918&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf US Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms (As Amended Through 31 August 2005) (PDF) pp. 575–6].&lt;/ref&gt;
