== Views ==
===Kuwaiti vision 2035===
Al-Salloum believes that Kuwaiti Vision 2035 has not followed the minimum standards of the [[Sustainable Development Goals|sustainable development]] vision concept. His rationale was based on the insufficient methodology used to set the goals of that vision; by which a vision is just a collection of goals that will definitely be achieved once previously planned giant and large projects are executed. Hence, this vision would not require a real strategy to follow other than waiting.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===Saudi vision 2030===
Unlike Kuwaiti Vision 2035, Al-Salloum sees [[Saudi Vision 2030]] as a vision that follows reasonable standards of the [[Sustainable Development Goals|sustainable development]] vision concept; defending most of its strategies in a book of six chapters.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The reason behind having Al-Salloum focusing on the [[Economy of Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabian economy]] is the belief that [[Economy of Kuwait|Kuwait's economy]], once sustainable, will be attached to the closest largest economy, [[Economy of Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabian]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===Diversified economy===
Al-Salloum's advised that following the leads of [[Macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] theories will be of an added value in moving the [[Gulf Cooperation Council|GCC]] economy from oil-based to diversified. Except for [[Kuwait]], the [[decision-making]] process in all other [[Gulf Cooperation Council|GCC]] is [[Centralized government|centralized]], where following those leads – in a direct manner – can be feasibly accomplished. For [[Kuwait]]'s case, however, and because of the very [[Democracy|distributed]] [[Decision-making|decision-making process]] made by [[democracy]], following those leads to have an effective economic reform must have a prior political reform.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

* [[Kuwait of the Sustainability]] ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: كويت الاستدامة): (Subtitled: ''Vision of a people, from and to them. -'' [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: رؤية شعب، منه وإليه.) ({{ISBN|978-1732537538}}) A political economic book that extensively highlights the [[Economy of Kuwait|Kuwaiti economy]] in particular, aiming at clarifying the concept of sound economic vision through radical solutions targeting [[Macroeconomics|macro­-economic]] issues of the state. In this title, which is introduced with appraisals by Prof. Ghanim Al­-Najjar – the political science professor at Kuwait University –, Ali Al­-Sanad, Ph.D. – the Islamic studies professor at the General Authority for Applied Education and Training –, and Mr. Mohammed Al­-Yousifi – the historical researcher and political analyst –, Al-Salloum looks forward to raise the awareness of the economic sense; in a way that makes individuals see and understand the consequences of political and administrative decision-making outcomes, build their own view and critical opinion while being fully aware of the subject matter. The title concludes that moving Kuwait from rent to sustainability requires a major reform at the [[Macroeconomics|macro-economic]] level, a reform whose impact would wipe all [[Political corruption|political]], [[Organizational behavior|organizational behavioral]], and [[Microeconomics|micro-economic]] obstacles facing the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://alqabas.com/607018/|title=Al-Salloum issues "Kuwait of the Sustainability"|last=Alqabas|first=Newspaper|date=|work=alqabas.com|access-date=2018-11-26|language=ar}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://al-seyassah.com/%D9%83%D9%88%D9%8A%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A9-%D8%B1%D8%A4%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%88%D8%B7%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%84%D8%A5%D8%B5%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AD-%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%AA/|title=Kuwait of the Sustainability: National vision for a real economic reform|last=Al-Seyassah|first=Newspaper|date=2018-11-14|work=al-seyassah.com|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dasmannews.com/2018/11/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%84%D9%88%D9%85-%D9%8A%D8%B5%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D9%83%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%A7-%D8%A8%D8%B9%D9%86%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%83%D9%88%D9%8A%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%AF/|title=Abdullah Al-Salloum Issues The Title "Kuwait of the Sustainability"|last=DasmanNews|first=Newspaper|date=2018-11-24|work=dasmannews.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://almada.cc/?p=335854|title=Abdullah Al-Salloum issues "Kuwait of the Sustainability"|last=Kuwaiti Almada|first=Newspaper|date=2018-11-24|work=almada.cc|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

[[File:ASQ Registration booth 2010.jpg|thumb|ASQ registration booth at [[America's Center]] in [[St. Louis]] for the 2010 meeting on 24 May]]
The '''American Society for Quality''' ('''ASQ'''), formerly the '''American Society for Quality Control''' ('''ASQC'''), is a knowledge-based global community of quality professionals, with nearly 80,000 members dedicated to promoting and advancing quality tools, principles, and practices in their workplaces and communities.

==History==
ASQC was established on February 16, 1946 by 253 members in [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]], with [[George D. Edwards]] as its first president. The organization was first created as a way for quality experts and manufacturers to sustain quality-improvement techniques used during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://asq.org/about-asq/asq-timeline|title=The ASQ Timeline {{!}} ASQ|website=asq.org|access-date=2018-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archives.library.illinois.edu/asq/asqhistory.html|title=ASQ Archives - A Brief History of ASQ|website=archives.library.illinois.edu|access-date=2018-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, ASQC's Code of Ethics establishes standards for members to conduct their activities and business.

In 1997, the members of the organization voted to change its name from "American Society for Quality Control" to "American Society for Quality".&lt;ref&gt;[http://aqlinspectorsrule.com/Z1-4-2013.html AQL Inspector's Rule], accessed 28 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, ASQ is a global organization with members in more than 130 countries. ASQ operates regional centers in North Asia, South Asia, Latin America, the Middle East/Africa and has established strategic alliances with 28 organizations through the World Partners® Program&lt;ref name="World Partners® {{!}} ASQ"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://asq.org/global/world-partner-program|title=World Partners® {{!}} ASQ|website=asq.org|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; in countries like Brazil, Canada, and the United Arab Emirates to promote ASQ products and training.&lt;ref name="World Partners® {{!}} ASQ"/&gt;

== Quality ==
ASQ provides its members with [[professional certification|certification]], training, publications, conferences, and other services. Internationally, ASQ has formed relationships with [[nonprofit organization]]s that have comparable missions and principles, forming collaborative efforts to meet the quality needs of companies, individuals, and organizations. ASQ is a founding partner of the [[American Customer Satisfaction Index]] (ACSI), a quarterly [[economic indicator]].

Since 1989,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://asq.org/newsroom/news-releases/2013/20131203-malcolm-baldrige-national-quality-award.html|title=ASQ Receives New Contract for Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award|website=asq.org|language=en-us|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; ASQ has administered the annual [[Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://asq.org/learn-about-quality/malcolm-baldrige-award/overview/overview.html | title=Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award (MBNQA) | publisher=ASQ | accessdate=March 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JTMI"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://scielo.conicyt.cl/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0718-27242009000100012 | title=Measuring Excellence: A Closer Look at Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award Winners in the Manufacturing Category | author=Brian Cazzell, Jeffrey M.

==Certifications==
ASQ offers 18 professional certifications relating to various aspects of the quality profession. Exams are given nationally and, to a limited degree, worldwide several times annually. The [[body of knowledge]] for each certification is maintained through [[peer review]] every few years on a rotating schedule.

In 1968, the first ASQ certification was offered.&lt;ref name="won"&gt;Newcomb, William O. "ASQ Certification: A Brief History". ''Quality Progress''. January 2010. p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://videos.asq.org/asq-certification-at-50|title=ASQ Certification at 50|website=ASQTV|language=en|access-date=2018-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, ASQ's certification exam delivery method changed from paper to computer based testing at Prometric nationwide testing facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://asq.org/cert/computer-based-testing|title=Quality Certification Computer Based Testing by Prometric {{!}} ASQ|website=asq.org|access-date=2018-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prometric.com/en-us/clients/asq/Pages/landing.aspx|title=Home|website=www.prometric.com|language=en-us|access-date=2018-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Biotechnology Regulatory Authority of India (BRAI)''' is a proposed regulatory body in India for uses of biotechnology products including [[genetically modified organism]]s (GMOs).&lt;ref name=press_rel/&gt; The institute was first suggested under the Biotechnology Regulatory Authority of India (BRAI) draft bill prepared by the [[Department of Biotechnology]] in 2008.&lt;ref name=ver2008&gt;{{cite web|title=Draft: National Biotechnology Regulatory Bill, 2008|url=https://www.indiaoppi.com/sites/default/files/PDF%20files/DRAFT%20NATIONAL%20BIOTECHNOLOGY%20REGULATORY%20BILL,%202008.PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, it has undergone several revisions.&lt;ref name=2010_limbo&gt;{{cite news|title=BRAI Bill leaves biotech commercialisation in limbo|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/brai-bill-leaves-biotech-commercialisation-in-limbo/article621692.ece|accessdate=24 March 2014|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=9 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The bill has faced opposition from farmer groups and anti-GMO activists.&lt;ref name=suman_sahai&gt;{{cite news|title=Activists oppose Biotechnology Regulatory Authority of India bill|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/ahmedabad/report-activists-oppose-biotechnology-regulatory-authority-of-india-bill-1858894|accessdate=24 March 2014|newspaper=[[DNA India]]|date=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=no_brai_plz&gt;{{cite news|title=No BRAI Bill, Please|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/no-brai-bill-please/article5052683.ece|accessdate=24 March 2014|newspaper=[[Business Line]]|date=23 August 2013|author=Shaheen Contractor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
On 23 January 2003, India ratified the [[Cartagena Protocol]] which protects [[biodiversity]] from potential risks of [[genetically modified organism]]s, the products of modern biotechnology. The protocol requires setting up of a regulatory body.&lt;ref name=CPB&gt;{{cite web |title=Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety (CPB) |url=https://www.moef.nic.in/division/cartagena-protocol-biosafety-cpb |publisher=[[Ministry of Environment and Forests (India)]] |accessdate=24 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707010921/http://www.moef.nic.in/division/cartagena-protocol-biosafety-cpb |archivedate=7 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the Genetic Engineering Approvals Committee, a body under the [[Ministry of Environment and Forests (India)]] is responsible for approval of genetically engineered products in India. If the bill is passed, the responsibility will be taken over by the Environment Appraisal Panel, a sub-division of the BRAI.&lt;ref name=2010_limbo/&gt;

According to the bill, BRAI will have a Chairperson, two full-time members and two part-time members; all will be required to have expertise in [[life science]]s and biotechnology in agriculture, health care, environment and general biology. The bill also proposes setting up an inter-ministerial  governing body, to oversee the performance of BRAI, and a National Biotechnology Advisory Council of stakeholders to provide feedback on the use of  [[biotechnology]] products and organisms in the society.&lt;ref name=press_rel/&gt; The regulatory body will be an autonomous and statutory agency to regulate the research, transport, import, and manufacture [[biotechnology]] products and organisms.&lt;ref name=press_rel&gt;{{cite web|title=Regulatory Authority to be Set Up on Bio-Technology|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=84347|publisher=Press Information Bureau, [[Government of India]]|accessdate=24 March 2014|date=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

[[Suman Sahai]], founder of the [[Gene Campaign]], has called the bill flawed. According to her, the bill is proposing new institutes without clearly defining their powers and responsibilities. She has also stated that the bill was introduced without consulting the people who will be affected by the bill.&lt;ref name=suman_sahai/&gt; 

[[P. M. Bhargava]], founder of the [[Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology]], has also opposed the bill. He has called the bill unconstitutional, as agricultural policy is the domain of state governments. He pointed out that the bill proposes formation of several subdivisions and has argued that they will consist of bureaucrats with no scientific knowledge. He has accused the [[Department of Biotechnology]], which will be involved in selection of members, as a promoter of genetic technology in India. He has pointed out that the broadly defined term "confidential commercial information" has been kept outside the purview of the [[Right to Information Act]]. He had stated that the bill uses vague wordings which would criminalize sequencing or isolation of DNA and PCR techniques, requiring approval for each usage. Thus, hindering research and education. He pointed out the bill has no provision for mandatory labelling of GM foods. He criticized giving the body power to punish parties making false or misleading statements about GM crops, calling it unprecedented.&lt;ref name=bhargava&gt;{{cite news|title=Unconstitutional, unethical, unscientific|url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/unconstitutional-unethical-unscientific/article2752711.ece|accessdate=24 March 2014|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=5 January 2012|author=[[Pushpa Mittra Bhargava|Pushpa M. Bhargava]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In September 2010, [[Jairam Ramesh]], then Environment Minister, pointed out that the body is only deals with safety and efficacy of biotechnology products. The issue of commercialization has been left unaddressed. The decisions regarding commercialization can fall under the purview of [[Ministry of Environment and Forests (India)|Ministry of Environment and Forests]], [[Ministry of Health]], [[Ministry of Agriculture]], or [[Department of Science and Technology (India)|Department of Science and Technology]].&lt;ref name=2010_limbo/&gt;

On the other hand, [[Association of Biotechnology Led Enterprises]] (ABLE) has supported the bill. J.S. Rehman, an entomologist and a former member of the Review Committee on Genetic Manipulation, has stated that most protesters associate genetic engineering with [[Monsanto]], as a result development of Indian biotech is being hindered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Let’s unMonsanto the debate|url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/blogs/blogs-the-copernican/article5085741.ece|accessdate=1 April 2014|date=2 September 2013|author=Vasudevan Mukunth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Direktorium LDE.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|A meeting of a board of directors of the [[Leipzig–Dresden Railway Company]] in 1852]]
{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2013 }}

A '''board of directors''' is a recognized group of people who jointly oversee the activities of an [[organization]], which can be either a for-profit [[business]], [[nonprofit organization]], or a [[government agency]]. Such a board's powers, duties, and responsibilities are determined by government [[regulations]] (including the jurisdiction's [[corporations law]]) and the organization's own [[constitution]] and [[bylaws]]. These authorities may specify the number of members of the board, how they are to be chosen, and how often they are to meet.

In an organization with voting members, the board is accountable to, and might be subordinate to, the organization's full membership, which usually vote for the members of the board. In a [[stock corporation]], non-executive directors are voted for by the [[shareholder]]s and the board is the highest [[authority]] in the management of the corporation. The board of directors appoints the [[chief executive officer]] of the corporation and sets out the overall strategic direction. In corporations with dispersed ownership, the identification and nomination of directors (that shareholders vote for or against) are often done by the board itself, leading to a high degree of self-perpetuation. In a [[non-stock corporation]] with no general voting membership, the board is the supreme governing body of the institution;{{sfn|Robert|2011|p=9}} its members are sometimes chosen by the board itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.scc.virginia.gov/clk/befaq/vanon.aspx#a4 | title = How are the directors selected? | accessdate = 2011-04-08 | work = Commonwealth of Virginia, State Corporation Commission, Business FAQs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/Stat0181.pdf | title = Chapter 181, Nonstock Corporations (Sect. 181.0804) | accessdate = 2011-04-08 | work = Wisconsin Statutes Database }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
Other names include '''board of directors and advisors''', '''[[board of governors]]''', '''board of managers''', '''[[Board of Regents|board of regents]]''', '''board of [[trustees]]''', or '''board of visitors'''. It may also be called "the executive board" and is often simply referred to as "the board".{{sfn|Robert|2011|p=481-483}}

==Roles==
{{Business administration}}
Typical duties of boards of directors include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.managementhelp.org/boards/brdrspon.htm |title=Overview of Roles and Responsibilities of Corporate Board of Directors |accessdate=2008-01-26 |last=McNamara |first=Carter |work=Free Management Library |publisher=Authenticity Consulting, LLC }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iog.ca/boardgovernance/html/gov_the.html |title=Basic Role of the Board |accessdate=2008-01-27 |work=Governance Basics |publisher=Institute on Governance (Canada) |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071230201729/http://www.iog.ca/boardgovernance/html/gov_the.html |archivedate = 30 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* governing the organization by establishing broad policies and setting out strategic objectives;
* selecting, appointing, supporting and reviewing the performance of the [[chief executive]] (of which the titles vary from organization to organization; the chief executive may be titled [[chief executive officer]], [[President (corporate title)|president]] or [[executive director]]);
* terminating the chief executive;
* ensuring the availability of adequate financial resources;
* approving annual budgets;
* accounting to the [[Project stakeholder|stakeholder]]s for the organization's performance;
* setting the salaries, compensation and benefits of senior management;

The legal responsibilities of boards and board members vary with the nature of the organization, and between  jurisdictions. For [[public corporations|companies with publicly trading stock]], these responsibilities are typically much more rigorous and complex than for those of other types.

Typically, the board chooses one of its members to be the ''[[chairman]]'' (often now called the "chair" or "chairperson"), who holds whatever title is specified in the [[by-law]]s or [[articles of association]]. However, in membership organizations, the members elect the president of the organization and the president becomes the board chair, unless the by-laws say otherwise.{{sfn|Robert|2011|p=484}}

==Directors==
The directors of an organization are the persons who are members of its board. Several specific terms categorize directors by the presence or absence of their other relationships to the organization.&lt;ref&gt;This section was developed from numerous definitions in [http://definitions.uslegal.com/i/inside-director/ USLegal.com], [http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/executive-director.html BusinessDictionary.com], [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/executive+director Dictionary.com], The Free Dictionary by Farlex ([http://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Inside+Director "inside director"]; [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/executive+director "executive director"]; [http://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/outside+director "outside director"]; [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/nonexecutive+director "nonexecutive director"]), [http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/executive-director Macmillan Dictionary], and  [http://www.economics-dictionary.com/definition/non-executive-director.html Economics-dictionary.com]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inside director===
An inside director is a director who is also an employee, officer, chief executive, major [[shareholder]], or someone similarly connected to the organization. Inside directors represent the interests of the entity's [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]], and often have special knowledge of its inner workings, its financial or market position, and so on.

Typical inside directors are:
* A [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) who may also be [[Chairman|chairman of the board]]
* Other executives of the organization, such as its [[chief financial officer]] (CFO) or [[executive vice president]]
* Large shareholders (who may or may not also be employees or officers)
* Representatives of other stakeholders such as labor unions, major lenders, or members of the community in which the organization is located

An inside director who is employed as a manager or executive of the organization is sometimes referred to as an executive director (not to be confused with the title [[executive director]] sometimes used for the CEO position in some organizations). Executive directors often have a specified area of responsibility in the organization, such as finance, marketing, human resources, or production.&lt;ref name=Ivestopedia&gt;{{cite web|title=Executive Director|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/executive-director.asp|publisher=Investopedia|accessdate=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outside director===
{{Main|Independent director}}

An outside director is a member of the board who is not otherwise employed by or engaged with the organization, and does not represent any of its stakeholders. A typical example is a director who is [[President (corporate title)|president]] of a firm in a different industry.&lt;ref name="Investopedia 2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Outside Director|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outsidedirector.asp|publisher=Investopedia|accessdate=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside directors are not employees of the company or affiliated with it in any other way.

Outside directors bring outside experience and perspectives to the board. For example, for a company that only serves a domestic market, the presence of CEOs from global multinational corporations as outside directors can help to provide insights on export and import opportunities and international trade options. One of the arguments for having outside directors is that they can keep a watchful eye on the inside directors and on the way the organization is run. Outside directors are unlikely to tolerate "insider dealing" between insider directors, as outside directors do not benefit from the company or organization. Outside directors are often useful in handling disputes between inside directors, or between shareholders and the board. They are thought to be advantageous because they can be objective and present little risk of conflict of interest. On the other hand, they might lack familiarity with the specific issues connected to the organization's governance and they might not know about the industry or sector in which the organization is operating.

===Terminology {{anchor|Classification}}===
*'''Director''' – a person appointed to serve on the board of an organization, such as an institution or business.
*'''Inside director''' – a director who, in addition to serving on the board, has a meaningful connection to the organization
*'''[[Outside director]]''' – a director who, other than serving on the board, has no meaningful connections to the organization
*'''Executive director''' – an inside director who is also an executive with the organization. The term is also used, in a completely different sense, to refer to a CEO
*'''[[Non-executive director]]''' – an inside director who is not an executive with the organization
*'''Shadow or ''de facto'' director''' – an individual who is not a named director but who nevertheless directs or controls the organization
* '''Nominee director''' – an individual who is appointed by a shareholder, creditor or interest group (whether contractually or by resolution at a company meeting) and who has a continuing loyalty to the appointor/s or other interest in the appointing company

Individual directors often serve on more than one board.&lt;ref name=Businessdictionary&gt;{{cite web|title=Executive Director |url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/executive-director.html|work=Business Dictionary|accessdate=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice results in an [[interlocking directorate]], where a relatively small number of individuals have significant influence over a large number of important entities. This situation can have important corporate, social, economic, and legal consequences, and has been the subject of significant research.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==Process and structure==

{{Globalise/US | section|date=May 2018}}

The process for running a board, sometimes called the [[board process]], includes the selection of board members, the setting of clear board objectives, the dissemination of documents or board package to the board members, the collaborative creation of an [[Agenda (meeting)|agenda]] for the meeting, the creation and follow-up of assigned [[action items]], and the assessment of the board process through standardized assessments of board members, owners, and CEOs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slideshare.net/nasscom/how-to-make-corporate-board-more-effective-prof-krishna-g-palepuharvard-business-school Board Process] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220142343/http://www.slideshare.net/nasscom/how-to-make-corporate-board-more-effective-prof-krishna-g-palepuharvard-business-school |date=20 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The science of this process has been slow to develop due to the secretive nature of the way most companies run their boards, however some standardization is beginning to develop. Some who are pushing for this standardization in the USA are the [[National Association of Corporate Directors]], [[McKinsey &amp; Company|McKinsey]] Consulting and The Board Group.

===Board meetings===
[[File:Board room at the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication.jpg|thumb|Typical board room setting]]
A board of directors conducts its meetings according to the rules and procedures contained in its governing documents. These procedures may allow the board to conduct its business by [[conference call]] or other [[Videoconferencing|electronic]] means.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#19|title = Frequently Asked Questions about RONR (Question 19)|date = |accessdate = 2015-12-24|website = The Official Robert's Rules of Order Web Site|publisher = The Robert's Rules Association|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170715132111/http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#19|archivedate = 15 July 2017|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may also specify how a [[quorum]] is to be determined.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Most organizations have adopted ''[[Robert's Rules of Order]]'' as its guide to supplement its own rules{{where|date=November 2016}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.parliamentarians.org/about/faq/|title = National Association of Parliamentarians &gt;&gt; FAQ|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |quote = ". . . the 11th edition of Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised is the current edition of the most widely used reference for meeting procedure and business rules in the English-speaking world."}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this book, the rules for conducting board meetings may be less formal if there is no more than about a dozen board members present.{{sfn|Robert|2011|p=9-10,487-488}} An example of the informality is that [[Motion (parliamentary procedure)|motions]] are not required if it's clear what is being discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised In Brief|last = Robert III|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82019-9|location = Philadelphia, PA|pages = 158|edition = 2nd|url = http://www.robertsrules.com/inbrief.html|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Size ===
Historically, nonprofit boards have not uncommonly had large boards with up to twenty-four members, but a modern trend is to have smaller boards as small as six or seven people.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://perma.cc/NWK6-E3CC|title=For Nonprofit Boards, Smaller is Better|last=White|first=Cyrus|date=|website=perma.cc|publisher=The South Cabin Group LLC|access-date=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies suggest that after seven people, each additional person reduces the effectiveness of [[group decision-making]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Non-corporate boards==
The role and responsibilities of a board of directors vary depending on the nature and type of business entity and the laws applying to the entity (see [[types of business entity]]). For example, the nature of the business entity may be one that is traded on a public market (public company), not traded on a public market (a private, limited or closely held company), owned by family members (a family business), or exempt from income taxes (a non-profit, not for profit, or tax-exempt entity). There are numerous types of business entities available throughout the world such as a corporation, limited liability company, cooperative, business trust, partnership, private limited company, and public limited company.

Much of what has been written about boards of directors relates to boards of directors of business entities actively traded on public markets.&lt;ref&gt;See generally, Bowen, William G., The board book: an insider's guide for directors and trustees (2008 W.W. Norton &amp; Co.); Murray, Alan S., Revolt in the boardroom: the new rules of power in corporate America (2007 Collins); Charan, Ram, Boards that deliver: advancing corporate governance from compliance to competitive advantage (2005 Jossey-Bass); Carver, John, Corporate boards that create value: governing company performance from the boardroom (2002 Jossey-Bass); Harvard Business Review on corporate governance (2000 Harvard Business School Press).&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, however, material is becoming available for boards of private and closely held businesses including family businesses.&lt;ref&gt;See specifically Tutelman and Hause, The Balance Point: New Ways Business Owners Can Use Boards (2008 Famille Press).&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[board-only]] organization is one whose board is self-appointed, rather than being accountable to a base of members through elections; or in which the powers of the membership are extremely limited.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===Membership organizations===
In [[Voluntary association|membership organizations]], such as a society made up of members of a certain profession or one advocating a certain cause, a board of directors may have the responsibility of running the organization in between meetings of the membership, especially if the membership meets infrequently, such as only at an [[annual general meeting]].{{sfn|Robert|2011|p=481–483}} The amount of powers and authority delegated to the board depend on the bylaws and rules of the particular organization. Some organizations place matters exclusively in the board's control while in others, the general membership retains full power and the board can only make recommendations.{{sfn|Robert|2011|p=481-483}}

The setup of a board of directors vary widely across organizations and may include provisions that are applicable to corporations, in which the "shareholders" are the members of the organization. A difference may be that the membership elects the officers of the organization, such as the president and the secretary, and the officers become members of the board in addition to the directors and retain those duties on the board.{{sfn|Robert|2011|p=484}} The directors may also be classified as officers in this situation.{{sfn|Robert|2011|p=572}} There may also be ex-officio members of the board, or persons who are members due to another position that they hold. These ex-officio members have all the same rights as the other board members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#2|title = Frequently Asked Questions about RONR (Question 2)|date = |accessdate = 2015-12-24|website = The Official Robert's Rules of Order Web Site|publisher = The Robert's Rules Association|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170715132111/http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#2|archivedate = 15 July 2017|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the board may be removed before their term is complete. Details on how they can be removed are usually provided in the bylaws. If the bylaws do not contain such details, the section on disciplinary procedures in ''[[Robert's Rules of Order]]'' may be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#20|title = Frequently Asked Questions about RONR (Question 20)|date = |accessdate = 2015-12-24|website = The Official Robert's Rules of Order Web Site|publisher = The Robert's Rules Association|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170715132111/http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#20|archivedate = 15 July 2017|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporations==
In a [[public company|publicly held company]], directors are elected to represent and are legally obligated as fiduciaries to represent owners of the company—the [[shareholder]]s/stockholders.   In this capacity they establish policies and make decisions on issues such as whether there is [[dividend]] and how much it is, [[Employee stock option|stock options]] distributed to employees, and the hiring/firing and [[Executive pay|compensation of upper management]].

===Governance===
Theoretically, the control of a company is divided between two bodies: the board of directors, and the [[shareholder]]s in [[general meeting]]. In practice, the amount of power exercised by the board varies with the type of company. In small private companies, the directors and the shareholders are normally the same people, and thus there is no real division of power. In large [[public company|public companies]], the board tends to exercise more of a supervisory role, and individual responsibility and management tends to be delegated downward to individual professional executives (such as a finance director or a marketing director) who deal with particular areas of the company's affairs.&lt;ref name=CRI&gt;[http://www.compensationresources.com/titles-associated-with-executive-compensation.php Titles Associated with Executive Compensation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917083738/http://www.compensationresources.com/titles-associated-with-executive-compensation.php |date=17 September 2012 }}| Compensation Resources Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another feature of boards of directors in large public companies is that the board tends to have more ''[[de facto]]'' power. Many shareholders grant proxies to the directors to vote their shares at general meetings and accept all recommendations of the board rather than try to get involved in management, since each shareholder's power, as well as interest and information is so small.  Larger institutional investors also grant the board proxies. The large number of shareholders also makes it hard for them to organize. However, there have been moves recently to try to increase [[shareholder activism]] among both institutional investors and individuals with small shareholdings.&lt;ref name=CRI/&gt;

A contrasting view is that in large public companies it is upper management and not boards that wield practical power, because boards delegate nearly all of their power to the top executive employees, adopting their recommendations almost without fail.  As a practical matter, executives even choose the directors, with shareholders normally following management recommendations and voting for them.

In most cases, serving on a board is not a [[career]] unto itself. For major corporations, the board members are usually professionals or leaders in their field. In the case of outside directors, they are often senior leaders of other organizations. Nevertheless, board members often receive remunerations amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars per year since they often sit on the boards of several companies. Inside directors are usually not paid for sitting on a board, but the duty is instead considered part of their larger job description. Outside directors are usually paid for their services. These remunerations vary between corporations, but usually consist of a yearly or monthly salary, additional compensation for each meeting attended, stock options, and various other benefits. such as travel, hotel and meal expenses for the board meetings. [[Tiffany &amp; Co.]], for example, pays directors an annual retainer of $46,500, an additional annual retainer of $2,500 if the director is also a chairperson of a committee, a per-meeting-attended fee of $2,000 for meetings attended in person, a $500 fee for each meeting attended via telephone, in addition to stock options and retirement benefits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://beginnersinvest.about.com/cs/a/aa2203a_2.htm Fees, CEO Evaluation, and Ownership Structure]  By Joshua Kennon, About.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Two-tier system===
In some European and [[Asia]]n countries, there are two separate boards, an executive board for day-to-day business and a [[supervisory board]] (elected by the shareholders and employees) for supervising the executive board. In these countries, the CEO (chief executive or managing director) presides over the executive board and the chairman presides over the supervisory board, and these two roles will always be held by different people. This ensures a distinction between [[management]] by the executive board and [[governance]] by the supervisory board and allows for clear lines of authority. The aim is to prevent a [[conflict of interest]] and too much power being concentrated in the hands of one person. There is a strong parallel here with the structure of government, which tends to separate the political [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] from the management [[civil service]]. In the United States, the board of directors (elected by the shareholders) is often equivalent to the supervisory board, while the executive board may often be known as the executive committee (operating committee or executive council), composed of the CEO and their direct reports (other C-level officers, division/subsidiary heads).

{{Globalise/UK | section|date=April 2016}}

The development of a separate board of directors to manage/govern/oversee a company has occurred incrementally and indefinitely over legal history. Until the end of the 19th century, it seems to have been generally assumed that the general meeting (of all shareholders) was the supreme organ of a company, and that the board of directors merely acted as an agent of the company subject to the control of the shareholders in general meeting.&lt;ref&gt;Gower, ''Principles of Company Law'' (6th ed.), citing ''[[Isle of Wight Rly Co v Tahourdin]]'' (1884) LR 25 Ch D 320&lt;/ref&gt;

However, by 1906, the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|English Court of Appeal]] had made it clear in the decision of ''[[Automatic Self-Cleansing Filter Syndicate Co Ltd v Cuninghame]]'' [1906] 2 Ch 34 that the division of powers between the board and the shareholders in general meaning depended on the construction of the [[Articles of Association (law)|articles of association]] and that, where the powers of management were vested in the board, the general meeting could not interfere with their lawful exercise. The articles were held to constitute a contract by which the members had agreed that "the directors and the directors alone shall manage."&lt;ref&gt;''Per'' Cozens-Hardy LJ at 44&lt;/ref&gt;

The new approach did not secure immediate approval, but it was endorsed by the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] in ''Quin &amp; Axtens v Salmon'' [1909] AC 442 and has since received general acceptance. Under English law, successive versions of [[Table A]] have reinforced the norm that, unless the directors are acting contrary to the law or the provisions of the Articles, the powers of conducting the management and affairs of the company are vested in them.

The modern doctrine was expressed in ''[[John Shaw &amp; Sons (Salford) Ltd v Shaw]]'' [1935] 2 KB 113 by [[Frederick Greer, 1st Baron Fairfield|Greer LJ]] as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A company is an entity distinct alike from its shareholders and its directors. Some of its powers may, according to its articles, be exercised by directors, certain other powers may be reserved for the shareholders in general meeting. If powers of management are vested in the directors, they and they alone can exercise these powers. The only way in which the general body of shareholders can control the exercise of powers by the articles in the directors is by altering the articles, or, if opportunity arises under the articles, by refusing to re-elect the directors of whose actions they disapprove. They cannot themselves usurp the powers which by the articles are vested in the directors any more than the directors can usurp the powers vested by the articles in the general body of shareholders.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It has been remarked{{by whom|date=April 2016}} that this development in the law was somewhat surprising at the time, as the relevant provisions in [[Table A]] (as it was then) seemed to contradict this approach rather than to endorse it.&lt;ref&gt;
See Gower, ''Principles of Company Law'' (6th ed.) at 185.
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Election and removal ===

{{Globalise/US | section|date=May 2018}}

In most legal systems, the appointment and removal of directors is voted upon by the shareholders in general meeting{{efn|For example, in the United Kingdom, see section 303 of the Companies Act 1985.}} or through a [[proxy statement]]. For publicly traded companies in the U.S., the directors which are available to vote on are largely selected by either the board as a whole or a [[nominating committee]].&lt;ref name="Shivdasani1999" /&gt; Although in 2002 the [[New York Stock Exchange]] and the [[NASDAQ]] required that nominating committees consist of independent directors as a condition of listing,&lt;ref&gt;Chhaochharia V, Grinstein Y. (2007). [http://faculty.fullerton.edu/jyang/Courses/fin332/Literature/governance%20rule%20result.pdf Corporate governance and firm value: The impact of the 2002 governance rules] {{webarchive |url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100611072244/http://faculty.fullerton.edu/jyang/Courses/fin332/Literature/governance%20rule%20result.pdf |date = 11 June 2010 }}. ''The Journal of Finance''.&lt;/ref&gt; nomination committees have historically received input from management in their selections even when the CEO does not have a position on the board.&lt;ref name="Shivdasani1999" /&gt; Shareholder nominations can only occur at the general meeting itself or through the prohibitively expensive process of mailing out ballots separately; in May 2009 the SEC proposed a new rule allowing shareholders meeting certain criteria to add nominees to the proxy statement.&lt;ref&gt;SEC. (May 2009). [https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2009/2009-116.htm SEC Votes to Propose Rule Amendments to Facilitate Rights of Shareholders to Nominate Directors].&lt;/ref&gt; In practice for publicly traded companies, the managers ([[inside director]]s) who are purportedly accountable to the board of directors have historically played a major role in selecting and nominating the directors who are voted on by the shareholders, in which case more "gray outsider directors" (independent directors with conflicts of interest) are nominated and elected.&lt;ref name=Shivdasani1999&gt;Shivdasani A, Yermack D. (1999). [http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~eofek/PhD/papers/SY_CEO_JF.pdf CEO involvement in the selection of new board members: An empirical analysis]. ''Journal of Finance''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Directors may also leave office by resignation or death. In some legal systems, directors may also be removed by a resolution of the remaining directors (in some countries they may only do so "with cause"; in others the power is unrestricted).

Some jurisdictions also permit the board of directors to appoint directors, either to fill a vacancy which arises on resignation or death, or as an addition to the existing directors.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

In practice, it can be quite difficult to remove a director by a resolution in general meeting. In many legal systems, the director has a right to receive special notice of any resolution to remove him or her;{{efn|In the United Kingdom it is 28 days' notice, see sections 303(2) and 379 of the Companies Act 1985.}} the company must often supply a copy of the proposal to the director, who is usually entitled to be heard by the meeting.{{efn|In the United Kingdom, see section 304(1) of the Companies Act 1985. A private company cannot use a written resolution under section 381A – a meeting must be held.}} The director may require the company to circulate any representations that he wishes to make.{{efn|In the United Kingdom, see sections 303(2) and (3) of the Companies Act 1985.}} Furthermore, the director's contract of service will usually entitle him to compensation if he is removed, and may often include a generous "[[golden parachute]]" which also acts as a deterrent to removal.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

A recent study examines how corporate shareholders voted in director elections in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cai|first=Jay|author2=Garner, Jacqueline |author3=Walkling, Ralph |title = Shareholder Access to the Boardroom: A Survey of Recent Evidence |journal=Journal of Applied Finance |year=2010 |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=15–26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It found that directors received fewer votes from shareholders when their companies performed poorly, had excess CEO compensation, or had poor shareholder protection. Also, directors received fewer votes when they did not regularly attend board meetings or received negative recommendations from a proxy advisory firm. The study also shows that companies often improve their corporate governance by removing [[poison pill]]s or classified boards and by reducing excessive CEO pay after their directors receive low shareholder support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cai | first1 = J. | last2 = Garner | first2 = J.

Board accountability to shareholders is a recurring issue. In 2010, the ''New York Times'' noted that several directors who had overseen companies which had failed in the [[financial crisis of 2007–2010]] had found new positions as directors.&lt;ref&gt;Craig S, Lattman P. (2010). [http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/14/companies-may-fail-but-directors-are-in-demand/?src=me&amp;ref=business Companies May Fail, but Directors Are in Demand]. ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; The SEC sometimes imposes a ban (a "D&amp;O bar") on serving on a board as part of its fraud cases, and one of these was upheld in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law360.com/articles/442382/sec-wins-d-o-bar-against-alleged-hedge-fund-scammer SEC Wins D&amp;O Bar Against Alleged Hedge Fund Scammer]. Law360.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exercise of powers===
The exercise by the board of directors of its powers usually occurs in board meetings. Most legal systems require sufficient notice to be given to all directors of these meetings, and that a [[quorum]] must be present before any business may be conducted. Usually, a meeting which is held without notice having been given is still valid if all of the directors attend, but it has been held that a failure to give notice may negate resolutions passed at a meeting, because the persuasive oratory of a minority of directors might have persuaded the majority to change their minds and vote otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;See for example ''Barber's Case'' (1877) 5 Ch D 963 and ''Re Portuguese Consolidated Copper Mines'' (1889) 42 Ch D 160&lt;/ref&gt;

In most [[common law]] countries, the powers of the board are vested in the board as a whole, and not in the individual directors.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Breckland Group Holdings Ltd v London and Suffolk Properties]]'' [1989] BCLC 100&lt;/ref&gt; However, in instances an individual director may still bind the company by his acts by virtue of his [[ostensible authority]] (see also: [[Royal British Bank v Turquand|the rule in ''Turquand's Case'']]).

===Duties===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Corporate benefit]]. See [[WP:MOS#Section management]] --&gt;
{{main|Directors' duties|Fiduciary duties}}

Because directors exercise control and management over the organization, but organizations are (in theory) run for the benefit of the [[shareholder]]s, the law imposes strict duties on directors in relation to the exercise of their duties. The duties imposed on directors are [[fiduciary]] duties, similar to those that the law imposes on those in similar positions of trust: [[agency (law)|agents]] and [[trustee]]s.

The duties apply to each director separately, while the powers apply to the board jointly. Also, the duties are owed to the company itself, and not to any other entity.&lt;ref&gt;''Percival v Wright'' [1902] Ch 421&lt;/ref&gt; This does not mean that directors can never stand in a fiduciary relationship to the individual shareholders; they may well have such a duty in certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;For example, if the board is authorised by the shareholders to negotiate with a takeover bidder. It has been held in New Zealand that "depending upon all the surround circumstances and the nature of the responsibility which in a real and practical sense the director has assumed towards the shareholder," ''Coleman v Myers'' [1977] 2 NZLR 225&lt;/ref&gt;

==== "Proper purpose" ====
Directors must exercise their powers for a proper purpose. While in many instances an improper purpose is readily evident, such as a director looking to feather his or her own nest or divert an investment opportunity to a relative, such breaches usually involve a breach of the director's duty to act in good faith. Greater difficulties arise where the director, while acting in good faith, is serving a purpose that is not regarded by the law as proper.

The seminal authority in relation to what amounts to a proper purpose is the [[United Kingdom Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] decision in Eclairs Group Ltd v JKX Oil &amp; Gas plc (2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=[[Eclairs Group Ltd v JKX Oil &amp; Gas plc]] |court=UKSC |division=|year=2015 |num=71 |date={{date|2015-12-02}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case concerned the powers of directors under the [[articles of association]] of the company to disenfranchise voting rights attached to shares for failure to properly comply with notice served on the shareholders.  Prior to that case the leading authority was ''[[Howard Smith Ltd v Ampol Ltd]]'' [1974] AC 821. The case concerned the power of the directors to issue new [[stock|shares]].&lt;ref&gt;Following ''[[Hogg v Cramphorn Ltd]]'' [1967] Ch 254&lt;/ref&gt; It was alleged that the directors had issued a large number of new shares purely to deprive a particular shareholder of his voting majority. An argument that the power to issue shares could only be properly exercised to raise new capital was rejected as too narrow, and it was held that it would be a proper exercise of the director's powers to issue shares to a larger company to ensure the financial stability of the company, or as part of an agreement to exploit mineral rights owned by the company.&lt;ref&gt;''Teck Corporation v Millar'' (1972) 33 DLR (3d) 288&lt;/ref&gt; If so, the mere fact that an incidental result (even if it was a desired consequence) was that a shareholder lost his majority, or a takeover bid was defeated, this would not itself make the share issue improper. But if the sole purpose was to destroy a voting majority, or block a takeover bid, that would be an improper purpose.

Not all jurisdictions recognised the "proper purpose" duty as separate from the "good faith" duty however.{{efn|This division was rejected in British Columbia in ''Teck Corporation v Millar'' (1972) 33 DLR (3d) 288.}}

==== "Unfettered discretion" ====
Directors cannot, without the consent of the company, fetter their [[discretion]] in relation to the exercise of their powers, and cannot bind themselves to vote in a particular way at future board meetings.{{efn|Although as Gower points out, as well understood as the rule is, there is a paucity of authority on the point. But see ''Clark v Workman'' [1920] 1 Ir R 107 and ''Dawson International plc v Coats Paton plc'' 1989 SLT 655.}} This is so even if there is no improper motive or purpose, and no personal advantage to the director.

This does not mean, however, that the board cannot agree to the company entering into a contract which binds the company to a certain course, even if certain actions in that course will require further board approval. The company remains bound, but the directors retain the discretion to vote against taking the future actions (although that may involve a breach by the company of the [[contract]] that the board previously approved).

===="Conflict of duty and interest"====

As fiduciaries, the directors may not put themselves in a position where their interests and duties conflict with the duties that they owe to the company. The law takes the view that good faith must not only be done, but must be manifestly seen to be done, and zealously patrols the conduct of directors in this regard; and will not allow directors to escape liability by asserting that his decision was in fact well founded. Traditionally, the law has divided conflicts of duty and interest into three sub-categories.

=====Transactions with the company=====

By definition, where a director enters into a transaction with a company, there is a conflict between the director's interest (to do well for himself out of the transaction) and his duty to the company (to ensure that the company gets as much as it can out of the transaction). This rule is so strictly enforced that, even where the [[conflict of interest]] or conflict of duty is purely hypothetical, the directors can be forced to disgorge all personal gains arising from it. In ''Aberdeen Ry v Blaikie'' (1854) 1 Macq HL 461 [[Robert Rolfe, 1st Baron Cranworth|Lord Cranworth]] stated in his judgment that:

:"A corporate body can only act by agents, and it is, of course, the duty of those agents so to act as best to promote the interests of the corporation whose affairs they are conducting. Such agents have duties to discharge of a fiduciary nature towards their principal. And it is a rule of universal application that no one, having such duties to discharge, shall be allowed to enter into engagements in which he has, ''or can have'', a personal interest conflicting ''or which possibly may conflict'', with the interests of those whom he is bound to protect... So strictly is this principle adhered to that no question is allowed to be raised as to the fairness or unfairness of the contract entered into..." (''emphasis'' added)

However, in many jurisdictions the members of the company are permitted to ratify transactions which would otherwise fall foul of this principle. It is also largely accepted in most jurisdictions that this principle can be overridden in the company's constitution.

In many countries, there is also a statutory duty to declare interests in relation to any transactions, and the director can be fined for failing to make disclosure.{{efn|In the United Kingdom, see section 317 of the Companies Act 1985.}}

===== Use of corporate property, opportunity, or information =====
Directors must not, without the informed consent of the company, use for their own profit the company's assets, [[corporate opportunity|opportunities]], or information. This prohibition is much less flexible than the prohibition against the transactions with the company, and attempts to circumvent it using provisions in the articles have met with limited success.

In ''[[Regal (Hastings) v Gulliver|Regal (Hastings) Ltd v Gulliver]]'' [1942] All ER 378 the House of Lords, in upholding what was regarded as a wholly unmeritorious claim by the shareholders,{{efn|In summary, the facts were as follows: Company A owned a cinema, and the directors decided to acquire two other cinemas with a view to selling the entire undertaking as a [[going concern]]. They formed a new company ("Company B") to take the leases of the two new cinemas. But the lessor insisted on various stipulations, one of which was that Company B had to have a paid up [[share capital]] of not less than £5,000 (a substantial sum at the time). Company A was unable to subscribe for more than £2,000 in shares, so the directors arranged for the remaining 3,000 shares to be taken by themselves and their friends. Later, instead of selling the undertaking, they sold all of the shares in both companies and made a substantial profit. The shareholders of Company A sued asking that directors and their friends to disgorge the profits that they had made in connection with their 3,000 shares in Company B – the very same shares which the shareholders in Company A had been asked to subscribe (through Company A) but refused to do so.}} held that:

: "(i) that what the directors did was so related to the affairs of the company that it can properly be said to have been done in the course of their management and in the utilisation of their opportunities and special knowledge as directors; and (ii) that what they did resulted in profit to themselves."

And accordingly, the directors were required to disgorge the profits that they made, and the shareholders received their windfall.

The decision has been followed in several subsequent cases,&lt;ref&gt;''Industrial Development Consultants v Cooley'' [1972] 1 WLR 443 (corporate information), ''[[Canadian Aero Service v. O'Malley]]'' (1973) 40 DLR (3d) 371 (corporate opportunity) and ''Boardman v Phipps'' [1967] 2 AC 46 (corporate opportunity, which again, the company itself had declined to take up)&lt;/ref&gt; and is now regarded as settled law.

===== Competing with the company =====
Directors cannot compete directly with the company without a conflict of interest arising. Similarly, they should not act as directors of competing companies, as their duties to each company would then conflict with each other.

==== Common law duties of care and skill ====
Traditionally, the level of care and skill which has to be demonstrated by a director has been framed largely with reference to the non-executive director. In ''[[Re City Equitable Fire Insurance Co]]'' [1925] Ch 407, it was expressed in purely subjective terms, where the court held that:

: "a director need not exhibit in the performance of his duties a greater degree of skill than may reasonably be expected from a person of ''his'' knowledge and experience." (''emphasis'' added)

However, this decision was based firmly in the older notions (see above) that prevailed at the time as to the mode of corporate decision making, and effective control residing in the shareholders; if they elected and put up with an incompetent decision maker, they should not have recourse to complain.

However, a more modern approach has since developed, and in ''[[Dorchester Finance Co Ltd v Stebbing]]'' [1989] BCLC 498 the court held that the rule in ''Equitable Fire'' related only to skill, and not to diligence. With respect to diligence, what was required was:

: "such care as an ordinary man might be expected to take on his own behalf."

This was a dual subjective and objective test, and one deliberately pitched at a higher level.

More recently, it has been suggested that both the tests of skill and diligence should be assessed objectively and subjectively; in the United Kingdom, the statutory provisions relating to directors' duties in the new [[Companies Act 2006]] have been codified on this basis.&lt;ref name="NormanGoddard"&gt;''Norman v [[Theodore Goddard]]'' [1991] BCLC 1027&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Remedies for breach of duty ====
In most jurisdictions, the law provides for a variety of remedies in the event of a breach by the directors of their duties:
# [[injunction]] or [[declaration (law)|declaration]]
# [[damages]] or compensation
# restoration of the company's property
# [[Rescission (contract law)|rescission]] of the relevant [[contract]]
# [[account of profits]]
# [[Termination of employment#Summary termination|summary dismissal]]

====Current trends====
Historically, directors' duties have been owed almost exclusively to the company and its members, and the board was expected to exercise its powers for the [[corporate benefit|financial benefit]] of the company. However, more recently there have been attempts to "soften" the position, and provide for more scope for directors to act as good corporate citizens. For example, in the United Kingdom, the [[Companies Act 2006]] requires directors of companies "to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole" and sets out the following six factors regarding a director's duty to promote success:
* the likely consequences of any decision in the long term
* the interests of the company's employees
* the need to foster the company's business relationships with suppliers, customers and others
* the impact of the company's operations on the community and the environment
* the desirability of the company maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct
* the need to act fairly as between members of a company

This represents a considerable departure from the traditional notion that directors' duties are owed only to the company. Previously in the United Kingdom, under the [[Companies Act 1985]], protections for non-member stakeholders were considerably more limited (see, for example, s.309 which permitted directors to take into account the interests of employees but which could only be enforced by the shareholders and not by the employees themselves). The changes have therefore been the subject of some criticism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.altassets.net/features/arc/2006/nz8451.php Director's duties]&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Board and Society====

Most companies have weak mechanisms for bringing the voice of society into the board room. They rely on personalities who weren't appointed for their understanding of societal issues. Often they give limited focus (both through time and financial resource) to issues of corporate responsibility and sustainability. A Social Board &lt;ref&gt;Acre Resources LTD (2018), [https://www.acre.com/resources/the-case-for-a-social-board/ The Case for a Social Board], London, UK&lt;/ref&gt; has society designed into its structure. It elevates the voice of society through specialist appointments to the board and mechanisms that empower innovation from within the organisation. Social Boards align themselves with themes that are important to society.These may include measuring worker pay ratios, linking personal social and environmental objectives to remuneration, integrated reporting, fair tax and B-Corp Certification. 

Social Boards recognise that they are part of society and that they require more than a licence to operate to succeed.They balance short-term shareholder pressure against long-term value creation, managing the business for a plurality of stakeholders including employees, shareholders, supply chains and civil society.

===United States===

====Sarbanes–Oxley Act====

The [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act]] of 2002 has introduced new standards of accountability on boards of U.S. companies or companies listed on U.S. [[stock exchange]]s. Under the Act, directors risk large fines and prison sentences in the case of accounting crimes. [[Internal control]] is now the direct responsibility of directors. The vast majority of companies covered by the Act have hired internal auditors to ensure that the company adheres to required standards of internal control. The internal auditors are required by law to report directly to an audit board, consisting of directors more than half of whom are outside directors, one of whom is a "financial expert."

The law requires companies listed on the major stock exchanges (NYSE, NASDAQ) to have a majority of independent directors—directors who are not otherwise employed by the firm or in a business relationship with it.

====Size====
According to the Corporate Library's study, the average size of publicly traded company's board is 9.2 members, and most boards range from 3 to 31 members. According to Investopedia, some analysts think the ideal size is seven.&lt;ref name=BoD&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/03/111903.asp#ixzz27Kekd83e |title=Evaluating The Board Of Directors|publisher= investopedia.com|date= 29 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  State law may specify a minimum number of directors, maximum number of directors, and qualifications for directors (e.g. whether board members must be individuals or may be business entities).&lt;ref name=BoD2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.harborcompliance.com/information/corporate-governance-by-state.php |title=U.S. Corporate Governance by State |publisher= harborcompliance.com|date= 22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BoD3&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.harborcompliance.com/information/nonprofit-governance-by-state.php |title=U.S. Nonprofit Governance by State |publisher= harborcompliance.com|date= 27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Committees====
While a board may have several committees, two—the compensation committee and audit committee—are critical and must be made up of at least three [[independent director]]s and no inside directors. Other common committees in boards are nominating and governance.&lt;ref name=BoD/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.klgates.com/files/Publication/f44a6446-4d3a-4847-a157-319c05d9667b/Presentation/PublicationAttachment/3900b2fd-2183-44e8-82d7-41bd4366f0f6/CompensationCommitteeStructure.pdf Compensation Committee Structure, Function and Best Practices] Richard E. Wood&lt;/ref&gt;

====Compensation====
Directors of [[Fortune 500]] companies received median pay of $234,000 in 2011. Directorship is a part-time job. A recent National Association of Corporate Directors study found directors averaging just 4.3 hours a week on board work.&lt;ref name=comp&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/companies/management/story/2011-10-25/director-compensation-rising/50918332/1 | work=USA Today | title=Company directors see pay skyrocket | date=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surveys indicate that about 20% of [[nonprofit foundation]]s pay their board members,&lt;ref name="Schambra"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Schambra | first=William A. | title=Board Compensation: To Pay or Not to Pay? | work=Philanthropy magazine |date=Winter 2008 |publisher=Philanthropy Roundtable | url=http://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/topic/philanthropic_freedom/compensating_foundation_directors1 | accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2% of American [[nonprofit organization]]s do.{{sfn|BoardSource|2015|p=52}}&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{cite |author=[[Internal Revenue Service]] |title=Governance and Related Topics - 501(c)(3) Organizations |date=4 February 2008 |location=Washington, DC |publisher=Author |url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/governance_practices.pdf |quote=Charities should generally not compensate persons for service on the board of directors except to reimburse direct expenses of such service. ...

===Criticism===
According to John Gillespie, a former investment banker and co-author of a book critical of boards,&lt;ref&gt;''Money for Nothing: How the Failure of Corporate Boards is Ruining American Business and Costing Us Trillions''&lt;/ref&gt; "Far too much of their time has been for check-the-box and cover-your-behind activities rather than real monitoring of executives and providing strategic advice on behalf of shareholders".&lt;ref name=comp/&gt; At the same time, scholars have found that individual directors have a large effect on major corporate initiatives such as mergers and acquisitions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rousseau|first1=Peter|last2=Stroup|first2=Caleb|title=Director Histories and the Pattern of Acquisitions|journal=Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis|date=2015|volume=50|issue=4|pages=671–698|doi=10.1017/s0022109015000289}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cross-border investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stroup|first=Caleb|title=International Deal Experience and Cross-Border Acquisitions|journal=Economic Inquiry|volume=55|pages=73–97|date=November 28, 2015|ssrn=2037512|doi=10.1111/ecin.12365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of [[gender representation on corporate boards of directors]] has been the subject of much criticism in recent years. Governments and corporations have responded with measures such as legislation mandating gender quotas and [[comply or explain]] systems to address the disproportionality of gender representation on corporate boards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Senden|first1=Linda|title=The Multiplicity of Regulatory Responses to Remedy the Gender Imbalance on Company Boards|journal=Utrecht Law Review|date=December 2014|volume=10|issue=5|pages=51–66|doi=10.18352/ulr.300}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of the French corporate elite has found that certain social classes are also disproportionately represented on boards, with those from the upper and, especially, upper-middle classes tending to dominate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maclean|first=Mairi|last2=Harvey|first2=Charles|last3=Kling|first3=Gerhard|date=2014-06-01|title=Pathways to Power: Class, Hyper-Agency and the French Corporate Elite|journal=Organization Studies|language=en|volume=35|issue=6|pages=825–855|doi=10.1177/0170840613509919|issn=0170-8406|url=http://opus.bath.ac.uk/50376/3/Maclean_Harvey_Kling_OS_2014.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''California's 34th congressional district''' is a [[congressional district]] in [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[California]]. The district has been represented by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Jimmy Gomez]] since June 2017. Its previous representative, Democrat [[Xavier Becerra]] of [[Los Angeles]], resigned January 24, 2017 to become [[Attorney General of California]].  Representative Gomez won a [[California's 34th congressional district special election, 2017|special election]] on June 6, 2017, beating fellow Democrat [[Robert Lee Ahn]] to replace Becerra.&lt;ref&gt;http://mynewsla.com/government/2017/06/07/traditionally-latino-congressional-seat-stays-with-latino-korean-american-defeated/&lt;/ref&gt;  He was later sworn in as the District's Congressman on July 11, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-los-angeles-rep-jimmy-gomez-sworn-1499817496-htmlstory.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10810">A '''core''' is a device used in [[casting]] and [[molding (process)|moulding]] processes to produce internal cavities and [[wikt:reentrant|reentrant]] angles (an interior angle that is greater than 180°). The core is normally a disposable item that is destroyed to get it out of the piece.&lt;ref name="degarmo311"&gt;{{harvnb|Degarmo|Black|Kohser|2003|p=311}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They are most commonly used in [[sand casting]], but are also used in [[die casting]] and [[injection moulding]].

For example, cores define multiple passages inside cast [[engine block]]s. One model of GM V-8 engine requires 5 dry-sand cores for every casting.&lt;ref name="degarmo311"/&gt;

==Materials required to make cores==
*Core sand
*Bentonite clay
*Pulverized coal
*Resin oil

==Advantages and disadvantages==
Cores are useful for features that cannot tolerate [[draft (engineering)|draft]] or to provide detail that cannot otherwise be integrated into a core-less casting or mold.&lt;ref name="degarmo311"/&gt;

The main disadvantage is the additional cost to incorporate cores.&lt;ref name="degarmo311"/&gt;

==Requirements==
There are seven requirements for cores:&lt;ref name="degarmo312"/&gt;

#Green strength: In the green condition, there must be adequate strength for handling
#In the hardened state, it must be strong enough to handle the forces of casting; therefore, the compression strength should be 100 to 300 psi (0.69 to 2.07 MPa).
#[[Permeability (foundry sand)|Permeability]] must be very high to allow for the escape of gases.
#Friability: As the casting or molding cools, the core must be weak enough to break down as the material shrinks. Moreover, they must be easy to remove during [[wikt:shakeout|shakeout]].
#Good [[refractoriness]] is required as the core is usually surrounded by hot metal during casting or molding.
#A smooth [[surface finish]].
#Minimum generation of gases during metal pouring.

==Types==
Many types of cores are available. The selection of the correct type of core depends on production quantity, production rate, required precision, required surface finish, and the type of metal being used. For example, certain metals are sensitive to gases that are given off by certain types of core sands; other metals have too low of a melting point to properly break down the binder for removal during the shakeout.&lt;ref name="degarmo312"/&gt;

===Green-sand cores===
[[File:Green sand cores.svg|thumb|Green-sand cores]]

''[[Molding sand|Green-sand]] cores makes casting long narrow features difficult or impossible. Even for long features that can be cast it still leave much material to be machined. A typical application is a through hole in a casting.&lt;ref name="degarmo312"&gt;{{harvnb|Degarmo|Black|Kohser|2003|p=312}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dry-sand cores===
The simplest way to make a dry-sand cores is in a ''dump core box'', in which sand is packed into the box and scraped level with the top. A wood or metal plate is then placed over the box, and then the two are flipped over and the core segment falls out of the core box. The core segment is then baked or hardened. Multiple core segments are then [[hot glue]]d together or attached by some other means. Any rough spots are [[filing (metalworking)|filed]] or [[sanding|sanded]] down. Finally, the core is lightly coated with [[graphite]], [[silica]], or [[mica]] to give a smoother [[surface finish]] and greater resistance to heat.&lt;ref name="degarmo312"/&gt;
''Single-piece cores'' do not need to be assembled because they are made in a ''split core box''. A split core box, like it sounds, is made of two halves and has at least one hole for sand to be introduced. For simple cores that have constant cross-sections they can be created on special core-producing [[extruding|extruders]]. The extrusions are then cut to the proper length and hardened. More complex single-piece cores can be made in a manner similar to [[injection molding]]s and [[die casting]]s.&lt;ref name="degarmo312"/&gt;

Types of core:
*Cold Box
*half core box
*dump core box
*split core box
*left and right core box
*gang core box
*strickle core box
*loose piece core box

===Lost cores===
{{Main|Fusible core injection molding}}

Cores are used for complex [[injection molding]]s in the [[fusible core injection molding]] process. First, a core is made from a [[fusible alloy]] or low melting temperature [[polymer]]. It is then placed inside the injection mold's dies and the plastic is shot into the mold. The molding is then removed from the mold with the core still in it. Finally, the core is melted or washed out of the molding in a hot bath.

==Binders==
Special ''binders'' are introduced into core sands to add strength. The oldest binder was [[vegetable oil]], however now [[synthetic oil]] is used, in conjunction with [[cereal]] or [[clay]]. The core is then baked in a [[convection oven]] between {{convert|200|and|250|C|F}}. The heat causes the binder to [[cross-link]] or [[polymerize]]. While this process is simple, the dimensional accuracy is low.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Degarmo|Black|Kohser|2003|pp=312–313}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another type of binder process is called the ''hot-box process'', which uses a [[thermoset]] and [[catalyst]] for a binder. The sand with the binder is packed into a core box that is heated to approximately {{convert|230|C|F|abbr=on}} (which is where the name originated from). The binder that touches the hot surface of the core box begins to [[cure]] within 10 to 30&amp;nbsp;seconds. Depending on the type of binder it may require further baking to fully cure.&lt;ref name="degarmo313"&gt;{{harvnb|Degarmo|Black|Kohser|2003|p=313}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Cores produced using this method are sometimes referred to as "shell-core" because often, only the outside layer of the core is hardened when in contact with the hot corebox. When the corebox is opened and the core removed, the uncured sand inside the core is dumped out to be reused. This practice can also be observed in some cold-box coremaking practices, though cold box shell-core making is much less common.

In a similar vein, the ''cold-box process'' uses a binder that is hardened through the use of special gases. The binder coated sand is packed into a core box and then sealed so that a curing gas can be introduced. These gases are often toxic (i.e. [[amine]] gas) or odorous (i.e. [[sulfur dioxide|SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]), so special handling systems must be used. However, because high temperatures are not required the core box can be made from metal, wood, or plastic. An added benefit is that hollow core can be formed if the gas is introduced via holes in the core surface which cause only the surface of the core to harden; the remaining sand is then just dumped out to be used again.&lt;ref name="degarmo313"/&gt; For example, a cold-box sand casting core binder is [[sodium silicate]] which hardens on exposure to [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref name="bcs"&gt;{{Citation |title= Sodium silicate for core making |url= http://www.budgetcastingsupply.com/Sodium_Silicate.php |accessdate= 2009-08-02}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Special binders are used in ''air-set sands'' to produce core at room temperature. These sands do not require a gas catalyst because organic binders and a curing catalyst are mixed together in the sand which initiates the curing process. The only disadvantage with this is that after the catalyst is mixed in there is a short time to use the sand. A third way to produce room temperature cores is by [[shell molding]].&lt;ref name="degarmo313"/&gt;

The term ''no-bake sands'' can refer to either the cold-box process or air-set process.&lt;ref name="degarmo313"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bcs"/&gt;

===Other considerations===
To increase the strength of cores internal wires and rods can be added. To enhance collapsibility, straw can be added to the middle of the core or a hollow core can be used. This attribute is especially important for steel casting because a large amount of shrinkage occurs.&lt;ref name="degarmo313"/&gt;

Except for very small cores, all cores require vent holes to release gases. These are usually formed by using small wires to create holes from the surface of the mold to the core. When this is not feasible [[cinder]] and [[coke (fuel)|coke]] can be added to the core to increase permeability.&lt;ref name="degarmo313"/&gt;

==Chaplets==&lt;!-- [[Chaplet (metallurgy)]] links here --&gt;
[[File:Chaplets.svg|thumb|340px&lt;!-- Image must be larger than 332 to display correctly --&gt;|A diagram of chaplet usage]]
[[File:Types of chaplets.png|thumb|Various types of chaplets.]]

If Fub≤0, no chaplet is used.

If Fub&gt;0, chaplets is used.

As mentioned earlier, cores are usually supported by two core prints in the mold. However, there are situations where a core only uses one core print so other means are required to support the cantilevered end. These are usually supplied in the form of ''chaplets''. These are small metal supports that bridge the gap between the mold surface and the core. Since the chaplets become part of the casting, the chaplets must be of the same or similar material as the metal being cast. Moreover, their design must be optimized because if they are too small they will completely melt and allow the core to move, but if they are too big then their whole surface cannot melt and fuse with the poured metal. Their use should also be minimized because they can cause casting defects or create weak spots in the casting.&lt;ref name="degarmo314"&gt;{{harvnb|Degarmo|Black|Kohser|2003|p=314}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually more critical to ensure the upper chaplets are stronger than the lower ones because the core will tend to float upward in the molten metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Palmer |first= Reginald Heber |title= Foundry practice |page= 162 |publisher= Wiley |year= 1911 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0qBIAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA162 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cheeks==
[[File:Casting cheek.svg|thumb|left|340px&lt;!-- This image must be larger than 332px to display correctly --&gt;|A cheek used to create a pulley]]

When casting a reentrant angle, instead of using a core a ''cheek'' can be used. This is a third segment in the [[flask (casting)|flask]], in addition to the [[cope and drag]]. This allows the entire mold to be made from green sand and from removable patterns. The disadvantage of this is more mold-making operations are required, but it is usually advantageous when the quantities are low. However, if large quantities of casting are required, it is usually more cost effective to simply use a core.&lt;ref name="degarmo314"/&gt;

It highlights how wealthy corporations are less in need of such treatment than the poor.&lt;ref name="NYT-20140327"/&gt;

The definition of corporate welfare is sometimes restricted to direct government subsidies of major corporations, excluding tax loopholes and all manner of regulatory and trade decisions, which, in practice, could be worth much more than any direct subsidies.

== Origin of term ==
The term "corporate welfare" was reportedly invented in 1956 by [[Ralph Nader]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Believed to have been first popularised by [[Michael Harrington]]'s 1962 book ''[[The Other America]]''&lt;ref&gt;Harrington 1962, p.170, quote: "socialism for the rich and private enterprise for the poor"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert P.

=== "Privatizing profits and socializing losses" ===
"Privatizing profits and socializing losses" refers to the idea that corporations want to reserve financial gains for themselves and pass along losses to the rest of society, potentially through lobbying the government for assistance. This practice was criticized in the [[Wall Street bailout]] of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/privatizing-profits-and-socializing-losses.asp|title=Privatizing Profits And Socializing Losses|first=Investopedia|last=Staff|date=15 April 2012|website=investopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Background ===
[[Subsidies]] considered excessive, unwarranted, wasteful, unfair, inefficient, or bought by [[lobbying]] are often called corporate welfare.&lt;ref name="NYT-20140327" /&gt; The label of corporate welfare is often used to decry projects advertised as benefiting the general welfare that spend a disproportionate amount of funds on large corporations, and often in uncompetitive, or [[anti-competitive]] ways. For instance, in the United States, [[agricultural subsidy|agricultural subsidies]] are usually portrayed as helping independent farmers stay afloat. However, the majority of income gained from commodity support programs actually goes to large [[agribusiness]] corporations such as [[Archer Daniels Midland]], as they own a considerably larger percentage of production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usda.gov/factbook/chapter3.htm USDA: American Farms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210035144/http://www.usda.gov/factbook/chapter3.htm |date=2007-02-10 }} www.USDA.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

More to the point, while more than 170 billion dollars is expended on assorted varieties of corporate welfare the federal government spends 11 billion dollars on Aid for Dependent Children. The most expensive means tested welfare program, Medicaid, costs the federal government 30 billion dollars a year or about half of the amount corporations receive each year through assorted tax breaks. S.S.I., the federal program for the disabled, receives 13 billion dollars while American businesses are given 17 billion in direct federal aid.&lt;ref name='Huff 1993'/&gt;}}

== United Kingdom ==
In 2015, Kevin Farnsworth, a senior lecturer in [[Social Policy]] at the [[University of York]] published a paper in which he claimed that the government was providing corporate subsidies of £93 billion.&lt;ref name=farnsworthpaper&gt;{{cite web|url=http://speri.dept.shef.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SPERI-Paper-24-The-British-Corporate-Welfare-State.pdf |title=The British Corporate Welfare State: Public Provision for Private Businesses}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jul/07/corporate-welfare-a-93bn-handshake |title=The £93bn handshake: businesses pocket huge subsidies and tax breaks}}&lt;/ref&gt; This amount includes the role of the government in increasing trade, tax relief for businesses that invest in new plants and machinery (estimated by Farnsworth at £20 billion), not charging fuel duty on fuel used by railways or airlines, green energy subsidies, a lower corporation tax rate for small companies, [[regional development]] grants and government procurement for businesses (which Farnsworth suggests often favours British businesses even when these are not the best value option available).&lt;ref name=farnsworthpaper /&gt; However, ''[[The Register]]'' wrote that Farnsworth's figure for tax relief for investment was incorrect and that he had made mistakes in his calculations, noting that he was not an accountant. It also stated that not charging businesses taxes under certain circumstances (when the reliefs applied) was not the same as giving them a subsidy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/07/12/political_memes_economics_corporate_welfare/?page=1 |title=Taxpayers are NOT giving businesses £93bn}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuel duty is not charged on airlines due to the [[Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation|Convention on International Civil Aviation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icao.int/publications/pages/doc7300.aspx |title=Convention on International Civil Aviation}}&lt;/ref&gt; (a [[United Nations|UN agency]]) which specifies that aeroplanes should be exempt from fuel duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fullfact.org/factchecks/airline_industry_subsidies_green_taxes-3256 |title=Does the government subsidise airlines by £10 billion?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political discussion ===
In 2015, [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party leader]] [[Jeremy Corbyn]] said he would “strip out” the £93bn of “corporate tax relief and subsidies” Farnsworth referred to and use the proceeds for public investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jeremy-corbyn-allies-accuse-chris-leslie-of-deliberately-misrepresenting-labour-leader-contenders-economic-policies-10436258.html|title=Jeremy Corbyn allies accuse Chris Leslie of deliberately misrepresenting Labour frontrunner's economic policies | location=London | work=The Independent|first=Andrew|last=Grice|date=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corbyn did not say which specific policies he would change. ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote the policy "sounds wonderful, but careful scrutiny of 'corporate welfare' shows that it includes capital allowances designed to persuade companies to invest, regional aid to boost growth in rundown parts of the UK, and subsidies to keep bus and rail routes open – none of which Corbyn would presumably like to see stopped."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/20/jeremy-corbyn-labour-leader-tory-economy-plans |title=Jeremy Corbyn has the vision, but his numbers don’t yet add up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Canada ==
The [[New Democratic Party]] in [[Canada]] picked up the term as a major theme in its [[Canadian federal election, 1972|1972 federal election]] campaign. Its leader, [[David Lewis (politician)|David Lewis]], used the term in the title of his 1972 book, ''Louder Voices: The Corporate Welfare Bums''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Louder voices: the corporate welfare bums|last=Lewis|first=David|publisher=James Lewis &amp; Samuel|year=1972|isbn=9780888620316|location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Reform Party of Canada|Reform Party]] and its successor the [[Canadian Alliance]] were known for opposing mostly business subsidies. However, after their merger with the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada candidates, 1997 Canadian federal election|Progressive Conservative]] party, they dropped their opposition  to it. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=zxjshaowfeYC&amp;pg=PT66&amp;lpg=PT66&amp;dq=reform+party+corporate+welfare&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lDUyasx11z&amp;sig=B8UXPouQ_G4D-7uKOFfwNe5J3Ok&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj-k5v3oa3dAhXJmVkKHVqVCT04FBDoATACegQICBAB#v=onepage&amp;q=reform%20party%20corporate%20welfare&amp;f=false|title=A Nation of Serfs: How Canada's Political Culture Corrupts Canadian Values|last=Milke|first=Mark|date=2010-01-14|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9780470675175|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== India ==
It was observed by [[The Wire (Indian web publication)|The Wire]] that the [[Effective tax rate]] was low for the larger corporations which meant companies making smaller profits are competing in an unequal environment against bigger companies with substantial taxation benefits, with the gap in effective tax rates widening over the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thewire.in/economy/why-52911-profitable-indian-companies-pay-0-tax|title=Why 52,911 Profitable Indian Companies Pay 0% Tax |website=The Wire|access-date=2018-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; India's Union government's prime minister criticised this practice and said
{{quote| "Why is it that subsidies going to the well-off are portrayed in a positive manner? Let me give you an example. The total revenue loss from incentives to corporate tax payers was over Rs 62,000 crore…I must confess I am surprised by the way words are used by experts on this matter. When a benefit is given to farmers or to the poor, experts and government officers normally call it a subsidy. However, I find that if a benefit is given to industry or commerce, it is usually an ‘incentive’ or a ‘subvention'."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/business/modi-calls-for-targeted-subsidies-questions-corporate-tax-breaks/story-IP1WX17PvJeyOfyLf0ZXxJ.html|title=Modi calls for targeted subsidies, questions corporate tax breaks|date=2016-01-30|work=[[Hindustan Times]]|access-date=2018-03-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Downtown Orlando''' is the historic core and [[central business district]] of [[Orlando, Florida]], United States. It is bordered by Marks Street in the north, Mills Avenue ([[SR 15 (FL)|SR 15]]) in the east, [[Orange Blossom Trail]] ([[US 441 (FL)|US 441]]) in the west, and Kaley Avenue in the south.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} There are several distinct neighborhoods in downtown; "North Quarter" to the north, "Lake Eola Heights Historic District" just north of [[Lake Eola]], "South Eola" contains [[Lake Eola Park]] and continues to the east and south of [[Lake Eola]], "Thornton Park" in the east, "Parramore" in the west, "Lake Cherokee Historic District" to the south, and the "Central Business District" (or the "Financial District") between Colonial Drive and Lake Lucerne in the center. In 2010, the estimated population of downtown was 18,731.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.city-data.com/neighborhood/Downtown-Orlando-Orlando-FL.html hborhood/Downtown-Orlando-Orlando-FL.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The daytime population was estimated to be 65,000 (in 2010). The 5-mile radius population of downtown is 273,335.&lt;ref&gt;http://downtownorlando.com/business/statistics&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Downtown Orlando is the largest of [[Urban area|urban]] centers in [[Central Florida]]. It is home to residential and commercial towers; local, state, and federal government offices; sports facilities; performing arts theaters; art galleries; a movie theater; retail; nightclubs; and parks. Downtown is removed from the tourist areas located in the southwestern half of the city; but does draw a significant number of visitors seeking to experience the "Real Orlando". It is also the location of numerous [[festivals]], parades, political demonstrations, and other high-profile events year-round.

== Geography ==

*Central Business District
*Holden/Parramore (portion east of Westmoreland Drive)
*Lake Dot (portion east of Westmoreland Drive)
*Lake Eola Heights (portion west of Summerlin Avenue)
*South Eola
*North Quarter
The CRA also includes small pieces of [[College Park, Orlando, Florida|College Park]] (portions east of Peachtree Road, and along Orange Avenue between Magnolia and Highland Avenues), [[Lake Cherokee, Orlando, Florida|Lake Cherokee]] (portions west of Delaney Avenue and north of Ponce de Leon Place / Palmer Street), [[Lorna Doone, Orlando, Florida|Lorna Doone]] (the [[Citrus Bowl Stadium]] only), [[Park Lake/Highland, Orlando, Florida|Park Lake/Highland]] (portion north of Lake Highland), [[South Division, Orlando, Florida|South Division]] (portion north of Gore Street, mostly highway right-of-way), [[South Orange, Orlando, Florida|South Orange]] (portion north of Gore Street), and [[Thornton Park, Orlando, Florida|Thornton Park]] (portion north of Central Boulevard and west of James Avenue).

=== North Quarter ===
Located north of Colonial Drive, the border of this area is Interstate 4 to the west, and Highland Avenue to the east, the north border is N Orange Ave &amp; the I-4 on-ramps at Lake Ivanhoe. This is a vibrant area that has seen many apartments and condominiums built, bringing a diverse collection of businesses including dining and shopping to the area. With such close proximity to the Central Business District for working professionals, this has become a valuable area for those who seek the convenience of work/play/live in downtown Orlando.

=== Parramore ===
{{main|Parramore}}
Established in the 1880s, Parramore is the historical hub of Orlando's [[African-American]] community. The area is located just west of the Central Business district along Division Ave and West Church Street. Now considered an economically depressed area, Orlando leaders are working with business owners in the community to improve the area's reputation. While some parts of the neighborhood have been gentrified, Parramore still maintains its historical African-American identity.

It is a residential area with a large number of high-intensity entertainment and office institutions; such as the [[Amway Center]], [[Bob Carr Performing Arts Centre]], US Courthouse for the Mid-District of Florida, [[Florida A&amp;M University]] School of Law, county &amp; state buildings, and [[Orlando Police Department]] headquarters. Smaller businesses include grocery stores, barber shops, and [[soul food]] restaurants.

Orlando officially considers Parramore to be three separate neighborhoods: Lake Dot (between [[Colonial Drive (Orlando)|Colonial Drive]] and Amelia Street), Callahan (between Amelia Street and Central Boulevard), and Holden/Parramore (between Central Boulevard and Gore Street). All three are bounded on the east by [[Interstate 4]] and on the west by [[Orange Blossom Trail]].

=== Central Business District ===
The central business district is Orlando's Financial District and is the most recognized feature of downtown. The majority of Orlando's night clubs are also in this area. Located here are corporate offices for [[Wells Fargo]] and [[Suntrust]] banks, [[Orlando City Hall]], [[Consul (representative)|foreign consulates]], and many hotels. SunTrust Center and City Commons are two large office complexes within
the CBD. [[Church Street Station (Orlando)|Church Street Station]] is also located in this area. Many of Orlando's historic buildings are located within the CBD standing next to modern skyscrapers. The Rogers Building (built in 1886), originally an English Gentlemen's Club built in the Queen Anne style, is the oldest building in downtown Orlando.&lt;ref&gt;http://thecraftsmanblog.com/orlando-historic-districts-downtown&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eola===&lt;!--name per http://www.downtownorlando.com/site/uploads/2012/06/CRA-subdistricts-Neighborhood-Map1.pdf--&gt;
[[Image:Lakeeola 09232006 trees.jpg|thumb|[[Lake Eola]]]]
{{see also|Lake Eola|Lake Eola Heights Historic District}}
[[Lake Eola Park]] is located in [[South Eola]], east of the CBD. Lake Eola Heights is located north of the lake and South Eola continues to the east and south of the lake. The park is historically significant and is a frequent venue for events and festivals. The park's most iconic landmark is the Linton E. Allen Memorial Fountain (locally known as the Lake Eola Fountain), permanently embedded to the bottom with concrete beams in the center of the lake. The fountain is illuminated nightly in various colors with two nightly water shows.  In addition to the fountain, the park features swan boat rentals and the ''Walt Disney Amphitheater''. Every [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]], the park is host to a large [[fireworks]] display which draws thousands of people to downtown. A {{convert|0.85|mi|km|adj=on}} recreational pathway circles the park and leads to a playground.

Lake Eola Heights is unique in Orlando as it contains some of the oldest homes in the city and is another one of Orlando's historic districts. There are many historical "Florida style" bungalows and century-old oak lined brick streets.

=== Thornton Park ===

[[File:Thornton Park Neighborhood.jpg|thumb|Facing east from the corner of Washington St and Hyer Ave in the heart of Thornton Park.]]

Thornton Park is located one city block east of Lake Eola Park. The streets creating its border are: Summerlin Ave, E Robinson St, N Brown Ave, E Central Blvd to S Hyer Ave, and S Hyer Ave south to Florida State Road 408. The area is similar to the Lake Eola Heights neighborhood in that it contains historic homes and the streets are paved with bricks, although it is roughly half the size. Thornton Park also enjoys a handful of small restaurants, bars and boutiques along E Washington St. The neighborhood also has a small fountain located in the center of the intersection of E Washington St &amp; N Hyer Ave which has become a focal point, and is described here: The Fountain is a replica of a fountain found in a Paris city center that is 25 times its size. In 1999 the "Taste of Thornton Park Event" was organized specifically to raise enough money to purchase the Thornton Park Fountain for around $17,000 + $23,000 for fountain foundation. [[Howard Middle School (Orlando, Florida)|Howard Middle School]], which was the original Orlando High School, is located here.

== History ==

=== Early years ===
Prior to the arrival of European settlers in 1837, the Orlando area was occupied by the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[Muscogee (Creek)|Creek]] and [[Seminole]] tribes. In 1838, Fort Gatlin was built a few miles south of downtown Orlando on the shores of modern-day Lake Gatlin; (a historic marker is now located on the fort site). In 1850, a man named Aaron Jernigan built a post office north of the fort and the area became known as "Jernigan". In 1856, Jernigan was relieved of his command of the post office due to "notorious acts" and the area was renamed "Orlando". The village remained little more than a backwater during and after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] until 1875 when The "Town of Orlando" was incorporated. It was centered around the original Orange County Courthouse in between today's Court Avenue and Magnolia Avenue (originally named "Main Street").&lt;ref&gt;http://land.allears.net/blogs/jackspence/2012/07/a_brief_history_of_orlando_par.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A fire in 1884 almost destroyed the entire town. Before the fire, most of the structures in Orlando were built with wood and the town was without fire protection. The town began to rebuild and a fire brigade was formed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.frommers.com/destinations/orlando/681710&lt;/ref&gt; Orlando became a [[city]] in 1885 and the arrival of the [[Atlantic Coast Line Railroad]] in 1890 brought tremendous growth. Commercial activity shifted away from the courthouse and moved to the new railroad depot located on Church Street. Settlers from [[England]] arrived in Orlando and established homes and businesses. One of the newly arrived Englishmen was named Joseph Bumby. He and his family settled in the town and built a [[hardware store]] known as "Bumby Hardware Store". The store remained an Orlando fixture until the 1960s, but the name "Bumby" is still famous in the city.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1993-01-24/news/9301210657_1_bumby-orlando-robinson-springs/2&lt;/ref&gt; The location of the hardware store is now a [[Hamburger Mary's]].

=== Downtown's heyday ===
By the 1920s, Orlando had grown from a cattle town to a major [[citrus]] growing center. The [[Florida land boom of the 1920s]] brought many newcomers to the city. The population increase led to the construction of the Orlando Public Library in 1923, the Orlando Municipal Auditorium (now Bob Carr Performing Arts Centre) in 1926, and several grand hotels; namely the [[Angebilt Hotel]] and San Juan Hotel. By this time, the city's population had grown to 9,000 people.

=== Great Depression to post-war years ===
The federal government's Works Progress Administration programs during the [[Great Depression]] helped Orlando remain economically stable. New parks were developed, the Municipal Airport (now [[Orlando Executive Airport]]) was built, and the city also built a new football stadium at [[Tinker Field]] (now the site of [[Florida Citrus Bowl]]). By 1944, enough jobs were created to increase the city's population to 45,000 people. Orlando became a major military center when [[World War II]] brought the development of [[McCoy Air Force Base]] and Pinecastle AFB, located southeast of downtown. This status intensified with the 1968 opening of the Orlando Naval Training Center east of downtown.

=== Decline and redevelopment ===
[[Walt Disney World]]'s 1971 opening in southwest Orange County brought major development to Orlando, but relatively little to the downtown area. During this time, development in downtown was mainly focused upon the construction of office towers, such as the Citrus Center and the original Sunbank building. However, downtown began to fall into a state of decline. The [[Angebilt Hotel]] and "San Juan Hotels" were abandoned and left to crumble. The San Juan was eventually demolished in 1980, but the [[Angebilt Hotel]] at 37 N Orange Ave which was built in 1923 would be transformed in modern times into an office building with retail on the ground floor. Lake Eola Park became a haven for prostitutes and drug addicts. In addition, downtown department stores and family owned businesses closed or moved to the newly constructed [[Orlando Fashion Square]] mall. After the opening of Interstate 4, the downtown population base moved out of downtown to the suburbs.

Efforts to revitalize downtown began in the mid 1970s and continued into the 1980s. Bob Snow opened ''Rosie O'Grady's'' in 1974 at [[Church Street Station (Orlando)|Church Street Station]], which quickly became a popular attraction. In the mid 1980s, several skyscrapers were constructed; including [[SunTrust Center]] and Barnett Plaza (now Bank of America Center). [[Lake Eola]] Park was redesigned and the Walt Disney Amphitheater opened in the park around the same time the annual "Orlando Shakespeare Festival" was established. On the other hand, downtown's population base still had yet to rebound to previous levels and major corporations were still opening locations outside of the city center.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.city-data.com/us-cities/The-South/Orlando-History.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Orlando City Hall building, the city's third, opened in 1991 directly behind the previous City Hall, constructed in 1958. To clear the area for future development, the Orlando City Council chose to implode the 1950s building. The event was met with much local fanfare and was filmed for use in the opening scenes of the 1992 film [[Lethal Weapon 3]]. The area cleared is now occupied by [[CNL Financial Group|CNL]] City Center Commons.

=== Recent years ===
Until the late 1990s, downtown was relatively small compared to other cities of Orlando's size. A [[building boom]] began in 1998 and continued through the 2000s decade. New commercial towers sprouted along Orange Avenue and residential towers were constructed around Lake Eola and along Magnolia Ave. [[CNL Financial Group]] established a major footprint in downtown with the construction of CNL City Center Commons, a complex of office towers surrounding Orlando City Hall. CNL continues to expand their presence downtown. As a result of the construction boom, downtown density doubled and Orlando's skyline dramatically changed. In 2005, the term "[[Manhattanization]]" was locally applied to Orange Avenue when a large number of construction cranes loomed over downtown. The late 2000s recession slowed large intensity skyscraper construction; but infill development continued downtown including construction of the [[Amway Center]] in 2009.

In 2011, construction began on phase one of the long-awaited [[Dr. Phillips Center for Performing Arts]] across from City Hall along Orange Ave.

== High-rise Buildings ==
The majority of the tallest towers in Central Florida are located downtown. Of the 79 existing high-rises in the [[Greater Orlando]] region, 46 are located downtown.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/ci/bu/sk/li/?id=101340&amp;bt=5&amp;ht=2&amp;sro=60&lt;/ref&gt;

The tallest [[High-rise building|high-rises]] in Orlando are:
* [[Suntrust Center]], 1988, {{convert|441|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} is the tallest building in [[Central Florida]].
* [[The Vue at Lake Eola]], 2008, {{convert|426|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}
* The [[Orange County Courthouse (Florida)|Orange County Courthouse]], 1997, {{convert|416|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}
* The [[Bank of America Center (Orlando)|Bank of America Center]], 1988, {{convert|404|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}
* [[55 West on the Esplanade]], 2009, {{convert|377|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}
* [[Solaire at the Plaza]], 2006, {{convert|359|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}
* One Eleven Building, 2009, {{convert|357|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}
* SunTrust Center at Church Street Station, Under Construction, 326&amp;nbsp;ft (100 m)
*Citi Tower, 2017, {{convert|292|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}
* Modera Central, 2018, 260&amp;nbsp;ft (80m)
*Citrus Center, 1971, {{convert|258|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}
* Premier Trade Plaza Orlando, 2006, {{convert|256|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}
* [[CNL Center City Commons]], 1999, {{convert|250|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}

Towers built in downtown Orlando have not exceeded {{convert|441|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} since the completion of the Suntrust Center in 1988. There has never been an "official" reason why, but local architects speculate it is due to the [[Orlando Executive Airport]] location just east of downtown. The airport's flight path is over the city center, thus the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] has imposed height restrictions.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

== Transportation ==
Downtown Orlando is served by three main arteries, two limited access highways, several secondaries, and many byways.

&lt;big&gt;'''Public Transportation'''&lt;/big&gt;

'''Bus'''

The Central Florida Regional Transportation Authority (CFRTA), better known as [[Lynx]], operates the regional bus service with its central station and offices located at 455 N Garland Avenue.

Lynx Operates a [[zero-fare]] bus route called [[Lymmo]] (Link 31) along a completely separate and dedicated [[Right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]]. Because this bus system runs on its own right-of-way and controls the traffic signaling, in most cases it is superior to automobile travel within the downtown area. Lymmo service also runs along the Orange Avenue corridor, north to Florida Hospital and south to Michigan Avenue. There is also an east/west connection from the [[Citrus Bowl]] to South Eola.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lymmostudy.com/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130128011448/http://www.lymmostudy.com/index.html |archivedate=2013-01-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rail'''

Downtown is served by an [[Orlando (Amtrak station)|Amtrak station]] about a mile south of the central business district.  The ''[[Silver Meteor]]'' and ''[[Silver Star (Amtrak train)|Silver Star]]'' lines provide train service to [[New York City]], Miami and Tampa.

Construction began in 2012 on [[SunRail]], a North-South [[commuter rail]] that will run mostly along existing [[CSX]]/[[Amtrak]] rails. Launched in 2014, it provides service between the northern suburb of DeLand to the southern suburb of Poinciana. A large transfer station, the LYNX Central Station, currently handles Lynx bus transfers and was constructed to accommodate the large capacity expected from SunRail. Further development is underway to extend the service to multiple additional points south. Connections to the Orlando International Airport (MCO) and to other lines connecting to South Florida (All Aboard Florida) are being evaluated.

'''Air'''

The [[Orlando Executive Airport]] is located {{convert|4|mi|km}} east of the CBD. While technically not in downtown proper, the airport serves the downtown district.

== Plans ==
The '''Triple Crown for Downtown''', a construction initiative involving three high intensity public works projects, began in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityoforlando.net/elected/mayor/speeches/state_downtown_06.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626063007/http://www.cityoforlando.net/elected/mayor/speeches/state_downtown_06.htm |archivedate=2010-06-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Amway Center]] - The first initiative of the Triple Crown. Construction began in 2008 and was completed in October, 2010. It is the new home of the [[Orlando Magic]], Orlando Solar Bears and the [[Orlando Predators]] of the [[Arena Football League (2010)|Arena Football League]]. In addition to other events, the venue has brought major concerts back to Orlando.
* [[Dr. Phillips Center for Performing Arts]] - Located across from City Hall on Orange Ave, it will replace the [[Bob Carr Performing Arts Centre]] and will be built in phases. Phase I began in 2012 and will include a 2,800 seat amplified hall and a 300-seat theater for smaller productions. Phase II, construction date unknown, will include a 1,700 seat acoustic hall for ballet, orchestra, and opera performances.
* [[Florida Citrus Bowl]] - Located to the west of downtown, the Florida Citrus Bowl is an outdoor venue for sports and large events. The structure is undergoing major reconstruction with partial demolition having begun in late January 2014. Reconstruction will cost just under $200 million and, upon completion in April 2015, will be approximately 80% new.&lt;ref&gt;http://bungalower.com/2014/01/citrus-bowl-demolition-begins-today/&lt;/ref&gt;

A more ambitious project planned for downtown calls for completely transforming the '''Orlando Centroplex''', the home of the former [[Amway Arena]], into a "Creative Village". The project is to be privately funded and plans call for satellite schools for the [[University of Central Florida]] and the [[University of Florida]], {{convert|1000000|sqft|m2}} of office space, residential apartment buildings, and a large central park with sporting facilities and an amphitheater.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2010-05-12/news/os-magic-arena-creative-village-20100512_1_development-team-new-orlando-magic-arena-thornton-park-central&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dragons' Den''''' is a [[Television in the United Kingdom|British]] television programme, hosted by [[Evan Davis]]. The format of the show is owned by [[Sony Pictures Television]] and is based on the original [[Dragons' Den#Japan|Japanese programme]], which has been sold around the world. The programme has been produced by [[BBC Manchester]] since its inception and was first broadcast on [[BBC Two]] on 4 January 2005.

The show allows several [[entrepreneurs]] an opportunity to present their varying business ideas to a panel of five wealthy investors, the "Dragons" of the show's title, and pitch for financial investment while offering a stake of the company in return.

==Programme==

===Format===
Contestants have what they perceive to be a viable and potentially profitable business idea but lack funding, or are already operating their business but need additional funds for promotion or expansion. As part of their opening pitch, they are required to specify the amount of money they require from the Dragons. The rules stipulate that if they do not raise at least this amount from one or more Dragons, then they would leave with nothing. In exchange for the investment, the contestants offer [[Stock|equity]] in their business, the percentage of which is also stipulated at the beginning of the pitch. If the Dragons see potential in the business idea or product, negotiations then take place around the amount of equity on offer, with the contestant having the opportunity to negotiate further, accept any offers, or simply walk away. Dragons can also offer a percentage of the money requested if they do not wish to commit the full amount, leaving the other Dragons free to do the same. This can lead to the contestant receiving the financial backing of more than one Dragon, with the benefit of a broader range of expertise. However, for this to occur, the contestant usually has to agree to relinquish a larger share in their business than they had first planned.

A Dragon who, having heard the pitch, does not wish to invest, must declare themselves "out", implying that they leave the discussion. (However, on one occasion in series 4, [[Peter Jones (entrepreneur)|Peter Jones]] continued to question an entrepreneur after his own declaration.) This concluding phase may range from a few minutes if the Dragons don't perceive the business plan as credible, to much longer when complex conditions are negotiated. The Dragons often ridicule contestants, on grounds that vary widely, but especially for over-valuation of their respective enterprises.

===Set and theme===
The opening sequence was shot in [[Ancoats]], [[Manchester]], an area transformed by the [[Industrial Revolution]] which helped give the city its nickname [[Cottonopolis]].&lt;ref name="ancoats"&gt;{{cite web |title=New lair for Dragon's Den? |last=Bourne |first=Dianne |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/tv_and_showbiz/s/1268619_new_lair_for_dragons_den |publisher=Manchester Evening News Media |date=24 June 2010 |accessdate=1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sequence features shots of [[Brunswick Mill, Ancoats|Brunswick Mill]], [[Murrays' Mills]] and [[McConnel &amp; Kennedy mills]] - all three are Manchester's most famous [[cotton mills]] in production at the time of the Industrial Revolution and keeps in line with the programme's [[warehouse]] theme.&lt;ref name="ancoats" /&gt; The location at which the pitches are filmed has varied over the years. It was originally filmed inside a furniture depository in [[Stoke Newington]]. The production were forced to move after the first series owing to building work next door. For the second series shooting took place in a disused warehouse, [[Wool House]]. It was then that the first set was created by production designer Laurence Williams, requiring the construction of a section of the window wall and the staircase down to the lower floor. The owner of this warehouse converted it into flats necessitating a further move to Tanner Street for the next few series. Here another more extensive set was created including cutting a hole in the floor and again creating the stairs down to the lower floor. Building work required yet again a move to Pinewood Studios only two weeks before a series was due to be shot and the production designer had to create a complete set on the film stage including a staircase which descended down into the underfloor tank. After several more series were shot at Pinewood, the production was moved to the [[BBC]]'s new home in [[Salford Quays]] at [[Dock10 (television facility)|dock10]], [[MediaCityUK]]. A brand new set was created for the move and was screened in the latter part of 2012 for Series 10.&lt;ref name="newhome"&gt;{{cite web |title=Dragons, we've moved your chairs ... |last=Lewens |first=Sam |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/aboutthebbc/2012/01/dragons-weve-moved-your-chairs.shtml |publisher=BBC |date=5 January 2012 |accessdate=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special episodes==

===''Where Are They Now?''===
''Where Are They Now?'' is a companion series to the main programme, often broadcast after each respective series, taking a look back at some of the show's success stories - and biggest failures - and finding out what the participants are up to six months on.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dragonsden/wherearetheynow/ Dragons' Den | Where Are They Now?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828030636/http://www.bbc.co.uk/dragonsden/wherearetheynow/ |date=28 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The series began with a one-off two part special, broadcast on 21 and 28 December 2005, in which presenter Evan Davis reviewed the programme's success stories from series one and two, and looked at the entrepreneurs who received funds to market their ideas. Cameras followed Charles Ejogo, who planned to put umbrella vending machines in [[London Underground]] stations, jewellery designer Elizabeth Galton, magazine publisher Huw Gwyther and Rachel Lowe, whose London-based board game caught their eye. Following this, another one-off two part special was broadcast on 28 September – 8 October 2006. Later, two full series of the show were commissioned, with series one, of four episodes, being broadcast between 18 July and 2 August 2007.

Series two, of five episodes, each following a respective dragon and their investments, was broadcast between 17 September and 24 October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00tvb0v |title=BBC Two - Dragons' Den, What Happened Next, Peter Jones |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=24 September 2010 |accessdate=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Jones' episode followed him meeting with Kirsty Henshaw, who made an emotional pitch in the Den when she came in with her frozen dessert business, and was determined to get her product on the supermarket shelves as soon as possible, and also meeting up with condiment king Levi Roots. Duncan Bannatyne's episode followed him as he travelled to the south of France to oversee his daughter's wedding, and then went back to work to follow up on some of his investments. Theo Paphitis' episode followed him as he took 90 employees to Greece for a week of team-building exercises, and also visited two companies he invested in to see how they were getting on. Series five, episode nine also featured at a look back at deals from the series, in a similar vein to ''Where Are They Now?''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/episode/h2nj/dragons-den--series-5---episode-9|title=Dragons' Den|work=RadioTimes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Outside the Den''===
''Outside the Den'' takes a step back from the world of Dragons' Den, to take a personal look at the Dragons themselves, including personal and intimate interviews, a look behind their business credentials, and taking the cameras into their personal lives. Six episodes of the series have been produced - with the first set of five episodes airing between 27 October and 23 November 2008, and following Theo Paphitis, James Caan, Deborah Meaden, Peter Jones and Duncan Bannatyne in their own respective programmes. A further episode, focusing on new dragon Hilary Devey, was broadcast over three years later on 29 December 2011.

===''The Best of Dragons' Den''===
''The Best of Dragons' Den'' focuses on presenter Evan Davis taking a look back at the best and worst pitches from the past series of the show, as well as revealing some unseen pitches that were so bad, they didn't make it to broadcast, and talking candidly with the Dragons involved. Two series of the show were produced, the first accompanying series two, with three episodes being broadcast between 19 January and 2 February 2006, and the second accompanying series six, with three episodes being broadcast between 23 February and 9 March 2009.

===''Dragons' Den: On Tour''===
''Dragons' Den: On Tour'' was a series of five episodes which aired between 6 September and 7 October 2009. Each episode follows the Dragons (James Caan, Deborah Meaden, Peter Jones, Theo Paphitis and Duncan Bannatyne) as they travel by bus around the United Kingdom to find out what some of the budding entrepreneurs who had appeared on the show have been up to since, including success stories, awful failures, and some very obvious missed opportunities.

===''Dragons' Den: Online''===
''Dragons' Den: Online'' was a special, online version of the show, which follows the same format as the main show, but is presented by [[Dominic Byrne]], and features Shaf Rasul and [[Julie Meyer]] as the Dragons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dragonsden/onlineden/ |title=Dragons' Den - The Dragons |publisher=BBC |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of being set inside a Den, entrepreneurs pitch to the two Dragons via online video pitches, and subsequent interaction through webcam chat. The highest amount of money on offer is £50,000, which the Dragons can only individually invest in any one business. Episodes were posted weekly, for six weeks from 16 September 2009 to 7 October 2009, and viewers could participate by rating business plans before the two dragons offered their verdict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paidcontent.co.uk/article/419-ariadnes-julie-meyer-becomes-dragon-for-new-online-only-den/ |title=Ariadne’s Julie Meyer Becomes Dragon for New Online-Only Den |accessdate=18 March 2009 |publisher= |last=Andrews |first=Robert |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716153956/http://paidcontent.co.uk/article/419-ariadnes-julie-meyer-becomes-dragon-for-new-online-only-den/ |archivedate=16 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other programmes===
A number of one-off specials accompanying the broadcast of the main show have also been produced, often as Christmas specials or charity specials. The following eight programmes have been aired thus far:

===''Pitches to Riches''===
Two episode of ''Dragons' Den: Pitches to Riches'' were presented by TV host [[Richard Osman]] and aired on 28 February and 31 December 2016. The show looked back on some of the most successful pitches in the den.

==Successful people==
Some contestants have gone on to reach the market with their products despite being turned down by the Dragons and have met with a range of success. Examples include [[hungryhouse.co.uk]], a website for online ordering of home delivered takeaway food, ''[[Destination (game)|Destination London]]'', a [[board game]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/small-business/article.html?in_article_id=450663&amp;in_page_id=10|title=Dragons' Den: The rejects that got rich|work=This is Money}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Tangle Teezer]], a hairbrush designed to smooth knotted hair;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tangleteezer.com/timeline.php|title=Tangle Teezer Timeline|website=www.tangleteezer.com|access-date=8 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160708091917/http://www.tangleteezer.com/timeline.php|archive-date=8 July 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1046966/Dragons-Den-reject-laugh-hair-Tangle-Teezer-stocked-Boots.html|title=Dragons' Den reject has the last laugh after hair Tangle Teezer is stocked by Boots|work=Mail Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Trunki]], travel luggage designed for children;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/work/small-business/article.html?in_article_id=429316&amp;in_page_id=10|title=Dragons' Den reject now on top: Rob Law and Trunki luggage - This is Money|work=This is Money}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smarterproducts.co.uk/acatalog/SmarterProducts-Designers.html|title=Rob Law profile|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20071101075813/http://www.smarterproducts.co.uk/acatalog/SmarterProducts-Designers.html|archivedate=1 November 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the BarbeSkew, a rotisserie [[barbecue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://barbeskew.com/2010/08/dragons-den/|title=Dragons Den - Dragons Den BBQ - Dragons Den Barbeque - BarbeSkew on Dragons Den - barbeskew|work=barbeskew.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rejected offers===
In Series 2, Danny Bamping accepted an offer of £100,000 for 30% of his company Bedlam Puzzles, offered in a joint deal with both Rachel Elnaugh and Theo Paphitis investing, but rejected it after the show, opting to get a bank loan instead, claiming that he had a stronger vision for the company than either of his investors. His strategy was successful, as the show generated enough publicity to boost online sales of his [[Bedlam cube]], increasing from his then current sales tally of 23 to 4,500 sales on the days after the show's airing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WtaKvWS9Jh0|title=DragonsDen - Where Are They Now (S02E01)|first=|last=Dragons' Den|date=1 April 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Series 3, Fenella Lindsell and Lara Goodbody rejected an offer of £200,000 for 30% from Richard Farleigh, to invest in their [[Yogabugs]] workout company. They also rejected an offer of £100,000 for 15% of the business made by Peter Jones, in a joint deal with Farleigh, and left the den without investment, stating their reason to be that they believed the company was worth more than what the dragons valued it at. Since then, the pair have gone on to build a franchise operation, with over 150 stores in the UK selling the product. Tamlyn Thompson rejected Richard Farleigh's offer of 50% for [[Document imaging|ID Scan Biometric]], the company was worth over 2 million in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://companycheck.co.uk/company/04779960/ID-SCAN-BIOMETRICS-LIMITED/group-structure|title=ID SCAN BIOMETRICS LIMITED.

In Series 6, Episode 2 - an entrepreneur made history on the show. Up to this point, it was the biggest offer ever made in the series and he said No. The company was called Diamond Geezer - an online company selling a wide range of jewellery online. They offered him a staggering £255k for 40% of his business. He was only willing to meet them at 30% but no deal could be reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2008/jul/28/dragonsdenseries6episode2|title=Dragons' Den - Series 6, Episode 2|last=Stephens|first=Heidi|date=28 July 2008|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Series 10, father and son team Michael and Joe Smith rejected an offer of £50,000 for 50% of their Wheelbarrow Accessory company, offered by Duncan Bannatyne, and again rejected an offer for the same amount of money and equity, but split down the middle, with Duncan and Hilary Devey each bringing £25,000 and asking for 25%. The pair valued their company at £500,000, and Michael failed to deny claims that he was more interested in the money than help from an investor, when challenged by Deborah Meaden. Also in series 10, Dustin Toland rejected an offer of £100,000 from both Deborah Meaden and Theo Paphitis for 45% of his company Gigwam, a new tent system for outdoor events. He revealed the maximum amount of equity he would be prepared to give away was 25%, and subsequently declined.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.innovate-design.co.uk/news/index.php/inventor-turns-down-dragons-and-braves-it-alone/ Inventor turns down Dragons and braves it alone], 16 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In episode 8, A to E Training &amp; Solutions Ltd turned down an offer for the full £50,000 from Duncan Bannatyne for 32% of their resuscitation and life support business. The trio felt that the equity asked for was too great and left the Den with nothing.

In Series 11, Duncan Bannatyne offered £50,000 to Linkee Ltd for 40% of its board game business, but the trio behind the company felt it was too great a percentage and were unable to negotiate with Bannatyne, and so turned him down. Also in series 11, Deborah Meaden offered Tim Morgan £100,000 for 15% of his Mountain Trike Company. However, the maximum he and his shareholders had already agreed to give away was 5%, and so he had to turn her down. Also in Series 11, husband and wife team Roger and Leslie rejected a combined offer from Peter Jones and Duncan Bannatyne of 50% of their wool bedding company Baavet, for £130,000. In the final episode of Series 11, after accepting Peter Jones and Deborah Meaden's offer of £50,000 for 40% (later dropping to 30%) of his company Bobo Buddies, James Roupell turned the deal down after filming. Instead, he found the financial help he required elsewhere, without giving up any equity of his company.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/10669753/Dragon-slayer-rejects-the-entire-Den.html Dragon slayer rejects the entire Den], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 2 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In series 12, Daniel and Mat of Pure Pet Food turned down both Deborah Meaden and Kelly Hoppen's offers of £40,000 for 30% and 20% respectively, as they thought the equity levels being asked for were too high.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thetalentzone.co.uk/blog/daniel-eha-and-matthew-cockcroft-from-pure-pet-foods-rejects-investment-for-their-dog-food-business-on-dragons-den/ http://thetalentzone.co.uk/blog/daniel-eha-and-matthew-cockcroft-from-pure-pet-foods-rejects-investment-for-their-dog-food-business-on-dragons-den/], 27 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in series 12, owner of gourmet marshmallow company Mallow &amp; Marsh,
Harriet Pleydell-Bouverie, turned down both Peter Jones and Deborah Meaden who wanted 40% and 33⅓% of the company respectively in exchange for £65,000 (although Peter offered her £80,000), as she felt that would be undervaluing the company.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/marshmallow-maker-proves-shes-no-soft-touch-telling-tv-dragons-im-out-9665453.html Marshmallow maker proves she's no soft touch telling Dragons Den: I’m out], 13 August 2014, ''[[London Evening Standard]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In Episode 10, Cally Russell rejected Peter Jones' offer of £75,000 for 20% of his company Mallzee, a mobile shopping app, even after Peter offered to drop to 15% once investment was repaid.

In series 13, Ellen Green, company director of the Blue Badge Company, declined Touker Suleyman's offer of £70,000 for 35% of her company, as it was "simply too high" for her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2015/aug/23/dragons-den-turned-down-touker-suleyman-investment|title=Dragons' Den: Why I turned down Touker Suleyman's £70,000 investment|author=Kitty Dann|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in series 13 Jo Hilditch rejected Peter Jones' offer of £50,000 for 30% of her wine-making company, British Cassis, as it was over her upper limit of 25% on advice from her accountant. In episode 10 of the same series, Roy Fitter rejected Peter Jones' offer of £80,000 for 30% of his company, Ram Training Ltd, a horror events company. In episode 13, Yann Morvan and Richard Lee rejected Peter Jones and Nick Jenkins offer of £75,000 for 30% of their portable drumming business Aerodrums, as the maximum amount of equity they were prepared to give away was 20%.

In series 14, Sam Coley and Steve Pearce, co-founders of [[TickX]], the event and ticketing search engine, rejected offers of £75,000 from Nick Jenkins and Peter Jones for 20% equity and one from Touker Suleyman for 15% as they felt the dragons had undervalued the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roue|first1=Lucy|title=Pair turn down THREE offers on Dragons' Den, but are still flying high|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/business/business-news/dragons-den-tickx-reject-investment-12397923|website=Manchester Evening News|accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since filming, the duo went on to raise £750,000 through 24Haymarket and have launched the world's first [[Facebook]] Messenger [[chatbot]] for live events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Watts|first1=Julia|title=Dragons’ Den success stories: TickX|url=https://startups.co.uk/dragons-den-success-stories-tickx/|website=Startups|accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

=== ''Sunday Mirror'' investigation ===
Although the BBC has never made any secret of deals that succeeded or fell through, usually offering a follow up in the final episode of the series, in September 2006 an investigation by the ''[[Sunday Mirror]]'' newspaper criticised the show, reporting that most of the deals were unfulfilled after the programmes were shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_20060917/ai_n16735087/ | work=Sunday Mirror | first=Nick | last=Owens | title=Dragons' Con | date=17 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The article claimed that the Dragons either pulled out of the deals over minor technicalities, deliberately offered heavily unfavourable terms to the entrepreneurs in an effort to make them withdraw, or simply broke off all contact with them after the recording. The Dragons however defended their record, blaming the failures on the entrepreneurs themselves who were dishonest about their products, with Duncan Bannatyne stating: "We don't hand over money to people who don't tell the truth.", while Theo Paphitis added: "I kept up my end of the bargain. The show is not about a cash prize, it is about us pledging to invest. But people must tell the truth. Simple."

A BBC spokesman said: "After the initial agreement is made on camera, both parties enter a period of [[due diligence]]. Sometimes during this period the deals fall through."&lt;ref&gt;Sunday Mirror (2006) [http://www.sundaymirror.co.uk/news/tm_objectid=17762194%26method=full%26siteid=62484%26headline=dragons%2d%2dcon-name_page.html Sunday Mirror] Retrieved 17 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Sunday Telegraph'' research ===

In February 2015, ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'' newspaper published a report that revealed that half of ''Dragons' Den'' investments fall through after the show once the cameras stop rolling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/businessclub/money/11425328/Half-of-Dragons-Den-investments-fall-through-after-the-show.html | work=Sunday Telegraph | first=Rebecca | last=Burn-Callander | title=Half of Dragons' Den investments fall through after the show | date=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study, carried out by Tiger Mobiles, who unsuccessfully applied to appear on the show in 2008, looked in depth at all 143 businesses that won cash on the show between series 1 and 11, revealing just £5.8m of the £13m pledged was ever invested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dragons' Den - Where Are They Now?|url=https://www.tigermobiles.com/dragons-den/|publisher=Tiger Mobiles|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When quizzed about the numbers, [[Deborah Meaden]] defended her position informing the ''Telegraph'': "I've had entrepreneurs with extremely unfortunate health issues, patent issues, and two or three silences where I never hear from them again." Meaden also added that "The world explodes for businesses after Dragons’ Den, they get offered better deals in some cases, or think they don’t need the Dragons. But what they find when the publicity dies down is that they still need help running the business."

From Series 1 to 11 the research uncovered:

* 76 out of the total 143 agreed investments never went through after the den.
* 23 of the 143 business that successfully pitched are no longer trading.
* Of the £13 million pledged by the Dragons, only £5.8 million was ever invested.
* £250,000 is the highest amount ever successfully pitched for in the Den.
* However, on the two occasions £250,000 was offered, neither investment went through after the show.
* £100,000 is the most common investment figure asked for by pitchers (30 of 143 pitches)
* £35,000 is the lowest ever amount offered for a successful pitch, for the youdoodoll, Deborah Meaden did invest.
* [[Peter Jones (entrepreneur)|Peter Jones]] was the most prolific investor, offering investment to 54 of the 143 businesses who successfully pitched on the show.
* The highest amount of equity ever given away in the den was 79% by RKA Records, which has since renamed to Bannatyne Music Ltd.
* The most common amount of equity given away in successful pitches was 40%, with 42 of 143 pitches giving up that share in their company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Interactive Dragons’ Den Content – How We Made It and Why We Did It|url=https://www.tigermobiles.com/2015/02/dragons-den-how-we-made-it-and-why-we-did-it/|publisher=Tiger Mobiles|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dan Forster, who compiled the research for Tiger Mobiles, claimed that the issue was less about the structure of deals and more about the kind of companies that the BBC invites to take part in the show. "The problem lies with the BBC, who, in a bid to keep the viewer count high, have turned the show into a contrived affair that’s more about viewer entertainment than genuine business success.

A BBC spokesman commented on Forster's claims, saying: "We are proud of our record of achieving investment offers in the den and we look into every detail of a business before they are offered a slot on the show. The BBC plays no role in the deal after recording, and we accept that it is typical for some angel investments to fall down at the due diligence stage." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Burn-Callander|first1=Rebecca|title=Welcome to the Dragons' Den of broken dreams|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/festival-of-business/11425274/Welcome-to-the-Dragons-Den-of-broken-dreams.html|accessdate=23 February 2015|publisher=Sunday Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Departures==

===Simon Woodroffe===
After only one series of the programme, Simon Woodroffe left the panel. Woodroffe stated that the reason behind his departure was "The show became a battle of egos — not a forum for business innovation. The thing to remember was that when you walk up the stairs to pitch, it’s not five people necessarily thinking 'How am I going to be able to make an investment here?', they’re also thinking: 'Am I going to be the star of this next little piece?'. That's not how I was told the show would go down."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Zoe Brennan |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1354734/Den-dashed-dreams-How-Dragons-dont-word-cameras-stop-rolling.html |title=Den of dashed dreams: How the Dragons don't always keep their word when the cameras stop rolling &amp;#124; Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=8 February 2011 |accessdate=25 November 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rachel Elnaugh===
Shortly before the launch of the second series in 2005, Rachel Elnaugh's company [[Red Letter Days]] went into [[Administration (insolvency)|administration]] and its remaining assets were bought by fellow dragons Peter Jones and Theo Paphitis. Although Elnaugh was at the helm before and at the time of the company's failure, she blamed the problems on the actions of the last CEO whom she appointed in 2002, whilst she took a non-executive role to have her fourth child. Following making only five investments over the course of two series, as a result of disputes with various Dragons, and the continuing uncomfortable position of the BBC allowing a perceived "failed" business person to continue investing on the show, she agreed to leave the ''Dragons' Den'' panel.&lt;ref&gt;Real Business October 2009 {{cite web |url=http://www.realbusiness.co.uk/news/business-woman/5701456/rachel-elnaugh-i-thought-my-life-was-over.thtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=16 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091228035844/http://www.realbusiness.co.uk/news/business-woman/5701456/rachel-elnaugh-i-thought-my-life-was-over.thtml |archivedate=28 December 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Doug Richard===
Shortly after the conclusion of the second series in 2005, Doug Richard announced his departure from the show. Richard stated in an interview that his departure was due to "six hours of TV taking six weeks to film", and not being able to split his time between filming and running all of his businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tara Evans |url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/article-1630204/Interview-Doug-Richard.html |title=Dragon's Den interview: Doug Richard on entrepreneurs |publisher=Thisismoney.co.uk |date=17 April 2008 |accessdate=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Richard Farleigh===
It was announced on 18 May 2007 that [[Richard Farleigh]] had been dropped from the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/may/18/bbc.broadcasting1 | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Ben | last=Dowell | title=I'm out: dragon dropped from den | date=18 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Daily Mail]]'' suggested that this might have been in order to have a new Dragon from an ethnic minority.&lt;ref name="dailymail.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-455837/Dragons-Den-panelist-ousted-wrong-colour.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=Dragon's Den panelist ousted for being the 'wrong colour' | date=18 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farleigh said, "It would be disappointing if that was the reason - rather than anything fundamental - if it was because I was the wrong colour. I don't know why this has happened and I am very disappointed and bemused - I wasn't expecting it because all the feedback I got was very positive. I had even moved back to the UK to focus on commitments for the show. I am gutted that I have not been invited back."&lt;ref name="dailymail.co.uk" /&gt;  The suggestions in the ''Daily Mail'' report were rejected by the BBC who said the new Dragon would be chosen by their "business credentials" and not ethnicity. A BBC spokesman said it was normal that the show sometimes changed its team. Farleigh's replacement was the British-Pakistani businessman [[James Caan (entrepreneur)|James Caan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===James Caan===
In April 2010, the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' reported that James Caan and Duncan Bannatyne were involved in a 'bitter row' over tax. Bannatyne claimed Pakistan-born Caan had an 'unfair' business advantage due to his non-domiciled tax status. He complained that, because Caan does not pay UK tax on his overseas earnings, he has more money to invest in his UK ventures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1268284/Dragons-Den-Duncan-Bannatyne-demands-apology-James-Caan.html James Caan owes ME an apology after refusing to shake my hand, says Duncan Bannatyne as row between Dragons takes another ugly turn], 23 April 2010, ''[[Daily Mail]]''.

===Hilary Devey===
In June 2012, it was announced that after only two series in the show, [[Hilary Devey]] would be departing the show to front her own business series for [[Channel 4]]. She appeared in the tenth series which aired in Autumn 2012. Devey was replaced by [[Kelly Hoppen]] for the eleventh series in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a385057/hilary-devey-quits-dragons-den-after-two-series.html |title=Hilary Devey quits 'Dragons' Den' after two series - TV News |publisher=Digital Spy |date=1 June 2012 |accessdate=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theo Paphitis===
On 7 February 2013, [[Theo Paphitis]] said that he would be leaving ''Dragons' Den'' due to other commitments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/9854671/Im-out-Theo-Paphitis-leaves-Dragons-Den.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Alice | last=Vincent | title='I'm out', Theo Paphitis leaves Dragons' Den | date=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theopaphitis.com/theo-news.html|title=Theo Paphitis - News|work=theopaphitis.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paphitis was replaced by [[Piers Linney]] from Series 11 onwards.

===Piers Linney===
Linney announced that he would be departing the show at the end of series twelve, in order to focus on various other projects and work related to enterprise, diversity and inclusion, including his not-for-profit digital platform, workinsight.org

===Kelly Hoppen===
On 11 August 2013, Hoppen became one of the new dragons on BBC Two's ''Dragons' Den'' following the departure of Hilary Devey. On 23 January 2015, she announced her departure from the show after two series.

===Duncan Bannatyne===
It was announced in July 2014 that, due to "other business commitments", Bannatyne would be departing from the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-28216556|title=Duncan Bannatyne quits Dragons' Den|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; His final appearance was in the last episode of series 12, in which he made an investment jointly with Peter Jones in a cash-and-carry business seeking finance for a new sports drink. This leaves Jones as the only remaining original Dragon.

===Sarah Willingham===
Willingham departed the show on 31 January 2017 after 2 series, confirming that she had decided to take a year out travelling with her family and was unable to take part in the programme.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-4177598/Nick-Jenkins-Sarah-Willingham-axed-Dragons-Den.html|title=Dragons' Den stars Nick Jenkins and Sarah Willingham axed from series|newspaper=Mail Online|access-date=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nick Jenkins===
Jenkins confirmed he was leaving on 31 January 2017 alongside Sarah Willingham, also after 2 series. On the decision, he commented that he was leaving the den to concentrate on his educational technology businesses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Spoofs==
[[Duncan Bannatyne]] appeared as himself in a recurring sketch in the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] television show ''[[Al Murray's Multiple Personality Disorder]]'' titled "Duncan's Den", a parody of ''Dragons' Den'', where Duncan is the only Dragon. [[Al Murray]] plays the role of [[Evan Davis]], and in each successive sketch there is only one applicant, the hopelessly nervous and commercially inept, recent divorcee Carole Price, played by [[Laura Solon]].

[[Kayvan Novak]] created a parody of the show called "Lizard's Lair" for his character Terry Tibbs on an episode of his show ''[[Facejacker]]'' where unsuspecting entrepreneurs were led to believe they could receive an investment from Terry in a very similar style to ''Dragons' Den''.

[[Peter Jones (entrepreneur)|Peter Jones]], [[Deborah Meaden]], and [[Duncan Bannatyne]] appear as themselves in a satirical dream sequence in a series 6 episode titled "Conned Out of Luck" of the BBC show, ''[[Hustle (TV series)|Hustle]]''.

The sketch show ''[[Harry &amp; Paul]]'' has featured a series of parodies by [[Harry Enfield]] and [[Paul Whitehouse]], where through careful editing the pair portray all the characters, including Davis (Whitehouse), the contestants unsuccessfully pitching various bizarre ideas (e.g. a '[[kitten]] stomper' device) and a parodied cast of the Dragons. The emphasis is particularly on the entrepreneurs' names (e.g. 'Duncan [[Guillotine]]') and personalities (Meaden is simply 'The Grumpy Woman' – Enfield in drag). In one sketch parodying the [[banking crisis]], Enfield's old character [[Harry Enfield and Chums|Tim Nice-But-Dim]] made an appearance and was revealed to be "obviously" the brother of 'Peter Jones (John Lewis)'. Enfield and Whitehouse brought back their portrayals of the characters for three [[Comic Relief]] sketches, where they play Victorian counterparts of the Dragons, and in each sketch, the entrepreneurs are in fact played by the actual Dragons presenting a modern item as an invention, with Jones presenting the toothbrush, Bannatyne and Caan presenting the toilet (or 'the Crapper'), and Meaden and Paphitis presenting the television.

''[[Dead Ringers (comedy)|Dead Ringers]]'' parodied the show with strange investments such as a tramp wanting investment in tea and a sketch where a man wants £100,000 and his pitch is a gun. They also parodied Dragon responses with Rachel Elnaugh seeing a product which turns base metal to gold and saying "How do you make any money out of this?".

The [[talkSPORT]] weekday afternoon show presented by [[Paul Hawksbee]] and [[Andy Jacobs]] has recently begun a weekly spoof slot wherein "Hilary Devey" (Jacobs) makes obvious comments to (absent) sporting personalities who have recently been in the news for making poor decisions. These comments usually deride said personality, ending with the Dragons' common final phrase, "I'm out!"

The British sitcom ''[[The IT Crowd]]'' features a brief parody of the show in episode 5 of series 2.

[[Ricky Gervais]] referenced the show and impersonated Evan Davis and Duncan Bannatyne in his live stand-up show ''Fame''. Gervais had also previously performed a sketch in the show ''[[Extras (TV series)|Extras]]'', which featured the current line-up of Dragons.

Disney Channel's ''[[I Didn't Do It (TV series)|I Didn't Do It]]'' based their [[I Didn't Do It (TV series)#Episode List|5th episode]] on the concept featuring a show called ''Boardroom Barracudas'' where the characters demo their vegetable flavor enhancer.

Peter Jones, Deborah Meaden, Nick Jenkins, Touker Suleyman and Sarah Willingham appeared as themselves in the first episode of the [[mockumentary]] series ''[[People Just Do Nothing]]'' when the protagonists visit the Deagons' Den to seek funding for their illegal [[pirate radio]] station. Jenkins offers them £50 to get out of the room.

In the summer of 2015, ''[[The Scott Mills Show]]'' on [[BBC Radio 1]] began a segment known as 'Instant Dragon's Den', where a caller is put through to the personal phone of [[Deborah Meaden]], one of the TV show's current Dragons, with the caller then pitching their idea to Meaden, who always starts by asking how the caller got her number.

==DVD release==
The first two series of the show are available to buy on DVD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B001DLUC5I|title=Dragons' Den Complete BBC Series 1 &amp; 2 [DVD]|work=amazon.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unknown whether the remaining series of the show will also be released.

The '''Egypt Defence Expo''', or '''EDEX''', is the first international defence exhibition in Egypt, covering air, land and sea weapons technologies. The business is set to conduct at the 2018 EDEX at the [[Egypt International Exhibition Center]] in the city of [[New Cairo]]. The exhibition will be held every two years, Egypt plans to make EDEX the number one event in the Middle East region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/285222/Egypt/Politics-/Egypts-military-to-hold-first-defense,-security-ex.aspx|title=Egypt's military to hold first defense, security exhibition in December 2018|author=|date=12 December 2017|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Announcement==

During a press conference in Cairo in December 2017, the Egyptian Armed Forces announced that Egypt will host a major international defence exhibition in 2018, under the name of Egypt Defence Expo (EDEX), bringing together key defence and security players from the region and across the world. The event will also offer the Egyptian companies a platform to showcase their military hardware and services to other world militaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.armyrecognition.com/edex_2018_news_show_daily/edex_new_defence_expo_exhibition_in_egypt_for_december_2018.html|title=EDEX New Defence EXpo Exhibition in Egypt for December 2018|author=|date=13 December 2017|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exhibition is being organised by [[Clarion Events]] Defence and Security, in cooperation with the Egyptian Armed Forces which will provide all the necessary facilities to ensure its success.

==Venue==

The event is set to take place at the new [[Egypt International Exhibition Center]] established in [[New Cairo]] by the Armed Forces in December 2017. It is considered the largest international exhibition center in Egypt covering an area of 311,000 square meters. The facilities are built on 23% of the overall area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.egypttoday.com/Article/1/35106/Armed-Forces-established-largest-int-l-exhibition-center-in-New|title=Armed Forces established largest int'l exhibition center in New Cairo|author=|date=2 December 2017|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==EDEX 2018==
Egypt Defence Expo 2018 will be held on 3–5 December 2018. Over 300 international defence and security manufacturers are expected to take part as exhibitors, and over 10,000 visitors are expected to attend the exhibition across three days. The exhibition will also feature a conference program and a fully hosted international military VIP Delegation Programme.

'''Electrosynthesis''' in [[chemistry]] is the [[organic synthesis|synthesis]] of [[chemical compound]]s in an [[electrochemical cell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sperry | first1 = Jeffrey B. | last2 = Wright | first2 = Dennis L. | year = 2006 | title = The application of cathodic reductions and anodic oxidations in the synthesis of complex molecules | url = | journal = Chem.

Electrochemistry, Vol. 3'' (Topics in Current Chemistry, Vol. 148) E. Steckhan (Ed), Springer, NY '''1988'''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yan, M., Kawamata, Y. and Baran, P. S. (2017), ''Synthetic Organic Electrochemistry: Calling All Engineers.'' Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.. {{doi|10.1002/anie.201707584}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main advantage of electrosynthesis over an ordinary [[redox reaction]] is selectivity and yield which result from control of the cell potential. Electrosynthesis is actively studied as a science and also has industrial applications. Electrooxidation has potential for wastewater treatment as well.

==Experimental setup==
The basic setup in electrosynthesis is a [[galvanic cell]], a [[potentiostat]] and two [[electrode]]s. Typical solvent and electrolyte combinations minimizes [[electrical resistance]].&lt;ref name= Grimshaw&gt;{{cite book|last=Grimshaw|first=James|title=Electrochemical Reactions and Mechanisms in Organic Chemistry|year=2000|publisher=Elsevier Science|location=Amsterdam|isbn=9780444720078|pages=1–7, 282, &amp; 310}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Protic]] conditions often use alcohol-water or [[dioxane]]-water solvent mixtures with an electrolyte such as a soluble salt, acid or base. Aprotic conditions often use an organic solvent such as [[acetonitrile]] or [[dichloromethane]] with electrolytes such as [[lithium perchlorate]] or tetrabutylammonium salts. The choice of electrodes with respect to their composition and surface area can be decisive. For example, in aqueous conditions the competing reactions in the cell are the formation of [[oxygen]] at the anode and [[hydrogen]] at the cathode. In this case a [[graphite]] anode and lead cathode could be used effectively because of their high overpotentials for oxygen and hydrogen formation respectively. Many other materials can be used as electrodes. Other examples include [[platinum]], [[magnesium]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]] (as a liquid pool in the reactor), [[stainless steel]] or [[reticulated vitreous carbon]]. Some reactions use a sacrificial electrode thatis consumed during the reaction like [[zinc]] or lead. Cell designs can be undivided cell or divided cell type. In divided cells the cathode and anode chambers are separated with a semiporous membrane. Common membrane materials include [[sintered]] glass, porous [[porcelain]], [[polytetrafluoroethene]] or [[polypropylene]]. The purpose of the divided cell is to permit the diffusion of ions while restricting the flow of the products and reactants. This separation simplifies workup. An example of a reaction requiring a divided cell is the reduction of [[nitrobenzene]] to [[phenylhydroxylamine]], where the latter chemical is susceptible to oxidation at the anode.

==Reactions==
[[Organic oxidation]]s take place at the anode. Compounds are reduced at the cathode. Radical intermediates are often invoked. The initial reaction takes place at the surface of the electrode and then the intermediates diffuse into the solution where they participate in secondary reactions.

The yield of an electrosynthesis is expressed both in terms the [[chemical yield]] and current efficiency. Current efficiency is the ratio of [[Coulomb]]s consumed in forming the products to the total number of Coulombs passed through the cell. Side reactions decrease the current efficiency.

The potential drop between the electrodes determines the rate constant of the reaction. Electrosynthesis is carried out with either constant potential or constant current. The reason one chooses one over the other is due to a trade off of ease of experimental conditions versus current efficiency. Constant potential uses current more efficiently because the current in the cell decreases with time due to the depletion of the substrate around the [[working electrode]] (stirring is usually necessary to decrease the [[diffusion layer]] around the electrode). This is not the case under constant current conditions however. Instead as the substrate's concentration decreases the potential across the cell increases in order to maintain the fixed reaction rate. This consumes current in side reactions produced outside the target voltage.

===Anodic oxidations===
*A well-known electrosynthesis is the [[Kolbe electrolysis]], in which two carboxylic acids decarboxylate, and the remaining structures bond together:
:[[Image:Electrólisis de Kolbe.png]]

*A variation is called the '''non-Kolbe reaction''' when a [[heteroatom]] (nitrogen or oxygen) is present at the α-position. The intermediate [[oxonium ion]] is trapped by a nucleophile usually solvent.
:[[Image:NonKolbe Reaction.png|500px|NonKolbe Reaction]]

*[[Amide]]s can be oxidized to ''N''-acyliminium ions, which can be captured by various [[nucleophile]]s, for example:
:[[Image:ShonoOxidation.png|500px|Shono oxidation]]

:This reaction type is called a '''Shono oxidation'''. An example is the α-methoxylation of ''N''-carbomethoxypyrrolidine&lt;ref&gt;''Organic Syntheses'', {{cite web |title=Coll.

===Electrofluorination===
{{main|Electrofluorination}}
In [[organofluorine chemistry]], many perfluorinated compounds are prepared by electrochemical synthesis, which is conducted in liquid HF at voltages near 5–6 V using Ni anodes. The method was invented in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Simons | first1 = J. H. | year = 1949 | title = Production of Fluorocarbons I. The Generalized Procedure and its Use with Nitrogen Compounds | url = | journal = Journal of the Electrochemical Society | volume = 95 | issue = | pages = 47–52 | doi = 10.1149/1.2776733 }} See also related articles by Simons et al. on pages 53, 55, 59, and 64 of the same issue.&lt;/ref&gt; Amines, alcohols, carboxylic acids, and sulfonic acids are converted to the perfluorinated derivatives using this technology. A solution or suspension of the hydrocarbon in [[hydrogen fluoride]] is electrolyzed at 5–6 V to produce high yields of the perfluorinated product.

Arvedlund''' is a financial journalist who has written for ''[[Barron's (newspaper)|Barron's]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', the ''[[Moscow Times]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[TheStreet.com]], and Portfolio.com. On Feb. 1, 2011, her "Your Money" column debuted in [[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]. 

On May 7, 2001, ''Barron's'' published her article "Don't Ask, Don't Tell: Bernie Madoff Attracts Skeptics in 2001".&lt;ref name="Arvedlund"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://online.barrons.com/article/SB989019667829349012.html |title=Don't Ask, Don't Tell: Bernie Madoff Attracts Skeptics in 2001 |last=Arvedlund |first=Erin E. |work=[[Barron's (newspaper)|Barron's]] |date=2001-05-07 |access-date=2018-08-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was only the second investigative article, following closely on Michael Ocrant’s May 1, 2001 article in industry publication ''[[MARHedge]]'', to question [[Bernard Madoff]]'s scheme, his demand for investor secrecy and his "enviably steady gains".

When the SEC finally investigated Madoff, after the December 2008 failure of his multi-billion dollar scheme, its Exhibit 104 belatedly mentions the Ocrant and Arvedlund articles:{{quote|"Madoff said that when the MarHedge and Barron's {{sic&lt;!--- for formatting ---&gt;}} articles came out, he expected the SEC to come to him, and that he was surprised the SEC didn't follow up with him.

[[Fundamental analysis]] software automates analysis that supports fundamental analysts in their review of a company's financial statements and valuation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fundamental Analysis: Introduction|url=http://www.investopedia.com/university/fundamentalanalysis/|publisher=Investopedia.com|accessdate=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==

The following are the most common features of fundamental analysis applications.

===Backtesting===

Enables traders to test fundamental analysis strategies or algorithms to see what kind of return they would have achieved if they had invested based on that strategy or algorithm in the past. Backtest results will typically display total and annualized returns compared to a benchmark such as the [[S&amp;P 500]]. In addition to returns, backtest results will also display [[Volatility (finance)|volatility]] statistics such as average beta or maximum drawdown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Backtesting: Interpreting The Past|url=http://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/05/030205.asp|publisher=Investopedia.com|accessdate=9 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scanner===

Stock scanning, or screening, is the most common feature of fundamental analysis software. Scanners enable users to 'scan' the market, be it stocks, options, currencies etc., to identify investment opportunities that meet a user's specific investment criteria. Using a fundamental analysis scanner, a user could, for example, scan the market to identify stocks with below industry average PE Ratios and above industry average sales growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stock Screener|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockscreener.asp|publisher=Investopedia.com|accessdate=9 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alerts===

Alerts are a common feature of fundamental analysis software. Alerts will typically notify the investor to buy or sell a stock, or notify an investor when a stock enters or exits his/her saved strategy. When alert conditions are met, a notification is typically communicated via an on screen pop up or sent as an email.

===Data Feed===

Fundamental analysis software is typically used with end of day (EOD), delayed or real time data feeds. EOD data feeds provide the end of day close, open, high, and low price for the given equity and is typically updated once a day at market close. Delayed data is typically delayed 15 to 30 minutes depending on the exchange and is the most commonly used data feed type. Real time data feeds provide tick by tick 'real time' data.

===Built in Strategies===

Most fundamental analysis software includes built in strategies that have been validated with [[backtesting]] to give positive returns on average. Some examples of built in strategies include: Stock Investor Pro's IBD Stable 70 or Equities Lab's Dividend Champions. Users will typically find a built in strategy that aligns with their interests and investment style then follow the strategy to keep up with stocks that pass the strategy.

===Broker Interface===

Some fundamental analysis software can be integrated with brokerage platforms to enable traders to place trades, or to update the users portfolio with what is actually held in the brokerage account.

Since January 2016 he is also Board member of the [[Venice Biennale|Biennale di Venezia]].

Previously, until June 2014, he was Director of External Relations of [[Enel]] Group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enel.com/en-GB/group/board/corporate_functions/ExtRel/ Gianluca Comin]. ENEL. Retrieved June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and Board's member of [[Endesa (Spain)|Endesa]] sa., a Spanish electricity Company that is part of the Enel Group.

Gianluca Comin started his professional career in 1986 as a journalist at the Rome office of the daily paper “[[Il Gazzettino]]”. Until 1997, he reported about politics from Rome and in 1998 he became Head of the Press Office of the Ministry of Public Works and spokesman for the Minister.

In 1999 Comin was appointed Director of External Relations and bureau chief at the Montedison S.p.A. Rome office, where he was in charge of communication for the IPO of Compart Montedison, of Compart Burgo, of Falck-Sondel at Compart-Montedison, of Fiat-Edf at Compart Montedison.

'''Horst Paulmann Kemna''' (born 22 March 1935) is a German-Chilean [[billionaire]] entrepreneur.  He is founder and chairman of [[Cencosud]], the largest retail chain in Chile and the third largest in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://losandes.com.ar/article/santiago-no-le-teme-a-las-alturas| title=Santiago is not afraid of heights| date=23 August 2015| publisher=Los Andes| access-date=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[Forbes]]'', his fortune is estimated at US$4.8 billion, and the second richest man in Chile.&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;

==Early life==
In 1946, Horst Paulmann and his family, consisting of his parents and seven siblings, emigrated from Germany after the end of World War II. They crossed the Alps towards Italy, continued on to Argentina in 1948, and finally to Chile in 1950.&lt;ref name=Dinero&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dinero.com/edicion-impresa/negocios/articulo/el-rey-del-comercio/162515| title=The king trade| date=25 October 2012| publisher=Dinero| access-date=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 13, Paulmann worked as a telephone operator in [[Buenos Aires]] and later worked making wooden toys. His family settled in the city of [[Temuco]] in the south of Chile, and his father got a position as a franchisee at Club Alemán and at Club de La Unión.&lt;ref name=Dinero/&gt; In 1952, Paulmann's family bought a local restaurant called Las Brisas and they soon transformed it into a supermarket. Since then and after the death of his father, Horst and his brother [[Jürgen Paulmann]] built a series of supermarket chains, beginning with the first hypermarket, located on Av. Kennedy. It measured 4,000 square meters and would become the foundation of the holding company [[Cencosud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/CMS-13198715| title=Horst Paulmann created Jumbo selling strawberries and walnuts| author=Sabine Drysdale| date=17 November 2013| publisher=El Tiempo| access-date=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[Cencosud]] was founded by Horst Paulmann on 10 November 1978 when he assumed the role of CEO and chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.forbes.com/companies/cencosud/| title=#1,040 Cencosud| publisher=Forbes| access-date=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cen&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cencosud.com/inversionistas/corporate-governance| title=Gobierno Corporativo| publisher=Cencosud| access-date=29 December 2015| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222093841/http://www.cencosud.com/inversionistas/corporate-governance/| archivedate=22 December 2015| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cencosud employs more than 150,000 people in Chile, Argentina, Colombia, Brazil and Peru, where it operates its supermarket chains (such as [[Jumbo (hypermarkets)|Jumbo]], [[Santa Isabel (supermarkets)|Santa Isabel]], [[Disco]], [[Vea]], Gbarbosa, Prezunic, Bretas, [[Perini (supermarket)|Perini]], [[Wong (supermarket)|Wong]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|Tiendas Metro|es|3=Tiendas Metro|lt=Metro}}); department stores (such as [[París]] and Johnson's); home improvement stores (such as [[Easy (store)|Easy]] and Blaisten); commercial centers and credit stores (with over 4.3 million credit cards issued).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.americaeconomia.com/negocios-industrias/paulmann-versus-paulmann| title=Paulmann versus Paulmann| date=16 August 2010| publisher=America Economia| access-date=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.economiaynegocios.cl/noticias/noticias.asp?id=89119| title=Horst Paulmann: "In Germany we reviewed jars trash Americans to eat..."| date=2 October 2011| author=Miranda Camila Krauss| publisher=Economia Y Negocios| access-date=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dinero/&gt;&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;

'''Hybrid transaction/analytical processing (HTAP),''' a term created by [[Gartner]] Inc. – an information technology research and advisory company. As defined by Gartner: &lt;blockquote&gt;Hybrid transaction/analytical processing (HTAP) is an emerging application architecture that "breaks the wall" between transaction processing and analytics. It enables more informed and "in business real time" decision making.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/3599217/market-guide-htapenabling-inmemory-computing|title=Market Guide for HTAP-Enabling In-Memory Computing Technologies|website=www.gartner.com|access-date=2017-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/2657815/hybrid-transactionanalytical-processing-foster-opportunities|title=Hybrid Transaction/Analytical Processing Will Foster Opportunities for Dramatic Business Innovation|website=www.gartner.com|access-date=2017-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Background==
In the 1960s, computer use in the [[business sector]] began with payroll transactions and later included tasks in areas such as accounting and billing. At that time, users entered data, and the system [[batch processing|processed it at a later time]]. Further development of instantaneous data processing, or [[online transaction processing]] (OLTP), led to widespread OLTP use in government and business-sector information systems.&lt;ref name=Bog&gt;
Bog, Anja. [https://books.google.com/books?id=fV0NAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA7&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;dq=hybrid+transactional/analytical+processing&amp;sou#v=onepage&amp;q=hybrid%20transactional%2Fanalytical%20processing&amp;f=false ''Benchmarking Transaction and Analytical Processing Systems: The Creation of a Mixed Workload Benchmark and Its Application''] Springer-Verlage Berlin Heidelberg. 2014
&lt;/ref&gt;

OLAP covers the analytical processing involved in creating, synthesizing, and managing data. With greater data demands among businesses,{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} OLAP also has evolved. To meet the needs of applications, both technologies are dependent on their own systems and distinct architectures.&lt;ref name="Pezzini"&gt;Pezzini, Massimo; Feinberg, Donald; Rayner, Nigel; Edjlali, Roxane. [https://www.gartner.com/doc/2657815/hybrid-transactionanalytical-processing-foster-opportunities "Hybrid Transaction/Analytical Processing Will Foster Opportunities for Dramatic Business Innovation."] Gartner. 28 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bog /&gt; As a result of the complexity in the information architecture and infrastructure of both OLTP and OLAP systems, data analysis is delayed.&lt;ref name=Pezzini /&gt;{{qn|date=November 2016}}

==HTAP advantages and challenges==
There are various interpretations of HTAP other than Gartner's original definition; an "emerging architecture". These interpretations suggest different advantages, one being a database functionality. Recent advances in research, hardware, OLTP and OLAP capabilities, in-memory technologies, scalable transactional management and products enable transactional processing and analytics, or HTAP, to operate on the same database.&lt;ref name=Pezzini /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wolpe"&gt;Wolpe, Toby. [http://www.zdnet.com/sql-and-nosql-fine-but-how-does-the-hybrid-database-fit-in-7000029277 "SQL and NoSQL? Fine, but how does the hybrid database fit in?"] ZDNet. 12 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bog /&gt;

However, Gartner's most recent reports suggest broader advantages than a single unified database can offer. Traditional application architectures separated transactional and analytical systems. Digital business, and the need to respond to business moments, means that using "after the fact" analysis is no longer adequate. Business moments are transient opportunities that must be exploited in real time. If an organization is unable to recognize and/or respond quickly to a business moment by taking fast and well-informed decisions, then some other organization will, resulting in a missed opportunity (or a new business threat). HTAP allows advanced analytics to be run in real time on "in flight" transaction data, providing an architecture that empowers users to respond more effectively to business moments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/3352419/enable-digital-business-innovation-hybrid|title=How to Enable Digital Business Innovation via Hybrid Transaction/Analytical Processing|website=www.gartner.com|access-date=2017-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main technical challenges for an HTAP database are how to be efficient both for operational (many small transactions with a high fraction of updates) and analytical workloads (large and complex queries traversing large number of rows) on the same database system and how to prevent the interference of the analytical queries over the operational workload.

HTAP solves the issue of analytic latency in several ways, including eliminating the need for multiple copies of the same data and the requirement for data to be offloaded from [[operational database]]s to [[data warehouse]]s via [[Extract, transform, load|ETL]] processes.&lt;ref name="Pezzini" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wolpe" /&gt;

Most HTAP applications has been enabled by in-memory technologies that can process a high volume of transactions and offer features such as forecasting and simulations. New HTAP technologies bring scalable transactional processing and do not need to rely on keeping the whole database in-memory. HTAP has the potential to change the way organizations do business by offering immediate business decision-making capabilities based on live and sophisticated analytics of large volumes of data. Government and business leaders can be informed of real-time issues, outcomes, and trends that necessitate action, such as in the areas of public safety, risk management, and fraud detection.

The '''Industrial Development &amp; Renovation Organization of Iran''' ('''IDRO''') known as '''IDRO Group''' was established in 1967 in [[Iran]].&lt;ref name="IDRO"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.idro.org/enidro/About%20Idro/History.aspx | title= About IDRO: History | publisher= Industrial Development and Renovation Organization of Iran | accessdate= 2012-01-01 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120419071230/http://www.idro.org/enidro/About%20Idro/History.aspx | archivedate= 2012-04-19 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; IDRO Group is one of the largest companies in [[Iran]]. It is also one of the largest conglomerates in [[Asia]]. IDRO's objective is to develop [[Industry of Iran|Iran's industry sector]] and to accelerate the industrialization process of the country and to export Iranian products worldwide.&lt;ref name="IDRO"/&gt; Today, IDRO owns 117 subsidiaries and affiliated companies both domestically as well as internationally.&lt;ref name="IDRO2"/&gt;

== Businesses ==
{{see also|Industry of Iran}}

In the course of its 40 years of activity, IDRO has gradually become a major shareholder of some key industries in Iran. In recent years and in accordance with the country's [[Privatization in Iran|privatization]] policy, IDRO has made great efforts to privatize its affiliated companies. While carrying on its privatization policies and lessening its role as a holding company, IDRO intends to concentrate on its prime missions and to turn into an industrial development agency.
IDRO has focused its activities on the following areas in order to materialize such strategy and to expedite the [[industrial development]] of Iran:

*Promotion of local and [[Foreign Direct Investment in Iran|foreign investments]] with minority holdings owned by IDRO (less than 50% of the shares) with particular emphasis on new, hi-tech and export-oriented industries.
*Restructuring the existing industries through participation of reputable foreign companies in order to transfer new technologies and to enhance the [[Iran and International Trade|non-oil exports of Iran]].
*Development of general contracting activities with the participation of the Iranian private sector and credible foreign companies.
*Rendering consultancy and support services to [[Foreign Direct Investment in Iran|foreign investors]].
*[[Privatization in Iran|Privatization of the existing subsidiaries]].
*[[Industry of Iran|Industrial Investment]]
*Management Development
*[[Automotive industry in Iran|Automotive Industry]]
*Industrial Equipment Machinery
*[[Industry of Iran#Naval industry|Marine Industry]]
*[[Iranian railway industry|Railway Industry]]
*[[Industry of Iran#Electronics and computer industry|Hi-Tech Industries Development]]
*[[Construction in Iran|General Contracting]]
*[[Healthcare in Iran|Health care]]
*[[Banking in Iran|Banking]]

==Privatization==
{{See also|Privatization in Iran}}

IDRO had privatized 140 of its companies worth about 2,000 billion rials ($200 million) in the past. The organization will offer shares of 150 industrial units to private investors by March 2010. In 2009, 290 companies were under the control of the IDRO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presstv.com/detail.aspx?id=99914&amp;sectionid=351020102 |title=No Operation |publisher=Presstv.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402082947/http://www.presstv.com/detail.aspx?id=99914&amp;sectionid=351020102 |archivedate=2012-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''KANTAR IMRB''' (formerly '''IMRB International''') is a [[market research]], [[Statistical survey|survey]] and [[Management consulting|business consultancy]] firm. Headquartered in [[Mumbai]], India with operations in over 15 countries IMRB is a part of the [[Kantar Group]], [[WPP Group|WPP]]’s research, insights, and consultancy network.&lt;ref name=IB /&gt;

Established in 1970, KANTAR IMRB was modeled on the lines of the British Market Research Bureau. IMRB provides market research and insights across [[South Asia]], the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]] with specialist divisions in [[quantitative marketing research|quantitative]], [[qualitative marketing research|qualitative]], [[audience measurement|media]], retail, industrial, [[customer satisfaction]], business to business and social and rural research. KANTAR IMRB’s syndicated research offerings include the [[MarketPulse]], the [[National Food Survey(India)|National Food Survey]], [[WAM (India)|Web Audience Measurement]] (WAM), ITops, and I-Cube reports.

With over 1200 employees, KANTAR IMRB is one of the largest providers of market research in India in an industry estimated to be worth a minimum of $ 187 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.in/catalyst/2003/07/24/stories/2003072400030100.htm |title=The Hindu Business Line : MR looks for a makeover |publisher=Thehindubusinessline.in |date=2003-07-24 |accessdate=2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the oldest extant market research company in India, KANTAR IMRB has been responsible for establishing the first and only [[MarketPulse|household panel]], the first television [[audience measurement]] system and the first radio panel in the country and has played a key role in the development of market research in India. It has been rated the 'Best Market Research Company' by industry body Market Research Society of India (MRSI) for several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketresearchworld.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2267&amp;Itemid=76 |title=IMRB International Wins The Market Research Agency Of The Year Award For The Third Consecutive Time |publisher=Marketresearchworld.net |date=2008-10-08 |accessdate=2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

KANTAR IMRB's specialised areas are consumer markets, industrial marketing, business to [[business marketing]], [[social marketing]], and rural marketing.&lt;ref name=IB&gt;http://www.imrbint.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
IMRB was established in 1970 to provide market research services to the clients of [[J. Walter Thompson|Hindustan Thompson Associates]]. Early clients included [[fast-moving consumer goods]] companies such as [[Unilever]], [[ITC Limited|ITC]], [[Pond's Creams|Pond’s]], and [[Horlicks]]. The initial decade saw rapid expansion into new areas of business, with the first [[qualitative research|qualitative]] study being conducted by the end of the decade, and IMRB pioneering [[psephology]] in India through an ongoing series of opinion poll surveys for ''[[India Today]]'', that successfully predicted [[Indian National Congress|Congress]]’ victory in the 1980 general election.

Subsequent decades saw the development of new verticals, with the creation of specialized units and the offering of several syndicated research products. IMRB also played an important role in the standardization of market research practice in India, and was responsible for the creation in 1983 of the [[SEC Classification (India)|Socio-Economic Classification system]], a method now used across India to define [[target audience]]s. In 1987, as a founder member of the MRSI, it helped evolve industry wide codes of conduct, and standards for survey data collection that are still in use today.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mrsi.in&lt;/ref&gt;

With the global acquisition of J. Walter Thompson by Sir [[Martin Sorrell]] in 1987, IMRB became a constituent of [[WPP Group|WPP]] and continued its pace of growth, growing over 25% per annum through the 1990s under the leadership of Ramesh Thadani. The 1990s saw the creation of specialized units focusing on development research, employee satisfaction, [[loyalty marketing|loyalty programs]], technology and media and the acquisition of several new multinational clients. IMRB's insights also played a role in the development of several new products for major Indian brands such as [[Marico]], Bingo Chips, [[Godrej Group|Godrej]] and [[Dabur]] and by this time supported 40 out of top 50 brands in India.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:IMRB logo.jpg|thumb|right|400px|alt= IMRB's logo and tagline as displayed outside its Mumbai head office|IMRB's logo and tagline as displayed outside its head office in Mumbai.]] --&gt;

In 2002, as part of a process of rebranding, it changed its name from the Indian Market Research Bureau to IMRB International, adopted a new logo, and began a process of rapidly expanding its international services. This was accompanied by a shift from its offices at [[Watson's Hotel|Esplanade Mansion]] to its current premises in [[Dadar]], [[Mumbai]]. As part of geographical expansion, IMRB helped set up [[Lanka Market Research Bureau|LMRB]] in [[Colombo]], [[Sri Lanka]] in 1981 and [[AMRB]] in 1999 with headquarters in [[Dubai]] and offices throughout the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]].

In 1996, along with the Manufacturers’ Association for Information Technology (MAIT) IMRB initiated the periodic ITOPS survey which monitors the IT hardware market among households and businesses. Since 1998, in collaboration with the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI), an industry body IMRB also started providing a series of annual syndicated research reports named I-Cube which surveys the online and mobile landscape in India.  More recently, in 2010 IMRB launched the [[WAM (India)|Web Audience Measurement]] (WAM) system, India’s first standardized internet audience measurement system based on a panel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.in/2010/11/02/stories/2010110251500900.htm |title=The Hindu Business Line : IMRB launches Web audience measurement |publisher=Thehindubusinessline.in |date=2010-11-02 |accessdate=2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Company structure==
IMRB is headquartered in Mumbai, India. Its parent company is Hindustan Thompson Associates, which in turn is owned by Martin Sorrell's WPP Group plc. Within WPP, IMRB is aligned with the [[Kantar Group]], an umbrella network of global market research companies that together account for over $2 billion in revenues and form the world’s second biggest market research conglomerate.

[[File:IMRB in WPP.png|thumb|center|500px|alt=A IMRB's ownership structure.|A diagrammatic chart representing IMRB's ownership structure.]]

In India, IMRB International operates out of its five full service offices in  [[Ahmedabad]], Mumbai, [[Delhi]], [[Kolkata]], [[Chennai]] and [[Bangalore]] and is supported by 15 other regional centers for collection of survey information. Overseas, IMRB functions through its associates [[AMRB-MENA]] in the Middle East and North Africa, with offices in [[Algiers]], Dubai, [[Jeddah]], [[Casablanca]] and [[Cairo]]; and LMRB, with offices in Colombo and Sirius, headquartered in [[Dhaka]].&lt;ref name=IB /&gt;

IMRB is currently headed by Preeti Reddy. As the oldest market research company in India, it has served as the training ground of many industry leaders including Dorab Sopariwala, Ranjit Chib and Meena Kaushik, who went on to found their own companies.

==Business divisions and services==
IMRB is organized into several independent business divisions that focus on specific areas of market research. It currently has eight business units in addition to its oldest division, the quantitative research division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imrbint.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=6&amp;Itemid=4 |title=Divisions |publisher=Imrbint.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Contract law}}
An '''illegal agreement''', under the [[common law]] of [[contract]], is one that the [[court]]s will not enforce because the purpose of the agreement is to achieve an illegal end. The illegal end must result from performance of the contract itself. The classic example of such an agreement is a [[contract killing|contract for murder]].

However, a contract that requires only legal performance on the part of each party, such as the sale of packs of [[Playing card|cards]] to a known gambler, where [[gambling]] is illegal, will nonetheless be enforceable. A contract directly linked to the [[gambling]] act itself, such as paying off gambling debts (see [[proximate cause]]), however, will not meet the legal standards of enforceability.  Therefore, an employment contract between a [[blackjack]] [[Croupier|dealer]] and a [[speakeasy]] manager, is an example of an illegal agreement and the employee has no valid claim to his anticipated wages if gambling is illegal under that [[jurisdiction]].

In ''[[Bovard v. American Horse Enterprises]]'' (1988),&lt;ref&gt;''Bovard v. American Horse Enterprises'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/CA3/201CA3d832.htm 201 Cal. App. 3d 832, 247 Cal. Rptr. 340] (1988).&lt;/ref&gt; the [[California Courts of Appeal|California Court of Appeal for the Third District]] refused to enforce a contract for payment of [[promissory note]]s used for the purchase of a company that manufactured drug paraphernalia. Although the items sold were not actually illegal, the court refused to enforce the contract for [[public policy]] concerns.

In [[Canada]], one cited case of lack of enforceability based on illegality is ''Royal Bank of Canada v. Newell, 147 D.L.R (4th) 268 (N.S.C.A.),'' in which a woman forged her husband's signature on 40 [[cheque]]s, totalling over $58,000. To protect her from prosecution, her husband signed a letter of intent prepared by the bank in which he agreed to assume "all liability and responsibility" for the forged cheques. However, the agreement was [[unenforceable]], and was struck down by the courts, because of its essential goal, which was to "stifle a criminal prosecution." Because of the contract's illegality, and as a result voided status, the bank was forced to return the payments made by the husband.

Contracts in [[restraint of trade]] are a variety of illegal contracts and generally will not be enforced unless they are reasonable in the interests of the contracting parties and the 
public.

Contracts in restraint of trade if proved to be reasonable can be enforced.  When restraint is placed on an ex-employee, the court will consider the geographical limits, what the employee knows and the extent of the duration.  Restraint imposed on a vendor of business must be reasonable and is binding if there is a genuine seal of goodwill.  Under common law, contracts to [[Price fixing|fix prices]] are legal. ''Sole supplier'' ("solus") agreements are legal if reasonable. Contracts which contravene public policy are void.

'''James Buchanan Duke''' (December 23, 1856 &amp;ndash; October 10, 1925) was an American [[tobacco]] and [[electric power]] industrialist best known for the introduction of modern [[cigarette]] manufacture and marketing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-20042217|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=13 Nov 2012|accessdate=13 Nov 2012|title=James Buchanan Duke: Father of the Modern Cigarette|last=Kremer|first=William}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his involvement with [[Duke University]].

==Early life==
James Buchanan Duke, known by the nickname "Buck", was born on December 23, 1856, near [[Durham, North Carolina]], to industrialist and philanthropist [[Washington Duke]] (1820–1905) and his second wife, Artelia Roney Duke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dukeendowment.org/about/history| title=The Duke Family and its Legacy| publisher=Duke Endowment| accessdate=2008-06-02| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517103643/http://www.dukeendowment.org/about/history| archivedate=2008-05-17| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business career==
Duke's father, Washington, had owned a tobacco company that his sons James and [[Benjamin Newton Duke|Benjamin]] (1855–1929) took over in the 1880s. In 1885, James Buchanan Duke acquired a license to use the first automated [[cigarette]] making machine (invented by [[James Albert Bonsack]]), and by 1890, Duke supplied 40% of the American cigarette market (then known as pre-rolled tobacco). In that year, Duke consolidated control of his four major competitors under one corporate entity, the [[American Tobacco Company]], which was a monopoly as he controlled over 90% in the American cigarette market. His [[Robber baron (industrialist)|robber baron]] business tactics directly led to the [[Black Patch Tobacco Wars]] in 1906-1908.

At the start of the 1900s, Duke tried to conquer the British market as he had done the American, eventually forcing the then divided British manufacturers to merge into the Imperial Tobacco Company of Great Britain and Ireland, Ltd ([[Imperial Tobacco]]). After two years of intense competition in Great Britain, Imperial Tobacco took the fight to the U.S.&amp;nbsp;market, forcing American Tobacco to look for a settlement. This resulted in an agreement whereby American Tobacco controlled the [[American trade]], Imperial Tobacco controlled the trade in the British territories, and a third, cooperative venture named the [[British American Tobacco|British-American Tobacco Company]] was set up between the two to control the sale of tobacco in the rest of the world. During this time, Duke was repeatedly sued by business partners and shareholders. In 1906, the American Tobacco Company was found guilty of antitrust violations, and was ordered to be split into four separate companies: American Tobacco Company, [[Liggett Group|Liggett and Myers]], R.J. Reynolds, and the [[P.&amp;nbsp;Lorillard Company]].

In 1892, the Dukes opened their first textile firm in [[Durham, North Carolina]], that was run by his brother Benjamin. At the turn of the century, Buck organized the American Development Company to acquire land and water rights on the [[Catawba River]]. In 1904, he established the [[Catawba Power Company]] and the following year he and his brother founded the [[Southern Power Company]], which became known as [[Duke Power]], the precursor to the [[Duke Energy]] conglomerate. The company supplied [[electric power|electrical power]] to the Duke's [[textile]] factory and within two decades, their power facilities had been greatly expanded and they were supplying electricity to more than 300 [[cotton mills]] and other industrial companies. Duke Power established an electrical grid that supplied cities and towns in the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont Region]] of [[North Carolina|North]] and [[South Carolina]]. [[Lake James]], a power-generating reservoir in Western North Carolina, was created by the company in 1928 and named in Duke's honor. [[Buck Steam Station]] in [[Rowan County, North Carolina]], built in 1926, was also named for Duke. 

In 1911, the [[U.S.&amp;nbsp;Supreme Court]] upheld an order breaking up the American Tobacco Company's monopoly. The company was then divided into several smaller enterprises, of which only the British-American Tobacco Company remained in Duke's control. After his death in 1925, there was a great deal of controversy, and some historians suspect that some resentful Imperial Tobacco executives were feeling some anger at Duke for having lost the Tobacco War between Duke's company and Imperial Tobacco.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==Personal life==
Duke was married twice, first in 1904 to Lillian Fletcher McCredy (also known as Lillian Nanette Duke). They divorced in 1906 and had no children. In 1907 he married the widow Nanaline Holt Inman, with whom he had his only child, a daughter, [[Doris Duke|Doris]], born November 22, 1912. Doris was raised at [[Duke Farms]] located in [[Hillsborough, New Jersey]], where her father had worked with landscapers such as [[James Leal Greenleaf]] (a member of the firm of [[Frederick Law Olmsted]]), and Horatio Buckenham to transform more than {{convert|2000|acre|km2|0}} of farmland and woodlots into an extraordinary landscape containing 2 conservatories, 9 lakes, 35 fountains, 45 buildings, countless pieces of sculpture, over {{convert|2|mi|km|0}} of stone walls and more than {{convert|18|mi|km}} of roadway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dukefarms.org/page.asp?pageId=4|title=History | publisher=Duke Farms|accessdate=2008-02-11 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080111134008/http://www.dukefarms.org/page.asp?pageId=4 |archivedate = 2008-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duke died in New York City on October 10, 1925, and is interred with his father and brother in the Memorial Chapel on the campus of [[Duke University]].  He resided at his home, [[James Buchanan Duke House| Lynnewood]] in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] during the last five years of his life.&lt;ref name = nrhpinv&gt;{{Cite web | author = Davyd Foard Hood and Joe Mobley | title =James Buchanan Duke House| work = National Register of Historic Places - Nomination and Inventory | date =n.d. | url = http://www.hpo.ncdcr.gov/nr/MK0022.pdf | format = pdf | publisher = North Carolina State Historic Preservation Office | accessdate = 2015-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1978.&lt;ref name="nris"&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philanthropy and will===
[[Image:2008-07-24 Statue of James Buchanan Duke.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of James B. Duke in front of the West Campus Quad.]]

In December 1924, Duke established [[The Duke Endowment]], $40 million trust fund ({{Inflation|US|40000000|1924|fmt=eq}}), some of which was to go to Trinity College.  The University was renamed [[Duke University]] in honor of his father. The James B. Duke Library, the main campus library at [[Furman University]], is also named for him because of his philanthropic relationship with the university.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/almanac/hall_of_fame/james_b._duke James Duke], Philanthropy Hall of Fame &lt;/ref&gt;

On his death, he left approximately half of his huge estate to The Duke Endowment, which gave another $67 million ({{Inflation|US|67000000|1925|fmt=eq}}) to the trust fund.  In the indenture of trust, Duke specified that he wanted the endowment to support Duke University, [[Davidson College]], [[Furman University]], [[Johnson C. Smith University]]; not-for-profit hospitals and children's homes in the two Carolinas; and rural [[United Methodist]] churches in North Carolina, retired pastors, and their surviving families.

The remainder of Duke's estate, estimated at approximately $100 million ({{Inflation|US|100000000|1925|fmt=eq}}), went to his twelve-year-old daughter, [[Doris Duke|Doris]],{{citation needed|reason=The NYT ref at end of sentence isn't a source for this estate-distribution info.|date=October 2014}} making her "the richest girl in the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; Doris sued her mother for control of the Duke Farms estate and won.

== History ==
''Boys' and Girls' Bureau of the Eastern States League'' was founded in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], in 1919 to help educate young people moving from rural America to the country's booming cities about the means of production and free enterprise. The following year, the organization's name was changed to the Junior Achievement Bureau. The name was modified in 1926 to Junior Achievement, Inc.&lt;ref name=IU&gt;{{cite web|title=Junior Achievement Records, 1916-2002, Ruth Lilly Special Collections &amp; Archives|url=http://www.ulib.iupui.edu/special/collections/philanthropy/mss048|publisher=Indiana University|accessdate=30 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following World War II, the organization grew from a regional into a national organization.&lt;ref name=francomano&gt;{{cite book|last=Francomano|first=Joe|title=Junior Achievement: A History|year=1988|publisher=Junior Achievement Inc.|location=Colorado Springs, CO|pages=|url=https://www.jaworldwide.org/aboutja/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, JA began its growth into an international organization.&lt;ref name=francomano/&gt;

For more than 50 years, the organization was known mostly for the JA Company Program, an after-school program through which students form companies, sell stocks, produce and market a product, and sell it in their communities and globally. The student companies are mentored by volunteer advisers from the business and tech communities. In 1975, Junior Achievement introduced its first in-school program, Project Business, featuring volunteers from the local business community teaching middle school students about business and personal finance.&lt;ref name=francomano/&gt;

Today, JA Worldwide is one of the world's largest organization youth-serving organizations, dedicated to giving young people the knowledge and skills they need for employment and entrepreneurship. JA programs are delivered by corporate and community volunteers and provide relevant, hands-on experiences that give students knowledge and skills in financial literacy, work readiness, and entrepreneurship. JA annually reaches more than 10 million students in more than 100 countries around the world. Programs are delivered by more than 450,000 JA volunteers.&lt;ref name="JA Worldwide18"&gt;{{cite web|title=JA Worldwide Locations|url=https://www.jaworldwide.org/locations/

==Reception==
Riley Sky of ''Dropkick Divas Media'' gave the series 3 out of 5 stars, saying "Khloé &amp; Lamar is probably one of my favorite reality series. The show features each person's own personal struggles along with their families and their relationships. A show that finally features Khloe and her darling husband Lamar".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sky|first=Riley|title=Khloé &amp; Lamar Review|url=http://dropkickdivasmedia.blogspot.com/2014/05/khloe-lamar.html|publisher=Dropkick Divas Media|accessdate=18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The law for [[workplace bullying]] is given below for each country in detail. Further European countries with concrete antibullying legislation are Belgium, France, and The Netherlands.&lt;ref name="antimoblegis"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scholarworks.bgsu.edu/econ_pub/5/ |last = Browne

== Australia ==
Each state has its own legislation.

In [[Queensland]], legislation comes from Workplace Health and Safety Queensland. If bullying (referred to as 'Workplace Harassment' in the Queensland subordinate legislation) endangers a worker's health causing stress or any other physical harm, an obligation holders under the 'Workplace Health and Safety Act, 1995' can be found liable for not providing a safe place for their employees to work. Queensland is one of only two States in Australia with a Code of Practice specifically for workplace bullying – 'The Prevention of Workplace Harassment Code of Practice, 2004'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deir.qld.gov.au/workplace/law/codes/harassment/index.htm |title=Codes of practice – Workplace Health and Safety Queensland |publisher=Deir.qld.gov.au |accessdate=2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], legislation comes from Worksafe Victoria. If bullying endangers a worker's health causing stress or any other physical harm, a corporation can be found liable for not providing a safe place for their employees to work.&lt;ref name="worksafe"&gt;[http://www.worksafe.vic.gov.au/wps/wcm/connect/WorkSafe/Home/ Worksafe, Victorian Workcover Authority] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030143610/http://www.worksafe.vic.gov.au/wps/wcm/connect/WorkSafe/Home/ |date=October 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Canada ==

=== Quebec ===
The Canadian Province of [[Quebec]] passed legislation addressing workplace bullying on 1 June 2004. In its act representing labour standards, "psychological harassment" is prohibited. The Commission des normes du travail is the organization responsible for the application of this act.&lt;ref name="travail"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cnt.gouv.qc.ca/en/in-case-of/psychological-harassment-at-work/index.html |title=Psychological harassment at work – Commission des normes du travail du Québec |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |work=cnt.gouv.qc.ca |year=2010 |accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ontario ===
Under the [[Ontario]] Occupational Health and Safety Act 1979, all employers "take every precaution reasonable in the circumstances for the protection of a worker". This includes protecting them against the risk of workplace violence.&lt;ref name="oohsa"&gt;[http://www.labour.gov.on.ca/english/hs/ohsaguide/index.html Ontario Occupational Health and Safety Act 1979] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090925073905/http://www.labour.gov.on.ca/english/hs/ohsaguide/index.html |date=2009-09-25 }} Ministry of Labour, Ontario, Canada&lt;/ref&gt; The Act requires establishment of Joint Occupational Health and Safety Committees for larger employers.

Under the act, workplace violence is defined as ''"...the attempted or actual exercise of any intentional physical force that causes or may cause physical injury to a worker. It also includes any threats which give a worker reasonable grounds to believe he or she is at risk of physical injury"''.&lt;ref name="oohsa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VW"&gt;[http://www.labour.gov.on.ca/english/hs/workplace_violence.html Workplace Violence] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091012194651/http://www.labour.gov.on.ca/english/hs/workplace_violence.html |date=2009-10-12 }} Ministry of Labour, Ontario, Canada&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, as the Act is written, the Ontario Occupational Health and Safety Act does not specifically cover the issue of psychological harassment.&lt;ref name="oohsa" /&gt;

On 13 December 2007, MPP Andrea Horwath introduced for first reading a new Bill, Bill-29, to make an amendment to the Ontario Occupational Health and Safety Act. This Bill-29 is proposing "to protect workers from harassment and violence in the workplace" and will include protection from psychological abuse and bullying behaviors in the workplace in Ontario.&lt;ref name="tp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ontla.on.ca/web/bills/bills_detail.do?locale=en&amp;BillID=1938 |title=Legislative Assembly of Ontario, Canada |publisher=Ontla.on.ca |accessdate=2012-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ontario OHS Act has been amended to include Bill 168, which came into force 15 June 2010. The amendment includes the protection of employees from psychological harassment, workplace violence, including domestic violence in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ontla.on.ca/web/bills/bills_detail.do?locale=en&amp;Intranet=&amp;BillID=2181 |title=Legislative Assembly of Ontario, Canada |publisher=Ontla.on.ca |accessdate=2012-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Saskatchewan ===

The Canadian Province of [[Saskatchewan]] made workplace bullying illegal in 2007 by passing The Occupational Health and Safety (Harassment Prevention) Amendment Act, 2007. The act broadened the definition of harassment, as defined in The Occupational Health and Safety Act 1993, to include psychological harassment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qp.gov.sk.ca/documents/english/FirstRead/2006-07/Bill-66.pdf The Occupational Health and Safety] (Harassment Prevention) Amendment Act, 2007 in Saskatchewan&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Manitoba ===
Manitoba enacted Bill 18 making bullying illegal and legitimized school  "bullying clubs", Including [[gay-straight alliance]]s, and other school anti-bullying clubs.

== Ireland ==
In Republic of Ireland, there is a Code of Practice for employers and employees on the prevention and resolution of bullying at work.&lt;ref name="copf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publications.hsa.ie/index.asp?docID=222 |title=Republic of Ireland – 2007 Code of Practice for Employers and Employees on the Prevention and Resolution of Bullying at Work |publisher=Publications.hsa.ie |date=31 July 2009 |accessdate=2012-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Code notes the provision in the Safety, Health and Welfare Act 2005 requiring employers to manage work activities to prevent improper conduct or behaviour at work. The Code of Practice provides both employer and employee with the means and the machinery to identify and to stamp out bullying in the workplace in a way which benefits all sides.

== Spain ==
In Spain, within the public administration, activities including preventing access to opportunities, physical or social isolation, withholding necessary information, keeping the target out of the loop, ignoring or excluding, if permanent and for a long time, are considered labor harassment and have to be prosecuted.&lt;ref&gt;Article [http://www.elpais.com/articulo/sociedad/Mantener/funcionario/desocupado/sera/acoso/laboral/elpepisoc/20110604elpepisoc_8/Tes Mantener a un funcionario desocupado será acoso laboral] in Spanish newspaper [[El País]] on 4. June 2011. Retrieved 4. June 2011, in Spanish Language&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sweden ==
Workplace bullying in [[Sweden]] is covered by the ''Ordinance of the Swedish National Board of Occupational Safety and Health containing Provisions on measures against Victimization at Work'', which defines victimisation as ''"...recurrent reprehensible or distinctly negative actions which are directed against individual employees in an offensive manner and can result in those employees being placed outside the workplace community".''&lt;ref name="vicwork"&gt;Ordinance of the Swedish National Board of Occupational Safety and Health containing Provisions on measures against Victimization at Work AFS 1993:17 [http://www.av.se/dokument/inenglish/legislations/eng9317.pdf Official English translation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030023948/http://www.av.se/dokument/inenglish/legislations/eng9317.pdf |date=2013-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The act places the onus on employers to plan and organise work so as to prevent victimisation and to make it clear to employees that victimisation is not acceptable. The employer is also responsible for the early detection of signs of victimisation, prompt counter measures to deal with victimisation and making support available to employees who have been targeted.

== United Kingdom ==
{{See also|Harassment in the United Kingdom|UK employment discrimination law}}
In the United Kingdom, although bullying is not specifically mentioned in workplace legislation, there are means to obtain legal redress for bullying. The [[Protection from Harassment Act 1997]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://194.128.65.3/acts/acts1997/97040--a.htm#1 Protection from Harassment Act 1997]&lt;/ref&gt; is a recent addition to the more traditional approaches using employment-only legislation. Notable cases include [[Majrowski v Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Trust]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldjudgmt/jd060712/majro-1.htm#1|title=House of Lords - Majrowski (Respondent) v. Guy's and St. Thomas' NHS Trust (Appellants)|last=Department|first=Law Lords|date=|website=www.publications.parliament.uk|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; wherein it was held that an employer is vicariously liable for one employee's harassment of another, and Green v DB Group Services (UK) Ltd,&lt;ref&gt;[2006] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2006/1898.html EWHC 1898]&lt;/ref&gt; where a bullied worker was awarded over £800,000 in damages. In the latter case, at paragraph 99, the judge Mr Justice Owen said "I am satisfied that the behaviour amounted to a deliberate and concerted campaign of bullying within the ordinary meaning of that term."

Bullying behaviour breaches other UK laws. An implied term of every [[employment contract]] in the UK is that parties to the contract have a (legal) duty of trust and confidence to each other. Bullying, or an employer tolerating bullying, typically breaches that contractual term. Such a breach creates circumstances entitling an employee to terminate his or her contract of employment without notice, which can lead to a finding by an [[Employment Tribunal]] of [[unfair dismissal]], colloquially called [[constructive dismissal]]. An employee bullied in response to asserting a statutory right can be compensated for the detriment under Part V of the [[Employment Rights Act 1996]], and if dismissed, Part X of the same Act provides that the dismissal is automatically unfair. Where a person is bullied on grounds of sex, race or disability ''et al.'', it is outlawed under anti-discrimination laws.

It was argued, following the obiter comments of [[Lord Hoffmann]] in [[Johnson v Unisys Ltd]] in March 2001,&lt;ref name="jvu1"&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200001/ldjudgmt/jd010322/johnso-1.htm Judgments – Johnson (A.P.) v. Unisys Limited], Uk Parliament – Publications&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jvu2"&gt;[http://www.eoc-law.org.uk/default.aspx?page=3170 Johnson v Unisys Ltd [2001&amp;#93; IRLR 279 House of Lords], Case Summaries, Equal Opportunities Commission, UK&lt;/ref&gt; that claims could be made before an Employment Tribunal for injury to feelings arising from unfair dismissal. It was re-established that this was not what the law provided, in Dunnachie v Kingston upon Hull City Council, July 2004&lt;ref name="jvu3"&gt;{{cite web|author=Law Lords Department |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldjudgmt/jd040715/dunn-1.htm |title=Dunnachie v Kingston upon Hull City Council 2004 |publisher=Publications.parliament.uk |accessdate=2012-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; wherein the Lords confirmed that the position established in ''[[Norton Tool v Tewson]]'' in 1972, that compensation for unfair dismissal was limited to financial loss alone. The compensatory award element for "ordinary" unfair dismissal is subject to a statutory cap set, from February 2014, at the lower of £76574 or 12 months gross pay. Discriminatory dismissal continues to attract compensation for injury to feelings and financial loss, and there is no statutory cap.

Access to justice in the UK is via self-representation at a tribunal, via a no-win no-fee lawyer, or via insurance or trade union lawyers. Since the Access to Justice act, "collective conditional fees" have blurred the distinction causing controversy for example in the case of Unison v Jervis.

}}
These workplace bullying bills would typically have allowed employees to sue their employers for creating an "abusive work environment", and most have been supported by the notion that laws against workplace bullying are necessary to protect public health. Many of the above bills are based upon the proposed Healthy Workplace Bill.&lt;ref name="HWPB" /&gt; This proposed bill contains several restrictive provisions not found in workplace anti-bully legislation adopted in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.droitcivil.uottawa.ca/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_download&amp;gid=2516 |title=The law of workplace bullying: an international overview |first=Katherine |last=Lippel |journal=Comp Labor Law Policy J |volume=32 |number=1 |date=Fall 2010 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the lack of any federal or state law specifically on workplace bullying, some targets of bullying have prevailed in lawsuits that allege alternative theories, such as Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress and Assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abusergoestowork.com |title=Potential Statutory and Common Law Remedies for Workplace Bullying |publisher=When the Abuser Goes to Work |accessdate=12 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although most US states operate primarily under the doctrine of [[at-will]] employment (which, in theory, allows an employer to fire an employee for any reason or no reason at all), American workers have gained significant legal leverage through discrimination and harassment laws, workplace safety laws, union-protection laws. etc., such that it is illegal under federal and most states' laws to fire employees for many reasons. For example, these employment laws typically forbid retaliation for good faith complaints or the exercise of legal rights such as the right to organize a union. Discrimination and harassment laws enable employees to sue for creating a "[[hostile work environment]]", which can include bullying, but the bullying/hostility usually is tied in some way to a characteristic protected under the discrimination/harassment law, such as race, sex, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation, etc.

== South Korea ==
People can take legal action if specific action of workplace bullying is violated existing law or if it is recognized that laborer who is bullied in workplace suffer industrial accident, but generally it is hard to confirm whether it is illegal or not. Fundamentally, industrial accident can be approved when the accident have task correlation. However, it is hard to say that bullying is related with work. Besides bullying could be occurred in diverse places such as cafeteria, commuting bus, get -together so the task correlation is not likely to be approved. There is, however, a case about recognition of industrial accident related with workplace bullying. The court said that if laborer received treatment due to workplace bullying, it is an industrial accident and the person can take legal action.

'''Mainhattan''' is the [[central business district]] of [[Frankfurt]] in [[Germany]]. The word is a [[portmanteau]] of [[Main (river)|Main]], the river on which Frankfurt lies, and [[Manhattan]], a reference to the inner city area's visually impressive [[Tower block|high rises]] and [[skyscraper]]s. Together with [[St. Paul's Church, Frankfurt am Main|St. Paul's Church]], these buildings form the skyline of the city. The first tall buildings were built in the 1960s. Banks and other financial institutions settled there, which resulted in the district also being referred to as "Bankfurt" (''Bankford''). Originally, both expressions were sometimes used derisively, but the [[connotation]] has changed to a purely positive one.&lt;ref&gt;[[Der Spiegel]]: [http://www.spiegel.de/reise/staedte/mainhattan-frankfurt-feiert-seine-wolkenkratzer-a-481941.html  Mainhattan: Frankfurt feiert seine Wolkenkratzer].

'''Michael L. "Mike" Fry''' (October 25, 1960 – November 4, 2012) was an American serial [[entrepreneur]], entertainer, trainer and marketing expert. He was the original [[Happy the Hobo]] on the [[children's television series]] ''[[Happy's Place]]'', and the creative mind behind and owner of [[Fancy Fortune Cookies]].

==Entertainer==
Mike Fry was born in [[Kankakee, Illinois|Kankakee]], [[Illinois]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bussellandbell.com/sitemaker/memsol.cgi?user_id=797273]{{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but grew up in the [[Huntington, Indiana|Huntington]], [[Indiana]] area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wane.com/dpp/entertainment/childrens-tv-icon-passes-away|title=Children's TV icon, Happy the Hobo, passes away|publisher=|date=2012-11-05|accessdate=2012-11-24|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108021647/http://www.wane.com/dpp/entertainment/childrens-tv-icon-passes-away|archivedate=2012-11-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was the state [[Tae Kwon Do]] champion in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;''Huntington Herald Press'' "Five Are Awarded Tae Kwon Do Honors". October 1979&lt;/ref&gt; He began [[juggling]] at the age of fourteen, after finding out that his grandfather used to juggle dirt clods on the farm in rural Illinois. By the age of 17 he was juggling for audiences in the local area.&lt;ref&gt;''Indianapolis News'' "Triple Time" August 7, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

Fry was accepted to the [[Ringling Brothers and Barnum &amp; Bailey Clown College]], in [[Venice, Florida|Venice]], [[Florida]] at the age of 19, graduating in 1981. He toured with the circus for the 1981 and 1982 season. He had the honor of being trained by three of the world's four [[circus clown|Master Clowns]]: [[Lou Jacobs]], [[Frosty Little]], and Bobby Kay.&lt;ref&gt;''Indianapolis News'': "Hoosier Creates A New Idea In Fortune Cookies!" 1993&lt;/ref&gt; He trained in heavy object balancing, which included six-foot tables, small canoes, a twenty-five foot ladder, a running chainsaw, other people, sofas, and a television set. In 1981, he became a [[Guinness Book of World Records]] record holder as part of a group that [[juggle]]d the most objects at one time.

He left Ringling Brothers in 1982 and made the transition to television, where he wrote and co-produced ''Happy's Place'', one of America's highest-rated children's television shows, from 1982 to 1990. ''Happy's Place'' aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate [[WFFT-TV]] in 207 cities for eight years. At the height of the show's popularity there was a two-year wait for tickets to the show.  He hosted a variety of guests from [[The Harlem Globetrotters]] to [[Jerry Mathers]] and [[Tiny Tim (musician)|Tiny Tim]].&lt;ref&gt;''Huntington Herald Press'' "Seeking Cookie Fortune". December 15, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving ''Happy's Place'', Fry trained at [[The Second City]] [[sketch comedy]] group in [[Chicago]]. While in Chicago he also auditioned to play the role of [[Bozo the Clown]], and did some writing for the show as a result.  He was also an instructor at the Illinois Juggling Institute for one year while he lived in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;''Fort Wayne News Sentinel'' "Clown moves to happier place". October 17, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inventor==
During his role as Happy the Hobo, Fry became interested in inventing. In 1988 he started marketing his first viable invention, America's first gourmet flavored [[fortune cookies]]. Since 1988 the company has greatly expanded on his original concept of gourmet fortune cookies, specializing in flavored, chocolate-dipped, giant, and decorated fortune cookies.&lt;ref&gt;Excelerations: Indiana's Growth 100. November 5, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''school leaving age''' is the minimum age a person is legally allowed to cease attendance at an institute of [[compulsory education|compulsory]] [[secondary education]]. Most countries have their school leaving age set the same as their minimum full-time employment age, thus allowing smooth transition from education into employment, whilst a few have it set just below the age at which a person is allowed to be employed.

In contrast, there are numerous countries that have several years between their school leaving age and their legal minimum employment age, thus in some cases preventing any such transition for several years. Countries which have their employment age set below the school leaving age of 5 years old but  (mostly developing countries), risk giving children the opportunity to leave their education early to earn money for their families.

==Leaving age by country==
Some countries have different leaving or employment ages, but in certain countries like China and Japan, the average age at which people graduate is 15, depending upon part-time or full-time learning or employment. The table below states the school leaving ages in countries across the world and their respective minimum employment age, showing a comparison of how many countries have synchronised these ages. All information is taken from the Right to Education Project's table unless otherwise indicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.right-to-education.org/node/279 |title=Country Table - At What Age?...are school-children employed, married and taken to court|publisher=The Right to Education Project|accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, all children between those ages, even if they're refugees or new, have to attend school.
Not attending school with-out proper reason for example; sickness or a doctors visit, is illegal and is seen as wagging which is seen as fraud and punishable by law. Until the age of 12 children cannot be punished by law, but as soon as your child or you turn 12 years of age or older, you can be held responsible for wagging.
Punishments can be done as a fine, temporary jail time or a community service job done under supervision. Fines can be up to € 3 900 00.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="78607">Over the past two decades, '''state-building''' has developed into becoming an integral part and even a specific approach to [[peacebuilding]] by the international community. Observers across the political and academic spectra have come to see the state-building approach as the preferred strategy to peacebuilding in a number of high-profile conflicts, including the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict|Israeli-Palestinian]], Bosnia, Iraq, and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]]. According to the political scientist [[Anders Persson]], internationally led state-building is based on three dimensions: a security dimension, a political dimension and an economic dimension. Of these three, security is almost always considered the first priority.&lt;ref&gt;Persson, Anders (2012). [http://cesran.org/building-a-state-or-maintaining-the-occupation-international-support-for-fayyads-state-building-project.html "Building a state or maintaining the occupation? International support for Fayyad’s state-building project"], ''Journal of Conflict Transformation and Security'', Vol. 2, No. 1, pp: 101–119.&lt;/ref&gt;

The general argument in the academic literature on state-building is that without security, other tasks of state-building are not possible.
Consequently, when state-building as an approach to peacebuilding is employed in conflict and post-conflict societies, the first priority is to create a safe environment in order to make wider political and economic development possible. So far, the results of using the state-building approach to peacebuilding have been mixed, and in many places, such as in the Balkans, Afghanistan and Iraq, the initial high expectations set by the international community have not been met. The literature on state-building has always been very clear in that building states has historically been a violent process and the outcomes in the above-mentioned cases and many others confirm the destabilizing and often violent nature of state-building.

==Definition==
There are two main theoretical approaches to definitions of state-building.

First, state-building is seen by some theorists as an activity undertaken by external actors (foreign countries) attempting to build, or re-build, the institutions of a weaker, post-conflict or [[Failed state|failing state]]. This 'exogenous' or International Relations school views state-building as the activity of one country in relation to another, usually following some form of intervention (such as a UN peacekeeping operation).

The second, developmental, theory followed a set of principles developed by the [[OECD]] in 2007 on support to conflict-affected states which identified 'statebuilding' as an area for development assistance.  The result saw work commissioned by donor countries on definitions, knowledge and practice in state-building, this work has tended to draw heavily on political science.  It has produced definitions that view state-building as an indigenous, national process driven by state-society relations.  This view believes that countries cannot do state-building outside their own borders, they can only influence, support or hinder such processes. Illustrations of this approach include a think-piece commissioned for OECD{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} and a research study produced by the [[Overseas Development Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;Verena Fritz and Alina Rocha Menocal, '' [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=1340&amp;title=understanding-state-building-political-economy-perspective-analytical-conceptual-paper-processes-embedded-tensions-lessons-international-engagement|Understanding State-Building from a Political Economy Perspective: An Analytical and Conceptual Paper on Processes, Embedded Tensions and Lessons for International Engagement]'', 2007; [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The developmental view was expressed in a number of papers commissioned by development agencies.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} These papers tend to argue that state-building is primarily a 'political' process rather than just a question of technical capacity enhancements and sees state-building as involving a threefold dynamic of: political (usually elite) deals, the prioritization of core government functions and the willingness to respond to public expectations.&lt;ref&gt;http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090118231836/http://www.dfid.gov.uk/pubs/files/State-in-Development-Wkg-Paper.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  A further important influence on thinking on states affected by conflict was the [[World Bank]]'s 2011 World Development Report, which avoided the language of state-building while addressing some related themes.

Across the two streams of theory and writing there is a broader consensus that lessons on how to support state-building processes have not yet been fully learned.  Some believe that supporting state-building requires the fostering of legitimate and sustainable state institutions, but many accept that strategies to achieve this have not yet been fully developed. Little of the post-conflict support to state-building undertaken so far has been entirely successful. From an exogenous perspective, it can be argued that sustained focus on supporting state-building has tended to happen in states frequently characterized by brutalized civilian populations, destroyed economies, institutions, infrastructure, and environments, widely accessible small arms, large numbers of disgruntled soldiers to be demobilized and reintegrated, and ethnically or religiously divided peoples. These obstacles are compounded by the fundamental difficulty of grafting democratic and human rights values onto countries with different political, cultural, and religious heritages. Pluralizing societies is theoretical in its viability for immediate political and economic stability and expediency; ideological overtones can be met with opposition within host nations and issues of self-determination and external state trusteeship and stewarding of nascent institutional reform, or its creation, could damage a tenuous post-conflict national self-identity (for critical analyses of neotrusteeship, see e.g. Ford &amp; Oppenheim, 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Neotrusteeship or Mistrusteeship? The "Authority Creep" Dilemma in United Nations Transitional Administration {{!}} Journal of Transnational Law {{!}} Vanderbilt University|url = https://wp0.its.vanderbilt.edu/jotl/2012/07/neotrusteeship-or-mistrusteeship-the-authority-creep-dilemma-in-united-nations-transitional-administration/|website = wp0.its.vanderbilt.edu|access-date = 2016-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Both schools of thinking have generated critiques and studies seeking to test the propositions made.  A more developmental approach with an emphasis on composite state-building processes would have implications for donor programmes, diplomacy and [[Peacekeeping|peace-keeping]].  Some research has tried to test some of the ideas involved&lt;ref&gt;(OECD, Do No Harm in State-building 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; and at least one donor agency issued a guidance note for its own programmes.&lt;ref&gt;(DFID, Building Peaceful States and Societies 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;  Important critiques were developed by NGOs such as [[Conciliation Resources]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.c-r.org/resources/occasional-papers/documents/CR_2Renegotiating_Settlement_20Mar09-2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Asia Foundation]],&lt;ref&gt;http://asiafoundation.org/resources/pdfs/PoliticalSettlementsFINAL.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; focused primarily on Whaites proposition that a 'political settlement' drives state-building.  There have also been attempts to test out the thesis by looking at individual areas of state provision, particularly the area of healthcare.  Further research on state–society relations has also been undertaken by groups including the Secure Livelihoods Research Consortium and the Crisis States Research Centre.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.healthandfragilestates.org/index2.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_view&amp;gid=32&amp;Itemid=38&lt;/ref&gt;

While some development papers have tried to argue that state-building takes place in all countries and that much can be learnt from successful state-building there is a tendency to narrow the discussion to the most problematic contexts.  As a result, much of the literature on state-building is preoccupied with post conflict issues. See e.g. (Dahrendorf, 2003), (The Commission on Post-Conflict Reconstruction, 2003), (Collier, 2003) (Fukuyama, 2004), (Paris, 2004), (Samuels 2005). Critiques common to both schools include inadequate strategy and a lack of coordination, staffing weaknesses, and that funding is insufficient or poorly timed. Moreover, it is increasingly recognized that many of the tasks sought to be achieved are extremely complex and there is little clarity on how to best proceed. For instance, it is extremely difficult to provide security in a conflictual environment, or to disarm, demobilize and reintegrate armies successfully. It remains practically impossible to address vast unemployment in states where the economy is destroyed and there is high illiteracy, or to strengthen the rule of law in a society where it has collapsed. Moreover, the unintended negative consequences of international aid are more and more evident. These range from distortion of the economy to skewing relationship of accountability by the political elite towards internationals rather than domestic population.

The [[United Nations Research Institute for Social Development]] (UNRISD) determined that basic state capacities are to

i. Assist in the acquisition of new technologies

ii. Mobilize and channel resources to productive sectors

iii. Enforce standards and regulations

iv. Establish social pacts

v. Fund deliver and regulate services and social programmes&lt;ref name="Poverty Reduction pp. 3"&gt;UNRISD 2010. "Building State Capacity for Poverty Reduction." Chapter 10, pp. 3–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

States must be able to create the
# Political Capacity to address the extent to which the necessary coalitions or political settlements can be built
# Resource Mobilization Capacity to generate resources for investment and social development
# Allocate Resources To Productive And Welfare-Enhancing Sectors&lt;ref name="Poverty Reduction pp. 3" /&gt;

When developing this infrastructure a state can meet several roadblocks including policy capture from powerful segments of the population, opposition from interest groups, and ethnic and religious division.
Developing countries have tried to implement different forms of government established in advanced democracies. However, these initiatives have not been fully successful. Scholars have looked back at the development of Europe to determine the key factors that helped create bureaucracies that were sustainable throughout the centuries.

== Application of state-building theories ==

=== The predatory theory ===

==== War making ====
When studying the development of European states, Charles Tilly identified that European countries engaged in four activities:&lt;ref name="Peter B. Evans 1985"&gt;Peter B. Evans, D. R.; Skocpol, T., War Making and State Making as Organized Crime Bringing the State Back In. Cambridge University Press: 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

# war making – eliminating or neutralizing their own rivals
# state making – eliminating or neutralizing their rivals inside their own territory
# protection – eliminating or neutralizing the enemies of their clients
# extraction – acquiring the means of carrying out the first three activities.

For Tilly, these activities are interdependent and rely in the state’s ability to monopolize violence. Before the consolidation of European states, kings relied on their lords’ troops to emerge victorious from war, setting the final boundaries of their territories after years of campaigns. Still, these lords and their private armies could become potential threats to the king’s power during peacetime. Originally, structures were created to facilitate extraction from the king’s subordinates in exchange for protection (from their enemies and from the state), covering the expenses of war campaigns. However, extraction also economically strengthened the states, allowing them to expand their hold over the use violence.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Out of these four activities, war making was the main stimulus to increasing the level of taxation, thus increasing the capacity of the state to extract resources otherwise known as [[fiscal capacity]].&lt;ref name="Peter B. Evans 1985" /&gt; The increased capacity of the state to extract taxes from its citizens while facing external threats prompted [[Jeffrey Herbst]] to propose allowing failed states to dissolve or engage in war to re-create the process endured by European countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Herbst | first1 = J | year = 1996 | title = Responding to State Failure in Africa | url = | journal = International Security | volume = 21 | issue = 3| pages = 120–144 | doi=10.1162/isec.21.3.120}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of extraction in exchange for protection was further argued by economic historian Frederic Lane. Lane argued that "governments are in the business of selling protection... whether people want it or not".&lt;ref name="jesusradicals.com"&gt;Tilly, Charles: War Making and State Making as Organized Crime. 1985. http://www.jesusradicals.com/uploads/2/6/3/8/26388433/warmaking.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Lane argued that a monopoly was best equipped to produce and control violence. This, he argued, was due to the fact that competition within a monopoly raised costs, and that producing violence renders larger economies of scale.&lt;ref name="jesusradicals.com" /&gt; Although the logic was consistent with the predatory theory of the state in early modern Europe,&lt;ref name="Thies, C. G. 2000"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thies | first1 = C. G. | year = 2004 | title = State building, interstate and intrastate rivalry: A study of post-colonial developing country extractive efforts, 1975–2000 | url = | journal = International Studies Quarterly | volume = 48 | issue = 1| pages = 53–72 | doi=10.1111/j.0020-8833.2004.00291.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herbst’s point of view was criticized by several scholars including Richard Joseph who were concerned that the application of predatory theory was an excessive approach of Darwinism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Joseph | first1 = R. | last2 = Herbst | first2 = J. | year = 1997 | title = Responding to State Failure in Africa | url = | journal = International Security | volume = 22 | issue = 2| pages = 175–184 | doi=10.1162/isec.22.2.175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many have disregarded the limited view of this theory and have instead extended it to include strong external threats of any kind. External threats to the state produce stronger institutional capacities to extract resources from the state.&lt;ref name="Thies, C. G. 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thies | first1 = C. G. | year = 2005 | title = War, rivalry, and state building in Latin America | url = | journal = American Journal of Political Science | volume = 49 | issue = 3| pages = 451–465 | doi=10.2307/3647725}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In harnessing this increased capacity, Cameron Thies describes the state as a machine that requires a "driver" that is able to use the increased capacity to expand influence and power of government. The driver can be state personnel, a dominant class, or a charismatic individual. Without these drivers, the political and military machine of the state has no direction to follow and therefore, without this direction, war and the increased resources extracted from war can not be used for growth.&lt;ref name="Thies, C. G. 2005"/&gt; On the other hand, internal wars, i.e. civil wars, have a negative effect on extraction of a state. Internal rivals to the state decrease the state's capacity to unify and extract from its citizens. Rivals usually will bargain with the state to lower their tax burden, gain economic or political privileges.&lt;ref name="Thies, C. G. 2005"/&gt;

==== Limited access orders ====
In their paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=North|first=Douglass|last2=Wallis|first2=John|last3=Weingast|first3=Barry|date=December 2006|title=A Conceptual Framework for Interpreting Recorded Human History|url=https://www.nber.org/papers/w12795|journal=National Bureau of Economic Research|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Douglass North, John Wallis, and Barry Weingast offer an alternative framework - limited access orders - for understanding the predatory role of the state. In limited access orders, entry is restricted in both economic and political systems to produce rents which benefit the ruling elites. In open access orders, entry is open to all. The logic of the open access state is based in impersonality. Both systems are interdependent and are only stable when both have similar access frameworks, either limited or open. Transitioning from a limited access order to an open access order involves difficult, radical changes based on three "doorstep conditions": 1) rule of law for elites, 2) perpetual life for organizations, and 3) political control of the military. Once all three initial conditions are satisfied, more incremental changes can be made to move the state further in the direction of an open access order.

=== Social changes and social order ===
In his study on countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America, Joel Migdal presented the necessary and sufficient conditions for establishing a strong state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/876100982|title=Strong societies and weak states : state-society relations and state capabilities in the third world|last=Migdal|first=Joel S.|date=1988|publisher=Princeton University press|year=|isbn=9780691010731|location=|pages=269–275|oclc=876100982}}&lt;/ref&gt; He considered "massive societal dislocation" that weakens old social control and institutions as the necessary condition. Such cases include the [[Black Death]] and the [[Hundred Years' War]] in Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/876100982|title=Strong societes and weak states : state-society relations and state capabilities in the third world|last=Migdal|first=Joel S.|date=1988|publisher=Princeton University press|year=|isbn=9780691010731|location=|pages=91–92|oclc=876100982}}&lt;/ref&gt; the expansion of world economy into Asia, Africa and Latin America in the 19th century, the combination of war and revolution in [[China]], [[Korea]] and [[Vietnam]] and mass migration in [[Taiwan]] and [[Israel]] in the 20th century. Furthermore, he listed the sufficient conditions as follows:
* World historical timing when exogenous political forces were in favor of concentrated social control;
* Existence of military threat from outside or other groups in the country;
* A group of skillful and independent people to build an independent bureaucracy;
* Skillful top leadership that would take advantage of the above conditions.

== Differentiating "nation-building", military intervention, regime change ==

Some commentators have used the term "nation-building" interchangeably with "state-building" (e.g. Rand report on America's role in nation-building). However, in both major schools of theory the state is the focus of thinking rather than the "nation" (''nation'' conventionally refers to the population itself, as united by identity history, culture and language). The issues debated related to the structures of the state (and its relationship to society) and as result state-building is the more broadly accepted term.  In political science '[[nation-building]]' usually has a quite distinct meaning, defined as the process of encouraging a sense of national identity within a given group of people, a definition that relates more to socialisation than state capacity (see the ODI, OECD, and DFID reports cited above).

Similarly, state-building (nation-building) has at times been conflated with military intervention or regime change. This derives in part from the military actions in Germany and Japan in World War II and resulting states, and became especially prevalent following the military interventions in Afghanistan (October 2001) and Iraq (March 2003). However, the conflation of these two concepts has been highly controversial, and has been used by opposing ideological and political forces to attempt to justify, or reject as an illegal military occupation, the actions in Iraq and Afghanistan. Hence, regime change by outside intervention should be differentiated from state-building.

There have been some examples of military interventions by international or multilateral actors with a focus on building state capacity, with some of the more recent examples including Bosnia, East Timor, and Sierra Leone. Such interventions are alternatively described as "neotrusteeship" or "neoimperialism". Under this framework, strong states take over part of all of the governance of territories with underdeveloped existing governing structures, often with the backing of international legal authority. Unlike the classic imperialism of the 19th and early 20th centuries, this type of intervention is aimed at (re)building local state structures and turning over governance to them as quickly as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fearon|first=James|last2=Laitin|first2=David|date=Spring 2004|title=Neotrusteeship and the Problem of Weak States|url=https://web.stanford.edu/group/fearon-research/cgi-bin/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Neotrusteeship-and-the-Problem-of-Weak-States.pdf|journal=International Security|volume=28|issue=4|pages=5–43|doi=10.1162/0162288041588296}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such efforts vary in the scope of their objectives, however, with some believing that sweeping change can be accomplished through the sufficient and intelligent application of personnel, money, and time,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Beginner's Guide to Nation-Building|last=Dobbins|first=James|last2=et. al.|publisher=RAND Corporation|year=2007|isbn=978-0833039880|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others believe that any such plans will founder on the inherent unpredictability of interventions and that lengthy, sustained interventions often prevent local leaders from taking responsibility and strengthen insurgent forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Can Intervention Work?|last=Stewart|first=Rory|last2=Knaus|first2=Gerald|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|year=2012|isbn=978-0393342246|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neo-trusteeship, shared sovereignty, and other new models of intervention rest on the assumptions that intervention is the most effective strategy for state-building and that countries cannot recover from the failures of government without external interference. However, Jeremy M. Weinstein proposes autonomous recovery exists as a process that offers "lasting peace, a systematic reduction in violence, and post-war political and economic development in the absence of international intervention."&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;''Autonomous Recovery and International Intervention in Comparative Perspective''. Jeremy M. Weinstein. Working Paper Number 57. April 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The argument suggests that external interference detracts from the state-building by-products produced from war or military victories, given that military intervention makes rebel victories less likely and that peace-building discourages violence. External support undermines the creation of a self-sustaining relationship between rulers or political leaders and its constituents. Foreign aid promotes governments that maintain the same leaders in power and discourages developing a revenue extraction plan that would bind local politicians and local populations. War or military victories create conditions for self-sustaining and representative institutional arrangements through the domestic legitimacy and capacity of state revenue extraction that are by-products of war.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Versus peace-building==
State-building does not automatically guarantee peace-building, a term denoting actions that identify and support structures that strengthen and solidify peace in order to prevent a relapse into conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Boutros-Ghali, Boutros (1992) "An Agenda for Peace: Preventive Diplomacy, peacemaking and peacekeeping", paragraph 21&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst they have traditionally been considered two individual concepts with a complex relationship giving rise to dilemmas and necessitating trade-offs, as Grävingholt, Gänzle and Ziaja argue, the two actually representative two diverging perspectives on the same issue: a shaky social peace and a breakdown of political order.&lt;ref&gt;Grävingholt J, Gänzle S &amp; ZiajaS (2009), Policy Brief:

Concepts of Peacebuilding and State Building – How Compatible Are They?, ''German Institute for Development,'' p.2, Available at https://www.die-gdi.de/uploads/media/Peacebuilding_and_Statebuilding__Draft_11-03-09__01.pdf (Retrieved 23 January 2016). 
&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] emphasises that peace-building and state-building are not the same, it does recognise the nexus between them and the reinforcement of one component has on the other: 'peace-building is primarily associated with post-conflict environments, and state-building is likely to be a central element of it in order to institutionalise peace'.&lt;ref&gt;OECD (2008), Concepts and Dilemmas of State Building

in Fragile Situations: from Fragility to Resilience, ''Journal on Development'', Vol 9, Issue 3, Available at&lt;nowiki/&gt;http://www.oecd.org/dac/governance-peace/conflictandfragility/docs/41100930.pdf (Retrieved 23 January 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; Paris' model including the peace-building and state-building is one of the better known ones. He advocates an Internationalisation Before Liberalisation (IBL) approach, arguing that peace-building must be geared towards building liberal and effective states, thus 'avoiding the pathologies of liberalization, while placing war-shattered states on a long-term path to democracy and market-oriented economics'.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heathershaw | first1 = J | last2 = Lambach | first2 = D | year = 2008 | title = Introduction: Post-Conflict Spaces and Approaches to Statebuilding | url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/17502970802436296?instName=King%2527s+College+London| journal = Journal of Intervention and Statebuilding | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 269–289 | doi = 10.1080/17502970802436296 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the advantages of incorporating peace-building and state-building in the same model, applicational limitations should be recognised. In practice, foreign and security policy making still largely treat them as separate issues. Moreover, academics often approach the subjects from different angles. Heathershaw and Lambach caution that in practice, interventions that attempt the ambitious goals that Paris (amongst others) sets out may be coercive and driven by a 'the end justifies the means' outlook.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This concern is acute in [[United Nations]] peacekeeping missions for there have been instances where peace-builders aspire not only to go a step further and eradicate the causes of violence, which are oftentimes not agree upon by the parties to the conflict, but also to invest 'post-conflict societies with various qualities, including democracy in order to reduce the tendency toward arbitrary power and give voice to all segments of society; the rule of law in order to reduce human rights violations; a market economy free from corruption in order to discourage individuals from believing that the surest path to fortune is by capturing the state; conflict management tools; and a culture of tolerance and respect'.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett M &amp; Zuercher C (n.D), The Peacebuilder's Contract:

How External State-building Reinforces Weak Statehood, ''Research Partnership on Postwar State-Building'', p.2, Available at http://www.sfb-governance.de/teilprojekte/projekte_phase_1/projektbereich_c/c1/barnettzuercherstatebuilding.pdf (Retrieved 23 January 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Such ambitious goals are questionable when the [[United Nations]] has been seen to struggle in high-profile conflict-ridden situations such as [[Darfur]] and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. Where it has accomplished a degree of stability such as in Haiti and Liberia, it endures pressure 'to transition from heavy and costly security-oriented peacekeeping operations to lighter, peace-building-oriented missions'. Introducing state-building to mandates is controversial not only because this would entail extra costs and commitments but also because 'the expansion of peacekeeping into these areas has de facto extended the authority of the Security Council, with political, financial, institutional, and bureaucratic implications that have yet to be fully addressed'.&lt;ref&gt;Sherman J &amp; Tortolani B (2009), Implications of Peacebuilding and Statebuilding in United Nations Mandates, ''International Forum Challengers of Peace Operations'', p.2, Available at&lt;nowiki/&gt;http://www.operationspaix.net/DATA/DOCUMENT/4997~v~Implications_of_Peacebuilding_and_Statebuilding_in_United_Nations_Mandates.pdf (Retrieved 23 January 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the inherently political nature of state building, interventions to build the state can hinder peace, increasing group tensions and sparking off further conflict.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Menocal, Alina Rocha (2009) 'State-building for peace’: navigating an arena of contradictions [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/download/3673.pdf] London: Overseas Development Institute&lt;/ref&gt; The strength of the consensus that has emerged stressing that 'a minimally functioning state is essential to maintain peace',&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ignores the complications that poor legitimacy and inclusion can lead to in the future, undermining the whole process.{{According to whom|date=April 2016}} For instance, while the [[Guatemala|Guatemala Peace Accords]] were considered successful, 'the formal substance of these agreements has not altered power structures that have been in place for decades (if not centuries) in any substantial manner. The underlying (informal) understanding among elites – that their privileges and hold on power are not to be touched – appears to remain. Therefore, while the Accords may be deemed successful because they prevented the outbreak of war, this 'success' was tainted by the implications made by a subsequent report published by the Commission of Historical Clarification in February 1999. In it 'particular institutions were singled out as responsible for extensive human rights abuses. State institutions were attributed responsibility for 93% of these, and the guerrilla forces 3%. In unexpectedly strong language, the report described Guatemalan governmental policy at the height of the war as a policy of genocide'.&lt;ref&gt;Salvesen H (2002), Guatemala: Five Years after the Peace Accords: The Challenges of Implementing Peace, ''International Peace Research Institute, Oslo (PRIO)'' for the Norwegian Ministry for Foreign Affairs, p. 13, Available at  http://mercury.ethz.ch/serviceengine/Files/ISN/37978/ipublicationdocument_singledocument/c1f807e7-a86a-4a6d-a248-10c6c1315551/en/2002_03_Guatemala+Five+Years+After+the+Peace.pdf. (Retrieved 23 January 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; The reinforcement of these state institutions as part of the peace-building process taints it by association.

Efforts to "appease" or 'buy off' certain interest groups in the interest of peace may undermine state-building exercises, as may power-sharing exercises that could favor the establishment of a political settlement over effective state institutions. Such political settlements could also enshrine power and authority with certain factions within the military, allowing them to carve up state resources to the detriment of state-building exercises.&lt;ref name="Call, Charles T 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Call | first1 = Charles T | year = 2008 | title = The Fallacy of the 'Failed State' | url = | journal = Third World Quarterly | volume = 29 | issue = 8| page = 1499 | doi=10.1080/01436590802544207}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in weak states where the government has not sufficient power to control peripheries of the territory, alliances with the elites could strengthen the state's governing power.  Yet, these alliances are successful if the agreement is mutually beneficial for the parties e.g. elites's power is threatened by competition and the entitlement of the government would help them to diminish it. In return, the government would acquire information and control over the peripheries' policies. Afghanistan since 2001, is an example of a beneficial pact between government and elites; entitling some select set of warlords as governors yielded a strongman brand of governance in two key provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Warlords, strongman governors, and the state in Afghanistan|last=Mukhopadhyay|first=Dipali|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes peace-building efforts bypass the state in an effort bring peace and development more quickly, for example, it was found that many NGOs in the Democratic Republic of Congo were building schools without involving the state. The state also may be part of the problem and over-reliance on the state by international actors can worsen security inside the country.

Conversely, state corruption can mean that state building efforts serve only one ethnic, religious or other minority group, exacerbating tensions that could escalate towards violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Call | first1 = Charles T | year = 2008 | title = The Fallacy of the 'Failed State' | url = | journal = Third World Quarterly | volume = 29 | issue = 8| page = 1498 | doi=10.1080/01436590802544207}}&lt;/ref&gt; State building can also assist predatory states to strengthen their institutions, reinforcing abusive authority and further fueling grievances and popular resistance.&lt;ref name="Call, Charles T 2008"/&gt;

In practice, however, there remains confusion over the differences between state-building and peace-building. The UN's [[High-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change]] stated that "along with establishing security, the core task of peace-building is to build effective public institutions that, through negotiations with civil society, can establish a consensual framework for governance with the rule of law".&lt;ref&gt;High-Level Panel of Threats, Challenges and Change, paragraph 229&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a 2004 UN study found that a number of UN officials felt that the establishment of effective and legitimate state institutions was a key indicator of a successful peace operation.&lt;ref&gt;Call, Charles T (2008), "The Fallacy of the 'Failed State', 'Third World Quarterly'', 29:8, p 1498.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Market-oriented aid==

Aid is an important part to the development dialogue. In the 1980s and 1990s due to a series of economic crises and unsuccessful attempts in intervention programs in [[Africa]], [[Latin America]], and [[Eastern Europe]], the international community shifted towards a market-oriented model of foreign aid.&lt;ref name="Fritz, V. 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fritz | first1 = V. | last2 = Menocal | first2 = A. R. | year = 2007 | title = Developmental states in the new millennium: Concepts and challenges for a new aid agenda | url = | journal = Development Policy Review | volume = 25 | issue = 5| pages = 531–552 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-7679.2007.00384.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donor countries believed that a reduction in the size and the reach of the state could provide a more efficient outcome.&lt;ref name="Fritz, V. 2007"/&gt; However, the success of East Asia, East Europe, Brazil, and India has suggested even market economies require a capable state to grow sustainably.  Moreover, international donors became concerned over seriously malfunctioning states in the 1990s, i.e. [[Sierra Leone]] and [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name="Fritz, V. 2007"/&gt;

==State Capacity==
Economic historians Noel Johnson and Mark Koyama define state capacity as "the ''ability'' of a state to collect taxes, enforce law and order, and provide public goods."&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Noel D.|last2=Koyama|first2=Mark|date=April 2017|title=States and economic growth: Capacity and constraints|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014498316301966|journal=Explorations in Economic History|volume=64|pages=1–20|doi=10.1016/j.eeh.2016.11.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however, various definitions of state capacity among scholars.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berwick, Elissa and Fotini, Christia|first=|date=Forthcoming 2017|title=Building State Capacity|url=|journal=Annual Review of Political Science|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berwick and Fotini consolidate the literature of state capacity into 3 different domains: extractive capacity, governmental capacity, and regulatory-productive capacity:&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
* '''Extractive capacity''' is the process of collecting rents in order to provide resources for the governed. Taxing is the most common form of extraction.  Tilly argues that state-building was not intended, but once it has begun, extraction capacity was necessary.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; Furthermore, Herbst argues that war is a catalyst to start or increase extractive capacity.&lt;ref&gt;Herbst, Jeffrey. "War and the State in Africa." International Security (1990): 117-139&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Governmental capacity''' is the ability of lower level governmental workers to implement the agenda of the higher level of government. 
* '''Regulatory-Productive Capacity''' is the capacity of the state to provide output for the citizens. This output can include the enforcement of laws and the setting of policy for the citizens. 
State capacity is widely cited as an essential element to why some countries are rich and others are not: "It has been established that the richest countries in the world are characterized by long-lasting and centralized political institutions"; "that poverty is particularly widespread and intractable in countries that lack a history of centralized government... and are internally fragmented"; "and countries with weak state capacity are particularly vulnerable to civil war and internal conflict".&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Pritchett, Woolcock &amp; Andrews (2013)&lt;sup&gt;[[State-building#cite note-36|[36]]]&lt;/sup&gt; offer a criticism of why state building fails to work. They claim that many countries are in a capability trap – countries are, at most, converging at a very low pace to the same levels of state capacity. They estimate that on average, it would take 672 years for the bottom 15 countries to reach the state capability level of the best performer if their capabilities keep growing at the same average rate with which they have grown since their political independence.{{efn|They use three index to estimate state capability: i) ‘government effectiveness’ from the World Bank World Governance Indicators, ii) resource efficiency, from the Bertelsmann Transformation Index, and iii) ‘progressive deterioration in public services’ from the Failed State Index.}} Other indexes suggest that countries are not catching up: the bureaucratic quality and corruption index from the International Country Risk Guide (ICRG) have a negative pace of growth for the bottom 30 countries. The authors argue that the capability trap shows that external assistance to increase state capacity have not been successful in accelerating the development process. They identify that this implementation failure may occur through two techniques: i) ''systemic isomorphic mimicry'', by which the structures of institutions are imitated (specific rules are followed) but they do not serve purposes functional to the society; and ii) ''premature load bearing'', in which the pressure exerted by outsiders undermines the organic evolution of local institutions.

== State structures within the concept of state-building ==

The term "state" can be used to mean both a geographic sovereign political entity with a permanent population, a defined territory, a government, and the capacity to enter into relations with the other states, as defined under international law (Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States, December 26, 1933, Article 1),  as well as a set of social institutions claiming a monopoly of the legitimate use of force within a given territory (Max Weber, 1919).

For the purposes of state-building in environments of instability, the sub-structures of states can be defined as a political regime (or system of government), a governance framework (or constitution), and a set of state institutions (or organizations) such as the armed forces, the parliament, and the justice system. State capacity refers to the strength and capability of the state institutions. Nation conventionally refers to the population itself, as united by identity, history, culture, and language.

===Authoritarian regime===

Governments that have implemented the top-down method present the idea that there is a great external threat that can diminish the capabilities of a state and its citizens. The perceived threat creates an incentive that focuses policy, make elites cooperate, and facilitates the adoption of a nationalistic ideology. In an [[authoritarian government]], political, military, and ideological power is concentrated to be conducive to policy continuation. The bureaucracies implemented are well trained, well paid, and highly competitive in recruitment and promotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Evans | first1 = P. | last2 = Rauch | first2 = J. E. | year = 1999 | title = Bureaucracy and growth: A cross-national analysis of the effects of "Weberian" state structures on economic growth | url = | journal = American Sociological Review | volume = 64 | issue = 5| pages = 748–765 | doi=10.2307/2657374}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economically successful states in East Asia have taken on programs to create infrastructure, subsidize the farming sector, provide credit, support spending on targeted research, and invest in health and education. However, most governments are non-developmental and unstable. Furthermore, even when countries have tried to pursue authoritarian strategies that have worked, specifically Brazil, a divided military, regional oligarchs in power, and vast disparities in inequality delegitimized the regime.&lt;ref&gt;Kay, C., Why East Asia overtook Latin America: agrarian reform, industrialisation and development. Third World Q 2002, 23 (6), 1073-1102.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Democratic regime===

A democratic regime engages citizens more actively than a top-down government. It respects the right of citizen to contest policies. Successful democracies developed political capacities by nurturing active citizenship, maintaining electoral competitiveness that gave value to the votes of the poor, fostered political parties that were strongly oriented towards equality, and had strong party-social movement ties.

== Approaches ==
While many specific techniques exist for creating a successful state-building strategy, three specific approaches have been identified by the recent 2010 UNRISD report.&lt;ref name="Poverty Reduction pp. 3"/&gt;  These three approaches would all fall under the endogenous school of thinking, and are: [[Good Governance]], [[New Public Management]], and [[Decentralization]].&lt;ref name="Poverty Reduction pp. 3"/&gt;

=== Good governance ===
{{main article|Good governance}}
[[Good governance]] is a very broadly used term for successful ways a government can create public institutions that protect people’s rights.      There has been a shift in good governance ideals, and as Kahn&lt;ref name="un.org"&gt;Khan, Mushtaq H. Governance, Growth and Poverty Reduction. Governance, Growth and Poverty Reduction. DESA, June 2009. Web. 10 Nov. 2010. &lt;http://www.un.org/esa/desa/papers/2009/wp75_2009.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; states, "The dominant 'good governance' paradigm identifies a series of capabilities that, it argues are necessary governance capabilities for a market-friendly state.  These include, in particular, the capabilities to protect stable property rights, enforce the rule of law, effectively implement anti-corruption policies and achieve government accountability."
This good governance paradigm is a market-enhancing process which emerged in the 1990s.  This approach involves enforcing the rule of law, creating stronger property rights, and reducing corruption.  By focusing on improving these three traits, a country can improve its market efficiency.  There is a theoretical cycle of market failure&lt;ref name="un.org"/&gt; which explains how a lack of property rights and strong corruption, among other problems, leads to market failure:

* The cycle starts with economic stagnation, which can enhance and expose the inefficiencies of a weak government and rule of law that cannot effectively respond to the problem.
* Because a government is unaccountable or weak, small interest groups can use the government for their specific interests, resulting in rent seeking and corruption.
* Corruption and rent seeking from interest groups will lead to weak property rights that prevent citizens and smaller businesses from the assurance that their property is safe under national law.  Also the corruption will result in welfare-reducing interventions.
* These weak property rights and welfare-reducing interventions lead to high transaction cost markets.
* High transaction cost markets lead back to economic stagnation.

While it is understood that improving rule of law and reducing corruption are important methods to increasing the stability and legitimacy of a government, it is not certain whether this approach is a good basis for a state building approach.  Researchers&lt;ref name="un.org"/&gt; have looked at this approach by measuring property rights, regulatory quality, corruption, and voice and accountability.  There was little correlation found between increasing property rights and growth rates per capita GDP.&lt;ref name="Poverty Reduction pp. 3"/&gt; Similarly, there is disagreement among development researchers as to whether it is more beneficial to promote comprehensive set of reforms or to promote a minimal set of necessary reforms in contexts of poor institutionalization. Proponents of the former approach have put forward the concept of "good enough governance".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grindle|first=Merilee S.|date=2007|title=Good Enough Governance Revisited|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-7679.2007.00385.x/epdf|journal=Development Policy Review|volume=25 | issue = 5 |pages=553–574|doi=10.1111/j.1467-7679.2007.00385.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New Public Management ===

In response to the unsuccessful attempts to strengthen government administrations, developing countries began to adopt market-oriented managerial reforms under the pressure of the IMF and the World Bank. [[New Public Management]] approach first emerged in New Zealand and the United Kingdom in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Poverty Reduction pp. 3"/&gt;  New Public management uses market like reforms within the public sector to provide the government with the necessary power to implement a development plan on the economy while also using competitive market-based techniques to enhance public sector production.  It changed public sector employment practices from career tenure positions towards limited-term contracts for senior staff, locally determined pay, and [[performance-related pay]].&lt;ref name="Poverty Reduction pp. 3"/&gt; Secondly, the provision of government services shifted towards contracts, franchising, vouchers, and user charges in an effort to promote efficiency in service provision to citizens.&lt;ref name="Poverty Reduction pp. 3"/&gt;

In this type of government, large bureaucracies within a ministry (the principal) no longer maintain their hierarchical structure but rather are composed of operational arms of ministries that perform the role of an individual agent. The strategy has been more prominent in liberal market-driven policy regimes like New Zealand, United Kingdom, and the United States. Continental Europe has been more resistant to implementing this type of policy. In developing countries, the implementation of these types of infrastructure has been difficult because the markets for the delivery of services are imperfect and increase the danger of regulatory capture by companies. For successful implementation, governments must have the infrastructure to measure reliable performance indicators and the capacity to regulate the behavior of private providers.&lt;ref name="Poverty Reduction pp. 3"/&gt;

=== Decentralization ===
In reference to state building approaches [[decentralization]] is beneficial because "It seeks to reduce rent-seeking behavior and inefficient resource allocation associated with centralized power by dispersing such power to lower levels of government, where the poor are likely to exercise influence and a variety of actors may participate in the provision of services".&lt;ref&gt;UNRISD 2010. “Building State Capacity for Poverty Reduction.” Chapter 10, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Limitations to decentralization are the reduction of the meritocratic basis can limit the state's capacity to serve citizens, limited control of the fiscal funds at the local level can prevent effectiveness, and substantial inequalities in fiscal capacity among different regions can create ineffective redistribution of resources. Therefore, for these policies to work, there must be coordination efforts to ensure that growth-oriented and redistributive strategies initiated at the central government are implemented regionally. Furthermore, government elites must be in favor of low-income groups and grass root groups should be able to engage with local authorities during policy making.&lt;ref name="Poverty Reduction pp. 3"/&gt;

== Examples of state-building ==
European states replicated or bequeathed their institutions in the territories they colonized, but many new emerging states have evolved differently. European states consolidated after long years of internal and external struggles that greatly differ in context from the struggles of some recently emerged states.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Tilly, Charles (1985). "War making and state making as organized crime," in ''Bringing the State Back In'', eds P.B. Evans, D. Rueschemeyer, &amp; T. Skocpol. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kosovo===

Kosovo has gone through extensive state building by the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), that assumed all executive, legislative and judicial powers in 1999, aiming to restore order, stability and peace in the turbulent region. This is a unique example of state-building that is directly administered by external actors, the effectiveness of which is to this date contested. The Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Kosovo, Enver Hoxhaj claimed Kosovo is the most successful state-building example in the region,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ministry of Foreign Affairs|title=Hoxhaj: Kosovo, the most successful state-building example in the region.|url=http://www.mfa-ks.net/?page=2,217,1398|accessdate=29 January 2018|work=Ministry of Foreign Affairs - Republic of Kosovo.|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as its transition from war and genocide, to peace and progress has been remarkable. The developmental progress of Kosovo is apparent in its new institutional framework, that although initially centrally planned and administered by the UNMIK, has gradually transferred competencies to relevant national bodies and relevant institutions. The 2012 Report of the Secretary-General on the UNMIK claims of 'encouraging signals of commitment by the parties to engaging with one another through peaceful means and dialogue to resolve their differences'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2012 Report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo|url=https://unmik.unmissions.org/sites/default/files/old_dnn/S-2012-818.pdf|website=Reports of the Secretary-General on UNMIK|publisher=UNMIK|accessdate=29 January 2018|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Kosovo remains a "black hole"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coelho|first1=J|title=Building State Failure in Kosovo?|journal=Contemporary Southeastern Europe|date=2015|volume=2|issue=2|pages=17–25|url=http://www.suedosteuropa.uni-graz.at/cse/sites/default/files/papers/coelho_kosovo.pdf|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Europe, being a semi-consolidated authoritarian regime, noting high levels of corruption, crime and unemployment, casting doubts over the extent to which state-building was successful. Arguably, the state is still overly dependent on international aid and external assistance for its economy, part of which is still linked to networks of the old war economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Deppler|first1=M|title=The Economic Consequences of the Kosovo Crisis: An Updated Assessment|url=https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/kosovo/052599.htm#II|website=International Monetary Fund|accessdate=29 January 2018|date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extensive state building

===Latin America===

Latin America experienced a period of rapid economic growth and political stability in the late-19th century, following [[Independence of Latin America|independence]] and subsequent decades of decline caused by violence, reduced state-capacity, and fiscal fragmentation. This trajectory is markedly successful relative to other{{which|date=September 2017}} post-conflict societies at the time. Differences can be attributed{{by whom|date=September 2017}} to the demography of Latin America compared to other newly-independent European colonies, the massive European presence in Latin America,{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} the collapse of indigenous institutions, and the death of indigenous populations - unparalleled at the time. Latin Americans also enacted a number of liberal public policies swiftly and effectively, such as [[abolitionism|abolition]] of [[slavery]] ([[Saint-Domingue]] in 1793, [[Haiti]] in 1804, [[New Spain]] in 1813, [[Peru]] in 1854, Brazil in 1888), socializing property rights over land, and eliminating public monopolies, which fostered long-term stability that facilitated economic growth and established a new political economy for these new nations. The growth and stability seen in Latin America, however, did come at a high social cost  in the form of social inequality that continued into the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;Bates, Robert H., John H. Coatsworth, and Jeffrey G. Williamson. 2007. “Lost Decades: Post-independence Performance in Latin America and Africa.” The Journal of Economic History&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century it became economically and politically difficult for Latin American countries to increase revenues, which led states to turn to debt for the necessary resources to pay for war.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} As a result, Latin American countries did not establish the same tax basis that their European counterparts did. This can be explained by the predatory theory. Studies on the extraction of tax revenues have demonstrated that both external and internal rivals affect the ability of a state to develop and extract resources from its citizens. Interstate rivals had a positive effect on the state's capacity to extract resources while intrastate rivals had a negative effect on state building.&lt;ref name="Thies, C.

[[Charles Tilly|Tilly]]'s theory that external threats strengthen the state's capacity to extract taxes from its citizens can apply to developing countries in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title = State Building, Interstate and Intrastate Rivalry: A Study of Post-Colonial Developing Country Extractive Efforts, 1975-2000 |jstor = 3693563 |journal = International Studies Quarterly |date = 2004-01-01 |pages = 53–72 |volume = 48 |issue = 1 |first = Cameron G. |last = Thies |doi=10.1111/j.0020-8833.2004.00291.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of both external state rivals and internal ethnic rivals prompted states to increase their extraction of taxes from citizens while internal political rivals failed to affect the extraction of taxes.{{citation needed | reason= This statement is contested in political science|date= February 2016}} The [[leader]]s in power try to maintain their position by catering to the majority ethnic group and by increasing taxes to gain the resources to diminish threats from minority ethnic groups. Thus the presence of internal ethnic rivals creates the capacity to significantly increase the [[tax ratio]].

Drawing on Charles Tilly's theory of European state formation, a number of scholars have suggested that in focusing on internal rivalries, rather than challenging colonial borders, rulers were "less likely to see their economies as a resource to be nurtured than as an object of periodic plunder—the analogy to Olson's (1993) roving bandits should be clear" (Thies, 2004: 58). In the absence of external threats, rulers thus had no impetus to replicate the patterns described by Tilly—war making, coercion, resource extraction—that had proven crucial to the process of centralization of power in the states of Europe.

For example, in ''[[States and Power in Africa: Comparative Lessons in Authority and Control|States and Power in Africa]]'' (2000), [[Jeffrey Herbst]] explains that "domestic security threats, of the type African countries face so often, may force the state to increase revenue; however, civil conflicts result in fragmentation and considerable hostility among different segments of the population", undermining the state's ability to rally the population's support for the "national project" (2000: 126).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title = Herbst, J.: States and Power in Africa: Comparative Lessons in Authority and Control. (Second edition) (eBook, Paperback and Hardcover) |url = http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10355.html |website = press.princeton.edu |access-date = 2016-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a later article, Herbst argues that war in Europe lead to strong states and that without war African states will remain weak.&lt;ref name="Herbst"&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor = 2538753 |title = War and the State in Africa |last = Herbst |first = Jeffery |date = Spring 1990 |journal = International Security |doi = 10.2307/2538753 |pmid = |volume=14 |page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, external threats allowed states to tax, increase taxation, and forge a national identity. Additionally, the states that were invaded and taken over (such as [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland-Lithuania]] or Ireland) by stronger countries were militarily and politically weak. African states are poor, have weak governments, and are fragmented on ethnic or regional lines. According to theory, these weak African states should be susceptible to external threats, but this is not the case. In Africa, Herbst notes, there are rarely conflicts between states, and if there are, war does not threaten the existence of the state. For example, in the 1979 [[Uganda–Tanzania War|Uganda-Tanzania]] War, Tanzania invaded Uganda to overthrow [[Idi Amin]], but after the Tanzanians had removed Amin, they left the country. Although African states do not experience widespread interstate war, Herbst argues they need it to reform the tax structure and to build a national identity. Herbst concludes that war in Africa is likely to occur when African leaders realize that their economic reforms and efforts to build a national identity do not work and in desperation will start wars to build the states that their countries need.&lt;ref name="Herbst"/&gt; [[James A. Robinson (economist)|James Robinson]] disagrees with Herbst in the grade of influence of war on state-building, stating that European colonization and European influences in the continent impacted more deeply the creation of institutions, and therefore, states in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robinson | first1 = James A | year = 2002 | title = States and Power in Africa by Jeffrey I. Herbst: A Review Essay | url = | journal = Journal of Economic Literature | volume = 40 | issue = 2| pages = 510–519 | doi=10.1257/jel.40.2.510}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of | 2017}} the provision of [[public services]], another dimension of state-building, which includes the management of human capital within the realm of service along with the delivery of public services, remains another major challenge for post-conflict African nations. Academics have built models of the political economy in post-conflict African societies to understand the trade-off between the capability, delivery, and stability of public-service administration, and policies which result in weak civil service rooted in the nations' legacies of conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Blum, Jurgen, Fotini Christia, and Daniel Rogger. 2016. “Public Service Reform in Post-Conflict Societies.”&lt;/ref&gt;

Several researchers have emphasized that the internal violence seen in Africa was characteristic for [[early modern Europe]]an politics and that this{{which|date=September 2017}} type of structure may resolve to produce an increased level of political order.&lt;ref name="Thies, C. G. 2000" /&gt;{{qn|date=September 2017}} A number of scholars have  criticized this claim for its "excessively Darwinian", overly deterministic and Euro-centric understanding of the process of state-formation (Thies, 2004: 69, see also Joseph, 1997).

==== South Sudan ====
The international intervention which culminated in renewed conflict in South Sudan is cited{{by whom|date=September 2017}} as an example of a flawed application of international state-building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/23/world/africa/quandary-in-south-sudan-should-it-lose-its-hard-won-independence.html|title= Quandary in South Sudan: Should It Lose Its Hard-Won Independence?|last= Gettleman|first= Jeffrey|date= 2017-01-23|work= The New York Times|access-date= 2017-05-19|issn= 0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 9, 2011, with unilateral{{clarify|date=September 2017}} support from the [[United Nations Security Council]] and the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development ([[IGAD]]), the nation of [[South Sudanese independence referendum, 2011|South Sudan]] was officially recognized{{by whom|date=September 2017}} as an independent Sovereign, forged by an alliance of rebel groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/10/world/africa/10sudan.html|title= After Years of Struggle, South Sudan Becomes a New Nation|last= Gettleman|first= Jeffrey|date= 2011-07-09|work= The New York Times|access-date= 2017-05-19|issn= 0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of building this state, however, had begun in 2005 with the proclamation of the [[Comprehensive Peace Agreement]] (CPA), a militarist{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} agreement forged among warlords to establish a military dictatorship in South Sudan.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} The United States, Britain, Norway, and the IGAD conceptualized and facilitated the process as the solution to the ongoing [[Second Sudanese Civil War]] of 1983 to 2005.&lt;ref name="Mamdani"&gt;{{Cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/08/opinion/can-african-union-save-south-sudan-from-genocide.html|title= Can the African Union Save South Sudan from Genocide?|last= Mamdani|first= Mahmood|date= 2017-01-08|work= The New York Times|access-date= 2017-05-19|issn= 0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; This agreement rested on an assumption that the terms of a peace agreement should be determined solely by military leaders.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Later, in 2010, an attempt was made{{by whom|date=September 2017}} to include political leaders in the state-building process through the [[All South Sudanese Political Parties convention]], which ultimately resolved to create a transitional government with representation from all major political factions, with a goal of hosting free and fair elections within two years of independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article36650|title= Final Communiqué of Southern Sudan Parties Conference on Referendum - Sudan Tribune: Plural news and views on Sudan|website= www.sudantribune.com|language= en|access-date= 2017-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the transitional government never kept these terms, and South Sudan subsequently devolved into fierce ethnic conflict and civil war. Mahmood Mamdani asserts that this renewed violence was caused by the blatant disregard that South Sudan's rulers have shown for the peace treaties, due to a perception of reassurance through unconditional international support. The treaties have in effect become, as Jeffrey Herbst describes, unenforceable contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url= https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/901048279|title= States and power in Africa : comparative lessons in authority and control|last= Ira,|first= Herbst, Jeffrey|isbn= 9780691164144|oclc= 901048279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mamdani and other scholars have called for the establishment of a new transitional process, through a [[Failed state#Neotrusteeship|neotrusteeship]] facilitated by the [[African Union]] (AU).{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} They cite the successful resolution of the Gambian post-election crisis&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/world/africa/gambia-adama-barrow-yahya-jammeh.html|title= Troops Enter Gambia as New President Is Sworn In|last= Searcey|first= Dionne|date= 2017-01-19|work= The New York Times|access-date= 2017-05-19|last2= Barry|first2= Jaime Yaya|issn= 0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; to assert that the AU is the only international institution with the credibility and regional representation required to effectively manage the crisis. They assert that this new transition should exclude all participants from the first failed government, should be jointly mandated by the AU and the UN, and should be funded by the United States, Norway, and Britain as an admission of their past failures.&lt;ref name="Mamdani"/&gt;

===Asia===
====Palestine====
The [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) claims sovereignty over the [[Palestinian Territories]] whose legal statehood is somewhat widely recognized (though not by some major global powers), as well as representative status over the [[Palestinian people]], a claim that is universally recognized. However, it does not have sole jurisdiction over the areas it claims. In addition, many of those it aims to represent currently reside elsewhere, most notably in Arab countries such as [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], and [[Syria]]. Nonetheless, the PLO and other Palestinian organisations have historically made great efforts to install institutions of a type commonly associated with states in the Palestinian territories - as well as in countries with large numbers of Palestinian residents. Examples include:

* [[Jordan]] after the [[Six-Day War]] (June 1967), where the installation of parallel structures of power and mechanisms for taxation and education led to largely independent Palestinian enclaves which formed a threat to the power and legitimacy of the [[Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan|Hashemite monarchy]]&lt;ref name="Jabber, F. 1973 pp. 79–101"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jabber | first1 = F | year = 1973 | title = The Arab regimes and the Palestinian revolution, 1967-71 | url = | journal = Journal of Palestine Studies | volume = 2 | issue = 2| pages = 79–101 | doi=10.1525/jps.1973.2.2.00p0049v}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Lebanon]], where a similar process exacerbated ethnic and religious tensions&lt;ref name="Jabber, F. 1973 pp. 79–101"/&gt;

Despite the break-down of the [[Oslo process]] of 1993-2000 and the ongoing construction of [[Israeli settlement]]s (1967 to present), the [[Palestinian National Authority]] continues to engage in state-building activities in its territories and has referred to the "State of Palestine" in official documents since 2013. In 2003 the United Nations Security Council passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1515|UN Resolution 1515]], calling for the "establishment of an independent, democratic and viable Palestinian state". Despite this official acknowledgement of the legitimacy of PNA state-building by the international community, a 2011 report prepared by the London-based [[Overseas Development Institute]] found international assistance to have been "sporadic and fragmented".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.odi.org/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/publications-opinion-files/7318.pdf |title = The Palestinian State-building Agenda |date = 2011 |access-date = 24 January 2016 |website = Overseas Development Institute |publisher = Overseas Development Institute |last = Rocha Menocal |first = Alina}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the lack of consistent outside support, the report identified key challenges to Palestinian state-building at the international level, including the lack of horizon on "final status" negotiations, failed peace negotiations, the tightening of the [[Israeli occupation of the Palestinian Territories|occupation]], and the weak economic base, in addition to profound challenges at the domestic level, including:

* a lack of an internal political settlement
* weak linkages between ruling authorities and society at large
* weakened social cohesion
* gender inequality
* weak civil-society
* lack of capacity of formal PNA institutions
* (perceived) securitization of authority across the occupied Palestinian territory&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A number of scholars have questioned whether the Palestinian Authority was ever in a position to build a viable state. Edward Said, Neve Gordon and Sara Roy – among others – have argued that the PNA was designed{{by whom|date=September 2017}} as an "occupation subcontractor", only strengthening the power asymmetries between occupier and occupied.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Another strand of analysis, associated with Jamil Hilal and Mushtaq Khan (2004), portrays the PNA as a "transitional client quasi-state", stuck in a situation where core functions of the state remain in the hands of the Israeli state. They identify structural issues within the Oslo process and disunity and corruption prevalent among the Palestinian elite as key reasons for the failure of Palestinian state-building efforts.

[...] The state narrative of the Kingdom's history begins in the eighteenth century, a time of chaos akin to the Hobbesian state of nature. [...] The emergence of the first Saudi state (1744-1818) is introduced in Saudi literature as a 'corrective mechanism bringing the ''umma'' to the right path'. [...] The second Saudi state was born only six years after the demise of the first, during which time the land formerly ruled by the Saudi-Wahhabi alliance had 'returned to unbridled tribal rivalry and feuding'. [...] The second Saudi Kingdom ended in 1887 and was characterised by internal feuding, tribal rivalries, and civil war.

'''''The Spirit of Democratic Capitalism''''' is a 1982 book&lt;ref&gt;Novak, The Spirit of Democratic Capitalism, 1982, Simon &amp; Schuster, {{ISBN|978-0-8191-7823-7}} &lt;/ref&gt;  by philosopher [[Michael Novak]], in which Novak aims to understand and analyze the theological assumptions of democratic capitalism, its spirit, it values, and its intentions. Novak defines democratic capitalism as a pluralistic social system that contrasts with the unitary state of the traditional society and the modern socialist state.  He analyzes it as a differentiation of society into three power centers: a political sector, an economic sector, and a moral-cultural sector.  Each sector needs the others. Democracy needs the market economy and both need a pluralistic liberal culture. Against the continuing growth of democratic capitalism, modern socialism has contracted from a robust utopian program into vague “idealism about equality” and overwrought criticism of capitalism, most notably in the “liberation theology” of Latin America. Novak ends with the “beginnings of a theological perspective on democratic capitalism” illuminated by the journey from Marxism to realism of [[Reinhold Niebuhr]].

[[Irving Kristol]] described Novak's book as “unquestionably a major work for our times.” The Spanish translation of the book served as inspiration for the Chilean lawyer and politician [[Jaime Guzmán]] where he was not satisfied by [[Friedrich Hayek|Hayek]]s thought.&lt;ref name=Moncada28-29&gt;{{cite book |last=Moncada Durruti |first=Belén |date=2006 |title=Jaime Guzmán: una democracia contrarevolucionaria : el político de 1964 a 1980 |url=https://books.google.cl/books?id=M9xowjT-VGMC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;dq=%22jaime+eyzaguirre%22+%22jaime+guzman%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=n3CCfNlyME&amp;sig=0aFKL4_yPs0OXFUHQyNQcv9nWAI&amp;hl=es-419&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAmoVChMIuszRjJK6yAIVxJdyCh3FQQxN#v=onepage&amp;q=%22jaime%20eyzaguirre%22%20%22jaime%20guzman%22&amp;f=false |location=Santiago |publisher=RIL editores |pages=28–29|isbn=978-956-284-520-5|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction ==

No theologian “has yet assessed the theological significance of democratic capitalism”,(p13)   the society of “three dynamic and converging systems functioning as one: a democratic polity, an economy based on markets and incentives, and a moral-cultural system which is pluralistic and, in the largest sense, liberal.”(p14)  The link is not an accident.  You can only have democracy with a market economy, nourishing and nourished by a pluralistic liberal culture: a threefold system.

Democratic capitalism requires economic growth, the “belief of all individuals that they can better their condition.”(p15)  Without growth and social mobility democracy devolves into the Hobbesian “war of all against all.”

The treatments of democratic capitalism by religious writers, in papal encyclicals and mainline Protestant theology, have not really understood its essence.  So democratic capitalism needs a moral theory about itself, to define a “political economy most consonant with Judaic tradition and the Christian gospels”.(p20)

Capitalism is neither Heaven nor Hell. “Yet all other known systems of political economy are worse.”(p28)

== One: The Ideal of Democratic Capitalism ==

=== What is Democratic Capitalism? ===

People hate capitalism; its successes do not impress the “poets and philosophers and priests”(p31)  “The more it succeeds, the more it fails.”(p32)  Intellectuals indict capitalism for all kinds of sins: affluence, moral weakness, and vulgar taste.  The intellectuals that do defend capitalism have not made a broad enough case.

“What is the spirit of democratic capitalism?”(p36)  [[Max Weber]] saw that commerce takes on a new meaning, or spirit in capitalist countries. Capitalism’s spirit required free labor, practical intelligence, planned and organized for profit in a continuous enterprise in a stable network of law operating mainly in cities and towns.

But Weber did not see the “necessary connection between economic liberty and political liberty.”(p45)  It is not just “an economic system dependent upon a moral spirit”.(p46)  Rather than being an “iron cage” “democratic capitalism is demonstrably open”(p47); it reinvents itself constantly.  “The spirit of democratic capitalism is the spirit of development, experiment, adventure.  It surrenders present security for future betterment.  In differentiating the economic system from the state, it introduced a novel pluralism into the very center of the social system.”(p48)

=== Pluralism ===

The big idea in democratic capitalism is pluralism.  A traditionalist or socialist society “imposes a collective sense of what is good and true... exercised by one set of authorities.”(p49)  But can  society work if no-one is in control?   Many people, from Solzhenitsyn to popes, find such a society immoral and chaotic.  Social scientists find it sickening, as producing anomie, alienation, etc.

The founders of democratic capitalism “feared absolutism more than they feared pluralism.”(p52)  In a plural society, people can question things.  One can step out from under one’s “sacred canopy” and experiences “culture shock.”  “In a genuinely pluralistic society, there is no one sacred canopy.”(p53)  Society is renewed by crises of conscience, the “taproot of democratic capitalism.”(p55)  Pluralism avoids the single “sacred canopy” ''by design''.

The founders deliberately separated economic institutions from the state, and limit the power of clerical and state bureaucrats to meddle in the economy.  Political activists compete in the political sector, economic activists in the economic sector and religious and intellectual activists in the moral-cultural sector.  ''By design'' it is hard for any one person to get power over all three sectors.  But the three sectors need each other.  Capitalism needs a moral culture to nourish “self-restraint, hard work, discipline and sacrifice”(p57) and a political system committed to limited government, a sound currency, and regulation of competition.

The authors of ''The [[Federalist Papers]]'' wanted to avoid the tyranny of the majority, so they constructed a political “system which would empower many factions and interests.”(p58)  No single group would be trusted with the common good, but gathered together, the combination of interests should “strike not to far off the mark.”(p58)  But this practical wisdom has been preempted by the utilitarians, and then accused by idealists of being merely utilitarian “interest-group liberalism.” Novak prefers to use his own Thomist tradition, recognizing the “dangers inherent in idealism, the uniqueness of the person, and the special advantages of the practical... order.”(p59)

We are born into a social world, into families, and only later become individuals.  The system of the founders institutionalizes this in three steps.  First it recognizes that all right-thinking people of goodwill do not hold the same moral vision.  The second thing is to differentiate “between and ''individual'' and a ''person''.”(p63)  “Personhood entails the right--the ''vocation''--to be different.  Third, it calls for a secular or civic faith.  Thus the US Constitution: “a practical, rather than creedal, vision of the good society.”(p66)  It does less than command the socialist virtues; it does more than license =mere interest group horse-trading.

“A democratic capitalist society is, in principle, uncommitted to any one vision of a social order.”(p67)  Therefore,  moral-cultural institutions belong to the system, but they must not ''command'' the system.  Religious bodies have a role.  “But it is neither in command nor at the center.”(p69)

=== Emergent Probability ===

Democratic capitalism has a particular view of history.  It is the notion of “emergent probability.”  It thinks of the world as an emerging system of goods of order as developed by [[Bernard Lonergan]].  [[Adam Smith]]’s [[The Wealth of Nations]] was an attempt to understand how the world might be organized to provide such goods “so as to raise the wealth of all nations.”(p77) It proposed organizing the world not from the top down but from the bottom up, “to empower the rationality of every individual.”(p79)  It is not sufficient, but it is necessary.

=== Sin ===

“Political economy must deal with humans as they are”,(p82) including evil.  Each system identifies the greatest evil.  For traditional societies it is disorder, for socialist societies, inequality, for democratic capitalist societies it is tyranny.

In democratic capitalism we turn attention from “the moral intentions of individuals and toward the final social consequences of their actions.”(p89)  This results in affording high status to commerce and industry.  The clergy is fanatic, the military plundering, the nobles proud and belligerent, the state parasitic.  But commerce aligns with liberty, requires a “healthy realism” and is insensitive to station and class, and it provides a center of power separate from politics.

Leftists accuse capitalism of institutionalizing selfishness and greed.   But “self-interest” is something more.  Quoting [[Milton Friedman|Milton]] and [[Rose Friedman]]: “Self-interest is not myopic selfishness.  It is whatever it is that interests the participants, whatever they value, whatever goals they pursue.”(p94) It includes interest in the religious, moral, scientific and just.  Democratic capitalism recognizes that sinfulness cannot be eradicated.  It tries to make sinful tendencies productive and creative.

=== Providence and Practical Wisdom ===

When [[Thomas Aquinas]] abandoned God as ''Nous'' for ''Providence'' he created a problem for politics: “how can political economy be Provident?”(p96)  It takes more than theory; it takes practical intelligence and wisdom in as it relates to “time, the market, the so-called invisible hand, profit, and the zero-sum society”(p97).

Under democratic capitalism ''time'' takes on a new meaning.  People start looking forward to the future instead of back to the past.  They break out of eternal cycles and experiment.  Time is money, and people are advised not to waste it. Religion becomes activist rather than meditative.  When people become concerned about time as an asset, they intelligently organize life into time saving habits.  Such practical intelligence increases wealth.  “Practical insights are the primary cause of wealth.”(p103)

Intuitively, when millions of people enter the marketplace the result must be anarchy.  “Traditionalists and socialists... occupy the commanding heights and try to impose order.”(p104)  In fact, economic activism promotes order; under scarcity people need one another, and must coordinate their activities through the price system.  [[Adam Smith]]’s metaphor of the “invisible hand” tells us is that the motives of individuals do not determine the social result of their actions.  There seems to be an order, a system “beneath the seeming individuality of individual choices.”(p114)  Rational order may exist without rational commands from on high.

Markets always get a bad press: Mammon, usury, and incompatibility with humane values, and so on.  But commercial values furnish “a school of virtue favorable to democratic governance.”(p117) It encourages “the cooperative spirit”, the “attention to law”, self-determination, limited government and encouragement to industry, the discipline of common sense, attention to the small savings and small gains that power economic growth. It breaks the utopian vision that fails to deliver.  It is “proportioned to man as he is, not as dreams would have him”.(p118)  But there are losses, to old communal ties and the heroic spirit.  “Commercial virtues are not, then, sufficient to their own defense. [It] needs taming and correction by a moral-cultural system... [and] by the political system and the state.”(p121)

The socialist ideal is the quest for “security and equality”, the capitalist for “self-improvement and growth”.(p123) But risks cannot be avoided in making the world predictable and safe.  It creates a zero-sum society foredoomed to failure.  Democratic capitalism, committed to growth offers the hope of a larger future to all.  It is not utopian, but it offers “a practical wisdom worthy of admiration”(p126), a “plain sort of wisdom suited to this world.”(p126)

=== Community ===

The meaning of community in traditional society is clear.  “Yet pluralistic societies develop their own powerful forms of community... of free persons in voluntary association.”(p129)  This community is “accessible to all human beings without exception” in the ''world''.  Democratic capitalism has developed “a novel social instrument: the voluntary association committed to business enterprise, the ''corporation''.”(p130)  I.e., the flagship institution of capitalism is social, corporate.  Commercial civilization is ''interdependent''.  The community depends on an ethos of cooperation. “Cultures in which individuals are not taught how to cooperate, compromise, and discipline themselves to practical communal tasks can make neither democratic politics nor market economies work.”(p134)

“Between individualism and collectivism, there is a third way: a rich pattern of association.”(p135)  It is a community of “colleagueship... an ethos of association, teamwork, and collaboration, oriented towards goals, voluntarily entered into.”(p138) And these associations make the conventional notions of “‘the consumer society’, ‘greed’, and ‘materialism’ seem very wide of the mark.”(p141)  Democratic capitalism aims to guarantee the pursuit of happiness.  Humans being social animals, they must “build decent and even affective relations among those who work together”(p142) in that pursuit.

=== The Communitarian Individual ===

Everyone knows that the term “bourgeois” is not a compliment.  Yet when democratic socialists list the values of their society they sound middle-class.  Perhaps the problem occurs because the supporters of democratic capitalism advertise themselves as individualists when, “under the mask” they are profoundly communitarian.  In [[Adam Smith]]’s ''[[The Theory of Moral Sentiments]]'' he emphasizes “fellow feeling, common sympathy, and benevolence”,(p145) while ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' he condones “self-love and self-interest.”

But who isn’t bourgeois, i.e., own their home and private property, these days?  Small businessmen, pension plan participants, academic critics. The game is to “redefine the bourgeoisie to fit the Marxian scheme in which one class oppresses another.”(p151)  It ends up defining the elite as an elite.  What’s the problem?  A bourgeois has “''economic independence''... ''owns property''... shares the ''cultural life of the city''”(p152)  And the bourgeoisie is open to all.  A noble can descend and join it, and a peasant or proletarian can  aspire and rise to it.  The bourgeoisie practice high standards and competitive habits.  Nor is it particularly “self-satisfied, secure, or smug.”(p153)  Middle class culture makes fun of the middle class.  “Latin American liberation theologians and others.. may threaten retribution upon the bourgeois class, but... they also appeal to the ''ideals'' of the middle class”.(p154)  “Bourgeois life is thick with activism, volunteerism, and mutual association.”(p154) And it is prepared to listen to criticism.

=== The Family ===

Although democratic capitalism is “designed to function with minimal dependence upon virtuous motives... [it] cannot function at all without certain moral strengths, rooted in institutions like the family.”(p156)  Yet many critics are hostile to what they call the “nostalgic family.”  They attack on three axes: economic, political, and moral-cultural.

Even libertarians center their analysis on the free individual and “rational self-interest.”  But “in ordinary experience, our own economic starting place in life is given us by our families.”(p161)  We have been thrown into life as “familial animals” for the “family is the major carrier of culture, transmitting ancient values and lessons... motivations... judgement... emotion, preferences and inclinations.”(p161)   “In the long run, the individual economic agent is dead.  Only his progeny survive to enjoy the fruits of his labors, intelligence and concern.”(p163)

“But if the family is a form of socialism which corrects the exaggerated individualism of capitalist economists, it is also a form of liberty which corrects the exaggerated collectivism of statists.”(p163) “The more the state invades the family, the less likely the prospect of self-government.”(p165)

The family is the first defense against utopianism.  “Those who seek moral perfection, full self-fulfillment, high happiness” are opposed to “the constraints of matrimony and childrearing.”(p167)  The family is nature’s school of virtue.  It teaches humility, “ordinary heroism,” self-governance, self-discipline, and critical judgment.  The bourgeois family is different from the aristocratic family and its inherited status, the peasant family, the extended ethnic family.  It is pluralistic, adaptable, nuclear, trans-cultural.  And now it must deal with the post-bourgeois elite family that wants to “find” rather than “better” itself.  “When self-government is no longer an ideal for individuals, it cannot be credible for the republic.”(p170)

=== Continuous Revolution ===

The pluralism of democratic capitalism affects everything, and not least the rivalries between the three systems: political, economic, and moral-cultural.  Each has its ethos and creates problems for the other two. This is by design, for the energy of conflict powers progress and correction. “It is a system intended to constitute a continuous revolution.”(p172)

The political system is separate from the moral-cultural system, but “clergymen and journalists, preachers and professors often place enormous pressures on the state”(p172) on behalf of their moral vision.  The political system is also separate from the economic system, yet profoundly affected by it.  Still, the political system also has enormous power over the economic system, through the people that work for it and those dependent on the political system for “grants, payments, and favors”(p173).  Legislative action has politicized moral and cultural issues from regulation of business to the role of women, homosexuality, abortion, real estate, busing, and educational experiments.  “The political system... encroaches significantly upon the economic system and the moral-cultural system.”(p174)

Leaders of both the political and moral-cultural system combine in harsh criticism of the economic system.  Their exaggerations omit what the economic system has done for democracy and for providing the wealth to found schools, churches, foundations, and freedom for artists and preachers.  Many critics fault capitalism for lack of democracy, as if it is appropriate for “every inquiry and action.”(p175)  But well-managed corporations all use the principle of subsidiarity, pushing decisions down the hierarchy.  The economic system creates problems for government because it is designed to.  “The virtues it requires, and the virtues it nourishes, are indispensable to a self-governing polity and to a sound morality.”(p181)

The moral-cultural system in the United States seems “the lest developed, most neglected, mot delinquent system... and it has become the most powerful, most ambitious, most dominating system.”(p182)  It has many strengths, vibrant churches, arts, and moral movements.  Ideas have consequences, and moral-cultural power is subject to the same temptations as economic and political power if attempts “to dominate both the state and the economy.”  Two temptations are the power and status available to those that help grow the state, and the notoriety available to those that debunk institutions and values that stand in the way of their own morality, culture, and politics.

== Two: The Twilight of Socialism ==

=== The Transformation of Socialism ===

What does socialism stand for today?  It seems to have shrunk to “idealism about equality... and hostility towards democratic capitalism”(p189) rather than the grand program of the “abolition of private property... state ownership of the means of production... abolition of ‘bourgeois democracy’... and an international order... transcending... frontiers... abolition of profit, abolition of imperialism... ‘socialist man.’”(p190)  In many ways, socialism has failed. in the economic sphere, nationalized industries, collectivized agriculture, administered prices and wages. In the political sphere, “the centralized administrative state has proved to be a more thorough instrument of oppression and exploitation than the democratic capitalist state.”(p191)  In the moral-cultural sphere socialism fails to tolerate “the broad range of dissent, human liberties, and human rights achieved in the democratic capitalist states.”(p191) Serious thinkers like [[C. Wright Mills]] and [[Leszek Kołakowski]] admit that socialism is seriously discredited.  It survives as “a mobilizing stencil for grievances... and to love as a ‘totalitarian political movement.’”(p195)

=== Socialism as Highmindedness ===

“Socialists seem to be in retreat both from theory and from program.”(p197) They define socialism as a set of moral injunctions on poverty, inequality, and democracy.  The young Novak thought of socialism as idealism; capitalism worked better, but it was “an inferior ideal.”(p198)  Yet [[Jacques Maritain]] found Americans, in the crucible of capitalism, “the most humane and the least materialist among modern [industrialized] peoples”.(p199)  Novak came to see something else.  Socialism required no moral heroism in him.  If it failed, the workers and the poor would suffer most.

Socialism may seem to be an injunction on poverty, inequality in freedom of action, and basic needs, but it pretty soon becomes “raising up the poor and pulling down the rich.”(p202)  It allows a monstrous government and ignores the source of economic dynamism—serious intellectual errors.  Democratic capitalism can do all this, but balances the competing injunctions—especially the question of “[w]ho will govern government?”(p203)  Anyway, “equal freedom of action for all” is impossible.  Without an ear for music, you cannot compete in music, etc.  Socialists see inequality as an affront; democratic capitalists see talent as a responsibility.

One way in which socialists dodge its failure is a commitment to “democratic control” of the means of production.  The fact is that participatory democracy does not work in the moral-cultural realm—religion, arts, literature—or in the economic realm of economic choices about the future.  Most people don’t want to spend long hours in “participation,” although the US excels already in associations, committees and groups.

Even though “[M]ost democratic socialists recognize that strict equality of incomes is unworkable and also unjust”,(p211) extreme disparities seem to be “immoral.”  Small entrepreneurs are OK but corporate salaries are “obscene.”  There is a need for “moral restraint”.  Still, the extravagance of the rich is the difference between socialist drabness and urban brightness and gaiety.  The rich pay for foundations that employ scholars, museums, galleries, universities, new business and technology investments.  In democratic capitalism you can change your life with skill and luck; in socialism the “only path upward is political favor.”

=== Income Distribution and Race ===

Suppose we accept the idea of democratic socialists that highly skilled workers only earn eight times the wage of the lowest paid, as in Cuba?  Actually in the United States in 1979 the top five percent earned a little less than seven times the average income of the lowest 20 percent.  But 0.5 percent earn more than 10 times the poorest.  Democratic socialists call this a scandal; democratic capitalists do not, because these higher incomes don’t hurt the lower paid and a society with unlimited incomes is “more dynamic, freer, more generous, more colorful”(217) than one without. And, of course, the rich pay a lot more in taxes.

A special problem for the United States is the relative poverty of blacks relative to whites.  Leftist Democrats insist on government programs rather than “personal initiative.”  Actually, according to [[Thomas Sowell]], most blacks are “disciplined, ambitious, hardworking, and conscientious in seizing opportunity.(p219)  In the long view, blacks have done well.  In 1900 blacks lived under segregation in the poorest part of the country.  Today, “Black households with two parents under age thirty-five, ''living in the North'', do better than equivalent white households.”(p221) Still, blacks demonstrate more social pathology than whites.  A catalyst is necessary.  “The spirit of democratic socialism... seems designed to prevent such a catalyst from ever emerging.”(p224)

=== The Transnational Corporation ===

Though socialists are hostile to transnational corporations, in early 1980 socialist leader [[Robert Mugabe]] wanted to welcome them to [[Zimbabwe]].  For Mugabe, “socialism accepts the brotherhood of man.”(p225)  But what are the corporation, the labor union, banking, the stock exchange if not communal, depending on trust beyond force, contracts, and law?   Critics accuse transnational corporations of wanting to manage the world and various other crimes against developing nations. “‘Manage the world’ is the aim of socialism, not the aim of market systems.”(p228)  Anyway, if economic aid comes not through corporations, then what?  All criticisms of corporations come down to: compared to what?

== Three: A Theology of Economics ==

=== The Catholic Anti-Capitalist Tradition ===

A huge task awaits theologians in thinking theologically about economic reality at three levels.  They must understand ''economic reality'' (scarcity, work, money, capital accumulation, etc.) in every economic system in every age.  They must understand the specific ''systems'' on offer, from feudalism to mercantilism to capitalism and socialism.  Then they must understand the details, the moral and ethical dilemmas that “occur ''within'' particular systems.”(p240)  Novak’s book is intended to fill the vacuum in understanding democratic capitalism, for he thinks that “the actual practice of democratic capitalism is more consistent with the high aims of Judaism and Christianity than the practice of any other system.”(p242)

Obviously church criticism, particularly Catholic, of capitalism has been distinctly biased against it, at least until [[Pope John Paul II]]. This is probably due to a misunderstanding of Anglo-Saxon “individualism” by the continental Catholic hierarchy and that “the discoveries of modern economics seem to have affected it hardly at all.”(p241)

=== Christian Socialism in Europe ===

Many Christian thinkers have sought an accommodation with socialism and its program to end poverty and oppression.  For those espousing a Christian Marxism this means a Marxism emptied of everything: atheism, materialism, collectivization or one-party rule.  In the US [[John A. Ryan]] proposed a Catholic alternative to state socialism that inspired a Bishops’ “[[John A. Ryan#Program for social reconstruction|Program for Social Reconstruction]]” in 1919 that came close to FDR’s [[New Deal]].  More recently, Catholic bishops have moved decisively against capitalism, helping the poor with statist programs, rather like secular socialists.  These thinkers seem to give socialist plans the benefit of every doubt, while according none to democratic capitalism in its actual character.  Meanwhile, socialism “has been dying the death of a thousand qualifications.”(p254)

[[Juergen Moltmann]] has developed a theology of [[Christian socialism]].  It owes more to Hegel than to Aquinas. This “theology of hope” turns to the future and Christian hope.  It breaks away from “the struggle of the individual soul” and emphasizes the social (i.e. political) nature of the Christian vocation. Moltmann is critical of both Stalinism and capitalism.  He endorses democracy and socialism. “The oppressed hold in their hand the key for the liberation of mankind from oppression.”(p258)  Thus the poor are “objects, victims, and finally a messianic class sent to save the rich.”(p258)

Moltmann wants to subordinate economics to theology.  Capitalism is “outside the law, destructive of true community... monetary... inspiring wolflike animosity between man and man”(p262) and madly pursuing growth for growth’s sake and work for work’s sake.

Molmann defines his “socialism” as responding to five vicious circles in the world today: poverty, force, racial and cultural alienation, industrial pollution of nature, senselessness and godforsakenness.  Thus socialism no longer rests on a concrete program but becomes a “symbol for large and grand ideals.”(p270)  He “exhibits high confidence in governmental control over life... commends the distribution of wealth and a no-growth economy... respects political and moral-cultural liberties, but not economic liberties... a return to premodern conceptions.”(p270)

=== Guilt for Third World Poverty ===

In Latin America  the socialist myth “unites the political system, the economic system, and the moral-cultural system under one set of authorities.”(p272)  It inspires the most heavily armed states.  And it provides an excuse.  Catholic bishops ignore Catholic economic teachings of four hundred years to blame the United States for Latin American poverty.  It’s the Marxist stencil: “If I am poor, my poverty is due to malevolent and powerful others.”(p273)

[[Adam Smith]] drew attention to the two American experiments in 1776, one “based on the political economy of southern Europe” and the other “launching a new idea.”(p274)  So why is Latin America behind?  [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]] unearthed one reason.  Entrepreneurial businessmen, Christian and Jewish, were driven from Spain by an “alliance of church and state” that “banned or restricted enterprise in the private sector.”(p277)  Yet in 1969 the Catholic bishops of Peru said “we are the victims” and in 1974 the Catholic bishops in the US wrote that the “unchecked liberalism” of profit, competition, and private ownership led to “dictatorship” in Latin America.(p280)  This embarrassing economic ignorance demonstrates a failure to grasp “relevant economic reality.”

Socialism is as centralizing as it can get, and the Soviet Empire an extreme example of centralization.  Yet Marxist thought “today uses the theory of center and periphery as an accusation against democratic capitalism.  But every energetic pulse of economic activity become a “center.” The theory is just another way of explaining the poverty of the poor by the wealth of the wealthy.

=== Liberation Theology ===

Beginning in 1968 Roman Catholic bishops in Latin America began to develop a “[[liberation theology]]” based upon reading the Scriptures as a story of liberation.  They applied Scripture not to individuals but to “social structures and economic systems.”(p288)  The Anglo-Saxon Whig tradition of liberty is little known, but the “widespread Latin American antipathy towards commerce... is married... to a widespread desire for an integral, holistic, unitary system.”(p289)  There is a vacuum “into which liberation theology rushes.”(p289)  Religious liberation becomes a this-worldly “struggle for revolution against tyranny and poverty.”(p290)  As well as local oppressors, “unfair terms of trade” enrolls international capitalism as the global oppressor.  Of course, liberation theology, while specific in its critique of capitalism, is “vague and dreamy” about its program and about the institutions that will replace the old after the revolution. It is enough to know that capitalism “fosters individualism, competition, materialism, and greed.  Socialism offers an alternative set of values, which stress the virtues of participation, community, equality, and sacrifice.”(p295)  Liberation theologians defend the stagnation of socialist economies such as Cuba; at least  the Cubans “claim to supply basic necessaries to all the poor.”(p295)  Liberation theologians choose help for the poor now over a better future in a growing economy.

=== A Theology of Development: Latin America ===

Latin Catholic culture is different from northern European culture.  Cultural choices in economic affairs make a difference.  Archbishop [[Helder Camara]] of Brazil says that is sad that 80 percent of the world’s resources are at the disposal of 20 percent of its inhabitants.  But these resources were discovered within the last 200 years; the combustion engine, oil wells were discovered under Northern European Protestant culture.  So we could say that it is marvelous that 80 percent of the world’s resources have been discovered by one of the smaller cultures, and made available for use in every continent.  But more needs to be done.  “Nothing prevented Brazilians from inventing the combustion engine, the radio, the airplane, penicillin”.(p300)  But they didn’t.  Writes [[Gustavo Gutierrez]] in ''A Theology of Liberation'':  “The underdevelopment of poor nations... is... the sub-product of the development of other countries... [T]he capitalist system...  [creates] a center and a periphery... progress and riches for the few, and... poverty for the majority.”  Joseph Ramos prepared an economic critique of Gutierrez for the Catholic bishops in 1970.  Center and periphery is a truism.  Of course any economically active locale is a center. Nor is wealth created in one place subtracted from another.  There is far more wealth today than 200 years ago.  All peoples have benefited.  Nor is the US to blame for Latin American dependency.  Only 5 percent of US investment is made abroad.  Seventy percent of US exports go to developed countries. Return on US investments in Latin America is not particularly high, relative to other countries.  Gutierrez’s notion of class conflict applies to static economies.  Where there is growth there can be “relations of mutual advantage and cooperation.”(p306)  Nor will class struggle disappear with the abolition of private property. “Struggle over the political allocation of power and goods is historically one of the most bitter forms for struggle.”(p307)

Despite all this, Latin America has done well economically.  Since World War II, growth has averaged 5.2 percent per year, and real wages and salaries have increased by 2 percent per year, better than the US in 1865-1914.  Latin Americans are closing the “technological, organizational and management gaps”(p309) to produce a revolution in “human capital.”

But this revolution has not yet reached the bottom.  In 1970 about 40 percent lived below the poverty line and 20 percent in destitution.  To raise the destitute and poor to the poverty line would cost about 5 percent of GNP.  So the “economic capacity is present.”(p311) But the political will may be lacking.

Writing about institutions, liberation theologians favor socialism.  Writing about individuals they favor “economic independence, self-reliance, personal creativity”.(p312)  “Their rage against the existing order... prevents them from thinking ''institutionally'' about how to devise checks and balances against corporate power, while using it creatively to check clerical and military power.  They have not thought ''theologically'' about the vocation of laymen and laywomen in the world, particularly in commerce and industry.”(p313)  They do not think about using the commercial class to limit the power of traditional elites.  There is no vision of the liberation available from democratic capitalism.  “[T]heir path to liberation is ill-defended against state tyranny.”(p314)  They need to avoid the temptation that socialism is a more “noble way” than the “lowly” path of realistic democratic capitalism.

=== From Marxism to Democratic Capitalism ===

[[Reinhold Niebuhr]] was a Christian from the German Reformed tradition.  He started as a Christian Marxist and ended up more or less accepting the culture of democratic capitalism.  He began by recommending in 1931 the abridgment and destruction of “absolute property rights” and its replacement with tax-financed social insurance. He saw an identity between the ideal of Christianity and socialism.  But by mid-1933 he saw the property rights of the “small trader and farmer” as a “chance to perform a social function”.(p318)  Niebuhr grew up in close-knit German-American communities and thus understood socialism “as a protest against radical individualism”.(p318)  In 1935 Niebuhr wrote that capitalism was doomed, that “social ownership” was the only basis of “health and justice”, and that “social struggle” was necessary.  But by 1938 he recognized that the problem of power always remained.  “A Christian can give only ‘qualified loyalty’ to any political program.”(p321)  In 1940 he was impressed that the people elected [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] over [[Wendell Willkie]].  Democracy had worked in the US.  By 1948 he criticized the World Council of Churches for condemning equally capitalism and communism.  By 1952: “[Marxist] theory is incompatible with democratic responsibility; its theory of class conflict does not fit the multiple-class structure of modern industrial societies and is incompatible with the principle of ‘class collaboration’ upon which democratic politics depends”,(p323) and its utopian vision interferes with the practical interests of a “sane political movement.” Marxism’s sweeping generalizations are refuted by daily experience.”(p324) By 1961, society needs a trinity of goods: freedom, community, and justice.

Niebuhr came to believe in a “balance between political powers, economic powers, and moral-cultural powers.”(p325) He recognized that politics is not just a conflict of interests “but a rational engagement and enlargement of a native sympathy”.(p325)  He came to accept a harmony between [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]]’s “government of reason”, [[Alexander Hamilton|Hamilton]]’s realism about “interests” and [[James Madison|Madison]]’s “pre-Marxist analysis of the basis of collective and class interests in the varying ‘talents’ and consequent economic interests of the various classes.”(p326)  He understood that, checked by the political and moral-cultural systems the economic system “possessed its own integrity”.(p328) “[W]e must be careful to preserve whatever self-regulating forces exist in the economic process.” Otherwise the task of economic control endangers liberty.

Niebuhr always believed that capitalism tended to dangerous concentrations of power; he criticized individualism in light of man’s social nature.  Still he recognized that capitalism had “more moral and political resources to avoid catastrophe”  than its critics realized; Christians like him also misunderstood the nature of the Marxian program.  It was utopian, not practical.  In supporting nationalization, leftists did not count its costs in bureaucracy and centralization of power.  Failing to understand modern complexities they gave the “abolition of property a false halo it did not deserve.”(p331)  A “religious passion for justice must be balanced by pragmatic considerations”.(p331)  Still, the enormous wealth of the US (2-3 times Europe in the mid-1950s, ten times Asia) tempts people to envy and assume exploitation.  In the wake of the radicalizing of US elites in the Vietnam War and uncritical assumptions of Third World oppression by developed countries a new Niebuhr is needed to connect moralistic passions with reality.

=== A Theology of Democratic Capitalism ===

Building a humane social order is a long journey. “To know its ideals is to be restless... and to wish to do better”.(p333)  The ideals of socialism are well known.  It is a unitary system dominated by the state and tending to tyrannical unity.  Even though many democratic socialists have abandoned Marxism,  they still wish “to strengthen the political system at the expense of the economic system and the moral-cultural system.(p334)  Thinkers like [[Michael Harrington]] and [[Irving Howe]] see themselves as the conscience of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].  But they are not the conscience of democratic capitalism.  They are the conscience “of the socialist system they wish America yet to become.”(p334)  To create a conscience of democratic capitalism requires a reformulation of Christian theology in the light of knowledge about practical life under democratic capitalism, its “economics, industry, manufacturing, trade, and finance.”(p336)

''The Trinity''. Whatever the Trinity means, it seems that “God is to be conceived as a kind of community rather than solitary individual... What is most valued among humans is that community within which individuality is not lost.”(p338)  Socialism aims at community, but does not protect the individual.  Novak finds “dark illumination” in a political economy “differentiated and yet one... [where] each tames and corrects and enhances the others.”(p339)  All sorts of communities flourish, less rooted in kin, more voluntary and fluid, but communities for all that.  It is mediating communities that make the life of individuals and states possible.  When these are broken, the state is broken.

''The Incarnation''.  “The point of Incarnation is to respect the world as it is... to disbelieve any promises that the world is now or ever will be transformed into the City of God”,(p341) but still to hope.  That is what the Founding Fathers did when they “chose as their model citizen.. the free man of property and commerce.”(p343) Heroism and virtue were permitted, but “the system as a system was cut to common cloth.”  “They did not promise paradise, or peace and justice. “The task of political economy is not to guide the ship but to make a voyage possible.(p343)

''Competition''. People called to the religious life tend to be non-competitive.  There is a temptation to impose this culture upon others.  But a “political economy needs bold political leaders who thrive in contests of power and willful dreamers and builders who delight in overcoming economic difficulties in order to produce.  The will-to-power must be made creative, not destroyed.”(p344)  The Bible certainly understands life as a struggle. “Many are called, few are chosen,” “last shall be first,” etc.  Yet “Christian grace is never measured either by virtue or by worldly success.”(p346) Is competition foreign to a religion of “love, meekness, and peace”?  Not while it is so hard to “be meeker than one’s neighbor.”(p347)  The rich may find it hard to get into Heaven, but this is because they have more to answer for.  “It does not seem to be inconsistent with the gospels for each human to struggle, under the spur of competition with his fellows, to become all he can become.”(p348)

''Original sin''. The doctrine of original sin steels the mind against the utopian illusion, that “the evils and inconstancies of the human heart are superable” or caused by “evil structures.”(p349)  Every political economy has a theory of sin, something it is against.  Democratic capitalism is “designed against tyranny.”  As such, it does not repress human vice, to the shock of outsiders like Alexander Solzhenitsyn.  “Socialist societies repress sin much more effectively.  They begin by repressing economic activities.  A free society can tolerate vice because it believes in “the basic decency of human beings... Under an appropriate set of checks and balances, the vast majority of human beings will respond to daily challenges with decency, generosity, common sense, and even, on occasion, moral heroism.”(p351)

''The separation of realms''.  Democratic capitalist society cannot impose Christianity on its people.  Christians may try to “shape the will of the majority”(p351) but “must respect the consciences of others even more than law alone may demand.”(p351)  Anyway, Christian values make demands that are “not of this world.”  No practical human order can be run on purely Christian principles.  Christians should follow their conscience “and cooperate in coalitions where consensus may be reached.”(p352)  At “the heart of democratic capitalism is a differentiation of system designed to squeeze some good from sinful tendencies.”(p353)

''Caritas''. This is the ideal of  love “willing the good of the other as other”.(p353)  “To look upon history as love-infused by a Creator who values others as others... is to glimpse a world in which the political economy of democratic capitalism makes sense.”(p355) “in this scheme the individual is not atomic... [for] the fulfillment of the individual lies in a beloved community.  Yet any community worthy of such love values the singularity and inviolability of each person.  Without true individualism there is not true community.”(p356)  “The vision is that of a republic of independent, self-reliant, fraternal, cooperative citizens, each of whose interests includes the interests of all in brotherhood ‘from sea to shining sea’... guided by the motto ‘In God we trust”.(p357-8)

This book has not been about the practice of capitalism; it has been about grasping the ideals implied in its practice.  It now becomes possible to compare it with socialism, ideal against ideal, practice against practice.  If the real world of democratic capitalism is worse than its ideal, then how should it be judged?  By what standard?  It does not meet the ideals of democratic socialism because it has its own ideals.  It does not meet the highest ideals of Judaism and Christianity, for no political economy can do that.  But democratic capitalism stands ready for criticism and change.  It is designed for that, the only known system designed for “transformation by peaceful means.”(p359)  God designed creation as an arena of free will, and democratic capitalism honors that with a “non-coercive society... within which individuals and peoples are called to realize, through democratic methods, the vocations to which they believe they are called.”(p360)  “Under God, they may expect to meet exact and just judgment.”

'''Trinity Church Cemetery''' consists of three separate burial grounds associated with [[Trinity Church (Manhattan)|Trinity Church]] in [[New York City]]. The first was established in the Churchyard located at 74 Trinity Place at [[Wall Street]] and [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]]. In 1842, the church, running out of space in its churchyard, established Trinity Church Cemetery and Mausoleum in Upper Manhattan between Broadway and [[Riverside Drive (New York)|Riverside Drive]], at the Chapel of the Intercession (now The [[Church of the Intercession, New York]]), formerly the location of [[John James Audubon]]'s estate.&lt;ref name=nyt150206&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/08/nyregion/the-trinity-church-cemetery-in-washington-heights-holds-plenty-of-history.html?_r=0|title=Resting Place for the High and the Low: The Trinity Church Cemetery in Washington Heights Holds Plenty of History|date=February 6, 2015|work=New York Times|author=Julie Besonen}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third burial place is the Churchyard of [[St. Paul's Chapel]].

A no longer extant Trinity Church Cemetery was the Old Saint John's Burying Ground for St. John's Chapel. This location is bounded by Hudson, Leroy and Clarkson Streets near [[Hudson Square]]. It was in use from 1806&amp;ndash;52 with over 10,000 burials, mostly poor and young. In 1897, it was turned into St. John's Park, with most of the burials left in place. The park was later renamed Hudson Park, and is now [[James J. Walker Park]].&lt;ref&gt;http://nycemetery.wordpress.com/2011/01/04/st-johns-cemetery/&lt;/ref&gt;  (This park is different from a separate [[St. John's Park]], a former private park and residential block approximately one mile to the south that now serves as part of the Holland Tunnel access.)

The burial grounds have been the final resting place for many historic figures since the Churchyard cemetery opened in 1697. A non-denominational cemetery, it is listed in the United States [[National Register of Historic Places]] and is the only remaining active cemetery in Manhattan.&lt;ref name=nyt150206/&gt;&lt;ref name=Koch&gt;{{cite news|url=http://episcopaldigitalnetwork.com/ens/2013/02/04/new-york-mayor-ed-koch-laid-to-rest-in-trinity-plot/|title=Former New York Mayor Ed Koch laid to rest in Trinity plot|author=Mary Frances Schjonberg|date=February 4, 2013|work=Episcopal News Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two bronze plaques at the Church of the Intercession cemetery commemorating the [[Battle of Fort Washington]], which included some of the fiercest fighting of the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]].
