'''Access to public information''' and '''[[freedom of information]] (FOI)''' refer to the right of access to information held by public bodies also known as "right to know". Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' accountability, boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right of access to public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/freedom-of-expression/freedom-of-information Freedom of Information, UNESCO. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-16}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

Access to Public Information in [[Bulgaria]] is a right guaranteed by the 1991 Constitution. It is regulated by the '''Access to Public Information Act''' first introduced in 2000 and amended in December 2015. The amendments enhanced [[proactive disclosure]], encouraged electronic requests and facilitate re-use of information, in line with [[Directive 2013/37/EU on the Re-Use of Public Sector Information]].

==Background==

In 2014, a public consultation on the amendments to be introduced in the access to information legislation was initiated. In the Summer of 2014, a working group was set up at the Ministry of Transport Information Technologies and Communications with the mandate of drafting amendments to the Bulgarian legislation regarding the introduction of the revised Directive 2013/37/EU on the Re-use of Public Sector Information of the [[European Parliament]] and the [[Council of the European Union|Council]] of 26 June 2013. The amended Directive enlarged the scope of the re-use of public sector information by including archives, libraries and museums.&lt;ref name=AIP&gt;{{cite book|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|date=2015 |title=Access to public information in Bulgaria 2014 |url=http://store.aip-bg.org/publications/ann_rep_eng/2014.pdf |location=Sofia|publisher=Access to Information Programme |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initiative of amending the Bulgarian law on access to public information was also prepared in the framework of drafting and discussing the National Plan under the [[Open Government Partnership]] initiative.&lt;ref name=AIP/&gt;

In November 2015, the Bulgarian National Assembly adopted amendments to the Access to Public Information Act to enhance proactive disclosure, encourage electronic requests and facilitate re-use of information.&lt;ref name=Freedominfo&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freedominfo.org/2015/12/bulgarian-assembly-amends-access-to-information-act/ |title=Bulgarian Assembly Amends Access to Information Act  |last= |first= |date=16 December 2015 |website=Freedominfo.org |publisher=Freedominfo.org. The global network of freedom of information advocates |access-date=8 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Professor Georgi Lozanov, a former member of the Council for Electronic Media, the introduction of the Access to Information Law could help in making more transparent the media sector, in particular [[transparency of media ownership in Bulgaria|media ownership]] and sources of funds which are largely opaque in Bulgaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www3.mirovni-institut.si/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/media-ownership-and-its-impact-on-media-independence-and-pluralism.pdf|title=Media Ownership and its Impact on Media Independence and Pluralism|last=Petković|first=Brankica|publisher=Peace Institute, Institute for Contemporary Social and Political Studies|year=2004|isbn=961-6455-26-5|location=Ljubljana,|pages=94|chapter=Bulgaria}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal Framework==

===Constitution===
Article 41 of the Bulgarian Constitution of 1991 states that everyone shall be entitled to seek, receive and impart information, provided that this right shall not be exercised to the detriment of national security, public order, public health and morality. Article 41 entitles citizens to obtain information from state bodies and agencies on any matter of legitimate public interest which is not a state or other secret prescribed by law and does not affect the rights of other.&lt;ref name=Freedominfo2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freedominfo.org/regions/europe/bulgaria/bulgaria/  |title=Bulgaria: Freedom of Information. Overview |last= |first= |date=16 December 2015 |website=Freedominfo.org |publisher=Freedominfo.org. The global network of freedom of information advocates |access-date=8 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Access to Public Information Act===
In Bulgaria access to public information is regulated by the '''Access to Public Information Act''' enacted in 2000, and amended in 2008 and 2015.&lt;ref name=Freedominfo2/&gt; The Law entitles any person or legal entity to the right of access to public information in any form held by state institutions and other entities financed by state budget and exercising public functions.&lt;ref name=Freedominfo2/&gt;

===2015 amendments to the law regulating access to public information===
The amended legal framework on access to public information introduced an extended the list of categories of information which are subject to [[proactive disclosure]]. Also, amendments introduced an explicit duty to publish any information that have been provided on requests more than three times, along with a broader obligation to publish online information of public interest.&lt;ref name=Freedominfo/&gt;

The amendments also aimed at encouraging the submission of electronic requests, which can be sent with no need of electronic signature.&lt;ref name=Freedominfo/&gt;

Another novelty concerns the presumption of third-party consent, meaning that if a public authority asks for a third-party consent for the disclosure of requested information affecting it, the lack of response within 14 days will be presumed as consent and the information should be completely provided, Thanks to the amendment, thus, the requested information is not considered, as it was before the amendment, a dissent by the third party which obliged the public body to provide only partial access.&lt;ref name=Freedominfo/&gt;

The amendments also introduced the Directive 2013/37/UE, revising the first [[Directive on the re-use of public sector information|Directive on the Re-Use of Public Sector Information]] (2003) which was transposed in 2007 in the access to Public Information Act. In line with the revised directive, the amended law extended the re-use regime by prohibiting any exclusive clauses in giving rights to use whole databases coherently with the Directive provision that obliges any public body in the EU to provide equal availability of such databases on equal conditions and with costs for accessing calculated in transparent way.&lt;ref name=Freedominfo/&gt;

The new legal framework adopts a broader definition of the "public law organizations" that are subject to both access to information requests and information re-use. Libraries, museums and archives have been included among the institutions that have to disclose information for re-use. According to the amended law, public sector bodies are obliged to make their documents available in a user-friendly manner and in open and machine-readable format, together with their metadata in a government [[Open Data Portal]].&lt;ref name=Freedominfo/&gt;

==Main provisions under the Access to Information Law==

Under the Bulgarian law on Access to Public Information, all state bodies, including their directorates/regional/local offices/territorial units, etc. are subject to access to information. Also, the law applies to local government authorities, including mayors and municipal councils. Moreover, other entities are subject to the access to information law, in particular all authorities which perform public functions prescribed by the law, named "public law entities", for instance the Electronic Media Council, the National Health Insurance Fund and the like, and individuals and legal entities financed with funds from the state budget or the [[European Union]] (both subsidies and EU projects and programmes).&lt;ref name=FAQ&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aip-bg.org/en/cases/FAQ/  |title=Frequently Asked Questions |last= |first= |date= |website=Aip-bg.bg |publisher=Access to Information Programme |access-date=8 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The law applies to any information generated or held by state authorities, local authorities and other entities obliged under the law. The right of access to public information is restricted in case of information:

* which are classified as state or official secrete;
* which relates to negotiations and to the preparatory work of an act;
* which affects third party's interests (trade secret and personal data);
* which access has been granted to the requester within the preceding six months.

However, according to the law, even if there is a reason for refusal, information shall be disclosed if there is an overriding public interest which disclosure contributes to enhance.&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt;

Information requests may be submitted either orally or in written form. According to the law, each authority is obliged to appoint  for its office an official with the responsibility of handling the requests.&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt;

In line with international best practices, access to information in Bulgaria is free of charge. Paying a fee can only be required to cover the actual costs of reproducing the document (copies, prints, etc.)&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt;

Under the Bulgarian law, in case requesters do not receive the information sought they may appeal to the court.&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt; The law does not establish an institution in charge of overseeing the implementation of the law in access to public information.&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt;

==Access to public information in practice==

According to a study conducted by the NGO Access to Information Program (AIP) in 2015, every third institution in Bulgaria does not make public its regulatory acts and half of them do not do this with regard to the general administrative acts. Among the institutions which fail to publish their regulatory acts there are the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and many municipalities.&lt;ref name=OBCT&gt; {{cite web |url=http://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Areas/Bulgaria/Bulgaria-every-third-institution-is-not-trasparent-177497 |title=Bulgaria: every third institution is not transparent|last=Yordanova|first=Tsvetelina |date=9 February 2017 |website=Balcanicaucaso.org |publisher=Osservatorio Balcani Caucaso Transeuropa |access-date=9 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study also finds out there is a bit more transparency in relation to the publication of databases and registers. The same holds good for the publication of programs and strategic documents, such as development strategies, and the like.&lt;ref name=OBCT/&gt;

As for financial transparency, the report acknowledges an improvement since 2013, but still about half of the institutions do not publish their budgets on the Internet as required by the law.&lt;ref name=OBCT/&gt;A good level of transparency has been registered on disclosure of information for public procurement tenders: 94% of institutions scrutinized by the AIP has a dedicated section on their websites.&lt;ref name=OBCT/&gt;

The report found out that Bulgarian institutions do not comply with the new requirements of the Access to Public Information Act when it establishes that they are obliged to publish the information that they have provided to citizens more than three times on the grouds of freedom of information applications.&lt;ref name=OBCT/&gt; According to the AIP survey, only 4% out of 565 institutions scrutinized had complied with this requirement at the time the survey was conducted during 2015.&lt;ref name=OBCT/&gt; However, almost all institutions, around 97%, complied with the new requirement that introduced electronic applications for freedom of information requests.&lt;ref name=OBCT/&gt;

The 2015 AIP survey revealed that the Ministry of Education and Science is the most transparent ministry in Bulgaria, while the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is the least transparent.&lt;ref name=OBCT/&gt;

The '''Air Navigation and Transport Act''' is an [[Act of Parliament]] of the [[United Kingdom Parliament]] in 1920 which gave the [[British Empire]] the authority to control [[air navigation]] in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth countries and territories]]. It also put into effect the [[International Commission for Air Navigation]] (ICAN).&lt;ref name="awmp1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airwaysmuseum.com/Creation%20of%20the%20CAB%20part%201.htm|title=The Creation of the Civil Aviation Branch and its Early Years|publisher=Airways Museum|author=Roger Meyer|accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the Act==
The first attempts at international regulation of air navigation were made in 1910 in [[Paris]], when representatives of 19 European countries attended an International Air Conference. The meeting was abandoned when agreement on the contents could not be reached. At a peace conference after [[World War I]] the regulation of air navigation was once again discussed. Because of the advances made in [[aviation]] during the war, all attending members agreed to hold an International Conference to draw up rules and international regulations for air traffic.&lt;ref name="awmp1" /&gt;

On 25 February 1919, an Air Traffic Committee, of 36 states in the [[British Empire]] under the Council of Defence met for the first time. [[Paris Convention of 1919|The Paris Convention]] was signed on 13 October 1919, by all attending representatives of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth states]].&lt;ref name="awmp1" /&gt;

[[James Gordon Legge|Major General Legge]], Chairman of the Committee, noted that "''there should be only one regulatory air authority for Australia, working under a single legislature.''" At a Premiers’ Conference in May 1920 the Australian [[Prime Minister]] [[Billy Hughes|W.M. Hughes]]'s recommendation that "''each State should refer to the Commonwealth the control of air navigation, but in a way as to reserve to the States the right to own and use aircraft for the purpose of government departments and the police powers of the State''" was carried, and the Commonwealth passed the ''Air Navigation Act'' in the widest possible terms.&lt;ref name="awmp1" /&gt;

The ''Air Navigation Act of 1920'' was granted assent on 2 December 1920, gazetted on 11 February 1921, came into force on 28 March 1921 and became law on 28 June 1921. Regulations under the Act provided for the registration of aircraft, licensing of aerodromes, licensing of personnel, periodic inspection and maintenance of aircraft, and rules of the air.&lt;ref name="awmp1" /&gt;

The '''Algerian nationality law''' was first enacted in March 1963 after [[Algeria]] had achieved independence from France in July 1962.

==Religious restrictions==
The law granted citizenship only to [[Muslims]], requiring that only those individuals whose father and paternal grandfather had Muslim personal status could become citizens of the new state.&lt;ref&gt;''Algerian Nationality Code'', Law no. 63-69 of March 27, 1963, section 34&lt;/ref&gt; Before independence, Muslims had been considered indigenous under a special set of laws known as [[Indigénat|''Code de l'indigénat'']] and were not eligible to French citizenship and in practice had an inferior legal status, but Christian and Jewish inhabitants of Algeria during the French colonial period could acquire French citizenship.

A nationality law of 1970 removed references to religious status,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,LEGAL,,LEGISLATION,DZA,,3ae6b4d714,0.html Law No. 1970-86, 15 December 1970, Nationality Law]&lt;/ref&gt; but granted citizenship to children based on the existing nationality of the parents, resulting in the Muslim status of the parents under the 1963 nationality law being carried to their offspring under the 1970 law. 

==Discrimination against women==
However, the new law granted citizenship to children based on the existing nationality of the parents, resulting in the previous Muslim status of the parents being applicable to their offspring. The 1970 Nationality Code did not permit women to pass nationality to their children unless the father was unknown or stateless. Only men had right to confer nationality to foreign spouses. 

Algeria became a party to the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] (CEDAW) in 1996, subject to a reservation to CEDAW Article 9(2). Following advocacy by women's rights organizations demanding equal nationality rights for women, a new Nationality Code was enacted on 27 February 2005.&lt;ref name=54f8377d4&gt;UNHCR: [http://www.refworld.org/pdfid/54f8377d4.pdf Removing Gender Discrimination from Nationality Laws]&lt;/ref&gt; Nationality by descent is now granted to a child whose father or mother is an Algerian national. The 2005 reforms grant women and men equal rights to pass nationality to their children and spouses. The revised Code is retroactive. As a result, individuals born to Algerian mothers and foreign fathers before the reform are also considered nationals. Algeria subsequently lifted its reservation to CEDAW Article 9(2) in 2009.

==Naturalisation==
Nationality by birth in the territory, rather than by descent, is not granted to children unless their parents are unknown (Article 7). Nationality by naturalisation is possible but the criteria are very vague and subject to ministerial discretion (Articles 10, 11 and 26).

==Dual citizenship==
Algeria allows dual citizenship.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3629">'''Animal protectionism''' is a position within [[animal rights]] theory that favors incremental change in pursuit of non-human animal interests. It is contrasted with [[Abolitionism (animal rights)|abolitionism]], the position that human beings have no moral right to use animals, and ought to have no legal right, no matter how the animals are treated.&lt;ref name=intro&gt;Introduction, Francione and Garner 2010, pp. x–xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Animal protectionists agree with abolitionists that the [[animal welfare]] model of animal protection—whereby animals may be used as food, clothing, entertainment and in experiments so long as their suffering is regulated—has failed ethically and politically, but argue that its philosophy can be reformulated. [[Robert Garner]] of the University of Leicester, a leading academic protectionist, argues that animal use may in some circumstances be justified, though it should be better regulated, and that the pursuit of better treatment and incremental change is consistent with holding an abolitionist ideology. [[Gary Francione]], professor of law at Rutgers School of Law-Newark and a leading abolitionist, calls this approach "new welfarism." He regards it as counter-productive because it wrongly persuades the public that the animals they use are being treated kindly, and that continued use is therefore justifiable.&lt;ref name=intro/&gt; Francione regards the abolitionist position as the only one that can properly be called [[animal rights]].&lt;ref&gt;Francione, Gary. "The Abolition of Animal Exploitation," in Francione and Garner 2010, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;
__TOC__

==Arguments==
One of the arguments put forward by [[Abolitionism (animal rights)|abolitionists]] against protectionism is that small improvements in animal welfare serve to salve consciences by persuading the public that their use of animals is not unethical. Welfare reform can therefore be counter-productive. Abolitionists also argue that real reform is invariably unsuccessful, because industries that depend on animal use will not implement change that harms their profit margin. That is, the property status of animals prohibits reform that will harm their owners' interests. For that reason, abolitionists argue, it is the property status of animals that must be removed.&lt;ref&gt;Garner, Robert. "A Defense of a Broad Animal Protectionism," in Francione and Garner 2010, pp. 120–121.&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Garner argues against this that welfare reform is not simply a staging post on the way to abolition, but is in itself desirable. An approach that is based on the right of animals not to suffer could, in theory, be satisfied with a welfare system in which animal suffering, if not animal use, was minimized, though he concedes that this is unlikely. He also argues that Francione has not shown that improvements in welfare persuade the public that all is well. Rather, he argues, reform has the effect of raising public consciousness about the interests of animals.&lt;ref&gt;Garner 2010, pp. 122–123.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Can't see where she says this: Lisa Kemmerer argues that animal protectionism is, more broadly, "any ideology or behavior intended to protect nonhuman animals from human beings".&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Kemmerer. ''In Search of Consistency: Ethics And Animals''. Leiden: Brill, 2006, pp. xvi, 542.&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

'''''Brulotte v. Thys Co.''''', 379 U.S. 29 (1964),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Brulotte v. Thys Co.|volume=379|page=29|pin=|year=1964}}. {{usgovpd}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a 1964 decision of the [[United States Supreme Court]] holding that a contract calling for payment of patent royalties after the expiration of the licensed patent was [[Patent misuse|misuse of the patent right]] and unenforceable under the [[Supremacy Clause]], state contract law notwithstanding. The decision was widely subjected to academic criticism but the Supreme Court has rejected that criticism and reaffirmed the ''Brulotte'' decision in ''[[Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment, LLC]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment, LLC|volume=576|year=2015|docket=13-720}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

[[File:Thys's Patented Machine.gif|thumb|250px|right|Patented hops-picking machine of Thys]]

Thys owned patents on hop-picking machinery. He sold a machine to Brulotte, a farmer in Washington, for $3000 and granted him a license to use the machine for a minimum royalty of $500 for each hop-picking season or $3.33 per 200 pounds of hops harvested by the machine, whichever was greater. The license had no termination date. Of the seven patents covering the machine, the last expired by 1957. Brulotte failed to pay the royalties and Thys sued him for breach of contract in Washington State court.&lt;ref&gt;379 U.S. at 29-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial court rendered judgment for Thys and the Supreme Court of Washington affirmed.&lt;ref&gt;62 Wash. 2d 284, 382 P.2d 271 (1963).&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court of Washington held that in the present case the period during which royalties were required, even though beyond the expiry of the patents, was only "a reasonable amount of time over which to spread the payments for the use of the patent[s]."&lt;ref&gt;62 Wash. 2d, at 291, 382 P. 2d, at 275.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ruling of Supreme Court==

The Supreme Court reversed (8-1) in an opinion written for the Court by Justice [[William O. Douglas]]. Justice [[John Marshall Harlan II]] dissented.

===Majority opinion===

[[File:williamodouglas.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Justice William O. Douglas]]

Justice Douglas began the majority opinion by citing precedents holding that patent "rights become public property once the 17-year period expires."&lt;ref name=Brulotte31&gt;379 U.S. at 31.&lt;/ref&gt; He then quoted Chief Justice Stone, speaking for the Court in ''Scott Paper Co. v. Marcalus Co.'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;. . . any attempted reservation or continuation in the patentee or those claiming under him of the patent monopoly, after the patent expires, whatever the legal device employed, runs counter to the policy and purpose of the patent laws.&lt;ref&gt;''Scott'', 326 U.S. 249, 256 (1946).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Court rejected the claim that the contract merely spread the payment for using the patent over a longer period. The payments were clearly proportioned to the extent of use after the patents expired: "The royalty payments due for the post-expiration period are by their terms for use during that period, and are not deferred payments for use during the pre-expiration period."&lt;ref name=Brulotte31/&gt; Thys "was using the licenses to project its monopoly beyond the patent period." Because the license made no distinction between the pre- and post-expiration period, the contracts were "on their face a bald attempt to exact the same terms and conditions for the period after the patents have expired as they do for the monopoly period," contrary to patent policy. That made them unenforceable.&lt;ref&gt;379 U.S. at 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court therefore ruled:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
n light of those considerations, we conclude that a patentee's use of a royalty agreement that projects beyond the expiration date of the patent is unlawful per se. If that device were available to patentees, the free market visualized for the post-expiration period would be subject to monopoly influences that have no proper place there.

. . . A patent empowers the owner to exact royalties as high as he can negotiate with the leverage of that monopoly. But to use that leverage to project those royalty payments beyond the life of the patent is analogous to an effort to enlarge the monopoly of the patent by tieing the sale or use of the patented article to the purchase or use of unpatented ones. The exaction of royalties for use of a machine after the patent has expired is an assertion of monopoly power in the post-expiration period when, as we have seen, the patent has entered the public domain. .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. [A]fter expiration of the last of the patents incorporated in the machines "the grant of patent monopoly was spent" and .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. an attempt to project it into another term by continuation of the licensing agreement is unenforceable.&lt;ref&gt;379 U.S. at 32-34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Dissent===

Justice Harlan disagreed: " I think that more discriminating analysis than the Court has seen fit to give this case produces a different result."&lt;ref&gt;379 U.S. at 34.&lt;/ref&gt; In his analysis, what Thys did was no more objectionable than restrictions on the machine rather than the patented idea that it embodied. "In fact Thys sells both a machine and the use of an idea. The company should be free to restrict the use of its machine."&lt;ref&gt;379 U.S. at 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent developments==

===Reaffirmance===

Despite criticism of ''Brulotte'' (see next section), the Supreme Court reaffirmed the decision in ''[[Kimble v. Marvel]]'' in 2015.

===Criticism===

The decision was widely criticized by academics and economic theorists. In a subsequent opinion, 50 years later, nonetheless affirming ''Brulotte'', the Supreme Court listed some of the criticism suggesting that the case should be overruled:&lt;ref&gt;''[[Kimble v. Marvel]]'', 561 U.S. —, - n.3 (2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Scheiber v. Dolby Labs., Inc.'', 293 F. 3d 1014, 1017–1018 (CA7 2002) (Posner, J.) (Brulotte has been "severely, and as it seems to us, with all due respect, justly criticized . . . . However, we have no authority to overrule a Supreme Court decision no matter how dubiousits reasoning strikes us, or even how out of touch with the SupremeCourt’s current thinking the decision seems")
* Ayres &amp; Klemperer, ''Limiting Patentees’ Market Power Without Reducing Innovation Incentives: The Perverse Benefits of Uncertainty and Non-Injunctive Remedies'', 97 {{smallcaps|Mich. L. Rev.}} 985, 1027 (1999) ("Our analysis .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. suggests that Brulotte should be overruled").

Other criticism of ''Brulotte'' includes the following:

* Harold See and Frank M. Caprio, ''The Trouble with Brulotte: The Patent Royalty Term and Patent Monopoly Extension'', 1990 Utah L. Rev. 813 (1990).
* Note, ''Patents: Supreme Court Holds Post-Expiration Royalty Agreements Unlawful Per Se'', 1965 {{smallcaps|Duke}} L.J. 836, 841 (1965) ("Thus, the ambiguity in ''Brulotte'', so long as it remains unresolved, may greatly limit marketing available to [patentees].").
* Paul Goldstein, ''Federal System Ordering of the Copyright Interest'', 69 {{smallcaps|Colum. L. Rev.}} 49, 70 (1969) (" In the presence of only the most attenuated federal interest, and absent any generalized public concern, the ''Brulotte'' rule gives to the federal courts a broad and probably illegitimate supervisory power over state administration of private contracts.").
* Richard A. Posner. ''Transaction Costs and Antitrust Concerns in the Licensing of Intellectual Property'', 4 J. Marshall Rev. Intell. Prop. L. 325, 332 (2005) ("''Brulotte'' does not reflect the Supreme Court's current thinking about competition and monopoly, but it will continue to bind the lower courts until the Supreme Court decides to overrule it.").

Other commentators, however, have rejected adoption of an antitrust lens for analysis of patent misuse:

* Robin C. Feldman, [http://repository.uchastings.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1161&amp;context=faculty_scholarship ''The Insufficiency of Antitrust Analysis for Patent Misuse''], 55 {{smallcaps|Hastings}} L.J. 399, 422 (2003) ("the antitrust rule of reason focuses on one particular issue: the impact on competition, rather than all possible equitable considerations" relevant to patent policy); ''id''. at 448 ("A behavior that retards the progress of science would be of concern to patent policy" but antitrust tests are not attuned to this type of problem.")
* Marshall Leaffer, [http://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1833&amp;context=facpub ''Patent Misuse and Innovation''], 10 J. {{smallcaps|High Tech.}} L. 142, 148 (2010) ("patent misuse should transcend the contours of traditional antitrust law and should concern itself with policy of patent law and the effect on innovation").

[[File:CITIZENS FOR RESPONSIBILITY AND ETHICS IN WASHINGTON v. DONALD J. TRUMP.pdf|thumb|CREW v. Trump complaint]]
'''''Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington v. Trump''''', No. 1:17-cv-00458 (S.D.N.Y. 2017), was a case before the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]]. The plaintiffs, the watchdog group [[Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington]] (CREW), hotel and restaurant owner Eric Goode, an association of restaurants known as ROC United, and an [[Embassy Row]] hotel event booker named Jill Phaneuf allege that the defendant, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Donald Trump]], is in violation of the [[Foreign Emoluments Clause]], a [[United States Constitution|constitutional]] provision that bars the president or any other federal official from taking gifts or payments from foreign governments. CREW filed its [[complaint]] on January 23, 2017, shortly after Trump was [[Inauguration of Donald Trump|inaugurated as president]]. An amended complaint, adding the hotel and restaurant industry plaintiffs, was filed on April 18, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/18/lawsuit-against-trump-over-foreign-payments-expands.html|title=Lawsuit accusing Trump of violating the Constitution just expanded|date=2017-04-18|agency=Reuters|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2017-04-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170421030442/http://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/18/lawsuit-against-trump-over-foreign-payments-expands.html}} {{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/us/politics/trump-crew-lawsuit-constitution.html|title=Watchdog Group Expands Lawsuit Against Trump|date=2017-04-18|last1=LaFraniere|first1=Sharon|newspaper=New York Times|access-date=2017-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second amended complaint was filed on May 10, 2017.&lt;ref name="CREW201705"&gt;{{cite press release|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|url=https://www.citizensforethics.org/press-release/crew-v-trump-adds-new-plaintiff/|title=CREW v.

== Background ==
Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington stated that because Trump-owned buildings take in rent, room rentals and other payments from foreign governments, the president has breached the Foreign Emoluments Clause. The Constitution says that "no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under the United States, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State."&lt;ref name="FahrentholdJan22"/&gt;. The case also includes a claim under the Domestic Emoluments Clause.

An Emoluments Clause lawsuit directed at a sitting President has never been tested in court, and there is little judicial precedent in this area of constitutional law. The Clause is, however, the subject of a considerable body of precedent from the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel and the Office of the Comptroller General. The plaintiffs are asking for an injunction and declaratory judgment directed at President Trump requiring that he cease violations of the Emoluments Clauses. On January 23, 2017, after the action was filed in U.S. District Court, Trump rejected the arguments underlying the lawsuit as "Without merit," and "Totally without merit" during his morning press conference at the White House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.citizensforethics.org/press-release/17451/|title=[UPDATE] CREW Sues Trump Over Emoluments |publisher=Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington|date=January 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Riback"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/23/why-trumps-business-conflicts-cant-and-wont-just-be-swept-aside-commentary.html|title=Why Trump’s business conflicts can’t—and won’t—just be swept aside|author=Chris Riback|date=January 23, 2017|publisher=CNBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tribe]] of Harvard Law School; Supreme Court litigator [[Deepak Gupta (attorney)|Deepak Gupta]] of Gupta Wessler PLLC; [[Erwin Chemerinsky]], the dean of the [[University of California, Berkeley School of Law]]; [[Richard Painter]], law professor at the University of Minnesota and chief ethics lawyer in the George W.

{{Islamism sidebar|Concepts}}
The '''Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam''' ('''CDHRI''') is a declaration of the member states of the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] adopted in [[Cairo]], Egypt, on 5 August 1990,&lt;ref name = Brems&gt;{{cite book | last = Brems | first = E | isbn = 90-411-1618-4 | title = Human rights: universality and diversity: Volume 66 of International studies in human rights | publisher = Martinus Nijhoff Publishers | year = 2001 | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=INlkqsHpIFEC&amp;pg=PA241 241–84] | chapter = Islamic Declarations of Human Rights }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Conference of [[Foreign Minister]]s, 9–14 [[Muharram]] 1411H in the [[Islamic calendar]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/instree/cairodeclaration.html University of Minnesota, Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam]&lt;/ref&gt;) which provides an overview on the Islamic perspective on [[human rights]], and affirms [[Islamic]] [[sharia]] as its sole source. CDHRI declares its purpose to be "general guidance for Member States [of the OIC] in the field of human rights".

This declaration is widely acknowledged as an Islamic response to the [[United Nations]]'s [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR), adopted in 1948. It guarantees many of the same rights as the UDHR and serves as a living document of human rights guidelines prescribed for all members of the [[Organization of Islamic Cooperation|OIC]] (Organization of Islamic Cooperation) to follow, but restricts them explicitly to the limits set by the [[sharia]]. This greatly restricts rights with respect to the Universal Declaration, since for example, women and members of other religions do not have the same rights as men under sharia, and that [[freedom of expression]] can be severely limited for religious reasons: for example, [[blasphemy]] can even now be punishable by death, in clear opposition to the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].

==History==
Various [[Muslim countries]] had criticized the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights for its failure to take into account the cultural and religious context of non-[[Western world|Western]] countries.&lt;ref&gt;National Review Online, [http://www.nationalreview.com/article/205577/human-rights-and-human-wrongs-david-g-littman Human Rights and Human Wrongs], David G. Littman, January 19, 2003, retrieved 30 May, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, Said Rajaie-Khorassani—the post-[[Iranian Revolution|revolutionary]] Iranian representative to the UN—articulated the position of his country regarding the UDHR, by saying that it was a [[Moral relativism|relativistic]] "[[Secularism|secular]] understanding of the [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition", which could not be implemented by Muslims without trespassing Islamic law.&lt;ref name="Midstream"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/205577/human-rights-and-human-wrongs/david-g-littman|title=Universal Human Rights and 'Human Rights in Islam'|publisher='Midstream'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CDHRI was adopted in 1990 by members of the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|Organisation of the Islamic Conference]]. It has been signed by 45 states so far.&lt;ref&gt;Anver M. Emon, Mark Ellis, Benjamin Glahn: [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y3hpAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA113 Islamic Law and International Human Rights Law] p. 113. Oxford University Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the CDHRI was presented to the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]], where it was strongly condemned by the [[International Commission of Jurists]].

==Contents==
The Declaration starts {{Citation needed|reason=A cursory glance at the source reveals that the document does not start with this sentence, but in fact begins by saying "All human beings form one family whose members are united by their subordination to Allah and descent from Adam."|date=June 2017}} by saying "All human beings form one family whose members are united by their subordination to Allah and descent from Adam." and it forbids "discrimination on the basis of [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[Skin colour|colour]], [[language]], [[belief]], [[sex]], [[religion]], [[political affiliation]], [[social status]] or other considerations". It goes on to proclaim the [[sanctity of life]], and declares the "preservation of human life" to be "a duty prescribed by the [[Shariah]]". The CDHRI also guarantees non-belligerents—such as old men, [[women and children]], the wounded and sick, and [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]]—the [[right to food]], shelter, and access to safety and medical treatment in times of war.

The CDHRI affords women "equal human dignity", "own rights to enjoy", "duties to perform", "own civil entity", "financial independence", and the "right to retain her name and lineage". Both men and women are given the "right to marriage" regardless of their race, colour, or nationality. The Declaration makes it incumbent upon both parents to protect the child, both before and after birth, while stressing that the [[Gender roles in Islam|husband is responsible]] for the social and financial protection of his family, including any children and wives. 

The Declaration recognises the [[Right to property|rights to property]] and [[right to privacy|privacy]] for the individuals.&lt;ref name="RuleGreenleaf2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rule|first1=James B.|last2=Greenleaf|first2=G.

It is not permitted to spy on him, to place him under surveillance or to besmirch his good name. The State shall protect him from arbitrary interference".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/cairodeclaration.html |title=University of Minnesota Human Rights Library |publisher=[[University of Minnesota]] |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It forbids the [[demolition]] and [[confiscation]] of any family's residence and the [[eviction]] of the family.&lt;ref name="Baderin2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Baderin|first=Mashood A.|title=International Human Rights and Islamic Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RHRCAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP141|date=11 September 2003|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-102182-4|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, should the family get separated in times of [[Islam and war|war]], it is the responsibility of the [[Sovereign state|state]] to "arrange visits or reunions of families".

Article 10 of the Declaration states: "Islam is the religion of unspoiled nature. It is [[Haram|prohibited]] to exercise any form of [[Al-Baqara 256|compulsion]] on man or to exploit his [[Islam and poverty|poverty]] or ignorance in order to convert him to another religion or to [[Atheism and Islam|atheism]]." Since in Islamic society all reasons for conversion away from Islam are considered to be essentially{{by whom|date=February 2018}} either compulsion or ignorance, this effectively forbids conversion away from Islam.

The Declaration protects each individual from [[Arbitrary arrest and detention|arbitrary arrest]], [[torture]], maltreatment, or indignity. Furthermore, no individual is to be used for medical or scientific experiments without his consent or at the risk of his health or of his life. It also prohibits the taking of hostages of any individual "for any purpose whatsoever". Moreover, the CDHRI guarantees the [[presumption of innocence]]; guilt is only to be proven through a trial in "which he [the defendant] shall be given all the guarantees of defence". The Declaration also forbids the promulgation of "emergency laws that would provide executive authority for such actions". Article 19 stipulates that there are no other crimes or punishments than [[Hudud#Punishments|those mentioned in the sharia]]. Sharia allows [[corporal punishment]] (whipping, amputation) and [[capital punishment]] by [[Stoning#In Islam|stoning]] or [[Beheading in Islam|decapitation]].&lt;ref&gt;There shall be no crime or punishment except as provided for in the Schari’a.&lt;/ref&gt; The right to hold public office can only be exercised in accordance with the sharia.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2003), p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;

The Declaration also emphasizes the "full right to freedom and self-determination", and its opposition to [[Slavery in Islam|enslavement]], oppression, [[exploitation of labour|exploitation]], and [[Muslim conquests|colonialism]]. The CDHRI declares the [[rule of law]], establishing "equality and justice for all", [[Fiqh|with the limitations provided under Islamic law]]. The CDHRI also guarantees all individuals the "right to participate, directly or indirectly in the administration of his country's public affairs". The CDHRI also forbids any abuse of authority "subject to the Islamic Shariah."

Article 22(a) of the Declaration states that "Everyone shall have the right to [[Freedom of speech|express his opinion freely]] in such manner as would not be [[Sharia#Freedom of speech|contrary to the principles of the Shariah]]." Article 22(b) states that "Everyone shall have the right to advocate what is right, and propagate what is good, and warn against what is wrong and evil according to the norms of Islamic Shariah." Article 22(c) states: "Information is a vital necessity to society. It may not be exploited or misused in such a way as may violate sanctities and the dignity of Prophets, undermine moral and ethical values or disintegrate, corrupt or harm society, or weaken its faith." This is an explicit restriction on the freedom to make any statement which might be considered blasphemous, the penalty for the making of which might be death and as such the wording of this clause allows the death penalty for blasphemy in clear contravention of the UDHR.     Article 22(d) states that "It is not permitted to arouse nationalistic or doctrinal hatred or to do anything that may be an incitement to any form of racial discrimination."

===Religious features===
{{further information|Human rights in the Quran}}
Although the CDHRI uses a [[Universalism|universalist]] language akin to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, "quite a number of [its] features express an Islamic particularity."&lt;ref name = Brems/&gt; The [[preamble]] is mostly religious [[rhetoric]], and the particulars of the CDHRI contain numerous references to the [[Quran]], sharia, and aspects of the Islamic faith that appear on no other similar international list.&lt;ref name = Brems/&gt; The CDHRI concludes in Articles 24 and 25 that all rights and freedoms mentioned are subject to the Islamic sharia, which is the declaration's sole source.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/cairodeclaration.html Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam, Aug. 5, 1990, U.N. GAOR], World Conf. on Hum. Rts., 4th Sess., Agenda Item 5, U.N. Doc.
A/CONF.157/PC/62/Add.18 (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; The CDHRI declares true religion to be the "guarantee for enhancing such dignity along the path to human [[integrity]]". It also places the responsibility for defending those rights upon the entire [[Ummah]].

==Criticism==
{{See also|Criticism of Sharia law|Human rights in Islamic countries|Application of sharia law by country|Islam and violence}}

The CDHRI has been criticized for being implemented by a set of states with widely disparate religious policies and practices who had "a shared interest in disarming international criticism of their domestic human rights record."&lt;ref name = Brems/&gt;

Article 24 of the declaration states: "All the rights and freedoms stipulated in this Declaration are subject to the Islamic Sharia." Article 19 also says: "There shall be no crime or punishment except as provided for in the Sharia."&lt;ref name="Farouh2002"&gt;{{cite book | last = Kazemi | first = F | chapter = Perspectives on Islam and Civil Society | title = Islamic Political Ethics: Civil Society, Pluralism and Conflict | editors = Hashmi SH | publisher = [[Princeton University Press]] | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-691-11310-6 | page = [https://books.google.com/books?id=5LmXFpnp_bMC&amp;pg=PA50#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 50] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CDHRI has been criticised for failing to guarantee [[freedom of religion]], in particular the right of each and every individual to [[Apostasy in Islam|change their religion]], as a "fundamental and non-derogable right".&lt;ref name="Farouh2002"/&gt; In a joint written statement submitted by the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]] (IHEU), a [[non-governmental organization]] in special [[consultative status]], the Association for World Education (AWE) and the Association of World Citizens (AWC), a number of concerns were raised that the CDHRI limits human rights, religious freedom, and freedom of expression. The statement concludes that "The Cairo Declaration of Human Rights in Islam is clearly an attempt to limit the rights enshrined in the UDHR and the International Covenants. It can in no sense be seen as complementary to the Universal Declaration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iheu.org/node/3162|title=The Cairo Declaration and the Universality of Human Rights|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081031135736/http://www.iheu.org/node/3162|archivedate=2008-10-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2008, in an article to the United Nations, the [[Center for Inquiry]] writes that the CDHRI "undermines equality of persons and freedom of expression and religion by imposing restrictions on nearly every human right based on Islamic Sharia law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centerforinquiry.net/newsroom/cfi_defends_freedom_of_expression_at_the_un_human_rights_council/|title=CFI Defends Freedom of Expression at the U.N. Human Rights Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rhona Smith writes that, because of the CDHRI's reference to Shariah, it implies an inherent degree of superiority of men.&lt;ref name="Smith2003"&gt;Rhona, Smith. ''Textbook on International Human Rights'', Oxford University Press, 2003, {{ISBN|1-84174-301-1}}, p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adama Dieng]]—a member of the [[International Commission of Jurists]]—has also criticised the CDHRI. He argued that the declaration gravely threatens the inter-cultural consensus on which the international human rights instruments are based; that it introduces intolerable discrimination against non-Muslims and women. He further argued that the CDHRI reveals a deliberately restrictive character in regard to certain fundamental rights and freedoms, to the point that certain essential provisions are below the legal standards in effect in a number of Muslim countries; it uses the cover of the "Islamic sharia (Law)" to justify the legitimacy of practices, such as corporal punishment, which attack the integrity and dignity of the human being.&lt;ref name="Midstream"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

In 2009, the journal ''[[Free Inquiry]]'' summarized the criticism of the Cairo Declaration in an editorial: "We are deeply concerned with the changes to the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] by a coalition of Islamic states within the [[United Nations]] that wishes to prohibit any criticism of religion and would thus protect Islam's limited view of human rights. In view of the conditions inside the Islamic Republic of Iran, Egypt, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, the Sudan, Bangdalesh, Iraq, and Afghanistan, we should expect that at the top of their human rights agenda would be to rectify the legal inequality of women, the suppression of political dissent, the curtailment of free expression, the persecution of ethnic minorities and religious dissenters—in short, protecting their citizens from egregious human rights violations. Instead, they are worrying about protecting Islam."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kurtz, [[Austin Dacey]], and Tom Flynn. "Defaming Human Rights". ''[[Free Inquiry]]''. February/March 2009, Vol. 29, No. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3356">The '''Charleston Five''' are five men - '''Kenneth Jefferson''', '''Rick Simmons''', '''Peter Washington''', '''Elijah Ford''', and '''Jason Edgerton''' - who were brought up on [[felony]] charges of [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] to incite a [[riot]] on January 19, 2000 in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], [[South Carolina]].

The Five were longshoremen and [[Trade union|union]] members of Local 1422 of the [[International Longshoremen's Association]]. They were peacefully protesting a [[Denmark|Danish]] freight company's use of non-union workers on the Charleston docks when a fight broke out between [[Picketing (protest)|picketing]] workers and a police force. The Charleston Five were arrested along with four others and were held on felony charges which could have carried a [[prison]] sentence of up to 10 years.

== The Protest==
On 19 January a ship from [[Denmark|Danish]] [[Nordana]]'s shipping Lines docked in the Charleston port and employed 19 non-unionized workers to unload the cargo. This company that had used the services of the [[Charleston Union Labors]] for 23 years had decided to end this association on 1999.
It was the region of the union [[International Longshoremen's Association]] (ILA) local 1422 and they decided to picket against it. With this kind of preparation and continuous provocation by the police, including racist taunts,{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} the picketing longshoremen got in touch with ILA 1422A mechanics union and Locals 1771. By nightfall there were almost 130 longshoremen picketing, though some media suggested the number could have been up to 300. Then as the leadership went ahead to figure out what the intention was, the protesters threw rocks, bottles, and railroad ties at the police.&lt;ref name='labournet'&gt;[http://www.labournet.net/docks2/0110/charls2.htm "South Carolina Attorney General hands over Charleston Case"] Bartleme, Tony.  Charleston Post and Courier (reprint). 11 October 2001.  14 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The police started [[baton charge]], gas shell firing and even charged an armored vehicle at the [[Stevedore|longshoremen]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

==Trial==
The Five's arrests set off a firestorm of political implications and finger pointing and allegedly some South Carolina officials were using the arrests as political fulcrums to further their careers. In October 2001, the case's prosecutor, South Carolina Attorney General [[Charlie Condon]] publicly compared the Charleston Five to the terrorists who had destroyed the twin towers and world trade center the month before.  The backlash from this comment was such that Condon soon removed himself as prosecutor and appointed 1st Circuit Solicitor, [[Walter Bailey (lawyer)|Walter Bailey]] as his replacement.&lt;ref name='labournet'/&gt;

With mounting worldwide protest and international solidarity for the Charleston 5, they were finally freed of all charges in November 2001, after one year of trial, throughout which they were kept under house arrest. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9874">A '''clickwrap''' or '''clickthrough''' [[Contract|agreement]] is a digital prompt that offers individuals the opportunity to accept or decline a digitally-mediated policy.&lt;ref name="SMS"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Obar |first1=Jonathan A. |last2=Oeldorf-Hirsch |first2=Anne |title=The Clickwrap: A Political Economic Mechanism for Manufacturing Consent on Social Media |journal=Social Media + Society |date=2018 |volume=4 |issue=3 |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2056305118784770 |accessdate=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Privacy policies, terms of service and other user policies, as well as copyright policies commonly employ the clickwrap prompt. Clickwraps are common to signup processes for [[social media]] services like [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]] or [[Tumblr]], connections to wireless networks operated in corporate spaces, as part of installation processes of many software packages, or in other circumstances where agreement is sought using digital media.  The name "clickwrap" is derived from the use of "[[shrink wrap contracts]]" commonly used in boxed software purchases, which "contain a notice that by tearing open the [[Shrink wrap|shrinkwrap]], the user assents to the software terms enclosed within".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.murdoch.edu.au/elaw/issues/v9n3/kunkel93_text.html#Shrinkwrap%20License%20Cases_T  Murdoch University Electronic Journal of Law]&lt;/ref&gt;

The content and form of clickwrap agreements vary widely. Most clickwrap agreements require the [[end-user]] to [[wikt:manifest|manifest]] his or her [[wikt:Special:Search/assent|assent]] by clicking an "ok" or "agree" [[Button (computing)|button]] on a [[dialog box]] or pop-up window.  A user indicates [[wikt:rejection|rejection]] by clicking cancel or closing the window.  Upon rejection, the user cannot use or purchase the [[Product (business)|product]] or [[Service (economics)|service]].  Classically, such a take-it-or-leave-it contract was described as a "[[contract of adhesion]], which is a contract that lacks bargaining power, forcing one party to be favored over the other".

The [[terms of service]] or license do not always appear on the same [[webpage]] or window, but are always accessible before acceptance, such as through a [[hyperlink]] embedded in the product's webpage or a pop-up screen prior to installation. In order to be deemed to have accepted the terms of service, the purchaser must be put on notice that certain terms of service may apply. If the terms of service are not visible and/or accessible, courts have found the notice requirement to be lacking and as such, the purchaser may not be bound to the terms of the agreement. An analysis of the terms of service of major consumer websites has found that they frequently contain clauses that impede consumer rights in substantial and often unexpected ways.&lt;ref&gt;A Nicol. [http://www.clickwrapped.com/ Clickwrapped: Who Respects Your Rights Online?] Accessed July 30, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal consequences in the United States==

===Cases===
Few cases have considered the validity of clickwrap licenses.  Still, in the cases that have challenged their validity, the terms of the contract have usually been upheld:
*''Feldman v. Google, Inc.'', 513 F.Supp.2d 229 (E.D.Pa. 2007) (upholding forum-selection clause)
*''In re RealNetworks, Inc. Privacy Litigation'', No. No. 00-1366, 2000 WL 631341 (D. Ill. May 8, 2000) (upholding an arbitration clause)
* ''Hotmail Corp. v. Van$ Money Pie'', No. 98-20064, 1998 WL 388389 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 16, 1998) (granting [[preliminary injunction]] for alleged breach of [[contract]] for violating the [[terms of service]] by using a [[Hotmail]] account to send [[e-mail spam|spam]] or [[pornography]]). The court said that clicking the clickwrap button after notice gave consent.
* ''I. Lan Sys., Inc. v. Netscout Serv. Level Corp.'', 183 F. Supp. 2d 328, 336 (D. Mass. 2002) (upholding a clickwrap agreement on two grounds: first, clickwrap is simply "Money now, terms later" contract formation; second, the court found that the "additional terms" of the clickwrap license was not material under [[Uniform Commercial Code|UCC]] (§207(2)(b)).
*''Caspi v. Microsoft, LLC'', held a forum selection clause in an online membership agreement was consented to when the user clicked the "I agree" symbol of the agreement in order to proceed with registration.
*In ''A.V., et al. v iParadigms, LLC'', Judge Claude M. Hilton granted summary judgment on the students' complaint in favor of iParadigms/[[Turnitin]], because they had accepted the click-wrap agreement on the Turnitin website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hilton|first=Claude|year=2008|title=Memorandum Opinion|url=http://www.iparadigms.com/iParadigms_03-11-08_Opinion.pdf|publisher=United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Alexandria Division|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705110536/http://www.iparadigms.com/iParadigms_03-11-08_Opinion.pdf|archivedate=2010-07-05}}&lt;!-- also found here: http://www.scribd.com/doc/2355720/iParadigms-031108-Opinion --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

However, see ''[[In the Matter of Sears Holdings Management Corporation]]''.

Even though courts have ruled some clickwrap licenses to be enforceable contracts, it does not follow that every term of every clickwrap license is enforceable. Clickwrap licenses must still meet the criteria for enforceability of a unilateral form contract. For example, see ''[[Bragg v. Linden Research, Inc.]]'', 487 F.Supp.2d 593 (E.D. Pa. 2007), in which the judge found certain aspects of the [[Second Life]] clickwrap agreement "unconscionable, and therefore unenforceable."[http://pub.bna.com/eclr/064925_053007.pdf]

===Cases in detail===
In [[Register.com, Inc. v. Verio, Inc.]], 356 F.3d 393 (2d. Cir. 2004), the court described a clickwrap license, even though the license in question was distinguished from a clickwrap license
&lt;blockquote&gt;Essentially, under a clickwrap arrangement, potential licensees are presented with the proposed license terms and forced to expressly and unambiguously manifest either assent or rejection prior to being given access to the product.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An earlier case, ''[[Specht v. Netscape Communications Corp.]]'', 150 F.Supp.2d 585 (S.D.N.Y. 2001), ''aff'd'', 306 F.3d 17 (2d. Cir. 2002), gave perhaps the clearest definition of a clickwrap license.
&lt;blockquote&gt;A click-wrap license presents the user with a message on his or her [[computer screen]], requiring that the user manifest his or her assent to the terms of the license agreement  by clicking on an [[Icon (computing)|icon]]. n12 The product cannot be obtained or used unless and until the icon is clicked. For example, when a user attempts to obtain [[Netscape]]'s Communicator or Navigator, a web page appears containing the full text of the Communicator / Navigator license agreement. Plainly visible on the screen is the query, "Do you accept all the terms of the preceding license agreement? If so, click on the Yes button. If you select No, Setup will close." Below this text are three button or icons: one labeled "Back" and used to return to an earlier step of the [[download]] preparation; one labeled "No," which if clicked, terminates the download; and one labeled "Yes," which if clicked, allows the download to proceed. Unless the user clicks "Yes," indicating his or her assent to the license agreement, the user cannot obtain the [[software]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The clickwrap method was presented to the court in ''[[ProCD v. Zeidenberg]]'', 86 F.3d 1447 (7th Cir. 1996), where Zeidenberg purchased a CD-ROM, created by ProCD, which contained a compilation of a telephone directory database. Upon purchase of this CD-ROM, Zeidenberg installed the software onto his computer then created a website which offered to visitors the information contained on the CD-ROM at a price less than what ProCD charged for the software. Prior to his purchase of the software, Zeidenberg may not have been aware of any prohibited use or dissemination of the product without consent by ProCD. However, upon preparing to install the software onto his computer, the software license appeared on his computer screen and would not allow him to continue with the installation without indicating acceptance by clicking his assent in a dialog box. The court held that Zeidenberg did accept the offer and the terms contained within the license by clicking through the dialog box.  Zeidenberg had the opportunity to read the terms of the license prior to clicking the acceptance box. The court further stated that Zeidenberg could have rejected the terms of the contract and returned the software. (''Id.'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws.lp.findlaw.com/7th/961139.html FindLaw Article]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.loundy.com/CDLB/Zeidenberg.html |title='Shrink-wrap' licenses don't shrink access to data |first=David |last=Loundy |work=Chicago Daily Law Bulletin |date=February 8, 1996 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal consequences in the European Union==
Recently the ECJ decided in the case El Majdoub (case n° C-322/14) that click-wrap agreements are acceptable under certain circumstances as proof of the acceptance of general conditions in the meaning of Regulation 44/2001 (now replaced by Regulation 1215/2012).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4130">{{Politics of Algeria}}
{{update|date=January 2011}}
An '''Algerian Constitution''' was first adopted by a [[Algerian constitutional referendum, 1963|referendum]] in 1963, following the [[Algerian War of Independence]] (1954–62); originally, it was to be drafted by a constitutional assembly led by [[Ferhat Abbas]], but this body was sidelined by Algeria's first [[President of Algeria|President]], [[Ahmed Ben Bella]]. In its 1963 form, the constitution declared Algeria a [[one-party state]] ruled by the former resistance movement, the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]] (FLN). This constitution was suspended by the military [[coup d'état]] of 1965. After years of ruling by executive fiat as leader of the [[Revolutionary Council (Algeria)|Revolutionary Council]], [[Houari Boumédienne]] issued a second constitution in 1976, emphasizing the importance of [[socialism]] and - formally - restoring political institutions to their primacy over the military establishment. (Boumédienne was then elected the country's second president, after having left the post vacant for eleven years.)

In 1986, Boumedienne's successor [[Chadli Bendjedid]] modified the constitution to allow for [[free-market]] reforms, and, after the [[1988 October Riots]], brought in a new constitution in 1988. This was approved in a [[Algerian constitutional referendum, 1989|referendum]] by 73% on 23 February 1989. It introduced a multi-party system, removing the FLN from its role as leading party, and made no mention of [[socialism]]; instead it promised "[[freedom of expression]], [[freedom of association|association]], and [[freedom of assembly|assembly]]". A 1992 military coup introduced a [[state of emergency]], which suspended parts of the new constitution, as the [[Algerian Civil War]] began.

In 1996, the constitution was further modified, allowing the formation of political parties not "founded on a religious, linguistic, racial, sex, corporatist or regional basis" or violating "the fundamental liberties, the fundamental values and components of the national identity, the national unity, the security and integrity of the national territory, the independence of the country and the People’s sovereignty as well as the democratic and republican nature of the State."

A further proposed revision, believed to be intended to remove the presidential term limit (Article 74) to allow the President to run for office indefinitely often, was discussed during 2006 by [[Prime Minister of Algeria|Prime Minister]] [[Abdelaziz Belkhadem]]'s government. This was widely seen to be instigated by President [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]], who had been elected to his second and, constitutionally, final mandate in 2004. Other changes discussed concerned a move towards a [[presidential system]], introducing the post of [[Vice President]] among other things.

In [[economics]], '''contract theory''' studies how economic actors can and do construct contractual arrangements, generally in the presence of [[asymmetric information]]. Because of its connections with both [[agency (law)|agency]] and [[incentive]]s, contract theory is often categorized within a field known as [[Law and economics]].  One prominent application of it is the design of optimal schemes of [[managerial compensation]]. In the field of economics, the first formal treatment of this topic was given by [[Kenneth Arrow]] in the 1960s. In 2016, [[Oliver Hart (economist)|Oliver Hart]] and [[Bengt R. Holmström]] both received the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] for their work on contract theory, covering many topics from CEO pay to [[privatization|privatizations]].

A standard practice in the microeconomics of contract theory is to represent the behaviour of a decision maker under certain numerical utility structures, and then apply an [[optimization algorithm]] to identify optimal decisions. Such a procedure has been used in the contract theory framework to several typical situations, labeled ''[[moral hazard]]'', ''[[adverse selection]]'' and ''[[Signalling (economics)|signalling]]''. The spirit of these models lies in finding theoretical ways to motivate agents to take appropriate actions, even under an insurance contract. The main results achieved through this family of models involve: mathematical properties of the utility structure of the principal and the agent, relaxation of assumptions, and variations of the ''time structure'' of the contract relationship, among others. It is customary to model people as maximizers of some [[Von Neumann–Morgenstern utility theorem|von Neumann–Morgenstern utility functions]], as stated by [[expected utility theory]].

==Main models of agency problems==

===Moral hazard===
In [[moral hazard]] models, the [[information asymmetry]] is the principal's inability to observe and/or verify the agent's action. Performance-based contracts that depend on observable and verifiable output can often be employed to create incentives for the agent to act in the principal's interest.  When agents are risk-averse, however, such contracts are generally only [[Theory of the Second Best|second-best]] because incentivization precludes full insurance.

The typical moral hazard model is formulated as follows.  The principal solves:
:&lt;math&gt;\max_{w(\cdot)} E\left[ y(\hat{e}) - w(y(\hat{e}))\right]&lt;/math&gt;

subject to the agent's "individual rationality (IR)" constraint, 
:&lt;math&gt;E\left[u( w( y(e) ) ) - c(e)\right] \geq \bar{u}&lt;/math&gt;

and the agent's "incentive compatibility (IC)" constraint, 
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{e} = \arg \max_e E \left[ u(w(y(e))) - c(e) \right] \geq \bar{u}&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;w(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is the wage as a function of output &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, which in turn is a function of effort:&lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;c(e)&lt;/math&gt; represents the cost of effort, and reservation utility is given by &lt;math&gt;\bar{u}&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;u(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is the "utility function", which is concave for the risk-averse agent, is convex for the risk-prone agent, and is linear for the risk-neutral agent.

If the agent is risk-neutral and there are no bounds on transfer payments, the fact that the agent's effort is unobservable (i.e., it is a "hidden action") does not pose a problem. In this case, the same outcome can be achieved that would be attained with verifiable effort: The agent chooses the so-called "first-best" effort level that maximizes the expected total surplus of the two parties. Specifically, the principal can give the realized output to the agent, but let the agent make a fixed up-front payment. The agent is then a "residual claimant" and will maximize the expected total surplus minus the fixed payment. Hence, the first-best effort level maximizes the agent's payoff, and the fixed payment can be chosen such that in equilibrium the agent's expected payoff equals his or her reservation utility (which is what the agent would get if no contract was written). Yet, if the agent is risk-averse, there is a trade-off between incentives and insurance. Moreover, if the agent is risk-neutral but wealth-constrained, the agent cannot make the fixed up-front payment to the principal, so the principal must leave a "limited liability rent" to the agent (i.e., the agent earns more than his or her reservation utility).

The moral hazard model with risk aversion was pioneered by Steven Shavell, [[Sanford J. Grossman]], [[Oliver Hart (economist)|Oliver D. Hart]], and others in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Risk sharing and incentives in the principal and agent relationship|last = Shavell|first = Steven|date = 1979|journal = Bell Journal of Economics|doi = 10.2307/3003319|pmid = |access-date = |pages = 55–73|volume = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = An analysis of the principal-agent problem|last = Grossman|first = Sanford J.|date = 1983|journal = Econometrica|doi = 10.2307/1912246|pmid = |access-date = |volume = 51|pages = 7–46|last2 = Hart|first2 = Oliver D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been extended to the case of repeated moral hazard by William P. Rogerson and to the case of multiple tasks by [[Bengt R. Holmström|Bengt Holmström]] and [[Paul Milgrom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Repeated moral hazard|last = Rogerson|first = William P.|date = 1985|journal = Econometrica|doi = 10.2307/1911724|pmid = |access-date = |volume = 53|pages = 69–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Multitask principal-agent analyses: Incentive contracts, asset ownership, and job design|last = Homström|first = Bengt|date = 1991|journal = Journal of Law, Economics, &amp; Organization|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Milgrom|first2 = Paul|pages = 24–52|volume = 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The moral hazard model with risk-neutral but wealth-constrained agents has also been extended to settings with repeated interaction and multiple tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Repeated Moral Hazard And Contracts With Memory: The Case of Risk Neutrality|last = Ohlendorf|first = Susanne|date = 2012|journal = International Economic Review|doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2354.2012.00687.x|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Schmitz|first2 = Patrick W.|volume = 53|pages = 433–452}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it is difficult to test models with hidden action empirically (since there is no field data on unobservable variables), the premise of contract theory that incentives matter has been successfully tested in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Provision of Incentive in Firms|last = Prendergast|first = Canice|date = 1999|journal = Journal of Economic Literature|doi = 10.1257/jel.37.1.7|pmid = |access-date = |volume = 37|pages = 7–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, contract-theoretic models with hidden actions have been directly tested in laboratory experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hoppe|first=Eva I.|last2=Schmitz|first2=Patrick W.|date=2018|title=Hidden action and outcome contractibility: An experimental test of moral hazard theory|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geb.2018.02.006|journal=Games and Economic Behavior|volume=109|pages=544–564|doi=10.1016/j.geb.2018.02.006|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Adverse selection===
In [[adverse selection]] models, the [[:wikt:principal|principal]] is not informed about a certain characteristic of the [[Agent (law)|agent]] at the time the contract is written. The characteristic is called the agent's "type". For example, [[health insurance]] is more likely to be purchased by people who are more likely to get sick. In this case, the agent's type is his or her health status, which is privately known by the agent. Another prominent example is public procurement contracting: The government agency (the principal) does not know the private firm's cost. In this case, the private firm is the agent and the agent's type is the cost level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A theory of incentives in procurement and regulation|last = Laffont|first = Jean-Jacques|publisher = MIT Press|year = 1993|isbn = |location = |pages = |last2 = Tirole|first2 = Jean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In adverse selection models, there is typically too little trade (i.e., there is a so-called "downward distortion" of the trade level compared to a "first-best" benchmark situation with complete information), except when the agent is of the best possible type (which is known as the "no distortion at the top" property). The principal offers a menu of contracts to the agent; the menu is called "incentive-compatible" if the agent picks the contract that was designed for his or her type. In order to make the agent reveal the true type, the principal has to leave an information rent to the agent (i.e., the agent earns more than his or her reservation utility, which is what the agent would get if no contract was written). Adverse selection theory has been pioneered by [[Roger Myerson]], [[Eric Maskin]], and others in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Regulating a monopolist with unknown costs|last = Baron|first = David P.|date = 1982|journal = Econometrica|doi = 10.2307/1912769|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Myerson|first2 = Roger B.|pages = 911–930|issue = |volume = 50|citeseerx = 10.1.1.407.6185}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Monopoly with incomplete information|last = Maskin|first = Eric|date = 1984|journal = RAND Journal of Economics|doi = 10.2307/2555674|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Riley|first2 = John|volume = 15|pages = 171–196}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, adverse selection theory has been tested in laboratory experiments and in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Do sellers offer menus of contracts to separate buyer types? An experimental test of adverse selection theory|last = Hoppe|first = Eva I.|date = 2015|journal = Games and Economic Behavior|doi = 10.1016/j.geb.2014.11.001|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Schmitz|first2 = Patrick W.|pages = 17–33|volume = 89}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Advances in Economics and Econometrics|last = Chiappori|first = Pierre-Andre|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2002|isbn = |location = |pages = |editor-last = Dewatripont|chapter = Testing Contract Theory: A Survey of Some Recent Work|last2 = Salanie|first2 = Bernard|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adverse selection theory has been expanded in several directions, e.g. by endogenizing the information structure (so the agent can decide whether or not to gather private information) and by taking into consideration [[social preferences]] and [[bounded rationality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Contracts and productive information gathering|last = Crémer|first = Jacques|date = 1998|journal = Games and Economic Behavior|doi = 10.1006/game.1998.0651|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Khalil|first2 = Fahad|last3 = Rochet|first3 = Jean-Charles|volume = 25|pages = 174–193}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Contracting under incomplete information and social preferences: an experimental study|last = Hoppe|first = Eva I.|date = 2013|journal = Review of Economic Studies|doi = 10.1093/restud/rdt010|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Schmitz|first2 = Patrick W.|pages = 1516–1544|volume = 80}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Behavioral Contract Theory|last = Köszegi|first = Botond|date = 2014|journal = Journal of Economic Literature|doi = 10.1257/jel.52.4.1075|pmid = |access-date = |pages = 1075–1118|volume = 52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incomplete contracts==
Contract theory also utilizes the notion of a [[complete contract]], which is thought of as a contract that specifies the legal consequences of every possible state of the world.  More recent developments known as the theory of [[incomplete contracts]], pioneered by [[Oliver Hart (economist)|Oliver Hart]] and his coauthors, study the incentive effects of parties' inability to write complete contingent contracts, e.g. concerning relationship-specific investments. A leading application of the incomplete contracting paradigm is the Grossman-Hart-Moore property rights approach to the [[theory of the firm]] (see Hart, 1995).

Because it would be impossibly complex and costly for the parties to an agreement to make their contract complete,&lt;ref name="contract"&gt;Hart, Oliver and Moore, John,  1988.  "Incomplete Contracts and Renegotiation," ''Econometrica'', 56(4), pp. 755–785.&lt;/ref&gt; the law provides [[default rule]]s which fill in the gaps in the actual agreement of the parties.

During the last 20 years, much effort has gone into the analysis of dynamic contracts.  Important early contributors to this literature include, among others, [[Edward J. Green]], Stephen Spear, and Sanjay Srivastava.

==Examples==
* [[George Akerlof]] described [[adverse selection]] in the market for used cars.
* In certain models, such as [[Michael Spence]]'s job-market model, the agent can [[Signaling (economics)|signal]] his type to the principal which may help to resolve the problem.

'''Diet in Hinduism''' varies with its diverse traditions. The ancient and medieval Hindu texts do not explicitly prohibit eating meat, but they do strongly recommend [[ahimsa]]—non-violence against all life forms including animals.&lt;ref name=dudek251&gt;Susan Dudek (2013), Nutrition Essentials for Nursing Practice, Wolters Kluwer Health, {{ISBN|978-1451186123}}, page 251&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Angela Wood 1998 page 80"&gt;Angela Wood (1998), Movement and Change, Nelson Thornes, {{ISBN|978-0174370673}}, page 80&lt;/ref&gt; Many Hindus prefer a [[vegetarian]] or [[lacto-vegetarian]] lifestyle, and methods of food production that are in sync with nature, compassionate, and respectful of other life forms as well as nature.&lt;ref name=dudek251/&gt;

The diet of Hindus usually does not include eggs, fish or meat. However, if included, Hindus often favor ''[[jhatka]]'' (quick death) style preparation of meat since Hindus believe that this method minimizes trauma and suffering to the animal.&lt;ref name=das151/&gt;&lt;ref name=nevillegregory206&gt;Neville Gregory and Temple Grandin (2007), Animal Welfare and Meat Production, CABI, {{ISBN|978-1845932152}}, pages 206-208&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient Hindu texts describe the whole of creation as a vast food chain, and the cosmos as a giant food cycle.&lt;ref name=olivelle20/&gt;

Hindu mendicants ([[sannyasa|sannyasin]]) avoid preparing their own food, relying either on begging for leftovers or harvesting seeds and fruits from forests, as this minimizes the likely harm to other life forms and nature.&lt;ref name=olivelle20/&gt;

==Food in the Vedas==
{{hinduism}}
The Vedic texts have conflicting verses, which scholars have interpreted to mean support or opposition to meat-based food. A group states that some Vedic hymns mention animal sacrifice and therefore support non-vegetarianism. According to Marvin Harris, the Vedic literature is contradictory, with some suggesting ritual slaughter and meat consumption, while others suggesting a taboo on meat eating.&lt;ref name=harris201/&gt; The hymn 10.87.16 of the Hindu scripture ''[[Rigveda]]'' (~1200–1500 BCE), states Nanditha Krishna, condemns all killings of men, cattle and horses, and prays to god [[Agni]] to punish those who kill.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Krishna |first=Nanditha |title=Sacred Animals of India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DF_af8_547EC&amp;pg=PT108 |date=2014 |publisher=Penguin Books Limited |ISBN=978-81-8475-182-6 |pages=15, 33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/ऋग्वेद:_सूक्तं_१०.८७ ऋग्वेद: सूक्तं १०.८७], Wikisource, Quote: "यः पौरुषेयेण क्रविषा समङ्क्ते यो अश्व्येन पशुना यातुधानः । यो अघ्न्याया भरति क्षीरमग्ने तेषां शीर्षाणि हरसापि वृश्च ॥१६॥"&lt;/ref&gt; According to Harris, from ancient times, vegetarianism became a well accepted mainstream Hindu tradition.&lt;ref name=harris201&gt;Marvin Harris (1990), [http://academic.regis.edu/rlumpp/PDF%20files/RT%20201%20India%27s%20Sacred%20Cow.pdf India's sacred cow], Anthropology: contemporary perspectives, 6th edition, Editors: Phillip Whitten &amp; David Hunter, Scott Foresman, {{ISBN|0-673-52074-9}}, pages 201-204&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kemmerer2011p59"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lisa Kemmerer|title=Animals and World Religions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fidwAgAAQBAJ|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-979076-0|pages=59–68 (Hinduism), pp. 100–110 (Buddhism)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Food in Upanishads, Samhitas and Sutras==
[[File:Vegetarian Andhra Meal.jpg|thumb|300px|Vegetarian diet is favored in many ancient Hindu texts. A vegetarian plate is shown above.]]
The Upanishads and Sutra texts of Hinduism discuss moderate diet and proper nutrition,&lt;ref name=svatmaram/&gt; as well as ''Aharatattva'' ([[dietetics]]).&lt;ref name=ray&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/CarakaSamhitaAScientificSynopsis/CarakaSamhita_priyadaranjanRay#page/n25/mode/2up Caraka Samhita] Ray and Gupta, National Institute of Sciences, India, pages 18-19&lt;/ref&gt; The Upanishads and Sutra texts invoke the concept of virtuous self-restraint in matters of food, while the [[Samhita]]s discuss what and when certain foods are suitable. A few Hindu texts such as Hathayoga Pradipika combine both.&lt;ref name=tts&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/hathayogapradipika/hatha_yoga_pradipika#page/n45/mode/2up Hathayoga Pradipika] Brahmananda, Adyar Library, The Theosophical Society, Madras India (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;

Moderation in diet is called ''Mitahara'', and this is discussed in [[Shandilya Upanishad]],&lt;ref name="KN Aiyar 1914 pages 173-176"&gt;KN Aiyar (1914), Thirty Minor Upanishads, Kessinger Publishing, {{ISBN|978-1164026419}}, Chapter 22, pages 173-176&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by Svātmārāma as a virtue.&lt;ref name=svatmaram&gt;{{cite book|title=The Hatha Yoga Pradipika|author=Svātmārāma|author2=Pancham Sinh |publisher = Forgotten Books|edition= 5|year=1997|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9sBFttVx6ukC|ISBN=  9781605066370|page=14|quote=&lt;br&gt;Quote - अथ यम-नियमाः&lt;br&gt; अहिंसा सत्यमस्तेयं बरह्यछर्यम कश्हमा धृतिः &lt;br&gt; दयार्जवं '''मिताहारः''' शौछम छैव यमा दश}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lorenzen|first1=David|title=The Kāpālikas and Kālāmukhas|date=1972|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0520018426|pages=186–190}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Merging with Śiva: Hinduism's contemporary metaphysics |last= Subramuniya |publisher= Himalayan Academy Publications|year= 2003|location= |isbn=  9780945497998 |page=155 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JupkNVxfwHgC |accessdate=6 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the [[yamas]] (virtuous self restraints) discussed in ancient Indian texts.{{Efn|group=note|The other nine [[yamas]] are [[Ahinsā]] (अहिंसा): Nonviolence, [[Satya]] (सत्य): truthfulness, [[Asteya]] (अस्तेय): not stealing, [[Brahmacharya]] (ब्रह्मचर्य): celibacy and not cheating on one’s spouse, [[Forgiveness#Hinduism|Kṣhamā]] (क्षमा): forgiveness,&lt;ref name=ss&gt;Stuart Sovatsky (1998), Words from the Soul: Time East/West Spirituality and Psychotherapeutic Narrative, State University of New York, {{ISBN|978-0791439494}}, page 21&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dhrti|Dhṛti]] (धृति): fortitude, [[Compassion#Hinduism|Dayā]] (दया): compassion,&lt;ref name=ss/&gt; [[Ārjava]] (आर्जव): sincerity, non-hypocrisy, and [[Shaucha|Śauca]] (शौच): purity, cleanliness.}}

Some of the earliest ideas behind ''Mitahara'' trace to ancient era [[Taittiriya Upanishad]], which in various hymns discusses the importance of food to healthy living, to the cycle of life,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/taittiriyaupanis00sankiala#page/396/mode/2up Annamaya Kosa] Taittiriya Upanishad, Anuvaka II, pages 397-406&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to its role in one's body and its effect on Self (Atman, Spirit).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/taittiriyaupanis00sankiala#page/740/mode/2up Realization of Brahman] Taittiriya Upanishad, Anuvaka II &amp; VII, pages 740-789; This is extensively discussed in these chapters; Illustrative quote - "Life, verily, is food; the body the food-eater" (page 776)&lt;/ref&gt; The Upanishad, states Stiles,&lt;ref&gt;M Stiles (2008), Ayurvedic Yoga Therapy, Lotus Press, {{ISBN|978-0940985971}}, pages 56-57&lt;/ref&gt; notes “from food life springs forth, by food it is sustained, and in food it merges when life departs”.

Many ancient and medieval Hindu texts debate the rationale for a voluntary stop to cow slaughter and the pursuit of vegetarianism as a part of a general abstention from violence against others and all killing of animals.&lt;ref name="Alsdorf2010p32"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ludwig Alsdorf|title=The History of Vegetarianism and Cow-Veneration in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iHKMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA32|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-16641-0|pages=32–44 with footnotes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mclane271&gt;{{cite book|author=John R.

The [[Bhagavad Gita]] includes verses on diet and moderation in food in Chapter 6. It states in verse 6.16 that a Yogi must neither eat too much nor too little, neither sleep too much nor too little.&lt;ref name=pt&gt;Paul Turner (2013), FOOD YOGA - Nourishing Body, Mind &amp; Soul, 2nd Edition, {{ISBN|978-0985045111}}, page 164&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding and regulating one’s established habits about eating, sleeping and recreation is suggested as essential to the practice of yoga in verse 6.17.&lt;ref name=pt/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Knapp, The Heart of Hinduism: The Eastern Path to Freedom, Empowerment and Illumination, {{ISBN|978-0595350759}}, page 284&lt;/ref&gt;

Another ancient Indian text, ''[[Tirukkuṛaḷ]]'', originally written in the South Indian language of [[Tamil language|Tamil]], states moderate diet as a virtuous life style and criticizes "non-vegetarianism" in its ''Pulaan Maruthal'' (abstinence from flesh or meat) chapter, through verses 251 through 260.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.projectmadurai.org/pm_etexts/pdf/pm0153.pdf Tirukkural], Translated by GU Pope et al, WH Allen, London, verses 251-260, pages 31-32, and pages 114-115, 159&lt;/ref&gt; Verse 251, for instance, questions "how can one be possessed of kindness, who, to increase his own flesh, eats the flesh of other creatures." It also says that "the wise, who are devoid of mental delusions, do not eat the severed body of other creatures" (verse 258), suggesting that "flesh is nothing but the despicable wound of a mangled body" (verse 257). It continues to say that not eating meat is a practice more sacred than the most sacred religious practices ever known (verse 259) and that only those who refrain from killing and eating the kill are worthy of veneration (verse 260). This text, written before 400 CE, and sometimes called the Tamil [[Veda]], discusses eating habits and its role in a healthy life (Mitahara), dedicating Chapter 95 of Book 7 to it.&lt;ref name=gutenberg/&gt; ''Tirukkuṛaḷ'' states in verses 943 through 945, "eat in moderation, when you feel hungry, foods that are agreeable to your body, refraining from foods that your body finds disagreeable". Tiruvalluvar also emphasizes overeating has ill effects on health, in verse 946, as “the pleasures of health abide in the man who eats moderately. The pains of disease dwell with him who eats excessively.”&lt;ref name=gutenberg&gt;[http://ebooks.gutenberg.us/HimalayanAcademy/SacredHinduLiterature/weaver/eng_95.htm Tirukkuṛaḷ] see Chapter 95, Book 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/tirukkural-tirukkural/oclc/777453934?referer=di&amp;ht=edition Tirukkuṛaḷ] Translated by V.V.R. Aiyar, Tirupparaithurai: Sri Ramakrishna Tapovanam (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

Verses 1.57 through 1.63 of the Hathayoga Pradipika suggests that taste cravings should not drive one's eating habits, rather the best diet is one that is tasty, nutritious and likable as well as sufficient to meet the needs of one's body and for one’s inner self.&lt;ref name=ksj/&gt; It recommends that one must "eat only when one feels hungry" and "neither overeat nor eat to completely fill the capacity of one's stomach; rather leave a quarter portion empty and fill three quarters with quality food and fresh water".&lt;ref name=ksj&gt;KS Joshi, Speaking of Yoga and Nature-Cure Therapy, Sterling Publishers, {{ISBN|978-1845570453}}, page 65-66&lt;/ref&gt; Verses 1.59 to 1.61 of Hathayoga Pradipika suggest a ''mitahara'' regimen of a yogi avoids foods with excessive amounts of sour, salt, bitterness, oil, spice burn, unripe vegetables, fermented foods or alcohol. The practice of ''Mitahara'', in Hathayoga Pradipika, includes avoiding stale, impure and [[Tamas (philosophy)|tamas]]ic foods, and consuming moderate amounts of fresh, vital and [[Sattva|sattvic]] foods.&lt;ref name=srosen&gt;Steven Rosen (2011), Food for the Soul: Vegetarianism and Yoga Traditions, Praeger, {{ISBN|978-0313397035}}, pages 25-29&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diet in ancient Hindu texts on health===
[[Charaka Samhita]] and [[Sushruta Samhita]] – two major ancient Hindu texts on health related subjects, include many chapters on the role of diet and personal needs of an individual. In Chapter 10 of Sushruta Samhita, for example, the diet and nutrition for pregnant women, nursing mothers and young children are described.&lt;ref name= Bhishagratna216&gt;KKL Bhishagratna, [https://archive.org/stream/englishtranslati00susruoft#page/216/mode/2up Chapter X, Sushruta Samhita], Vol 2, Calcutta, page 216-238&lt;/ref&gt; It recommends milk, butter, fluid foods, fruits, vegetables and fibrous diets for expecting mothers along with soups made from ''jangala'' (wild) meat.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/englishtranslati00susruoft#page/216/mode/2up Sushruta Samhita] KKL Bhishagratna, Vol 2, Calcutta, page 217&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, vegetarian diets are preferred and recommended in the Samhitas; however, for those recovering from injuries, growing children, those who do high levels of physical exercise, and expecting mothers, Sutrasthanam's Chapter 20 and other texts recommend carefully prepared meat. Sushruta Samhita also recommends a rotation and balance in foods consumed, in moderation.&lt;ref name= Bhishagratna216/&gt; For this purposes, it classifies foods by various characteristics, such as taste. In Chapter 42 of Sutrasthanam, for example, it lists six tastes – ''madhura'' (sweet), ''amla'' (acidic), ''lavana'' (salty), ''katuka'' (pungent), ''tikta'' (bitter) and ''kashaya'' (astringent). It then lists various sources of foods that deliver these tastes and recommends that all six tastes (flavors) be consumed in moderation and routinely, as a habit for good health.&lt;ref&gt;KKL Bhishagratna, [https://archive.org/stream/englishtranslati01susruoft#page/384/mode/2up Sutrasthanam, Chapter XLII] Sushruta Samhita, Vol 1, Calcutta, page 385-393&lt;/ref&gt;

==Food in the Dharmaśāstras==
According to Kane, one who is about to eat food should greet the food when it is served to him. In performing this act, he should honour it, never speak ill, and never find fault in it.&lt;ref name=olivelle20/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kane, ''History of the Dharmaśāstras'' Vol. 2, p. 762&lt;/ref&gt; Everyone needs food, and everything is food for something or someone else.&lt;ref name=olivelle20/&gt; Living beings eat and are eaten, state the ancient Hindu texts, the whole of creation is a vast food chain, the cosmos a giant food cycle.&lt;ref name=olivelle20&gt;Patrick Olivelle (1991), From feast to fast: food and the Indian Ascetic, in Medical Literature from India, Sri Lanka, and Tibet (Editors: Gerrit Jan Meulenbeld, Julia Leslie), BRILL, {{ISBN|978-9004095229}}, pages 17-36&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dharmasastra literature, states [[Patrick Olivelle]], admonishes "people not to cook for themselves alone", offer it to the gods, to forefathers, to fellow human beings as hospitality and as alms to the monks and needy.&lt;ref name=olivelle20/&gt; All living beings are interdependent in matters of food, thus food must be respected, worshipped and taken with care.&lt;ref name=olivelle20/&gt; Olivelle states that the Shastras recommend that when a person sees food, he should fold his hands, bow to it, and say a prayer of thanks.&lt;ref name=olivelle20/&gt; This reverence for food reaches a state of extreme in the renouncer or monk traditions in Hinduism.&lt;ref name=olivelle20/&gt; The Hindu tradition views procurement and preparation of food as necessarily a violent process, where other life forms and nature are disturbed, in part destroyed, changed and reformulated into something edible and palatable. The mendicants ([[sannyasa|sannyasin]], ascetics) avoid being the initiator of this process, and therefore depend entirely on begging for food that is left over of householders.&lt;ref name=olivelle20/&gt; In pursuit of their spiritual beliefs, states Olivelle, the "mendicants eat other people's left overs".&lt;ref name=olivelle20/&gt; If they cannot find left overs, they seek fallen fruit or seeds left in field after harvest.&lt;ref name=olivelle20/&gt;

The forest [[hermit]]s of Hinduism, on the other hand, do not even beg for left overs.&lt;ref name=olivelle20/&gt; Their food is wild and uncultivated. Their diet would consist mainly of fruits, roots, leaves, and anything that grows naturally in the forest.&lt;ref name=olivelle20/&gt; They avoided stepping on plowed land, lest they hurt a seedling. They attempted to live a life that minimizes, preferably eliminates, the possibility of harm to any life form.&lt;ref name=olivelle20/&gt;

===''Manusmriti''===

The ''[[Manusmriti]]'' discusses diet in chapter 5, where like other Hindu texts, it includes verses that strongly discourage meat eating, as well as verses where meat eating is declared appropriate in times of adversity and various circumstances, recommending that the meat in such circumstances be produced with minimal harm and suffering to the animal.&lt;ref name=olivelle139&gt;Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195171464}}, pages 139-141&lt;/ref&gt; The verses 5.48-5.52 of ''Manusmriti'' explain the reason for avoiding meat as follows (abridged),

{{Quote|
One can never obtain meat without causing injury to living beings... he should therefore abstain from meat. Reflecting on how meat is obtained and on how embodied creatures are tied up and killed, he should quit eating any kind of meat... The man who authorizes, the man who butchers, the man who slaughters, the man who buys or sells, the man who cooks, the man who serves, and the man who eats – these are all killers. There is no greater sinner than a man who, outside of an offering to gods or ancestors, wants to make his own flesh thrive at the expense of someone else's.
|''Manusmriti''|5.48-5.52, translated by [[Patrick Olivelle]]&lt;ref name=olivelle139/&gt;}}

In contrast, verse 5.33 of ''Manusmriti'' states that a man may eat meat in a time of adversity, verse 5.27 recommends that eating meat is okay if not eating meat may place a person's health and life at risk, while various verses such as 5.31 and 5.39 recommend that the meat be produced as a sacrifice ([[Jhatka]] method).&lt;ref name=olivelle139/&gt; In verses 3.267 to 3.272, ''Manusmriti'' approves of fish and meats of deer, antelope, poultry, goat, sheep, boar,  buffalo, rabbit and others as part of sacrificial food.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195171464}}, page 122&lt;/ref&gt; In an exegetical analysis of ''Manusmriti'', Patrick Olivelle states that the document shows opposing views on eating meat was common among ancient Hindus, and that underlying emerging thoughts on appropriate diet was driven by ethic of non-injury and spiritual thoughts about all life forms, the trend being to reduce the consumption of meat and favour a non-injurious vegetarian lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195171464}}, pages 279-280&lt;/ref&gt;

==Food and ethics==
[[File:Loma Linda University Vegetarian Food Pyramid.jpg|thumb|360px|This is a typical vegetarian food pyramid; however, many Hindus consider eggs to be derived from the animal life cycle, and therefore are non-vegetarian.]]
Hinduism does not explicitly prohibit eating meat, but it does strongly recommend [[ahimsa]] – the concept of non-violence against all life forms including animals.&lt;ref name="dudek251"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Angela Wood 1998 page 80"/&gt; As a consequence, many Hindus prefer a vegetarian or lacto-vegetarian lifestyle, and methods of food production that are in harmony with nature, compassionate, and respectful of other life forms as well as nature.&lt;ref name=dudek251/&gt;

The followers of ISKCON ([[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]], Hare Krishna) abstain from meat, fish, and fowl.

Hindus who do eat meat, often distinguish all other meat from cow meat ([[beef]]).

'''Dow Corning''' was&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-dowdupont-m-a/dowdupont-alters-post-merger-breakup-plans-amid-investor-pressure-idUSKCN1BN15F&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.plastverarbeiter.de/74087/dowdupont-gibt-namen-der-kuenftigen-drei-divisionen-bekannt/&lt;/ref&gt; an American [[multinational corporation]] headquartered in [[Midland, Michigan]], United States. Originally established as a joint venture between the [[Dow Chemical Company]] and [[Corning Inc.|Corning Incorporated]], it is now owned by [[DowDuPont]] and specializes in [[silicone]] and [[silicon]]-based technology, and is the largest silicone product producer in the world.&lt;ref name=jv/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Dow Corning, Bay City.jpg|thumb|right|Dow Corning, Bay City]]
Dow Corning was formally established in 1943 as a [[joint venture]] between the American conglomerates [[Dow Chemical]] and [[Corning Glass]] to explore the potential of silicone and was a manufacturer of products for use by the U.S. military in World War II. The company began operating its first plant, in Midland, MI, in 1945. Dr. E. C. Sullivan was named president, and  Dr. William R. Collings was named general manager in 1943. Dr. Collings later became president from 1954 until 1962.&lt;ref name=timeline /&gt; It expanded into Canada and Europe in 1948, and into South America and Japan in 1961.&lt;ref name= 'timeline'&gt;{{cite news|title=Michigan-based Dow Corning: Timeline of a global success story|url=http://www.mlive.com/business/mid-michigan/index.ssf/2014/11/dow_corning_timeline.html|accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large, majority-owned subsidiary of Dow Corning Corporation is the [[Hemlock Semiconductor Corporation]].&lt;ref name=jv&gt;{{cite news |author=Robert Westervelt |coauthors= |title=Dow Corning |url=http://www.chemweek.com/dowcorning2011/ |quote=Dow Corning, a 50–50 jv between Dow Chemical and Corning, is the world’s largest silicones producer and has a controlling 62.5% stake in Hemlock Semiconductor (Hemlock, MI), the world’s leading producer of polysilicon used in semiconductor and solar wafer production. ... |newspaper=[[Chemical Week]] |date=June 24, 2011 |accessdate=2015-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the world's largest producers of high-purity polycrystalline silicon, which is sold in varying purity grades for use in both [[semiconductor]] [[Wafer (electronics)|silicon wafer]] manufacture and [[photovoltaics]] applications as solar cells.&lt;ref name=timeline /&gt;

In 2002, the company created the Xiameter brand as an online-only distributor. As of 2011, Xiameter offers 2,100 of Dow Corning’s 7,000 products.

On November 13, 2014, Dow Chemical's CEO [[Andrew N. Liveris]] revealed in a presentation to investors that Corning Incorporated intended to exit the joint venture of 71 years, citing other priorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dow Says Corning Wants to Exit 71-Year-Old Venture|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-11-13/dow-says-corning-wants-to-exit-71-year-old-venture.html|accessdate=16 November 2014|work=Bloomberg News|publisher=Bloomberg|first=Jack|last=Kaskey|date=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the December 11, 2015 announcement that it would merge with [[DuPont]], Dow also announced that it had reached a deal to acquire Corning's stake in Dow Corning in exchange for $4.8 billion in cash and Corning gaining a roughly 40% stake in Hemlock Semiconductor Corporation.

==Products==
Dow Corning markets over 7000 products include various sealants, adhesives, rubbers, lubricants, silicon oils and solvents. Around 2,100 of these are available through the Dow Corning online-only distributor Xiameter, including fluids, gels, resins. The range of industries targeted by Dow Corning products spans from electronics and automotive to construction, healthcare and others.

==Problems with breast implants==
Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, [[class action|class-action]] lawsuits&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/24bn-breastimplant-offer-1247358.html independent.co.uk – $2.4bn breast-implant offer], 1997-08-26&lt;/ref&gt; claimed that Dow Corning's silicone [[breast implant]]s caused systemic health problems. The claims first centered on [[breast cancer]] and then migrated to a range of [[autoimmunity|autoimmune disease]]s, including [[Systemic lupus erythematosus|lupus]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]] and various neurological problems. This led to numerous lawsuits beginning in 1984 and culminating in a 1998 multibillion-dollar class action settlement.&lt;ref name = frontline&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/implants/cron.html Chronology of silicone breast implants].

The '''Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986''' is a [[United States federal law]] passed by the [[99th United States Congress]] located at Title 42, Chapter 116 of the [[U.S. Code]], concerned with emergency response preparedness.

On October 17, 1986, President [[Ronald Reagan]] signed into law the [[Superfund|Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act]] of 1986 (SARA). This act amended the [[Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act]] of 1980 (CERCLA), commonly known as [[Superfund]].

A free-standing law, the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 (EPCRA) was commonly known as SARA Title III. Its purpose is to encourage and support emergency planning efforts at the state and local levels and to provide the public and local governments with information concerning potential [[chemical hazard]]s present in their communities.

==Background==
During the early morning hours of December 3, 1984, a Union Carbide plant in a village just South of [[Bhopal]], India released approximately forty tons of [[Methyl Isocyanate]] (MIC) into the air. Used in the manufacture of [[pesticides]], MIC is a lethal chemical. The gas quickly and silently diffused over the ground and, in the end, killed, by some estimates, upwards to 5,000 people and injured 50,000 more. The only other place in the world that [[Union Carbide]] manufactured MIC is at its Institute plant in the Kanawha Valley of West Virginia. {{See also|Bhopal disaster}}

A week after the Bhopal accident, on December 11, 1984, Hank Karawan, then plant manager of the Union Carbide's Institute facility, held a press conference at which he expressed his confidence in the safety of the Institute plant's operations:&lt;ref&gt;Chem. Eng. News, 1984, 62 (51), pp 6–7 {{doi|10.1021/cen-v062n051.p006}}, December 17, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;All of us here at the Institute plant have been deeply saddened by the tragic event in India and we extend our sympathy to all the people in the city of Bhopal. I am pleased to have the opportunity to make a point here this morning. Employees of the Institute plant have been manufacturing MIC in an effective and safe manner for seventeen years. We are extremely proud of that safety record. We are confident in the ability of our trained, dedicated, skilled, and experienced people. We are confident in the equipment that we operate, the safety precautions that we utilize, the monitoring systems that we have, and our plant emergency preparedness.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite Mr. Karawan's vote of confidence for the safety of the MIC operations at his plant, Union Carbide elected to shut down production of the deadly chemical until it could make $500 million worth of safety improvements. On May 4, 1985, Union Carbide [http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-05-06/business/8501270881_1_union-carbide-bhopal-plant-methyl-isocyanate resumed production of MIC]. On August 11, 1985, on the heels of the completion of the safety improvement program just a few months before, 500 gallons of [https://archive.is/20121213150001/http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/index.cfm?objectid=E87767BC-BDB5-82F8-F5CA84CEF0EA3933 aldicarb oxime] and highly toxic MIC [http://articles.latimes.com/1985-08-24/news/mn-26087_1_union-carbide-corp leaked from the Institute plant]. Although no one was killed, 134 people living around the plant were treated at local hospitals.

Both the Bhopal and the Institute incidents underscored the reality of modern-day chemical production—no matter what safety precautions are taken, no matter how well trained a plant's employees may be, and no matter how prepared a plant may be to handle an emergency situation, accidents may still occur. Indeed, around the time of the [[Bhopal disaster]], 6,928 chemical accidents occurred in the United States within a five-year period. In response to this growing threat, the United States Congress passed the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Video: Chemical Valley, Appalshop, Inc., Whitesburg, KY (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Primary responsibilities==
In November 1986, the United States Congress passed the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act ("EPCRA" or "the Act") to help America's communities "deal safely and effectively with the many hazardous substances that are used throughout our society."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/swercepp/pubs/chem-com.html Chemicals in Your Community: A Guide to the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act](U.S. GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE: 1988 516-002/80246)&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the Act is two-fold: (1) to encourage and support emergency planning for responding to [[chemical accident]]s; and (2) to provide local governments and the public with information about possible [[chemical hazards]] in their communities. To facilitate cooperation between industry, interested citizens, environmental and other public-interest organizations, and government at all levels, the Act establishes an ongoing "forum" at the local level called the [[Local Emergency Planning Committee]] (LEPC). LEPCs are governed by the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC) in each state.

Under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, SERCs and LEPCs are charged with four primary responsibilities:
* Write emergency plans to protect the public from chemical accidents;
* Establish procedures to warn and, if necessary, evacuate the public in case of an emergency;
* Provide citizens and local governments with information about hazardous chemicals and accidental releases of chemicals in their communities; and
* Assist in the preparation of public reports on annual release of toxic chemicals into the air, water, and soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mass.gov/?pageID=eopsterminal&amp;L=5&amp;L0=Home&amp;L1=Homeland+Security+&amp;+Emergency+Response&amp;L2=Emergency+Information&amp;L3=Hazardous+Materials&amp;L4=State+Emergency+Response+Commission+(SERC)&amp;sid=Eeops&amp;b=terminalcontent&amp;f=mema_mema_serc_lepc_info&amp;csid=Eeops|title=Mass.gov|author=|date=|website=Mass.gov|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==EPCRA Reporting Requirements==
EPCRA does not place limits on which chemicals can be stored, used, released, disposed, or transferred at a facility. It only requires a facility to document, notify, and report information. Each section of the law, however, applies different requirements, has different deadlines and covers a different group of chemicals.

==Emergency Planning (Sections 301–303, 42 U.S.C. §§ 11001-11003)==
These sections are to ensure that state and local communities are prepared to respond to potential chemical accidents. As a first step, each state had to establish a State Emergency Response Commission (SERC). In turn, the SERC designated local emergency planning districts. For each district, the SERC appoints, supervises and coordinates the activities of a Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). The LEPC must, in turn, develop an emergency response plan for its district and review it annually. The membership of the LEPC includes representatives of public and private organizations as well as a representative from every facility subject to EPCRA emergency planning requirements. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/osweroe1/docs/chem/epcra.pdf|title=Emergency Response - US EPA|first=US|last=EPA,OSWER,OEM|date=|website=US EPA|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plan developed by the LEPC must:

* identify affected facilities and transportation routes;
* describe emergency notification and response procedures;
* designate community and facility emergency coordinators;
* describe methods to determine the occurrence and extent of a release;
* identify available response equipment and personnel;
* outline evacuation plans;
* describe training and practice programs and schedules; and
* contain methods and schedules for exercising the plan.

Determining if a facility is subject to the EPCRA emergency planning requirements is straightforward. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has published a list of "extremely hazardous substances (EHS)." For each EHS, the list includes the name, the [[CAS registry number|Chemical Abstract Service number]] of the substance, and a number called a threshold planning quantity (TPQ). The TPQ, expressed in pounds, is the critical number. If a facility has within its boundaries an amount of an extremely hazardous substance equal to or in excess of its threshold planning quantity, the facility is subject to the EPCRA emergency planning requirements and must notify both the SERC and the LEPC of this fact. The facility must also appoint an emergency response coordinator who will work with the LEPC on developing and implementing the local emergency plan at the facility.

==Emergency Release Notification (Section 304, 42 U.S.C. § 11004)==
A facility may be subject to these reporting requirements even if it is not subject to the provisions of Sections 301–303. This section applies to any facility which stores, produces or uses a "hazardous chemical" (any chemical which is a physical hazard or a health hazard) and releases a reportable quantity (RQ) of a substance contained in either of the following two tables published by the EPA in the Code of Federal Regulations:
* list of extremely hazardous substances; and
* list of [[CERCLA]] hazardous substances.

The RQ is the critical number that determines if a release must be reported. This is a number expressed in pounds that is assigned to each chemical in the above-mentioned tables. If the amount of a chemical released to the environment exceeds the reportable quantity, the facility must immediately report the release to the appropriate LEPC and SERC and provide a written follow-up as soon as practicable. Immediate notification must include the following:

* The name of the chemical;
* The location of the release;
* Whether the chemical is on the "extremely hazardous" list;
* How much of the substance has been released;
* The time and duration of the incident;
* Whether the chemical was released into the air, water, or soil, or some combination of the three;
* Known or anticipated health risks and necessary medical attention;
* Proper precautions, such as evacuation; and
* A contact person at the facility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ci.la.ca.us/SAN/lasewers/ssmp/pdfs/vi._Overflow_Emergency_Response_Plan.pdf SERC Overflow Emergency Response Plan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311102259/http://www.ci.la.ca.us/SAN/lasewers/ssmp/pdfs/vi._Overflow_Emergency_Response_Plan.pdf |date=2012-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to immediate notification, facilities are required to provide a follow-up report, in writing, "update(ing) the original notification, provid(ing) additional information on response actions taken, known or anticipated health risks, and, if appropriate, advice regarding any medical care needed by exposure victims."&lt;ref&gt;[http://extension.missouri.edu/publications/DisplayPub.aspx?P=G7512 Pesticides: Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know] by James H. Jarman, Darryl P. Sanders and C. Dean Martin, G7512, reviewed October 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Failure to notify the proper authorities may result in civil penalties of up to $25,000 per day for each day of non-compliance and [[criminal penalties]] of up to $25,000 in fines and prison sentences of up to two years.

Of course there are exceptions. A release which results in exposure to persons solely within the facility boundary or is a federally permitted release does not have to be reported. Also, continuous [[pesticide]] and [[radionuclide]] releases meeting specified conditions are exempt.

==Community Right-to-Know Reporting Requirements (Sections 311–312, 42 U.S.C. §§ 11021-11022)==
The purpose of these requirements is to increase community awareness of chemical hazards and to facilitate emergency planning. This section applies to any facility that is required by the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) under its Hazard Communication Standard to prepare or have available a [[Safety Data Sheet]] (SDS) for a hazardous chemical (See II above for definition) or that has on-site, for any one day in a calendar year, an amount of a hazardous chemical equal to or greater than the following threshold limits established by the EPA:
* {{convert|10000|lb}} for hazardous chemicals; or
* lesser of {{convert|500|lb}} or the threshold planning quantity (TPQ) for extremely hazardous substances.

If a facility is subject to reporting under these sections, it must submit information to the SERC, the LEPC and the local fire department with jurisdiction over the facility under two categories: SDS reporting and inventory reporting.

===SDS Reporting===
SDS reporting requirements specifically provide information to the local community about mixtures and chemicals present at a facility and their associated hazards. For all substances whose on-site quantities exceed the above threshold limits, the facility must submit the following:

* initially a copy of the SDS for each above-threshold chemical on-site or a list of the chemicals grouped into categories; and
* within three months of any change, an SDS or list for additional chemicals which meet the reporting criteria.

===Inventory Reporting===
Inventory reporting is designed to provide information on the amounts, location and storage conditions of hazardous chemicals and mixtures containing hazardous chemicals present at facilities. The inventory report has two forms. The Tier One form, the simpler of the two, contains aggregate information for applicable hazard categories and must be submitted yearly by March 1. The Tier One form is no longer accepted by any state. The Tier Two form contains more detailed information, including the specific names of each chemical. This form is submitted upon request of any of the agencies authorized to receive the Tier One form. It can also be submitted yearly in lieu of the Tier One Form.

==Toxic Chemical Release Inventory Reporting (Section 313, 42 U.S.C. § 11023)==
The data gathered will assist in research and development of regulations, guidelines, and standards. Under this section, The EPA is required to establish the [[Toxics Release Inventory]] (TRI), an inventory of routine toxic chemical emissions from certain facilities. The original data requirements for the TRI, specified in SARA Title III, have been greatly expanded by the [[Pollution Prevention Act of 1990]]. The TRI must now also include information on source reduction, recycling and treatment.

To obtain this data, EPCRA requires each affected facility to submit a Toxic Chemical Release Inventory Form (Form R) to the EPA and designated state officials each year on July 1. A facility must file a Form R if it:

* has 10 or more full-time employees;
* is in a specified Standard Industrial Classification Code; and
* manufactures more than 25,000&amp;nbsp;lb/year of a listed toxic chemical; or
* processes more than 25,000&amp;nbsp;lb/year of a listed toxic chemical; or
* otherwise uses more than 10,000&amp;nbsp;lb/year of a listed toxic chemical; or
* manufactures, processes or otherwise uses a listed persistent bioaccumaltive toxic (PBT) chemical above the respective PBT's reporting threshold. PBT reporting thresholds can vary anywhere from 0.1&amp;nbsp;grams for dioxin compounds to {{convert|100|lb}} for lead.

On October 29, 1999, EPA published a final rule (64 FR 58666) adding certain chemicals and chemical categories to the EPCRA section 313 list of toxic chemicals and lowering the reporting threshold for persistent bioaccumulative toxic (PBT) chemicals. On January 17, 2001 EPA published a final rule (66 FR 4500) that classified lead and lead compounds as PBT chemicals and lowered their reporting thresholds.

In December 2006, the EPA finalized a new TRI Rule which expands eligibility for use of the Form A Certification Statement in lieu of the more detailed Form R.  Details about this final rule can be found on the EPA website under TRI Reporting.

==Federal Agency Responsibilities Under EPCRA==
Since April 30, 1993, the [[United States Air Force]], in accordance with AFR 355-1, "Disaster Preparedness, Planning and Operations," has voluntarily complied with Sections 303 and 304 of EPCRA in spite of the fact that federal facilities were initially exempt from its requirements. On August 3, 1993, [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]] signed Executive Order 12856, "Federal Compliance With Right-to-Know Laws and Pollution Prevention Requirements." This Executive Order requires federal agencies, including the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], to fully comply with all provisions of EPCRA and the Pollution Prevention Act with one notable exception: the reporting requirements under Section 313. Currently, a non-federal facility must file a Form R only if it is in a specified [[Standard Industrial Classification]] (SIC) Code. This exclusion does not apply to federal agencies. Federal agencies will comply with the provisions of Section 313 regardless of the SIC code that applies to their facilities.

==Lists of Chemicals (Sections 302 and 311–313, 42 U.S.C. §§ 11002 and 11021-11023)==
The EPA's guide provides a useful description of the four groups of chemicals subject to reporting under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act:

* [[Extremely Hazardous Substances]] : This list currently contains more than 300 chemicals. Because of their extremely toxic properties, these chemicals were chosen to provide an initial focus for chemical emergency planning. If these chemicals are released in certain amounts, they may be of immediate concern to the community. Releases must be reported immediately.
* Hazardous Substances: These are hazardous substances listed under previous Superfund hazardous waste cleanup regulations (Section 103(a) of the Comprehensive Environmental Resource and Conservation Liability Act—Superfund). The current list contains about 720 substances. Releases of these chemicals above certain amounts must be reported immediately because they may represent an immediate hazard to the community.
* Hazardous Chemicals: These chemicals are not on a list at all, but are defined by [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] regulations as chemicals which represent a physical or health hazard. Under this definition many thousands of chemicals can be subject to reporting requirements if a facility manufactures, processes, or stores them in certain amounts. Inventories of these chemicals and material safety data sheets for each of them must be submitted if they are present in the facility in certain amounts.
* Toxic Chemicals: There are now more than 320 chemicals or chemical categories on this list, which were selected by Congress primarily because of their chronic or long-term toxicity. Estimates of releases of these chemicals into all media—air, land, and water—must be reported annually and entered into a national database.

Tompkins, the landmark 1938 Supreme Court case that limited the power of the federal courts}}&lt;/ref&gt; decision by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in which the Court held that [[United States federal courts|federal courts]] did not have the judicial power to create general federal common law when hearing state law claims under [[diversity jurisdiction]]. In reaching this holding, the Court overturned almost a century of federal [[civil procedure]] case law, and established the foundation of what remains the modern law of diversity jurisdiction as it applies to [[United States federal courts]].

==Facts==
''Erie'' began as a simple personal injury case when the plaintiff filed his complaint in diversity in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]]. As explained by the [[Second Circuit]] in its decision below, Harry Tompkins—a citizen and resident of [[Pennsylvania]], was walking next to the [[Erie Railroad]]'s [[Erie and Wyoming Valley Railroad]] [[rail tracks|tracks]] in [[Hughestown, Pennsylvania]], at 2:30 a.m. on July 27, 1934. A friend of Tompkins had driven him to within a few blocks of his home, which was located on a dead-end street near the tracks.  Tompkins chose to walk the remaining distance on a narrow but well-worn footpath adjacent to the tracks.  A train approached in the darkness, and an object protruding from one of the cars struck Tompkins.  When he fell to the ground, his right arm was crushed beneath the wheels of the train.

The train was owned and operated by the [[Erie Railroad]] company, a [[New York (state)|New York]] [[corporation]]. Tompkins sued this [[railroad]] company in a [[federal district court]]—the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]].  The district court, following the federal law at that time, applied neither New York nor Pennsylvania common law, but instead applied [[federal common law]], which applied an 'ordinary negligence' standard in determining the duty of care owed to persons not employed by the railroad or otherwise acting in the course of their employment walking along railroad tracks. In applying the federal common law standard, the federal court declined to apply Pennsylvania's common law standard of 'wanton negligence' for the duty of care owed by railroads to [[trespassers]]. The case was decided by a [[jury]] which was instructed by Judge [[Samuel Mandelbaum]] in accordance with the federal negligence standard. It found in favor of Tompkins and awarded him [[damages]]. The railroad appealed to the Second Circuit, which affirmed, then petitioned the Supreme Court for ''[[certiorari]]'', which was granted; Justice [[Benjamin Cardozo]] granted the railroad a [[Stay of proceedings|stay]] of its [[obligation]] to pay the judgment in Tompkins' favor until the Court decided the case.

By the time the Supreme Court's decision in ''Erie'' was handed down, it had long been settled that when a federal court hears a state cause of action brought in federal district court in diversity, the statutory law of the state would be applied. However, in the case of ''[[Swift v. Tyson]]'', 41 U.S. 1 (1842),  the Supreme Court had held that the federal courts need not also apply the court-made [[common law]] of the states. This had led to forum shopping, a litigation tactic whereby plaintiffs would seek to sue in federal court instead of state court in order to have a different substantive law applied. In light of this inequity, the Supreme Court had to determine whether federal courts should apply state common law.  However, the Court did not decide whether or not the new ruling applied to equity jurisprudence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yorio|first1=Edward|last2=Thel|first2=Steve|title=Contract enforcement:  Specific performance and injunctions|date=2004|publisher=Wolters Kluwer Law &amp;amp; Business.|location=New York, NY|page=22-3|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judgment==
The Court, in an opinion by Associate Justice [[Louis Brandeis|Brandeis]], examined the manipulations and opportunistic practices of litigants that had resulted from the rule of ''[[Swift v. Tyson]]'' and determined that "in attempting to promote uniformity of law throughout the United States, the doctrine had prevented uniformity in the administration of the law of the state." This had the effect of denying litigants equal protection of the law.

In ''Swift'', Justice [[Joseph Story]] had sought to interpret the [[Rules of Decision Act]].  This Act, which began as Section 34 of the [[Judiciary Act of 1789]], is now codified at {{UnitedStatesCode|28|1652}} and is as follows:

:The laws of the several States, except where the Constitution, [[treaty|treaties]], or statutes of the United States otherwise require or provide, shall be regarded as rules of decision in trials at common law, in the courts of the United States, in cases where they apply.

In the ''Swift'' decision, Story had interpreted the words "laws of the several States" narrowly, treating them as referring to only the statutory law of states and not the judge-made law declared by states' appellate courts.  Thus, where the state legislature had not passed a [[statute]] that controlled the case, a federal district court was free to make up its own common law.  This was enormously significant because nearly all U.S. [[contract]] and [[tort]] law consisted of (and still largely consists of) state judge-made law whose foundations lay in English common law running back to [[time immemorial]].  With ''Swift'', Story gave federal courts the freedom to depart from the existing body of state law if they so desired.

Story apparently hoped that when hearing state law claims in diversity jurisdiction, federal district courts would fashion a uniform "general law." As [[interstate commerce]] continued to increase, the common law of the states would converge with such general federal common law because states would recognize it was in their own best interest.

By 1938, as Justice Brandeis acknowledged, "the mischievous results of the doctrine had become apparent." The problem with ''Swift'' was that rather than reducing forum shopping, it had only increased it by increasing the opportunities for forum shopping available to litigants.  There were two underlying issues behind this.  First, as the ''Erie'' opinion noted, nothing in the Constitution actually grants jurisdiction to the federal judiciary to conduct plenary review of issues of state common law where no federal issue is present.  Second, in accordance with that understanding (although this latter point was not noted in the ''Erie'' opinion), Section 25 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 only authorized the Supreme Court to review those state supreme court decisions that ''rejected'' federal claims.  While Congress broadened the scope of Supreme Court review in 1914 to include state supreme court decisions allowing federal claims, Congress never actually authorized the Supreme Court to conduct plenary review of the merits of state law claims (and no one ever sought a constitutional amendment that would authorize Congress to do that).  This meant the Supreme Court could not directly dictate uniform rules of state common law to all state courts or reverse their decisions for failing to apply such rules, which stands in stark contrast to other common law federations like [[Australia]] and [[Canada]] whose highest courts do possess such powers.  Since state courts had no actual obligation to follow the "general law" independently formulated under ''Swift'' by federal courts, state judge-made law continued to diverge instead of converge.  

In turn, allowing federal courts to make up their ''own'' independent judge-made law only made the problem worse.  Parties who felt disadvantaged by a state judge-made rule could create diversity jurisdiction in the federal courts by simply moving to another state or reincorporating there (if a party was a [[corporation]]).  In the worst cases a party who had lost in the [[state supreme court]] would simply begin all over again in federal courts; since the federal district court had its ''own'' set of common law rules, it could hold it was not bound by the state supreme court ruling.  This practice was mentioned in dissent by Justice Holmes in ''[[Brown and Yellow Taxicab]]''.

The facts of ''Erie'' itself were an example of the kind of clever forum shopping practices which the Court wished to end. Pennsylvania clearly had [[personal jurisdiction]] over the railroad because of its operations there; also, the accident happened there, and Tompkins was a Pennsylvania resident.  But Tompkins chose to sue in a New York federal court to take advantage of its favorable rule &amp;mdash; knowing that he had a much lower probability of obtaining a judgment in his favor under Pennsylvania's rule.

Therefore, the Court felt it was time to overrule the doctrine of ''Swift'' as an unconstitutional extension of its own powers. Nothing in the [[Constitution of the United States]] permits the [[U.S. Congress]] to empower federal courts to create their own common law for cases that do not involve an issue of federal law. As Justice Brandeis wrote:

:Congress has no power to declare substantive rules of common law applicable in a state whether they be local in their nature or "general," be they commercial law or a part of the law of torts. And no clause in the Constitution purports to confer such a power upon the federal courts.

Thus, although the ''Erie'' decision itself does not identify specific provisions of the Constitution violated by ''Swift'', the language of the decision implies that ''Swift'' had stolen powers reserved to the states, in violation of the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]]. Justice Brandeis also noted problems for equal protection of the laws, but the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the Fourteenth Amendment applies only to states, and the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause was not read to include an equal protection component until the 1954 decision in ''[[Bolling v. Sharpe]]''.

As a result of ''Erie'', each federal district court was required to apply the law of whichever state it was sitting in, as though it was a state court of that state. Of course, this was a very difficult decision for the Court, since overruling ''Swift'' meant that a huge number of decisions by the Court and all lower federal courts were no longer valid law.  

However, the Court did not declare the Rules of Decision Act itself unconstitutional.  Instead, it reinterpreted the Act so federal district courts hearing cases in diversity jurisdiction had to apply the entire law, both statutory and judge-made, of the states in which they sit.

===Reed's concurrence===
Associate Justice [[Stanley Forman Reed|Stanley Reed]] filed a concurrence in which he agreed ''Swift'' had to be reversed, but argued ''Swift'' was merely an erroneous interpretation of the Rules of Decision Act, not an unconstitutional one.

===Butler's dissent===
Associate Justice [[Pierce Butler (justice)|Pierce Butler]] filed a [[dissenting opinion]], joined by Associate Justice [[James McReynolds]], in which he argued the majority had engaged in [[judicial activism]]. He asserted the majority had completely rewritten the two questions presented in the petition for ''certiorari'' as a constitutional question, when there really was no constitutional issue.  He pointed out that no one in this case had directly challenged the ''Swift'' regime, which the Court had adhered to for so long in so many cases.

==Significance==
===On remand===
The case was remanded to the Second Circuit for a ruling on the merits of Pennsylvania law.  Rather than applying New York law, the Court of Appeals applied the law of Pennsylvania as required by the [[choice-of-law]] rules of the time &amp;mdash; under which the law of the place of the accident was determinative &amp;mdash; and threw out Tompkins' case.

===Subsequent jurisprudence===
{{main|Erie doctrine}}
Later opinions limited the application of ''Erie'' to substantive state law; federal courts can generally use the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] while hearing state law claims.

It can be a problem for federal courts to know what a state court would decide on an issue of first impression (i.e., one not previously considered by state courts).  In such circumstances, federal courts engage in what is informally called an "''Erie'' guess."  This "guess," actually a carefully reasoned attempt to anticipate what the state's courts would decide, is not binding on state courts themselves, which may adopt the federal court's reasoning if and when the issue reaches them in some other case, or may decide the issue differently.  In the latter case, future federal courts would be required to follow the state's precedents, although a final judgment in the "guessed" case would not be reopened.

Alternatively, federal courts can certify questions to a state supreme court, so long as the state itself has a procedure in place to allow this.  For example, some federal district (trial) courts can certify questions to state supreme courts, but other states allow only federal courts of appeal (circuit) courts to do so.  In the latter situation, an ''Erie'' guess would be the only option available for the federal court attempting to apply state law.

'''''Film Superlist: Motion Pictures in the U.S. Public Domain''''' is a series of reference books created by attorney Walter Hurst about the [[copyright]] status of films.

Each ''Film Superlist'' volume contains the main text of the [[Copyright Catalog#Cumulative copyright catalogs|Cumulative Copyright Catalog of Motion Pictures]] for the period covered. Each entry has the title, copyright registration number, and copyright registration date. For films that were renewed, the renewal registration number and date have been added. Under [[United States copyright law]], films registered prior to 1964 required renewal during the 28th year following registration in order to continue copyright protection in the U.S. The [[United States Copyright Office]] published renewals in its semi-annual copyright catalogs for all renewals through the end of 1977. 
&lt;ref&gt;''Copyright and the Public Domain'' page 11-10; Stephen Fishman – Law Journal Press (2008); {{ISBN|978-1-58852-151-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Hurst’s death, publication of the ''Film Superlist'' books was continued by the Hollywood Film Archive. The current ''Film Superlist'' editor is D. Richard Baer.

In reviewing the 1992 updated edition of ''Film Superlist'' 1940–1949, ''[[Library Journal]]'' stated, "This volume, part of a three-volume set, updates and emends the excellent earlier (1979) edition by Walter Hurst. With the main text derived from the U.S. Copyright Office's Catalogue of Copyright Entries: Motion Pictures 1940–1949 , editor Baer assists the user in ascertaining the copyrighted status of 18,767 films copyrighted in the United States from 1940 to 1949."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Library Journal]]'' review; February 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Criminal defenses}}
In the [[United States criminal law]], a '''frame-up''' ('''frameup''') or '''setup''' is the act of '''framing''' someone, that is, providing [[falsification of evidence|false evidence]] or [[false testimony]] in order to falsely prove someone [[guilt (law)|guilt]]y of a [[crime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/search?db=dictionary&amp;q=frame-up|title=frame-up - Definitions from Dictionary.com|publisher=dictionary.reference.com|accessdate=2008-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[wikt:incriminate|incriminating]] those who are innocent might be done out of sheer malice, '''framing''' is primarily used as a [[distraction]].

Generally, the person who is framing someone else is the actual perpetrator of the crime. In other cases it is an attempt by law enforcement to get around [[due process]]. Motives include getting rid of political dissidents or "correcting" what they see as the court's mistake. Some lawbreakers will try to claim they were framed as a defense strategy.

[[Labor spies#Frameups|Frameups in labor disputes]] sometimes swing public opinion one way or the other. In Massachusetts, during the [[1912 Lawrence Textile Strike]], police acting on a tip discovered dynamite and blamed it on the union. National media echoed an anti-union message. Later, the police revealed that the dynamite had been wrapped in a magazine addressed to the son of the former mayor. The man had received an unexplained payment from the largest of the employers. Exposed, the plot swung public sympathy to the union.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|title=Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood|author=Peter Carlson|year=1983|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frameups are often part of [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]]. For example, there were frameup accusations in the [[2001 anthrax attacks|anthrax incident]] involving the [[United States Postal Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/frameup.html|title=The 9/11 Anthrax frame-up |publisher=whatreallyhappened.com|accessdate=2008-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A frameup where a police officer shoots an unarmed suspect and then places a weapon near the body is a form of [[police misconduct]] known as a "throw down" used to justify the shooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://openjurist.org/689/f2d/1220/webster-v-city-of-houston |title= 689 F. 2d 1220 - Webster v. City of Houston |at= paragraph 29 |website=openjurist.org |date= 28 October 1982|accessdate= 17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Future Trading Act of 1921''' (ch. 86, {{USStat|42|187}}) was a United States  [[Act of Congress]], approved on August 24, 1921, by the [[67th United States Congress]] intended to institute regulation of grain [[futures contract]]s and, particularly, the [[Exchange (organized market)|exchanges]] on which they were traded.  It was the second federal statute that attempted to regulate futures contracts after the short lived [[Anti-gold futures act of 1864]]. 

The act imposed a tax of 20 cents a [[bushel]] on all contracts for the sale of grain for future delivery other than those on exchanges regulated by the [[US Department of Agriculture]] that met standards set out in the statute.  Twenty cents a bushel was considered a large sum by the standards of the day.

The Act was held to be an unconstitutional by the [[US Supreme Court]] in [[Hill v. Wallace]] on May 15, 1922.  About four years later, on January 11, 1926, the Court announced a related decision in [[Trusler v. Crooks]].

The [[Grain Futures Act]] of 1922 was ruled constitutional in [[Board of Trade of City of Chicago v. Olsen]].

Only a small portion of the protocol, which superseded the first treaty, was publicly announced while the spheres of influence of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union remained classified. The third secret protocol of the Pact was signed on January 10, 1941 by Friedrich Werner von Schulenberg, and Molotov, wherein Germany renounced its claims to portions of Lithuania, only a few months before their anti-Soviet [[Operation Barbarossa]].&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/230972/German-Soviet-Nonaggression-Pact | title=A secret supplementary protocol (signed September 28, 1939) | publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica | work=German-Soviet Nonaggression Pact | date=2015 | accessdate=25 April 2015 | author=Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several [[secret treaty|secret articles]] were attached to the treaty. These articles allowed for [[Nazi–Soviet population transfers|the exchange of Soviet and German nationals]] between the two occupied zones of Poland, redrew parts of the central European [[spheres of interest]] dictated by the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, and also stated that neither party to the treaty would allow on its territory any "Polish agitation" directed at the other party.

During the western invasion of Poland, the German ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' had taken control of the [[Lublin Voivodeship (1919-1939)|Lublin Voivodeship]] and eastern [[Warsaw Voivodeship (1919-1939)|Warsaw Voivodeship]] - territories which according to the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact were in the Soviet sphere of influence. To compensate the Soviet Union for this "loss", the treaty's secret attachment transferred [[Lithuania]] to the Soviet sphere of influence, with the exception of a small territory in the [[Suwałki Region]], sometimes known as the Suwałki Triangle. After this transfer, the Soviet Union issued an [[1940 Soviet ultimatum to Lithuania|ultimatum to Lithuania]], occupied it on June 15, 1940 and established the [[Lithuanian SSR]].

&lt;/ref&gt; The Human Rights City initiative emerged from the global [[human rights movement]], and it reflects efforts of activist groups to improve respect for human rights principles by governments and other powerful actors who operate at the local/community level. Because of their focus on local contexts, Human Rights Cities tend to emphasize [[Economic, social and cultural rights|economic, social, and cultural rights]] as they affect the lives of residents of cities and other communities and their ability to enjoy [[Civil and political rights|civil and political human rights]].

Human rights advocates describe a Human Rights City as “One whose residents and local authorities, through learning about the relevance of human rights to their daily lives (guided by a steering committee), join in ongoing learning, discussions, systematic analysis and critical thinking at the community level, to pursue a creative exchange of ideas and the joint planning of actions to realize their economic, social, political, civil and cultural human rights.”&lt;ref&gt;''Human Rights Learning and Human Rights Cities: Achievements Report''.

== History of the Human Rights Cities movement ==
The Human Rights City initiative is the result of long-standing efforts of popular groups to defend and promote human rights, and thus represents an aspect of [[Human rights movement#Global human rights struggles|global human rights struggles]].

===Origins: From the Right to the City to the People’s Movement for Human Rights Learning===

Contemporary human rights city initiatives grow directly from earlier organizing around rights claims in urban settings. The widespread nature of [[Urban Decay#urban problems|urban problems]] affecting peoples’ everyday lives and survival have generated similar types of responses in places around the world, helping account for the simultaneous emergence and consolidation of popular claims to the “[[right to the city]]."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The ‘Right to the City’ in the Context of Shifting Mottos of Urban Social Movements|last = Meyer|first = Margit|date = 2009|journal = City|doi = 10.1080/13604810902982755|pmid = |access-date = |volume = 13|issue = 2-3|pages = 362–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[David Harvey]], “to invoke rights to the city means ‘to claim some kind of shaping power over the processes of urbanization, over the ways in which our cities are made and remade and to do so in a fundamental and radical way’."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Rebel Cities: From the Right to the City to the Urban Revolution|last = Harvey|first = David|publisher = Verso|year = 2012|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ideas inspiring this movement first emerged in the 1970s, with many influenced by [[Henri Lefebvre|Henri Lefebvre’s]] 1968 book, ''Le Droit à la ville''. The movement has expanded and gained momentum around the world since the mid-1990s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The proliferation of [[Global Financial Crisis#global financial crises|global financial crises]], urban [[austerity]], and [[environmental damage]] has contributed to the rise of a growing number of cities around the world that are referring more explicitly to international human rights in their policies, statements, and programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Austerity Urbanism: The Neoliberal Crisis of American Cities|last = Peck|first = Jamie|publisher = Rosa Luxemburg Foundation|year = 2015|isbn = |location = |pages = |url = http://www.rosalux-nyc.org/austerity-urbanism/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formally named “Human Rights Cities” initiative was launched by the People’s Movement for Human Rights Learning (PDHRE), which was formerly known as People’s Decade for Human Rights Education, in the wake of the 1993 [[World Conference on Human Rights]] in Vienna, Austria. The initiative aims to mobilize people in communities to “pursue a community-wide dialogue and to launch actions to improve the life and security of women, men and children based on human rights norms and standards.”&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Human Rights Cities: Civic Engagement for Societal Development|last = Marks|first = Stephen P.|publisher = People’s Movement for Human Rights Learning &amp; UN Habitat|year = 2008|isbn = |location = |pages = |last2 = Modrowski|last3 = Lichem|first2 = Kathleen A.|first3 = Walther|url = http://www.pdhre.org/Human_Rights_Cities_Book.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is different from the traditional way that human rights are enforced and applied because of its emphasis on popular education, engagement, and culture as a necessary complement to government enforcement.

Human Rights Cities have grown in part because of the enhanced efforts by international agencies like [[United Nations Human Settlements Programme|UN Habitat]] to connect international legal regimes with municipal programs. As a result of globalized economic development processes, cities around the world are facing a similar host of urban problems, including a lack of [[affordable housing]], [[traffic congestion]] and [[Human Security#insufficient public services|insufficient public services]]. Cities have looked to international forums like the [[United Nations Human Settlements Programme|UN Conferences on Human Settlements]]&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and the World Associations of Cities and Local Authorities&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

===Human Rights Cities international consolidation (1998 - today)===
[[File:Korea-Gwangju 5392-06.JPG|thumb|336x336px|The city of [[Gwangju]] has been a pioneer in the implementation of the human rights cities framework in [[South Korea]]n and Asia, and has coorganized since 2011 the [[World Human Rights Cities Forum of Gwangju|World Human Rights Cities Forum]].]]
1998 would suppose a breakthrough for the human rights movement both in terms of institutional consolidation as well as global outreach. At the European level, the Barcelona [[Conference Cities for Human Rights]] gathered more than 400 hundred local authorities uniting their voice and calling for a stronger political acknowledgment as key actors in safeguarding human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=European Charter for the Safeguarding of Human Rights in the City |url=https://www.uclg-cisdp.org/en/right-to-the-city/european-charter |website=UCLG Committee on Social Inclusion, Participatory Democracy and Human Rights |accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Conference process would culminate in 2 years after in the French city of [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint Denis]]&lt;!--Most likely Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis - which is not a city--&gt; by the adoption of the [[European Charter for the Safeguarding of Human Rights in the City]] (2000). By the same time, the movement of human rights cities was also taking ground in Asia, as regional civil society organizations were about to launch the [[Asia Human Rights Charter]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Asia Human Rights Charter |url=https://www.uclg-cisdp.org/sites/default/files/Asian%20Human%20Rights%20Charter%20%281998%29.pdf |accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Gwangju]], 1998). Both charters would highlight the increasing role of local actors in promoting human rights as a way to reinforce local democracy and the place of human rights in the city in an increasingly urbanized world.

After the establishment of [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Rosario]] as the first Human Rights City back in 1997, other local authorities in South America effectively embraced the human rights-based approach by placing a special emphasis on its link with the notion of [[right to the city]]. In 2001, the [[City Statute|City Statue]] of Brazil offered a renewed framework for promoting human rights and the social function of the city at a national scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.citiesalliance.org/node/1947|title=The City Statute of Brazil: A Commentary {{!}} Cities Alliance|date=2011-08-09|website=www.citiesalliance.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mexico City]] is also among the pioneers in the development of the human rights cities notion: in the last decade, it has promoted the [[Mexico City Charter for the Right to the City]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hic-gs.org/content/Mexico_Charter_R2C_2010.pdf|title=Mexico City Charter for the Right to the City|last=|first=|date=|website=UCLG Committee on Social Inclusion, Participatory Democracy and Human Rights|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; created mechanisms to monitor human rights at the local level and adopted a new constitution specifically based on the human rights approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/es/2017/02/04/ciudad-de-mexico-aprueba-su-primera-constitucion-y-estrena-nuevos-poderes/|title=Ciudad de México aprueba su primera constitución y estrena nuevos poderes|last=Linares|first=Marina Franco y Albinson|access-date=2018-06-13|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city of [[Bogotá]] was also at the forefront in the implementation of the human rights approach, with the implementation of the [[Bogotá Humana]] policy (2013-2016) which took a specific emphasis on the rights of homeless people, women and elderly population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.elespectador.com/opinion/opinion/el-adios-de-gustavo-petro-y-la-bogota-humana-columna-607861|title=El adiós de Gustavo Petro y la Bogotá Humana|date=2015-12-27|work=ELESPECTADOR.COM|access-date=2018-06-13|language=es-CO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gustavopetroblog.wordpress.com/2016/07/04/estos-son-los-colegios-de-la-bogota-humana-una-politica-educativa-que-es-hito-mundial/comment-page-1/|title=Estos son los colegios de la Bogota Humana, Una política educativa que es hito mundial.|date=2016-07-04|work=Gustavo Petro Blog|access-date=2018-06-13|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uclg-cisdp.org/en/observatory/reports/rights-approach-through-bogot%C3%A1-humana-development-plan|title=The Rights Approach through the "Bogotá Humana" Development Plan {{!}} CISDP|website=www.uclg-cisdp.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In North America, [[Montreal]] was a regional pioneer with the establishment of its local [[Montreal Charter of Rights and Responsibilities]] (2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/pls/portal/docs/page/charte_mtl_fr/media/documents/charte_montrealaise_english.pdf|title=Montreal City Charter of Rights and Responsibilities|last=|first=|date=|website=City of Monreal|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[San Francisco]] has implemented policy translates and implements locally the rights of women as defined in the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]] since 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uclg-cisdp.org/en/observatory/implementing-un-convention-women%E2%80%99s-rights-locally|title=Implementing the UN convention on women’s rights locally {{!}} CISDP|website=www.uclg-cisdp.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human rights in the United States|Human rights organizers in United States]] have nonetheless faced particular challenges due to the role of the U.S. in the world and to the U.S. failure to ratify most major [[International human rights instruments#international human rights treaties|international human rights treaties]]. However, in the 2000s, more U.S.-based activists have been working to raise international awareness of U.S. human rights violations, including [[racial discrimination in jury selection#racial discrimination|racial discrimination]] in the criminal justice system, [[Economic, social and cultural rights#economic human rights|economic human rights]] violations, and the [[Children's rights#rights of children|rights of children]]. In 2014 residents of Detroit who were losing access to clean water brought their case to the United Nations, which sent a Special Rapporteur&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/WaterAndSanitation/SRWater/Pages/SRWaterIndex.aspx|title=Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation|website=www.ohchr.org|access-date=2016-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the city and issued a statement condemning practices that inhibited residents’ [[right to water]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/10/detroit-and-the-evaporating-right-to-running-water/381731/|title=Detroit and the Evaporating Right to Running Water|last=Graham|first=David A.|website=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This issue and others have encouraged more U.S. cities, including Baltimore Maryland, Mountain View California,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mv-voice.com/news/2015/07/19/dispute-over-human-rights-measure-in-mountain-view&lt;/ref&gt; Columbia South Carolina, to consider the human rights city model.

Throughout the last years, several examples around the world show a deepening on the concept and implications of human rights cities. In South Korea, Gwangju pioneered the establishment of a human rights municipal system (2009)&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.whrcf.org/E_index.php|title=세계인권도시포럼|last=세계인권도시포럼|website=www.whrcf.org|language=ko|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was quickly followed by cities such as [[Seoul]] (2012)&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uclg-cisdp.org/en/news/latest-news/seoul-municipal-government-division-works-mainstream-rights-approach-local-public|title=In Seoul, a municipal government division works to mainstream the rights approach in local public action {{!}} CISDP|website=www.uclg-cisdp.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Busan]]. Gwangju has also been the main organizer of a [[World Human Rights Cities Forum of Gwangju|World Human Rights Cities Forum]] that has gathered hundreds of human rights cities on a yearly basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uclg-cisdp.org/en/activities/human-rights-cities/international-meetings/World-Human-Rights-Cities-Forum-of-Gwangju|title=World Human Rights Cities Forum (WHRCF) of Gwangju, South Korea {{!}} CISDP|website=www.uclg-cisdp.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; All around Europe, cities such as Barcelona, [[Madrid]], [[Graz]] or [[Utrecht]] have established mechanisms to guarantee human rights and monitor their responsibilities under international human rights standards. Particular examples in this regard can be found in local government measures such as Barcelona’s “City of Rights” programme (2016)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/premsa/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/MesuraGovernBCDrets.pdf|title=Mesura de govern "Barcelona Ciutat de Drets"|last=|first=|date=|website=City Council of Barcelona|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Madrid’s “Strategic Plan for Human Rights Cities” (2017).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://diario.madrid.es/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/PlanDDHH_PDF.pdf|title=Plan Estratégico de Derechos Humanos de Madrid|last=|first=|date=|website=City Council of Madrid|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cities and international law ==
All [[international human rights law]] is based in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], which was adopted in 1948. This document outlines the inalienable and fundamental rights of humankind that are protected regardless of gender, race, class, sexual orientation, religion, or any other social, economic, or political factor. The articles in the UDHR are not legally binding, but they are recognized as part of customary international law, and they authorize the development of binding international treaties, which countries may choose to sign and ratify. International human rights treaties and monitoring processes, however, privileges national governments and limits the role of local officials, whose cooperation in the implementation of international law is critical. The day-to-day work of implementing human rights standards often rests on the shoulders of local and regional authorities. They too are bound by these agreements. Local and regional authorities are often directly responsible for services related to health care, education, housing, water supply, environment, policing and also, in many cases, taxation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Meyer | first1 = Margit | year = 2009 | title = The 'Right to the City' in the Context of Shifting Mottos of Urban Social Movements | url = | journal = City | volume = 13 | issue = 2-3| pages = 362–74 | doi = 10.1080/13604810902982755 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

How cities implement human rights ideals varies from city to city. This allows for each city to develop a plan that is specific to its capacities, needs, problems, and concerns. Formally designated “Human Rights Cities” typically create a leadership body made up of community activists, residents, and public officials (or their appointees) working in partnership.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ips-dc.org/human_rights_city_toolkit/|title = Human Rights City Toolkit|date = March 2009|access-date = 2016-02-23|website = Institute for Policy Studies|publisher = |last = Karen|first = Dolan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other cities may adopt human rights language and standards without officially adopting the name of Human Rights City. For instance, Barcelona is a leading human right city in Europe, and it created an Office of Non-Discrimination to implement the EU anti-racial discrimination policy within its borders as part of becoming a Human Rights City.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

San Francisco is another such example, since its 1998 adoption of a city ordinance&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

=== Human Rights Council on the "role of local governments in the promotion and the protection of human rights" ===
In the last years, the advance of the human rights cities movement has been assessed by several resolutions and statements of international organizations such as the [[United Nations Human Rights Council|Human Rights Council]] or the [[Council of Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.coe.int/en/web/commissioner/local-and-regional-authorities-speeches/-/asset_publisher/igylP6fCBzxu/content/respecting-and-fulfilling-human-rights-at-the-local-level?inheritRedirect=false&amp;desktop=true|title=Respecting and fulfilling human rights at the local level|work=Commissioner for Human Rights|access-date=2018-06-14|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; A breakthrough in this regard was the adoption by the Human Rights Council of the [[United Nations Human Rights Council#Advisory Committee|Advisory Committee]] Report A/HRC/30/49 on the “Role of local governments in the promotion and the protection of human rights”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/AdvisoryCommittee/Pages/LocalGovernmentAndHR.aspx|title=OHCHR {{!}} AdvisoryCommittee Local government and human rights|website=www.ohchr.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report assessed local governments responsibilities in the light of international human rights law, but most importantly, emphasized the opportunities posed by the human rights cities movement in promoting and protecting human rights due to their close relation with the needs and aspirations of city inhabitants. The Report promoted local governments participation in the drafting of national human rights strategies, and called to secure the necessary powers and financial resources for local administration to be able to comply with their human rights responsibilities. It enshrined as best practices the initiatives of various local governments and promoted networking as a way to advance the human rights cities movement, including some examples and best practices such as the [[World Human Rights Cities Forum of Gwangju]] or the [[Global Charter-Agenda for Human Rights in the City]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uclg-cisdp.org/en/activities/human-rights-cities/advocacy|title=International advocacy: Local governments are key for the promotion and the protection of human rights {{!}} CISDP|website=www.uclg-cisdp.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote
|text=Local authorities are close to citizens’ everyday needs and they deal with human right issues on an everyday basis. Therefore, there exists a clear and strong connection between human rights and local government. When performing their functions, local authorities take decisions relating in particular to education, housing, health, the environment, and law and order, which are directly connected with the implementation of human rights and which may enforce or weaken the possibilities of its inhabitants to enjoy their human rights. Furthermore, local government is always facing the risk of discriminatory practices against perceived outsiders, such as immigrants or ethnic minorities, to the local community.

As the world representative of local and regional governments, the [[Committee on Social Inclusion, Participative Democracy and Human Rights|UCLG Committee on Social Inclusion, Participatory Democracy and Human Rights]] has for instance presented various statements to the Council and shared the Report’s recommendations among its constituency.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2016, the Human Rights Council adopted a resolution (A/HRC/RES/33/8) “Recognizing the role of local government in the promotion and protection of human rights” and that “given its proximity to people and being at the grass-roots level, one of the important functions of local government is to provide public services that address local needs and priorities related to the realization of human rights at the local level”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/RegularSessions/Session33/Pages/ResDecStat.aspx|title=OHCHR - Session 33: Resolutions, decisions and President’s statements|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ohchr.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2017, the same Council organized an intersessional panel discussion on the Report and the most recent advances in its implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/Pages/PanelRoleLocalGovernment.aspx|title=OHCHR - HRC: Panel discussion on role of local government, 4 September 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ohchr.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Work by international human rights activists and by policymakers in the United Nations has helped spread ideas about how city governments can improve human rights implementation. In 2004, UNESCO helped establish the International Coalition of Cities against Racism&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/social-and-human-sciences/themes/fight-against-discrimination/coalition-of-cities/|title=International Coalition of Cities against Racism {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|access-date=2016-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; to help municipal leaders exchange ideas and improve policies to fight [[racism]], [[discrimination]], [[xenophobia]] and [[social exclusion#exclusion|exclusion]]. The European Coalition of Cities against Racism (ECCAR)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eccar.info/|title=ECCAR|website=ECCAR|access-date=2016-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; grew out of that effort, and it now has more than 104 municipalities in its membership and has adopted a ten-point action plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eccar.info/10-point-plan-action|title=10 Points Action Plan|last=|website=ECCAR|language=en|access-date=2016-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the [[Committee on Social Inclusion, Participative Democracy and Human Rights|UCLG Committee on Social Inclusion, Participatory Democracy and Human Rights]] was created in the framework of the largest organization and world representative of local governments: [[United Cities and Local Governments]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uclg-cisdp.org/en/committee/strategic-plan/background|title=Background {{!}} CISDP|website=www.uclg-cisdp.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee represents and facilitates the exchange between worldwide local authorities having a strong agenda on human rights ([[Mexico City]] and [[Gwangju]] were for instance two of its co-chairs in 2018). As relevant outcomes of more than 10 years of work for advancing the notion and recognition of human rights cities, the Committee has been in charge of the follow-up of the [[European Charter for the Safeguarding of Human Rights in the City]] and has created and promoted the [[Global Charter Agenda for Human Rights in the City]]. It has also carried out a strong political advocacy at a UN level for the recognition of local governments as key actors in the promotion and protection of human rights, and co-organized yearly a [[World Human Rights Cities Forum of Gwangju|World Human Rights Cities Forum]].

Another relevant example in regards to concrete partnerships for advancing the human rights cities agenda are the so-called “action-research centers”. In this case, a local research center is generally at the forefront of mobilizing local authorities for the implementation of human rights at the local level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kks.verdus.nl/upload/documents/HRC-Book.pdf|title=Human rights cities: Motivations, mechanisms and implications|last=|first=|date=|website=Kennis voor Krachtige Steden (KKS)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relevant examples in this regard can be found at a European&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yorkhumanrights.org/|title=York: Human Rights City - York Human Rights City|website=York Human Rights City|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rwi.lu.se/2016/09/lund-can-become-swedens-first-human-rights-city/|title=Lund Can Become Sweden’s First Human Rights City|website=rwi.lu.se|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.etc-graz.at/typo3/index.php?id=1011|title=ETC Graz: Human Rights City of Graz|website=www.etc-graz.at|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.uu.nl/en/research/netherlands-institute-of-human-rights-sim|title=Netherlands Institute of Human Rights (SIM)|date=2017-05-03|work=Utrecht University|access-date=2018-06-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and North American&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ushrnetwork.org/our-work/project/national-human-rights-cities-alliance|title=National Human Rights Cities Alliance|date=2016-02-26|work=US Human Rights Network|access-date=2018-06-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ushrnetwork.org/resources-media/pittsburgh-human-rights-city-alliance-website|title=Pittsburgh Human Rights City Alliance Website|date=2015-09-15|work=US Human Rights Network|access-date=2018-06-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; levels. One of the most advanced examples on how can a local research center scale up and become a global actor in the promotion of the human rights agenda is the [[Raoul Wallenberg Institute of Human Rights and Humanitarian Law|Raoul Wallenberg Institute]]. Although being affiliated to [[Lund University]] since 1984, the Institute's outreach has nonetheless gone beyond its local or even national level, as it now carries out projects in different regions of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rwi.lu.se/|title=Raoul Wallenberg Institute of Human Rights|website=rwi.lu.se|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3193">'''Joseph Mélèze-Modrzejewski''' (Józef Mélèze-Modrzejewski, 8 March 1930 in [[Lublin]] – 29 January 2017) was a Polish-French historian and professor of ancient history at the [[Pantheon-Sorbonne University]].

== Career ==
Joseph Mélèze-Modrzejewski began his scientific career in [[Poland]] as a student of [[Rafał Taubenschlag]]. After his arrtival in [[France]] in 1958,he taught for thirty years the legal and social history of the [[Hellenistic world]] at the Faculty of Law of Paris and at the [[Sorbonne]]. Then following his retirement from the University in 1999, Mélèze-Modrzejewski continued for 5 years to lead a seminar on [[papyrology]] and history of rignts from ancient times at the [[École pratique des hautes études]] (IV&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; Section, historical and philological sciences) established in 1972.

From 1979 to 2010, Mélèze-Modrzejewski taught the history of post-[[Exilic]] [[Judaism]] at the [[Université libre de Bruxelles]] (Institute of Jewish Studies [[Martin Buber]]). His workS - some 400 books, articles, minutes and chronicles since 1951 - focus on various aspects of the history of law and institutions of antiquity, especially the legal and social history of [[Greek Egypt|Greek]] and [[Roman Egypt]] in light of papyrological sources, as well as the history of Judaism at the time of [[the Second Temple]].  As the director of the ''Revue historique de droit français et étranger'', he participated in the management of several international journals in the field of the history of law and institutions.

{{Professional responsibility}}
'''Judicial misconduct''' occurs when a [[judge]] acts in ways that are considered unethical or otherwise violate the judge's obligations of impartial conduct.

Actions that can be classified as judicial misconduct include: conduct prejudicial to the effective and expeditious administration of the business of the courts (as an extreme example: "falsification of facts" at [[summary judgment]]); using the judge's office to obtain special treatment for friends or relatives; accepting [[bribe]]s, [[gift]]s, or other personal favors related to the judicial office; having improper discussions with parties or counsel for one side in a case; treating [[litigant]]s or [[lawyer|attorney]]s in a demonstrably egregious and hostile manner; violating other specific, mandatory standards of judicial conduct, such as judicial rules of procedure or evidence, or those pertaining to restrictions on outside income and requirements for financial disclosure; and acting outside the jurisdiction of the court, or performance of official duties if the conduct might have a prejudicial effect on the administration of the business of the courts among reasonable people.  Rules of official misconduct also include rules concerning disability, which is a temporary or permanent condition rendering judge unable to discharge the duties of the particular judicial office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/judicialmisconduct.aspx Judicial Misconduct Rules] – United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit&lt;/ref&gt;

Judicial misconduct leads only seldom to a formal investigation. A court decision is not beyond critique. Defendants may be coaxed to enter into plea bargains that rob the public from a fair trial and from knowing the truth. Court decisions cannot be assumed just. They are subject to critical public appraisal as any human decision.

==In the UK==
In the UK Judicial misconduct is investigated by the [[Judicial Conduct Investigations Office]].

==In the USA==
A judicial investigative committee is a panel of judges selected to investigate a judicial misconduct complaint against a judge accused of judicial misconduct. Judicial investigative committees are rarely appointed. According to U.S. Court statistics, only 18 of the 1,484 judicial misconduct complaints filed in the United States Courts between September 2004 and September 2007 warranted the formation of judicial investigative committees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/6054972.html From nude photos to lying: Federal judges under scrutiny] Houston Chronicle, October 13, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Lex loci rei sitae''''' ([[Latin]] for "law of the place where the property is situated"), or simply '''''lex situs''''',&lt;ref&gt;https://definitions.uslegal.com/l/lex-loci-rei-sitae/ Lex Loci Rei Sitae Law and Legal Definition]&lt;/ref&gt; is the doctrine that the law governing the transfer of title to property is dependent upon and varies with the location of the property, for the purposes of the [[conflict of laws]]. Conflict is the branch of [[public law]] regulating all [[lawsuit]]s involving a "foreign" law element if a difference in result will occur, depending on which laws are applied.

'''Malwarebytes''' Inc. is an American Internet security company with offices in [[Santa Clara, California]], [[Clearwater, Florida]], [[Tallinn, Estonia]] and [[Cork (city)|Cork, Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://jobs.malwarebytes.com/|title=Malwarebytes – Talent Community|website=jobs.Malwarebytes.com|access-date=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It specializes in protecting home computers, smartphones, and companies.

Malwarebytes was formally established in January 2008 by [[Marcin Kleczynski]] and Bruce Harrison, who are the CEO and Vice President of Research for Malwarebytes respectively, though the origins of the company date back to 2004, when Kleczynski became involved in forums discussing computer viruses. In 2011, Malwarebytes acquired HPhosts, a website [[blacklisting]] company, which tracks blacklisted websites and ad servers. In June 2015, the company announced that it was moving its headquarters from 10 Almaden Boulevard in [[San Jose, California]] to a new {{convert|52000|ft2|adj=on}} office space on the two top floors of the 12-story 3979 Freedom Circle in Santa Clara. The company reported a growth of 10 million users in just one year in 2014–2015 and an increase in revenue by 1653% in 2014. By 2015 Malwarebytes had fixed over 250 million computers and over five billion malware threats worldwide.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}
 
Several of Malwarebytes's products have become well known in the computer world. [[Malwarebytes Anti-Malware]] is available in two different versions, one for free download for home computers, and the other a professional version, with a 14-day free trial in advance. Malwarebytes Anti-Exploit uses exploit mitigation to protect vulnerable programs from attack. Endpoint Security, an advanced anti-ransomware technology package, was unveiled in January 2016.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

These three products have been incorporated into a single program called Malwarebytes 3.0 Premium, which is a paid program with a 14-day free trial period. Malwarebytes Anti-Exploit is no longer available as a free standalone product.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://malwarebytessupport.simpsite.nl/|title=Malwarebytes for Pc|last=Katherine|first=Styne|date=January 18, 2018|editor-link=http://www.antivirussupport-number.com/|website=Malwarebytes Antivirus support|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Early history and background===
Malwarebytes Inc. was informally established in 2004.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=107793539|title=Company Overview of Malwarebytes Corporation|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; CEO and founder [[Marcin Kleczynski]], originally from Poland, was still a teenager attending high school in [[Bensenville, Illinois]] at the time, and was working as a technician in a computer repair shop in Chicago.&lt;ref name="mercurynews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_26175456/q-marcin-kleczynski-ceo-malwarebytes-cybersecurity-and-startups|title=Q&amp;A: Marcin Kleczynski, CEO of Malwarebytes, on cybersecurity and startups|work=mercurynews.com|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He noticed that whenever infected computers arrived, they would generally reformat the computer, regardless if the infection was only minor. It was only when his mother's computer became infected that Kleczynski learned more about why the virus wasn't directly attacked, finding that neither [[McAfee]] nor [[Symantec]] would remove the malware from his system.&lt;ref name="TS12"/&gt; He later recalled "I've never been as angry as when I got my computer infected", and professed that his mother told him to fix it "under penalty of death".&lt;ref name="SVBJ15"/&gt; It was only after Kleczynski posted on the forum SpywareInfo, popular at the time, that he was able to learn how to cure it, which took three days. The company was unofficially founded after this, when Kleczynski conversed and became friends with several of the editors of the forum, who tempted him to buy an unused domain from them.&lt;ref name="TS12"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techspot.com/article/581-malwarebytes-marcin-kleczynski-interview/|title=Interview with Malwarebytes' founder, Marcin Kleczynski|publisher=Techspot|date=11 October 2012|accessdate=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With one of the site's regulars, Bruce Harrison, Kleczynski wrote the inaugural version of the company's software.&lt;ref name="SVBJ15"/&gt; In 2006, worked with a college roommate to produce a freely available program called "RogueRemover", a utility which specialized in fighting against a type of infection known as "rogues", which scam computer users into giving away their credit card information through fake anti-virus software. RogueRemover proved instrumental in developing Malwarebytes Anti-Malware, and Kleczynski was able to set up a forum which enabled him to improve the software through feedback.&lt;ref name="TS12"/&gt; Kleczynski and Harrison formally launched Malwarebytes on January 21, 2008 while Kleczynski was studying computer science at the [[University of Illinois]].&lt;ref name="TS12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SVBJ15"/&gt; Bruce became the VP of Research for Malwarebytes, and further hired Doug Swanson, with experience in freeware development to work for the new company. Marcus Chung, an e-commerce expert who formerly worked for GreenBorder, was hired as chief operating officer.&lt;ref name="TS12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="venturebeat11"/&gt;  Kleczynski and Harrison reportedly made $600,000 in their first year of selling the software, despite not having met personally at the time.&lt;ref name="TC0116"/&gt;

===Post-2010 developments===
In 2011, Malwarebytes acquired HPhosts, a website [[blacklisting]] company, which tracks blacklisted websites and ad servers, a necessary development to protect against new internet protocol addresses and web servers which distribute malware, and advise internet service providers to shut down those with malicious activity.&lt;ref name="NYT11"/&gt; That year, the company had claimed to have removed over five billion pieces of Malware in three years.&lt;ref name="venturebeat11"/&gt; The following year, the company launched into the corporate market with an [[enterprise (computer)|enterprise]] product aimed at desktop-based anti-malware detection and protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.networkworld.com/article/2159917/network-security/malwarebytes-offers-enterprise-anti-malware-detection--prevention.html|title=Malwarebytes offers enterprise anti-malware detection, prevention|author=Ellen Messmer|date=17 September 2012|work=Network World|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Malwarebytes acquired ZeroVulnerabilityLabs, Inc., a security research and development company founded by Pedro Bustamante, which protects software applications from "known and zero-day exploits used by exploit kits, web-based vulnerability exploits and other corporate-targeted attacks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://press.malwarebytes.com/2013/06/20/malwarebytes-completes-acquisition-of-zerovulnerabilitylabs/|title=Malwarebytes Completes Acquisition of ZeroVulnerabilityLabs|date=20 June 2013|accessdate=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They expanded their malware removal and protection to the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] platform with the launch of Malwarebytes Anti-Malware [[Mobile phone|Mobile]],&lt;ref name="michaelkassner"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/it-security/malwarebytes-anti-malware-mobile-now-protects-android-devices/|title=Malwarebytes Anti-Malware Mobile now protects Android devices|author=Michael Kassner|date=21 October 2013|work=TechRepublic|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and launched a [[USB]]-based product called Malwarebytes Techbench aimed at helping technicians remove malware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.net-security.org/malware_news.php?id=2605|title=Portable USB drive fixes malware-crippled machines|work=net-security.org|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Malwarebytes received $30 million in funding from Highland Capital, and by the following year it announced that it had treated 250 million computers worldwide, representing about 20–25% of working business computers.&lt;ref name="TC0116"/&gt; By 2013 it claimed to have removed five billion malware threats from computers in its first five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmagazineuk.com/five-billion-strikes-in-five-years-for-malwarebytes/article/276629/|title=Five billion strikes in five years for Malwarebytes|publisher=''SC Magazine''|date=21 January 2013|accessdate=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2015, the company announced that it was moving its headquarters from 10 Almaden Boulevard in [[San Jose, California]] to a new {{convert|52000|ft2}} office space on the two top floors of the 12-story 3979 Freedom Circle in [[Santa Clara, California]]. The new office is more than twice the size of the former office. The company reported a growth of 10 million users in just one year, from 25 to 35 million active users at the time, and an increase in revenue by 1653% in 2014.&lt;ref name="SVBJ15"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2015/06/16/malwarebytes-grows-out-of-downtown-san-jose-as.html|title=Malwarebytes grows out of downtown San Jose as demand for virus protection soars|publisher=Silicon Valley Business Journal|date=16 June 2015|accessdate=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Kleczynski was named one of [[Forbes]] Magazine's '30 Under 30'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/pictures/mll45kfhf/marcin-kleczynski-25/|title=Marcin Kleczynski, 25 – In Photos: 2015 30 Under 30: Enterprise Technology|author=Upbin, Bruce|work=Forbes|accessdate=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016, Malwarebytes unveiled advanced anti-ransomware package Endpoint Security,&lt;ref name="BW16"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160803005539/en/Malwarebytes-Endpoint-Security-Protects-Businesses-Current-Future|title=Malwarebytes Endpoint Security Now Protects Businesses Against Current and Future Ransomware Threats|publisher=BusinessWire|accessdate=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and announced that it had raised $50 million in investment from Fidelity Management and Research Company. Kleczynski stated that the funds would be used primarily for the company's hiring, product development and marketing assets.&lt;ref name="TC0116"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/21/security-startup-malwarebytes-raises-another-50m-from-fidelity/|title=Security Startup Malwarebytes Raises Another $50M From Fidelity|publisher=''Tech Crunch''|author=Lunden, Ingrid|date=21 January 2016|accessdate=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June, Malwarebytes announced a strong growth in sales of over 75 percent in the first quarter of the year compared to 2015, with billings surpassing $100 million. The corporate subscription base for the company was reported to have grown by 90%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160629005436/en/Malwarebytes-Sales-Grow-75-Percent-Q1|title= Malwarebytes Sales Grow by 75 Percent in Q1|publisher=''BusinessWire''|date=29 June 2016|accessdate=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In September, [[Proofpoint, Inc.]] CEO Gary Steele joined the company's Board of Directors, with Kleczynski citing his "deep expertise in the security software industry, and his proven ability [at] increasing sales revenue" as the main reasons for his appointment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/3068700|title=Proofpoint CEO Gary Steele Joins Malwarebytes Board of Directors|publisher=''Digital Journal''|date=13 September 2016|accessdate=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October the company purchased AdwCleaner, a Windows program used to clean [[adware]] from computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ghacks.net/2016/10/21/malwarebytes-acquires-adwcleaner/|title=Malwarebytes acquires AdwCleaner|publisher=Ghacks.net|date=21 October 2016|accessdate=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2017 the company acquired Saferbytes, an Italian security start-up specialized in anti-malware, anti-exploit, anti-rootkit, cloud AV, and sandbox technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://press.malwarebytes.com/2017/02/07/malwarebytes-acquires-saferbytes/|title=Malwarebytes acquires Saferbytes|publisher=press.malwarebytes.com|date=7 February 2017|accessdate=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, Malwarebytes Anti-Malware was updated. It was built from the ground up and they combined their 3 flagship products (Anti-Malware, Anti-Exploit and Anti-Ransomware). They renamed Malwarebytes Anti-Malware to Malwarebytes. Malwarebytes now also functions as an anti-virus according to their release statement.

==Services and products==
CEO Marcin Kleczynski states that the Malwarebytes engine has an advantage over many of the traditional antivirus programs because it was developed in 2008, when many of the others were developed in the late 1990s and had little idea of what malware would look like 15 years down the line. He states that this makes it "easier for us to adapt as malware evolves".&lt;ref name="TS12"/&gt; ''The New York Times'' describes their system as a "hybrid of heuristics, behavior and a signature engine that is designed to detect and block malware that other vendors can't detect".&lt;ref name="NYT11"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/external/venturebeat/2011/07/18/18venturebeat-malwarebytes-quietly-becomes-a-big-player-in-29261.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss|title=Malwarebytes Quietly Becomes a Big Player in Anti-Malware Software|publisher=''The New York Times''|date=18 July 2011|accessdate=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dean Takahashi of ''[[VentureBeat]]'', Malwarebytes complements other antivirus software from vendors such as Symantec and McAfee, with the anti-malware working with the anti-virus software to attack the problem from "different directions". He remarked that Malwarebytes "cleans off machines that are already infected", while "the pro version stops your machine from getting infected in the first place".&lt;ref name="venturebeat11"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2011/07/18/malwarebytes-quietly-becomes-a-big-player-in-anti-malware-software/|title=Malwarebytes quietly becomes a big player in anti-malware software – VentureBeat – News – by Dean Takahashi|publisher=''VentureBeat''|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in the early development days with RogueRemover, Malwarebytes thrives on community feedback. It runs two sub-forums complementing the main forum, known as "False positives" and "Malware contribution", with the false positives being reported allowing the company to update its database within just hours, and the Malware contribution allowing for them to quickly report what is missing and download it.&lt;ref name="TS12"/&gt; Kleczynski had been quoted as saying, "We still try to work like a bootstrapped company. We'd rather build products that our customers buy rather than we sell to them something they may not need.”&lt;ref name="TC0116"/&gt;

===Products===

Malwarebytes has several products, which as of 2011 were available in 36 different languages.

In July 2015, Malwarebytes acquired AdwareMedic and released Malwarebytes Anti-Malware for Mac, which detects malware, [[adware]], and [[potentially unwanted programs]] on [[Macintosh]] computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Malwarebytes Releases Mac Product and Acquires AdwareMedic Giving Mac Users Malware Detection and Removal Capabilities|url=https://press.malwarebytes.com/2015/07/15/malwarebytes-releases-mac-product-and-acquires-adwaremedic-giving-mac-users-malware-detection-and-removal-capabilities/|website=Malwarebytes Press Center|accessdate=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016, Malwarebytes unveiled Malwarebytes Endpoint Security, advanced anti-ransomware technology which is described as the "first solution to offer multiple layers of protection against unknown ransomware". The company sponsored a survey with [[Osterman Research]] into 540 firms in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and Germany and found that nearly 40% of companies had experienced ransomeware incidents, of which 34 percent had accounted for loss of revenue.&lt;ref name="BW16"/&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that one-fifth of British companies had been charged over $10,000 to unlock their files and that there was an increasing demand for anti-ransomeware technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/03/ransomware-threat-on-the-rise-as-40-of-businesses-attacked|title=Ransomware threat on the rise as 'almost 40% of businesses attacked'|publisher=''The Guardian''|date=3 August 2016|accessdate=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Endpoint's inception, the beta was reportedly downloaded by some 200,000 businesses and consumers in the first six months of the year.&lt;ref name="BW16"/&gt;

Malwarebytes also has numerous tools such as a Junkware Removal Tool to remove adware, an Anti-Rootkit Beta to remove and repair rootkits, StartUpLITE to boost the speed of the Windows reboot and FileASSASSIN to prevent locked files.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg"/&gt;

===License and Privacy===
The License&lt;ref name="licmal"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.malwarebytes.com/eula/ |title=Malwarebytes Software License Agreement, undated |access-date=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; requires arbitration "in the county where you reside", forbids class action suits, reverse engineering and sharing, and limits warranties and liability. Even the free version may not be shared, since they track use separately for each user.

The Privacy Policy&lt;ref name="privmal"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.malwarebytes.com/privacy/ |title=Malwarebytes Privacy Policy |publication-date=2016-12-08 |access-date=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; lists many types of information they collect and store, including other software running on a user's computer ("programs installed or in use"). Malwarebytes says they collect "name, email address, mailing address, or phone number... company name, company size, business type... Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, the files viewed on our site ... operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data ... type of device you use, operating system version, and the unique device identifier... language... 32- or 64-bit... Information from the Windows Security/Action Center, including security settings and programs installed or in use... license... If it represents a console system, the number of seats being managed by that installation of the console[,] Endpoint domain information... organization to which the IP address is licensed, if any".&lt;ref name="privmal" /&gt;

There are different limits on their use, sale, and sharing of data:
*No limits for what they call "non-personally identifiable information ('Non-PII')". "Non-PII ... may include... anonymously generated device identifiers",&lt;ref name="privmal" /&gt; which are tied to most other data items listed above.
*Limited uses for personally identifiable information (PII), including name, address, phone, company name, size and business type, "we do not share PII with third parties" except for situations listed in the Privacy Policy, which include that they "may disclose PII to government ... and private parties ... to satisfy... regulation ... subpoenas... to protect ... the public in general; ... to prevent or stop activity we consider to be illegal or unethical."&lt;ref name="privmal" /&gt; They also disclose enough information to provide "advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests."&lt;ref name="privmal" /&gt;

In general they do not put time limits on how long they keep data, except for IP address or when users ask for deletion of PII: 
*"we do not retain the IP address... However, we do use it to gather ... continent, country, city, and approximate latitude/ longitude ... The type of connection (dialup/broadband/satellite/mobile) The ISP... The organization to which the IP address is licensed, if any".&lt;ref name="privmal" /&gt;
*"You may access and modify the PII [personally identifiable information]... If you want us to delete your PII... We will delete your information as soon as possible; however, some information may remain in archived/backup copies for our records or as otherwise required by law. We may retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements."&lt;ref name="privmal" /&gt; They define PII to exclude device identifiers, so they do not promise to delete these identifiers and user history.

While the above text says they save locations of IP addresses, including for mobile devices, they do not go further and get GPS locations from mobile devices, "We do not ask for, access or track any location based information from your mobile device at any time while downloading or using our Mobile Apps or Services."&lt;ref name="privmal" /&gt; They do not say if they get antenna locations.

They also collect detailed information on malware and exploits they find, tied to the user's license number and device identifier, "vendor... File path of exploit process... Command-line arguments passed to the exploit... (Potentially) a copy of the exploit executable itself".&lt;ref name="privmal" /&gt; They do not list the license number as PII.

They have a certificate from TRUSTe, which among other things certifies the company "Limits the information collected and limits use to what is specified in the privacy notice."&lt;ref name="truste"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://privacy.truste.com/privacy-seal/validation?rid=cb468581-5176-4a12-aa83-e39179c9929d |title=Privacy practices and standards, undated |access-date=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Admiralty law}}
The '''Maritime Labour Convention (MLC)''' is an [[International Labour Organization]] [[multilateral treaty|convention]], number 186, established in 2006 as the ''fourth pillar'' of international maritime law and embodies "all up-to-date standards of existing international maritime labour Conventions and Recommendations, as well as the fundamental principles to be found in other international labour Conventions".&lt;ref name=treaty/&gt; The other "pillars are the [[International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS)|SOLAS]], [[STCW]] and [[MARPOL]]. The treaties applies to all ships entering the harbours of parties to the treaty (port states), as well as to all states flying the flag of state party (flag states, as of 2013: 50 per cent).

The convention entered into force on 20 August 2013, one year after registering 30 ratifications of countries representing over 33 per cent of the world gross tonnage of ships.&lt;ref name=EIF&gt;{{cite news|publisher=ILO|title=Philippines ratification marks global milestone for decent work for seafarers|url=http://www.ilo.org/global/standards/maritime-labour-convention/WCMS_187712/lang--en/index.htm|accessdate=21 August 2012|date=20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Already after five ratifications the ratifying countries (Bahamas, Norway, Liberia, Marshall Islands, and Panama) represented over 43 per cent of the gross world tonnage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Panama and Norway ratify Maritime Labour Convention|url=http://worldmaritimenews.com/archives/12536|date=12 February 2009|accessdate=30 October 2010|publisher=worldmaritimenews.com|quote=Together the five flags represent 43-cent of the world's shipping tonnage.}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which is over 33 per cent; the second requirement for entry into force). As of September 2018, the convention has been ratified by 88 states representing over 93 per cent of global shipping.

Although the Convention has not been ratified worldwide, it has widespread effect because vessels from non-signatory states that attempt to enter ports of signatory states may face arrest and penalties for non-compliance with the MLC.

==Content and Organization==
The convention consists of the ''sixteen articles'' containing general provisions as well as the ''Code''. The Code consists of five ''Titles'' in which specific provisions are grouped by standard (or in Title 5: mode of enforcement):
*Title 1: Minimum requirements for seafarers to work on a ship
*Title 2: Conditions of employment
*Title 3: Accommodation, recreational facilities, food and catering
*Title 4: Health protection, medical care, welfare and social security protection
*Title 5: Compliance and enforcement
For Each Title, there are general ''Regulations'', which are further specified in mandatory ''Standards'' (list A) as well as ''Guidelines'' (List B). Guidelines generally form a form of implementation of a Regulation according to the requirements, but States are free to have different implementation measures. Regulations and Standards should in principle be implemented fully, but a country can implement a "substantially equivalent" regulation, which it should declare upon ratification.

Some seafarers criticize the convention, saying that it lacks teeth, does not address real issues, and skirts important seafarer needs such as decent sized cabins, cupboards in cabins, shore leave, and rest hours by including them into Guidelines (List B) of the convention—or worse, by not addressing them at all.&lt;ref name = lavelle&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lavelle|first1=Jennifer|title=The Maritime Labour Convention 2006: International labour law redefined|publisher=Informa Law Routledge|location=London|url=http://www.seacurus.com/newsletter/Seacurus_Issue_30.pdf|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Title 1: Minimum requirements for seafarers to work on a ship===
The minimum requirements set out in this section of the code are divided in 4 parts and are summarized below:
*''Minimum age requirements'': the minimum age is 16 years (18 for night work and work in hazardous areas).
*''Medical fitness'': workers should be medically fit for the duties they are performing. Countries should issue medical certificates as defined in the [[STCW]] (or use a similar standard).
*''Training'': Seafarers should be trained for their duties as well as have had a personal safety training.
*''Recruitment/placement services'' located in member states or for ships flying the flag of member states should have (among others) proper placement procedures, registration, complaint procedures and compensation if the recruitment fails

===Title 2: Employment conditions===
The Title on employment conditions lists conditions of the contract and payments, as well as the working conditions on ships. 
*''Contracts'': the contract should be clear, legally enforceable and incorporate [[collective bargaining agreements]] (if existent).
*''Payments'': Wages should be paid at least every month, and should be transferable regularly to family if so desired.
*''Rest hours'': rest hours should be implemented in national legislation. The maximum hours of work in that legislation should not exceed 14 hours in any 24-hour period and 72 hours in any seven-day period, or: at least ten hours of rest in any 24-hour period and 77 hours (rest) in any seven-day period. Furthermore, the daily hours of rest may not be divided into more than two periods and, at least six hours of rest should be given consecutively in one of those two periods.
*''Leave'': Seafarers have a right to annual leave as well as shore leave.
*''Repatriation'': Returning to their country of residence should be free.
*''Loss'': If a ship is lost or foundered, the seafarers have a right to an unemployment payments.
*''Manning'': Every ship should have a sufficient manning level.
*''Development and opportunities'': Every seafarer has a right to be promoted during his career except in cases where there is a violation of a statute or code of conduct, which inevitably hinders such promotion. Also, skill development and employment opportunities should be made available for each and every seafarer.

===Title 3: Accommodation, Recreational Facilities, Food and Catering===
The title specifies rules detailed rules for accommodation and recreational facilities, as well as food and catering. 
*''Accommodation'': Accommodation for living and/or working should be "promoting the seafarers' health and well-being". Detailed provisions (in rules and guidelines) give minimum requirements for various types of rooms (mess rooms, recreational rooms, dorms etc.).
*''Food and Catering'': Both food quality and quantity, including water should be regulated in the flag state. Furthermore, cooks should have proper training.

===Title 4: Health Protection, Medical Care, Welfare and Social Security Protection===
Title 4 consists of 5 regulations about Health, Liability, Medical care, Welfare and Social security. 
*''Medical care on board ship and ashore'': Seafarers should be covered for and have access to medical care while on board; in principle at no cost and of a quality comparable to the standards of health care on shore. Countries through which territory a ship is passing should guarantee treatment on shore in serious cases.
*''Shipowners' liability'': Seafarers should be protected from the financial effects of "sickness, injury or death occurring in connection with their employment". This includes at least 16 weeks of payment of wages after start of sickness.
*''Health and safety protection and accident prevention'': A safe and hygienic environment should be provided to seafarers both during working and resting hours and measures should be taken to take reasonable safety measures.
*''Access to shore-based welfare facilities'': Port states should provide "welfare, cultural, recreational and information facilities and services" and to provide easy access to these services. The access to these facilities should be open to all seafarers irrespective of race, sex, religion or political opinion.
*''Social security'': Social security coverage should be available to seafarers (and in case it is customary in the flag state: their relatives).

===Title 5: Compliance and Enforcement===
Title 5 sets standards to ensure compliance with the convention. The title distinguishes requirements for [[flag state]] and [[port state control]]. 
*''Flag states'': Flag states (the state under which flag the ship operates) are responsible for ensuring implementation of the rules on the ships that fly its flag. Detailed inspections result in the issue of a "Certificate of Maritime Compliance", which should always be present (and valid) on a ship.  Ships are required to have decent complaints procedures in place for its crew and should institute investigations in case of casualties.
*''Port States'': The inspection in ports depends on whether a Certificate of Maritime Compliance is present (and thus a flag is flown of a country which has ratified the convention). If the Certificate is present, compliance is to be assumed in principle, and further investigations only take place if the certificate is not in order or there are indications of non-compliance. For ships that don't have the certificate, inspections are much more detailed and should ensure -according to a "no more favorable treatment principle"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iflos.org/media/80198/abstracts%20speakers.pdf|title=ILO Maritime Labour Convention, 2006, Abstract|author=George Politakis|work=International Foundation for the Law of the Sea|accessdate=31 August 2012}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; that the ship has complied with the provisions of the convention. The convention is thus -indirectly- also valid for ships of non-member countries if they plan to call to ports of a member state.
*''Labour agencies'': Agencies supplying on maritime workers to ships should also be inspected to ensure that they apply the convention (among others the regulations regarding to social security).

==Negotiations==
After [[tripartism|tripartite]] negotiations had started in 2001, the convention was adopted during the 94th International Labour Convention in 2006. The convention received 314 votes in favour and none against by representatives of the government, [[Employers' organization|employers]] and workers, who each held a single vote per country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/mca/mcga07-home/workingatsea/mcga-healthandsafety/maritime_labour_convention_2006.htm|work=[[Government of the United Kingdom]]|title=Maritime Labour Convention, 2006|accessdate=9 October 2011|date=16 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of September 2018, the treaty has been ratified by 84 countries, many of which are large [[flag state]]s in terms of the tonnage they transport. The [[European Union]] advised its (then) 27 members to ratify the treaty by 31 December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32007D0431:EN:NOT|title=2007/431/EC: Council Decision of 7 June 2007 authorising Member States to ratify, in the interests of the European Community, the Maritime Labour Convention, 2006, of the International Labour Organisation|accessdate=30 October 2010|publisher=[[Council of the European Union]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EU Decision provides: "Member States are hereby authorised to ratify, for the parts falling under Community competence, the Maritime Labour Convention, 2006, of the International Labour Organisation, adopted on 7 February 2006. Member States should make efforts to take the necessary steps to deposit their instruments of ratification of the Convention with the Director-General of the International Labour Office as soon as possible, preferably before 31 December 2010." As of September 2018, 24 countries &lt;!-- this list for administration purposes only: Belgium, Bulgaria, [Croatia], Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom--&gt; had done so, while Croatia did so before it entered the European Union.&lt;ref name=treaty&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/cgi-lex/convde.pl?C186|title=Treaty text of the Maritime Labour Convention|publisher=[[ILO]]|accessdate=7 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420215217/http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/cgi-lex/convde.pl?C186#|archive-date=20 April 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The convention entered into force on 20 August 2013 for the 30 countries that ratified it prior to 20 August 2013. For other countries, the convention enters into force one year after registration of their instrument of ratification.

==Effect on other conventions==
The convention changed the status of 37 ILO conventions, which meant that these conventions upon entry into force of this convention will close for ratification (if not already) and that entry into force for a specific country meant automatic denouncement the other conventions (if not already).

==Criticism==
While the authors of MLC 2006 called it the fourth pillar of maritime policy, many seafarers themselves and industry bodies saw it as a rather weak convention which did not materially change life at sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The International Labour Organization's Maritime Labour Convention (MLC, 2006) comes into force today|url=http://www.maritimesun.com/news/the-international-labour-organizations-maritime-labour-convention-mlc-2006-comes-into-force-today|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827193058/http://www.maritimesun.com/news/the-international-labour-organizations-maritime-labour-convention-mlc-2006-comes-into-force-today|dead-url=yes|archive-date=27 August 2013|accessdate=25 November 2014|agency=The Maritime Sun|date=24 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this perspective, the more important parts of the convention have been placed in the non-mandatory section "B"; other issues, such as air conditioning or interpretations of what could be termed as good nutritious food, are not addressed by the convention. Some seafarers have complained that the convention does not carry any stipulations to make the crew cabins on cargo ships any bigger than they currently are and does not increase the number of cupboards or shelves, which are typically minimal on cargo ships. The convention also does not address the issues of rest hours during work or rest when joining ship; these issues are determined by crew and companies alone.&lt;ref name = lavelle/&gt;

'''''Massachusetts v. Laird''''', 400 U.S. 886 (1970), was a case dealing with the [[conscription]] aspect of the [[Vietnam War]] that the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] declined to hear by a 6–3 vote.

The Commonwealth of Massachusetts challenged the constitutionality of the war.  It passed a law stating that no resident of Massachusetts "shall be required to serve" in the military abroad if the armed hostility has not been declared a war by Congress. The attorney general of Massachusetts asked the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] to hear it's case to test the legality of the Vietnam War. 

The Supreme Court declined to hear the case due to a lack of jurisdiction.

It pursues this vision by providing a mechanism for regional cooperation, coordination and collaborative actions; it enables the '''Contracting Parties'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.unep.org/nairobiconvention/about-us/structure/contracting-parties|title=Contracting Parties {{!}} Nairobi Convention|last=Parties|first=|date=|website=web.unep.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; to harness resources and expertise from a wide range of stakeholders and interest groups; and in this way it helps solve inter-linked problems of the region’s coastal and marine environment.

== History of the Convention ==

The Nairobi Convention, which was first signed in 1985 and entered into force in 1996, is part of '''UN Environment’s Regional Seas Programme.'''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The programme aims to address the accelerating degradation of the world’s oceans and coastal areas through the sustainable management and use of the marine and coastal environment. It does this by engaging countries that share the western Indian Ocean in actions to protect their shared marine environment. The Contracting Parties ([[Comoros]], [[France]], [[Kenya]], [[Madagascar]], [[Mauritius]], [[Mozambique]], [[Seychelles]], [[Somalia]], [[Tanzania]] and the [[South Africa|Republic of South Africa]]) to the Convention are part of more than 143 countries that participate in 18 Regional Seas initiatives.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.unep.org/regionalseas/who-we-are/overview|title=Overview {{!}} Regional Seas|last=Regional Seas|first=|date=|website=web.unep.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implementation of projects ==
The Nairobi Convention Secretariat has successfully implemented various projects within the Western Indian Ocean region through funding from organizations such as GEF&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.unep.org/nairobiconvention/nairobi-convention-brochure|title=The Nairobi Convention Brochure  {{!}} Nairobi Convention|last=Partner|first=|date=|website=web.unep.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Governments of Norway and Sweden and through partnerships with other organizations such as Western Indian Ocean Marine Science Association (WIOMSA),&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Birdlife International,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; African Union (AU),&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Indian Ocean Commission (IOC), WWF and IUCN. These include the project Addressing land-based Activities in the Western Indian Ocean (WIO-LaB) project (funded by GEF in 2004-2010) and the African Marine and Coastal Programme (funded by the Swedish government in 2011-2016).

==  Summary of the Amended Articles of the Convention ==
The Nairobi Convention Secretariat held the Conference of Plenipotentiaries and the Sixth Conference of Parties (COP6) to the Nairobi Convention at the [[United Nations Environment Programme|United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)]] Headquarters at Gigiri in Nairobi Kenya, from 29 March to 1 April 2010, which considered and adopted the Amended Nairobi Convention for the Protection, Management and Development of the Marine and Coastal Environment of the Western Indian Ocean.

The '''National Rail Conditions of Travel''' (NRCoT) are a contractual document setting out the consumer's rights and responsibilities when travelling on the [[National Rail]] [[Rail transport in Great Britain#Passenger services|railway network in Great Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/times_fares/ticket_types.aspx#National%20Rail%20Conditions|title=National Rail Conditions of Travel|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt;|first=|date=|website=National Rail|publisher=Rail Delivery Group|page=3|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=24 October 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These replaced the National Rail Conditions of Carriage (NRCoC) as of 1 October 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/times_fares/ticket_types.aspx#National%20Rail%20Conditions&lt;/ref&gt;

When a train ticket is purchased, a contract is established. The NRCoT are the principal terms of that contract between traveller and train operating company (TOC), which have been established by the [[Rail Settlement Plan]], which is part of the [[Association of Train Operating Companies]]. The document is available for public viewing at [http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/times_fares/46427.aspx the National Rail website], as a free PDF download or from any staffed ticket office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/National%20Rail%20Conditions%20of%20Travel.pdf|title=National Rail Conditions of Travel|last=|first=|date=11 March 2018|website=National Rail|page=4|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional terms do apply to travellers, primarily from two sources:
* For certain ticket types (such as those purchased at discount in advance), the TOCs concerned apply additional terms and conditions on top of the NRCoT.
*The NRCoT cover the entitlement and restrictions of travellers, however they are not the only document to do so. Under the Transport Act 2000 (section 219), the [[Great Britain railway technical manuals|Railway Bylaws]] also apply, though more generally.

==Content==

Whilst the NRCoT are referred to on all train tickets, at stations, and on internet sites selling tickets for rail travel, very few travellers ever bother to read the document, unless they find themselves in dispute with a rail company on some matter.{{fact|date=July 2017}} They are, however, of use to the consumer, because they afford considerable rights to the traveller with regards ticket validity. This has become a matter of significant public interest recently,{{fact|date=July 2017}}{{When|date=March 2018}} in view of the complex and convoluted pricing structure of rail tickets in Great Britain.

 [[File:Patent of Tolerance 13.10.1781 p1.jpg|thumb|Front page of the edict.]]
The '''Patent of Toleration''' ({{lang-de|Toleranzpatent}}) was an [[edict of toleration]] issued on 13 October 1781 by the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Intolerance and discrimination | author=Jürgen Habermas | publisher=Oxford University Press and New York University School of Law | journal=International Journal of Constitutional Law | volume=1 | issue=1 | year=2003 | pages=2–12 | doi=10.1093/icon/1.1.2 | url=http://icon.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/1/1/2}} Page 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the [[Josephinism|Josephinist]] reforms, the Patent extended [[religious freedom]] to non-Catholic Christians living in the crown lands of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], including [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]], [[Calvinism|Calvinists]], and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Macartney, C. A. | url=http://www.hungarian-history.hu/lib/macartney/macartney11.htm | work=Hungary - A Short History | title=6. Renaissance and reform}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://countrystudies.us/hungary/19.htm | title=Enlightened Absolutism | work=Hungary: A Country Study | author=Stephen R. Burant, ed. | publisher=GPO for the Library of Congress | year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, these members of minority faiths were now legally permitted to hold "private religious exercises" in [[clandestine church]]es.&lt;ref name=Kaplan&gt;Kaplan, Benjamin J., ''Religious Conflict and the Practice of Toleration in Early Modern Europe,'' Harvard University Press, 2007, Chapter 8, pp. 192-4. ff..&lt;/ref&gt; 

For the first time after the [[Counter-Reformation]], the Patent guaranteed the practice of religion by the Evangelical Lutheran and the [[Reformed Church in Austria]]. Nevertheless, worship was heavily regulated, wedding ceremonies remained reserved for the Catholic Church, and the [[Unity of the Brethren]] was still suppressed. Similar to the [[articular church]]es admitted 100 years before, Protestants were only allowed to erect 'houses of prayer' (''Bethäuser'') which should not in any way resemble church buildings. In many Habsburg areas, especially in the 'hereditary lands' of [[Upper Austria]], [[Duchy of Styria|Styria]] and [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]], Protestant parishes quickly developed, strongly relying on [[Crypto-protestantism|crypto-protestant]] traditions.

The Patent was followed by the [[1782 Edict of Tolerance|Edict of Tolerance]] for [[History of the Jews in Austria|Jews]] in 1782. The edict extended to Jews the freedom to pursue all branches of commerce, but also imposed new requirements.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marsha Rozenblit]], Reconstructing National Identity, Oxford, 2001, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;  Jews were required to create German-language primary schools or send their children to Christian schools (Jewish schools had previously taught children to read and write Hebrew in addition to mathematics.) The Patent also permitted Jews to attend state secondary schools. A series of laws issued soon after the Edict of Toleration abolished the autonomy of the Jewish communities, which had previously run their own court, charity, internal taxation and school systems; required Jews to acquire family names; made Jews subject to military conscription; and required candidates for the rabbinate to have secular education.

The 1781 Patent was originally called the "Divine Send of Equal Liberties" but was further put down by the monarch's advisor. {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} Constraints on the construction of churches were abolished after the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire|revolutions of 1848]]. The Protestant Church did not receive an equivalent legal status until Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] issued the ''Protestantenpatent'' in 1861.

'''Post-Zionism''' refers to the opinions of some [[Israelis]], [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora]] [[Jews]] and others, particularly in academia, that [[Zionism]] has fulfilled its ideological mission with the creation of the modern [[State of Israel]] in 1948, and that Zionist ideology should therefore be considered at an end. The term is also used by [[Jewish right|right-wing Jews]] to refer to the [[Israeli Left|left wing of Israeli politics]] in light of the [[Oslo Accords]].

Some critics associate post-Zionism with [[anti-Zionism]], which is strenuously denied by proponents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.co.il/misc/1.734630] {{he icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristic of the perceptions of post-Zionism==
Post-Zionism is a term associated with a variety of perceptions and different positions, behind which stands criticism of the core beliefs of Zionist groups. Post-Zionists raise many questions about Zionism and the state of Israel, among them:
* Is the state of Israel indeed a safe shelter for the Jewish nation? Are there any other places in the world in which the Jews' conditions are better from a historical point of view? (For example, [[North America]])
* Is it really possible to have both a Jewish state and a [[democracy]]? Should Israel become a state of all its citizens?
* Is the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] entirely [[Black-and-white dualism|black-and-white]]? Did Israel always maximize its efforts to obtain peace? Should all the blame for the continuation of the conflict fall on the Arab side?

Many of the aforementioned questions have also been raised by Zionists.{{who|November 2010|date=November 2010}} However, the post-Zionists emphasize these points in their conception of Zionist history.

==In sociological development==
Transformations that took place in Israeli society in the 1980s and 1990s brought considerable changes to its values and political views. These changes have taken place in the economic field—e.g., liberalization of the Israeli economy and its opening to the global market, as well as in the breaking of the cultural [[hegemony]] of the labor movement, which existed up to that time. The prominent turning point occurred in 1977, when the right-wing [[Likud]] party first won [[parliamentary majority]]. This alone was a manifestation of the strengthening of the more extreme Zionist positions.

Several changes occurred in this period in tandem, including a reaction to the strengthening of the Zionist component in the government. Still, not all of the numerous changes occurring in tandem are due to one factor, and they are not all attributable to the phenomenon called post-Zionism.

The transformations in Israeli society accompanying the phenomenon of post-Zionism are found in a number of fields:

;Economic characteristics: Just as there are no economic characteristics unique to Zionism, which encompasses the full range of economical ideologies from [[Marxism]], [[Communism]], and [[Syndicalism]] to [[Capitalism]], there are no economic characteristics unique to post-Zionism, which encompasses extreme left-wing components as well as components that maintain a capitalist ideology. The capitalist political view of the [[free market]] and the nurturing of [[individualism]] was acceptable to great parts of the Zionist movement in Israel and outside Israel, and it is not only attributable to the post-Zionist movement. Even in the strongly socialist [[Histadrut]] during the [[Yishuv]], there existed a non-socialist liberal party. Post-Zionist parties that retain capitalist objectives and political views have continued to undermine the socialist political views that typified the [[Labor Party (Israel)|Labor Party]] agenda, which had a central place in the Zionist movement. The loss of the institutional collective and its historical foundations can be seen in the writings of a considerable part of the "new" sociologists and historians, who exhibit the most radical manifestation of this idea. The position of these communities is expressed in the [[individualism]] that sees individual material success as the only economic objective of the person, and also in [[economic globalization]], which supports the opening of the Israeli economic system to the world economic system, in contrast with conserving a closed and planned national economy.

;Cultural characteristics: These years are characterized by the challenging of the existence of a [[cultural hegemony]] in Israel. Different groups undermined the perception of the [[melting pot]], according to which only one Israeli culture existed and all the cultures joining it had to shed their previous identities; different communities began fighting to keep their unique cultural identities. Examples include [[Mizrahi Jews]], immigrants from the former [[USSR]], [[Arab citizens of Israel|Israeli Arabs]] and more.

;Political characteristics: Mainly after the [[Oslo Accords]], a new movement started amongst a large section of left-wing Israelis who believe that the state of Israel should no longer declare itself to be a Jewish democratic state and should rather focus on its democratic aspects. This movement seeks to create [[social equality]] in Israel.

However, the groups in Israeli society going through those processes are not necessarily post-Zionist. Actually, only a minor percentage of those groups define themselves as such.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}
The above three fields do not necessarily overlap. [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], for example, might have much in common with several post-Zionists in his economic beliefs, though he is more Zionist in all other aspects.

==As an intellectual movement==
Modern post-Zionism is closely associated with the [[New Historians]], a school of [[historical revisionism]] examining the history of Israel and Zionism in the light of declassified government documents, aiming to uncover events hitherto downplayed or suppressed by Zionist historians, especially those pertaining to the dispossession of the [[Palestinians]], which the New Historians argue was central to the creation of the state of Israel.

The new post-Zionists are [[intellectual]]s, mainly [[academic]] people who consider themselves, or are considered by others, as post-Zionists. Critics of post-Zionism known as [[Neo-Zionism|neo-Zionists]] argue that it undermines the Zionist narrative in its competition with other narratives, mainly the Palestinian one.

Although there are several intellectuals considering themselves to be post-Zionists, many others are not willing to adopt this epithet. The designation of post-Zionist has been used in a derogatory manner to describe those whose opinions take them outside the Zionist movement. Therefore, there are few intellectuals who are willing to refer to themselves as such.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

In the early 1990s there began to appear articles by Israeli academicians who referred to themselves as post-Zionists; this was mostly in the aftermath of a lengthy public discussion on the issues surrounding the events of the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War|War of Independence]], attributed to the [[New Historians]]. The public mood in the aftermath of the [[Oslo Accords]], which presumed that the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] was nearing a conclusion, contributed even more to the development of this tendency. Since the start of the [[Second Intifada]], public mood has changed tremendously, and as many perceive,{{who|November 2010|date=November 2010}} the post-Zionist tendency has been in retreat.

On the other hand, post-Zionist historians were accused of adopting the Palestinian narrative without any doubts and of demonizing and delegitimizing Israel and Zionism.

In contrast to political Zionism's goal of the [[Jewish state]], many post-Zionists advocate the evolution of Israel into a non-ideological, secular, [[liberal democracy|liberal democratic]] state, to be officially neither Jewish nor [[Arab]] in character.

==Criticism==
Post-Zionism has been criticized by [[Shlomo Avineri]] as a polite recasting of [[anti-Zionism]], and therefore a deceptive term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Post-Zionism doesn't exist |author=Shlomo Avineri |date=2007-07-06 |newspaper=Haaretz |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/878936.html |accessdate=2010-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some right-wing Israelis have accused Jewish post-Zionists of being [[self-hating Jew]]s.&lt;ref name=strenger&gt;{{Cite news

The '''Postgraduate Certificate in Laws''' ('''PCLL'''; 法學專業證書) is an intensive one-year full-time (or two-year part-time) professional [[legal education#Hong Kong|legal qualification]] programme in Hong Kong. It allows graduates to proceed to legal training before qualifying to practice as either a [[Barrister#Barristers in Hong Kong|barrister]] or a [[Solicitor#Hong Kong|solicitor]] in Hong Kong.  The "LL." of the abbreviation for the certificate is from the genitive plural ''legum'' (of lex, legis f., law). The programme can be seen as the equivalent of the [[Legal Practice Course]] (LPC) or the [[Bar Professional Training Course]] (BPTC) in [[England and Wales]], or the [[Certificate in Legal Practice (Malaysia)]] (CLP) in [[Malaysia]] which focuses heavily on practical and procedural issues in legal practice, unlike a first degree in law.

==Course providers==
There are three course providers in Hong Kong: 
*[[University of Hong Kong|The University of Hong Kong]] (HKU)
*[[City University of Hong Kong]] (CityU)
*[[CUHK Faculty of Law|Chinese University of Hong Kong]] (CUHK) (since September 2008)

==Qualification as a lawyer in Hong Kong==
As in [[England and Wales]], the legal profession in Hong Kong consists of two branches: solicitors and [[barrister]]s.
&lt;ref&gt;http://acelawtutor.com/routes-to-professional-qualification/acelawtutor.com/routes-to-professional-qualification/{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
After successfully completing the PCLL:

*Prospective solicitors go on to complete a two-year [[training contract]] as a [[trainee solicitor]] to qualify.
*Prospective barristers, undertake six months of [[pupillage]] under a [[pupilmaster]] before being [[Call to the bar|called to the Bar]] (admitted as a barrister) of Hong Kong, gaining limited rights of audience (limited practice). After six more months of pupillage, he or she can commence full practice.

==PCLL admission requirements==
To be eligible for admission to the courses leading to the PCLL, an applicant must have completed their Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) or equivalent legal studies either in Hong Kong or other common law jurisdictions, or, for non-law graduates, have passed the [[Graduate Diploma in English and Hong Kong Law]] (GDEHKL) of Hong Kong or the [[Common Professional Examination]]s (CPE/GDL) of England and Wales.

Applicant will have to demonstrate competence in the following eleven 'Core' subjects: Contract, Tort, Constitutional Law, Criminal Law, Land Law, Equity, Civil Procedure, Criminal Procedure, Evidence, Business Associations, and Commercial Law; and three 'Top-up' subjects: Hong Kong Constitutional Law, Hong Kong Legal System and Hong Kong Land Law. 
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www0.hku.hk/pcll/pcll/eligibility.html/ Eligibility for the admission to PCLL] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927225753/http://www0.hku.hk/pcll/pcll/eligibility.html |date=27 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Core subjects===
The degree or qualification must be in common law, and should include passes in eleven core subjects, including the following (or equivalent):&lt;ref name=PCEA&gt;[http://www.pcea.com.hk/ PCLL Conversion Examination and Administration website]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Contract
*[[Tort law|Tort]]
*[[Constitutional Law]]
*[[Criminal Law]]
*[[Property Law]]
*[[Law of Trusts]] (or [[Equity (law)|Equity]] or [[Legal remedy|Remedies]]).
*[[Civil Procedure]]
*[[Criminal Procedure]]
*[[Evidence (law)|Evidence]]
*Business Associations (or [[Corporate law|Company law]])
*[[Commercial Law]]

Six of these must be completed as part of a student's main law qualification: Contract, Tort, Constitutional Law, Criminal Law, Property Law and Equity.

Conversion examinations are offered twice a year for the remaining five subjects.

Students may complete these core subjects:
*as part of their non-Hong Kong common law qualification;
*as a visiting "internal" student in one of the three universities awarding LLB and/or [[Juris Doctor|JD]] degrees in Hong Kong and passing the requisite examination; and
*by passing the relevant subject in the ''Hong Kong Conversion Examination for PCLL Admission''.&lt;ref name=PCEA /&gt;

=== New top-up subjects from September 2008 ===

From September 2008 onwards, all candidates with overseas qualifications (i.e. not graduating with a law degree from [[List of law faculties in Hong Kong|local universities]]) must demonstrate competence in the following areas to be eligible for the PCLL:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcea.com.hk/newrequirement.pdf New top-up subject requirements from PCLL Conversion Examination and Administration website]&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Hong Kong Basic Law|Hong Kong Constitutional Law]]
* Hong Kong [[Property law|Land Law]]
* [[Legal system of Hong Kong|Hong Kong Legal System]]

Students may do so:
*as a visiting "internal" student in one of the three universities awarding LLB or JD degrees in Hong Kong and passing the requisite examination;
*as part of the [[Graduate Diploma in English and Hong Kong Law]] taught and awarded in Hong Kong; or
*by passing the relevant subject in the ''Hong Kong Conversion Examination for PCLL Admission''.

The effect of these requirements is that PCLL entrants who wish to avoid the need to sit additional conversion examinations in these three subjects must either enroll on the [[Graduate Diploma in English and Hong Kong Law]], which is jointly offered by the [[University of Hong Kong]]'s School of Professional and Continuing Education (HKU SPACE) as the course operator and [[Manchester Metropolitan University]] as the qualification awarding institution, or enroll with the law faculty of one of the three universities awarding LLB or JD degrees in Hong Kong.

===International English Language Testing System (IELTS)===
In addition to the above admission requirements, all students applying for PCLL must take the '''[[IELTS]]''' English proficiency test (Academic Module), the results of which is not earlier than three years preceding the closing date for applications. A minimum score of 7 is required, as set by the Standing Committee on Legal Education and Training.

==Course content==

===HKU===
There are five compulsory subjects: Civil Litigation, Criminal Litigation, Property Transactions, Corporate &amp; Commercial Transactions, Professional Practice &amp; Management.

====Streaming====
In 2007–08, students had to choose one of two streams: '''CPC''' (commercial, probate and corporate practice; for intending solicitors) or '''Litigation''' (for intending barristers and litigation solicitors).  Course content is identical in the first semester. In the second semester, while the subjects taken remain identical for both streams, CPC students focus more on the commercial aspect (letter writing, agreement drafting, etc.), while Litigation students focus more on the advocacy, pleadings drafting and opinion writing aspects.

As all barristers must have taken the Litigation stream, many students wishing to leave their options open may opt for Litigation even if they plan to be a solicitor in the short term, to avoid having to retake the PCLL.

In 2008–09, course syllabuses are undergoing some change and may not reflect the above.

=== CityU ===
There are eleven core courses: Interlocutory Advocacy and Interviewing; Trial Advocacy; Mediation and Negotiation; Litigation Writing and Drafting; Commercial Writing and Drafting; Conveyancing Practice; Wills and Probate Practice; Corporate and Commercial Practice; Civil Litigation Practice; Criminal Litigation Practice; and Professional Conduct and Practice.

In the second term, students must also take three electives which include the Bar Course; Foundations in Mainland Related Legal Transactions; International Arbitration Practice; Family Law Practice; Personal Injuries Practice; Financial Regulatory Practice; and Chinese for Legal Practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cityu.edu.hk/slw/PCLL/programme.html|title=CityU PCLL|website=www.cityu.edu.hk|access-date=2017-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===CUHK===
The programme is taught in two stages. In the first term, five compulsory subjects involve the study of core practice areas necessary for progression into the second term: [[Professional responsibility|Professional Practice]], [[Commercial Law|Commercial]] Practice, [[Conveyancing|Property]] and [[Probate]] Practice, [[Civil procedure|Civil Litigation]] Practice, and [[Criminal procedure|Criminal Litigation]] Practice.

In the second term, students are free to choose five electives which builds upon the core skills and knowledge from the first term. Though there is no streaming in the PCLL programme between intending Barristers and Solicitors, students who intend to seek admission as a Barrister in Hong Kong must undertake the following three courses: Trial Advocacy (taught intensively in the summer term), Writing &amp; Drafting Litigation Documents, and Conference Skills and Opinion Writing.

==Admission details==

===HKU===
HKU's intake is currently approximately 260 (full-time) and 80 (part-time), with approximately 70–80 of those from its own LLB programme.  Others come from universities in other [[common law]] jurisdictions, particularly the United Kingdom and Australia.

The minimum academic level required has increased with each intake.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www0.hku.hk/pcll/application/Notes%20for%20Applicants%202011.pdf Notes for applicants (2011–2012)]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, all HKU LLB graduates would have been admitted into its PCLL programme; now, just over two-thirds are admitted (i.e. at least a decent [[2:1]] honours in the LLB).  Non-HKU LLB students usually require a [[2:1]] honours.

In 2007–08, 170 places were government-funded and 117 were self-funded.

===CityU===
The CityU PCLL intake is currently around 210 students per year, with approximately 100 of those from its own LL.B. and J.D. programmes. Others come from universities in other [[common law]] jurisdictions, particularly the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia. Non-CityU students usually require at least a [[British undergraduate degree classification|2:1]] honours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cityu.edu.hk/slw/PCLL/admission.html|title=CityU PCLL|website=www.cityu.edu.hk|access-date=2018-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018-19, around 50 places were government-funded.

===CUHK===
The [[CUHK Faculty of Law]] commenced its PCLL in September 2008, with student intake of around 150 each year. Admission to the programme is highly competitive. Successful applicants have, on the whole, achieved at least a [[2:1]] honours (or its equivalent) in their law degree.

The course is only offered as a one-year full-time course, with one point of entry in September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.law.cuhk.edu.hk/programmes/postgraduate-certificate-of-laws.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091019054914/http://www.law.cuhk.edu.hk/programmes/postgraduate-certificate-of-laws.php |archivedate=19 October 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Anonymous Scientology 1 by David Shankbone.JPG|thumb|Protesters in [[Guy Fawkes mask]]s outside a Scientology center at the February 10, 2008 Project Chanology protest.]]

'''Project Chanology''' (also called '''Operation Chanology''')&lt;ref name="landers" /&gt; was a [[protest]] movement against the practices of the [[Church of Scientology]] by members of [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]], a leaderless [[Internet]]-based group. The project was started in response to the Church of Scientology's attempts to remove material from a highly publicized interview with [[Scientologist]] [[Tom Cruise]] from the Internet in January 2008.

The project was publicly launched in the form of a video posted to [[YouTube]], "Message to Scientology", on January 21, 2008. The video states that [[Scientology and the Internet|Anonymous views Scientology's actions]] as [[Internet censorship]], and asserts the group's intent to "expel the church from the Internet". This was followed by distributed [[denial-of-service attack]]s (DDoS), and soon after, [[black fax]]es, [[prank call]]s, and other measures intended to disrupt the Church of Scientology's operations. In February 2008, the focus of the protest shifted to legal methods, including [[Nonviolence|nonviolent]] protests and an attempt to get the [[Internal Revenue Service]] to investigate the Church of Scientology's [[Tax exemption|tax exempt status]] in the United States.

Reactions from the Church of Scientology regarding the protesters' actions have varied. Initially, one spokesperson stated that members of the group "have got some wrong information" about Scientology.&lt;ref name="schliebs" /&gt; Another referred to the group as a group of "computer geeks".&lt;ref name="thomas" /&gt; Later, the Church of Scientology started referring to Anonymous as "cyberterrorists" perpetrating "religious hate crimes" against the church.

Detractors of Scientology have also criticized the actions of Project Chanology, asserting that they merely provide the Church of Scientology with the opportunity to "play the religious persecution card".&lt;ref name="mcmillan" /&gt; Other critics such as [[Mark Bunker]] and [[Tory Christman]] initially questioned the [[legality]] of Project Chanology's methods,&lt;ref name="braiker" /&gt; but have since spoken out in support of the project as it shifted towards nonviolent protests and other legal methods.

==Background==
{{main|Scientology and the Internet}}

The Church of Scientology has a history of conflict with groups on the Internet. In 1995, attorneys for the Church of Scientology attempted to get the [[newsgroup]] [[alt.religion.scientology]] (a.r.s.) removed from [[Usenet]].&lt;ref name="oconnell" /&gt; This attempt backfired and generated a significant amount of press for a.r.s. The conflict with a.r.s led the [[hacker (computer security)|hacker]] group [[Cult of the Dead Cow]] to declare war on the Church of Scientology.&lt;ref name="oconnell" /&gt; The Church of Scientology mounted a 10-year legal campaign against Dutch writer [[Karin Spaink]] and several [[Internet service providers]] after Spaink and others posted documents alleged to be secret teachings of the organization. The Church of Scientology's efforts ended in a legal defeat in a Dutch court in 2005.&lt;ref name="barkham" /&gt; This series of events is often referred to as "Scientology versus the Internet".&lt;ref name="oconnell" /&gt;

===Tom Cruise video===
[[Image:Anonymous Scientology 3 by David Shankbone.JPG|thumb|Removal of the [[Tom Cruise]] Scientology video from [[YouTube]] prompted allegations that Scientology is censoring information about itself.]]

[[Jonathan Holmes (journalist)|Jonathan Holmes]], the presenter of the Australian [[Watchdog journalism|watchdog]] program ''[[Media Watch (TV program)|Media Watch]]'', reported on two cases of media [[censorship]] of the protests. [[News.com.au]] pixelated a poster carried by a protester which was revealed, through a ''[[Today Tonight]]'' segment, to have displayed the word "CULT". ''[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]]'' erased Tom Cruise's name from a protest placard, rendering the placard's message meaningless, without informing its readers. ''The Advertiser'''s editor, Melvin Mansell, stated that the alteration had "slipped by" and that he was opposed to the publication of doctored photographs.&lt;ref name="HolmesFeb25"&gt;{{cite news|first= Jonathan |last= Holmes|authorlink=Jonathan Holmes (journalist)|url=http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s2172032.htm| title= Tom Cruise goes Missing|format=video and transcript|work=[[Media Watch (TV program)|Media Watch]]|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date= 25 February 2008 |accessdate= 2008-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====May 2008====
On May 10, a teenager who went to the protests in front of the [[Queen Victoria Street, London|Queen Victoria Street]] Church of Scientology in London was issued a [[court summons]] after being asked to take down a sign that read "Scientology is not a religion, it is a dangerous cult". Posting anonymously on a forum, the teenager stated "Within five minutes of arriving ... I was told by a member of the police that I was not allowed to use 'that word'".&lt;ref name="teen-tele"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1997376/Boy-faces-court-for-Scientology-placard.html|title=Boy faces court for Scientology placard - A teenage boy is facing a possible criminal prosecution for holding a sign describing the Church of Scientology as a "cult", police said on Tuesday|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]| accessdate= 2008-05-23|date=2008-05-21|last=Bingham|first=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that the police told him he had 15 minutes to take down the sign. The teenager did not, citing a 1984 high Court ruling by [[John Latey (judge)|Mr Justice Latey]] in which he described the Church of Scientology as a "cult" that was "corrupt, sinister and dangerous".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/may/20/1?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=networkfront|title=Teenager faces prosecution for calling Scientology 'cult'|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=2008-05-23|date=2008-05-20|last=Dawar|first=Anil}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sign was then confiscated.

This is just barmy".&lt;ref name="teen-tele" /&gt; On May 23, 2008, the legal action against the boy was dropped. A [[Crown Prosecution Service]] (CPS) spokesman said: "In consultation with the City of London Police, we were asked whether the sign was abusive or insulting.

In November 2009, the ''[[New York Post]]'' interviewed former Scientologist Mandy Mullen, who had joined the Manhattan organization in 2008 after seeing information on [[4chan]] about Chanology protests. Over the next year, she recalled cases of members being coerced into donating more and more money. When she told her "leader" that she had looked at websites run by anti-Scientology protesters (and disagreed with them), he reportedly replied "That's like saying I don't burn niggers, I just like to party with the [[KKK]]!" In Fall 2008 Mullen left the church, joining a group of Chanology protesters across the street.&lt;ref name="mullen"&gt;Karni, Annie (November 15, 2009) "Weird 'Science': Why I Left the Church of Scientology - The 100-pound Parasite off my Back", ''[[The New York Post]]''.

===Campaign against Scientology's tax-exempt status===
A woman who stated she was a member of Anonymous told [[KNTV]] that the group has shifted strategy to activities which fight Scientology but are not deemed illegal by the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]], including an attempt to get the [[Internal Revenue Service]] to investigate the Church of Scientology's [[501(c)(3)]] [[Tax exemption|tax-exempt status]].&lt;ref name="kntv" /&gt; Another woman from Anonymous told ''[[Newsweek]]'' that the group plans to accomplish this through a [[lobbying]] campaign.&lt;ref name="braiker" /&gt; United States tax authorities removed the Church of Scientology's tax-exemption status in 1967, stating that the organization's [[Auditing (Scientology)|auditing techniques]] served as a [[for-profit]] operation for L.

Pouw stated that the video consisted of "pirated and edited" excerpts of Cruise from a 2004 Scientology event, and that after the video appeared, there was increased traffic to Scientology sites as shown by top lists compiled by search engines.&lt;ref name="vamosi church responds" /&gt; Pouw went on to state "Those wishing to find out the Church of Scientology's views and to gain context of the video have the right to search official Church Web sites if they so desire."&lt;ref name="vamosi church responds"&gt;{{cite news|last=Vamosi|first=Robert|title=Church of Scientology responds to Internet attacks|work=[[CNET News]]|pages=|language= |date=January 26, 2008|url=http://www.news.com/8301-10789_3-9858956-57.html|accessdate=2008-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tory Christman]], a critic of Scientology and former Scientologist from 1969 to 2000, stated she disapproved of illegal tactics but felt encouraged by the new influx of critics of Scientology.&lt;ref name="masters" /&gt; Christman told ''Morning Edition'': "It feels like we've been out in this desert, fighting this group one-on-one by ourselves, and all of a sudden this huge army came up with not only tons of people, thousands of people, but better tools..."&lt;ref name="masters" /&gt; Scientology critic [[Arnaldo Lerma]] told the ''St. Petersburg Times'' he was impressed by a video of a protest against Scientology which took place in Orlando, Florida: "I've never seen anything like that before.

Most critics you talk to want the Scientology site to be up there so that people who are interested can see the stupidity they have on the web and at the same time they can go - they are a few keystrokes from getting a thousand other opinions."&lt;ref name="g4" /&gt; Nick Douglas explained that the group decided to shift their strategy away from the attacks to Scientology websites: "Anonymous even decided that they were going to stop that attack, that it was a bad idea.

'''Regulatory taking''' is a situation in which a government  [[regulation]] limits the uses of private property to such a degree that the regulation effectively deprives the property owners of economically reasonable use or value of their property to such an extent that it deprives them of utility or value of that property, even though the regulation does not formally divest them of title to it.

==United States law==
In [[common law]] jurisdictions, state governments traditionally enjoy [[Police power (United States constitutional law)|police power]], under which a government may regulate a variety of aspects of the lives of its subjects.

Under American law, however, this power does not extend to the outright divestiture of title to private property, nor to the de facto equivalent of it. Instead, the power of [[eminent domain]] is a separate and distinct power which allows a government to divest a property owner of utility of such property, but when it does so, it must pay just compensation.  Some states, not the federal government, use the full compensation standard, not the just compensation standard.

This power is limited in the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], and extends to the states under the Due Process Clause of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].  (The Fifth Amendment prohibits the [[federal government]] from taking property for public use without "just compensation," which American courts have interpreted in the usual case to mean "[[fair market value]]".) This prohibition is deemed [[Incorporation (Bill of Rights)|incorporated]] in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment (which bars state governments from depriving people of their property without due process of law.)

===Physical occupation===
The most straightforward takings claim arises when the government physically occupies some part of a landowner's property without compensation:  this runs directly into the plain language of the amendment itself.  It is a "taking" of some property without compensation.   With certain exceptions, a direct  physical occupation, temporary or permanent, represents a taking.   In some few cases, we find disputes surrounding whether a government action in fact constitutes a physical direct and immediate occupation of land.  A leading case is ''[[United States v. Causby]]'', 328 U.S. 256 (1946), in which a landowner was subjected incessant low-level military flights well below the federally recognized aviation airspace.  In requiring compensation, the Court held:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The landowner owns at least as much of the space above the ground as we can occupy or use in connection with the land. See Hinman v. Pacific Air Transport, 9 Cir., 84 F.2d 755. The fact that he does not occupy it in a physical sense-by the erection of buildings and the like-is not material.    … In this case, as in Portsmouth Harbor Land &amp; Hotel Co. v. United States, supra, the damages were not merely consequential. They were the product of a direct invasion of respondents' domain. As stated in United States v. Cress, 243 U.S. 316, 328, 37 S.Ct. 380, 385, '… it is the character of the invasion, not the amount of damage resulting from it, so long as the damage is substantial, that determines the question whether it is a taking.'   Flights over private land are not a taking, unless they are so low and so frequent as to be a direct and immediate interference with the enjoyment and use of the land.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Regulatory restriction on use of property===
In contrast, a regulation restricting the use of property to further legitimate public ends, will not be considered a taking merely because it impairs the value or the utility of that land. However, when the regulation goes too far (as Justice Holmes put it in ''[[Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon]]''), it will be judicially recognized as the equivalent of a taking which may not take place without payment of just compensation to the property's owner.

The issue of regulatory takings arises from the interaction between exercise of the traditional [[Police power (United States constitutional law)|police power]] and exercise of [[eminent domain]]. The police power is the inherent state government power, to do what is reasonably necessary to promote and protect public health, safety, welfare and morals.

There are numerous instances where the [[US Supreme Court]] has found that state courts have reasonably concluded that "the health, safety, morals, or general welfare" would be promoted by prohibiting particular contemplated uses of land.  And in this context the Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld land-use regulations that adversely affected recognized real property interests.

[[Zoning law]]s are the classic example; see ''[[Hadacheck v. Sebastian]]'', 239 U.S. 394 (1915) (prohibition of brickyard operations within certain neighborhoods); ''[[Village of Euclid, Ohio v. Ambler Realty Co.]]'', 272 U.S. 365 (1926) (prohibition of industrial use); ''[[Gorieb v. Fox]]'', 274 U.S. 603, 608 (1927) (requirement that portions of parcels be left unbuilt); ''[[Welch v. Swasey]]'', 214 U.S. 91 (1909) (height restriction), which have been viewed as permissible governmental action even when prohibiting the most beneficial use of the property.

However, zoning restrictions may not deny an owner ''any'' economically viable use of his land. Suppose a "low density residential" zone requires that a [[house]] have a [[Building setback|setback]] (the distance from the edge of the property to the edge of the [[building]]) of no less than 100 feet (30 m).  If a particular property were only 100 feet (30 m) deep, it would be impossible to build a house on the property.

Governmental land-use regulation that deny the property owner any economically viable use are deemed a taking of the affected property. See, e.g., ''[[Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council]]'', 505 U.S. 1003 (1992), ''[[First English Evangelical Lutheran Church v. County of Los Angeles]]'' (1987).  The general approach to this question was summed up in ''[[Agins v. City of Tiburon]]'', 447 U.S. 255 (1980) which states that the application of land-use regulations to a particular piece of property is a taking only "if the ordinance does not substantially advance legitimate state interests … or denies an owner economically viable use of his land."   However, in ''[[Lingle v. Chevron]]'', 544 U.S. 528 (2005), the Supreme Court overruled the "substantially advance" criterion of a taking. When a government regulation effects a taking of private property by such excessive regulation, the owner may initiate [[inverse condemnation]] proceedings to recover the just compensation for the taking of his or her property, provided that  procedural hurdles have been overcome.

In recent years, the concept of regulatory taking has been used more loosely—outside the constitutional sense—by property rights groups, extending to include regulations that reduce property values by lesser amounts. [[Ballot initiative]]s based on this interpretation (such as Oregon's [[Measure 37]]) have been advanced in at least seven states in the years 2000 to 2006. All these states are in the American west, but a significant portion of the funding for the initiatives has come from sources on the east coast.&lt;ref&gt;See Patricia E. Salkin and Amy Lavine, ''Measure 37 and a Spoonful of Kelo'', 38 The Urban Lawyer 1065 (Fall 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inverse condemnation===
Inverse condemnation is a term which describes a claim brought  against the government in which a property owner seeks compensation for a `taking' of his property under the Fifth Amendment. In states that prohibit uncompensated taking or damaging, physical damage to property is included in this definition.  The term "inverse" is used, because usually condemnations are brought by the government.  In the inverse condemnation context, it is the property owner who sues the government, alleging a taking (or damaging) of property without just compensation.  See ''San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. v. City of San Diego'', 450 U.S. 621, 638 n.2 (1981) (Justice Brennan dissenting); ''United States v. Clarke'', 445 U.S. 253, 257 (1980); ''Agins v. City of Tiburon'', 447 U.S. 255, 258 n.2 (1980).

==Constitutional history==
{{Original research|date=December 2011}}
The authors of the United States Constitution had come from a country where feudal property rights derived originally from the King and the nobility.  In the 17th and 18th century, the concept of property rights was changing dramatically. "By the 16th century, there was no 'free' land in the British Isles or in Western Europe. Every acre was owned by someone, either a private individual or by government in the form of the Crown. The laws of primogeniture and entail meant that an estate of land had to be passed on intact to the oldest son, and those without land were in large measure powerless."  Of particular importance at this time were the writings of the great English political theorist [[John Locke]] (1632–1704). To Locke, private property arose out of natural law and existed prior to the creation of government. The right to own property, therefore, did not depend upon the whims of a king or parliament; to the contrary, the primary purpose of government was to protect rights in property, since these rights were at the base of all liberties.

It is not likely that the founders of the United States considered the right to ownership of property as absolute.  They understood that in a community, ownership of property, indeed the very value of property itself, rested to some extent on  mutual obligations.  "Ownership in land — the most tangible, and in the early days of the Republic, the most important form of property — had never meant absolute control over that property or an unfettered right to use it in any way the owner wanted. Traditions going back to English common law have always placed restrictions on property. The common law doctrine of nuisance, for example, prevented owners from using their land in a way that interfered unreasonably with the rights of their neighbors. Custom often allowed hunting on private, unenclosed land, or required that an owner allow access to rivers and lakes. Property in the form of businesses also had regulations on them; taverns, ferries and coach lines, for example, were often heavily regulated in both England and the North American colonies."  &lt;ref&gt;See Rights of the People, Individual Freedoms and the Bill of Rights, [http://www.america.gov/st/democracy-english/2008/June/20080716195601eaifas3.759402e-02.html Property Rights].&lt;/ref&gt;  While the founders regarded the right to own property as sacrosanct, they certainly did not regard that right as implying immunity from regulation.

The government takes property for roads, for government buildings, for parks, military bases, airports and to preserve water supplies.  The power to take private property for public purposes is necessary to the ability to maintain, preserve and defend the republican form of government.    The [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] to the United States contains important protections against federal confiscation of private property. It states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No person .....{shall be} deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The text of this clause seems to provide two separate protections.  The first prevents the federal government from depriving a person of property without due process of law.  It applies to any deprivation of property, not just takings for public purpose.  The second prevents the federal government from taking private property for public use without just compensation.

Until 1896 the Fifth Amendment Taking Clause applied only to the federal government. Thereafter it was held that the Just Compensation Clause is incorporated in the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment which does apply to states. The problem of sovereign immunity of the United States was solved when Congress enacted the Tucker Act which consents to lawsuits against the federal government in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims which sits in Washington, DC, but hears taking cases from all over the country.

===Legal tender cases===
An early case involving interpretation of the Fifth Amendment was the ''[[Legal Tender Cases]]'', 79 U.S. 457 (1870)   During the [[American Civil War]], the Legal Tender Acts of 1862 and 1863 made paper money a legal substitute for gold and silver, including for the payment of preexisting debts.  In ''Hepburn v. Griswold'', the Supreme Court had found the legal tender laws inconsistent with the spirit of the Constitution, which prohibited the states from passing "[[Contracts Clause|any … law impairing the obligation of contracts.]]"   Moreover, the Court had held that an act compelling holders of contracts that called for payment in gold or silver to accept as legal tender "mere promises to pay dollars" was unconstitutional because it deprived "such persons of property without due process of law" under the Fifth Amendment. The Court until this time had rarely found an act of Congress unconstitutional.  In 1871, the Court, with two new justices on the bench, reversed itself in the legal tender cases, ''Knox v. Lee'' and ''Parker v. Davis'', and declared the Legal Tender Acts constitutional The Fifth Amendment does not apply to injuries which flow from the exercise of lawful power, the court held, but only to direct appropriation of property.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The fifth amendment.... forbids taking private property for public use without just compensation or due process of law. That provision has always been understood as referring only to a direct appropriation, and not to consequential injuries resulting from the exercise of lawful power. It has never been supposed to have any bearing upon, or to inhibit laws that indirectly work harm and loss to individuals. A new tariff, an embargo, a draft, or a war may inevitably bring upon individuals great losses; may, indeed, render valuable property almost valueless. They may destroy the worth of contracts. But whoever supposed that, because of this, a tariff could not be charged, or a non-intercourse act, or an embargo be enacted, or a war be declared?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence===
The [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] extended the protection against uncompensated takings to citizens against their own states, and in so doing created both significant new protections for individual rights and a new avenue for federal interference with State and local democracy.   Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Notice that the text of the fourteenth amendment's anti-confiscation provision is different from that of the Fifth Amendment.  One might argue that the difference in text would lead to a limitation of the federal courts' role in enforcing state law protections against takings.  But early on, the federal courts began the process of gradual [[Incorporation (Bill of Rights)|incorporation of the bill of rights protections]] into the fourteenth amendment.  The due process clause of the fourteenth amendment has historically been a major vehicle for the invasion by the federal courts into governance of the states.   We find early justices of the Supreme Court puzzling over this, for example, in ''[[Mugler v. Kansas]]'', 123 U.S. 623 (1887):

&lt;blockquote&gt; It is not a little remarkable that, while this provision has been in the constitution of the United States as a restraint upon the authority of the federal government for nearly a century, and while during all that time the manner in which the powers of that government have been exercised has been watched with jealousy, and subjected to the most rigid criticism in all its branches, this special limitation upon its powers has rarely been invoked in the judicial forum or the more enlarged theater of public discussion. But while it has been a part of the constitution as a restraint upon the powers of the states only a very few years, the docket of this court is crowded with cases in which we are asked to hold that state courts and state legislatures have deprived their own citizens of life, liberty, and property without due process of law. There is here abundant evidence that there exists some strange misconception of the scope of the provision as found in the fourteenth amendment. In fact, it would seem from the character of many of the cases before us, and the arguments made in them, that the clause under consideration is looked upon as a means of bringing to the test of the decision of this court the abstract opinions of every unsuccessful litigant in a state court of justice of the decision against him, and of the merits of the legislation on which such a decision may be founded.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Rights of the People; Individual Freedom and the Bill of Rights'', Chapter 9 [http://www.ait.org.tw/infousa/zhtw/DOCS/RightsPeople/property.html]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;During the 19th and early parts of the 20th century, a great debate took place in the United States over the nature of property rights and the balance that should be struck between the rights of private owners and businessmen on the one hand and the police powers of the state that were enlisted to ameliorate the harsher aspects of industrialization. Especially within the judicial branch, many judges seemed to hold an unalloyed Lockean view that nothing should be done to disturb individual rights in property.  As a result, conservative courts consistently restricted both state legislatures and the Congress in their efforts to put through reform measures such as wages and work-hours laws, factory safety measures, rate regulation of public utilities, and progressive taxation of income — measures that are common in all modern states. Not until the Great Depression of the 1930s did the forces of reform finally triumph. This did not mean that the American people abandoned property rights, but rather that property rights took on a more proportional value within a larger revolution in individual liberties. Starting in 1937, both the country and its courts began to concentrate on personal liberties, and especially the meaning of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The Pennsylvania Coal case===
The Supreme Court first held that state regulations that go too far may effect a taking in the 1922 case of ''[[Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon]]''. There, [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Justice Holmes]] wrote for the majority that "[''t'']''he general rule at least is that while property may be regulated to a certain extent, if regulation goes too far it will be recognized as a taking''." In that case the law in question (the Pennsylvania Kohler Act) forbade all mining under inhabited land, but that was held by the Supreme Court to be a taking of the coal.

State land use, public health and environmental legislation necessarily limits the use of private property.   But these laws do not directly occupy private property.  What then are the limits on state power to constrain the use of private property without providing compensation. Two important cases, both dealing with state mining regulation, help frame this issue.  The first, ''Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon'', 260 U.S. 393 (1922), was decided by the Supreme Court at a time when the Court actively intervened broadly against state and local regulation in a variety of contexts.   The case arose from a challenge to state legislation designed to deal with coal mine subsidence.  As the Court later explained in ''[[Keystone Bituminous Coal Assn. v. Debenedictis]]'', 480 U.S. 470 (1987):

&lt;blockquote&gt;Coal mine subsidence is the lowering of strata overlying a coal mine, including the land surface, caused by the extraction of underground coal. This lowering of the strata can have devastating effects.   It often causes substantial damage to foundations, walls, other structural members, and the integrity of houses and buildings. Subsidence frequently causes sinkholes or troughs in land which make the land difficult or impossible to develop. Its effect on farming has been well documented – many subsided areas cannot be plowed or properly prepared. Subsidence can also cause the loss of groundwater and surface ponds.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From 1890 to 1920 coal interests purchased great reaches of mineral interests throughout western [[Pennsylvania]].  Under these purchases, the landowner preserved the right to use the surface land, but gave up mineral claims.  Many of the deeds to mineral interests contained waivers which gave up the right to claim damages to the surface interest, in the event that mining caused damage to the surface interest.  As the Court later explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is stipulated that approximately 90% of the coal that is or will be mined by petitioners in western Pennsylvania was severed from the surface in the period between 1890 and 1920. When acquiring or retaining the mineral estate, petitioners or their predecessors typically acquired or retained certain additional rights that would enable them to extract and remove the coal. Thus, they acquired the right to deposit wastes, to provide for drainage and ventilation, and to erect facilities such as tipples, roads, or railroads, on the surface. Additionally, they typically acquired a waiver of any claims for damages that might result from the removal of the coal.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Both of the two Pennsylvania coal cases reviewed state legislation which sought to limit the amount of devastation which could be caused by this undermining process.  The coal companies argued that they had acquired the right to this devastation:  that it had been purchased from others who originally owned it.   The state and injured landowners argued that the right to devastate was not property.  Or, viewed differently, that all property is held subject to the government's right to regulate.

The early mining operations often removed so much of the underground coal that the mines became a hazard to the miners underground and to those residing on the surface. For this reason, the Pennsylvania legislature acted to limit the amount of material that could be removed from the mines below:  so as to leave sufficient underground support below.

''Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon'' involved an action by an individual landowner who sought to prevent a mining operation from violating this law, undermining their home.   The owner's deed conveyed the surface but in express terms reserved the right to remove all the coal.  Under Pennsylvania law the deed also conveyed the right to surface support to the coal company which could thus remove subsurface coal even if that caused subsuidence. The deed provided that the grantee takes the premises with that risk and waives all claim for damages that may arise from mining out the coal.  The coal company essentially thus owned a property right to mine as much as it wished, without regard to consequences to the surface, by reason of this deed.  Over a dissent by Justice Brandeis, the court ruled that Pennsylvania's statute deprived the coal companies of the right to mine their coal, and this was deemed a confiscation.  The Court's opinion recognizes that government may lawfully limit the use of property to some extent without compensation, but found that this statute went too far.  Said the court:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Government hardly could go on if to some extent values incident to property could not be diminished without paying for every such change in the general law. As long recognized, some values are enjoyed under an implied limitation and must yield to the police power. But obviously the implied limitation must have its limits, or the contract and due process clauses are gone. One fact for consideration in determining such limits is the extent of the diminution. When it reaches a certain magnitude, in most if not in all cases there must be an exercise of eminent domain and compensation to sustain the act. So  the question depends upon the particular facts.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The general rule at least is that while property may be regulated to a certain extent, if regulation goes too far it will be recognized as a taking. It may be doubted how far exceptional cases, like the blowing up of a house to stop a conflagration, go-and if they go beyond the general rule, whether they do not stand as much upon tradition as upon principle. Bowditch v. Boston, 101 U.S. 16 . In general it is not plain that a man's misfortunes or necessities will justify his shifting the damages to his neighbor's shoulders. We are in danger of forgetting that a strong public desire to improve the public condition is not enough to warrant achieving the desire by a shorter cut than the constitutional way of paying for the change. As we already have said this is a question of degree-and therefore cannot be disposed of by general propositions. But we regard this as going beyond any of the cases decided by this Court. The late decisions upon laws dealing with the congestion of Washington and New York, caused by the war, dealt with laws intended to meet a temporary emergency and providing for compensation determined to be reasonable by an impartial board. They were to the verge of the law but fell far short of the present act.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The Bituminous Coal Association case===
Some 65 years later, the Court considered similar Pennsylvania legislation which required that some underground coal be left in place to provide surface support.   In the Bituminous Coal case, the State's legislation received a more sympathetic hearing from the Court in ''Keystone Bituminous Coal Assn. v. DeBenedictis'', 480 U.S. 470 (1987).  The Court wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...[T]he character of the governmental action involved here leans heavily against finding a taking; the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has acted to arrest what it perceives to be a significant threat to the common welfare. [t]here is no record in this case to support a finding, similar to the one the Court made in Pennsylvania Coal, that the Subsidence Act makes it impossible for petitioners to profitably engage in their business....&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Keystone decision is characterized by deference to the State's determination that its legislation promoted public health and safety:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Under our system of government, one of the State's primary ways of preserving the [[Common good|public weal]] is restricting the uses individuals can make of their property. While each of us is burdened somewhat by such restrictions, we, in turn, benefit greatly from the restrictions that are placed on others. These restrictions are "properly treated as part of the burden of common citizenship".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Notably, the Keystone decision bears four dissents:  Justices Rehnquist, Powell, O'Connor and Scalia.

===Health and safety takings===
Suppose the government must cut a [[firebreak]] through a forest upon private property to prevent spread of a forest fire.   Or suppose the government destroys healthy livestock in a quarantine area to prevent spread of disease.   These are invasive takings, but they do not fall under the per se rule described in the previous section.  From the very first, the takings cases recognized that `all property in this country is held under the implied obligation that the owner's use of it shall not be injurious to the community.' ''Mugler v. Kansas'', 123 U.S. 623, 665 (1887).     The most straightforward example of this principle occurs when the government must condemn or destroy property to prevent spread of disease or other threat to the public health or safety.  "Thus, in order to protect the health and safety of the community,  government may condemn unsafe structures,  may close unlawful  business operations, may destroy infected trees, and surely may restrict access to hazardous areas – for example, land on which radioactive materials have been discharged, land in the path of a lava flow from an erupting volcano, or land in the path of a potentially life-threatening flood.   When a governmental  entity imposes these types of health and safety regulations, it may not be "burdened with the condition that [it] must compensate such individual owners for   pecuniary losses they may sustain, by reason of their not being permitted, by a noxious use of their property, to inflict injury upon the community."

==Evolution of modern regulatory takings law==

===Penn Central===

Perhaps the most important modern case on regulatory takings is the Grand Central Station case.  In ''Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City'', 438 U.S. 104 (1978) the Court denied a takings claim brought by the owner of [[Grand Central Terminal]] following refusal of [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]] to approve plans for construction of 50-story office building over Grand Central Terminal. Penn Central contended that under the New York Historical Preservation Law, it was entitled to derive a net income from Grand Central Terminal, but the city's regulation had forced it into an indefinite deficit condition. The trial court agreed but its decision was reversed on appeal. Eventually the U.S. Supreme Court held that: the owners could not establish a "taking" merely by showing that they had been denied the right to exploit the superadjacent airspace, irrespective of the remainder of the parcel; the fact that the law affected some owners more severely than others did not itself result in a "taking," and that the law did not interfere with owners' present use or prevent it from realizing a reasonable rate of return on its investment, especially since preexisting air rights were transferable to other parcels in the vicinity, which acted as a form of compensation for the claimed taking of air rights.

The Court's ruling has caused confusion because in it the court declined to explain what constitutes a cause of action for a regulatory taking, and only asserted that the decision whether a regulatory taking has occurred is made ad hoc on the basis of the facts in each case.   "The question of what constitutes a "taking" for purposes of the Fifth Amendment has proved to be a problem of considerable difficulty. While this Court has recognized that the "Fifth Amendment's guarantee . . . [is] designed to bar Government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole," ''Armstrong v. United States'', 364 U.S. 40, [438 U.S. 104, 124] 49 (1960), this Court, quite simply, has been unable to develop any "set formula" for determining when "justice and fairness" require that economic injuries caused by public action be compensated by the government, rather than remain disproportionately concentrated on a few persons. See ''[[Goldblatt v. Hempstead]]'', 369 U.S. 590, 594 (1962). Indeed, we have frequently observed that whether a particular restriction will be rendered invalid by the government's failure to pay for any losses proximately caused by it depends largely "upon the particular circumstances [in that] case." ''United States v. Central Eureka Mining Co.'', 357 U.S. 155, 168 (1958); see ''United States v. Caltex, Inc''., 344 U.S. 149, 156 (1952). In engaging in these essentially ad hoc, factual inquiries, the Court's decisions have identified several factors that have particular significance.

In making its decision, the Court would consider
# the economic impact of the regulation on the claimant,
# the extent to which the regulation has interfered with distinct investment-backed expectations and
# the character of the governmental action.

These factors have been criticized because the court failed to provide guidance as to exactly what they mean, what must be proven to establish a taking using them as a test, and whether all three, two, or any one of them is sufficient to show a taking.

===Andrus v. Allard===

Another interesting case from this time period is Andrus v. Allard, the eagle feather case.  In ''[[Andrus v. Allard]]'', 444 U.S. 51 (1979), the Court found that the federal Eagle Protection Act could prohibit the sale of lawfully purchased eagle parts.  The Court noted that the Act did not confiscate the owner's property, but rather regulated the terms of sale:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The regulations challenged here do not compel the surrender of the artifacts, and there is no physical invasion or restraint upon them. Rather, a significant restriction has been imposed on one means of disposing of the artifacts. But the [[Denial of request|denial]] of one traditional property right does not always amount to a taking. At least where an owner possesses [444 U.S. 51, 66] a full "bundle" of property rights, the destruction of one "strand" of the bundle is not a taking, because the aggregate must be viewed in its entirety. Compare Penn Central, supra, at 130–131, and ''United States v. Twin City Power Co.'', 350 U.S. 222 (1956), with ''[[Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon]]'', supra, and ''United States v. Virginia Electric &amp; Power Co.'', 365 U.S. 624 (1961). See also Michelman, Property, Utility, and Fairness: Comments on the Ethical Foundations of "Just Compensation" Law, 80 Harv. L. Rev. 1165, 1230–1233 (1967). In this case, it is crucial that appellees retain the rights to possess and transport their property, and to donate or devise the protected birds. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The fact that the statute barred the most profitable use of the property was not sufficient, the Court held:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is, to be sure, undeniable that the regulations here prevent the most profitable use of appellees' property. Again, however, that is not dispositive. When we review regulation, a reduction in the value of property is not necessarily equated with a taking. Compare ''Goldblatt v. Hempstead'', supra, at 594, and ''[[Hadacheck v. Sebastian]]'', 239 U.S. 394 (1915), with ''Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon'', supra.  In the instant case, it is not clear that appellees will be unable to derive economic benefit from the artifacts; for example, they might exhibit the artifacts for an admissions charge. At any rate, loss of future profits – unaccompanied by any physical property restriction – provides a slender reed upon which to rest a takings claim. Prediction of profitability is essentially a matter of reasoned speculation that courts are not especially competent to perform. Further, perhaps because of its very uncertainty, the interest in anticipated gains has traditionally been viewed as less compelling than other property-related interests. Cf., e. g., Fuller &amp; Perdue, The Reliance Interest in Contract Damages (pt. 1), 46 Yale L. J. 52 (1936). &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Agins===
One year after the eagle feather decision, the Court decided Agins v. Tiburon, 447 U.S. 255 (1980).   In Agins the Court stated that the application of land-use regulations to a particular piece of property is a taking when it denies the land's owner reasonable, viable use of it, or "if the ordinance does not substantially advance legitimate state interests … or denies an owner economically viable use of his land."   After landowners had acquired {{convert|5|acre|m2}} of unimproved land in a city for residential development, the city was required by California law to prepare a general plan governing land use and the development of open-space land. In response, the city adopted zoning ordinances that placed the owners' property in a zone in which property may be devoted to one-family dwellings, accessory buildings, and open-space uses, with density restrictions permitting appellants to build between one and five single-family residences on their tract. The city expressed its intention to acquire the Agins parcel for open space, and actually commenced condemnation proceedings to take title to it. Later, the city abandoned the condemnation, and adopted the ordinance in issue. Without having sought approval for development of their tract under the ordinances, appellants brought suit against the city in state court, alleging that the city had taken their property without just compensation in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The California Supreme Court departed from long-standing California precedent and held that monetary compensation was not available in regulatory taking cases which the court refused to recognize. That holding was eventually overruled by the U.S. Supreme Court a few years later in First English Evangelical Lutheran Church v. County of Los Angeles, 482 U.S. 304 (1987).

The U.S. Supreme Court held:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The application of a general zoning law to particular property effects a taking if the ordinance does not substantially advance legitimate state interests, see Nectow v. Cambridge, 277 U.S. 183, 188 (1928), or denies an owner economically viable use of his land, see Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City, 438 U.S. 104, 138, n. 36 (1978). The determination that governmental action constitutes a taking is, in essence, a determination that the public at large, rather than a single owner, must bear the burden of an exercise of state power in the public interest. Although no precise rule determines when property has been taken, see Kaiser Aetna v. United States, 444 U.S. 164 (1979), the question necessarily requires a weighing of private and public interests.  In this case, the law confers a reciprocal benefit:  it benefits all landowners,  serving the city's interest in assuring careful and orderly development of residential property with provision for open-space areas.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It took Bonnie Agins 30 years of litigation and administrative proceedings before she was permitted to build three houses on her {{convert|5|acre|m2|adj=on}} parcel.

'''Note that the "substantially advance"''' element of Agins, was later overruled in the Lingle case, where the court explained that its Agins opinion was mistaken on that point and that the "substantially advance" element was appropriate in substantive due process cases, not taking ones.

===Loretto decision===
In ''[[Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp.]]'', 458 U.S. 419 (1982), the Supreme Court ruled that a regulation is generally considered a ''[[wikt:per se|per se]]'' taking when it forces land owners to endure a '''permanent physical occupation''' on their land, such as the permanent physical presence of cable lines on a residential building.  The Court argued that any permanent physical presence destroyed the property owner's right to exclude, long recognized as one of the key rights in the "[[bundle of rights]]" commonly characterized as property. The Court considered a New York statute which required landlords to install CATV cable facilities on the roof of their buildings; the facilities were part of a citywide cable network designed to bring cable services to the entire city.  The landlords were required to provide a location for  {{convert|6|ft|m}} of cable one-half inch in diameter and two 4" x 4" x 4" metal boxes at a one-time charge determined by the Cable Commission at $1.  The City argued that the Court should apply a balancing test—that the invasion of property was minimal in comparison to the community wide benefit.  But the Court's decision suggested that there was a per se rule requiring compensation in cases of this kind.  In short, when the "character of the governmental action," is a permanent physical occupation of property, our cases uniformly have found a taking to the extent of the occupation, without regard to whether the action achieves an important public benefit or has only minimal  economic impact on the owner.

Yet, as the dissent in Loretto points out, there would seem to be all sorts of circumstances wherein the government may require installation of devices without compensation: "...the States traditionally – and constitutionally – have exercised their police power "to require landlords to . . . provide utility connections, mailboxes, smoke detectors, fire extinguishers, and the like in the common area of a building."  These provisions merely ensure tenants access to services the legislature deems important, such as water, electricity, natural light, telephones, inter-communication systems, and mail service.  It might be asked how does one  square these requirements with the requirement for compensation in Loretto.  Is it that the extinguishers belong to the landowner; is it that the extinguishers improve the value of the building, and so the compensation required is zero; or is it something else?

===Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council===
In the Penn Central case, the Supreme Court had described a three prong balancing test, which required a case by case analysis to determine if there had been a regulatory taking.  This meant that it was difficult to predict whether a particular regulation merited compensation.   Might there be situations in which there should be a "per se" rule requiring compensation?  In 1992, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a State regulation that '''deprives a property owner of all economically beneficial use''' of that property can be a taking.  ''[[Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council]]'', 505 U.S. 1003 (1992).   Lucas had purchased two residential lots on a South Carolina barrier island, intending to build single-family homes such as those on the immediately adjacent parcels.   At that time, Lucas's lots were not subject to the State's coastal zone building permit requirements.   In 1988, however, the state legislature enacted the Beachfront Management Act, which barred Lucas from erecting any permanent habitable structures on his parcels.   He filed suit against respondent state agency, contending that, even though the Act may have been a lawful exercise of the State's police power, the ban on construction deprived him of all "economically viable use" of his property and therefore effected a "taking" under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments that required the payment of just compensation.   The court further clarified, however, that a regulation is not a taking if it is consistent with "restrictions that background principles of the State's law of property and nuisance already placed upon ownership." As an example of "background principles," the court referred to the right of government to prevent flooding of others' property.  The Court noted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A review of the relevant decisions demonstrates that the "harmful or noxious use" principle was merely this Court's early formulation of the police power justification necessary to sustain (without compensation) any regulatory diminution in value;  that the distinction between regulation that "prevents harmful use" and that which "confers benefits" is difficult, if not impossible, to discern on an objective, value-free basis;  and that, therefore, noxious-use logic cannot be the basis for departing from this Court's categorical rule that total regulatory takings must be compensated....Although it seems unlikely that common-law principles would have prevented the erection of any habitable or productive improvements on Lucas's land, this state-law question must be dealt with on remand.   To win its case, respondent cannot simply proffer the legislature's declaration that the uses Lucas desires are inconsistent with the public interest, or the conclusory assertion that they violate a common-law maxim such as sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas, but must identify background principles of nuisance and property law that prohibit the uses Lucas now intends in the property's present circumstances.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following the Lucas U.S. Supreme Court decision, the Lucas case was remanded to the South Carolina Supreme Court which in turn remanded it to the trial court for a valuation trial. However, the case settled when the state bought Lucas' property, and later resold it to a developer.

===Nollan and Dolan===
{{main|Nollan v. California Coastal Commission}}

In ''Nollan v. California Coastal Commission'', 483 U.S. 825 the Court reviewed a regulation under which the [[California Coastal Commission]] demanded a lateral public easement across the Nollans' beachfront lot in exchange for a permit to demolish an existing bungalow and replace it with a three-bedroom house.   The public [[easement]] was designed to connect two public beaches that were separated by the Nollan's property.   The Coastal Commission had asserted that the public easement condition was imposed to promote the legitimate state interest of diminishing the "blockage of the view of the ocean" caused by construction of the larger house.  The Court observed that requiring a dedication of private property in exchange for a building permit was "out and out extortion" unless it could be shown that the private development imposed a burden on public facilities or resources, and the dedication would mitigate such impact. This became known as the "essential nexus" between a legitimate state interest and the permit condition.

{{main|Dolan v. City of Tigard}}

Then, in ''Dolan v. City of Tigard'', 512 U.S. 374 (1994) the Court evaluated further the degree of the connection required.  In that case, the City of [[Tigard, Oregon]] required any business owner seeking to expand substantially onto property adjacent to a floodplain, to create a public greenway and bike path from private land in order to prevent flooding and traffic congestion. The Supreme Court ruled that the City's requirement would be a taking if the City did not show that there was a reasonable relationship between the creation of the greenway and bike path and the impact of the development, and that the exaction was roughly proportional to the impact. "Without question, had the city simply required petitioner to dedicate a strip of land along Fanno Creek for public use, rather than conditioning the grant of her permit to redevelop her property on such a dedication, a taking would have occurred," the Court held.   " Such public access would deprive petitioner of the right to exclude others, "one of the most essential sticks in the bundle of rights that are commonly characterized as property."

Following remand, the Dolan case settled with the city paying Ms. Dolan several hundred thousand dollars.

===Bayview Homes===
In 1985, the Supreme Court applied its regulatory takings analysis to the Clean Water Act, which prohibits any discharge of dredged or fill materials into  "navigable waters"—defined as the "waters of the United States"—unless authorized by a permit issued by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] ("Corps").   ''[[United States v. Riverside Bayview Homes, Inc.]]'', 474 U.S. 121.  The Corps issued regulations construing the Act to cover all "freshwater wetlands" that are adjacent to other covered waters. These regulations defined the adjacent wetlands as "those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions."   Riverside Bayview Homes, Inc., began placing fill materials on its property near the shores of Lake St. Clair, Michigan.   A Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the Corps' interpretation, and suggested that the regulation would create a taking without just compensation in violation of the Fifth Amendment.

In its decision, the Supreme Court held that in order to be within the regulatory authority of the United States, these semi-aquatic characteristics would have to be the result of frequent flooding by the nearby navigable waters.   But the Supreme Court rejected the attempt to narrow the Corps of Engineer's regulatory reach.  Perhaps some particular properties might in individual cases be so adversely impacted that a taking might be found.  But this would not justify overturning the regulation itself.  "Governmental land-use regulation may under extreme circumstances amount to a 'taking' of the affected property.  See, e.g., ''Williamson County Regional Planning Comm'n v. Hamilton Bank'', 473 U.S. 172, 105 S.Ct. 3108, 87 L.Ed.2d 126 (1985);  ''Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City'', 438 U.S. 104, 98 S.Ct. 2646, 57 L.Ed.2d 631 (1978).   But mere assertion of regulatory jurisdiction by a governmental body does not constitute a regulatory taking.   See ''[[Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Reclamation Association]]'', 452  U.S. 264 (1981).    A requirement that a person obtain a permit before engaging in a certain use of his or her property does not itself "take" the property in any sense:  after all, the very existence of a permit system implies that permission may be granted, leaving the landowner free to use the property as desired.   Moreover, even if the permit is denied, there may be other viable uses available to the owner.   "[e]quitable relief is not available to enjoin an alleged taking of private property for a public use, duly authorized by law,  when a suit for compensation can be brought against the sovereign subsequent to a taking."   ''Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co.'', 467 U.S. 986 (1984)   This maxim rests on the principle that so long as compensation is available for those whose property is in fact taken, the governmental action is not unconstitutional.

===Palazzolo===
On June 28, 2001, the Court issued a significant chapter in the saga of regulatory takings with ''[[Palazzolo v. Rhode Island]]'', 533 U.S. 606 (2001).  Palazzolo addressed three issues that had been bedeviling the litigation of regulatory takings: When is a takings claim ripe?  When does notice of a preexisting regulation destroy the right to challenge the application of that regulation?  And how much use and value may a regulation destroy before compensation is due? For over forty years, Anthony Palazzolo owned, directly or indirectly, a valuable parcel of property in the ocean resort town of [[Westerly, Rhode Island]]. Shore Gardens, Inc. (Shore Gardens), acquired the property in 1959 and 1960. Mr. Palazzolo became the sole owner of Shore Gardens in 1960. The property consists of roughly eighteen acres of wetlands and a small indeterminate amount of uplands. The land was divided into seventy-four parcels in two subdivision map filings that occurred in 1936 and 1959. Just north of the property is Winnapaug Pond, an intertidal pond with an outlet to the Atlantic Ocean.   According to the state's biologist, "[l]and uses of Winnapaug Pond/Atlantic Beach area are moderate-to-heavy density seasonal development, residential and commercial; development directly adjacent to this site is moderate density seasonal dwellings." At the time of his application, the vicinity of Mr. Palazzolo's property was developed with vacation homes, mostly on the northern, western, and eastern boundaries of the pond and along the neighboring ocean beach. Mr. Palazzolo's property is bisected by a gravel road and there are several homes in the immediate vicinity; the road and homes were built on fill prior to the 1970s. Like the neighboring homes, the only way to develop Mr. Palazzolo's land is to raise the grade with fill.

In 1971, the [[Rhode Island Legislature]] authorized the Coastal Resources Management Council (CRMC) to regulate the filling of coastal wetlands.  The CRMC promulgated regulations requiring that any filling of coastal salt marsh, such as that found on Mr. Palazzolo's property, meet certain public interest requirements.   CRMC had ruled that private housing, and even low-income public housing, does not meet this public interest requirement.  Prior to the adoption of this regulatory regime, Mr. Palazzolo applied twice to utilize the property, in 1963 and in 1966, to the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) seeking permission to dredge Winnapaug Pond in order to develop the property. The State approved both applications in April 1971, finding that neither application would "'have any significant effect on wildlife.'"  Shortly thereafter, however, the State withdrew the approval, and Mr. Palazzolo did not appeal.

Mr. Palazzolo had an interest in the property through the 1960s and early 1970s as the sole shareholder of Shore Gardens. Eventually, Mr. Palazzolo let the corporation lapse, and its charter was revoked in 1978. At this point, the property "pass[ed] by operation of law to Palazzolo, its sole shareholder."  After that time, Mr. Palazzolo, now as the owner of the property in his individual capacity, twice more applied for permits to CRMC to fill the property. The first application, filed in 1983, like the one filed in 1963, was to fill approximately eighteen acres of the property. Unlike the original applications, this involved no dredging. Mr. Palazzolo expected that approval of this application would allow him to proceed with the development of homes on the seventy-four lots that had been previously subdivided, although the 1983 application was only for the preliminary step of filling the wetlands, not the development of homes. CRMC denied this application on July 12, 1984, and Mr. Palazzolo did not appeal the denial.

In 1985 Mr. Palazzolo applied to fill {{convert|11.4|acre|m2}}; like his 1966 application to DNR, he intended to prepare the site to make it suitable for a family beach recreational area. The plan called for the construction of a fifty-car parking lot with room for boat trailers and the provision of picnic tables, concrete barbecue pits, and portable toilets.  This plan was rejected in 1986. CRMC found that, in its natural state, Mr. Palazzolo's property provided the public benefits of "refuge and feeding areas for larval and juvenile finfish and shellfish and for migratory waterfowl and wading birds," "access of [f]auna . . . to cover areas," and that the property facilitates "the exchange of nutrient/waste products," and allows "sediment trapping," "flood storage," and "nutrient retention." Furthermore, the proposal failed to meet various regulatory criteria outlined in CRMC's CRMP regulations. For example, it found that Mr. Palazzolo's beach club was in "conflict" with CRMP Section 130(A)(1) because the proposed beach club did not serve "a compelling public purpose which provides benefits to the public as a whole as opposed to individual or private interests." Mr. Palazzolo unsuccessfully appealed the denial of the permit.

Based on the four denials over the span of twenty-three years, Mr. Palazzolo sued in 1988 for inverse condemnation, alleging that the property had a net value of $3,150,000. The trial court ruled against Mr. Palazzolo and the Rhode Island Supreme Court upheld the trial court's decision.  The court's first ground for affirming the trial court decision was that Mr. Palazzolo's claim was not ripe because he failed to apply for "less ambitious development plans." It found that the 1963 and 1983 applications sought to fill the entire {{convert|18|acre|m2}} of wetlands and (mistakenly) that the beach club applications sought to "fill all of the wetlands except for a fifty-foot strip."  The court concluded that Mr. Palazzolo should have filed another application to fill fewer acres of wetlands or to utilize just the upland area of the property.

The state Supreme Court also provided two other alternative bases for affirming the trial court decision. It held that because Mr. Palazzolo acquired the property in 1978 by virtue of the dissolution of Shore Gardens, he had acquired the property after the adoption of the regulations restricting the filling of wetlands and thus "had no reasonable investment-backed expectations."  Put another way, "the right to fill wetlands was not part of the title he acquired."  The court also found that Mr. Palazzolo "had not been deprived of all beneficial use of his property" because had he developed the upland portion of the land he could have realized some value from the property (approximately $200,000 compared to Palazzolo's estimate of a $3.1 million net value).  Alternatively, he could have realized "value in the amount of $157,000 as an open-space gift."

The Supreme Court reversed.  As a preliminary issue the Supreme Court addressed the question whether Palazzolo's case was "ripe" for review by the Courts.  In other words, had Palazollo done everything he could do to work through the regulatory system to avoid his loss.  The central question, the Court found, was whether Palazollo had obtained a final decision from the Council determining the permitted use for the land.  A number of previous cases have established "the important principle that a landowner may not establish a taking before a land-use authority has the opportunity, using its own reasonable procedures, to decide and explain the reach of a challenged regulation:

{{quote|Under our ripeness rules a takings claim based on a law or regulation which is alleged to go too far in burdening property depends upon the landowner's first having followed reasonable and necessary steps to allow regulatory agencies to exercise their full discretion in considering development plans for the property, including the opportunity to grant any variances or waivers allowed by law.   As a general rule, until these ordinary processes have been followed the extent of the restriction on property is not known and a regulatory taking has not yet been established.   See Suitum, supra, at 736, and n. 10, 117 S.Ct. 1659 (noting difficulty of demonstrating that "mere enactment" of regulations restricting land use effects a taking).   Government authorities, of course, may not burden property by imposition of repetitive or unfair land-use procedures in order to avoid a final decision.|Monterey v. Del Monte Dunes at Monterey, Ltd., 526 U.S. 687, 698, 119 S.Ct. 1624, 143 L.Ed.2d 882 (1999).}}

A final decision does not occur until the responsible agency determines the extent of permitted development on the land.  MacDonald, Sommer &amp; Frates v. Yolo County, 477 U.S. 340, 351.  But the landowner 

{{quote|obtained such a final decision when the Council denied his 1983 and 1985 applications.   The State Supreme Court erred in ruling that, notwithstanding those denials, doubt remained as to the extent of development the Council would allow on petitioner's parcel due to his failure to explore other uses for the property that would involve filling substantially less wetlands.  This is belied by the unequivocal nature of the wetland regulations at issue and by the Council's application of the regulations to the subject property.
&lt;br/&gt;
Since Mahon, we have given some, but not too specific, guidance to courts confronted with deciding whether a particular government action goes too far and effects a regulatory taking.   First, we have observed, with certain qualifications, that a regulation which "denies all economically beneficial or productive use of land" will require compensation under the Takings Clause.  ''Agins v. City of Tiburon'', 447 U.S. 255 (1980).   Where a regulation places limitations on land that fall short of eliminating all economically beneficial use, a taking nonetheless may have occurred, depending on a complex of factors including the regulation's economic effect on the landowner, the extent to which the regulation interferes with reasonable investment-backed expectations, and the character of the government action.  Penn Central, supra, at 124, 98 S.Ct. 2646.  These inquiries are informed by the purpose of the Takings Clause, which is to prevent the government from "forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole."|''Armstrong v. United States'', 364 U.S. 40 (1960)&lt;ref&gt;''Palazzolo'', 606 U.S. at 617–18&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Political significance==
The opening gun in the current fight over effects of stringent regulation of private property in America was fired in 1973 when the [[Council on Environmental Quality]] came out in favor of the British approach of viewing the right to develop land as a public rather than private right. To that end its proponents argued that there should be no such thing as a regulatory taking, and the owners of land subjected to confiscatory regulations should only be able to get a judicial declaration that the regulation is invalid. The owners' response has been that this is no remedy because it can take many years to get relief from the courts, and even when land owners win in court they remain uncompensated for potentially huge losses incurred during the legal battle, such as loss of the property by foreclosure. This doctrinal confrontation raged until 1987 when the U.S. Supreme Court decided ''[[First English Evangelical Lutheran Church v. County of Los Angeles]]'', in which it held that a taking of property was no less a taking when it was effected by non-physical means; i.e., by regulations that denied land owners use of their property, even when it did so on a temporary basis. Thus, whether physical or regulatory, a taking requires the payment of just compensation to the owner of the taken property.

The always controversial concept of regulatory taking has drawn much attention in more recent years, as legislation – some by [[ballot initiative]] – restricting land use regulations has been promoted in western states. The best known example was Oregon's adoption of law severely restricting the government's property regulation powers, and requiring compensation for diminution in value of the regulated property. In a few other states, legislatures adopted similar laws, a prominent example being Florida's Bert Harris Property Protection Act.

==Regulatory taking themes==

===Permit exhaustion===
One precondition of a regulatory takings claim is that the claimant must obtain a final decision by the regulating entity as to what uses will be permitted.  The Supreme Court's decisions make it clear that the mere assertion of regulatory jurisdiction by a governmental body does not constitute a regulatory taking.   See ''Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Reclamation Assn.'', 452  U.S. 264, 293–297(1981).

{{quote|The reasons are obvious.  A requirement that a person obtain a permit before engaging in a certain use of his or her property does not itself "take" the property in any sense:  after all, the very existence of a permit system implies that permission may be granted, leaving the landowner free to use the property as desired.   Moreover, even if the permit is denied, there may be other viable uses available to the owner.   Only when a permit is denied and the effect of the denial is to prevent "economically viable" use of the land in question can it be said that a taking has occurred.|United States v Riverside Bayview Homes, 474 US 121 (1985)}}

The [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] has established a number of tests under which a state regulation constitutes a taking ''[[wikt:per se|per se]]''. These are physical invasion, denial of all economically viable private property uses, or requiring the owners to dedicate some of their property to the government without a justifying reason for so doing. For example, when the owners' proposed land use will result in a significant increase in traffic they may be required to dedicate a strip of their land to improve an adjacent road. But when an action does not fall into a category addressed by one of these tests, the Court relies primarily on an [[ad hoc]] inquiry into the specifics of such individual case. This approach has been the subject of much criticism because of its unpredictability.

====Total takings test====
In ''[[Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council]]'', the Supreme Court ruled that a regulation that forbade construction on the owner's land thus depriving him of all economically beneficial uses constituted a ''[[wikt:per se|per se]]'' taking unless the proscribed use interests were not part of the title to begin with. In other words, a law or decree with the effect of depriving all economically beneficial use must do no more than duplicate the result that could have been achieved in the courts under the law of [[nuisance]].

====Unconstitutional conditions====
In ''[[Agins v. City of Tiburon]]'', the Court held that the application of restrictive zoning could violate the Takings Clause if it did not substantially advance legitimate governmental interests.  This rule was applied to invalidate conditions imposed on the issuance of building permits in ''[[Nollan v. California Coastal Commission]]'' and ''[[Dolan v. City of Tigard]]''.  However, in a 2005 decision, ''[[Lingle v. Chevron U.S.A. Inc.]]'', the Court rejected the ''Agins'' standard as a general test for regulatory takings.  While ''Lingle'' expressly overruled the ''Agins'' test opting instead for the ''Penn. Central'' balancing test, the heightened scrutiny for exactions of private property articulated in ''Nollan'' and ''Dolan'' as well as the 2 categorical per se rules from ''Lucas'' and ''Loretto'' still apply in narrow circumstances.

====The denominator problem====
In the Penn Central Case, the Supreme Court ruled that taking law does not divide property into discrete segments and therefore a taking occurs only when an owner's entire ownership is excessively regulated, and the owners are therefore not entitled to compensation where a part of their land remains economically viable. This gave rise to the question of what is the "denominator" of the ownership fraction; i.e., what is the larger ownership whose part is being subjected to confiscatory regulation, since the regulatory taking of a part of it (the "numerator") is not compensable.

The question thus arises:  What is the "denominator" of the regulated parcel?  For example: in ''[[Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon]]'' (260 U.S. 393) Pennsylvania Coal owned the [[mineral rights]] in a property (as well as the  right to surface support under Pennsylvania law), and Mahon owned the [[surface rights]] of that land. Relying on Pennsylvania statutory law, the surface owners wanted mining under their [surface] land stopped to prevent subsidence. The court agreed with the coal company and held that the state statute forbidding such mining was a taking of the coal company's property.

Thus, the Pennsylvania Coal Company suffered a 100% taking, because all of its property (the underground coal deposits) had been effectively extinguished by the regulation. It could no longer extract its own coal. On the other hand, under the more recent Penn Central approach, if one defines the "denominator" as the total property rights in a particular parcel (i.e., both surface and mineral rights), then there would be only a partial taking, because the mineral rights were only a part of the total rights in the property (even if those rights were distributed between two owners). This theory was more recently applied by the U S Court of Appeals in Whitney Benefits v. United States, holding that a federal regulation forbidding strip mining of large coal deposits in Wyoming, took the owners' property, requiring payment of compensation which, with interest and attorneys' fees, came to $200 million

In his dissent to ''Pennsylvania Coal'', Justice Brandeis argued that inasmuch as the police power regulation promoted public safety, the state statute forbidding mining under inhabited land trumped the coal company's property right to its coal. That theory has gained acceptance in the Supreme Court case of ''[[Keystone Bituminous Coal Ass'n v. DeBenedictis]]'' (480 U.S. 470) but only to the extent that the prohibition of mining was partial, not total.

'''The Royal Library''' ({{lang-da|Det Kongelige Bibliotek}}) in [[Copenhagen]] is the [[national library]] of [[Denmark]] and the [[university library]] of the [[University of Copenhagen]]. It is among the [[List of largest libraries|largest libraries]] in the world and the largest in the [[Nordic countries]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Kunst_og_kultur/Bog-_og_biblioteksv%C3%A6sen/Videnskabelige_og_faglige_biblioteker/Det_Kongelige_Bibliotek Den store danske: Det kongelige bibliotek {{Da icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 it merged with the [[State and University Library, Denmark|State and University Library]] in [[Aarhus]] to form a combined national library.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://kum.dk/nyheder-og-presse/pressemeddelelser/nyheder/det-nye-nationalbibliotek-kommer-til-at-hedde-det-kgl-bibliotek/1/1/|title=Det nye nationalbibliotek kommer til at hedde Det Kgl. Bibliotek|access-date=2018-03-03|language=da}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combined library organisation (the separate library locations in Copenhagen and Aarhus are maintained) is known as the [[Royal Danish Library]] ({{lang-da|Det Kgl. Bibliotek}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.kb.dk/en/kb/organisation/fusion/start.html|title=The new Royal Danish Library | publisher=Royal Danish Library |access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It contains numerous historical treasures, and a copy of all works printed in Denmark since the 17th century are deposited there. Thanks to extensive donations in the past, the library holds nearly all known Danish printed works back to and including the first Danish books, printed in 1482 by [[Johann Snell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Kunst_og_kultur/Bog-_og_biblioteksv%C3%A6sen/Boghistorie_og_bogtryk/Johann_Snell|title=Johann Snell|publisher=''[[Den Store Danske]]''|accessdate=28 August 2017 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The library was founded in 1648 by [[Frederick III of Denmark|King Frederik III]], who contributed a comprehensive collection of European works. It was opened to the public in 1793. 

In 1989, it was merged with the prestigious [[Copenhagen University Library]] (founded in 1482) (UB1). In 2005, it was merged with the Danish National Library for Science and Medicine (UB2), now the Faculty Library of Natural and Health Sciences. The official name of the organization as of 1 January 2006 is '''The Royal Library, the National Library of Denmark and the Copenhagen University Library'''. In 2008, the Danish Folklore Archive was merged with the Royal Library.

===Librarians===
The first librarian was Marcus Meibom, followed 1663-1671 by [[Peder Griffenfeld]].&lt;ref&gt;Albert Fabricius: Det kongelige Biblioteks Embedsmænd og Funktionærer 1653-1943, 1943&lt;/ref&gt; Later librarians included J. H. Schlegel, Jon Erichsen, [[Daniel Gotthilf Moldenhawer]] (1787-1823 notorious for stealing numerous books to enrich the library collections) and Chr. Bruun. Since 1900 the former librarians are [[H.O. Lange]] (1901-1924), Carl S. Petersen (1924-1943), Svend Dahl (1943-1952), Palle Birkelund (1952-1982), Torkil Olsen (1982-1986), [[Erland Kolding Nielsen]] (1986-2017), followed by the present Director General Svend Larsen.

==Items collected== 
Books, journals, newspapers, pamphlets and corporate publications, manuscripts and archives, maps, prints and photographs, music scores, documentation of folkways and popular traditions, four annual electronic copies of the Danish Internet by legal deposit.

Physical collections size: 35,400,000 items (6,400,000 books and journals, 20,000,000 prints and photographs, 7,900,000 pamphlets and corporate publications, 1,100,000 other materials). Digital collections: 791,000 [[Gigabyte]] (GB) (676,000 GB legal deposit, 116,000 GB retrodigitizied collections).&lt;ref name="Årsberetning"&gt;All figures are from: ''Årsberetning 2015'' (Annual Report 2015) [http://www.kb.dk/export/sites/kb_dk/da/kb/aarsberetning/aarsberetninger/2015.pdf] {{Da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Royal Library today==
Today, The Royal Library has five sites: The main library at [[Slotsholmen]], Copenhagen harbour (in the [[Black Diamond (library)|Black Diamond]]), covering all subjects and special collections; one at [[Nørre Alle]], Faculty Library of Natural and Health Sciences; one at Gothersgade, central Copenhagen, Faculty Library of Social Sciences; one at [[Amager]], Faculty Library of Humanities; and, one in Studiestræde, central Copenhagen, The Faculty of Law Library. The annual circulation is 11,400,000 loans (10,900,000 of these are electronic loans). The members are 32,196 active users. The annual budget: 394M Danish Kroner (58M US Dollars), including building expenses and maintenance.

The library is open to anyone above the age of 18 with a genuine need to use the collections. Special rules apply for use of rare and valuable items.

==Buildings at the Slotsholmen site==
The old building of the Slotsholmen site was built in 1906 by [[Hans Jørgen Holm]]. The central hall is a copy of [[Charlemagne]]'s Palace chapel in the [[Aachen Cathedral]]. The building is still being used by the library.[[File:Black Diamond, Copenhagen, by Peter Pihlmann Pedersen.jpg|thumb|Panoramic view of the new building opened in 1999 (taken by Peter Pihlmann Pedersen, 2013)]]
In 1999, a new building adjacent to the old one was opened at Slotsholmen, known as the [[Black Diamond (library)|Black Diamond]]. The Black Diamond building was designed by Danish architects [[schmidt hammer lassen]]. Named for its outside cover of black [[marble]] and glass, the Black Diamond building houses a concert hall in addition to the library.

The Black Diamond is formed by two black cubes that are slightly tilted over the street. In between, there is an eight-storey atrium whose walls are white and wave-shaped, with a couple of transversal corridors that link both sides, and balconies on every floor. The atrium's exterior wall is made of glass; so, you can see the sea; and, on the opposite shore, you can see Christianshavn's luxury buildings.

Three bridges connect the Black Diamond with the old part of the Royal Library; those three bridges (two small ones for internal transport and a big one with the circulation desk) go over the road. At the ceiling of the big bridge, there is a huge painting by Danish painter [[Per Kirkeby]].

[[File:Nuevacoronica.jpg|thumb|left|upright|First page of the ''Primer nueva corónica y buen gobierno'' of Guamán Poma de Ayala]]

==Significant holdings==
The Royal Library acquires Danish books through legal deposit. The holdings include an almost complete collection of all Danish printed books back from 1482. In 2006, legal deposit was extended to electronic publications and now the library harvests four electronic copies of the Danish Internet each year. The library also holds a large and significant collection of old foreign scholarly and scientific literature, including  precious books of high value and of importance for book history, including a rare copy of the [[Gutenberg Bible]].

The library holds treasures which are inscribed on [[UNESCO]]'s [[Memory of the World Register]]: A collection of about 2,000 books by and about [[Carl Linnaeus|Carl Linné]] (1997);&lt;ref name=mow&gt;{{cite web|title=The Linné Collection|url=http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=22884&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|date=2008-05-16|publisher=UNESCO Memory of the World Programme|accessdate=2009-12-11}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; the manuscripts and correspondence of [[Hans Christian Andersen]] (1997);&lt;ref name=mowroyal&gt;{{cite web|title=Manuscripts and correspondence of Hans Christian Andersen|url=http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=22664&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|date=2008-05-16|publisher=UNESCO Memory of the World Programme|accessdate=2009-12-15}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Søren Kierkegaard]] Archives (manuscripts and personal papers) (1997); [[Guamán Poma de Ayala]]'s ''El [[Primer Nueva Coronica y Buen Gobierno]]'', an autographed manuscript of 1,200 pages including 400 full-page drawings depicting the indigenous point of view on pre-conquest Andean life and Inca rule, the Spanish conquest in 1532, early Spanish colonial rule, and the systematic abuse of the rights of the indigenous populationt (2007).&lt;ref name=mowandean&gt;{{cite web|title=El Primer Nueva Coronica y Buen Gobierno|url=http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=22485&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|date=2008-05-16|publisher=UNESCO Memory of the World Programme|accessdate=2009-12-15}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Biblia Latina''.

Other treasures are the [[Copenhagen Psalter]], the Dalby Book (a Latin Gospel on parchment), the Angers fragment (parts of Denmark's first national chronicle), and maps of the Polar Region. The library also holds important collections of Icelandic manuscripts, primarily in ''Den gamle kongelige samling'' (The Old Royal Collection) and ''Den nye kongelige samling'' (The New Royal Collection). Denmark's most outstanding Icelandic collection, the [[Arnamagnæan Manuscript Collection]], is however not a holding of The Royal Library but of the [[University of Copenhagen]].

==Book thefts==
Between 1968 and 1978, the library saw one of the largest book thefts in history. Someone had managed to steal some 1,600 historical books worth more than $50 million, including prints by [[Martin Luther]] and first editions by [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Thomas More]] and [[John Milton]]. The theft remained undetected until 1975. Between 1998 and 2002, the thief succeeded in selling books worth about $2 million at various auctions. The case was finally solved in September 2003, after a stolen book had surfaced at [[Christie's]] auction house in [[London]]. The thief, a director of the library's oriental department named Frede Møller-Kristensen, had died in January 2003. His family then became careless in selling the remaining books. At a coordinated raid of the family's homes in Germany and Denmark in November 2003, some 1,500 books were recovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jørgensen|first=Jesper Düring|date=2007-04-19|title=The Anatomy of a Crime Discovery after 25 Years.

In April 2005, a daughter of the thief was also found guilty.

'''SIAE''' ({{lang-en|Italian Society of Authors and Publishers, Italian: Società Italiana degli Autori ed Editori}}) is the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Copyright collective|copyright collecting agency]]. Founded in 1882 in the [[Kingdom of Italy]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.normattiva.it/uri-res/N2Ls?urn:nir:stato:legge:1941-04-22;633!vig= N° 633/1941 LEGGE 22 aprile 1941, n. 633]&lt;/ref&gt; it is the monopolist intermediary between the authors of musical tracks and consumers, managing the economic aspects and the distribution of money from [[royalties]] of Italian-copyrighted music to authors and on their behalf.&lt;ref name="siae2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siae.it/Faq_siae.asp?open_menu=yes&amp;link_page=siae_faq_en.htm&amp;click_level=4000.0100|title=SIAE FAQ about copyrights|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2000s and 2010s, SIAE is known for the controversial decision to claim payment through the "[[Private copying levy|Private Copy Siae Tax]]" for every blank [[CD]], [[DVD]], and [[Hard disk drive|HDD]] sold in [[Italy]] since 2001.&lt;ref name="dday1"/&gt; From 2013 to February 2015, the main spokesperson of the SIAE organization was the songwriter [[Gino Paoli]], who was the president of the society.&lt;ref name="dday1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dday.it/redazione/11288/Compensi-SIAE-l15-anche-sugli-Smart-TV-Ed-solo-linizio.html|title=Compensi SIAE: l'1,5% anche sugli Smart TV. Ed è solo l'inizio|work=DDay.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paoli resigned after he was investigated for [[tax evasion]];&lt;ref name="ilmessaggero.it"&gt;http://www.ilmessaggero.it/PRIMOPIANO/CRONACA/gino_paoli_evasione_soldi_svizzera_intercettazioni/notizie/1198901.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; [[Filippo Sugar]] was then appointed as a president. The current president is [[Mogol (lyricist)|Mogol]], famous italian lyricist.

==History==

===Foundation and early years: 1882–2014 ===

The SIAE was founded by a selfmade statute&lt;ref name="pdf1"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040313155527/http://www.ubertazzi.it/it/codice/doc542.pdf Extract of the first SIAE statute, 1882]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Milan]], Kingdom of Italy, on 23 April 1882. Among the first notably names to join the Corporation there were the Italian poet [[Giosuè Carducci]] (1835–1907) and the Italian musician [[Giuseppe Verdi]] (1813–1901).&lt;ref name="siae2"/&gt; SIAE is ruled by the law ''Siae Copyright'', no.633/1941 in 1941, emanated in Rome, Kingdom of Italy.

===Resignation of the President for tax evasion: February 2015–March 2015===

In February 2015, Police raided the residence of the President of the SIAE association [[Gino Paoli]] to probe an illicit two millions euro transfer to a Swiss bank in 2009 for [[Evasion (law)|tax evasion]].&lt;ref name="ilmessaggero.it"/&gt;

===Filippo Sugar SIAE President and his Conflict of interest: March 2015===

After the dimission of the former SIAE President for tax evasion investigation, SIAE elected as new president [[Filippo Sugar]].

The new SIAE president said that SIAE isn't meant for grant equal rights for everyone,&lt;ref&gt;http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2010/02/08/la-battaglia-di-sugar-in-nome-della.html&lt;/ref&gt; he is also the owner  of the music label Sugar Music Spa &lt;ref&gt;http://www.repubblica.it/spettacoli/musica/2015/03/21/news/siae_filippo_sugar-110137343/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2015/03/19/siae-eletto-presidente-filippo-sugar-prendera-posto-gino-paoli/1519853/&lt;/ref&gt;

===EU's Law to terminate the SIAE money collecting monopoly: 2016===

The European Parliament decided that the SIAE monopoly on the preventive taxation of the storage media, TVs and smartphones was to end by April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.agoravox.it/Nel-2016-la-fine-del-monopolio.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deposit at SIAE==
SIAE exercises the author's right on behalf of their legitimate owners. Authors' right has two distinct components: economic and moral. 
Italian law does not require a deposit since Berne Convention provides that the rights are first acquired upon creation of the work and therefore it is possible to prove the ownership by other means such as Copyzero. 
According to Article 180 bis, subscription is mandatory only for cable retransmission (not such a widespread technology in Italy), while broadcasting, both via radio and television, is not included.

===Subscription===
Authors can entrust the management of their work to SIAE both by association and mandate. Authors can address the Associates and Principals Service and the Public Relations Office through form n. 483. Associates have a right to run as candidates and to vote for the corporate bodies of the society, for the board of directors and for the supervisory committee. They have to pay an annual fee as opposed to Principals, who have to renew the copyright protection every four years and are allowed to subscribe to Music, Opera and DOR (theatre, radio and television works) Sections through form n. 489 and to Cinema and OLAF (visual arts and literary works) Sections through form n. 487. Non-EU authors, publishers and dealers are not allowed to become associates and therefore have to give mandate to SIAE in order to get legal protection for their works. Minors can subscribe for free through form n. 488. The mandate expires on the 31st of December of the author's eighteenth year.

===Pseudonyms and stage names===
Upon payment, associates are allowed to register their works under a pseudonym or a stage name. Though from an etymological perspective, there is not a big difference between pseudonyms and stage names, SIAE claims that pseudonyms are mere alternatives to birth names while a stage name is instantly recognizable to both fans and media. Protecting a work of art under a stage name is cheaper than protecting it under a pseudonym, but the authors need to supply the documentation (newspaper articles, websites, posters) proving that they're really famous under that specific name.

===Deposit of works===
In order to deposit their works, the authors need to deliver to the closest SIAE office an application form signed by all the authors and an unpublished copy of the work through a form called “modello 112”, available in all SIAE offices in Italy. Associates can deposit musical works for free. When depositing audiovisual works, the case containing the work must be signed too. SIAE also requires the author to present the payment notification for the registration.

===Musical work registration===
In order to protect musical works, the creators need to be registered to SIAE. If the musical work arises from the creativity of a group of people, each member needs to be registered. If some of the members are not associated neither to SIAE nor to foreign institutions connected with SIAE, a “dichiarazione liberatoria form” for non members is required in order to allow the rightholders to manage the work. 
In order to register a song, authors need to fill the work registration form (“modello 112”), also attaching the music score (at least the melody transcription) and lyrics. Needless to say, a full music score is easier to identify. For electronic or concrete music or, only in exceptional cases, chamber or symphonic music, that cannot be transcribed into readable notation, it is possible to deposit the recording. Members' names and their specific creative role must result from the score and from the registration form. 
The international confederation of Authors' Societies connected with SIAE enables the protection of works outside Italy. These societies collect revenues depending on their fees, detract their commission and hand over the remaining part to SIAE, which in turn distributes it between the rightholders (authors, record producers, performers).

===Phonogram production and SIAE===
According to copyright law, record companies use musical works for commercial purposes by recording, reproducing and selling them. Since SIAE acts as a mediator, record producers (who hold the economic rights according to article 72 of the Legge 22 Aprile 1941, n. 633, on the subject of “Copyright protection and other related rights”), must affix the SIAE sticker to the record and must deposit royalties to SIAE, which in turn is responsible for distributing them between authors and publishers of the work. 
If the company deals both with record production and musical publishing, it will be required to deposit royalties on one hand, while, on the other, will benefit from the same royalties as a SIAE associate (the publisher owns the copyright, by virtue of the contracts with the authors, and thus is one of the rightholders).

===SIAE and Creative Commons===
SIAE bans its associates from using Creative Commons Licenses. 
On 23 December 2008, a mixed legal working group, composed of both SIAE and Creative Commons Italia members was announced. The aim of the group was to allow the authors to choose free and easy-to-use licenses, keeping the commercial use to themselves, and relying on SIAE only for distribution and collection of revenues, but nothing came of it. 
The first example of Creative Commons license integrated with a copyright collecting agency was born in the Netherlands and paved the way to more flexible licenses, leaving authors free to use and advertise their works. 
This choice depended on the new frontiers of computer science, that allowed the authors to publish their works online, which would have been a sort of theft according to previous rules. 
The only solution for those who wanted to distribute their works online for free, was Creative Commons licence that was able to protect them from plagiarism for commercial purposes, thanks to its “non commercial” clause. Thus the artist was able to take advantage of Internet speed to advertise his work, making profit from merchandising and live performances. 
Therefore, the artists are now able to release a work under a “non commercial” Creative Commons licence in order to protect and distribute it and have the chance to make commercial use of it while Buma/Stemra, the Netherland equivalent of SIAE, is responsible for collecting and distributing the revenues.

== Results ==
SIAE’s financial results were subject matter for discussion. 
Over the past three years, as evidenced in the Reports of Management approved by the Ministry of Economy and Finance and by the Ministry of Culture, a positive trend for the net income has been registered. The result for the years 2013 to 2015 is positive: in detail 1.6 million Euros in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siae.it/documents/Siae_Documentazione_BILANCIOSIAE2013.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; 3.5 million euro in 2014&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.siae.it/sites/default/files/Rendiconto%20di%20Gestione%202014.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; and to EUR 0.31 million in 2015&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.siae.it/sites/default/files/Rendiconto%20di%20Gestione%202015.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; have been registered.

==Income==

===Preventive taxation===
Since 2001, SIAE collects a [[private copying levy]], called ''Equo compenso'' ("''Fair fee''"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beniculturali.it/mibac/export/MiBAC/sito-MiBAC/Contenuti/Ministero/UfficioStampa/ComunicatiStampa/visualizza_asset.html_561102399.html|title=Decreto ministeriale 30 dicembre 2009, adottato ai sensi dell'articolo 71-septies della legge 22 aprile 1941, n. 633|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; on media storage devices sold in Italy, assuming in advance that the user will store a private copy of copyright protected material.  The preventive taxation is applied on [[photographic film]], [[Compact Cassette|tape]], [[VHS]]s, [[CD]]s, [[DVD]]s, [[HD DVD]]s, [[Blu ray Disc]]s, [[optical disc drive]]s, [[hard disk drive]]s, [[USB flash drive]]s, [[memory card]]s, [[personal computer]]s, [[set-top box]]es, [[Mobile digital media player|digital media players]], [[mobile phone]]s, etc.
The total amount of revenues collected is estimated by [[Confindustria]] and Assinform (Italian Tassociation of [[information technology]]) at €300 million per year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.repubblica.it/tecnologia/2010/01/15/news/tassa_pc_telefonini-1953830/ Tassa su pc e telefonini per dare soldi alla SIAE] from [[la Repubblica]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ferrazza.blogautore.espresso.repubblica.it/2010/01/15/equo-compenso-equo/ Equo compenso. Equo?] from [[L'espresso]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.punto-informatico.it/2787994/PI/Commenti/equo-compenso.aspx|title=Equo compenso?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite this, SIAE declares that it is not fully satisfied with the amount currently established by the decree as it is not totally "fair".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siae.it/edicola.asp?click_level=0500.0100.0200&amp;view=4&amp;id_news=8880|title=Firmato il decreto per il compenso di copia privata|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 November 2013, the Italian Minister [[Massimo Bray]] (Beni Culturali) supported the decision to establish new taxes, with revenue going to the SIAE, for certain electronic goods, such as [[HDTV]]s and [[Personal video recorder|PVRs]].  This is controversial since there is no direct connection between paying the SIAE and purchasing a new HDTV or a PVR.&lt;ref name="dday1"/&gt;

On 15 December 2013, it's revealed that the SIAE organization had a hand in writing the new amendment to the law resulting in increased revenues of about €150.000.000 during 2014 from the tax on smart TVs, PVRs, hard disks, blank DVDs, CDs and smartphones (all goods that are sold without media content bundled, so the ratio legis is inconsistent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sideri |first=Massimo |date=16 December 2013 |title=Tassa sugli smartphone, la Siae si scrive il decreto; L’obiettivo: raccogliere da 130 a 200 milioni di euro |url=http://www.corriere.it/economia/13_dicembre_15/tassa-smartphone-siae-si-scrive-decreto-4a097224-655d-11e3-95f1-73e6b5fcc151.shtml |newspaper=[[Corriere della Sera]] |location= |publisher=RCS MediaGroup |language=Italian }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dday.it/redazione/11452/La-SIAE-detta-al-Ministero-nuovi-compensi-per-150-mln.html|title=La SIAE detta al Ministero nuovi compensi per 150 mln|work=DDay.it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taxation on non-lucrative events or activities===
SIAE may claim compensation for non-profit events.  There have been several emblematic cases that raised criticism, for example payment requests to associations for singing traditional songs at impromptu parties,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Blitz della SIAE alla festa, multati i bimbi di Chernobyl|url=http://www.peacelink.it/mediawatch/a/18471.html|author=Paolo Russo|magazine=[[la Repubblica#Edizioni locali|la Repubblica - Cronaca di Bari]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122230222/http://www.peacelink.it/mediawatch/a/18471.html|archivedate=22 January 2010|deadurl=no|date=3 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=La SIAE batte cassa per i canti alla festa degli ultranovantenni|url=http://www.ladige.it/news/cronaca/2009/10/29/siae-batte-cassa-canti-festa-ultranovantenni|author=M.

The claim of SIAE to request [[copyright]] compensation for educational activities has been discussed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senato.it/japp/bgt/showdoc/showText?tipodoc=Sindisp&amp;leg=15&amp;id=251650|title=Interrogazione parlamentare|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Italian Government]] by the Italian senator Mauro Bulgarelli, who proposed to extend the concept of "[[fair use]]" in Italy.

===Taxation on movie trailers===
In October 2011, the SIAE began requiring a license fee from websites hosting movie trailers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.repubblica.it/tecnologia/2011/10/29/news/trailer_web-24101677/ Tassa SIAE sui trailer dei film, sul web scatta la rivolta] from [[la Repubblica]] of 29 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://espresso.repubblica.it/dettaglio/la-siae-e-i-trailer-che-brutto-film/2165257/ La SIAE e i trailer, che brutto film] from [[l'Espresso]] of 10 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; which had been considered "[[fair use]]" for promotional purposes. This license, starting at €1000 per year, would be required even if the trailer is embedded and resides on another site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siae.it/edicola.asp?click_level=0500.0100.0200&amp;view=4&amp;open_menu=yes&amp;id_news=10669|title=SIAE: Diritto d'autore anche per le musiche dei trailer|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decision raised many doubts and criticism even by well-known directors and actors&lt;ref&gt;[[Paolo Virzì]]: [http://www.asca.it/news-CINEMA__TRAILER_A_PAGAMENTO__VIRZI___SPERO_DISTORSIONE_GIORNALISTICA-1062344-ORA-.html "Iniziativa più insensata che goffa" (fonte ASCA)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201051358/http://www.asca.it/news-CINEMA__TRAILER_A_PAGAMENTO__VIRZI___SPERO_DISTORSIONE_GIORNALISTICA-1062344-ORA-.html |date=1 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Massimo Boldi]]: [http://www.asca.it/news-CINEMA__TRAILER_A_PAGAMENTO__MASSIMO_BOLDI____TASSA_INGIUSTA__-1062349-ATT-.html "Tassa ingiusta" (fonte ASCA)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201084651/http://www.asca.it/news-CINEMA__TRAILER_A_PAGAMENTO__MASSIMO_BOLDI____TASSA_INGIUSTA__-1062349-ATT-.html |date=1 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Luca Miniero]]: [http://www.asca.it/news-CINEMA__TASSA_SUI_TRAILER__MINIERO____A_ME_SEMBRA_UNA_FOLLIA__-1062323-ORA-.html "A me sembra una follia" (fonte ASCA)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201051339/http://www.asca.it/news-CINEMA__TASSA_SUI_TRAILER__MINIERO____A_ME_SEMBRA_UNA_FOLLIA__-1062323-ORA-.html |date=1 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Federica Lucisano]]: [http://www.asca.it/news-CINEMA__FEDERICA_LUCISANO____IGNOBILE___TASSA_SUI_TRAILER-1062329-ATT-.html "Tassa ignobile" (fonte: ASCA)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201044255/http://www.asca.it/news-CINEMA__FEDERICA_LUCISANO____IGNOBILE___TASSA_SUI_TRAILER-1062329-ATT-.html |date=1 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Enrico Vanzina]]: [http://www.asca.it/news-CINEMA__TASSARE_TRAILER_IN_RETE__VANZINA__NORMA_INGIUSTA-1062261-ATT-.html "Norma ingiusta" (fonte ASCA)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201052921/http://www.asca.it/news-CINEMA__TASSARE_TRAILER_IN_RETE__VANZINA__NORMA_INGIUSTA-1062261-ATT-.html |date=1 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and caused the withdrawal of the video content on some sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fantascienza.com/magazine/notizie/15745/rimossi-i-video-fine-dei-trailer-sul-web/|title=Fantascienza.com rimuove i video|author=Delos Books a.c.; html/php: Silvio Sosio|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==

All music songwriters and composers in Italy must send a mandate document to the SIAE or s/he must be an SIAE subscriber (registration fee is €129.59 and annual fees are €151.81).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tropicodellibro.it/notizie/costi-siae/|title=table of fees for Authors|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Authors who choose to register as associates can (with additional payment) register their works under a pseudonym or professional name.
All CD Albums sold in Italy must have an adhesive label affixed directly on the CD [[Jewel case#Jewel case|jewel case]]).
The mandatory fee paid to the SIAE, grants permission to musicians, bands and DJs to cover songs or play Italian copyrighted music.

===Imbalances in royalty distribution and member rights===
* 65% of artists registered with the SIAE receive royalties totalling less than their registration fees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2010/07/30/sprechi-di-stato-il-caso-siae/ Sprechi di Stato: il caso SIAE] from [[il Fatto Quotidiano]] of 30 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The influence of a vote in assembly decisions is not the same for all members, but varies according to the amount of royalties received by the member.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2012/11/26/nuovo-statuto-siae-ora-la-cultura-e-ufficialmente-in-vendita/ Nuovo statuto SIAE, ora la cultura è ufficialmente in vendita] from [[il Fatto Quotidiano]] of 26 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://scorza.blogautore.espresso.repubblica.it/2012/12/02/nuova-siae-perseverare-e-diabolico/ Nuova SIAE: perseverare è diabolico] from [[l'Espresso]] of 2 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.audiocoop.it/news/?id_news=37140|title=CREA contro il nuovo statuto SIAE|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* SIAE plays a major role in the "''Comitato consultivo permanente per il diritto d'autore''" (Permanent Advisory Committee of copyright) according to rules established under the [[corporatism|corporate law]].
* SIAE is a legal monopoly in Italy, granted by the State to perform mediation activities.  The issue of the actual fairness of such a position has been repeatedly raised.  Some institutions, such as the [[FIMI]], ask for an amendment in favor of a more competitive market.

===Unequal redistribution of revenues===
The money the SIAE receives from the music royalties redistribution system is regulated by SIAE itself. A large part of the management rights for music tracks is entirely entrusted to the SIAE, which is also entrusted with safeguarding the interests of musicians. The phenomenon of a State granting exclusive intermediation activities to a single group that has been active since 1882, is currently happening only in Italy.&lt;ref name=IBL89&gt;{{cite book|title=L'intermediazione dei diritti d'autore: Perché il monopolio è costoso e inefficiente|author=Diego Menegon|url=http://www.brunoleonimedia.it/public/BP/IBL_BP_89_SIAE.pdf|publisher=[[Istituto Bruno Leoni]]|series=IBL Briefing Paper|date=19 July 2010|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the largest portion of income (€46.000.000) was redistributed to only 146 artists. Michele Guardì, the director of Italian TV shows ''[[Uno Mattina]]'' and ''[[Domenica In]]'' broadcast by Italy's national public broadcasting company [[Rail transport|RAI]] (owned by the Ministry of Economy and Finance) earned the majority of the SIAE income in 2013. He received even more money from the SIAE than popular Italian singers [[Vasco Rossi]] and [[Luciano Ligabue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economiaefinanza.blogosfere.it/2013/03/compensi-siae-guardi-guadagna-piu-di-ligabue.html|title=Compensi Siae: Guardì guadagna più di Ligabue|author=RobertoBosio|work=economiaefinanza}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competitors==
[[Soundreef]] is an alternative to SIAE since 2011, both Italian singers J-Ax, Fedez, Ruggeri works with this company and has left siae in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dday.it/redazione/25310/enrico-ruggeri-e-j-ax-passano-a-soundreef-il-direttore-siae-scelta-incomprensibile&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5421">A '''scopist''' edits the [[transcript (law)|transcript]]s of official proceedings, created by [[court reporter]]s.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncra.org/content.cfm?ItemNumber=8609|title=Scopists - NCRA|website=[[National Court Reporters Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Court reporters attend official proceedings such as court hearings and transcribe the spoken word to written text, mostly using [[stenotype]] machines or voice mask equipment.   Scopists receive the rough copies of these transcripts after the proceedings, check the transcript for missing words or mistakes, edit grammar and punctuation, ensure that proper names and technical or scientific terms are spelled correctly, and format the transcript properly before delivering the transcript back to the court reporter.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

== Skills ==

Scopists need excellent grammar, punctuation, vocabulary, and research skills, as well as good knowledge of legal terminology, medical terminology, and transcript production.  They are typically voracious readers, gatherers of eclectic knowledge, and adept users of technology.&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, Faye.  "The Proof Is in the Proofing."  ''The Journal of Court Reporting'' September 2006: 38-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Training ==

The major court reporting associations in North America do not presently administer certification for scopists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncra.org/Certifications/|title=Certifications and CEUs - NCRA|website=National Court Reporters Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaert.org/?page=CertificationOnline|title=Certification Online Info – American Association of Electronic Reporters and Transcribers|website=American Association of Electronic Reporters and Transcribers (AAERT)}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, scopist training is available through specialized schools of scopistry and through community colleges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sober|first1=William|first2=Linda A.|last2=Knipes-Sober|title=Chapter 4:  Scopist Training.|work=Scopistry: An In-depth Look at the Scopist Profession and Handbook for Getting Started.|url=http://www.scopists.com/ScopistryWeb/chapter4.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Compensation ==

Scopists are typically paid by the page, starting from $1.00 to $1.50 per page.  This amount increases for expedited transcripts (transcripts that need to be edited faster than usual) and for transcripts with a high density of medical or technical terminology (transcripts that require extra research).&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Tiffani|title=Become a Scopist.|website=Careers for People|url=http://www.careersforpeople.com/become-a-scopist|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714184702/http://www.careersforpeople.com/become-a-scopist|archive-date=July 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Risks ==

While scopists provide a court reporter with a valuable service, they can also pose a risk since a scopist is not required to hold any certifications.  A scopist may attempt to "clean-up" a transcript by fixing grammar and changing punctuation, which can cause the scopist to inadvertently change the record.  Therefore, the final transcript is the responsibility of the stenographer who created the rough or "[[RASCII]]", and it is his or her responsibility to proofread the final copy before certifying it.  A good court reporter will always have the final read of a transcript that a scopist finalizes.&lt;ref &gt;{{Cite web

== Work environment ==

The term "scopist" originated in the early days of computer-aided transcription.  At that time, the shorthand transcripts produced by court reporters were translated into plain English on minicomputers belonging to courthouses or reporting firms.  These computers had small green screens that displayed only six or eight lines of text at a time and resembled an oscilloscope.  The screen became known as a "scope"; as a result, the people who worked at the "scope" to monitor the translation of the transcript became known as "scopists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sober|first1=William|first2=Linda A.|last2=Knipes-Sober|title=Chapter 1:  History of Scoping.|work=Scopistry: An In-depth Look at the Scopist Profession and Handbook for Getting Started.|url=http://www.scopists.com/ScopistryWeb/chapter1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most scopists are freelancers, working from home, receiving court reporters’ transcripts and other materials electronically, via email and internet sites.  This enables scopists to build their own clientele, set their own hours, and work for court reporters without the constraint of geographical location.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Silver|first=Sheryl|title=Scopists Able to Work from Home.|work=Career Information, Resources &amp; Guides in Central Pennsylvania:  PennLive.com.|url=http://www.pennlive.com/careerwise/index.ssf?/careerwise/html/articles/scopists.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041225140935/http://www.pennlive.com/careerwise/index.ssf?%2Fcareerwise%2Fhtml%2Farticles%2Fscopists.html|archive-date=December 25, 2004|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
===Early life===
Subh was originally a Christian from [[Navarra]] by the name ''Aurora'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harrison|first1=Richard|title=Spain|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Spain/Muslim-Spain#ref587370|website=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;
who was brought as a slave - a ''Jāriya'' - to be a [[Concubinage|concubine]] in the harem of the Caliph in Cordoba. Her origin has alternatively been identified as [[Basque people|Basque]] from the [[Gascony]] region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ivories of Al-Andalus|url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200105/the.ivories.of.al-andalus.htm|publisher=Saudi Aramco World|accessdate=October 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concubine===
In the Caliph's harem of Cordoba, Subh became the favorite concubine and wife of the Caliph [[Al-Hakam II|al-Hakam]]. She was described as not only beautiful, but also as intelligent and analytical.&lt;ref name="Mernissi, Fatima 2003"&gt;Mernissi, Fatima; Mary Jo Lakeland (2003). The forgotten queens of Islam. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-579868-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the later years of his reign, the Caliph lost interest of the routine management of political affairs, and reportedly left it to his favorite wife.&lt;ref name="Mernissi, Fatima 2003"/&gt; To fill this task, she expressed the need for a secretary, and in 966, [[Al-Mansur Ibn Abi Aamir]] (also known as Almanzor) was appointed to this post. There were rumors that Almanzor became her lover and that this was the reason why she was to give him such influence in the affairs of state, and their alleged relationship became the subject of satirical poems and libelous rhymes.&lt;ref name="Mernissi, Fatima 2003"/&gt; The Caliph reportedly alluded to the matter once when he remarked that Almanzor apparently was remarkable influence in the minds of the harem, but apparently the Caliph never saw a reason to take any action.&lt;ref name="Mernissi, Fatima 2003"/&gt; Whether they actually were lovers or not have never been confirmed, but it is a fact that Almazor became a trusted collaborator to whom she trusted completely in her political work.&lt;ref name="Mernissi, Fatima 2003"/&gt;

===Mother of the Caliph===
In 976, Caliph al-Hakam died and was succeeded by Subh's minor son, the eleven-year old Caliph [[Hisham II al-Hakam]], under the regency of General [[Ghalib al-Nasiri]], al-Mushafi (the chief administrator of the late caliph), and Subh as well as [[Al-Mansur Ibn Abi Aamir]], who became the administrator of the properties left to Subh by al-Hakam.&lt;ref name="Fletcher"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fletcher|first=Richard|title=Moorish Spain|year=2006|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-24840-3|pages=73|url={{Google books|wrMG-LfuU7oC|page=73|plainurl=yes}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, Subh provided Almanzor with the necessary funds to give him control of the army, by which he could secure the stability necessary for her son, a child, to be secured as Caliph with her as regent, after which she gave him much power in her government.&lt;ref name="Mernissi, Fatima 2003"/&gt; Subh also named Almanzor ''[[hajib]]'' [chief of viziers].&lt;ref name="Mernissi, Fatima 2003"/&gt; Almanzor had become the de facto ruler of Córdoba by 978, pushing both Subh and Hisham to the sidelines.&lt;ref name="Fletcher" /&gt;

The 13th-century historian Al-Murakushi describe the situation: "The stature of Ibn 'Amir continued to grow until he made the acquaintance of Sayyida Subh, the mother of Hisham, the son of alHakam. He took charge of her business affairs and managed her lands. In this way he earned her appreciation. Things continued like this until the death of al-Hakam. Hisham was still young, and there was fear of trouble. Ibn 'Amir provided Subh with the security and
calm necessary for her son to be able to reign. Ibn 'Amir was very competent and circumstances worked in his favour. Subh made available the necessary funds, and he was able to win over the army. There then followed a train of circumstances that allowed him to rise even higher, until he became practically the sole manager of the affairs of state."&lt;ref name="Mernissi, Fatima 2003"/&gt;

The collaboration between Subh and Almanzor reportedly worked well until 986, when a conflict arouse between them, causing Subh to an unsuccessful attempt to depose Almanzor from his position by introducing other male favorites as his rivals.&lt;ref name="Mernissi, Fatima 2003"/&gt;  Her second and last attempt to depose him in 997 resulted in his complete accession of all power.&lt;ref name="Mernissi, Fatima 2003"/&gt;

==In popular culture==
Subh appeared as a character in the 2003 Syrian television series ''Cordoba's Spring'', played by [[Nesreen Tafesh]]. The series was written by [[Walid Saif]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rabee' Qortoba| url=http://www.elcinema.com/en/work/1781421/| website=elcinema.com| publisher=Damlag|accessdate=December 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{PoliticsUS}}
The [[United States|United States of America]] has separate [[Federal government of the United States|federal]], [[U.S. state|state]], and [[Local government in the United States|local government]]s with [[tax]]es imposed at each of these levels. Taxes are levied on income, payroll, property, sales, [[Capital gains tax in the United States|capital gains]], dividends, imports, estates and gifts, as well as various fees. In 2010, taxes collected by federal, state, and municipal governments amounted to 24.8% of [[GDP]]. In the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], only [[Chile]] and [[Mexico]] are taxed less as a share of their GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |coauthors= |title=America's Aversion to Taxes |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/15/business/economy/slipping-behind-because-of-an-aversion-to-taxes.html?_r=1&amp;src=recg |quote=In 1965, taxes collected by federal, state and municipal governments amounted to 24.7 percent of the nation's output. In 2010, they amounted to 24.8 percent. Excluding Chile and Mexico, the United States raises less tax revenue, as a share of the economy, than every other industrial country. |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=August 14, 2012 |accessdate=2012-08-15 |first=Eduardo |last=Porter}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, taxes fall much more heavily on labor income than on capital income. Divergent taxes and subsidies for different forms of income and spending can also constitute a form of indirect taxation of some activities over others. For example, individual spending on higher education can be said to be "taxed" at a high rate, compared to other forms of personal expenditure which are formally recognized as investments.&lt;ref name="Knowledge Tax"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simkovic|first1=Michael|title=The Knowledge Tax|journal=University of Chicago Law Review|volume=82|page=1981|ssrn=2551567}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simkovic|first=Michael|date=2016|title=Taxes, Subsidies, and Knowledge: A Reply to Professor Oei|ssrn=2761682|journal=University of Chicago Law Review Dialogue}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taxes are imposed on [[Income tax|net income]] of individuals and corporations by the federal, most state, and some local governments. Citizens and residents are taxed on worldwide income and allowed a credit for foreign taxes. Income subject to tax is determined under tax accounting rules, not financial accounting principles, and includes almost all income from whatever source. Most business expenses reduce taxable income, though limits apply to a few expenses. Individuals are permitted to reduce taxable income by personal allowances and certain non-business expenses, including home mortgage interest, state and local taxes, charitable contributions, and medical and certain other expenses incurred above certain percentages of income. State rules for determining taxable income often differ from federal rules. Federal marginal [[tax rate]]s vary from 10% to 39.6% of taxable income. State and local tax rates vary widely by jurisdiction, from 0% to 13.30% of income,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vig.cdn.sos.ca.gov/2012/general/pdf/30-title-summ-analysis.pdf |title=TEMPORARY TAXES TO FUND EDUCATION. GUARANTEED LOCAL PUBLIC SAFETY FUNDING. INITIATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT |publisher=Vig.cdn.sos.ca.gov/ |date=2013-04-05 |accessdate=2013-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many are graduated. State taxes are generally treated as a deductible expense for federal tax computation. In 2013, the top marginal income tax rate for a high-income California resident, combined with the Federal rate, would be 51.9%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=NAGOURNEY |first=ADAM |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/07/us/millionaires-consider-leaving-california-over-taxes.html?_r=0 |title=Two-Tax Rise Tests Wealthy in California |publisher=NYtimes.com |date=2013-04-05 |accessdate=2013-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States is one of two countries in the world that [[International taxation#Citizenship|taxes its non-resident citizens]] on worldwide income, in the same manner and rates as residents; the other is [[Eritrea]]. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of imposition of such a tax in the case of ''Cook v. Tait''.&lt;ref&gt;265 U.S. 47 (1924).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Payroll tax]]es are imposed by the federal and all state governments. These include Social Security and Medicare taxes imposed on both employers and employees, at a combined rate of 15.3% (13.3% for 2011 and 2012). Social Security tax applies only to the first $106,800 of wages in 2009 through 2011.&lt;ref name="Knowledge Tax" /&gt; However, benefits are only accrued on the first $106,800 of wages. Employers must withhold income taxes on wages. An unemployment tax and certain other levies apply to employers. Payroll taxes have dramatically increased as a share of federal revenue since the 1950s, while corporate income taxes have fallen as a share of revenue. (Corporate profits have not fallen as a share of GDP).&lt;ref name="Knowledge Tax" /&gt;

[[Property tax]]es are imposed by most local governments and many special purpose authorities based on the fair market value of property. School and other authorities are often separately governed, and impose separate taxes. Property tax is generally imposed only on realty, though some jurisdictions tax some forms of business property. Property tax rules and rates vary widely with annual median rates ranging from 0.2% to 1.9% of a property's value depending on the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tax-rates.org/taxtables/property-tax-by-state|title=Property Taxes By State|author=|publisher=Tax-Rates.org|date=2009|accessdate=2015-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sales tax]]es are imposed by most states and some localities on the price at retail sale of many goods and some services. Sales tax rates vary widely among jurisdictions, from 0% to 16%, and may vary within a jurisdiction based on the particular goods or services taxed. Sales tax is collected by the seller at the time of sale, or remitted as use tax by buyers of taxable items who did not pay sales tax.

The United States imposes tariffs or [[customs]] duties on the import of many types of goods from many jurisdictions. These tariffs or duties must be paid before the goods can be legally imported. Rates of duty vary from 0% to more than 20%, based on the particular goods and country of origin.

[[Inheritance tax|Estate]] and [[gift tax]]es are imposed by the federal and some state governments on the transfer of property inheritance, by will, or by lifetime donation. Similar to federal income taxes, federal estate and gift taxes are imposed on worldwide property of citizens and residents and allow a credit for foreign taxes.

==Levels and types of taxation==
[[File:U.S. Federal Receipts - FY 2007.png|thumb|U.S. federal tax receipts for 2014]]

The U.S. has an assortment of federal, state, local, and special-purpose governmental jurisdictions. Each imposes taxes to fully or partly fund its operations. These taxes may be imposed on the same income, property or activity, often without offset of one tax against another. The types of tax imposed at each level of government vary, in part due to constitutional restrictions. Income taxes are imposed at the federal and most state levels. Taxes on property are typically imposed only at the local level, although there may be multiple local jurisdictions that tax the same property. Other excise taxes are imposed by the federal and some state governments. Sales taxes are imposed by most states and many local governments. Customs duties or tariffs are only imposed by the federal government. A wide variety of user fees or license fees are also imposed.

A federal [[wealth tax]] would be required by the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] to be distributed to the States according to their populations, as this type of tax is considered a [[direct tax]]. State and local government property taxes are wealth taxes on [[real estate]].

==Types of taxpayers==
Taxes may be imposed on individuals (natural persons), business entities, estates, trusts, or other forms of organization. Taxes may be based on property, income, transactions, transfers, importations of goods, business activities, or a variety of factors, and are generally imposed on the type of taxpayer for whom such [[tax base]] is relevant. Thus, property taxes tend to be imposed on property owners. In addition, certain taxes, particularly income taxes, may be imposed on the members of organizations for the organization's activities. Therefore, partners are taxed on the income of their partnership.

With fewer exceptions, one level of government does not impose tax on another level of government or its instrumentalities.

==Income tax==

Taxes based on income are imposed at the federal, most state, and some local levels within the United States. The tax systems within each jurisdiction may define taxable income separately. Many states refer to some extent to federal concepts for determining taxable income.

===History of the income tax===
The [[History of taxation in the United States#Pre-16th Amendment|first Income tax in the United States]] was implemented with the [[Revenue Act of 1861]] by [[Abraham Lincoln]] during the [[Civil War (US)|Civil War]]. In 1895 the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] ruled that the U.S. federal income tax on interest income, dividend income and rental income was [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]] in [[Pollock v. Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Co.]], because it was a [[direct tax]]. The ''Pollock'' decision was overruled by the ratification of the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] in 1913,&lt;ref&gt;See generally Boris I. Bittker, "Constitutional Limits on the Taxing Power of the Federal Government," ''Tax Lawyer'', Vol. 41, No. 1, p. 3, American Bar Ass'n (Fall 1987); William D. Andrews, ''Basic Federal Income Taxation'', p. 2, Little, Brown and Company (3d ed. 1985); Calvin H. Johnson, "The Constitutional Meaning of 'Apportionment of Direct Taxes'", 80 Tax Notes 591 (Aug. 3, 1998); and Sheldon D. Pollack, "Origins of the Modern Income Tax, 1894–1913," 66 ''Tax Lawyer'' 295, 323–24, Winter 2013 (Amer. Bar Ass'n).&lt;/ref&gt; and by subsequent U.S. Supreme Court decisions including ''Graves v. New York ex rel. O'Keefe,''&lt;ref&gt;306 U.S. 466 (1939).&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[South Carolina v. Baker]],''&lt;ref&gt;485 U.S. 505 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Brushaber v. Union Pacific Railroad Co.|Brushaber v. Union Pacific Railroad Co]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/240/1/case.html|title=Brushaber v. Union Pacific R. Co., 240 U.S. 1 (1916)|work=Justia Law|access-date=2018-01-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basic concepts===
The U.S. income tax system imposes a tax based on income on individuals, corporations, estates, and trusts.&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|26|1}} and {{USC|26|11}}; IRS [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p17.pdf Publication 17] and [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p542/index.html Publication 542].&lt;/ref&gt; The tax is taxable income, as defined, times a specified tax rate. This tax may be reduced by credits, some of which may be refunded if they exceed the tax calculated. Taxable income may differ from income for other purposes (such as for financial reporting). The definition of taxable income for federal purposes is used by many, but far from all states. Income and deductions are recognized under tax rules, and there are variations within the rules among the states. Book and tax income may differ. Income is divided into "capital gains", which are taxed at a lower rate and only when the taxpayer chooses to "realize" them, and "ordinary income", which is taxed at higher rates and on an annual basis. Because of this distinction, capital is taxed much more lightly than labor.&lt;ref name="Knowledge Tax" /&gt;

Under the U.S. system, individuals, corporations, estates, and trusts are subject to income tax. Partnerships are not taxed; rather, their partners are subject to income tax on their shares of income and deductions, and take their shares of credits. Some types of business entities may elect to be treated as corporations or as partnerships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jct.gov/publications.html?func=startdown&amp;id=4363 JCX-49-11, Joint Committee on Taxation], September 22, 2011, pp. 4, 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Federal Receipts by Source.svg|thumb|Federal receipts by source as share of total receipts (1950–2010). {{legend|#ff0000|Individual income taxes }} {{legend|#0000ff|Payroll taxes/FICA}} {{legend|#008000|Corporate income taxes}} {{legend|#00ffff|Excise taxes}} {{legend|#157545|Estate and gift taxes}} {{legend|#000094|Other receipts}}|left]]
Taxpayers are required to file tax returns and self assess tax. Tax may be withheld from payments of income (''e.g.'', withholding of tax from wages). To the extent taxes are not covered by withholdings, taxpayers must make estimated tax payments, generally quarterly. Tax returns are subject to review and adjustment by taxing authorities, though far fewer than all returns are reviewed.

Taxable income is [[gross income]] less exemptions, deductions, and personal exemptions. Gross income includes "all income from whatever source". Certain income, however, is subject to [[tax exemption]] at the federal or state levels. This income is reduced by [[tax deduction]]s including most business and some nonbusiness expenses. Individuals are also allowed a deduction for [[Personal exemption (United States)|personal exemptions]], a fixed dollar allowance. The allowance of some nonbusiness deductions is phased out at higher income levels.

The U.S. federal and most state income tax systems tax the worldwide income of citizens and residents.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', IRS Publication 17, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; A federal [[foreign tax credit]] is granted for foreign income taxes. Individuals residing abroad may also claim the [[foreign earned income exclusion]]. Individuals may be a citizen or resident of the United States but not a resident of a state. Many states grant a similar credit for taxes paid to other states. These credits are generally limited to the amount of tax on income from foreign (or other state) sources.

===Filing status===
{{Main|Filing Status (federal income tax)}}
[[File:Historical Marginal Tax Rate for Highest and Lowest Income Earners.jpg|thumb|right|Historical federal [[marginal tax rate]]s for income for the lowest and highest income earners in the U.S.&lt;ref name=TaxFoundation&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S. Federal Individual Income Tax Rates History, 1913–2011|url=http://taxfoundation.org/article/us-federal-individual-income-tax-rates-history-1913-2011-nominal-and-inflation-adjusted-brackets|newspaper=Tax Foundation|date=9 September 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116210911/http://taxfoundation.org/article/us-federal-individual-income-tax-rates-history-1913-2011-nominal-and-inflation-adjusted-brackets|archivedate=16 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Federal and state income tax is calculated, and returns filed, for each taxpayer. Two married individuals may calculate tax and file returns jointly or separately. In addition, unmarried individuals supporting children or certain other relatives may file a return as a head of household. Parent-subsidiary groups of companies may elect to file a [[Combined reporting|consolidated return]].

===Graduated tax rates===
[[File:Progressive effective tax burden.pdf|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Progressive effective tax burden]]

Income tax rates differ at the federal and state levels for corporations and individuals. Federal and many state income tax rates are higher (graduated) at higher levels of income. The income level at which various tax rates apply for individuals varies by filing status. The income level at which each rate starts generally is higher (''i.e.'', tax is lower) for married couples filing a joint return or single individuals filing as head of household.

Individuals are subject to federal graduated tax rates from 10% to 39.6%.&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|26|1}}; IRS [Publication 17], page 266.&lt;/ref&gt; Corporations are subject to federal graduated rates of tax from 15% to 35%; a rate of 34% applies to income from $335,000 to $15,000,000.&lt;ref name="26 USC 11; IRS Publication 542"&gt;{{USC|26|11}}; IRS Publication 542.&lt;/ref&gt; State income tax rates vary from 1% to 16%, including local income tax where applicable. State and local taxes are generally deductible in computing federal taxable income. Federal and many state individual income tax rate schedules differ based on the individual's filing status.

Taxable income is [[gross income]]&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|26|61}}; IRS Publication 17, Part II.&lt;/ref&gt; less adjustments and allowable [[tax deduction]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|26|161|249}}; IRS Publication 17, [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p501/index.html Publication 501] and [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p535/index.html Publication 535].&lt;/ref&gt; Gross income for federal and most states is receipts and gains from all sources less [[cost of goods sold]]. Gross income includes "all income from whatever source", and is not limited to cash received.  Income from illegal activities is taxable and must be reported to the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=James v. United States|link=James v. United States (1961)|volume=366|page=213|pin=|year=1961}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount of income recognized is generally the value received or which the taxpayer has a right to receive. Certain types of income are specifically excluded from gross income. The time at which gross income becomes taxable is determined under federal tax rules. This may differ in some cases from accounting rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|26|446|475}}; IRS [ Publication ].&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain types of income are excluded from gross income (and therefore subject to [[tax exemption]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|26|101|140}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The exclusions differ at federal and state levels. For federal income tax, interest income on state and local bonds is exempt, while few states exempt any interest income except from municipalities within that state. In addition, certain types of receipts, such as gifts and inheritances, and certain types of benefits, such as employer-provided health insurance, are excluded from income.

Foreign non-resident persons are taxed only on income from U.S. sources or from a U.S. business. Tax on foreign non-resident persons on non-business income is at 30% of the gross income, but reduced under many [[tax treaty|tax treaties]].

[[File:Irs_taxable_income.jpg|frameless|upright=3.45]]&lt;br&gt;

[[File:income tax '17-'18.jpg|frameless|upright=3.45]]

These brackets are the taxable income plus the standard deduction for a joint return. That deduction is the first bracket. For example, a couple earning $88,600 by September owes $10,453; $1,865 for 10% of the income from $12,700 to $31,500, plus $8,588 for 15% of the income from $31,500 to $88,600. Now, for every $100 they earn, $25 is taxed until they reach the next bracket.

After making $400 more; going down to the 89,000 row the tax is $100 more. The next column is the tax divided by 89,000. The new law is the next column. This tax equals 10% of their income from $24,000 to $43,050 plus 12% from $43,050 to $89,000. The singles' sets of markers can be set up quickly. The brackets with its tax are cut in half.

Itemizers can figure the tax without moving the scale by taking the difference off the top. The couple above, having receipts for $22,700 in deductions, means that the last $10,000 of their income is tax free. After seven years the papers can be destroyed; if unchallenged.

{{Main|Tax deduction}}

The U.S. system allows reduction of taxable income for both business&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|26|161|199}}; IRS Publication 535.&lt;/ref&gt; and some nonbusiness&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|26|211|224}}; IRS Publication 17, Chapters 21–28.&lt;/ref&gt; expenditures, called deductions. Businesses selling goods reduce gross income directly by the cost of goods sold. In addition, businesses may deduct most types of expenses incurred in the business. Some of these deductions are subject to limitations. For example, only 50% of the amount incurred for any meals or entertainment may be deducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|26|274}}; IRS [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p463/index.html Publication 463].&lt;/ref&gt; The amount and timing of deductions for business expenses is determined under the taxpayer's [[tax accounting]] method, which may differ from methods used in accounting records.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=c3b3dc02944497a4e3612aa948844ae3&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:6.0.1.1.1.0.4.13&amp;idno=26 IRS Regulations at 26 CFR 1. 446-1]; IRS [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p538/index.html Publication 538].&lt;/ref&gt;

Some types of business expenses are deductible over a period of years rather than when incurred. These include the cost of long lived assets such as buildings and equipment. The cost of such assets is recovered through deductions for [[depreciation]] or [[amortization]].

In addition to business expenses, individuals may reduce income by an allowance for [[Personal exemption (United States)|personal exemptions]]&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|26|151}}; IRS [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p501/index.html Publication 501].&lt;/ref&gt; and either a fixed [[standard deduction]] or [[itemized deduction]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|26|63}}; IRS Publication 501.&lt;/ref&gt; One personal exemption is allowed per taxpayer, and additional such deductions are allowed for each child or certain other individuals supported by the taxpayer. The standard deduction amount varies by taxpayer filing status. Itemized deductions by individuals include home mortgage interest, property taxes, certain other taxes, contributions to recognized charities, medical expenses in excess of 7.5% of [[adjusted gross income]], and certain other amounts.

Personal exemptions, the standard deduction, and itemized deductions are limited (phased out) above certain income levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|26|68}}; IRS Publication 17, Chapter 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Corporate tax in the United States|S corporations|Partnership taxation in the United States}}

Corporations must pay tax on their taxable income independently of their shareholders.&lt;ref name="26 USC 11; IRS Publication 542"/&gt; Shareholders are also subject to tax on dividends received from corporations.&lt;ref&gt;{{USCSub|26|61|a|7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, partnerships are not subject to income tax, but their partners calculate their taxes by including their shares of partnership items.&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|26|701}}; IRS [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p541/index.html Publication 541].&lt;/ref&gt; Corporations owned entirely by U.S. citizens or residents ([[S corporation]]s) may elect to be treated similarly to partnerships. A [[limited liability company]] and certain other business entities may elect to be treated as corporations or as partnerships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=c3b3dc02944497a4e3612aa948844ae3&amp;rgn=div5&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:18.0.1.1.2&amp;idno=26#26:18.0.1.1.2.20.69.2 26 CFR 301.7701-2]; IRS [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8832.pdf Form 8832].&lt;/ref&gt; States generally follow such characterization. Many states also allow corporations to elect S corporation status. Charitable organizations are subject to tax on business income.&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|26|512}}; IRS [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p598/ch02.html Publication 598].&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain transactions of business entities are not subject to tax. These include many types of formation or reorganization.&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|26|332|368}}; IRS Publication 542.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Credits===
{{Main|Tax credit}}

A wide variety of tax credits may reduce income tax at the federal&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|26|21|54AA}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and state levels. Some credits are available only to individuals, such as the [[Child tax credit#United States|child tax credit]] for each dependent child, [[American Opportunity Tax Credit]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The American Opportunity Tax Credit|url=http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/Documents/American-Opportunity-Tax-Credit-10-12-2010.pdf|publisher=U.S. Department of the Treasury|accessdate=2012-06-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925100646/http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/Documents/American-Opportunity-Tax-Credit-10-12-2010.pdf|archivedate=2012-09-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for education expenses, or the [[Earned Income Tax Credit]] for low income wage earners. Some credits, such as the Work Opportunity Tax Credit, are available to businesses, including various special industry incentives. A few credits, such as the [[foreign tax credit]], are available to all types of taxpayers.

===Payment or withholding of taxes===
{{Main|Withholding tax}}

The United States federal and state income tax systems are self-assessment systems. Taxpayers must declare and pay tax without assessment by the taxing authority. Quarterly payments of tax estimated to be due are required to the extent taxes are not paid through withholdings.&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|26|6654|6655}}; IRS [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p505/index.html Publication 505].&lt;/ref&gt; Employers must withhold income tax, as well as Social Security and Medicare taxes, from wages.&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|26|3102}}; {{USC|26|3402}}; IRS [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p15/index.html Publication 15].&lt;/ref&gt; Amounts to be withheld are computed by employers based on [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p15/ar02.html#en_US_2011_publink1000202367 representations] of tax status by employees on [[Form W-4]], with limited government review.&lt;ref&gt;Contrast to, ''e.g.'', the United Kingdom system in which all withholding amounts are determined by Inland Revenue.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Total State Government Tax Revenue By Type.png|thumb|right|Total State Government Tax Revenue By Type in 2015]]

Forty-three [[U.S. state|states]] and many localities in the U.S. impose an [[income tax]] on individuals. Forty-seventh states and many localities impose a tax on the income of corporations. Tax rates vary by state and locality, and may be fixed or graduated. Most rates are the same for all types of income. State and local income taxes are imposed in addition to federal income tax. State income tax is allowed as a deduction in computing federal income tax, subject to limitations for individuals.

State and local taxable income is determined under state law, and often is based on federal taxable income. Most states conform to many federal concepts and definitions, including defining income and business deductions and timing thereof.&lt;ref&gt;Hellerstein, Jerome H., and Hellerstein, Walter, ''State and Local Taxation, Cases and Materials'', Eighth Edition, 2001 (hereafter "Hellerstein"), p. 929.&lt;/ref&gt; State rules vary widely regarding to individual itemized deductions. Most states do not allow a deduction for state income taxes for individuals or corporations, and impose tax on certain types of income exempt at the federal level.

Some states have alternative measures of taxable income, or alternative taxes, especially for corporations.

States imposing an income tax generally tax all income of corporations organized in the state and individuals residing in the state. Taxpayers from another state are subject to tax only on income earned in the state or apportioned to the state. Businesses are subject to income tax in a state only if they have sufficient nexus in (connection to) the state.

===Non-residents===
Foreign individuals and corporations not resident in the United States are subject to federal income tax only on income from a U.S. business and certain types of income from [[International taxation#Source of income|U.S. sources]].&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|26|871|898}}; IRS [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p515/index.html Publication 515].&lt;/ref&gt; States tax individuals resident outside the state and corporations organized outside the state only on wages or business income within the state. Payers of some types of income to non-residents must [[Tax withholding in the United States#Withholding on payments to foreign persons|withhold]] federal or state income tax on the payment. Federal withholding of 30% on such income may be reduced under a [[tax treaty]]. Such treaties do not apply to state taxes.

===Alternative tax bases (AMT, states)===
An [[alternative minimum tax]] (AMT) is imposed at the federal level on a somewhat modified version of taxable income.&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|26|55|59}}; IRS [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i6251.pdf Form 6251 instructions].&lt;/ref&gt; The tax applies to individuals and corporations. The tax base is [[adjusted gross income]] reduced by a fixed deduction that varies by taxpayer filing status. Itemized deductions of individuals are limited to home mortgage interest, charitable contributions, and a portion of medical expenses. AMT is imposed at a rate of 26% or 28% for individuals and 20% for corporations, less the amount of regular tax. A credit against future regular income tax is allowed for such excess, with certain restrictions.

Many states impose minimum income taxes on corporations or a tax computed on an alternative tax base. These include taxes based on capital of corporations and alternative measures of income for individuals. Details vary widely by state.

===Differences between book and taxable income for businesses===
In the United States, taxable income is computed under rules that differ materially from [[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (United States)|U.S. generally accepted accounting principles]]. Since only publicly traded companies are required to prepare financial statements, many non-public companies opt to keep their financial records under tax rules. Corporations that present financial statements using other than tax rules must include a [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1120sm3.pdf detailed reconciliation] of their financial statement income to their taxable income as part of their tax returns. Key areas of difference include depreciation and amortization, timing of recognition of income or deductions, assumptions for [[cost of goods sold]], and certain items (such as meals and entertainment) the tax deduction for which is limited.

===Reporting under self-assessment system===
{{Main|Tax return (United States)}}

Income taxes in the United States are self-assessed by taxpayers&lt;ref&gt;{{USCSub|26|6201|a|1}}; IRS [ Publication ].&lt;/ref&gt; by filing required tax returns.&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|26|6011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Taxpayers, as well as certain non-tax-paying entities, like partnerships, must file annual [[Tax return (United States)|tax returns]] at the federal and applicable state levels. These returns disclose a complete computation of taxable income under tax principles. Taxpayers compute all income, deductions, and credits themselves, and determine the amount of tax due after applying required prepayments and taxes withheld. Federal and state tax authorities provide preprinted forms that must be used to file tax returns. IRS [[IRS tax forms#1040 series|Form 1040 series]] is required for individuals, Form [[IRS tax forms#1120|1120 series]] for corporations, Form [[IRS tax forms#1065|1065]] for partnerships, and Form [[IRS tax forms#990|990 series]] for tax exempt organizations.

The state forms vary widely, and rarely correspond to federal forms. Tax returns vary from the two-page ([https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040ez.pdf Form 1040EZ]) used by nearly 70% of individual filers to thousands of pages of forms and attachments for large entities. Groups of corporations may elect to file [[Combined reporting#United States consolidated returns|consolidated returns]] at the federal level and with a few states. Electronic filing of [https://www.irs.gov/efile/index.html federal] and many state returns is widely encouraged and in some cases required, and many vendors offer computer software for use by taxpayers and paid return preparers to prepare and electronically file returns.

==Capital gains tax==
[[File:Federal Capital Gains Tax Collections 1954-2009 history chart.pdf|upright=2.25|right|thumb|U.S. [[Capital gains tax|capital gains]] taxes history]]
{{Main|Capital gains tax in the United States}}

Individuals and corporations pay [[Income tax in the United States|U.S. federal income tax]] on the net total of all their [[capital gain]]s. The tax rate depends on both the investor's [[tax bracket#Tax brackets in the United States|tax bracket]] and the amount of time the investment was held. '''Short-term capital gains''' are taxed at the investor's [[ordinary income]] tax rate and are defined as investments held for a year or less before being sold. '''Long-term capital gains''', on dispositions of assets held for more than one year, are taxed at a lower rate.&lt;ref&gt;See subsection (h) of {{usc|26|1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Payroll taxes==
[[File:Effective Payroll Tax rate for Different Income Percentiles (2010).gif|thumb|upright=1.6|right|[[Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax|Payroll taxes]] were among the most regressive in 2010.]]

In the United States, payroll taxes are assessed by the federal government, many states, the District of Columbia, and numerous cities. These taxes are imposed on employers and employees and on various compensation bases. They are collected and paid to the taxing jurisdiction by the employers. Most jurisdictions imposing payroll taxes require reporting quarterly and annually in most cases, and electronic reporting is generally required for all but small employers.&lt;ref&gt;A tutorial is available online from the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) explaining various aspects of employer compliance, see [http://www.tax.gov/virtualworkshop/ Video Tutorial].&lt;/ref&gt; Because payroll taxes are imposed only on wages and not on income from investments, taxes on labor income are much heavier than taxes on income from capital.&lt;ref name="Knowledge Tax" /&gt;

===Income tax withholding===
{{Main|Tax withholding in the United States}}

Federal, state, and local [[withholding tax]]es are required in those jurisdictions imposing an income tax. Employers having contact with the jurisdiction must withhold the tax from wages paid to their employees in those jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;The determination of whether a person performing services is an employee subject to payroll tax or an independent contractor who self assesses tax is based on [http://www.mdc.edu/hr/Operations/AFS/IRSFactorTest.pdf 20 factors] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501081919/http://www.mdc.edu/hr/Operations/AFS/IRSFactorTest.pdf |date=2011-05-01 }}. See [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p15.pdf IRS Publication 15 and the tutorial referenced above]. For federal requirements, see {{USC|26|3401|3405}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Computation of the amount of tax to withhold is performed by the employer based on representations by the employee regarding his/her tax status on IRS [[Form W-4]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw4.pdf |title=IRS Form W-4 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amounts of income tax so withheld must be paid to the taxing jurisdiction, and are available as refundable [[tax credit]]s to the employees. Income taxes withheld from payroll are not final taxes, merely prepayments. Employees must still file income tax returns and self assess tax, claiming amounts withheld as payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|26|31}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social Security and Medicare taxes===
{{Main|Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax}}

Federal social insurance taxes are imposed equally on employers&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|26|3111}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and employees,&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|26|3101}}.&lt;/ref&gt; consisting of a tax of 6.2% of wages up to an annual wage maximum ($118,500 in 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/COLA/cbb.html|title = ssa.gov|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;) for Social Security plus a tax of 1.45% of total wages for Medicare.&lt;ref&gt;Note that an equivalent Self Employment Tax is imposed on self-employed persons, including independent contractors, under {{USC|26|1401}}.  Wages and self employment income subject to these taxes are defined at {{USC|26|3121}} and {{USC|26|1402}} respectively.&lt;/ref&gt; For 2011, the employee's contribution was reduced to 4.2%, while the employer's portion remained at 6.2%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p15.pdf |title=IRS.gov |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the extent an employee's portion of the 6.2% tax exceeds the maximum by reason of multiple employers (each of whom will collect up to the annual wage maximum), the employee is entitled to a refundable [[tax credit]] upon filing an income tax return for the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{USCSub|26|31|b}}; {{USCSub|26|6413|c}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Payroll tax history.jpg|frameless|center|upright=3.65|Payroll tax rates history]]

===Unemployment taxes===
{{Main|Federal Unemployment Tax Act}}

Employers are subject to unemployment taxes by the federal&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|26|3301}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and all state governments. The tax is a percentage of taxable wages&lt;ref&gt;As defined in {{USCSub|26|3306|b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; with a cap. The tax rate and cap vary by jurisdiction and by employer's industry and experience rating. For 2009, the typical maximum tax per employee was under $1,000.&lt;ref&gt;State tax rates and caps vary.  For example, Texas imposes up to 8.6% tax on the first $9,000 of wages ($774), while New Jersey imposes 3.2% tax on the first $28,900 for wages ($924). Federal tax of 6.2% less a credit for state taxes limited to 5.4% applies to the first $7,000 of wages (net $56).&lt;/ref&gt; Some states also impose unemployment, disability insurance, or similar taxes on employees.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [http://lwd.dol.state.nj.us/labor/employer/ea/ea_index.html New Jersey] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503192451/http://lwd.dol.state.nj.us/labor/employer/ea/ea_index.html |date=2011-05-03 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reporting and payment===
Employers must report payroll taxes to the appropriate taxing jurisdiction in the manner each jurisdiction provides. Quarterly reporting of aggregate income tax withholding and Social Security taxes is required in most jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., IRS [https://www.irs.gov/uac/about-form-941 Form 941]. Electronic filing may be required.&lt;/ref&gt; Employers must file reports of aggregate unemployment tax quarterly and annually with each applicable state, and annually at the federal level.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g''., [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f940.pdf IRS Form 940].&lt;/ref&gt;

Each employer is required to provide each employee an annual report on IRS Form W-2&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw2.pdf |title=IRS Form W-2 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; of wages paid and federal, state and local taxes withheld, with a copy sent to the IRS and the taxation authority of the state. These are due by January 31 and February 28 (March 31 if filed electronically), respectively, following the calendar year in which wages are paid. The Form W-2 constitutes proof of payment of tax for the employee.&lt;ref&gt;See IRS [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/iw2w3.pdf Form W-2 Instructions]. Note that some states and cities obtain their W-2 information from the IRS and from taxpayers directly.&lt;/ref&gt;

Employers are required to pay payroll taxes to the taxing jurisdiction under varying rules, in many cases within 1 banking day. Payment of federal and many state payroll taxes is required to be made by [[electronic funds transfer]] if certain dollar thresholds are met, or by deposit with a bank for the benefit of the taxing jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;See {{USC|26|6302}} and IRS [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p15_09.pdf Publication 15] for federal requirements. EFT is required for federal payments if aggregate federal tax payments, including corporate income tax and payroll taxes, exceeded $200,000 in the preceding year. See, e.g., [http://www.state.nj.us/treasury/taxation/njit31.shtml NJ Income Tax – Reporting and Remitting], New Jersey requirements for weekly EFT payment where prior year payroll taxes exceeded $10,000.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Penalties===
Failure to timely and properly pay federal payroll taxes results in an automatic penalty of 2% to 10%.&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|26|6656}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar state and local penalties apply. Failure to properly file monthly or quarterly returns may result in additional penalties. Failure to file Forms W-2 results in an automatic penalty of up to $50 per form not timely filed.&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|26|6721}}.&lt;/ref&gt; State and local penalties vary by jurisdiction.

A particularly severe penalty applies where federal income tax withholding and Social Security taxes are not paid to the IRS. The penalty of up to 100% of the amount not paid can be assessed against the employer entity as well as any person (such as a corporate officer) having control or custody of the funds from which payment should have been made.&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|26|6672}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sales and excise taxes==

===Sales and use tax===
{{Main|Sales taxes in the United States}}
[[File:Average Effective Sales Tax of the 50 States (2007).gif|thumb|The average effective sales tax for different income groups of the combined 50 States (2007).&lt;ref&gt;Carl Davis, Kelly Davis, Matthew Gardner, Robert S.

There is no federal sales or use tax in the United States. All but five states impose sales and use taxes on retail sale, lease and rental of many goods, as well as some services. Many cities, counties, transit authorities and special purpose districts impose an additional local sales or use tax. Sales and use tax is calculated as the purchase price times the appropriate tax rate. Tax rates vary widely by jurisdiction from less than 1% to over 10%. Sales tax is collected by the seller at the time of sale. Use tax is self assessed by a buyer who has not paid sales tax on a taxable purchase.

Unlike [[value added tax]], sales tax is imposed only once, at the retail level, on any particular goods. Nearly all jurisdictions provide numerous categories of goods and services that are exempt from sales tax, or taxed at a reduced rate. Purchase of goods for further manufacture or for resale is uniformly exempt from sales tax. Most jurisdictions exempt food sold in grocery stores, prescription medications, and many agricultural supplies. Generally cash discounts, including coupons, are not included in the price used in computing tax.

Sales taxes, including those imposed by local governments, are generally administered at the state level. States imposing sales tax require retail sellers to register with the state, collect tax from customers, file returns, and remit the tax to the state. Procedural rules vary widely. Sellers generally must collect tax from in-state purchasers unless the purchaser provides an exemption certificate. Most states allow or require electronic remittance of tax to the state. States are prohibited from requiring out of state sellers to collect tax unless the seller has some minimal connection with the state.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Quill Corp. v. North Dakota]]'' and ''[[National Bellas Hess v. Illinois]]'' both prohibit states from imposing a sales and use tax collection obligation on out of state sellers with no nexus in the state.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Excise taxes===
{{Main|Excise tax in the United States}}

'''Excise taxes''' may be imposed on the sales price of goods or on a per unit or other basis, in theory to discourage consumption of the taxed goods or services. Excise tax may be required to be paid by the manufacturer at wholesale sale, or may be collected from the customer at retail sale. Excise taxes are imposed at the federal and state levels on a variety of goods, including alcohol, tobacco, tires, gasoline, diesel fuel, coal, firearms, telephone service, air transportation, unregistered bonds, and many other goods and services. Some jurisdictions require that tax stamps be affixed to goods to demonstrate payment of the tax.{{Citation needed|date = September 2018}}

==Property taxes==
[[File:Average county property taxes in the United States.jpg|frameless|right|upright=2.25|Property taxes in the United States]]
{{Main|Property tax in the United States}}

Most jurisdictions below the state level in the United States impose a tax on interests in real property (land, buildings, and permanent improvements). Some jurisdictions also tax some types of business personal property.&lt;ref&gt;Hellerstein, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Rules vary widely by jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;Compare [http://www.revenue.state.il.us/publications/localgovernment/ptax1004.pdf The Illinois Property Tax System] (hereafter "IL System"), [http://www.lafayetteassessor.com/TopicsPDFs/Louisiana%20Property%20Tax%20Basics%20booklet%203.pdf Louisiana Property Tax Basics] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514212108/http://www.lafayetteassessor.com/TopicsPDFs/Louisiana%20Property%20Tax%20Basics%20booklet%203.pdf |date=2011-05-14 }} (hereafter "La. Basics"), New York pamphlet [http://www.orps.state.ny.us/pamphlet/taxworks.htm How Property Tax Works] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110324113538/http://www.orps.state.ny.us/pamphlet/taxworks.htm |date=2011-03-24 }} (hereafter "NY Taxworks"), and Texas [http://www.window.state.tx.us/taxinfo/proptax/basics/ Property Tax Basics] (hereafter "Texas Basics").&lt;/ref&gt; Many overlapping jurisdictions (counties, cities, school districts) may have authority to tax the same property.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Glen, [http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/fisher.property.tax.history.us History of Property Taxes in the United States] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612060838/http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/fisher.property.tax.history.us |date=2010-06-12 }}, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Few states impose a tax on the value of property.

Property tax is based on [[fair market value]] of the subject property. The amount of tax is determined annually based on the market value of each property on a particular date,&lt;ref&gt;Such date varies by jurisdiction, and may be referred to as the assessment date, valuation date, lien date, or other term.&lt;/ref&gt; and most jurisdictions require redeterminations of value periodically. The tax is computed as the determined market value times an assessment ratio times the tax rate.&lt;ref&gt;See La. Basics, Example 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Assessment ratios and tax rates vary widely among jurisdictions, and may vary by type of property within a jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., IL System, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Where a property has recently been sold between unrelated sellers, such sale establishes fair market value. In other (''i.e.'', most) cases, the value must be estimated. Common estimation techniques include comparable sales, depreciated cost, and an income approach. Property owners may also declare a value, which is subject to change by the tax assessor.

===Types of property taxed===
Property taxes are most commonly applied to real estate and business property. Real property generally includes all interests considered under that state's law to be ownership interests in land, buildings, and improvements. Ownership interests include ownership of title as well as certain other rights to property. Automobile and boat registration fees are a subset of this tax. Usually, other nonbusiness goods are not subject to property tax.

===Assessment and collection===
The assessment process varies by state, and sometimes within a state. Each taxing jurisdiction determines values of property within the jurisdiction and then determines the amount of tax to assess based on the value of the property. Tax assessors for taxing jurisdictions are generally responsible for determining property values. The determination of values and calculation of tax is generally performed by an official referred to as a [[tax assessor]]. Property owners have rights in each jurisdiction to declare or contest the value so determined. Property values generally must be coordinated among jurisdictions, and such coordination is often performed by a board of equalization.

Once value is determined, the assessor typically notifies the last known property owner of the value determination. After values are settled, property tax bills or notices are sent to property owners.&lt;ref&gt;Generally, tax assessors send the bills.  In Louisiana, however, the parish sheriff is responsible for billing and collection of property tax.  See La. Basics, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Payment times and terms vary widely. If a property owner fails to pay the tax, the taxing jurisdiction has various remedies for collection, in many cases including seizure and sale of the property. Property taxes constitute a lien on the property to which transfers are also subject. Mortgage companies often collect taxes from property owners and remit them on behalf of the owner.

==Customs duties==
The United States imposes tariffs or [[customs]] duties on imports of goods. The duty is levied at the time of import and is paid by the importer of record. Customs duties vary by country of origin and product. Goods from many countries are exempt from duty under various trade agreements. Certain types of goods are exempt from duty regardless of source. Customs rules differ from other import restrictions. Failure to properly comply with customs rules can result in seizure of goods and criminal penalties against involved parties. United States Customs and Border Protection ("CBP") enforces customs rules.

===Import of goods===
[[File:Tax Revenue as Share of GDP for OECD Countries in 2009.jpg|thumb|upright|Total [[List of countries by tax revenue as percentage of GDP|tax revenue as share of GDP]] for OECD countries in 2009. The tax burden in the U.S. (black) is relatively small in comparison to other industrialised countries.&lt;ref name=Campell&gt;{{cite news|last=Campbell|first=Andrea|title=America the Undertaxed, U.S. Fiscal Policy in Perspective|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/137838/andrea-louise-campbell/america-the-undertaxed|accessdate=1 October 2012|newspaper=Foreign Affairs|date=September–October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Goods may be imported to the United States subject to import restrictions. Importers of goods may be subject to tax ("customs duty" or "tariff") on the imported value of the goods. "Imported goods are not legally entered until after the shipment has arrived within the port of entry, delivery of the merchandise has been authorized by CBP, and estimated duties have been paid."&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Customs and Border Protection booklet [http://www.cbp.gov/linkhandler/cgov/newsroom/publications/trade/iius.ctt/iius.pdf ''Importing into the United States'' ("CBP Booklet"), p. 11] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014231911/http://www.cbp.gov/linkhandler/cgov/newsroom/publications/trade/iius.ctt/iius.pdf |date=2011-10-14 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Importation and declaration and payment of customs duties is done by the importer of record, which may be the owner of the goods, the purchaser, or a licensed customs broker. Goods may be stored in a bonded warehouse or a Foreign-Trade Zone in the United States for up to five years without payment of duties. Goods must be declared for entry into the U.S. within 15 days of arrival or prior to leaving a bonded warehouse or foreign trade zone. Many importers participate in a voluntary self-assessment program with CBP. Special rules apply to goods imported by mail. All goods imported into the United States are subject to inspection by CBP. Some goods may be temporarily imported to the United States under a system similar to the [[ATA Carnet]] system. Examples include laptop computers used by persons traveling in the U.S. and samples used by salesmen.

===Origin===
Rates of tax on transaction values vary by [[country of origin]]. Goods must be individually labeled to indicate country of origin, with exceptions for specific types of goods. Goods are considered to originate in the country with the highest rate of duties for the particular goods unless the goods meet certain minimum content requirements. Extensive modifications to normal duties and classifications apply to goods originating in Canada or Mexico under the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]].

===Classification===
All goods that are not exempt are subject to duty computed according to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule published by CBP and the U.S. International Trade Commission. This lengthy schedule&lt;ref&gt;The [http://www.usitc.gov/publications/docs/tata/hts/bychapter/1100htsa.pdf January 2011 edition] in .pdf exceeds 3,000 pages, including country-specific rules and annotations.&lt;/ref&gt; provides rates of duty for each class of goods. Most goods are classified based on the nature of the goods, though some classifications are based on use.

===Duty rate===
Customs duty rates may be expressed as a percentage of value or dollars and cents per unit. Rates based on value vary from zero to 20% in the 2011 schedule.&lt;ref&gt;A higher rate of duty (up to 81%) applies to goods from Cuba or North Korea.&lt;/ref&gt; Rates may be based on relevant units for the particular type of goods (per ton, per kilogram, per square meter, etc.). Some duties are based in part on value and in part on quantity.

Where goods subject to different rates of duty are commingled, the entire shipment may be taxed at the highest applicable duty rate.&lt;ref&gt;CBP Booklet, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Procedures===
Imported goods are generally accompanied by a [[bill of lading]] or air waybill describing the goods. For purposes of customs duty assessment, they must also be accompanied by an invoice documenting the transaction value. The goods on the bill of lading and invoice are classified and duty is computed by the importer or CBP. The amount of this duty is payable immediately, and must be paid before the goods can be imported. Most assessments of goods are now done by the importer and documentation filed with CBP electronically.

After duties have been paid, CBP approves the goods for import. They can then be removed from the port of entry, bonded warehouse, or Free-Trade Zone.

After duty has been paid on particular goods, the importer can seek a refund of duties if the goods are exported without substantial modification. The process of claiming a refund is known as duty drawback.

===Penalties===
Certain civil penalties apply for failures to follow CBP rules and pay duty. Goods of persons subject to such penalties may be seized and sold by CBP. In addition, criminal penalties may apply for certain offenses. Criminal penalties may be as high as twice the value of the goods plus twenty years in jail.

===Foreign-Trade Zones===
[[Foreign trade zones of the United States|Foreign-Trade Zones]] are secure areas physically in the United States but legally outside the customs territory of the United States. Such zones are generally near ports of entry. They may be within the warehouse of an importer. Such zones are limited in scope and operation based on approval of the Foreign-Trade Zones Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Foreign-Trade Zones Board|url=http://enforcement.trade.gov/FTZPAGE/index.html|publisher=[[United States Commercial Service]]|accessdate=18 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goods in a Foreign-Trade Zone are not considered imported to the United States until they leave the Zone. Foreign goods may be used to manufacture other goods within the zone for export without payment of customs duties.&lt;ref&gt;CBP Booklet, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Estate and gift taxes==
{{Main|Estate tax in the United States|Gift tax in the United States|Generation-skipping transfer tax}}

Estate and gift taxes in the United States are imposed by the federal and some state governments.&lt;ref&gt;See IRS [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p950/index.html Publication 950], Introduction to Estate and Gift Taxes.&lt;/ref&gt; The estate tax is an excise tax levied on the right to pass property at death. It is imposed on the estate, not the beneficiary. Some states impose an inheritance tax on recipients of bequests. Gift taxes are levied on the giver (donor) of property where the property is transferred for less than adequate consideration. An additional generation-skipping transfer (GST) tax is imposed by the federal and some state governments on transfers to grandchildren (or their descendants).

The federal gift tax is applicable to the donor, not the recipient, and is computed based on cumulative taxable gifts, and is reduced by prior gift taxes paid. The federal estate tax is computed on the sum of taxable estate and taxable gifts, and is reduced by prior gift taxes paid. These taxes are computed as the taxable amount times a graduated tax rate (up to 35% in 2011). The estate and gift taxes are also reduced by a "unified credit" equivalent to an exclusion ($5 million in 2011). Rates and exclusions have varied, and the benefits of lower rates and the credit have been phased out during some years.

Taxable gifts are certain gifts of U.S. property by nonresident aliens, most gifts of any property by citizens or residents, in excess of an annual exclusion ($13,000 for gifts made in 2011) per donor per donee. Taxable estates are certain U.S. property of non-resident alien decedents, and most property of citizens or residents. For aliens, residence for estate tax purposes is primarily based on domicile, but U.S. citizens are taxed regardless of their country of residence. U.S. real estate and most tangible property in the U.S. are subject to estate and gift tax whether the decedent or donor is resident or nonresident, citizen or alien.

The taxable amount of a gift is the fair market value of the property in excess of consideration received at the date of gift. The taxable amount of an estate is the gross fair market value of all rights considered property at the date of death (or an alternative valuation date) ("gross estate"), less liabilities of the decedent, costs of administration (including funeral expenses) and certain other deductions. State estate taxes are deductible, with limitations, in computing the federal taxable estate. Bequests to charities reduce the taxable estate.

Gift tax applies to all irrevocable transfers of interests in tangible or intangible property. Estate tax applies to all property owned in whole or in part by a citizen or resident at the time of his or her death, to the extent of the interest in the property. Generally, all types of property are subject to estate tax.&lt;ref&gt;Nonresident aliens are subject to estate and gift tax only on property interests considered to have U.S. situs.&lt;/ref&gt; Whether a decedent has sufficient interest in property for the property to be subject to gift or estate tax is determined under applicable state property laws. Certain interests in property that lapse at death (such as life insurance) are included in the taxable estate.

Taxable values of estates and gifts are the fair market value. For some assets, such as widely traded stocks and bonds, the value may be determined by market listings. The value of other property may be determined by appraisals, which are subject to potential contest by the taxing authority. Special use valuation applies to farms and [[closely held corporation|closely held businesses]], subject to limited dollar amount and other conditions. Monetary assets, such as cash, mortgages, and notes, are valued at the face amount, unless another value is clearly established.

Life insurance proceeds are included in the gross estate. The value of a right of a beneficiary of an estate to receive an annuity is included in the gross estate. Certain transfers during lifetime may be included in the gross estate. Certain powers of a decedent to control the disposition of property by another are included in the gross estate.

The taxable estate of a married decedent is reduced by a deduction for all property passing to the decedent's spouse. Certain terminable interests are included. Other conditions may apply.

Donors of gifts in excess of the annual exclusion must file gift tax returns on IRS [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f709.pdf Form 709] and pay the tax. Executors of estates with a gross value in excess of the unified credit must file an estate tax return on IRS [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f706.pdf Form 706] and pay the tax from the estate. Returns are required if the gifts or gross estate exceed the exclusions. Each state has its own forms and filing requirements. Tax authorities may examine and adjust gift and estate tax returns.

==Licenses and occupational taxes==
Many jurisdictions within the United States impose taxes or fees on the privilege of carrying on a particular business or maintaining a particular professional certification. These licensing or occupational taxes may be a fixed dollar amount per year for the licensee, an amount based on the number of practitioners in the firm, a percentage of revenue, or any of several other bases. Persons providing professional or personal services are often subject to such fees. Common examples include accountants, attorneys, barbers, casinos, dentists, doctors, auto mechanics, plumbers, and stock brokers. In addition to the tax, other requirements may be imposed for licensure.

All 50 states impose vehicle license fee. Generally, the fees are based on type and size of vehicle and are imposed annually or biannually. All states and the District of Columbia also impose a fee for a driver's license, which generally must be renewed with payment of fee every few years.

===User fees===
Fees are often imposed by governments for use of certain facilities or services. Such fees are generally imposed at the time of use. Multi-use permits may be available. For example, fees are imposed for use of national or state parks, for requesting and obtaining certain rulings from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS), for the use of certain highways (called "tolls" or toll roads), for parking on public streets, and for the use of public transit.

==Tax administration==
[[File:Tax revenue as a percentage of GDP (1985-2014).png|thumb|The total tax revenue as a percentage of [[GDP]] for the U.S. over the past several decades compared to other highly developed states]]

Taxes in the United States are administered by hundreds of tax authorities. At the federal level there are three tax administrations. Most domestic federal taxes are administered by the Internal Revenue Service, which is part of the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]]. Alcohol, tobacco, and firearms taxes are administered by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB). Taxes on imports (customs duties) are administered by [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] (CBP). TTB is also part of the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]] and CBP belongs to the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cbp.gov/ |title=CBP website says Department of Homeland Security at bottom right of page |publisher=Cbp.gov |date=2005-09-28 |accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organization of state and local tax administrations varies widely. Every state maintains a tax administration. A few states administer some local taxes in whole or part. Most localities also maintain a tax administration or share one with neighboring localities.

===Federal===

====Internal Revenue Service====
{{Main|Internal Revenue Service}}

The Internal Revenue Service administers all U.S. federal tax laws on domestic activities, except those taxes administered by TTB. IRS functions include:
* Processing federal tax returns (except TTB returns), including those for Social Security and other federal payroll taxes
* Providing assistance to taxpayers in completing tax returns
* Collecting all taxes due related to such returns
* Enforcement of tax laws through examination of returns and assessment of penalties
* Providing an appeals mechanism for federal tax disputes
* Referring matters to the Justice Department for prosecution
* Publishing information about U.S. federal taxes, including forms, publications, and other materials
* Providing written guidance in the form of rulings binding on the IRS for the public and for particular taxpayers

The IRS maintains several Service Centers at which tax returns are processed. Taxpayers generally [https://www.irs.gov/file/article/0,,id=111453,00.html file] most types of tax returns by mail with these Service Centers, or file electronically. The IRS also maintains a National Office in Washington, DC, and numerous [https://www.irs.gov/localcontacts/index.html local offices] providing taxpayer services and administering tax examinations.

=====Examination=====
Tax returns filed with the IRS are subject to [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p556/index.html examination] and adjustment, commonly called an IRS audit. Only a small percentage of returns ([https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/08db09bex.xls about 1% of individual returns in IRS FY 2008]) are examined each year. The selection of returns uses a variety of methods based on IRS experiences. On examination, the IRS may request additional information from the taxpayer by mail, in person at IRS local offices, or at the business location of the taxpayer. The taxpayer is entitled to representation by an [[Attorneys in the United States|attorney]], [[Certified Public Accountant]] (CPA), or [[enrolled agent]], at the expense of the taxpayer, who may make representations to the IRS on behalf of the taxpayer.

Taxpayers have certain rights in an audit. Upon conclusion of the audit, the IRS may accept the tax return as filed or [https://www.irs.gov/businesses/article/0,,id=180776,00.html propose adjustments] to the return. The IRS may also assess [[IRS penalties|penalties]] and interest. Generally, adjustments must be proposed within [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6501- three years] of the due date of the tax return. Certain circumstances extend this time limit, including substantial understatement of income and fraud. The taxpayer and the IRS may [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/form872.pdf agree] to allow the IRS additional time to conclude an audit. If the IRS proposes adjustments, the taxpayer may agree to the adjustment, [[Office of Appeals|appeal within the IRS]], or seek judicial determination of the tax.

=====Published and private rulings=====
In addition to enforcing tax laws, the IRS provides formal and informal guidance to taxpayers. While often referred to as IRS Regulations, the regulations under the Internal Revenue Code are issued by the Department of Treasury. IRS guidance consists of:

* [[Revenue Ruling]]s, Revenue Procedures, and various IRS pronouncements applicable to all taxpayers and published in the [[Internal Revenue Bulletin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Internal Revenue Bulletin:  2012-23|url=https://www.irs.gov/irb/2012-23_IRB/ar08.html|publisher=Internal Revenue Service|accessdate=7 June 2012|date=4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are binding on the IRS,
* [[Private letter ruling]]s on specific issues, applicable only to the taxpayer who applied for the ruling,
* [https://www.irs.gov/formspubs/article/0,,id=98171,00.html IRS Publications] providing informal instruction to the public on tax matters,
* [https://www.irs.gov/app/picklist/list/formsInstructions.html IRS forms and instructions],
* A comprehensive [https://www.irs.gov web site], and
* Informal (nonbinding) advice by telephone.

====Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau====
{{Main|Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau}}

The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Trade Bureau (TTB), a division of the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]], enforces federal excise tax laws related to alcohol, tobacco, and firearms. TTB has six divisions, each with discrete functions:

* Revenue Center: processes tax returns and issues permits, and related activities
* Risk Management: internally develops guidelines and monitors programs
* Tax Audit: verifies filing and payment of taxes
* Trade Investigations: investigating arm for non-tobacco items
* Tobacco Enforcement Division: enforcement actions for tobacco
* Advertising, Labeling, and Formulation Division: implements various labeling and ingredient monitoring

Criminal enforcement related to TTB is done by the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives]], a division of the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]].

====Customs and Border Protection====
{{Main|U.S. Customs and Border Protection}}

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), an agency of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]], collects customs duties and regulates international trade. It has a workforce of over 58,000 employees covering over 300 official ports of entry to the United States. CBP has authority to seize and dispose of cargo in the case of certain violations of customs rules.

===State administrations===
Every state in the United States has its own tax administration, subject to the rules of that state's law and regulations. These are referred to in most states as the Department of Revenue or Department of Taxation. The powers of the state taxing authorities vary widely. Most enforce all state level taxes but not most local taxes. However, many states have unified state-level sales tax administration, including for local sales taxes.

State tax returns are filed separately with those tax administrations, not with the federal tax administrations. Each state has its own procedural rules, which vary widely.

===Local administrations===
Most localities within the United States administer most of their own taxes. In many cases, there are multiple local taxing jurisdictions with respect to a particular taxpayer or property. For property taxes, the taxing jurisdiction is typically represented by a tax assessor/collector whose offices are located at the taxing jurisdiction's facilities.

==Legal basis==
The [[United States Constitution]] provides that [[United States Congress|Congress]] "shall have the power to lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts, and Excises ... but all Duties, Imposts, and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States."&lt;ref&gt;Constitution Article I Section 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to amendment, it provided that "No Capitation, or other direct, Tax shall be Laid unless in proportion to the Census ..." The [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|16th Amendment]] provided that "Congress shall have the power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration." The [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|10th Amendment]] provided that "powers not delegated to the United States by this Constitution, nor prohibited to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."

Congress has enacted numerous laws dealing with taxes since adoption of the Constitution. Those laws are now codified as [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode19/usc_sup_01_19.html Title 19], Customs Duties, [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sup_01_26.html Title 26], Internal Revenue Code, and various other provisions. These laws specifically authorize the United States Secretary of the Treasury to delegate various powers related to levy, assessment and collection of taxes.

State constitutions uniformly grant the state government the right to levy and collect taxes. Limitations under state constitutions vary widely.

Various [[Tax protester (United States)|individuals and groups]] have questioned the legitimacy of United States federal income tax. These [[Tax protester arguments|arguments]] are varied, but have been uniformly rejected by the Internal Revenue Service and by the courts and ruled to be frivolous.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-utl/friv_tax.pdf Frivolous Tax], Internal Revenue Service&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''United States v.

For background on how arguments that the tax laws are unconstitutional may help the prosecution prove willfulness in [[Tax avoidance and tax evasion|tax evasion]] cases, see the United States Supreme Court decision in {{ussc|name=Cheek v. United States|link=|volume=498|page=192|pin=|year=1991}} (defendant arguing about constitutionality may be evidence that the defendant was aware of the tax law, and is not a defense to a charge of willfulness).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policy issues==
{{Main|Progressivity in United States income tax}}

Commentators Benjamin Page, Larry Bartels and Jason Seawright contend that Federal tax policy in relation to regulation and reform in the United States tends to favor wealthy Americans. They assert that political influence is a legal right the wealthy can exercise by contributing funds to lobby for their policy preference.&lt;ref name="Page 51–73"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Page|first=Benjamin I.|last2=Bartels|first2=Larry M.|last3=Seawright|first3=Jason|title=Democracy and the Policy Preferences of Wealthy Americans|journal=Perspectives on Politics|volume=11|issue=1|pages=51–73|doi=10.1017/s153759271200360x|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Distribution of U.S. Federal Taxes 2000.JPG|thumb|The distribution of U.S. federal taxes for 2000 as a percentage of income among the family income quintiles]]
Each major type of tax in the United States has been used by some jurisdiction at some time as a tool of social policy. Both liberals and conservatives have called for more [[progressive tax]]es in the U.S.&lt;ref name=YglesiasWealth&gt;{{cite news|last=Yglesias|first=Matthew|title=America Does Tax Wealth, Just Not Very Intelligently|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/03/06/america_s_wealth_tax_it_s_called_property_taxes_and_they_re_not_very_smart.html|accessdate=18 March 2013|newspaper=Slate|date=March 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BairParity&gt;{{cite news|last=Bair|first=Sheila|title=Grand Old Parity|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/27/opinion/republicans-must-bridge-the-income-gap.html|accessdate=18 March 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=February 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Page, Bartels and Seawright assert that although members of the government favor a move toward progressive taxes, due to budget deficits upper class citizens are not yet willing to make a push for the change. Tax cuts were provided during the Bush administration, and were extended in 2010, making federal income taxes less progressive.&lt;ref name="Page 51–73"/&gt;

===Tax evasion===
{{Main|Tax evasion in the United States}}

The Internal Revenue Service estimated that in 2001, the tax gap was $345 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=154496,00.html |title=IRS Updates Tax Gap Estimates |publisher=Irs.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tax gap is the difference between the amount of tax legally owed and the amount actually collected by the government. The tax gap in 2006 was estimated to be $450 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tax Gap for Tax Year 2006 Overview Jan. 6, 2012|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/06rastg12overvw.pdf|publisher=U.S. Internal Revenue Service|accessdate=2012-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tax gap two years later in 2008 was estimated to be in the range of $450–$500 billion and unreported income was estimated to be approximately $2 trillion.&lt;ref name="ideas.repec.org"&gt;Richard Cebula and Edgar Feige "America's Underground Economy:  Measuring the Size, Growth and Determinants of Income Tax Evasion in the U.S" https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/29672.html&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, 18–19 percent of total reportable income was not properly reported to the IRS.&lt;ref name="ideas.repec.org"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Total government spending on all levels (United States).png|thumb|upright=2.5|right|Total government spending on all levels (United States)]]
{{Main|History of taxation in the United States}}

Before 1776, the American Colonies were subject to taxation by the United Kingdom, and also imposed local taxes. Property taxes were imposed in the Colonies as early as 1634.&lt;ref&gt;Jens P. Jensen, '''Property Taxation in the United States''', 1931, referring to a 1634 Massachusetts property tax statute.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1673, the English Parliament imposed a tax on exports from the American Colonies, and with it created the first tax administration in what would become the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taxhistory.org/www/website.nsf/Web/THM1660?OpenDocument Tax History Museum 1660–1712], [[Tax Analysts]].&lt;/ref&gt; Other tariffs and taxes were imposed by Parliament. Most of the colonies and many localities adopted property taxes.

Under Article VIII of the [[Articles of Confederation]], the United States government did not have the power to tax. All such power lay with the states. The [[United States Constitution]], adopted in 1787, authorized the federal government to lay and collect taxes, but required that some types of tax revenues be given to the states in proportion to population. Tariffs were the principal federal tax through the 1800s.

By 1796, state and local governments in fourteen of the 15 states taxed land. Delaware taxed the income from property. The War of 1812 required a federal sales tax on specific luxury items due to its costs. However, internal taxes were dropped in 1817 in favor of import tariffs that went to the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://blog.bookly.co/academy/why-do-we-pay-taxes|title = Bookly Academy|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the [[American Civil War]], the principle of taxation of property at a uniform rate had developed, and many of the states relied on property taxes as a major source of revenue. However, the increasing importance of intangible property, such as corporate stock, caused the states to shift to other forms of taxation in the 1900s.

Income taxes in the form of "faculty" taxes were imposed by the colonies. These combined income and property tax characteristics, and the income element persisted after 1776 in a few states. Several states adopted income taxes in 1837.&lt;ref&gt;Hellerstein, p. 928.&lt;/ref&gt; Wisconsin adopted a corporate and individual income tax in 1911,&lt;ref&gt;Hellerstein, p. 431.&lt;/ref&gt; and was the first to administer the tax with a state tax administration.

The first federal income tax was adopted as part of the [[Revenue Act of 1861]].&lt;ref&gt;Revenue Act of 1861, sec. 49, ch. 45, 12 Stat. 292, 309 (Aug. 5, 1861).&lt;/ref&gt; The tax lapsed after the American Civil War. Subsequently enacted income taxes were held to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in ''[[Pollock v. Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Co.]]'' because they did not apportion taxes on property by state population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0157_0429_ZS.html |title=Pollock v. Farmers' Loan and Trust Company |publisher=Law.cornell.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913, the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] was ratified, permitting the federal government to levy an income tax on both property and labor.

[[File:U.S. Federal Tax Receipts as a Percentage of GDP 1945–2015.jpg|thumb|U.S. federal government tax receipts as a percentage of GDP from 1945 to 2015 (note that 2010 to 2015 data are estimated)]]
The federal income tax enacted in 1913 included corporate and individual income taxes. It defined income using language from prior laws, incorporated in the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixteenth Amendment]], as "all income from whatever source derived". The tax allowed deductions for business expenses, but few non-business deductions. In 1918 the income tax law was expanded to include a [[foreign tax credit]] and more comprehensive definitions of income and deduction items. Various aspects of the present system of definitions were expanded through 1926, when U.S. law was organized as the United States Code. Income, estate, gift, and excise tax provisions, plus provisions relating to tax returns and enforcement, were codified as Title 26, also known as the [[Internal Revenue Code]]. This was reorganized and somewhat expanded in 1954, and remains in the same general form.

Federal taxes were expanded greatly during [[World War I]]. In 1921, Treasury Secretary [[Andrew Mellon]] engineered a series of significant income tax cuts under three presidents. Mellon argued that tax cuts would spur growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.taxhistory.org/www/website.nsf/Web/THM1901?OpenDocument |title=Tax History Museum, 1901–1932 |publisher=Taxhistory.org |date=1906-04-14 |accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taxes were raised again in the latter part of the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], and during [[World War II]]. Income tax rates were reduced significantly during the [[Presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson|Johnson]], [[Presidency of Richard Nixon|Nixon]], and [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan presidencies]]. Significant tax cuts for corporations and all individuals were enacted during the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|second Bush presidency]].

In 1986, Congress adopted, with little modification, a major expansion of the income tax portion of the IRS Code proposed in 1985 by the U.S. Treasury Department under President Reagan. The thousand-page [[Tax Reform Act of 1986]] significantly lowered tax rates, adopted sweeping expansions of international rules, eliminated the lower individual tax rate for capital gains, added significant inventory accounting rules, and made substantial other expansions of the law.

Federal income tax rates have been modified frequently. Tax rates were changed in 34 of the 97 years between 1913 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;See changes in [[Revenue Act of 1916|1916]], [[War Revenue Act of 1917|1917]], [[Revenue Act of 1918|1918]], [[Revenue Act of 1921|1921, 1922]], [[Revenue Act of 1924|1924]], [[Revenue Act of 1926|1926]], [[Revenue Act of 1928|1928]],   [[Revenue Act of 1932|1932]], [[Revenue Act of 1934|1934]], [[Revenue Act of 1935|1935]], [[Revenue Act of 1936|1936]], [[Revenue Act of 1940|1940]],  [[Revenue Act of 1941|1941]], [[Revenue Act of 1942|1942]], [[Revenue Act of 1943|1943]], [[Individual Income Tax Act of 1944|1944]],  [[Revenue Act of 1945|1945]], [[Revenue Act of 1948|1948]], [[Revenue Act of 1950|1950]], [[Revenue Act of 1951|1951, 1953]], [[Internal Revenue Code|1954]], [[Revenue Act of 1964|1964]], [[Revenue and Expenditure Control Act of 1968|1968]], [[Tax Reform Act of 1969|1969]], [[Tax Reduction Act of 1975|1975]], [[Revenue Act of 1978|1978]], [[Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981|1981]], [[Tax Reform Act of 1986|1986]], [[Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993|1993]], [[Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997|1997]], [[Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001|2001]], and [[Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003|2003]].&lt;/ref&gt; The rate structure has been graduated since the 1913 act.

The first individual income tax return [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-prior/f1040--1913.pdf Form 1040 under the 1913] law was four pages long. In 1915, some Congressmen complained about the complexity of the form.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taxhistory.org/www/website.nsf/Web/THM1901?OpenDocument Tax History Museum] covering 1914–1915.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921, Congress considered but did not enact replacement of the income tax with a national sales tax.

By the 1920s, many states had adopted income taxes on individuals and corporations.&lt;ref&gt;Hellerstein, pp. 429, 431.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the state taxes were simply based on the federal definitions. The states generally taxed residents on all of their income, including income earned in other states, as well as income of nonresidents earned in the state. This led to a long line of Supreme Court cases limiting the ability of states to tax income of nonresidents.

The states had also come to rely heavily on retail sales taxes. However, as of the beginning of World War II, only two cities (New York and New Orleans) had local sales taxes.&lt;ref&gt;Hellerstein, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Federal Estate Tax was introduced in 1916, and Gift Tax in 1924. Unlike many inheritance taxes, the Gift and Estate taxes were imposed on the transferor rather than the recipient. Many states adopted either inheritance taxes or estate and gift taxes, often computed as the amount allowed as a deduction for federal purposes. These taxes remained under 1% of government revenues through the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Budget 2012 [http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/Historicals historical tables] 2.4 and 2.5. Census Bureau [http://www2.census.gov/govs/statetax/00staxss.xls state tax summary table, year 2000].&lt;/ref&gt;

All governments within the United States provide [[tax exemption]] for some income, property, or persons. These exemptions have their roots both in tax theory,&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', Martin, James W. ''et al'', ''Tax Exemptions'', Tax Policy League, New York, cited in Hellerstein, pp. 1013–17.&lt;/ref&gt; federal and state legislative history,&lt;ref&gt;The 1861 federal income tax exempted religious, charitable, educational, and scientific organizations.&lt;/ref&gt; and the United States Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;The Supreme Court ruled that the federal government is immune from state taxation in [[McCulloch v. Maryland]], 17 U.S. 316 (1819).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Title insurance''' is a form of [[indemnity]] insurance predominantly found in the United States which insures against financial loss from defects in [[title (property)|title]] to [[real property]] and from the invalidity or unenforceability of [[mortgage loan]]s. The vast majority of title insurance policies are written on land within the United States. Unlike some [[land registration]] systems in countries outside the US, the US states' [[recorder of deeds]] generally do not guarantee [[Torrens title#Indefeasibility of title|indefeasible title]] to those [[Recording (real estate)|recorded]] titles.  Title insurance will defend against a [[lawsuit]] attacking the title, or reimburse the insured for the actual monetary loss incurred up to the dollar amount of insurance provided by the policy.

The first title insurance company, the Law Property Assurance and Trust Society, was formed in Pennsylvania in 1853.&lt;ref&gt;D. B. Burke, Jr., ''Law of Title Insurance'', Little Brown &amp; Company (1986) § 1.1, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically the real property interests insured are [[fee simple]] ownership or a [[mortgage law|mortgage]]. However, title insurance can be purchased to insure any interest in real property, including an [[easement]], [[lease]] or [[life estate]].

There are two types of policies – owner and lender.  Just as lenders require [[fire insurance]] and other types of insurance coverage to protect their investment, nearly all institutional lenders also require title insurance [a loan policy] to protect their interest in the collateral of loans secured by real estate. Some mortgage lenders, especially non-institutional lenders, may not require title insurance. Buyers purchasing properties for cash or with a mortgage lender often want title insurance [an owner policy] as well.  A loan policy provides no coverage or benefit for the buyer/owner and so the decision to purchase an owner policy is independent of the lender's decision to require a loan policy.

Title insurance is available in many other countries, such as Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, Mexico, New Zealand, Japan, China, Korea and throughout Europe. However, while a substantial number of properties located in these countries are insured by U.S. title insurers, they do not constitute a significant share of the real estate transactions in those countries. They also do not constitute a large share of U.S. title insurers' revenues. In many cases these are properties to be used for commercial purposes by U.S. companies doing business abroad, or properties financed by U.S lenders. The U.S. companies involved buy title insurance to obtain the security of a U.S. insurer backing up the evidence of title that they receive from the other country's [[land registration]] system, and payment of legal defense costs if the title is challenged.

==History==
Prior to the invention of title insurance, buyers in real estate transactions bore sole responsibility for ensuring the validity of the [[land title]] held by the seller. If the title were later deemed invalid or found to be fraudulent, the buyer lost his investment.

In 1868, the case of ''[[Watson v. Muirhead]]'' was heard by the [[Pennsylvania Supreme Court]]. Plaintiff Watson had lost his investment in a real estate transaction as the result of a prior [[lien]] on the property. Defendant Muirhead, the [[conveyancer]], had discovered the lien prior to the sale but told Watson the title was clear after his lawyer had (erroneously) determined that the lien was not valid.

The courts ruled that Muirhead (and others in similar situations) was not liable for mistakes based on professional opinions. As a result, in 1874, the Pennsylvania legislature passed an act allowing for the incorporation of title insurance companies.

Joshua Morris, a conveyancer in [[Philadelphia]], and several colleagues met on March 28, 1876 to incorporate the first title insurance company. The new firm, [[Real Estate Title Insurance Company of Philadelphia]], would "insure the purchasers of real estate and mortgages against losses from defective titles, liens and encumbrances," and that "through these facilities, transfer of real estate and real estate securities can be made more speedily and with greater security than heretofore."

Morris' aunt purchased the first policy, valued at $1,500, to cover a home on North 43rd Street in [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref&gt;Craig, Mark R.

==Reason for existence==
There are two types of title systems used worldwide: Land registration and land recording.

Most of the industrialized world uses [[land registration]] systems for the transfer of land titles or interests in them.&lt;ref name=DifferentLegal&gt;Arruñada B. (2002). [http://www.recercat.net/bitstream/handle/2072/710/565.pdf?sequence=1 A Transaction-Cost View of Title Insurance and its Role in Different Legal Systems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924085336/http://www.recercat.net/bitstream/handle/2072/710/565.pdf?sequence=1 |date=September 24, 2015 }}. ''The Geneva Papers of Risk and Insurance''.&lt;/ref&gt; Under these systems, the government determines title ownership and encumbrances using its land registration; with only a few exceptions, the government's determination is conclusive. Governmental errors lead to monetary compensation to the person damaged by the error but that aggrieved party usually cannot recover the property.  The [[Torrens title]] system is the basis for land registration systems in several [[common law]] countries.  Nineteen jurisdictions in the United States, such as [[Minnesota]] and [[Massachusetts]], adopted a form of this system between 1896 and 1917, however it fell out of favor after single judgement in Imperial County, CA, bankrupted the state's title indemnification fund, and the vast majority of U.S. states have opted for a system of document recording in which no governmental official makes any determination of who owns the title or whether the instruments transferring it are valid.

In the [[recording (real estate)|recording]] system, each time a land title transaction takes place, the parties record the transfer instrument with a local government recorder located in the jurisdiction (usually the county) where the land lies. The government indexes the instrument by the names of the grantor (transferor) and the grantee (transferee) and photographs it so any member of the public can find and examine it. If such a transaction goes unrecorded for any reason or length of time, an unscrupulous grantor could sell the property to another grantee. In many states, the grantee whose transaction is recorded first becomes the legal owner, and any other would-be buyers are left without recourse..{{Clarify|date=September 2015}}

The advantage of the recording system is:
* In a registration system, the cost and risk are borne by the general public, but in a recording system, cost and risk are borne by the users of the system
* In a recording system, an independent authority reviews government land transfers. In a registration system government can decide registration disputes in its favor, preventing separation of powers and the constitutional right to due process of law
* A recording system can provide for conveyance of land for situations beyond the capacity of public records, such as homesteading and inheritance.
* A recording system combined with title insurance decentralizes records, creating redundancy. For example, when many records were destroyed in San Francisco's 1906 earthquake, out of town title companies maintained records that allowed landowners to prove ownership of their property.

Under this system, to determine who has title, one must:
* Examine the indexes in the recorders' offices, pursuant to various rules established by state legislatures and courts
* Scrutinize the recorded instruments
* Determine how they affect the title under applicable law.  The final arbiters of title matters are the courts, which make decisions in suits brought by disagreeing parties. Historically, the person who wanted to understand the title would hire an abstractor to write a [[property abstract]] showing the [[chain of title]]. However, if the abstractor makes an error, the client may only be compensated if the attorney is negligent, subject to the limit of his financial responsibility (including his liability insurance).&lt;ref&gt;See ''Watson v. Muirhead'' 57 Pa. 161 (1868) where an attorney made a non-negligent error and was not required to compensate the purchaser of the property. Historians say this case was the impetus for title insurance in the U.S.  See D.B. Burke, Jr., ''Law of Title Insurance'', Little Brown &amp; Company (1986) § 1.1, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the willingness of these professionals to accept strict liability varies.&lt;ref name=DifferentLegal/&gt;

Title insurers conduct a [[title search]] on public records before they agree to insure the purchaser or mortgagee of land.  Specifically, after a real estate sales contract has been executed and escrow opened, a title professional will search the public records to look for any problems with the home's title. This search typically involves a review of land records going back many years. More than one-third of all title searches reveal a title problem that title professionals will insist on fixing before the transaction closes. For instance, a previous owner may have had minor construction done on the property, but never fully paid the contractor (resulting in a mechanic's lien), or the previous owner may have failed to pay local or state taxes (resulting in a tax lien). Title professionals seek to resolve problems like these before the transaction closes, since otherwise, their employer, the title insurer, will be required to fix such title defects by paying such unpaid fees or taxes.

Title insurance policies are fairly uniform, and backed by [[statutory reserve]]s, which is especially important in large commercial real estate transactions where the buyer and their lender have a lot of money at stake. The insurer also pays for the defense of its insured in legal contests.

At least 20 U.S. states have experimented with Torrens title or other title registration systems at one time or another, but most have retreated to title recording under pressure from title insurers or from lack of interest.  According to [[Karl Llewellyn]], one Torrens title on one lot in New York City can render the entire block unavailable for large-scale improvement (i.e., skyscrapers); no lender will finance the purchase of such a lot because no New York title insurer will guarantee a Torrens title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Llewellyn|first=Karl Nickerson|title=Jurisprudence: Realism in Theory and Practice|year=2008|publisher=Transaction Publishers|location=New Brunswick, NJ|isbn=1412807867|pages=33|edition=Orig. pub. in 1962 by U. Chicago Press, reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. title insurance industry has successfully opposed land registration systems by saying that they are vulnerable to fraud (a severe problem in most land registration jurisdictions) and that an inherently contingent property system more effectively protects property rights.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} While it is possible to fortify land registration systems to prevent the registration of forged deeds, the necessary countermeasures are complex and expensive.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}  A 2007 book attacking the American title insurance "cartel" acknowledged that "[m]ore extensive use of Torrens certification would require setting up a special judicially supervised bureaucracy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eaton|first=Joseph and David|title=The American Title Insurance Industry: How a Cartel Fleeces the American Consumer|year=2007|publisher=NYU Press|location=New York|isbn=0814722407|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of policies==
Standardized forms of title insurance exist for owners and lenders. The lender's policies include a form specifically for construction loans, though this is rarely used today.

===Owner's policy===
The owner's policy assures a purchaser that the title to the property is vested in that purchaser and that it is free from all defects, liens and encumbrances except those listed as exceptions in the policy or are excluded from the scope of the policy's coverage. It also covers losses and damages suffered if the title is unmarketable.&lt;ref&gt;A title is unmarketable if it would be unacceptable to a reasonable purchaser exercising reasonable business prudence, who is informed of the facts creating or affecting it and their legal meaning, because it appears subject to material defect, grave doubt or to the likelihood of litigation. However, the title need not be bad in fact to be "unmarketable." ''Black's Law Dictionary'' 4th Ed. West Publishing Co. 1951) defining "Marketable Title" and "Unmarketable Title."&lt;/ref&gt; The policy also provides coverage for loss if there is no right of access to the land. Although these are the basic coverages, expanded forms of residential owner's policies exist that cover additional items of loss.&lt;ref&gt;Examples are the American Land Title Association Residential Owner's Policy and Expanded Coverage Residential Owner's Policy.&lt;/ref&gt;

The liability limit of the owner's policy is typically the purchase price paid for the property. As with other types of insurance, coverages can also be added or deleted with an endorsement. There are many forms of standard endorsements to cover a variety of common issues. The premium for the policy may be paid by the seller or buyer as the parties agree. Usually a custom in a particular state or county on this matter reflects in most local real estate contracts. One should inquire about the cost of title insurance before signing a real estate contract that provides that he pay for title charges. A real estate attorney, broker, [[escrow]] officer (in the western states), or loan officer can provide detailed information as to the price of [[title search]] and insurance before the real estate contract is signed. Title insurance coverage lasts as long as the insured retains an interest in the land insured and typically no additional premium is paid after the policy is issued.

===Lender's policy===
This is sometimes called a loan policy and it is issued only to mortgage lenders. Generally speaking, it follows the assignment of the mortgage loan, meaning that the policy benefits the purchaser of the loan if the loan is sold. For this reason, these policies greatly facilitate the sale of mortgages into the secondary market. That market is made up of high volume purchasers such as Fannie Mae and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation as well as private institutions.

The [[American Land Title Association]] ("ALTA") forms are almost universally used in the country though they have been modified in some states. In general, the basic elements of insurance they provide to the lender cover losses from the following matters:

#The title to the property on which the mortgage is being made is either
#*Not in the mortgage loan borrower,
#*Subject to defects, liens or encumbrances, or
#*Unmarketable.
#There is no right of access to the land.
#The lien created by the mortgage:
#*is invalid or unenforceable,
#*is not prior to any other lien existing on the property on the date the policy is written, or
#*is subject to mechanic's liens under certain circumstances.

As with all of the ALTA forms, the policy also covers the cost of defending insured matters against attack.

Elements 1 and 2 are important to the lender because they cover its expectations of the title it will receive if it must foreclose its mortgage. Element 3 covers matters that will interfere with its foreclosure.

Of course, all of the policies except or exclude certain matters and are subject to various conditions.

There are also ALTA mortgage policies covering single or one-to-four family housing mortgages. These cover the elements of loss listed above plus others. Examples of the other coverages are loss from forged releases of the mortgage and loss resulting from encroachments of improvements on adjoining land onto the mortgaged property when the improvements are constructed after the loan is made.

===Construction loan policy=== &lt;!-- needs expansion --&gt;
In many states, separate policies exist for construction loans. Title insurance for construction loans require a Date Down endorsement that recognizes that the insured amount for the property has increased due to construction funds that have been vested into the property.

==Land title associations and standardized policies==
In the United States, the [[American Land Title Association]] (ALTA) is a national non-profit trade association representing the interests of nearly 4,500 title insurance companies, title agents, independent abstracters, title searchers and attorneys across the United States.&lt;ref name="About Alta, Background &amp; History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alta.org/about/index.cfm#1|publisher=American Land Title Association|title=About Alta, Background &amp; History|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622024556/http://www.alta.org/about/index.cfm#1|archivedate=June 22, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ALTA members conduct title searches, examinations, closings, and issue title insurance that protects real property owners and mortgage lenders against losses from defects in titles.

Founded in 1907,&lt;ref name="About Alta, Background &amp; History"/&gt; ALTA has created standard forms of title insurance policy "jackets" (standard terms and conditions) for Owners, Lenders and Construction Loan policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alta.org/forms/index.cfm|publisher=American Land Title Association|title=Policy Forms Online|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130702165832/http://www.alta.org/forms/index.cfm|archivedate=July 2, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ALTA forms are used in most, but not all, U.S. states. ALTA also offers special endorsement forms for the various policies; endorsements amend and typically broaden the coverage given under a basic title insurance policy. ALTA does not issue title insurance; it provides standardized policy and endorsement forms that most title insurers issue.

Some states, including [[Texas]] and [[New York (state)|New York]], may mandate the use of forms of title insurance policy jackets and endorsements approved by the state insurance commissioner for properties located in those jurisdictions, but these forms are usually similar or identical to ALTA forms.

In addition to ALTA, the National Association of Independent Land Title Agents (NAILTA) is a national non-profit trade association that represents the interests of independent title insurance agents and independent real estate settlement professionals from across the United States. It was created by independent real estate settlement professionals to further the agenda of small business owners from within the title insurance, abstracting, surveying, and real estate community who lack representation at local, state and national levels.  NAILTA is a national trade association that serves thousands of independent title and real estate professionals across the United States who collectively comprise over 60% of the national title insurance market,&lt;ref&gt;See Demotech Performance of Title Insurance Companies 2012, p. 104.  Non-affiliated (independent) premiums written in 2011 totaled $5,575,537,135.00 or 60.19% of the overall title insurance market.&lt;/ref&gt; and identify themselves as independent settlement service providers. NAILTA represents the interests of those independent settlement service providers who serve over 31 million real estate purchase consumers per year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.realtor.org/sites/default/files/reports/2012/embargoes/2012-09-ehs/ehs-09-2012-overview-2012-10-19.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119065232/http://www.realtor.org/sites/default/files/reports/2012/embargoes/2012-09-ehs/ehs-09-2012-overview-2012-10-19.pdf |archivedate=November 19, 2012 |df=mdy-all }} (visited October 25, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; who close an estimated $514.8 billion's worth of refinance mortgages per year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mbaa.org/ResearchandForecasts/ForecastsandCommentary |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107234515/http://www.mbaa.org/ResearchandForecasts/ForecastsandCommentary |archivedate=November 7, 2012 |df=mdy-all }} (visited October 26, 2012).

See Demotech, p. 104, supra.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with other forms of insurance==
Title insurance differs in several respects from other types of insurance. Where most insurance is a contract where the insurer [[indemnity|indemnifies]] or guarantees another party against a possible specific type of loss (such as an accident or death) at a future date, title insurance generally insures against losses caused by title problems that have their source in past events. This often results in the curing of title defects or the elimination of adverse interests from the title before a transaction takes place. Title insurance companies attempt to achieve this by searching public records to develop and document the [[chain of title]] and to detect known claims against or defects in the title to the subject property. If liens or encumbrances are found, the insurer may require that steps be taken to eliminate them (for example, obtaining a release of an old mortgage or deed of trust that has been paid off, or requiring the payoff, or satisfying involuntary liens such as abstracts of judgment and tax liens) before issuing the title policy. In the alternative, it may except from the policy's coverage those items not eliminated. Title plants are sometimes maintained to index the public records geographically, with the goal of increasing searching efficiency and reducing claims. In some states title plants are required to index the real-property records geographically and also maintain a name file for judgments, probates and other general matters.

The explanation above discloses another difference between title insurance and other types: title insurance premiums are not principally calculated on the basis of [[actuarial science]], as is true in most other types of insurance. Instead of correlating the probability of losses with their projected costs, title insurance seeks to eliminate the source of the losses through the use of the [[Recording (real estate)|recording]] system and other underwriting practices. As a result, a relatively small fraction of title insurance premiums are used to pay insured losses. The great majority of the premiums is used to finance the title research on each piece of property and to maintain the title plants used to efficiently do that research. There is significant social utility in this approach as the result conforms with the expectations of most property purchasers and mortgage lenders. Generally, they want the real estate they purchased or lent money on to have the title condition they expected when they entered the transaction, rather than money compensation and litigation over unexpected defects. This is not to say that title insurers take no actuarial risks. There are several matters that can affect the title to land that are not disclosed by the recording system but that are covered by the policies. Some examples are deeds executed by minors or mentally incompetent persons, forged instruments (in some cases), corporate instruments executed without the proper corporate authority and errors in the public records. However, historically, these problems have not amounted to a high percentage of the losses paid by the insurers. A more significant percentage of losses paid by the insurers are the result of errors and omissions in the title examining process itself.

==Homeowner's right to choose a title insurance company==
In an April 2007 United States Government Accountability Office (GAO) Report on Title Insurance, the GAO recommended that state and federal legislators and regulators improve consumers ability to shop for title insurance based on price, encourage price competition, and ensure consumers are paying reasonable prices for title insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Title Insurance: Actions Needed to Improve Oversight of the Title Industry and Better Protect  Consumers|url=http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d07401.pdf|publisher=United States Government Accountability Offic|accessdate=February 26, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111101045629/http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d07401.pdf|archivedate=November 1, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A federal law called the [[Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act]] (RESPA) entitles an individual homeowner to choose a title insurance company when purchasing or refinancing residential property. Typically, homeowners do not make this decision for themselves and instead rely on their bank's or attorney's choice; however, the homeowner retains the right to choose a different insurer. RESPA makes it unlawful for any bank, broker, or attorney to mandate that a particular title insurance company be used. Doing so is a violation of federal law and any person or business doing so can be fined or lose its license.

Section 9 of RESPA prohibits a seller from requiring the buyer to use a particular title insurance company, either directly or indirectly, as a condition of sale. Buyers may sue a seller who violates this provision for an amount equal to three times all charges made for the title insurance. The only exception to this rule applies to commercial real estate transactions, which is not within the parameters of RESPA.

The new Good Faith Estimate (GFE)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homebuying.about.com/od/findingalender/qt/The-Basics-Of-A-Good-Faith-Estimate.htm |title=The Basics of a Good Faith, or Loan, Estimate |date=November 6, 2016 |accessdate=2017-04-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906054227/http://homebuying.about.com/od/findingalender/qt/The-Basics-Of-A-Good-Faith-Estimate.htm |archivedate=September 6, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the latest step taken by [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|Department of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD) to protect and assist consumers. In the past, lenders had provided potential borrowers with GFEs. However, there are major differences between what borrowers had historically received and what they would receive going forward under the new HUD regulation. Four major changes stand out:

1. Lenders are now required to issue the GFE
:If a loan originator does not provide a GFE within 3 business days of receiving a completed loan application, they are in violation of Section 5 of RESPA. HUD provides the specific criteria for what constitutes a complete loan application:

:* Borrower's name
:* Borrower's monthly income
:* Borrower's [[Social Security number]] (SSN) (to obtain a credit report)
:* Property address
:* The estimated value of the property
:* Loan amount
:* Anything else the lender deems necessary

2. The new GFE is standardized
:All lenders must provide consumers with the exact same document. Loan charges, third-party fees, and other costs must be displayed uniformly. Previously, lenders were not uniform in their interpretations of what fees should be included on the GFE and where such fees should be disclosed.

3. The new GFE encourages consumers to shop
:Since lenders are now required to issue a standardized GFE in a specific time frame, consumers are provided an opportunity to compare lenders and their products. Further, HUD states that prior to the issuance of a GFE, lenders can only charge potential borrowers a fee to cover the expense of a credit report. The relative low cost of credit reports ($15–30) results in consumers' ability to comparison shop many lenders at a minimal cost.

4. Lenders are accountable for their quotes
:Each section in the GFE now directly corresponds to a section of the HUD-1. The HUD-1 is a standardized document that lists every expense involved in a real estate or refinance transaction and is presented to the borrower during the closing process. Each section in the new GFE is now designated a tolerance level. There are three different tolerance levels:

::a. 0% Tolerance. If at the closing, any item in the 0% Tolerance category is higher on the corresponding section of the HUD-1 compared to the original GFE, the lender is responsible for covering the difference.

::b. 10% Tolerance. Unlike the 0% Tolerance category, these items are not compared individually to their corresponding section in the HUD-1. Instead, all items in the category are aggregated on the GFE and compared to the aggregated corresponding items on the HUD-1. In the event that the HUD-1 has a total more than 10% higher than the total on the GFE, the lender is responsible for any expense in excess of the 10% increase. This means that individual items in the 10% Tolerance category may increase more than 10% from the GFE to the HUD-1 without a penalty to the lender, as long as the sum of all the items does not increase more than 10%.

::c. No Tolerance. A few sections of the new GFE fall into the No Tolerance category. These quotes can change with no penalty to the lender.

Again, depending on the state, region, and vendor, homeowners can save substantial money by shopping around for title insurance except in some states, such as Texas, in which the rates are codified by law. In light of the changes made by RESPA and those to the GFE, notable consumer and business publications have featured articles about the benefits of shopping around for title insurance, such as The Wall Street Journal, Kiplinger's Personal Finance, Forbes.com, and The New York Times.

== Affiliated business arrangements ==

Sometimes, several businesses that offer settlement services are owned or controlled by a common corporate parent. These businesses are known as "affiliates", while the relationship is called an affiliated business arrangement (ABA).

When a lender, real estate broker, or other participant refers his homebuyer to an affiliate for a settlement service (such as when a real estate broker refers his homebuyer to a mortgage broker affiliate), the law requires the referring party to provide an affiliated business arrangement disclosure. This disclosure informs homebuyers they are not required to use the affiliate and are free to shop for other providers.

Despite advances in technology that allow homebuyers to shop for title services, many homebuyers remain unaware that they may select their own title insurance or settlement company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federaltitle.com/blog/affliliated-business-arrangements-bad-business|title=Affliliated business arrangements = Bad business|author=Todd Ewing|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323140811/http://www.federaltitle.com/blog/affliliated-business-arrangements-bad-business|archivedate=March 23, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent survey from the Ohio Association of Independent Title Agents (OAITA), conducted from 2009 through 2010, showed when homebuyers are made fully aware of ABAs, they become uncomfortable and prefer a title company or title agent to be a third party (i.e., independent) to the transaction.

While 77% of respondents did not independently select their settlement company, when made fully aware of the ABA relationships 50% of respondents said they prefer a title company that does not share profits with a referral source compared to 6% of respondents saying they prefer a title agent that shares profits with a referral source. Further, 58% of respondents said they believe that ABAs are a conflict of interest.

The OAITA stands in stark contrast to two Harris Interactive surveys used by the Real Estate Services Providers Council in a January 2011 meeting with Federal Reserve staff to claim that homebuyers were more satisfied with the ABA settlement service providers.

* A 2002 study used by the proponents revealed that 64% of homebuyers who used "one-stop shopping" programs had a better overall experience with their home purchase transaction.
* A 2008 study revealed that homebuyers who used "one-stop shopping" in their latest real estate transaction were more satisfied with their home buying experience compared to those who used services of multiple providers.

Organizations such as the National Association of Independent Land Title Agents seek to restore transparency and credibility to the land title process and to preserve an objective and impartial role at the closing table to improve the consumer experience, by addressing the proliferation of controlled business arrangements and eliminating conflicts of interest between title agents and their referral sources, as well as between all real estate settlement service providers and their sources of business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nailta.org/ |title=NAILTA |publisher=National Association of Independent Land Title Agents |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027063834/http://www.nailta.org/ |archivedate=October 27, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cost of title insurance==
The cost of title insurance has two components: premium charges and service fees.

Title insurance premium rates are based on five cost considerations, including those related to:

# Maintaining current title information on property local to that operation, i.e., title plant
# Searching and examining the title to subject properties
# Resolving or clearing defects to title
# Covering title defects
# Allowing for a reasonable profit

===Premium charges===
Like the rates for other forms of insurance, rates for title insurance usually are regulated by state governments to ensure that premiums are not excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory to the public. States have different methods of regulating title insurance rates. The types of rate regulation used include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Russo|first=Michael|title=financial analyst|url=http://www.alta.org/images/PDF/10-12-15_AM_Best_Report.pdf|publisher=AM Best|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505141732/http://www.alta.org/images/PDF/10-12-15_AM_Best_Report.pdf|archivedate=May 5, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Promulgation:''' State regulatory body sets the rates. An example is Texas, where rates are set after comprehensive hearings each year.
* '''Prior approval:''' Insurers propose rates, which must be reviewed formally and approved explicitly or deemed approved by the regulatory body before they can be charged.
* '''File and use:''' Insurers set rates, but they cannot be charged until the regulator has been notified and allowed time to review and action, if necessary. In some prior-approval states, almost the same result is achieved through a so-called deemer provision. Under a deemer, rates proposed by insurers are deemed approved if the regulatory body takes no action to disapprove a filing within a specified time, and the filer notifies the state that the rates are being deemed approved.
* '''Use and file:''' Insurers set rates that can be charged immediately, as long as the new rate schedule is filed with the regulatory body.
* '''No direct rate regulation:''' Insurers set rates that can be changed at an insurer's discretion. Even in this apparent unregulated situation, a regulatory body still is charged with overseeing the title insurance industry and can question the propriety of a rate that appears to be unfairly discriminatory or otherwise violates statutory standards. Examples are Illinois, Georgia and Massachusetts.

The rates may include discounts if title insurance is ordered within a specified time after the last policy issued or if the mortgage being insured is a refinance of an earlier mortgage. In the states employing any of these regulations, it is illegal for title insurance companies to charge a higher or lower rate than the regulated rate.

For example: In Pennsylvania there are two rates, basic rate and reissue rate. The basic rate would apply if it has been more than ten years since the last policy was issued. If less than ten years, the reissue rate applies. The reissue rate offers a discount of approximately ten percent off of the basic rate. If the transaction is a refinance, the savings can be as much as thirty percent off of the reissue rate. These rates and applicable discounts are filed with and approved by the Pennsylvania Insurance Commission.

Title insurance is substantially different from other lines of insurance because it emphasizes risk prevention rather than risk assumption. This means the majority of the premium dollar, about 80 percent, covers the work performed by title professionals, such as the search examination, curative work, policy issuance and, frequently, the settlement or closing. The remaining 20 percent covers the insurance policy, a significant portion of which is put into reserves for claims that could occur 10 or 20 years in the future. According to a 2006 survey by ALTA,&lt;ref&gt;American Land Title Association&lt;/ref&gt; title problems that required curative action were found in 36 percent of all residential real estate transactions in 2005. This was up from 25 percent in 2000, due to the booming real estate market and an increase in transactions.

===Service fees===
In some states, the regulated premium charge does not include part of the underwriting costs necessary for the process. In those states, title insurers may also charge search or abstracting fees for searching the public records, or examination fees to compensate them for the title examination. These fees are usually not regulated and in those cases may sometimes be negotiated. In some states, regulation requires that the title insurer base its policy on the opinion of an attorney. The attorney's fees are not regulated. They are also not part of the title insurance premium, though the title insurer may include those fees within its invoice as a convenience to the attorney rendering the opinion. Similarly, fees for closing a sale or mortgage transaction are not regulated in most states though the charge for closing may appear in the invoice disclosing the total charges for the transaction.

==Industry profitability==
{{Refimprove|date=August 2011}}
The title industry is highly dependent on real estate markets, which, in turn, are highly sensitive to mortgage interest rates and the overall economic well-being. During the housing bubble from 2000 through 2006, the industry's revenue more than doubled. As the surge in real estate transactions drove up title insurance revenue—along with a greater incidence of claims—the economic downturn that started in 2007 pared back revenue significantly for several years.&lt;ref&gt;AM Best Special Report December 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; To compare, the industry reported nearly $17&amp;nbsp;billion in title insurance premiums in 2005, but volume fell to $9.6&amp;nbsp;billion in 2009.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;American Land Title Association Industry Financial Data&lt;/ref&gt;
  
In 2012, according to ALTA, the industry paid out about $908&amp;nbsp;million in claims, about 8.1% percent of the $11.2&amp;nbsp;billion taken in as premiums.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; By comparison, the [[boiler insurance]] industry, which like title insurance requires an emphasis on inspections and risk analysis, pays 25% of its premiums in claims.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} As mentioned above, professionals in the land title industry seek to prevent claims through up-front preventive measures before a policy is issued and therefore the industry's claims ratio is different from other lines of insurance.

It should be noted that according to the statutory accounting rules for title insurance, only reported claims are reflected in the loss expense, while in other lines—both reported and unreported claims are included in the loss expense. As a result, timing differences occur in the reporting of losses and loss-adjustment expenses for title insurance when compared to other lines.&lt;ref&gt;AM Best Special Report&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, title insurance, unlike most other property/casualty exposures, has no termination date and no time limitation on filing claims.

In many states, the price of title insurance is regulated by a state insurance commission. In these states, the title insurance companies lobby state legislators and other politicians and donate to their campaigns, in the hopes of maintaining the rates high &lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2006/1113/148.html#2c1ed3c65266&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.curbed.com/2018/2/26/17017142/title-insurance-scam-government-takeover&lt;/ref&gt;. Unlike other forms of insurance (such as life, medical, or home owners), title insurance is not paid for annually, as it has one payment for the term of the policy, which is in effect until the property is resold or refinanced.

==Relative market share among U.S. title insurers==
The following discloses the relative 2012 market shares among the four U.S. national families of title insurers (Fidelity National Financial, First American, Stewart, and Old Republic), and the regional companies, i.e., those not affiliated with the national families.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1049">'''Trass''' is the local name of a [[volcanic]] [[tuff]] occurring in the [[Eifel]], where it is worked for hydraulic [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]]. It is a grey or cream-coloured fragmental rock, largely composed of [[pumice]]ous dust, and may be regarded as a [[Trachyte|trachytic]] tuff. It much resembles the [[Italy|Italian]] [[pozzolana]] and is applied to like purposes. Mixed with [[Lime (mineral)|lime]] and [[sand]], or with [[Portland cement]], it is extensively employed for hydraulic work, especially in the [[Netherlands]]; while the compact varieties have been used as a building material and as a fire-stone in ovens. Trass was formerly worked extensively in the [[Brohlbach (Rhine)|Brohl]] valley and is now obtained from the valley of the [[Nette (Middle Rhine)|Nette]], near [[Andernach]].

The '''Travel Promotion, Enhancement, and Modernization Act of 2014''' ({{USBill|113|hr|4450}}) was a bill that would have extended the provisions of the [[Travel Promotion Act of 2009]] ({{USPL|111|145}}), which established the Corporation for Travel Promotion (also known as [[Travel Promotion Act of 2009#Brand USA|Brand USA]]), through September 30, 2020, and imposed new performance and procurement requirements on the corporation.&lt;ref name="cbo4450"/&gt; The bill also would have extended the authority of [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] (CBP) to collect travel promotion fees from certain foreign individuals traveling to the United States. Those fees were to be used to partially fund Brand USA.&lt;ref name="cbo4450"/&gt;

The bill was introduced and passed in the [[United States House of Representatives]], but was not passed in the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. It expired at the conclusion of the [[113th United States Congress]].

==Background==
The [[Travel Promotion Act of 2009]] ({{USPL|111|145}}) created the Corporation for Travel Promotion (also known as Brand USA), a [[public-private partnership]] tasked with promoting tourism in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="ASTAsupport"/&gt; To fund the Corporation's activities, the Act provides for a fee of $10 for use of the [[Electronic System for Travel Authorization]] (ESTA). The goal of the organization is to increase international travel to the United States.&lt;ref name="ASTAsupport"/&gt; Prior to 2010, the United States was "the only major travel destination worldwide that did not have a national travel and tourism marketing organization."&lt;ref name="USTravelsupport"/&gt;

==Provisions of the bill==
''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Research Service]], a [[public domain]] source.''&lt;ref name=4450sum&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 4450 - Summary|url=https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4450|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Travel Promotion, Enhancement, and Modernization Act of 2014 would amend the [[Travel Promotion Act of 2009]] (TPA) to revise qualifications requirements for members of the Board of Directors of the [[Corporation for Travel Promotion]].&lt;ref name="4450sum"/&gt;

The bill would revise requirements for the Corporation's annual report to the [[United States Secretary of Commerce]] (Secretary) to require a description of and rationales for: (1) the Corporation's efforts to focus on specific countries and populations, and (2) its combination of media channels employed in meeting the promotional objectives of its marketing campaign.&lt;ref name="4450sum"/&gt;

The bill would direct the Corporation and the Secretary (or their designees) to meet biannually to review procedures to determine the [[fair market value]] of goods and services received by the Corporation from non-federal sources. Reduces from 80% to 75% the percentage of the fair market value of those goods and services the Corporation may receive from non-federal sources each fiscal year, increasing from 20% to 25% the federal matching rate.&lt;ref name="4450sum"/&gt;

The bill would include U.S. territories among the states and the [[District of Columbia]] whose benefit the Corporation's international travel promotion plan must ensure.&lt;ref name="4450sum"/&gt;

The bill would extend the TPA and the Corporation through FY2020.&lt;ref name="4450sum"/&gt;

The bill would amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to extend through FY2020 also the authority of the [[United States Secretary of Homeland Security]] (DHS) to charge a fee for use of the electronic travel authorization system to determine, in advance, an alien's eligibility to travel to the United States.&lt;ref name="4450sum"/&gt;

The bill would amend the TPA to require the Corporation to establish performance metrics to: (1) measure the impact of its marketing efforts, and (2) demonstrate any cost or benefit to the U.S. economy.&lt;ref name="4450sum"/&gt;

The bill would require the Corporation to report to Congress actions it has taken in response to any recommendations the [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) might make to it.&lt;ref name="4450sum"/&gt;

The bill would require the Corporation to: (1) establish a competitive [[procurement]] process, and (2) certify in its annual report to Congress that any contracts it has entered into were in compliance with that process.&lt;ref name="4450sum"/&gt;

==Congressional Budget Office report==
''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Budget Office]], as ordered reported by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on July 15, 2014. This is a [[public domain]] source.''&lt;ref name=cbo4450&gt;{{cite web|title=CBO - H.R. 4450|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45562|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

H.R. 4450 would extend the provisions of the [[Travel Promotion Act of 2009]] ({{USPL|111|145}}), which established the Corporation for Travel Promotion (also known as [[Travel Promotion Act of 2009#Brand USA|Brand USA]]), through September 30, 2020, and impose new performance and procurement requirements on the corporation. The bill also would extend the authority of [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] (CBP) to collect travel promotion fees from certain foreign individuals traveling to the United States. Those fees are used to partially fund Brand USA.&lt;ref name="cbo4450"/&gt;

The [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO) estimates that enacting H.R. 4450 would increase direct spending by $500 million and revenues by $731 million over the 2015-2024 period, resulting in a net decrease in the deficit of $231 million over the 10-year period. [[PAYGO|Pay-as-you-go]] procedures apply because enacting the legislation would affect direct spending and revenues. CBO estimates that implementing H.R. 4450 would not significantly affect discretionary spending.&lt;ref name="cbo4450"/&gt;

H.R. 4450 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the [[Unfunded Mandates Reform Act]] and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal governments.&lt;ref name="cbo4450"/&gt;

==Procedural history==
The Travel Promotion, Enhancement, and Modernization Act of 2014 was introduced into the [[United States House of Representatives]] on April 10, 2014 by [[Gus Bilirakis|Rep. Gus M. Bilirakis (R, FL-12)]].&lt;ref name=4450allactions&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 4450|url=https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4450/all-actions|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was referred to the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce]], the [[United States House Committee on Homeland Security]], the [[United States House Energy Subcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing and Trade]], the [[United States House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Border and Maritime Security]]. On July 15, 2014, it was ordered reported (amended) alongside [https://beta.congress.gov/congressional-report/113th-congress/house-report/542 House Report 113-542 part 1] by the House Energy and Commerce Committee.&lt;ref name="4450allactions"/&gt; On July 22, 2014, the House voted in [http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll433.xml Roll Call Vote 433] to pass the bill 347-57.

==Debate and discussion==
The [[American Society of Travel Agents]] (ASTA) supported the bill.&lt;ref name=ASTAsupport&gt;{{cite web|title=ASTA Applauds Introduction of the Travel Promotion, Enhancement, and Modernization Act of 2014|url=http://www.asta.org/News/PRdetail.cfm?ItemNumber=11396&amp;navItemNumber=539|publisher=American Society of Travel Agents|accessdate=23 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ASTA President [[Zane Kerby]] said that the bill "is essential to marketing the United States as a desirable destination for international tourists, conferences and business."&lt;ref name="ASTAsupport"/&gt;

The [[U.S. Travel Association]] also supported the bill.&lt;ref name=USTravelsupport&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Travel Hails Bipartisan Move To Extend Brand USA|url=http://www.blackmeetingsandtourism.com/News-Center/Business-Exclusives/Industry-Briefs/2014/U-S-Travel-Hails-Bipartisan-Move-To-Extend-Brand.aspx|publisher=Black Meetings and Tourism|accessdate=23 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study of the program by [[Oxford Economics]] indicated that the program "generates an estimated $47 in economic benefits for every $1 spent on travel promotion."&lt;ref name="USTravelsupport"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4218">The '''Treaty of Fontainebleau''' was a secret agreement of 1762 in which [[France]] ceded [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]] to [[Spain]]. The treaty followed the last battle in the [[French and Indian War]] in North America, the [[Battle of Signal Hill]] in September 1762, which confirmed British control of [[Canada (New France)|Canada]]. In Europe, the associated [[Seven Years' War]] continued to rage. Having lost Canada, King [[Louis XV of France]] proposed to King [[Charles III of Spain]] that France should give Spain "the country known as Louisiana, as well as [[New Orleans]] and the island in which the city is situated."&lt;ref&gt;Herbermann, Charles. [http://oce.catholic.com/oce/browse-page-scans.php?p=6efd901d98073ee914841875f552f09c&amp;o=g 'Louisiana']{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} ''The Catholic Encyclopedia: An International Work of Reference on the Constitution, Doctrine, Discipline, and History of the Catholic Church''. Encyclopedia Press, 1913, p. 380 (Original from Harvard University).&lt;/ref&gt; Charles accepted on November 13, 1762.

This agreement covered all of Louisiana: the entire valley of the [[Mississippi River]], from the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachians]] to the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]]. The Treaty of Fontainebleau was kept secret even during the French negotiation and signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]], which ended the war with Britain.

The Treaty of Paris, made between France and Great Britain following the Seven Years' War, divided Louisiana at the Mississippi. The eastern half was ceded to Britain, and the western half and New Orleans were nominally retained by France. Spain did not contest Britain's control of eastern Louisiana, as it already knew that it would rule in western Louisiana. Also, under the Treaty of Paris, Spain had ceded [[Florida]] to Britain for which western Louisiana was its compensation.

The Treaty of Paris provided a period of 18 months in which French colonists who did not want to live under British rule could freely emigrate to other French colonies. Many of the emigrants moved to Louisiana, where they discovered later that France had ceded Louisiana to Spain.

The cession to Spain was finally revealed in 1764. In a letter dated April 21, 1764, Louis informed the governor, [[Jean-Jacques Blaise d'Abbadie]], of the transition:

:''Hoping, moreover, that His Catholic Majesty will be pleased to give his subjects of Louisiana the marks of protection and good will which only the misfortunes of war have prevented from being more effectual.''

The colonists in western Louisiana did not accept the transition and expelled the first Spanish governor in the [[Rebellion of 1768]].  [[Alejandro O'Reilly]], an [[Irish people|Irish émigré]], suppressed the rebellion and formally raised the Spanish flag in 1769.

The acquisition of Louisiana consolidated the Spanish Empire in [[North America]]. When Great Britain returned Florida to Spain [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|in 1783]], after the [[American Revolutionary War]], Spanish territory completely encircled the Gulf of Mexico and stretched from Florida west to the Pacific Ocean, and north to Canada west of the Mississippi River.

The '''United Nations Buffer Zone in Cyprus''' is a [[demilitarized zone]], patrolled by the [[United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus]] (UNFICYP), that was established in 1964 and extended in 1974 after the cease fire of {{Date|August 16 1974}}, following the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]], and the ''de facto'' partition of the island into the area controlled by the [[Cyprus|Republic of Cyprus]] (southern Cyprus save for the British [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia|Sovereign Base Areas]]) and the [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] in the North. The zone, also known as the '''Green Line''' ({{Lang-el|Πράσινη Γραμμή}}, ''Prasini Grammi''; {{Lang-tr|Yeşil Hat}}), stretches for {{convert|180|km|mi|abbr=off|0}} from [[Paralimni]] in the east to [[Kato Pyrgos]] in the west, where a separate section surrounds [[Kokkina]]. The zone cuts through the centre of [[Nicosia]], separating the city into southern and northern sections. In total, it spans an area of {{convert|346|km2|sqmi}}, varying in width from less than 20 metres to more than 7 kilometres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNFICYP Background|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/unficyp/background.shtml|website=UN.org|publisher=UN Peacekeeping|accessdate=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Buffer Zone|url=http://unficyp.unmissions.org/about-buffer-zone|website=unficyp.unmissions.org|publisher=United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus|accessdate=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Konyalian|first1=Claudia|title=Biodiversity in Cyprus 346 square kilometres Buffer Zone|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/presscenter/articles/2010/05/27/biodiversity-in-cyprus-346-square-kilometres-buffer-zone.html|website=undp.org|publisher=United Nations Development Programme|accessdate=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The line is also referred to as the '''Attila Line''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095433488 Oxford References: ''Attila Line'']&lt;/ref&gt; named after the Turkish code-name for the 1974 military intervention: [[Operation Atilla]]. Turkish forces built a barrier on the zone's northern side, consisting mainly of barbed-wire fencing, concrete wall segments, watchtowers, anti-tank ditches, and minefields.

Some 10,000 people live in several villages and work on farms located within the zone; the village of [[Pyla]] is famous for being one of the few remaining villages in Cyprus where Greek and Turkish Cypriots still live side by side. Other villages are [[Deneia]], [[Athienou]] and [[Troulloi]]. Some areas are untouched by human interference and have remained a safe haven for flora and fauna.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Green Line near Paphos Gate.JPG|thumb|View from the north at Uray sk, next to the Turkish Public Market]]
A buffer zone in Cyprus was first established in 1964, when Major-General [[Peter Young (British Army officer)|Peter Young]] was the commander of the British peace force (a predecessor of the present UN force) set up in the wake of the inter-communal violence of the early 1960s. After stationing his troops in different areas of Nicosia, the general drew a cease-fire line on a map with a green [[chinagraph]] pencil, which was to become known as the "Green Line".&lt;ref&gt;Jon Calame and Esther Charlesworth, ''Divided Cities: Belfast, Beirut, Jerusalem, Mostar, and Nicosia'' (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2011) p133&lt;/ref&gt;  It later transpired that the map General Young was using had been borrowed from Major Bill Garbutt of the 14th/20th King's Hussars, whose clerk, Lance Corporal Arnie Greenwood, had marked the cease fire line on the map with the only coloured writing instrument that he had, which happened to be green.

The Green Line became impassable following the July 1974 [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]] during which Turkey captured approximately 37% of Cypriot territory, in response to a short-lived [[Greek Cypriot]] coup. A "security zone" was established after the Tripartite Conference of [[Geneva]] in July 1974. Pursuant to [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 353]] (1974),&lt;ref name="S/RES/353"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.cy/mfa/mfa2006.nsf/All/E286914EF8A39CFEC22571B50037925A/$file/Resolution%20353%20_1974_.pdf|title=UNSC Resolution 353 (1974)|publisher=United Nations|format=PDF|date=20 July 1974|accessdate=4 July 2012|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6BjQm51fa?url=http://www.mfa.gov.cy/mfa/mfa2006.nsf/All/E286914EF8A39CFEC22571B50037925A/%24file/Resolution%20353%20_1974_.pdf|archive-date=27 October 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the foreign ministers of Greece, Turkey, and the United Kingdom convened in Geneva, Switzerland, on 25 July 1974. According to UNFICYP, the text of the joint declaration transmitted to the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] was as follows:

{{quote|A security zone of a size to be determined by representatives of Greece, Turkey, and the United Kingdom, in consultation with UNFICYP, was to be established at the limit of the areas occupied by the Turkish armed forces. This zone was to be entered by no forces other than those of UNFICYP, which was to supervise the prohibition of entry. Pending the determination of the size and character of the security zone, the existing area between the two forces was not to be breached by any forces.|Tripartite Conference &amp; Geneva Declaration|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unficyp.org/nqcontent.cfm?a_id=1603&amp;tt=graphic&amp;lang=L1|title=Tripartite Conference &amp; Geneva Declaration|publisher=United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus|accessdate=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The UN Security Council then adopted the above declaration with [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 355|Resolution 355]]. When the coup dissolved, the [[Turkish Armed Forces]] advanced to capture approximately 37% of the island and met the "Green Line". The [[meander]]ing Buffer Zone marks the southernmost points that the Turkish troops occupied during the [[Turkish Invasion of Cyprus]] in August 1974, running between the [[Ceasefire|cease fire lines]] of the [[Cypriot National Guard]] and Turkish army that ''de facto'' divides Cyprus into two, cutting through the capital of [[Nicosia]]. With the [[Declaration of Independence of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus|self-proclamation]] of the internationally unrecognized "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus", the Buffer Zone became its de facto southern border.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Traffic across the buffer zone was very limited until 2003, when the number of crossings and the rules governing them were relaxed.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Crossings==
[[File:Chypre-LigneVerte1.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Ledra Street]], once cut by the Green Line in Nicosia.]]
After a nearly 30-year ban on crossings, the Turkish Cypriot administration significantly eased travel restrictions across the dividing line in April 2003, allowing Greek Cypriots to cross at the [[Ledra Palace|Ledra Palace Crossing]] just outside the walls of old Nicosia. This was only made possible after the decision of the [[European Court of Human Rights|ECHR]] (''Djavit An vs Turkey'', Application No.20652/92).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Zaim|last=Necatigil|title=Kıbrıs uyuşmazlığı ve Avrupa İnsan Hakları Mahkemesi kıskacında Türkiye: Avrupa İnsan Hakları Komisyonu ve Mahkemesi'nde Kıbrıs Rum yönetimi ve Kıbrıslı Rumlar tarafından Türkiye aleyhine getirilen davalar|trans-title=The Cyprus Conflict and Turkey in the grip of ECHR: Cases brought against Turkey by the Greek Cypriot Administration and the Greek Cypriots before the European Commission of Human Rights and the European Court of Human Rights|language=Turkish|location=Ankara|year=2005|page=190|isbn=9789756194348|publisher=Turhan Kitabevi|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/K%C4%B1br%C4%B1s_uyu%C5%9Fmazl%C4%B1%C4%9F%C4%B1_ve_Avrupa_%C4%B0nsa.html?id=wQMmAQAAIAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Cypriot accession to the [[European Union]], there were restrictions on Green Line crossings by foreigners imposed by the Republic of Cyprus, but these were abolished for EU citizens by [[Regulation (European Union)|EU regulation]] 866/2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.delcyp.cec.eu.int/en/news/tcmeasures/greenline.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204005525/http://www.delcyp.cec.eu.int/en/news/tcmeasures/greenline.pdf|type=PDF|archivedate=4 February 2007 |date=17 February 2005|title=Consolidated version of the Green Line Regulation including amendments|publisher=[[Council of the European Union]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, citizens of any country are permitted to cross the line, including Greek and Turkish Cypriots.

In August 1996, Greek Cypriot refugees demonstrated with a march against the [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus|Turkish occupation]] of Cyprus. The demonstrators' demand was the complete withdrawal of Turkish troops and the return of [[Cypriot refugees]] to their homes and properties. Among the demonstrators was [[Tassos Isaac]] who was beaten to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hri.org/news/greek/ant1en/1996/96-08-13.ant1en.html|title=Antenna News in English 130896|author=|date=|website=www.hri.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aged 26, Solomou was one of many mourners who entered the Buffer Zone three days after Isaac's funeral, on 14 August to lay a wreath on the spot where he had been beaten to death. Solomou was fired upon by Turkish soldiers when he was climbing to a flagpole to remove the flag of Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jerrold|last=Kessel|title=Cyprus conflict comes to a boil, U.N., U.S. fault Turkey for Greek Cypriot deaths|date=15 August 1996|url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9608/15/cyprus/index.html|publisher=CNN|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070327183822/http://www.cnn.com/world/9608/15/cyprus/index.html|archivedate=27 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; An investigation by authorities of the Republic of Cyprus followed, and the suspects were named as Kenan Akin and Erdan Emanet.

During the demonstrations on 14 August 1996, two British soldiers were also shot by the Turkish forces: Neil Emery and Jeffrey Hudson, both from 39th Regiment Royal Artillery. Bombardier Emery was shot in his arm, whilst Gunner Hudson was shot in the leg by a high velocity rifle round and was airlifted to hospital in Nicosia then on to [[RAF Akrotiri]].

==Activism==
The buffer zone between the checkpoints that divide Ledra Street was used as a space for activism from 15 October 2011 up until June 2012 by the [[Occupy Buffer Zone]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stream.aljazeera.com/story/cypriots-occupybufferzone-0021865 |title=Cypriots #OccupyBufferZone |work=The Stream |publisher=AlJazeera |accessdate=4 July 2012 |date=15 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130408031105/http://stream.aljazeera.com/story/cypriots-occupybufferzone-0021865 |archivedate=8 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
