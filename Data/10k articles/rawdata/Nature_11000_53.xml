'''{{mp|(416151) 2002 RQ|25}}''' is a carbonaceous [[asteroid]] of the [[List of Apollo asteroids|Apollo]] group, classified as [[near-Earth object]] and [[potentially hazardous asteroid]], approximately 0.2 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 3 September 2002, by the [[Campo Imperatore Near-Earth Object Survey]] (CINEOS) at the Italian [[Campo Imperatore]] Observatory, located in the Abruzzo region, east of Rome.&lt;ref name="MPC-416151" /&gt;

== Orbit and classification ==

{{mp|2002 RQ|25}} orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.8–1.5&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] once every 1 years and 2 months (428 days). Its orbit has an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.31 and an [[orbital inclination|inclination]] of 5[[Degree (angle)|°]] with respect to the [[ecliptic]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;

The asteroid's [[minimum orbit intersection distance]] with Earth is {{convert |0.0499 |AU |km |abbr=on |sigfig=3}}, which is currently exactly at the threshold limit of 0.05&amp;nbsp;AU (or about 19.5 [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|lunar distances]]) to make it a [[potentially hazardous object]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;

== Physical characteristics ==

The carbonaceous [[C-type asteroid]] is also classified as a C/[[X-type asteroid|X-type]] body according to the survey carried out by NASA's [[Spitzer Space Telescope]].&lt;ref name="Thomas-2014" /&gt;

== Lightcurve ==

A rotational [[lightcurve]] of {{mp|2002 RQ|25}} was obtained from [[Photometry (astronomy)|photometric]] observations made by American astronomer [[Brian D. Warner|Brian Warner]] at his Palmer Divide Observatory, Colorado, in February 2015. The ambiguous lightcurve rendered a [[rotation period]] of {{val|12.191|0.005}} hours with a brightness variation of 0.72 [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] ({{small|[[LCDB quality code|U=2+]]}}), while a second solution gave 6.096 hours (or half of the first period) with an amplitude of 0.43.&lt;ref name="Warner-2015n" /&gt;

The ''Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link'' assumes a standard [[astronomical albedo|albedo]] for stony asteroids of 0.20 and calculates diameter of 225 meters with an [[absolute magnitude]] of 20.6.&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt;

== Naming ==

As of 2017, this [[minor planet]] remains unnamed.&lt;ref name="MPC-416151" /&gt;

'''{{mp|2014 DX|110}}''' is a sub-kilometer [[asteroid]], classified as [[near-Earth object]] of the [[Apollo asteroids|Apollo group]], approximately 30 meters in diameter. It passed less than 1 [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|lunar distance]] from Earth on 5 March 2014.&lt;ref name=jpl-close/&gt; With an [[Absolute magnitude#Solar System bodies (H)|absolute magnitude]] of 25.7, this asteroid is potentially the largest asteroid to come [[List of asteroid close approaches to Earth in 2013|inside the orbit of the Moon]] since {{mpl|2013 PJ|10}} on 4 August 2013. The close approach was webcast live by [[Slooh]] and Virtual Telescope.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fox" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WRD-20140305" /&gt;

== Description ==
[[File:2014DX110-pia17955-640.jpg|thumb|left|Orbital diagram: close approach of {{mp|2014 DX|110}} on 5 March 2014]]

{{mp|2014 DX|110}} came to [[Opposition (planets)|opposition]] (furthest [[Elongation (astronomy)|elongation]] in the sky from the Sun) on 15 February 2014, but the asteroid had a very faint [[apparent magnitude]] of about 23 and was only 10 degrees from the [[full moon]].&lt;ref name="NEODyS2014"/&gt; The asteroid was discovered on 28 February 2014 by [[Pan-STARRS]] at an apparent magnitude of 20 using a {{convert |1.8 |m |in |adj=on |sp=us}} [[Ritchey–Chrétien telescope]].&lt;ref name="MPEC2014-E22"/&gt;

On 5 March 2014 at 21:00&amp;nbsp;[[Universal Time|UT]] the asteroid passed {{convert |0.00232 |AU |km mi |abbr=on |lk=on}} from Earth&lt;ref name=jpl-close/&gt; and reached about apparent magnitude 15.&lt;ref name="NEODyS2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Remanzacco"/&gt; At 22:22&amp;nbsp;UT it passed {{convert |0.00249 |AU |km mi |abbr=on |lk=off}} from the Moon.&lt;ref name=jpl-close/&gt; By 6 March 2014 18:00&amp;nbsp;UT, the asteroid was less than 30 degrees from the Sun and dimming significantly.&lt;ref name="NEODyS2014"/&gt;

It has an observation arc of 5 days with an [[Uncertainty Parameter U|uncertainty parameter]] of 6.&lt;ref name=jpldata/&gt; It was removed from the JPL [[Sentry (monitoring system)|Sentry Risk Table]] on 5 March 2014 using JPL solution 3 with an observation arc of 5 days.&lt;ref name="removed"/&gt; When the asteroid only had an observation arc of 4 days, virtual clones of the asteroid that fit the uncertainty region in the known trajectory showed a 1 in 10 million chance that the asteroid could [[Impact event|impact]] Earth on 4 March 2046.&lt;ref name="summary"/&gt; With a 2046 [[Palermo Technical Scale]] of −7.11,&lt;ref name=summary/&gt; the odds of impact by {{mp|2014 DX|110}} in 2046 were about 13 million times less&lt;ref name=math/&gt; than the background hazard level of Earth impacts which is defined as the average risk posed by objects of the same size or larger over the years until the date of the potential impact.&lt;ref name="palermo"/&gt; Using the [[Curve fitting|nominal]] orbit, [[NEODyS]] shows that the asteroid will be {{convert |2.8 |AU |km mi |abbr=on |lk=off}} from Earth on 4 March 2046.&lt;ref name="NEODyS2046"/&gt;

==Etymology==

The genus name ''Acmella'' is derived from a Greek word ''akme'' meaning "(the highest) point, edge or peak of anything."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=acme (n.)|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=acme|website=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=Douglas Harper|accessdate=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The species name ''nana'' was derived from a Latin word ''nanus'' meaning "dwarf", and was chosen because of its small size.&lt;ref name=geg/&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Vermeulen et al 2015 Fig 5a,b Acmella nana.png|left|thumb|Shell of ''Acmella nana''.]]
''Acmella nana'' has a [[gastropod shell|shell]], which is whitish in colour and has a shiny appearance. The shell is translucent and measures 0.50 to 0.60&amp;nbsp;mm in width, and 0.60 to 0.79&amp;nbsp;mm in height.&lt;ref name=osb&gt;{{cite news|last1=Osborne|first1=Hannah|title=Acmella nana: World's tiniest land snails discovered in Borneo measuring just 0.7mm in diameter|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/acmella-nana-worlds-tiniest-land-snails-discovered-borneo-measuring-just-0-7mm-diameter-1526849|accessdate=9 November 2015|work=International Business Times|publisher=IBTimes Co., Ltd.|date=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In average the size is 0.7&amp;nbsp;mm. Due to its size, it cannot be directly noticed by naked eye, and can be seen clearly under microscope.&lt;ref name=geg/&gt; It has 2 to 3 [[whorl (mollusc)|whorls]], and the [[aperture (mollusc)|aperture]] opening is 0.26-0.30&amp;nbsp;mm wide and 0.30-0.37&amp;nbsp;mm high.

==Discovery==

''Acmella nana'' was discovered from [[limestone]] hills in Borneo. Knowing that limestone and snail shells are both composed of [[calcium carbonate]], the research team led by two Dutch biologists Jaap J. Vermeulen and Menno Schilthuizen, and a Malaysian biologist Thor-Seng Liew collected soil and litter and dirt from the cliffs. Then they separated the larger particles from the smaller ones using sieves. They put the larger particles in a bucket of water and stirred them.&lt;ref name=geg/&gt; The minerals such as clay and sand settled at the bottom, while the shells, being buoyant, float up on the surface. This is because, although the shells are chemically same as the minerals, their internal cavities contain air pockets.&lt;ref name=main&gt;{{cite news|last1=Main|first1=Douglas|title=Researchers Discover 48 New Snail Species, Including World's Smallest|url=http://www.newsweek.com/researchers-discover-worlds-small-snail-again-389875|accessdate=9 November 2015|work=Newsweek|date=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shells were then examined under microscope. The taxonomic description was published in the 2 November 2015 issue of ''[[ZooKeys]]'', and the paper also included a report of other 47 new species of snails. Schilthuizen remarked, saying, "Our paper was in review when that paper on ''Angustopila dominikae'' came out and it was only then that we realized that one of 'our' species was actually smaller."&lt;ref name=sankar/&gt; The main specimen (holotype) was collected by Vermeulen from the [[Niah National Park|Niah Caves]] in [[Sarawak]], Malaysia. Other specimens were from [[Sabah]].&lt;ref name=verm/&gt;

==Biology==

Since the specimens are only the shells, and not living snails, it is not possible to know details of the biology. But a closely related species ''[[Acmella polita]]'' is known in the same area. This snail eats thin films of bacteria and fungi growing on the limestone walls inside the caves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Meet the tiniest snail in the world|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/scitech/report-meet-the-tiniest-snail-in-the-world-2142187|accessdate=9 November 2015|work=dna|date=5 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers speculated that ''Acmella nana'' does the same. The presence of an opening called [[Operculum (gastropod)|operculum]] on the shell suggests that it may also possess [[gill]]s. Gills would be the respiratory organs for their wet environment. Such gills are known in aquatic snails.&lt;ref name=main/&gt; It is also assumed that the species is distributed in other parts of Borneo, and that their survival is not a serious threat. However, according to Schilthuizen, they can become threatened due to heavy quarrying in these limestone hills.&lt;ref name=geg/&gt;

The '''Atlantic dry forests''' are a [[tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|tropical dry forest]] [[ecoregion]] of the [[Atlantic Forest]] [[Biome]], located in eastern [[Brazil]].

==Setting==
The Atlantic dry forests cover an area of {{convert|115,100|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}, lying between the [[Cerrado]] savannas of central Brazil and the [[Caatinga]] dry shrublands of northeastern Brazil. The Atlantic dry forests stretch from northern [[Minas Gerais]] state across western [[Bahia]] state into central [[Piauí]]. The Atlantic dry forests generally lie along the upper [[São Francisco River]] of Minas Gerais and Bahia, and in the basin of the [[Gurguéia River]] in Piauí. A large enclave of Atlantic dry forest lies on the [[Chapada Diamantina]] of east-central Bahia.

==Flora==
The Atlantic dry forests are dense, with deciduous and semi-deciduous trees reaching up to 25 to 30 meters in height. The Barriguda Tree, ''[[Cavanillesia arborea]]'', is a dry forest tree species distinguished by its huge, bottle-shaped trunk which reaches up to 1.5 meters in diameter.

'''''Blue Latitudes: Boldly Going Where Captain Cook Has Gone Before''''' (United States), or '''''Into the Blue: Boldly Going Where Captain Cook Has Gone Before''''' (Australia), is a [[Travel literature|travel book]] by [[Tony Horwitz]], published in 2002.

In it, the [[Pulitzer Prize]]–winning journalist travels to various parts of the world, following in the footsteps of explorer [[James Cook]]. The book compares the current conditions of the places Cook visited to what Cook documented at the time, and describes the different legacies Cook has left behind.&lt;ref name=Harris&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harris|first1=Robert R|title=Cook's Tour|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/22/books/cook-s-tour.html|accessdate=20 September 2014|agency=The New York Times|date=September 22, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horowitz begins with his experience as a volunteer deckhand on the [[HM Bark Endeavour Replica|replica of HM Bark ''Endeavour'']]. Some of the places Horowitz visits in his travels include Australia, the small island nation of [[Niue]], the [[Society Islands]], [[Tonga]], New Zealand, the birthplace and home of Cook in [[North Yorkshire]] England, [[Alaska]], and [[Hawaii]].

The '''Bogotá savanna''' is a [[savanna#Savanna ecoregions|montane savanna]], located in the southwestern part of the [[Altiplano Cundiboyacense]] in the center of [[Colombia]]. The Bogotá savanna has an extent of {{convert|4251.6|km2|sqmi}} and an average altitude of {{convert|2550|m|ft}}. The savanna is situated in the [[Cordillera Oriental (Colombia)|Eastern Ranges]] of the Colombian [[Andes]].

The Bogotá savanna is crossed from northeast to southwest by the {{convert|375|km|mi}} long [[Bogotá River]], which at the southwestern edge of the plateau forms the [[Tequendama Falls]] (''Salto del Tequendama''). Other rivers, such as the [[Subachoque River|Subachoque]], [[Bojacá River|Bojacá]], [[Fucha River|Fucha]], [[Soacha River|Soacha]] and [[Tunjuelo River]]s, tributaries of the Bogotá River, form smaller valleys with very fertile soils dedicated to agriculture and cattle-breeding.

Before the [[Spanish conquest of the Muisca|Spanish conquest]] of the Bogotá savanna, the area was inhabited by the indigenous [[Muisca people|Muisca]], who formed a loose confederation of various ''[[cacique]]s'', named the [[Muisca Confederation]]. The Bogotá savanna, known as ''Bacatá'', was ruled by the ''[[zipa]]''. The people specialised in [[Muisca agriculture|agriculture]], the mining of [[Colombian emeralds|emeralds]], [[Muisca economy#Trade|trade]] and especially the extraction of [[halite|rock salt]] from rocks in [[Zipaquirá]], [[Nemocón]], [[Tausa]] and other areas on the Bogotá savanna. The salt extraction, a task exclusively of the [[Women in Muisca society|Muisca women]], gave the Muisca the name "The Salt People". 

In April 1536, a group of around 800 [[List of conquistadors in Colombia|conquistadors]] left the relative safety of the Caribbean coastal city of [[Santa Marta]] to start a strenuous expedition up the [[Magdalena River]], the main fluvial artery of Colombia. Word got around among the Spanish colonisers that deep in the unknown Andes, a rich area with an advanced civilisation must exist. These tales bore the -not so much- legend of ''[[El Dorado]]''; the city or man of gold. The Muisca, skilled [[Muisca art#Goldworking|goldworkers]], held a ritual in [[Lake Guatavita]] where the new ''zipa'' would cover himself in gold dust and jump from a [[Muisca raft|raft]] into the cold waters of the {{convert|3000|m|ft}} high lake to the northeast of the Bogotá savanna.

After a journey of almost a year, where the Spanish lost over 80% of their soldiers, the conquistadors following the [[Suárez River]], reached the Bogotá savanna in March 1537. The ''zipa'' who ruled the Bogotá savanna at the arrival of the Spanish was [[Tisquesusa]]. The Muisca posed little resistance to the Spanish strangers and Tisquesusa was defeated in April 1537 in [[Funza]], in the centre of the savanna. He fled towards the western hills and died of his wounds in [[Facatativá]], on the southwestern edge of the Bogotá savanna. The Spanish conquistador [[Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada]] established the [[New Kingdom of Granada]] with capital Santa Fe de Bogotá on August 6, 1538. This started a process of colonisation, evangelisation and submittance of the Muisca to the new rule. Between 65 and 80% of the indigenous people perished due to European diseases as [[smallpox]] and [[typhus]]. The Spanish introduced new crops, replacing many of the [[New World crops]] that the Muisca cultivated.

Over the course of the 16th to early 20th century, the Bogotá savanna was sparsely populated and industrialised. The rise in population during the twentieth century and the expansion of agriculture and urbanisation reduced the biodiversity and natural habitat of the Bogotá savanna severely. Today, the [[Metropolitan Area of Bogotá]] on the Bogotá savanna hosts more than ten million people. Bogotá is the biggest city worldwide at altitudes above {{convert|2500|m|ft}}. The many rivers on the savanna are highly contaminated and efforts to solve the environmental problems are conducted in the 21st century.

== Etymology ==
The Bogotá savanna is named after Bogotá, which is derived from [[Chibcha language|Muysccubun]] ''Bacatá'', which means "(Enclosure) outside of the farm fields".&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://www.banrepcultural.org/node/32531 Etymology Bacatá] - Banco de la República&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Altiplano Cundiboyacense}}
The Bogotá savanna is the southwestern part of the larger Andean plateau, the Altiplano Cundiboyacense. The savanna is a [[Savanna#Savanna ecoregions|montane savanna]], bordered to the east by the [[Eastern Hills, Bogotá|Eastern Hills]], the [[Sumapaz Páramo|Sumapaz mountains]] in the south, the hills of [[Tausa]] and [[Suesca]] in the north and western hills of Cundinamarca in the west. The total surface area is {{convert|4251.6|km2|sqmi}}.&lt;ref name=Preciado_p2&gt;Pérez Preciado, 2000, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Climate ===
The average temperature of the plateau is {{convert|14|C|F}}, but this can fluctuate between {{convert|0|and|24|C|F}}. The dry and rainy seasons alternate frequently during the year. The driest months are December, January, February and March. During the rainy months, the temperature tends to be more stable with variations between {{convert|9|and|20|C|F}}. June, July and August are the months that present the largest variations of temperature, and during the morning frost in the higher terrains surrounding the savanna is possible. Sometimes also ground frost is present, which has a negative impact on agriculture. Hail is a relatively common phenomenon on the savanna.&lt;ref name="Climate-Data.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate: Bogotá - Climate graph, Temperature graph, Climate table|url=http://en.climate-data.org/location/5115/|publisher=Climate-Data.org|accessdate=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SUNNY AND FOGGY DAYS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=22208&amp;refer=&amp;cityname=Bogota-Distrito-Especial-Colombia&amp;units=us |title=Weatherbase: Historical Weather for Bogota, Colombia |publisher=Weatherbase |accessdate=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a system of [[wetland]]s (''humedales'') that regulate the soil moisture acting like sponges for the rain waters. Fifteen wetlands have a protected status, with various wetlands as unprotected. In 1950, the total surface area of the wetlands amounted to {{convert|150000|ha|acre}}, but due to the urbanisation of the Colombian capital the total area has been reduced to {{convert|1500|ha|acre}}.&lt;ref name=Humedales_p2&gt;Moreno et al., s.a., p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biodiversity ==
{{see also|Biodiversity of Colombia}}
Despite the continuous urbanisation and industrial activities, the Bogotá savanna is a rich biodiverse area with many bird species registered.&lt;ref name=Tadeo_p95&gt;Calvachi Zambrano, 2002, p.95&lt;/ref&gt; The diversity of mammals, amphibians and reptiles is much lower.&lt;ref name=Tadeo_p97&gt;Calvachi Zambrano, 2002, p.97&lt;/ref&gt; Before the arrival of the European colonisers, the savanna was populated predominantly by [[white-tailed deer]], the main ingredient of the [[Muisca cuisine]]. Today, this species of deer, as well as the once common [[spectacled bear]], is restricted to protected areas surrounding the Bogotá savanna. The [[Thomas van der Hammen Natural Reserve]] is a [[list of national parks of Colombia|protected area]] in the north of Bogotá.

{{see also|Muisca Confederation#Prehistory|Herrera Period|Timeline of Bogotá}}
The earliest confirmed inhabitation of present-day Colombia was on the Bogotá savanna with [[List of Muisca and pre-Muisca sites|sites]] [[El Abra]], [[Tequendama]] and [[Tibitó]], where semi-nomadic [[hunter-gatherer]]s lived in caves and rock shelters. One of the first evidences of settlement in open area space was [[Aguazuque]], whose oldest dated remains are analysed to be 5000 years old. This prehistorical [[Andean preceramic|preceramic]] period was followed by the [[Herrera Period]], commonly defined from 800 BCE to 800 AD.

=== Muisca Confederation ===
{{main|Muisca Confederation}}
At the arrival of the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] [[List of conquistadors in Colombia|conquistadors]], the region was inhabited by the [[Muisca people|Muisca]] who lived in hundreds of small villages scattered across the plateau. These villages were individually ruled by ''[[cacique]]s'' who at the same time paid tribute to the ''[[zipa]]'', ruler of Bacatá. The Muisca were known as "The Salt People", thanks to their extraction of [[halite|rock salt]] from brines in large pots heated over fires. This process was the exclusive task of the [[Women in Muisca society|Muisca women]].

The [[Muisca economy|economy]] of the Muisca, meaning "person" or "people" in their indigenous version of [[Chibchan languages|Chibcha]]; [[Chibcha language|Muysccubun]], was self-sufficient due to the advanced [[Muisca agriculture|agriculture]] on the fertile soils of the frequently flooding Bogotá savanna. More tropical and subtropical agricultural products as [[avocado]]es and [[cotton]] were [[Muisca economy#Trade|traded]] with their neighbours, in particular the [[Guane people|Guane]] and [[Lache people|Lache]] in the north and northeast and the [[Guayupe people|Guayupe]], [[Achagua people|Achagua]] and [[Tegua people|Tegua]] in the east.

The Muisca were known as skilled [[Muisca art#Goldworking|goldworkers]], represented in the famous [[Muisca raft]], that symbolises the initiation ritual of the new ''zipa'' in [[Lake Guatavita]]. This ritual, where the ''zipa'' covered himself in gold dust and jumped in the {{convert|3000|m|ft}} altitude lake, gave rise to the -not so much- legend of ''[[El Dorado]]''.

=== Spanish conquest ===

{{main|Spanish conquest of the Muisca}}
In April 1536, a group of around 800 [[List of conquistadors in Colombia|conquistadors]] left the relative safety of the Caribbean coastal city of [[Santa Marta]] to start a strenuous expedition up the [[Magdalena River]], the main fluvial artery of Colombia. Word got around among the Spanish colonisers that deep in the unknown Andes, a rich area with an advanced civilisation must exist. These tales bore the -not so much- legend of ''[[El Dorado]]''; the city or man of gold. The Muisca, skilled [[Muisca art#Goldworking|goldworkers]], held a ritual in [[Lake Guatavita]] where the new ''zipa'' would cover himself in gold dust and jump from a [[Muisca raft|raft]] into the cold waters of the {{convert|3000|m|ft}} high lake to the northeast of the Bogotá savanna.

After a journey of almost a year, where the Spanish lost over 80% of their soldiers, the conquistadors following the [[Suárez River]], reached the Bogotá savanna in March 1537. The ''zipa'' who ruled the Bogotá savanna at the arrival of the Spanish was [[Tisquesusa]]. The Muisca posed little resistance to the Spanish strangers and Tisquesusa was defeated in April 1537 in [[Funza]], in the centre of the savanna. He fled towards the western hills and died of his wounds in [[Facatativá]], on the southwestern edge of the Bogotá savanna. The Spanish conquistador [[Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada]] established the [[New Kingdom of Granada]] with capital Santa Fe de Bogotá on August 6, 1538. This started a process of colonisation, evangelisation and submittance of the Muisca to the new rule. Between 65 and 80% of the indigenous people perished due to European diseases as [[smallpox]] and [[typhus]]. The Spanish introduced new crops, replacing many of the [[New World crops]] that the Muisca cultivated.

The Spanish colonizers engaged in the construction of Spanish-style towns to replace all the indigenous villages and in the process of assimilation and religious convert of the Muisca. The majority of those villages kept their indigenous names, but some were slightly modified in time, like ''Suacha'' which became [[Soacha]], ''Hyntiba'' becoming [[Fontibón]] and ''Bacatá'' becoming [[Bogotá]].

=== Modern history ===
{{see also|New Kingdom of Granada|Gran Colombia|History of Bogotá}}
Over the course of the 16th to early 20th century, the Bogotá savanna was sparsely populated and industrialised. The rise in population during the twentieth century and the expansion of agriculture and urbanisation reduced the biodiversity and natural habitat of the Bogotá savanna severely. Today, the [[Metropolitan Area of Bogotá]] on the Bogotá savanna hosts more than ten million people. Bogotá is the biggest city worldwide at altitudes above {{convert|2500|m|ft}}. The many rivers on the savanna are highly contaminated and efforts to solve the environmental problems are conducted in the 21st century.

'''Cernunnos''' is the conventional name given in [[Celtic studies]] to depictions of the "[[Horned deity|horned god]]" of [[Celtic polytheism]]. Cernunnos was a Celtic god of fertility, life, animals, wealth, and the underworld. The name itself is only attested once, on the 1st-century [[Pillar of the Boatmen]], but he appears all over Gaul, and among the [[Celtiberians]]. Cernunnos is depicted with the antlers of a stag, sometimes carries a purse filled with coin, often seated cross-legged and often associated with animals and holding or wearing [[torc]]s, are known from over 50 examples in the [[Gallo-Roman]] period, mostly in north-eastern [[Gaul]].&lt;ref&gt;Green, Miranda, ''Celtic Art, Reading the Messages'', p. 147, 1996, The Everyman Art Library, {{ISBN|0-297-83365-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not much is known about the god from literary sources, and details about his name, his followers or his significance in Celtic religion are unknown. Speculative interpretations identify him as a god of nature, life or fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Green |first=Miranda |title=Animals in Celtic Life and Myth |pages=227–8 |year=1992 |publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
[[File:Cernunnos.jpg|thumb|Cernunnos on the [[Pillar of the Boatmen]], from the [[Musée national du Moyen Âge]] (Museum of the Middle Ages), in [[Paris]], [[France]]]]
The theonym ''[C]ernunnos'' appears on the [[Pillar of the Boatmen]], a [[Gallo-Roman]] monument dating to the early 1st century CE, to label a god depicted with stag's antlers in their early stage of annual growth.&lt;ref name="A. Kingsley Porter 1934 p. 227"&gt;A. Kingsley Porter, "A Sculpture at Tandragee," ''Burlington Magazine'' 65 (1934), p. 227, pointing out the relative maturation of the antlers.&lt;/ref&gt; Both antlers have [[torc]]s hanging from them.&lt;ref name="Maier"/&gt;

The name has been compared to a divine epithet ''Carnonos'' in a Celtic inscription written in [[Greek alphabet|Greek characters]] at [[Montagnac, Hérault|Montagnac]], [[Hérault]] (as καρνονου, ''karnonou'', in the [[dative case]]).&lt;ref&gt;Xavier Delamarre, ''Dictionnaire de la langue gauloise'' (Éditions Errance, 2003), pp. 106–107.&lt;/ref&gt;
A [[Vulgar Latin|Gallo-Latin]] [[adjective]] ''carnuātus'', "horned," is also found.&lt;ref&gt;Equivalent to Latin ''cornutus'', "horned"; Delamarre, citing J. Vendryes, ''Revue Celtique'' 42 (1925) 221–222.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Proto-Celtic]] form of the theonym is reconstructed as either *''Cerno-on-os''{{dubious|date=October 2010}} or *''Carno-on-os''. The [[augmentative]] ''-on-'' is characteristic of theonyms, as in [[Maponos]], [[Epona]], [[Matronae]], and [[Sirona]].&lt;ref&gt;Delamarre, citing M. Lejeune, ''Lepontica'' (Paris 1971), p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt;
Maier (2010) states that the etymology of ''Cernunnos'' is unknown, as the Celtic word for "horn" has an ''a'' (as in ''Carnonos'').&lt;ref name="Maier"&gt;Bernard Maier, ''Dictionary of Celtic Religion and Culture'' (Alfred Kröner, 1994; Boydell, 2000), p. 69 [https://books.google.com/books?id=7AvdTqwucfwC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=%22the+etymology+of+whose+name+is+unclear%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2E3ETPjlFcWOnwfrmpHZCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20etymology%20of%20whose%20name%20is%20unclear%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaulish ''karnon'' "horn"is cognate with Latin ''cornu'' and Germanic ''*hurnaz'', English ''[[:wikt:horn|horn]]'', ultimately from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''{{PIE|[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/ḱerh₂-|*k̑r̥no-]]}}''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pokorny (1959)]] "k̑er-, k̑erə-; k̑rā-, k̑erei-, k̑ereu"[http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/ielex/X/P0929.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
The etymon ''karn-'' "horn" appears in both [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]] and [[Galatian language|Galatian]] branches of [[Continental Celtic]]. [[Hesychius of Alexandria]] glosses the Galatian word ''karnon'' (κάρνον) as "Gallic trumpet", that is, the Celtic military horn listed as the [[carnyx]] (κάρνυξ) by [[Eustathius of Thessalonica]], who notes the instrument's animal-shaped bell.&lt;ref&gt;Delamarre; Greek text and English translation of the passage from Eustathius' [[Homeric epics|Homeric]] [[commentary (philology)|commentaries]] given by Edward Wigan, "Account of a Collection of Roman Gold Coins," ''Numismatic Chronicle'' 5 (1865), p. 11 [https://books.google.com/books?id=0VwUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=carnyx+Eustathius&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=yEPDTMPmA4SfnAf__a3UCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=carnyx%20Eustathius&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; The root also appears in the names of [[List of Celtic tribes|Celtic polities]], most prominent among them the [[Carnutes]], meaning something like "the Horned Ones,"&lt;ref&gt;Also ''[[Carni]]'' and ''[[Carnonacae]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and in several [[personal name]]s found in inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;Such as ''Carnarus, Carnatus, Carneolus, Carnius'' and ''Carnicus''; Altay Coşkun with Jürgen Zeidler, "'Cover Names' and Nomenclature in Late Roman Gaul: The Evidence of the Bordelaise Poet Ausonius" (2003), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epigraphic evidence==
The name ''Cernunnos'' occurs only on the "[[Pillar of the Boatmen]]" (''Pilier des nautes''),&lt;ref&gt;Koch, ''Celtic Culture'', p. 396 [https://books.google.com/books?id=f899xH_quaMC&amp;pg=PA396&amp;dq=Cernunnos+inauthor:Koch&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Cj7ETMaaO8yRnwfE6dz1CQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Cernunnos%20inauthor%3AKoch&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; now displayed in the [[Musée National du Moyen Age]] in [[Paris]]. Constructed by Gaulish sailors probably in 14 CE,&lt;ref&gt;Based on the inscription (''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' XIII. 03026), on the accession of the [[Roman emperors|emperor]] [[Tiberius]].&lt;/ref&gt; it was discovered in 1710 within the foundations of the [[Notre-Dame de Paris|cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris]], site of ancient [[Lutetia]], the ''[[civitas]]'' [[Capital (political)|capital]] of the [[Celts|Celtic]] [[Parisii (France)|Parisii]]. The distinctive stone pillar is an important monument of [[Gallo-Roman religion]]. Its [[low relief]]s depict and label by name several [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman deities]] such as [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]], and [[Castor (mythology)|Castor]] and [[Pollux (mythology)|Pollux]], along with Gallic deities such as [[Esus]], [[Smertrios]], and [[Tarvos Trigaranus]]. The name ''Cernunnos'' can be read clearly on 18th century drawings of the inscriptions, but the initial letter has been obscured since, so that today only a reading ''[_]ernunnos'' can be verified&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis Fray Bober, ''Cernunnos: Origin and Transformation of a Celtic Divinity'',
American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 55, No. 1 (Jan., 1951), pp. 13-51
https://www.jstor.org/stable/501179&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional evidence is given by one inscription on a metal plaque from [[Steinsel-Rëlent]] in [[Luxembourg]], in the territory of the Celtic [[Treveri]]. This inscription&lt;ref&gt;AE 1987, 0772 = AE 1989, 00542.&lt;/ref&gt; read ''Deo Ceruninco'', "to the God Cerunincos", assumed to be the same deity.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} The Gaulish inscription from Montagnac&lt;ref&gt;RIG 1, number G-224.&lt;/ref&gt; reads αλλετ[ει]νος καρνονου αλ[ι]σο[ντ]εας (''Alletinos [dedicated this] to Carnonos of Alisontea''), with the last word possibly a place name based on ''Alisia'', "[[sorbus|service-tree]]" or "rock" (compare [[Alesia (city)|Alesia]], Gaulish ''Alisiia'').&lt;ref&gt;Delamarre, ''Dictionnaire'' pp. 38–39. See also Pierre-Yves Lambert, ''La langue gauloise'' (Éditions Errance, 2003), pp. 53 and 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

The god labelled ''[C]ernunnos'' on the [[Pillar of the Boatmen]] is depicted with stag's antlers in their early stage of annual growth.&lt;ref name="A. Kingsley Porter 1934 p. 227"/&gt; Both antlers have [[torc]]s hanging from them. The lower part of the relief is lost, but the dimensions suggest that the god was sitting cross-legged, providing a direct parallel to the antlered figure on the [[Gundestrup cauldron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=m8-IAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA89&amp;lpg=PA89&amp;dq=Iconography+of+cernunnos&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cdGUAv4ULV&amp;sig=t8z9lPDOnE_mBKq_-mUyEjkcNJE&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Iconography%20of%20cernunnos%20Gundestrup%20cauldron&amp;f=false|title=Symbol and Image in Celtic Religious Art|last=Green|first=Miranda|date=2003-10-03|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134893942|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of the name ''Cernunnos'' being attested nowhere else, it is commonly used in Celtological literature as describing all comparable depictions of horned/antlered deities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=f899xH_quaMC&amp;pg=PA396&amp;lpg=PA396&amp;dq=Iconography+of+cernunnos&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=p1RDghDrVJ&amp;sig=fwnvbv0_tjE5JR3O_T585-CZ5E8&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Iconography%20of%20cernunnos&amp;f=false|title=Celtic culture: a historical encyclopedia. Vol. 1-|last=Koch|first=John T.|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781851094400|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This "Cernunnos" type in Celtic iconography is often portrayed with animals, in particular the [[stag]], and also frequently associated with the [[ram-horned serpent]], and less frequently [[bull]]s (at [[Rheims]]), [[dog]]s and [[rat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=VZkTDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT148&amp;lpg=PT148&amp;dq=Iconography+of+cernunnos&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=q7gAWelmuO&amp;sig=lTZD6Mf12dZDVA0ZQtpVcAhNol4&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Iconography%20of%20cernunnos&amp;f=false|title=Gods of the Celts|last=Green|first=Miranda|date=2011-09-30|publisher=The History Press|isbn=9780752468112|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of his frequent association with creatures, scholars often describe Cernunnos as the "[[Lord of the Animals]]" or the "Lord of Wild Things", and Miranda Green describes him as a "peaceful god of nature and fruitfulness".&lt;ref&gt;Green, Miranda (1992) ''Animals in Celtic Life and Myth'', p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Pilier des nautes'' links him with sailors and with commerce, suggesting that he was also associated with material wealth as does the coin pouch from the Cernunnos of Rheims (Marne, Champagne, France)—in antiquity, Durocortorum, the ''civitas'' capital of the [[Remi]] tribe—and the stag vomiting coins from Niedercorn-Turbelslach (Luxembourg) in the lands of the [[Treveri]]. The god may have symbolized the fecundity of the [[Red Deer#Distribution and habitat|stag-inhabited forest]].

Other examples of "Cernunnos" images include a [[petroglyph]] in [[Val Camonica]] in [[Cisalpine Gaul]]. The antlered human figure has been dated as early as the 7th century BCE or as late as the 4th.&lt;ref&gt;Webster, "Creolizing the Roman Provinces," p. 221, especially note 103.&lt;/ref&gt; An antlered child appears on a relief from [[Vendeuvres]], flanked by serpents and holding a purse and a torc.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Ross, "Chain Symbolism in Pagan Celtic Religion," ''Speculum'' 34 (1959), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; The best known image appears on the [[Gundestrup cauldron]] found on [[Jutland]], dating to the 1st century BCE, thought to depict Celtic subject matter though usually regarded as of Thracian workmanship.

Among the [[Celtiberians]], horned or antlered figures of the Cernunnos type include a "[[Janus]]-like" god from [[Candelario]] ([[Salamanca]]) with two faces and two small horns; a horned god from the hills of [[Ríotinto]] ([[Huelva]]); and a possible representation of the deity Vestius Aloniecus near his altars in [[Lourizán]] ([[Pontevedra]]). The horns are taken to represent "aggressive power, genetic vigor and fecundity."&lt;ref&gt;Francisco Marco Simón, "Religion and Religious Practices of the Ancient Celts of the Iberian Peninsula," ''e-Keltoi: Journal of Interdisciplinary Celtic Studies'' 6 (2005), p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt;

Divine representations of the Cernunnos type are exceptions to the often-expressed view that the Celts only began to picture their gods in human form after the [[Gallic Wars|Roman conquest of Gaul]].&lt;ref&gt;Webster, "Creolizing the Roman Provinces," p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Celtic "horned god", while well attested in iconography, cannot be identified in description of Celtic religion in [[Roman ethnography]] and does not appear to have been given any ''[[interpretatio romana]]'', perhaps due to being too distinctive to be translatable into the Roman pantheon.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Webster, "Creolizing the Roman Provinces," ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 105 (2001), p. 222; distinctiveness of Cernunnos also in William Van Andringa, "Religions and the Integration of Cities in the Empire in the Second Century AD: The Creation of a Common Religious Language," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), pp. 87–88.&lt;/ref&gt;
While Cernunnos was never assimilated, scholars have sometimes compared him functionally to Greek and Roman divine figures such as [[Mercury (god)|Mercury]],&lt;ref&gt;David M. Robinson and Elizabeth Pierce Belgen, "Archaeological Notes and Discussions," ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 41 (1937), p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Actaeon]], specialized forms of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], and [[Dis Pater]], the latter of whom [[Julius Caesar]] said was considered the ancestor of the Gauls.&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis Fray Bober, "Cernunnos: Origin and Transformation of a Celtic Divinity," ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 55 (1951), p. 15ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible reflexes in Insular Celtic==
There have been attempts to find the ''cern'' root in the name of [[Conall Cernach]], the foster brother of the Irish hero [[Cuchulainn]]&lt;ref&gt;Porter, ''A Sculpture at Tandragee'', p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Ulster Cycle]]. In this line of interpretation, ''Cernach'' is taken as an epithet with a wide semantic field—"angular; victorious; bearing a prominent growth"—and Conall is seen as "the same figure" as the ancient Cernunnos.&lt;ref&gt;John Koch. (2006) Cernunnos [in] ''Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia'', p. 396. ABC-Clio.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is even greater evidence available to connect Conall Cernach to Cernunnos than the similarity in the names. A brief passage involving Conall in an eighth-century story entitled ''Táin Bó Fraích'' ("The Cattle Raid on Fraech") has been questioned before for its anti-climatic conclusion to an epic Celtic tale.&lt;ref name="Anne Ross 1967"&gt;Anne Ross. (1967, 1996). ''Pagan Celtic Britain: Studies in Iconography and Tradition''. Academy Chicago Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; In this passage Conall Cernach is portrayed as a hero and mighty warrior who assists the protagonist Fraech in rescuing his wife and son, and in reclaiming for Fraech his cattle. The fort that Conall must penetrate is guarded by a mighty serpent. The supposed anti-climax of this tale is when the fearsome serpent, instead of attacking Conall, darts to Conall's waist and girdles him as a belt. Rather than killing the serpent, Conall allows it to live, and then proceeds to attack and rob the fort of its great treasures the serpent previously protected.

Cernunnos, as the conjectured Gaulish manifestation of the Roman [[Dis Pater]],&lt;ref name="Anne Ross 1967"/&gt; is considered to share the latter's attributes of ruling over the hidden treasures of the underworld. Subterranean treasures were commonly linked in Medieval Bestiaries to the serpent,&lt;ref&gt;Charbonneau-Lassay, Louis. (1940). ''The Bestiary of Christ''. France: Desclée, De Brouwer, &amp; Cie.&lt;/ref&gt; the occupant of the underground, or otherworld, and the keeper of its treasures and mysteries. This aspect of Cernunnos is depicted on a stone statue from a well in Sommerécourt, Haute-Marne, France, and on a bronze figurine from Autun.&lt;ref name="Anne Ross 1967"/&gt; Both statue and figurine portray Cernunnos with the two ram-headed serpents encircling his waist. This is more than just a small similarity to the instance of the serpent that guarded the treasure of the fort in ''Táin Bó Fraích'' surrendering to Conall Cernach and becoming his belt. Cernunno's connections to the deity Mars&lt;ref name="Anne Ross 1967"/&gt; serve to underline Conall's role as hero-warrior in the tale.

The anti-climatic nature of the eighth-century Irish tale then gains significant clarity in the light of the relationship between a horned or antler-bearing deity, warrior, or progenitor, and the [[chthonic]] dwelling, treasure-guarding serpent that encircled the waist of the one it chose to protect. This universal Celtic concept comes down to us as a mere echo of its ancient self through centuries of the [[Christianization of Ireland]]. The Gaelic Cernunnos may now possibly only be found in the slight similarity of a name and the peculiarity of a single passage from a Middle Ages Irish epic.

==Possible connection to Saint Ciarán==
Some see the qualities of Cernunnos subsumed into the ''life'' of [[Ciarán of Saigir|Saint Ciarán of Saighir]], one of the [[Twelve Apostles of Ireland]]. When he was building his first tiny cell, as his [[Hagiography|hagiograph]] goes, his first disciple and monk was a boar that had been rendered gentle by God. This was followed by a fox, a badger, a wolf and a stag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Mac Cana| first = Proinsias| title = Celtic Mythology| origyear = 1970| year = 1973| publisher = The Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited| location = London| isbn = 0-600-00647-6| pages = 47–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neopaganism==
In [[Wicca]] and other forms of [[Neopaganism]] a [[Horned God]] is revered; this divinity syncretises a number of horned or antlered gods from various cultures, including Cernunnos. The Horned God reflects the seasons of the year in an annual cycle of life, death and rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;Farrar, Stewart &amp; Janet, ''Eight Sabbats for Witches''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the tradition of [[Gardnerian Wicca]], the Horned God is sometimes specifically referred to as Cernunnos, or sometimes also as Kernunno.&lt;ref&gt;''The Rebirth of Witchcraft'', Doreen Valiente, page 52-53&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=June 2008}}
In [[astronomy]], the term "'''compact star'''" (or "'''compact object'''") refers collectively to [[white dwarf]]s, [[neutron star]]s, and [[black hole]]s. It would grow to include [[exotic star]]s if such hypothetical dense bodies are confirmed.

Most compact stars are the endpoints of stellar evolution, and thus often referred to as '''stellar remnants''', the form of the remnant depending primarily on the mass of the [[star]] when it [[star formation|formed]]. All of these objects have a high mass relative to their radius, giving them a very high [[density]]. The term ''compact star'' is often used when the exact nature of the star is not known, but evidence suggests that it is very [[mass]]ive and has a small [[radius]], thus implying one of the above-mentioned categories. A compact star that is not a black hole may be called a '''degenerate star'''.

== Formation ==
The usual endpoint of [[stellar evolution]] is the formation of a compact star.

Most stars will eventually come to a point in their evolution when the outward radiation pressure from the nuclear fusions in its interior can no longer resist the ever-present gravitational forces. When this happens, the star collapses under its own weight and undergoes the process of [[stellar death]]. For most stars, this will result in the formation of a very dense and compact stellar remnant, also known as a compact star.

Compact stars have no internal energy production, but will—with the exception of black holes—usually radiate for millions of years with excess heat left from the collapse itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tauris |first1=T. M. |last2=J. van den Heuvel |first2=E. P. |title=Formation and Evolution of Compact Stellar X-ray Sources |journal= |arxiv=|date=20 Mar 2003 |bibcode=2006csxs.book..623T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the most recent understanding, compact stars could also form during the [[Chronology of the universe#Hadron epoch|phase separations]] of the early Universe following the [[Big Bang]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Primordial origins of known compact objects have not been determined with certainty.

==Lifetime==
Although compact stars may radiate, and thus cool off and lose energy, they do not depend on high temperatures to maintain their structure, as ordinary stars do. Barring external disturbances and [[proton decay]], they can persist virtually forever. [[Black holes]] are however generally believed to finally evaporate from [[Hawking radiation]] after trillions of years. According to our current standard models of [[physical cosmology]], all stars will eventually evolve into cool and dark compact stars, by the time the Universe enters the so-called [[heat death of the universe|degenerate era]] in a very distant future.

The somewhat wider definition of ''compact objects'' often includes [[Substellar object|smaller solid objects]] such as [[planet]]s, [[asteroid]]s, and [[comet]]s. There is a remarkable variety of stars and other clumps of hot matter, but all matter in the Universe must eventually end as some form of compact stellar or substellar object, according to the theory of [[thermodynamics]].

==White dwarfs==
[[Image:Ngc2392.jpg|128px|left|thumb|The [[Eskimo Nebula]] is illuminated by the white dwarf at its center.]]
{{main article|White dwarf}}
The stars called [[white dwarf|white or degenerate dwarf]]s are made up mainly of [[degenerate matter]]; typically carbon and oxygen nuclei in a sea of degenerate electrons. White dwarfs arise from the cores of [[main-sequence star]]s and are therefore very hot when they are formed. As they cool they will redden and dim until they eventually become dark [[black dwarf]]s. White dwarfs were observed in the 19th century, but the extremely high densities and pressures they contain were not explained until the 1920s.

The [[equation of state]] for degenerate matter is "soft", meaning that adding more mass will result in a smaller object. Continuing to add mass to what is now a white dwarf, the object shrinks and the central density becomes even larger, with higher degenerate-electron energies. The star's radius has now shrunk to only a few thousand kilometers, and the mass is approaching the theoretical upper limit of the mass of a white dwarf, the [[Chandrasekhar limit]], about 1.4 times the [[mass of the Sun]] ({{Solar mass|link=y}}).

If we were to take matter from the center of our white dwarf and slowly start to compress it, we would first see electrons forced to combine with nuclei, changing their [[proton]]s to [[neutron]]s by [[inverse beta decay]]. The equilibrium would shift towards heavier, neutron-richer nuclei that are not stable at everyday densities. As the density increases, these nuclei become still larger and less well-bound. At a critical density of about 4{{e|14}} kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), called the [[neutron drip line]], the atomic nucleus would tend to fall apart into protons and neutrons. Eventually we would reach a point where the matter is on the order of the density (c. 2{{e|17}}&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) of an atomic nucleus. At this point the matter is chiefly free neutrons, with a small amount of protons and electrons.

==Neutron stars==
&lt;!--
[[Image:V838 Mon HST.jpg|160px|right|thumb|Formerly a white dwarf, [[V838 Monocerotis]] has [[accretion theory|accreted]] enough material to become a [[red supergiant]].]]
--&gt;
[[Image:Chandra-crab.jpg|160px|right|thumb|The [[Crab Nebula]] is a [[supernova remnant]] containing the [[Crab Pulsar]], a [[neutron star]].]]
{{main article|Neutron star}}
In certain [[binary stars]] containing a white dwarf, mass is transferred from the companion star onto the white dwarf, eventually pushing it over the [[Chandrasekhar limit]]. Electrons react with protons to form neutrons and thus no longer supply the necessary pressure to resist gravity, causing the star to collapse. If the center of the star is composed mostly of carbon and oxygen then such a [[gravitational collapse]] will ignite runaway fusion of the carbon and oxygen, resulting in a [[Type Ia supernova]] that entirely blows apart the star before the collapse can become irreversible. If the center is composed mostly of magnesium or heavier elements, the collapse continues.&lt;ref&gt;

|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the density further increases, the remaining electrons react with the protons to form more neutrons. The collapse continues until (at higher density) the neutrons become degenerate. A new equilibrium is possible after the star shrinks by three [[orders of magnitude]], to a radius between 10 and 20&amp;nbsp;km. This is a ''[[neutron star]]''.

Although the first neutron star was not observed until 1967 when the first radio [[pulsar]] was discovered, neutron stars were proposed by Baade and Zwicky in 1933, only one year after the neutron was discovered in 1932. They realized that because neutron stars are so dense, the collapse of an ordinary star to a neutron star would liberate a large amount of gravitational potential energy, providing a possible explanation for [[supernova]]e.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the explanation for supernovae of types [[Type Ib and Ic supernovae|Ib, Ic]], and [[Supernova#Type II|II]]. Such supernovae occur when the iron core of a massive star exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit and collapses to a neutron star.

Like electrons, neutrons are [[fermions]]. They therefore provide [[neutron degeneracy pressure]] to support a neutron star against collapse. In addition, repulsive neutron-neutron interactions{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} provide additional pressure. Like the Chandrasekhar limit for white dwarfs, there is a limiting mass for neutron stars: the [[Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit]], where these forces are no longer sufficient to hold up the star. As the forces in dense hadronic matter are not well understood, this limit is not known exactly but is thought to be between 2 and {{Solar mass|3}}. If more mass accretes onto a neutron star, eventually this mass limit will be reached. What happens next is not completely clear.

==Black holes==
[[Image:Black Hole Milkyway.jpg|200px|right|thumb|A simulated black hole of ten solar masses, at a distance of 600km.]]
{{main article|Black hole|Stellar black hole}}
As more mass is accumulated, equilibrium against gravitational collapse reaches its breaking point. The star's pressure is insufficient to counterbalance gravity and a catastrophic gravitational collapse occurs in milliseconds. The [[escape velocity]] at the surface, already at least 1/3 light speed, quickly reaches the velocity of light. No energy nor matter can escape: a [[black hole]] has formed. All light will be trapped within an [[event horizon]], and so a black hole appears truly [[black]], except for the possibility of [[Hawking radiation]]. It is presumed that the collapse will continue.

In the classical theory of [[general relativity]], a [[gravitational singularity]] occupying no more than a [[point (geometry)|point]] will form. There may be a new halt of the catastrophic gravitational collapse at a size comparable to the [[Planck length]], but at these lengths there is no known theory of gravity to predict what will happen. Adding any extra mass to the black hole will cause the radius of the event horizon to increase linearly with the mass of the central singularity. This will induce certain changes in the properties of the black hole, such as reducing the tidal stress near the event horizon, and reducing the gravitational field strength at the horizon. However, there will not be any further qualitative changes in the structure associated with any mass increase.

==Exotic stars==
{{main article|Exotic star}}
An ''[[exotic star]]'' is a hypothetical compact star composed of something other than [[electron]]s, [[proton]]s, and [[neutron]]s balanced against [[gravitational collapse]] by [[degeneracy pressure]] or other quantum properties.  These include [[strange star]]s (composed of [[strange matter]]) and the more speculative [[preon star]]s (composed of [[preon]]s).

Exotic stars are hypothetical, but observations released by the [[Chandra X-Ray Observatory]] on April 10, 2002 detected two candidate strange stars, designated [[RX J1856.5-3754]] and [[3C58]], which had previously been thought to be neutron stars.  Based on the known laws of physics, the former appeared much smaller and the latter much colder than they should, suggesting that they are composed of material denser than [[neutronium]].  However, these observations are met with skepticism by researchers who say the results were not conclusive.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===Quark stars and strange stars===
{{main article|Quark star}}
If [[neutron]]s are squeezed enough at a high temperature, they will decompose into their component [[quark]]s, forming what is known as a [[quark matter]]. In this case, the star will shrink further and become denser, but instead of a total collapse into a black hole, it is possible, that the star may stabilize itself and survive in this state indefinitely, as long as no extra mass is added. It has, to some extent, become a very large [[nucleon]]. A-type star in this hypothetical state is called a ''[[quark star]]'' or more specifically a ''strange star''. The pulsars [[RX J1856.5-3754]] and [[3C58]] have been suggested as possible quark stars. Most neutron stars are thought to hold a core of quark matter, but it has proven hard to determine observationally.

===Preon stars===
A ''preon star'' is a [[List of hypothetical astronomical objects|proposed]] type of compact star made of [[preon]]s, a group of [[:Category:Hypothetical elementary particles|hypothetical]] [[subatomic particle]]s. Preon stars would be expected to have huge [[density|densities]], exceeding  10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; kilogram per cubic meter – intermediate between quark stars and black holes.
Preon stars could originate from [[supernova]] explosions or the [[Big Bang]]; however, current observations from particle accelerators speak against the existence of preons.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===Q stars===
{{main article|Q star}}
''Q stars'' are hypothetical compact, heavier neutron stars with an exotic state of matter where particle numbers are preserved with radii less than 1.5 times the corresponding Schwarzschild radius. Q stars are also called "gray holes".

===Electroweak stars===
{{main article|Electroweak star}}
An ''electroweak star'' is a theoretical type of [[exotic star]], whereby the gravitational collapse of the star is prevented by [[radiation pressure]] resulting from [[electroweak burning]], that is, the energy released by conversion of [[quark]]s to [[lepton]]s through the [[electroweak force]]. This process occurs in a volume at the star's core approximately the size of an [[apple]], containing about two Earth masses.&lt;ref name="newscientist"&gt;

|accessdate=2010-02-18
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boson star===
A [[boson star]] is a hypothetical [[astronomical object]] that is formed out of particles called [[boson]]s (conventional [[star]]s are formed out of [[fermion]]s). For this type of star to exist, there must be a stable type of boson with repulsive self-interaction. As of 2016 there is no significant evidence that such a star exists. However, it may become possible to detect them by the gravitational radiation emitted by a pair of co-orbiting boson stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Compact relativistic objects and the generalized uncertainty principle==
Based on the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP), proposed by some approaches to quantum gravity such as [[string theory]] and [[doubly special relativity]], the effect of GUP on the thermodynamic properties of compact stars with two different components has been studied, recently.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed Farag Ali and A. Tawfik, [http://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S021827181350020X Int. J. Mod. Phys. D22 (2013) 1350020]&lt;/ref&gt; Tawfik et al. noted that the existence of quantum gravity correction tends to resist the collapse of stars if the GUP parameter is taking values between Planck scale and electroweak scale. Comparing with other approaches, it was found that the radii of compact stars should be smaller and increasing energy decreases the radii of the compact stars.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3838">'''Crude oil washing''' (COW) is washing out the residue from the tanks of an [[oil tanker]] using the [[crude oil]] [[cargo]] itself, after the cargo tanks have been emptied. Crude oil is pumped back and  preheated in the slop tanks, then sprayed back via high pressure [[nozzle]]s in the cargo tanks onto the walls of the tank. Due to the sticky nature of the crude oil, the oil clings  to the tank walls, and such oil adds to the cargo 'remaining on board' (the ROB). By COWing the tanks, the amount of ROB is significantly reduced, and with the current high cost of oil, the financial savings are significant, both for the Charterer and the Shipowner. If the cargo ROB is deemed as 'liquid and pumpable' then the charterers can claim from the owner for any cargo loss  for normally between 0.3% up to 0.5%.  It replaced the ''load on top'' and ''seawater washing'' systems, both of which involved discharging oil-contaminated water into the sea. [[MARPOL]] 73/78 made this mandatory equipment for oil tankers of 20,000 tons or greater deadweight.

Although COWing is most notable for actual tankers, the current chairman for Hashimoto Technical Service, Hashimoto Akiyoshi, applied this method in washing refinery plant oil tanks in [[Japan]]. Hashimoto is currently using this method in the [[Kyushu]], [[Chugoku]], and [[Tohouku]] regions in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;http://www1.ocn.ne.jp/~hts.wak/473/494.html{{dead link|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
__FORCETOC__

==Seawater washing==
Originally oil tankers used one set of tanks for cargo and about one third of the same tanks were for water [[Sailing ballast|ballast]] on their empty trips. High pressure, hot, [[seawater]] jets were used to clean the tanks and the mixture of seawater and residue called ''slops'' discharged into the sea, as was the oil-contaminated ballast water. The 1954 [[OILPOL Convention]] attempted to reduce the harm by prohibiting such discharges within {{convert|50|mi|km}} of most land and {{convert|100|mi|km}} of certain particularly sensitive areas.

==Load on top==
The discharges from seawater washing were still considered a problem and during the 1960s the load on top approach began to be adopted. The mixture of cleaning water and residue was pumped into a ''slop tank'' and allowed to separate by their different densities into oil and water during the journey. The water portion was then discharged, leaving only crude oil in the slop tank. This was pumped into the main tanks and the new cargo loaded on top of it, recovering as much as 800 tons of oil which was formerly discarded.

==History==
Even with load on top there is still some oil in the discharged water from the slop tank. Starting in the 1970s, equipment capable of using crude oil itself for washing began to replace the water-based washing, leading to the current technique of ''crude oil washing''. This reduces the remaining deliberate discharge of oil-contaminated water and increases the amount of cargo discharged, providing a further benefit to the cargo owner.

Crude oil washing equipment became mandatory for new tankers of 20,000 tons or more [[Deadweight tonnage|deadweight]] with the 1978 Protocol to the 1973 [[MARPOL]] Convention. Revised specifications for the equipment were introduced in 1999.

Modern tankers also use segregated [[ballast tanks]] and these remove the problem of discharge of oily ballast water.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14352">'''Economic [[restructuring]]''' refers to the phenomenon of Western [[urban areas]] shifting from a [[manufacturing]] to a [[service sector]] economic base. This transformation has affected demographics including [[income]] distribution, [[employment]], and [[social hierarchy]]; institutional arrangements including the growth of the [[corporate]] complex, specialized producer services, capital mobility, [[informal economy]], nonstandard work, and public outlays; as well as geographic spacing including the rise of [[world cities]], [[spatial mismatch]], and metropolitan growth differentials.&lt;ref&gt;Sassen 1990, Noyelle &amp; Stanback 1984, Logan &amp; Swanstrom 1990, Musterd &amp; Ostendorf 1998, Kalleberg 2000 and Katz 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographic impact==
As cities experience a loss of manufacturing jobs and growth of services, sociologist [[Saskia Sassen]] affirms that a widening of the social hierarchy occurs where high-level, high-income, salaried professional jobs expands in the service industries alongside a greater incidence of low-wage, low-skilled jobs, usually filled by immigrants and minorities.&lt;ref name="Sassen 1990"&gt;Sassen 1990&lt;/ref&gt; A "missing middle" eventually develops in the wage structure.&lt;ref name="Musterd &amp; Ostendorf 1998"&gt;Musterd &amp; Ostendorf 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Several effects of this [[social polarization]] include the increasing concentration of poverty in large U.S. cities, the increasing concentration of black and Hispanic populations in large U.S. cities, and distinct social forms such as the [[underclass]], [[informal economy]], and entrepreneurial immigrant communities.&lt;ref name="Sassen 1990"/&gt; In addition, the declining manufacturing sector leaves behind strained blue-collared workers who endure chronic [[unemployment]], economic insecurity, and [[Economic stagnation|stagnation]] due to the global economy's [[capital flight]].&lt;ref name="Logan &amp; Swanstrom 1990"&gt;Logan &amp; Swanstrom 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Wages and unionization rates for manufacturing jobs also decline. One other qualitative dimension involves the [[Feminisation of the workplace|feminization]] of the job supply as more and more women enter the labor force usually in the service sector.&lt;ref name="Sassen economic restructuring"&gt;{{citation|author= Sassen, Saskia|title=Economic Restructuring and the American City|publisher=Annual Review of Sociology|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both costs and benefits are associated with economic restructuring. Greater efficiency, job creation, [[gentrification]], and enhanced national competitiveness are associated with [[social exclusion]] and inclusion.{{Clarify|date=August 2017}}&lt;ref name="Logan &amp; Swanstrom 1990"/&gt; The low-skilled, low-income population faces the loss of opportunities, full participation in society, lack of access in labor market and school, weak position in housing markets, limited political participation, and restricted social-cultural integration. Conversely, high-skilled, high-income professionals enjoy social inclusion with modern amenities, conveniences, social participation, and full access to public resources.&lt;ref name="Musterd &amp; Ostendorf 1998"/&gt;

Furthermore, sociologist [[William Julius Wilson]] argues that the [[deindustrialization]] of manufacturing employment have exacerbated joblessness in impoverished African American communities correlating with a rise in single-mother households, high premature mortality rates, and increasing [[incarceration]] rates among African American males. With some African Americans gaining professional [[upward mobility]] through [[affirmative action]] and [[equal opportunity]] sanctions in [[education]] and [[employment]], African Americans without such opportunities fall behind. This creates a growing economic class division among the African American demographic accentuated by global economic restructuring without government response to the disadvantaged. Furthermore, Wilson asserts that as the black [[middle class]] leave the predominantly black [[inner city]] neighborhoods, informal employment information networks are eroded. This isolates poor, inner city residents from the labor market compounding the concentration of poverty, [[welfare dependency]], rise of unemployment, and physical isolation in these areas.&lt;ref name="Wilson Declining Race"&gt;{{citation|author= Wilson, William J.|title=The Declining Significance of Race: Blacks and Changing American Institutions|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson Truly Disadvantaged"&gt;{{citation|author= Wilson, William J.|title=The Truly Disadvantaged: the Inner City, the Underclass, and Public Policy|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

City youth are also affected such as in New York City. The declines in education, health care, and social services and the dearth of jobs for those with limited education and training along with the decay of public environments for outdoor play and recreation have all contributed to fewer autonomous outdoor play or "hanging out" places for young people. This in turn affects their gross motor development, cultural build-up, and identity construction. Children become prisoners of home relying on television and other outlets for companionship. Contemporary urban environments restricts the opportunities for children to forge and negotiate peer culture or acquire necessary social skills. Overall, their ecologies have eroded in recent years brought about by global restructuring.&lt;ref name="Katz City Youth"&gt;{{citation|author= Katz, indi|title=Disintegrating Developments: Global Economic Restructuring and the Eroding of Ecologies of Youth|publisher=Routledge|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Institutional arrangements==
When the [[1973 oil crisis]] affected the world capitalist economy, economic restructuring was used to remedy the situation by geographically redistributing production, consumption, and residences.
City economies across the globe moved from goods-producing to service-producing outlets.
Breakthroughs in transportation and communications made industrial capital much more mobile. Soon, producer services emerged as a fourth basic [[economic sector]] where routine low-wage service employment moved to low-cost sites and advanced corporate services centralized in cities.&lt;ref name="Logan &amp; Swanstrom 1990"/&gt; These technological upheavals brought about changes in institutional arrangements with the prominence of large corporations, allied business and financial services, nonprofit and public sector enterprises. [[Global cities]] such as New York and London become centers for international finance and headquarters for [[multinational corporations]] offering cross currency exchange services as well as buildup of foreign banking and trading. Other cities become regional headquarters centers of low-wage manufacturing. In all these urban areas the corporate complex grows offering banking, insurance, advertising, legal council, and other service functions. Economic restructuring allows markets to expand in size and capacity from regional to national to international scopes.&lt;ref name="Noyelle City Transformation"&gt;{{citation|author1=Noyelle, Thierry J.  |author2=Stanback, Thomas M., Jr.|title=The Economic Transformation of American Cities|publisher=Rowman &amp; Allanheld Publishers|year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Altogether, these institutional arrangements buttressed by improved technology reflect the interconnectedness and internationalization of firms and economic processes. Consequently, capital, goods, and people rapidly flow across borders.&lt;ref name="Musterd &amp; Ostendorf 1998"/&gt; Where the mode of regulation began with [[Fordism]] and [[Taylorization]] in the [[industrial age]] then to [[mass consumption]] of [[Keynesian economics]] policies, it evolves to differentiated and specialized consumption through international competition.&lt;ref name="Logan &amp; Swanstrom 1990"/&gt; Additionally, in the labor market, nonstandard work arrangements develop in the form of part-time work, temporary agency and contract company employment, short-term employment, [[contingent work]], and independent contracting. Global economic changes and technological improvements in communications and information systems encouraged competitive organizations to specialize in production easily and assemble temporary workers quickly for specific projects. Thus, the norm of standard, steady employment unravels beginning in the mid-1970s.&lt;ref name="Musterd Urban Segregation"&gt;{{citation|author1=Musterd, Sako  |author2=Ostendorf, Wim|title=Urban Segregation and the Welfare State: Inequality and Exclusion in Western Cities|publisher=Routledge|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kalleberg Nonstandard Work"&gt;{{citation|author= Kalleberg, Arne L.|title=Nonstandard Employment Relations: Part-time, Temporary, and Contract Work|publisher=Annual Review of Sociology|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another shift in institutional arrangement involves public resources. As economic restructuring encourages high-technology service and knowledge-based economies, massive public de-investment results. Across many parts of the U.S. and the industrialized Western nations, steep declines in public outlays occur in housing, schools, social welfare, education, job training, job creation, child care, recreation, and open space. To remedy these cutbacks, [[privatization]] is installed as a suitable measure. Though it leads to some improvements in service production, privatization leads to less public accountability and greater unevenness in the distribution of resources.&lt;ref&gt;Katz 1997&lt;/ref&gt; With this reform in privatizing public services, [[neoliberalism]] has become the ideological platform of economic restructuring. Free market economic theory has dismantled Keynesian and collectivists’ strategies and promoted the [[Reaganomics|Reagan]] and [[Thatcherism|Thatcher]] politics of the 1980s. Soon free trade, flexible labor, and capital flight are used from [[Washington D.C.]] to London to Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;Peck &amp; Tickell 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, economic restructuring requires [[decentralization]] as states hand down power to local governments. Where the federal government focuses on mainly warfare-welfare concerns, local governments focus on productivity. Urban policy reflects this market-oriented shift from once supporting government functions to now endorsing businesses.&lt;ref name="Peck Neoliberalism"&gt;{{citation|author1=Peck, Jamie  |author2=Tickell, Adam|title=The Urbanization of Neoliberalism: Theoretical Debates Neoliberalizing Space|publisher=Antipode|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Logan City Limits"&gt;{{citation|author1=Logan, John R.  |author2=Swanstrom, Todd|title=Beyond City Limits: Urban Policy and Economic Restructuring in Comparative Perspective|publisher=Temple University Press|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographic impact==
Urban landscapes especially in the U.S. have significantly altered in response to economic restructuring. Cities such as Baltimore, Detroit, St. Louis and others face population losses which result in thousands of abandoned homes, unused buildings, and vacant lots, contributing to [[urban decay]]. Such transformations frustrate [[urban planning]] and revitalization, fostering deviance in the forms of drug-related activity and vagrancy.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Older, compact, industrial U.S. cities have been rendered obsolete. Urban spaces become playgrounds for the urban gentry, wastelands for low-paid service workers, and denizens for the [[underground economy]]. In some areas, [[gentrification]] projects have caused displacement of poverty-stricken residents.&lt;ref name="Logan &amp; Swanstrom 1990"/&gt; [[Sunbelt]] cities such as [[Miami]] and [[Atlanta]] rise to become key business centers while Snowbelt cities such as [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and Youngstown decline.&lt;ref name="Noyelle &amp; Stanback 1984"&gt;Noyelle &amp; Stanback 1984&lt;/ref&gt; Even housing markets respond to economic restructuring with decaying housing stocks, escalating housing prices, depleting tax base, changes in financing, and reduction in federal support for housing. Soon, spatial divisions among wealthy and poor households exacerbate.&lt;ref name="Sassen 1990"/&gt; Moreover, with the movement of blue-collared employment from central cities, geographically entrenched housing discrimination, and suburban land use policy, African American youths in inner cities become victims of [[spatial mismatch]], where their residences provide only weak and negative employment growth and they usually lack access to intrametropolitan mobility.&lt;ref&gt;Raphael 1998&lt;/ref&gt; High-order services, an expanding sector in the industrialized world, become spatially concentrated in a relative small number of large metropolitan areas, particularly in suburban office agglomerations.&lt;ref name="Cohen Abandoned Houses"&gt;{{citation|author= Cohen, James R.|title=Abandoned Housing: Exploring Lessons from Baltimore|publisher=Housing Policy Debate|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Raphael Spatial Mismatch"&gt;{{citation|author= Raphael, Steven|title=The Spatial Mismatch Hypothesis and Black Youth Joblessness|publisher=Journal of Urban Economics|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Coffey Intrametropolitan"&gt;{{citation|author1=Coffey, William J. |author2=Drolet, Rejean |author3=Polese, Mario |title=The Intrametropolitan Location of High Order Services|publisher=Papers in Regional Science|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning==
In cultural terms, economic restructuring has been associated with [[postmodernity]] as its counterpart concerning flexible accumulation. Additionally, the term carries with it three core themes: historical, radical rupture into post-industrial economic order; priority of economic forces over social/political forces; and structure over agency where the process is independent of human will, as it takes place according to economic logic (Logan &amp; Swanstrom 1990). In addition, economic restructuring demonstrates the increasing complex and human-capital intensive modern society in Western nations.&lt;ref name="Noyelle &amp; Stanback 1984"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25485">{{short description|The largest contiguous ecosystem on earth and a major circulating system of ocean currents}}
The [[North Pacific Gyre|North Pacific Subtropical Gyre]] (NPSG) is the largest contiguous ecosystem on earth. In [[oceanography]], a [[subtropical gyre]] is a ring-like system of [[ocean current]]s rotating clockwise in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and counterclockwise in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] caused by the [[Coriolis effect|Coriolis Effect]]. They generally form in large open ocean areas that lie between land masses.

The NPSG is the largest of the gyres as well as the largest ecosystem on our planet. Like other subtropical gyres, it has a high-pressure zone in its center. Circulation around the center is clockwise around this high-pressure zone. Subtropical gyres make up 40% of the Earth’s surface and play critical roles in [[carbon fixation]] and nutrient cycling.&lt;ref name=P9&gt;Poretsky, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This particular gyre covers most of the Pacific Ocean and comprises four prevailing ocean currents: the [[North Pacific Current]] to the north, the [[California Current]] to the east, the [[North Equatorial Current]] to the south, and the [[Kuroshio Current]] to the west. Its large size and distance from shore has caused the NPSG to be poorly sampled and thus poorly understood.&lt;ref name=K9&gt;Karl, D. 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:North Pacific Subtropical Convergence Zone.jpg|thumb|300px|The main ocean currents involved with the North Pacific Gyre]]

The life processes in open-ocean ecosystems are a [[Carbon dioxide sink|sink]] for the [[Carbon dioxide#In the Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere’s increasing {{CO2}}]]. Gyres make up a large proportion, approximately 75%, of what we refer to as the open ocean, or the area of the ocean that does not consist of coastal areas. They are considered oligotrophic, or nutrient poor because they are far from terrestrial runoff.&lt;ref name=C7&gt;Corno et al, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; These regions were once thought to be homogenous and static habitats. However, there is increasing evidence that the NPSG exhibits substantial physical, chemical, and biological variability on a variety of time scales.&lt;ref name=K9/&gt; Specifically, the NPSG exhibits seasonal and interannual variations in [[Primary production|primary productivity]] (simply defined as the production of new plant material), which is important for the uptake of {{CO2|link=yes}}.

The NPSG is not only a sink for {{CO2}} in the atmosphere, but also other pollutants. As a direct result of this circular pattern, gyres act like giant whirlpools and become traps for anthropogenic pollutants, such as [[marine debris]]. The NPSG has become recognized for the large quantity of plastic debris floating just below the surface in the center of the gyre. This area has recently received a lot of media attention and is commonly referred to as the [[Great Pacific Garbage Patch]].

== History of discovery ==
The NPSG is not often sampled because of its distance from the coast and its shortage of [[Marine biology|marine life]]. These vast and [[deep ocean]] waters, far from the influence of land, have historically been considered the oceanic equivalent of terrestrial deserts, with low standing stocks of biomass and low production rates. This perspective is derived from a dearth of comprehensive investigation of central gyre habitats. Over the past two decades these views have been challenged with a newfound understanding of the dynamics of the NPSG.&lt;ref name=D8&gt;Dore et al., 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:HMS Challenger (1858).jpg|thumb|[[HMS Challenger (1858)|HMS Challenger]] embarked upon the first global marine research expedition in the 19th century.]]
During the early days of marine exploration, the [[HMS Challenger (1858)|HMS Challenger]] (1872-1876), on its leg from Yokohama to Honolulu, collected plant and animal specimens as well as numerous seawater samples.&lt;ref name=K9/&gt; The goals of this expedition were to determine the [[chemical composition]] of seawater and the [[Organic material|organic matter]] in suspension and to study the distribution and abundance of various communities of organisms. The motivation for studying open ocean ecosystems has changed over time, whereas today more modern studies focus on biodiversity and the effects of climate on ecosystem dynamics. Today, the Hawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT) program has assembled the largest and most comprehensive ecological [[data set]] for the NPSG and is scheduled to continue to [[3rd millennium|the next millennium]].&lt;ref name=K9/&gt;  Programs like HOT have debunked the hypothesis that this ecosystem is static and homogenous, finding that the NPSG exhibits dynamic seasonal patterns separating it from other open ocean systems.

== Physical characteristics ==

The NPSG is the largest of the open ocean habitats and is considered to be the Earth’s largest contiguous [[biome]].&lt;ref&gt;(Karl et al., 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; This great anticyclonic circulation feature extends from 15°N to 35°N latitude and from 135°E to 135°W longitude. Its surface area spans approximately 2 x 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Its western portion, west of 180° longitude, has greater physical variability than the eastern portion. This variability, where different weather patterns affect subregions differently, is due to the large dimensions of this gyre.&lt;ref name=K9/&gt;

This large variability is caused by discrete eddies, near-inertial motions, and [[internal tide]]s.&lt;ref name=K9/&gt; Climate patterns such as the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO), El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) affect the interannual variability in primary productivity in the NPSG.&lt;ref name=C7/&gt; DiLorenzo et al., 2008 These conditions can have profound effects on [[biological process]]es within this habitat,&lt;ref name=K9/&gt; they have the ability to shift [[sea surface temperature]] (SST), chlorophyll patterns, nutrient patterns, oxygen concentrations, [[mixed layer]] depths, and thus the [[carrying capacity]] (amount of life this habitat can carry) of the NPSG.

== Nutrient cycling ==

Low nutrient concentrations and thus a low density of [[Organism|living organisms]] characterize the surface waters of the NPSG. The low [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] results in clear water, allowing [[photosynthesis]] to occur to a substantial depth. The NPSG is classically described as a two-layered system. The upper, nutrient-limited layer accounts for most of the [[primary production]], supported primarily by recycled nutrients. The lower layer has nutrients more readily available, but photosynthesis is light-limited.&lt;ref name=D8/&gt;

In open-ocean systems, biological production depends on intense nutrient recycling within the [[euphotic]] (sunlit) zone, with only a small fraction supported by the input of “new” nutrients.&lt;ref name=H9&gt;Hannides et al., 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Previously there was a perception that the NPSG was a marine desert and that “new” nutrients were not commonly added to this system. The outlook has changed, as scientists have begun to have a better understanding of this habitat.&lt;ref name=K9/&gt; Although fairly high rates of primary production are maintained through rapid recycling of nutrients,&lt;ref name=D8/&gt;  physical processes such as [[internal wave]]s and tides, cyclonic mesoscale eddies, wind-driven Ekman pumping, and atmospheric storms may carry in new nutrients.&lt;ref name=N8&gt;Nicholson et al., 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Nutrients that do not get used up on the surface will eventually sink down and nourish the seafloor habitat. The deep [[Benthos|benthic habitats]] of the ocean gyres have been thought to typically consist of some of the most food-poor regions on the planet.&lt;ref name=SH&gt;(Shulenberger and Hessler, 1974)&lt;/ref&gt; One of the sources of nutrients to this deep ocean habitat is [[marine snow]]. Marine snow consists of detritus, dead organic matter, which falls from the surface waters where productivity is highest and exports carbon and nitrogen from the surface mixed layer to the deep ocean. Data on the abundance of marine snow to the deep [[Seabed|ocean floor]] is lacking in this large ecosystem.&lt;ref name=P5&gt;Pilskaln et al., 2005&lt;/ref&gt; However, Pilskaln et al. found that in the NPSG, marine snow was at a higher abundance than expected and were surprisingly comparable to a deep coastal upwelling system.

Higher nutrient value may be because of Rhizosolenia mats, which also play an important role in contributing to marine snow in subtropical gyres.  These are generally multi-species associations of Rhizosolenia species of diatoms. This larger phytoplankton may reach up to 10s of centimeters in size.&lt;ref name=P5/&gt; These mats are particularly abundant in the NPSG. Their abundance in this ecosystem suggests a higher flux of nutrients in the NPSG than was predicted in classic theories.
[[File:Zooplankton.jpg|thumb|Zooplankton can migrate nutrients across different vertical levels of ocean.]]
While N is transported deeper by this mechanism, the surface waters are potentially cut off from this source. Nitrogen must be available for life at the surface. In order to account for this lack of nitrogen to the surface, there are organisms that are capable of [[nitrogen fixation]] in the NPSG. Trichodesmium is one species capable of nitrogen fixation that is found in many surface plankton blooms.&lt;ref name=N8/&gt; Nitrogen fixation is the process where inert N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is taken from the atmosphere and converted into a nitrogen compound that is available to organisms for use. In many oligotrophic [[marine ecosystem]]s, nitrogen fixation is a [[common source]] of nitrogen.

[[Diel migration|Vertically migrating]] zooplankton can also actively transport nutrients to different zones of the [[water column]]. [[Zooplankton]] feed in the surface waters at night, and then by day release fecal pellets to the midwaters, which can transport C, N, and P to the deeper waters. In the NPSG the zooplankton community is not static but fluctuates seasonally and is dominated by copepods, euphausiids, and chaetognaths.&lt;ref name=H9/&gt;

Recently, classic theories about the lack of nutrients in the NPSG have been disproven and new theories suggest that the ecosystem actually is dynamic and characterized by strong seasonal, interannual, and even decadal variability&lt;ref name=P5/&gt; It has also been deemed highly sensitive to [[climate change]], scientists have observed increases in water column stratification and decreased inorganic nutrient availability. These changes are proposed as driving mechanisms that are changing the current trend in phytoplankton community structure from eukaryotic to prokaryotic populations, as these simpler organisms can withstand lower nutrient supply.&lt;ref name=P5/&gt; Zooplankton and phytoplankton represent less than 10% of living organisms in this region, and it is now well documented that the NPSG is a “microbial ecosystem”.&lt;ref name=K9/&gt;

== Microbial community ==

[[Microbial]] organisms make up the majority of the [[primary producers]] in the NPSG. They are [[autotrophic]], meaning they capture their own “food” from sunlight and chemicals, including {{CO2}}. These organisms comprise the base of the [[food chain]], and thus their presence in an ecosystem is fundamental. In the NPSG, primary productivity is often described as low.

Before 1978, scientists hypothesized that diatoms dominated plankton populations in the NPSG. The primary consumers were expected to be relatively large mesozooplankton.&lt;ref name=K9/&gt; It is now well known that most of the algae in the NPSG are actually bacteria (unicellular organisms), dominated by cyanobacteria, or [[Cyanobacteria|blue-green algae]]. These simple organisms make up the majority of the standing stock of photosynthesizing marine life in this ecosystem. Scientists have also recently discovered Archaea (also a single-celled [[microorganism]], but more similar to a eukaryote than bacteria) genes in the NPSG, suggesting that additional diversity exists in this habitat. Many microorganisms may exist in this gyre because small body size has a [[Sustainable competitive advantage|competitive advantage]] in the ocean for resource (light and nutrients) acquisition.&lt;ref name=K9/&gt; In the contemporary view of the NPSG, the microbial food web is always present, whereas the larger eukaryote-grazer food chain is seasonal and ephemeral.&lt;ref name=K9/&gt;

== Eukaryotic plankton community ==
[[File:Phytoplankton - the foundation of the oceanic food chain.jpg|thumb|[[Phytoplankton]] are a form of Eukaryotic plankton found in oceans.]]
[[Eukaryotic]] plankton in the gyre is dependent on “new” nutrients coming in from physical weather patterns. The classic two-layered model discussed in previous sections considers the upper layer to be equivalent to a “spinning wheel,” with little export of nutrients because they are constantly recycled. This model does not allow for the input of new nutrients, which is problematic because this would make any rapid increase, or bloom of phytoplankton impossible. Despite ever-present nutrient limitation in the upper portion, plankton biomass and rates of primary production have considerable temporal variability and do produce blooms in the NPSG.&lt;ref name=C7/&gt;

This interannual variability has been attributed to alterations in upper ocean nutrient supply stemming from physical variations due to ENSO and PDO.&lt;ref name=C7/&gt; Based on new data, it now appears that present rates of primary production in these low nutrient regions are much greater than had been considered, and can vary significantly on time scales ranging from daily to interdecadal.&lt;ref name=K9/&gt; In the spring, rapid increases in surface phytoplankton are occasionally observed in association with cyclonic mesoscale eddies or intense atmospheric disturbances, both physical processes that bring in new nutrients.&lt;ref name=D8/&gt;  In the summer, blooms are seen more regularly and are typically dominated by diatoms and cyanobacteria. These regular summer blooms may be caused by variations in the PDO.&lt;ref name=C7/&gt; Summer blooms have been observed in these waters as long as research vessels have been frequenting them. All of these blooms have been seen in the eastern part of the NSPG with none reported west of 160° W.&lt;ref name=D8/&gt; Hypotheses to explain this phenomenon are that the gyre is characterized by low phosphate, but that the bloom region of the eastern NPSG has considerably higher phosphate concentrations than the western.&lt;ref name=D8/&gt;

Variations in primary production in the NPSG can significantly affect nutrient cycling, [[food-web]] dynamics, and global elemental fluxes.&lt;ref name=C7/&gt; The size distribution of pelagic primary producers determines both the composition and magnitude of the exported nutrients to the deeper waters.&lt;ref name=K9/&gt; This in turn affects the communities that live in the deeper waters of this system.

== Mesopelagic community ==

The [[mesopelagic zone]] is sometimes referred to as the twilight zone; it extends from 200m to around 1000m. In the deeper layers of the NPSG, species higher up on the food chain will migrate vertically or horizontally within or in and out of the gyre. Based on analyses of the zooplankton community, the Central North Pacific has a high [[Species richness|species diversity]] (or high number of species) and high equitability (meaning relatively equal numbers of each exist). There is also a low degree of seasonal variability of densities of zooplankton.&lt;ref name=K9/&gt;

Studies of mesopelagic fishes of central subtropical waters are scarce. The few studies that do exist found that mesopelagic fish species are not [[Uniform distribution (ecology)|uniformly distributed]] throughout the subtropical Pacific Ocean. Their geographic ranges conform to patterns shown by zooplankton. Some of the species found are restricted to these low-productivity central gyres. Some of the families of fish that are highly represented are Mytophids, Gonostomatids, Photichthyids, Sternoptychids, and Melamphaids.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; Our understanding of the mesopelagic community of the NPSG suffers from an insufficiency of data due to the difficulty of accessing the deeper zones of this system.

== Benthic community ==

The deepest community in the NPSG is the [[benthic]] community. At the depths of the gyre lies a sea floor of [[Granularity|fine-grained]] clay sediments. This sediment is home to a community of organisms, which generally receive their nutrients as a “rain” of productivity sinking from above. At depth under the gyre lies one of the most food-poor areas on the planet, which therefore supports very low densities and biomass of benthic infauna, or animals residing in the sediment.&lt;ref name=SH/&gt; In the sediment itself, nutrients generally decline with depth, including carbon, chlorophyll, and nitrogen. Density of the benthic infauna is consistent with this nutrient pattern. Infauna are typically found in the shallower layers of sediments where the [[sediment-water interface]] lies and generally decrease in number with increasing depth in the sediment.&lt;ref name=S2&gt;Smith Jr. et al., 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Bacteria in the sediment show this pattern as well as macrofauna (infaunal organisms &gt;0.5mm), which are dominated by agglutinating (soft-bodied) foraminifera and nematodes. Other prominent macrofauna found in the sediment are calcareous foraminifera, copepods, polychaetes, and bivalves.&lt;ref name=S2/&gt; These benthic organisms rely heavily on the supply of nutrients that settle to the sea floor. Any change in primary production at the surface could pose a major threat to these organisms, as well as cause other potential negative outcomes to other parts of the NPSG.

== Future and importance of the NPSG ==
[[File:Plastic Ocean (4408273247).jpg|thumb|Plastic garbage washed ashore from the Pacific Ocean]]
Until recently the NPSG was considered to be a static part of a vast global marine desert. Recent discoveries have proved that this system is dynamic and contains physical, chemical, and biological variability on a variety of time scales. With the current changing climate, patterns in the atmosphere are shifting and causing changes in primary production in the NPSG. Variations in primary productivity can affect the ocean [[carbon cycle]] and potentially atmospheric {{CO2}} and climate, because such variations can change the amount of carbon that is stored in the subsurface layers of the oceans.&lt;ref&gt;Brix et al., 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Because the NPSG is the largest contiguous biome on earth, it is not only important to a community of organisms, but also the rest of the planet.

The NPSG has received copious attention because of another issue it currently faces. The eddy effects of the gyre serve to retain pollutants in its center. If a pollutant gets trapped in a current that is headed toward a gyre, it will stay there indefinitely or as long as the life of the pollutant. One such pollutant that is persistent and common in the NPSG is plastic debris. The NPSG forces debris into its central area. This phenomenon has recently given this gyre the nickname, “The Pacific Garbage Patch.”  The mean abundance and weight of plastic pieces in this area are currently the largest observed in the Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;Moore et al., 2001&lt;/ref&gt; It is rumored that this plastic “soup” is anywhere from the size of Texas to the size of the US. With increasing interest in pollution and climate change, the NPSG has gained more attention. It is important that our knowledge of this system continue to flourish for these reasons, as well as solely for the understanding of the world’s largest ecosystem.

The '''electricity sector in Brazil''' is the largest in [[South America]]. 
Its currently installed capacity by the end of 2016 was 150,338 MW, a 9.500 MW increase on 2015.&lt;ref name="Ministério de Minas e Energia"&gt;[http://www.mme.gov.br/documents/10584/3580498/09+-+Capacidade+Instalada+de+Gera%C3%A7%C3%A3o+El%C3%A9trica+-+ano+ref.+2016+%28PDF%29/cbf8aa82-eea6-4141-9370-14022762785a?version=1.0]&lt;/ref&gt;
The installed capacity grew from 11,000 MW in 1970 with an average yearly growth of 5.8% per year.
Brazil has the largest capacity for water storage in the world,&lt;ref name="OECD"&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/12/11/34427493.pdf OECD]&lt;/ref&gt; being highly dependent on [[hydroelectricity]] generation capacity, which meets over 70% of its electricity demand. The national grid is composed 80% from renewable sources.
This dependence on hydropower makes Brazil vulnerable to power supply shortages in drought years, as was demonstrated by the 2001-2002 energy crisis.&lt;ref name="WB07"&gt;World Bank 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Interconnected System (SIN) comprises the electricity companies in the South, South-East, Center-West, North-East and part of the North region. Only 3.4% of the country's electricity production is located outside the SIN, in small isolated systems located mainly in the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazonian region]].&lt;ref name="ONS"&gt;[http://www.ons.org.br/ National System Operator (ONS)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Generation capacity in Brazil is dominated by [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric plants]],&lt;ref name="WB07" /&gt; which account for 77% of total installed capacity,&lt;ref name="MEM"&gt;Ministry of Energy and Mines 2016&lt;/ref&gt; with 24 plants above 1,000 [[WATT|MW]]. About 88 percent of the electricity fed into the national grid is estimated to come from hydroelectric generation, with over 25% coming from a single hydropower plant, the massive 14 [[WATT|GW]] [[Itaipu dam]] facility, located between Brazil and [[Paraguay]] on the [[Paraná River]].&lt;ref name="WB07" /&gt; Natural gas generation is second in importance, representing about 10% of total capacity,&lt;ref name="MEM" /&gt; close to the 12% goal for 2010 established in 1993 by the Ministry of Mines and Energy.&lt;ref name="Fernandes"&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V2W-49P48HK-2&amp;_user=1916569&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000055300&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=1916569&amp;md5=911549640bfc09959c074d915357d3ae | doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2003.08.006 | volume=33 | issue=3 | title=Natural gas in Brazil's energy matrix: demand for 1995–2010 and usage factors | year=2005 | journal=Energy Policy | pages=365–386 | last1 = Fernandes | first1 = Elton | last2 = Marcus | last3 = Fonseca | first3 = A. | last4 = Paulo Sergio | first4 = R.

This reliance on abundant hydroelectric resources allegedly reduces the overall generation costs. However, this large dependence on hydropower makes the country especially vulnerable to supply shortages in low-rainfall years (See [[Electricity sector in Brazil#The 2001-2002 crisis and the government's response|The 2001-2002 crisis]] below).&lt;ref name="Lock"&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VSS-4F60NKJ-3&amp;_user=1916569&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000055300&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=1916569&amp;md5=36ddd4968fd7cf90c597dc32ace6cdfd | doi=10.1016/j.tej.2004.12.003 | volume=18 | title=The New Electricity Model in Brazil: An Institutional Framework in Transition | year=2005 | journal=The Electricity Journal | pages=52–61 | last1 = Lock | first1 = Reinier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As summarized in the table above, Brazil has two nuclear power plants, [[Angra Nuclear Power Plant|Angra 1]] (657 [[WATT|MW]]) and [[Angra Nuclear Power Plant|Angra 2]] (1,350 [[WATT|MW]]), both of them owned by [[Eletronuclear]], a subsidiary of the state-owned [[Eletrobrás]].&lt;ref name="EIA"&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/Brazil/pdf.pdf EIA]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New generation projects ===
Brazil needs to add 6000 MW of capacity every year in order to satisfy growing demand from an increasing and more prosperous population. The Brazilian Ministry of Energy has decided to generate 50% of new supplies from hydropower, 30% from wind and biomass such as [[bagasse]], and 20% from gas and other sources. Wind in the North-East is strongest during the dry season when hydropower plants produce less, so the two energy sources are seasonally complementary.&lt;ref name="Economist Belo Monte"&gt;{{cite news|title=The rights and wrongs of Belo Monte|url=https://www.economist.com/news/americas/21577073-having-spent-heavily-make-worlds-third-biggest-hydroelectric-project-greener-brazil|publisher=The Economist|accessdate=4 May 2013|date=4 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hydroelectric plants ====
Brazil has an untapped hydropower potential of 180,000 MW, including about 80,000 MW in protected regions for which there are no development plans. The government expects to develop the rest by 2030. Most new hydropower plants are run-of-river plants that are less damaging to the environment, because their reservoirs are small. However, they are more vulnerable to droughts and less efficient, because only a fraction of their capacity can be used during the dry season.&lt;ref name="Economist Belo Monte"/&gt;

The National Agency for Electricity (ANEEL) has commissioned feasibility studies for several hydroelectric plants (small, medium and large) in the period 2006-2008. These studies correspond to a total potential capacity of 31,000[[WATT|MW]]. In 2007, [[Ibama]], the environmental agency, gave approval for the construction of two new dams, the [[Jirau Dam]] (3,300 [[WATT|MW]]) and the [[Santo Antônio Dam]] (3,150 [[WATT|MW]]), on the [[Madeira River]] in the state of [[Rondônia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/world/la/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9660102 The Economist]&lt;/ref&gt; The bid for the Santo Antônio plant was awarded in December 2007 to Madeira Energy, with a 39% participation from state-owned [[Furnas]], while the bid for the Jirau plant will be launched in May 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canalenergia.com.br/zpublisher/materias/Negocios.asp?id=64455 Canal Energia]&lt;/ref&gt; The government is also pursuing development of the controversial 11,000 [[WATT|MW]] [[Belo Monte Dam]] in the state of [[Pará]], on the [[Xingu River]].  [[IBAMA]] approved Belo Monte's provisional environmental license in February 2010 despite internal uproar from technicians over incomplete data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orm.com.br/redacao/pdf/AHE_BeloMonte.pdf ORM Belém]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Nuclear power in Brazil}}
Also in 2007, Electronuclear was granted permission to resume construction of Angra 3, a 1,350 [[WATT|MW]] plant, and is currently in the process of selecting a site for a fourth nuclear power plant.&lt;ref name="EIA" /&gt; In February 2014, Eletrobras Eletronuclear awarded contracts to begin construction, with an estimated completion date of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.power-technology.com/projects/angranuclear/{{Unreliable source?|reason=domain on WP:BLACKLIST|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Thermoelectric plants ====
Currently, the development of gas-fired thermoelectric power is somewhat jeopardized by the lack of secure gas supplies. In fact, having a secure gas contract is a prerequisite to build a new [[thermal power station|thermoelectric plant]] and to participate in a new energy auction (See [[Electricity sector in Brazil#The 2003-2004 reforms: energy auctions|Energy auctions]] below). In order to counter the risk of unavailability of gas supplies, Brazil is in the initial stages of planning to build two LNG terminals that would likely come on-stream around 2010. However, in the meantime, several thermoelectric plants are converting their machinery to dual-fuel capacity (oil and gas).&lt;ref name="B&amp;S"&gt;Bear Stearns 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Demand ===
{{update section|date=June 2017}}
Total electricity consumed in 2007 was 410 [[kWh|TWh]], while [[List of countries by electricity consumption|annual consumption per capita]] for the same year averaged 2,166 [[kWh]].&lt;ref name="EIU"&gt;Economist Intelligence Unit, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; 
The share of consumption by sector was as follows:&lt;ref name="Abrade"&gt;[http://www.abradee.org.br/ ABRADEE]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Residential: 40% (including 6% for the rural sector)
* Industrial: 25%
* Commercial: 22%
* Rural: 6%
* Public: 13%

Electricity demand is expected to grow an average of 3.6% in the next few years, leading to total estimated consumption of 504 [[kWh|TWh]] and average per capita consumption of 2,527 [[kWh]].&lt;ref name="EIU07"&gt;Economist Intelligence Unit, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;{{when|date=June 2017}}

In Brazil, capacity addition traditionally lagged behind demand growth.&lt;ref name="WB07" /&gt; 
Electricity demand is expected to continue to grow at a quick pace. 
The [[income elasticity of demand]] for electricity is estimated by [[Eletrobras]] at above unity. 
Between 1980 and 2000, electricity demand increased on average by 5.4 per cent per year while GDP grew by 2.4 per cent on average per year. 
Investment is therefore needed to boost generation and transmission capacity because there is limited excess supply, despite the reduction in demand following the [[energy rationing]] program implemented in 2001 in response to the [[Electricity sector in Brazil#The 2001-2002 crisis|energy crisis]].&lt;ref name="OECD" /&gt;

== Access to electricity ==
Brazil, together with Chile, is the country with the highest access rate in Latin America. The power sector in Brazil serves more than 50 million customers, which corresponds to about 97% of the country's households, who have access to reliable electricity.&lt;ref name="WB07" /&gt;

== Service quality ==

=== Interruption frequency and duration ===
Interruption frequency and duration are very close to the averages for the [[Latin America|LAC]] region. In 2005, the average number of interruptions per subscriber was 12.5, while duration of interruptions per subscriber was 16.5 hours. The [[Weighted mean|weighted averages]] for [[Latin America|LAC]] were 13 interruptions and 14 hours respectively.&lt;ref name="Benchmarking"&gt;[http://info.worldbank.org/etools/lacelectricity/home.htm Benchmarking data of the electricity distribution sector in Latin America and Caribbean Region 1995-2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Distribution losses ===
Distribution losses in 2005 were 14%, well in line with the 13.5% average for the [[Latin America|LAC]] region&lt;ref name="Benchmarking" /&gt; but about double that of an OECD country such as the [[Great Britain]], with 7% distribution losses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ofgem.gov.uk/Networks/ElecDist/Policy/DistChrgs/Documents1/1362-03distlosses.pdf OFGEM]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responsibilities in the electricity sector ==

=== Policy and regulation ===

The '''Ministry of Energy and Mines''' (MME) has the overall responsibility for policy setting in the electricity sector while '''[[ANEEL]]''', which is linked to the Ministry of Mines and Energy, is the '''Brazilian Electricity Regulatory Agency''' created in 1996 by Law 9427. ANEEL's function is to regulate and control the generation, transmission and distribution of power in compliance with the existing legislation and with the directives and policies dictated by the Central Government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aneel.gov.br/cedoc/dec19972335.pdf Decree No 2.335,October 6, 1997]&lt;/ref&gt; The '''National Council for Energy Policies''' ('''CNPE'''), is an advisory body to the MME in charge of approving supply criteria and "structural" projects while the '''Electricity Industry Monitoring Committee''' ('''CMSE''') monitors supply continuity and security.&lt;ref name="Millán"&gt;Millán,2006&lt;/ref&gt;

ANEEL and the Ministry of Environment play almost no part in which investment projects go ahead, but they only influence how projects are executed once the decision has been taken. Both have had their bosses resign rather than supporting infrastructure projects in the Amazon.&lt;ref name="Economist Belo Monte"/&gt;

The '''Operator of the National Electricity System''' ('''ONS''') is a non-profit private entity created in August 1998 that is responsible for the coordination and control of the generation and transmission installations in the National Interconnected System (SIN). The ONS is under ANEEL's control and regulation.&lt;ref name="ONS" /&gt;

The '''Power Commercialization Chamber''' (CCEE), successor of MAE (''Mercado Atacadista de Energia Electrica''), is the operator of the commercial market. The initial role of the operator was to create a single, integrated commercial electricity market, to be regulated under published rules. This role has become more active since now CCEE is in charge of the auction system.&lt;ref name="Lock" /&gt; The rules and commercialization procedures that regulate CCEE's activities are approved by ANEEL.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccee.org.br/cceeinterdsm/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=99f9a5c1de88a010VgnVCM100000aa01a8c0RCRD CCEE - Câmara de Comercialização de Energia Elétrica&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the '''Power Research Company''' (EPE) was created in 2004 with the specific mission of developing an integrated long-term planning for the power sector in Brazil. Its mission is to carry out studies and research services in the planning of the energy sector in areas such as power, oil and natural gas and its derivates, coal, renewable energy resources and energy efficiency, among others. Its work serves as input for the planning and implementation of actions by the Ministry of Energy and Mines in the formulation of the national energy policy&lt;ref&gt;[[:pt:Empresa de Pesquisa Energética]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brazilian electricity model is fully deregulated, which allows generators to sell all of their "assured energy" via freely negotiated contracts with consumers above 3[[WATT|MW]] or via energy auctions administered by CCEE (See [[Electricity sector in Brazil#The 2003-2004 reform: energy auctions|energy auctions]] below). . Under this model, distributors are required to contract 100% of their expected demand. Currently, Brazilian generation supply can be sold under four types of markets:&lt;ref name="B&amp;S" /&gt;

* "Old energy"* auction contracts (long term): approximately 41% of the 2006 market
* "New energy"* auction contracts (long term):delivery starts in 2008
* Free-market contracts (long term): approximately 27% of 2006 market
* Spot Market Sales (size uncertain)

(*The government identifies two types of generation capacity, "old energy" and "new energy". Old energy represents existing plants that were already contracted in the 1990s, while new energy refers to that energy produced by plants that have not yet been built, or by existing plants that meet certain criteria.)

=== Generation ===
In Brazil, large government-controlled companies dominate the electricity sector. Federally owned [[Eletrobras]] holds about 40% of capacity (including 50% of the Itaipu dam), with state-companies CESP, [[Cemig]] and Copel controlling 8%, 7% and 5% of generation capacity respectively.&lt;ref name="B&amp;S" /&gt;

Generation capacity is shared among the different companies as follows:

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(1)&lt;/sup&gt; Considering 6,300MW of Iguaçú&lt;/small&gt;

Currently, about 27 percent of the generation assets are in the hands of private investors. Considering the plants under construction, as well as the concessions and licenses already granted by ANEEL, this figure is expected to grow up to 31 percent in the medium term and to reach almost 44 percent over 5–6 years. Private [[capital participation]] in the generation business will likely represent 50 percent of the installed capacity in the years to come&lt;ref name="WB07" /&gt;

=== Transmission ===
Brazil's transmission system is growing in importance since adequate transmission capacity is essential to manage the effects of regional droughts, allowing to move power from areas where rainfall is plentiful. As a matter of fact, the rationing that occurred in Brazil during 2001-2002 (See [[Electricity sector in Brazil#The 2001-2002 crisis and the government's response|The 2001-2002 crisis]] below), could have largely been averted if there had been adequate transmission capacity between the south (excess supply) and the southeast (severe deficit).&lt;ref name="B&amp;S" /&gt;

Transmission has remained almost exclusively under government control through both federal ([[Eletrobras]]) and state companies (mainly Sao-Paulo-CTEEP, Minas Gerais-Cemig, and Parana-Copel) until recently.{{when|date=April 2011}} However, under the new sector regulatory model, there are about 40 transmission concessions in Brazil. Most of them are still controlled by the government, with subsidiaries under federal company [[Eletrobras]] holding 69% of total transmission lines.&lt;ref name="B&amp;S" /&gt;

== Renewable energy resources ==

In Brazil, hydroelectricity supplies about 77% of total electricity demand. It is estimated that about 70% of the overall [[hydroelectricity]] potential of the country, is still unexploited.&lt;ref name="B&amp;S" /&gt;

Apart from biomass, which accounts for about 3.5% of total generation capacity, no other renewable energy source besides [[hydroelectricity]] plays a relevant role in the energy mix. However, the potential for wind energy, which is concentrated in the Northeast, is very large. It is about 143 GW, which exceeds current installed capacity and is second only to [[Electricity sector in Argentina#Wind|Argentina]] in the [[Latin America and the Caribbean|LAC]] region.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank&lt;/ref&gt; There are projects for the development of biomass, solar and wind energy.&lt;ref name="EIU" /&gt;

=== PROINFA ===
In 2002, the government of Brazil created a Program to Foster Alternative Sources of Electric Power (PROINFA). The program aims to increase the participation of wind power sources, biomass sources and small hydropower systems in the supply of the Brazilian grid system through Autonomous Independent Producers (PIA). The medium to long-term objective (i.e. 20 years) of the program is that the defined sources supply 15% of the annual market growth until they reach 10% of the nation's annual electric power demand/total consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iea.org/textbase/pm/?mode=weo&amp;id=3428&amp;action=detail IEA]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the electricity sector ==

=== The situation prior to the reforms: the state-dominated model ===
The power sector in Brazil was essentially in government's hands until the early 1990s. The sector had seen remarkable development in the 1970s. However, by the late 1980s, the state-ownership model was on the verge of collapse. This delicate situation was the result of heavily subsidized tariffs and a revenue shortfall in the sector of about US$35 billion, which led to the delay in the construction of about 15 large hydro plants due to lack of funds for investment. Efforts to address the deterioration of the sector were not successful, a situation that further intensified the need for deep reforms. A major commitment was made by [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso|President Cardoso]] to carry out a substantial reform of the Brazilian electricity sector. The first reforms introduced in the power sector were aimed to allow the participation of private capital and also to improve its economic situation.&lt;ref name="WB07" /&gt;

=== The 1990s reforms ===
The Project for Restructuring the Brazilian Electric Sector, RESEB, which laid down the first steps for the implementation of the power sector reform, was initiated in 1996 during the administration of [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso|President Cardoso]]. The objective of the reform was to build a more competitive power sector with the creation of a level playing field for private sector participation. In addition, state-owned utilities and assets were privatized. Although transmission assets were not privatized, most of the expansion of the transmission network has been carried out by private capital.&lt;ref name="WB07" /&gt; This reform also led to the creation, in 1996, of ANEEL (Brazil's National Electricity Regulatory Agency), a quasi-independent regulatory body in charge of overseeing the electricity sector. However, the main restructuring steps were taken with the enactment of the 1998 Law (Law 9648/98). Those steps included the creation of an independent operator of the national transmission system (ONS) and an operator of the commercial market (MAE), which did not become operational until 2001.&lt;ref name="WB07" /&gt;  
 
As a result of the reforms of the power sector, new capital was attracted, both in terms of privatization and [[greenfield project]]s. Some of the state-owned generation capacity was acquired by foreign investors such as Tractebel, [[AES Corporation|AES]], [[Prisma Energy International|Prisma Energy]], El Paso and [[Duke Energy|Duke]], which became significant producers. In addition, local investors such as industrial groups, large customers, utilities and pension funds also invested heavily in the national generation sector. Other companies such as EdF (''[[Électricité de France]]''), [[Endesa (Spain)|Endesa]] and Chilectra focused on the distribution segment, a segment in which privatization brought improved quality of service and a reduction of theft, non-payments and technical losses.&lt;ref name="WB07" /&gt;

However, the reforms were not successful in preventing the energy crisis that was to unfold in 2001. Installed capacity expanded by only 28 per cent during 1990-99, whereas electricity demand increased by 45 per cent.&lt;ref name="OECD" /&gt; In 1999, as the power shortage was already foreseen, the [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso|President Cardoso]] Administration made efforts to increase private investment in the electricity sector through a Priority Thermal Power Program (PPT) that aimed at the expeditious construction of more than 40 gas-fired thermal plants. Unfortunately, the needed investment did not materialize and the crisis became unavoidable.&lt;ref name="WB07" /&gt;

=== The 2001-2002 crisis and the government's response ===
Brazil was faced with one of the most serious energy crises in its history in 2001-2002. The crisis was the direct result of a sequence of a few years drier than average in a country with over 80% of [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] generation capacity. Additionally, several delays in the commissioning of new generation plants and transmission problems in the third circuit from the Itaipu hydropower plant accounted for a third of the energy deficit. Reservoir levels reached such low levels that supply could not be ensured for more than four months.&lt;ref name="WB07" /&gt;

It was soon clear that strict demand reduction programs would be needed to avoid widespread blackouts. In June 2001, the government created the Crisis Management Board (CGE), chaired by [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso|President Cardoso]] himself. The CGE received special powers among which was the authority to set up special tariffs, implement compulsory rationing and blackouts, and bypass normal bidding procedures of the purchase of new plant equipment. Instead of resorting to [[rolling blackout]]s, the government chose to apply a quota system. Quotas were established for all the consumers based on historical and target consumption level, applying bonuses for consumption well below the prescribed level, penalties for over-consumption and some freedom for the large users to trade their quotas in a [[secondary market]]. The government's goal of reducing historical consumption levels by at least 20% for an eight-month period was successfully achieved, with the government having to pay over US$200 million in bonuses to residential, industrial, and commercial customers. This achievement allowed the system to overcome that long period without blackouts and brownouts&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esmap.org/filez/pubs/372007120957_305-05+Final_to_website.pdf ESMAP, 2005. Chapter 4]&lt;/ref&gt; and proved the potential of demand-side management and energy efficiency efforts, which were able to create a virtual capacity of 4,000[[WATT|MW]], helping the country to bridge the supply demand gap in a very economic way. In addition, the government launched a program for contracting emergency generation capacity, with bids for a total of 2,100[[WATT|MW]] of new thermal capacity accepted.&lt;ref name="WB07" /&gt;

However, the crisis affected numerous actors. Generators and distributors experienced a 20% reduction in their revenues due to the contraction in consumption. This situation was eventually addressed by an increase of tariffs approved by the government. The financial situation of distributors was also damaged, with customers also suffering from the increase in electricity prices (140% in [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|nominal terms]] between 1995 and 2002).&lt;ref name="WB07" /&gt;

=== The 2003-2004 reforms: energy auctions ===
In January 2003, the new administration led by [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] took over among criticism of the reforms introduced in the electricity sector by the administration of [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso|President Cardoso]], supporting a model in which the system should be fully regulated. The pending privatizations of three generation subsidiaries of the large state-owned utility, [[Eletrobras]], were stopped. However, despite initial expectations, the new administration opted for a model that clearly aims to attract long-term private investment to the sector and that heavily relies on competition. In addition, the existing institutions were preserved and in some cases strengthened, with a new company, EPE, created with the specific mission of developing an integrated long-term planning for the power sector in Brazil.&lt;ref name="WB07" /&gt;

The new legislative framework was defined by Law 10,848/2004, which established clear, stable and transparent rules aimed at ensuring supply and the continuous expansions of the intrinsic sector activities (generation, transmission and distribution). The expansion was linked to a fair return on investments and to universal service access, together with tariff adjustments. Decree 5,081/2004 approved the regulatory framework for the power sector, specifying specific provisions to achieve the objectives of the reform. 
&lt;ref name="ONS" /&gt;
One of the defining elements of the model adopted by the new administration is the establishment of energy auctions as the main procurement mechanism for distribution companies to acquire energy to serve their captive consumers. This initiative assisted in the introduction of competition in the power sector and also helped to address some of the existing [[market failure|market imperfections]]. Under this system, auctions of capacity from new generation projects will be held three to five years in advance of delivery dates. The Ministry of Mines and Energy wants to ensure that the totality of future expansion needs is met and that plants are only built once they have won bids in energy [[auction]]s and are guaranteed long-term contracts. The first auction was held in December 2004, with contracts for a total of about 40[[WATT|GW]] traded.&lt;ref name="WB07" /&gt;

== Tariffs and Subsidies ==

=== Tariffs ===
Average electricity tariffs for the different sectors in 2007 were as follows:&lt;ref name="ANEEL"&gt;[http://www.aneel.gov.br/area.cfm?idArea=507&amp;idPerfil=11 ANEEL]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Residential: 15.3 US¢/[[kWh]]
* Industrial: 11.3 US¢/[[kWh]]
* Commercial: 14.2 US¢/[[kWh]]
* Rural: 9.1 US¢/[[kWh]]

== Investment and financing ==
In the last 20 years, Brazil has been one of the main recipients of private capital investment in its power sector.&lt;ref name="WB07" /&gt; Total investment by private actors in the power sector between 1994 and 2006 amounted to US$56,586 million in 124 projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ppi.worldbank.org/explore/ppi_exploreCountry.aspx?countryID=104 Private Participation in Infrastructure Database]&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite Brazil's deregulation and higher tariffs in the "new energy" auction system, investment, particularly in generation, has slowed significantly. This situation is not considered to be the result of concerns about the regulatory model or auction pricing caps, but it reflects the lack of available projects. The existing delays in granting environmental licenses and the uncertainties on the Bolivian gas supply, explain to a great extent the lack of hydroelectric and gas-fired thermoelectric projects respectively.&lt;ref name="B&amp;S" /&gt;

The investment required in power generation over the next 10 years is [[Brazilian real|R$]]40 billion or around US$24.2 billion (April 29, 2008). This high investment will only be realized if the government succeeds in attracting greater private-sector investment.&lt;ref name="EIU" /&gt;

== Summary of private participation in the electricity sector ==
In Brazil, large government-controlled companies dominate the electricity sector. Federally owned [[Eletrobras]] holds about 40% of capacity (including 50% of [[Itaipu Dam|Itaipu]]), with state-companies CESP, Cemig and Copel controlling 8%, 7% and 5% of generation capacity respectively. About 27% of generation assets are currently in the hands of private investors.

Transmission, it has remained almost exclusively under government control through both federal ([[Eletrobras]]) and state companies (mainly Sao-Paulo-CTEEP, Minas Gerais-Cemig, and Parana-Copel) until recently.{{when|date=April 2011}} However, under the new sector regulatory model, there are about 40 transmission As for distribution, there are 49 utilities with distribution concessions and about 64% of distribution assets are controlled by private sector companies.

== Electricity and the environment ==

=== Responsibility for the environment ===

The Ministry of the Environment holds the environmental responsibilities in Brazil. One of its associated institutions is Ibama, the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources, which is in charge of executing the environmental policies dictated by the Ministry regarding environmental licensing; environmental quality control; authorization of the use of natural resources; and environmental monitoring and control among others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibama.gov.br/ Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (Ibama)]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Greenhouse gas emissions ===

[http://www.olade.org OLADE] (Latin American Energy Association) estimated that CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from electricity production in 2003 were 20 million tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which corresponds to less than 7% of total emissions from the energy sector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olade.org/informe.html OLADE] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928074348/http://www.olade.org/informe.html |date=2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This low contribution to emissions from electricity production in comparison with other countries in the region is due to the high share of [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] generation.

=== CDM projects in electricity ===

Brazil is host to the largest number of [[Clean Development Mechanism|CDM]] projects in the Latin America region. Registered projects represent 40% of the total in the region and account for 45% of [[Certified Emission Reduction]]s (CERs) (up to 2012).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uneprisoe.org/ UNEP Riso Center. CDM pipeline, March 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

As for the power sector, there were 91 projects registered in March 2008, adding up to an estimated total of 9 million [[ton]]s of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per year. The distribution of projects by category is as follows:&lt;ref name="UNFCCC"&gt;[http://cdm.unfccc.int/Projects/projsearch.html UNFCCC]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Energy costing of Brazilian electricity ==

An exergoeconomic assessment accounting for the total and non-renewable unit exergy costs and specific CO2 emissions of Brazilian electricity is performed by Flórez-Orrego et al. (2014),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196890414003628 | doi=10.1016/j.enconman.2014.04.058 | volume=85 | title=Renewable and non-renewable exergy cost and specific CO2 emission of electricity generation: The Brazilian case | year=2014 | journal=Energy Conversion and Management | pages=619–629 | last1 = Flórez-Orrego | first1 = Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt; comprising thermal, nuclear, hydro, wind farms and biomass-fired power plants. The analysis starts from the fuel obtainment and continues through the different stages of construction, fuel transportation and processing, operation and decommissioning of the plant, with electricity generation as the desired output. This approach allows the calculation of direct CO2 emissions as well as the upstream and downstream emissions, which play an important role in some technologies. In this way, a better comparison between the utilization of different fuels in the electricity generation can be achieved. An iterative calculation procedure is used to determine the unit exergy costs of electricity and processed fuels, since both electricity and processed fuel are used in their own production routes.

As it was expected, fossil-fired power plants presents the highest specific CO2 emissions, with the coal-fired power plants leading the group. However, even though fossil-fired power plants presents the most marked environmental impacts, their total unit exergy costs are much lower than that presented by sugar cane bagasse-fired power plants. This shows that, although almost renewable, the typical configurations of sugar cane bagasse-fired power plants are far from being efficient technologies. Hydro and wind farms present the lowest specific CO2 emissions as well as the lowest unit exergy cost. Due to the high participation of renewable sources in the production of electricity (near to 89% of the total), Brazilian electricity mix emissions are found to be 7.5 and 11.8 times lower than Europe and World electricity mixes. Also, owed to the higher efficiency of hydroelectric power plants, which contribute to the major part of the electricity generation in Brazil, the total unit exergy cost is lower, and thus, exergy efficiency of electricity generation is higher if compared with countries based on fossil fuels for electricity generation.

Apparently, total exergy cost of wind and natural-gas fired technologies are almost the same, but contrarily to the wind power plants, the non-renewable unit exergy costs of NG-fired power plants is practically equal to the total cost. It should be noted that this result is a consequence of the efficiency assumed for wind power plants. If energy storage is to be taken into account for intermittent technologies such as wind farms, the total exergy cost could be slightly increased. The upstream and downstream CO2 emissions in the coal route represent a very small part of the total CO2 emissions, if compared with the direct emissions of coal burning in the power plant. Finally, it is pointed out that controversies related to the flooding dams of vast zones with complex ecosystems should be carefully analysed since, according to the results reported by Dones et al., the GHG emissions could be increased up to achieve emission levels comparable to those of gas combined cycles power plants.

'''Erden Eruç''' ({{IPA-tr|eɾˈden eˈɾut͡ʃ|audio|Erden Eruc pronunciation.ogg|pronunciation}} ''Air-den Air-rooch''; born 14 July 1961) is a Turkish-American adventurer who became the first person in history to complete an entirely ''solo'' and entirely [[Human-powered transport|human-powered]] [[circumnavigation]] of the [[Earth]] on 21 July 2012 in [[Bodega Bay, California]], United States.&lt;ref name=psd /&gt; The journey had started from Bodega Bay a little more than five years earlier on 10 July 2007.&lt;ref name=news2 /&gt; The [[modes of transport]] included a rowboat to cross the oceans, a sea kayak for shorelines, a bicycle on the roads and hiking on trails, along with canoes for a few river crossings.&lt;ref name=psd /&gt; The route he followed was {{convert|66299|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, crossed the [[equator]] twice and all lines of [[longitude]], and passed over twelve pairs of [[Antipodes|antipodal points]], meeting all the requirements for a true circumnavigation of the globe.&lt;ref name=circum /&gt;&lt;ref name=advstats /&gt; Guinness World Records has officially recognized Eruç for the ''First solo circumnavigation of the globe using human power'' on a journey that lasted 5 years 11 days 12 hours and 22 minutes, the current world record time for a solo human-powered circumnavigation.&lt;ref name=gwr2 /&gt;

Eruç's human-powered circumnavigation plan was expanded to include [[summit]]ting the tallest mountains on six [[continent]]s as a tribute to his friend and fellow adventurer [[Göran Kropp]] who died in 2002 while climbing with Eruç in [[Vantage, Washington]].&lt;ref name=radio1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ssp /&gt; Eruç named his expedition the ''Six Summits Project''.&lt;ref name=ssp /&gt; So far he has summitted three of the peaks including [[Denali]] (also known as Mount McKinley) in [[North America]] on 29 May 2003&lt;ref name=Denali/&gt; more than four years before he began his solo circumnavigation, then [[Mount Kosciuszko]] in [[Australia]] on 10 April 2010,&lt;ref name=Kosciuszko/&gt; and [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] in [[Africa]] on 14 June 2011&lt;ref name=Kilimanjaro/&gt; during the circumnavigation. Eruç still plans to climb the remaining three mountains on future journeys: [[Mount Everest]] in [[Asia]], [[Mount Elbrus]] in [[Europe]] and [[Aconcagua]] in [[South America]].&lt;ref name=ProgressReport/&gt;

By the end of his circumnavigation, Eruç had set several ocean rowing world records including the first person to row three oceans,&lt;ref name=gwr1 /&gt; the first rower to cross the [[Indian Ocean]] from Australia to mainland Africa (in two segments),&lt;ref name=gwr3/&gt; the longest distance rowed across the Indian Ocean,&lt;ref name=gwr4/&gt; and the longest distance rowed across the [[Atlantic Ocean]].&lt;ref name=gwr7/&gt;

A documentary film called ''Castaway With Purpose'' will feature Eruç's circumnavigation. The film has been in production since 2013 with no release date set.&lt;ref name=castaway /&gt;

[[File:Erciyes From Aktepe Goreme.JPG|thumb|left|Mount Erciyes in the [[Cappadocia]] region of Turkey]]
Eruç was born in [[North Nicosia|Nicosia]], [[Cyprus]]&lt;ref name=birthplace /&gt; on 14 July 1961&lt;ref name=bday /&gt; and raised in [[Turkey]].&lt;ref name=radio1 /&gt; He has been an avid [[Outdoor enthusiast|outdoorsman]] from an early age. When he was 11, his father took him for a climbing trip to [[Mount Erciyes]], an extinct [[stratovolcano]] in south central Turkey and the highest mountain in [[Central Anatolia Region|central]] [[Anatolia]] with a summit at {{convert|3916|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=bio /&gt; During his higher education years, Eruç studied [[mechanical engineering]] at [[Boğaziçi University]] in [[Istanbul]] where he earned both a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree and a [[Master of Science]] degree. In 1986, he moved to the United States where he continued his studies in engineering and [[business administration]], earning a second Master of Science degree in Engineering Mechanics at [[Ohio State University]] and an [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] degree at [[George Mason University]].&lt;ref name=resume /&gt;

When his schooling was complete, Eruç worked in various technical consulting projects in the U.S. for nine years, advancing into project management. At the age of 41 he left the corporate office world, allowing him all the time he needed to pursue a dream of far-flung outdoor adventures. His new occupation was educating and inspiring others, especially children, through the pursuit of entirely human-powered travels around the world.&lt;ref name=bio /&gt;

During his journey to [[Alaska]] to climb Mount McKinley in June 2003, Eruç married Nancy Board in a native Alaskan [[Tsimshian|Haida-Tsimshian]] ceremony on a beach near [[Homer, Alaska]], though the culture is foreign to both of them as Eruç is a Turkish [[Muslim]] while Board is an American [[Catholicism|Catholic]].&lt;ref name=news1 /&gt; Board is also an outdoor enthusiast and the acting Vice President of the ''Around-n-Over'' nonprofit organization.&lt;ref name=team1 /&gt;

==Nonprofit organization==
[[File:Great circle.png|thumb|upright|A [[great circle]] drawn on a [[sphere]]. All other circles drawn around a sphere will have a smaller circumference than a great circle. An [[arc (geometry)|arc]] (green line) drawn directly between any two points ''r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' on the surface of a sphere is part of a great circle that is formed by extending the arc completely around the sphere.]]
In December 2002, Eruç established a [[501(c) organization|501(c)(3) nonprofit organization]] called ''Around-n-Over'' based in [[Seattle]] which received [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] approval as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit entity late in 2003.&lt;ref name=calendar /&gt;&lt;ref name=npo /&gt; The ''Around-n-Over'' organization has the following mission statement: "''All for Education and Inspiration... To accomplish, to inspire and to teach... We are in the business of realizing dreams, and helping others achieve theirs.''"&lt;ref name=org /&gt;

The organization was also formed to honor fellow adventurers who had lost their lives, especially [[Göran Kropp]] who fell and died while climbing with Eruç in September 2002.&lt;ref name=mem /&gt; Additionally, ''Around-n-Over'' provides the necessary structure for handling funds for expedition expenses and charitable donations to other organizations. The Turkish ''İLKYAR Foundation'' is one such charity, which provides assistance to Turkish elementary and middle school children in rural parts of the country with a special emphasis on trying to keep girls in school. The Mateves Secondary School near Mount Kilimanjaro is also being assisted by funds donated to ''Around-n-Over''.&lt;ref name=char /&gt;

The organization's name is based on Eruç's plan of circumnavigating (going ''around'' an approximate [[great circle]] of) the Earth using only his own power and (-''n''-) also summitting (going ''over'') the highest peaks on each of the continents, excepting only [[Antarctica]].&lt;ref name=radio1 /&gt; Eruç serves as the President and Chief Exploration Officer of ''Around-n-Over''.&lt;ref name=resume /&gt;&lt;ref name=team2 /&gt;

==The rowboat==

}}

In September 2004, Eruç committed to purchasing a used and proven {{convert|7.1|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} by {{convert|1.9|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} [[Ocean rowing|oceangoing]] plywood rowboat, the same vessel which he would eventually row across three oceans to reach two more summits in his ''Six Summits Project''. The rowboat was christened ''Kaos'' by its first owners and was later renamed ''Calderdale – the Yorkshire Challenger'', or simply the ''Calderdale'', by its second owners. Before Eruç acquired it, the ''Calderdale'' had already successfully crossed the [[Atlantic Ocean]] twice with two-person teams aboard.&lt;ref name=boat /&gt; The boat is listed as the ''Around-n-Over'' on the website of ''Guinness World Records''.&lt;ref name=gwr1 /&gt; Eruç has not officially renamed the boat and still refers to it as the ''Calderdale''. He has stated that the naming rights to the rowboat are available to a willing sponsor.&lt;ref name=calderdale /&gt;&lt;ref name=sponsors /&gt;

The {{convert|250|kg|lb|abbr=on}} bare and {{convert|750|kg|lb|abbr=on}} loaded rowboat was equipped with many advanced navigational, safety and communications systems as well as a pair of 12 volt gel batteries charged by a solar panel that powered them all. The loaded rowboat contained an [[Argos system|Argos]] tracking beacon, an [[Emergency position-indicating radiobeacon station|EPIRB]] distress beacon, [[satellite phone]], [[GPS navigation device|GPS navigator]], radar [[transponder]], [[Corner reflector|radar reflector]], [[Marine VHF radio|VHF radio]], palm-size computer, one manually operated and two powered [[desalination]] units, a medical kit, a watertight cabin and a life raft with an emergency bag of supplies.&lt;ref name=boat /&gt;&lt;ref name=electronics /&gt;

When not in active use, the rowboat has been housed at the [[Thea Foss Waterway|Foss Waterway]] Seaport's [[Working Waterfront Maritime Museum]] in [[Tacoma, Washington]].&lt;ref name=calderdale /&gt;

==Initial journeys==
Prior to his successful circumnavigation of 2007 to 2012, Eruç had developed a substantially different route plan. This initial plan still began with his roundtrip bicycle ride from Seattle to Mount McKinley in Alaska from 1 February to 24 August 2003 with the summit being reached on 29 May.&lt;ref name=calendar /&gt;

Eruç had planned to row south from Seattle to South America to continue the project with a climb of Aconcagua.&lt;ref name=radio2 /&gt; On 3 October 2004, however, Eruç once again left Seattle riding his fully loaded bicycle and arrived in [[Miami]] on 25 December.&lt;ref name=calendar /&gt; He had selected Miami as a new and potentially better starting point for a circumnavigation attempt combined with the summits project. The plan at that time was to row from Miami through the [[Caribbean Sea]] and then the [[Panama Canal]] to the Pacific, row down the west coast of South America, bike to and climb Aconcagua, row to New Guinea, bike to and climb [[Puncak Jaya|Carstensz Pyramid]] (an alternate to Kosciuszko for the highest peak in [[Oceania]]), row to the Asian mainland, bike to and climb Everest, row to Africa, bike to and climb Kilimanjaro, row to the [[Middle East]], bike to and climb Elbrus, and finally row the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and Atlantic Ocean back to Miami.&lt;ref name=radio3 /&gt;

A change in plans occurred when Eruç learned about Tim Harvey, a fellow human-powered adventurer, and Harvey's desire for a way home to [[Vancouver]], [[Canada]] from Europe. Eruç contacted Harvey and had the ''Calderdale'' shipped to [[Portugal]].&lt;ref name=harvey1 /&gt; The two men began rowing from [[Lisbon]] on 16 October 2005 intending to cross the entire Atlantic Ocean together; however, conditions prevented them from rowing away from [[Las Palmas|Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]] after their arrival on 11 December. Harvey decided to go ahead with another group travelling by sailboat, thereby ending the human-powered part of his expedition but remaining emission-free since no motor was used.&lt;ref name=harvey2 /&gt; By late 2005, Eruç had considered making the entire journey a two-person rowing circumnavigation and consequently had started sending out requests for new rowing partners and sponsors. He eventually continued on alone and completed his first solo Atlantic row starting from Las Palmas on 29 January and finishing in [[Guadeloupe]] on 5 May 2006. The idea of a circumnavigation by rowboat was nearly abandoned when sponsorships and partners failed to materialize. Early in 2007, however, the ''Aktaş Group'', a Turkish transportation and construction holding company, came forward as a principal sponsor and a new solo circumnavigation plan was set in motion.&lt;ref name=calendar /&gt;

==First solo human-powered circumnavigation==
[[File:Wpdms usgs photo bodega harbor.jpg|thumb|upright|Map of Bodega Bay, California]]
In early May 2007, Eruç once again departed Seattle this time riding his bicycle to [[Tiburon, California]] on the north side of [[San Francisco Bay]]. After fighting very strong onshore winds while trying to row out of San Francisco Bay in early and mid-June, he departed instead from Bodega Bay, California on 10 July 2007.&lt;ref name=calendar /&gt; Eruç had bicycled from Tiburon to Bodega Bay while his rowboat was transported separately to the new starting point, as it was during all later segments of the journey. The intended destination for his first arrival port was [[Mooloolaba, Queensland|Mooloolaba]], which is located just north of [[Brisbane]] in Australia, after crossing the immensity of the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Eruç calculated that the straight-line distance was {{convert|6182|nmi|sigfig=3}} while rowing in the middle of the ocean, based on distances from his boat to both shores. Due to opposing winds and ocean currents during rest periods, the actual distance rowed would be longer.&lt;ref name=mooloolaba /&gt;

===Pacific Ocean to Papua New Guinea===
The rowboat proved very capable in rough seas and was only capsized once in crossing three oceans. On 20 December 2007 in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, a large rogue wave tipped the boat about 120 to 150 degrees in the estimation of Eruç. The wave hit while he was asleep in the cabin and threw him to the ceiling and then back to the floor as the boat righted itself due to its [[ballast]]. The only losses of any value from the open deck were energy gels and fluid replacement packets, with all other valuables being either tied down or stowed securely.&lt;ref name=capsize /&gt;

[[File:Balise-Argos Musee du Bourget P1010672.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.6|An Argos beacon]]
On 10 January 2008, an emergency signal was received from Eruç's [[Argos system|Argos]] tracking beacon.&lt;ref name=argos1 /&gt; A search and rescue operation was almost started when a call from Eruç was received indicating it was a false alarm.&lt;ref name=argos2 /&gt;

Unusually strong currents in the middle and western Pacific made progress south very difficult for Eruç. After his launch from Bodega Bay, [[La Niña]] conditions had developed on the Pacific. He was ultimately unable to cross the equator on his first attempt due to the opposing currents and wind patterns in the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]]. Running dangerously low on food supplies after fighting strong La Niña winds from the southeast in the early part of the main [[2008 Pacific typhoon season|typhoon season]], Eruç was effectively trapped in the northern hemisphere. He accepted assistance from [[Filipino people|Filipino]] fishermen of the ''Frabelle Fishing Corporation'' north of [[Papua New Guinea]] (PNG) on 17 May 2008. The first typhoon of that season had formed on 5 May due northwest of him and would turn into a Category-4 super typhoon named [[Typhoon Rammasun (2008)|Rammasun]]. He had reached the PNG waters near [[Ninigo Islands]] before the winds carried him offshore.&lt;ref name=psd /&gt;

Eight months later on 15 January 2009, after the typhoon season had ended, the same fishermen returned him to the exact location where they had found him. Continuing on the [[Bismarck Sea]], Eruç crossed the equator and reached [[Finschhafen|Finsch Harbor]] in PNG on 4 February. At this point, he took another break of nearly eight months to mend his injured back. Beginning on 22 September 2009 he continued on foot and by [[sea kayak]] along the [[Solomon Sea]] shores of PNG and then walked shore-to-shore from [[Oro Bay]] to [[Port Moresby]] over the historic [[Kokoda Track]] until 26 November 2009.&lt;ref name=psd /&gt;

===Australia and Mount Kosciuszko===

Departing from Port Moresby on 8 December 2009, Eruç rowed his boat{{emdash}}which had been shipped around PNG for him{{emdash}}across the [[Coral Sea]] and reached the [[Cape York Peninsula]], Australia on 10 January 2010. He sea kayaked down the coast from 28 January to 15 February 2010 until he reached [[Cooktown, Queensland|Cooktown]] where he continued by [[bicycle]] on 18 February. Eruç bicycled along the east coast toward [[Mount Kosciuszko]], the second peak of his ''Six Summits Project'', which he summitted on 10 April. He continued again by bicycle along the southern and western coastal areas of the country. After preparing and resupplying his rowboat in [[Perth]] through that June, Eruç had the rowboat shipped north to [[Carnarvon, Western Australia|Carnarvon]] as a more favorable departure point. He bicycled to Carnarvon and arrived on 7 July 2010.&lt;ref name=psd /&gt;

===Indian Ocean, Africa and Mount Kilimanjaro===
Eruç departed from Carnarvon on 13 July 2010 to cross the [[Indian Ocean]] to Africa. After three and a half months of solitary rowing, a frigate named ''TCG [[Gaziantep]]'' of the Turkish Navy rendezvoused with Eruç north of [[Madagascar]] on 30 October. Coincidentally, the frigate was named after the Turkish city where Eruç's mother had been raised, though she was born in nearby [[Kilis]]. After exchanging pleasantries and gifts via a small [[Rigid-hulled inflatable boat|zodiac boat]], the frigate continued escorting Eruç as he rowed westward until sunset that day. The area was being patrolled as part of a Combined Task Force to combat piracy and the commander of that task force, Rear Admiral Sinan Ertuğrul, was on the frigate. Ertuğrul and Eruç had been exchanging emails about his route and expected landfall in Africa, and were attempting to steer him clear of pirate activity.&lt;ref name=turkishnavy1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=turkishnavy2 /&gt;

In November 2010 as the [[2010–11 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season|cyclone season]] was starting, Eruç found that he could not continue toward the African coast because a [[Mesoscale convective vortex|mesoscale eddy]], or vortex, had formed around him and was pushing him away from the coast. He witnessed [[waterspout]]s while rowing in the [[Mozambique Channel]] and changed direction to the south-southeast reaching [[Mahajanga]] in Madagascar on 26 November without encountering any pirates. The row from Australia to Madagascar had taken about four and a half months.  Eruç took a four-month break until the cyclone season ended before rowing westward to the African coast from Mahajanga on 26 March 2011 making landfall at [[Angoche]] in Mozambique on 20 April.&lt;ref name=psd /&gt;

[[File:Kilimanjaro (paulshaffner).jpg|thumb|left|Mount Kilimanjaro]]
Eruç began bicycling across the continent twelve days later on 2 May with a side excursion to prepare for and climb [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] in [[Tanzania]], the third peak of his ''Six Summits Project'', from 8 to 15 June 2011.&lt;ref name=psd /&gt; His climbing party of more than a dozen people, including his wife and his 78-year-old father Cemal Eruç, summitted the mountain on 14 June.&lt;ref name=kilimanjaro /&gt;

While bicycling in northern Mozambique, Eruç had crashed his bicycle several times on an unexpectedly sandy road.&lt;ref name=sandyroad /&gt; On 26 June 2011, Eruç crashed over [[rumble strip]]s in Kabuku, [[Tanzania]] while avoiding a passing bus.&lt;ref name=bikecrash /&gt; His bicycle was not damaged but his GPS unit and Argos beacon were broken, his left thumb was hyperextended, and his right hip and right forearm had hit the pavement hard. After treating the wounds and taping his swollen thumb to his forefinger, Eruç continued southwestward through [[Zambia]] and [[Namibia]]. By 21 August he had reached the west coast of Africa. His rowboat had been transported, and then prepped and resupplied during a seven-week break. He departed from [[Lüderitz]], Namibia on 10 October 2011.&lt;ref name=psd /&gt;

===Atlantic Ocean and the Americas===
The crossing of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to South America lasted about five months until 11 March 2012 when Eruç reached Güiria, [[Venezuela]]. To reach a more favorable departure point for rowing, he completed a relatively short bicycle trip of {{convert|138|km|mi|abbr=on}} along the coast of Venezuela to [[Carúpano]] on 19 March. His rowboat had been moved to the port of Carúpano so he could continue from there. The final rowing segment was across the [[Caribbean Sea]] and the [[Gulf of Mexico]] to [[Cameron, Louisiana]] in the United States from 21 March to 27 May 2012. The final segment overall was a bicycle ride starting on 21 June and ending on 21 July 2012 at the same pier where he had started, in Bodega Bay, California.&lt;ref name=psd /&gt;

===Summary===
Eruç logged {{convert|66299|km|mi|abbr=on}} while rowing across three oceans{{emdash}}the Pacific, Indian and Atlantic{{emdash}}and cycling across three continents{{emdash}}Australia, Africa and North America. He became the first person to solo circumnavigate the globe entirely on his own power. He crossed the equator two times, passed over twelve pairs of antipodal points and spent five years and eleven days of his life completing the endeavor{{emdash}}the world record time for a human-powered circumnavigation.&lt;ref name=gwr2 /&gt; The total elapsed time of over five years included several long periods of downtime spent away from the route, for a total of about 26 months, with Eruç always continuing again from the exact location where he had last stopped.{{refn|name=note1|group=note|Human powered circumnavigators sometimes deviate from their track...[which] is accepted custom by these adventurers as long as the explorer returns to the point where he last stopped and continues the trip from there.&lt;ref name=advstats /&gt;}} Excluding the downtime periods, he had traveled a total of 1026 days, or about two years and ten months.&lt;ref name=outmag1 /&gt;

The remaining three mountains of the ''Six Summits Project''{{emdash}}Everest, Elbrus and Aconcagua{{emdash}}were skipped during the circumnavigation primarily due to a lower level of donations than was anticipated which led to budgetary constraints and the decision to shorten the route. Eruç's decision to bypass those mountains resulted in a route that more closely followed a great circle route than the one he had originally envisioned.&lt;ref name=psd /&gt;

To finance the expedition, Eruç and his wife had sold condominium properties in [[Washington, D.C.]] and Seattle, as well as a second car, and moved into a rental property. Eruç also withdrew the funds from his 401k retirement plan. The total spent out of the couple's own assets was approximately [[United States dollar|$]]216,000. Their organization's sponsors and donors contributed a similar amount in cash and products, including his bicycle, bike trailer and panniers, a liferaft, desalinating watermakers, energy bars and freeze dried foods.&lt;ref name=sponsors /&gt;&lt;ref name=cost /&gt;

Eruç maintained a blog of his adventure by posting dispatches on his website every few days. He was able to communicate directly with family, friends and schoolchildren in their classrooms, as well as medical and scientific experts, via a satellite phone link with email capability.&lt;ref name=dispatches /&gt;

==Audio dispatches==
Occasional technical problems caused Eruç to record audio dispatches to keep his followers up-to-date. 
All dispatches are stored on the ''humanedgetech'' website and are linked from the dispatch pages of ''Around-n-Over''.&lt;ref name=dispatches /&gt;

The following three audio dispatches were recorded between Madagascar and the African coast:

==Documentary film==
''Castaway With Purpose'' is a documentary film in production since 2013 that will feature Eruç's circumnavigation.&lt;ref name=castaway /&gt; The documentary crew will travel to some of the same places Eruç passed through, filming those places along with the people he met. The crew will then combine the new film with highlights from many hours of existing video footage, still images and journal entries created by Eruç during the five-year voyage. A [[Kickstarter]] fundraising campaign was held in the summer of 2013 to help fund the film's production. The crowdsourced fundraiser ended successfully on 18 August 2013 with 286 backers pledging a total of [[United States dollar|$]]75,041 to the project.&lt;ref name=kick /&gt;

The '''European Broadcasting Area (EBA)''' is defined by the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU) as such:

:''The "European Broadcasting Area" is bounded on the west by the western boundary of [[International Telecommunication Union region|Region 1]], on the east by the [[meridian 40° East]] of [[Greenwich meridian|Greenwich]] and on the south by the [[parallel 30° North]] so as to include the northern part of [[Saudi Arabia]] and that part of those countries bordering the [[Mediterranean]] within these limits. In addition, [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and those parts of the territories of [[Iraq]], [[Jordan]], [[Syrian Arab Republic]], [[Turkey]] and [[Ukraine]] lying outside the above limits are included in the European Broadcasting Area.''&lt;ref name="ITU-R Radio Regulation 2012"&gt;[http://www.sma.gov.jm/sites/default/files/publication_files/ITU-R_Radio_Regulations_2012_%202015_%20Article_5_Table%20of%20Frequencies.pdf ITU-R Radio Regulations (2012-2015)], International Telecommunication Union, available from the Spectrum Management Authority of Jamaica. Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia were added to the EBA at the 2007 World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC-07).&lt;/ref&gt;

The EBA includes territory outside [[Europe]], and excludes some territory that is part of the European continent. For example,
[[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] were defined as outside the EBA borders until 2007.&lt;ref name="ITU-R Radio Regulation 2004"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-s/oth/02/02/S020200001A4501PDFE.pdf|title=ITU-R Radio Regulations - Articles edition of 2004 (valid in 2004-2007)|format=PDF|publisher=''[[International Telecommunication Union]]''|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; After EBA was expanded by the 2007 World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC-07) to include those three countries,&lt;ref name="ITU-R Radio Regulation 2012"/&gt; the only ITU member state with territory in Europe while remaining outside the EBA is [[Kazakhstan]]. While Kazakhstan is excluded from EBA, it is still eligible to apply for membership of the [[Member states of the Council of Europe#Applicants|Council of Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/XRef/X2H-Xref-ViewHTML.asp?FileID=9998&amp;lang=EN|title=Situation in Kazakhstan and its Relations with the Council of Europe|publisher=Parliamentary Assembly Council of Europe|work=Document 11007: II General information, point 11|date=7 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The boundaries of the European Broadcasting Area have their origin in the regions served and linked by telegraphy cables in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The European Broadcasting Area plays a part in the definition of eligibility for active membership in the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU) and thus participation in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. As of November 2017, the European Broadcasting Union has 73 members from 56 countries, 33 associates from 21 countries, and 7 approved participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ebu.ch/about/members|title=EBU - Members|publisher=European Broadcasting Union|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fifteen volcanoes that make up the eight principal islands of [[Hawaii]] are the youngest in a chain of more than 129 volcanoes that stretch {{convert|5800|km|mi}} across the [[North Pacific Ocean]], called the [[Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain]].&lt;ref name="USGS - Evolution"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/observatories/hvo/hvo_volcano_watch.html?vwid=1143|title=Evolution of Hawaiian Volcanoes|date=September 8, 1995|work=USGS Site|publisher=USGS|accessdate=2018-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hawai{{okina}}i's volcanoes rise an average of {{convert|4572|m|ft|0}} to reach sea level from their base.&lt;ref name="SolarViews" /&gt; The largest, [[Mauna Loa]], is {{convert|4169|m|ft|0}} high.&lt;ref name="SolarViews" /&gt; As [[shield volcano]]es, they are built by accumulated lava flows, growing a few meters/feet at a time to form a broad and gently sloping shape.&lt;ref name="SolarViews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solarviews.com/eng/hawaii.htm|title=Introduction to Hawaiian Volcanoes |last=L. Hamilton|first=Rosanna|date=1995|work=Web|publisher=www.solarviews.com|accessdate=2009-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawaiian islands undergo a systematic pattern of submarine and subaerial growth that is followed by erosion. An island's stage of development reflects its distance from the [[Hawaii hotspot]].

==Background==
[[File:Hawaii hotspot.jpg|500px|right|The characteristic "V" shape, a separation between the older Emperor and newer Hawaiian sections, is easily visible in this image|thumb]]
The [[Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain]] is remarkable for its length and its number of volcanoes. The chain is split into two subsections across a break, separating the older Emperor Seamount Chain from the younger Hawaiian Ridge; the "V" shape bend of the chain is easily noticeable on maps.&lt;ref name="USGS - Evolution" /&gt; The volcanoes are progressively younger to the southeast; the oldest dated volcano, located at the northern end, is 81 million years old. The break between the two sub-chains is 43 million years; in comparison, the oldest of the principal islands, [[Kauai]], is little more than 5 million years.&lt;ref name="USGS - Evolution" /&gt;

The "assembly line" that forms the volcanoes is driven by a [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspot]], a plume of [[magma]] deep within the Earth producing [[lava]] at the surface. As the [[Pacific Plate]] moves in a west-northwest direction, each volcano moves with it away from its place of origin above the hotspot. The age and location of the volcanoes are a record of the direction, rate of movement, and orientation of the [[Pacific Plate]]. The pronounced 43-million-year-old break separating the Hawaiian Ridge from the Emperor Chain marks a dramatic change in direction of plate movement.&lt;ref name="USGS - Evolution" /&gt; Initial, deeper-water volcanic eruptions are characterized by [[pillow lava]], so named for their shape, while shallow-water eruptions tend to be composed mainly of [[volcanic ash]]. Once the volcano is high enough so as to eliminate interference from water, its lava flows become those of ropey [[pāhoehoe]] and blocky [[ʻAʻā|aa]] lava.&lt;ref name="USGS - Evolution" /&gt;

Our current understanding of the process of evolution originates from the first half of the 20th century. The understanding of the process was advanced by frequent observation of volcanic eruptions, study of contrasting rock types, and reconnaissance mapping. More recently our understanding has been aided by geophysical studies, offshore submersible studies, the advent of radioactive dating, advances in petrology and geochemistry, advanced surveillance and monitoring, and detailed geological studies.&lt;ref name="USGS-149"&gt;''USGS'', pg. 149 (digital pg. 167)&lt;/ref&gt; The ratio of [[magnesium]] to [[silica]] in the lava is a sign of what stage the volcano is in, as over time the volcano's lavas shift from [[Alkali basalt|alkalic]] to [[Tholeiitic basalt|tholeiitic]] lava, and then back to alkalic.&lt;ref name="USGS-149" /&gt;

Although volcanism and erosion are the chief factors in the growth and erosion of a volcano, other factors are also involved. Subsidence is known to occur. Changes in sea level, occurring mostly during the [[Pleistocene]], have caused drastic changes; an example is the breakup of [[Maui Nui]], initially a seven-volcano island, which was transformed into five islands as a result of subsidence. High rainfall due to the [[trade wind]] effect impacts on the severity of erosion on many of the major volcanoes. Coastline collapses, a notable part of the history of many of the Hawaiian volcanoes, are often devastating and destroy large parts of the volcanoes.&lt;ref name="USGS-149" /&gt;

==Submarine preshield stage==
[[Image:Nur05018-Pillow lavas off Hawaii.jpg|right|thumb|A photo of [[pillow lava]], the typical type of flow from submarine volcanoes.]]
[[File:Loihi 3d.gif|right|thumb|Bathymetric rendering of [[Loihi|Lō{{okina}}ihi]], the only known Hawaiian volcano that is currently still in the Pre-Shield stage.|220px]]
When a volcano is created near the Hawaiian hotspot, it begins its growth in the submarine preshield stage, characterized by infrequent, typically low volume eruptions. The volcano is steep-sided, and it usually has a defined [[caldera]] and has two or more [[rift zone]]s radiating from the summit. The type of lava erupted in this stage of activity is [[alkali]] [[basalt]].&lt;ref name="Book"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to stretching forces, the development of two or more [[rift zone]]s is common. The lava accumulates in a shallow magma storage reservoir.&lt;ref name="USGS-Poster"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geopubs.wr.usgs.gov/i-map/i2809/i2809.pdf|format=PDF|title=Hawaii's Volcanoes Revealed|work=USGS Poster|publisher=[[USGS]]|accessdate=2009-03-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041026010925/http://geopubs.wr.usgs.gov/I-map/i2809/i2809.pdf|archivedate=2004-10-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the eruptions occur with the volcano underwater, the form of lava typically erupted is [[pillow lava]]. Pillow lava is rounded balls of lava that was given very little time to cool due to immediate exposure to water. Water pressure prevents the lava from exploding upon contact with the cold ocean water, forcing it to simmer and solidify quickly. This stage is thought to last about 200,000 years, but lavas erupted during this stage make up only a tiny fraction of the final volume of the volcano.&lt;ref name="USGS - Evolution" /&gt; As time progresses, eruptions become stronger and more frequent.

The only example of a Hawaiian volcano in this stage is [[Loihi Seamount]], which is thought to be transitioning from the submarine preshield stage into the submarine phase of the shield stage.  All older volcanoes have had their preshield stage lavas buried by younger lavas, so everything that is known about this stage comes from research done on Lōihi Seamount.&lt;ref name="USGS - Evolution" /&gt;

==Shield stages==
The shield stage of the volcano is subdivided into three phases: the submarine, explosive, and sub aerial. During this stage of growth, the volcano accumulates about 95 percent of its mass and it takes on the "shield" shape that [[shield volcano]]es are named for. It is also the stage where the volcano's eruptive frequency reaches its peak.&lt;ref name="Book" /&gt;

===Submarine phase===
As eruptions become more and more frequent at the end of the preshield stage, the composition of the lava erupted from the Hawaiian volcano changes from alkalic basalt to [[tholeiitic basalt]] and the volcano enters the submarine phase of the shield stage. In this phase, the volcano continues to erupt pillow lava. Calderas form, fill, and reform at the volcano's summit and the rift zones remain prominent. The volcano builds its way up to sea level. The submarine phase ends when the volcano is only shallowly submerged.&lt;ref name="Book" /&gt;

The only example of a volcano in this stage is [[Loihi Seamount]], which is now transitioning into this phase from the preshield stage.

===Explosive phase===
[[File:Limu o Pele.jpg|220px|thumb|left|Lava bubbles explosively as it hits the cold water.]]
This volcanic phase, so named for the explosive reactions with lava that take place, begins when the volcano just breaches the surface. The pressure and instantaneous cooling of being underwater stops, replaced instead by contact with air. Lava and seawater make intermittent contact, resulting in a lot of steam.&lt;ref name="USGS - Evolution" /&gt; The change in environment also engenders a change in lava type, and the lava from this stage is mostly fragmented into volcanic ash. These explosive eruptions continue intermittently for several hundred thousand years.&lt;ref name="USGS - Evolution" /&gt; Calderas continually develop and fill, and rift zones remain prominent. The phase ends when the volcano has sufficient mass and height (about {{convert|1000|m|ft|sigfig=1}} above sea level) that the interaction between sea water and erupting lava fades away.&lt;ref name="USGS - Evolution" /&gt;

===Subaerial phase===
Once a volcano has added enough mass and height to end frequent contact with water, the sub aerial substage begins. During this stage of activity, the explosive eruptions become much less frequent and the nature of the eruptions become much more gentle. Lava flows are a combination of [[pahoehoe|pāhoehoe]] and [[Lava# aa|ʻaʻā]].&lt;ref name="USGS - Evolution" /&gt; It is during this stage, that the low-profile "[[shield]]" shape of Hawaiian volcanoes is formed, named for the shape of a warrior's shield.&lt;ref name="Book" /&gt; Eruption rates and frequencies peak, and about 95% of the volcano's eventual volume forms during a period of roughly 500,000 years.&lt;ref name="USGS - Evolution" /&gt;

The lava erupted in this stage form flows of [[pahoehoe|pāhoehoe]] or [[Lava# aa|ʻaʻā]]. During this [[subaerial]] stage, the flanks of the growing volcanoes are unstable and as a result, large [[landslide]]s may occur. At least 17 major landslides have occurred around the major Hawaiian islands. This stage is arguably the most well-studied, as all eruptions that occurred in the 20th century on the [[Hawaii (island)|island of Hawaii]] were produced by volcanoes in this phase.&lt;ref name="Book" /&gt;

[[Mauna Loa]] and [[Kilauea|Kīlauea]] volcanoes are in this phase of activity.

==Postshield stage==
[[Image:Hawaiian Eruption-numbers.svg|thumb|right|260px|Hawaiian eruption: 1: Ash plume, 2: Lava fountain, 3: Crater, 4: Lava lake, 5: Fumaroles, 6: Lava flow, 7 Layers of lava and ash, 8: Stratum, 9: Sill, 10: Magma conduit, 11: Magma chamber, 12: Dike]]
[[File:Hualalai from north.jpg|right|260px|The dark outline of [[Hualālai]], showing the worn and weathered shape of a volcano in the Post-shield stage.|thumb]]

As the volcano reaches the end of the shield stage, the volcano goes through another series of changes as it enters the postshield stage. The type of lava erupted changes from tholeiitic basalt back to alkalic basalt and eruptions become slightly more explosive.&lt;ref name="Book" /&gt; Results from the [[Hawaii Scientific Drilling Project]] confirm that the eruption rates of the postshield stage volcanoes started decreasing between 600 and 400 thousand years (ka) ago.&lt;ref name="PowerPoint Prez"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mantleplumes.org/Chapman/ChapmanPresentations/rhodes_chapman.ppt|title=Geochemical Arguments Favoring a Hawaiian Plume|first=J. Michael|last1=Rhodes|first2=Michael O.|last2=Garcia|first3=Marc|last3=Norman|work=PowerPoint Presentation|publisher=University of Massachusetts, University of British Columbia, University of Hawaii, Australian National University|accessdate=2009-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eruptions in the postshield stage cap the volcano with a carapace of lava, containing low silica and high alkali contents, the reverse of the stage before it. Some Hawaiian volcanoes diverge from this, however. Lava is erupted as stocky, pasty [[ʻAʻā|aa]] flows along with a lot of [[cinder]].&lt;ref name="USGS - Evolution" /&gt; Caldera development stops, and the rift zones become more inactive. The new lava flows increase the slope grade, as the aā never reaches the base of the volcano. These lavas commonly fill and overflow the [[caldera]].&lt;ref name="USGS - Evolution" /&gt; Eruption rate gradually decreases over a period of [[ca.]] 250,000 years, eventually stopping altogether as the volcano becomes [[dormant volcano|dormant]].&lt;ref name="USGS - Evolution" /&gt;

[[Mauna Kea]], [[Hualālai]], and [[Haleakalā]] volcanoes are in this stage of activity.

==Erosional stage==
After the volcano becomes dormant, the forces of [[erosion]] gain control of the mountain. The volcano subsides into the oceanic [[Crust (geology)|crust]] due to its immense weight and loses elevation. Meanwhile, rain also erodes the volcano, creating deeply incised valleys. [[Coral reef]]s grow along the shoreline. The volcano becomes a skeleton of its former self.&lt;ref name="Book" /&gt;

[[Kohala (mountain)|Kohala]], [[Mahukona]], [[Lanai]], and [[Waianae Range|Waianae]] volcanoes are examples of volcanoes in this stage of development.

==Rejuvenated stage==
After a long period of dormancy and erosion of the surface, the volcano may become active again, entering a final stage of activity called the rejuvenated stage. During this stage, the volcano erupts small volumes of lava very infrequently. These eruptions are often spread out over several millions of years.&lt;ref name="USGS - Evolution" /&gt; The composition of the lavas erupted in this stage is usually alkalic. The stage commonly occurs between 0.6 and 2 million years after it has entered the weathering cycle.&lt;ref name="Garcia-2005"&gt;{{cite paper| first =  Michael O.| last = Garcia |first2=Jackie|last2=Caplan-Auerbanch|first3=Eric H.|last3=De Carlo|first4=M.D.|last4=Kurz|first5=N.|last5=Becker| title = Geology, geochemistry and earthquake history of Lōihi Seamount, Hawaii| version = This is the author's personal version of a paper that was published on 2006-05-16 as "Geochemistry, and Earthquake History of Lōʻihi Seamount, Hawaii's youngest volcano", in ''Chemie der Erde – Geochemistry'' (66) 2:81–108 | publisher = [[SOEST]] | date = 2005-09-20 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009281905000723 | format = [[Portable Document Format|PDF]]| accessdate = 2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Koolau Range]], [[West Maui Mountains|West Maui]], and [[Kahoolawe]] volcanoes are examples of volcanoes in this stage of development. Note, however, that because in this stage eruptions are very infrequent (occurring thousands or even tens of thousands of years apart), erosion is still the primary factor controlling the volcano's development.

==Extinct stage==
After the rejuvenated stage, the volcano is too far away from the hotspot to receive new magma, and therefore will never erupt again. The volcano continues to sink into the ocean, and become deeply eroded, leading to infrequent, but large collapses in its original structure. The volcano has no remaining magma in its chambers, and is truly dead.

[[West Molokai Volcano|West Molokai]], [[Waialeale]], and [[Niihau]] volcanoes are in this stage of development.

==Coral atoll stage==
[[File:Coral atoll formation animation.gif|400px|thumb|Right|An animated sequence showing the erosion and subsidence of a volcano, and the formation of a [[coral reef]] around it – eventually resulting in an [[atoll]].]]
Eventually, erosion and subsidence break the volcano down to sea level. At this point, the volcano becomes an atoll, with a ring of [[coral]] and sand islands surrounding a [[lagoon]]. All the Hawaiian islands west of the [[Gardner Pinnacles]] in the [[Northwestern Hawaiian Islands]] are in this stage.

==Guyot stage==
Atolls are the product of the growth of tropical [[marine organism]]s, so these [[island]]s are only found in warm [[Tropical|tropical waters]]. Eventually, the [[Pacific Plate]] carries the volcanic atoll into waters too cold for these marine organisms to maintain a reef by growth.&lt;ref name="USGS - Evolution" /&gt; Volcanic islands located beyond the warm water temperature requirements of [[Reef|reef building organisms]] become seamounts as they subside and are eroded away at the surface. An island that is located where the ocean [[Temperature|water temperatures]] are just sufficiently warm for upward [[Reef|reef growth]] to keep pace with the rate of subsidence is said to be at the [[Atoll|Darwin Point]].&lt;ref name="Book" /&gt; Islands in more northerly [[latitude]]s evolve towards seamounts or guyots; islands closer to the [[equator]] evolve towards atolls (see [[Kure Atoll]]).

After the reef dies, the volcano subsides or erodes below sea level and becomes a coral-capped seamount. These flat-topped seamounts are called [[guyot]]s. Most, if not all, the volcanoes west of Kure Atoll as well as most, if not all, the volcanoes in the [[Emperor Seamount]] chain are guyots or [[seamount]]s.&lt;ref name="Book" /&gt;

==Other patterns==
Not all Hawaiian volcanoes go through all of these stages of activity. An example is [[Koolau Range]] on [[Oahu|O{{okina}}ahu]], which was prehistorically devastated by a cataclysmic [[landslide]], never underwent the postshield stage and went dormant for hundreds of thousands of years after the shield stage before coming back to life. Some volcanoes never made it above sea level; there is no evidence to suggest that [[West Molokai]] ever went through the rejuvenated stage, while its younger neighbors, [[East Molokai]] and [[West Maui]], have evidently done so. It is currently unknown what stage of development the submerged volcano of [[Penguin Bank]] is in.&lt;ref name="Book" /&gt;

==Application to other groups==
In recent years research at other seamounts, for instance [[Jasper Seamount]], has confirmed that the Hawaiian model applies to other seamounts as well.&lt;ref name="ocea-jasper"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Jasper G.|last1=Konter|first2=Hubert|last2=Staudigel|first3=Jeffry|last3=Gee|title=Spotlight 2: Jasper Seamount|journal=[[Oceanography (journal)|Oceanography]]|volume=23|series=Seamounts Special Issue|issue=1|url=http://www.tos.org/oceanography/issues/issue_archive/issue_pdfs/23_1/23-1_konter.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=28 July 2010|publisher=[[Oceanography Society]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613134055/http://www.tos.org/oceanography/issues/issue_archive/issue_pdfs/23_1/23-1_konter.pdf|archivedate=13 June 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

B. (2009). [http://www.nepjol.info/index.php/BANKO/article/view/2206 ''Wise use of Wetlands in Nepal''] Banko Janakari, Special Issue February 2009: 10–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The lake melts and sips down to form the [[Trishuli River]] and remains frozen for six months in winter October to June. There are 108 lakes in this area, small to medium in size. The challenging Lauribina La at an altitude of {{convert|4610|m|ft|abbr=on}} is on its outskirts.

== Religious significance ==
The Gosaikunda area has been delineated as a religious site. [[Hindu mythology]] attributes Gosaikunda as the abode of the [[Hindu deities]] [[Shiva]] and [[Parvati|Gauri]]. The Hindu scriptures [[Bhagavata Purana]], [[Vishnu Purana]] and the epics [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]] refer to [[Samudra manthan]], which is directly related to the origin of Gosaikunda. Its waters are considered holy and of particular significance during the Gangadashahara and the Janai Purnima festivals when thousands of pilgrims from Nepal and India visit the area.&lt;ref name="nbrb2007"/&gt;
Gosaikunda is believed to have been created by Lord Shiva when he thrust his [[Trishula|Trishul]] (holy [[Trident]]) into a mountain to extract water so that he could cool his stinging throat after he had swallowed poison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tourism.gov.np|title=Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation - Government of Nepal|website=www.tourism.gov.np|access-date=2016-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tourism and trekking==
Gosaikunda is a significant place of interest on the [[Dhunche]]-[[Helambu]] trekking route. This trek adjoins the famous [[Langtang]] Valley trek in the same district. Both treks can be combined. Basic accommodation is quite easily available. Tea houses offer a variety of food and snacks.

The trek to Gosaikunda starts in [[Dhunche]] Village or [[Syabru Besi]] in the Langtang Himal, or in Sundarijal in the [[Kathmandu Valley]].
When starting from Dhunche, the first day involves a long steady climb to reach Chandan Bari at an altitude of about {{convert|3200|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Laurebinayak at about {{convert|3700|m|ft|abbr=on}} can be reached on the second day. At this point, some trekkers choose to climb ahead to Gosaikunda, though [[altitude sickness]] is a concern as the ascent is rather steep. Many trekkers choose to stay at Laurebinayak, which also provides sunset and sunrise views of the Langtang and [[Ganesh Himal]]. The descent from Gosaikund to Sundarijal (सुन्दरीजल) takes about four days and involves a short climb to Laurebina La at {{convert|4610|m|ft|abbr=on}}, a rapid descent to Phedi and onwards to Ghopte. Depending on pace, there are options to stay at Thadepati, Mangengoth, Kutumsang and at many villages farther downhill. The trails are well marked, except between Ghopte and Thadepati.

Of [[Armenia]]n descent, he was born in [[Batumi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] {{clarify|date=August 2014}}. As a child, he lived with his family in England and attended British schools. Later, in the 1930s, he attended a special school for American expats in Moscow where he acquired familiarity with Americans.&lt;ref name=CSM&gt;{{cite web|last=Thatcher|first=Gary|title=Comrade Joe Adamov tells it all to you|work=[[Christian Science Monitor]]|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/1986/0709/oadam.html|date=July 9, 1986|access-date=August 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a graduate of [[Moscow State Pedagogical University]].&lt;ref name=VORobit&gt;{{cite web|title=Joe Adamov Passed Away|publisher=[[Voice of Russia]] |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051221052622/http://www.vor.ru/English/JAdamov.html|date=December 21, 2005|access-date=August 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An expert [[English language|English-speaker]] who spoke with a neutral American accent, Adamov joined Radio Moscow as an announcer at the foreign language service of Radio Moscow in 1942.&lt;ref name=VORobit /&gt; He lived in [[Moscow]] during most of his career.

[[File:Joe Adamov.jpg|thumb|left|Joe Adamov in a Radio Moscow staff meeting]]
Among English-speaking listeners, he is best known as the presenter of the programme ''Moscow Mailbag'' on Radio Moscow's North American shortwave broadcasts. The program answered questions from listeners on all aspects of Soviet life and the [[USSR]]'s policies. At its height, ''Moscow Mailbag'' listeners sent Adamov thousands of letters yearly.&lt;ref name=CSM /&gt; In his capacity as a Radio Moscow journalist and presenter of ''Moscow Mailbag'', Adamov conducted interviews with many western politicians and journalists, including [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], [[Eleanor Roosevelt]],  [[Walter Cronkite]] and [[Larry King]].

During the [[Cold War]], Adamov's broadcasts, like all other Radio Moscow output, were carefully studied by Western governments, a fact of which the Soviet authorities were well aware. Joe Adamov presented ''Moscow Mailbag'' from 1957 until shortly before his death, when ill-health forced him to relinquish the role permanently. The program remains on the air with different presenters.

Joe Adamov was also the official Soviet translator at the trial of [[Gary Powers]], shot down in a [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] spy plane in 1960.

The signature poem of Moscow Mailbag was:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
You can't do better
than send us that letter
and in it tell Joe
what you think of his show
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Adamov's death was reported on Voice of Russia's English-language news bulletins on December 21, 2005, although neither these bulletins nor the obituary on their website gave an exact date of death.&lt;ref name=VORobit /&gt;

'''Leonid Teliga''' (28 May 1917 &amp;ndash; 21 May 1970) was a [[Poland|Polish]] sailor, writer, journalist, translator and the first [[Poles|Pole]] to single-handedly [[circumnavigation|circumnavigate]] the globe on his [[yawl]] ''Opty''.

==Life==

===Youth===
Although he was born in [[Russia]], his parents decided to settle back in Poland after it regained independence. He was raised in [[Grodzisk Mazowiecki]].  After failing to get into medical studies, he decided to attend military academy.  In 1937, he finished a yachting course in [[Jastarnia]].

===During and after World War II===
During the [[September Campaign]] Teliga fought in 44th Infantry Regiment, and was wounded at [[Battle of Tomaszów Mazowiecki|Tomaszów Mazowiecki]]. In 1940, he arrived in [[Azov]], where he took a skipper course and became a fisherman. Eventually, he took part in the evacuation of harbours on [[Crimea]]. In 1942, he joined the newly-formed [[Anders Army]], established in the [[Soviet Union]] and made up mainly of Polish [[POW]]s, with which he got through to Great Britain. After taking a [[Air navigation|navigation]] course in [[Canada]], he fought as a [[Air gunner|gunner]] in the [[No. 300 Polish Bomber Squadron|No. 300 Squadron]], a unit of the [[Polish Air Forces in Great Britain]].

Teliga returned to Poland in 1947. He used every occasion to return to the sea, sometimes as a skipper or sailing instructor, later as a journalist. In the 50s and 60s, he published several short stories collections and novels based on his various voyages. In 1957, Teliga went to [[North Korea]] to participate in the works of UN Armistice Commission.

===Circumnavigation of the Earth===
[[File:Opty w CKWS A 1468.jpg|thumb|Sailing yacht Opty - boat of Leonid Teliga, the first Pole who single-handedly circumnavigated the globe. Presently on exhibition in [[Shipwreck Conservation Centre]] in Tczew]]
The yacht ''Opty'' was designed by engineer Leon Tumiłowicz, based on his earlier construction, the ''Tuńczyk'' class, but modified so that it would better fit the task of long, solitary cruise. ''Tuńczyk''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s predecessor, the ''Konik Morski'' type, was  actually the first Polish seagoing construction, designed back in 1936. The construction of ''Opty'' began in January 1966, and finished in October. Although he received some support from Polish Yachting Association and other sources, Teliga funded the construction mostly on his own. Even though masts and booms were wooden, the yacht was farily well equipped, as it had a pneumatic raft, a plastic boat for easier communication with the coast, and a wide set of sails for every kind of wind.

After having ''Opty'' transported to [[Casablanca]], Teliga began his journey on 25 January 1967, heading west. During the course of the cruise, he visited [[Canary Islands]], [[Lesser Antilles]], [[Panama Canal]], [[Galápagos Islands]], [[Marquesas Islands]], [[Tahiti]], [[Bora Bora]], [[Fiji]] and [[Dakar]]. In Panama Canal, he experienced an unexpected delay as it took eleven days to persuade the Canal's administration to let him pass. Most likely that was the reason for him to skip Australia and do the final section of the circumnavigation without any landings, as after failing to get Australian visa he expected similar obstructions there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Samotny rejs "Opty" |last= Teliga |first= Leonid |year= 1973 |publisher= Wydawnictwo Morskie |isbn= |pages=302–304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his journey, Teliga became fairly well known, and acquired honorary membership of several yacht clubs. He experienced a hospitable welcome in nearly every port, and, incidentally, met compatriots in most of them.

By cruising non-stop from Fiji to Dakar for 165 days, he beat the world record previously held by [[Bernard Gilboy]], who sailed single-handedly for 163 days in an attempt to cross the Pacific Ocean. However, when Teliga landed in Dakar on 9 January 1969, [[Robin Knox-Johnston]] has already been at sea for 210 days.

On 5 April 1969, he crossed his course from 1967, finishing the circumnavigation. It took him "2 years, 13 days, 21 hours and 15 minutes"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Samotny rejs "Opty" |last= Teliga |first= Leonid |year= 1973 |publisher= Wydawnictwo Morskie |isbn= |pages=411}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to rapidly developing cancer, Teliga was forced to stop in Casablanca. He was transported back to Poland by plane.  Despite having an operation, he died in May 1970.

[[File:Liberation route logo.jpg|thumb|Liberation Route Europe logo]]

'''Liberation Route Europe''' is an international remembrance trail that connects the main regions along the advance of the Western Allied Forces during the [[End of World War II in Europe|liberation of Europe]] and final stage of the [[World War II|Second World War]]. The route started in 2008 as a Dutch regional initiative in the [[Arnhem-Nijmegen Metropolitan Area|Arnhem-Nijmegen]] area and then developed into a transnational route that was officially inaugurated in [[Arromanches-les-Bains|Arromanches]] on June 6, 2014 during the [[Normandy]] [[Normandy landings|D-day]] commemorations. The route goes from [[Southern England]] through [[France]], [[Belgium]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Netherlands|the Netherlands]] to [[Berlin]], [[Germany]] and then extends to the [[Czech_Republic|Czech Republic]] and [[Poland]]. The southern route starts in [[Italy]]. As a form of remembrance tourism LRE aims to unfold these Allied offensives of 1944 and 1945 in one narrative combining the different perspectives and points of view. By combining locations with personal stories of people who fought and suffered, it gives visitors the opportunity to follow the Allied march and visit significant sites from [[War grave|war cemeteries]] to museums and monuments but also events and commemorations.

== The Route ==
[[File:Heinkel He 111 during the Battle of Britain.jpg|thumb]]

=== Great Britain ===
After the [[Battle of France|fall of France in 1940]] and their own defeat on the continent, the British troops regrouped and took the air to defend their island, known as the [[Battle of Britain]]. The route starts in [[London]] and here goes through [[Kent]] ([[Operation Fortitude|Operation Fortitude South]], [[Operation Pluto]] and [[Dunkirk evacuation|Operation Dynamo]]) and [[Hampshire]] (where [[Operation Overlord]] was prepared).

==== Normandy ====
During [[Operation Overlord]], the largest amphibious assault in history, [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] landed on five beaches along a 50-mile stretch of [[Normandy landings|Normandy coast on D-Day]]. This operation marked the start of the [[End of World War II in Europe|liberation]] of Western Europe. The route here comprises the 5 landing beaches: [[Sword Beach]] (from [[Ouistreham]] to [[Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer, Calvados|Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer]]), [[Gold Beach]] (between [[Port-en-Bessin-Huppain|Port-en-Bessin]]  and [[La Rivière-Saint-Sauveur|La Rivière]]), [[Utah Beach]] (Sainte-Marie-du-Mont), [[Omaha Beach]] (from [[Sainte-Honorine-des-Pertes]] to [[Vierville-sur-Mer]]), [[Juno Beach]] (from [[Courseulles-sur-Mer|Courseulles]] to [[Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer, Calvados|Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer]]) along with [[Pointe du Hoc]] ([[Cricqueville-en-Bessin|Criqueville-en-Bessin]]), [[Ranville]] (British Airlandings) or [[Longues-sur-Mer]] ([[Longues-sur-Mer battery|German Battery]]).

The following [[Normandy Campaign|Battle of Normandy]] resulted not only in the deaths of tens of thousands of soldiers, but also many French civilians. Almost all of the larger cities in the region were badly damaged.

==== Paris ====
An uprising of the population against the Germans on August 19 forced the Allies to send troops to [[Liberation of Paris|liberate Paris]], while it was not a priority. The [[2nd Armored Division (France)|2nd French Armoured Division]] entered Paris on the evening of August 24. The capitulation was signed on the [[Île de la Cité]], and the German troops surrendered at the Montparnasse train station.  Two days later a triumphal parade led by [[Charles de Gaulle|General Charles de Gaulle]] was held on the [[Champs-Élysées|Champs-Elysées]].

Some aquarium fish and invertebrates also eat live plants. Hobby [[aquarist]]s use aquatic plants for [[aquascaping]].

Brackish plants are known to occur in brackish water.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wetwebmedia.com/brackishsubwebindex/bracplants.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list of countries''' by total [[energy consumption]] per capita. This is not the consumption of end-users but all energy needed as input to produce fuel and electricity for end-users. It is known as [[total primary energy supply]] (TPES), a term used to indicate the sum of production and imports subtracting exports and storage changes (see also [[Worldwide energy supply]]). 
Numbers are from The World Bank - World Development Indicators.&lt;ref name=wb2 /&gt;

The data is given in [[kilogramme of oil equivalent|kilogrammes of oil equivalent]] per year, and [[gigajoule]]s per year, and in watts, as average equivalent power.
;Notes on conversions: 
* 1 [[Kilogram oil equivalent|kg of oil equivalent]] (kgoe) = 11.63 kWh or 1 kWh = 0.08598 kgoe&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.unitjuggler.com/convert-energy-from-koe-to-kWh.html?val=10000 convertenergy from  koe to kWh]&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1000 kgoe = 42 GJ
* 1 GJ/a = 31.7 W average
* 1 W average = 8.76 kWh per year (365 × 24 Wh per year)

* [[Eastring]], an alternative to the [[South Stream]], via [[Slovakia]], [[Bulgaria]] and [[Romania]], for transport from the [[Black Sea]], [[Caspian Sea]], and [[Middle East]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eastring.eu http://www.eastring.eu/page.php?page=downloads. retrieved feb 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[South Caucasus Pipeline]], through [[Turkey]] to [[Erzurum]]. Runs parallel to the [[Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline|Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan]] oil pipeline.

Planned pipelines for transport from Azerbaijan and Middle East:
* [[Southern Gas Corridor]], (planned). To supply gas also from the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] and [[Middle Eastern]] regions. Consists of:
** [[Interconnector Turkey–Greece–Italy]], (ITGI);
** [[Greece-Italy pipeline]] (Poseidon pipeline), part of the [[Interconnector Turkey–Greece–Italy]];
** [[Trans-Adriatic Pipeline]], from (Azerbaijan), via [[Greece]], [[Albania]] to [[Italy]] and further to Western Europe.
* [[Trans-Anatolian gas pipeline]] (TANAP) (planned) through [[Turkey]], Greece, Albania to Italy. to Europe. The exact route of the pipeline is not clear. However, it was announced that one branch from Turkey would go to Greece and the other to Bulgaria. It would be connected with [[Trans Adriatic Pipeline]].
* [[Qatar-Turkey pipeline]] (proposed).

A lecture was held at [[The Institute of World Politics]] to consider the economic and geopolitics of the rival pipelines and what's at stake for the concerned parties, namely TANAP and South Stream's replacement [[Turkish Stream]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reiff|first1=Harrison|title=Vilen Khlgatyan discusses the rival gas pipeline projects in Europe|url=http://www.iwp.edu/news_publications/detail/vilen-khlgatyan-discusses-the-rival-gas-pipeline-projects-in-europe|website=The Institute of World Politics|publisher=The Institute of World Politics|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Somaliland}}

The '''Ministry of Energy &amp; Minerals''', also '''Ministry of Energy, Oil and Mineral ''' is one of the governmental bodies of Somaliland. The ministry has the function of developing and implementing policies related to electricity, minerals, petroleum and petroleum products.

==Scope of activities==

===Energy Sector Operations===

*DFID Somaliland is initiating a new five-year programme (2014-2019) to improve access to electricity with the introduction of Mini hybrid grids in Somaliland. The programme will be implemented in two phases&lt;ref&gt;http://moem-sl.com/energy-directorate/&lt;/ref&gt;
*ADRA Somaliland is launching a new three-year project (2015-2017) to contribute to poverty alleviation, fragility reduction, and climate change mitigation for rural an peri-urban people in Somaliland.

==Somaliland Oil Blocks==
[[File:MAP-OF-BLOCK-1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Somaliland Oil Blocks.]]

===[[Genel Energy]]===
In August 2012, Genel was awarded an exploration licence for onshore blocks SL-10-B and SL-13 in Somaliland, with a 75% working interest in both. Genel extended its presence in November 2012 with the acquisition of 50% participating interest in the Odewayne Production Sharing Agreement which covers blocks SL-6, SL-7, SL-10A.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.genelenergy.com/operations/exploration-assets/somaliland/&lt;/ref&gt;

Onshore Somaliland is a relatively unexplored region, with few exploration wells drilled. The total size of the blocks is approximately equivalent to the entire Kurdistan Region of Iraq.

Genel took the opportunity because of encouraging indications including onshore oil seeps and existing geological data showing favourable conditions for hydrocarbons to have accumulated in numerous large tilted fault blocks and sub-basins. In addition, the basins of Somaliland were contiguous to Yemen prior to the opening of the Gulf of Aden in the Oligocene-Miocene - similar sedimentary sequences and structural styles are expected in Somaliland.

We are targeting resources of over 1,000 mmbbls in blocks SL-10B and SL-13. The Odewayne block has a similar resource potential to this, targeting in order of 1,000 mmbbls.

Gravity and aeromag has been acquired and interpreted over the entire 40,000 square km acreage.

===[[DNO ASA]]===
Oslo, 8 September 2014 - DNO ASA, the Norwegian oil and gas operator, today announced that it has been granted a two-year extension of the term of its production sharing agreement for Block SL18 in Somaliland. The first exploration period will now end on 8 November 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dno.no/en/investor-relations/announcements/2014/dno-asa-dno-granted-somaliland-extension/&lt;/ref&gt;

Block SL18, in which DNO has a 50 percent stake as operator, is a frontier exploration block. The partners have completed field survey and environmental assessment studies over the block and will initiate a planned seismic acquisition program once the Government of Somaliland has put in place a planned Oil Protection Unit (OPU) to support the international oil companies operating in Somaliland. The OPU is expected to be operational in 2015.

In the interim, security conditions permitting, DNO will resume a development program focused on drilling water wells to provide local communities in the areas covered by Block SL18 with potable water.

'''Mount Ebal''' ({{lang-ar|جبل عيبال}} ''Jabal ‘Aybāl''; {{lang-he-n|הר עיבל}} ''Har ‘Eival'') is one of the two mountains in the immediate vicinity of the city of [[Nablus]] in the [[West Bank]] ([[Bible|biblical]] ''[[Shechem]]''), and forms the northern side of the valley in which Nablus is situated, the southern side being formed by [[Mount Gerizim]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblicalstudies.info/top10/ebal-from-east-tb.gif Photograph of the southern face of the mountain]&lt;/ref&gt; The mountain is one of the highest peaks in the West Bank and rises to {{convert|940|m|abbr=on}} above [[sea level]], some {{convert|60|m|abbr=on}} higher than Mount Gerizim.&lt;ref name="Sturgis"/&gt; Mount Ebal is approximately {{convert|17|km2|abbr=on}} in area,&lt;ref name="Sturgis"/&gt; and is composed primarily of limestone.&lt;ref name="Cheyne"&gt;Cheyne and Black, ''[[Encyclopedia Biblica]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The slopes of the mountain contain several large caverns which were probably originally quarries,&lt;ref name="Cheyne"/&gt; and at the base towards the north are several tombs.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"&gt;''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biblical account==
In advance of the [[Israelites|Israelites']] entry to the [[Promised Land]], {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|11:29|HE}} records [[Moses|Moses']] direction that "when the Lord your God has brought you into the land which you go to possess, that you shall put the blessing on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal".

In the [[masoretic text]] and the [[Septuagint]] version of [[Deuteronomy]] 27, an instruction is given to build an [[Altar (Bible)|altar]] on Mount Ebal, constructed from natural (rather than cut) stones, to place stones there and whiten them with lime,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|27:4-6|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt; to make [[korban|peace offerings on the altar]], eat there, and write the words of ''this law'' on the stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|27:4-8,29|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Samaritan Pentateuch]] version, this instruction actually concerns [[Mount Gerizim]], which the [[Samaritan]]s view as a holy site;&lt;ref name="Peake"/&gt; some scholars believe that the Samaritan version is probably more accurate in this respect, the compilers of the masoretic text and authors of the Septuagint being likely to be biased against the Samaritans.&lt;ref name="Peake"/&gt; Recent [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] work supports the accuracy of the Samaritan Pentateuch's designation of Mount Gerizim rather than Mount Ebal as the sacred site.&lt;ref&gt;Charlesworth, James H. [http://blogs.owu.edu/magazine/2012/07/16/the-discovery-of-an-unknown-dead-sea-scroll-the-original-text-of-deuteronomy-27/ ''The Discovery of an Unknown Dead Sea Scroll: The Original Text of Deuteronomy 27?''] ''OWU Magazine''; 2012/07/16&lt;/ref&gt;

An instruction immediately subsequent to this orders that, once this is done, the Israelites should split into two groups, one to stay on Mount Ebal and pronounce curses, while the other goes to Mount Gerizim and pronounces blessings.&lt;ref name="Deu_27_11_13"&gt;Deuteronomy 27:11-13&lt;/ref&gt; The tribes of [[Tribe of Simeon|Simeon]], [[Tribe of Levi|Levi]], [[Tribe of Judah|Judah]], [[Tribe of Issachar|Issachar]], [[Tribe of Joseph|Joseph]] and [[Tribe of Benjamin|Benjamin]] were to be sent to Gerizim, while those of [[Tribe of Reuben|Reuben]], [[Tribe of Gad|Gad]], [[Tribe of Asher|Asher]], [[Tribe of Zebulun|Zebulun]], [[Tribe of Dan|Dan]] and [[Tribe of Naphtali|Naphtali]], were to remain on Ebal.&lt;ref name="Deu_27_11_13"/&gt; No attempts to explain this division of tribes either by their Biblical [[ethnology]] or by their geographical distribution have been generally accepted in academic circles.&lt;ref name="Peake"&gt;''Peake's commentary on the Bible''&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, however, some argue that the tribes were divided as equally as possible given the population's census data given in the Book of Numbers. Specifically, the division found in the book of Deuteronomy is the most equal out of 462 possible divisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Christensen |first1=Duane |title=Deuteronomy 21:10-34:12, Volume 6B |page=24 (citation to original source)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Broyde/Weiner |first1=Michael/Steven |title=A MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS OF THE DIVISION OF THE TRIBES AND THE ROLE OF THE LEVITES ON GRIZIM AND AVAL IN DEUTERONOMY 27 |journal=Tradition |date=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The text goes on to list twelve curses, which were to be pronounced by the [[Levite]] priesthood and answered by the people with ''[[Amen]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Deuteronomy 15-26&lt;/ref&gt; These ''curses'' heavily resemble laws (e.g. ''cursed be he who removes his neighbour's landmark''), and they are not followed by a list of blessings described in a similarly liturgical framework; scholars believe that these more likely represent what was written on the stones, and that the later list of six explicit blessings,&lt;ref&gt;Deuteronomy 28:3-6&lt;/ref&gt; six near-corresponding explicit curses,&lt;ref&gt;Deuteronomy 28:16-19&lt;/ref&gt; were originally in this position in the text.&lt;ref name="Peake"/&gt; The present position of these explicit blessings and curses, within a larger narrative of promise, and a far larger narrative of threat (respectively), is considered to have been an editorial decision for the post-exilic second version of Deuteronomy (''Dtr2''), to reflect the [[deuteronomist]]'s worldview after the [[Babylonian Captivity|Babylonian exile]] had occurred.&lt;ref name="Peake"/&gt;

In the [[Book of Joshua]], after the Battle of [[Ai (Bible)|Ai]], Joshua built an altar of unhewn stones there, the Israelites then made peace offerings on it, the ''[[Law of Moses]]'' was written onto the stones, and the Israelites split into the two groups specified in Deuteronomy and pronounced blessings and cursings as instructed there.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua 8:31-35&lt;/ref&gt; There is some debate between [[textual criticism|textual scholars]] as to whether this incident in Joshua is one account or spliced together two different accounts, where one account refers to Joshua building an altar, and making sacrifices on it, while the other account refers to Joshua placing large stone slabs there that had been whitened with lime and then had the ''[[Torah]]'' inscribed on them.&lt;ref&gt;''Jewish Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt; Either way there is general agreement that the sources of Joshua predate Deuteronomy, and hence that the order to build the altar and make the inscription is likely based on these actions in the sources of Joshua, rather than the other way round, possibly to provide an [[aetiology]] for the site acceptable to the deuteronomist's theology.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Elliott Friedman]], ''Who wrote the Bible''; ''Jewish Encyclopedia'', ''Book of Joshua'', ''Deuteronomy''&lt;/ref&gt;

Much later in the Book, when Joshua was old and dying, he gathered the people together at [[Shechem]], and gave a farewell speech, and then wrote ''these words in the book of the Torah of God, and took a great stone, and set it under the doorpost which is in the sanctuary of the Lord''.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua 24:1-27&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the way in which the sources of Joshua were spliced together, this may just be another version of the earlier narrative Joshua placing the whitened stones slabs with the ''Torah'' inscribed on them, and some scholars believe that this narrative may have originally been in an earlier location within the Book of Joshua.&lt;ref name="Peake"/&gt;

In the Biblical narrative, the ''[[terebinth]]'', seemingly next to the sanctuary, was evidently in existence as early as the time of the [[Biblical Patriarchs|Patriarchs]], as [[Jacob]] is described in the [[Book of Genesis]] as having buried the idols of ''strange gods'' (belonging to his uncle Laban) beneath it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bible.cc/genesis/35-4.htm Genesis 35:4 ]&lt;/ref&gt; According to a [[midrash]], one of these idols, in the shape of a [[dove]], was later recovered by the Samaritans, and used in their worship on Mount Gerizim.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Jewish Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeology==

The higher part of the mountain, on the west, contains the ruins of some massive walls called ''Al-Kal'ah'', and east of this are other ruins now called ''Kunaisah''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; However, potentially much more significant remains have been found on the northern side.

Like many other sites in the region, by the 20th century there was a large stone heap found on Mount Ebal; this one was known to locals as ''el Burnat'' ([[Arabic]] for ''the Hat''), and was found by [[Adam Zertal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.haifa.ac.il/~archlgy/staff/cv_zertal.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090629062617/http://research.haifa.ac.il/~archlgy/staff/cv_zertal.html |archivedate=2009-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; within a naturally shaped ''[[amphitheatre]]''.&lt;ref name=Sturgis&gt;Matthew Sturgis, ''It aint necessarily so'', {{ISBN|0-7472-4510-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon archaeological investigation, several [[potsherd]]s were found among this heap, and were dated to 1220-1000BC, a date for which no other remains are found nearby,&lt;ref name=Sturgis/&gt; and so a more substantial archaeological excavation was launched at the site in 1987.&lt;ref name=Sturgis/&gt; The excavation found a large walled structure, seemingly built direct into the bedrock without a doorway or floor, and had been infilled by layers of stone, ash, and earth;&lt;ref name=Sturgis/&gt; on the southwest were found two paved areas split apart by a further wide wall higher at one end than the other and with a surrounding oval wall.&lt;ref name=Sturgis/&gt; Slowly burnt bones were found at the site, and after analysis were discovered to originate from [[Ox|bullocks]], [[goats]], and [[fallow deer]].&lt;ref name=Sturgis/&gt;

Although the excavating archaeologist believed that the site was the compound containing Joshua's altar,&lt;ref name=Sturgis/&gt; the filled walled structure being the altar itself - the filling being a part of the altar rather than debris (and indicative of an [[Assyria]]n style altar,&lt;ref name=Sturgis/&gt; like that specified in the [[Book of Exodus]] as being ''hollow with boards''&lt;ref&gt;Exodus 27&lt;/ref&gt;) - and the ''wall'' between the two courtyards being a ramp (in accordance with the ''no steps'' instruction in Exodus&lt;ref&gt;Exodus 26&lt;/ref&gt;), most other archaeologists believe it to be something else.&lt;ref name=Sturgis/&gt; The site has a significant issue in regard to the Biblical account of Joshua's altar, as it is located on the north side of the mountain, and not the south side facing [[Mount Gerizim]], making a curse &amp; blessing ritual held there and on Gerizim somewhat difficult to hold [[antiphon]]ally;&lt;ref name=Sturgis/&gt; the excavating archaeologist proposed that this could be resolved by identifying a mountain to the north as Gerizim rather than the usual location, though the suggestion was ridiculed by both the [[Samaritans]], who found it offensive to move the centre of their religion, and by other scholars and archaeologists.

Though some archaeologists agree with the consideration that the site was an altar compound (though not constructed by ''Joshua''), and some (including [[Israel Finkelstein]]) at least agree that it was a cultic location (though not necessarily involving an altar), others believe that it was simply a farmhouse, a guard tower&lt;ref&gt;Assaf Kamar, [http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4838962,00.html 'A rare visit to the supposed altar of prophet Joshua,'] [[Ynet]] 9 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; or the Biblical ''tower of Shechem''.&lt;ref name=Sturgis/&gt; Those considering it to be a farmhouse and/or the ''tower of Shechem'', argue that the paved areas are simply rooms, the ''sloping'' wall simply an [[erosion|eroded]] partition wall, and the infilled enclosure a room that was later changed into a tower - the foundation of the tower being the infill, and the rest of the tower now destroyed.&lt;ref name=Sturgis/&gt;

Israelis wishing to visit the site today must coordinate their activity with [[Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories|COGAT]], the Israeli defence ministry unit which manages civilian affairs for Palestinians in the West Bank and liaises with Gaza, since Mount Ebal is located in what is now designated as [[West Bank Areas in the Oslo II Accord|Area B]]. In addition, Israeli citizens visiting the area are required to be escorted by [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] soldiers, to ensure their personal safety. The [[Shomron Regional Council]], as of July 2016, was trying to promote the area as a tourist destination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Egyptian - Wall Hanging or Curtain Fragment with Orpheus and Eurydice - Walters 83466.jpg|thumb|Egyptian [[tapestry]] [[roundel]] with [[Orpheus]] and [[Eurydice]], 5th–6th century CE]]

The ancient legend of '''Orpheus and Eurydice''' concerns the fateful love of [[Orpheus]] of [[Thrace]], son of [[Apollo]] and the muse [[Calliope]], for the beautiful [[Eurydice]] (from ''Eurudike'', "she whose justice extends widely"). It may be a late addition to the Orpheus myths, as the latter cult-title suggests those attached to [[Persephone]]. It may have been derived from a legend in which Orpheus travels to [[Tartarus]] and charms the goddess [[Hecate]].{{Clarify|date=January 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;Robert Graves, ''The Greek Myths'', Penguin Books Ltd., London (1955), Volume 1, Chapter 28, "Orpheus", p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Versions==
In [[Virgil]]'s classic version of the legend, it completes his ''[[Georgics]]'', a poem on the subject of agriculture. Here the name of [[Aristaeus]], or Aristaios, the keeper of bees, and the [[Greek tragedy|tragic]] conclusion, was first introduced.&lt;ref&gt;[[M. Owen Lee]], ''Virgil as Orpheus: A Study of the pundis', State University of New York Press, Albany (1996), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ovid]]'s version of the myth, in his ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', was published a few decades later and employs a different poetic emphasis and purpose. It relates that Eurydice's death was not caused by fleeing from Aristaeus, but by dancing with [[naiad]]s on her wedding day.

Other ancient writers treated Orpheus' visit to the underworld more negatively. According to Phaedrus in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'',&lt;ref name="symposium"&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0174:text=Sym.:section=179d ''Symposium'' 179d-e].&lt;/ref&gt; the infernal deities only "presented an apparition" of Eurydice to him. Plato's representation of Orpheus is in fact that of a coward; instead of choosing to die in order to be with his love, he mocked the deities in an attempt to visit Hades, to get her back alive. As his love was not "true"—meaning that he was not willing to die for it—he was punished by the deities, first by giving him only the apparition of his former wife in the underworld and then by having him killed by en.&lt;ref name="symposium" /&gt;

==Plot==

[[Apollo]] gives his son Orpheus a [[lyre]] and teaches him how to play. Orpheus played with such perfection that even Apollo was surprised. It is said that nothing could resist his beautiful melodies, neither enemies nor beasts. Even trees and rocks were entranced with his music.

Orpheus fell in love with [[Eurydice]], a woman of unique beauty and grace, whom he married and lived happily with for a short time. However, when [[Hymen (god)|Hymen]] was called to bless the marriage, he predicted that their perfection was not meant to last.

A short time after this ominous prophecy, Eurydice was wandering in the forest with the Nymphs. In some versions of the story, Aristaeus, a shepherd, then saw her, was beguiled by her beauty, made advances towards her, and began to chase her. Other versions of the story relate that Eurydice was merely dancing with the Nymphs. In any case, while fleeing or dancing, she was bitten by a snake and died instantly. 

Orpheus sang his grief with his lyre and managed to move everything living or not in the world; both humans and gods were deeply touched by his sorrow and grief.

At some point, Orpheus decided to descend to Hades to see his wife. Ovid's version of the myth does not explain this decision,&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], [[Metamorphoses (Ovid)|Metamorphoses]] X&lt;/ref&gt; while other versions relate that the gods and nymphs{{cn|date=June 2018}} or Apollo himself, Orpheus' father,{{cn|date=June 2018}} suggest that he make this journey. Any other mortal would have died, but Orpheus, protected by the gods, went to Hades and arrived at the infamous Stygian realm, passing by ghosts and souls of people unknown. He also managed to charm [[Cerberus]], the monster known to have three heads. Orpheus presented himself in front of the god of the Underworld Hades ([[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]]) and his wife Persephone.

Orpheus played his lyre, melting even Hades' heart. Hades told Orpheus that he could take Eurydice with him but under one condition; Eurydice would follow him while walking out to the light from the caves of the Underworld, but he should not look at her before coming out to the light or else he would lose her forever. If Orpheus was patient enough he would have Eurydice as a normal woman again by his side.

Thinking it a simple task for a patient man like himself, Orpheus was delighted; he thanked the gods and left to ascend back into the world. Unable to hear Eurydice’s footsteps, however, he began fearing the gods had fooled him. Eurydice was in fact behind him, but as a [[Shade (mythology)|shade]], having to come back into the light to become a full woman again. Only a few feet away from the exit, Orpheus lost his faith and turned to see Eurydice behind him, but her shadow was whisked back among the dead, now trapped in Hades forever.

Orpheus tried to return to the Underworld, but a man cannot enter the realm of Hades twice while alive. According to various versions of the myth, Orpheus started playing a mourning song with his lyre, calling for death so that he could be united with Eurydice forever. Orpheus is ultimately killed either by beasts tearing him apart, or by the [[Maenad]]s, in a frenzied mood. According to another version, Zeus decided to strike him with lightning knowing Orpheus would reveal the secrets of the Underworld to humans.

In any case, Orpheus died, but the Muses decided to save his head and keep it among the living people to sing forever, enchanting everyone with his lovely melodies and tones.

In [[Roman mythology]], '''Pilumnus''' ("staker") was a nature deity, brother of [[Picumnus]].  He ensured children grew properly and stayed healthy.  Ancient Romans made an extra bed after the birth of a child in order to ensure the help of Pilumnus.  He also taught humanity how to grind [[Cereal|grain]].  He was also sometimes identified as the husband of [[Danaë]], and therefore the father of [[Danaus]] and the ancestor of [[Turnus]].

A ceremony to honour the deity involved driving a stake into the ground.

{{Scattering}}

'''Raman scattering''' or the '''Raman effect''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɑː|m|ən}} is the [[inelastic scattering]] of a [[photon]] by molecules which are excited to higher vibrational or rotational energy levels.
It was discovered in 1928 by [[C. V. Raman]] and his student [[K. S. Krishnan]] in liquids,&lt;ref name="raman1928"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Raman|first=C. V.|date=|year=1928|title=A new radiation|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10821/377|journal=Indian J. Phys.|volume=2|pages=387–398|accessdate=2018-08-28|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
and independently by [[Grigory Landsberg]] and [[Leonid Mandelstam]] in crystals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = G.| last2 = Mandelstam| first2 = L.| last1 = Landsberg | title = Eine neue Erscheinung bei der Lichtzerstreuung in Krystallen | journal = Naturwissenschaften | volume = 16| issue = 28 | pages = 557 | year = 1928| doi = 10.1007/BF01506807|bibcode = 1928NW.....16..557. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The effect had been predicted theoretically by [[Adolf Smekal]] in 1923.&lt;ref name=smekal&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = A. | title = Zur Quantentheorie der Dispersion | journal = Naturwissenschaften| last1 = Smekal | volume = 11| issue = 43 | pages = 873–875 | year = 1923 | doi = 10.1007/BF01576902|bibcode = 1923NW.....11..873S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[photons]] are [[scattering|scattered]] from an [[atom]] or [[molecule]], most of them are [[elastic scattering|elastically scattered]] ([[Rayleigh scattering]]), such that the scattered photons have the same energy ([[frequency]] and [[wavelength]]) as the incident photons. A small fraction of the scattered photons (approximately 1 in 10 million) are scattered ''inelastically'' by an excitation, with the scattered photons having a frequency and energy different from, and usually lower than, those of the incident photons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Harris and Bertolucci|title=Symmetry and Spectroscopy|publisher=Dover Publications|year=1989|isbn= 0-486-66144-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a gas, Raman scattering can occur with a change in energy of a molecule due to a transition to another (usually higher) [[energy level]]. Chemists are primarily concerned with this "transitional" Raman effect.

== History ==

The inelastic scattering of light was predicted by [[Adolf Smekal]] in 1923&lt;ref name=smekal/&gt; (and in German-language literature it may be referred to as the '''Smekal-Raman effect'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nature |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v128/n3242/abs/1281026c0.html |title=A review of the 1931 book '&amp;#39;Der Smekal-Raman-Effekt'&amp;#39; |publisher=Nature.com |date=19 December 1931 |accessdate=2011-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In 1922, Indian physicist C. V. Raman published his work on the "Molecular Diffraction of Light," the first of a series of investigations with his collaborators that ultimately led to his discovery (on 28 February 1928) of the radiation effect that bears his name. The Raman effect was first reported by [[C. V. Raman]] and [[K. S. Krishnan]],&lt;ref name=raman1928/&gt; and independently by [[Grigory Landsberg]] and [[Leonid Mandelstam]], on 21 February 1928 (that is why in the former Soviet Union the priority of Raman was always disputed; thus in Russian scientific literature this effect is usually referred to as "combination scattering" or "combinatory scattering"). Raman received the Nobel Prize in 1930 for his work on the scattering of light.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = R. | title = C. V. Raman and the Discovery of the Raman Effect | journal = Physics in Perspective| last1 = Singh | volume = 4| issue = 4 | pages = 399–420 | year = 2002 | doi = 10.1007/s000160200002|bibcode = 2002PhP.....4..399S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 the Raman effect was designated a [[National Historic Chemical Landmarks|National Historic Chemical Landmark]] by the [[American Chemical Society]] in recognition of its significance as a tool for analyzing the composition of liquids, gases, and solids.&lt;ref name="ACS Landmarks"&gt;{{cite web|title=C. V. Raman: The Raman Effect|url=http://portal.acs.org/portal/PublicWebSite/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/ramaneffect/index.htm|publisher=[[American Chemical Society]]|accessdate=6 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130112060216/http://portal.acs.org/portal/PublicWebSite/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/ramaneffect/index.htm|archivedate=12 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

===Degrees of freedom===

For any given chemical compound, there are a total of 3N [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]], where N is the number of [[atom]]s in the compound. This number arises from the ability of each atom in a molecule to move in three different directions (x, y, and z).&lt;ref name=Laidler&gt;[[Keith J. Laidler]] and John H. Meiser, ''Physical Chemistry'' (Benjamin/Cummings 1982), p.646-7 {{ISBN|0-8053-5682-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; When dealing with molecules, it is more common to consider the movement of the molecule as a whole. Consequently, the 3N degrees of freedom are partitioned into molecular translational, [[rotational motion|rotational]], and vibrational motion. Three of the degrees of freedom correspond to translational motion of the molecule as a whole (along each of the three spatial dimensions). Similarly, three degrees of freedom correspond to rotations of the molecule about the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-axes. [[Linear molecular geometry|Linear molecule]]s only have two rotations because rotations along the bond axis do not change the positions of the atoms in the molecule. The remaining degrees of freedom correspond to molecular vibrational modes. These modes include stretching and bending motions of the [[chemical bond]]s of the molecule. For a linear molecule, the number of vibrational modes is:&lt;ref name=Laidler/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;3N-3-2 = 3N-5&lt;/math&gt;

whereas for a non-linear molecule the number of vibrational modes are

:&lt;math&gt;3N-6&lt;/math&gt;

===Molecular vibrations and infrared radiation===

The frequencies of molecular vibrations range from less than 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; to approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; Hz.  These frequencies correspond to radiation in the infrared (IR) region of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].  At any given instant, each molecule in a sample has a certain amount of vibrational energy.  However, the amount of vibrational energy that a molecule has continually changes due to collisions and other interactions with other molecules in the sample.

At room temperature, most of the molecules will be in the lowest [[energy level|energy state]], which is known as the [[ground state]].  A few molecules will be in higher energy states, which are known as excited states.   The fraction of molecules occupying a given vibrational mode at a given temperature can be calculated using the [[Boltzmann distribution]].  Performing such a calculation shows that, for relatively low temperatures (such as those used for most routine spectroscopy), most of the molecules occupy the ground vibrational state.  Such a molecule can be excited to a higher vibrational mode through the direct absorption of a photon of the appropriate energy.  This is the mechanism by which IR spectroscopy operates:  infrared radiation is passed through the sample, and the intensity of the transmitted light is compared with that of the incident light.  A reduction in intensity at a given wavelength of light indicates the absorption of energy by a vibrational transition.  The energy, &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, of a [[photon]] is
:&lt;math&gt;E=h \nu&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is [[Planck's constant]] and &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[frequency]] of the [[radiation]].  Thus, the energy required for such a transition may be calculated if the frequency of the incident radiation is known.

===Raman scattering===

It is also possible to observe molecular vibrations by an inelastic scattering process. In inelastic (Raman) scattering, an absorbed photon is re-emitted with lower energy; the difference in energy between the incident photons and scattered photons corresponds to the energy required to excite a molecule to a higher vibrational mode.

Typically, in Raman spectroscopy high intensity laser radiation with wavelengths in either the [[visible spectrum|visible]] or [[near-infrared]] regions of the spectrum is passed through a sample.  Photons from the laser beam produce an oscillating polarization in the molecules, exciting them to a [[virtual state|virtual energy state]]. The oscillating polarization of the molecule can couple with other possible polarizations of the molecule, including vibrational and electronic excitations.  If the polarization in the molecule does not couple to these other possible polarizations, then it will not change the vibrational state that the molecule started in and the scattered photon will have the same energy as the original photon. This type of scattering is known as [[Rayleigh scattering]].

When the polarization in the molecules couples to a vibrational state that is higher in energy than the state they started in, then the original photon and the scattered photon differ in energy by the amount required to vibrationally excite the molecule. In [[perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]], the Raman effect corresponds to the absorption and subsequent emission of a photon via an intermediate quantum state of a material. The intermediate state can be either a "real", i.e. [[stationary state]], or a [[Virtual state (physics)|virtual state]].

===Stokes and anti-Stokes===
[[File:Ramanscattering.svg|thumb|480px|The different possibilities of light scattering: Rayleigh scattering (no exchange of energy: incident and scattered photons have the same energy), Stokes Raman scattering (atom or molecule absorbs energy: scattered photon has less energy than the incident photon) and anti-Stokes Raman scattering (atom or molecule loses energy: scattered photon has more energy than the incident photon)]]

The Raman interaction leads to two possible outcomes: 
*the material absorbs energy and the emitted photon has a lower energy than the absorbed photon. This outcome is labeled Stokes Raman scattering in honor of [[Sir George Stokes, 1st Baronet|George Stokes]] who showed in 1852 that [[fluorescence]] is due to light emission at [[Stokes line|longer wavelength]] (now known to correspond to lower energy) than the absorbed incident light.
*the material loses energy and the emitted photon has a higher energy than the absorbed photon. This outcome is labeled anti-Stokes Raman scattering.
The energy difference between the absorbed and emitted photon corresponds to the energy difference between two resonant states of the material and is independent of the absolute energy of the photon.

The spectrum of the scattered photons is termed the [[Raman spectroscopy|Raman spectrum]]. It shows the intensity of the scattered light as a function of its frequency difference ''Δν'' to the incident photons. The locations of corresponding Stokes and anti-Stokes peaks form a symmetric pattern around ''Δν=0''. The frequency shifts are symmetric because they correspond to the energy difference between the same upper and lower resonant states. The intensities of the pairs of features will typically differ, though. They depend on the populations of the initial states of the material, which in turn depend on the temperature. In [[thermodynamic equilibrium]], the lower state will be more populated than the upper state. Therefore, the rate of transitions from the more populated lower state to the upper state (Stokes transitions) will be higher than in the opposite direction (anti-Stokes transitions). Correspondingly, Stokes scattering peaks are stronger than anti-Stokes scattering peaks. Their ratio depends on the temperature, and can therefore be exploited to measure it.

===Distinction from fluorescence===
The Raman effect differs from the process of [[fluorescence]] in that it is a scattering process. For fluorescence, the incident light is completely absorbed, transferring the system to an [[excited state]].  After a certain [[resonance]] lifetime, the system de-excites to lower energy states via emission of photons. The result of both processes is in essence the same: A [[photon]] with a frequency different from that of the incident photon is produced and the molecule is brought to a higher or lower [[energy level]]. But the major difference is that the Raman effect can take place for any frequency of incident light. In contrast to the fluorescence effect, the Raman effect is therefore not a [[resonance|resonant]] effect. In practice, this means that a [[fluorescence]] peak is anchored at a specific frequency, whereas a Raman peak maintains a constant separation from the excitation frequency.

===Selection rules===
A Raman transition from one state to another is allowed only if the molecular [[polarizability]] of those states is different. For a vibration, this means that the derivative of the polarizability with respect to the normal coordinate associated to the vibration is non-zero: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \alpha}{\partial Q} \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;. In general, a normal mode is Raman active if it transforms with the same symmetry of the quadratic forms (&lt;math&gt;x^2, y^2, z^2, xy, xz, yz&lt;/math&gt;), which can be verified from the character table of the molecule's symmetry group.

The specific selection rules state that the allowed rotational transitions are &lt;math&gt;\Delta J=\pm2&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; is the rotational state.

The allowed vibrational transitions are &lt;math&gt;\Delta\nu=\pm1&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is the vibrational state.

== Stimulated Raman scattering and Raman amplification ==

The Raman-scattering process as described above takes place spontaneously; i.e., in random time intervals, one of the many incoming photons is scattered by the material. This process is thus called ''spontaneous Raman scattering''.

On the other hand, ''stimulated Raman scattering'' can take place when some Stokes photons have previously been generated by spontaneous Raman scattering (and somehow forced to remain in the material), or when deliberately injecting Stokes photons ("signal light") together with the original light ("pump light"). In that case, the total Raman-scattering rate is increased beyond that of spontaneous Raman scattering: pump photons are converted more rapidly into additional Stokes photons. The more Stokes photons are already present, the faster more of them are added. Effectively, this ''amplifies'' the Stokes light in the presence of the pump light, which is exploited in [[Optical amplifier#Raman amplifier|Raman amplifiers]] and [[Raman laser]]s.

Stimulated Raman scattering is a [[Nonlinear optics|nonlinear-optical]] effect. It can be described using a third-order nonlinear susceptibility &lt;math&gt;\chi^{(3)}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Need of space-coherence ===
Suppose that the distance between two points A and B of an exciting beam is {{math|''x''}}. Generally, as the exciting frequency is not equal to the scattered Raman frequency, the corresponding relative wavelengths {{math|&amp;lambda;}} and {{math|&amp;lambda;'}} are not equal. Thus, a phase-shift {{math|&amp;Theta; {{=}} 2&amp;pi;''x''(1/&amp;lambda; − 1/&amp;lambda;')}} appears. For {{math|&amp;Theta; {{=}} ''&amp;pi;''}}, the scattered amplitudes are opposite, so that the Raman scattered beam remains weak.

– A crossing of the beams may limit the path {{math|''x''}}.

Several tricks may be used to get a larger amplitude:

– In an optically anisotropic crystal, a light ray may have two modes of propagation with different polarizations and different indices of refraction. If energy may be transferred between these modes by a quadrupolar (Raman) resonance, phases remain coherent along the whole path, transfer of energy may be large. It is an [[Optical parametric generation]].

– Light may be pulsed, so that beats do not appear.

L. Lamb Jr., “Analytical description of ultra-short optical pulse propagation in a resonant medium”, Rev. Mod. Phys., 1971, 43, 99–124.&lt;/ref&gt; Interference of Raman and incident lights is too short to allow beats, so that it produces a frequency shift roughly, in best conditions, inversely proportional to cube of length of pulses. 
In labs, femtosecond laser pulses must be used because the ISRS becomes very weak if the pulses are too long. Thus ISRS cannot be observed using nanosecond pulses making ordinary time-incoherent light.

==Inverse Raman effect==
The '''inverse Raman effect''' in [[optics]] (the branch of [[physics]] which deals with the properties and behavior of light) is a form of Raman scattering. It was first noted by W.J.Jones and [[B.P. Stoicheff]].

If a material is simultaneously [[Irradiation|irradiated]] by intense monochromatic light of frequency ν&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt; (typically a [[laser]] beam) and light of a continuum of [[Wavelength|higher frequencies]], among the possibilities for [[light scattering]] are:

* from the monochromatic beam at ν&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt; to the continuum at ν&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt;+ν&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt; (anti-Stokes Raman scattering)
* from the continuum at ν&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt;+ν&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt; to the monochromatic beam at ν&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt; (Stokes Raman scattering)

where ν&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt; is a Raman frequency of the material.  The strength of these two scatterings depends (among other things) on the energy levels of the material, their occupancy, and the intensity of the continuum.  In some circumstances Stokes scattering can exceed anti-Stokes scattering; in these cases the continuum (on leaving the material) is observed to have an absorption line (a dip in intensity) at ν&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt;+ν&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt;.  This phenomenon is referred to as the ''inverse Raman effect''; the application of the phenomenon is referred to as ''inverse [[Raman spectroscopy]]'', and a record of the continuum is referred to as an ''inverse Raman spectrum''.

In the original description of the inverse Raman effect,&lt;ref name="J&amp;S"&gt;
W.J.Jones and B.P. Stoicheff, 'Inverse Raman Spectra: Induced Absorption at Optical Frequencies’, ''Phys. Rev. Lett.'' '''13''', 657 – 659 (1964).&lt;/ref&gt; the authors discuss both absorption from a continuum of higher frequencies and absorption from a continuum of lower frequencies.  They note that absorption from a continuum of lower frequencies will not be observed if the Raman frequency of the material is vibrational in origin and if the material is in [[Thermodynamic equilibrium#Thermal equilibrium|thermal equilibrium]].

==Applications==

[[Raman spectroscopy]] employs the Raman effect for substances analysis. The spectrum of the Raman-scattered light depends on the molecular constituents present and their state, allowing the spectrum to be used for material identification and analysis. Raman spectroscopy is used to analyze a wide range of materials, including gases, liquids, and solids. Highly complex materials such as biological organisms and human tissue&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-11390951 | work=BBC News | title=Painless laser device could spot early signs of disease | date=27 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; can also be analyzed by Raman spectroscopy.

For solid materials, Raman scattering is used as a tool to detect high-frequency phonon and [[magnon]] excitations.

Raman [[lidar]] is used in atmospheric physics to measure the atmospheric extinction coefficient and the water vapour vertical distribution.

Stimulated Raman transitions are also widely used for manipulating a trapped ion's energy levels, and thus basis [[qubit]] states.

Raman spectroscopy can be used to determine the force constant and bond length for molecules that do not have an infrared absorption spectrum.

[[Raman amplification]] is used in [[optical amplifier]]s.

The Raman effect is also involved in producing the appearance of the blue sky (see Rayleigh Effect: 'Rayleigh scattering of molecular nitrogen and oxygen in the atmosphere includes elastic scattering as well as the inelastic contribution from rotational Raman scattering in air').

=== Supercontinuum generation ===
For high-intensity continuous wave (CW) lasers, SRS can be used to produce broad bandwidth spectra. This process can also be seen as a special case of [[four-wave mixing]], wherein the frequencies of the two incident photons are equal and the emitted spectra are found in two bands separated from the incident light by the [[phonon]] energies. The initial Raman spectrum is built up with spontaneous emission and is amplified later on. At high pumping levels in long fibers, higher-order Raman spectra can be generated by using the Raman spectrum as a new starting point, thereby building a chain of new spectra with decreasing amplitude. The disadvantage of intrinsic noise due to the initial spontaneous process can be overcome by seeding a spectrum at the beginning, or even using a feedback loop as in a resonator to stabilize the process. Since this technology easily fits into the fast evolving [[fiber laser]] field and there is demand for transversal coherent high-intensity light sources (i.e., broadband telecommunication, imaging applications), Raman amplification and spectrum generation might be widely used in the near-future.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="65011">In an organized [[sports league]], a typical '''season''' is the portion of one [[year]] in which regulated games of the [[sport]] are in session: for example, in [[Major League Baseball]] the season lasts approximately from April to October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/mlb/2014/09/08/2015-mlb-season-schedule-world-series-interleague|title=MLB announces 2015 schedule with April start, October finish|author=Jay Jaffe|date=September 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other [[team sport]]s, like [[association football]] or [[basketball]], it is generally from August or September to May although in some countries - such as Northern Europe or East Asia - the season starts in the spring and finishes in autumn, mainly due to weather conditions encountered during the winter.

A year can often be broken up into several distinct sections (sometimes themselves called seasons). These are: a preseason, a series of exhibition games played for training purposes; a regular season, the main period of the league's competition; the [[postseason]], a playoff tournament played against the league's top teams to determine the league's champion; and the offseason, the time when there is no official competition.

==Regular season==
In sport, the term "regular season" or "home and away season"&lt;ref name="FortFizel2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rodney D. Fort|author2=John Fizel|title=International Sports Economics Comparisons|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6mQHaZaDTzAC&amp;pg=PA316|year=2004|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-98032-0|pages=316–}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the sport's [[championship#league system|league competition]]. The regular season is usually similar to a [[Tournament#Group tournaments|group tournament]] format: teams are divided into groups, conferences and/or divisions, and each club plays a set number of games against a set number of opponents. In most countries the league is played in a double round-robin format, where every team plays every other team twice, once at their home venue, and once away at the oppositions venue as visitors. The results over all games are accumulated and when every team has completed its full schedule of games, a winner is declared. 

In North America, the scheduling is different. Rather than every team playing all others twice, teams usually play more games against local rivals than teams in other parts of the country. For example, the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]'s [[Los Angeles Lakers]] will play the [[Los Angeles Clippers]] (a team within their division, a subdivision of the conference) four times in a regular season, while both will only play the [[Boston Celtics]], who are in the opposite [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]], twice. Part of this is due to the vast geographic distances between some teams in North America—measured in a straight line, Los Angeles is 2,606 miles (4,194 kilometers) from Boston, for instance—and a desire to limit travel expenses.  In the scheduling system used in the [[NFL]], it is possible for two teams to only meet every four years, and to only have 2 common opponents in a season. [[Major League Baseball]] has the most uneven schedules of all the four major North American sports. In MLB the conferences are called leagues instead, but have exactly the same effect as [[athletic conference|conferences]] (as with all [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|North American major leagues]], leagues, conferences and division are not based on skill, but instead geography, history and rivalries). Teams play 19 games against each of teams in their own division each year but will only play 20 games total against all of the teams in the other league. Because each of the interleague matchups is part of a 3-game series or a 2-game series, teams will play no games at all against most teams from the other league. They play 6 of the 15 teams in the other league, a historically high number (until 1997, [[interleague play]] was limited to exhibition matches and the postseason [[World Series]], and thus MLB teams did not play the other league's teams at all).

In Australia, the two largest football leagues, the [[Australian Football League|AFL]] ([[Australian rules football]]) and [[National Rugby League|NRL]] ([[rugby league]]), both grew out of competitions held within a single city (respectively Melbourne and Sydney) and only began expanding to the rest of the country when inexpensive air travel made a national league possible. These leagues use a single [[league table|table]] instead of being split into divisions. The term "home and away season" is sometimes used instead of regular season.

Many football leagues in Latin America have a very different system. Because most Latin American countries never had a football cup competition, they instead split their season into two parts, typically known as the [[Apertura and Clausura]] ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "opening" and "closing"). Most countries that use this system, Argentina being one notable example, crown separate league champions for each part of the season, using only league play. A few others, such as Uruguay, crown one champion at the end of a playoff involving top teams from each half of the season. Mexico operates its Apertura and Clausura as separate competitions that both end in playoffs. Brazil have a different system, the season starts with the state championships in January (every Brazilian state have his own championship), these state championships ends in April. The [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série A]] itself starts in May and ends in early December, and is played in a double round-robin format in the same way as the European championships.

A system similar to the Apertura and Clausura developed independently in [[Philippine Basketball Association|Philippine professional basketball]], with formerly two, now three tournaments (called "conferences") in one season, with each conference divided into an "elimination round" (the regular season) and the playoffs in the North American sense. Winning the playoffs is the ultimate goal of every team for every conference; while there is no season championship, [[Grand Slam (PBA)|winning all conferences within a single season]] is rare and has only happened five times since 1975, with the two most recent examples occurring in [[1996 Alaska Milkmen season|1996]] and [[2013–14 San Mig Super Coffee Mixers season|2013–14]]. The elimination round and playoffs setup has permeated down to the local level and in most team sports, although seasons are not divided into conferences.

==Postseason==
{{Main|Playoffs}}

Many sports leagues have playoffs or "finals" that occur after the regular season is complete. A subset of the teams enter into a playoff [[tournament]], usually a [[knockout tournament]], generally a pre-determined number with better overall records (more wins, fewer losses) during the regular season. There are many variations used to determine the champion, the league's top prize. In many of these leagues, winning the league's top prize at the conclusion of the postseason is more important than winning the regular season. This includes the [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|five major U.S. sports leagues]] ([[Super Bowl]], [[Stanley Cup Finals]], [[NBA Finals]], [[World Series]] and [[MLS Cup]]), the major Australian sports ([[NBL Grand Final]], [[A-League Grand Final]], [[AFL Grand Final]] and [[NRL Grand Final]]) and the [[Canadian Football League|CFL]]'s [[Grey Cup]].

European leagues have also started holding playoffs after a double round-robin "regular season". The [[Football League]] started its [[Football League play-offs|promotion playoffs]] in 1987, with the third up to the sixth-ranked teams participating for the final promotion berth (the two top teams are automatically promoted). Elsewhere, relegation playoffs are also held to determine which teams would be relegated to the lower leagues. One prominent top-level football league, the [[Eredivisie]] of the Netherlands, uses two different playoffs—one for relegation purposes, and the other to determine one of the league's entrants in the following season's [[UEFA Europa League]]. In [[Superleague Greece]], which currently has two places in the [[UEFA Champions League]] and three in the Europa League, the teams that finish second through fifth in the regular season enter a home-and-away "playoff" mini-league. Since one Europa League place is reserved for the country's cup winner, only three of the four teams are guaranteed a place in the next season's European competitions (unless both the cup winner and runner-up are already qualified for Europe by other means). The playoff determines the country's second Champions League participant, and the points at which the two or three Europa League entrants join that competition. Conversely, some leagues like the [[Premier League]] do not hold a postseason, and therefore these leagues' champions and relegation are instead based on the regular season records.

Although rugby union did not become professional until 1995, that sport has a long history of playoffs, primarily in France and the Southern Hemisphere. The French national championship, now known as [[Top 14]], staged a championship final in its first season of 1892, first used more than one round of playoffs in 1893, and has continuously operated a playoff system (except during the two World Wars) since 1899. South Africa's [[Currie Cup]] has determined its champions by playoffs since 1968, and New Zealand's [[National Provincial Championship]], the top level of which is now known as the [[Mitre 10 Cup]], has used playoffs since its creation in 1976. Argentina's [[Nacional de Clubes]] has determined its champion by playoffs since its inception in 1993. Currently, two separate competitions feed into the Nacional, the [[Torneo de la URBA]] (for Buenos Aires clubs, held since 1899) and [[Torneo del Interior]] (for the rest of the country); both use playoffs to determine their champions. [[Super Rugby]], involving regional franchises from Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa and national franchises in Argentina and Japan, has used playoffs to determine its champions since its creation as Super 12 in 1996.

By contrast, other European countries were slow to adopt playoffs in rugby union. The [[Premiership Rugby|English Premiership]] only began playoffs in [[1999–2000 English Premiership (rugby union)|1999–2000]], and did not use them to determine the league champion until [[2002-03 English Premiership (rugby union)|2002-03]]. The Celtic League, now known as [[Pro14]], resisted a playoff system even longer; its champions were determined solely by league play from its inception in [[2001–02 Celtic League|2001–02]] until playoffs began in [[2009–10 Celtic League|2009–10]].

When the UEFA Champions League reformatted in 1993, it added a "knockout stage" involving four teams that finished at the top two places in their respective groups. Like North American sports leagues, this setup prevented some participants from facing each other, necessitating a two-round knockout stage to determine the champions. It has since been expanded to the 4-round knockout stage today. The [[Copa Libertadores]] has applied a knockout stage since the 1988 tournament, expanding to the current four-round format next season. All intercontinental club football competitions now feature a knockout stage.

==Off-season==
The '''off-season''', '''vacation time''', or '''close season''' is the time of year when there is no official competition. Although upper management continues to work, the athletes will take much [[Annual leave|vacation]] time off. Also, various events such as drafts, [[transfer (football)|transfers]] and important off-season [[free agent]] signings occur. Generally, most athletes stay in shape during the off-season in preparation for the next season. Certain new rules in the league may be made during this time, and will become enforced during the next regular season.

As most countries which have a league in a particular sport will operate their regular season at roughly the same time as the others, international tournaments may be arranged during the off season.

For example, most European football league club competitions run from July or August to May, subsequently major international competitions such as the [[FIFA World Cup]] and [[UEFA European Football Championship]] are organised to occur in June and July.

===Summary===
{|class=wikitable
|-
!Sport !! Duration
|-
|American football || Originally football was played only in the fall, but for many years the season has extended from late summer through early to mid-winter.

* The 16-game [[NFL]] regular season currently begins the first [[NFL Kickoff Game|Thursday]] in September (after a month of exhibition games) and ends 17 weeks later around [[New Year's Day]].  The playoffs culminate with the [[Super Bowl]] on the first Sunday in February.
* The college season begins the last week in August.  The regular season ends in late November, with playoff and [[bowl games]] throughout December and early January. 
* [[indoor American football|Indoor football]], past professional leagues such as the [[United States Football League|USFL]] and [[XFL]], and some women's and amateur leagues play in the February to August season.
|-
|Association football || Usually August to May in the Northern Hemisphere, and February to November in the Southern Hemisphere. Exceptions are generally for one of two reasons:
* In some northern countries with severe winter weather (such as the United States, Norway, and Sweden), the season is contested within a calendar year (roughly March to November) to avoid the worst weather.
** However, other leagues use winter breaks to avoid most of the coldest days to prevent players suffering from hypothermia.
* Some countries, primarily in Latin America, use a split season, known as [[Apertura and Clausura]]. The traditional association football season from August to May is divided in two sections per season, each with its own champion. Apertura and Clausura are the Spanish words for "opening" and "closing". In French-speaking Haiti, these are known as the Ouverture and the Fermeture, while in English-speaking Belize, they are respectively the Opening and Closing seasons. The North American Soccer League (NASL) adopted a split season in 2013; the season is divided into a Spring Championship and Fall Championship.
* In some countries where soccer competes with locally more popular [[football]] codes (i.e. Major League Soccer in the U.S., A-League in Australia), the season is arranged so as to minimize the time that it is in conflict with the more popular code(s). This arrangement also eases scheduling concerns regarding venues used for multiple football codes. However, in the case of the United States' MLS, their regular seasons can conflict with major tournaments such as the Gold Cup and FIFA World Cup due to the demand of the league's best national players to participate in the national squad.
(See [[Domestic association football season]] for details.)
|-
|Australian rules football || March to late August, with finals series extending up to late September or early October.
|-
|Baseball || April to early October, with playoffs extending up to early November. The Australian Baseball League runs from November to early February, with playoffs extending up to late February.
|-
|Basketball || In most countries, late October to mid-April, with playoffs extending up to mid-June. The three major exceptions to this rule are:
* The U.S. college basketball season begins in mid-November. The regular season ends in the first days of March, followed by conference tournaments and then national championship tournaments that run into early April.
* The Philippine Basketball Association has a unique calendar. Its season runs from early October to August, and is divided into "conferences"—not the North American concept of subgroupings within a larger competition, but rather separate competitions involving the same set of teams, similar to football's [[Apertura and Clausura]] in Latin America. The season was divided into three conferences from 1975 to 2003. It then transitioned to a two-conference season in 2004, and also changed to a season spanning two calendar years, with the transition completed in the 2004–05 season. The PBA returned to a three-conference season effective in 2010–11. The season starts with the Philippine Cup, restricted to Filipino players, followed by two other tournaments in which teams can field one non-Filipino, the Commissioner's and Governors Cups.
* The WNBA season is scheduled during the offseason of its parent league, the NBA. When the league was launched, all of its teams were owned by NBA teams and generally played in the same arenas as their NBA counterparts; however, this has changed over time. The scheduling also allows many WNBA players to participate in overseas leagues, primarily in Europe, Australia, and China, during the traditional basketball season.
|-
|Canadian football || July to late October, with playoffs extending into November.
|-
|Cricket || Year-round. Domestic seasons typically held in the driest period of the year—summer in temperate climates, dry season in tropical climates.
|-
|Golf || Year-round
|-
|Ice hockey || Early October to mid-April, with playoffs extending up to early June. The three major exceptions to this rule are:
* The U.S. men's college hockey season begins in early October. The regular season ends in late February or early March, followed by conference tournaments and then a national championship tournament that runs into mid-April.  The women's season typically begins and ends two or three weeks earlier than the men's.
* The KHL regular season begins in early September and ends in late February. The playoffs run from March to mid-April.
* The Australian Ice Hockey League's season runs from April to mid-August, with playoffs extending up to late August.
|-
|Motor racing || Year-round, but generally concentrated from March to October. NASCAR runs from mid-February to late September, with playoffs extending up to late November.
|-
|Rugby league || Late February to October in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.
|-
|Rugby union || September to late May, sometimes the first weekend in June, in the Northern Hemisphere. In the Southern Hemisphere, Super Rugby starts in February and ends in early July in [[Rugby World Cup|World Cup]] years and mid-August in other years. Domestic competitions in [[Mitre 10 Cup|New Zealand]] and [[Currie Cup|South Africa]] overlap slightly with the Super Rugby season, starting in July and ending in October or November. In [[National Rugby Championship|Australia]], the domestic competition does not overlap at all with Super Rugby, instead beginning in August and ending in early November.
|-
|Swimming || Year-round
|-
|Tennis || Year-round

'''Solar America Cities''' is a [[U.S. Department of Energy]] (U.S. DOE) initiative to promote solar energy at the local level through city programs.

==History==
The DOE has named 25 U.S. cities as a '''Solar America City''' which are promoting [[renewable energy commercialization|solar technology adoption]] at the local level.

These cities will take a comprehensive, citywide approach to solar technology that facilitates its mainstream acceptance. Solar technologies promoted by Solar America Cities include [[photovoltaics]] and [[concentrating solar power]] (which both produce solar electricity) as well as [[solar water heating|solar water]] and air heating.&lt;ref name=solar&gt;[http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy08osti/43008.pdf  The Solar America Cities Awards]&lt;/ref&gt;

They represent 16 different states and have varying degrees of solar resources and experience with solar technologies. The cities were not selected for their number of sunny days. Rather, DOE selected these urban communities based on their long-term commitment to developing solar energy markets in their municipalities. Some have extensive experience with solar power and some are just getting started. Different cities are also taking different approaches to building a sustainable solar infrastructure. DOE expects that these cities’ creative efforts will serve as models for other urban communities in the future.

==List==
The 25 cities selected are: 
*[[Ann Arbor, MI]]
*[[Austin, TX]]
*[[Berkeley, CA]]
*[[Boston, MA]]
*[[Denver, CO]]
*[[Houston, TX]]
*[[Knoxville, TN]]
*[[Madison, WI]]
*[[Milwaukee, WI]]
*[[Minneapolis – St. Paul, MN]]
*[[New Orleans, LA]]
*[[New York City, NY]]
*[[Orlando, FL]]
*[[Philadelphia, PA]]
*[[Pittsburgh, PA]]
*[[Portland, OR]]
*[[Sacramento, CA]]
*[[Salt Lake City, UT]]
*[[San Antonio, TX]]
*[[San Diego, CA]]
*[[San Francisco, CA]]
*[[San Jose, CA]]
*[[Santa Rosa, CA]]
*[[Seattle, WA]]
*[[Tucson, AZ]]

==Initiative==
The desired outcomes of the Solar America Cities are: 
* Development of a comprehensive citywide approach that lays the foundation for a viable solar market that includes key stakeholders such as municipal, county, and state agencies, non-profit organizations, and utilities, as well as private partners such as developers and solar companies 
* Integration of solar energy technologies into city energy and climate planning 
* Increased installation of solar energy technologies on city facilities 
* Removal of market barriers to solar energy development that exist in urban planning charters, zoning regulations, building codes, permitting, and inspections 
* Creation of city-level solar incentives (e.g., solar rebates, financial assistance, tax credits, property tax abatements, and tax incentives to solar manufacturers that are located in the city) 
* Increased public awareness of solar energy among residents and local businesses, achieved through outreach, curriculum development, incentive programs, and other innovative approaches 
* A widespread increase in the adoption of solar energy technologies across the city—in the residential, commercial, and public building sectors, and at the utility 
* Lessons learned that are of value to other communities, cities, and counties looking to increase their use of solar energy technologies.

The Solar America Cities program has engaged over 180 organizations, including municipal, county, and state agencies, solar companies, universities, utilities, and non-profit organizations. These partners have made a commitment to power their cities with clean, safe, reliable energy—solar energy.

The Solar America Cities program has received a total of $4.9 million in federal financial assistance.&lt;ref name=solar/&gt;

'''Sorong fault''' also (Sorong Fault Zone, SFZ) is an active, broad zone of inferred [[Fault (geology)|left lateral]] [[Shear (geology)|shear]] at the [[triple junction]] of the [[Australian plate]], [[Eurasian plate]], and [[Pacific plate]]s, where many plate fragments exist, such as the [[Philippine Sea Plate]], [[Bird's Head Plate]], [[Halmahera Plate]] and the [[Molucca Sea Plate]].  It has been implicated in numerous large [[earthquakes]].  It is one of the two major faults created by the Australian and Pacific plate convergence, the other being the [[Ramu-Markham Fault]] zone.

==Location==
The Sorong fault begins around [[Sulawesi]] and runs towards [[New Guinea]].  It marks the boundary between Halmahera plate and Bird's Head Plate. The Sorong fault system has been documented to extend westward more than 500 miles (800&amp;nbsp;km) from [[Cenderawasih Bay|Teluk Sarera]] to [[Banggai Islands Regency|Kepulauan Banggai]].

==Geology==
The fault zone juxtaposes [[Mesozoic]]-[[Tertiary]] [[Continental crust|continental]] and [[volcanic arc]]/[[ophiolitic]] rocks.

==Plate evolution==
It is widely believed that fragments of the northern Australian continental margin in [[New Guinea]] are being detached and translated westward in this shear zone until they collide with the eastern margin of Eurasia ([[Sundaland]]) in the region of Sulawesi Island.  However, the details of [[terrane]] [[Translation (physics)|translation]], amalgamation, and docking remain poorly documented at this time.  In particular, the timing of events is very poorly constrained, with estimates for the commencement of the SFZ ranging from early [[Miocene]] or older to [[Pleistocene]].  Investigations in the 1990s of the SFZ and the adjacent regions of Sulawesi and Irian Jaya (Indonesian New Guinea), including fieldwork in several of the SFZ island-terranes ([[Waigeo Island]], [[Halmahera]], [[Bacan]], [[Obi Islands]], and [[Sula islands]]), suggest a less mobilist interpretation of the region than previous reconstructions.  SFZ did not begin to develop in its present form before the late Miocene.

A '''supermoon''' is a [[full moon]] or a [[new moon]] that approximately coincides with the [[apsis|closest]] [[lunar distance (astronomy)|distance]] that the [[Moon]] reaches to [[Earth]] in its [[elliptic orbit]], resulting in a slightly larger-than-usual [[angular diameter|apparent size]] of the lunar disk as seen from Earth.&lt;ref name="NYT-20140907"&gt;{{cite news |author=Staff |title=Revisiting the Moon |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/09/science/revisiting-the-moon.html |date=September 7, 2014 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=September 8, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The technical name is the '''perigee [[Syzygy (astronomy)|syzygy]]''' of the Earth–Moon–Sun system or more simply full (or new) Moon at perigee.{{efn|See [[apsis|perigee]] and [[syzygy (astronomy)|syzygy]]}}  The term ''supermoon'' is [[Astrology|astrological]] in origin and has no precise [[astronomy|astronomical]] definition.&lt;ref name="Discover"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2011/03/18/kryptonite-for-the-supermoon/|authorlink=Phil Plait|title=Kryptonite for the supermoon|work=Bad Astronomy|publisher=Discover|author=Phil Plait|accessdate=August 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The real association of the Moon with both [[tide|oceanic]] and [[crustal tide]]s has led to claims that the supermoon phenomenon may be associated with increased risk of events like [[earthquake]]s and [[volcanic eruption]]s, but no such link has been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.discovery.com/earth/super-moon-earthquake-no-link-110318.html|title=No Link Between 'Super Moon' and Earthquakes|publisher=Discovery News|author=Rachel Rice|accessdate=March 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He came up with the name while reading “Strategic Role Of Perigean Spring Tides in Nautical History and Coastal Flooding” published in 1976 by NOAA [[Hydrology|Hydrologist]] Fergus Wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.actforlibraries.org/what-is-a-super-moon/|title=What is a Super Moon|work=Actforlibraries.org|access-date=2018-01-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/strategicroleofp00wood|title=The Strategic Role of Perigean Spring Tides in Nautical History and Coastal Flooding, 1635-1976|last=Fergus|first=Wood|publisher=NOAA|year=1976|isbn=|location=Washington DC|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nolle never outlined why he chose 90%,&lt;ref name="Discover" /&gt; but explained in 2011 that he based calculations on 90% of the difference in lunar [[apsis]] extremes for the [[Tropical year|solar year]].

In practice, there is no official or even consistent definition of how near perigee the full Moon must occur to receive the supermoon label, and new moons rarely receive a supermoon label.  [[Sky &amp; Telescope|Sky and Telescope]] magazine refers to full Moon which comes within {{Convert|223,000|mi|km}}, TimeandDate.com prefers a definition of {{Convert|360000|km|mi}}. EarthSky uses Nolle's definition comparing their calculations to tables published by Nolle in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/why-experts-disagree-on-what-makes-a-supermoon#nolle|title=November 2017 full moon a supermoon? {{!}} EarthSky.org|website=earthsky.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.astropro.com/features/tables/cen21ce/suprmoon.html|title=Astrologer Richard Nolle's Century 21 CE SuperMoon Table|last=Nolle|first=Richard|website=www.astropro.com|access-date=2018-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''perigee-syzygy'' or ''perigee full/new moon'' is preferred in the scientific community.&lt;ref name="NASA"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2012/02may_supermoon/ |title=Perigee "Super Moon" On May 5–6  |author=Phillips, Tony |date=May 2, 2012 |work=NASA Science News |publisher=[[NASA]] |accessdate=6 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perigee is the point at which the Moon is closest in its orbit to the Earth, and [[Syzygy (astronomy)|syzygy]] is when the Earth, the Moon and the Sun are aligned, which happens at every [[full moon|full]] or [[new moon]].  Astrophysicist [[Fred Espenak]] uses Nolle's definition but preferring the label of ''full Moon at perigee''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Wood used the definition of a full or new moon occurring within 24 hours of perigee and also used the label ''perigee-syzygy''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Wood also coined the less used term ''proxigee'' where perigee and the full or new moon are separated by 10 hours or less.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Occurrence==
Of the possible 12 or 13 full (or new) moons each year, usually three or four may be classified as supermoons, as commonly defined.

The most recent full supermoon occurred on January 31, 2018, and the next one will be on December 22, 2018.{{update after|2018|12|22}}&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://astropixels.com/ephemeris/moon/fullperigee2001.html |title=Full Moon at Perigee (Super Moon): 2001 to 2100 |last=Espenak |first=Fred |date= |website=astropixels.com |accessdate=2018-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The one on November 14, 2016 was the closest full supermoon since January 26, 1948, and will not be surpassed until November 25, 2034.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What is a supermoon? |url=http://earthsky.org/space/what-is-a-supermoon |accessdate=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The closest full supermoon of the [[21st century]] will occur on December 6, 2052.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Closest supermoon since 1948! |url=http://earthsky.org/tonight/closest-supermoon-since-1948 |publisher=EarthSky |accessdate=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Moon distance with full &amp; new.png|thumb|800px|center|Supermoons will be the marked points nearest the bottom of the graph.]]

The oscillating nature of the [[lunar distance (astronomy)|distance]] to the full or new moon is due to the difference between the synodic and anomalistic [[lunar month|months]].&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The period of this oscillation is roughly 14 synodic months.

Occasionally, a supermoon coincides with a [[total lunar eclipse]]. The most recent occurrence of this was in [[January 2018 lunar eclipse|January 2018]], and the next will be in [[January 2019 lunar eclipse|January 2019]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Missed the super blue blood moon eclipse?

This is likely due to observations shortly after sunset when Moon is near the horizon and the [[moon illusion]] is at its most apparent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/what-is-a-supermoon/|title=What Is A Supermoon?

While the moon's surface [[luminance]] remains the same, because it is closer to the earth the [[illuminance]] is about 30% brighter than at its farthest point, or apogee. This is due to the inverse square law of light which changes the amount of light received on earth in inverse proportion to the distance from the moon.&lt;ref name="PhillipsNASA2011"&gt;{{cite web

== Effects on Earth ==
Claims that supermoons can cause natural disasters, and the claim of Nolle that supermoons cause "geophysical stress", have been refuted by scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2011/03/18/kryptonite-for-the-supermoon/|title=Kryptonite for the supermoon - Bad Astronomy|date=2011-03-18|work=Bad Astronomy|access-date=2018-01-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Can the position of the Moon affect seismicity? |url=http://seismo.berkeley.edu/faq/planets.html |publisher=The Berkeley Seismological Laboratory |accessdate=14 March 2011 |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Fuis |first=Gary |title=Can the position of the moon or the planets affect seismicity? |url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/learn/faq/?faqID=109 |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey: Earthquake Hazards Program |accessdate=14 March 2011 |type=No publication date |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110507062850/http://earthquake.usgs.gov/learn/faq/?faqID=109 |archivedate=7 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wolchover |first=Natalie |title=Will the March 19 "SuperMoon" Trigger Natural Disasters?. |publisher=Life's Little Mysteries |url=http://www.lifeslittlemysteries.com/will-supermoon-cause-earthquake-storm-natural-disasters-1442/ |accessdate=15 March 2011 |date=March 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Total Lunar Eclipses ==
Total lunar eclipses which fall on supermoon and micromoon days are relatively rare. In 21st century, there are 87 total lunar eclipses, of which 28 are supermoons and 6 are micromoons.

[[File:Vodyanoy.jpg|thumb|''Vodyanoy'' by [[Ivan Bilibin]], 1934]]
[[File:Малышев Водяной 1910.png|thumb|220px|V. Malyshev. Vodyanoy, 1910]]

In [[Slavic mythology]], '''vodyanoy''' or '''vodyanoi''' ({{lang-rus|водяно́й|p=vədʲɪˈnoj}}; [[Literal translation|lit.]] '[he] from the water' or 'watery') is a male water spirit. Vodník (or in Germanized form hastrman) in Czech fairy tales is the same creature as the Wassermann or [[Neck (water spirit)|nix]] of German fairy tales. 

Vodyanoy is said to appear as a naked old man with a [[frog]]-like face, greenish beard, and long hair, with his body covered in [[algae]] and muck, usually covered in black fish scales. He has webbed paws instead of hands, a fish's tail, and eyes that burn like red-hot coals. He usually rides along his river on a half-sunk log, making loud splashes. Consequently, he is often dubbed "grandfather" or "forefather" by the local people. Local drownings are said to be the work of the vodyanoy (or [[rusalka]]s).

When angered, the vodyanoy breaks dams, washes down water mills, and drowns people and animals. (Consequently, fishermen, millers, and also bee-keepers make sacrifices to appease him.) He would drag down people to his underwater dwelling to serve him as slaves.

==Vodník==
[[File:Splav7.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Typical projection of vodník in Czech or Slovak folklore]]
In [[Czech folklore|Czech]], [[slovene language|Slovene]]  and [[Slovak language|Slovak]] folklore the features of the vodník are markedly different to the East-Slavic conception; he has a completely human constitution and habits, except for few differences – vodníci (plural of vodník) have [[gill]]s, webbed membrane between their fingers and their skin is algae-green in colour (as well as their hair, which is typically of pale green tone). Their overall dress and appearance is weird, sometimes even resembling a vagrant; patchy shirts and (by modern standards) odd hats - often [[boater]]s with long speckled ribbons - are commonplace. They can withstand lingering for hours outside their ponds. When they do so, one can tell them unequivocally by their wet coat-tails from which water is dripping under all circumstances. The vodník's face is usually unshaven and it is not uncommon for a vodník to have a large, wet, tangled beard.

Czech, Slovenian and Slovak tales have both evil and good vodníci (relative to human beings) who do (or don't, respectively) try to drown people when they happen to swim in their territory. Vodníci would store the souls of the drowned in porcelain teapots. They consider their teapots as the most valuable heritage and display their "work", and number these cups they see as proportional to their wealth and/or status among other vodníci. When the lid of such a cup is removed, the soul within (in a form of a bubble) will escape and be liberated. Except for fish (or perhaps fish spirits), they do not have servants. Otherwise, vodníci spend their time by running their territory or – in their spare time – playing cards, smoking pipes or just sitting at the water surface (on rocks, willows nearby) and loitering. Fishermen ask the vodník for help by placing a pinch of tobacco in the water and saying, "Here's your tobacco, Lord Vodník, now give me a fish." In Czech, Slovak and Slovene tales vodníci live in ponds or rivers; there is no mention of a particular dwelling and the "half-sunken log" is unapparent. There are almost no references to vodníci in connection with [[sea water]], which it is supposed would be dangerous, even deadly for them.

* The first Slovene [[ballad]], written in 1826 by the Slovene national poet [[France Prešeren]], was titled "[[The Water Man]]" ({{lang|sl|Povodni mož}}). It is a narration about Urška, a flirt from [[Ljubljana]] that ended in the hands of a handsome man who happened to be a vodyanoy. The poem is based on a story from ''[[The Glory of Carniola]]'', about a dance at [[Old Square (Ljubljana)|Old Square]] in Ljubljana in July 1547, when Urška Šefer was enchanted by a vodyanoy and tugged to the [[Ljubljanica]]. Prešeren wrote it due to his unfulfilled love towards Zalika Dolenc. In the first publication of the poem, the flirt was named Zalika.
* Vodyanoy is one of the best known characters of the Soviet cartoons. In the Soviet animated film ''The Flying Ship'' (1979), he sings about his loneliness and need to talk with someone.
* [[David Wiltshire]]'s novel ''Child of Vodyanoi'' (adapted into the TV series ''[[The Nightmare Man]]'') used the water spirit as a metaphor for a miniature Russian submarine.
* Composer [[Antonín Dvořák]] wrote a [[symphonic poem]] entitled ''[[The Water Goblin|Vodník]]'' about this creature, who is also a character in his opera ''[[Rusalka (opera)|Rusalka]]''.
* In [[China Miéville]]'s [[Bas-Lag]] novels, the Vodyanoi are an aquatic people skilled in water-based magic. In Miéville's ''[[Perdido Street Station]]'', Vodyanoi dockworkers go on strike and use their magic to blockade a river shipping route.
* A vodyanoi named Hwiuur features in [[C. J. Cherryh]]'s Russian novel trilogy, ''[[Rusalka (book)|Rusalka]]'' (1989), ''[[Chernevog]]'' (1990), and ''[[Yvgenie]]'' (1991).
* The Vodyanoi appears as a monster in the 1st Edition Dungeons &amp; Dragons Fiend Folio, p.&amp;nbsp;93. It is described as a variety of ''[[Umber Hulk.]]''
* The 1974 Czechoslovak comedy film about the end of vodníks in Bohemia, [[How to Drown Dr. Mracek, the Lawyer]] ''(Jak utopit dr. Mráčka aneb Konec vodníků v Čechách)''
* ''[[The Witcher (video game)|The Witcher]]'' video game, based on the Polish book series ''[[The Witcher]]'' by [[Andrzej Sapkowski]], portrays a race of water creatures called the vodyanoi, also known as the Fishpeople.
* Aging vodnik is the main characted of a novel ''Hastrman'' by Czech writer [[Miloš Urban]] published in 2001. The novel won Czech literary price [[Magnesia Litera]] in 2002. Czech movie based on the first part of the novel was produced in 2018.
* Vodnik is the main character in the 2013 thriller ''Croaker'', written and directed by Pittsburgh area filmmaker Fred Terling
* A Vodyanoy features early in [[Larry Correia]]'s 2017 novel ''Monster Hunter Siege''.
* A Vodník appeared as an antagonist in episode 3 of the animated Netflix series ''[[Legend Quest (2017 TV series)|Legend Quest]]'', where it terrorized a village by stealing the souls of children.

== Definition, types and distribution of vulnerable waters ==

=== Ephemeral and intermittent headwater streams ===
[[Headwater]] streams refer to the smallest channels of a river network, where streamflow begins.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nadeau|first=Tracie-Lynn|last2=Rains|first2=Mark Cable|date=2007-02-01|title=Hydrological Connectivity Between Headwater Streams and Downstream Waters: How Science Can Inform Policy1|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1752-1688.2007.00010.x/abstract|journal=JAWRA Journal of the American Water Resources Association|volume=43|issue=1|pages=118–133|doi=10.1111/j.1752-1688.2007.00010.x|issn=1752-1688}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are considered first- to third-order streams in the [[Strahler number|Strahler 's]]  stream classification system.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Alexander, L. C., Autrey, B., DeMeester, J., Fritz, K. M., Golden, H. E., Goodrich, D. C., ... &amp; McManus, M. G. (2015). ''Connectivity of streams and wetlands to downstream waters: review and synthesis of the scientific evidence'' (Vol. 475). EPA/600/R-14.&lt;/ref&gt; The designation of [[Stream|intermittent and ephemeral stream]] refers to the continuum of streamflow within a year.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; An ephemeral stream flows episodically, following a precipitation event, while an intermittent stream flow continuously during a portion of the year. In both cases, the drying of the channel results from the local water table declining below the bed surface. The majority of ephemeral and intermittent streams are in headwater positions, but in lowland settings, small tributaries along the river network can be ephemeral or intermittent.

=== Geographically-isolated wetlands (GIWs) ===
Geographically isolated wetlands (GIWs) are wetlands entirely surrounded by uplands.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; GIWs receive water from adjacent uplands and precipitation.  However, no stream of any type supplies water to GIWs. Despite GIWs having poor hydrological connectivity with stream networks, they can exhibit subsurface connectivity or even temporary surface-water outflows toward other wetlands or streams.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilcox|first=Bradford P.|last2=Dean|first2=Dex D.|last3=Jacob|first3=John S.|last4=Sipocz|first4=Andrew|date=2011-06-01|title=Evidence of Surface Connectivity for Texas Gulf Coast Depressional Wetlands|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13157-011-0163-x|journal=Wetlands|volume=31|issue=3|pages=451–458|doi=10.1007/s13157-011-0163-x|issn=0277-5212}}&lt;/ref&gt; GIWs lacking complete surface or subsurface hydrological connectivity with any water body will lose water mainly by [[evapotranspiration]] or to groundwater that is not connected to a stream network.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Despite the absence of hydrological connectivity, they can exhibit biological and chemical connectivity with fluvial systems.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Non-floodplain wetlands ====
GIWs that are hydrologically connected (by subsurface connection or temporary surface connection) can be considered non-floodplain wetlands.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Non-floodplain wetlands are located outside floodplains and display a unidirectional hydrological connectivity with streams, meaning the water is flowing only toward stream located at lower elevations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Hydrological connectivity between non-floodplain wetlands and streams occurs through surface or subsurface processes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Surface connections can be ephemeral and intermittent streams.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McDonough|first=Owen T.|last2=Lang|first2=Megan W.|last3=Hosen|first3=Jacob D.|last4=Palmer|first4=Margaret A.|date=2015-02-01|title=Surface Hydrologic Connectivity Between Delmarva Bay Wetlands and Nearby Streams Along a Gradient of Agricultural Alteration|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13157-014-0591-5|journal=Wetlands|volume=35|issue=1|pages=41–53|doi=10.1007/s13157-014-0591-5|issn=0277-5212}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Morphological classification ===
In the USA, the natural types of GIWS are: prairie [[Pothole (landform)|pothole]] wetlands, playas, Nebraska’s [[Rainwater Basin]] and Sandhills wetlands, West Coast [[vernal pool]]s, sinkhole wetlands, [[Carolina bay]]s, intradunal and [[interdunal wetland]]s, desert springs, [[endorheic basin]] in the Great Basin, and [[Kettle (landform)|kettle-hole]] in glaciated regions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Non-floodplain wetlands are classified in three categories which include GIWs: depressional wetlands, slope wetlands and flats wetlands.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Depressional wetlands occur in topographic depressions with or without surface outlets.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Brinson, M. M. 1993. A hydrogeomorphic classification for wetlands. Technical Report WRP-DE-4, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Waterways Experiment Station, Wetlands Research Program, Vicksburg, MS.&lt;/ref&gt; Depressional wetlands include kettle holes, potholes, vernal pools, playas lake and Carolina bays. Slope wetlands are located along hillslopes and are mainly recharged by groundwater inputs.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Fens are the usual type of slope wetlands. Flats wetlands occur on large flat areas like [[interfluve]], dried lake bottoms or large floodplain terraces. Large playas are a type of mineral soil-dominated flats. Flats wetlands can also be formed from organic soils, like [[Peat bogs|peatbogs]].

GIWs and non-floodplain wetlands can emerge from one or a combination of geomorphological processes: aeolian (potholes, playas, Rainwater basin, Carolina Bays, interdunal wetlands), (peri-)glacial (kettle, fens), karstic (sinkholes) and lacustrine (Carolina Bays, endorheic basin).

=== Relative abundance of vulnerable waters ===
Ephemeral and intermittent headwater streams and GIWs display the shortest drainage area and stream length, but together they can represent the major proportion of river networks and [[Drainage basin|watersheds]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In the U.S., headwater streams represent more than 60% of the river network length&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, A. R., &amp; Peck, D. V. (2008). [https://swap.stanford.edu/20110202084338/http://www.epa.gov/bioindicators/pdf/Olsenandpeck2008_SurveydesignandextentestimatesfortheWadeableStreamsAssessment.pdf Survey design and extent estimates for the Wadeable Streams Assessment]. ''Journal of the North American Benthological Society'', ''27''(4), 822-836.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and geographically isolated wetlands encompass about 16% of freshwater resources.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Lane, C. R., &amp; D'Amico, E. (2016). [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1752-1688.12421 Identification of putative geographically isolated wetlands of the conterminous United States]. ''JAWRA Journal of the American Water Resources Association'', ''52''(3), 705-722.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 17 states, there are streams with an intermittent-stream-length-over-total-length's ratio higher than 82%.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; [[North Dakota]], [[South Dakota]] and [[Minnesota]] are the three states with the most hectares of geographically isolated wetlands.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Many studies report that actual maps of U.S. hydrographic network underestimate the distribution of headwater streams &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, W. F. (2001). [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037811270000503X Identifying stream types and management implications]. ''Forest Ecology and Management'', ''143''(1-3), 39-46.&lt;/ref&gt;

The approximate length of first to third order streams in the world is respectively 45 660 000, 22 061 000 and 10 660 100&amp;nbsp;km, and they represent the dominant Strahler' order of streams in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Downing, J. A., Cole, J. J., Duarte, C. M., Middelburg, J. J., Melack, J. M., Prairie, Y. T., ... &amp; Tranvik, L. J. (2012).

== Vulnerable water legal status ==
The legal status of ephemeral and intermittent headwater streams and GIWs differ from one legislation to another.

=== USA ===
In the USA, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has, since 1972, the responsibility to regulate the waters of the United States, under the Clean Water Act (CWA). The [[Clean Water Act]], introduced by president [[Richard Nixon]], made clear that continental waters should be "swimmable and fishable" for the American public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Porter|first=Pamela A.|last2=Mitchell|first2=Robert B.|last3=Moore|first3=Kenneth J.|date=2015-05-01|title=Reducing hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico: Reimagining a more resilient agricultural landscape in the Mississippi River Watershed|url=http://www.jswconline.org/content/70/3/63A|journal=Journal of Soil and Water Conservation|volume=70|issue=3|pages=63A–68A|doi=10.2489/jswc.70.3.63a|issn=0022-4561}}&lt;/ref&gt; That was a great step toward protection of riverine habitats and improvement of water quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wohl|first=Ellen|last2=Lane|first2=Stuart N.|last3=Wilcox|first3=Andrew C.|date=2015-08-01|title=The science and practice of river restoration|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2014WR016874/abstract|journal=Water Resources Research|volume=51|issue=8|pages=5974–5997|doi=10.1002/2014wr016874|issn=1944-7973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the U.S Constitution, the federal government can only protect interstate waters that is used for navigation, which is defined as the "waters of the United States" (WOTUS). From 1972 to 2015, the EPA defined WOTUS as:

"`[...] traditional navigable waters, interstate waters (including interstate wetlands), all other waters that could affect interstate or foreign commerce, impoundments of waters of the United States, tributaries, the territorial seas, and adjacent wetlands" (CWA, (33 CFR 328.3; 40 CFR 122.2)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The CWA defined wetlands as:

"[...] areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas." (CWA, section 404).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The definition of WOTUS was challenged in court several times, especially regarding the integration of isolated wetlands, but until the years 2000, the U.S. Federal Court stood by the initial definition saying that floodplain wetlands are bound to the streams they are adjacent to.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Then, In 2001, a judgement ruled that isolated wetlands are not comprised in the WOTUS definition because they do not show "significant nexus" with navigable streams. In 2006, in the Rapanos vs. United States case, further confusion was created concerning the WOTUS definition. No majority decision was obtained, as two main opinions divided the judges. The first one, defended by Justice Antonin Scalia, was that the scope of the CWA only included permanent streams and wetlands with a significant surface connections with navigable streams. The second opinion, led by Justice Anthony Kennedy, was that waters have a significant nexus with navigable waters if they are significantly affecting their chemical, physical, and biological integrity.

The definition of WOTUS is actually under revision.  The United States President, Donald Trump, signed the executive Order 13778 (82 FR 12495, March 3, 2017), asking the EPA and United States Army Corps of Engineers Corps to review the definition of WOTUS in a manner that is consistent with Justice Antonin Scalia's opinion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This opinion calls for protection of permanent waters and wetlands showing surface connections to relatively permanent waters,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which exclude GIWS, and ephemeral/intermittent streams.

=== European Union ===
In the European Union (EU), since 2000, the Water Framework Directive (WFD) aims to achieve a number of objectives to improve water quality of lakes, rivers and coastal areas.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/water/water-framework/info/intro_en.htm|title=Introduction to the new EU Water Framework Directive|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Key objectives are general protection of the aquatic ecosystem, protection of drinking water resources, and protection of swimmable waters.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; These objectives are realized through river management measures at basin scale.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The WFD requires the delineation of water bodies that will be targeted for specific diagnosis and management measures. The smallest area range considered to identify those water bodies is 10 to 100&amp;nbsp;km square. Due to their small size, headwater streams are not usually identified as one of the water bodies targeted by the WFD and, therefore, become more vulnerable to human activities.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

== Ecological functions ==
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) classifies headwater streams (including ephemeral/intermittent streams) and GIWs' ecological functions in five categories: source, sink, refuge, transformation and lag functions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ameli|first=A. A.|last2=Creed|first2=I. F.|date=2017-03-28|title=Quantifying hydrologic connectivity of wetlands to surface water systems|url=https://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/21/1791/2017/|journal=Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci.|volume=21|issue=3|pages=1791–1808|doi=10.5194/hess-21-1791-2017|issn=1607-7938}}&lt;/ref&gt; These functions depend on the level of connectivity (hydrological, sedimentological, biological) in-between the sub-components of a river system (channel, [[floodplain]], [[wetland]]s).&lt;ref&gt;Wohl, E. (2017). Connectivity in rivers. ''Progress in Physical Geography'', ''41''(3), 345-362.&lt;/ref&gt; Many functions are common among streams riverine wetlands and non-floodplain wetlands. Many more studies have been conducted on the role of headwater streams compare to GIWs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Source function ===
Headwaters streams and GIWs represent the dominant sources of material and energy in river networks. They export water, sediment, nutrients, organic debris and organisms from the upland areas to the downstream portion of the river network.

Headwater streams are the dominant source of water in a river network.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; They supply water downstream that is essential to aquatic habitats. They contribute to flooding, and in doing transfer sediments and nutrients to adjacent riverine habitats. Headwater streams are also typically erosion zones.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; They collect sediment from bank erosion and from [[colluvium]] in mountainous areas. Sediment inputs from headwater streams influence the dynamic equilibrium between runoff discharge and transport capacity, responsible for aggradation and degradation of channels.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, E. W. (1955). Importance of fluvial morphology in hydraulic engineering. ''Proceedings (American Society of Civil Engineers); v. 81, paper no. 745''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Headwater streams also collect wood, organic matter, nutrients and fine particles through erosion and flooding of riverine wetlands.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Headwater streams provide rich-nutrient waters that benefit micro-organisms, like algae and invertebrates.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For example, it was demonstrated that first-order streams contribute to 40% of nitrogen reaching fourth and fifth-order streams.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, R. B., Boyer, E. W., Smith, R. A., Schwarz, G. E., &amp; Moore, R. B. (2007). The role of headwater streams in downstream water quality. ''JAWRA Journal of the American Water Resources Association'', ''43''(1), 41-59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It was also demonstrated that headwater streams are sources of invertebrates that benefit the whole [[food chain]] downstream: [[salmonidae]] are a good example of species that benefit.&lt;ref&gt;Wipfli, M. S., &amp; Gregovich, D. P. (2002). [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2002.00826.x Export of invertebrates and detritus from fishless headwater streams in southeastern Alaska: implications for downstream salmonid production]. ''Freshwater Biology'', ''47''(5), 957-969.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Headwater streams supply organic matter downstream that is essential to physical and biological processes throughout the river network. They also deliver wood logs and wood debris that exert an influence over channel morphology, runoff velocity and on the spatial distribution of ecological habitats.&lt;ref&gt;Harmon, M. E., Franklin, J. F., Swanson, F. J., Sollins, P., Gregory, S. V., Lattin, J. D., ... &amp; Lienkaemper, G. W. (1986). Ecology of coarse woody debris in temperate ecosystems. In ''Advances in ecological research'' (Vol. 15, pp. 133-302). Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

GIWs can be the source of headwater streams. GIWs can provide the major proportion of stream's water in dry period.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Morley, T. R., Reeve, A. S., &amp; Calhoun, A. J. (2011). The role of headwater wetlands in altering streamflow and chemistry in a Maine, USA catchment. ''JAWRA Journal of the American Water Resources Association'', ''47''(2), 337-349.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the process of water transfer from a GIWs to a stream is depending on antecedent moisture conditions prevailing in the GIWs. Under saturated conditions, GIWs will supply water to other downstream water bodies, including streams.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; There are abundant and diverse microbial populations in GIWs.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Reddy, K. R., &amp; DeLaune, R. D. (2008). ''Biogeochemistry of wetlands: science and applications''. CRC press.&lt;/ref&gt; Low pH, low salinity and presence of organic matter create favorable conditions for the development of sulfate-reducing bacteria.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Grigal, D. F. (2002). Inputs and outputs of mercury from terrestrial watersheds: a review. ''Environmental Reviews'', ''10''(1), 1-39.&lt;/ref&gt; These bacteria are responsible for the production of methylmercury.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; GIWs are thus source of methylmercury, and other dissolved organic compounds and acids that can be transported downstream by temporary surface flows. Despite the fact the [[methylmercury]] is a particularly toxic pollutant, dissolved organic matter is a major source of energy for aquatic organisms located downstream in the river network.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Sink function ===
Sink function refers to the overall net import of energy and materials from the stream to the [[Riparian zone|riparian]] environment or outside the stream network.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In natural settings, many exchanges of water occur between headwater streams and their riparian environments. Bed friction and friction with the riparian surface during overbank flows result in a net loss of flow energy, especially in mountainous streams with coarse bed loads.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Church, M. (2006). Bed material transport and the morphology of alluvial river channels. ''Annu. Rev. Earth Planet. Sci.'', ''34'', 325-354.&lt;/ref&gt; It results in net decrease of the erosion capacity of the stream in its downstream section.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; In the riparian zone, friction and shallow water depth contributes to decreases in flow velocity and to the deposition of suspended sediments.&lt;ref&gt;Heimann, D. C., &amp; Roell, M. J. (2000). Sediment loads and accumulation in a small riparian wetland system in northern Missouri.

GIWs, like riverine wetlands, can intercept nutrients and other pollutants from point-sources (ex. ditchs, drainage pipes) or from diffuse (non-point) sources (ex. leaching from agricultural fields). Processes involved in capturing nutrients are various and include: the process of [[denitrification]],&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; phosphorus retention through plant assimilation&lt;ref&gt;Dunne, E.

=== Transformation function ===
Transformation function refers to the biogeochemical processing of organic and non-organic elements.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Nutrients entering headwater streams undergo many cycles of transformation through biological and chemical processes (absorption by algae, digestion by a fish, uptake by bacterias etc.). The cycling of nutrients through different forms and different compartments of the fluvial system is called “nutrient spiraling”. Organic matter will also undergo cycle of transformation in headwater streams, mainly through respiration by organisms and microbes.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Fisher, S. G., &amp; Likens, G. E. (1973). Energy flow in Bear Brook, New Hampshire: an integrative approach to stream ecosystem metabolism. ''Ecological monographs'', ''43''(4), 421-439.&lt;/ref&gt; Other processes of transformation of organic matter, like dead leaves,  include immersion,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Corti|first=Roland|last2=Datry|first2=T.|last3=Drummond|first3=L.|last4=Larned|first4=S.

Leaf litter age, chemical quality, and photodegradation control the fate of leachate dissolved organic matter in a dryland river. ''Journal of Arid Environments'', ''89'', 30-37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The exchanges of water through the [[Hyporheic zone|hyporheic]] zone of headwater streams can also mediate the form and mobility of pollutants, hereby decreasing pollutant concentrations downstream.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In riverine wetlands, a lot of transformation processes occur in which nutrients and other compounds are lost to the atmosphere&lt;ref&gt;Mitsch, W. J., J. G. Gosselink, C. Anderson, J., and L. Zhang. 2009. Wetland ecosystems. 1st edition. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Hoboken, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; or sequestered in the soil or vegetation.

Transformation of elemental mercury to methylmercury is performed by microbial communities living in acidic wetlands (see Source function). Methylmercury is a toxic form of mercury that is very mobile and that accumulates in the food chain.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Denitrification is another transformation process occurring in GIWs.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Lag function ===
Lag function refers to the transient storage of energy and materials. Because they are the dominant sources of water in stream network,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; headwater streams and wetlands have a great impact on the frequency, duration and magnitude of downstream transfer of materials and energy. The intensity of the lag function is correlated to the abundance and diversity of local storage components (wetlands, alluvial aquifers, stream banks and floodplains) and to the level of connectivity between these components.

In headwaters streams, flowing water interacts with channel bedforms, stream banks and vegetation. These interactions result in reduced flow velocity and transient storage of groundwater, which lessen the flood's magnitude during heavy precipitation events.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; On the other end, during the dry season, the transient storage and delayed transfer of groundwater to the stream will maintain a minimum baseflow&lt;ref&gt;Tetzlaff, D., &amp; Soulsby, C. (2008). Sources of baseflow in larger catchments–Using tracers to develop a holistic understanding of runoff generation.

Stream water infiltration, bank storage, and storage zone changes due to stream-stage fluctuations. ''Journal of Hydrology'', ''280''(1-4), 246-264.&lt;/ref&gt; essential for aquatic species. The same process applies for sediments, nutrients and organic matter being transported downstream from the upper areas of a watershed and being temporarily stored in the floodplain, including riverine wetlands.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Living organisms present in headwater streams contribute to delaying the downstream transfer of sediments, nutrients and organic matter through consumption,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; assimilation,&lt;ref&gt;Withers, P. J. A., &amp; Jarvie, H. P. (2008). Delivery and cycling of phosphorus in rivers: a review. ''Science of the Total Environment'', ''400''(1-3), 379-395.&lt;/ref&gt; and bioconsolidation.&lt;ref&gt;Pringle, C. M., Blake, G. A., Covich, A. P., Buzby, K. M., &amp; Finley, A. (1993).

''Oecologia'', ''93''(1), 1-11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Transient storage of water in GIWs contributes to a delay in input of precipitation water to streams or other connected water bodies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Such a function secures the base flow of streams and contributes to recharging local and regional aquifers, especially during dry periods&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Transient storage in GIWs contributes also to lessening flood magnitude during heavy precipitation events or during melt periods.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, D. E., &amp; Linder, R. L. (1986). [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Daniel_Hubbard2/publication/279547766_Spring_runoff_retention_in_prairie_pothole_wetlands/links/561e6f2008aecade1accb6ee/Spring-runoff-retention-in-prairie-pothole-wetlands.pdf Spring runoff retention in prairie pothole wetlands]. ''Journal of Soil and Water Conservation'', ''41''(2), 122-125.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  In contrast, because storage capacity is largely determined by antecedent moisture conditions, a saturated GIWs will convey water downstream rapidly, which could increase flood magnitude.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Following this idea, GIWs can also reduce base flow, through storage and evapotranspiration, when saturation conditions are low.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

'''Weather''' is the state of the [[atmosphere]], describing for example the degree to which it is hot or cold, wet or dry, calm or stormy, clear or cloudy.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster Dictionary.

Weather refers to day-to-day temperature and [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] activity, whereas [[climate]] is the term for the averaging of atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = Climate | encyclopedia = Glossary of Meteorology | publisher = [[American Meteorological Society]] | url = http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=climate1 | accessdate =14 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When used without qualification, "weather" is generally understood to mean the weather of [[Earth]].

Weather is driven by air pressure, temperature and moisture differences between one place and another.  These differences can occur due to the sun's angle at any particular spot, which varies with [[latitude]]. The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the largest scale [[atmospheric circulation]]s: the Hadley Cell, the Ferrel Cell, the Polar Cell, and the [[jet stream]].  Weather systems in the [[mid-latitudes]], such as [[extratropical cyclone]]s, are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow.  Because the Earth's [[Earth's rotation|axis]] is tilted relative to its orbital plane, [[sunlight]] is incident at different angles at different times of the year.  On Earth's surface, temperatures usually range ±40&amp;nbsp;°C (−40&amp;nbsp;°F to 100&amp;nbsp;°F) annually.  Over thousands of years, changes in Earth's [[orbit]] can affect the amount and distribution of [[solar energy]] received by the Earth, thus influencing long-term climate and global [[climate change]].

Surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences.  Higher altitudes are cooler than lower altitudes, as most atmospheric heating is due to contact with the Earth's surface while radiative losses to space are mostly constant.  Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] for a future time and a given location.  The Earth's weather system is a [[chaos theory|chaotic system]]; as a result, small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole.  Human attempts to [[weather control|control the weather]] have occurred throughout history, and there is evidence that human activities such as agriculture and industry have modified weather patterns.

Studying how the weather works on other planets has been helpful in understanding how weather works on Earth.  A famous landmark in the [[Solar System]], [[Jupiter]]'s ''[[Great Red Spot]]'', is an [[Anticyclone|anticyclonic]] storm known to have existed for at least 300 years.  However, weather is not limited to planetary bodies.  A star's [[corona]] is constantly being lost to space, creating what is essentially a very thin atmosphere throughout the Solar System.  The movement of mass ejected from the [[Sun]] is known as the [[solar wind]].

On [[Earth]], the common [[List of meteorological phenomena|weather phenomena]] include wind, [[cloud]], rain, snow, [[fog]] and [[dust storm]]s. Less common events include [[natural disaster]]s such as [[tornado]]es, [[Tropical cyclone|hurricanes]], [[typhoons]] and [[Winter storm|ice storms]]. Almost all familiar weather phenomena occur in the troposphere (the lower part of the atmosphere).&lt;ref name="trop" /&gt;  Weather does occur in the stratosphere and can affect weather lower down in the troposphere, but the exact mechanisms are poorly understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsfc.nasa.gov/topstory/20011018windsurface.html |title=Weather Forecasters May Look Sky-high For Answers |last=O'Carroll |first=Cynthia M. |publisher=[[Goddard Space Flight Center]] (NASA) |date=18 October 2001 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090712090309/http://www.gsfc.nasa.gov/topstory/20011018windsurface.html |archivedate=12 July 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weather occurs primarily due to  air pressure, temperature and [[moisture]] differences between one place to another.  These differences can occur due to the [[sun]] angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude from the tropics. In other words, the farther from the tropics one lies, the lower the sun angle is, which causes those locations to be cooler due the spread of the [[sunlight]] over a greater surface.&lt;ref&gt;[[NASA]].

Because the Earth's [[Earth's rotation|axis]] is tilted relative to its orbital plane, [[sunlight]] is incident at different angles at different times of the year. In June the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the [[sun]], so at any given Northern Hemisphere latitude sunlight falls more directly on that spot than in December (see [[Effect of sun angle on climate]]).&lt;ref&gt;Windows to the Universe.

This causes the rainwater to be slightly acidic, which aids the erosive properties of water. The released sediment and chemicals are then free to take part in [[chemical]] reactions that can affect the surface further (such as [[acid rain]]), and sodium and chloride ions [[sea salt|(salt)]] deposited in the seas/oceans. The sediment may reform in time and by geological forces into other rocks and soils. In this way, weather plays a major role in [[erosion]] of the surface.&lt;ref&gt;West Gulf River Forecast Center.

The [[chaos theory|chaotic]] nature of the atmosphere, the massive computational power required to solve the equations that describe the atmosphere, error involved in measuring the initial conditions, and an incomplete understanding of atmospheric processes mean that forecasts become less accurate as the difference in current time and the time for which the forecast is being made (the ''range'' of the forecast) increases.

In some areas, people use weather forecasts to determine what to wear on a given day. Since outdoor activities are severely curtailed by heavy [[rain]], [[snow]] and the [[wind chill]], forecasts can be used to plan activities around these events, and to plan ahead to survive through them.

==Modification==
The aspiration to [[Weather modification|control the weather]] is evident throughout human history: from ancient rituals intended to bring rain for crops to the U.S. Military [[Operation Popeye]], an attempt to disrupt [[Military supply chain management|supply lines]] by lengthening the North Vietnamese [[monsoon]]. The most successful attempts at influencing weather involve [[cloud seeding]]; they include the [[fog]]- and low [[Stratus cloud|stratus]] dispersion techniques employed by major airports, techniques used to increase [[snow|winter precipitation]] over mountains, and techniques to suppress [[hail]].&lt;ref name="AMS"&gt;[http://www.ametsoc.org/policy/wxmod98.html American Meteorological Society] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612213920/http://ametsoc.org/policy/wxmod98.html |date=12 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent example of weather control was China's preparation for the [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Summer Olympic Games]]. China shot 1,104 rain dispersal rockets from 21 sites in the city of [[Beijing]] in an effort to keep rain away from the opening ceremony of the games on 8 August 2008. Guo Hu, head of the Beijing Municipal Meteorological Bureau (BMB), confirmed the success of the operation with 100 millimeters falling in [[Baoding]] City of [[Hebei Province]], to the southwest and Beijing's [[Fangshan District]] recording a rainfall of 25 millimeters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last = Huanet | first = Xin| title = Beijing disperses rain to dry Olympic night| publisher = Chinaview| date = 9 August 2008| url = http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-08/09/content_9079637.htm| accessdate =24 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas there is inconclusive evidence for these techniques' efficacy, there is extensive evidence that human activity such as agriculture and industry results in inadvertent weather modification:&lt;ref name="AMS" /&gt;

Weather is not limited to planetary bodies.  Like all stars, the sun's [[corona]] is constantly being lost to space, creating what is essentially a very thin [[atmosphere]] throughout the [[Solar System]].  The movement of mass ejected from the Sun is known as the [[solar wind]].  Inconsistencies in this wind and larger events on the surface of the star, such as [[coronal mass ejection]]s, form a system that has features analogous to conventional weather systems (such as pressure and wind) and is generally known as [[space weather]].  Coronal mass ejections have been tracked as far out in the [[solar system]] as [[Saturn]].&lt;ref&gt;Bill Christensen.

The interaction of the [[solar wind]] with the terrestrial atmosphere can produce spectacular [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurorae]],&lt;ref&gt;AlaskaReport.
