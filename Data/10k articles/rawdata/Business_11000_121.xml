He currently presides over the [[Anna Lindh Euro-Mediterranean Foundation for the Dialogue Between Cultures]], based in [[Alexandria, Egypt]]. He is also President of the Executive Committee of the [[Foundation for the Three Cultures and the Three Religions]], based in [[Seville, Spain]], a founding member of the C-100 Davos Forum for the Dialogue of Civilisations and religions, and was formerly Executive Vice-President of the [[BNP Paribas]], [[Paris]]. His daughter is [[UNESCO]] Director-General [[Audrey Azoulay]].

==Early life==
Born in [[Essaouira]], in 1941 to a [[Moroccan Jewish]] family, André Azoulay was educated in Paris where he studied economics, journalism and international relations. Previously to his current position as Counsellor to the King of Morocco, Azoulay, had a long career within the [[Paribas]] Bank in Paris (1968 to 1990) where, as Executive Vice-President, he covered the [[MENA|Middle East and North Africa Region]] as well as heading the bank’s Public Affairs department.

As Counsellor of the late King Hassan II from (1991 to 1999), and since then of king Mohammed VI, André Azoulay has largely contributed to the implementation of economic reforms, which have been applied throughout the kingdom since their inception in the early 1990s. He also played a significant role in the privatisation and deregulation programs which began in 1993. He emphasized the need for sustaining the role of the private sector and encouraging the international investment to sustain economic growth in Morocco. Azoulay has also largely contributed to promote Morocco throughout the world.

==Peace builder==
Azoulay is also known for his historical input in the follow-up of the peace process in the Middle East and the many initiatives he has been involved in the perspective of deepening the logic of reconciliation between Jews and Muslims. In addition to his professional responsibilities André Azoulay has always fought for peace and dialogue between the Arab Muslim World and that of the Jewish communities in Europe, the United States, Morocco as well as the Arab, [[Berbers|Berber]] and Jewish diasporas worldwide.

For over 40 years, Azoulay has taken an active part in supporting the activities of different movements and associations whose vocation is the [[two-state solution]] (Palestine and Israel) and to help the process of better understanding and mutual respect between Islam and the Western World.

President of the Executive Committee of the Foundation of the Three Cultures and the Three Religions based in Seville (Spain) he is one of the founders of the Aladin Group (Paris) created to promote mutual knowledge and intercultural relations among Muslims and Jews.

In August 2005, Azoulay was also nominated member of the "High Level Group" for the "Alliance of Civilizations, set up by the United Nations. Instigated by Spain and co-sponsored by Turkey, this initiative is addressing the issue of the relations between Islam and the Western world.

In this context, he was elected 5 March 2008 and reelected 9 September 2011 as President of the Euro-Mediterranean Anna Lindh Foundation, and member of the Executive Committee of the Mediterranean Council for Culture (Paris) as well as Board member of the Mediterranean Study and Research Center (Marseille) the Yala online leadership Academy and the Institut de Prospective et d’Etudes pour le Monde Méditerranéen (Paris).

Member of the Board of Al Akhawayne University (Ifrane), the Mediterranean University (Fès) and the High Council of the Alliance Israelite Universelle, Azoulay belongs to the Scientific Committee of "Medinas" a think-tank created by the World Bank and the European Investment Bank to protect, restore and promote the "Medinas" in the Arab World. He is also member of the boards of the Institute Pierre Mendès-France (Paris) and YALA (Young Araba Leaders for Peace).

Belonging to the Board of several economic and financial institutions, André Azoulay is a member of the Royal Academy of Morocco and of the Royal Academy of Spain for Economic and Financial Sciences.  He has been honoured with the titles of "Commandeur dans l’Ordre du Trône" (Morocco) and he has received many awards and titles of honour throughout the world (France, Spain, Italy, Germany, U.K., Portugal, Brazil, Mexico, Argentina). André Azoulay received the Lifetime Achievement Award, from the [[American Sephardi Federation]] in New York, where [[Enrico Macias]] and [[David Serero (opera singer)|David Serero]] performed during the ceremony in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2017/03/210421/andre-azoulay-receive-american-sephardi-federations-lifetime-achievement-award/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Essaouira==

With his wife Katia, also born in [[Essaouira]], who published 2 books "Essaouira-Mogador : Parfums d’Enfance" and "Essaouira-Mogador : Passion partagée", he is the architect of the renaissance of the city they both hold very dear to their hearts. André Azoulay is fervent in the promotion and revival of his home town which has a specific place in the historical, cultural and spiritual heritage of Morocco. He is the founder President of the Association Essaouira-Mogador which has established since 1992 an original approach to the durable development based on its cultural diversity and spiritual legacy.

Essaouira is justly proud to host seven music festivals a year, ranging from classical to lyrical. They include the renowned [[Gnaoua World Music Festival]], the Chamber Music with "le Printemps Musical des Alizés" and the rich Judeo-Muslim repertoire of Andalusian-Atlantic Festival, a unique event in the world inviting on the same stage, every year, poets, musicians and singers, Muslims and Jews, to keep alive and to perform their common heritage and legacy.

'''Carl Roth II''' was a Swedish [[ironmaster]] who lived between the 17th and 18th centuries. He is best known for owning two [[ironworks]] in [[Karlstad Municipality]], [[Värmland County]], [[Sweden]]: Duvnäs (Duvenäs), and Nedre Fösked (Föske).

==Early life==
[[File:Gustav III of Sweden at the Gustavianum in 1786.jpg|thumb|left|250px| 1792 drawing of Uppsala University by Louis [[Louis Jean Desprez]]]]
Carl was born on October 12, 1753, in [[Stockholm]]. On June 26, 1764, at the age of 10, he enrolled at [[Uppsala University]] under [[Stockholms nation|Stockholm's Nation]]. After graduating in 1771, he moved with his parents to their estate at Duvnäs where he focused primarily on agriculture and working at the family's [[Mill (grinding)|mill]]. Carl was said to have a Godly and humble disposition and loved books above all else.

==Later life==
Carl presumebly took over operations at Duvnäs upon his father's death in 1788. On December 12, 1794, at the age of 42 he married Elisabeth Antonsson at Molkoms Mill. She was the only daughter of the Värmland renowned [[ironmaster]], Judge Reinhold Antonsson. In 1795 he purchased Nedre Fösked from his brother, Benjamin, and captain Lars von Nackrej where all of his children were born. He worked as ironmaster of both Ironworks until 1817 when he sold them to the wholesaler Per Gustaf Geijer. He then rented a mill at Kjern (Tjärn) until 1830 when he purchased a home in [[Karlstad]]. Carl II died at the age of 80 on Friday the 30th of November, 1832 in Karlstad.

[[File:Comfort, v. XVI, no. 4, February 1904.jpg|thumb|Comfort, v. XVI, no. 4, February 1904]]
'''''Comfort''''' was a mail order magazine published in [[Augusta, Maine]] from 1888 to 1942.  Published by [[Guy Gannett Communications|Gannet &amp; Morris]] and edited initially by William H. Gannet, ''Comfort'' was touted as "the key to happiness and success in over a million and quarter homes."&lt;ref name="Mott"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mott|first1=Frank Luther|title=A History of American Magazines, 1885-1905, Vol. 4|date=1957|publisher=The Belknap Press of the Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|page=365-366}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1888, William H. Gannet created ''Comfort'' primarily as a means to advertise his [[patent medicine]], Giant Oxien, a variant of [[Moxie|The Moxie Nerve Food]].&lt;ref name="Sayward"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sayward|first1=Dorothy Steward|title=Comfort Magazine, 1888-1942: A History and Critical Study|journal=University of Maine Bulletin|date=January 1960|volume=62|issue=13|page=7-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;   ''Comfort''{{'}}s circulation increased from 13,000, in 1888, to 1.3 million, in 1894, which made ''Comfort'' the first publication in America to reach a circulation of 1 million.&lt;ref name="Mott"/&gt; In order to handle this increase in circulation, Gannet purchased a new rotary color convertible web-fed press, which was one of the first of its kind in the country.&lt;ref name="Weber"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weber|first1=Clara Carter|title=Comfort Magazine|journal=Colby Library Quarterly|date=November 1955|volume=4|issue=4|page=81|url=http://digitalcommons.colby.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1474&amp;context=cq|accessdate=April 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increase in ''Comfort''{{'}}s circulation was primarily due to its use of premiums to generate subscriptions.  Premiums, essentially rewards like sewing machines or clothing, were given to people who submitted "clubs" or lists of new subscribers.  As [[Frank Luther Mott]] notes in his book, ''A History of American Magazines'', the use of the "'club' device made the solicitor virtually a local subscription agent for the periodical."&lt;ref name="Mott2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mott|first1=Frank Luther|title=A History of American Magazines, 1885-1905, Vol. 4|date=1957|publisher=The Belknap Press of the Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|page=17-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Most of the time, publishers of mail-order magazines did not depend on the collection of subscription fees and instead generated income by selling their subscription lists to advertisers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zuckerman|first1=Mary Ellen|title=A History of Popular Women's Magazines in the United States, 1792-1995|date=1998|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, CT|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of not collecting subscriptions fees went against the [[United States Post Office Department|United States Post Office Department's]] criteria that required publications to maintain "a legitimate list of subscribers" in order to take advantage of the low second-class mailing rate of one-cent per pound.&lt;ref name="USPS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=United States Postal Service|title=Postal Rates for Periodicals: A Narrative History|url=https://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/periodicals-postage-history.htm|website=About|accessdate=April 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In 1907, as a way to curb further abuse of the second-class postal rate, the US Post Office mandated that all subscription fees must be paid in advance.  Many mail-order magazines could not meet this requirement and folded.   The publishers of ''Comfort'', who were more firm about collecting payment than other mail-order magazine publishers, lowered ''Comfort''{{'}}s price to 15 cents a year in order to meet with the new regulations.&lt;ref name="Mott3"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mott|first1=Frank Luther|title=A History of American Magazines, 1885-1905, Vol. 4|date=1957|publisher=The Belknap Press of the Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|page=365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To prevent mail-order magazines from becoming little more than advertisement catalogs, the US Post Office also required mail-order magazines provide readers with "information of a public character, or devoted to literature, the sciences, arts, or some special industry."&lt;ref name="USPS" /&gt;   This regulation may explain why ''Comfort'' claimed on its front page to be "devoted to art, literature, science, and the home circle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.library.villanova.edu/Item/vudl:395358 |title=Comfort, v. XX, no. 1, November 1907|website= Digital Library @ Villanova University|accessdate=April 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In addition to the columns of advertisements, ''Comfort'' provided readers with various articles geared to meet the needs and interests of every member of the rural, American family.  With articles like "In &amp; Around the Home,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.library.villanova.edu/Item/vudl:378294 |title=Comfort, v. XVI, no. 4, February 1904|website=  Digital Library @ Villanova University|accessdate=April 21, 2016|page= 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Comfort Sisters' Recipes,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.library.villanova.edu/Item/vudl:303790 |title=Comfort, v. XXXI, no. 6, April 1919|website=Digital Library @ Villanova University|accessdate=April 21, 2016|page=  5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and "The Pretty Girls' Club,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.library.villanova.edu/Item/vudl:357396 |title=Comfort, v. XXXIII, no. 10, August 1921|website=  Digital Library @ Villanova University.|accessdate=April 21, 2016|page=  14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  much of ''Comfort'' was dominated by content for women, which offered advice and information on cooking, sewing, health, and beauty.  ''Comfort'' also printed articles aimed at men, although not as many, such as "The Modern Farmer" and "Automobile and Gas Engine Helps."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.library.villanova.edu/Item/vudl:378505 |title=Comfort, v. XXIX, no. 6, April 1907|website=  Digital Library @ Villanova University|accessdate=April 21, 2016|page= 13, 18}}&lt;/ref&gt;   For children, ''Comfort'' occasionally published puzzles, activities, and comics.  

Another prominent feature of ''Comfort'' was its short and serialized fiction.  When ''Comfort'' was first published, much of the fiction was written by William H. Gannet as a means to further plug Giant Oxien and other products displayed in the magazine's advertisements.  From roughly September 1892 to April 1902, ''Comfort'' offered prizes to readers who submitted works of fiction for publication.  In later years, ''Comfort'' went on to publish fiction written by more legitimate and well known authors such as [[Augusta Jane Evans]], [[Sarah Elizabeth Forbush Downs|Mrs. Georgie Sheldon]], [[Horatio Alger Jr.]], [[Charles Felton Pidgin]], and [[L. M. Montgomery]].  The fiction published in ''Comfort'' was usually highly moral and typically fell into three genres: [[List of genres#Adventure|Adventure]], [[List of genres#Mystery|Mystery]], or [[List of Genres#Romance|Sentimental Romance]].&lt;ref name="Sayward 2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sayward|first1=Dorothy Steward|title=Comfort Magazine, 1888-1942: A History and Critical Study|journal=University of Maine Bulletin|date=January 1960|volume=62|issue=13|page=58-61}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, ''Comfort'' printed stories for children.  The Cubby Bear stories, written by Lena B. Ellingwood and illustrated by [[Harrison Cady]], were the most regular children's fiction published in ''Comfort''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.library.villanova.edu/Item/vudl:303790 |title=Comfort, v. XXXI, no. 6, April 1919|website=  Digital Library @ Villanova University|accessdate=April 21, 2016|page= 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, ''Comfort'' was sold to the Needlecraft Publishing Corporation.  Needlecraft Publishing continued to publish ''Comfort'' for two years until it was combined with ''Needlecraft'' magazine, which ceased to be published soon after.&lt;ref name="Mott3" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11777">The '''Common Final Examination (CFE)''' is the last [[Test (assessment)|examination]] [[Chartered Professional Accountant|CPA Students]] took in pursuit of the Chartered Professional Accountant (CPA) designation in Canada. The 3-day CFE is also reputed to be among the world's most challenging professional exams where students are required to use an integrative business thinking model to obtain the designation. Previously known as the Uniform Evaluation (UFE), the UFE has been discontinued following the unification of the three accounting designations (CA, CMA, CGA) in [[Canada]] and [[Bermuda]] in June 2015.

Administered nationally by [[CPA Canada]], and conducted regionally by the provincial/regional orders, the CFE is written over the course of three sequential days and is the culmination of years of study in [[financial accounting]], [[management accounting]], [[corporate finance]], [[performance management]], [[taxation]] and other business-related university courses. Writing the CFE requires successful completion of preliminary education requirements including CPA preparatory courses and Professional Education Program (PEP). Upon passing the CFE and 30 months of approved practical experiences, the candidate will become a [[Chartered Professional Accountant]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The new Chartered Professional Accountant (CPA) certification program: Overview |url=https://www.cpacanada.ca/en/become-a-cpa/why-become-a-cpa/the-cpa-certification-program/the-cpa-certification-program-overview |website=CPA Canada |publisher=CPA Canada |accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The Common Final Exam is typically offered once per year in September (Fall). Sometimes, it may be offered twice a year in Spring and Fall (such as May and September 2016). The upcoming CFE dates are: September 11 - September 13, 2019. Two CFEs are scheduled for 2020, between May 26 - May 29 and September 9 - September 11, 2020&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Common Final Examination |url=https://www.cpacanada.ca/en/become-a-cpa/cpa-certification-program-evaluation/cpa-certification-capstone-1-cfe-cases |website=CPA Canada |publisher=CPA Canada |accessdate=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Exam Structure ==

Students must demonstrate the depth and breadth of their abilities according to the CPA Competency Map. Students answer questions which are presented in the form of business cases that include a combination of both explicit and implicit requirements for each case's "users", followed by a list of exhibits that provide case facts from which observations, suggestions and conclusions are derived. Common scenarios include providing advice on how to conduct an audit, advising a client on the pros and cons of investing funds in a given business venture, and providing support to an organization as an internal accountant or auditor. 

All students must demonstrate "depth" in financial reporting or management accounting for the CFE, and one of the elective areas. Students should also demonstrate "breadth" in all 6 competency areas.

The 3-day exam consisted of case based simulations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How each day of the CFE works |url=http://www.cfeblog.ca/2016/01/22/how-each-day-of-the-cfe-works/ |website=CFE Blog |publisher=CFE Blog |accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;: 
* Day 1: candidates will have 4 hours to write a case in relation to the Capstone 1 group project. Candidates will be assessed on enabling competencies such as communications skills and professionalism, as well as some technical competencies.

* Day 2: students would choose an elective "depth" area from 4 competency areas - Performance Management, Finance, Assurance or Taxation. Day 2 will last 5 hours in length and students must be "Competent" in the chosen elective area as well as either Financial Reporting or Management Accounting. Note that students wishing to pursue a Public Accounting Licence must have passed Assurance and Taxation from their prior PEP modules and show depth in both Financial Reporting and Assurance on the CFE &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Elective Depth Role |url=https://www.cpaontario.ca/become-a-cpa/complete-your-designation/cpa-pep-cfe |website=CPA Ontario |publisher=CPA Ontario |accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Become a Licensed Public Accountant (LPA) |url=https://www.cpaontario.ca/become-a-cpa/why-cpa/program-info/public-accountant-licence |website=Public Accountant Licence |publisher=CPA Ontario |accessdate=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

* Day 3: multiple (usually 3) multi-competency cases would be provided within a time frame of 4 hours aimed to evaluate the student's "breadth" in the competency map. A minimum "Reaching Competent (RC)" grade must be achieved for every single competency (all 6 areas). 

===Evaluation Criteria===
All CPA cases are evaluated based on "Competency Ratings". They are:
* '''Not Addressed (NA)''': Candidate has not addressed the Assessment Opportunity.
* '''Not Competent (NC)''': Candidate has addressed the Assessment Opportunity, but the analysis is incorrect or not related to the issue.
* '''Reaching Competent (RC)''': RCs and Cs are both counted towards "Breadth" test for day 3. RC candidates demonstrate more proficiency and understanding than NC, but not at the Competent level.
* '''Competent (C)''': the amount of Cs are used for the "depth" test on day 2. Competent candidates demonstrate the required competency levels as expected by a CPA.
* '''Competent with Distinction (CD)''': Candidates are not expected to achieve this high level of competency. CDs are essentially Cs in terms of exam grading.

===Pass and Fail Decision===
The evaluation decision is separate into day 1 and day 2 with day 3. A student must pass all 3 days in order to "pass the CFE". However, Day 1 is marked separately and Day 2 &amp; 3 are marked together. Therefore, a candidate can pass Day 1 and fail Day 2 &amp; 3 and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Common Final Examination (CFE) Enrolment FAQs |url=https://www.cpaontario.ca/become-a-cpa/complete-your-designation/cpa-pep-cfe/cpa-common-final-examination/common-final-examination-enrolment-faq |website=CPA Ontario |publisher=CPA Ontario |accessdate=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*If a student passes Day 1 and fails Days 2 &amp; 3, the student has to write Days 2 &amp; 3 on their next attempt.
*If a student fails Day 1 and passes Days 2 &amp; 3, the student has to write Day 1 on their next attempt (the Capstone 1 case may be different and the student will need to ensure they are comfortable with the new Capstone 1 case).
*If the student fails all three days, they must rewrite all three days.

A candidate may attempt the Common Final Examination 3 times maximum. A student will be deregistered after their third unsuccessful attempt at either Core 1, Core 2, Capstone 1, Capstone 2 or the CFE. A student may not be admitted back to CPA or re-registered except in extraordinary circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Common Final Examination - Frequently Asked Questions |url=https://www.cpaontario.ca/become-a-cpa/complete-your-designation/cpa-pep-cfe/cfe-results-faqs |website=CFE Results FAQs |publisher=CPA Ontario |accessdate=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pass Rates==

The exam is administered once per year during September and approximately 5,500 students attempt the exam each year.  National pass rates for 2003 to 2008 have been 65.5%,&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Chartered Accountants in Canada and Bermuda: "Uniform Evaluation Report 2003", page 12. The Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; 74.5%,&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Chartered Accountants in Canada and Bermuda: "Uniform Evaluation Report 2004", page 12. The Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; 74.0%,&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Chartered Accountants in Canada and Bermuda: "Uniform Evaluation Report 2005", page 12.

The Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; 74.6%,&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Chartered Accountants in Canada and Bermuda: "Uniform Evaluation Report 2007", page 12. The Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and 71.7%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.casb.com/index.php?catid=65|title=CA School of Business UFE Statistics|accessdate=2008-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; respectively. Exam results are released in late November following each September sitting of the UFE.

Beginning with the September 2009 UFE, the Board of Evaluators no longer releases statistics on pass rates.

The CFE Board of Evaluators began releasing statistics on pass rates along with Board Reports on candidate performance. The following are the first attempts of CFE Pass Rates for CFE&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=CPA certification program: Examination performance rates |url=https://www.cpacanada.ca/en/become-a-cpa/cpa-certification-program-evaluation/cpa-examination-performance-rates |website=CPA Canada |publisher=CPA Canada |accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;:
* 2017 September CFE 77.6%
* 2016 September CFE 76.8%
* 2016 May CFE 68.7%
* 2015 September CFE 82.9%

== Exam Entry Method ==

Since 2005, students have been able to type in their responses on laptop computers secured with Securexam (CA) lockdown software in all regions of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cica.ca/becoming-a-ca/the-ufe/computers-in-the-ufe/index.aspx|title=Computers in the UFE|accessdate=2008-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of computer is no longer voluntary. It became a requirement to use a computer starting with the 2009 UFE.

== CFE Honour Roll &amp; Gold Medal ==
Every CFE, the Board would release the Honour Roll recipients along with the CFE results. The CFE honour roll members consists of the nation's top 1% performers on the exam and recognizes performance in the exam that demonstrated academic excellence and exceptional abilities. The Honour Roll of 68 candidates is determined as the top 1% of the first-time writers that wrote all three days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Common Final Examination (CFE) honour roll |url=https://www.cpacanada.ca/en/become-a-cpa/cpa-certification-program-evaluation/common-final-examination-honour-roll |website=CPA Canada |publisher=CPA Canada |accessdate=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the honour roll members, a national Gold Medal (highest standing in Canada) is selected, along with 3 provincial gold medalists (top performers in their respective CPA representations). The CPA Governor General's Gold Medal (National Gold Medal) is awarded to 1 individual for a cash prize of $5,000. While each regional Gold Medalist receives a cash price of $2,500 each.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5822">A '''corporate university''' is any educational entity that is a strategic tool designed to assist its parent organization in achieving its goals by conducting activities that foster individual and organizational learning and knowledge.&lt;ref name="Allen"&gt;{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Mark|title=The Corporate University Handbook|publisher=AMACOM Div American Mgmt Assn|date=2002|pages=9|isbn=978-0-8144-0711-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corporate universities (CU) are a growing trend in [[corporation]]s. In 1993, corporate universities existed in only 400 companies. By 2001, this number had increased to 2,000, including [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney]], [[Boeing]], and [[Motorola]].&lt;ref name="Hearn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newfoundations.com/OrgTheory/Hearn721.html|title=Education in the Workplace: An Examination of Corporate University Models |last=Hearn|first=Denise R.|date=2002-05-10|accessdate=2009-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'corporate university' also refers to public universities which have developed, or have been forced by states to develop, corporate style behaviour&lt;ref&gt; Marginson and Considine, 2000, https://www.amazon.com/Enterprise-University-Governance-Reinvention-Australia/dp/052179448X/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1528155796&amp;sr=8-5&amp;keywords=simon+marginson&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In most cases, corporate universities are not [[University|universities]] in the strict sense of the word. The traditional university is an educational institution which grants both [[undergraduate]] and [[postgraduate]] degrees in a variety of subjects, as well as conducting original scientific research. In contrast, a corporate university typically limits scope to providing job-specific, indeed company-specific, training for the managerial personnel of the parent corporation. Corporate universities are most commonly found in the [[United States]], a nation which has no official legal definition of the term "university". Perhaps the best known corporate university is the [[Hamburger University]] operated by [[McDonald's Corporation]] in [[Chicago]].

==Typical goals of a corporate university==
Corporate universities are set up for a variety of reasons, but most organizations have the same basic needs. These are to:&lt;ref name="Hearn"/&gt;
*Bring a common culture, loyalty, and belonging to a company
*Get the most out of the investment in education
*Organize training
*Remain competitive in today's economy
*Retain employees 
*Start and support change in the organization

CUs offer valuable training and education to employees, but they also help organizations retain and promote key employees. Although a CU may sound attractive, there is a lot of work that goes into the planning and implementation of such a project.

==Curriculum==
[[J.P. Morgan]] and Co. is an example of a company with an organized curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dallas.bizjournals.com/dallas/stories/2003/07/28/focus2.html?page=1|title=Corporate university approach taking hold|last=Tanner|first=Lisa|date=2003-07-25|publisher=Dallas Business Journal|accessdate=2009-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have three different types of courses: Business specific courses, organizational learning and communication classes, and management and executive training. What your company decides to offer will depend on your needs (such as sales training, marketing, or soft skills) and your company's business (like manufacturing, consulting, or technology). 

Most CUs offer a blended curriculum of online and in person classes. Some organizations offer courses during the workday while other offer them at varying times. Courses can be short workshops or longer, more traditional courses. 

Unlike traditional universities, CUs demand a return on their investment. There must be concrete evidence that the classroom is delivering results. Many CUs provide hands-on and team learning as a more effective alternative to lecture-based courses, but all CUs agree that what is learned in the classroom should be directly applicable to the work environment.

==Implementation==
Although a CU may sound attractive, there is a lot of work that goes into the planning and implementation of such a project such as complex logistics, resource optimization and careful budgeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/training-roi-walmart-success-stéphane-pineau/|title=Training ROI- the Walmart success|last=Pineau|first=Stephane|date=2016-12-07|publisher=LinkedIn}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, corporate universities tend to be cost centers with dedicated training facilities servicing an often global workforce through a dedicated curriculum. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21651217-more-firms-have-set-up-their-own-corporate-universities-they-have-become-less-willing-pay|title=Keeping it on the company campus|date=2015-05-15|publisher=The Economist|accessdate=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; To manage this complexity, specific [[Enterprise resource planning]] systems have been developed for Corporate Universities, such as a [[Training management system]]. Other systems such as accounting systems and different types of [[Educational Technology| learning technologies]] can be used together.

'''Cyril Hubert Marie Bourlon de Rouvre''' is a [[France|French]] [[businessman]] and [[politician]], born 19 December 1945 at [[Boulogne-Billancourt]].

== Biography ==

=== Education and early career ===
Son of Évrard Bourlon de Rouvre, an industrialist, and his wife Claude Genty, Cyril Bourlon de Rouvre is the heir of sugar refineries and the landed property of his great-grandfather, Charles Bourlon de Rouvre (1850-1924), himself stepson of one of the richest men at the end of the 19th century, Gustave Lebaudy.

After studies at the ''collège Maspero'' in [[Paris]], then at the ''collège Saint-Martin de France'' in [[Pontoise]], the [[The Oratory School|Oratory School]] in [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], the ''Collège Saint-Jean'' in [[Fribourg]] and at the ''[[Lycée Janson-de-Sailly]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/cref-dercyr.html PEOPLE: CYRIL BOURLON DE ROUVRE]&lt;/ref&gt; Cyril Bourlon de Rouvre studied [[electrical engineering]] at ''[[Jussieu Campus|Jussieu]]'' before graduating as an [[aerospace engineer]] at the ''[[Institut polytechnique des sciences avancées]]''.

He first worked at ''[[Électricité de France]]'' before serving his [[conscription]] and started his career as a sales engineer at the Elliot Automation company (1966-1968) before being Director of export of the Sucre Union company (1971-1973). He was business manager of the sales support department of the Lara audiovisual company (1973), then commercial agent in the audiovisual (1974-1975) and associate director at the Auto Racing company (1977).

=== A young and dynamic business leader ===
In 1979, upon the death of his father (who was murdered by his valet), he inherited large real estate holdings, a sugar refinery and 28 companies. He became [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of ''Financière Robur et de Cofragec'' (1982-1992),&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.liberation.fr/france/0101180993-la-drole-de-faillite-de-cyril-de-rouvre-ancien-patron-de-ligier La drôle de faillite de Cyril de Rouvre, ancien patron de Ligier]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Coficine'' (1984-1992) and many other companies.

He modernized the sugar factory and his inheritance prospered, taking, in 1981, control of the holding Fraissinet, owner of the business airline Transair. In 1987, he started a new career in film distribution by acquiring, from the producer [[Robert Dorfmann]],&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.lexpress.fr/informations/les-millions-de-cyril_596731.html Les millions de Cyril]&lt;/ref&gt; by one of its companies, the ''Financière Robur'', Cofragec company with its catalog of 650 films including ''[[La Grande Vadrouille]]'' or ''[[La Vache et le Prisonnier]]''. He produced movies including ''[[The Bengali Night|La Nuit bengali]]'' (1988) of [[Nicolas Klotz]], ''Les Deux Fragonard'' (1989) of Philippe Le Guay, and ''[[La Peste]]'' (1992) of [[Luis Puenzo]]. He also invested in real estate, including a hotel in [[Tahiti]].

Passionate about cars and racing, he rallied with [[Thierry Sabine]], including Abidjan-Nice driving a [[Range Rover]].

=== Political life in Haute-Marne and investment in Formula 1 ===
In 1989, he started a political career in ''[[Haute-Marne]]'', a department where which his grandfather Charles de Rouvre was a deputy during the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]]. He was elected mayor of [[Chaumont, Haute-Marne|Chaumont]], as an independent (classified as [[miscellaneous right]]) against the centrist senator and mayor Georges Berchet, and regional councilor for the [[Champagne-Ardenne]] [[Region of France|region]] (1992-1998).

He takes his team, as an alderman, a man of 25 years, [[Luc Chatel]], becoming in fact the first « political godfather ».

Owner of the [[Formula 1|Formula 1 team]] [[Automobiles Gonfaronnaises Sportives|AGS]] from March 1989 to 1991, he swallowed $ 18 million and began selling activities of his group, about 70 companies: First Transair, then the sugar factory, sold to the ''Compagnie de Navigation Mixte'', and in 1992, the catalog of movies, lent to [[UGC (cinema operator)|UGC]] in the form of a merger. In 1991, he gives AGS the Italians Gabriele Rafanelli and Patrizio Cantu.

In 1992, Cyril de Rouvre bought the [[Formula 1|Formula 1 team]] [[Equipe Ligier|Ligier]] for an estimated price of 200 million of francs. With its new owner, the team started to again be competitive - the [[1993 Formula One season|1993 season]] was a success, with a 5th place in the constructor's championship (the team's best result since 1986). But the involvement of Cyril de Rouvre lasted only one season because of legal troubles.

=== The legal troubles and the decline ===
The 14 December 1993, the judge [[Eva Joly]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liberation.fr/economie/0101125375-cyril-de-rouvre Cyril de Rouvre]&lt;/ref&gt; incarcerated him at the [[Fleury-Mérogis Prison]], as part of a complaint for fraud filed by the leaders of UGC, Guy Verrecchia and Alain Sussfeld, following the takeover in June 1992 the company Cofragec. This company has been emptied of its assets, leaving a liability estimated at 172.6 million francs. Cyril de Rouvre had promised to repay this sum at the end of 1992 but at that time, he still had 100 million. On 5 May 1993, leaders of UGC have filed a complaint against him. He spent two months in prison.

In early 1994, he sold [[Equipe Ligier|Ligier]] to [[Flavio Briatore]].

He lost the mayoralty of Chaumont at the [[French municipal elections, 1995|French municipal elections of 1995]].

'''Direct Debit Dividend Contributions''' also known as '''3DC''' are payments made towards [[stockholder|shareholders]] for [[stock|shares]] which have been issued on credit.

Issuing stock on credit is considered appropriate when a [[Stakeholder (corporate)|Stakeholder]] (such as company's founder or other key person) wishes to retain involvement in a business but is unable to raise the capital required to pay for stock. In such circumstances the company's shareholders may agree to issue the desired level of stock against a plan where shares must be paid for through direct debit dividend contributions. '''3DC''' differs from [[Stock options]] in that the recipient is awarded shareholder status from the moment the 3DC arrangement is agreed.

'''3DC''' is often regarded as a reward for efforts achieved (usually for the groundwork required in setting up a new business). It also serves as an incentive to ensure future performance of the company's stock.

'''Dixon Place''' is a theater organization located in [[New York City]] dedicated to the development of works-in-progress from a broad range of performers and artists. It exists to serve the creative needs of artists—emerging, mid-career and established—who are creating new work in theater, dance, music, literature, puppetry, performance, [[variety show|variety]] and visual arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc-arts.org/organizations/31/dixon-place|title=Dixon Place|work=NYC-ARTS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many well-known artists, including [[Ivy Baldwin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americandance.org/performance/archived-performances/ivy-baldwin-dance/|title=Ivy Baldwin Dance  -  American Dance Institute|work=americandance.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Blue Man Group]], [[Laura Peterson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/LauraPetersonChoreography/info?tab=page_info|title=Laura Peterson Choreography|work=Facebook}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Monica Bill Barnes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://monicabillbarnes.com/events/events_past.html|title=Monica Bill Barnes + Company|work=monicabillbarnes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Leguizamo]], [[Lisa Kron]], [[David Cale]], [[Jane Comfort]], [[Risa Jaroslow]], [[Penny Arcade]], [[Katy Pyle]], [[Peggy Shaw]], [[Douglas Dunn]], [[Deb Margolin]] and
[[Reno]], began their careers at Dixon Place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mas.org/dixon-place-a-place-that-matters/|title=Dixon Place, A Place that Matters –  The Municipal Art Society of New York|work=mas.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dixon Place offers 14 shows a week, 7–8 commissions a year, and more than 20 different programs across artistic disciplines, featuring work by more than 1,500 emerging and established artists each year. All artists presenting work in Dixon Place’s main-stage programs receive compensation, from work-in-progress showings to artists-in-residence and commissioned artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dixonplace.org/about-us/mission/|title=mission/history|work=dixonplace.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Dixon Place was founded in 1985 by Artistic Director Ellie Covan. After starting Dixon Place as a salon in her Paris apartment in the summer of 1985, Covan re-launched the endeavor in her East Village living room the following year. Her apartment was half of a storefront; she set up folding chairs for audiences and sold drinks and snacks to defray her expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/09/theater/theater-dixon-place-a-real-home-for-theater-may-be-the-last-of-a-breed.html|title=THEATER -  Dixon Place, a Real Home for Theater, May Be the Last of a Breed - NYTimes.com|date=9 January 1994|work=nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After 5 years at the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] location, Dixon Place needed to expand. In order to accommodate a growing audience, Dixon Place moved to a larger space on the Bowery in 1991. The loft also served as living space for Covan.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/26/realestate/26HABI.html&lt;/ref&gt; Expanded programming, along with an increased staff and audience, prompted another move in 1999, when Dixon Place became the resident company at the Vineyard Theater’s 26th Street space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/nycs-dixon-place-moves-into-old-vineyard-theatre-82361|title=NYC's Dixon Place Moves Into Old Vineyard Theatre|work=Playbill}}&lt;/ref&gt; Success in this professional environment led to the decision to secure a permanent home. In 2002, in partnership with a dedicated Board and a forward-thinking developer, Dixon Place purchased an industrial space on Chrystie Street in Lower Manhattan. After a 6-year capital project, Dixon Place's state-of-the-art laboratory theater and lounge, featuring expanded amenities for artists and audiences and new earned income for Dixon Place, had its Grand Opening in December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/newyork/own-this-city-blog/new-venue-dixon-place-finally-gets-its-official-grand-opening|title=New venue: Dixon Place finally gets its official grand opening|work=Time Out New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facility==
In addition to a professional laboratory theater, the new space, designed by Meyer + Gifford Architects, includes numerous artist amenities The main-stage theater has column-free width for performance, as well as a sprung [[masonite]] floor, high ceilings, rigging points for aerial work, and state-of-the-art technical equipment. There is a separate rehearsal studio with a sprung [[marmoleum]] floor, and the spacious dressing room includes a private artist’s restroom and shower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studio-tl.com/projects_theatre/pt_dixonplace.html|title=Dixon Place - Studio T+L|work=studio-tl.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150121164157/http://www.studio-tl.com/projects_theatre/pt_dixonplace.html|archivedate=2015-01-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/02/arts/dance/02kour.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Dixon Place also includes a welcoming lounge. Set up as a for-profit subsidiary with a full liquor license, it is a new business model that subsidizes the theater's artistic programs. The lounge includes a gallery and a smaller stage that provides additional artistic outlets and day-time community space for educational programs and a meeting place for other organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizbash.com/dixon_place_opening_150-seat_theater_on_l_e_s/new-york/story/12432#.VL-_AtLF98E|title=Dixon Place Opening 150-Seat Theater on L.E.S.|author=Anna Sekula|date=10 September 2008|work=BizBash}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programming==

All of Dixon Place's programs have been developed out of a specific need that was not being met elsewhere.

===Commissions===

In 1994, Dixon Place began the Mondo Cane! Commissioning Program that supports 8 theater, dance and music creators annually by providing them with 1–3 months of workshop time, followed by 1–4 weeks of world premiere full-scale production performances. Mondo Cane! has offered commissions to such artists as [[The Civilians]], [[The Debate Society]] and [[Sibyl Kempson]]. In 2015, Dixon Place will present world premiere commissions by [[James Godwin]], [[Mark Dendy]], [[Marga Gomez]], [[Raja Feather Kelly]], [[Victor Morales (artist)|Victor Morales]], [[ANIMALS]], and [[Jessica Almasy]].

==Community Outreach (CECO)==
Begun in 2000, the Cultural Education &amp; Community Outreach Program (CECO) provides rare artistic opportunities for culturally under-served senior citizens and youth living in Lower Manhattan, at no cost to the participants. CECO has brought theater, writing, dance and film/video workshops to local youth in collaboration with such partners as [[Urban Arts Partnership]], [[New Design High School]], [[University Settlement]], [[Tompkins Square Middle School]] and [[The School for Global Leaders]]; and to senior citizens, collaborating with [[Services &amp; Advocacy for GLBT Elders (SAGE)]], [[Sirovich Senior Center]] and [[Bowery Residents Committee (BRC) Senior Center-Chinatown]]. With this program, Dixon Place has reached beyond the artist community to include the voices of low-to-moderate income young and elderly neighbors. The free workshops focus on performing, writing, movement, and music, culminating in public performances. This program enables the participants to experience artistic expression, discover their creative voices, develop their own theatrical works and perform in front of supportive audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIrktUOLkCU|title=CECO - 06/08/14|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7200">'''Engineer to order''' is a production approach characterized by:&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Wortmann|J.C. Wortmann]], Chapter: "A classification scheme for master production schedule", in Efficiency of Manufacturing Systems, C. Berg, D. French and B. Wilson (eds) New York, Plenum Press 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

#Engineering activities need to be added to product [[lead time]].
#Upon receipt of a customer order, the order engineering requirements and specifications are not known in detail.  There is a substantial amount of design and engineering analysis required.

To speed up delivery time, the adoption of [[concurrent engineering]], [[integrated product team]], and [[lean product development]] methodologies are used.  The critical path methodology is also essential.

Engineer to order environments must employ a flexible and adaptive, demand-driven approach to the manufacturing process. It is usually the right solution when details on a customer order are not provided and engineering development must be added to product lead time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leadtime.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

ETO is a technique that is leveraged to boost sales and improve margins for those companies with customers needing solutions that are tailored to fit their own unique environment. It begins with selling product concepts that don’t have fixed designs and are expected to result in a new, unique end product.  This could be any product, from enterprise software applications to special aircraft to a pair of jeans.  But the typical ETO environment usually deals with the design and build of unique custom engineered complex machinery and industrial equipment - one in which there is heavy involvement of the following engineering disciplines; mechanical, electrical, mechatronics, software, manufacturing and systems engineering.  The ETO company works with its customers to develop new products that satisfy the customer’s requirements and specifications.

==Engineer to order vs Made to Order==

The difference between the ETO approach to production and make to order products is that engineering original products to order includes the entire design process. In MTO companies typically have a fixed design and specifications to start with. The existing design is followed, even if the customer requests some customization of dimensions or materials.  In engineering to meet unique customer orders, designs spring from collaboration with the customer, beginning with a need and a concept. Engineers do not know the final specifications, materials, or in software development, even the network or application platform until other primary concepts are ironed out. This is a much more creative process and requires a much closer relationship with clients, ultimately leading to a product that is unique.

==Process Flow==

Engineers don’t always follow a smooth flow from step to step even in ordinary manufacturing. Most manufacturing design decisions tends to be highly iterative.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.instructionaldesign.org/models/iterative_design.html&lt;/ref&gt; It is common to create a design that meets customer approval, test it, make changes to meet specifications, and resubmit at certain stages or milestones in order for approval to proceed to the next stage.  Engineer to order, due to its nature, is even more complex and client-centric. This requires on-going documentation, but the approach typically involves all of the following steps.

* ''Sales'': A sales order is agreed upon between client and manufacturer. This will include quoted costs, delivery dates, and other basic information like a work breakdown structure (WBS) document. This is assigned to a project as an order item. Costing is usually based on actual costs related to past similar projects. This generally includes consideration of reworks and scrap.
* ''Scale out'': This involves fine tuning for further details, such as project team and management designations, departmental labor/fabrication, re-scheduling, anticipated resources, and release of the WBS to establish and coordinate project activities.
* ''Procurement'': A bill of materials (BOM) covering all elements is created and followed to satisfy initial requirements, as well as ownership of the end product. Work orders for each component are planned in sequence. Many customers will require lot tracking via product sheets; that is, the origin, specification, and batch number of every lot of materials used, in order to effect future reproduction or identify the source of material flaws or an unacceptable quality of finished components.
* ''Design begins'': Research and development begins work on product realization, usually followed by an advance payment before physical product designs begin. A direct link between CAD (computer aided design) and fabrication is made more effective by eliminating the need for ERP (enterprise resource planning) input as a control.
* ''Milestones'': Project milestones are established and applied to the order development to structure a client billing plan. A deposit or down payment is received to launch project development, but may be adjusted in final billing.
* ''Confirmation'': Receipt of payment and approval for go-ahead of lead-time components as each milestone is realized&lt;ref&gt;https://docs.infor.com/help_lawson_10.0/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.lawson.help.financials%2Fcom.lawson.help.brug-uwa_10.0.x%2FF_72512x3Ax20H2x3Ax20Whatx20isx20Milestonex20Billingx3F.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''MRP'' (material requirements planning): Planned orders for all required materials and elements are issued across the complete BOM.
* ''Assembly'': Preliminary assembly of components and confirmation of production approval. Typically another advance payment is made.
* ''Delivery'': Delivering of components and final assembly/installation, usually at client location.
* ''Trial period'': After the customer has tested and accepted the product, final payment and contract settlement are made.
* ''Review'': The manufacturer conducts analysis of cost, delivery progress, and revenue through documentation and reports related to the project.

==Quality==
Given the unique nature of the delivered product, clients may accept certain quality risks as a consequence of meeting delivery dates. Testing and trial periods may also be limited by the nature of the product, the manufacturing required, and the metrics established for quality controls.  As each product is essentially a one of a kind prototype, smaller companies on either the manufacturer or client side may not have the expertise or resources to implement use-cases, user testing, or future quality guidelines.  In MTO, quality is often defined as a lack of defects, but must meet minimal levels defined in the specifications. In Engineer to Order there is no original design. Where possible, prior similar products may provide some guidelines as to testing and precision, but the idea of re-designing or modifying an existing design is necessarily a core requirement of the engineer to order concept.  It does however reduce costs and time if one can use previous designs.

Banev became known for his [[imprisonment]] and multiple [[criminal prosecution]]s for alleged [[money laundering]] and [[drug trafficking]]along side mafia boss Pedro in several countries, including [[Bulgaria]] and [[Italy]].&lt;ref name="novinite.com"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Novinite|title=Italy’s Supreme Court Annuls 20-Year Prison Term of Alleged Drug Lord Evelin Banev|url=http://www.novinite.com/articles/170966/Italy%E2%80%99s+Supreme+Court+Annuls+20-Year+Prison+Term+of+Alleged+Drug+Lord+Evelin+Banev|accessdate=27 September 2015|agency=Sofia News Agency|publisher=novinite.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In July 2014, the [[Sofia]] Court of Appeal acquitted Banev of all criminal charges against him and overturned a {{frac|7|1|2}}-year sentence issued previously by the Sofia City Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=sofia appeals court overturns money laundering sentence on brendo|url=http://sofiaglobe.com/2014/07/11/sofia-appeals-court-overturns-money-laundering-sentence-on-brendo/|publisher=Sofia Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Митов|first=Борис|title=Брендо получи седем години и половина затвор за пране на пари от наркотрафик|url=http://www.mediapool.bg/brendo-poluchi-sedem-godini-i-polovina-zatvor-za-prane-na-pari-ot-narkotrafik-news202935.html|work=Mediapool.bg|publisher=Mediapool.bg|accessdate=19 May 2014}} ('''Bulgarian''')&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2015, Italy’s Supreme Court of Cassation annulled his 20-year prison term for drug trafficking and returned the case for retrial to the Appellate Court of Milan.&lt;ref name="novinite.com"/&gt; Banev's prosecutions, alleged criminal activities, and imprisonment have been highly controversial and [[politicized]]. During his imprisonment, Banev's 10-year-old daughter was abducted and freed after almost two months in captivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=KR|first1=Magazine|title=Abductors free daughter|url=http://www.krmagazine.com/2013/04/23/abductors-free-daughter-10-of-bulgaria-drug-lord/|website=krmagazine.com/|publisher=KR Magazine|accessdate=27 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Banev published his first book, "I Gaze Upon the Soul of Bulgaria", which he wrote during his time in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Брендо издаде книга за "любовта към живота", "родена в затвора"|url=http://www.mediapool.bg/brendo-izdade-kniga-za-lyubovta-kam-zhivota-rodena-v-zatvora-news231496.html|publisher=Mediapool.bg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Banev was born in [[Burgas]], Bulgaria.&lt;ref name=Kapital&gt;{{cite web|last=Vestnik|first=Kapital|title=Brendo|url=http://www.capital.bg/politika_i_ikonomika/bulgaria/2007/04/27/335049_brendo/|work=Brendo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1985, when he enrolled to the [[National Sports Academy]], Brendo has lived in [[Sofia]]. During his time at the Academy, Banev frequently travelled to international camps, tournaments and wrestling competitions representing his club "Academic - Sofia" and the Bulgarian National Wrestling Team. Banev has been awarded the "Master of Sport" title in Bulgaria and wrestled in the 74&amp;nbsp;kg category, under the instruction of [[Dimitar Dobrev]].&lt;ref name="24chasa.bg"&gt;{{cite news|last1=24|first1=Chasa|title=Брендо ходи без охрана, рядко говори по GSM|url=http://www.24chasa.bg/Article.asp?ArticleId=2338358|accessdate=27 September 2015|agency=24 chasa|publisher=24chasa.bg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Entrepreneurship ==
After the 1989 political changes in Eastern Europe, Banev spent most of his time outside of Bulgaria. During that time, Banev accumulated his fortune during the [[Dot-com bubble]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who is Evelin Banev|url=http://www.dnevnik.bg/bulgaria/2013/03/05/2015611_koi_e_evelin_banev-brendo/|website=dnevnik.bg|publisher=dnevnik.bg}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hristova|first1=Violina|title=Брендо на свобода, останалите 9-има "Кокаинови крале" зад решетките|url=http://www.24chasa.bg/Article.asp?ArticleId=5001291|accessdate=27 September 2015|agency=24 chasa}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also a real estate investor and entrepreneur involved in multiple projects in Bulgaria's riviera and capital.&lt;ref name="24chasa.bg"/&gt;

== Criminal prosecutions ==
In April 2007, the Sofia City [[Prosecutor]] indicted Banev for organizing a criminal group and [[money laundering]]. Subsequently, Banev was arrested and released on bail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brendo Released on Bail|url=http://dariknews.bg/view_article.php?article_id=197952|work=Darik News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Banev's case caused a media stir again in 2008, when [[Switzerland]] agreed to lift its [[bank secrecy]] and to submit bank documentation to the Bulgarian authorities. Later, it was made public, that in its requests for judicial assistance to Switzerland, the Bulgarian [[Prosecutors Office|Prosecutor's Office]] has sent false information – i.e. stating that Banev is accused of [[drug trafficking]] and distribution rather than of [[money laundering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Switzerland Lifts the Bank Secret|url=http://dnes.dir.bg/temite/news/sad-brendo-3728629?tag_id=45223|work=Dnes Dir BG}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of May 2012, Banev's case was still pending with [[court hearing]]s being postponed at the request of the prosecution. In relation to the case, various Bulgarian media and [[EU commission]] reports commented on the groundless accusations and the [[abuse of power]] by the prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Case Against Brendo Losing Ground|url=http://www.capital.bg/politika_i_ikonomika/bulgaria/2007/06/22/352099_i_deloto_sreshtu_brendo_izduhva/|work=Capital BG}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At this time, the Bulgarian authorities initiated operation "Cocaine Kings" with an overwhelming media coverage, including a press conference with the Italian authorities. During the operation, some 30 people were arrested, including Banev. Banev was accused of allegedly financing drug trafficking between South America and Europe, and Italy claimed responsibility for criminally charging him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Арестувани са 30 "кокаинови крале"|url=http://www.novini.bg/news/67847-%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D1%83%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8-%D1%81%D0%B0-30-%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8-%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B5-(%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B0).html|publisher=Novini.bg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following operation "Cocaine Kings", Italy requested a temporary extradition of Banev, which he and his legal team fought. However, the Bulgarian Court of Appeals confirmed Banev's 1-year extradition to Italy on July 17, 2012, with the condition that he will be returned to Bulgaria when needed for his money laundering trial. The extradition hearing was not without controversy, as the court denied Banev's right to appoint a new defense attorney and rejected the request of the publicly appointed attorney for more time to familiarize herself with the case. Banev was extradited to Italy on July 26, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Court Did Not Give Time to Banev's Defense and Confirmed His Extradition|url=http://legalworld.bg/show.php?storyid=27355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, Sofia City Court sentenced Banev to 7 1/2 years in prison, while acquitting the other 3 people accused with him.  Banev’s lawyer, Ina Lulcheva, said that the appeal against the finding of the Sofia City Court would be based on a lack of evidence justifying the conviction. That the group had travelled together made them at most a tour group, not an organised crime group, she said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sofia court jails Brendo| url= http://sofiaglobe.com/2013/02/15/sofia-court-jails-brendo-orders-him-to-pay-21m-leva-in-compensation-for-laundering-money-from-illegal-drug-deals/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The defense further stated:

:"I will not comment on the length of the sentence. The defense pleaded that there is no crime, as such the punishment is not significant. In this case, it is indicative that it was established that there is money laundered from a person, who has never even been questioned or interrogated. We have not asked that he is questioned, because there is no evidence that he has any connections with the defendants; the prosecution did not want his questioning, because in my opinion, they knew that their accusation would not be confirmed. As such, the court accepted that money is laundered from the activity of a person and his group, without even questioning this person".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Media|first1=Pool|title=Брендо получи...|url=http://www.mediapool.bg/brendo-poluchi-sedem-godini-i-polovina-zatvor-za-prane-na-pari-ot-narkotrafik-news202935.html|publisher=mediapool.bg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a 4-month trial, in July 2013, the Milan City Court sentenced Banev to 20 years in prison for participating in a criminal organization for international drug trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Италия прати Брендо за 20 години в затвора|url=http://www.monitor.bg/article?id=391595|publisher=monitor.bg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Banev's defense attorney stated that, "Banev has not even entered Italy" and that there is not one evidence linking him to the charges.  Before the court, his attorney pointed out that all of the Milan prosecutor evidence was coming from Bulgaria, not from Italy - in Italy, Banev was never [[Surveillance|under surveillance]], [[wiretap]]ped, followed, or investigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Брендо дори не е влизал в Италия|url=http://www.monitor.bg/article?id=387977|publisher=monitor.bg}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian judge who sentenced Banev, stated in an interview with a prominent Bulgarian newspaper that he highly recommends that Banev appeals the sentencing because "until now not a single evidence of Banev's guilt has been deposited; Banev has never been caught in the act of crime, and he was sentenced only by the testimonies (which were presumed truthful) of other defendants".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Monitor|first1=BG|title=Брендо може да е в България през август|url=http://www.monitor.bg/article?id=391717|publisher=monitor.bg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the trial, Banev was extradited to Bulgaria, where in July 2014, the Sofia Court of Appeal ruled him "not guilty" of money laundering and released him on probation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Standrart|first1=News|title=Брендо невинен за пране на париКопирано от standartnews.com|url=http://www.standartnews.com/balgariya-pravosudie/brendo_nevinen_za_prane_na_pari-245793.html|publisher=StandartNews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 22, 2015, Italy’s Supreme Court of Cassation annulled Banev's 20-year prison term for alleged drug trafficking and ordered a retrial to the Appellate Court of Milan.  Italy's Supreme Court of Cassation upheld the sentences of all other people convicted under the "Cocaine Kings" affair.&lt;ref name="novinite.com"/&gt;  The court cited that Banev's unjust conviction was due to lack of any evidence and irregularities in the use of facts.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In annulling his 20-year conviction, the court reported that Banev's [[net worth]] and [[political neutrality]] had led to "antagonisms that motivated incorrect assessment of [his] personality".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== Counter-allegations ==
Banev said that he was invited in writing to a meeting with the Interior Minister, Rumen Petkov, who requested Brendo’s assistance – i.e. to [[False testimony|falsely testify]] against “the Margin” brothers. According to Banev, his refusal to cooperate with the Minister is the main reason behind the 2007 charges for [[money laundering]] against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rumen Petkov Pressured Brendo to False Testify|url=http://www.vesti.bg/?oid=1240076&amp;tid=40|work=Vesti BG}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rumen Petkov Wanted Brendo to Lie|url=http://frognews.bg/news_8349/R_Petkov_iskal_Brendo_da_lajesvidetelstva_sreshtu_Marginite/|work=Frog News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kidnapping of Banev's daughter==
Banev's ten-year-old daughter, Lara, was kidnapped by three masked men at about 7:30&amp;nbsp;am on March 5, 2013, while leaving her home in Sofia. The men shot her unarmed driver twice in the back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Неизвестни отвлякоха дъщерята на Евелин Банев-Брендо|url=http://dariknews.bg/view_article.php?article_id=1049974}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first kidnapping in Bulgaria since 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Световни медии...|url=http://www.24chasa.bg/Article.asp?ArticleId=1819650|publisher=24 часа}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motives behind the kidnapping were the cause for much speculation. In a televised press conference three days later, Chief Prosecutor Sotir Tsatsarov stated that, "The kidnapping of Lara is a message to Brendo".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lara's Kidnapping a Message for Brendo|url=http://www.trud.bg/Article.asp?ArticleId=1824467|publisher=Trud}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This leads to the other suspicion - the key politicians of [[Boyko Borisov]]'s cabinet in resignation - Prime Minister Borisov himself, Minister of Interior [[Tzvetan Tzvetanov]], and the Chief of the [http://www.mvr.bg/en/AboutUs/StructuralUnits/National+MoI+Services/GDBOP/default.htm Chief Directorate "Combating Organized Crime"], [[Stanimir Florov]]. As stated by Aleksey Petrov, "If Brendo talks about [[Boyko Borisov|Borisov]], [[Tzvetan Tzvetanov|Tzvetanov]], and [[Stanimir Florov|Florov]], it will be frightening".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=If Brendo Talks...|url=http://dnes.dir.bg/news/tzvetan-tzvetanov-alexey-petrov-kokainoviat-kral-brendo-13281737|newspaper=dir.bg}}&lt;/ref&gt; The media states that the failing [[GERB]] party, via its two main figures, Borisov and Tzvetanov, is trying to keep the power and to win the elections at any cost - using a brutal kidnapping as a sign that "without them organized crime is coming back" while sending a signal to Banev to keep quiet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Лара е залог за Цветанов|url=http://www.dennews.bg/news/2013/3/21/12383-aleksei-petrov-lara-e-zalog-za-cvetanov|publisher=днес.бг}}&lt;/ref&gt; This message was clearly given by Tzvetanov himself during a TV interview in which he avoided the question "Where is Lara?" several times and finally answered, "What happened is unpleasant, but let's not forget who her father is".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=отвличането на лара...|url=http://btvnews.bg/article/kriminalno/otvlichaneto-na-lara-veroyatno-e-svarzano-s-deloto-na-bashta-i-v-italiya.html|newspaper=bnews.bg}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tzvetanov complained that crime increased since he is gone|url=http://www.segabg.com/article.php?id=639698|publisher=СЕГА}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Опасни Връзки|url=http://www.pik.bg/emanuil-jordanov-tsvetanov-se-izkazva-kato-shef-na-rpu-slava-bogu-otiva-si|publisher=афера.бг}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kiro, Florov, Tzvetanov stoiat zad otvlichaneto na Lara|url=http://www.sigurnostta.com/Razni/flor.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Let's recall that her father is a great figure in the underworld and is considered untouchable.

Lara Baneva was released, physically unharmed, on April 21, 2013; she was left in front of a police station in Sofia at approximately 10:00&amp;nbsp;pm. It was reported, but unconfirmed, that the kidnappers had originally demanded a €10&amp;nbsp;million ransom, but later agreed to free her in exchange of €530,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Искали 10 млн. евро за Лара, но взели 530 хил. евро|url=http://www.dnes.bg/crime/2013/04/22/iskali-10-mln-evro-za-lara-no-vzeli-530-hil-evro.186261|newspaper=dnes.bg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Published Books==
In March 2015, Evelin Banev published a [[novel]] titled [http://www.helikon.bg/books/114/-%D0%A1%D1%8A%D0%B7%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BC-%D0%B4%D1%83%D1%88%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B0-%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D0%91%D1%8A%D0%BB%D0%B3%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%8F_192167.html "I gaze upon the soul of Bulgaria"] ([[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian:]] ''Съзирам Душата на България''), which he wrote while in prison.  The [[Spirituality|spiritual novel]] is about the journey to [[self-discovery]] and realization as passed on by the main character, Max, after a 20-year imprisonment, to his daughter Anna.  Banev is also the artist of the book cover - an illustration of two [[mandala]]s.&lt;ref name="frognews.bg"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4921">[[File:Fay automatic lathe.jpg|frame|right|Fay automatic lathe&lt;ref name="ASME1921"&gt;{{Harvnb|ASME|1921}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The '''Fay automatic lathe''' was an [[automatic lathe]] tailored to cutting workpieces that were mounted on [[Lathe center|centers]] (tools with pointed ends to accurately position a [[Drill bit#Center and spotting drill bits|center-drilled]] workpiece about an axis, either directly or by using a [[mandrel]]). It could also do chucking work&lt;ref name="Roe1937p42"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roe|1937|p=42}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (feeding of unformed blanks or pieces of stock from a magazine to be automatically gripped by the machine for turning). Examples of workpieces included automotive steering knuckles&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Flanders|1921}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and transmission gears,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Flanders|1922}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and such work done on mandrels as flanges, disks, and hubs. The machine tool was developed by F.C. Fay of [[Philadelphia]] and improved by Otto A. Schaum.&lt;ref name="Roe1937p42"/&gt; It was originally manufactured by the '''Fay &amp; Scott Machine Shop'''. [[James Hartness]] acquired manufacturing rights on behalf of  the '''Jones &amp; Lamson Machine Company'''&lt;ref name="ASME1921"&gt;{{Harvnb|ASME|1921}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roe1937p42"/&gt; and manufactured an improved version, developed under the management of [[Ralph Flanders]].&lt;ref name="Roe1937p42"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Flanders|1913}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937 Roe, writing for the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]], framed the importance of the Fay automatic lathe to the capabilities of machine tools by saying that, "This machine does for the engine lathe what [[Christopher Miner Spencer|Spencer]] did for the old hand-operated [[Turret lathe#Automatic turret lathes|turret lathe]]."&lt;ref name="Roe1937p42"/&gt; These machines took an entire class of turned work formerly requiring an operator to execute the series of movements necessary to shape a piece of metal (manual control) and allowed the same work to be done automatically. This step forward in [[automation]] lowered a manufacturer's [[Unit cost|unit]] expense per part by reducing labor costs.&lt;ref name="ASME1921"&gt;{{Harvnb|ASME|1921}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, [[Numerical control|numerically controlled (CNC) machine tools]] such as turning centers, turn-mills, and [[rotary transfer machine]]s have largely supplanted cam-operated automatics.

'''George Alexis Weymouth''' (June 2, 1936 – April 24, 2016), better known as '''Frolic Weymouth''', was an [[United States|American]] artist, whip or stager, and [[conservation movement|conservationist]]. He served on the [[United States Commission of Fine Arts]] in the 1970s and was a member of the  [[Du Pont family]].

==Family and personal life==

His mother, Dulcinea "Deo" Ophelia Payne du Pont (November 28, 1909 – February 8, 1981), was the eldest of Eugene Eleuthere du Pont's (August 27, 1882-December 15, 1954) four daughters. Frolic was six generations removed from [[Éleuthère Irénée du Pont]], the founder of the [[DuPont]] corporation. In 1930, Dulcinea married investment banker George T. Weymouth (December 14, 1904-June 7, 1990).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&amp;dat=19810209&amp;id=tvIcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3GcEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6981,4566495 |title=Area Obituaries: Deo DuPont Weymouth |work=[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]] |date=February 9, 1981 |accessdate=January 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weymouth was christened George Alexis Weymouth. According to a well-known story, shortly after George's birth, his 3-year-old brother, Gene, lost his foxhound. After repeatedly asking his mother, "Where’s Frolic?" his exasperated mother replied, "Shut up! Here’s your damn Frolic!" and thrust George before Gene.

Weymouth graduated from [[St. Mark's School (Massachusetts)|St. Mark's School]] in Southborough, Massachusetts in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stmarksschool.org/news-page/item/index.aspx?LinkId=2695&amp;ModuleId=424 |title=George A.

F. Pirro |work=Mainline Today |date=April 22, 2009 |accessdate=January 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weymouth suffered from [[dyslexia]], but he believed that being from a prominent family enabled him to graduate from Yale. "I couldn't read and write or spell. I still can't. I don't know anything but painting pictures and being on a horse," he said in 2007.&lt;ref name="philly" /&gt;

"It’s no big deal" being a du Pont, he once said. In 2000, 3,700 members of the Du Pont family attended a reunion at [[Longwood Gardens]]. Several years later Weymouth wondered aloud, "How many there are now? Du Ponts have always been busy in bed."&lt;ref name="mainline" /&gt;

Weymouth was married to [[Anna Brelsford McCoy]] for 18 years until their divorce in 1979. He has one son, Mac, whom he adopted.&lt;ref name="mainline" /&gt;

He resided in a converted 17th-century Swedish trading post with an 18th-century addition on {{convert|250|acre|m2}} called "[[Twaddell's Mill and House|Big Bend]]" (a translation of an Indian name for the land) in [[Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania]], that he purchased in 1961. According to Weymouth, [[William Penn]] originally purchased the land from the Native American [[Lenape]] tribe in 1683.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.philly.com/1992-12-03/news/25992132_1_turtles-greatest-artist-brandywine-river-museum | title=The 18th Century Lives At This Home Big Bend Is Home To A Man And A Theme|work=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]  |author=Joseph S. Kennedy|date=December 3, 1992|accessdate=January 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Big Bend was the Lenape's original term for the land, which lies along the [[Brandywine Creek (Christina River)|Brandywine Creek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/13/garden/18th-century-echoes-in-a-stone-house.html |title=18th Century Echoes in a Stone House|work=[[The New York Times]]  |author=Leslie Bennetts |date=September 13, 1984|accessdate=January 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weymouth died on April 24, 2016 at his home in Chadds Ford from complications of congestive heart failure at the age of 79, according to Andrew Stewart, a spokesman for the conservancy and museum.&lt;ref name="obit2" /&gt;

==Artist==

Weymouth’s early work, done in [[Tempera|egg tempera]], was often highly personal. His portrait of his grandfather, Eugene du Pont, Jr., features the detail of a herringbone suit coat and the worn fabric of a favorite recliner. His ''The Way Back'' (1963) is a self-portrait of only his hands guiding a single horse carriage up the lane to Big Bend.

Weymouth painted portraits of [[Luciano Pavarotti]] (1982) and of [[Prince Philip]], [[Duke of Edinburgh]] (1995), [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth]]’s husband, a work which hangs in [[Windsor Castle]]. Weymouth was selected by [[NASA]] to paint at Cape Canaveral during the moon shots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=George A. Weymouth|url=http://art.state.gov/ArtistDetail.aspx?id=163896|website=Art in Embassies|publisher=U.S. Department of State}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through his circle of fellow artists, Weymouth became a close friend and relation of artist [[Andrew Wyeth]]. He was married to artist [[Anna Brelsford McCoy]], Andrew Wyeth’s niece. They divorced in 1979. [[Jamie Wyeth]], Andrew Wyeth’s son, married Weymouth’s cousin Phyllis.&lt;ref name="mainline" /&gt;

Weymouth was the confidant who discreetly hid Andrew Wyeth’s nudes of Prussian-born neighbor and caretaker [[Helga Testorf]] for 17 years before they became public. In the 2004 documentary, ''The Way Back: A Portrait of George A. Weymouth'', Andrew Wyeth said he didn't "know of anyone who means as much to me."

He helped found the [[Brandywine River Museum]], which presents the work of Andrew Wyeth, [[N.C. Wyeth]], Jamie Wyeth, other Wyeth family members (including those such as [[Peter Hurd]] related by marriage) and selections from the canon of American art.  Weymouth served on the Visual Arts Panel of the Pennsylvania Council of the Arts and received many awards, including the Cliveden Heritage Preservation Award and the [[University of Delaware]] Merit Award for Community Service.  Weymouth was a member of the [[U.S. Commission of Fine Arts]] from 1972 to 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas E. Luebke, ed., ''Civic Art:  A Centennial History of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts''  (Washington, D.C.: 2013):  Appendix B, p. 557.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a conversation about [[Andy Warhol]], Jamie Wyeth expressed the opinion that Frolic Weymouth was the "real character."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phillymag.com/articles/wyeths_world/page9&lt;/ref&gt;

Weymouth surrounded himself with art and gardens. A centerpiece in Weymouth’s Big Bend is "The Vidette," an enormous painting of a horseman in the snow dating from 1912. This N.C. Wyeth work is occasionally on loan for exhibitions. [[Anna Hyatt Huntington]]’s "Greyhounds Playing" graces the garden. Elsewhere, a carved wooden Indonesian fertility bench features two interlocked monkeys, highlighting Weymouth’s admitted fascination with fornication.{{citation needed|date = October 2015}}

==Conservationist==
[[File:Carriage parade at Winterthur Point ot Point.jpg|thumb|right|Frolic Weymouth driving his coach at the head of [[Winterthur Museum and Country Estate|Winterthur]]’s Point-to-Point carriage parade.]]

In the mid-1960s, Weymouth convinced friends F.I. du Pont and William Prickett to help him buy two parcels in Chadds Ford, along the banks of the [[Brandywine Creek (Christina River)|Brandywine Creek]] which had been proposed for industrial development. This purchase led to the founding of the Tri-County Conservancy, now known as the Brandywine Conservancy &amp; Museum of Art, an environmental, arts, and cultural preservation organization that subsequently led to the founding of such organizations all over the country. Frolic was the chairman of the board of the Brandywine Conservancy from that point on until his death.&lt;ref name="mainline" /&gt; The organization has permanently protected from development more than 62,000 acres in southeastern Pennsylvania and northern Delaware.

In 1969, Weymouth donated his property to the Brandywine Conservancy as its first conservation easement. His home, "The Big Bend," surrounded by Brandywine Creek on three sides, is just inside Pennsylvania at the northern Delaware border. The period-furnished 1750s stone house addition to the original 1650s Swedish log cabin is surrounded by gardens. His donation was followed by those of the [[Harry G. Haskell, Jr.]], Ford B. Draper, and Jamie Wyeth. The four easements protected almost {{convert|340|acre|km2}} and 5{{fraction|1|2}} miles along the Brandywine Creek.

In 1984, the King Ranch in Pennsylvania went to market. Rumored buyers included a [[nuclear power plant]], [[Disney]], and a real estate developer. Weymouth organized a conservation team to purchase the {{convert|5,380|acre|m2|adj=pre|contiguous}} for $11.5 million. The land is now conserved and includes the {{convert|775|acre|km2|adj=on}} Laurels Preserve.

In 1967, a mill along the Brandywine went up for auction. Through miscommunication, Weymouth and the Conservancy acquired it. The [[Brandywine River Museum]] opened in the building in 1971 after the mill was renovated, including the addition of soaring, glass-walled lobbies on three floors.

==Whip or stager==
Weymouth was a whip, the owner and driver of a coach. He acquired a collection of antique coaches and carriages and used them regularly. He had deeded rights-of-way on neighboring properties to be able to drive his four-in-hand around northern Delaware. His passengers through the years included [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Michael Jackson]].&lt;ref name="philly" /&gt;

He initiated and led the coaching event at the [[Winterthur Museum]]'s Point-to-Point in Delaware. He permanently retired a trophy at the [[Devon Horse Show]] in Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.countylinesmagazine.com/article.aspx?aid=474 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100512044435/http://www.countylinesmagazine.com/article.aspx?aid=474 |archivedate=2010-05-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1985, he spent three months in England and managed to drive a carriage {{convert|1000|mi|km}}. He whipped another {{convert|1000|mi|km}} in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vasportsman.com/Coaching_in_Newport.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717185328/http://www.vasportsman.com/Coaching_in_Newport.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He once drove from [[New York City]]'s Upper East Side to [[Saratoga Springs, New York]], and then on to [[Shelburne, Vermont]]. Carriages are not uncommon around [[Central Park]] but taking the carriage through [[Harlem]] caused a sensation.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2005/1010/324sidebar.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George Gordon Burnes''' (11 July 1866 – 9 February 1949) was a businessman and [[first-class cricket]]er in [[New Zealand]].

==Personal life and business career==
The son of Adam Burnes, who was the first general manager of the [[National Bank of New Zealand]], George had five brothers and a sister.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Evening Post (New Zealand)|Evening Post]]'', 20 May 1914, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[AMP Limited|the Australian Mutual Provident Society]]'s district manager in [[Invercargill]], and then served as manager in [[Christchurch]] for 13 years until his retirement in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Press]]'', 30 March 1935, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; He and his wife Anna had one child, a daughter who died in her teens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=George Gordon Burnes |url=http://www.burness.ca/g0/p119.htm#i1190 |website=Burness Genealogy and Family History |accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cricket career==
Burnes played six first-class matches for [[Wellington cricket team|Wellington]] between 1884 and 1887. His highest score was 32, when he top-scored against [[Auckland cricket team|Auckland]] in his last first-class match in 1887.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/3/3184.html| title = Auckland v Wellington 1886-87| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 27 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After moving to [[Invercargill]] he was one of the founders of the Southland Cricket Association in 1892.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Southland Times|Southland Times]]'', 18 November 1892, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; He captained the [[Southland cricket team|Southland]] representative team in the 1890s. In Southland's first representative match after the formation of the association, he top-scored with 34 against [[Otago cricket team|Otago]].&lt;ref&gt;''Southland Times'', 22 February 1894, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The match against Otago remained an annual event until the 1980s. In 1895-96 Burnes captained Southland to their first victory in the series.&lt;ref&gt;''Southland Times'', 21 February 1896, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Against the [[Australia cricket team|Australian touring team]] in 1896-97, his innings of 18 was the only double-figure score made by any of the Southland XXII.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/131/131807.html | title = Southland v Australians 1896-97| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 27 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still the captain, he also top-scored with 47 for a Southland XIII against [[Queensland cricket team|Queensland]] two months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/109/109263.html| title = Southland v Queensland 1896-97| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 27 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was selected to tour Australia with the [[New Zealand cricket team in Australia in 1898–99|New Zealand team in 1898-99]] but was unable to make the trip.&lt;ref&gt;[[Don Neely]] &amp; Richard Payne, ''Men in White: The History of New Zealand International Cricket, 1894–1985'', Moa, Auckland, 1986, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Margaretta Large Fitler Murphy "Happy" Rockefeller''' (June 9, 1926&amp;nbsp;– May 19, 2015) was a [[philanthropist]] and the second wife of the 49th [[Governor of New York]] and 41st [[Vice President of the United States]], [[Nelson Rockefeller|Nelson Aldrich Rockefeller]] (1908&amp;ndash;1979). She was [[First Lady]] of New York from her marriage to then-Governor Rockefeller in 1963 until he left office in 1973, and [[Second Lady of the United States]] during her husband's tenure as Vice President from December 19, 1974 until his term ended on January 20, 1977.

==Childhood and family==
Margaretta Large Fitler was born at [[Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania]], in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1928&amp;dat=19740906&amp;id=YpMgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=lmcFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=968,679585 ''The Lewiston Daily Sun'' - Google News Archive Search&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes /&gt; Her parents were Margaretta Large Harrison and  William Wonderly Fitler Jr., an heir to a [[Rope|cordage]] fortune. (Later her mother would marry again.) The younger Margaretta was known by her [[nickname]], "Happy", given to her for her childhood disposition. She was a great-granddaughter of [[Philadelphia]] mayor [[Edwin Henry Fitler]] and a great-great-granddaughter of Union general [[George Gordon Meade]], the commander at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://rivertonhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/138_Gaslight_News_Nov09.pdf#page=5 |page=5 |title=Fascinating Fitlers among the movers and shakers since Riverton's early days |journal=Gaslight News |publisher=Historical Society of Riverton |date=November 2009 |volume=XXXIX |number=4 |first=Gerald |last=Weaber |access-date=October 9, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and his wife Margaretta Sergeant, daughter of politician [[John Sergeant (politician)|John Sergeant]].

==Marriages==
On December 11, 1949, she married James Slater Murphy, a [[virologist]] associated with the [[Rockefeller University|Rockefeller Institute]] and a close friend of [[Nelson Rockefeller]]'s. They had four children: James B. Murphy, II, Margaretta Harrison Murphy, Carol Slater Murphy, and Malinda Fitler Murphy (1960–2005). Malinda married [[Francis Menotti]], the adopted son of composer [[Gian Carlo Menotti]].

Happy and her husband divorced on April 1, 1963, for reasons ''The New York Times'' called "grievous mental anguish" and her former husband's lawyer classified as "irreconcilable differences".  One month later&amp;nbsp;– on May 4, 1963&amp;nbsp;– at the home of [[Laurance S. Rockefeller]] in [[Pocantico Hills, New York]], Happy married Governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]], who had taken office in 1959 and was eighteen years her senior. She had worked as a member of his office staff until her resignation in 1961. Nelson divorced his first wife, [[Mary Rockefeller|Mary Todhunter Clark]], on March 16, 1962. Happy and Nelson Rockefeller had two sons together: Nelson Rockefeller, Jr. (born 1964), and [[Mark Rockefeller]] (born 1967).

At the time, Happy Murphy's relationship with Gov. Rockefeller was controversial. As the British journalist Lady Jeanne Campbell wrote in the London ''[[Evening Standard]]'', when the Murphy-Rockefeller involvement became a subject of media scrutiny after the announcement of Rockefeller's filing for divorce from his first wife and Happy Murphy's resignation from his staff, "Already people are comparing Happy Murphy to the Duchess of Windsor when she was plain [[Wallis Simpson|Mrs. Simpson]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Nan C. Robertson]], "Nickname 'Happy' Well-Fitted to Cheerful Mrs. Rockefeller", ''The New York Times,'' 5 May 1963, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; More damaging still was the political fallout for Rockefeller. Echoing the party-wide concerns, an official of the Michigan Republican Party told ''The New York Times'' that the couple's potential marriage likely would cost Rockefeller the 1964 presidential nomination. "The rapidity of it all&amp;mdash;he gets a divorce, she gets a divorce&amp;mdash;and the indication of the break-up of two homes. Our country doesn't like broken homes."&lt;ref&gt;"Many in G.O.P. Say Marriage Will Hurt Rockefeller in 1964", ''The New York Times,'' 3 May 1963, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite some people's disapproval, Rockefeller was re-elected as governor twice more and served until 1973, when he resigned. He was appointed Vice President of the United States by President [[Gerald Ford]], after [[Richard Nixon]] resigned, and served from 1974 to 1977.

There has been speculation surrounding Malinda Fitler Murphy, the youngest daughter of Happy Rockefeller and Dr. James Slater Murphy, with many in the Rockefeller inner circle believing her to be Nelson Rockefeller's daughter.  In his diary, Rockefeller intimate Ken Riland used a tone of knowing irony when mentioning Malinda, putting the word stepfather in quotes. Ellen, the wife of Wally Harrison, the architect and Nelson Rockefeller confidant, claimed that Malinda's parentage was an open secret among Rockefeller associates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/On_His_Own_Terms.html?id=yjuOAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=kp_read_button#v=snippet&amp;q=divorced&amp;f=false|title=On His Own Terms: A Life of Nelson Rockefeller|last=Smith|first=Richard Norton|date=21 October 2014|publisher=Random House|isbn=9780812996876|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy and political life==
Happy Rockefeller served as the chairman of the board for the [[Saratoga Performing Arts Center]] in 1971. She was appointed as a public delegate to the [[United Nations]] by President [[George H. W. Bush]] in 1991.

==Health and death==
She was a [[breast cancer]] survivor, having undergone a double [[mastectomy]] in 1974, two weeks after [[Betty Ford]], then [[First Lady of the United States]], underwent a single mastectomy.&lt;ref&gt;"Breast Cancer: Fears and Facts", ''Time'' magazine, 4 November 1974&lt;/ref&gt; Happy Rockefeller died following a short illness on May 19, 2015, at the age of 88.&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/20/nyregion/happy-rockefeller-whose-marriage-to-governor-scandalized-voters-dies-at-88.html?ref=obituaries&amp;_r=0 Happy Rockefeller, Whose Marriage to Governor Scandalized Voters, Dies at 88]&lt;/ref&gt;

The former [[Lekan Salami Stadium|Adamasingba Sports Complex]] is named after him.&lt;ref name=Adesokan&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Adesokan |first=Akin |date= |title=Ibadan, Soutin and the Puzzle of Bower's Towe |url=http://www.africancitiesreader.org.za/reader/chapters/07_AA.pdf |magazine=African Cities Reader 1 |location=Cape Town |publisher=African Centre for Cities and Chimurenga Magazine |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Salami was born in [[Ibadan]] to the family of Salami and Oyebimpe Oyetunde, his father was a younger brother to the late [[Olubadan]] Shittu Akintola Oyetunde. The family's compound was in the Eleta neighborhood of Ibadan, hence he was given the moniker Salami Eleta when he was young.{{sfn|Sanni|2005|p=6}} He started learning by taking Quranic lessons at the age of three and when he was seven, he started attending an Islamic School. He later attended Ibadan Boys High School and [[Lisabi Grammar School]], Abeokuta.{{sfn|Sanni|2005|p=7}}

===First republic politics===
In 1950, Salami was secretary of the Ibadan Cooperative Produce Marketing Union a role that involved the grading and payment for produce brought in by cooperative members. After his stint with the cooperatice, he later worked with [[United Africa Company|UAC]]. During the pre-independence period, Salami joined the Mabolaje Alliance of [[Adegoke Adelabu]]. In 1954, he won election as a councilor to the Ibadan District Council under the banner of [[National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons|NCNC]]{{sfn|Sanni|2005|p=13}} and in 1956, he went on to win an election into the Western House of Assembly, defeating the incumbent, [[Augustus Akinloye|Akinloye]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Adesina |first=Lam |subject-link=Lam Adesina |interviewer= Wale Akinola &amp; Sina Babasola|title=Obasanjo's Camp Infiltrated By Fake Supporters- Lam Adesina |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200303100222.html |publisher=Vanguard |location=Lagos |date=March 9, 2003 |work= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of Adelabu in 1958, a crisis within the Ibadan NCNC branch led to the exit of Salami from NCNC. Thereafter, he aligned with [[Action Group (Nigeria)|Action Group]] and was a member of [[Akintola]]'s faction.{{sfn|Sanni|2005|p=25}} He was elected back into the Ibadan District Council in 1961 and was later appointed as executive director, Western Nigeria Development Corporation. After the military coup of [[1966 Nigerian coup d'état|January 15, 1966]], Salami was placed in detention for five months{{sfn|Sanni|2005|p=27}} before he was freed by soldiers during the [[1966 Nigerian counter-coup|counter-coup of July 1966]].

===relationship with Shooting Stars===
Salami had been a fan of many amateur local football clubs since 1937 when the first amateur team in Ibadan, Hercules club was founded. In the 1950s, he was a member of the Ibadan District Football Association, an organization that managed Ibadan Lions football club. During his time with the group, he was a team manager of the lions and later president of the association. His appointment to the Western Nigeria Sports Council led to his resignation from the association due to potential conflict of interest. But while in the association, he joined a group of young members such as J.O.

''' Lewis Ludington ''' (June 25, 1786 – September 10, 1857) was an [[American businessman]], [[lumber baron]], and [[real estate developer]]. He operated general merchandising stores in New York and Milwaukee and is the founder of [[Columbus, Wisconsin]]. Among his businesses were lumber mills and docks.

== Early life ==
Ludington's father, [[Henry Ludington]], was a soldier in the [[French and Indian War]]. Records show that when twenty-one years old, he assisted a company of wounded soldiers from Quebec to Boston in the winter of 1759–60, and after that duty returned to civilian life. Henry married his cousin Abigail on May 1, 1760, a week before her fifteenth birthday. They had six children, all born in [[Kent, New York]] (then known as Fredericksburgh). Lewis was youngest, born on June 25, 1786.{{sfn|Johnson|1907|pp=35–45}} His eldest sister was [[Sybil Ludington]].

== Mid life and career ==
Ludington was twenty when he partnered with his elder brother Frederick to operate a general merchandising store near their home in [[Kent, New York]].&lt;ref name=FirstShow&gt; {{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= The First Show  |url= https://www.newspapers.com/clip/10327014/ |work=Green Bay Advocate |page=1 |location= Green Bay, Wisconsin|date= August 25, 1881 |via=[[newspapers.com]] {{open access}} }} &lt;/ref&gt; He visited Milwaukee in 1838 with his nephew [[Harrison Ludington]] and Harvey Birchard of Carmel, New York. They explored the interior of Wisconsin with the idea of purchasing extensive tracts of land from the government for timber. In 1839 the brothers formed a general merchandising store in Milwaukee called Ludington, Burchard &amp; Company. A year or so later Burchard retired and the firm became Ludington and Company with Harrison's younger brother Nelson being brought into the partnership. Ludington was the general manager of the company for nearly twenty years. It had a more wide-ranging business compared to other companies in Wisconsin at the time; among its holdings and activities were docks in Milwaukee and lumber mills in [[Oconto, Wisconsin|Oconto]] as part of the firm.{{sfn|Bruce|1922|p=121}}{{sfn|Fuller|1941|p=411}}{{sfn|Johnson|1907|pp=218–225}}

Ludington also became involved in real estate development in Wisconsin. His connections there were extensive, and he would travel to the state on the [[schooner]] ''Lewis Ludington'', which he used to transport harvested lumber across [[Lake Michigan]] from Wisconsin and ultimately back to New York state by train and wagon.{{sfn|Johnson|1907|pages=224–226}}

== Columbus, Wisconsin ==
{{main|Columbus, Wisconsin}}

Ludington acquired a section of land in [[Columbia County, Wisconsin|Columbus County]], [[Wisconsin Territory]] sometime in 1838.{{sfn|Fuller|1941|p=411}} He sold a portion of it to Elbert Dickason in 1839 on a [[land contract]].{{sfn|Butterfield|1880|p=665}} Dickason built a cabin on this land acreage on the west side of [[Crawfish River]] and dammed up the river for a sawmill site. He became the first settler to locate in this area, when he brought with him a herd of cattle, some horses, and a few wagons of supplies with hired men. The first winter Dickason spent at this site was severe, as most of his live stock died and he almost ran out of food. In spite of his bad luck, he persisted for the next four years, struggling to complete his log cabin and sawmill operation. He spent nearly ten thousand dollars doing so. However, he was unable to make enough money from the sawmill to meet his payments to Ludington and lost all his rights to the property. Ludington took back the property for the back payments and a $200 buy-out.{{sfn|Jones|2016|p=228}} 

There was one other log cabin constructed on this property by Hiram Allen in 1843 not far from the sawmill. Jeremiah Drake became the local real estate agent managing the property in Wisconsin for Ludington, whose home was in New York state.{{sfn|Butterfield|1880|p=666}} Drake built the first frame house on the property in the early part of 1844. Other settlers that arrived were James Shackley, S. W. St. John, T. Baldwin, H. W. McCafferty, H. A. Whitney, Jacob Smith, James T. Lewis, J. C. Axtell, D. E. Bassett, J. E. Arnold, Warren Loomis, W. C. Spencer, Jesse Rowell, E. Thayer, and W. M. Clark.{{sfn|Jones|2016|pp=228–229}} 

In July 1844, Ludington designed a community layout for this land that became the basic city plan of [[Columbus, Wisconsin]].{{sfn|Johnson|1907|p=224}} Ludington's Plat was the first official evidence of the existence of the city of Columbus. {{sfn|Jones|2016|pp=234–235}} Lewis recorded in [[Brown County, Wisconsin]], on November 11, 1844, Ludington's Plat containing Blocks 1 to 9.{{sfn|Butterfield|1880|p=669}} The school within Ludington's Plat was built in 1846. Columbia  County was formed in 1847 from Brown County. There was a Ludington's Addition of Blocks 10 to 13 recorded in Columbia County on August 6, 1849. Ludington made a second addition to the original Ludington's Plat, and it was recorded in the Recorder's office in Portage on October 3, 1850.{{sfn|Butterfield|1880|p=669-673}}  He deeded some of this land to the [[Congregationalists]] later in 1850 and they built a church on it.{{sfn|Jones|2016|p=235}} By the next year they also built a Methodist church and a Universalist church.{{sfn|Butterfield|1880|p=669-673}} 

Ludington, with his son [[James Ludington|James]], helped pioneers to settle and develop the new city of Columbus. They assisted H. W. McCafferty in 1855 in building the Columbus Exchange Hotel that was located in downtown Columbus at the corner of James Street and Ludington Street.{{sfn|Butterfield|1880|p=669}} They also helped businessmen A. P. Birdsey, Isaac Robinson, R. Thomas, J. Colville, Franklin F. Fowler and B.F. Hart establish firms in the city.{{sfn|Butterfield|1880|p=669}} The plat of West Columbus was recorded in the Recorder's office in  Volume 10 of Deeds (pages 107 and 208) on June 10, 1854.{{sfn|Butterfield|1880|p=669-673}} Lewis' First Addition to West Columbus was recorded in Volume 17 of Deeds (page 324) on August 8, 1856.{{sfn|Butterfield|1880|p=669-673}} Ludington himself never resided in the state of Wisconsin, despite his many contributions to the state.{{sfn|The Commission|1994|p=38}}{{sfn|Beers|1905|p=125}}

== Family ==
Ludington married Mary (Polly) Townsend in September, 1812.{{sfn|Downs|1934|p=180}} Their children were Laura, Delia, William, Robert, Charles, Henry, James, Lavinia, Emily, and Amelia.{{sfn|Beers|1905|p=125}}

== Death ==
Ludington, while a resident of [[Carmel, New York]], died while on a temporary stay at [[Keshena, Wisconsin]].&lt;ref name=obit1&gt; {{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Obituary |url= https://www.newspapers.com/clip/10327270/ |work=The Daily Milwaukee News |page=2 |location= Milwaukee, Wisconsin |date= September 13, 1857 |via=[[newspapers.com]] {{open access}} }} &lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Conard|1895|p=322}} He was 71 years old, dying on September 10, 1857.&lt;ref name=obit2&gt; {{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Hudson River Items |url= https://www.newspapers.com/clip/10327366/ |work=[[Brooklyn Eagle|The Brooklyn Daily Eagle]] |page=2 |location= Brooklyn, New York |date=September 15, 1857 |via= [[newspapers.com]] {{open access}}}} &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6863">'''Likert’s management systems'''&lt;ref&gt;Modaff, D.P., Butler, J.A., DeWine, S. (2008). Organizational Communication: Foundations, Challenges, and Misunderstandings (Third Edition). Glenview: Pearson Education, 59–62&lt;/ref&gt; are management styles developed by [[Rensis Likert]] in the 1960s. He outlined four systems of management to describe the relationship, involvement, and roles of managers and subordinates in industrial settings. He based the systems on studies of highly productive supervisors and their team members of an American Insurance Company. Later, he and Jane G. Likert revised the systems to apply to educational settings. They initially intended to spell out the roles of principals, students, and teachers; eventually others such as superintendents, administrators, and parents were included.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, J. W. (1972). A Comparison of Halpin and Croft's Organizational Climates and Likert and Likert's Organizational Systems. Administrative Science Quarterly, 17(4), 586–590.&lt;/ref&gt; The management systems, established by Likert, include "Exploitative Authoritative (System I), Benevolent Authoritative (System II), Consultative (System III), and Participative (System IV)."

==Management systems==

===Exploitative authoritative (I)===
In the exploitative authoritative system, leaders have a low concern for people and use methods such as threats and other fear-based methods to get their workers to conform. As a result of these methods, employees immediately have excellent performance upon entering the organization.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Mousavi, S. H. (2011). "The relationship between coaches' leadership styles with the athletes' sex and age". ''International Journal of Academic Research in Business and Social Sciences''. '''1''': 337–341.&lt;/ref&gt; Often times negative feelings are to follow once they settle in.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Communication is entirely downwards and psychological concerns of people are ignored. Lateral interaction or teamwork between subordinates lacks in this system based on managerial interactions.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Morris, T., &amp; Pavett, C. (1992). Management Style and Productivity in Two Cultures. ''Journal of International Business Studies,'' ''23''(1), 169-179. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.jstor.org/stable/154889&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Employees are expected to exceed their specified work hours creating negative work environments in organizations. Upper management forces a large work load on employees, however wages, monetary benefits and work satisfaction do not accompany the work. Workers are often found highly demotivated due to exploitation by management. Management does not trust employees, therefore they are not part of decision making processes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Benevolent authoritative (II)===
The benevolent authoritative system uses less control over employees than the exploitative authoritative system, however, this system motivates employees through potential punishment and rewards. Lower-level employees are more involved in the decision making processes, but are still limited by upper management. Employees in this system are involved in policy-making and group problem solving. Major policy decisions are left to those at the top, who have awareness of the problems that occur at both upper and lower levels throughout the organization. This results in mostly downward communication from supervisors to employees.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Little upward communication occurs, causing subordinates to be somewhat suspicious of communication coming from the top. The upper management tends to control the way employees can communicate to others and how they make decisions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This contrast in feelings toward responsibility can result in conflict, which can create negative attitudes within the organization. Subordinates in this system can become hostile towards each other because of the competition that is created between them. Satisfaction among workers is low to moderately-low and productivity is measured at fair to good.

===Consultative system (III)===
The consultative system is very closely related to the [[Human relations movement|human-relations theory]]. Subordinates gain motivation through rewards, occasional punishments, and little involvement in making decisions and setting goals. When compared to the first two systems, employees have more freedom to communicate and make company decisions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Lower-level employees have the freedom to make specific decisions that will affect their work. Upper-management still has control over policies and general decisions that affect an organization. Managers talk to their subordinates about problems and action plans before they set organizational goals. Communication in this system flows both downward and upward, though upward is more limited. This promotes a more positive effect on employee relationships and allows for more cooperation. As a result, upper-level managers make company decisions with consideration for input from subordinates.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Lower-level employees are seen as consultants to previous decisions and are more willing to accept change because of their involvement in major decisions. Satisfaction in this system improves from benevolent authoritative as does productivity.

===Participative system (IV)===
The participative system promotes genuine participation in decision-making and goal setting in order to promote a workplace where all members equally share information. Likert argues that the participative system is the most effective form of management within the systems. This system also coincides with [[Human resource development|human-resources theory]] based on the level of lateral interaction between employees and managers. Managers recognize problems that occur when there is little cohesiveness between members of an organization. Free-flowing lateral communication and the use of creativity and skills allows workers to become more involved within the organization.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Organizational goals are accepted universally in this system because all individuals are actively involved in their creation. All employees have a high level of responsibility and accountability for these goals. Managers motivate employees through a system that produces monetary awards, participation in goal setting, and trust from management.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Management also encourages employees to get involved outside of their occupational role and create relationships with employees of all levels in the organization.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Commonly managers are more open minded and creative in comparison to systems I-III.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The participative system creates identification with the organization, satisfaction, and higher production among employees when compared to the previous three systems.

*[[Hudson's Bay Company]] from the [[fur trade]] to [[retail]]
*[[ITT Corporation]] from [[telecommunications]] to [[engineering]] and [[manufacturing]]
*[[Nintendo]] from [[playing cards]] to [[Video game|video games]]
*[[Nokia]] from paper and cardboard products, to rubber tires, industrial rubber parts, raincoat and footwear to [[mobile telephone]] manufacturing

==Personal life==

His son Joseph married jewelry designer and socialite [[Sabine Ghanem]] at the same Basilica in May 2015. Getty and Harding divorced in 2011.

In 2015, Getty was awarded an honorary knighthood ([[Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire|KBE]]) for services to arts and philanthropy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mark Getty awarded honorary knighthood|url=https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/about-us/press-and-media/press-releases/mark-getty-awarded-honorary-knighthood|website=National Gallery|accessdate=15 April 2017|location=London|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''MetLife Inc. v. Financial Stability Oversight Council''''' is a 2016 case that challenged the [[systemically important financial institution]] rules in [[Dodd-Frank]]. U.S. District Judge  Rosemary Collyer ruled that MetLife could shed its Sifi designation, after concluding FSOC's designation was "arbitrary and capricious". FSOC subsequently launched an appeal but decided to drop the case in January 2018.

The '''open-core model''' is a [[business model]] for the [[monetization]] of commercially-produced [[open-source software]]. Coined by Andrew Lampitt in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Phipps|first1=Simon|title=Open Source Strategies for the Enterprise|date=July 2012|publisher=O'Reilly Media|isbn=978-1-4493-4117-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; the open-core model primarily involves offering a "core" or [[crippleware|feature-limited]] version of a software product as [[free and open-source software]], while offering "commercial" versions or add-ons as [[proprietary software]].&lt;ref name="Riehle"&gt;{{cite conference

==Controversy==
The concept of open-core software has proven to be controversial, as many developers do not consider the business model to be true open-source software. Despite this, open-core models are used by a large number of open-source software companies.&lt;ref name=li-opencore&gt;{{cite web|title=Open Core Debate: The Battle for a Business Model|url=http://www.linuxinsider.com/story/66807.html|publisher=Linux Insider|accessdate=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of contributor license agreements==
Some open-core products require their contributors to sign a [[contributor license agreement]], which either dictates that the copyright of all contributions to the product [[Work for hire|become the property of its owner]], or that the product's owner is given an unlimited, non-exclusive license to use the contributions, but the authors retain copyright ownership. In an open-core scenario, these agreements are typically meant to allow the commercial owner of the product (which in some cases, is ultimately the copyright holder to all of its code, regardless of its original author) to simultaneously market versions of the product under open-source and non-free licenses. This is in contrast with more traditional uses of CLAs, which are meant solely to allow the steward of an open-source project to defend its copyright, or guarantee that the code will only ever be made available under open-source terms, thus protecting it from becoming open core.&lt;ref name=infoworld-mysqlmistake&gt;{{cite web|title=MySQL mistake is a wake-up call on open source ownership|url=http://www.javaworld.com/article/2078812/open-source-tools/mysql-mistake-is-a-wake-up-call-on-open-source-ownership.html|website=InfoWorld|accessdate=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ev.kde.org/announcements/2008-08-22-fsfe-welcomes-fla.php | date = 2008-08-22 | title = FSFE welcomes KDE's adoption of the Fiduciary Licence Agreement (FLA)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/html_node/Copyright-Papers.html | title = 6.1 Copyright Papers | accessdate = 2011-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Paint Research Association''' is a research institute, formerly in south-west London, and now in [[Leicestershire]]. It is now known as the '''PRA'''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tTs5-WSNM6AC&amp;pg=PA469 New Scientist November 1978]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
It was established as the [[Research Association of British Paint, Colour and Varnish Manufacturers]] in 1926; in 1971 it changed its name to the Paint Research Association. Historically, the main paint manufacturer in the UK has been [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]], under the trade name of ''[[Dulux]]''.

Its first main research institute building opened in 1936. In 2005 it moved to the Coatings Technology Centre. In 2015 it moved to Leicestershire.

==Function==
It carried out research for the government and for industry. It claims to be a '''world authority''' on [[paint]] and surface coatings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4544">A '''qualified institutional buyer''' ('''QIB'''), in United States law and finance, is a purchaser of [[securities]] that is deemed financially sophisticated and is legally recognized by securities market regulators to need less protection from issuers than most public investors.  Typically, the qualifications for this designation are based on an investor's total [[assets under management]] and specific legal conditions in the country where the fund is located. [[Rule 144A]] requires an institution to manage at least $100 million in securities from issuers not affiliated with the institution to be considered a QIB. If the institution is a bank or savings and loans thrift they must have a net worth of at least $25 million. If the institution is a registered dealer acting for its own account it must in the aggregate own and invest on a discretionary basis at least $10 million of securities of issuers not affiliated with the dealer.

Certain [[private placements]] of [[stock|stocks]] and [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] are made available only to qualified institutional buyers to limit regulatory restrictions and public filing requirements.

== Requirements ==
The [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) requires that an entity meet one of the following requirements to qualify as a QIB:
* Any of the following entities, acting for its own account or the accounts of other QIBs, that in the aggregate owns and invests on a discretionary basis at least $100 million in securities of issuers that are not affiliated with the entity:
:* An insurance company
:* An investment company registered under the [[Investment Company Act of 1940]]
:* A Small Business Investment Company licensed by the US Small Business Administration under the [[Small Business Investment Act of 1958]]
:* A plan established and maintained by a state, its political subdivisions, or state agency, for the benefit of its employees
:* An employee benefit plan falling under the [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974]]
:* A trust fund whose trustee is a bank or trust company and whose participants are exclusively plans established for the benefit of state employees or employee benefit plans, except trust funds that include as participants individual retirement accounts or H.R. 10 plans
:*     A business development company as defined in section 202(a)(22) of the [[Investment Advisers Act of 1940]].
:*     A 501(c)(3) charitable organization, corporation (other than a bank or a savings and loan association), partnership, or Massachusetts or similar business trust; and
:*     An investment adviser registered under the [[Investment Advisers Act of 1940]].
* Any registered dealer, acting for its own account or the accounts of other QIBs, that in the aggregate owns and invests on a discretionary basis at least $10 million of securities of issuers that are not affiliated with the dealer.
* Any registered dealer acting in a [[riskless principal]] transaction on behalf of a ''qualified institutional buyer''.
* Any investment company registered under the Investment Company Act, acting for its own account or for the accounts of other QIBs, that is part of a family of investment companies which own in the aggregate at least $100 million in securities of issuers, other than issuers that are affiliated with the investment company or are part of such family of investment companies.
* Any entity, all of the equity owners of which are QIBs, acting for its own account or the accounts of other QIBs.
* Any bank or any savings and loan association or other institution, acting for its own account or the accounts of other QIBs, that in the aggregate owns and invests on a discretionary basis at least $100 million in securities of issuers that are not affiliated with it and that has an audited net worth of at least $25 million as demonstrated in its latest annual financial statements, as of a date not more than 16 months preceding the date of sale under [[Rule 144A]] in the case of a US bank or savings and loan association, and not more than 18 months preceding the date of sale for a foreign bank or savings and loan association or equivalent institution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://us.practicallaw.com/1-382-3730 PLC - Qualified Institutional Buyer (QIB)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:ClassCanalStreetNewOrleans.jpg|thumb|240px|According to the spatial mismatch theory, opportunities for low-income people are located far away from where they live.]]'''Spatial mismatch''' is the mismatch between where low-income households reside and suitable job opportunities. In its original formulation (see below) and in subsequent research, it has mostly been understood as a phenomenon affecting African-Americans, as a result of [[Racial segregation in the United States|residential segregation]], [[economic restructuring]], and the suburbanization of employment.

Spatial mismatch was first proposed by [[John F. Kain]] in a seminal 1968 article, "Housing Segregation, Negro Employment, and Metropolitan Decentralization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=John F. |last=Kain |title=Housing Segregation, Negro Employment, and Metropolitan Decentralization |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |year=1968 |volume=82 |issue=2 |pages=175–197 |doi=10.2307/1885893 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That article did not specifically use the term "spatial mismatch", and Kain disclaimed credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=John F. |last=Kain |title=A pioneer's perspective on the spatial mismatch literature |journal=[[Urban Studies (journal)|Urban Studies]] |year=2004 |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=7–32 |doi=10.1080/0042098032000155669}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1987, [[William Julius Wilson]] was an important exponent, elaborating the role of economic restructuring, as well as the departure of the black middle-class, in the development of a ghetto underclass in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilson |first=William Julius |title=The Truly Disadvantaged: The Inner City, the Underclass, and Public Policy |year=1987 |location=Chicago |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-90130-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Ingram Park Mall1.JPG|thumb|240px|Suburban shopping malls took employment out of the inner city.]]
After [[World War I]], many wealthy Americans started decentralizing out of the cities and into the suburbs. During the second half of the 20th century, [[department store]]s followed the trend of moving into the suburbs. In 1968, Kain formulated the “Spatial Mismatch Hypothesis”, but he did not refer to it by this term. His hypothesis was that black workers reside in segregated zones that are distant and poorly connected to major centers of growth. The phenomenon has many implications for inner-city residents dependent on low-level entry jobs. For example, distance from work centers can lead to increasing unemployment rates and further dampen poverty outcomes for the region at large.

==Factors==
In 2007, Laurent Gobillon, Harris Selod, and Yves Zenou suggested that there are seven different factors that support the spatial mismatch phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gobillon |first=Laurent |last2=Selod |first2=Harris |last3=Zenou |first3=Yves |year=2007 |title=The Mechanisms of Spatial Mismatch |journal=Urban Studies |volume=44 |issue=12 |pages=2401–2427 |doi=10.1080/00420980701540937 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Four factors are attributed to potential workers accessibility and initiatives. The remaining three factors stress employers' reluctance to divert away from the negative stigma of city people and in particular minorities when hiring.
	
===Potential workers perspectives===
[[Image:Pruitt-igoeUSGS02.jpg|thumb|240px|Urban redevelopment projects such as [[Pruitt–Igoe]] in St. Louis concentrated and separated workers from their surroundings and work. Such projects created a ghettoized underclass in America.]]
*Commuting cost is seen as an obstacle for inner city people to be present for job interviews and furthermore to arrive to work everyday on time. In other words, cars may be too expensive for some workers and they may have to rely heavily on public transportation. Public transportation is problematic in a sense that it is not always prompt and may not stop at all job location sites.
*Information access to jobs decreases as distance increases away from the job center. People who are living away from the job center are generally less knowledgeable about potential openings than individuals who live closer to the job center. Therefore, networking and [[knowledge spillover|information spillovers]] are of a major advantage in accessing information about potential openings.
*There seems to be a lack of incentive for distance workers to search intensively for a job that is relatively far away. Gobillion, Selod and Zenou believe that minorities, more or less, do a tradeoff between short term loss and long term benefits. The short term loss involves making frequent search trips to distant work centers. However, the long term benefit involves obtaining a stable job and thus a higher wage rate. Unfortunately, minorities tend to weigh the short term loss higher than the long term benefits and as a result decreases their opportunity at obtaining a job in the suburbs.
*There also seems to be a high search cost involve for urban workers looking for a job in the suburbs. It might be associated with paying a job agency to expand their search beyond the urban residential area or locating an agency in the suburbs.

==China==
Growth of [[List of under-occupied developments in China|ghost cities in China]], mostly from not yet agglomerated areas between or adjacent metropolitan areas or coal mining towns, as in the case of the most famous example, [[Kangbashi New Area]] of [[Ordos (city)|Ordos]], are an example of spatial mismatch.  In the case of places near metropolitan areas, it represents less of a risk going forward than in mining areas.

There are a number of additions to the ''Tropico 5'' game mechanics from the previous iteration of the series, notably the ability to advance to a new era if certain requirements are met; such as having written the constitution of Tropico. Tropico 5 includes 4 different eras, starting from Colonial Era, World Wars, Cold Wars and progressing up to Modern Times which allows progress from the 19th to the 21st century.&lt;ref name="cinemablend"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/games/Tropico-5-Rule-Your-Island-200-Years-58332.html|publisher=cinemablend.com|title=Tropico 5: Rule Your Island For 200 Years - CINEMABLEND|accessdate=29 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another gameplay mechanic is 'El Presidente' now has a dynastic family which will be present on the island.&lt;ref name=EuroGamerAnnouncement/&gt;&lt;ref name="rockpapershotgun"/&gt; The trading, research, renovation and exploration features have also been overhauled.&lt;ref name=EuroGamerAnnouncement/&gt; With multiplayer, diplomacy allows the players to share resources, construction workers, and electricity.

According to series producer Bisser Dyankov, Tropico 5 is designed to be much denser than its predecessors. The citizens are the lifeblood of the island to grow the island empire and for the sustainable growth, the players need to make them happy. Due to the needs of the 10 different in-game factions, one man's happiness may be another man's frustration. And their allegiances may change depending on the sort of government you run or the buildings you build. Due to the constitutional changes, some of the faction happiness may drop or rise depending on their allegiance to their factions.&lt;ref name="gamespot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/your-best-laid-plans-won-t-work-in-tropico-5/1100-6417767/|publisher=gamespot.com|title=Your Best-Laid Plans Won&amp;#039;t Work in Tropico 5 - GameSpot|accessdate=29 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Campaign===
''Tropico 5'', in the base game, comes with 15 missions, split into two parts. In both parts, you advance through all of the four eras, completing various objectives with one final objective for each mission.

In the first part of the game, Tropico must declare independence from the Crown, a spin on the [[British Empire]]. The player is also introduced to the campaign's primary antagonist, Leon Kane, the leader of The Order. Once the island has gained its independence (and thus ending the Colonial Era), the player, represented by "El Presidente" and his dynasty, must win three bets against the US President to befriend him; at the same time, a real estate tax must be paid continuously to the Crown. In the next mission, the island must build and maintain a large army in order to fend off a pending invasion. Once the invasion is defeated, the player must accrue a large sum in their Swiss Bank Account in order to purchase Switzerland and get "Dr. Zweistein" onto the island. This leads onto a demonstration of the tourism mechanic, in which the player is tasked with paying fees to The Order while, at the same time, trying to get enough tourists onto the island. Once that is accomplished, the player must build a Nuclear Program building to avoid World War III. Then, the island must produce and export Uranium for The Order, while at the same time, stopping the protests and increasing strikes from destroying the economy. At the end of this mission, Kane's plan is revealed: he wants to use the uranium to build enough nuclear missiles and launch an attack on the entire world, killing most of the population. The player must then generate enough research points to build a time machine (thanks to Zweistein from earlier) and travel back in time, thus beginning part two and averting the nuclear war.

In the second part, Tropico must produce and export gold to the Pirate King in order to free the King's son, for the Crown, all while dealing with constant pirate attacks. The next mission has the player exporting food to the King. After this, the island must amass a fortune high enough to become the richest country in the Caribbean. Once this has been done, the second military-themed mission has the player building a large army, not to defend, but to invade the island of ''Cayo de Fortuna''. The location of Kane is discovered, before he has the opportunity to start a nuclear war, and the player must complete a variety of tasks that help to assassinate him. After this has been completed, Tropico must export resources in order to dissolve the USSR, and then bring all the modern superpowers together and dealing with constant military threats to end the campaign.

===Sandbox===
In the game's sandbox mode, the player has a choice between choosing a pre-generated island provided by the developers or from the [[Steam Workshop]], or they may generate a new, random island with a variety of options. Once their island has been created, they work through all the ages, receiving small and large tasks alike to help them advance through the ages and build a stable island. Each of the eras are endless, and may be progressed to whenever the player would like, by completing each of the three main tasks that are given at the end of the first three eras.

As leader, players can decide their country's independence and write a full [[constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pcgamer.com/previews/tropico-5-first-look-guide-a-baby-dictatorship-from-the-colonial-era-to-the-modern-age/ | title=Tropico 5 first look: guide a baby dictatorship from the colonial era to the modern age | publisher=[[Future plc]] | work=[[PC Gamer]] | date=22 October 2013 | accessdate=1 June 2014 | author=Senior, Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing and release==
''Tropico 5'' was made available for pre-purchase on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] on 17 April 2014.

The game was banned in [[Thailand]] by the [[National Council for Peace and Order]]. The country's [[military junta]] government said that the game's storyline "might affect peace and order in the country." The game's distributor in Thailand, New Era Thailand, explained that "In the fifth installment, the storyline has developed further and there might be some part of it that's not appropriate in the current situation [in Thailand]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/222522/Tropico_5_banned_in_Thailand_as_it_might_affect_peace_and_order.php|title=Tropico 5 banned in Thailand, as it 'might affect peace and order'|last=Rose|first=Mike|date=4 August 2014|work=[[Gamasutra]]|publisher=[[UBM plc]]|accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game's ''Complete Edition'', which includes all the released [[downloadable content]] and expansion packs (''Espionage'' and ''Waterborne''), was released digitally on 29 January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/tropico-5-pc-complete-collection-revealed/1100-6433760/|title=Tropico 5 PC Complete Collection Revealed|first=Eddie|last=Makuch|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=13 January 2016|accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game forumers discovered that the vanilla games have the working models inside the game which are later sold and "unlocked" in the DLC.

The '''United Kingdom Standard Industrial Classification of Economic Activities''', or '''UKSIC''', is a [[Industry classification|Standard Industrial Classification]] that is intended to help classify businesses according to the type of their economic activity. One or more SIC codes can be attributed to a business. SIC codes identify what a business does.

Over time there have been several different SIC systems used in the UK, with versions published in 1958, 1968, 1980, 1992, 1997, 2003 and 2007. These taxonomies have been adapted to cope with the changes in UK industry, The 1980 system was far more detailed in manufacturing, while the 2007 system is much stronger in the IT sector. Many companies still use the 2003 codes which were the 1992 system updated slightly. However, the very latest version is the 2007 SIC system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uksiccodes.com |title=Business Data &amp; Data Enhancing/Appending |publisher=Uksiccodes.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/about/sic2007.shtml |title=SIC codes 2007 - Principal Business Activities |publisher=Companieshouse.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
A Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) was first introduced into the [[United Kingdom]] in 1948 for use in classifying business establishments and other statistical units by the type of economic activity in which they are engaged. The classification provides a framework for the collection, tabulation, presentation and analysis of [[data]] and its use promotes uniformity. In addition, it can be used for administration purposes and by non-government bodies as a convenient way of classifying industrial activities into a common structure.

==Current 2007 SIC codes==
These now fall in line with the [[European Union]] industrial classification system, [[Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community|NACE]], and the [[United Nations]] International Standard Industrial Classifications, [[International Standard Industrial Classification|ISIC]], to and including the 4 digit class level. For certain classes in the UK SIC 2007 taxonomy a further breakdown to a 5 digit level is available. They have been revised mostly to cater for the greater importance of [[Tertiary sector of the economy|service activities]] over the last fifteen years, due to developments in technology, such as [[information technology]] and  [[information and communications technology]].

The '''Victory Yard''' was a temporary expansion of the [[General Dynamics Electric Boat]] facility in [[Groton, Connecticut]] to dramatically increase submarine construction during [[World War II]].

==Early property ownership==
On 5 February 1942, the US Navy purchased the former [[Groton Iron Works]] property from Alfred Holter and [[Shell Oil Company]] for $222,000 using condemnation proceedings.&lt;ref name="US Navy"/&gt; $9.5 million was spent to construct the '''Victory Yard''', where [[General Dynamics Electric Boat]] began building submarines on 22 July 1942.&lt;ref name="EB"/&gt; On 3 November 1943 a Federal Court Committee awarded an additional $203,000 to the former owners.&lt;ref name="Federal Court"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6436">'''Vytex Natural Rubber Latex''' (NRL) is a brand of [[natural rubber]] [[latex]] produced and marketed by Vystar Corporation.  Vytex NRL is an alternative material to [[plastic|petroleum-based synthetics]] and traditional, or [[Hevea]], natural rubber latex.  Protein test results show that Vytex NRL typically has 90% fewer [[antibody generator|antigenic proteins]] than Hevea natural rubber latex.&lt;ref name="vytex.com"&gt;Vystar Corporation.  (2009).  Vytex NRL Frequently Asked Questions.  Retrieved February 9, 2009, from http://www.vytex.com/faq.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Physical properties of Vytex include barrier protection, [[natural rubber#Elasticity|elasticity]], tactile sensitivity, strength, comfort and fit.  Vytex comes in two grades:  Vytex high ammonia (Vytex HA) for surgical, exam and rubber gloves, catheters and balloons, and Vytex low ammonia (Vytex LA) for adhesive and foam applications. 

In May 2009 the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] granted [[510(k)]] clearance to market and sell a [[condom#Natural_latex|condom]] made with Vytex that contains less than 2&amp;nbsp;[[μg]]/[[decimetre|dm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]] of antigenic proteins.&lt;ref&gt;Company press release, Vystar Corporation and Alatech Healthcare Announce FDA Clearance for Envy Natural Rubber Latex Condom Made with Vytex NRL, May 6, 2009.  Retrieved May 13, 2009 from http://www.vytex.com/news&lt;/ref&gt; 

Vytex was created in 2005 by a global team of scientists including Travis Honeycutt, who holds more than 100 patents.   Vystar holds two [[United States patent law|U.S. patents]], an additional pending application, and multiple international patent filings for Vytex NRL.

Vytex is produced by Revertex Malaysia and distributed by Centrotrade Minerals and Metals, Inc.

In May 2018, Vystar acquired the assets of UV Flu Technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rubbernews.com/article/20180510/NEWS/180519999/vystar-acquires-assets-of-uv-flu-technologies|title=Vystar acquires assets of UV Flu Technologies - Rubber &amp; Plastics News|last=Staff|first=Rubber &amp; Plastics News|work=Rubber &amp; Plastics News|access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antigenic proteins==
According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], proteins in latex cause a range of allergic reactions.&lt;ref&gt;Centers for Disease Control. (1997, June).  National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health Publication No. 97-135:  Preventing Allergic Reactions to Natural Rubber Latex in the Workplace.  Retrieved January 4, 2009, from https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/latexalt.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Allergies to latex are most common in healthcare workers, although there is a lack of awareness among nurses that frequent exposure to latex triggers [[latex allergy]].&lt;ref&gt;Bundesen, I. (2008).  Natural Rubber Latex: A Concern for Nurses.  AORN Journal, 88(2), 197-210.&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural rubber latex contains over 200 [[protein]]s, similar to other natural plant materials, of which 13 are known allergens.[need citation]  Vytex NRL is created through a process that significantly reduces these proteins.

==Scientific process==
Vytex Natural Rubber Latex comes from the ''[[Hevea brasiliensis]]'' rubber tree, which is primarily cultivated in Southeast Asia.  Natural rubber latex is a cloudy white liquid collected by cutting a thin strip of bark from the tree and allowing the latex to be secreted into a collection cup over a period of several hours.  After collection, the latex is treated with [[ammonia]] to prevent [[denaturation (biochemistry)|coagulation]] and is transported to a processing facility for concentrating and compounding.  

[[Aluminum hydroxide]], an [[amphoterism|amphoteric]] protein binding chemical,&lt;ref&gt;Vystar Corporation.  (2008, October).  Vytex Natural Rubber Latex Technical Bulletin.&lt;/ref&gt; is added to the latex source material while still in liquid form to complex and remove the antigenic proteins.  Alumnium hydroxide can form a jelly-like structure suspending any unwanted materials in water, including bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;Holtzclaw, H.F., Robinson, W.R., Nebergall, W.H.  General Chemistry (7th edition).  D.C. Heath and Company 1984, 884-885&lt;/ref&gt;  Under certain conditions, it produces [[multiprotein complex|protein complexes]] that are removed from the Vytex NRL solution.&lt;ref&gt;Vystar Corporation and Quant-Tec-Air, Inc.

Samples of treated Vytex NRL are subjected to the [[Lowry protein assay|Modified Lowry ASTM D5712-05 test]], used to measure the total extractable proteins in natural rubber latex,&lt;ref&gt;ASTM D5712 - 05e1 Standard Test Method for Analysis of Aqueous Extractable Protein in Natural Rubber and Its Products Using the Modified Lowry Method; retrieved May 29 from http://www.astm.org/Standards/D5712.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[ELISA| ELISA Inhibition ASTM D6499-07 test]], used to test for antigenic latex proteins.&lt;ref&gt;ASTM D6499 - 07 Standard Test Method for The Immunological Measurement of Antigenic Protein in Natural Rubber and its Products; retrieved May 29 from http://www.astm.org/Standards/D6499.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 

Un-leached sample films and products made with Vytex NRL have been independently tested for protein levels at three time intervals: immediately after production, after 21 days of storage, and after 6 months of storage.&lt;ref name="vytex.com"/&gt;

Test results during all phases of protein testing generated less than 10&amp;nbsp;ug/dm² of antigenic protein using the ELISA protein test method.  Products made from Vytex NRL under similar conditions used for Hevea natural rubber latex production frequently exhibit less than 0.2&amp;nbsp;ug/dm² of antigenic protein.  Overall, Vytex NRL typically has 90% fewer antigenic proteins than Hevea natural rubber latex.&lt;ref name="vytex.com"/&gt;

'''''Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?''''' is a 1957 American [[satire|satirical]] [[comedy film]] starring [[Jayne Mansfield]] and [[Tony Randall]], with [[Betsy Drake]], [[Joan Blondell]], [[John Williams (actor)|John Williams]], [[Henry Jones (actor)|Henry Jones]], [[Lili Gentle]], and [[Mickey Hargitay]], and a cameo by [[Groucho Marx]]. The film is a satire on popular fan culture, Hollywood hype, and the advertising industry, which was making millions of dollars off the growing revenue from television ads.  It also takes aim at television and the reduction it caused to the size of movie  theater audiences in the 1950s. The film was also known as '''''Oh! For a Man!''''' in the United Kingdom.

The film was [[film producer|produced]] and [[film director|directed]] by [[Frank Tashlin]], who also wrote the largely original screenplay, using little more than the title and the character of Rita Marlowe from the successful [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] play ''[[Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter? (play)|Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?]]'' by [[George Axelrod]]. The play had run from 1955 to 1956 and also starred Jayne Mansfield as Rita.

==Plot==
In lieu of a theme song and opening of the movie, Tashlin instead laid traditional opening credits over faux television commercials for products that failed to deliver what they promised.

From this comedic segue, the film opens on a writer for television advertising, Rockwell P. Hunter ([[Tony Randall]]), who is low on the ladder at the La Salle agency, the company where he works. With the agency set to lose its biggest account &amp;ndash; Stay-Put Lipstick &amp;ndash; he hatches an idea to get the perfect model and spokeswoman for Stay-Put's new line of lipstick, the famous actress with the "oh-so-kissable lips", Rita Marlowe (Jayne Mansfield).  

For Rita to endorse the lipstick, however, Rock has to pretend to be her boyfriend to make her real boyfriend, Bobo Branigansky (Hargitay), the star of a TV Tarzan show, jealous. Bobo leaks the news of Rita's new romance to the tabloids and Rock Hunter is suddenly famous as Marlowe's "Lover Doll". Hunter's boss decides to leverage his employee's newfound fame, but when Hunter also gets Marlowe to agree on a television spectacular sponsored by Stay-Put, Hunter becomes the advertising firm's highest-regarded employee. Marlowe, meanwhile, is miserable; she thinks she is falling in love with Hunter, but her one real true love is the man who discovered her, George Schmidlap ([[Groucho Marx]]). Not being able to find Schmidlap, she pursues Hunter, though her Secretary "Vi" (Joan Blondell) warns her that she is playing a dangerous game. (Ironically, Blondell, who plays Mansfield's frumpy, middle-aged, all-business secretary, was herself a major movie sex symbol some 30 years before, and whose sexuality was one of the first victims of the [[Hays Code]]). 

Hunter soon finds fame to be a double-edged sword, getting him what he wants, but with a price to be paid for that success. Women are crazy about him, and he has no peace of mind. Ultimately, he moves up the ladder at work, becoming company president, only to find it is not what he really wanted. Hunter confesses to his angry fiancée Jenny that he finds himself at the top of the heap without any meaning and she takes him back.

As Rita Marlowe opens her television spectacular for Stay-Put Lipstick, she is surprised by the appearance of the show's "surprise" guest star of (and the first real love of her life), George Schmidlap.

Freed from strain of advertising, Rock and Jenny retire to the country to tend a chicken farm, announcing that he has found the real living end.

==Production==
''Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?'' received a nomination for a [[Golden Globe]] for Best Motion Picture Actor – Musical/Comedy (Tony Randall) and a nomination for the [[Writers Guild of America, East]] WGA Award (Screen) for Best Written American Comedy (Frank Tashlin). The character, Rita Marlowe, is based on dumb blond stereotype epitomized by roles performed by [[Marilyn Monroe]] at the time.  

The film contains joking references to several of Mansfield's other roles, including ''[[The Girl Can't Help It]]'' (1956; also directed by Tashlin), ''[[Kiss Them for Me (film)|Kiss Them for Me]]'' (1957), and ''[[The Wayward Bus (film)|The Wayward Bus]]'' (1957). The book Mansfield reads in the bathtub scene is ''[[Peyton Place (novel)|Peyton Place]]'' (1956) by [[Grace Metalious]], which became a feature film and a popular TV series that is claimed to be the forerunner of primetime soap operas. The buxom characters in the book were claimed to have been inspired by Mansfield.&lt;ref&gt;Emily Toth; ''Inside Peyton Place: The Life of Grace Metalious''; page 144; University Press of Mississippi; 200&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
''Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?'' is known as Mansfield's "signature film", and is in a package called "The Jayne Mansfield Collection" along with ''The Girl Can't Help It'' (1956) and ''[[The Sheriff of Fractured Jaw]]'' (1958).

In 2000, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".

'''Sir Woolf Fisher''' (20 May 1912 – 12 January 1975) was a New Zealand businessman and [[philanthropist]] who co-founded [[Fisher &amp; Paykel]], a [[major appliance]] manufacturing company, and the Ra Ora Stud, an important [[Thoroughbred]] [[Horse racing|racehorse]] breeding operation.

Born in [[Wellington]], his family moved to [[Auckland]] where he studied at [[Mount Albert Grammar School]]. Woolf is the oldest brother of renowned fashion entrepreneur and philanthropist, [[Gus Fisher (fashion)|Gus Fisher]]. A salesman turned businessman, Fisher was involved in a number of successful New Zealand enterprises. He served as the first chairman of New Zealand Steel Ltd. 

In 1960, he established the Woolf Fisher Trust to provide funding that maintained the salaries of post-primary schoolteachers and principals while sending them overseas to further their education. Fisher also supported the [[Outward Bound]] Trust of New Zealand and in 1961 became its first president.

In the [[1964 New Year Honours]] Fisher was appointed a [[Knight Bachelor]] for public services, particularly in connection with the development of industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=43202 |date=1 January 1964 |page=39 |supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt; He died in 1975 while at his vacation home on the lake at [[Rotorua]]. Following its formation, in 1994 Woolf Fisher was inducted in the [[New Zealand Business Hall of Fame]].[http://www.enzt.co.nz/~enztWeb/halloffame/2005/hof2005.htm]

==Thoroughbred racing==
A [[polo]] enthusiast who was responsible for the revival of the [[Auckland Polo Club]] in 1955, Fisher became a major figure in the sport of Thoroughbred racing. In 1950 he established Ra Ora Stud at [[Mount Wellington, New Zealand|Mount Wellington]] whose success led to new facilities being constructed in 1962 on 71.6 hectares at East Tamaki, just out of Auckland. The breeding farm stood important [[Stallion (horse)|stallions]] such as [[Sovereign Edition (Ire)]], [[Soviet Star (USA)]], [[Nassipour (USA)]], [[Desert Sun (GB)]], and [[Marju (USA)]], among others. Ra Ora Stud continued in operation after Fisher's death in 1975. Run by a Board of Trustees for his estate [http://www.woolffishertrust.co.nz/wft/profile.htm], it closed in 2001 and its bloodstock sold at auction.[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1300&amp;dat=19750516&amp;id=k3cQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OJIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5201,3825428] [http://www.nzb.co.nz/sales/sale.cfm?sale_id=56] 

Fisher served on the [[Board of Directors]] of the [[Auckland Racing Club]] for 17 years, with two years as its president.

"Plunge Protection Team" was originally the headline for an article in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' on February 23, 1997,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/business/longterm/blackm/plunge.htm | work=The Washington Post | author= | date=February 23, 1997 | title=Plunge Protection Team | access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has since been used by some as an informal term to refer to the Working Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url-access=subscription |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;grid=&amp;xml=/money/2006/10/30/ccview30.xml|title=Monday view: Paulson re-activates secretive support team to prevent markets meltdown|last=Evans-Pritchard|first=Ambrose|date=October 30, 2006|publisher=Telegraph UK|access-date=September 15, 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4258005,00.html|title=Fed to prop up Wall St|last=Wachman|first=Richard|author2=Jamie Doward Observer |date=2001-09-16|publisher=Guardian Unlimited|access-date=September 15, 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the term was used to express the opinion that the Working Group was being used to prop up the [[stock market]]s during downturns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/business/longterm/blackm/plunge.htm|title=Plunge Protection Team |last=Fromson|first=Brett.

He stated that "If the money to boost stock prices did not come from the traditional players, it had to have come from somewhere else" and "Why not support the stock market as well? Moreover, several officials have suggested the government should support stock prices."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.moneynews.com/StreetTalk/CharlesBiderman-Fed-government-Rigging/2010/01/06/id/345497|title=Biderman: Fed, Gov't Likely Rigging Market Rally|last=Crawshaw |first=Julie|date=2010-01-10|publisher=Money News|access-date=April 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2005, Sprott Asset Management released a report that argued that there is little doubt that the PPT intervened to protect the stock market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sprott.com/Docs/SpecialReports/08_2005_TheVisibleHand.pdf|title=Sprott Asset Management|author=|date=|publisher=|access-date=November 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, these articles usually refer to the Working Group using moral suasion to attempt to convince banks to buy stock index futures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://registeredrep.com/mag/finance_stock_markets_da/ Federal Government Manipulating Equities Market?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Federal Reserve Board member Robert Heller, in the ''Wall Street Journal'', opined that "Instead of flooding the entire economy with liquidity, and thereby increasing the danger of inflation, the Fed could support the stock market directly by buying market averages in the futures market, thereby stabilizing the market as a whole." {{Citation needed span|date=August 2018|text=His statement has been used to claim that the Fed actually did act in that way.}} Some{{who|date=May 2014}} mainstream analysts call those claims a [[conspiracy theory]], explaining that such claims are simplistic and unworkable.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, ''The Boston Globe''.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=August 2018}} Author [[Kevin Phillips (political commentator)|Kevin Phillips]] wrote in his 2008 book ''Bad Money'' that while he had no interest "in becoming a conspiracy investigator", he nevertheless drew the conclusion that "some kind of high-level decision seems to have been reached in Washington to loosely institutionalize a rescue mechanism for the stock market akin to that pursued...to safeguard major U.S. banks from exposure to domestic and foreign loan and currency crises."&lt;ref name="Phillips 2008"&gt;{{Cite book| last=Phillips | first=K. | year=2008 | title=Bad Money: Reckless Finance, Failed Politics, and the Global Crisis of American Capitalism | publisher=Viking | isbn=978-0-670-01907-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Phillips infers that the simplest way for the Working Group to intervene in market plunges would be through buying [[stock market index]] [[futures contracts]], either in cooperation with major banks or through [[trading room|trading desks]] at the U.S. Treasury or Federal Reserve.&lt;ref name="Phillips 2008"/&gt;

==Market crisis of 2008==
On October 6, 2008, the working group issued a statement indicating that it was taking multiple actions available to it in order to attempt to stabilize the financial system, although purchase of stock shares was not part of the statement.&lt;ref name="October_statment"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/hp1177.aspx|title=Statement by the President's Working Group on Financial Markets|publisher=[[United States Department of the Treasury]]|access-date=October 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government may wind up owning shares in the firms to which it provided loans, as they will receive warrants as collateral for these loans.
