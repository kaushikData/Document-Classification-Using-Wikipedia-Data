      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6871">'''Alfredo Chavero''' (1841–1906) was a [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[archaeologist]], politician, poet, and dramatist. "Perhaps Chavero's most enduring claim to remembrance rests...on [his] completion and extension of [[José Fernando Ramírez|Ramírez]]'s plans to republish major native histories and his editorship of pictorial documents."&lt;ref&gt;[[Howard F. Cline]], "Selected Nineteenth-Century Mexican Writers on Ethnohistory", section "Alfredo Chavero, 1841-1906" in ''Handbook of Middle American Indians, vol. 13. Guide to Ethnohistorical Sources''. Austin: University of Texas Press 1973 p. 388.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
He has made many investigations relative to Mexican antiquities, and written ''Historia Antigua de Mexico'', also several works on [[Aztec people|Aztec]] archaeology, especially on ancient monuments. While making excavations in the [[Great Pyramid of Cholula|pyramids of Cholula]], he discovered some idols that are now in the [[Museo Nacional de Historia|National Museum of Mexico]].

He became a member of the Mexican Congress in 1869, and supported Presidents [[Benito Juárez]], [[Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada]], [[Manuel González Flores|Manuel González]], and [[Porfirio Díaz]] in succession, notwithstanding their different policies. On 25 June 1879, the government of Diaz ordered the execution of nine citizens of [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Vera Cruz]] who were suspected of conspiracy. This act was severely criticised, and great indignation was shown against Mier y Terán, who had executed the order, and against Diaz. Chavero, then grand master of a [[Freemasonry|masonic lodge]], and expelled Mier y Terán from the brotherhood, and suspended Diaz from his masonic rights. This action gave Chavero great popularity. In congress Chavero also made a strong speech against Mier and Diaz, but afterward became one of his adherents. Chavero was elected senator in 1886, and was professor in the mining and law schools of Mexico.

He is the author of the dramas “La Reina Xochitl” and “La tempestad de un beso,” “Quetzalcoatl,” “Los amores de Alarcón,” “La hermana de los Ávilas,” “El mundo de ahora,” and others. His books relative to [[Bernardino de Sahagún|Father Sahagún]] and to the [[Aztec calendar stone|Sun Stone]] are often referred to.

Chavero was elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]] in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlistc American Antiquarian Society Members Directory]&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Mexican government proposed the Law of Monuments (1897), which passed overwhelmingly in the Mexican Congress, Chavero opposed the provision banned the export of Mexican artifacts, which in his view "hindered the flow of artifacts to museums abroad and thus obstructed the cause of science."&lt;ref&gt;Christina Bueno, ''The Pursuit of Ruins: Archeology, History, and the Making of Modern Mexico''. Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press 2016, p.84-85.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the 1902 [[International Congress of Americanists]] in New York, Chavero gave some credit to the French project headed by the Duke of Loubat for major discoveries at [[Monte Albán]]. This public declaration before Americanist luminaries, such as [[Eduard Seler]] and [[Franz Boas]] was interrupted by [[Leopoldo Batres]], inspector national monuments, Chavero's rival who had excavated at Monte Albán, who strenuously objected to Chavero's assertion, since the work was paid for by the Mexican government.&lt;ref&gt;Bueno, ''The Pursuit of Ruins]], pp. 125-26&lt;/ref&gt;

He donated the [[Chavero Codex of Huexotzingo]] to the [[Museo Nacional de Antropología|National Museum of Mexico]] in 1906.&lt;ref name ="worlddigitallibrary"&gt;{{Cite web

==Mathematical modelling and cliodynamics==
[[File:clio.jpg|right|thumb|Clio—detail from ''[[The Art of Painting|The Allegory of Painting]]'' by [[Johannes Vermeer]]]]

===Global dynamics===
In this field he has proposed one of the most convincing mathematical explanations for [[Heinz von Foerster|von Foerster's]] [[Doomsday Equation]].&lt;ref name=cliodynamics&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Korotayev A. |author2=Malkov A. |author3=Khaltourina D. |url=http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=172&amp;Itemid=70|title=''Introduction to Social Macrodynamics: Secular Cycles and Millennial Trends''|place=Moscow|publisher=URSS|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In collaboration with his colleagues, Artemy Malkov and [[Daria Khaltourina]], he has shown that till the 1970s the [[hyperbolic growth]] of the [[world population]] was accompanied by [[quadratic function|quadratic]]-[[hyperbolic growth]] of the world GDP, and developed a number of [[mathematical model]]s describing both of these phenomena simultaneously; he has also described mathematically the [[World-system theory|World System]] withdrawal from the [[hyperbolic growth|blow-up regime]] observed in the recent decades.&lt;ref name="cliodynamics.ru"&gt;See, e.g., Korotayev A., Malkov A., Khaltourina D. [http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=124&amp;Itemid=70 '''Introduction to Social Macrodynamics: Compact Macromodels of the World System Growth''']. Moscow: URSS Publishers, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The hyperbolic growth of the [[world population]] and quadratic-hyperbolic growth of the world GDP observed till the 1970s have been correlated by him and his colleagues to a non-linear second order [[positive feedback]] between the [[demographic]] growth and technological development that can be spelled out as follows: technological growth – increase in the [[carrying capacity]] of land for people – demographic growth – more people – more potential inventors – acceleration of technological growth – accelerating growth of the [[carrying capacity]] – the faster [[population growth]] – accelerating growth of the number of potential inventors – faster technological growth – hence, the faster growth of the Earth's carrying capacity for people, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Korotayev A., Malkov A., Khaltourina D. [http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=124&amp;Itemid=70 '''Introduction to Social Macrodynamics: Compact Macromodels of the World System Growth''']. Moscow: URSS Publishers, 2006; Korotayev A. V. [http://jwsr.ucr.edu/archive/vol11/number1/pdf/jwsr-v11n1-korotayev.pdf A Compact Macromodel of World System Evolution // Journal of World-Systems Research 11/1 (2005): 79–93] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706205516/http://jwsr.ucr.edu/archive/vol11/number1/pdf/jwsr-v11n1-korotayev.pdf |date=6 July 2009 }}; for a detailed mathematical analysis of this issue see [https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.0496 A Compact Mathematical Model of the World System Economic and Demographic Growth, 1 CE – 1973 CE]; for an analysis of this pattern suggested by Korotayev see, e.g., Carter, B., (2008), "Five or six step scenario for evolution?" Int. J.
Astrobiology 7 (2008) 177–182. As Francis Heylighen puts it, "an elegant example is the explanation by Korotayev of the hyperbolic growth of the world population until 1960.
In the model, population growth is initially modeled by a traditional logistic growth
equation, where population N starts by growing exponentially but then slows
down until it reaches the maximum value expressed by the carrying capacity of the
environment. This carrying capacity is proportional to the overall productivity of
technology, i.e. its ability to extract from the natural environment the resources
necessary for survival. In a second equation, the growth of technological productivity is considered to be proportional to the technology that is already there
(simple exponential growth), but also to the population number, under the simple
assumption that more individuals will discover more innovations. The authors shows that the two equations together produce a hyperbolic growth curve that mimics the observed historical growth of world population with a surprising accuracy (explaining over 99% of the variation for the period 500 BC–1962)" ({{Cite book|last=Heylighen|first=Francis|author-link=Francis Heylighen|year=2007|contribution=Accelerating Socio-Technological Evolution: from ephemeralization and stigmergy to the global brain|contribution-url= http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/AcceleratingEvolution.pdf|editor-last=[[George Modelski|Modelski]]|editor-first=G.|editor2-last=Devezas|editor2-first=T.|editor3-last= Thompson|editor3-first= W.|title=Globalization as an Evolutionary Process: Modeling Global Change|place=London|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=978-0-415-77361-4}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social and biological macroevolution===
[[File:Phanerozoic Biodiversity.svg|300px|left|thumb|During the Phanerozoic the [[biodiversity]] shows a steady but not monotonic increase from near zero to several thousands of genera.]]

In collaboration with [[Alexander V. Markov]] he has demonstrated that a similar mathematical model can be developed to describe the [[Largest-scale trends in evolution|macrotrends]] of biological [[evolution]]. They have shown that changes in [[biodiversity]] through the [[Phanerozoic]] correlate much better with hyperbolic model (widely used in [[demography]] and [[macrosociology]]) than with [[Exponential growth|exponential]] and [[Logistic function|logistic]] models (traditionally used in [[population biology]] and extensively applied to [[fossil]] [[biodiversity]] as well). The latter models imply that changes in diversity are guided by a first-order [[positive feedback]] (more ancestors, more descendants) and/or a [[negative feedback]] arising from resource limitation. Hyperbolic model implies a second-order [[positive feedback]]. The hyperbolic pattern of the world [[population growth]] has been demonstrated by Korotayev to arise from a second-order positive feedback between the population size and the rate of [[technological growth]]. According to Korotayev and Markov, the hyperbolic character of biodiversity growth can be similarly accounted for by a feedback between the diversity and community structure [[complexity]]. They suggest that the similarity between the curves of [[biodiversity]] and human population probably comes from the fact that both are derived from the interference of the hyperbolic trend with cyclical and [[stochastic]] dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B83WC-4N0HJMK-2&amp;_user=1300184&amp;_coverDate=12%2F31%2F2007&amp;_rdoc=6&amp;_fmt=summary&amp;_orig=browse&amp;_srch=doc-info(%23toc%2333783%232007%23999839995%23671853%23FLA%23display%23Volume)&amp;_cdi=33783&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;_ct=9&amp;_acct=C000052237&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=1300184&amp;md5=d9c2663e7fbd6a77385d61334953d75d Alexander V.

===Cliodynamics and the study of the Arab Spring===
[[File:Cairo mosques.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cairo]].]]

In the field of [[cliodynamics]], Korotayev has developed a number of mathematical models of interaction between the very long-term, "millennial" hyperbolic trend dynamics of social [[system]]s and the shorter-term, "secular" (that is, observed at the scale of centuries), cyclical dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;http://escholarship.org/uc/item/9c96x0p1&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Day of Anger marchers in street.jpg|thumb|right|The "Day of Revolt" on 25 January 2011 in Cairo]]
He has also produced a number of mathematical models describing specifically long-term political-demographic dynamics of [[Egypt]]&lt;ref name="urss.ru"&gt;Korotayev A.V., Khaltourina D.A.

P. 341–356].&lt;/ref&gt; Note also his recent interpretation of the Arab Spring events as a trigger of a global "phase transition".&lt;ref&gt;http://polit.ru/article/2015/08/10/arab_spring/&lt;/ref&gt;

Of special importance is his study of the [[hypothesis]] that population pressure causes increased [[warfare]]. This hypothesis has been recently criticised on the empirical grounds. Both studies focusing on specific historical societies and analyses of cross-cultural data have failed to find positive correlation between population density and incidence of warfare. Korotayev, in collaboration with [[Peter Turchin]], has shown that such negative results do not falsify the population-warfare hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=281&amp;Itemid=1 Population Dynamics and Internal Warfare: A Reconsideration]. ''[[Social Evolution &amp; History]]'' 5/2 (2006): 112–147.&lt;/ref&gt; Population and warfare are dynamical variables, and if their interaction causes sustained oscillations, then we do not in general expect to find strong correlation between the two variables measured at the same time (that is, unlagged). Korotayev and Turchin have explored mathematically what the dynamical patterns of interaction between population and warfare (focusing on internal warfare) might be in both stateless and state societies. Next, they have tested the model predictions in several empirical case studies: early modern England, Han and [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] China, and the [[Roman Empire]]. Their empirical results have supported the population-warfare theory: Korotayev and Turchin have found that there is a tendency for population numbers and internal warfare intensity to oscillate with the same period but shifted in [[phase (waves)|phase]] (with warfare peaks following population peaks). Furthermore, they have demonstrated that in the agrarian societies the rates of change of the two variables behave precisely as predicted by the theory: population rate of change is negatively affected by warfare intensity, while warfare rate of change is positively affected by population density.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=281&amp;Itemid=1 Population Dynamics and Internal Warfare: A Reconsideration].

Thus, Korotayev has demonstrated that the [[Malthusian trap]] tends to generate sociopolitical upheavals.&lt;ref name="urss.ru"/&gt; On the other hand, he has shown that the escape from the [[Malthusian trap]] is accompanied by another "trap" generating new sociopolitical upheavals (what he calls "a trap at the escape from the trap").&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=276&amp;Itemid=70 Egyptian Revolution: A Demographic Structural Analysis.

In collaboration with [[Daria Khaltourina]] he has made a significant contribution to the study of the factors of the [[Russian Cross|current Russian demographic crisis]]. They have demonstrated that post-Soviet Russia experiences one of the world's highest prevalence of alcohol-related problems, which contributes to high mortality rates in this region. Reduction in alcohol-related problems in Russia can have strong effects on mortality decline. They have analysed the plausibility of application of general principles of alcohol policy translated in the [[Russian Federation]]. Korotayev and Khaltourina have shown that alcohol policy approaches could be implemented in the same ways as they have been in other countries, and contributed to the development of alcohol control measures in this country. In addition, according to Korotayev, there should be special attention to decreasing distilled spirits consumption, illegal alcohol production, nonbeverage alcohol consumption, and enforcement of current governmental regulations.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Korotayev A., [[Khaltourina D.]] [http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=376&amp;Itemid=1 Russian Demographic Crisis in Cross-National Perspective.

===Literacy and the Spirit of Capitalism===
Korotayev and his colleagues have demonstrated that [[Protestantism]] has indeed influenced positively the capitalist development of respective social systems not so much through the "Protestant ethics" (as was suggested by [[Max Weber]]) but rather through the promotion of literacy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Korotayev]] A., Malkov A., Khaltourina D. (2006), ''Introduction to Social Macrodynamics'', Moscow: URSS, {{ISBN|5-484-00414-4}} [http://urss.ru/cgi-bin/db.pl?cp=&amp;lang=en&amp;blang=en&amp;list=14&amp;page=Book&amp;id=34250] ([http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=187&amp;Itemid=70 Chapter 6: Reconsidering Weber: Literacy and "the Spirit of Capitalism"]). P.87-91.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Die protestantische Ethik und der 'Geist' des Kapitalismus original cover.jpg|thumb|right|150px]] They draw attention to the fact that the ability to read was essential for [[Protestants]] (unlike [[Catholics]]) to perform their religious duty − to read the Bible. The reading of Holy Scripture was not necessary for Catholic laymen. The edict of the Toulouse [[Synod]] (1229) prohibited Catholic laity from possessing copies of the Bible. Soon after that, a decision by the Tarragon Synod spread this prohibition to ecclesiastic people as well. In 1408, the Oxford Synod absolutely prohibited translations of the Holy Scripture. From the very beginning, Protestant groups did not accept this prohibition. Thus, [[Martin Luther|Luther]] translated in 1522–1534 first the [[New Testament]], and then the [[Old Testament]], into German, so that any German-speaking person could read the Holy Scripture in his or her native language. Moreover, the Protestants viewed reading the Holy Scripture as a religious duty of any Christian. As a result, the level of literacy and education was, in general, higher for Protestants than it was for Catholics and for followers of other confessions that did not provide religious stimuli for learning literacy. Literate populations have many more opportunities to obtain and use the achievements of modernisation than illiterate ones and display greater innovative-activity levels, which correspond with opportunities for modernisation, development, and economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sagepub.com/books/Book226639&lt;/ref&gt; Empirical tests performed by Korotayev and his colleagues have confirmed the presence of a rather strong and highly significant [[correlation]] between the early introduction of mass literacy and subsequent high rates of capitalist economic development.&lt;ref&gt;[[Korotayev]] A., Malkov A., Khaltourina D. (2006), ''Introduction to Social Macrodynamics'', Moscow: URSS, {{ISBN|5-484-00414-4}} [http://urss.ru/cgi-bin/db.pl?cp=&amp;lang=en&amp;blang=en&amp;list=14&amp;page=Book&amp;id=34250] ([http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=187&amp;Itemid=70 Chapter 6: Reconsidering Weber: Literacy and "the Spirit of Capitalism"]). P.88-91.&lt;/ref&gt;

==World-system analysis==
[[File:Silk route.jpg|thumb|left|The 11th century World System]]
Andrey Korotayev claims that the present-day [[world-system]] ("the World System"), which in the 2nd millennium CE encompassed the whole globe, originated in the 9th millennium BCE in direct connection with the [[Neolithic revolution]].&lt;ref name=komkniga&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Korotayev A. |author2=Malkov A. |author3=Khaltourina D. |year=2006|url=http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=124&amp;Itemid=70|title=''Introduction to Social Macrodynamics: Compact Macromodels of the World System Growth''|place=Moscow|publisher=KomKniga|isbn= 5-484-00414-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Korotayev, the centre of this system was originally in West Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.sociostudies.org/journal/articles/143130/|title=Review of Social Macroevolution: Genesis and Transformation of the World System by Leonid Grinin and Andrey Korotayev |publisher=Social Studies|accessdate=31 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, Korotayev and his colleagues have suggested a rather novel approach to the [[world-system]] analysis. Within this approach the main emphasis is moved to the generation and [[diffusion]] of [[innovation]]s. If a society borrows systematically important technological innovations, its [[evolution]] already cannot be considered as really independent, but should rather be considered as a part of a larger evolving entity, within which such innovations are systematically produced and diffused. The main idea of the world-system approach was to find the evolving unit. The basic idea was that it is impossible to account for the evolution of a single society without taking into consideration that it was a part of a larger whole. However, traditional world-system analysis concentrated on bulk-good movements, and core – periphery exploitation, somehow neglecting the above-mentioned dimension. However, according to Korotayev, the information [[wikt:network|network]] turns out to be the oldest mechanism of the World System integration, and remained extremely important throughout its whole history, remaining important up to the present. It seems to be even more important than the core – periphery [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] (for example, without taking this mechanism into consideration it appears impossible to account for such things as the demographic explosion in the 20th century, whose proximate cause was the dramatic decline of [[wikt:mortality|mortality]], but whose main ultimate cause was the diffusion of innovations produced almost exclusively within the World System core). This also suggests a redefinition of the World System core. Within the approach in question the core is not the World System zone, which exploits other zones, but rather the World System core is the zone with the highest innovation donor/recipient ratio, the principal innovation donor.&lt;ref name=komkniga/&gt;

[[File:Population curve.svg|thumb|right|360px|Hyperbolic trend of the world population growth]]
Korotayev suggests that the hyperbolic trend observed for the world population growth after 10000 BCE does appear to be primarily a product of the growth of the World System.[http://www.sociostudies.org/journal/articles/143130/] The presence of the [[Hyperbolic growth|hyperbolic]] trend itself indicates that the major part of the entity in question had some systemic unity, and Korotayev insists that the evidence for this unity is readily available. Indeed, he shows that we have evidence for the systematic spread of major innovations (domesticated cereals, cattle, sheep, goats, horses, plow, wheel, copper, bronze, and later iron technology, and so on) throughout the whole North African – Eurasian [[Oikumene]] for a few millennia BCE. As a result, the evolution of societies of this part of the world already at this time cannot be regarded as truly independent. By the end of the 1st millennium BCE we observe a belt of cultures, stretching from the Atlantic to the Pacific, with an astonishingly similar level of cultural complexity characterised by agricultural production of wheat and other specific cereals, the breeding of cattle, sheep, and goats; use of the plow, iron metallurgy, and wheeled transport; development of professional armies and cavalries deploying rather similar weapons; elaborate bureaucracies, and [[Axial Age]] ideologies, and so on – this list could be extended for pages. A few millennia before, we would find another belt of societies strikingly similar in level and character of cultural complexity, stretching from the [[Balkans]] up to the [[Indus]] Valley outskirts. Korotayev interprets this as a tangible result of the World System's functioning.&lt;ref&gt;Korotayev A. V.

===Great Divergence and Great Convergence===

Together with [[Leonid Grinin]] he has also made a significant contribution to the current [[Great Divergence]] debate.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319177793 ''Great Divergence and Great Convergence. A Global Perspective''] (Springer, 2015, with [[Leonid Grinin]]).&lt;/ref&gt; As is noted by [[Jack Goldstone]], the "new view, carefully presented and rigorously modeled by Grinin and Korotayev, provides a richer and more nuanced version of the "Great Divergence," bridging many of the differences between the traditional and California viewpoints. Yet they go further. Amazingly, by building a model using human capital (education), global population growth, and regional productivity, they show how both the Great Divergence and the recent "Great Convergence" (the economic catching up of developing countries) are phases of the same process of global modernisation."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sociostudies.org/journal/articles/588606/ Goldstone, Jack A. "Great Divergence and Great Convergence in a Global Perspective." Social Evolution &amp; History 15.2 (2016): 197–198.]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Korotayev's research has revealed a close coupling between phases of global [[demographic transition]] and phases of the Great Divergence and Great Convergence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/12812235/Phases_of_global_demographic_transition_correlate_with_phases_of_the_Great_Divergence_and_Great_Convergence Korotayev A. et al.

===Kondratieff waves===
[[File:Kondratieff Wave.svg|right|thumb|400px|A rough schematic drawing showing the "World Economy" over time according to the Kondratiev theory]]

Note also his research on [[Kondratiev wave]]s in the world GDP dynamics that, employing [[Frequency domain|spectral analysis]], has confirmed their presence at an acceptable level of statistical significance.&lt;ref&gt;Korotayev, Andrey V., &amp; Tsirel, Sergey V.(2010).

''Structure and Dynamics''. Vol.4. No. 1. P.3-57. Referring to this article, John A. Mathews notes: "The Russian [[polymath]] Andrey Korotayev together with his collaborator Sergey Tsirel has recently revived the study of long waves (or K-waves, after Kondratiev (Kondratieff)) by subjecting the time series to spectral analysis – thereby providing solid proof that these waves exist" ([http://technologygovernance.eu/files/main//2012082809441414.pdf The renewable energies technology surge: A new techno-economic paradigm in the making?  ''Working Papers in Technology Governance and Economic Dynamics. The Other Canon Foundation, Norway''.  2012. No. 44]. P. 6. Note 6)&lt;/ref&gt;

He has also detected Kondratieff waves in the global dynamics of [[invention]] activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.techfore.2011.02.011|title=Kondratieff waves in global invention activity (1900–2008)|year=2011 |last1=Korotayev|first1=Andrey |last2=Zinkina|first2=Julia|last3=Bogevolnov |first3=Justislav|journal=Technological Forecasting and Social Change|volume=78|issue=7|pages=1280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===General theory of social macroevolution===
In addition, it appears necessary to maintain that Korotayev's theory of the [[World-system|World System]] development suggests a novel approach to the formation of a general theory of social macroevolution. The approach prevalent in social evolutionism is based on the assumption that evolutionary regularities of simple systems are significantly simpler than the ones characteristic of complex systems. A rather logical outcome of this almost self-evident assumption is that one should first study the evolutionary regularities of simple systems and only after understanding them move to more complex ones, whereas Korotayev's findings suggest that the simplest regularities accounting for extremely large proportions of all the macrovariation can be found precisely for the largest possible [[system]] – the human world, and, hence, the study of [[social evolution]] should proceed from the detection of simple regularities of the development of the most [[complex systems]] to the study of the complex laws of the dynamics of simple social systems.&lt;ref&gt;Korotayev A.

==Cross-cultural studies==

From a complexity perspective Korotayev's establishes a key point, that of the bifurcations of social and [[kinship]] organisation that coalesced historically around the differential practices of the major [[world religions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.academia.edu/37305025/World_Religions_and_Social_Evolution_of_the_Old_World_Oikumene_Civilizations_A_Cross-Cultural_Perspective_full_version_|author =Andrey Korotayev|title= World Religions and Social Evolution of the Old World Oikumene Civilizations: a Cross-Cultural Perspective|publisher=[[Edwin Mellen Press|Mellen Press]]|accessdate=31 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It draws on the World Cultural database and the world religion as well as other variables. The [[Murdock]]ian comparative approach, up to Korotayev, had developed to the point where the nonindependence of cultures was well-recognized, and ways of taking the larger configurations of cultural systems into account had been reckoned to lie, in the latest iteration, along lines of high-order proto-linguistic communities. Korotayev demonstrates the effects of breaking what might be seen as a ritual taboo of Murdockian comparison: Thou Shalt Not Code World Religion. By doing so, Korotayev releases the Murdockian spell that lingers over the comparative approach in anthropology, and goes on to demonstrate the powerful effects of world religious communities — dating from what [[Karl Jaspers|Jaspers]] calls the "[[Axial Age]]" (800–200&amp;nbsp;BCE) – on the preservation and differentiation of distinctive social and political structures in [[Eurasia]]. His introduction and conclusion suggest that an objectivist natural history approach to human history, in which subjective factors are of local importance but fade out in terms of lasting effects over generations, is a valid approach to the "pre-Axial" condition of human societies, while a subjectivist history of consciousness is a necessary complement to the "post-Axial" condition. Korotayev succeeds in placing these two complementary approaches in context and showing their linkages in terms of how subjective and religious factors play out in human history alongside objective factors such as demography and ecology, each informing the other. He shows how it is impossible to arrive at valid inferential results from comparative approaches without an integration of the two, a situation he aptly calls "[[Galton]]'s opportunity" for those are of century-old critiques of the comparative method. The reader will be surprised at the depth of empirical comparative findings in this short book. Following [[Murray Leaf]]'s '''Man, Mind and Science''' (1974) this work is a major contribution to repair of the material/ideational rift in anthropology.

===Matrilocal vs. patrilocal residence===
[[File:Snake Goddess - Heraklion Achaeological Museum retouched.jpg|thumb|left|Snake Goddess – Heraklion Archaeological Museum.]]

One of his particular contributions in this field is connected with the classical anthropological issue of determinants of [[matrilocal]] versus [[patrilocal]] postmarital residence. Early theories explaining the determinants of postmarital residence (e.g., [[Lewis Henry Morgan]], [[Edward Tylor]], or [[George Peter Murdock]]) connected it with the sexual division of labour. However, to the moment when Korotayev's research in this field began, cross-cultural tests of this [[hypothesis]] using worldwide samples had failed to find any significant relationship between these two variables. Korotayev's tests have shown that the female contribution to subsistence does correlate significantly with matrilocal residence in general; however, this correlation is masked by a general polygyny factor. Although an increase in the female contribution to subsistence tends to lead to matrilocal residence, it also tends simultaneously to lead to general non-sororal [[polygyny]] which effectively destroys [[matrilocality]]. If this polygyny factor is controlled (e. g., through a multiple [[Regression analysis|regression]] model), division of labour turns out to be a significant predictor of postmarital residence. Thus, Murdock's hypotheses regarding the relationships between the sexual division of labour and postmarital residence were basically correct, though, as has been shown by Korotayev, the actual relationships between those two groups of variables are more complicated than he expected.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Korotayev A.

===Unilineal descent and Christianization===
[[File:Kiev vasnetcov.jpg|thumb|upright|''The [[Baptism of Kiev]]ans'', a fresco by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]].]]

Korotayev studies variables that are usually regarded as the main causes of the decline of [[unilineal descent]] organisation (statehood, class stratification and commercialisation), along with a variable that had never been regarded as such a cause – deep Christianization. He postulates that the traditionally accepted causes of the decline of unilineal descent organisation (statehood, class stratification, commercialisation) are less significant than deep Christianization. He also theorises that the presence of unilineal descent groups correlates negatively with communal democracy and is especially strong for complex traditional societies. Korotayev concludes that, because the communal democracy correlates positively with the supracommunal one, the Christianization of Europe might have contributed to the development of modern democracy by helping to destroy unilineal descent organisation in this region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://www.academia.edu/30721172/Unilineal_Descent_Organization_and_Deep_Christianization_A_Cross-Cultural_Comparison|author =Andrey V.

==Sociopolitical systems in the Middle East and Africa==

===Origins of parallel-cousin marriage===
[[Islam]]ization, along with an area's inclusion in the 8th-century Arab-Islamic [[Caliphate|Khalifate]] (and its persistence within the Islamic world) has been demonstrated by Korotayev to be a strong and significant predictor of [[parallel cousin]] (Father's Brother's Daughter – FBD) marriage. He has shown that while there is a clear functional connection between Islam and FBD marriage, the prescription to marry a FBD does not appear to be sufficient to persuade people to actually marry thus, even if the marriage brings with it economic advantages. According to Korotayev, a systematic acceptance of parallel-cousin marriage took place when Islamization occurred together with Arabization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Korotayev |first1=Andrey |title=Parallel-Cousin (FBD) Marriage, Islamization, and Arabization |journal=[[Ethnology (journal)|Ethnology]] |date= 2000 |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=395 |doi=10.2307/3774053 |jstor=3774053}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yemeni Studies===
[[File:034-YemenHajazbyday2.jpg|thumb|right|400px|[[Yemen]].]]
Korotayev has made a special contribution in this field by detecting principal trends in the evolution of Yemeni cultures through application of quantitative methods to the analysis of mass [[epigraphic]] sources in the [[Sabaean language|Sabaic language]].&lt;ref&gt;E.g., [https://www.academia.edu/3810065/SABAEAN_CULTURAL-POLITICAL_AREA_SOME_GENERAL_TRENDS_OF_EVOLUTION Sabaean Cultural-Political Area: Some General Trends of Evolution // Proceedings of the Seminar for Arabian Studies. 23 (1993): 49–60].&lt;/ref&gt; Korotayev has thereby discovered the phenomenon of consolidation of the [[clan]] organisation in North-East [[Yemen]] in the late 1st millennium BCE as well as the transition from [[chiefdom]]s to [[tribe]]s in early medieval Yemen.&lt;ref&gt;See his ''Ancient Yemen'', Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1994; and his ''Pre-Islamic Yemen'', Wiesbaden, Harrassowitz Verlag, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the first to provide convincing evidence for the existence of [[matrilineal]] descent organisation in Pre-Islamic [[Arabia]]&lt;ref&gt;Korotayev&amp;nbsp;A.&amp;nbsp;V. [http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=319&amp;Itemid=70 "Were There Any Truly Matrilineal Lineages in the Arabian Peninsula?"

===African Studies===
[[File:East and southern africa early iron age.png|thumb|left|200px|Simplified climatic map of Africa. The numbers shown correspond to the dates of all [[Iron Age]] artefacts associated with the [[Bantu expansion]].]]

Korotayev and his colleagues have also made significant contributions to the study of political-demographic dynamics in [[Subsaharan Africa]], especially, the problems of the Tropical African countries' escape from the [[Malthusian trap]].&lt;ref name="Zinkina J. 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="urss.ru"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=309&amp;Itemid=1|title=A Trap at the Escape From The Trap? Demographic-Structural Factors of Political Instability in Modern Africa and West Asia|publisher=Cliodynamics|volume=2|issue=2|year=2011|pages=1–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins of Islam===
Korotayev has also done (together with his colleagues Vladimir Klimenko and Dmitry Proussakov) a significant contribution to the study of the origins of [[Islam]]. Korotayev and his colleagues view the origins of [[Islam]] against the background of the 6th century Arabian socioecological [[crisis]] whose model is specified by Korotayev and his colleagues through the study of [[climatological]], seismological, volcanological and [[epidemiological]] history of the period. They find that most sociopolitical systems of the [[Arabs]] reacted to the socioecological crisis by getting rid of the rigid supratribal political structures (kingdoms and [[chiefdom]]s) which started posing a real threat to their very survival.

The decades of fighting which led to the destruction of the most of the Arabian kingdoms and [[chiefdom]]s (reflected in ''Ayyam al-'Arab'' tradition) led to the elaboration of some definite "antiroyal" freedom-loving tribal [[ethos]]. At the beginning of the 7th century a tribe which would recognise themselves as subjects of some terrestrial supratribal political authority, a "king", risked to lose its honour. However, this seems not to be applicable to the authority of another type, the "celestial" one. At the meantime the early 7th century evidences the merging of the [[Arabian]] tradition of prophecy and the Arabian Monotheist "Rahmanist" tradition which produced "the Arabian prophetic movement".

[[File:Madina Haram at evening.jpg|thumb|right|500px|[[Al-Masjid al-Nabawi]] (the Mosque of the Prophet) in [[Medina]], Saudi Arabia, is the site of [[Muhammad]]'s tomb.]]

According to Korotayev, the Monotheist "Rahmanist" prophets appear to have represented a supratribal authority just of the type many [[Arab]] [[tribe]]s were looking for at this very time, which seems to explain to a certain extent those prophets' political success (including the extreme political success of [[Muhammad]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://www.academia.edu/3510576/ORIGINS_OF_ISLAM_POLITICAL-ANTHROPOLOGICAL_AND_ENVIRONMENTAL_CONTEXT|author1=Korotayev A. |author2=Klimenko V. |author3=Proussakov D. |title=Origins of Islam: Political-Anthropological and Environmental Context|publisher=[[Acta Orientalia Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae]]|volume=53|issue=3–4|pages=243–276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Association for Industrial Archaeology''' ('''AIA''') was established in 1973 to promote the study of [[industrial archaeology]] and to encourage improved standards of recording, research, conservation and publication. It aims to support individuals and groups involved in those objectives and to represent the interests of industrial archaeology at a national level. It is a non-profit making registered charity (No. 277511) and a company limited by guarantee, its registered office is care of the [[Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust]].

== Leadership ==
The association is currently chaired by Mark Sissons, from September 2014, Keith Falconer OBE. The president is Professor Marilyn Palmer, MA (Oxon), Ph.D. Leicester, FSA, Professor Emeritus of Industrial Archaeology, University of Leicester (University of Leicester, January 2014). Overall administration is carried out by an elected Council of Management, whilst day-to-day operations are overseen by the officers of the association.

== Activities ==
Through its council it has contacts with both traditional archaeology and with those statutory organisations responsible for recording, preserving and funding Britain's historic monuments. The council also has contacts with the International Committee for the Conservation Of Industrial Heritage (TICCIH) and, at the European level, the European Federation of Associations of Industrial and Technical Heritage (E-faith).

Since its foundation the association has gathered at an annual conference held at various locations throughout the UK and Ireland. The 2013 conference was held in [[Dundee]], [[Scotland]] with the 2014 conference planned for [[Chester]], [[England]] in September. [[Brighton]], England is the venue for 2015. Each conference occupies a weekend but is followed by several days of visits and lectures. Additionally, the association organizes a spring weekend conference open to both members and non-members.

One important function of the association is to represent the interests of industrial archaeology in the planning process. The AIA is not a Statutory Consultee itself and the association's role in the process is carried out by its Endangered Sites Officer via the Council for British Archaeology (CBA).

Thanks to a series of generous donations the AIA has been able over the last five years to make available Restoration Grants for a number of worthwhile projects. To date seventeen grants have been made, examples of which are:

*Mellor Archaeological Trust for the restoration of the Wellington wheel pit;
*The Waterways Trust for the restoration of Box Boat 337;
*The South Yorkshire Trades Historical Trust for their work on Hoylandswaine Nail Forge.

The grants are for up to £20,000 and are only for capital projects and not on-going running costs. Applicants must be non-profit organisations, trusts, charities etc. and not businesses or individuals. Full details can be found on the association's web-site, see link below.

The AIA also provides an opportunity for taking part in escorted overseas visits that explore engineering history and industrial archaeology. These visits are organized for the association by ''Heritage of Industry'' and details of current and pending visits are to be found on the association's web-site.

== Publications ==
Industrial Archaeology Review, a bi-annual peer-reviewed journal, is sent to all members whilst a quarterly newsletter, the Industrial Archaeology News, contains shorter articles, reviews and a calendar of events. Additional occasional publications include regional gazetteers for areas where annual conferences take place.

== Membership ==

The association has some 520 individual members and approximately 50 local societies and organisations affiliated to it.

'''Aubrey Osborn Gwynn''' (17 February 1892 – 18 May 1983) was an Irish [[Jesuit]] historian.

==Life==
Aubrey Gwynn was born in [[Dublin]] on 17th February 1892. His father was the author and sometime [[Member of Parliament]] [[Stephen Gwynn]]; his paternal grandfather was [[John Gwynn (professor)|John Gwynn]], Regius Professor of Divinity at [[Trinity College Dublin]]. His mother Mary Gwynn (generally known as May Gwynn) was a first cousin of his father's, her own father being the Reverend James Gwynn, sometime chaplain of the [[Octagon Chapel, Bath]].&lt;ref name=”Burke”&gt;''Burke’s Irish Family Records'', Burke’s Peerage Ltd, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; The Gwynn family at that time adhered to the [[Protestant]] tradition.

Aubrey Gwynn converted to [[Roman Catholicism]] at the age of ten, at the same time as his mother May Gwynn was received into the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Kearney, ''Ireland: Contested Ideas of Nationalism and History'' (2007), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Clongowes Wood College]], a Jesuit secondary school in Dublin, from 1903 to 1908, then studied at [[University College, Dublin]] (where he received his BA degree in 1914 and his MA in 1915) and [[Campion Hall]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] (where he obtained the degree of B Litt in 1919). In 1912, while still a student at University College, he became a member of the [[Society of Jesus]].&lt;ref name=”Burke”/&gt;

After graduating Aubrey Gwynn worked as a teacher at [[Clongowes Wood College|Clongowes College]] (1917–1919), [[Catholic University of Leuven (1835–1968)|Louvain]] (1919–1921) and [[Milltown Institute of Theology and Philosophy|Milltown Park]] (1921–1925).&lt;ref name=”Burke”/&gt;

In 1927 Father Aubrey was appointed Lecturer in [[Ancient History]] at University College, Dublin. He went on to lecture in Medieval History (1930-1947), then in 1948 he became the college’s Professor of Medieval History, a post he retained until 1962. He was President of the [[Royal Irish Academy]] from 1958 to 1961. &lt;ref name=”Burke”/&gt;

Aubrey Gwynn wrote extensively on Irish and church history as well as on other topics. His brother [[Denis Gwynn|Denis Rolleston Gwynn]] (1893–1971) was also an historian, being for much of his life Professor of Modern Irish History at [[University College Cork|University College]], Cork.&lt;ref&gt;Cadogan, Tim and Falvey, Jeremiah, ''A Biographical Dictionary of Cork'' (Four Courts Press, 2006), Page 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

A watercolour portrait of Aubrey Gwynn as a child by his godfather [[Walter Osborne]] is in the collection of the [[National Gallery of Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.invaluable.com/auction-lot/walter-frederick-osborne,-r.h.a.-1859-1903-r8c1ivjh3f-47-m-zsb5cemnnl&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>/* Decline of unions */ Added the qualifier "Classical and neoclassical" to the word "Economists" because I'm pretty sure most Keynesian and Marxian economists have never thought this.  I also corrected the logical construction of the second half of the sentence (changed "or" to "and" for 2 necessary but insufficient conditions).</comment>

{{US Income}}
'''Causes of income inequality in the United States''' describes why changes in the country's income distribution are occurring. This topic is subject to extensive ongoing research, media attention, and political interest, as it involves how the national income of the country is split among its people at various income levels.

==Overview==

[[Paul Krugman]] put several of these factors into context in January 2015: "Competition from emerging-economy exports has surely been a factor depressing wages in wealthier nations, although probably not the dominant force. More important, soaring incomes at the top were achieved, in large part, by squeezing those below: by cutting wages, slashing benefits, crushing unions, and diverting a rising share of national resources to financial wheeling and dealing ... Perhaps more important still, the wealthy exert a vastly disproportionate effect on policy. And elite priorities — obsessive concern with budget deficits, with the supposed need to slash social programs — have done a lot to deepen [wage stagnation and income inequality]."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/02/opinion/paul-krugman-twin-peaks-planet.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;module=c-column-top-span-region&amp;region=c-column-top-span-region&amp;WT.nav=c-column-top-span-region NYT-Paul Krugman-Twin Peaks Planet-January 1, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divergence of productivity and compensation==
[[File:Productivity Gap - v1.png|thumb|right|400px|Illustrates the productivity gap (i.e., the annual growth rate in productivity minus annual growth rate in compensation) by industry from 1985-2015.  Each dot is an industry; dots above the line have a productivity gap (i.e., productivity growth has exceeded compensation growth), those below the line do not.&lt;ref name="BLS_Gap17"/&gt;]]

===Overall===
One view of economic equity is that employee compensation should rise with productivity (defined as real output per hour of labor worked).  In other words, if the employee produces more, they should be paid accordingly.  If pay lags behind productivity, income inequality grows, as labor's share of the output is falling, while capital's share (generally higher-income owners) is rising.
According to a June 2017 report from the non-partisan [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] (BLS), productivity rose in tandem with employee compensation (a measure which includes wages as well as benefits such as health insurance) from the 1940s through the 1970s.  However, since then productivity has grown faster than compensation.  BLS refers to this as the "productivity-compensation gap", an issue which has garnered much attention from academics and policymakers.&lt;ref name="BLS_Gap17"&gt;[https://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/volume-6/understanding-the-labor-productivity-and-compensation-gap.htm BLS-Understanding the Labor productivity and compensation gap-June 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2011/01/art3full.pdf BLS-Fleck, Glaser, and Sprague-Visual Essay: Compensation-Productivity Gap-January 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; BLS reported this gap occurs across most industries: "When examined at a detailed industry level, the average annual percent change in productivity outpaced compensation in 83 percent of 183 industries studied" measured from 1987-2015.&lt;ref name="BLS_Gap17"/&gt; 
For example, in the information industry, productivity increased at an annual average rate of 5.0% over the 1987-2015 period, while compensation increased at about a 1.5% rate, resulting in a 3.5% productivity gap.  In Manufacturing, the gap was 2.7%; in Retail Trade 2.6%; and in Transportation and Warehousing 1.3%. This analysis adjusted for inflation using the [[Consumer Price Index]] or CPI, a measure of inflation based on what is consumed, rather than what is produced.&lt;ref name="BLS_Gap17"/&gt;

===Analyzing the gap===
BLS explained the gap between productivity and compensation can be divided into two components, the effect of which varies by industry: 1) Recalculating the gap using an industry-specific inflation adjustment ("industry deflator") rather than consumption (CPI); and 2) The change in labor's share of income, defined as how much of a business' revenue goes to workers as opposed to intermediate purchases (i.e., cost of goods) and capital (owners) in that industry.&lt;ref name="BLS_Gap17"/&gt;
The difference in deflators was the stronger effect among high productivity growth industries, while the change in labor's share of income was the stronger effect among most other industries. For example, the 3.5% productivity gap in the information industry was composed of a 2.1% difference in deflators and about a 1.4% due to change in labor share. The 2.7% gap in Manufacturing included 1.0% due to deflator and 1.7% due to change in labor share.&lt;ref name="BLS_Gap17"/&gt;

===Reasons for the gap===
BLS explained the decline in labor share as likely driven by three factors that vary by industry:
*Globalization: Income that might have gone to domestic workers is going to foreign workers due to offshoring (i.e., production and service activities in other countries).
*Increased automation:  More automation means more share of income attributed to capital.
*Faster capital depreciation:  Information assets depreciate more rapidly than machinery; the latter were the greater share of the capital base in the past. This may require a higher capital share to generate income than in the past.&lt;ref name="BLS_Gap17"/&gt;

==Market factors==

===Globalization===

[[File:Income Shares of Top 1 Percent 1980 and 2000 - v1.png|thumb|right|350px|The bar chart compares pre-tax income shares of the top 1% in 13 developed countries for 1980 and 2000. The degree of change varied significantly, indicating country-specific policy factors also impact inequality.]]

[[Globalization]] refers to the integration of economies in terms of trade, information, and jobs. Innovations in [[supply chain management]] enabled goods to be sourced in Asia and shipped to the United States less expensively than in the past. This integration of economies, particularly with the U.S. and Asia, had dramatic impacts on income inequality globally.

Economist [[Branko Milanovic]] analyzed global income inequality, comparing 1988 and 2008. His analysis indicated that the global top 1% and the middle classes of the emerging economies (e.g., China, India, Indonesia, Brazil and Egypt) were the main winners of globalization during that time. The real (inflation adjusted) income of the global top 1% increased approximately 60%, while the middle classes of the emerging economies (those around the 50th percentile of the global income distribution in 1988) rose 70–80%. For example, in 2000, 5 million Chinese households earned between $11,500 and $43,000 in 2016 dollars. By 2015, 225 million did. On the other hand, those in the middle class of the developed world (those in the 75th to 90th percentile in 1988, such as the American middle class) experienced little real income gains. The richest 1% contains 60 million persons globally, including 30 million Americans (i.e., the top 12% of Americans by income were in the global top 1% in 2008), the most out of any country.&lt;ref name="heymancenter.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-06-27/the-left-and-right-stumble-on-globalization Bloomberg-Noah Smith-The Left and Right Stumble on Globalization-June 27, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/?ion=1&amp;espv=2#q=the+economist+225+m+reasons+for+China%27s+leaders+to+worry ''The Economist''. "225m reasons for China's leaders to worry" July 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

While economists who have studied globalization agree imports have had an effect, the timing of import growth does not match the growth of income inequality. By 1995 imports of manufactured goods from low-wage countries totalled less than 3% of US gross domestic product.&lt;ref name=trade&gt;[http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/the_great_divergence/features/2010/the_united_states_of_inequality/trade_didnt_create_inequality_and_then_it_did.html "The United States of Inequality, Entry 7: Trade Didn't Create Inequality, and Then It Did,"] by Timothy Noah (September 14, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

It wasn't until 2006 that the US imported more manufactured goods from low-wage (developing) countries than from high-wage (advanced) economies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.princeton.edu/~pkrugman/pk-bpea-draft.pdf "Trade and Wages, Reconsidered"], by Paul Krugman (February 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Inequality increased during the 2000–2010 decade not because of stagnating wages for less-skilled workers, but because of accelerating incomes of the top 0.1%.&lt;ref name=trade/&gt;  Author Timothy Noah estimates that "trade", increases in imports are responsible for just 10% of the "Great Divergence" in income distribution.&lt;ref name=education/&gt;

Journalist [[James Surowiecki]] notes that in the last 50 years, companies and the sectors of the economy providing the most employment in the US – major retailers, restaurant chains, and supermarkets – are ones with lower profit margins and less pricing power than in the 1960s; while sectors with high profit margins and average salaries – like high technology – have relatively few employees.&lt;ref name=low&gt;{{cite journal|last=Surowiecki|first=James|title=The Pay Is Too Damn Low|journal=The New Yorker|date=August 12, 2013|url=http://www.newyorker.com/talk/financial/2013/08/12/130812ta_talk_surowiecki}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some economists claim that it is [[World Trade Organization|WTO]]-led globalization and competition from developing countries, especially China, that has resulted in the recent decline in labor's share of income and increased unemployment in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Noah (January 6, 2014.).

''[[The Atlantic]].'' Retrieved January 10, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; And the [[Economic Policy Institute]] and the [[Center for Economic and Policy Research]] argue that some trade agreements such as the [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]] could result in further job losses and declining wages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epi.org/publication/trade-pacts-korus-trans-pacific-partnership/ No Jobs from Trade Pacts: The Trans-Pacific Partnership Could Be Much Worse than the Over-Hyped Korea Deal].

The Net Effect of the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement on U.S. Wages]. ''[[Center for Economic and Policy Research]]''. September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

One argument contrary to the globalization/technology hypothesis relates to variation across countries. Japan, Sweden and France did not experience significant increases in income inequality during the 1979–2010 period, although the U.S. did. The top 1% income group continued to receive less than 10% of the income share in these countries, while the U.S. share rose from 10% to over 20%. Economist [[Emmanuel Saez]] wrote in 2014: "Differences across countries rule out technical change/globalization as the sole explanation ... Policies play a key role in shaping inequality (tax and transfer policies, regulations, education)."&lt;ref&gt;[http://eml.berkeley.edu/~saez/lecture_saez_chicago14.pdf Emmanuel Saez-Income and Wealth Inequality:Evidence and Policy Implications-October 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Superstar hypothesis===
[[Eric Posner]] and [[Glen Weyl]] point out that inequality can be predominantly explained by the superstar hypothesis. In their opinion Piketty fails to observe the accelerated turnover that is occurring in the Forbes 400; only 35 people from the original 1982 list remain today. Many have fallen off as a result of heavy spending, large-scale philanthropy, and bad investments. The current Forbes 400 is now primarily made up of newly wealthy business owners, not heirs and heiresses.&lt;ref&gt;[https://newrepublic.com/article/118925/pikettys-capital-theory-misunderstands-inherited-wealth-today  Thomas Piketty Is Wrong: America Will Never Look Like a Jane Austen Novel, Eric Posner and Glen Weyl, New Republic], 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel research, the [[University of Chicago]]'s [[Steven Kaplan (economist)|Steven Kaplan]] and [[Stanford University]]'s Joshua Rauh note that 69% of those on the Forbes list are actually first generation wealth creators. That figure has risen dramatically since 1982 when it stood at 40%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/steven.kaplan/research/krtop.pdf  It’s the Market: The Broad-Based Rise in the Return to Top Talent Steven N. Kaplan and Joshua Rauh], 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ed Dolan]] supports the globalization and superstar hypothesis but points out that the high earnings are based, to some extent, on [[moral hazard]] like "Bonus-based compensation schemes with inadequate clawback for losses" and the shift of losses to shareholders, unsecured creditors, or taxpayers.&lt;ref&gt;Ed Dolan, [http://www.economonitor.com/dolanecon/2012/06/11/globalization-and-inequality-is-there-a-superstar-effect-and-if-so-what-does-it-mean/ Globalization and Inequality: Is there a Superstar Effect, and if so, What does it Mean?]&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Krugman argues that for the US the surge in inequality to date is mainly due to supersalaries but capital has nonetheless been significant too. And when the current generation of the 1% turn over their wealth to their heirs these become rentiers, people who live off accumulated capital. Two decades from now America could turn into a rentier-dominated society even more unequal than [[Belle Époque]] Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2014/may/08/thomas-piketty-new-gilded-age  "Why We're In A New Gilded Age", Paul Krugman, ''New York Review of Books''], May 8, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

One study extended the superstar hypothesis to corporations, with firms that are more dominant in their industry (in some cases due to oligopoly or monopoly) paying their workers far more than the average in the industry. Another study noted that "superstar firms" is another explanation for the decline in the overall share of income (GDP) going to workers/labor as opposed to owners/capital.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/16/upshot/the-amazon-walmart-showdown-that-explains-the-modern-economy.html?

{{main|Educational attainment in the United States}}

Income differences between the varying levels of educational attainment (usually measured by the highest degree of education an individual has completed) have increased. Expertise and skill certified through an academic degree  translates into increased scarcity of an individual's occupational qualification which in turn leads to greater economic rewards.&lt;ref name="Rhonda, L. (1998). ''Social Class and Stratification''. Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield." /&gt; As the United States has developed into a [[post-industrial society]] more and more employers require expertise that they did not a generation ago, while the manufacturing sector which employed many of those lacking a post-secondary education is decreasing in size.&lt;ref name="Zweig, M.

The "college premium" refers to the increase in income to workers with four-year college degrees relative to those without. The college premium doubled from 1980 to 2005, as the demand for college-educated workers has exceeded the supply. Economists Goldin and Katz estimate that the increase in economic returns to education was responsible for about 60% of the increase in wage inequality between 1973 and 2005. The supply of available graduates did not keep up with business demand due primarily to increasingly expensive college educations. Annual tuition at public and private universities averaged 4% and 20% respectively of the annual median family income from the 1950s to 1970s; by 2005 these figures were 10% and 45% as colleges raised prices in response to demand.&lt;ref name="Noah-GreatDivergence"/&gt; Economist David Autor wrote in 2014 that approximately two-thirds of the rise in income inequality between 1980 and 2005 was accounted for by the increased premium associated with education in general and post-secondary education in particular.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemagazinedigital.org/sciencemagazine/23_may_2014?pg=71#pg71 Science Magazine-David Autor-Skills, education and the rise of earnings inequality-May 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two researchers have suggested that children in low income families are exposed to 636 words an hour, as opposed to 2,153 words in high income families during the first four formative years of a child's development. This, in turn, led to low achievement in later schooling due to the inability of the low income group to verbalize concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first =Betty  |last = Hart |authorlink = |author2=Todd Risley |title = The Early Catastrophe |publisher = American Federation of Teachers  |year = 1995 |location =  |pages = |url =http://languagefix.wordpress.com/2008/09/30/4-the-hart-risley-30-million-word-gap-study/ |doi = |id = |issn=0148-432X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A psychologist has stated that society stigmatizes poverty. Conversely, poor people tend to believe that the wealthy have been lucky or have earned their money through illegal means. She believes that both attitudes need to be discarded if the nation is to make headway in addressing the issue of inequality. She suggests that college not be a litmus test of success; that valorizing of one profession as more important than another is a problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | first=Richard | last=Creaser | title=[[NECAP]] scores can illustrate achievement gap | url=| work= | newspaper=The Chronicle | location=Barton, Vermont | pages= 1A, 22A–24A | date=January 22, 2014 | id= | accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the mid- to late- decade of the 2000s, the most common explanation for income inequality in America was "skill-biased technological change" (SBTC) &lt;ref&gt;Jacob S. Hacker and Paul Pierson (2011) Winner-Take-All Politics: How Washington made the rich richer – and turned its back on the middle class.&lt;/ref&gt; – "a shift in the production technology that favors skilled over unskilled [[Labour economics|labor]] by increasing its relative [[productivity]] and, therefore, its relative [[Demand (economics)|demand]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_S000493 Dictionary of economics online]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one scholarly colloquium on the subject that included many prominent labor economists estimated that technological change was responsible for over 40% of the increase in inequality. Other factors like international trade, decline in real minimum wage, decline in unionization and rising immigration, were each responsible for 10–15% of the increase.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umsl.edu/services/govdocs/erp/1997/chap5.htm Economic Report of the President 1997] mentions "colloquium on this topic at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York" (1995?)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umsl.edu/services/govdocs/erp/1997/box5-3.gif Experts' Consensus on Earnings Inequality].

Education has a notable influence on income distribution.&lt;ref name="New York Times. (June 7, 2007). The Rewards of Education" /&gt; In 2005, roughly 55% of income earners with doctorate degrees – the most educated 1.4% – were among the top 15 percent earners. Among those with Master's degrees – the most educated 10% – roughly half had incomes among the top 20 percent of earners.&lt;ref name="US Census Bureau. (2006).

Selected Characteristics of Households, by Total Money Income in 2005." /&gt;

But while the higher education commonly translates into higher income,&lt;ref name="New York Times. (June 7, 2007). The Rewards of Education"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2007/06/09/magazine/10payne.graphic.ready.html|title=New York Times. (June 7, 2007).

From 2000 to 2010, the 1.5% of Americans with an M.D., J.D., or M.B.A. and the 1.5% with a PhD saw median income gains of approximately 5%. Among those with a college or master's degree (about 25% of the American workforce) average wages dropped by about 7%, (though this was less than the decline in wages for those who had not completed college).&lt;ref&gt;[http://globalpublicsquare.blogs.cnn.com/2011/09/20/only-advanced-degree-holders-saw-wage-gains-in-last-decade/?iref=obinsite CNN-Travis Waldon-Only Advanced Degree Holders Saw Wage Gains in the Past Decade]&lt;/ref&gt; Post-2000 data has provided "little evidence" for SBTC's role in increasing inequality. The wage premium for college  educated has risen little and there has been little shift in shares of employment to more highly skilled occupations.&lt;ref name=BERNSTEIN&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bernstein|first=Jared|title=Inequality's Roots: Beyond Technology|journal=New York Times|date=November 18, 2013|url=https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/18/inequalitys-roots-beyond-technology/?src=recg&amp;_r=0|accessdate=November 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approaching the issue from occupations that have been replaced or downgraded since the late 1970s, one scholar found that jobs that "require some thinking but not a lot" – or moderately skilled middle-class occupations such as cashiers, typists, welders, farmers, appliance repairmen – declined the furthest in wage rates and/or numbers. Employment requiring either more skill or less has been less affected.&lt;ref name=computers&gt;[http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/the_great_divergence/features/2010/the_united_states_of_inequality/did_computers_create_inequality.html "The United States of Inequality, Entry 4: Did Computers Create Inequality?"] by Timothy Noah, ''Slate'' (September 8, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; However the timing of the great technological change of the era – internet use by business starting in the late 1990s – does not match that of the growth of income inequality (starting in the early 1970s but slackening somewhat in the 1990s). Nor does the introduction of technologies that increase the demand for more skilled workers seem to be generally associated with a divergence in household income among the population. Inventions of the 20th century such as [[Alternating current|AC electric power]], the automobile, airplane, radio, television, the washing machine, Xerox machine, each had an economic impact similar to computers, microprocessors and internet, but did not coincide with greater inequality.&lt;ref name=computers/&gt;

Another explanation is that the ''combination'' of the introduction of technologies that increase the demand for skilled workers, ''and'' the failure of the American education system to provide a sufficient increase in those skilled workers has bid up those workers' salaries. An example of the slowdown in education growth in America (that began about the same time as the Great Divergence began) is the fact that the average person born in 1945 received two more years of schooling than his parents, while the average person born in 1975 received only half a year more of schooling.&lt;ref name=education&gt;[http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/the_great_divergence/features/2010/the_united_states_of_inequality/how_the_decline_in_k12_education_enriches_college_graduates.html "The United States of Inequality. Entry 9: How the Decline in K–12 Education Enriches College Graduates,"] by Timothy Noah, ''Slate.com'' (September 15, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;  Author Timothy Noah's "back-of-the-envelope" estimation based on "composite of my discussions with and reading of the various economists and political scientists" is that the "various failures" in America's  education system are "responsible for 30%" of the post-1978 increase in inequality.&lt;ref name=education/&gt;

===Race and gender disparities===
[[File:Income inequity US.png|thumb|350px|Median personal income by gender and race in 2005.]]
{{further|Gender pay gap in the United States|Racial wage gap in the United States}}

Income levels vary by gender and race with median income levels considerably below the national median for females compared to men with certain racial demographics.&lt;ref name="US Census Bureau.

Despite considerable progress in pursuing gender and racial equality, some social scientists like Richard Schaeffer attribute these discrepancies in income partly to continued discrimination.&lt;ref name="Schaefer, R. T. (2005). ''Racial and Ethnic Groups''. New York, NY: Prentice Hall."&gt;{{cite book|last = Schaeffer|first=Richard|year=2005|title=Racial and Ethnic Groups|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=New York, NY|id=013192897X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among women, part of the wage gap is due to employment choices and preferences. Women are more likely to consider factors other than salary when looking for employment. On average, women are less willing to travel or relocate, take more hours off and work fewer hours, and choose college majors that lead to lower paying jobs. Women are also more likely to work for governments or non-profits which pay less than the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/02/AR2007040201262.html | work=The Washington Post | title=A Bargain At 77 Cents To a Dollar | first=Carrie | last=Lukas | date=April 3, 2007 | accessdate=May 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://reason.com/news/show/119920.html The Truth About the Pay Gap: Feminist politics and bad economics – Reason Magazine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
According to this perspective certain ethnic minorities and women receive fewer promotions and opportunities for occupation and economic advancement than others. In the case of women this concept is referred to as the [[glass ceiling]] keeping women from climbing the occupational ladder.

===Stock buybacks===
Writing in the ''Harvard Business Review'' in September 2014, William Lazonick blamed record corporate stock buybacks for reduced investment in the economy and a corresponding impact on prosperity and income inequality.  Between 2003 and 2012, the 449 companies in the S&amp;P 500 used 54% of their earnings ($2.4 trillion) to buy back their own stock.  An additional 37% was paid to stockholders as dividends. Together, these were 91% of profits. This left little for investment in productive capabilities or higher income for employees, shifting more income to capital rather than labor.  He blamed executive compensation arrangements, which are heavily based on stock options, stock awards and bonuses for meeting earnings per share (EPS) targets (EPS increases as the number of outstanding shares decreases). Restrictions on buybacks were greatly eased in the early 1980s. He advocates changing these incentives to limit buybacks.&lt;ref&gt;[https://hbr.org/2014/09/profits-without-prosperity/ar/1 Harvard Business Review-William Lazonick-Profits without Prosperity-September 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. companies are projected to increase buybacks to $701 billion in 2015 according to Goldman Sachs, an 18% increase over 2014. For scale, annual non-residential fixed investment (a proxy for business investment and a major GDP component) was estimated to be about $2.1 trillion for 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/national/gdp/2014/txt/gdp3q14_adv.txt BEA-GDP Press Release-Q3 2014 "Advance Estimate".

U.S. income inequality is comparable to other developed nations pre-tax, but is among the worst after-tax and transfers. This indicates the U.S. tax policies redistribute income from higher income to lower income households relatively less than other developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/american-inequality-in-six-charts New Yorker-John Cassidy-American Income Inequality in Six Charts-November 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Timothy Noah]] summarized the results of several studies his 2012 book ''The Great Divergence'':
*Economists Piketty and Saez reported in 2007, that U.S. taxes on the rich had declined over the 1979–2004 period, contributing to increasing after-tax income inequality. While dramatic reductions in the top marginal income tax rate contributed somewhat to worsening inequality, other changes to the tax code (e.g., corporate, capital gains, estate, and gift taxes) had more significant impact. Considering all federal taxes, including the payroll tax, the effective tax rate on the top 0.01% fell dramatically, from 59.3% in 1979 to 34.7% in 2004. CBO reported an effective tax rate decline from 42.9% in 1979 to 32.3% in 2004 for the top 0.01%, using a different income measurement. In other words, the effective tax rate on the very highest income taxpayers fell by about one-quarter.
*CBO estimated that the combined effect of federal taxes and government transfers reduced income inequality (as measured by the Gini Index) by 23% in 1979. By 2007, the combined effect was to reduce income inequality by 17%. So the tax code remained progressive, only less so.
*While pre-tax income is the primary driver of income inequality, the less progressive tax code further increased the share of after-tax income going to the highest income groups. For example, had these tax changes not occurred, the after-tax income share of the top 0.1% would have been approximately 4.5% in 2000 instead of the 7.3% actual figure.&lt;ref name="Noah-GreatDivergence"&gt;{{cite book

A key factor in income inequality/equality is the effective rate at which [[income tax|income is taxed]] coupled with the [[progressive tax|progressivity]] of the tax system. A [[progressive tax]] is a tax in which the effective [[tax rate]] increases as the taxable base amount increases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Progressive Webster] (4b): increasing in rate as the base increases (a progressive tax)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/61/69/P0586900.html American Heritage] (6).

Madeo, Kenneth E. Anderson, Betty R. Jackson (1992), ''Concepts of Taxation'', Dryden Press: Fort Worth, TX&lt;/ref&gt; Overall income tax rates in the U.S. are below the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] average, and until 2005 have been declining.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books|id=3WvmeZ2BbRsC|page=104}} OECD Publishing, {{ISBN|978-92-64-04418-0}}, 2008, pp. 103, 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

How much tax policy change over the last thirty years has contributed to income inequality is disputed. In their comprehensive 2011 study of income inequality (''Trends in the Distribution of Household Income Between 1979 and 2007''),&lt;ref name="cbo.p.20"&gt;[http://www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=12485 Congressional Budget Office: Trends in the Distribution of Household Income Between 1979 and 2007]. October 2011. p. 20 and figure 12.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Congressional Budget Office|CBO]] found that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The top fifth of the population saw a 10-percentage-point increase in their share of after-tax income. Most of that growth went to the top 1 percent of the population. All other groups saw their shares decline by 2 to 3 percentage points. In 2007, federal taxes and transfers reduced the dispersion of income by 20 percent, but that equalizing effect was larger in 1979. The share of transfer payments to the lowest-income households declined. The overall average federal tax rate fell.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, a more recent CBO analysis indicates that with changes to 2013 tax law (e.g., the expiration of the 2001-2003 [[Bush tax cuts]] for top earners and the increased payroll taxes passed as part of the [[Affordable Care Act]]), the effective federal tax rates for the highest earning household will increase to levels not seen since 1979.&lt;ref name = "CBO 2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cbo.gov/publication/44604 |title=The Distribution of Household Income and Federal Taxes, 2010 |publisher=The US Congressional Budget Office (CBO) |date=December 4, 2013 |accessdate=January 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to journalist Timothy Noah, "you can't really demonstrate that U.S. tax policy had a large impact on the three-decade income inequality trend one way or the other. The inequality trend for pre-tax income during this period was much more dramatic."&lt;ref name="slate.com"/&gt; Noah estimates tax changes account for 5% of the Great Divergence.&lt;ref name=education/&gt;

But many – such as economist [[Paul Krugman]] – emphasize the effect of changes in taxation – such as the 2001 and 2003 [[Bush Tax Cuts|Bush administration tax cuts]] which cut taxes far more for high-income households than those below – on increased income inequality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbpp.org/cms/?fa=view&amp;id=957 "New CBO Data Show Income Inequality Continues to Widen After-Tax-Income for Top 1 Percent Rose by $146,000 in 2004,"] by Aviva Aron-Dine and Arloc Sherman, ''Center on Budget and Policy Priorities'' (January 23, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the growth of income inequality under Republican administrations (described by Larry Bartels) has been attributed to tax policy.  A study by Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez found that "large reductions in tax [[progressive tax|progressivity]] since the 1960s took place primarily during two periods: the Reagan presidency in the 1980s and the Bush administration in the early 2000s."&lt;ref&gt;[http://elsa.berkeley.edu/~saez/piketty-saezJEP07taxprog.pdf How Progressive is the U.S. Federal Tax System? A Historical and International Perspective] Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

During Republican President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s tenure in office the top marginal income tax rate was reduced from over 70 to 28 percent, high top marginal rates like 70% being the sort in place during much of the period of great income equality following the "Great Compression".&lt;ref name="slate.com"&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/2266025/entry/2266030/ Noah, Timothy. "Can We Blame Income Inequality on Republicans"] in the multi-part series "The United States of Inequality." ''Slate'', September 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  The lowest marginal rate for the bottom fell from 14 to 11 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Silliman, B. R. (2008). Will the next president reform the tax code?

''PBS NewsHour'' (Dec. 12, 2011.) Retrieved on 2013-07-29.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taxes on capital===
[[File:U.S. economic variables related to the distribution of wealth and income.png|thumb|right|400px|Selected economic variables related to wealth and income equality, comparing 1979, 2007, and 2015.]]
Taxes on income derived from capital (e.g., financial assets, property and businesses) primarily affect higher income groups, who own the vast majority of capital. For example, in 2010 approximately 81% of stocks were owned by the top 10% income group and 69% by the top 5%. Only about one-third of American households have stock holdings more than $7,000. Therefore, since higher-income taxpayers have a much higher share of their income represented by capital gains, lowering taxes on capital income and gains increases after-tax income inequality.&lt;ref name="Noah-GreatDivergence"/&gt;

Capital gains taxes were reduced around the time income inequality began to rise again around 1980 and several times thereafter. During 1978 under President Carter, the top capital gains tax rate was reduced from 49% to 28%. President Ronald Reagan's 1981 cut in the top rate on unearned income reduced the maximum capital gains rate to only 20% – its lowest level since the Hoover administration, as part of an overall economic growth strategy. The capital gains tax rate was also reduced by President Bill Clinton in 1997, from 28% to 20%. President George W. Bush reduced the tax rate on capital gains and qualifying dividends from 20% to 15%, less than half the 35% top rate on ordinary income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/18/us/politics/for-wealthy-tax-cuts-since-1980s-have-been-gain-gain.html?_r=1 | work=New York Times | title=Since 1980s, the Kindest of Tax Cuts for the Rich | date=January 18, 2012 | accessdate=January 21, 2012 | first1=David | last1=Kocieniewski}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CBO reported in August 1990 that: "Of the 8 studies reviewed, five, including the two CBO studies, found that cutting taxes on capital gains is not likely to increase savings, investment, or GNP much if at all." Some of the studies indicated the loss in revenue from lowering the tax rate may be offset by higher economic growth, others did not.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/90-cbo-033.pdf CBO "Effect of Lower Capital Gains Taxes on Economic Growth" August 1990]&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalist [[Timothy Noah]] wrote in 2012 that: "Every one of these changes elevated the financial interests of business owners and stockholders above the well-being, financial or otherwise, or ordinary citizens."&lt;ref name="Noah-GreatDivergence"/&gt; So overall, while cutting capital gains taxes adversely affects income inequality, its economic benefits are debatable.

===Other tax policies===
Rising inequality has also been attributed to President Bush's veto of tax harmonization, as this would have prohibited offshore tax havens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/how-the-gop-became-the-party-of-the-rich-20111109 | work=Rolling Stone | title=How the GOP Became the Party of the Rich | date=November 9, 2011 | accessdate=January 2, 2012 | first1=Tom | last1=Dickinson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Debate over effects of tax policies===
One study&lt;ref name=howprogressive/&gt; found reductions of total effective tax rates were most significant for individuals with highest incomes. (see "Federal Tax Rate by Income Group" chart) For those with incomes in the top 0.01 percent, overall rates of Federal tax fell from 74.6% in 1970, to 34.7% in 2004 (the reversal of the trend in 2000 with a rise to 40.8% came after the [[Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993|1993 Clinton deficit reduction tax bill]]), the next 0.09 percent falling from 59.1% to 34.1%, before leveling off with a relatively modest drop of 41.4 to 33.0% for the 99.5–99.9 percent group. Although the tax rate for low-income earners fell as well (though not as much), these tax reductions compare with virtually no change – 23.3% tax rate in 1970, 23.4% in 2004 – for the US population overall.&lt;ref name=howprogressive/&gt;

The study found the decline in progressivity since 1960 was due to the shift from allocation of corporate income taxes among labor and capital to the effects of the individual income tax.&lt;ref name=howprogressive&gt;Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez, [http://elsa.berkeley.edu/%7Esaez/piketty-saezJEP07taxprog.pdf "How Progressive is the U.S. Federal Tax System? A Historical and International Perspective"]. ''Journal of Economic Perspectives'' Volume 21, Number 1 – Winter 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Even after exploiting all possible deductions and credits, the typical high-income taxpayer during the Great Prosperity paid a federal tax of well over 50 percent of his earnings." Clinton Administration Secretary of labor [[Robert Reich]] In his book ''Aftershock: The Next Economy and America's Future''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Krugman]] also supports this claim saying, "The overall tax rate on these high income families fell from 36.5% in 1980 to 26.7% in 1989."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Peddling Prosperity: Economic Sense and Nonsense in an Age of Diminished Expectations |last=Krugman |first=Paul |authorlink= Paul Krugman |year=1995 |publisher=W.

From the White House's own analysis, the federal tax burden for those making greater than $250,000 fell considerably during the late 1980s, 1990s and 2000s, from an effective tax of 35% in 1980, down to under 30% from the late 1980s to 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.factcheck.org/2011/04/factchecking-obamas-budget-speech/ | work=FactCheck.org | title=FactChecking Obama's Budget Speech |date=April 15, 2011 | accessdate=January 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many studies argue that tax changes of [[S corporations]] confound the statistics prior to 1990.  However, even after these changes inflation-adjusted average after-tax income grew by 25% between 1996 and 2006 (the last year for which individual income tax data is publicly available). This average increase, however, obscures a great deal of variation. The poorest 20% of tax filers experienced a 6% reduction in income while the top 0.1 percent of tax filers saw their income almost double. Tax filers in the middle
of the income distribution experienced about a 10% increase in income. Also during this period, the proportion of income from capital increased for the top 0.1 percent from 64% to 70%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://taxprof.typepad.com/files/crs-1.pdf  Thomas L. Hungerford "Changes in the Distribution of Income Among Tax Filers Between 1996 and 2006: The Role of Labor Income, Capital Income, and Tax Policy."]  Congressional Research Service, December 29, 2011.  http://taxprof.typepad.com/files/crs-1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transfer payments===
Transfer payments refer to payments to persons such as social security, unemployment compensation, or welfare.  CBO reported in November 2014 that: "Government transfers reduce income inequality because the transfers received by lower-income households are larger relative to their market income than are the transfers received by higher-income households. Federal taxes also reduce income inequality, because the taxes paid by higher-income households are larger relative to their before-tax income than are the taxes paid by lower-income households. The equalizing effects of government transfers were significantly larger than the equalizing effects of federal taxes from 1979 to 2011.&lt;ref name="CBOInc&amp;Tax2014"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Distribution of Household Income and Federal Taxes 2011|publisher=Congressional Budget Office, US Government|date=November 2014|url=https://www.cbo.gov/publication/49440}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CBO also reported that less progressive tax and transfer policies have contributed to greater after-tax income inequality: "As a result of the diminishing effect of transfers and federal taxes, the Gini index for income after transfers and federal taxes grew by more than the index for market income. Between 1979 and 2007, the Gini index for market income increased by 23 percent, the index for market income after transfers increased by 29 percent, and the index for income measured after transfers and federal taxes increased by 33 percent."&lt;ref name="CBOInc&amp;Tax2014"/&gt;

===Tax expenditures===
[[File:CBO tax expenditures panel v1.png|thumb|right|400px|CBO charts describing amount and distribution of top 10 tax expenditures (i.e., exemptions, deductions, and preferential rates)]]
Tax expenditures (i.e., exclusions, deductions, preferential tax rates, and tax credits) cause revenues to be much lower than they would otherwise be for any given tax rate structure. The benefits from tax expenditures, such as income exclusions for healthcare insurance premiums paid for by employers and tax deductions for mortgage interest, are distributed unevenly across the income spectrum. They are often what the Congress offers to special interests in exchange for their support. According to a report from the CBO that analyzed the 2013 data:
*The top 10 tax expenditures totalled $900 billion. This is a proxy for how much they reduced revenues or increased the annual budget deficit.
*Tax expenditures tend to benefit those at the top and bottom of the income distribution, but less so in the middle. 
*The top 20% of income earners received approximately 50% of the benefit from them; the top 1% received 17% of the benefits. 
*The largest single tax expenditure was the exclusion from income of employer sponsored health insurance ($250 billion).
*Preferential tax rates on capital gains and dividends were $160 billion; the top 1% received 68% of the benefit or $109 billion from lower income tax rates on these types of income. 
Understanding how each tax expenditure is distributed across the income spectrum can inform policy choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/richest-20-percent-get-half-the-overall-savings-from-tax-breaks-cbo-says/2013/05/29/645f75c6-c894-11e2-9245-773c0123c027_story.html|title=Richest 20 percent get half the overall savings from U.S. tax breaks, CBO says|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbo.gov/publication/43768|title=The Distribution of Major Tax Expenditures in the Individual Income Tax System|publisher=CBO|date=May 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other causes==

===Shifts in political power===
[[Paul Krugman]] wrote in 2015 that: "Economists struggling to make sense of economic polarization are, increasingly, talking not about technology but about power." This market power hypothesis basically asserts that market power has concentrated in [[monopolies]] and [[oligopolies]] that enable unusual amounts of income ("[[rent-seeking|rents]]") to be transferred from the many consumers to relatively few owners. This hypothesis is consistent with higher corporate profits without a commensurate rise in investment, as firms facing less competition choose to pass a greater share of their profits to shareholders (such as through share buybacks and dividends) rather than re-invest in the business to ward off competitors.&lt;ref name="KrugmanReich2015"&gt;[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2015/12/17/robert-reich-challenging-oligarchy/ Krugman-NYT Review of Books-Challenging the Oligarchy-December 17, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
One cause of this concentration of market power was the rightward shift in American politics toward more conservative policies since 1980, as politics plays a big role in how market power can be exercised. Policies that removed barriers to monopoly and oligopoly included anti-union laws, reduced anti-trust activity, deregulation (or failure to regulate) non-depository banking, contract laws that favored creditors over debtors, etc. Further, rising wealth concentration can be used to purchase political influence, creating a feedback loop.&lt;ref name="KrugmanReich2015"/&gt;

===Decline of unions===

[[File:Union membership in us 1930-2010.png|thumb|400px|Union membership in the United States from the [[Great Depression]] to current day.

The era of inequality growth has coincided with a dramatic decline in labor union membership from 20% of the labor force in 1983 to about 12% in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/union2_01252008.pdf "Union Members in 2007"], US Bureau of Labor Statistics, January 25, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Classical and neoclassical economists have traditionally thought that since the chief purpose of a union is to maximize the income of its members, a strong but not all-encompassing union movement would lead to increased income inequality. However, given the increase in income inequality of the past few decades, either the sign of the effect must be reversed, or the magnitude of the effect must be small and a much larger opposing force has overridden it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/795051657054800g/ "Unions and wage inequality"], by David Card, [[Thomas Lemieux]] and W.

Moreover, weaker unions can reduce workers' influence on corporate decisions that benefit top earners, such as the size and structure of top executive compensation."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hiltzik (March 25, 2015).

===Political parties and presidents===
Liberal political scientist [[Larry Bartels]] has found a strong correlation between the party of the president and  income inequality in America since 1948. (see below)&lt;ref name="Bartels"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kelly"&gt;Kelly, N.J. (2009). ''The Politics of Income Inequality in the United States''. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Examining average annual pre-tax income growth from 1948 to 2005 (which encompassed most of the egalitarian [[Great Compression]] and the entire inegalitarian Great Divergence)&lt;ref&gt;''Unequal Democracy: The Political Economy of the New Gilded Age'' by Larry Bartels (Princeton University Press: 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Bartels shows that under Democratic presidents (from [[Harry Truman]] forward), the greatest income gains have been at the bottom of the income scale and tapered off as income rose. Under Republican presidents, in contrast, gains were much less but what growth there was concentrated towards the top, tapering off as you went down the income scale.&lt;ref name=Ryan&gt;[http://www.tnr.com/blog/timothy-noah/97619/paul-ryan-inequality-take-two Paul Ryan: Inequality, Take Two], Timothy Noah, ''The New Republic'', November 18, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://visualeconsite.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/Slate_IncomeSlides-05.png Income Growth Rates 1948–2005] under Democratic presidents and under Republican presidents. Graphics by Catherine Mulbrandon&lt;/ref&gt;

Summarizing Bartels's findings, journalist [[Timothy Noah]] referred to the administrations of Democratic presidents as "Democrat-world", and GOP administrations as "Republican-world":

{{quote|In Democrat-world, pre-tax income increased 2.64% annually for the poor and lower-middle-class and 2.12% annually for the upper-middle-class and rich. There was no Great Divergence. Instead, the Great Compression – the egalitarian income trend that prevailed through the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s – continued to the present, albeit with incomes converging less rapidly than before. In Republican-world, meanwhile, pre-tax income increased 0.43 percent annually for the poor and lower-middle-class and 1.90 percent for the upper-middle-class and rich. Not only did the Great Divergence occur; it was more greatly divergent. Also of note: In Democrat-world pre-tax income increased faster than in the real world not just for the 20th percentile but also for the 40th, 60th, and 80th. We were all richer and more equal! But in Republican-world, pre-tax income increased slower than in the real world not just for the 20th percentile but also for the 40th, 60th, and 80th. We were all poorer and less equal! Democrats also produced marginally faster income growth than Republicans at the 95th percentile, but the difference wasn't statistically significant.&lt;ref name="slate.com"/&gt;}}

The pattern of distribution of growth appears to be the result of a whole host of policies,

&lt;blockquote&gt;including not only the distribution of taxes and benefits but also the government's stance toward unions, whether the minimum wage rises, the extent to which the government frets about inflation versus too-high interest rates, etc., etc.&lt;ref name=Ryan/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Noah admits the evidence of this correlation is "circumstantial rather than direct", but so is "the evidence that smoking is a leading cause of lung cancer."&lt;ref name="slate.com"/&gt;

In his 2017 book ''The Great Leveler'', historian [[Walter Scheidel]] point out that, starting in the 1970s, both parties shifted towards promoting [[free market]] [[capitalism]], with Republicans moving further to the political right than Democrats to the political left. He notes that Democrats have been instrumental in the financial deregulation of the 1990s and have largely neglected social welfare issues while increasingly focusing on issues pertaining to [[identity politics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =  Scheidel| first = Walter | author-link =Walter Scheidel| title =The Great Leveler: Violence and the History of Inequality from the Stone Age to the Twenty-First Century | publisher = Princeton University Press| location =| year =2017  | isbn =978-0691165028|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=NgZpDQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA416#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 416]|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10921.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Clinton Administration in particular continued promoting free market, or [[neoliberal]], reforms which began under the Reagan Administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last= Springer|editor1-first=Simon |editor2-last= Birch|editor2-first=Kean |editor3-last= MacLeavy|editor3-first=Julie|date=2016 |title=The Handbook of Neoliberalism|url=https://www.routledge.com/The-Handbook-of-Neoliberalism/Springer-Birch-MacLeavy/p/book/9781138844001|location= |publisher=[[Routledge]] |page= [https://books.google.com/books?id=M5qkDAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA144#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 144] |isbn=978-1138844001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nikolaos Karagiannis, Zagros Madjd-Sadjadi, Swapan Sen (eds).

According to political scientists Jacob Hacker and Paul Pierson writing in the book [[Winner-Take-All Politics (book)|Winner-Take-All Politics]], the important policy shifts were brought on not by the Republican Party but by the development of a modern, efficient political system, especially [[lobbying]], by top earners – and particularly corporate executives and the financial services industry.&lt;ref&gt;''Winner-Take-All Politics'', p.7&lt;/ref&gt; The end of the 1970s saw a transformation of American politics away from a focus on the middle class, with new, much more effective, aggressive  and well-financed lobbyists and pressure groups acting on behalf of upper income groups.  [[Executive pay in the United States#Criticism|Executives]] successfully eliminated any countervailing power or oversight of corporate managers (from private litigation, boards of directors and shareholders, the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] or labor unions).&lt;ref&gt;''Winner-Take-All Politics'', pp. 115, 219, 228&lt;/ref&gt;

The financial industry's success came from successfully pushing for deregulation of financial markets, allowing much more lucrative but much more risky investments from which it privatized the gains while socializing the losses with government bailouts.&lt;ref&gt;''Winner-Take-All Politics'',  p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;  (the two groups formed about 60% of the top 0.1 percent of earners.) All top earners were helped by deep cuts in estate and capital gains taxes, and tax rates on high levels of income.

Arguing against the proposition that the explosion in pay for corporate executives – which grew from 35X average worker pay in 1978 to over 250X average pay before the 2007 recession&lt;ref&gt;[http://stateofworkingamerica.org/charts/ratio-of-average-ceo-total-direct-compensation-to-average-production-worker-compensation-1965-2009/ More compensation heading for the very top] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904220428/http://stateofworkingamerica.org/charts/ratio-of-average-ceo-total-direct-compensation-to-average-production-worker-compensation-1965-2009/ |date=2012-09-04 }} EPI 2010&lt;/ref&gt; – is driven by an increased demand for scarce talent and set according to performance, Krugman points out that multiple factors outside of executives' control govern corporate profitability, particularly in short term when the head of a company like [[Enron]] may look like a great success. Further, corporate boards follow other companies in setting pay even if the directors themselves disagree with lavish pay "partly to attract executives whom they consider adequate, partly because the financial market will be suspicious of a company whose CEO isn't lavishly paid." Finally "corporate boards, largely selected by the CEO, hire compensation experts, almost always chosen by the CEO" who naturally want to please their employers.&lt;ref&gt;Krugman, Paul, ''The Conscience of a Liberal'',  W W Norton &amp; Company, 2007, pp. 143–44&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucian Arye Bebchuk, Jesse M. Fried, the authors of ''Pay Without Performance'', critique of [[executive pay]], argue that executive capture of corporate governance is so complete that only public relations, i.e. public `outrage`, constrains their pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{google books|id=JDDnbxaleNsC}} By Lucian Arye Bebchuk, Jesse M. Fried]&lt;/ref&gt; This in turn has been reduced as traditional critics of excessive pay – such as politicians (where need for campaign contributions from the richest outweighs populist indignation), media (lauding business genius), unions (crushed) – are now silent.&lt;ref&gt;Krugman, ''The Conscience of a Liberal'', 2007, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to politics, Krugman postulated change in norms of corporate culture have played a factor. In the 1950s and 60s, corporate executives had (or could develop) the ability to pay themselves very high compensation through control of corporate boards of directors, they restrained themselves. But by the end of the 1990s, the average real annual compensation of the top 100 C.E.O.'s skyrocketed from $1.3 million – 39 times the pay of an average worker – to $37.5 million, more than 1,000 times the pay of ordinary workers from 1982 to 2002.&lt;ref name="Richer"/&gt;  Journalist [[George Packer]] also sees the dramatic increase in inequality in America as a product of the change in attitude of the American elite, which (in his view) has been transitioning itself from pillars of society to a special interest group.&lt;ref name=Packer&gt;"The Broken Contract", By George Packer, ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'', November/December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  Author Timothy Noah estimates that what he calls "Wall Street and corporate boards' pampering" of the highest earning 0.1% is "responsible for 30%" of the post-1978 increase in inequality.&lt;ref name=education/&gt;

===Immigration===
[[File:Chart of foreign born in the US labor force 1900 to 2007.png|thumb|right|Foreign-born in US labor force 1900-2015]]
The [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]] increased immigration to America, especially of non-Europeans.&lt;ref name=Divergence/&gt;  From 1970 to 2007, the foreign-born proportion of America's population grew from 5% to 11%, most of whom had lower education levels and incomes than native-born Americans. But the contribution of this increase in supply of low-skill labor seem to have been relatively modest. One estimate stated that immigration reduced the average annual income of native-born "high-school dropouts" ("who roughly correspond to the poorest tenth of the workforce") by 7.4% from 1980 to 2000. The decline in income of better educated workers was much less.&lt;ref name=Divergence/&gt; Author Timothy Noah estimates that "immigration" is responsible for just 5% of the "Great Divergence" in income distribution,&lt;ref name=education/&gt; as does economist [[David Card]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://davidcard.berkeley.edu/papers/wimmig%20inequ.pdf Economist David Card-NBER Working Paper-Immigration and Inequality-2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

While immigration was found to have slightly depressed the wages of the least skilled and least educated American workers, it doesn't explain rising inequality among high school and college graduates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/the_great_divergence/features/2010/the_united_states_of_inequality/did_immigration_create_the_great_divergence.html "The United States of Inequality: Did the post-1965 immigration surge cause the Great Divergence?"] by Timothy Noah (September 7, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars such as political scientists [[Jacob S. Hacker]], [[Paul Pierson]], [[Larry Bartels]] and Nathan Kelly, and economist Timothy Smeeding question the explanation of educational attainment and workplace skills point out that other countries with similar education levels and economies have not gone the way of the US, and that the concentration of income in the US hasn't followed a pattern of "the 29% of Americans with college degrees pulling away" from those who have less education.&lt;ref name="Weeks"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bartels"&gt;Bartels, L.

===Wage theft===
A September 2014 report by the Economic Policy Institute claims [[wage theft]] is also responsible for exacerbating income inequality: "Survey evidence suggests that wage theft is widespread and costs workers billions of dollars a year, a transfer from low-income employees to business owners that worsens income inequality, hurts workers and their families, and damages the sense of fairness and justice that a democracy needs to survive."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epi.org/publication/epidemic-wage-theft-costing-workers-hundreds/ An Epidemic of Wage Theft Is Costing Workers Hundreds of Millions of Dollars a Year].

=== Corporatism ===

[[Edmund Phelps]], published an analysis in 2010 theorizing that the cause of income inequality is not free market capitalism, but instead is the result of the rise of [[corporatism]].&lt;ref name="columbia.edu"&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/~esp2/Critical%20Review%20Piece.pdf  Capitalism vs Corporatism - Edmund Phelps] ''[[Columbia University]].'' January 11, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Corporatism, in his view, is the antithesis of free market capitalism.  It is characterized by semi-monopolistic organizations and banks, big employer confederations, often acting with complicit state institutions in ways that discourage (or block) the natural workings of a free economy.  The primary effects of corporatism are the consolidation of economic power and wealth with end results being the attrition of entrepreneurial and free market dynamism.

His follow-up book, ''Mass Flourishing'', further defines corporatism by the following attributes: power-sharing between government and large corporations (exemplified in the U.S. by widening government power in areas such as financial services, healthcare, and energy through regulation), an expansion of corporate lobbying and campaign support in exchange for government reciprocity, escalation in the growth and influence of financial and banking sectors, increased consolidation of the corporate landscape through merger and acquisition (with ensuing increases in corporate executive compensation), increased potential for corporate/government corruption and malfeasance, and a lack of entrepreneurial and small business development leading to lethargic and stagnant economic conditions.&lt;ref name="Princeton University Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Phelps|first1=Edmund|title=Mass Flourishing: How Grassroots Innovation Created Jobs, Challenge, and Change|date=August 25, 2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0691158983|pages=392|edition=1st|url=https://www.amazon.com/Mass-Flourishing-Grassroots-Innovation-Challenge/dp/0691158983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887324549004579066790248178438  Mass Flourishing Book Review, Edward Glaeser, Wall Street Journal, October 18, 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, in the United States, virtually all of these economic conditions are being borne out.  With regard to income inequality, the 2014 income analysis of [[University of California, Berkeley]] economist [[Emmanuel Saez]] confirms that relative growth of income and wealth is not occurring among small and mid-sized entrepreneurs and business owners (who generally populate the lower half of top one per-centers in income),&lt;ref&gt;[https://thecfoalliance.org/documents/CFO_Alliance_Executive_Compensation_Survey_Presentation_Final_1_10_2013.pdf  The CFO Alliance Executive Compensation Survey 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; but instead only among the top .1 percent of income distribution ... whom Paul Krugman describes as "super-elites - corporate bigwigs and financial wheeler-dealers."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/25/opinion/we-are-the-99-9.html?_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;ref=opinion&amp;adxnnlx=1413381816-Gy6K3nXHunUOH3N8AnSa7Q  We Are The 99.9%, Paul Krugman, New York Times, November 24, 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/03/how-you-i-and-everyone-got-the-top-1-percent-all-wrong/359862/  How You, I, and Everyone Got The Top 1 Percent All Wrong, Derek Thompson, The Atlantic, March 30, 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt; ... who earn $2,000,000 or more every year.&lt;ref name="gabriel-zucman.eu"&gt;[http://gabriel-zucman.eu/files/SaezZucman2014Slides.pdf  The Distribution of US Wealth, Capital Income and Returns since 1913, Emmanuel Saez, Gabriel Zucman], March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/phildemuth/2013/11/25/are-you-rich-enough-the-terrible-tragedy-of-income-inequality-among-the-1/ Are You Rich Enough?

For example, measured relative to GDP, total compensation and its component wages and salaries have been declining since 1970. This indicates a shift in income from labor (persons who derive income from hourly wages and salaries) to capital (persons who derive income via ownership of businesses, land and assets).&lt;ref name="voxeu.org"&gt;[http://www.voxeu.org/article/monetary-policy-and-long-term-trends Vox-Goodheart and Erfurth-Monetary policy and long-term trends-November 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; Wages and salaries have fallen from approximately 51% GDP in 1970 to 43% GDP in 2013. Total compensation has fallen from approximately 58% GDP in 1970 to 53% GDP in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?graph_id=205101&amp;updated=1530 FRED Database-Income Measures vs GDP-Retrieved November 6, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; To put this in perspective, five percent of U.S. GDP was approximately $850 billion in 2013. This represents an additional $7,000 in wages and salaries for each of the 120 million U.S. households. [[Larry Summers]] estimated in 2007 that the lower 80% of families were receiving $664 billion less income than they would be with a 1979 income distribution (a period of much greater equality), or approximately $7,000 per family.&lt;ref name="larrysummers.com"&gt;[http://larrysummers.com/commentary/financial-times-columns/harness-market-forces-to-share-prosperity-june-24-2007/ Lawrence Summers-Harness Market Forces to Share Prosperity-June 24, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

Not receiving this income may have led many families to increase their debt burden, a significant factor in the 2007-2009 [[subprime mortgage crisis]], as highly leveraged homeowners suffered a much larger reduction in their net worth during the crisis. Further, since lower income families tend to spend relatively more of their income than higher income families, shifting more of the income to wealthier families may slow economic growth.&lt;ref name="Mian and Sufi2014"&gt;{{cite book

In another example, [[The Economist]] propounds that a swelling corporate financial and banking sector has caused Gini Coefficients to rise in the U.S. since 1980: "Financial services' share of GDP in America doubled to 8% between 1980 and 2000; over the same period their profits rose from about 10% to 35% of total corporate profits, before collapsing in 2007–09. Bankers are being paid more, too. In America the compensation of workers in financial services was similar to average compensation until 1980. Now it is twice that average."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/17957381  Unbottled Gini, The Economist, January 20, 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt; The summary argument, considering these findings, is that if corporatism is the consolidation and sharing of economic and political power between large corporations and the state ... then a corresponding concentration of income and wealth (with resulting income inequality) is an expected by-product of such a consolidation.

===Neoliberalism===

Some economists, sociologists and anthropologists argue that [[neoliberalism]], or the resurgence of 19th century theories relating to ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[economic liberalism]] in the late 1970s, has been the significant driver of inequality.{{refn|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Dean|first=Jodi|date=2012 |title=The Communist Horizon|url=|location= |publisher=Verso|page=123 |isbn=978-1844679546|author-link=Jodi Dean|quote="Pursued through policies of privatization, deregulation, and financialization, and buttressed by an ideology of private property, free markets, and free trade, neoliberalism has entailed cuts in taxes for the rich and cuts in protections and benefits for workers and the poor, resulting in an exponential increase in inequality."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "RDWolff"&gt;[[Richard D.

* "The advent of economic neoliberalism in the 1980s triggered a shift in the world economy. In the three decades following World War II, now considered a golden age of capitalism, economic growth was high and income inequality decreasing. But in the mid-1970s this social compact was broken as the world economy entered the stagflation crisis, following a decline in the profitability of capital. This crisis opened a new phase of stagnating growth and wages, and unemployment. Interest rates as well as dividend flows rose, and income inequality widened."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Coburn.

This article is essentially a testimony on the work of Rouget de Lisle, visionary in its enlightened synthesis of the production of faithful works by efficient industrial means. The '''chromagraphy''' is " the art to compose a drawing by means of lines and geometrical figures and to imitate it with colored materials ", according to Rouget de Lisle. This technique described in 1839 in France, in Paris, exposes a set of methods and of processes to produce tapestries and tissues. It includes the following techniques:
* The printing in black and in color on paper, pattern and tissues,
* The preparation of colors and materials necessary for the draftsmen, for the colourers and the manufacturers of carpet and [[tapestries]], classified according to a chromatic table,
* A manufacturing process of point, innovative in 1839,
* The art to make industrially tapestries comparable to the best tapestries in that time.

== Definitions ==
Chromagraphie: art to compose a model by means of lines and of geometrical figures, and to imitate it with colored materials. Rouget de Lisle described its process of composition and printing of works in color on paper, pattern and tissues as allowing to save 50% of time with regard to a manual realization.

== Etymology ==
The word chromagraphy comes from ancient Greek Khrôma which means "color" and Graphein who means "writing". This etymology is comparable to that of the scientific term "[[chromatography]]", appeared only in 1908 and which must not be confused with the chromagraphy of Rouget de Lisle.

== History ==
The intention of Rouget de Lisle was " to create a funny and lucrative activity to the ladies and to the artists colourers “by developing the work of the color” by the composition of tasteful models which make them love and look for " and by propagating " the feeling and the love of the beautiful ".
He began to gather and to classify the knowledge of the painters and the [[manufacturers]] of [[tapestries]] to realize their works of a "pleasant, economic and complete" way. These works ending in the chromagraphy benefited from the support of big names of the domain in the time, among which the administrator of the royal factory of Tapestries ([[Manufacture des Gobelins]]), Mr Lavocat, the director of the dyes of the royal factories, Mr Chevreul, the foreman of the royal [[factory]] of [[tapestries]], Mr Deyrolles, with his son, painter of the models of carpet. Rouget de Lisle was itself a pupil of Mr Chevreul.

== Principle ==
The general principle is to simplify the complete chain leading from a work to its reproduction on another support, as the [[carpet]] or the [[Tissue paper|tissue]]. Rouget de Lisle attempts to refocus the work of the various workers on tasks with values added, as well for the persons as for their productions. He brings a particular attention to the [[quality (business)|quality]] throughout the process, in particular on the management of colors and their exact reproductions. He exposes " the law of the simultaneous contrast " and the "[[Color table|chromatic Table]]" allowing to end in quality printings. He so obtains 200 tints all in all. These 200 tones are codified by a language allowing their fast reproductions during the preparation of tapestries. The drawing of the work to be reproduced completed by the [[symbols]] of tints of every points constitutes the chromagraphy. This system reminds the modern description of a computer file of [[Bitmap]] type or [[GIF]] 8 bits. Rouget de Lisle also integrates signs for the various types of [[wikt:point|point]]s to be realized.

== Example ==
Example of Chromagraphy by Rouget de Lisle : (to be done)

One of the tables of signs symbolizing tints: (to be done)

One of the tables of tones according to the rules of the simultaneous constrate exposed(explained) by Rouget de Lisle in his work on the chromagraphie: (to be done)

== Notes and references ==
All the extracts and examples of Rouget de Lisle result from a reproduction of its work published in 1839, on Chromagraphy (see the external references). The chromagraphy in its spirit and its principle gets closer to [[digital art]]s appeared since the end of 20th century [[computer painting]]s, prints, drawings, etc.). The chain of digital printing from a file of digital image recall the mechanical [[production line]] described by Rouget de Lisle, but in a computer and a modern industrial machine, such as a [[Printer (computing)|printer]], a weaver, etc.

'''Edward A. Shanken''' (born 1964) is an American [[art historian]], whose work focuses on the entwinement of art, science and technology, with a focus on experimental [[new media art]] and visual culture. His scholarship has appeared in numerous journals and anthologies and has been translated into six languages. Shanken is the author of ''Art and Electronic Media'' (Phaidon Press, 2009).

==Background==
Edward A. Shanken graduated from [[Haverford College]] (1986) and then obtained an MA (1999) and Ph.D. (2001) in [[Art History]] from [[Duke University]] after receiving an [[MBA]] from [[Yale University]] in 1990. He was the Executive Director of the Information Science Information Studies program (ISIS) at Duke University from 2001 to 2004. From 2004 to 2007 Shanken was Professor of Art History and Media Theory at Savannah College of Art and Design and Senior Researcher at the UCLA Art | Science Center and Visiting Scholar at the California NanoSystems Institute from 2007 to 2008. He joined the Department of Media Studies, University of Amsterdam in 2008, where he served as Universitair Docent, New Media and Digital Culture, 2008-2010 and as a Researcher, 2010-2012. In 2010, he was the inaugural Louis D. Beaumont Scholar at Washington University in St. Louis. Since 2007 he has served on the faculty of the Media Art Histories MA program at Donau University, Krems, Austria. In 2013 he joined the faculty at the Center for Digital Arts and Experimental Media ([[DXARTS]]) at [[University of Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dxarts.washington.edu/news/2013/09/19/edward-shanken-joins-dxarts-faculty] Edward Shanken Joins DXARTS Faculty.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2016, Shanken joined [[UC Santa Cruz]] to lead the innovative Digital Arts/New Media (DANM) program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arts.ucsc.edu/features/featured-faculty/ed-shanken-joins-ucsc-danm%E2%80%99s-newest-director] Edward Shanken Leads UC Santa Cruz DAMN Program.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shanken has been awarded fellowships from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] and the [[American Council of Learned Societies]]. He was formerly chair of the Leonardo Education Forum and a member of the [[College Art Association]] Education Committee and has served as an advisor to the [[Media Art]] Histories conference, ISEA, the journal Technoetic Arts, and the Leonardo Pioneers and Pathbreakers project. He has conducted extensive research on the theorist and art critic [[Jack Burnham]] and into [[cybernetics]] as applied to [[systems art]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charlie Gere]], ''Art, Time and Technology: Histories of the Disappearing Body'' (2005) Berg, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research Activity==
Recent and forthcoming publications include essays on art and technology in the 1960s, interactivity and agency, the historiography of art and technology, parallels between conceptual art and art and technology, and the cultural implications of [[cybernetics]], telematics, robotics, and biotechnology. Shanken’s current research examines art-science [[collaboration]] and the relationship between the discourses of mainstream contemporary art and new media art. Following the first concern, he chaired the panel discussion,"Artists in Industry and the Academy: Interdisciplinary Research Collaborations" at the 2004 Annual Conference of the [[College Art Association]] and served as guest [[editing|editor]] of a special series of essays under the same title in the [[Leonardo Journal]] (38:4 and 38:5) in 2005. More recently he guest-edited a special series of essays, “The Reception and Rejection of Art and Technology: Exclusions and Revulsions,” which appeared in the journals ''a minima'' (Mar 2008) and ''Leonardo'' 42: 2 (Apr 2008). Following the second concern, he organized and chaired a panel discussion with [[Nicolas Bourriaud]], [[Peter Weibel]] and Michael Joaquin Grey at Art Basel in June 2010 (see external link below) and organized and chaired a panel discussion at the College Art Association Annual Conference (CAA) in 2011, the papers of which were published in a special issue of ArtNodes (see links below).  A further research area is the use of social media to expand and democratize the production and dissemination of art criticism. This is exemplified by the Art and Electronic Media Online Companion, a [[Web 2.0]] site.

==Teaching Activity==
Shanken currently teaches at the Digital Arts/New Media (DANM) MFA program at [[UC Santa Cruz]]. He has previously taught media and art history at [[Rhode Island School of Design]], [[Duke University]], [[Savannah College of Art and Design]], the University of Amsterdam, Donau University (in Austria), the Center for Digital Arts and Experimental Media (DXARTS) at the University of Washington.

==Publishing Activity==

'''Face time''' is an English [[idiom]] for direct personal interaction or contact between two or more people at the same time and [[location (geography)|physical location]]. Face time therefore occurs in "[[real life]]" and contrasts primarily with interaction or contact which occurs over distance (e.g., via [[telephone]]) and/or electronically (e.g., via [[email]], [[instant messaging]], [[e-commerce]], [[social media]], or [[computer simulation]]s).

The term was originally a [[colloquialism]] but has entered the [[vernacular]] with the increasing number of people throughout the world who commonly and extensively rely on [[telecommunications]] and the [[Internet]] for personal and business communication.

The '''Archivo General de Indias''' ({{IPA-es|aɾˈtʃiβo xeneˈɾal de ˈindjas}}, "General Archive of the Indies"), housed in the ancient merchants' exchange of [[Seville]], [[Spain]], the ''Casa Lonja de Mercaderes'', is the repository of extremely valuable archival documents illustrating the history of the [[Spanish Empire]] in the Americas and the Philippines. The building itself, an unusually serene and Italianate example of Spanish [[Renaissance architecture]], was designed by [[Juan de Herrera]]. This structure and its contents were registered in 1987 by [[UNESCO]] as a [[World Heritage Site]] together with the adjoining [[Seville Cathedral]] and the [[Alcázar of Seville]].

==Structure==
The origin of the structure dates to 1572 when [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] commissioned the building from [[Juan de Herrera]], the architect of the [[Escorial]] to house the [[Consulado de mercaderes]] of Seville. Until then, the merchants of Seville had been in the habit of retreating to the cool recesses of the cathedral to transact business.

The building encloses a large central patio with ranges of two storeys, the windows set in slightly sunken panels between flat [[pilasters]]. Plain square tablets float in the space above each window. The building is surmounted by a [[balustrade]], with rusticated [[obelisk]]s standing at the corners. There is no sculptural decoration, only the discreetly contrasting tonalities of stone and stucco, and the light shadows cast by the slight relief of the pilasters against their piers, by the cornices, and by the cornice strips that cap each window.

The building was begun in 1584 by [[Juan de Mijares]], using Herrera's plans, and was ready for occupation in 1598, according to an inscription on the north façade. Work on completing the structure proceeded through the 17th century, directed until 1629 by the archbishop Juan de Zumárraga and finished by [[Pedro Sanchez Falconete]].

Researchers who wish to examine the archive's sources use another building located across the street.

In 1785, by decree of [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]] the archives of the [[Council of the Indies]] were to be housed here, in order to bring together under a single roof all the documentation regarding the overseas empire, which until that time had been dispersed among various archives, as [[Simancas]], [[Cádiz]] and Seville.&lt;ref&gt;Jorge Cañizares-Esguerra, ''How to Write the History of the New World: Histories, Epistemologies, and Identities in the Eighteenth-Century Atlantic World''. Stanford: Stanford University Press 2001, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; Responsibility for the project was delegated to  [[José de Gálvez|José de Gálvez y Gallardo]], Secretary for the Indies, who depended on the historian Juan Bautista Muñoz for the plan's execution. Two basic motivations underlay the project; in addition to the lack of space in the ''Archivo General de Simancas'', the central archive of the Spanish Crown, there was also the expectation, in the spirit of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], that Spanish historians would take up the history of Spain's colonial empire. It was decided that, for the time being, documents evolved after 1760 would remain with their primary institutions.

The first cartloads of the documents arrived in October 1785. Some restructuring of the ''Casa Lonja'' to accommodate the materials was required, and a grand marble staircase was added in 1787, to designs of Lucas Cintara.

The archives are rich with autograph material from the first of the [[Conquistadores]] to the end of the 19th century. Here are [[Miguel de Cervantes]]' request for an official post, the [[Papal bull|Bull]] of Demarcation [[Inter caetera]] of [[Pope Alexander VI]] that divided the world between Spain and Portugal, the journal of [[Christopher Columbus]], maps and plans of the colonial American cities, in addition to the ordinary archives that reveal the month-to-month workings of the whole vast colonial machinery, which have been mined by many  historians in the last two centuries.

Today the ''Archivo General de Indias'' houses some nine kilometers of shelving, in 43,000 volumes and some 80 million pages, which were produced by the colonial administration:

The structure underwent a thorough restoration in 2002–2004, without interrupting its function as a research library. {{As of|2005}}, its 15 million pages are in the process of being digitized. The digitized sources are accessible online &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pares.mcu.es|title=Portal de Archivos Españoles|author=|date=18 May 2018|website=pares.mcu.es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George Cram Cook''' or '''Jig Cook''' (October 7, 1873 &amp;ndash; January 14, 1924) was an American theatre [[Theatrical producer|producer]], [[Theatre director|director]], playwright, novelist, poet, and university professor. Believing it was his personal mission to inspire others, Cook led the founding of the [[Provincetown Players]] on [[Cape Cod]] in 1915; their "creative collective"&lt;ref name="sarlos"&gt;Sarlós, Robert K. (1984). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1542-734X.1984.0703_65.x/abstract "The Provincetown Players' Genesis or Non-Commercial Theatre on Commercial Streets"], ''Journal of American Culture'', Vol. 7, Issue 3 (Fall 1984), pp.&amp;nbsp;65–70&lt;/ref&gt; was considered the first modern American theatre company.&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Zvi, Linda. "Preface." Preface. ''Susan Glaspell: Her Life and Times''. Oxford University Press, 2005. Ix.&lt;/ref&gt; During his seven-year tenure with the group, Cook oversaw the production of nearly one-hundred new plays by fifty American playwrights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.provincetownplayhouse.com/history.html|title=History of the Provincetown Playhouse|website=www.provincetownplayhouse.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is particularly remembered for producing the first plays of [[Eugene O'Neill]], along with those of Cook's wife [[Susan Glaspell]], and several other noted writers. 

While teaching English literature at the [[University of Iowa]] from 1896 to 1899, Cook also taught what is thought to be the first creative writing course. Titled "Verse-Making," the course was continued by Cook's colleagues at the university after he left. It was not until the 1950s that the [[Iowa Writers Workshop]] was founded.

==Biography==

Cram wrote: "I was born and raised in [[Davenport, Iowa]], where my family was one of the town's oldest and most wealthy. My father, a corporate lawyer, strongly encouraged my education from a young age, while my mother instilled in me a passion for culture and the arts. I completed my bachelor's degree at [[Harvard]] in 1893."{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} He continued his studies in Europe at the [[University of Heidelberg]] in 1894 and at the [[University of Geneva]] the following year.

Upon completing these studies, Cook returned to Iowa. He taught English literature and classics at the [[University of Iowa]] from 1895 until 1899. He also taught an early creative writing course, which he called "Verse Making".&lt;ref&gt;[https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/bitstream/handle/1773/20713/Cohen_washington_0250E_10606.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=n Sarah Cohen, ''School of Unlikeness:
The Creative Writing Workshop and American Poetry''], PhD dissertation, 2012, University of Washington&lt;/ref&gt; {{page needed|date=November 2018}} During the 1902 academic year, Cook was an English professor at [[Stanford University]].

It was not until the 1950s that [[Paul Engle]] is credited with developing what is considered the world's first creative writing program, the [[Iowa Writer's Workshop]], which has gained renown.&lt;ref&gt;''A Community of Writers: Paul Engle and the Iowa Writers' Workshop'', ed. Robert Dana, University of Iowa Press, 1999, p226&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Wilbers, ''The Iowa Writers Workshop: Origins, Emergence and Growth'', University of Iowa Press, 1980, p35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/06/08/show-or-tell|title=Show or Tell|first=Louis|last=Menand|date=June 1, 2009|publisher=newyorker.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Davenport, Cook associated with other young writers in what was informally referred to as the [[Davenport Group (literature)|Davenport group]]. Among them was writer [[Susan Glaspell]]. He divorced his second wife, and he and Glaspell married in 1913. 

To escape community gossip and seek larger world for their work, the couple moved to New York City, where they lived in [[Greenwich Village]]. There they had a daughter Nilla and son Harl together. In the summer of 1915 they went to [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]] for the season, as did many other writers and artists from the Village. Cook was among the founders of the [[Provincetown Players]] that year, an important step in the development of American [[theatre]]. The group would perform works by Cook and Glaspell, as well as the first plays of [[Eugene O'Neill]] and [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]], among others. Cook would lead the Provincetown Players until 1919, at which time he took a sabbatical. Although he returned to the group in 1920, internal wrangling and his own frustration led to his effectively abandoning the cooperative.

==Later years==
[[File:Cookglaspelldog.jpg|thumb|239px|right|Wife [[Susan Glaspell]] with Cook wearing his [[fustanella]]. Pictured also is Cook's dog from which he contracted [[glanders|a fatal disease]].]]

In 1922, Cook and his family moved to [[Greece]]. They lived at [[Delphi]], where they spent the summers camped in spruce huts high above the village on [[Mount Parnassus]]. After a short time, Cook began to wear ''[[fustanella]]'', the traditional Greek shepherd's attire. In 1924 he contracted [[glanders|a rare infectious disease]] from his pet dog and died. Cook's obituary appeared on the front page of the ''[[New York Times]]''. 

He is buried at Delphi in a small cemetery within hundreds of feet of the ruins of the famous [[Temple of Apollo (Delphi)|Temple of Apollo]], home of the [[Pythia|oracle]]. So beloved was Cook by the locals that the Greek government allowed a stone from the temple foundation to be used as his grave marker.&lt;ref name="Jig Cook book"&gt;{{cite book | title=Jig Cook and the Provincetown Players: Theatre in Ferment| last=Sarlós| first=Robert K.| publisher=University of Massachusetts Press| location=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; Years later his daughter Nilla Cram Cook would be buried beside him.

'''Mir Ghulam Muhammad Ghobar''' ({{lang-fa|'''میرغلام‌محمد غبار'''}} (1897 &amp;ndash; February 5, 1978) was a politician, writer, prominent historian, journalist, and a poet from [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.afghan-web.com/bios/yest/othersp.html#Ghobar|title=Afghanistan Online: Biography (Other Personalities in Afghan History)|website=www.afghan-web.com|access-date=2017-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the author of a number of books, including Afghanistan's history book called ''[[Afghanistan in the Course of History]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Afghanistan-Course-History-Gholam-Mohammad/dp/0970796404|title=Afghanistan in the Course of History, Volume Two|last=Ghobar|first=Mir Gholam Mohammad|date=February 28, 2001|publisher=Hashmat K Gobar|isbn=9780970796400|edition=1st|location=Alexandria, VA|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also written ''Tareekh-e Ahmad Shah Baba'' in 1943, which is about the 18th century Afghan Emir [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] and his [[Durrani Empire]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4836">'''Granius Licinianus''' (active in the 2nd century AD) was a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] author of historical and encyclopedic works that survive only in fragments. He most likely lived at the time of [[Hadrian]].&lt;ref&gt;Gian Biagio Conte, ''Latin Literature: A History'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1987, 1994), p. 551 [https://books.google.com/books?id=NJGp_dkXnuUC&amp;pg=PA551&amp;dq=%22Granius+Licinianus%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=28#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Granius%20Licinianus%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Granius compiled a "novel"&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael von Albrecht]], ''A History of Roman Literature'' (Brill, 1994, 1997), p. 864.&lt;/ref&gt; narrative epitome of Roman history, drawing mainly on [[Livy]] and [[Sallust]], that ran to at least 36 books, "keen on anecdotes and curious details."&lt;ref&gt;Conte, ''Latin Literature'', p. 551; [[Erich S. Gruen]], ''The Last Generation of the Roman Republic'' (University of California Press, 1974, 1995), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; That he had his own views on [[Roman historiography|historiography]] should not be doubted: in his opinion, Sallust ought not to be read as an historian at all, but as an orator.&lt;ref&gt;Granius, 36; Michael Grant, ''Ancient Historians'' (Barnes &amp; Noble, 1970, 1994), p. 211; [[H.J. Rose]], ''A Handbook of Latin Literature'' (Routledge, 1936, 1996), p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; Granius covered the history of Rome from the early times at least to the death of [[Julius Caesar]]; the assumption of this as an end-point of his history has sometimes caused him to be identified with [[Granius Flaccus]] and his life to be dated to the 1st century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, ''Handbook'', pp. 29 and 514; Rose rejects the identification, mainly promulgated in the 19th century.&lt;/ref&gt; Though riddled with ''[[lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunae]],'' Granius's Book 35 presents one of the most informative accounts of the siege of Rome during the [[Sulla's first civil war|civil war of 87 BC]], and his history regularly provides illuminative details that complement more complete histories.&lt;ref&gt;Christoph F. Konrad, ''Plutarch's'' Sertorius'': A Historical Commentary'' pp. lii and 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Some fragments of the books relating to the years 163-78 BC are preserved in a  manuscript which was discovered in 1853 and survives as a double ''[[palimpsest]],'' that is, a 5th-century copy was overwritten in the 6th century with a Latin grammatical treatise and again in the 11th century with a [[Syriac language|Syriac]] translation of [[John Chrysostom]]'s sermons. ([[British Library, Add. 17212|Add. 17212]])&lt;ref&gt;Ralph W. Mathisen, "Paleography and Codicology," in ''The Oxford Handbook of Early Christian Studies'' Oxford University Press, 2008), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

Granius also wrote ''Cenae Suae'' ("My Dinner Parties"), an encyclopedic work that displayed his [[antiquarian]] interests in the manner of [[Aulus Gellius]] and his ''Attic Nights''.&lt;ref&gt;Conte, ''Latin Literature'', p. 551.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Antisemitism}}
The '''history of antisemitism''', defined as hostile actions or discrimination against [[Jew]]s as a religious or ethnic group, goes back many centuries, with [[antisemitism]] being called "the longest hatred".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.richardwebster.net/antisemitismthelongesthatred.html Our common inhumanity: anti-semitism and history] by Richard Webster (a review of ''Antisemitism: The Longest Hatred'' by Robert S. Wistrich, Thames Methuen, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Jerome Chanes identifies six stages in the historical development of antisemitism:&lt;ref name=Chanes5&gt;{{cite book|title=Antisemitism: A Reference Handbook|first=Jerome A.|last=Chanes|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2004|pages=5–6|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ju7U83nRDt8C&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=%22economic+antisemitism%22+antiquity#v=onepage&amp;q=%22economic%20antisemitism%22%20antiquity&amp;f=false|isbn=9781576072097}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Pre-Christian [[anti-Judaism]] in ancient Greece and Rome which was primarily ethnic in nature
#[[Christianity and antisemitism|Christian antisemitism]] in antiquity and the Middle Ages which was religious in nature and has extended into modern times
# Traditional [[Islam and antisemitism|Muslim antisemitism]] which was—at least in its classical form—nuanced, in that Jews were a protected class
# Political, social and economic antisemitism of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and post-Enlightenment Europe which laid the groundwork for [[racial antisemitism]]
# Racial antisemitism that arose in the 19th century and culminated in [[Nazism]]
# Contemporary antisemitism which has been labeled by some as the [[new antisemitism]]

Chanes suggests that these six stages could be merged into three categories: "ancient antisemitism, which was primarily ethnic in nature; Christian antisemitism, which was religious; and the racial antisemitism of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries".&lt;ref name=Chanes5/&gt; In practice, it is difficult to differentiate antisemitism from the general ill-treatment of nations by other nations before the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] period, but since the adoption of [[Christianity]] in Europe, antisemitism has undoubtedly been present. The [[Islamic]] world has also seen the Jews historically as outsiders. The coming of the scientific and industrial revolution in 19th-century Europe bred a new manifestation of antisemitism, based as much upon race as upon religion, culminating in the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] during World War II. The [[Creation of the State of Israel|formation of the state of Israel i]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;n 1948 has created new antisemitic tensions in the Middle East.

==Classical period==

===Early animosity towards Jews===

[[Louis H. Feldman]] argues that "we must take issue with the ''communis sensus'' that the [[Paganism|pagan]] writers are predominantly anti-Semitic".&lt;ref name=Feldman289&gt;{{cite book |title=Studies in Hellenistic Judaism |first=Louis H. |last=Feldman |publisher=BRILL |year=1996 |page=289 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=pACJYw0bg3QC&amp;pg=PA289&amp;dq=antisemitism+Jews+occupations+ancient#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=9004104186 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He asserts that "one of the great puzzles that has confronted the students of anti-semitism is the alleged shift from pro-Jewish statements found in the first pagan writers who mention the Jews ... to the vicious anti-Jewish statements thereafter, beginning with [[Manetho]] about 270 [[BCE]]".&lt;ref name=Feldman177&gt;{{cite book |title=Studies in Hellenistic Judaism |first=Louis H.|last=Feldman |publisher=BRILL |year=1996 |page=177 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=pACJYw0bg3QC&amp;pg=PA177&amp;dq=antisemitism+Jews+occupations+ancient#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=9004104186}}&lt;/ref&gt; In view of Manetho's anti-Jewish writings, antisemitism may have originated in Egypt and been spread by "the [[Greeks|Greek]] retelling of [[Ancient Egypt]]ian prejudices".&lt;ref name="Schäfer"&gt;Schäfer, Peter. ''Judeophobia'', Harvard University Press, 1997, p. 208.[[Peter Schaefer (author)|Peter Schäfer]]&lt;/ref&gt; As examples of pagan writers who spoke positively of Jews, Feldman cites [[Aristotle]], [[Theophrastus]], [[Clearchus of Soli]] and [[Megasthenes]]. Feldman concedes that after Manetho "the picture usually painted is one of universal and virulent [[anti-Judaism]]".

The first clear examples of anti-Jewish sentiment can be traced back to [[Alexandria]] in the 3rd century BCE.&lt;ref name=Flannery&gt;Flannery, Edward H. ''The Anguish of the Jews: Twenty-Three Centuries of Antisemitism''. Paulist Press, first published in 1985; this edition 2004, pp. 11–12. {{ISBN|0-8091-2702-4}}. [[Edward Flannery]]&lt;/ref&gt; Alexandria was home to the largest Jewish community in the world and the [[Septuagint]], a Greek translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]], was produced there. [[Manetho]], an Egyptian priest and historian of that time, wrote scathingly of the Jews and his themes are repeated in the works of [[Chaeremon of Alexandria|Chaeremon]], [[Lysimachus]], [[Poseidonius]], [[Apollonius Molon]], and in [[Apion]] and [[Tacitus]].&lt;ref name=Flannery /&gt; [[Hecataeus of Abdera|Hecateus of Abdera]] is quoted by [[Flavius Josephus]] as having written about the time of Alexander the Great that the Jews "have often been treated injuriously by the kings and governors of Persia, yet can they not be dissuaded from acting what they think best; but that when they are stripped on this account, and have torments inflicted upon them, and they are brought to the most terrible kinds of death, they meet them after an extraordinary manner, beyond all other people, and will not renounce the religion of their forefathers".&lt;ref&gt;(Against Apion, 1.161)&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest anti-Jewish [[edict]]s, promulgated by [[Antiochus Epiphanes]] in about 170–167 BCE, sparked a revolt of the [[Maccabees]] in [[Judea]].

The ancient Jewish philosopher [[Philo of Alexandria]] describes an attack on Jews in Alexandria in 38 CE in which thousands of Jews died.&lt;ref name=Barclay&gt;Barclay, John M G, 1999. ''Jews in the Mediterranean Diaspora: From Alexander to Trajan (323 BCE – 117 CE)'', University of California. John M. G. Barclay of the [[Durham University|University of Durham]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philo of Alexandria, ''Flaccus'', online at http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/yonge/book36.html&lt;/ref&gt; The violence in Alexandria may have been caused by the Jews being portrayed as [[misanthropy|misanthropes]].&lt;ref name=vanderhorst&gt;Van Der Horst, Pieter Willem, 2003. ''Philo's Flaccus: the First Pogrom'', Philo of Alexandria Commentary Series, Brill. [[Pieter Willem van der Horst]]&lt;/ref&gt; Tcherikover argues that the reason for hatred of Jews in the Hellenistic period was their separateness in the Greek cities, the ''[[polis|poleis]]''.&lt;ref name=tcherikover&gt;Tcherikover, Victor, ''Hellenistic Civilization and the Jews'', New York: Atheneum, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; Bohak has argued, however, that early animosity against the Jews cannot be regarded as being anti-Judaic or antisemitic unless it arose from attitudes that were held against the Jews alone, and that many Greeks showed animosity toward any group they regarded as [[Barbarian|barbarians]].&lt;ref name=Bohak&gt;Bohak, Gideon. "The Ibis and the Jewish Question: Ancient 'Antisemitism' in Historical Context" in Menachem Mor et al., ''Jews and Gentiles in the Holy Land in the Days of the Second Temple, the Mishna and the Talmud'', Yad Ben-Zvi Press, 2003, pp. 27–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Statements exhibiting prejudice against Jews and their religion can be found in the works of many [[pagan]] [[ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[ancient Rome|Roman]] writers.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels, J. L., ''Anti-Semitism in the Hellenistic-Roman Period'' in JBL 98 (1979) pp. 45–65&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Flannery writes that it was the Jews' refusal to accept Greek religious and social standards that marked them out. [[Hecataeus of Abdera]], a Greek historian of the early third century BCE, wrote that Moses "in remembrance of the exile of his people, instituted for them a misanthropic and inhospitable way of life". Manetho wrote that the Jews were expelled Egyptian lepers who had been taught by [[Moses]] "not to adore the [[Ancient Egyptian religion|gods]]." The same themes appeared in the works of [[Chaeremon]], [[Lysimachus]], [[Poseidonius]], [[Apollonius Molon]], and in [[Apion]] and [[Tacitus]]. [[Agatharchides of Cnidus]] wrote about the "ridiculous practices" of the Jews and of the "absurdity of their Law", and how [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy Lagus]] was able to invade [[Jerusalem]] in 320 BC because its inhabitants were observing the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]].&lt;ref name=Flannery/&gt; Edward Flannery describes antisemitism in ancient times as essentially "cultural, taking the shape of a national [[xenophobia]] played out in political settings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Anguish of the Jews: Twenty-Three Centuries of Antisemitism |first=Edward H. |last=Flannery |publisher=Paulist Press |year=1985 |page=25 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=J40gNC7cxfYC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=%22economic+antisemitism%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22economic%20antisemitism%22&amp;f=false|isbn=9780809143245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a recorded instance of an [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] ruler, [[Antiochus Epiphanes]], desecrating the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] and banning Jewish religious practices, such as [[circumcision]], ''[[Shabbat]]'' observance and the study of Jewish religious books,&lt;ref&gt;2 Maccabees 6:1–11&lt;/ref&gt; during the period when Ancient Greece dominated the eastern Mediterranean. Statements exhibiting prejudice towards Jews and their religion can also be found in the works of a few pagan Greek and Roman writers,&lt;ref&gt;Daniels. J. L., ''Anti-Semitism in the Hellenistic-Roman Period'' in JBL 98 (1979) pp. 45–65&lt;/ref&gt; but the earliest occurrence of antisemitism has been the subject of debate among scholars, largely because different writers use different definitions of antisemitism. The terms "[[religious antisemitism]]" and "anti-Judaism" are sometimes used to refer to animosity towards Judaism as a religion rather than to Jews defined as an ethnic or racial group.

===Roman Empire===
Relations between the Jews in Judea and the occupying [[Roman Empire]] were antagonistic from the very start and resulted in several [[Jewish-Roman wars|rebellions]]. It has been argued that European antisemitism has its roots in Roman policy.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Goodman, ''Rome and Jerusalem: the clash of ancient civilisations'', Allen Lane 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several ancient historians report that in 19 CE the Roman emperor [[Tiberius]] expelled Jews from Rome. According to the Roman historian [[Suetonius]], Tiberius tried to suppress all foreign religions. In the case of Jews, he sent young Jewish men, under the pretence of military service, to provinces noted for their unhealthy climate. He dismissed all other Jews from the city, under threat of life slavery for non-compliance.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''[[Lives of the Twelve Caesars]]'', Vol 3, "Tiberius", Section 36&lt;/ref&gt; [[Josephus]], in his ''Jewish Antiquities'',&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''[[Jewish Antiquities]]'' (18.3.5)&lt;/ref&gt; confirms that Tiberius ordered all Jews to be banished from Rome. Four thousand were sent to [[Sardinia]] but more, who were unwilling to become soldiers, were punished. [[Cassius Dio]] reports that Tiberius banished most of the Jews, who had been attempting to convert Romans to their religion.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', 57.18.5a.&lt;/ref&gt; Philo of Alexandria reported that [[Sejanus]], one of Tiberius's lieutenants, may have been a prime mover in the persecution of the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Philo of Alexandria. ''Against Flaccus''(1.1)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romans refused to permit Jews to rebuild the Temple of Jerusalem after its [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)#Destruction of Jerusalem|destruction]] by [[Titus]] in 70 CE, imposed a tax on Jews ([[Fiscus Judaicus]]) at the same time, ostensibly to finance the [[Temple of Jupiter (Capitoline Hill)|Temple of Jupiter]] in Rome, and renamed [[Iudaea Province|Judaea]] as [[Syria Palestina]]. The [[Jerusalem Talmud]] relates that, following [[Bar Kokhba's revolt]] (132–136 CE), the Romans destroyed very many Jews, "killing until their horses were submerged in blood to their nostrils".&lt;ref&gt;''The Jerusalem Talmud'', Taanis 4:5&lt;/ref&gt; However, some historians argue that Rome brutally suppressed revolts in all its conquered territories and point out that Tiberius expelled all foreign religions from Rome, not just the Jews.

Some accommodation, in fact, was later made with Judaism, and the Jews of the [[Diaspora]] had privileges that others did not. Unlike other subjects of the Roman Empire, they had the right to maintain their religion and were not expected to accommodate themselves to local customs. Even after the [[First Jewish–Roman War]], the Roman authorities refused to rescind Jewish privileges in some cities. And although [[Hadrian]] outlawed circumcision as a mutilation normally visited on people unable to consent, he later exempted the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[[Clifford Ando]],''Times Literary Supplement'', 6 April 2007, pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 18th-century historian [[Edward Gibbon]], there was greater tolerance from about 160 CE. Between 355 and 363 CE, permission was granted by [[Julian the Apostate]] to rebuild the Second Temple of Jerusalem.

===The New Testament and early Christianity===
{{Main article|Antisemitism in the New Testament}}

Although the majority of the [[New Testament]] was written, ostensibly, by Jews who became followers of [[Jesus]], there are a number of passages in the New Testament that some see as antisemitic, or that have been used for antisemitic purposes, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weatherly|first1=Jon A|title=Jewish Responsibility for the Death of Jesus in Luke-Acts|date=1994|location=England|isbn=9781850755036}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schweitzer|first1=F|last2=Perry|first2=M|title=Anti-Semitism: Myth and Hate from Antiquity to the Present|publisher=Palgrave|isbn=978-0-312-16561-1|url=http://www.palgrave.com/br/book/9780312165611}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ruether|first1=Rosemary|title=Faith and Fratricide: The Theological Roots of Anti-Semitism|date=1974|publisher=Seabury Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XNJJAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA93 |isbn=9780965351751}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Jesus speaking to a group of [[Pharisees]]: "I know that you are descendants of [[Abraham]]; yet you seek to kill me, because my word finds no place in you ... You are of your father the devil, and your will is to do your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, and has nothing to do with the truth, because there is no truth in him." ([[Book of John|John]] 8:37–39, 44–47, [[Revised Standard Version|RSV]])
* After [[Pilate]] washes his hands and declares himself innocent of Jesus' blood, the Jewish crowd answers him, "His blood be on us and on our children!" ([[Book of Matthew|Matthew]] 27:25, RSV). In an essay regarding antisemitism, biblical scholar [[Amy-Jill Levine]] argues that this passage has caused more Jewish suffering throughout history than any other in the New Testament.&lt;ref name="FredriksenReinhartz2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Fredriksen, Paula|author2=Reinhartz, Adele|title=Jesus, Judaism, and Christian Anti-Judaism: Reading the New Testament After the Holocaust|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6glHmK_rZYUC&amp;pg=PA91|year=2002|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-0-664-22328-1|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Saint Stephen]] speaking before a synagogue council just before his execution: "You stiff-necked people, uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always resist the [[Holy Spirit]]. As your fathers did, so do you. Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? And they killed those who announced beforehand the coming of the Righteous One, whom you have now betrayed and murdered, you who received the law as delivered by angels and did not keep it." ([[Book of Acts|Acts]] 7:51–53, RSV)

After Jesus' death, the New Testament portrays the Jewish religious authorities in Jerusalem as hostile to Jesus' followers, and as occasionally using force against them. Drawing from the Jewish prophet [[Jeremiah]] ({{Bibleverse-nb||Jeremiah|31:31–34|RSV}}), the [[New Testament]] teaches that with the death of Jesus a [[New Covenant (theology)|New Covenant]] was established which rendered obsolete, and in many respects superseded, the first covenant established by Moses ({{Bibleverse||Hebrews|8:7–13|RSV}}; {{Bibleverse||Luke|22:20|RSV}}). Observance of the earlier covenant traditionally characterizes Judaism. This New Testament teaching, and later variations to it, are part of what is called [[supersessionism]]. However, the early Jewish followers of Jesus continued to practice [[circumcision]] and observe [[Kashrut|dietary laws]], which is why the failure to observe these laws by the first [[Gentile]] Christians became a matter of controversy and dispute some years after Jesus' death ({{Bibleverse||Acts|11:3|RSV}}; {{Bibleverse-nb||Acts|15:1|RSV}}ff; {{Bibleverse-nb||Acts|16:3|RSV}}). Stephen is executed by stoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Acts|7:58|RSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before his conversion, [[Paul of Tarsus|Saul]] puts followers of Jesus in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Acts|8:3|RSV}}; {{Bibleverse||Galatians|1:13–14|RSV}}; {{Bibleverse|1|Timothy|1:13|RSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his conversion, Saul (Paul) is whipped at various times by Jewish authorities&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|2|Corinthians|11:24|RSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is accused by Jewish authorities before the Roman courts.&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{Bibleverse||Acts|25:6–7|RSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, opposition by gentiles is also described,&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|2|Corinthians|11:26|RSV}}; {{Bibleverse||Acts|16:19|RSV}}ff; {{Bibleverse-nb||Acts|19:23ff|RSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more generally there are widespread references in the New Testament to the suffering experienced by Jesus' followers at the hands of others, particularly the Romans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Romans|8:35|RSV}}; {{Bibleverse|1|Corinthians|4:11|RSV}}ff; {{Bibleverse||Galatians|3:4|RSV}}; {{Bibleverse|2|Thessalonians|1:5|RSV}}; {{Bibleverse||Hebrews|10:32|RSV}}; {{Bibleverse|1|Peter|4:16|RSV}}; {{Bibleverse||Revelation|20:4|RSV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Quran and early Islam ===
The [[Quran]], the holy book of [[Muslims]], contains some verses that can be interpreted as expressing very negative views of some Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Laqueur |first=Walter |title=The Changing Face of Antisemitism: From Ancient Times To The Present Day |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |pages=191–92 |isbn=0195304292}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Islam]]ic prophet [[Muhammad]] moved to [[Medina]] in 622 CE he made peace treaties with the Jewish and other tribes. However, the relationship between the followers of the new religion and the Jews of Medina later became bitter. At this point the Quran instructs Muhammad to change the direction of prayer from Jerusalem to [[Mecca]], and from this point on, the tone of the verses of the Quran become increasingly hostile towards Jewry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gold |first=Dore |title=The Fight for Jerusalem: Radical Islam, the West, and the Future of the Holy City |url=https://books.google.com/?id=sLZDIk4GUDsC&amp;pg=PA92 |publisher=Regnery Publishing |year=2007 |page=92 |isbn=9781596980297}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 627, Jewish tribe [[Banu Qurayza]] of Medina violated a treaty with Muhammad by allying with the attacking tribes.&lt;ref name="WattProphetStatesman"&gt;Watt, ''Muhammad, Prophet and Statesman'', pp. 170–176.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the tribe was charged with treason and besieged by the Muslims commanded by Muhammad himself.&lt;ref name="Peterson"&gt;Peterson, ''Muhammad: the prophet of God'', pp. 125–127.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ramadan140"&gt;Ramadan, ''In the Footsteps of the Prophet'', pp. 140ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The Banu Qurayza were forced to surrender and the men were beheaded, while all the women and children were taken captive and enslaved.&lt;ref name="Peterson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ramadan140"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hodgson, p. 191"&gt;Hodgson, ''The Venture of Islam'', vol. 1, p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown, p. 81"&gt;Brown, ''A New Introduction to Islam'', p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lings229"&gt;Lings, ''Muhammad: His Life Based on the Earliest Sources'', pp. 229–233.&lt;/ref&gt; Several scholars have challenged the veracity of this incident, arguing that it was exaggerated or invented.&lt;ref name="Meri1"&gt;Meri, ''Medieval Islamic Civilization: An Encyclopedia'', p. 754.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arafat"&gt;Arafat, "New Light on the Story of Banu Qurayza and the Jews of Medina", pp. 100–107. Arafat relates the testimony of [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani|Ibn Hajar]], who denounced this and other accounts as "odd tales" and quoted [[Malik ibn Anas]], a contemporary of Ibn Ishaq, whom he rejected as a "liar", an "impostor" and for seeking out the Jewish descendants for gathering information about Muhammad's campaign with their forefathers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nemoy&gt;Nemoy, ''Barakat Ahmad's "Muhammad and the Jews"'', p. 325. Nemoy is sourcing Ahmad's ''Muhammad and the Jews''.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, several conflicts arose between Jews of Arabia and Muhammad and his followers, the most notable of which was in [[Khaybar]], in which many Jews were killed and their properties seized and distributed amongst the Muslims.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

==Late Roman Empire==
{{See also|Antisemitism in early Christianity}}

When Christianity became the state religion of Rome in the 4th century, Jews became the object of religious intolerance and political oppression. Christian literature began to display extreme hostility towards Jews, which occasionally resulted in attacks and the burning of synagogues. This hostility was reflected in the edicts both of church councils and state laws. In the early 4th century, intermarriage between unconverted Jews and Christians was prohibited under the provisions of the [[Synod of Elvira]]. The [[Council of Antioch]] (341) prohibited Christians from celebrating Passover with the Jews while the [[Council of Laodicea]] forbade Christians from keeping the Jewish Sabbath.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Cohn-Sherbok (2006) ''The Paradox of Anti-Semitism''. Continuum: 34&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman Emperor [[Constantine I]] instituted several laws concerning the Jews: they were forbidden to own Christian slaves or to circumcise their slaves. The conversion of Christians to Judaism was outlawed. Religious services were regulated, congregations restricted, but Jews were allowed to enter Jerusalem on [[Tisha B'Av]], the anniversary of the destruction of the Temple.

Discrimination became worse in the 5th century. The edicts of the [[Codex Theodosianus]] (438) barred Jews from the civil service, the army and the legal profession.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Cohn-Sherbok (2006) ''The Paradox of Anti-Semitism''. Continuum: 34–35&lt;/ref&gt; The Jewish Patriarchate was abolished and the scope of Jewish courts restricted. Synagogues were confiscated and old synagogues could be repaired only if they were in danger of collapse. Synagogues fell into ruin or were converted to churches. Synagogues were destroyed in [[Tortona]] (350), Rome (388 and 500), [[Raqqa]] (388), [[Menorca]] (418), Daphne (near [[Antioch]], 489 and 507), [[Genoa]] (500), [[Ravenna]] (495), [[Tours]] (585) and in [[Orléans]] (590). Other synagogues were confiscated: [[Urfa]] in 411, several in Judea between 419 and 422, [[Constantinople]] in 442 and 569, [[Antioch]] in 423, [[Vannes]] in 465, [[Diyarbakir]] in 500 [[Terracina]] in 590, [[Cagliari]] in 590 and [[Palermo]] in 590.&lt;ref&gt;[[N. de Lange]], ''Atlas of the Jewish World'', Facts on File, 1984, pp.34–36&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accusations of the killing of Jesus===
{{Main article|Jewish deicide}}

[[Deicide]] is the killing of a god. In the context of Christianity, deicide refers to the [[responsibility for the death of Jesus]]. The [[Jewish deicide|accusation of Jews in deicide]] has been the most powerful warrant for antisemitism by Christians.&lt;ref&gt;Schweitzer, Perry (2002) p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest recorded instance of an accusation of deicide against the Jewish people as a whole – that they were collectively responsible for the death of Jesus – occurs in a sermon of 167 CE attributed to [[Melito of Sardis]] entitled ''Peri Pascha'', ''On the Passover''. This text blames the Jews for allowing [[Herod Antipas|King Herod]] and [[Caiaphas]] to execute Jesus. Melito does not attribute particular blame to [[Pontius Pilate]], mentioning only that Pilate washed his hands of guilt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kerux.com/documents/KeruxV4N1A1.asp On the passover] pp. 57, 82, 92–93 from ''[[Kerux: The Journal of Northwest Theological Seminary|Kerux]]: The Journal of [[Northwest Theological Seminary]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The sermon is written in Greek, but may have been an appeal to Rome to spare Christians at a time when Christians were widely persecuted.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The Latin word ''deicida'' (slayer of god), from which the word ''deicide'' is derived, was used in the 4th century by Peter Chrystologus in his sermon number 172.&lt;ref&gt;Charleton Lewis and Charles Short, ''Latin Dictionary'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/resolveform?lang=Latin Latin Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; Though not part of [[Roman Catholic]] [[dogma]], many Christians, including members of the clergy, once held Jews to be [[collective guilt|collectively responsible]] for killing Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/jubilee_2000/magazine/documents/ju_mag_01111997_p-31_en.html Nostra Aetate: a milestone – Pier Francesco Fumagalli&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; According to this interpretation, both the Jews present at Jesus' death and the Jewish people collectively and for all time had committed the sin of deicide, or God-killing.&lt;ref name=Paley&gt;Paley, Susan and Koesters, Adrian Gibbons, eds.

==Middle Ages==
{{Main article|Antisemitism in Europe (Middle Ages)|Jews in the Middle Ages}}

There was continuing hostility to Judaism from the late Roman period into medieval times. During the Middle Ages in Europe there was a full-scale persecution of Jews in many places, with [[blood libel]]s, expulsions, [[forced conversion]]s and killings. In the 12th century, there were Christians who believed that some, or possibly all, of the Jews possessed magical powers and had gained these powers from making a pact with the [[devil]]. [[Judensau]] images began to appear in Germany.
[[File:Massacre of Jews woodcut, 1493.jpg|thumb|Jewish martyrdom depicted in a woodcut from 1493]]
The persecution of the Jews in Europe reached a climax during the [[Crusades]]. Anti-Jewish rhetoric such as the ''Goad of Love'' began to appear and affect public consciousness.&lt;ref name=NYT121115&gt;{{cite news|author1=Sara Lipton|title=The Words That Killed Medieval Jews|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/13/opinion/the-words-that-killed-medieval-jews.html|accessdate=13 December 2015|work=The New York Times|date=11 December 2015|quote=The “Goad of Love,” a retelling of the crucifixion that is considered the first anti-Jewish Passion treatise, was written around 1155–80.}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the [[First Crusade]], in 1096, a [[German Crusade, 1096|German Crusade]] destroyed flourishing Jewish communities on the Rhine and the Danube. In the [[Second Crusade]] in 1147, the Jews in France were the victims of frequent killings and atrocities. In the first large-scale persecution in Germany after the First Crusade, thousands of Jews were killed by [[Rintfleisch massacres|Rintfleisch knights]] in 1298. The Jews were also subjected to attacks during the [[Shepherds' Crusade (1251)|Shepherds' Crusades of 1251]] and [[Shepherds' Crusade (1320)|1320]]. Following these crusades, Jews were subject to expulsions, including, in 1290, the banishing of all English Jews. In 1396, 100,000 Jews were expelled from France and in 1421, thousands were expelled from Austria. Many of those expelled fled to Poland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.holocaustcenterpgh.net/2-3.html Why the Jews? – Black Death] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070429065613/http://www.holocaustcenterpgh.net/2-3.html |date=2007-04-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the [[Black Death]] plague swept across Europe in the mid-14th century, annihilating more than half of the population, Jews often became the [[scapegoats]]. Rumors spread that they had caused this epidemic by deliberately [[well poisoning|poisoning wells]]. Hundreds of Jewish communities were [[Black Death Jewish persecutions|destroyed by the ensuing hatred and violence]]. [[Pope Clement VI]] tried to protect Jews by a [[papal bull]] dated July 6, 1348, and by an additional bull soon afterwards, but several months later, 900 Jews were [[Strasbourg massacre|burnt alive in Strasbourg]], where the plague had not yet affected the city.&lt;ref name="Black"/&gt;

===Relations in the Islamic world===
From the 9th century onwards, the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]] imposed ''[[dhimmi]]'' status on both Christian and Jewish minorities. Nevertheless, Jews were allowed more freedom to practise their religion in the [[Muslim world]] than they were in Christian Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=María Rosa|last=Menocal|author-link=María Rosa Menocal|title=The Ornament of the World: How Muslims, Jews and Christians Created a Culture of Tolerance in Medieval Spain|date=April 2003|publisher=Back Bay Books|isbn=0-316-16871-8|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the entrance of the [[Almoravides]] from North Africa in the 11th century saw harsh measures taken against both Christians and Jews.&lt;ref name=paradox /&gt; As part of this repression there were pogroms against Jews in Cordova in 1011 and in [[1066 Granada massacre|Granada in 1066]].&lt;ref name="Schweitzer267-268"&gt;Schweitzer, Perry (2002) pp. 267–68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=412&amp;letter=G&amp;search=Granada Granada] by Richard Gottheil, Meyer Kayserling, ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''. 1906 ed.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harzig, Hoerder &amp; Shubert, 2003, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Almohad]]s, who by 1147 had taken control of the Almoravids' Maghribi and Andalusian territories,&lt;ref name=islamicworldeb&gt;Islamic world.

Continuum: 4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Occupational and other restrictions===
Restrictions upon Jewish occupations were imposed by Christian authorities. Local rulers and church officials closed many professions to Jews, pushing them into marginal roles considered socially inferior, such as tax and rent collecting and [[moneylending]], occupations only tolerated as a "necessary evil". Catholic doctrine at the time held that lending money for interest was a [[sin]], and it was an occupation forbidden to Christians. Not being subject to this restriction, insofar as loans to non-Jews were concerned, Jews made this business their own, despite possible criticism of [[Usury#Religious context|usury]] in the [[Torah]] and later sections of the [[Hebrew Bible]]. Unfortunately, this led to many negative stereotypes of Jews as insolent, greedy usurers and the understandable tensions between creditors (typically Jews) and debtors (typically Christians) added to social, political, religious, and economic strains. Peasants who were forced to pay their taxes to Jews could see them as personally taking their money while unaware of those on whose behalf these Jews worked.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Jews were subject to a wide range of legal [[Disabilities (Jewish)|disabilities]] and restrictions throughout the Middle Ages, some of which lasted until the end of the 19th century. Even moneylending and peddling were at times forbidden to them. The number of Jews permitted to reside in different places was limited; they were concentrated in [[ghettos]] and were not allowed to own land; they were subject to discriminatory taxes on entering cities or districts other than their own and were forced to swear special [[Oath More Judaico|Jewish Oaths]], and they suffered a variety of other measures. The [[Fourth Lateran Council]] in 1215 decreed that Jews and Muslims must wear distinguishing clothing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myjewishlearning.com/history_community/Medieval/MedievalSocialTO/Clothing/JewishHat.htm Medieval Jewish History: An Encyclopedia. Edited by Norman Roth, Routledge] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225013546/http://www.myjewishlearning.com/history_community/Medieval/MedievalSocialTO/Clothing/JewishHat.htm |date=2008-02-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common such clothing was the [[Jewish hat]], which was already worn by many Jews as a self-identifying mark, but was now often made compulsory.&lt;ref&gt;Françoise Piponnier and Perrine Mane; ''Dress in the Middle Ages''; p. 138, Yale UP, 1997; {{ISBN|0-300-06906-5}}.

[[Image:BritLibCottonNeroDiiFol183vPersecutedJews.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The yellow badge Jews were forced to wear can be seen in this marginal illustration from an English manuscript.]]
The [[Jewish badge]] was introduced in some places; it could be a coloured piece of cloth in the shape of a circle, strip, or the tablets of the law (in England), and was sewn onto the clothes.&lt;ref&gt;Schreckenburg, Heinz, ''The Jews in Christian Art'', pp. 15 &amp; passim, 1996, Continuum, New York, {{ISBN|0-8264-0936-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere special colours of robe were specified. Implementation was in the hands of local rulers but by the following century laws had been enacted covering most of Europe. In many localities, members of Medieval society wore badges to distinguish their social status. Some badges (such as those worn by [[guild]] members) were prestigious, while others were worn by ostracised outcasts such as lepers, reformed [[heresy|heretics]] and prostitutes. As with all [[sumptuary law]]s, the degree to which these laws were followed and enforced varied greatly. Sometimes, Jews sought to evade the badges by paying what amounted to bribes in the form of temporary "exemptions" to kings, which were revoked and re-paid for whenever the king needed to raise funds.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} By the end of the Middle Ages, the hat seems to have become rare, but the badge lasted longer and remained in some places until the 18th century.

===Crusades===
{{See also|German Crusade, 1096|History of the Jews and the Crusades|Siege of Jerusalem (1099)|Letter of the Karaite elders of Ascalon}}

The Crusades were a series of military campaigns sanctioned by the [[Papacy]] in Rome, which took place from the end of the 11th century until the 13th century. They began as endeavors to recapture Jerusalem from the Muslims but developed into territorial wars.

The [[People's Crusade]] that accompanied the First Crusade attacked Jewish communities in Germany, France, and England, and killed many Jews. Entire communities, like those of [[Treves]], [[Speyer]], [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], [[Mainz]], and [[Cologne]], were murdered by armed mobs. About 12,000 Jews are said to have perished in the [[Rhineland]] cities alone between May and July 1096. Before the Crusades, Jews had practically a monopoly on the trade in Eastern products, but the closer connection between Europe and the East brought about by the Crusades raised up a class of Christian merchant traders, and from this time onwards, restrictions on the sale of goods by Jews became frequent.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The religious zeal fomented by the Crusades at times burned as fiercely against Jews as against Muslims, although attempts were made by bishops during the first Crusade and by the papacy during the Second Crusade to stop Jews from being attacked. Both economically and socially, the Crusades were disastrous for European Jews. They prepared the way for the anti-Jewish legislation of [[Pope Innocent III]].

In the [[County of Toulouse]], in southern France, toleration and favour shown to Jews was one of the main complaints of the Roman Church against the Counts of Toulouse at the beginning of the 13th century. Organised and official persecution of the Jews became a normal feature of life in southern France only after the [[Albigensian Crusade]], because it was only then that the Church became powerful enough to insist that measures of discrimination be applied.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Costen, ''The Cathars and the Albigensian Crusade'', p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; In 1209, stripped to the waist and barefoot, Raymond VI of Toulouse was obliged to swear that he would no longer allow Jews to hold public office. In 1229 his son [[Raymond VII, Count of Toulouse|Raymond VII]] underwent a similar ceremony.

===Blood libels and host desecration===
{{Main article|blood libel|list of blood libels against Jews}}

On many occasions, Jews were accused of drinking the blood of Christian children in mockery of the Christian [[Eucharist]]. According to the authors of these so-called blood libels, the 'procedure' for the alleged sacrifice was something like this: a child who had not yet reached puberty was kidnapped and taken to a hidden place. The child would be tortured by Jews, and a crowd would gather at the place of execution (in some accounts the synagogue itself) and engage in a mock tribunal to try the child. The child would be presented to the tribunal naked and tied and eventually be condemned to death. In the end, the child would be crowned with thorns and tied or nailed to a wooden cross. The cross would be raised, and the blood dripping from the child's wounds would be caught in bowls or glasses and then drunk. Finally, the child would be killed with a thrust through the heart from a spear, sword, or dagger. Its dead body would be removed from the cross and concealed or disposed of, but in some instances rituals of [[black magic]] would be performed on it. This method, with some variations, can be found in all the alleged Christian descriptions of ritual murder by Jews.

[[Image:Descreationofhost.gif|thumb|A 15th-century German woodcut showing an alleged host desecration. In the first panel the hosts are stolen, in the second the hosts bleed when pierced by a Jew, in the third the Jews are arrested, and in the fourth they are burned alive]]

The story of [[William of Norwich]] (d. 1144) is often cited as the first known accusation of [[ritual murder]] against Jews. The Jews of [[Norwich]], England were accused of murder after a Christian boy, William, was found dead. It was claimed that the Jews had tortured and crucified him. The legend of William of Norwich became a cult, and the child acquired the status of a holy martyr.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, Gillian (2005), "Towards a revaluation of the legend of 'Saint' William of Norwich and its place in the blood libel legend". ''Folklore'', 116(2), pp. 119–21.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln]] (d. 1255), in the 13th century, reputedly had his belly cut open and his [[Disembowelment|entrails]] removed for some [[occult]] purpose, such as a [[haruspex|divination ritual]], after being taken from a cross. [[Simon of Trent]] (d. 1475), in the fifteenth, was held over a large bowl so that all his blood could be collected, it was alleged.

During the Middle Ages, such blood libels were directed against Jews in many parts of Europe. The believers of these accusations reasoned that the Jews, having crucified Jesus, continued to thirst for pure and innocent blood, at the expense of innocent Christian children.&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Sasson, H.H., Editor;  (1969). ''A History of The Jewish People''. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts. {{ISBN|0-674-39731-2}} (paper).&lt;/ref&gt; Jews were also sometimes falsely accused of desecrating consecrated [[Host (Holy Communion)|hosts]] in a reenactment of the [[Crucifixion]]; this crime was known as [[host desecration]] and carried the [[death penalty]].

===Expulsions from France and England===
{{Further information|History of the Jews in France|History of the Jews in England}}
The practice of expelling Jews, the confiscation of their property and further [[ransom]] for their return was utilized to enrich the French crown during the 13th and 14th centuries. The most notable such expulsions were from Paris by [[Philip Augustus of France|Philip Augustus]] in 1182, from the whole of France by [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] in 1254, by [[Charles IV of France|Charles IV]] in 1306, by [[Charles V of France|Charles V]] in 1322 and by [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]] in 1394.

To finance his [[Conquest of Wales by Edward I of England|war against Wales]] in 1276, [[Edward I of England]] taxed Jewish moneylenders. When the moneylenders could no longer pay the tax, they were accused of disloyalty. Already restricted to a limited number of occupations, Edward abolished their "privilege" to lend money, restricted their movements and activities and forced Jews to wear a [[Yellow badge|yellow patch]]. The heads of Jewish households were then arrested with over 300 being taken to the [[Tower of London]] and executed. Others were killed in their homes. All Jews were banished from the country in 1290,&lt;ref&gt;By the [[Edict of Expulsion]]&lt;/ref&gt; where it was possible that hundreds were killed or drowned while trying to leave the country.&lt;ref&gt;Prestwich, Michael (1997), Edward I, Yale University Press, {{ISBN|0-300-07157-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; All the money and property of these dispossessed Jews was confiscated. No Jews were known to be in England thereafter until 1655, when [[Oliver Cromwell]] reversed the policy.

===Expulsions from the Holy Roman Empire===
{{Further information|History of the Jews in Germany}}
In Germany, part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], persecutions and formal expulsions of the Jews were liable to occur at intervals, although it should be said that this was also the case for other minority communities, whether religious or ethnic. There were particular outbursts of riotous persecution in the [[Rhineland massacres]] of 1096 accompanying the lead-up to the First Crusade, many involving the crusaders as they travelled to the East. There were many local expulsions from cities by local rulers and city councils. The [[Holy Roman Emperor]] generally tried to restrain persecution, if only for economic reasons, but he was often unable to exert much influence. As late as 1519, the Imperial city of [[Regensburg]] took advantage of the recent death of [[Emperor Maximilian I]] to expel its 500 Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Christopher S., ''Albrecht Altdorfer and the Origins of Landscape'', p. 251, 1993, Reaktion Books, London, {{ISBN|0948462469}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this period the rulers of the eastern edges of Europe, in Poland, Lithuania and Hungary, were often receptive to Jewish settlement, and many Jews moved to these regions.&lt;ref name="Teacher's"&gt;{{cite web|title=Map of Jewish expulsions and resettlement areas in Europe|url=http://fcit.usf.edu/HOLOCAUST/gallery/expuls.htm|work=Florida Center for Instructional Technology, College of Education, University of South Florida|publisher=A Teacher's Guide to the Holocaust|accessdate=24 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Black Death===
{{Main article|Black Death Jewish persecutions}}
Hundreds of Jewish communities were destroyed by violence during the ravages of the Black Death, particularly in the Iberian peninsula and in the Germanic Empire. In [[Provence]], 40 Jews were burnt in [[Toulon]] as quickly after the outbreak as April 1348.&lt;ref name="Black"&gt;See Stéphane Barry and Norbert Gualde, ''La plus grande épidémie de l'histoire'' ("The greatest epidemic in history"), in ''[[L'Histoire]]'' magazine, n°310, June 2006, p. 47 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Never mind that Jews were not immune from the ravages of the plague; they were tortured until they "confessed" to crimes that they could not possibly have committed. In one such case, a man named Agimet was ... coerced to say that Rabbi Peyret of [[Chambéry]] (near [[Geneva]]) had ordered him to poison the wells in [[Venice]], [[Toulouse]], and elsewhere. In the aftermath of Agimet's "confession", the Jews of [[Strasbourg]] were burned alive on February 14, 1349."&lt;ref name=Hertzberg&gt;[[Arthur Hertzberg|Hertzberg, Arthur]] and Hirt-Manheimer, Aron.

===Spain and Portugal===
{{See also|Antisemitism in Spain}}
In the Catholic kingdoms of late medieval and early modern Spain, oppressive policies and attitudes led many Jews to embrace Christianity.&lt;ref name="Dan Cohn-Sherbok 2006"&gt;Dan Cohn-Sherbok (2006) ''The Paradox of Anti-Semitism'': p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; Such Jews were known as [[conversos]] or [[Marranos]].&lt;ref name="Dan Cohn-Sherbok 2006"/&gt; Suspicions that they might still secretly be adherents of Judaism led [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and [[Isabella I of Castile]] to institute the [[Spanish Inquisition]].&lt;ref name="Dan Cohn-Sherbok 2006"/&gt; The Inquisition used torture to elicit confessions and delivered judgment at public ceremonials known as ''[[Auto-da-fé|autos de fe]]'' before they gave their victims over to the secular authorities for punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Cohn-Sherbok (2006) ''The Paradox of Anti-Semitism'': pp. 167–69&lt;/ref&gt; Under this dispensation, some 30,000 were condemned to death and executed by being burnt alive.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Cohn-Sherbok (2006) ''The Paradox of Anti-Semitism'': p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; In 1492, Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile issued an [[Alhambra Decree|edict of expulsion]] of Jews from Spain, giving Jews four months to either convert to Christianity or leave the country.&lt;ref&gt;Rhea Marsh Smith (1965) ''Spain, A Modern History''. Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press: p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; Some 165,000 emigrated and some 50,000 converted to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Rhea Marsh Smith (1965) ''Spain, A Modern History''. Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press: p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;

Portugal followed suit in December 1496. However, those expelled could only leave the country in ships specified by the King. When those who chose to leave the country arrived at the port in Lisbon, they were met by clerics and soldiers who used force, coercion and promises to baptize them and prevent them from leaving the country. This episode technically ended the presence of Jews in Portugal. Afterwards, all converted Jews and their descendants would be referred to as [[New Christians]] or ''[[marrano]]''. They were given a grace period of thirty years during which no inquiry into their faith would be allowed. This period was later extended until 1534. However, a [[Lisbon massacre|popular riot in 1506]] resulted in the deaths of up to four or five thousand Jews, and the execution of the leaders of the riot by King [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel]]. Those labeled as New Christians were under the surveillance of the [[Portuguese Inquisition]] from 1536 until 1821.

Jewish refugees from Spain and Portugal, known as [[Sephardi Jews]] from the Hebrew word for Spain, fled to North Africa, Turkey and Palestine within the [[Ottoman Empire]], and to Holland, France and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Ronnie S. Landau (1992) ''The Nazi Holocaust''. IB Tauris, London and New York: p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Within the Ottoman Empire, Jews could openly practise their religion. [[Amsterdam]] in Holland also became a focus for settlement by the persecuted Jews from many lands in succeeding centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Cohn-Sherbok (2006) ''The Paradox of Anti-Semitism'': pp. 170–71&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-Judaism and the Reformation===
[[Image:1543 On the Jews and Their Lies by Martin Luther.jpg|thumb|180px|Luther's 1543 pamphlet ''[[On the Jews and Their Lies]]'']]
{{See also|Luther and antisemitism|Christianity and antisemitism}}
[[Martin Luther]], an [[Augustinian order|Augustinian friar]] and an [[ecclesiastical]] reformer whose teachings inspired the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], wrote antagonistically about Jews in his pamphlet ''[[On the Jews and Their Lies (Martin Luther)|On the Jews and Their Lies]]'', written in 1543. He portrays the Jews in extremely harsh terms, excoriates them and provides detailed recommendations for a [[pogrom]] against them, calling for their permanent oppression and expulsion. At one point he writes: "...we are at fault in not slaying them..." a passage that "may be termed the first work of modern antisemitism, and a giant step forward on the road to [[the Holocaust]]."&lt;ref name=Johnson&gt;[[Paul Johnson (writer)|Johnson, Paul]]. ''A History of the Jews'', HarperCollins Publishers, 1987, p. 242. {{ISBN|5-551-76858-9}}. [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Luther's harsh comments about the Jews are seen by many as a continuation of medieval [[Christianity and antisemitism|Christian antisemitism]]. Muslow and Popkin assert that, "the antisemitism of the early modern period was even worse than that of the Middle Ages; and nowhere was this more obvious than in those areas which roughly encompass modern-day Germany, especially among Lutherans."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Secret conversions to Judaism in early modern Europe |first=Martin |last=Mulsow  |first2=Richard Henry |last2=Popkin |publisher=BRILL |year=2004 |page=85 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Mjrni72sM-gC&amp;pg=PA85&amp;dq=antisemitism+%22early+modern+period%22#v=onepage&amp;q=antisemitism%20%22early%20modern%20period%22&amp;f=false|isbn=9004128832 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his final sermon shortly before his death, however, Luther preached: "We want to treat them with Christian love and to pray for them, so that they might become converted and would receive the Lord."&lt;ref name="Luther"&gt;[[Martin Luther|Luther, Martin]]. ''D. Martin Luthers Werke: kritische Gesamtausgabe'', Weimar: Hermann Böhlaus Nachfolger, 1920, Vol. 51, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canonization of Simon of Trent===
[[Simon of Trent]] was a boy from the city of [[Trento]], Italy, who was found dead at the age of two in 1475, having allegedly been kidnapped, mutilated, and drained of blood. His disappearance was blamed on the leaders of the city's Jewish community, based on confessions extracted under torture, in a case that fueled the rampant antisemitism of the time. Simon was regarded as a saint, and was canonized by [[Pope Sixtus V]] in 1588.

==Seventeenth century==
In the mid-17th century, [[Peter Stuyvesant]], the last Dutch Director-General of the colony of [[New Amsterdam]], later New York City, sought to bolster the position of the [[Dutch Reformed Church]] by trying to stem the religious influence of Jews, [[Lutheran]]s, Catholics and [[Quakers]]. He stated that Jews were "deceitful", "very repugnant", and "hateful enemies and blasphemers of the name of Christ". However, religious plurality was already a cultural tradition and a legal obligation in New Amsterdam and in the Netherlands, and his superiors at the [[Dutch West India Company]] in [[Amsterdam]] overruled him.

During the mid-to-late-17th century the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] was devastated by several conflicts, in which the Commonwealth lost over a third of its population (over 3 million people). The decrease of the [[History of Jews in Poland|Jewish population]] during that period is estimated at 100,000 to 200,000, including emigration, deaths from diseases and captivity in the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;"Bogdan Chmelnitzki leads Cossack uprising against Polish rule; 100,000 Jews are killed and hundreds of Jewish communities are destroyed."

''Holocaust Journey: Traveling in Search of the Past'', Columbia University Press, 1999, {{ISBN|0-231-10965-2}}, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; These conflicts began in 1648 when [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]] instigated the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]] against the Polish aristocracy and the Jews who administered their estates.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Cohn-Sherbok (2006) ''The Paradox of Anti-Semitism'': p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; Khmelnytsky's [[Cossack]]s massacred tens of thousands of Jews in the eastern and southern areas that he controlled (now Ukraine). This persecution led many Jews to pin their hopes on a man called [[Shabbatai Zevi]] who emerged in the Ottoman Empire at this time and proclaimed himself [[Messiah]] in 1665. However his later conversion to Islam dashed these hopes and led many Jews to discredit the traditional belief in the coming of the Messiah as the hope of salvation.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Cohn-Sherbok (2006) ''The Paradox of Anti-Semitism'': pp. 175–81&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Zaydi]] imamate of [[Yemen]], Jews were also singled out for discrimination in the 17th century, which culminated in the general expulsion of all Jews from places in Yemen to the arid coastal plain of [[Tihamah]] and which became known as the [[Mawza Exile]].&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Qafiḥ, ''Ketavim'' (''Collected Papers''), Vol. 2, Jerusalem 1989, pp. 714–716 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eighteenth century==
In many European countries the 18th century "[[Age of Enlightenment]]" saw the dismantling of archaic corporate, hierarchical forms of society in favour of individual equality of citizens before the law. How this new state of affairs would affect previously autonomous, though subordinated, Jewish communities became known as the [[Jewish question]]. In many countries, enhanced civil rights were gradually extended to the Jews, though often only in a partial form and on condition that the Jews abandon many aspects of their previous identity in favour of integration and assimilation with the dominant society.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Beller (2007) ''Antisemitism: A Very Short Introduction'': pp. 23–27&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Arnold Ages, Voltaire's "Lettres philosophiques, Dictionnaire philosophique, and Candide, to name but a few of his better known works, are saturated with comments on Jews and Judaism and the vast majority are negative".&lt;ref&gt;Ages Arnold. "Tainted Greatness: The Case of Voltaire's Anti-Semitism: The Testimony of the Correspondence." ''Neohelicon'' 21.2 (Sept. 1994): 361.&lt;/ref&gt; Paul H. Meyer adds: "There is no question but that Voltaire, particularly in his latter years, nursed a violent hatred of the Jews and it is equally certain that his animosity...did have a considerable impact on public opinion in France."&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, Paul H. "The Attitude of the Enlightenment Toward the Jew." ''Studies on Voltaire and the Eighteenth Century'', 26 (1963): 1177.&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty of the 118 articles in Voltaire's ''[[Dictionnaire philosophique]]'' concerned Jews and described them in consistently negative ways.&lt;ref&gt;[[Léon Poliakov|Poliakov, L]]. ''The History of Anti-Semitism: From Voltaire to Wagner''. Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, Ltd., 1975 (translated). pp. 88–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1744, [[Frederick II of Prussia]] limited the number of Jews allowed to live in [[Breslau]] to only ten so-called "protected" Jewish families and encouraged a similar practice in other [[Prussia]]n cities. In 1750 he issued the ''Revidiertes General Privilegium und Reglement vor die Judenschaft'': forcing these "protected" Jews to "either abstain from marriage or leave Berlin."&lt;ref&gt;quoting [[Simon Dubnow]])&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, Archduchess of Austria [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] ordered Jews out of [[Bohemia]] but soon reversed her position, on condition that they pay for their readmission every ten years. This was known as ''malke-geld'' (queen's money). In 1752 she introduced a law limiting each Jewish family to one son. In 1782, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] abolished most of these practices in his ''[[Toleranzpatent]]'', on the condition that [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] were eliminated from public records and that judicial autonomy was annulled.

In accordance with the anti-Jewish precepts of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]],&lt;ref&gt;Steven Beller (2007) ''Antisemitism: A Very Short Introduction'': p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Russia's discriminatory policies towards Jews intensified when the [[partition of Poland]] in the 18th century resulted, for the first time in Russian history, in the possession of land with a large population of Jews.&lt;ref name="Steven Beller 2007"&gt;Steven Beller (2007) ''Antisemitism: A Very Short Introduction'': p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; This land was designated as the [[Pale of Settlement]] from which Jews were forbidden to migrate into the interior of Russia.&lt;ref name="Steven Beller 2007"/&gt; In 1772, the empress of Russia [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]] forced the Jews of the Pale of Settlement to stay in their [[shtetls]] and forbade them from returning to the towns that they occupied before the partition of Poland.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Poland.html The Virtual Jewish History Tour By Rebecca Weiner]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nineteenth century==
Following legislation supporting the equality of French Jews with other citizens during the [[French Revolution]], similar laws promoting [[Jewish emancipation]] were enacted in the early 19th century in those parts of Europe over which France had influence.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Webster (2001) ''Petain's Crime''. London, Pan Books: 13, 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dan Cohn-Sherbok (2006) ''The Paradox of Anti-Semitism''. Continuum: 44–46&lt;/ref&gt; The old laws restricting them to [[Jewish quarter (diaspora)|ghettos]], as well as the many laws that limited their property rights, rights of worship and occupation, were rescinded.

===Catholic counter-revolution===
Despite this, traditional discrimination and hostility to Jews on religious grounds persisted and was supplemented by [[racial antisemitism]], encouraged by the work of racial theorists such as the royalist [[Joseph Arthur de Gobineau]] and particularly his ''Essay on the Inequality of the Human Race'' of 1853–55. Nationalist agendas based on ethnicity, known as [[ethnonationalism]], usually excluded the Jews from the national community as an alien race.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Beller (2007) ''Antisemitism: A Very Short Introduction'': 64&lt;/ref&gt; Allied to this were theories of [[Social Darwinism]], which stressed a putative conflict between higher and lower races of human beings. Such theories, usually posited by white Europeans, advocated the superiority of white [[Aryan]]s to [[Semitic people|Semitic]] Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Beller (2007) ''Antisemitism: A Very Short Introduction'': pp. 57–59&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[counter-revolutionary]] Catholic royalist [[Louis de Bonald]] stands out among the earliest figures to explicitly call for the reversal of Jewish emancipation in the wake of the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name="Battini1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Socialism of Fools: Capitalism and Modern Anti-Semitism|last=Battini|first=Michele|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=2–7 and 30–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Katz |first1=Jacob |title=From Prejudice to Destruction: Anti-Semitism, 1700-1933 |date=1980 |publisher=Harvard University Press |pages=112-115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonald's attacks on the Jews are likely to have influenced [[Napoléon Bonaparte|Napoleon]]'s decision to limit the civil rights of [[Alsace|Alsatian]] Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Socialism of Fools: Capitalism and Modern Anti-Semitism|last=Battini|first=Michele|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Garṭner |first1=Aryeh |last2=Gartner |first2=Lloyd P. |title=History of the Jews in Modern Times |date=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Joskowicz |first1=Ari |title=The Modernity of Others: Jewish Anti-Catholicism in Germany and France |date=2013 |publisher=Stanford University Press |page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Michael |first1=Robert |last2=Rosen |first2=Philip |title=Dictionary of Antisemitism from the Earliest Times to the Present |date=2007 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonald's article ''Sur les juifs'' (1806) was one of the most venomous screeds of its era and furnished a paradigm which combined [[anti-liberalism]],  traditional Christian antisemitism, and the identification of Jews with bankers and finance capital, which would in turn influence many subsequent right-wing reactionaries such as [[Roger Gougenot des Mousseaux]], [[Charles Maurras]], and [[Édouard Drumont]], nationalists such as [[Maurice Barrès]] and [[Paolo Orano]], and antisemitic socialists such as [[Alphonse Toussenel]].&lt;ref name="Battini1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sanos |first1=Sandrine |title=The Aesthetics of Hate: Far-Right Intellectuals, Antisemitism, and Gender in 1930s France |date=2012 |publisher=Stanford University Press |page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Laqueur |first1=Walter |last2=Baumel |first2=Judith Tydor |title=The Holocaust Encyclopedia |date=2001 |publisher=Yale University Press |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonald furthermore declared that the Jews were an "alien" people, a "state within a state", and should be forced to wear a distinctive mark to more easily identify and discriminate against them.&lt;ref name="Battini1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Michael1" /&gt;

In the 1840s, the popular counter-revolutionary Catholic journalist [[Louis Veuillot]] propagated Bonald's arguments against the Jewish "financial aristocracy" along with vicious attacks against the Talmud and the Jews as a "deicidal people" driven by hatred to "enslave" Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Graetz |first1=Michael |title=The Jews in Nineteenth-century France: From the French Revolution to the Alliance Israélite Universelle |date=1996 |publisher=Stanford University Press |page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Michael1"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Michael |first1=Robert |title=A History of Catholic Antisemitism: The Dark Side of the Church |date=2008 |publisher=Springer |pages=128–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gougenot des Mousseaux's ''Le Juif, le judaïsme et la judaïsation des peuples chrétiens'' (1869) has been called a "Bible of modern antisemitism" and was translated into German by Nazi ideologue [[Alfred Rosenberg]].&lt;ref name="Michael1" /&gt; 

In Italy, the Jesuit priest [[Antonio Bresciani (writer)|Antonio Bresciani]]'s highly popular novel 1850 novel ''L'Ebreo di Verona'' (The Jew of Verona) shaped religious antisemitism for decades, as did his work for ''[[La Civiltà Cattolica]]'', which he helped launch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brustein |first1=William |title=Roots of Hate: Anti-Semitism in Europe Before the Holocaust |date=2003 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Feinstein |first1=Wiley |title=The Civilization of the Holocaust in Italy: Poets, Artists, Saints, Anti-semites |date=2003 |publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press |pages=151-152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civil rights granted to Jews in Germany, following the occupation of that country by the French under [[Napoleon]], were rescinded after his defeat. Pleas to retain them by diplomats at the [[Congress of Vienna]] peace conference (1814–5) were unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Cohn-Sherbok (2006) ''The Paradox of Anti-Semitism''. Continuum: 46&lt;/ref&gt; In 1819, German Jews were attacked in the [[Hep-Hep riots]].&lt;ref&gt;Dan Cohn-Sherbok (2006) ''The Paradox of Anti-Semitism''. Continuum: 47&lt;/ref&gt; Full [[Jewish emancipation]] was not granted in Germany until 1871, when the country was united under the [[Hohenzollern dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Dan Cohn-Sherbok (2006) ''The Paradox of Anti-Semitism''. Continuum: p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1850, the German composer [[Richard Wagner]] published ''[[Das Judenthum in der Musik]]'' ("Jewishness in Music") under a [[pseudonym]] in the ''[[Neue Zeitschrift für Musik]]''. The essay began as an attack on Jewish composers, particularly Wagner's contemporaries (and rivals) [[Felix Mendelssohn]] and [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]], but expanded to accuse Jewish influences more widely of being a harmful and alien element in [[Culture of Germany|German culture]].

The term "antisemitism" was coined by the German agitator and publicist, [[Wilhelm Marr]] in 1879. In that year, Marr founded the Antisemites League and published a book called ''Victory of Jewry over Germandom''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Steven Beller (2007) ''Antisemitism: A Very Short Introduction'': 28–29&lt;/ref&gt; The late 1870s saw the growth of antisemitic political parties in Germany. These included the [[Christian Social Party (Germany)|Christian Social Party]], founded in 1878 by [[Adolf Stoecker]], the Lutheran chaplain to [[William I, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm I]], as well as the [[German Social Anti-Semitic Party|German Social Antisemitic Party]] and the [[Antisemitic People's Party]]. However, they did not enjoy mass electoral support and at their peak in 1907, had only 16 deputies out of a total of 397 in the parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Ronnie S. Landau (1992) ''The Nazi Holocaust''. IB Tauris, London and New York: pp. 82–83&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
The defeat of France in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] (1870–71) was blamed by some on the Jews. Jews were accused of weakening the national spirit through association with [[republicanism]], [[capitalism]] and [[anti-clericalism]], particularly by authoritarian, right wing, clerical and royalist groups. These accusations were spread in antisemitic journals such as ''[[La Libre Parole]]'', founded by [[Edouard Drumont]] and ''[[La Croix]]'', the organ of the Catholic order of the [[Assumptionists]]. Between 1882 and 1886 alone, French priests published twenty antisemitic books blaming France's ills on the Jews and urging the government to consign them back to the ghettos, expel them, or hang them from the gallows.&lt;ref name="Michael1" /&gt; 

Financial scandals such as the collapse of the Union Generale Bank and the [[Panama scandals|collapse of the French Panama Canal operation]] were also blamed on the Jews. The [[Dreyfus affair]] saw a Jewish military officer named Captain [[Alfred Dreyfus]] falsely accused of treason in 1895 by his army superiors and sent to [[Devil's Island]] after being convicted. Dreyfus was acquitted in 1906, but the case polarised French opinion between antisemitic authoritarian nationalists and [[philosemitism|philosemitic]] anti-clerical republicans, with consequences which were to resonate into the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Webster (2001) ''Petain's Crime''. London, Pan Books: pp. 23–27&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
[[Image:18960415 antisemitic political cartoon in Sound Money.jpg|thumb|left|Antisemitic political cartoon from the [[United States presidential election, 1896]]]]

Between 1881 and 1920, approximately three million [[Ashkenazi Jews]] from Eastern Europe migrated to America, many of them fleeing pogroms and the difficult economic conditions which were widespread in much of Eastern Europe during this time. Pogroms in Eastern Europe, particularly Russia, prompted waves of Jewish immigrants after 1881. Jews, along with many Eastern and Southern European immigrants, came to work the country's growing mines and factories. Many Americans distrusted these Jewish immigrants.&lt;ref name=Perednik&gt;{{cite web |first=Gustavo |last=Perednik |title=Judeophobia – History and analysis of Antisemitism, Jew-Hate and anti-"Zionism" |url=http://www.zionism-israel.com/his/judeophobia11.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earlier wave of Jewish immigration from Germany, the latter (post 1880) came from "the Pale" – the region of Eastern Poland, Russia and the Ukraine where Jews had suffered under the Czars. Along with Italians, Irish and other Eastern and Southern Europeans, Jews faced discrimination in the United States in employment, education and social advancement. American groups like the [[Immigration Restriction League]], criticized these new arrivals along with immigrants from Asia and southern and eastern Europe, as culturally, intellectually, morally, and biologically inferior. Despite these attacks, very few Eastern European Jews returned to Europe for whatever privations they faced, their situation in the U.S. was still improved.

Beginning in the early 1880s, declining farm prices also prompted elements of the [[People's Party (United States)|Populist movement]] to blame the perceived evils of capitalism and industrialism on Jews because of their alleged racial/religious inclination for financial exploitation and, more specifically, because of the alleged financial manipulations of Jewish financiers such as the [[Rothschild family|Rothschilds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Conspiracy theories in American history: an encyclopedia, Volume 1 |first=Peter |last=Knight|publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2003|page=82|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qMIDrggs8TsC&amp;pg=PA82&amp;dq=Jews+Banking#v=onepage&amp;q=Jews%20Banking&amp;f=false|isbn=9781576078129 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Jews played only a minor role in the nation's commercial banking system, the prominence of Jewish investment bankers such as the Rothschilds in Europe, and [[Jacob Schiff]], of [[Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Co.]] in New York City, made the claims of antisemites believable to some. The Morgan Bonds scandal injected populist antisemitism into the [[United States presidential election, 1896|1896 presidential campaign]]. It was disclosed that President [[Grover Cleveland]] had sold bonds to a syndicate which included [[J. P. Morgan]] and the Rothschilds house, bonds which that syndicate was now selling for a profit. The Populists used it as an opportunity to uphold their view of history, and prove to the nation that Washington and Wall Street were in the hands of the international Jewish banking houses.

Another focus of antisemitic feeling was the allegation that Jews were at the center of an international conspiracy to fix the currency and thus the economy to a single gold standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=America, religions and religion |first=Catherine L.|last=Albanese|publisher=Wadsworth Pub. Co. |year=1981 |quote=By the 1890s anti-Semitic feeling had crystallized around the suspicion that the Jews were responsible for an international conspiracy to base the economy on the single gold standard.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
Long-standing repressive policies and attitudes towards the Jews in Russia were intensified after the assassination of [[Tsar Alexander II]] on 13 March 1881. This event was blamed on the Jews and sparked widespread [[anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire]] which lasted for three years.&lt;ref name="John Roth 1887"&gt;Richard Rubenstein and John Roth (1987) ''Approaches to Auschwitz''. London, SCM Press: 96&lt;/ref&gt; A hardening of official attitudes under [[Tsar Alexander III]] and his ministers, resulted in the [[May Laws]] of 1882, which severely [[Antisemitism in the Russian Empire|restricted the civil rights of Jews within the Russian Empire]]. The Tsar's minister [[Konstantin Petrovich Pobedonostsev]] stated that the aim of the government with regard to the Jews was that: "One third will die out, one third will leave the country and one third will be completely dissolved [into] the surrounding population".&lt;ref name="John Roth 1887"/&gt; In the event, a mix of pogroms and repressive legislation did indeed result in the mass emigration of Jews to western Europe and America. Between 1881 and the outbreak of the First World War, an estimated two and half million Jews left Russia – one of the largest mass migrations in recorded history.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ronnie S. Landau (1992) ''The Nazi Holocaust''. IB Tauris, London and New York: p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Muslim world===
Historian [[Martin Gilbert]] writes that it was in the 19th century that the position of Jews worsened in Muslim countries.&lt;ref name=Gilbert179&gt;[[Martin Gilbert|Gilbert, Martin]]. ''Dearest Auntie Fori. The Story of the Jewish People''. HarperCollins, 2002, pp. 179–82.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gilbert180&gt;[[Martin Gilbert|Gilbert, Martin]]. ''Letters to Auntie Fori: The 5,000-Year History of the Jewish People and Their Faith'', HarperCollins, 2002, pp. 179–82.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Mark R. Cohen|Mark Cohen]] in ''The Oxford Handbook of Jewish Studies'', most scholars conclude that Arab antisemitism in the modern world arose in the nineteenth century, against the backdrop of conflicting Jewish and Arab nationalism, and was imported into the Arab world primarily by nationalistically minded [[Arab Christians|Christian Arabs]] (and only subsequently was it "Islamized").&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark R. Cohen|Mark Cohen]](2002), p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; There was a massacre of Jews in [[Baghdad]] in 1828.&lt;ref name=Morris10&gt;[[Benny Morris|Morris, Benny]]. ''Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881–2001''. Vintage Books, 2001, pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1839, in the eastern Persian city of [[Meshed]], a mob burst into the Jewish Quarter, burned the synagogue and destroyed the [[Sefer Torah|Torah scrolls]], and it was only by forced conversion that a massacre was averted.&lt;ref name="Gilbert179"/&gt; There was a massacre of Jews in [[Babol|Barfurush]] in 1867.&lt;ref name=Morris10/&gt;

Concerning the life of [[Persian Jews]] in the middle of the 19th century, a contemporary author wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;...they are obliged to live in a separate part of town... for they are considered as unclean creatures... Under the pretext of their being unclean, they are treated with the greatest severity and should they enter a street, inhabited by Mussulmans, they are pelted by the boys and mobs with stones and dirt...  For the same reason, they are prohibited to go out when it rains; for it is said the rain would wash dirt off them, which would sully the feet of the Mussulmans...  If a Jew is recognized as such in the streets, he is subjected to the greatest insults.  The passers-by spit in his face, and sometimes beat him... unmercifully...  If a Jew enters a shop for anything, he is forbidden to inspect the goods... Should his hand incautiously touch the goods, he must take them at any price the seller chooses to ask for them.&lt;ref&gt;[[J. J. Benjamin]]. In: Lewis, Bernard, 1984. ''The Jews of Islam''. Princeton University Press, pp. 181–83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1840, in the [[Damascus affair]], the [[History of the Jews in Syria|Jews of Damascus]] were falsely accused of having ritually murdered a Christian monk and his Muslim servant and of having [[blood libel|used their blood]] to bake [[Matzo|Passover bread]]. A Jewish barber was tortured until he "confessed" to this crime; two other Jews who were arrested died under torture, while a third converted to Islam to save his life.

In 1864, around 500 Jews were killed in [[Marrakech]] and [[Fes, Morocco|Fez]] in Morocco. In 1869, 18 Jews were killed in [[Tunis]], and an Arab mob looted Jewish homes and stores, and burned synagogues, on [[Djerba|Jerba Island]]. Jews in Morocco were attacked and killed in the streets in broad daylight. In 1891, the leading Muslims in Jerusalem asked the Ottoman authorities in [[Constantinople]] to prohibit the entry of Jews arriving from Russia.&lt;ref name=Gilbert179/&gt;

One symbol of Jewish degradation was the phenomenon of stone-throwing at Jews by Muslim children. A 19th-century traveler observed: "I have seen a little fellow of six years old, with a troop of fat toddlers of only three and four, teaching [them] to throw stones at a Jew, and one little urchin would, with the greatest coolness, waddle up to the man and literally spit upon his Jewish [[gaberdine]]. To all this the Jew is obliged to submit; it would be more than his life was worth to offer to strike a Mahommedan."&lt;ref name=Morris10 /&gt;

==Twentieth century==
In the 20th century, antisemitism and Social Darwinism culminated in a systematic campaign of [[genocide]], called the [[Holocaust]], in which some six million Jews were exterminated in [[German-occupied Europe]] between 1942 and 1945 under the National Socialist regime of [[Adolf Hitler]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard L. Rubenstein and John K. Roth (1987) ''Approaches to Auschwitz''. SCM Press&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
[[Image:1904 Russian Tsar-Stop your cruel oppression of the Jews-LOC hh0145s.jpg|thumb|right|360px|Russian Tsar-Stop your cruel oppression of the Jews! (1904)]]
In Russia, under the Tsarist regime, antisemitism intensified in the early years of the 20th century and was given official favour when the secret police forged the notorious ''[[Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'', a document purported to be a transcription of a plan by Jewish elders to achieve [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|global domination]].&lt;ref&gt;Steven Beller (2007) ''Antisemitism: A Very Short Introduction'': p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Violence against the Jews in the [[Kishinev pogrom]] in 1903 was continued after the 1905 revolution by the activities of the [[Black Hundreds]].&lt;ref&gt;Steven Beller (2007) ''Antisemitism: A Very Short Introduction'': p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Menahem Mendel Beilis|Beilis Trial]] of 1913 showed that it was possible to revive the blood libel accusation in Russia.

The 1917 revolution ended official discrimination against the Jews but was followed, however, by massive anti-Jewish violence by the anti-[[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] [[White Army]] and the forces of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]. From 1918–21, between 100,000 and 150,000 Jews were slaughtered.&lt;ref&gt;Ronnie S. Landau (1992) ''The Nazi Holocaust''. IB Tauris, London and New York: 72&lt;/ref&gt; White emigres from revolutionary Russia fostered the idea that the Bolshevik regime, with its many Jewish members, was a front for the Jewish World Conspiracy, outlined in the ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion|Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'', which had by now achieved wide circulation in the west.&lt;ref&gt;[[Norman Cohn|Cohn, Norman]]: ''Warrant for Genocide'', 1967 (Eyre &amp; Spottiswoode)&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
In France, antisemitic agitation was promoted by right-wing groups such as [[Action Française]], founded by [[Charles Maurras]]. These groups were critical of the whole political establishment of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]]. Following the [[Stavisky Affair]], in which a Jewish man named [[Serge Alexandre Stavisky]] was revealed to be involved in high-level political corruption, these groups encouraged serious rioting which almost toppled the government in the [[6 February 1934 crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Webster (2001) ''Petain's Crime''. London, Pan: pp. 36–37&lt;/ref&gt; The rise to prominence of the Jewish socialist [[Léon Blum]], who became prime minister of the [[Popular Front Government]] in 1936, further polarised opinion within France. Action Française and other right-wing groups launched a vicious antisemitic press campaign against Blum which culminated in an attack in which he was dragged from his car and kicked and beaten whilst a mob screamed 'Death to the Jew!'&lt;ref&gt;Paul Webster (2001) ''Petain's Crime''. London, Pan: pp. 38–43&lt;/ref&gt; Catholic writers such as [[Ernest Jouin]], who published the ''Protocols'' in French, seamlessly blended racial and religious anti-Semitism, as in his statement that "from the triple viewpoint of race, of nationality, and of religion, the Jew has become the enemy of humanity."&lt;ref name="Michael"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Michael |first1=R. |title=A History of Catholic Antisemitism: The Dark Side of the Church |date=2008 |publisher=Springer |page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Pius XI]] praised Jouin for "combating our mortal [Jewish] enemy" and appointed him to high papal office as a [[protonotary apostolic]].&lt;ref name="Marks"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Marks |first1=Steven Gary |title=How Russia Shaped the Modern World: From Art to Anti-semitism, Ballet to Bolshevism |date=2003 |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Michael" /&gt;

Antisemitism was particularly virulent in [[Vichy France]] during [[World War II]]. The Vichy government openly collaborated with the Nazi occupiers to identify Jews for deportation and transportation to the death camps (about 75.000 were killed). The antisemitic demands of right-wing groups were implemented under the collaborating Vichy regime of Marshal [[Philippe Pétain]], following the defeat of the French by the German army in 1940. A [[Vichy laws on the status of Jews|law on the status of Jews]] of that year, followed by another in 1941, purged Jews from employment in administrative, civil service and judicial posts, from most professions and even from the entertainment industry – restricting them, mostly, to menial jobs. Vichy's officials aided and abetted the Nazis in arresting and transporting over seventy-three thousand Jews to their deaths in the [[extermination camps]] in Nazi-occupied Poland.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Webster (2001) ''Petain's Crime''. London, Pan.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nazism and the Holocaust===

In Germany, following World War I, [[Nazism]] arose as a political movement incorporating racially antisemitic ideas, expressed by Adolf Hitler in his book ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' ({{lang-de|My Struggle}}). After Hitler came to power in 1933, the Nazi regime sought the systematic exclusion of Jews from national life. Jews were demonized as the driving force of both international [[Marxism]] and capitalism. The [[Nuremberg Laws]] of 1935 outlawed marriage or sexual relationships between Jews and non-Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Kitchen (2007) ''The Third Reich: A Concise History'': pp. 128–29&lt;/ref&gt; Antisemitic propaganda by or on behalf of the Nazi Party began to pervade society. Especially virulent in this regard was [[Julius Streicher]]'s pornographic publication ''[[Der Stürmer]]'', which published the alleged sexual misdemeanors of Jews for popular consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Kitchen (2007) ''The Third Reich: A Concise History'': pp. 126–27&lt;/ref&gt; Mass violence against the Jews was encouraged by the Nazi regime, and on the night of 9–10 November 1938, dubbed [[Kristallnacht]], the regeme sanctioned the killing of Jews, the destruction of property and the torching of synagogues.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw (2008) ''Fateful Choices'': pp. 441–44&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Buchenwald Corpses 60623.jpg|A wagon piled high with corpses outside the crematorium in the newly liberated [[Buchenwald concentration camp]]|thumb]]

As Nazi occupation extended eastwards in World War II, antisemitic laws, agitation and propaganda were brought to occupied Europe,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.yadvashem.org/yv/en/holocaust/about/02/expansion.asp?WT.mc_id=wiki Expansion of German Conquest and Policy Towards Jews] on the [[Yad Vashem]] website&lt;/ref&gt; often building on local antisemitic traditions.

Tempus.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]] in 1941, a campaign of mass murder in that country was conducted against Soviet Jews by Nazi death squads called the ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.yadvashem.org/yv/en/holocaust/barbarossa/index.asp?WT.mc_id=wiki From Persecution to Mass Murder: Marking 70 Years to Operation Barbarossa] on the [[Yad Vashem]] website&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 January 1942, [[Reinhard Heydrich]], deputed to find a "[[Final Solution|final solution to the Jewish question]]", chaired the [[Wannsee Conference]] at which all the Jews resident in Europe and North Africa were earmarked for extermination.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Kitchen (2007) ''The Third Reich: A Concise History'': pp. 180–82&lt;/ref&gt; Of the eleven million who were targeted, some six million men, women and children were killed by the Nazis between 1942 and 1945.

''The War Against The Jews, 1933–1945''. New York : Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; To implement this plan, Jews were transported to purpose-built [[extermination camps]] in occupied Poland, where they were killed in [[gas chambers]]. Extermination camps were located at [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz-Birkenau]], [[Chełmno extermination camp|Chełmno]], [[Bełżec extermination camp|Bełżec]], [[Majdanek]], [[Sobibor extermination camp|Sobibór]] and [[Treblinka extermination camp|Treblinka]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fcit.usf.edu/holocaust/timeline/camps.htm Holocaust Timeline: The Camps]&lt;/ref&gt; These camps accounted for about half of the total number of killed Jews.

===United States===

Between 1900 and 1924, approximately 1.75 million Jews migrated to America's shores, the bulk from Eastern Europe. Where before 1900, American Jews never amounted even to 1 percent of America's total population, by 1930 Jews formed about 3½ percent. This dramatic increase and the upward mobility of some Jews was accompanied by a resurgence of antisemitism.

In the first half of the 20th century, Jews in the United States faced discrimination in employment, in access to residential and resort areas, in the membership of clubs and organizations and in tightened quotas on Jewish enrollment and teaching positions in colleges and universities. Some sources state that the conviction (and later lynching) of [[Leo Frank]], which turned a spotlight on antisemitism in the United States, also led to the formation of the [[Anti-Defamation League]] in October 1913. However, [[Abraham Foxman|Abraham H. Foxman]], the organization's National Director, disputes this, stating that American Jews simply needed an institution to combat antisemitism. Social tension during this period also led to renewed support for the [[Ku Klux Klan]], which had been inactive since 1870.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Deborah Dash|title=B'nai B'rith and the Challenge of Ethnic Leadership|year=1981|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0873954808|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jews in American Politics: Essays|year=2001|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0742501812|page=105|author=Jerome A.

[[Antisemitism in the United States]] reached its peak during the 1920s and 1930s. The pioneer automobile manufacturer [[Henry Ford]] propagated antisemitic ideas in his newspaper ''[[The Dearborn Independent]]''. The pioneer aviator [[Charles Lindbergh]] and many other prominent Americans led the [[America First Committee]] in opposing any involvement in the new war in Europe. Although America First avoided any appearance of antisemitism and voted to drop Henry Ford as a member for this reason. Lindbergh gave a speech in Des Moines, Iowa in which he expressed the decidedly Ford-like view that: "The three most important groups which have been pressing this country towards war are the British, the Jews, and the Roosevelt Administration."&lt;ref name=Lee1980p126&gt;Albert Lee. "Henry Ford and the Jews". Stein and Day. 1980. p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; In his diary Lindbergh wrote: "We must limit to a reasonable amount the Jewish influence... Whenever the Jewish percentage of the total population becomes too high, a reaction seems to invariably occur. It is too bad because a few Jews of the right type are, I believe, an asset to any country."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Zx7B3Ead0RMC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;lpg=PA89&amp;dq=%22Whenever+the+Jewish+percentage+of+total+population+becomes+too+high%22+Christians+%26+Jews+faith+to+faith&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dhSf25fDyz&amp;sig=IFQ9B9JVPMn3mID9fV6MPJk5i7A&amp;hl=es-419&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UVdNT8iKA6OPsQLN1Pwf&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Whenever%20the%20Jewish%20percentage%20of%20total%20population%20becomes%20too%20high%22%20Christians%20%26%20Jews%20faith%20to%20faith&amp;f=false Christians &amp; Jews Faith to Faith: Tragic History, Promising Present, Fragile Future] by James Ruddin (19 November 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[German American Bund]] held parades in the late 1930s which featured Nazi uniforms and flags with [[swastika]]s alongside American flags. Some 20,000 people listened to Bund leader [[Fritz Julius Kuhn]] at [[Madison Square Garden]] in 1939 criticizing President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] by repeatedly referring to him as "Frank D. Rosenfeld" and calling his [[New Deal]] the "Jew Deal". By espousing a belief in the existence of a [[Bolshevik]]–Jewish conspiracy in America, Kuhn's activities came under the scrutiny of the US House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) and when the United States entered World War II most of the Bund's members were placed in [[internment camp]]s, and some were deported at the end of the war. 

he United States did not provide for entry of the [[MS St. Louis|MS ''St. Louis'']] refugees in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/stlouis.html ''The Tragedy of the S.S.

===Eastern Europe after World War II===

Antisemitism in the Soviet Union reached a peak in 1948–1953 when several hundred Yiddish-writing poets, writers, painters and sculptors [[Night of the Murdered Poets|were killed]] in a purge campaign against the so-called [[rootless cosmopolitan]]s. This culminated in the so-called [[Doctors' Plot]] and largely ended with the death of Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]].

===United States after World War II===
During the early 1980s, isolationists on the far right made overtures to anti-war activists on the left in the United States to join forces against government policies in areas where they shared concerns.&lt;ref name=berletzog&gt;[[Chip Berlet|Berlet, Chip]].

Towards the end of 1990, as the movement against the [[Gulf War]] began to build, a number of [[far-right]] and antisemitic groups sought out alliances with left-wing anti-war coalitions, who began to speak openly about a "[[Jewish lobby]]" that was encouraging the United States to invade the Middle East. This idea evolved into conspiracy theories about a "[[Zionist Occupation Government|Zionist-occupied government]]" (ZOG), which has been seen as equivalent to ''The Protocols of the Elders of Zion''.&lt;ref name=berletzog/&gt;

The first years of the 21st century have seen an upsurge of antisemitism. Several authors such as [[Robert S.

In 2004, the United Kingdom set up an all-Parliamentary inquiry into antisemitism, which published its findings in 2006. The inquiry stated that: "Until recently, the prevailing opinion both within the Jewish community and beyond [had been] that antisemitism had receded to the point that it existed only on the margins of society." However, it found a reversal of this progress since 2000 and aimed to investigate the problem, identify the sources of contemporary antisemitism and make recommendations to improve the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Antisemitism|url=http://thepcaa.org/Report.pdf|date=September 2006|accessdate=14 February 2007|author=All-Party Parliamentary Group against Antisemitism (UK)|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614033520/http://thepcaa.org/Report.pdf|archivedate=14 June 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 report by the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] found that there was an increase in antisemitism across the world, and that both old and new expressions of antisemitism persist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2008/US/03/14/anti-semitism/index.html "Report: Anti-Semitism on the rise globally"], [[CNN]], 14 March 2008.

== Antisemitism in the English-speaking world ==
[[William D. Rubinstein|William D. Rubenstein]], a respected author and historian, outlines the presence of antisemitism in the English-speaking world in one of his essays with the same title. In the essay, he explains that there are relatively low levels of antisemitism in the English-speaking world, particularly in Britain and the United States, because of the values associated with [[Protestantism]], the rise of capitalism, and the establishment of constitutional governments that protect civil liberties. Rubenstein does not argue that the treatment of Jews was ideal in these countries, rather he argues that there has been less overt antisemitism in the English-speaking world due to political, ideological, and social structures. Essentially, English-speaking nations experienced lower levels of antisemitism because their liberal and constitutional frameworks limited the organized, violent expression of antisemitism. In his essay, Rubinstein tries to contextualize the reduction of the Jewish population that led to a period of reduced antisemitism: "All Jews were expelled from England in 1290, the first time Jews had been expelled en masse from a European country"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Antisemitism in the English-Speaking World|last=Rubenstein|first=William D.|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc.|year=2010|isbn=|location=New York|page=459|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Protestantism ===
As mentioned, Protestantism was a major factor that curbed antisemitism in England beginning in the sixteenth century. This is supported by the fact that there were a significantly higher number of reported instances of killing Jews in England prior to the birth of Protestantism. Protestants were comparatively understanding to Jews relative to Catholics and other religious groups. Possibly, one reason that Protestant groups were supportive of Jews was because they preferred the [[Old Testament]] to the [[New Testament]], so their doctrine shared both content and narrative with the Jewish teachings. Rubenstein attests that another reason "most of these [Protestants] were predisposed to be sympathetic to the Jews" was because they often "view[ed] themselves, like the biblical Hebrews, as a chosen group that had entered in a direct covenant with God."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Lastly, Protestantism's anti-Catholic bend contributed to lower levels of antisemitism: "All of these groups were profoundly hostile to Catholicism. Anti-Catholicism, at both elite and mass levels, became a key theme in Britain, tending to push antisemitism aside."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Overall, the emergence of [[Protestantism]] lessened the severity of antisemitism through use of the [[Old Testament]] and anti-Catholic sentiment.

=== Capitalism ===
In post-Napoleonic England when there was a notable absence of Jews, Britain removed bans on "[[usury]] and moneylending,"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and Rubenstein attests London and Liverpool became economic trading hubs that bolstered England's status as an economic powerhouse. Jews were often associated with being the moneymakers and financial bodies in Europe, so it is significant that the English were able to claim responsibility to the country's financial growth and not attribute it to Jews. It is also significant that because Jews were not in the spotlight financially, it took a lot of the anger away from them, and as such, antisemitism was somewhat muted in England. It is said Jews did not rank among the "economic elite of many British cities" in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Again, the significance in this is that British Protestants and non-Jews felt less threatened by Jews because they were not imposing on their prosperity and were not responsible for the economic achievements of their nation.[[Albert Lindemann]] also proposes in the introduction of his book ''Antisemitism: A History'' that Jews "assumed social positions, such as moneylending, that were inherently precarious and tension creating."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Antisemitism: A History|last=Lindemann|first=Albert|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc.|year=2010|isbn=|location=New York|page=28|quote=Assumed social positions, such as moneylending, that were inherently precarious and tension creating.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lindemann believes moneylending is inevitably riddled with tension, so as long as Jews were moneylenders, they will always be at the center of the problem and synonymous with fraught financial affairs.

=== Constitutional government ===
The third major factor that contributed to lessening antisemitism in Britain was the establishment of a constitutional government, something that was later adopted and bolstered by the United States. A constitutional government is one that has a written document that outlines powers of government in an attempt to balance and protect the civil rights. After the [[English Civil War]] and Protectorate (1640–60) and the [[Glorious Revolution]] (1699–1680), parliament was established in Britain to make laws that protected the rights of British citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Antisemitism in the English-Speaking World|last=Rubenstein|first=WIlliam|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc.|year=2010|isbn=|location=|page=460|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]] specifically outlined laws to protect British civil liberties as well. Thus, it is not surprising that having a constitutional government with liberal principles minimized, to some extent, antisemitism in Britain.

In further attempts to minimize antisemitism within government, the United States' [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] embraced the liberal principles put forth by England and formed a republic that had executive, judicial, and legislative powers and even "forbid the establishment of any religion or any official religious test for office holding."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Antisemitism in the English-Speaking World|last=Rubenstein|first=WIlliam|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc.|year=2010|isbn=|location=New York|page=461|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having a government that respected and protected civil liberties, especially those pertaining to religious liberties, reduced blatant antisemitism by constitutionally protecting the right to practice different faiths. These sentiments go as far back to the first President of the United States, George Washington, when he asserted his belief of religious inclusion. Rubinstein believes that though instances of antisemitism definitely existed in Britain and America, the moderation of antisemitism was limited in English-Speaking countries largely because of political and social ideologies that come with a constitutional government.

=== Other English-speaking countries ===
While English-speaking countries usually points towards the United States and Britain, antisemitism was also low in other English-speaking countries such as Canada, Australia, South Africa, and New Zealand. Australia has had a historically bright outlook on Jews and had "remarkably little overt antisemitism at any point."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Antisemitism in the English Speaking World|last=Rubenstein|first=William|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc.|year=2010|isbn=|location=New York|page=492|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Ireland and New Zealand also experienced a lower presence of antisemitism. This is not to say that English reduces antisemitic sentiment, but rather that the ideologies that often accompany English-speaking countries affects acceptance of Jews. While antisemitism tended to be low in English-speaking regions of Canada, antisemitism proved to be higher in [[Quebec]] where the native language is French.

[[Quebec]] has a "long history of blaring antisemitism, enunciated by French-speaking nationalists steeped in the most extreme forms of Catholic hostility to the Jews."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Antisemitism in the English Speaking World|last=Rubenstein|first=William|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc.|year=2010|isbn=|location=New York|page=491|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is important because other English-speaking parts of Canada were more tolerant than the non-English speaking parts, which suggests a correlation between lingual diversity and the level of Jewish hate. Additionally, it seems as if Quebec's firm stance on Catholic hostility directed towards Jews contributed to local antisemitic behavior.

The '''Hove amber cup''' is a [[Bronze Age]] cup that was discovered in a great [[round barrow]] mound which was crudely excavated in 1856, in [[Hove]], [[East Sussex]], [[England]], and is now in [[Hove Museum and Art Gallery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brighton-hove-rpml.org.uk/HistoryAndCollections/collectionsthemes/hovelocalhistorygallery/Pages/hoveambercup.aspx The Hove amber cup] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027000939/http://brighton-hove-rpml.org.uk/HistoryAndCollections/collectionsthemes/hovelocalhistorygallery/Pages/hoveambercup.aspx |date=2010-10-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found during the construction of [[Palmeira Square]].  The barrow was of exceptional size and quality, suggesting a date in the mid-Bronze Age. The Hove amber cup is one of only two found in Britain; the other was in [[Dorset]]. However, the two are not of the same style of craftsmanship.

Dated to around 1250 BCE, the amber cup was found in a [[Wessex culture]] grave in a coffin made from a treetrunk. Also in the coffin were a skeleton, a Camerton (Wessex culture) type dagger, a [[Sharpening stone|whetstone]] and a small axe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harding|first=A. F.|title=European Societies in the Bronze Age|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521367295|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EbIVASSe9jcC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;dq=Hove+amber+cup+dagger&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8yr7T4C5O6qx0AX1o72_Ag&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Hove%20amber%20cup%20dagger&amp;f=false|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been associated with a small group of other "unstable" cups with round bottoms, made of precious materials and found in north-western Europe.  Most are in gold, but also silver, amber and [[shale]]. The [[Ringlemere Cup]] and [[Rillaton Cup]] are the two British gold cups.  The amber would have come from the [[Baltic region]], and the group suggest early trade links between Britain and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Needham et al., full catalogue entry at pp. 97-99&lt;/ref&gt;

==Original account==
According to the original description by Barclay Philips, 
{{Quote|In the earth with which the coffin was filled were numerous small fragments of carious bone, apparently charred, some of which were picked out; and about the centre, as if, said one of the men, they had rested on the breast of the body interred, were found the following curious relics: —

An Amber Cup, hemispherical in shape, rather deep in proportion to its width, with a " lip " or " nick," and ornamented merely with a band of fine lines running round the outside, about half an inch from the top. There is one handle, large enough for the insertion of a finger, ornamented with a fillet on each side of the surface, which is flat, similar to that on the cup itself. From the fact of the rim not being perfectly round, and the band before mentioned not passing over the space within the handle, and its being marked off with a line at each end, seemingly cut across, we may conjecture it to have been made and carved by hand. There are two small chips in the rim.

That on the left of the handle is fresh, and was caused by the man who found the cup accidentally striking it, as he told me, with his spade, when he first came upon it ; that on the right is not so large, but is ancient, as is shown by its appearance. The cup is perfectly smooth inside and out, excepting where the earth in which it was buried still adheres to the surface ; but since its exhumation the amber has cracked slightly in every part. On the cup being lifted by the handle, this broke into two pieces, having received a blow from the workman's spade, but fortunately the fragments fit very exactly, and I have therefore easily repaired it.

The following are the dimensions of the cup, which I have carefully measured, expressed in inches and decimal parts: — &lt;br /&gt;
External diameter, 3.5 inches; internal, 3.35. &lt;br /&gt;
Height, 2.5 ; depth, 2.4. &lt;br /&gt;
Internal diameter at and below band, 3'; width of lip, '125. &lt;br /&gt;
Distance of band from upper rim of lip, .5; width of band of six fillets, .3. &lt;br /&gt;
Width of handle at upper and lower end, 1.5 in centre,"6. &lt;br /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13428">'''Howard F. Cline''' (June 12, 1915 – June 1, 1971, Washington DC) was an American government official and [[historian]], specialising in Latin America. Cline served as Director of the Hispanic Foundation at the [[Library of Congress]] from 1952 until his death in June 1971.&lt;ref&gt;John Brademas, "A Tribute to Howard Francis Cline, Director of the Hispanic Foundation of the Library of Congress" ''Congressional Record'' 92nd Congress, 1st session (vol. 117 pt. 14), June 7, 1971, 18493-18494.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Finan, "Howard F. Cline, 1915-1971" ''Hispanic American Historical Review'' vol. 51, no. 4. Nov. 1971, pp. 646-653.&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the founders of the [[Latin American Studies Association]]. He was also active in the [[Conference on Latin American History]] (CLAH), the professional organization of Latin American historians, which he chaired in 1964.&lt;ref name="h-net.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clah.h-net.org/?page_id=542|title=CLAH   » Elected Officers|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is still highly regarded as a scholar "devoted to and effective in the promotion of Latin American studies in the United States."&lt;ref&gt;Helen Delpar, ''Looking South: The Evolution of Latin Americanist Scholarship in the United States, 1850-1975''. Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press 2008. Delpar’s book is dedicated to the memories of Howard F. Cline and [[Lewis Hanke]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Born in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]], Cline grew up in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]]. He was admitted to [[Harvard College]] on a scholarship; in his sophomore year became a resident in [[Dunster House]], whose Master was [[Clarence H. Haring]], later Cline’s dissertation adviser.&lt;ref&gt;Howard F. Cline, "In Memoriam: Clarence Henry Haring, 1885-1960" ''The Americas'' vol. 17, no. 3. Jan. 1961, pp. 292-297.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939 Cline graduated [[magna cum laude]] in history, writing his senior thesis on American journalist [[Benjamin Orange Flower]], which he later published.&lt;ref&gt;Howard F. Cline, "Benjamin Orange Flower and The Arena, 1889-1909," ''Journalism Quarterly'', vol. 17 (June 1940), pp. 139–150, 171.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howard F. Cline, "Flower and The Arena: Purpose and Content," ''Journalism Quarterly'', vol. 17 (Sept. 1940), pp. 247–257&lt;/ref&gt;  He was elected to Phi Beta Kappa.&lt;ref&gt;Brademus, ”A Tribute to Howard F. Cline”, p. 18493&lt;/ref&gt; He won a Frederick Sheldon Fellowship, which funded travel for a year outside of the U.S. following graduation, and which he used to go to Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Brademas, “A Tribute to Howard Francis Cline, 18493-18494.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, Cline entered the graduate program in History at Harvard, with Clarence Haring as his adviser. He did fieldwork in a then-remote [[Chinantec]] village of [[San Pedro Yólox]] in [[Oaxaca]] in 1942-43 as a Social Science Research Fellow, which resulted in several publications.&lt;ref&gt;Brademus, “Cline” 18493&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howard F. Cline, "Civil Congregation of the Indians of New Spain, 1598-1606." ''Hispanic American Historical Review'', vol. 29, no. 3, pp. 349-369.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howard F. Cline, "Civil Congregation of the Western Chinantla, New Spain, 1599-1603." ''The Americas'', vol. 12, no. 2, Oct 1955, pp. 115-137.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roberto Weitlaner and Howard F. Cline, "The Chinantec." ''Handbook of Middle American Indians'' vol. 7. Austin: University of Texas Press 1969, pp. 523-52.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cline's dissertation was on the [[Caste War]] (''guerra de las castas''). In 1947 he briefly taught at [[Yale]]&lt;ref&gt;Delpar, ''Looking South'', p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; and then [[Northwestern University]]. He left academia in 1952 to become Director of the Hispanic Foundation at the Library of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Delpar, ''Looking South'', p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brademus, ”Tribute to Howard Francis Cline,” p. 18493.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career in government and scholarly activity==
In 1952 Cline succeeded [[Lewis Hanke]] as director of the Hispanic foundation. Cline expanded the coverage of the [[Handbook of Latin American Studies]], founded under Hanke’s tenure at the Hispanic Foundation, with social science and humanities volumes alternating by year. Active in scholarly organizations in the U.S., he was instrumental in incorporating the [[Conference on Latin American History]] as a nonprofit corporation, scholarly organization in 1964, the year he served as chair of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;Howard F. Cline, "The Conference [of Latin American History]: A Fecund Decade 1954-64" ''Hispanic American Historical Review'' vol. 45, no. 3, Aug. 1965, pp. 434-38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="h-net.org"/&gt;  He was one of the founders of the [[Latin American Studies Association]] (LASA).&lt;ref&gt;Howard F. Cline, "The Latin American Studies Association: A Summary Survey with Appendix," ''Latin American Research Review'', Vol. 2. No. 1 (Autumn 1966), pp. 57-79.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1966, in his history of the Latin American Studies Association, he suggested that at some future date Latin Americanists should erect a statue to [[Fidel Castro]], the "remote godfather" of the field, who instigated a renewed U.S. interest in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Cline, "The Latin American Studies Association” p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cline edited a two-volume collection of essays on the development of Latin American history as a field.&lt;ref&gt;Howard F. Cline, editor. ''Latin American History: Essays on its Study and Teaching, 1898-1965''. 2 volumes. Conference on Latin American History and University of Texas Press, 1966&lt;/ref&gt; He also helped create the Seminar on the Acquisition of Latin American Library Materials (SALALM).&lt;ref&gt;http://salalm.org/Conf/2016/04/panel-11-the-hispanic-division-and-the-handbook-of-latin-american-studies-highlighting-luso-hispanic-collections-in-the-library-of-congress/ accessed 13 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cline prepared research materials for the U.S. [[Indian Claims Commission]], providing information on the history of Florida Indians and the [[Jicarilla Apache]].&lt;ref&gt;Howard F. Cline, "The Florida Indians, vol. 1, Notes on Colonial Indians and Communities in Florida, 1700-1821." New York: Garland Publishing 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howard F. Cline, ''Spanish and Mexican Land Grants and the Jicarilla Apache in New Mexico, 1689-1848: A Technical Report including a list of grants, confirmed and unconfirmed and summary of data''. 2 volumes, 340 pp. Maps, Bibliography. Docket 22-A, Indian Claims Commission.&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1960 Cline devoted time to volumes on [[ethnohistory]] for the ''Handbook of Middle American Indians''. This publication series focuses on what is now called [[Mesoamerica]], under the editorship of [[Tulane University]] archeologist, [[Robert Wauchope (archaeologist)|Robert Wauchope]].&lt;ref&gt;Howard F. Cline, “Ethnohistory: A Progress Report on the Handbook of Middle American Indians." ''Hispanic American Historical Review'', vol. 40, no. 2. 1960, pp. 224-229.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors==
Cline was awarded the Spanish government’s highest honor for foreigners, Commander in the [[Order of Isabella the Catholic]], for his work to bring Spanish and American scholarly institutions into greater cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;Brademus, "Cline," p. 18494.&lt;/ref&gt;  Following his early death in 1971, he was eulogized in major scholarly journals of Latin American history and in the Congressional Record. In 1972, Cline was posthumously awarded the [[Conference on Latin American History]]’s Distinguished Service Award, their highest honor.&lt;ref name="h-net.org1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clah.h-net.org/?page_id=104|title=CLAH   » The Distinguished Service Award|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976 the Howard F. Cline Prize was established and awarded biennially for the best book on Latin American ethnohistory.&lt;ref name="h-net.org1"/&gt; In 2017, the Howard F. Cline Book Prize in Mexican History was established by the Latin American Studies Association.&lt;ref&gt;http://lasa.international.pitt.edu/eng/congress/awards-main.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Society for the Study of Medievalism''' is an academic organization that exists to promote the interdisciplinary study of the popular and scholarly reception of the Middle Ages in postmedieval times. The society is based on the work and studies of [[Leslie J. Workman]] (1927–2001), who is recognized as the founder of the academic study of [[medievalism]] in the English-speaking world. The work of the society is characterized as open to innovative and inclusive interdisciplinary scholarship. As Elena Levy-Navarro writes: "The Society has not restricted itself to a single definition of medievalism, and has, both by its calls for papers and by its acceptance and inclusion, encouraged academics to explore medievalism in such disparate phenomenon as the 'Celtic' tattoo, medieval gaming, and the early modern. Such an expansiveness that resists firm boundaries, and thus resists any efforts to develop a concrete field of specialty over which the academic can preside as expert is evident to the continued commitment of its members to electronic media that can provide (for those who can afford it) open access to its collective work, including its journal, ''Year’s Work in Medievalism'', and its community-authored blog, ''Medievally Speaking''. One need only consider the subtitle of this blog—'An Open Access Review Journal Encouraging Critical Engagement with the Continuing Process of Inventing the Middle Ages' (emphasis mine)—to see that the members insist on an openness, in which they critically engage—but not adjudicate—the 'continuing process of inventing the Middle Ages.'"&lt;ref&gt;Elena Levy-Navarro: "A Long Parenthesis Begins," in ''[https://79a68520-a-62cb3a1a-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/theyearsworkinmedievalism/cabinet/28%20Levy_Navarro.pdf?attachauth=ANoY7coILs-QnSk6ptE8noLqoWu6ykfx6S20sZeKiF8XFjfjCTZGy3LTmsUq6RvkieBM6qhzlyvZPA78z5gWA7-yDdmygRpV26-cuFIAx74UuZ8RJj_8oE7LkE19Rd29-NLRNNSFpLiBIOpgl4Qs9eLXhs-8GeLAp3rmZyHSBY-yJUfxALQaA-UXjNvEktaJW1vQQBqKPP1oiVi0sjBcBAREdQG8_-hvK9f84xZDW75Mrjvas2a7pcTKqofjvGahP9MWZIYFhAMj&amp;attredirects=0 Medievalism Now]'', ed. by E.

==''Studies in Medievalism''==
''Studies in Medievalism'' is an [[annual publication]] that, as noted on its title page, "provides an interdisciplinary medium of exchange for scholars in all fields, including the visual and other arts, concerned with any aspect of the post-medieval idea and study of the [[Middle Ages]] and its influence, both scholarly and popular, of this study on [[Western society]] after 1500."&lt;ref&gt;Karl Fugelso, ed., ''Studies in Medievalism:  Defining Neomedievalism(s)'', XIX, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The series was founded in 1979 by [[Leslie J. Workman]] as an independent publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medievalism.net/history.html |title=History |publisher=International Society for the Study of Medievalism |accessdate=2011-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now published by [[Boydell &amp; Brewer]], Ltd., and has been edited since 2006 by Karl Fugelso.  Since 2009, each volume has begun with a series of 3,000-word, commissioned [[essay]]s on such topics as "Defining Medievalism(s)," "Defining Neomedievalism(s)," and "Medievalism and the Corporation."  But the series is otherwise open to any paper that addresses [[medievalism]] in at least 6,000 words, and recent topics have ranged from representations of [[Alfred the Great|King Alfred]] in [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[A Child's History of England]]''&lt;ref&gt;Emily Walker Heady, "A Steam-Whistle Modernist?:  Representations of King Alfred in Dickens's ''A Child's History of England'' and ''The Battle of Life''," ''Studies in Medievalism:  Defining Medievalism(s)'', XVII, ed.

[[Women in Judaism|Jewish women]] in the [[early modern period]] were a crucial part to all [[Jews|Jewish]] societies, as they made up half of the population.  Living in places such as [[Italy]], [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland-Lithuania]], and the [[Ottoman Empire]] had effects on the role Jewish women played in their society.  Different customs and regulations were found in various societies around the world.

== Jewish Women in Italy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Italian Jewish Women|last=Adelman|first=Howard|publisher=Wayne State University Press|year=1998|isbn=0814327133|location=|pages=150–168|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ==

=== Public Life ===

==== Professions ====
Some Italian Jewish women became published writers.  One notable author was [[Sara Copia Sullam|Sarra Copia Sullam]] (1592-1641).  She was accused of plagiarism by men that wanted to undermine her written accomplishments.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Italian Jewish Women|last=Adleman|first=Howard|publisher=Wayne State University Press|year=1998|isbn=0814327133|location=|pages=154|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish women also acted as ritual slaughterers.  [[Ritual slaughter]] can be defined as killing animals for meat, typically in a religious ritual.  Although women could act as ritual slaughterers, they had limited circumstances in which they were able to slaughter animals.  Only qualified women were allowed to, and usually only in cases in which they needed to provide food for their families.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Women also served in the business sphere of Italian society.  They acted as financial agents for their husbands, moneylenders, manufacturers of buttons and silk, cosmetic developers, etc.  Their business was conducted both privately and publicly.  This practice of women in business was disputed by men in society, as they thought women had no place in business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Italian Jewish Women|last=Adelman|first=Howard|publisher=Wayne State University Press|year=1998|isbn=0814327133|location=|pages=155|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== [[Worship]] ====
Jewish women were not allowed to worship communally in Jewish Italy.  However, they did have a separate women's section in [[synagogue]] where they could worship and take part in their faith.  Those women that could read Hebrew prayed daily.  Translations from Hebrew to a more common language later appeared for those that did not know Hebrew—men also benefitted from these translations, as not all could men could read Hebrew.  Women played a big role during worship by disrupting it.  Zac is so hot.  They would yell curses on their male counterparts and aired grievances they had.  Because Jewish Italian women could not access the Torah during worship, they made the ''mappot,'' which was a binder with Torah scrolls.  Some women even participated in daily fasting, prayer, and even abstaining from all pleasures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Italian Jewish Women|last=Adelman|first=Howard|publisher=Wayne State University Press|year=1998|isbn=0814327133|location=|pages=153–154|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Private Life ===

==== Education ====
Some Jewish girls were lucky enough to receive a complete Jewish education in Italy.  However, many in society feared educated girls, but realized that illiterate women would not make for good homemakers or mothers.  Because of this realization, daughters were taught how to write in Italian and some even learned Hebrew.  This education was mainly taken care of at home, but some girls attended school.  Occasionally women became teachers of Hebrew—they were called ''rabbit'' or [[Rabbinic Judaism|rabbinate]].  These teachers would also get involved with healing, midwifery, and other domestic practices, not just Hebrew teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Italian Jewish Women|last=Adelman|first=Howard|publisher=Wayne State University Press|year=1998|isbn=0814327133|location=|pages=156|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Marriage ====
Almost as soon as a young woman would reach puberty, she would become engaged.  The usual age of marriage for Italian Jewish women was between fourteen and eighteen, while the typical age of marriage for males was twenty-four to twenty-eight.  Marriage typically occurred after an engagement period called the ''shiddukhin'' which could last about a year or more.  The engagement process was determined by parents; fathers typically made the matches between young men and women.  These engagements were considered to be binding legal contracts.  Financial considerations were extremely important in determining enagagments, as women brought a dowry to the marriage, and grooms supplied monetary sums if the marriage ended in divorce, he went to jail, or he died.  As such, the sums were determined in the engagement contracts.

After the marriage occurred, young women left her family to join her husband's.  She then became homemaker and was expected to have children.  Jewish women in Italy were unable to initiate divorce, so in order to divorce her husband, a woman would have to either involve her rabbi, violate marital laws, or try to convert either herself or her husband to Christianity, as the marriage would then become null.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Italian Jewish Women|last=Adelman|first=Howard|publisher=Wayne State University Press|year=1998|isbn=0814327133|location=|pages=156–159|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Jewish Women in Poland-Lithuania ==

=== Public Life ===

==== Professions ====
Even though Jewish women in Poland-Lithuania were mainly secluded in their homes, they did have access to becoming economically independent and were able to hold jobs of their own in society.  They performed as bankers, money-lenders, arendas, inn or tavern managers, peddlers, store owners, and craft-makers, where they would sell at markets under tight restrictions.  Families were often dependent on the financial contribution Jewish women made by working in these areas of trade.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/poland-early-modern-1500-1795|title=Poland: Early Modern (1500-1795) {{!}} Jewish Women's Archive|website=jwa.org|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women were not allowed to hold public office positions, due to male contempt for women.  This did not mean, however, that they were unable to participate publicly.  They could serve as court witnesses, petition signers, and bond guarantors.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Charitable Activities&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=My Dear Daughter|last=Fram|first=Edward|publisher=Hebrew Union College Press|year=2007|isbn=0878204598|location=|pages=79–84|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
In several communities in Poland-Lithuania, women were able to serve their communities and husbands as charity donation collectors.  They participated in facilitating donations, monetary collecting, and giving money as well.  As well as charity donations, older women in the community served as gynecologists for the town women.  They would give exams, advice, and generally be consulted about many feminine problems women in town were experiencing.  Women also acted charitably by advising other women about religious matters.  These matters could include menstruation, adultery, and women's body preparation for burial.

=== Private Life ===
Women were excluded from almost all religious and intellectual parts of life in Poland-Lithuania.

==== Home ====
Jewish women in [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland-Lithuania]] tended to be secluded.  They mainly stayed in their homes, and they were not allowed to have much contact with males (be they relatives or acquaintances) at all.  Due to this seclusion, they had very limited access to traveling outside their home, and were told to go outside their homes only as "little as necessary".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Of course, this then meant that their professions were limited, as seen in the section above.  Women were supposed to be second to their husbands in their own homes, and as subordinates, their husbands would be in control of all types of situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=My Dear Daughter|last=Fram|first=Edward|publisher=Hebrew Union College Press|year=2007|isbn=0878204598|location=|pages=49|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This led to the seclusion of women in their homes, applying to married and unmarried women.

==== Education ====
The education of Jewish girls was primarily done through privately hired tutors or a member of their family who had studied enough to pass on the knowledge.  Girls would study religious readings instead of the more common Yiddish literature that were translated into Hebrew.  Sometimes, girls studied in ''[[Cheder|heder]]'', which was why they were able to read Hebrew at all. However, most females in the Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth were illiterate, as female education was seen as much less important than male education.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Worship ====
Women's worship was generally a private affair.  They had synagogue access mainly on holidays and each Sabbath, however they had to sit separately from males during religious activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=My Dear Daughter|last=Fram|first=Edward|publisher=Hebrew Union College Press|year=2007|isbn=0878204598|location=|pages=45|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The synagogue was one of the acceptable public places for women to appear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=My Dear Daughter|last=Fram|first=Edward|publisher=Hebrew Union College Press|year=2007|isbn=0878204598|location=|pages=52|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Worship for women consisted of prayer, including the Yiddish ''ttkines'', or [[Supplication|petitionary prayers]].  They're prayers depended on the time of year and even day, and could be modified for each individual reciting the prayers.  This was due to each woman having own personal motivations and significance of religion, so the prayers needed to be unique to each and every one.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Some male rabbi even stated that women "were exempted from most of the commandments"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=My Dear Daughter|last=Fram|first=Edward|publisher=Hebrew Union College Press|year=2007|isbn=0878204598|location=|pages=37|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to their status as women, so it is obvious that some were secluded from religious activity, however they had their own three "women's comandmants".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=My Dear Daughter|last=Fram|first=Edward|publisher=Hebrew Union College Press|year=2007|isbn=0878204598|location=|pages=63|quote="woman's commandments"|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Jewish Women in the Ottoman Empire&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sephardi Women in the Medieval and early Modern Periods|last=Melammed|first=Renee L.|publisher=Wayne State University Press|year=1998|isbn=0814327133|location=|pages=128–149|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ==

=== Public Life ===

==== Professions ====
Peasant Jewish women tended to peddle at the marketplaces, selling chicken along with eggs and wine, among other goods.  These urban middle-class women were limited to jobs similar to peddling and farming.  Wealthier women living in the [[Ottoman Empire]] had greater options towards their occupations.  Sometimes these women acted as merchants or moneylenders.  Other, much less common, professions Jewish women held were midwives and medical caregivers.  While women in the Ottoman Empire had means to succeed on their own, their options were a bit limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sephardi Women in the Medieval and Early Modern Periods|last=Melammed|first=Renee|publisher=Wayne State University Press|year=1998|isbn=0814327133|location=|pages=134|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Public Places ====
The public place is one where women would go to either do chores, such as using the oven for cooking, using the looms for spinning and weaving, or fetching water for laundry and cooking.  These were often social encounters as well as ones where Jewish women would get their responsibilities done.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===== [[Public bathing|Bath houses]] =====
Especially in the Spanish Sephardic society, bath houses were attended regularly by Jewish women and were regarded as social places.  Women would socialize with each other.  These women bathed with women of other religions too such as Christians and Moslems.  Occasionally this practice was looked down upon by men, as they did not believe people of different religions should associate with each other.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Worship ====
Similarly to the Household confinement section, [[Muslim|Moslem]] influence reached to how Jewish women participated in worship.  Unlike Moslem women, Jewish women were allowed to attend worships in their synagogues.  However, in the Spanish synagogues, women were separated from men during the services, which is a common Moslem practice.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sephardi Women in the Medieval and Early Modern Periods|last=Melammed|first=Renee|publisher=Wayne State University Press|year=1998|isbn=0814327133|location=|pages=130|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Private Life ===

==== Household Confinement ====
In the [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] Ottoman Empire, different cultures lived amongst each other.  This led to the Moslem culture influencing Jewish women in their daily activities.  As the Early Modern period Moslem culture restricted women's movement outside the home and regulated their dress if they did venture outside, the Jews of the Ottoman Empire also began adopting these practices.  Portuguese Jewish men during this time period were especially protective of their female counterparts, and would seclude them from other aspects of society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Widows ====
Jewish women became heads of households if their husbands passed away.  This new status was one of extreme independence, and it was regularly accepted in Ottoman society.  Widows controlled their own [[dowry]] and inheritances—she was also completely responsible for herself and any children she had with her husband.  This gave widows immense power and freedom of movement in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sephardi Women in the Medieval and Early Modern Periods|last=Melammed|first=Renee|publisher=Wayne State University Press|year=1998|isbn=0814327133|location=|pages=135-`36|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joaquín García Icazbalceta''' (August 21, 1824 – November 26, 1894) was a [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[philologist]] and [[historian]]. He edited writings by Mexican writers who preceded him, wrote a biography of [[Juan de Zumárraga]], and translated [[William H. Prescott]]'s ''Conquest of Mexico''. His works on [[Colonial Mexico]] continue to be cited today.

==Life==
García Icazbalceta was born in Mexico City to a wealthy [[Spanish people|Spanish]] family. The family was exiled to [[Spain]] in 1825, shortly after the recognition of [[Mexican War of Independence|Mexican independence]], by an act of Congress, and was not able to return until seven years later.

He was educated by tutors and through independent reading. He learned several Continental languages and delved into the study of Iberoamerica. His studies were interrupted by the outbreak of the [[Mexican-American War]], in which he took part. After the war he returned to scholarly pursuits.

He married Filomena Pimentel (who died in chilbirth), granddaughter of Count of Heras.

He spent the better part of his life amassing a large collection of books, documents, and manuscripts from the colonial era, which he used in his work.

==Work==
García Icazbalceta wrote his biography of [[Juan de Zumárraga]], the first [[Archbishop]] of Mexico, during a time when Mexican history was being reevaluated, resulting in criticism of the Archbishop and the mendicant orders who converted the natives. In it, he countered Liberal and Protestant charges that the Archbishop was "ignorant and fanatical" by casting him and other Franciscans in the role of the saviors of the Indians, from the brutality of the civil authority.

He also highlighted the Archbishop's role in fostering early educational institutions such as the [[Colegio Santa Cruz]] and credits him with bringing the first [[printing press]] to the [[Western hemisphere]].

He especially objected to charges—levelled by Mier, Bustamante, and [[William H. Prescott|Prescott]]—that Zumárraga had played any role in the destruction of native [[Aztec codices]], arguing that most of the destruction had occurred before Zumárraga's arrival, that no Spanish chroniclers mention any book burnings, and that the one mentioned by [[Fernando Alva de Ixtlilxochitl|Alva de Ixtlilxochitl]] was committed by [[Tlaxcala]]ns in 1520.

He also used the book to criticize the hypocrisy he viewed in Liberal legislators, who, while attacking the Archbishop for cruelty to the Indians, betrayed the indigenous heritage of the nation by lifting limitations on the export of ancient works of art and artifacts.

The book was sufficient to restore the credibility of the Archbishop and the place of the Franciscans as founders of the Mexican society in the Mexican consciousness, but it raised other questions. Many people were uncomfortable with the lack of any mention of the apparition of the Virgin Mary as [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]] or Zumárraga's construction of a chapel in her honor.

In fact, García Icazbalceta had written a chapter on the subject, which he elected not to include in the final draft at the behest of Francisco Paula de Verea, bishop of [[Puebla]]. In it, he divulged that he had not found any contemporary documents referring to the apparition, identifying [[Miguel Sánchez]]'s 1648 ''Imagen de la Virgen'' as the first to appear.

Despite his prestige as Mexico's pre-eminent historian of the time, his political conservatism and his devout Catholicism, attacks were made against his reputation by defenders of the historicity of the apparition. In response to a demand made by [[Pelagio Antonio de Labastida]], Archbishop of Mexico, he wrote a detailed account of "what history tells us about the apparition of Our Lady of Guadalupe to [[Juan Diego]]".

In it, he detailed all of the historical problems with the traditional legend of the apparition. These included the silence of historical documents on the phenomenon, especially that of Zumárraga, the lack of any of the Nahuatl documents mentioned by previous historians, the unremarkability of the blossoming of flowers during the month of December (an important aspect of the traditional narrative), and the improbability that "Guadalupe" was a Nahuatl name. He further cited inconsistencies between the studies of the icon as reasons to doubt the apparition's historicity.

He started work on a dictionary of Mexican Spanish, ''Vocabulario de Mexicanismos'', which was only finished up to the letter "G" and was published posthumously.

Icazbalceta was elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]] in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlisti American Antiquarian Society Members Directory]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
García Icazbalceta died of "cerebral [[apoplexy]]" at the age of 70.
His writings on the work of the [[Franciscan]] [[religious order|Order]] in [[Colonial Mexico]] influenced the work of [[Ignacio Manuel Altamirano]], a contemporary historian.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1389">'''Krasnyi Yar''' is an eneolithic site of the [[Botai culture]] in [[Kazakhstan]].  This large site is significant for the early use of horses there.  Horse meat was eaten, but horses were also kept as livestock.
Evidence from the presence of curved rows of postholes (indicative of fencing) and nitrogen and phosphates in the enclosed areas indicate a corral.  The only livestock bones found at the site were from horses, so the inference by the researchers is that horses were held in corrals at the site.&lt;ref name=amnh&gt;{{cite web|title=Ancient Krasnyi Yar|url=http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/past-exhibitions/horse/domesticating-horses/ancient-krasnyi-yar|publisher=American Museum of Natural History|accessdate=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Horse-bone tools indicate leather production, suggesting [[horse tack]].&lt;ref name=amnh/&gt;

Botai sites have been found to have mare's milk residue in vessels and to have horses with tooth-wear interpreted as having been caused by using a bit for riding or traction.&lt;ref&gt;Outram, Alan K., Natalie A. Stear, Robin Bendrey, Sandra Olsen, Alexei Kasparov, Victor Zailbert, Nick Thorpe, and Richard P. Evershed, 2009 "The Earliest Horse Harnessing and Milking," Science 323: 1332-1335&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mani 2000.png|thumb|Map of Modern Mani]]
The '''Mani Peninsula''' ({{lang-el|Μάνη}}, ''Mánē''), also long known by its medieval name '''Maina''' or '''Maïna''' (Μαΐνη), is a geographical and cultural region in [[Greece]] that is home to the [[Maniots]] (Mανιάτες, ''Maniátes'' in Greek). The capital city of Mani is [[Areopoli]]. Mani is the central peninsula of the three which extend southwards from the [[Peloponnesus|Peloponnese]] in southern Greece. To the east is the [[Laconian Gulf]], to the west the [[Messenian Gulf]]. The peninsula forms a continuation of the [[Taygetos]] mountain range, the western spine of the Peloponnese.

==Etymology==
The name "Mani" may come from the name of the [[Frankokratia|Frankish]] castle [[Grand Magne|''le Grand Magne'']].&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrick Leigh Fermor]], ''Mani: Travels in the Southern Peloponnese'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=8V5QBkD7IIYC&amp;q=magne  p. 94]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Peloponnese map.png|thumb|250px|Map of Greece highlighting the Peloponnese-Mani is the middle peninsula at the south of the Peloponnese.]]

The terrain is mountainous and inaccessible.

Until recent years many Mani villages could be reached only by sea. Today a narrow and winding road extends along the west coast from [[Kalamata]] to [[Areopoli]], then south to Akrotainaro (the pointed cape, which is the southernmost point of continental Greece) before it turns north toward [[Gytheio]]. Another road, that is used by the public buses of the [[Piraeus]] - Mani line, which has existed for several decades, comes from [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripoli]] through [[Sparta]], [[Gytheio]], [[Areopoli]] and ends in the [[Gerolimenas]] port near [[Cape Matapan]].
Mani has been traditionally divided into three regions:

*''Exo Mani'' (Έξω Μάνη) or Outer Mani to the northwest,
*''Kato Mani'' (Κάτω Μάνη) or Lower Mani to the east,
*''Mesa Mani'' (Μέσα Μάνη) or Inner Mani to the southwest.
A fourth region named [[Sminos|Vardounia]] (Βαρδούνια) to the north is also sometimes included but was never historically part of Mani. Vardounia served as a buffer between the Ottoman-Turkish controlled Evrotas plains and Mani. A contingent of Muslim Albanian settlers were relocated to the region by the Ottomans. These settlers formed a large segment of the local population until the [[Greek War of Independence]] when they fled to the Turkish stronghold at [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripoli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zorbas.de/maniguide/togith.html|title=Mani - Kato Mani - from Kelefa to Vardounia and on to Githeon|author=|date=|website=www.zorbas.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the war Vardounia's Greek population was reinforced by settlers from Lower Mani and central Laconia.

''"As a passerby you need three days to see Mani,''
&lt;br&gt;''as a visitor you need three months,''
&lt;br&gt;''but to see her soul you need three lifetimes.''
&lt;br&gt;''One for her sea, one for her mountains and one for her people"''
|-
|}Administratively, Mani is now divided between the prefectures of [[Laconia]] (Kato Mani, Mesa Mani) and [[Messenia]] (Exo Mani), in the periphery of Peloponnesos, but in ancient times it lay entirely within Laconia, the district dominated by [[Sparta]]. The Messenian Mani (also called ''aposkiaderi'', a local expression meaning "shady") receives somewhat more rainfall than the Laconian (called ''prosiliaki'', a local expression meaning "sunny"), and is consequently more productive in agriculture. Maniots from what is now Messenian Mani have surnames that uniformly end in ''-éas'', whereas Maniots from what is now Laconian Mani have surnames that end in ''-ákos''; additionally there is the ''-óggonas'' ending, a corruption of ''éggonos'', "grandson".

==History==
[[File:Mani Flag (Greece).svg|thumb|left|The flag of Mani (unofficial).]]
[[File:Vathia Mani Greece.jpg|thumb|right|Tower houses in [[Vatheia]].]]
[[File:Gythio Peloponnisos.jpg|thumb|The port of the city of [[Gytheio]].]]

[[Neolithic]] remains have been found in many caves along the Mani coasts, including the [[Alepotrypa Cave]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Oxbow Books, Limited| isbn = 978-1-78570-648-6| last1 = Papathanasiou| first1 = Anastasia| last2 = Parkinson| first2 = William A.| last3 = Galaty| first3 = Michael L.| last4 = Pullen| first4 = Daniel J.| last5 = Karkanas| first5 = Panagiotis| title = Neolithic Alepotrypa Cave in the Mani, Greece| date = 2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homer]] refers to a number of towns in the Mani region, and some artifacts from the [[Mycenaean period]] (1900 BC - 1100 BC) have been found. The area was occupied by the [[Dorians]] in about 1200 BC, and became a dependency of Sparta. After Spartan power was destroyed in the 3rd century BC, Mani remained self-governing.

As the power of the [[Byzantine Empire]] declined, the peninsula drifted out of the Empire's control. The fortress of Maini in the south became the area's centre. Over the subsequent centuries, the peninsula was fought over by the Byzantines, the [[Franks]], and the [[Saracens]].

After the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204 AD, Italian and French knights (known collectively by the Greeks as Franks) occupied the Peloponnese and created the [[Principality of Achaea]]. They built the fortresses of [[Mystras]], [[Passavas]], Gustema (Beaufort), and Great Maina. The area fell under [[Byzantine]] rule after 1262, forming part of the [[Despotate of the Morea]].

In 1460, after the [[fall of Constantinople]], the Despotate fell to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]].  Mani was not subdued and retained its internal self-government in exchange for an annual tribute, although this was only paid once. Local [[chieftain]]s or ''beys'' governed Mani on behalf of the Ottomans:

:'The first of these rulers, Liberakis Yerakaris, reigned in the middle of the seventeenth century. By the age of twenty he had served several years as an oarsman in the Venetian galleys and made himself the foremost pirate of the Mani. Captured by the Turks and condemned to death, he was reprieved by the Grand Vizier---the great Albanian Ahmet Küprülü---on condition that he accepted the hegemony of the Mani. He undertook the office in order to avenge himself on the strong Maniot family of the Stephanopoli with which he was in feud. He at once besieged them in the fort of Vitylo and captured thirty-five of them whom he executed on the spot. For the next twenty years he used his power and influence with the Sublime Porte to campaign all over Greece at the head of formidable armies, siding now with the Turks, now with the Venetians, marrying the beautiful princess Anastasia, niece of a Voivode of Wallachia (a member of the Duca family), ending his life, after adventures comparable to anything in the annals of the Italian condottiere, as Turkish Prince of the Mani and Venetian Lord of the Roumeli and Knight of St. Mark. The Turks did not repeat the experiment for a hundred years. [...] [Later,] during the forty-five years from 1776 to 1821, when the War of Independence broke out, the Mani was ruled by eight successive Beys, all except one of whom played the dangerous game of maintaining the interests of the Mani and of eventual Greek freedom while trying to remain on the right side of the Turks. [These were:] Zanetos Koutipharis (3 years), Michaelbey Troupakis (3 years), Zanetbey Kapetanakis Grigorakis (14 years), Panayoti Koumoundouros (5 years), Antonbey Grigorakis (7 years), Zervobey (2 years), Thodorbey Zanetakis (5 years) and [[Petrobey Mavromichalis]] (6 years).'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leigh Fermor|first=Patrick|title=Mani -- Travels in the Southern Peloponnese|year=1958|publisher=John Murray|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Ottoman power declined, the mountains of the Mani became a stronghold of the ''[[klephts]]'', bandits who also fought against the Ottomans. There is also evidence of a sizeable Maniot emigration to [[Corsica]] sometime during the Ottoman years. Petros Mavromichalis, the last ''[[bey]]'' of Mani, was among the leaders of the [[Greek War of Independence]]. He proclaimed the revolution at Areopoli on March 17, 1821. The Maniots contributed greatly to the struggle, but once Greek independence was won, they wanted to retain local autonomy. During the reign of [[John Capodistria|Ioannis Kapodistrias]], they violently resisted outside interference, to the extent of Mavromichalis killing Kapodistrias.

In 1878 the national government reduced the local autonomy of the Mani, and the area gradually became a backwater; inhabitants abandoned the land through emigration, with many going to major Greek cities, as well as to western Europe and the United States. It was not until the 1970s, when the construction of new roads supported the growth of the tourist industry, that the Mani began to regain population and become prosperous.

== Economy ==
Despite the region's aridity, Mani is known for its unique culinary products such as ''glina'' or ''syglino'' (pork or pork sausage smoked with aromatic herbs such as [[thyme]], [[oregano]], [[Mentha|mint]], etc. and stored in lard along with orange peel). Mani is also known for what some{{who|date=June 2014}} consider the world's best extra-virgin [[olive oil]]{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}, soft-pressed from partially ripened olives of the ''Koroneiki'' variety, which are grown on mountain terraces. The local [[honey]] is also of superior quality{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}.

Today the Mani's coastal villages are full of cafés and souvenir shops. The peninsula attracts visitors for its Byzantine churches, Frankish castles, sandy beaches and scenery. Some popular beaches during the summer are Kalogria and the beaches by [[Stoupa]] harbor, while [[Kardamyli]] and [[Agios Nikolaos, Messinia|Agios Nikolaos]] have good pebble and sand beaches, too. The ancient tower houses of Mani (''pyrgospita'') are significant tourist attractions, and some offer accommodations for visitors. The Vlychada Cave at Pirgos Dirou, near [[Oitylo]], are also a popular tourist destination.  As they are partly underwater, visitors tour them in ''[[gondola]]''-like boats.

[[Gytheio]], [[Areopoli]], Kardamyli, and Stoupa are filled with tourists during the summer months, but the region is generally quiet during the winter. Many inhabitants work as olive farmers, and devote the winter months to the olive harvest and processing. Some of the villages in the mountains are less tourist oriented and often have very few inhabitants.

==Religion==
The introduction of Christianity came late in the Mani: the first Greek temples began to be converted into Christian churches during the 11th century A.D. A [[Byzantine]] Greek monk called [[Saint Nikon the Metanoeite|Nikon "the Metanoite"]] ({{lang-el|Νίκων ὁ Μετανοείτε}}) was commissioned by the Church in the 10th  century (900's AD) to spread Christianity to areas such as Mani and [[Tsakonia]], which had remained [[pagan]]. 

St. Nikon was sent to the Mani in the latter half of the 10th century to preach Christianity to the [[Maniots]]. Although the Maniots began to convert to Christianity century due to Nikon's preaching, it took more than 200 years, i.e. until the 11th and 12th centuries to eliminate most of the pagan Greek religion and traditions and for the Maniots to fully accept Christianity. After his sanctification by the Greek Orthodox Church, St. Nikon became patron saint of the Mani as well as Sparta.

[[Patrick Leigh Fermor]] wrote of them:
:Sealed off from outside influences by their mountains, the semi-[[rock-cut architecture|troglodytic]] Maniots themselves were the last of the Greeks to be converted. They only abandoned the old religion of Greece towards the end of the ninth century. It is surprising to remember that this peninsula of rock, so near the heart of the Levant from which Christianity springs, should have been baptised three whole centuries after the arrival of St. Augustine in far-away Kent.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leigh Fermor|first=Patrick|title=Mani -- Travels in the Southern Peloponnese|year=1958|publisher=John Murray|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Medieval reenactment''' is a form of [[historical reenactment]] that focuses on re-enacting [[European history]] in the period from the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|fall of Rome]] to about the end of the 15th century. The second half of this period is often called the [[Middle Ages]]. This multiplicity of terms is compounded by the variety of other terms used for the period.

The first period is sometimes called the [[Migration Period]] or [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] by Western European historians, and as Völkerwanderung ("wandering of the peoples") by German historians. This term is usually reserved for the 5th and 6th centuries. Re-enactors who re-create the next period of history - 7th to 11th centuries - often refer to this as Early medieval. The 12th to 14th centuries fall under the term High medieval, while the 15th century is often termed Late medieval.

With such a wide range of eras most medieval reenactment groups focus on a smaller time period, sometimes restricting their interest to a particular century, or even a specific decade, series of battles, or monarch, depending on how authentic the reenactment and encampment is intended to be.

== Living history ==
[[File:Ehrenberg lagerleben 07.JPG|thumb|300px|Reenactment of everyday life]]
Medieval period oriented [[living history]] groups and reenactors focus on recreating civilian or military life in period of the Middle Ages. It is very popular in [[Eastern Europe]]. The goal of the reenactor and their group is to portray an accurate interpretation of a person who credibly could exist at a specific place at a specific point in time while at the same time remaining approachable to the public. Examples of living history activities include authentic camping, cooking, practicing historical skills and trades, and playing historical musical instruments or board games.

[[Renaissance Fair]] participants generally borrow from a range of history and often incorporate fantasy or Hollywood-inspired elements into a presentation for public entertainment. In contrast, activities of the [[Society for Creative Anachronism|Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA)]] include everything from artistic disguises for modern items such as ice chests, to exhaustive research and authentic living history events.

== Combat reenactment ==
{{main|Combat reenactment}}
[[File:BattleNormannen.JPG|thumb|left|2006 reenactment of the 1066 [[Battle of Hastings]]]]
The principal aim of this sort of reenactment is to re-create historical battles or methods of combat.  The variations range from training of historical [[Historical European martial arts|dueling practices]] (usually with an appropriate period sword such as an arming sword or [[rapier]] and [[wrestling]] as a [[martial art]]), to reenactment of historical or legendary battles of the medieval period.

Some groups treating historical combat as a martial art do not fit the traditional definition of a reenactment group and are more similar to fencing clubs. An example is the [[Society for Creative Anachronism|SCA]], which uses rattan swords to avoid injury. Others combine the sport with more traditional forms of reenactment, such as [[living history]].  It is usual to fight using more restricted target areas than in a real fight and with less speed and force, although some systems try to get as close to real combat as possible. 
Many societies try to reenact actual battles on or near the battle site.  These events are usually open to the public to watch.  Other societies such as the SCA hire venues for private events, including combat, without any public present.  

The Federation of the Wars of the Roses is a British–based society which specialises in reenactments of the 15th Century. It stages events at historical sites all over Britain, including those on or near actual battle sites. There are rules on weapons, clothing and armour which are observed by the Households that are Federation members. New Households wishing to enter the Federation are sponsored by established ones, and endure a probationary period to ensure standards are observed.

== Reenactment in Europe ==
[[Image:Eglinton tournament invitation.jpg|300px|right|thumb|An official invitation to the Eglinton Tournament.]]
There have been many isolated examples of medieval reenactment in Europe, notably the [[Eglinton Tournament of 1839]].  In modern times, medieval reenactment has been popular in the [[United Kingdom]], starting in the late 1960s and growing every year since, with groups from all over [[England]], [[Scotland]], [[Ireland]] and [[Wales]] participating in events. Many UK battles are reenacted at their original battle sites by enthusiasts with a high degree of authenticity, together with Medieval traders, musicians, caterers. UK reenactors can be seen throughout the country during the summer months at battles, fairs, carnivals, fetes, pubs and schools. Almost entirely throughout the UK, reenactors use blunted steel weapons for reenactments and rubber tipped arrows (blunts) for archers, or steel heads when target shooting. The largest early medieval event in the UK is the [[Battle of Hastings reenactment]], which in 2006 had over 3600 registered participants and combined living history and combat reenactment. Most UK battles have at some point been reenacted such as the [[Battle of Lewes]] and the [[Battle of Evesham]], many historical battles are reenacted annually from periods such as the [[Wars of the Roses]], including the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]] and the [[Battle of Tewkesbury]].  Others are carried out at irregular intervals depending on the site availability and funding for the event, such as the [[Battle of Bannockburn]].  

[[Belgium]] has at least two dozen separate groups of medieval reenactors, including the Order of the Hagelanders, the Gentsche Ghesellen and the Gruuthuse Household serving [[Lewis de Bruges, lord of Gruuthuse]].&lt;ref&gt;Dan Bilefsky, "Belgians Hail the Middle Ages (Well, Not the Plague Part)", ''[[New York Times]]'', Monday, April 9, 2007, p. A4&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[open air museum]] [[Middelaldercentret]] uses living history and historical reenactment to portrait a part of a small Danish merchant town. Several reenactment groups exists in Denmark which are doing medieval reenactment at markets around the country.

In [[France]] there is an annual reenactment of the [[Battle of Agincourt]] representing a battle of the [[Hundred Years War]].

In [[Germany]] medieval reenactment is usually associated with living history and renaissance faires and festivals as e.g. the Peter and Paul festival in [[Bretten]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landsknechte-bretten.de/galerie/der-tross-1-tag/ Der Tross 10. – 14. Juni 2004] &lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Schloss Kaltenberg]] knights tournament.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.ritterturnier.de/ Kaltenberg web entry]&lt;/ref&gt;In the past few years combat reenactment has gained some ground as well. A few groups are training historical combat such as longsword dueling and dussack fighting at universities, but the majority of combat reenactment groups are battlefield reenactment groups, some of which have become isolated to some degree because of a strong focus on authenticity (some groups refuse to fight groups representing different or wider periods, even if the combat practices would be entirely compatible otherwise). In general, the specific German approach of [[Authenticity (reenactment)]] is less about replaying a certain event, but to allow an immersion in a certain [[era]]. Historic city festivals and events are quite important to build up local communities and contribute to the self-image of municipalities.&lt;ref&gt;Benita Luckmann: Bretten, Politik in einer deutschen Kleinstadt. Enke, Stuttgart 1970, {{ISBN|3-432-01618-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Events in monuments or on historical sites are less about the events related to them but as mere [[staffage]] for the immersion experience.&lt;ref&gt; Michael Petzet: "ln the full richness of their authenticity" - The Test of Authenticity and the New Cult of Monuments, Nara Conference on Authenticity in Relation to the World Heritage 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among many battlefield reenactors in Germany, the [[Codex Belli]] has become a de facto standard.

Groups from [[Central Europe]], especially [[Hungary]], are rumored {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} to practice much more dangerous forms of battlefield reenactment, sometimes with sharp edges and points as well as metal arrow heads and an overall higher acceptance of the risk of injury posed by these dangers. This more risky, although more realistic, form of reenactment is apparently also practiced in former East Germany.

In [[Poland]], the Battle of Grunwald reenactment every year on 15 July is the best known and attracts participants and visitors from many other countries. It is associated with living history and a medieval fair.

In [[Sweden]] there are many different "medieval markets". The largest is the one in [[Gotland]].[https://web.archive.org/web/20050829235711/http://www.medeltidsveckan.com/]
In Szeklerland, Transylvania are many Hun, szekler knight, early Hungarian and hussar reenactment groups and camps.
One of those is the Szekler knights (Lofos) reenactment group in Torboszlo.

{{nihongo|'''Metabolism'''|新陳代謝|shinchintaisha}} was a post-war Japanese architectural movement that fused ideas about architectural [[Megastructures (architecture)|megastructures]] with those of organic biological growth. It had its first international exposure during [[Congrès Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne|CIAM]]'s 1959 meeting and its ideas were tentatively tested by students from [[Kenzo Tange|Kenzo Tange's]] [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] studio.

During the preparation for the 1960 Tōkyō World Design Conference a group of young architects and designers, including [[Kiyonori Kikutake]], [[Kisho Kurokawa]] and [[Fumihiko Maki]] prepared the publication of the Metabolism manifesto. They were influenced by a wide variety of sources including [[Marxism|Marxist]] theories and biological processes. Their manifesto was a series of four essays entitled: Ocean City, Space City, Towards Group Form, and Material and Man, and it also included designs for vast cities that floated on the oceans and plug-in capsule towers that could incorporate organic growth. Although the World Design Conference gave the Metabolists exposure on the international stage their ideas remained largely theoretical.

Some smaller, individual buildings that employed the principles of Metabolism were built and these included Tange's Yamanashi Press and Broadcaster Centre and Kurokawa's [[Nakagin Capsule Tower]]. The greatest concentration of their work was to be found at the [[Expo '70|1970 World Exposition]] in Osaka where Tange was responsible for master planning the whole site whilst Kikutake and Kurokawa designed pavilions. After the [[1973 oil crisis]], the Metabolists turned their attention away from Japan and toward Africa and the Middle East.

==Origins of Metabolism==

The [[Congrès Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne]] (CIAM) was founded in Switzerland in 1928 as an association of architects who wanted to advance modernism into an international setting. During the early 1930s they promoted the idea (based upon new urban patterns in the United States) that urban development should be guided by CIAM's four functional categories of: dwelling, work, transportation, and recreation.&lt;ref name="Mumford 2010, p5"&gt;Mumford (2000), p5&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-1930s [[Le Corbusier]] and other architects had moulded CIAM into a pseudo-political party with the goal of promoting modern architecture to all. This view gained some traction in the immediate post-war period when Le Corbusier and his colleagues began to design buildings in [[Chandigarh]]. By the early 1950s it was felt that CIAM was losing its avant-garde edge so in 1954 a group of younger members called "[[Team 10]]" was formed. This included the inner circle Dutch architects [[Jaap Bakema|Jacob Bakema]] and [[Aldo van Eyck]], Italian [[Giancarlo De Carlo]], Greek [[Georges Candilis]], the British architects [[Alison and Peter Smithson|Peter and Alison Smithson]] and the American [[Shadrach Woods]]. The Team 10 architects introduced concepts like "human association", "cluster" and "mobility", with Bakema encouraging the combination of architecture and planning in [[urban design]]. This was a rejection of CIAM's older four function mechanical approach and it would ultimately lead to the break-up and end of CIAM.&lt;ref name="Mumford 2010, p6-7"&gt;Mumford (2000), p6-7&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kenzo Tange]] was invited to the CIAM '59 meeting of the association in Otterlo, Netherlands. In what was to be the last meeting of CIAM he presented two theoretical projects by the architect [[Kiyonori Kikutake]]: the Tower-shaped City and Kikutake's own home, the Sky House. This presentation exposed the fledgling Metabolist movement to its first international audience. Like Team 10's "human association" concepts Metabolism too was exploring new concepts in urban design.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p26"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

Tower-shaped City was a 300 metre tall tower that housed the infrastructure for an entire city. It included transportation, services and a manufacturing plant for prefabricated houses. The tower was vertical "artificial land" onto which steel, pre-fabricated dwelling capsules could be attached. Kikutake proposed that these capsules would undergo self-renewal every fifty years and the city would grow organically like branches of a tree.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p26"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

Constructed on a hillside, the Sky House is a platform supported on four concrete panels with a [[hyperboloid structure|hyperbolic paraboloid]] shell roof. It is a single space divided by storage units with the kitchen and bathroom on the outer edge.&lt;ref name="Watanabe 2001, p123"&gt;Watanabe (2001), p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; These latter two were designed so that they could be moved to suit the use of the house - and indeed they have been moved and/or adjusted about seven times over the course of fifty years. At one point a small children's room was attached to the bottom of main floor with a small child-sized access door between the two rooms.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p139"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

After the meeting, Tange left for [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] to begin a four-month period as a visiting professor. It is possible that based upon the reception of Kikutake's projects in Otterlo he decided to set the fifth year project as a design for a residential community of 25,000 inhabitants to be constructed on the water of Boston Bay.&lt;ref name="Stewart 1987, p177"&gt;Stewart (1987), p177&lt;/ref&gt; Tange felt a natural desire to produce urban designs based upon a new prototype of design, one that could give a more human connection to super-scale cities. He considered the idea of "major" and "minor" city structure and how this could grow in cycles like the trunk and leaves of a tree.&lt;ref name="Riani 1969, p24"&gt;Riani (1969), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the seven projects produced by the students was a perfect example of his vision. The project consisted of two primary residential structures each of which was triangular in section. Lateral movement was provided by motorways and monorail, whilst vertical movement from the parking areas was via elevators. There were open spaces within for community centres and every third level there were walkways along which were rows of family houses.&lt;ref name="Riani 1969, p24"&gt;Riani (1969), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; The project appeared to be based upon Tange's unrealised competition entry for the World Health Organisation headquarters in Geneva&lt;ref name="Stewart 1987, p178"&gt;Stewart (1987), p178&lt;/ref&gt; and both projects paved the way for his later project, "Plan for Tōkyō – 1960". Tange went on to present both the Boston Bay Project and the Tōkyō Plan at the Tōkyō World Design Conference.&lt;ref name="Stewart 1987, p181"&gt;Stewart (1987), p181&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tōkyō World Design Conference, 1960==

The conference had its roots with Isamu Konmochi and Sori Yanagi who were representatives of the Japanese Committee on the 1956 International Design Conference in [[Aspen, Colorado]]. They suggested that rather than a four yearly conference in Aspen there should be a roving conference with Tōkyō as its first setting in 1960.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p180"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; Three Japanese institutional members were responsible for organising the conference, although after the Japan Industrial Design Association pulled out only the [[Japan Institute of Architects]] and the Japan Association of Advertising Arts were left. In 1958 they formed a preparation committee led by [[Junzo Sakakura]], [[Kunio Maekawa]] and Kenzo Tange. As Tange had just accepted an invitation to be a visiting professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology he recommended his junior colleague Takashi Asada to replace him in the organisation of the conference programmes.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p19"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

The young Asada invited two friends to help him: the architectural critic and former editor of the magazine Shinkenchiku, [[Noboru Kawazoe]], and [[Kisho Kurokawa]] who was one of Tange's students. In turn these two men scouted for more talented designers to help, including: the architects Masato Otaka and Kiyonori Kikutake and the designers [[Kenji Ekuan]] and Kiyoshi Awazu.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p181-182"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 181-182&lt;/ref&gt; Kurokawa was selected because he had recently returned from an international student conference in the Soviet Union and was a student of the [[Marxism|Marxist]] architectural theorist [[Uzō Nishiyama]]. Ekuan was asked because of his recent participation in a seminar given by [[Konrad Wachsmann]]&lt;ref name="Goldhagen and Legault 2000, p283-284"&gt;Goldhagen and Legault (2000), p283-284&lt;/ref&gt; (he arrived at the lecture on a [[Yamaha YA-1|YA-1]] motorbike that he had newly designed for [[Yamaha Motor Company|Yamaha]])&lt;ref name="Goldhagen and Legault 2000, p478"&gt;Goldhagen and Legault (2000), p478&lt;/ref&gt; and Otaka was a junior associate of Kunio Maekawa and had just completed the Harumi Apartment Building in Tōkyō Bay. [[Fumihiko Maki]], a former undergraduate student of Tange also joined the group whilst in Tōkyō on a travelling fellowship from the [[Graham Foundation for Advanced Studies in the Fine Arts|Graham Foundation]].&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p22"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p300"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 300&lt;/ref&gt;

By day Asada canvassed politicians, business leaders and journalists for ideas, by night he met with his young friends to cultivate ideas. Asada was staying at the Ryugetsu Ryokan in [[Asakusa]], Tōkyō and he used it as a meeting place for progressive scholars, architects and artists. He often invited people from other professions to give talks and one of these was the atomic physicist, [[Taketani Mitsuo|Mitsuo Taketani]]. Taketani was a scholar who was also interested in Marxist theory and he brought this along with his scientific theories to the group. Taketani's three stage methodology for scientific research influenced Kikutake's own three stage theory: ''ka'' (the general system), ''kata'' (the abstract image) and ''katachi'' (the solution as built), which he used to summarise his own design process from a broad vision to a concrete architectural form.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p20"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

The group also searched for architectural solutions to Japan's phenomenal urban expansion brought about by its economic growth and how this could be reconciled with its shortage of usable land. They were inspired by examples of circular growth and renewal found in traditional  Japanese architecture like the [[Ise Shrine]] and [[Katsura Detached Palace]].&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p185"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; They worked in coffee shops and Tōkyō's International House to produce a compilation of their works that they could publish as a manifesto for the conference.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p187"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

The conference ran from 11–16 May 1960 and had 227 guests, 84 of whom were international, including the architects [[Louis Kahn]], [[Ralph Erskine (architect)|Ralph Erskine]], [[B. V. Doshi]], [[Jean Prouvé]], [[Paul Rudolph (architect)|Paul Rudolph]] and Peter and Alison Smithson. Japanese participants included Kunio Maekawa, [[Yoshinobu Ashihara]] and [[Kazuo Shinohara]].&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p190-193"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 190-193&lt;/ref&gt;

After his 13 May lecture, Louis Kahn was invited to Kikutake's Sky House and had a long conversation with a number of Japanese architects including the Metabolists. He answered questions until after midnight with Maki acting as translator. Kahn spoke of his universal approach to design and used his own [[Richards Medical Research Laboratories]] as an example of how new design solutions can be reached with new thinking about space and movement. A number of the Metabolists were inspired by this.{{Vague|date=March 2013}}&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p18"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Metabolism name===
[[File:Marine City sketch by Kikutake 1958.jpg|thumb|Marine City sketch by Kikutake, 1958]]
Whilst discussing the organic nature of Kikutake's theoretical Marine City project, Kawazoe used the Japanese word ''shinchintaisha'' as being symbolic of the essential exchange of materials and energy between organisms and the exterior world (literally ''[[metabolism]]'' in a biological sense.) The Japanese meaning of the word has a feeling of ''replacement of the old with the new'' and the group further interpreted this to be equivalent to the continuous renewal and organic growth of the city.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p22"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; As the conference was to be a world conference, Kawazoe felt that they should use a more universal word and Kikutake looked up the definition of ''shinchintaisha'' in his Japanese-English dictionary. The translation he found was the word ''Metabolism''.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p235"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 235&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Metabolism manifesto==
[[File:Marinacity466.JPG|thumb|Kikutake used a photo of [[Marina City]] to illustrate the idea of capsules plugged onto a central tower]]
The group's manifesto ''Metabolism: The Proposals for New Urbanism'' was published at the World Design Conference.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p23"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Two thousand copies of the 90 page book were printed and were sold for ¥500 by Kurokawa and Awazu at the entrance to the venue.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p185"/&gt; The manifesto opened with the following statement:

{{Quote|''Metabolism is the name of the group, in which each member proposes further designs of our coming world through his concrete designs and illustrations. We regard human society as a vital process - a continuous development from atom to nebula. The reason why we use such a biological word, metabolism, is that we believe design and technology should be a denotation of human society. We are not going to accept metabolism as a natural process, but try to encourage active metabolic development of our society through our proposals.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p24"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;''}}

The publication included projects by each member but a third of the document was dedicated to work by Kikutake&lt;ref name="Goldhagen and Legault 2000, p285"&gt;Goldhagen and Legault (2000), p285&lt;/ref&gt; who contributed essays and illustrations on the "Ocean City". Kurokawa contributed "Space City", Kawazoe contributed "Material and Man" and Otaka and Maki wrote "Towards the Group Form".&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p24"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Awazu designed the booklet and Kawazoe's wife, Yasuko edited the layout.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p206"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 206&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the projects included in the manifesto were subsequently displayed at the Museum of Modern Art's 1960 exhibition entitled ''Visionary Architecture'' and exposed the Japanese architects' work to a much wider international audience.&lt;ref name="Goldhagen and Legault 2000, p279"&gt;Goldhagen and Legault (2000), p279&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the more rigid membership structure of Team 10, the Metabolist's saw their movement as having organic form with the members being free to come and go, although the group had cohesion they saw themselves as individuals and their architecture reflected this.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p239 &amp; 301"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 239 &amp; 301&lt;/ref&gt; This was especially true for Tange who remained a mentor for the group rather than an "official" member.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p2"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ocean City===

Kikutake's Ocean City is the first essay in the pamphlet. It covered his two previously published projects "Tower-shaped City" and "Marine City" and included a new project "Ocean City" that was a combination of the first two. The first two of these projects introduced the Metabolist's idea of "artificial land" as well as "major" and "minor" structure.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p25"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Kawazoe referred to "artificial land" in an article in the magazine ''Kindai Kenchiku'' in April 1960. In responding to the scarcity of land in large and expanding cities he proposed creating "artificial land" that would be composed of concrete slabs, oceans or walls (onto which capsules could be plugged). He said that the creation of this "artificial land" would allow people to use other land in a more natural way.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p186"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;

For Marine City, Kikutake proposed a city that would float free in the ocean and would be free of ties to a particular nation and therefore free from the threat of war. The artificial ground of the city would house agriculture, industry and entertainment and the residential towers would descend into the ocean to a depth of 200 metres. The city itself was not tied to the land and was free to float across the ocean and grow organically like an organism. Once it became too aged for habitation it would sink itself.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p27"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Ocean City was a combination of both Tower-shaped City and Marine City. It consisted of two rings that were tangent to one another, with housing on the inner ring and production on the outer one. Administrative buildings were found at the tangent point. The population would have been rigidly controlled at an upper limit of 500,000. Kikutake envisaged that the city would expand by multiplying itself as though it was undergoing cell division. This enforced the Metabolist idea that the expansion of cities could be a biological process.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p28"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;

===Space City===

In his essay "Space City", Kurokawa introduced four projects: Neo-Tōkyō Plan, Wall City, Agricultural City and Mushroom-shaped house. In contrast to Tange's linear Tōkyō City Bay Project, Kurokawa's Neo-Tōkyō Plan proposed that Tōkyō be decentralised and organised into cruciform patterns. He arranged Bamboo-shaped Cities along these cruciforms but unlike Kikutake he kept the city towers lower than 31 metres to conform with Tōkyō's building code&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p28.2"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; (these height limits were not revised until 1968).&lt;ref name="Sorensen 2002, p253"&gt;Sorensen (2002), p. 253&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wall City considered the problem of the ever-expanding distance between the home and the workplace. He proposed a wall-shaped city that could extend indefinitely. Dwellings would be on one side of the wall and workplaces on the other. The wall itself would contain transportation and services.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p30"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

Surviving the [[Typhoon Vera|Ise Bay Typhoon]] in 1959 inspired Kurokawa to design the Agricultural City. It consisted of a grid-like city supported on 4 metre stilts above the ground.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p341"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 341&lt;/ref&gt; The 500 metres square city sat on concrete slab that placed industry and infrastructure above agriculture and was an attempt to combine rural land and the city into one entity.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p30"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; He envisaged that his Mushroom Houses would sprout through the slab of Agriculture City. These houses were shrouded in a mushroom-like cap that was neither wall nor roof that enclosed a tea room and a living space.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p341"/&gt;

===Towards the Group Form===

Maki and Otaka's essay on Group Form placed less emphasis on the megastructures of some of the other Metabolists and focused instead on a more flexible form of urban planning&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p352"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 352&lt;/ref&gt; that could better accommodate rapid and unpredictable requirements of the city.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p34"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

Otaka had first thought about the relationship between infrastructure and architecture in his 1949 graduation thesis and he continued to explore ideas about "artificial ground" during his work at Maekawa's office. Likewise, during his travels abroad, Maki was impressed with the grouping and forms of vernacular buildings.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p32"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; The project they included to illustrate their ideas was a scheme for the redevelopment of [[Shinjuku station]] which included retail, offices and entertainment on an artificial ground over the station.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p352"/&gt; Although Otaka's forms were heavy and sculptural and Maki's were lightweight with large spans, both contained the homogeneous clusters that were associated with group form.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p34"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

===Material and Man===

Kawazoe contributed a brief essay entitled ''I want to be a sea-shell, I want to be a mold, I want to be a spirit''. The essay reflected Japan's cultural anguish after the Second World War and proposed the unity of man and nature.&lt;ref name="Goldhagen and Legault 2000, p286-287"&gt;Goldhagen and Legault (2000), p. 286-287&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plan for Tōkyō, 1960–2025==
[[File:Tokyo Bay Plan by Tange 1960.jpg|thumb|[[Tokyo|Tokyo Bay Plan]], project of the Metabolist and [[Structuralism (architecture)|Structuralist]] movement, 1960 ([[Kenzo Tange]])]]
On 1 January 1961 Kenzo Tange presented his new plan for [[Tokyo Bay|Tōkyō Bay]] (1960) in a 45-minute television programme on [[NHK]].&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p284-292"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 284-292&lt;/ref&gt; The design was a radical plan for the reorganization and expansion of the capital in order to cater for a population beyond 10 million.&lt;ref name="Kulterman 1970, p112"&gt;Kulterman (1970), p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; The design was for a linear city that used a series of nine-kilometre modules that stretched 80&amp;nbsp;km across Tōkyō Bay from [[Ikebukuro]] in the north west to [[Kisarazu, Chiba|Kisarazu]] in the south east. The perimeter of each of the modules was organised into three levels of looping highways, as Tange was adamant that an efficient communication system would be the key to modern living.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p284-292"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kulterman 1970, p112"&gt;Kulterman (1970), p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; The modules themselves were organised into building zones and transport hubs and included office, government administration and retail districts as well as a new Tōkyō train station and highway links to other parts of Tōkyō. Residential areas were to be accommodated on parallel streets that ran perpendicular to the main linear axis and like the Boston Bay project, people would build their own houses within giant A-frame structures.&lt;ref name="Kulterman 1970, p123"&gt;Kulterman (1970), p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

The project was designed by Tange and other members of his studio at Tōkyō University, including Kurokawa and [[Arata Isozaki]]. Originally it was intended to publish the plan at the World Design Conference (hence its "1960" title) but it was delayed because the same  members were working on the Conference organisation.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p144-145"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 144-145&lt;/ref&gt; Tange received interest and support from a number of government agencies but the project was never built.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p284-292"/&gt; Tange went on to expand the idea of the linear city in 1964 with the [[Tōkaidō (region)|Tōkaidō]] Megalopolis Plan. This was an ambitious proposal to extend Tōkyō's linear city across the whole of the Tōkaidō region of Japan in order to re-distribute the population.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p680"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 680&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Kikutake and Kurokawa capitalised on the interest in Tange's 1960 plan by producing their own schemes for Tōkyō. Kikutake's plan incorporated three elements both on the land and the sea and included a looped highway that connected all the [[Prefectures of Japan|prefectures]] around the bay. Unlike Tange however its simple presentation graphics put many people off. Kurokawa's plan consisted of helix-shaped megastructures floating inside cells that extended out across the bay. Although the scheme's more convincing graphics were presented as part of a film the project was not built.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p284-292"/&gt;

With Japan's [[Japanese asset price bubble|property boom]] in the 1980s, both Tange and Kurokawa revisited their earlier ideas: Tange with his Tōkyō Plan 1986 and Kurokawa with his New Tōkyō Plan 2025. Both projects used land that had been reclaimed from the sea since the 1960s in combination with floating structures.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p284-292"/&gt;

==Selected built projects==

===Yamanashi Press and Broadcaster Centre===

In 1961 Kenzo Tange received a commission from the Yamanashi News Group to design a new office in [[Kōfu, Yamanashi|Kōfu]]. As well as two news firms and a printing company the building needed to incorporate a cafeteria and shops at ground floor level to interface with the adjoining city. It also needed to be flexible in its design to allow future expansion.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p179-180"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 179-180&lt;/ref&gt;

Tange organised the spaces of the three firms by function to allow them to share common facilities. He stacked these functions vertically according to need, for example, the printing plant is on the ground floor to facilitate access to the street for loading and transportation. He then took all the service functions including elevators, toilets and pipes and grouped them into 16 reinforced concrete cylindrical towers, each with an equal 5 metre diameter. These he placed on a grid into which he inserted the functional group facilities and offices. These inserted elements were conceived of as containers that were independent of the structure and could be arranged flexibly as required. This conceived flexibility distinguished Tange's design from other architects' designs with open floor offices and service cores – such as Kahn's Richards Medical Research Laboratories. Tange deliberately finished the cylindrical towers at different heights to imply that there was room for vertical expansion.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p179-180"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 179-180&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the building was expanded in 1974 as Tange had originally envisioned,&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p363"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 363&lt;/ref&gt; it did not act as a catalyst for the expansion of the building into a megastructure across the rest of the city. The building was criticised for forsaking the human use of the building in preference to the structure and adaptability.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p186"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shizuoka Press and Broadcasting Tower===

In 1966 Tange designed the Shizuoka Press and Broadcasting Tower in the [[Ginza]] district of Tōkyō. This time using only a single core Tange arranged the offices as cantilevered steel and glass boxes. The cantilever is emphasised by punctuating the three storey blocks with a single storey glazed balcony.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p188"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; The concrete forms of the building were cast using aluminium [[formwork]] and the aluminium has been left on as a cladding.&lt;ref name="Watanabe 2001, p135"&gt;Watanabe (2001), p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; Although conceived as a "core-type" system that was included in Tange's other city proposals, the tower stands alone and is robbed of other connections.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p188"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 188&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nakagin Capsule Tower===

The icon of Metabolism, Kurokawa's [[Nakagin Capsule Tower]] was erected in the Ginza district of Tōkyō in 1972 and completed in just 30 days.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p388"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 388&lt;/ref&gt; Prefabricated in [[Shiga Prefecture]] in a factory that normally built shipping containers, it is constructed of 140 capsules plugged into two cores that are 11 and 13 stories in height. The capsules contained the latest gadgets of the day and were built to house small offices and [[pied-à-terre|pieds-à-terre]] for Tōkyō [[Salaryman|salarymen]].&lt;ref name="Watanabe 2001, p148-149"&gt;Watanabe (2001), p. 148-149&lt;/ref&gt;

The capsules are constructed of light steel welded trusses covered with steel sheeting mounted onto the reinforced concrete cores. The capsules are 2.5 metres wide and four metres long with a 1.3 metre diameter window at one end. The units originally contained a bed, storage cabinets, a bathroom, a colour television set, clock, refrigerator and air conditioner, although optional extras such as a stereo were available. Although the capsules were designed with [[mass production]] in mind there was never a demand for them.&lt;ref name="Watanabe 2001, p148-149"/&gt; [[Nobuo Abe]], was a senior manager, managing one of the design divisions on the construction of the [[Nakagin Capsule Tower]]

Since 1996 the tower has been listed as an architectural heritage by [[Docomomo International|DoCoMoMo]]. However, in 2007 the residents voted to tear the tower down and build a new 14-storey tower. The tower still stands today and has approximately 15 people living inside. In 2010, the pods that are still safe to live in and not falling apart inside have become a hotel for a mere $30 American a night on average.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p233"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 233&lt;/ref&gt; However, as of 2017 many capsules have been renovated and are being used as residential and office spaces, while short-stay renting such as Airbnb or other lodging provisions have been banned by the administration of the building.

===Hillside Terrace, Tōkyō===

After the World Design Conference Maki began to distance himself from Metabolist movement, although his studies in ''Group Form'' continued to be of interest to the Metabolists.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p23"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964 he published a booklet entitled ''Investigations in Collective Form'' in which he investigated three urban forms: Compositional-form, Megastructure and Group Form.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p111"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; The Hillside Terrace is a series of projects commissioned by the Asakura family and undertaken in seven phases from 1967 to 1992. It includes residential, office and cultural buildings as well as the Royal Danish Embassy and is situated on both sides of Kyū-Yamate avenue in the [[Daikanyamachō, Shibuya|Daikanyama]] district of Tōkyō.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p119"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

The execution of the designs evolves through the phases with exterior forms becoming more independent of the interior functions and new materials being employed. For example, the first phase has a raised pedestrian deck that gives access to shops and a restaurant and this was designed to be extended in subsequent phases but the idea, along with the original master plan, was discarded in later phases.&lt;ref name="Watanabe 2001, p139"&gt;Watanabe (2001), p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; By the third phase Maki moved away from the Modernist maxim of ''form follows function'' and started to design the building exteriors to better match the immediate environment.&lt;ref name="Watanabe 2001, p157"&gt;Watanabe (2001), p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; The project acted as a catalyst to the redevelopment of the whole area around [[Daikan-yama Station|Daikanyama Station]].&lt;ref name="Watanabe 2001, p139"&gt;Watanabe (2001), p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metabolism in context==

[[File:Tokyo 1945-3-10-1.jpg|thumb|Tōkyō after bombing, 1945]]

Metabolism developed during the post war period in a Japan that questioned its cultural identity. Initially the group had chosen the name ''Burnt Ash School'' to reflect the ruined state of firebombed Japanese cities and the opportunity they presented for radical re-building. Ideas of nuclear physics and biological growth were linked with [[Buddhism in Japan|Buddhist]] concepts of regeneration.&lt;ref name="Goldhagen and Legault 2000, p287"&gt;Goldhagen and Legault (2000), p. 287&lt;/ref&gt; Although Metabolism rejected visual references from the past,&lt;ref name="Goldhagen and Legault 2000, p289"&gt;Goldhagen and Legault (2000), p. 289&lt;/ref&gt; they embraced concepts of prefabrication and renewal from traditional Japanese architecture, especially the twenty-year cycle of the rebuilding of the [[Ise Grand Shrine|Ise Shrine]] (to which Tange and Kawazoe were invited in 1953). The sacred rocks onto which the shrine is built were seen by the Metabolists as symbolising a Japanese spirit that predated [[Empire of Japan|Imperial]] aspirations and modernising influences from the West.&lt;ref name="Goldhagen and Legault 2000, p290-291"&gt;Goldhagen and Legault (2000), p. 290-292&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''Investigations in Collective Form'' Maki coined the term ''Megastructure'' to refer structures that house the whole or part of a city in a single structure. He originated the idea from vernacular forms of village architecture that were projected into vast structures with the aid of modern technology. [[Reyner Banham]] borrowed ''Megastructure'' for the title of his 1976 book which contained numerous built and unbuilt projects. He defined ''Megastructures'' as modular units (with a short life span) that attached to structural framework (with a longer life span).&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p10"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Maki would later criticise the ''Megastructure'' approach to design advocating instead his idea of ''Group Form'' which he thought would better accommodate the disorder of the city.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p11"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

The architect [[Robin Boyd (architect)|Robin Boyd]] readily interchanges the word Metabolism with [[Archigram]] in his 1968 book ''New Directions in Japanese Architecture''.&lt;ref name="Boyd 1968, p16"&gt;Boyd (1968), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the two groups both emerged in the 1960s and disbanded in the 1970s and used imagery with megastructures and cells, but their urban and architectural proposals were quite different. Although utopian in their ideals, the Metabolists were concerned with improving the social structure of society with their biologically inspired architecture, whereas Archigram were influenced by mechanics, information and electronic media and their architecture was more utopian and less social.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p11"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Osaka Expo, 1970==

[[File:Osaka Expo'70 Festival Plaza.jpg|thumb|The roof of the Festival Plaza, Osaka Expo 1970]]
[[File:EXPO TOWER.JPG|thumb|Kikutake's Expo Tower, Osaka Expo 1970]]
[[File:Toshiba-IHI Pavilion.jpg|thumb|Kurokawa's Toshiba-IHI Pavilion, Osaka Expo 1970]]

Japan was selected as the site for the  [[Expo '70|1970 World Exposition]] and 330 hectares in the Senri Hills in [[Osaka Prefecture]] were set aside as the location.&lt;ref name="Kulterman 1970, p282"&gt;Kulterman (1970), p. 282&lt;/ref&gt; Japan had originally wanted to host a World Exposition in 1940 but it was cancelled with the escalation of the war. The one million people who had bought tickets for 1940 were allowed to use them in 1970.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p506-507"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 506-507&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenzo Tange joined the Theme Committee for the Expo and along with Uso Nishiyama he had responsibility for master planning the site. The theme for the Expo became "Progress and Harmony for Mankind". Tange invited twelve architects, including [[Arata Isozaki]], Otaka and Kikutake to design individual elements.&lt;ref name="Kulterman 1970, p282"&gt;Kulterman (1970), p. 282&lt;/ref&gt; He also asked Ekuan to oversee the design of the furniture and transportation and Kawazoe to curate the Mid-Air Exhibition which was sited in the huge space-frame roof.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p506-507"/&gt;

Tange envisioned that the Expo should be primarily conceived as a big festival where human beings could meet. Central to the site he placed the Festival Plaza onto which were connected a number of themed displays, all of which were united under one huge roof.&lt;ref name="Kulterman 1970, p284"&gt;Kulterman (1970), p. 284&lt;/ref&gt; In his Tōkyō Bay Project Tange spoke about the living body having two types of information transmission systems: fluid and electronic. That project used the idea of a tree trunk and branches that would carry out those types of transmission in relation to the city. Kawazoe likened the [[space frame]] roof of the Festival Plaza to the electronic transmission system and the aerial-themed displays that plugged into it to the hormonal system.&lt;ref name="Tange &amp; Kawazoe, p31"&gt;Tange &amp; Kawazoe (1970), p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

Kawazoe, Maki and Kurokawa had invited a selection of world architects to design displays for the Mid-Air Exhibition that was to be incorporated within the roof. The architects included [[Moshe Safdie]], [[Yona Friedman]], [[Hans Hollein]] and [[Giancarlo De Carlo]].&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p516"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 516&lt;/ref&gt; Although Tange was obsessed with the theory of flexibility that the space framed provide he did concede that in reality it was not so practical for the actual fixing of the displays.&lt;ref name="Tange &amp; Kawazoe, p31"/&gt; The roof itself was designed by Koji Kamaya and Mamoru Kawaguchi who conceived it as a huge space frame. Kawaguchi invented a welding-free [[ball joint]] to safely distribute the load and worked out a method of assembling the frame on the ground before raising it using [[Jack (device)|jacks]].&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p511"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 511&lt;/ref&gt;

Kikutake's Expo Tower was situated on the highest hill in the grounds and acted as a landmark for visitors. It was built of a vertical ball and joint space onto which was attached a series of cabins. The design was to have been a blueprint for flexible vertical living based upon a 360m3 standard construction cabin clad with a membrane of cast aluminium and glass that could be flexibly arranged anywhere on the tower. This was demonstrated with a variety of cabins that were observation platforms and VIP rooms and one cabin at ground level that became an information booth.&lt;ref name="Kikutake Assocs, p69"&gt;Kikutake Assocs (1970), p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurokawa had won commissions for two corporate pavilions: the Takara Beautillion and the Toshiba IHI pavilion.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p507"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 507&lt;/ref&gt; The former of these was composed of capsules plugged onto six point frames and was assembled in just six days; the latter was a space frame composed of tetrahedron modules, based upon his Helix City that could grow in 14 different directions and resemble organic growth.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p528-530"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 528-530&lt;/ref&gt;

Expo '70 has been described has the apotheosis of the Metabolist movement.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p506-507"/&gt; But even before Japan's period of rapid economic growth ended with the [[1973 oil crisis|world energy crisis]], critics were calling the Expo a dystopia that was removed from reality.&lt;ref name="Sasaki, p143"&gt;Sasaki (1970), p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; The energy crisis demonstrated Japan's reliance both on imported oil and led to a re-evaluation of design and planning with architects moving away from utopian projects towards smaller urban interventions.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p228"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 228&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==

[[File:Model of Aquapolis.JPG|thumb|Model of the Aquapolis, Okinawa Ocean Expo 1975]]
[[File:Kuwait Embassy and Chancellery in Japan.jpg|thumb|Kuwait Embassy and Chancellery of Japan (1970)]]

After the 1970 Expo, Tange and the Metabolists turned their attention away from Japan towards the Middle East and Africa. These countries were expanding on the back of income from oil and were fascinated by both Japanese culture and the expertise that the Metabolists brought to urban planning.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p591"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 591&lt;/ref&gt; Tange and Kurokawa capitalised on the majority of the commissions, but Kikutake and Maki were involved too.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p594-595"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 594-595&lt;/ref&gt;

Tange's projects included a 57,000 seat stadium and sports center in [[Riyadh]] for [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|King Faisal]], and a sports city for [[Kuwait]] for the planned 1974 Pan Arab Games. However, both were put on hold by the outbreak of the [[Yom Kippur War|Fourth Arab-Israeli War]] in 1973. Likewise, the plan for a new city center in [[Tehran]] was cancelled after the [[Iranian Revolution|1979 revolution]]. He did however complete the Kuwaiti Embassy in Tōkyō in 1970 and Kuwait's International Airport.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p606-610"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 606-610&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurokawa's work included a competition win for [[Abu Dhabi|Abu Dhabi's]] National Theatre (1977), capsule-tower designs for a hotel in [[Baghdad]] (1975) and a city in the desert in [[Libya]] (1979–1984).&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p620-630"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 620-630&lt;/ref&gt;

Kikutake's vision for floating towers was partly realised in 1975 when he designed and built the Aquapolis for the [[Expo '75|Okinawa Ocean Expo]]. The 100 x 100 meter floating city block contained accommodation that included a banquet hall, offices and residences for 40 staff and it was built in [[Hiroshima]] and then towed to [[Okinawa]].&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p152-153"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 152-153&lt;/ref&gt; Further unbuilt floating city projects were undertaken, including a floating city in [[Hawaii]] for ocean research and a plug-in floating A-frame unit containing housing and offices that could have been used to provide mobile homes in the event of a natural disaster.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p673-675"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 673-675&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7392">A '''metasystem transition''' is the [[emergence]], through [[evolution]], of a higher [[:wikt:level|level]] of [[organization]] or [[Control theory|control]].

A [[metasystem]] is formed by the integration of a number of initially independent components, such as [[molecules]] (as theorized for instance by [[Hypercycle_(chemistry)|hypercycles]]), [[cell (biology)|cells]], or individuals, and the emergence of a system steering or controlling their interactions. As such, the collective of components becomes a new, goal-directed [[individual]], capable of acting in a coordinated way. This metasystem is more [[Complex systems|complex]], more [[intelligent]], and more flexible in its actions than the initial component systems. Prime examples are the [[origin of life]], the transition from unicellular to [[multicellular]] organisms, the emergence of [[eusociality]] or [[symbol]]ic [[thought]]. 

The concept of metasystem transition was introduced by the cybernetician [[Valentin Turchin]] in his 1970 book ''The Phenomenon of Science'', and developed among others by [[Francis Heylighen]] in the [[Principia Cybernetica]] Project. The related notion of [[The Major Transitions in Evolution|evolutionary transition]] was proposed by the biologists [[John Maynard Smith]] and [[Eörs Szathmáry]], in their 1995 book ''[[The Major Transitions in Evolution]]''.&lt;ref name="Major Transition"&gt;Smith, J. M., &amp; Szathmary, E. (1997). ''The Major Transitions in Evolution''. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Another related idea, that systems ("operators") evolve to become more complex by successive closures encapsulating components in a larger whole, is proposed in "[[the operator theory]]", developed by Gerard Jagers op Akkerhuis.

Turchin has applied the concept of metasystem transition in the domain of computing, via the notion of [[metacompilation]] or supercompilation. A supercompiler is a compiler program that compiles its own code, thus increasing its own efficiency, producing a remarkable speedup in its execution.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

== Evolutionary quanta ==

The following is the classical sequence of metasystem transitions in the history of animal evolution according to Turchin, from the origin of [[animal|animate]] life to [[sapience|sapient]] culture:

#''' Control of Position = [[motility|Motion]]''': the animal or agent develops the ability to control its position in space
# '''Control of Motion = [[sentience|Irritability]]''': the movement of the agent is no longer given, but a reaction to elementary sensations or stimuli
# '''Control of Irritability = [[Reflex]]''': different elementary sensations and their resulting actions are integrated into a coordinated, but still rigid, reflex-like behavior
# '''Control of Reflex = [[Association (psychology)|Association]]''': behavioral routines become flexible or adaptive, through the learning of new associations between experienced stimuli and actions
# '''Control of Association = [[Thought]]''': new routines no longer need to be learned through experience; they can be developed by abstract, symbolic [[reasoning]]
# '''Control of Thought = [[Culture]]''': symbols and concepts are no longer fixed entities; they  adapt through a process of [[cultural evolution]]

== Contemporary perspectives ==

[[File:Major Evolutionary Transitions digital.jpg|thumb|340px|Schematic timeline of information and replicators in the biosphere: [[The Major Transitions in Evolution|major evolutionary transitions]] in information processing&lt;ref name=" InfoBiosphere2016"/&gt;]]

Many{{who|date=December 2016}} argue that the next human metasystem transition consists of a merger of biological metasystems with technological metasystems, especially information processing technology. Several [[The Major Transitions in Evolution|cumulative major transitions of evolution]] have transformed life through key innovations in information storage and replication, including [[RNA]], [[DNA]], [[multicellularity]], and also [[language]] and [[culture]] as inter-human information processing systems.&lt;ref name="Major Transition"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jablonka, E., &amp; Szathmáry, E. (1995). The evolution of information storage and heredity. Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution, 10(5), 206–211. http://doi.org/10.1016/S0169-5347(00)89060-6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Szathmáry, E. (2015). Toward major evolutionary transitions theory 2.0. ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'', 112(33), 10104–10111. http://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1421398112&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense it can be argued that the carbon-based biosphere has generated a [[cognitive system]] (humans) capable of creating technology that will result in a comparable evolutionary transition. "Digital information has reached a similar magnitude to information in the biosphere... Like previous evolutionary transitions, the potential symbiosis between biological and digital information will reach a critical point where these codes could compete via natural selection. Alternatively, this fusion could create a higher-level superorganism employing a low-conflict division of labor in performing informational tasks... humans already embrace fusions of biology and technology. We spend most of our waking time communicating through digitally mediated channels, ...most transactions on the stock market are executed by automated trading algorithms, and our electric grids are in the hands of artificial intelligence. With one in three marriages in America beginning online, digital algorithms are also taking a role in human pair bonding and reproduction".&lt;ref name="InfoBiosphere2016"&gt;[http://doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2015.12.013 "Information in the Biosphere: Biological and Digital Worlds"], Gillings, M.

'''Michel Boivin''' is a [[France|French]] [[historian]] and [[anthropologist]] who specializes in the [[Muslim world]]. Trained in contemporary history, Islamic studies and ethnology, he is currently Senior Research Fellow at the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique]] (CNRS: French National Center for Scientific Research) and a member of the CEIAS (Center for South Asian Studies) at the [[School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences]] (EHESS). He teaches at the EHESS, where he supervises Masters and Ph.D. students. He also gives courses on contemporary constructions of secularism in Europe and in the Muslim world at the Université de Savoie Mont Blanc, and on the [[historical anthropology]] of South Asia at Sciences Po Lyon. In 2011, he created the Centre for Social Sciences in Karachi (CSSK), which is hosted by the Alliance Française in Karachi, as well as a collection published by Oxford University Press in Pakistan, the "CSSK Series." Since 2013, he has been co-directing two seminars at the EHESS: “History and Anthropology of the Muslim Societies of South Asia” and “Authority and Politics in the Sufism of South and Central Asia.” In addition, he contributes to the organization of two CEIAS research groups: “Vernacular Cultures and New Muslim Elites,” with Julien Levesque, and “Gujarati and Sindhi Studies: Societies, Languages and Cultures,” with Pierre Lachaier.

== Biography ==
After studying at Chambéry high school with an emphasis in the humanities, Michel Boivin became an expert on the Modern history of the Muslim world. He holds a DEA in Arabic and Islamic studies from the Université Lyon 2, and obtained a doctorat in Oriental Languages, Civilizations and Societies from the Université Paris 3-Sorbonne Nouvelle on Isma’ilian Shi’ism and Modernity in Sultân Muhammad Shâh Aghâ Khân (1877-1957), and then an habilitation thesis in ethnology from the Université Paris Ouest-Nanterre, on the topic of Shi’ism, Sufism and Social dynamics in Contemporary Sindh (19th century-20th century).
Michel Boivin is specialized in the study of the contemporary history and historical anthropology of Muslim communities in India and Pakistan during the colonial period, and since independence was obtained. After having devoted several years to the study of the Isma’ilians of these regions, he shifted his focus to Sufi groups. He directs a research team on “History and Sufism in the Indus Valley” at the CEIAS (EHESS-CNRS). From 2008 to 2011, this team has worked on an interdisciplinary and international project centered on the Sufi site of Sehwan Sharif. This mid-size city located in the southern Province of Pakistan called Sindh is where the tomb of the Sufi saint Lal Shahbaz Qalandar (d. 1274) is located. This sanctuary has become a site of pilgrimage where ecstatic dance practices take place. In addition, it is also an ecumenical center, as Hindus still play an important part in the rituals. Finally, Sehwan Sharif is a gathering place for gyrovague renouncers, used to be called “qalandars” and are now most often referred to as “malangs.”

One of his most recent research interests is in “Hindu Sufism” in Pakistan and India. To start out, Michel Boivin retraced the migratory paths of Sindhi Hindus, then researched their Sufi rituals in order to evaluate the extent to which they had to change to adapt to their new environment. In parallel, he has begun work on collecting the publications and manuscripts on Sufism in the Sindhi language. Despite his emphasis on historical anthropology, Michel Boivin continues to work on the appearance of new forms of knowledge in the 19th century. He is particularly interested in the production of a new culture in the Sindh province as a result of interaction between British colonial rule, the emergence of new elites and the objectification of Sufism. His work is therefore to be understood as a continuation of postcolonial studies, as he is engaged in reconstructing the evolution of the “Sufi culture of Sindh” based on archival work carried out in the Indian sub-continent and in Europe.

'''Peter Nicholas Tarling''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|MNZM|size=85%}} (1 February 1931 – 13 May 2017) was a historian, academic, and author. He specialised in Southeast Asian history, and wrote on 18th- and 19th-century Malaysia, [[North Borneo]], Philippines, and [[Laos]], especially regarding foreign involvement in those countries.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Nicholas Tarling was born on 1 February 1931 in [[Iver]], [[Buckinghamshire]], England, and obtained his secondary education at [[St Albans School (Hertfordshire)|St. Albans School]].&lt;ref name=Ooi&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ooi Keat Gin |date=June 2009 |title=Peter Nicholas Tarling: A tribute |url= http://www.nzasia.org.nz/downloads/NZJAS-June09/6_Tribute_4.pdf |journal=New Zealand Journal of Asian Studies |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=15–30 |access-date=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an undergraduate at [[Christ's College, Cambridge|Christ's College]], Cambridge, he was supervised by, among others, Sir [[John H. Plumb]]. He also earned his PhD at Cambridge, supervised by Dr [[Victor Purcell]].

===Career===
In 1957 he took up a teaching post at the [[University of Queensland]] in Gordon Greenwood's Department of History and Political Science.  There, he taught courses in both European and Asian history. During those years he visited Southeast Asia and the US, and published three books: a revised version of his thesis; ''Anglo-Dutch Relations in the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] World''; ''Piracy and Politics in the Malay World''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/20633968 |year=1964 |last1=Swift |first1=Michael |title=Piracy and Politics in the Malay World |journal=The Australian Quarterly |publisher=[[Australian Institute of Political Science]] |volume=36 |pages=109–111 |issue=2 |last2=Tarling |first2=Nicholas }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965 Tarling was appointed [[associate professor]] at the [[University of Auckland]] in New Zealand, and in 1968 he became a [[full professor]], still as a European and Asian history teacher. He also held posts as Dean of the Faculty of Arts, Chairman of the Deans Committee, and Deputy Vice-Chancellor. He also served on a number of inter-university and government committees.&lt;ref name=nzh&gt;{{cite news |title=Crisis of Identity?

He retired in 1996. He was a Fellow of the New Zealand Asia Institute and served for a while as director of the institute and later of the International Office. He was also a visiting Professor at [[University of Brunei Darussalam]] and honorary professor at [[University of Hull]].&lt;ref name=Ooi/&gt;

He was awarded the Cambridge [[Doctor of Letters|Litt.D.]] in 1974 and given an honorary Litt.D. by the [[University of Auckland]] in 1996.

==History==
The Osemawe title of [[Ondo Kingdom]] was instituted in 1510, when princess Pupupu, a powerful daughter of the late Alaafin of [[Oyo Empire|Oyo]], king Oluaso left the palace with the royal entourage in a bid to settle far from her father's palace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agoiwoye.org/history-of-ondo-town/|title=History of Ondo Town|author=Ajibola|work=Ago-Iwoye!

She settled on a hill called ''Oke Agunla'' in [[Ondo Kingdom|Ondo town]]
On arrival of this princess at ''Oke Ogunla'' a smoke rising from far below was spotted by a man called ''Esiri'' who traced the smoke to know its source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ekimogundescendant.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=58:-the-genesis-of-ondo-kingdom&amp;catid=34:articles&amp;Itemid=53|title=The Genesis of Ondo Kingdom|author=Administrator|publisher=|accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On getting to the hill where the smoke was spotted, he met princess Pupupu and her royal entourage.

In 1671 an argument broke out in the French [[Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture|Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture]] in Paris about whether drawing or color was more important in painting. On one side stood the '''Poussinists''' (Fr. ''Poussinistes'') who were a group of French artists, named after the painter [[Nicolas Poussin]], who believed that drawing was the most important thing.&lt;ref name=BritP&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/473126/Poussinist Poussinist] ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', 2014. Retrieved 27 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other side were the '''Rubenists''' (Fr. ''Rubénistes''), named after [[Peter Paul Rubens]], who prioritize color.&lt;ref name=BritR&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/511893/Rubenist Rubenist] ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', 2014. Retrieved 27 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; There was a strong nationalistic flavour to the debate as Poussin was French but Rubens was [[Flemish]], though neither was alive at the time. After over forty years the final resolution of the matter in favor of the Rubenists was signalled when [[Antoine Watteau|Antoine Watteau's]] ''[[The Embarkation for Cythera]]'' was accepted as his [[reception piece]] by the French Academy in 1717.&lt;ref name=BritR/&gt; By that time the French [[Rococo]] was in full swing.

==The argument==
The Poussinists believed in the [[Platonic realism|Platonic]] idea of the existence in the mind of ideal objects that could be reconstructed in concrete form by the selection, using reason, of elements from nature. For the Poussinists, therefore, color was a purely decorative addition to form and drawing (design or ''[[disegno]]''), the use of line to depict form, was the essential skill of painting. Their leader was [[Charles Lebrun]]&lt;ref name=HF&gt;[[Hugh Honour|Honour, H.]] and J. Fleming, (2009) ''A World History of Art''. 7th edn. London: Laurence King Publishing, p. 609. {{ISBN|9781856695848}}&lt;/ref&gt; (died 1690), Director of the Academy, and their heroes were [[Raphael]], [[the Carracci]], and Poussin himself&lt;ref name=BritP/&gt; whose severe and stoical works exemplified their philosophy. Their touchstones were the forms of classical art.
[[Image:Peter Paul Rubens 083.jpg|thumb|right|''[[The Hippopotamus and Crocodile Hunt|Hippopotamus Hunt]]'', Rubens, 1616.]]
They were opposed by the Rubenists who believed that colour, not drawing, was superior as it was more true to nature.&lt;ref name=Janson/&gt; Their models were the works of Rubens who had prioritised the accurate depiction of nature over the imitation of classical art. The Rubenists argued that the aim of painting was to deceive the eye by creating an imitation of nature.&lt;ref name=BritR/&gt; Drawing, according to the Rubenists, although based on reason, appealed only to a few experts whereas colour could be enjoyed by everyone. The ideas of the Rubenists therefore had revolutionary political connotations as they elevated the position of the lay person and challenged the idea that had held sway since the [[Renaissance]] that painting, as a [[Liberal arts education|liberal art]], could only be appreciated by the educated mind.&lt;ref name=Janson&gt;[[H. W. Janson|Janson, H.W.]] (1995) ''History of Art''. 5th edn. Revised and expanded by Anthony F. Janson. London: [[Thames &amp; Hudson]], p. 604. {{ISBN|0500237018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1672, [[Charles Le Brun]], Chancellor of the French Academy, attempted to halt the argument by stating officially that "the function of colour is to satisfy the eyes, whereas drawing satisfies the mind."&lt;ref name=BritP/&gt; He failed, and the debate was continued in the pamphlets of [[Roger de Piles]], who favoured the colourists and set out the arguments in his 1673 ''Dialogue sur le Coloris'' (Dialogue on Colour), and his 1677 ''Conversations sur la Peinture'' (Conversations on Painting).

The argument was similar to the argument over the merits of ''disegno'' and ''colore'' in Italy in the fifteenth century but with a particularly French character as the importance of drawing was one of the key tenets of the French Academy and any attack on it was effectively an attack on everything the Academy stood for, including its political functions in support of the King.
 
To a certain extent, the debate was simply about whether it was acceptable to paint purely in order to give pleasure to the viewer without the nobler purposes typical of a "history" painting.&lt;ref name=Lev&gt;Levey, Michael. (1993) ''Painting and sculpture in France 1700-1789''. New Haven: [[Yale University Press]], p. 1. {{ISBN|0300064942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resolution==
[[Image:L'Embarquement pour Cythere, by Antoine Watteau, from C2RMF retouched.jpg|thumb|right|Watteau's ''[[The Embarkation for Cythera]]'', 1717.]] 
A success for the Rubenists was achieved when Roger de Piles was elected a member (as an amateur) of the French Academy in 1699 and the final signal that the Rubenists had won came when [[Antoine Watteau]]'s ''The Embarkation for Cythera'' was accepted as his reception piece by the Academy in 1717.&lt;ref name=BritR/&gt;

Watteau's acceptance was, however, perhaps not everything that he could have hoped for. When he applied to join the Academy, there was no suitable category for his ''[[fête galante]]'' works, so the academy simply created one rather than reject his application, describing him as a "peintre des festes galantes".&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, Fred, S. (Ed.) (2011) ''Gardner's Art Through the Ages: A global history''.  Enhanced 13th edn. Boston: Wadsworth, p. 755. {{ISBN|978-0-495-79986-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, M. &amp; D. (2010) "fête galante" in ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Art Terms''. oxfordreference.com, [[Oxford University Press]]. Retrieved 8 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; While this acknowledged Watteau as the originator of that genre, and was a significant mark of acceptance both of him and his style of painting, it also prevented him being recognised as a [[History painting|history painter]], the highest class of painter, and the only one from which the academy's professors were drawn. Charles-Antoine Coypel, the son of its then director, tellingly said: "The charming paintings of this gracious painter would be a bad guide for whoever wished to paint the Acts of the Apostles."&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey Wine and Annie Scottez-De Wambrechies. "Watteau" in ''Grove Art Online''. [http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T090852pg1 oxfordartonline.com] Oxford University Press. Retrieved 8 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Watteau is considered the greatest of the Rubenist artists. Other important Rubenists include [[François Boucher]] and [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard]]. [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin]] benefited from the new found interest in [[still-life]] and [[genre painting]].&lt;ref&gt;Janson, 1995, p. 607.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
The debate and the overlapping development of the Rococo in eighteenth century France have been seen as a form of revival. [[Michael Levey]] has pointed out that it was during the seventeenth century that the new categories of [[Genre art|genre]], [[Landscape art|landscape]] and still life had become established with their emphasis on the observation of nature, and therefore the arguments of the Rubenists amounted to a revival of existing traditions of naturalism and a call for a greater discipline in painting rather than representing an attitude of general licence or ''laissez faire'' as is sometimes assumed.&lt;ref name=Lev/&gt;

The argument also took place during the beginning of the [[Enlightenment Era|Enlightenment]] and the Rubenists found support in [[John Locke|John Locke's]] ''[[Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1690) which argued that all ideas derived from experience and that none were innate. [[Jean-Baptiste Dubos]] observed that what was comprehended through the mind paled compared to what was apprehended through the senses.&lt;ref name=HF/&gt;

==Early life and career==
Maines was born in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]] and received her BA in [[classics]] with a specialization in ancient science and technology from the [[University of Pittsburgh]] in 1971. She received her PhD in applied history and social science from [[Carnegie Mellon University]] in 1983 with a doctoral dissertation entitled ''Textiles for Defense: Emergency Policy for Textiles and Apparel in the Twentieth Century''.&lt;ref name = "Cornell"&gt;[[Cornell University]]. [https://courses.cit.cornell.edu/rpm24/ Dr. Rachel P. Maines]. Retrieved 26 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of her early scholarship centered on the history of textiles and needlework. She was one of the founders of the Center for the History of American Needlework in Pittsburgh.&lt;ref&gt;Sexton, Sharon (12 December 1975). [https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/47652860/ "Needle Art Reveals History"], p. 22. ''[[Mansfield News Journal]]'' via [[UPI]]. Retrieved 26 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; 

She is married to Garrel S. Pottinger, PhD, a retired professor of Philosophy, with whom she has written several books.&lt;ref&gt;[Crater Lake National Park (N.P.), General Management Plan: Environmental Impact Statement, p. 265, middle, right side]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.craterlakeinstitute.com/online-library/historical-scientific-resources/historical-scientific-resources.pdf Historical and Scientific Resources on Crater Lake National Park, 392 pages, 17 March 1998, prepared by Rachel P. Maines and Associates under contract for the National Park Service. Ithaca, NY]&lt;/ref&gt;  They have a daughter, Rachel Amanda Pottinger of [[Acme, Washington]].

==Vibrator research==
While researching needlework in late 19th- and early 20th-century women's magazines, Maines encountered what she would argue were highly circumspect advertisements for [[Vibrator (sex toy)|vibrator]]s. The advertisements, she claimed, showed women using the electrical devices to massage their necks and backs but the accompanying text described the devices as "thrilling, invigorating" and promised that "all the penetrating pleasures of youth will throb in you again". Maines recalled in a 1999 interview, "I kept thinking to myself, this can't be what I think it is."&lt;ref name = "Kling"&gt;Kling, Cynthia (14 August 1999). [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/objects-of-desire-1112880.html "Objects of Desire"]. ''[[The Independent]]''. Retrieved 26 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; 

She then began researching and writing articles on the history of vibrators, the first one for the newsletter of the [[Bakken Museum|Bakken Museum of Electricity in Life]]. According to Maines, the article caused her to lose her post as associate professor at [[Clarkson University]] in 1986 because the university was convinced that the nature of her research would drive away benefactors and alumni donors. Three years later she submitted a more detailed article, "Socially Camouflaged Technologies: The Case of the Electromechanical Vibrator", to ''Society and Technology'', the magazine of the [[IEEE Society on Social Implications of Technology]]. Initially, the IEEE thought the article was a joke perpetrated by the magazine's editors and that there was no such person as Rachel Maines. However, after checking all the internal citations and Maines's own background, the IEEE finally allowed the article to be published in the June 1989 edition of the magazine.&lt;ref name = "Kling" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Upson, Sandra (1 August 2007).

''IEEE Specturm''. Retrieved 26 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Her book-length treatment of the subject, ''The Technology of Orgasm'', was published in 1998 by Johns Hopkins University Press. Subtitled ''"Hysteria," the Vibrator, and Women's Sexual Satisfaction'', it won the [[American Historical Association]]'s [[Herbert Feis#Herbert Feis Award|Herbert Feis Award]] and was the inspiration for [[Sarah Ruhl]]'s 2009 play ''[[In the Next Room (or The Vibrator Play)|In the Next Room ]]'' and [[Tanya Wexler]]'s 2011 film ''[[Hysteria (2011 film)|Hysteria]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Wypijewski, JoAnn (30 May 2012).

Retrieved 26 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The book also formed the basis for ''Passion &amp; Power'', a 2007 documentary by [[Emiko Omori]] and Wendy Slick.&lt;ref&gt;Straus, Tamara (22 February 2008).

Retrieved 27 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many of Maines' claims in ''The Technology of Orgasm'', however, have since been challenged. For example, by classicist [[Helen King (classicist)|Helen King]] and researchers at the [[Wellcome Collection]].&lt;ref&gt;King, Helen (2011).

[https://wellcomecollection.org/articles/hysteria "Hysteria"] Retrieved 08 August 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, King's article on Maines' misuse of classical material was awarded the Barbara McManus Prize of the Women's Classical Caucus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eugesta-revue.univ-lille3.fr/en/awards/|title=Awards, Revue EuGeStA|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A central claim in Maines's book, that Victorian physicians routinely used electromechanical vibrators to stimulate female patients to orgasm as a treatment for hysteria, was challenged by [[Hallie Lieberman]] and [[Eric Schatzberg]] of [[Georgia Institute of Technology]], who failed to find references to this practice in Maines's sources.&lt;ref&gt;Lieberman, H., &amp; Schatzberg, E.

'''Salvador Brau y Asencio'''&lt;ref group=note&gt;{{Spanish name|'''Brau'''|'''Asencio'''|plain=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; (January 11, 1842 – November 5, 1912) was a Puerto Rican [[journalist]], poet, dramatist, novelist, historian, and sociologist. He was designated the official [[historian]] of Puerto Rico by the first American-appointed governor of the island.

==Early years==
Brau was born in [[Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico]] into a well-to-do family. His father was Bartolomé Brau, a [[Catalan people|Catalan]] teacher, and his mother was Luisa Asencio, a native of [[Venezuela]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capr.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2919&amp;Itemid=103 Día de conmemoración a don Salvador Brau Asencio]&lt;/ref&gt; Brau received his primary and secondary education in private schools. Forced to work to care for his family after the death of his father about 1855, he began to teach himself. By the age of 16, he was composing various literary works and with his friends started a theatrical society. He wished to continue his education in an institute of higher learning&lt;ref name="END"&gt;[http://www.zonai.com/promociones/biografias/0101/brau.asp El Nuevo Dia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304195925/http://www.zonai.com/promociones/biografias/0101/brau.asp |date=2009-03-04 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus went to Spain in 1861 where he attended the [[University of Barcelona]], earning a [[degree in Letters]]. During his stay in the mother country, he came into contact with the autonomist movement of Puerto Rico and became involved. Eventually, Brau earned his Doctorate in Letters.

==Important discoveries==
[[Image:SalvadorBrauMonument.jpg|right|thumb|Monument to Dr. Brau in Cabo Rojo in front of [[San Miguel Arcángel Church (Cabo Rojo)|San Miguel Arcángel Church]], 2007]]
In 1870, Brau returned to Puerto Rico and became a journalist.  He joined the Autonomist Party of Puerto Rico and became politically active, believing that Puerto Rico should be granted more powers by the Spanish Crown. He expressed his beliefs in his novels and plays, including one of his most acclaimed plays, "La Vuelta al Hogar" (Once on This Island).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst;jsessionid=J6zNcLF0QQDh174WG1Kk8vnbY2DGpGyhr9x3XvCkMlw1w1yQ8gd6!-1477775285!2065313591?docId=5001960938 Once on This Island: The Performance of Spatiality in Salvador Brau's la Vuelta Al Hogar]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1894, Brau was named Commissioner for the Provincial Deputation.  He then moved back to Spain where he investigated the historical documents pertaining to Puerto Rico's past.  These documents were stored and continue to be stored in the Indias Archives of Seville. In 1897, after three years of investigating the historical documents, Brau returned to Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name="END"/&gt;

His findings in Seville included documents written by Fray Antonio de Montesinos, Fray Íñigo Abad y Lasierra and others. He uncovered important information about how the [[Taínos]] lived and how they were treated harshly by the Spanish settlers. During his investigation he found an interesting reference to the Puerto Rican [[Music of Puerto Rico|danza]]. According to a document written by Fray Íñigo Abad y Lasierra, Bishop of Puerto Rico (1772–1778), there was a typical, fast and noisy shoe-stomping dance in the island which he called "Puerto Rican danza". Brau, however, claims that the authentic Puerto Rican danza was a popular creation that emerged in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="goodreads"&gt;{{cite web|work=Goodreads|title=Salvador Brau|url=http://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=salvador+brau}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Official Historian of Puerto Rico==
In 1898, Puerto Rico became a colonial possession of the United States after the [[Spanish–American War]] in accordance with the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]]. Brau continued to be politically active and in 1903 was named Official Historian of Puerto Rico by the American-appointed governor [[William Henry Hunt (judge)|William Henry Hunt]]. He held this position until his death on November 5, 1912 in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref name="END"/&gt; He was interred  in [[Santa María Magdalena de Pazzis Cemetery]] in [[Old San Juan]].&lt;ref name="END"/&gt;

The town of San Juan honored him with a park and a statue. The town of Cabo Rojo has honored his memory with a monument and by naming a hall in its amphitheater after him. The town of [[Aguada, Puerto Rico|Aguada]] has a bust of Brau in its plaza. Brau was one of the few Puerto Ricans to be honored by the [[United States Maritime Commission]] when during [[World War II]] the [[Liberty ship]] {{SS|Salvador Brau}} was built in [[Panama City, Florida]], and named in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Samarkand''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|æ|m|ər|k|æ|n|d}}; [[Uzbek language]]: ''{{lang|uz|Samarqand}}''; {{lang-fa|سمرقند}}; {{lang-ru|Самарканд}}), alternatively '''Samarqand''', is a city in modern-day [[Uzbekistan]], and is one of the [[List of oldest continuously inhabited cities|oldest continuously inhabited cities]] in [[Central Asia]]. There is evidence of human activity in the area of the city from the late [[Paleolithic]] era, though there is no direct evidence of when exactly Samarkand was founded; some theories propose that it was founded between the 8th and 7th centuries BC. Prospering from its location on the [[Silk Road]] between [[China]] and the Mediterranean, at times Samarkand was one of the greatest cities of Central Asia.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Guidebook of history of Samarkand", {{ISBN|978-9943-01-139-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] of Persia, it was the capital of the [[Sogdia]]n [[satrap]]y. The city was taken by [[Alexander the Great]] in 329 BC, when it was known by its Greek name of Marakanda.&lt;ref name="History of Samarkand"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Samarkand|url=http://www.sezamtravel.com/en/Samarkand|publisher=Sezamtravel|accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city was ruled by a succession of Iranian and Turkic rulers until the Mongols under [[Genghis Khan]] conquered Samarkand in 1220. Today, Samarkand is the capital of [[Samarqand Region]] and [[Uzbekistan]]'s second largest city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citypopulation.de/Uzbekistan.html|title=Uzbekistan: Provinces, Major Cities &amp; Towns – Statistics &amp; Maps on City Population|date=|publisher=Citypopulation.de|accessdate=2014-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city is noted for being an Islamic centre for scholarly study. In the 14th century it became the capital of the empire of [[Timur]] (Tamerlane) and is the site of his mausoleum (the [[Gur-e Amir]]). The [[Bibi-Khanym Mosque]] (a modern replica) remains one of the city's most notable landmarks. The [[Registan]] was the ancient center of the city. The city has carefully preserved the traditions of ancient crafts: embroidery, gold embroidery, silk weaving, engraving on copper, ceramics, carving and painting on wood.&lt;ref&gt;Энциклопедия туризма Кирилла и Мефодия. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, [[UNESCO]] added the city to its [[World Heritage List]] as ''Samarkand – Crossroads of Cultures''.

Modern-day Samarkand is divided into two parts: the old and new city. The old city includes historical monuments, shops, and old private houses, while the new city includes administrative buildings along with cultural centers and educational institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.advantour.com/uzbekistan/samarkand/history.htm|title=History of Samarkand|website=www.advantour.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early history===

[[File:1872 Vereshchagin Triumphierend anagoria.JPG|thumb|''Triumph'' by [[Vasily Vereshchagin]], depicting the Sher-Dor [[Madrasa]] in [[Registan]].]]

Along with [[Bukhara]],&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Babak, Demian Vaisman, Aryeh Wasserman, ''Political organization in Central Asia and Azerbaijan: sources and documents'', p.374&lt;/ref&gt; Samarkand is one of the [[List of oldest continuously inhabited cities|oldest inhabited cities]] in [[Central Asia]], prospering from its location on the trade route between China and the Mediterranean ([[Silk Road]]).

Archeological excavations held within the city limits (Syob and midtown) as well as suburban areas (Hojamazgil, Sazag'on) unearthed forty-thousand-year-old evidence of human activity, dating back to the Late [[Paleolithic]] era. A group of [[Mesolithic]] era (12th–7th millennium BC) archeological sites were discovered at Sazag'on-1, Zamichatosh and Okhalik (suburbs of the city). The Syob and Darg'om canals, supplying the city and its suburbs with water, appeared around the 7th to 5th centuries BC (early [[Iron Age]]). There is no direct evidence when Samarkand was founded. Researchers of the Institute of Archeology of Samarkand argue for the existence of the city between the 8th and 7th centuries BC.

Samarkand has been one of the main centres of [[Sogdia]]n  civilization from its early days. By the time of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] dynasty of Persia it had become the capital of the Sogdian [[satrap]]y.

===Hellenistic period===
[[Alexander the Great]] conquered Samarkand in 329 BC. The city was known as '''Maracanda''' by the Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;''Columbia-Lippincott Gazetteer'' (New York: Columbia University Press, 1972 reprint) p. 1657&lt;/ref&gt; Written sources offer small clues as to the subsequent system of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Frances|title=The Silk Road: two thousand years in the heart of Asia|year=2002|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; They tell of an Orepius who became ruler "not from ancestors, but as a gift of Alexander".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shichkina|first=G.V.|title=Ancient Samarkand: capital of Soghd|journal=Bulletin of the Asia Institute|year=1994|volume=8|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Samarkand suffered significant damage during Alexander's initial conquest, the city recovered rapidly and flourished under the new Hellenic influence. There were also major new construction techniques; oblong bricks were replaced with square ones and superior methods of masonry and plastering were introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shichkina|first=G.V.|title=Ancient Samarkand: capital of Soghd|journal=Bulletin of the Asia Institute|year=1994|volume=8|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander's conquests introduced classical Greek culture into Central Asia; for a time, Greek aesthetics heavily influenced local artisans. This Hellenistic legacy continued as the city became part of various successor states in the centuries following Alexander's death, i.e. the [[Seleucid Empire]], [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]] and [[Kushan Empire]] (even though the [[Yuezhi|Kushana]] themselves originated in Central Asia). After  the Kushan state lost control of Sogdia, during the 3rd century AD, Samarkand went into decline as a centre of economic, cultural and political power. It did not significantly revive until the 5th century AD.

===Pre-Mongol period===
[[File:Samarqand.jpg|thumb|Downtown with Bibi-Khanym Mosque]]
Samarkand was conquered by the Persian [[Sassanians]] around 260 AD. Under Sassanian rule, the region became an essential site for [[Manichaeism]], and facilitated the dissemination of the religion throughout Central Asia.&lt;ref name="Dumper, Stanley 2007 319"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dumper, Stanley|title=Cities of the Middle East and North Africa: A Historical Encyclopedia|year=2007|location=California|page=319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Hephtalites]] (Huns) conquered Samarkand, they controlled it until the [[Göktürks]], in an alliance with the Sassanid Persians, won it at the [[Battle of Bukhara]]. The Turks ruled over Samarkand until they were defeated by the [[Sassanids]] during the [[Göktürk–Persian Wars]].
 
After the [[Islamic conquest of Iran|Arab conquest of Iran]], the Turks conquered Samarkand and held it until the Turkic khaganate collapsed due to wars with the Chinese [[Tang Dynasty]]. During this time the city became a protectorate and paid tribute to the ruling Tang. The armies of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] under [[Qutayba ibn Muslim]] captured the city in around 710 from Turks.&lt;ref name="Dumper, Stanley 2007 319"/&gt;

During this period, Samarkand was a diverse religious community and was home to a number of religions, including [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Buddhism]],[[Hinduism]], [[Manichaeism]], [[Judaism]] and [[Nestorian Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dumper, Stanley|title=Cities of the Middle East and North Africa: A Historical Encyclopedia|year=2007|location=California}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after the Arab conquest of Sogdiana, [[Islam]] became the dominant religion, with much of the population converting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Whitfield|first=Susan|title=Life Along the Silk Road|year=1999|publisher=University of California Press|location=California|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legend has it that during [[Abbasid]] rule,&lt;ref&gt;Quraishi, Silim "A survey of the development of papermaking in Islamic Countries", ''Bookbinder'', 1989 (3): 29–36.&lt;/ref&gt; the secret of [[papermaking]] was obtained from two [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] prisoners from the [[Battle of Talas]] in 751, which led to the foundation of the first [[paper mill]] of the Islamic world in Samarkand. The invention then spread to the rest of the Islamic world, and from there to Europe.

Abbasid control of Samarkand soon dissipated and was replaced with that of the [[Samanids]] (862–999), though it must be noted that the Samanids were still nominal vassals of the Caliph during their control of Samarkand. Under Samanid rule the city became one of the capitals of the Samanid dynasty and an even more important link amongst numerous trade routes. The Samanids were overthrown by the [[Karakhanids]] around 1000. During the next two hundred years, Samarkand would be ruled by a succession of Turkic tribes, including the [[Seljuqs]] and the [[Khwarazm]]-Shahs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dumper, Stanley|title=Cities of the Middle East and North Africa: A Historical Encyclopedia|year=2007|location=California|page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 10th-century Iranian author Istakhri, who travelled in [[Transoxiana]], provides a vivid description of the natural riches of the region he calls "Smarkandian Sogd":

&lt;blockquote&gt;I know no place in it or in Samarkand itself where if one ascends some elevated ground one does not see greenery and a pleasant place, and nowhere near it are mountains lacking in trees or a dusty steppe... Samakandian Sogd... [extends] eight days travel through unbroken greenery and gardens... . The greenery of the trees and sown land extends along both sides of the river [Sogd]... and beyond these fields is pasture for flocks. Every town and settlement has a fortress... It is the most fruitful of all the countries of Allah; in it are the best trees and fruits, in every home are gardens, cisterns and flowing water.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Mongol period===
The Mongols [[Mongol conquest of Khwarezmia#Samarkand|conquered Samarkand]] in 1220. Although [[Genghis Khan]] "did not disturb the inhabitants [of the city] in any way", according to [[Ata-Malik Juvayni|Juvaini]] he killed all who took refuge in the citadel and the mosque, pillaged the city completely and conscripted 30,000 young men along with 30,000 craftsmen. Samarkand suffered at least one other Mongol sack by [[Baraq (Chagatai Khan)|Khan Baraq]] to get treasure he needed to pay an army. It remained part of the [[Chagatai Khanate]] (one of four Mongol successor realms) until 1370.

''[[The Travels of Marco Polo|The Travels]]'' of [[Marco Polo]], where Polo records his journey along the Silk Road, describes Samarkand as "a very large and splendid city..."

The Yenisei area had [[Semu#Similar practices in other areas of the Mongol Empire|a community of weavers of Chinese origin]] and Samarkand and Outer Mongolia both had artisans of Chinese origin seen by [[Qiu Chuji|Changchun]].&lt;ref name="Gernet1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jacques Gernet|title=A History of Chinese Civilization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jqb7L-pKCV8C&amp;pg=PA377#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=31 May 1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-49781-7|pages=377–}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Mongol conquest of Central Asia by Genghis Khan, foreigners were chosen as administrators and co-management with Chinese and Qara-Khitays (Khitans) of gardens and fields in Samarqand was put upon the Muslims as a requirement since Muslims were not allowed to manage without them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = E.J.W.

The khanate allowed the establishment of Christian bishoprics (see below).

=== Timur(id) rule (14th-15th centuries) ===
[[Ibn Battuta]] visited in 1333, and called the city "one of the greatest and finest of cities, and most perfect of them in beauty."  He also noted the orchards were supplied water via ''[[noria]]s''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Battutah|first1=Ibn|title=The Travels of Ibn Battutah|date=2002|publisher=Picador|location=London|isbn=9780330418799|pages=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1365, a revolt against Chagatai Mongol control occurred in Samarkand.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 15th Ed, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1370 the conqueror [[Timur]] (Tamerlane), the founder and ruler of the [[Timurid Empire]], made Samarkand his capital. During the next 35 years, he rebuilt most of the city and populated it with the great artisans and craftsmen from across the empire. Timur gained a reputation as a patron of the arts and Samarkand grew to become the centre of the region of [[Transoxiana]]. Timur's commitment to the arts is evident in the way he was ruthless with his enemies but merciful towards those with special artistic abilities, sparing the lives of artists, craftsmen and architects so that he could bring them to improve and beautify his capital. He was also directly involved in his construction projects and his visions often exceeded the technical abilities of his workers. Furthermore, the city was in a state of constant construction and Timur would often request buildings to be done and redone quickly if he was unsatisfied with the results.&lt;ref name="Marefat 1992 33–38"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marefat|first=Roya|title=The Heavenly City of Samarkand|journal=The Wilson Quarterly|date=Summer 1992|volume=16|issue=3|pages=33–38|jstor=40258334}}&lt;/ref&gt; Timur made it so that the city could only be reached by roads and also ordered the construction of deep ditches and walls, that would run five miles ({{convert|5|mi|abbr=out|disp=output only}}) in circumference, separating the city from the rest of its surrounding neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Frances|title=The Silk Roads: two thousand ears in the heart of Asia|year=2002|location=Berkeley|pages=136–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time the city had a population of about 150,000.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;''Columbia-Lippincott Gazetteer'', p. 1657&lt;/ref&gt; This great period of reconstruction is encapsulated in the account of [[Henry III of Castile|Henry III]]'s ambassador, [[Ruy Gonzalez de Clavijo]], who was stationed there between 1403 and 1406. During his stay the city was typically in a constant state of construction. "The Mosque which Timur had caused to be built in memory of the mother of his wife...seemed to us the noblest of all those we visited in the city of Samarkand, but no sooner had it been completed than he begun to find fault with its entrance gateway, which he now said was much too low and must forthwith be pulled down."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Le Strange|first=Guy (trans)|title=Clavijo: Embassy to Tamburlaine 1403–1406|year=1928|location=London|page=280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1424 and 1429, the great astronomer [[Ulugh Beg]] built the [[Ulugh Beg Observatory|Samarkand Observatory]]. The [[sextant]] was 11 metres long and once rose to the top of the surrounding three-storey structure, although it was kept underground to protect it from earthquakes. Calibrated along its length, it was the world's largest 90-degree quadrant at the time.&lt;ref name="RW"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rayw20.co.uk/SAMARQAND.htm|title=Samarqand|publisher=Raw W Travels|accessdate=November 1, 2009}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the observatory was destroyed by religious fanatics in 1449.&lt;ref name="RW"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxuscom.com/timursam.htm#9&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1500 the Uzbek nomadic warriors took control of Samarkand.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The [[Shaybanids]] emerged as the Uzbek leaders at or about this time.

In the second quarter of the 16th century, the [[Shaybanids]] moved their capital to [[Bukhara]] and Samarkand went into decline. After an assault by the [[Afsharid dynasty|Afshar]] [[shahinshah]] [[Nader Shah]] the city was abandoned in the 18th century, about 1720 or a few years later.&lt;ref&gt;''Britannica''. 15th Ed, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1599 to 1756, Samarkand was ruled by the [[Astrakhan Khanate|Ashtrakhanid]] branch of the [[Khanate of Bukhara]].

From 1756 to 1868, Samarkand was ruled by the [[Manghud]] (Mongol) Emirs of [[Emirate of Bukhara|Bukhara]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Columbia-Lippincott Gazetteer''. p. 1657&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Russian Tzarist and Soviet rule ===
{{See also|Uzbeks#Russo-Soviet era}}

The city came under [[imperial Russia]]n rule after the citadel had been taken by a force under Colonel [[Konstantin Petrovich von Kaufman]] in 1868. Shortly thereafter the small Russian garrison of 500 men were themselves [[Siege of Samarkand (1868)|besieged]]. The assault, which was led by Abdul Malik Tura, the rebellious elder son of the [[Emirate of Bukhara|Bukharan Emir]], as well as Baba [[Bey|Beg]] of [[Shahrisabz]] and Jura Beg of [[Kitab]], was repelled with heavy losses. Alexander Abramov became the first Governor of the Military [[Okrug]], which the Russians established along the course of the [[Zeravshan River]], with Samarkand as the administrative centre. The Russian section of the city was built after this point, largely to the west of the old city.

In 1886, the city became the capital of the newly formed Samarkand [[Oblast]] of [[Russian Turkestan]] and grew in importance still further when the [[Trans-Caspian railway]] reached the city in 1888.
 
It became the capital of the [[Uzbek SSR]] in 1925, before being replaced by [[Tashkent]] in 1930. During [[World War II]], after [[Nazi Germany]] [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded]] the [[Soviet Union]], a number of citizens of Samarqand were sent to the land of [[Smolensk]], to [[Battle of Smolensk (1941)|fight the enemy]]. Many were [[German mistreatment of Soviet prisoners of war|taken captive or killed by the Nazis]].&lt;ref name=Soldat&gt;[http://www.soldat.ru/search/f_glory/soldiers.html "Soviet Field of Glory"] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC2017CentralAsians"&gt;{{cite news |author=Rustam Qobil |publisher=BBC |title=Why were 101 Uzbeks killed in the Netherlands in 1942? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-39849088 |date=2017-05-09 |accessdate=2017-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
Samarkand is located in north-eastern Uzbekistan, in the Zarefshan River valley. [[Qarshi]] is located 135&amp;nbsp;km away. Road M37 connects it to [[Bukhara]], 240&amp;nbsp;km away. Road M39 connects it to [[Tashkent]], 270&amp;nbsp;km away. The [[Tajikistan]] border is about 35&amp;nbsp;km from Samarkand, the road leading to [[Dushanbe]] which is 210&amp;nbsp;km away. Road M39 connects it to [[Mazar-i-Sharif]] in [[Afghanistan]], which is 340&amp;nbsp;km away.

=== Climate ===
Samarkand features a [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Csa'') that closely borders on a [[semi-arid climate]] (''BSk'') with hot, dry summers and relatively wet, variable winters that alternate periods of warm weather with periods of cold weather. July and August are the hottest months of the year with temperatures reaching, and exceeding, {{convert|40|C|abbr=on}}. Most of the sparse precipitation is received from December through April. January 2008 was particularly cold, and the temperature dropped to {{convert|-22|°C|0}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.samarkand.info/html/weather.html| title = Weather in Samarkand| accessdate  = 2009-06-11| author = Samarkand.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to various independent sources, [[Tajiks]] (Persian-speaking people) are the major ethnic group in the city, while ethnic [[Uzbek people|Uzbeks]] form a growing minority.&lt;ref name="PB"&gt;[[Paul Bergne]]: ''The Birth of Tajikistan. National Identity and the Origins of the Republic''. International Library of Central Asia Studies. [[I.B. Tauris]]. 2007. Pg. 106&lt;/ref&gt; Exact figures are difficult to evaluate, since many people in Uzbekistan either identify as "Uzbek" even though they speak [[Tajik language|Tajik]] as their first language, or because they are registered as Uzbeks by the central government despite their Tajik language and identity. As explained by [[Paul Bergne]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;During the census of 1926 a significant part of the Tajik population was registered as Uzbek. Thus, for example, in the 1920 census in Samarkand city the Tajiks were recorded as numbering 44,758 and the Uzbeks only 3301. According to the 1926 census, the number of Uzbeks was recorded as 43,364 and the Tajiks as only 10,716. In a series of kishlaks [villages] in the Khojand Okrug, whose population was registered as Tajik in 1920 e.g. in Asht, Kalacha, Akjar i Tajik and others, in the 1926 census they were registered as Uzbeks. Similar facts can be adduced also with regard to Ferghana, Samarkand, and especially the Bukhara oblasts.&lt;ref name="PB" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Religion ==
Historically, Samarkand was a diverse religious community. Before the 8th century Hinduism was mainly influenced in this area for centuries. Since the 8th century, when the [[Arab]]s entered Central Asia, [[Islam]] has become the main religion. According to some sources, approximately 90% of people are muslims and [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]] are minor religions.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Since the advent of Islam, many [[mosque]]s, [[madrasa]]s and [[mausoleum]] have been built and all of these make the city very attractive for tourists to visit. Many of these monuments were built during 14th–15th centuries by [[Timur|Tamerlane]] including the Registan Mosque and madrasas, the Bibi-Khanum Mosque, the Shakhi-Zinda compound and the Gur-Emir ensemble, as well as Ulugh-Beg's Observatory.

Even though 90% of the population of Uzbekistan are Sunni Muslim, Islam is not followed strictly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peyrouse|first=Sebastien|date=2016-02-10|title=Does Islam Challenge the Legitimacy of Uzbekistan's Government?|url=http://www.ponarseurasia.org/memo/does-islam-challenge-legitimacy-uzbekistans-government|journal=PonarsEuarasia – Policy Memos}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visitors state that in style of dress and attitude to religion people of Samarkand are becoming more westernized rather than keeping their ancestors' tradition and culture. In spite of following Islam, many Sunni Muslims in Samarkand drink alcohol especially during weddings, holidays and birthdays. In addition, there are 14 small [[Wine]] manufacturers in [[Uzbekistan]], with one of the oldest and famous being in Samarkand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldtravelguide.net/uzbekistan/food-and-drink|title=Food and Drink in Uzbekistan|website=www.worldtravelguide.net|access-date=2016-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; People have a habit of drinking vodka to celebrate good days with their relatives, friends, and neighbors.

===The Shia "Iranis"===
There are many [[Shia Islam|Shia]] towns in the Samarkand general area, where Shia Muslims are composed almost entirely of the deported Mervis; the old, approximately 100,000 strong population of [[Merv]] city and oasis (now in [[Turkmenistan]]) who were deported en masse by the [[Manghit]] king [[Shah Murad Beg]] in the course of the 1780s to the [[Zarafshan]] basin. They are known locally and identified by the Soviet censuses as the "Irani". They have their own mosques and mausoleums.

=== Christianity ===
Christians include: [[Russians]], [[Koreans]], [[Ukrainians]] and [[Armenians]]. Only a few churches hold services.

Samarkand, the ancient capital of [[Sogdiana]], was an early Metropolitan Archbishopric of [[Nestorianism]]. As a crossroads for caravans between China, Persia and the Crimea, it was religiously tolerant. Even the Mongol [[Chagatai Khanate]] was. Marco Polo claims that Samarkand's founder (one of four successors to Genghis Khan) converted to Christianity; in any event his descendant and successor Algigidai (Eljigidey), ruling from 1327, allowed the Dominican Order to preach Catholicism and build a church in Samarkand dedicated to [[John the Baptist]] and wrote twice to [[Pope John XXII]], who sent him two Dominican 'ambassadors'. In addition to Nestorians, there were Greek Melkite and Orthodox Christians, but now also a Latin Catholic community, which on 13 August 1329 became the Diocese of Samarcanda / Semiscanten(sis) (Latin), as a [[suffragan]] of the Metropolitan [[Archdiocese of Soltaniyeh]] which had been established in 1318 by [[papal bull]] ''Redemptor noster'' from the same pope. The Archdiocese was also entrusted to the Dominicans and was meant to become an [[ecclesiastical province]] covering the Mongol khanates. By 1400 it had been suppressed, after the demise of the tolerant khanate, having had two recorded incumbents:
* Tommaso di Mancasola, [[Dominican Order]] (O.P.) (August 21, 1329 – ?), the senior of the initial papal envoys
* Giovanni = John  (1359? – ?).

=== Architecture ===

Timur initiated the building of Bibi Khanum after his campaign in India in 1398–1399. Before its reconstruction after an earthquake in 1897, Bibi Khanum had around 450 marble columns that were established with the help of 95 elephants that Timur had brought back from Hindustan. Also from India, artisans and stonemasons designed the mosque's dome, giving it its distinctiveness amongst the other buildings.&lt;ref name="Marefat 1992 33–38"/&gt;

The best-known structure in Samarkand is the mausoleum known as Gur-i Amir. It exhibits many cultures and influences from past civilizations, neighboring peoples, and especially those of Islam. Despite how much devastation the Mongols caused in the past to all of the Islamic architecture that had existed in the city prior to Timur's succession, much of the destroyed Islamic influences were revived, recreated, and restored under Timur. The blueprint and layout of the mosque itself follows the Islamic passion of geometry and other elements of the structure had been precisely measured. The entrance to the Gur-i Amir is decorated with Arabic calligraphy and inscriptions, the latter being a common feature in Islamic architecture. The attention to detail and meticulous nature of Timur is especially obvious when looking inside the building. Inside, the walls have been covered in tiles through a technique, originally developed in Iran, called "mosaic faience," a process where each tile is cut, colored, and fit into place individually.&lt;ref name="Marefat 1992 33–38"/&gt;  The tiles were also arranged in a specific way that would engrave words relating to the city's religiosity; words like "Muhammad" and "Allah" have been spelled out on the walls using the tiles.&lt;ref name="Marefat 1992 33–38"/&gt;

The ornaments and decorations of the walls include floral and vegetal symbols which are used to signify gardens. Gardens are commonly interpreted as paradise in the Islamic religion and they were both inscribed in tomb walls and grown in the city itself.&lt;ref name="Marefat 1992 33–38"/&gt; In the city of Samarkand, there were two major gardens, the New Garden and the Garden of Heart's Delight, and these became the central areas of entertainment for ambassadors and important guests. A friend of Genghis Khan in 1218 named Yelü Chucai, reported that Samarkand was the most beautiful city of all where "it was surrounded by numerous gardens. Every household had a garden, and all the gardens were well designed, with canals and water fountains that supplied water to round or square-shaped ponds. The landscape included rows of willows and cypress trees, and peach and plum orchards were shoulder to shoulder."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Liu|first=Xinru|title=The Silk Road in world history|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-516174-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The floors of the mausoleum are entirely covered with uninterrupted patterns of tiles of flowers, emphasizing the presence of Islam and Islamic art in the city. In addition, Persian carpets with floral printings have been found in some of the Timurid buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cohn-Wiener|first=Ernst|title=An Unknown Timurid Building|journal=The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs|date=June 1935|volume=66|issue=387|pages=272–273+277|jstor=866154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turko-Mongol influence is also apparent in the architecture of the buildings in Samarkand. For instance, nomads previously used ''[[yurt]]s'', traditional Mongol tents, to display the bodies of the dead before they were to engage in proper burial procedures. Similarly, it is believed that the melon-shaped domes of the tomb chambers are imitations of those yurts. Timur naturally used stronger materials, like bricks and wood, to establish these tents, but their purposes remain largely unchanged.&lt;ref name="Marefat 1992 33–38"/&gt;

The elements of traditional Islamic architecture can be seen in traditional Uzbek houses that are built around central courtyards with gardens.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/603/|title=Samarkand  – Crossroad of Cultures|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The houses are built from mud brick and most have painted wooden ceilings and wall decorations. Houses in the west of the city are indicative of European style homes built in 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The color of the buildings in Samarkand also has significant meaning behind it. For instance, blue is the most common and dominant color that will be found on the buildings, which was used by Timur in order to symbolize a large range of ideas. For one, the blue shades seen in the Gur-i Amir are colors of mourning. Blue was the color of mourning in Central Asia at the time, as it is in many cultures even today, so its dominance in the city's mausoleum appears only logical. In addition, blue was also seen as the color that would ward off "the [[evil eye]]" in Central Asia and the notion is evident in the number of doors in and around the city that were colored blue during this time. Furthermore, blue was representative of water, which was a particularly rare resource around the Middle East and Central Asia; coloring the walls blue symbolized the wealth of the city.

Gold also has a strong presence in the city. Timur's fascination with vaulting explains the excessive use of gold in the Gur-i Amir as well as the use of embroidered gold fabric in both the city and his buildings. The Mongols had great interests in Chinese- and Persian-style golden silk textiles as well as [[nasij]] woven in Iran and Transoxiana. Past Mongol leaders, like Ogodei, built textile workshops in their cities in order to be able to produce gold fabrics themselves.

There is evidence that Timur tried to preserve his Mongol roots. In the chamber in which his body was laid, "[[tuq]]s" were found – those are poles with horses' tails hanging at the top, which was symbolic of an ancient Turkic tradition where horses, which were valuable commodities, were sacrificed in order to honor the dead,&lt;ref name="Marefat 1992 33–38"/&gt; and a cavalry standard type shared by many nomads, up to the Ottoman Turks.

== Transportation system ==
Historically, Samarkand has been one of the major trading points of Central Asia. In May 1888, a railroad bridge connecting the [[Amu Darya River]] and Samarkand placed Samarkand as one of the stops on the [[Trans-Caspian Railway]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.advantour.com/uzbekistan/samarkand/railway-station.htm|title=Samarkand Railway Station|website=www.advantour.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its opening, Samarkand Railway Station has undergone several reconstructions, and it is presently set up for domestic and international traveling. The recent addition of the [[Tashkent–Samarkand high-speed rail line|high-speed Afrosiab train]] traveling from the old capital of Samarkand to the new capital of Tashkent promoted a tighter relationship between the two cities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The city's first tram line was launched in April 2017. The construction of the second tram line was completed in 2018. The newly constructed line is 5.1&amp;nbsp;km-long, and it is expected to run eight trams at seven-minute headways between the railway station and the Siyob Bazaar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.globalrailnews.com/2018/02/15/second-tram-line-opens-in-samarkand-uzbekistan/|title=Second tram line opens in Samarkand, Uzbekistan {{!}} Global Rail News|date=2018-02-15|work=Global Rail News|access-date=2018-05-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Simon Hornblower''', [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] (born 1949) is an English [[classicist]] and academic. He is Professor of Classics and Ancient History in the [[University of Oxford]] and Senior Research Fellow of [[All Souls College, Oxford]].

==Biography==
Born in 1949, he was educated at [[Eton College]], where he was a [[King's Scholar]], at [[Jesus College, Cambridge]], where he took a first-class in Part I of the Classical Tripos in 1969, and at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he took first-class honours in ''[[Literae Humaniores]]'' in 1971 ([[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] and hence subsequently [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge)|MA]]) and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|DPhil]] in 1978 with a thesis entitled ''[[Mausolus|Maussollos of Karia]]''.

In 1971, he was elected to a Prize Fellowship of [[All Souls College, Oxford|All Souls College]], which he held until 1977. Then from 1978 until 1997, he was University Lecturer in Ancient History in the [[University of Oxford]] and Fellow and Tutor in [[Literae Humaniores|Classics]] at [[Oriel College, Oxford]], including one year, 1994/95, in which he was a member of the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]]. He moved to University College London, where in 1998 he was appointed Professor of Classics and Ancient History. In 2006 he was promoted with the title [[George Grote|Grote]] Professor of Ancient History, retaining the title Professor of Classics.

He was elected a Fellow of the [[British Academy]] in 2004.

Hornblower was elected Senior Research Fellow of [[All Souls College, Oxford]], taking up his appointment in Michaelmas Term 2010. At the same time, the [[Title of Distinction|Recognition of Distinction Committee]] conferred upon him the title Professor of Classics and Ancient History.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ox.ac.uk/gazette/2010-2011/28october2010/notices/#24363 ''Oxford University Gazette'' Thursday 28 October 2010, No. 4932, Vol 141. Accessed 26 November 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarship==
His current interest is classical Greek historiography (especially [[Herodotus]] and [[Thucydides]]) and the relation between historical texts as literature and as history. He has published an historical and literary commentary on [[Thucydides]] in three volumes ([[Oxford University Press]], 1991, 1996, 2008). His latest sole-authored book is ''Thucydides and [[Pindar]]: Historical Narrative and the World of [[Epinikion|Epinikian Poetry]]'' (Oxford University Press, 2004). He is also co-editor, with Professor [[Catherine Morgan]] of [[King's College London]], of ''[[Pindar]]'s Poetry, Patrons, and Festivals: From Archaic Greece to the Roman Empire'' (OUP, 2007), a collection of papers by experts on historical, literary, archaeological and anthropological aspects of Pindar and his world.

Since 1979, he has been involved with the ''Lexicon of Greek Personal Names'' and co-edited ''Greek Personal Names: Their Value as Evidence'' (Oxford University Press, 2000), a role in which he co-operated closely with [[Elaine Matthews]].

In 1996, he co-edited the third edition of the ''[[Oxford Classical Dictionary]]''. In 2012, he edited the fourth and most recent edition.

'''Sureq Galigo''' or '''La Galigo''' is an epic [[creation myth]] of the [[Bugis]] from [[South Sulawesi]], written down in manuscript form between the 18th and 20th century in the [[Languages of Indonesia|Indonesian]] language [[Bugis language|Bugis]], based on an earlier oral tradition. It has become known to a wider audience mostly through the theatrical adaptation ''[[I La Galigo]]'' by [[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]].&lt;ref name="Arnold 2004"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9407E6DC1638F934A35757C0A9629C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all|title=Robert Wilson Illuminates Indonesian Creation Myth|accessdate=2008-09-04|work = The New York Times|date=2004-04-07|author=Wayne Arnold}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The poem is composed in [[pentameter]]s and relates the story of humanity's origins but serves also as practical everyday [[almanac]].&lt;ref name="Arnold 2004" /&gt; It evolved mostly through [[oral tradition]] and is still sung on important occasions. The earliest preserved written versions date back to the 18th century, earlier ones have been lost due to insects, climate or destruction.&lt;ref name="Arnold 2004" /&gt; Consequently, there is no complete or definite version of ''Galigo'' but the preserved parts amount to 6,000 pages or 300,000 lines of text, making it one of the largest works of [[literature]].&lt;ref name="Rothstein 2005"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://theater2.nytimes.com/2005/07/15/theater/reviews/15gali.html|title=A Sacred Epic and Its Gods, All Struggling to Survive|accessdate=2008-08-19|work = The New York Times|date=2005-07-15|author=Edward Rothstein}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original Buginese, in which also the production is sung, is now only understood by fewer than 100 people&lt;ref name="Rothstein 2005" /&gt; but so far only parts of it have been translated into Indonesian and no complete [[English language]] version exists either.&lt;ref name="Arnold 2004" /&gt; The majority of La Galigo manuscripts still extant can be found in Indonesia and the Netherlands. [[Leiden University Library]] keeps one of the most valuable [https://digitalcollections.universiteitleiden.nl/lagaligo manuscripts]. The Leiden manuscript consists of twelve volumes and relates the first part of the long Buginese epic. This largest coherent La Galigo fragment in the world was written in Makassar at the request of the theologian and scholar B.F. Matthes (1818–1908). In 1847 Matthes entered the service of the Netherlands Bible Society to study Buginese and Makassarese with the purpose of translation the Bible in those languages.

The text was written by Colliq Pujié (Arung Pancana Toa), Queen-mother of Tanete, a small kingdom in South Sulawesi. The manuscript is now part of the collection Indonesian manuscripts of the [https://disc.leidenuniv.nl/webclient/DeliveryManager?custom_att_2=simple_viewer&amp;pid=2110337 Netherlands Bible Society], given on permanent loan to the [[Leiden University Library]] since the years 1905-1915. In 2012, together with another La Galigo manuscript, held in Makassar, the Leiden manuscript is now included in UNESCO's Memory of the World (MOW) Register as the second document from Indonesia after [[Nagarakretagama|Negarakertagama]] in 2008 to earn the acknowledgement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/04/28/unesco-acknowledges-s-sulawesi-s-la-galigo.html |title=UNESCO acknowledges S.

'''''The Giant of Marathon''''' ({{lang-it|La battaglia di Maratona}}) is a 1959 [[international co-production]] [[sword and sandal]] film, loosely based on the [[Battle of Marathon]].  It was directed by [[Jacques Tourneur]] and [[Mario Bava]]. It starred [[Steve Reeves]] as [[Pheidippides|Phillipides]]. The film was a co-production between Italy's [[Titanus]] and [[Galatea Film]] and France's Lux Compagnie Cinematographique de France and Societe Cinematographique Lyre.{{sfn|Kinnard|Crnkovich|2017|p=60}}

==Plot==

The story is set in 490 BC, the time of the [[Greco-Persian Wars|Medic Wars]], during which Persian armies sweep through the Ancient world. Having brought home to Athens the Olympic victor's laurel crown, Phillippides becomes commander of the Sacred Guard, which is expected to defend the city-state's liberty, a year after the expulsion of the tyrant [[Hippias (tyrant)|Hippias]].

Athenian supporters of Hippias conspire, hoping to sideline Phillippides with a marriage to Theocrites' expensive servant Charis, and thus neutralize the guard. She fails to seduce him, as his heart is already taken by a young girl before he learns her name is Andromeda, daughter of Creuso.

Everything personal is likely to be put on hold when the news breaks that the vast army of [[Darius I|Darius]], the Persian King of Kings, is marching on Greece, hoping that its internal division will make its conquest a walk-over. Theocrites instructs [[Miltiades]] to hold back the Sacred Guard to defend the temple of Pallas after a likely defeat, and proposes instead to negotiate terms with Darius, but is told an alliance with [[Sparta]] could save the Hellenic nation.

Phillippides makes the journey and survives an attempt on his life by conspirators; he returns with Sparta's engagement during the Persian attack in far greater numbers on Militiades valiant troops. Charis, left for dead after overhearing Darius's orders, reaches the camp to tell that the Persian fleet, now commanded by the traitor Theocrites, is heading for the Piraeus to take Athens. Miltiades sends Phillippides ahead to hold out with the Sacred Guard until his hopefully victorious troops arrive, and after his perilous journey back they successfully beat back the Persians.

'''The Great Binge''' is a 21st Century neologism, coined by amateur historian Gradus Protus van den Belt, describing the period in history covering roughly 1870 to 1914.&lt;ref name=Maps&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bryars|first1=Tim|last2=Harper|first2=Tom|title=A History of the Twentieth Century in 100 Maps|date=December 10, 2014|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=9780226202501|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b5jeBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT52&amp;dq=The+Great+Binge+1870-1914&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XwZyVdbpDMexyATnrYGwBg&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=June 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is so known because of the widespread use and availability of narcotics such as [[opium]], heroin, [[cocaine]], [[morphine]], and [[absinthe]].&lt;ref name=Maps /&gt; During this period these drugs were widely available and incredibly popular among both men and women of many social classes in many parts of the world.&lt;ref name=Maps /&gt; They were marketed to both adults and children, often included in [[patent medicines]] such as cough syrups, pain relievers, and asthma medicines.&lt;ref name=io9&gt;{{cite web|last1=Inglis-Arkell|first1=Esther|title=When Opium Was For Newborns And Bayer Sold Heroin|url=http://io9.com/5896669/when-opium-was-for-newborns-and-bayer-sold-heroin|website=io9|accessdate=June 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were administered to infants and women with [[menstrual cramps]], and included in food and beverages such as [[Coca-Cola]].&lt;ref name=io9 /&gt; Literary characters such as [[Sherlock Holmes]] were portrayed using morphine and cocaine.&lt;ref name=Maps /&gt; Holmes is described as having a particular penchant for overt injections of a 7% solution of cocaine - though only when lacking adequate mental stimulation. 

The period ended with a series of laws regulating narcotic drugs in various countries and internationally.  The [[International Opium Convention]], signed in the [[Hague]] in 1912 by 11 countries and entering into force in 1915, was the first stab at a comprehensive drug control treaty internationally and inspired domestic drug control laws such as the [[Harrison Narcotics Tax Act]] in the United States.&lt;ref name=UNDOC&gt;{{cite web|title=The 1912 Hague International Opium Convention|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/frontpage/the-1912-hague-international-opium-convention.html|website=U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime|accessdate=June 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

‘Binge’ is 19th century slang, although the meaning has evolved. However, the specific application of the term ‘great binge’ relative to drug use and popular attitudes towards drug use circa 1870–1914 is relatively recent. As well as its use by Bryars and Harper cited above, it was used by British author and comedian [[Stephen Fry]] to describe this period in 'More Fool Me'&lt;ref&gt;Fry, Stephen (25 Sept. 2014). More Fool Me. London: Michael Joseph {{ISBN|978-0718179786}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by academic [[Nicholas J. Saunders]] in 'The Poppy: A History of Conflict, Loss, Remembrance, and Redemption',&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, Nicholas J. (3 April 2014). The Poppy: A History of Conflict, Loss, Remembrance, and Redemption. Oneworld Publications {{ISBN|978-1780744049}}&lt;/ref&gt; speaking primarily of the USA, to describe a 19th century “characterised by various narcotics that were legal, widely available, widely consumed and deeply embedded in popular culture”. Popular use goes back a little further. [[Esquire Magazine]] used it in this context in 2009:&lt;ref&gt;Esquire. The magazine for men. Vol. 152, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dracula]] “appeared right in the middle of what historians call the Great Binge, a period in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries when cocaine and heroin use ran rampant”. A Canadian psychologist, Romeo Vitelli, used the term online in a post dated September 2, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;http://drvitelli.typepad.com/providentia/2007/09/ending-the-bing.html Retrieved October 18, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Vilna Group''' was a circle of Jewish Social-Democrats which met secretly in the city of Vilna, then part of the Russian empire (now [[Vilnius]] in Lithuania). The group was founded in the mid-1890s. Its members devoted themselves to disseminating [[Marxist]] and socialist literature to Jewish textile workers and to some extent to Jewish and non-Jewish workers generally, providing literacy and education classes for workers and supporting the formation of trade unions. They were among the first to produce socialist literature in [[Yiddish]]. All this was illegal and had to be done clandestinely, and all members of the Vilna Group were arrested at various points. The Vilna group included, among others, [[Arkadi Kremer]] and his wife [[Pati Kremer]] (a.k.a. Matla Srednicki or Srednitskaya), [[John Mill (Bundist)|John Mill]] and [[Mikhail Liber]]. It was one of the precursors of the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|General Jewish Workers' Association in Lithuania, Poland and Russia]] (known as the 'Bund'), founded in 1897. The Vilna Group also played a role in founding the [[Russian Social-Democratic Workers' Party]] (RSDRP) in 1898. Most veterans of the Vilna Group later supported the [[Mensheviks]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3457">'''William Vincent Barré''' (1760?–1829), was a European, a translator and author mainly notable for his writings on [[Napoleon]].

==Biography==
Barré was born in Germany about the year 1760 of French Protestant parents, who had left their native country on account of their religious opinions. He served first in the Russian navy, returned to France when the first revolution broke out, went as a volunteer in the army during the Italian campaign of 1796, and was raised to the rank of captain for the bravery he displayed on the field of battle.

Through his intimate acquaintance with the principal languages of Europe, he became a favourite of [[Napoleon|General Bonaparte]], who appointed him his personal interpreter. But he wrote some satirical verses about his employer, which seem now to be lost, and was obliged to flee from France. Pursued by [[Joseph Fouché|Fouché's]] police-agents, he escaped in a small boat from Paris down the [[Seine]] as far as [[Le Havre]], and went thence in an American vessel to England, where he appears to have arrived in 1803. The following year he published in London a ''History of the French Consulate under Napoleon Buonaparte, being an Authentic Narrative of his Administration, which is so little known in Foreign Countries, including a Sketch of his Life, the whole interspersed with curious anecdotes, &amp;c.'', in which he furiously attacks the first consul. Before this work appeared he had already translated into French [[Robert Thomas Wilson|Sir Robert Wilson's]] ''History of the British Expedition to Egypt'', and into English a pamphlet, ''Answer from [[Méhée de La Touche|M. Mehée]] to [[Dominique Joseph Garat|M. Garat]]''.

In 1805 appeared, in English, Barré's ''Rise, Progress, Decline, and Fall of Buonaparte's Empire in France'', the second part of the former ''History'', which is preceded by an 'advertisement' of ten pages, in which he attacks the reviewers of his first book in the ''Annual Review and History of Literature for 1803''. This second work is, according to Barré's entry in the [[Dictionary of National Biography]], as scurrilous as the first.

Barré left England for Ireland, where he appears to have had relatives bearing the same name, among them being the well-known orator, [[Isaac Barré]]. About the year 1806 he printed at Belfast, on a single sheet, some verses in French, called ''Monologue de l'Empereur Jaune, le nommé Napoléon Buonaparte, Chrétien, Athée, Catholique et Musulman, sur la destruction de son digne émule et rival l'Empereur Noir, le nommé Jacques Dessalines, par la légion d'honneur de l'armée noire de St. Domingue, le 10 Octobre, traduit du Corse'', with the motto, 'à ton tour, paillasse'. He seems to have published nothing more, and is said to have committed suicide in Dublin in 1829.

From 1997 to 2003 he served as the director of the Saint Petersburg Branch of the [[Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences]] (now the [[Institute of Oriental Manuscripts of the Russian Academy of Sciences]]).

==Biography==
Evgenij Kychanov was born 22 June 1932 in [[Sarapul]], [[Udmurtia]].&lt;ref name="iom-2013-05-26"/&gt;

Evgenij Kychanov graduated from the Oriental Department of [[Saint Petersburg University]] (known at the time as Leningrad University) in 1955, majoring in the history of China. He did his graduate work at the Leningrad Branch of the Institute of Oriental Studies, and in 1960 he defended his PhD thesis on the [[Xi Xia]] State. He has been working at that institute ever since, spending many years as the head of the Tangut research group, and, later, as the head of larger units. From 1997 to 2003 he was director of the St Petersburg Branch (now the [[Institute of Oriental Manuscripts of the Russian Academy of Sciences|Institute of Oriental Manuscripts]]).&lt;ref name="iom-history"&gt;{{Cite web | last=Popova | first=Irina F. | title=History of the Institute of Oriental Manuscripts | url=http://www.orientalstudies.ru/eng/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=46&amp;Itemid=82 | publisher=Institute of Oriental Manuscripts | date=10 June 2005 | accessdate=2012-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kychanov is the author of around 300 articles and books on the history and culture of peoples of China and Inner Asia, including a number of pioneering research papers on the Xi Xia state and translations from the Tangut language, summarizing works on the history of Tibet and nomadic civilizations of Inner Asia, as well as popular books about Tibet, Genghis Khan and other steppe leaders.

In May 2011 Kychanov was awarded the [[Sergey Oldenburg|S. F. Oldenburg]] Award in recognition of his achievements in the field of Central Asian studies, in particular his role in the decipherment of the [[Tangut script]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title=IDP Worldwide News | journal=IDP News | issue=36–37 | year=2010–2011 | publisher=[[International Dunhuang Project]] | issn=1354-5914 | page=15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012 a conference in his honour, entitled ''The Tanguts in Central Asia'', was held at the Institute of Oriental Manuscripts to mark Kychanov's 80th birthday.  A collection of 34 papers written by scholars from Russia, China, Japan and other countries was published as a [[Festschrift]] with the same title.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=Jubilee of Prof Kychanov and the Conference in His Honor  | url=http://orientalstudies.ru/eng/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2823&amp;Itemid=48 | date=23 June 2012 | accessdate=2012-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | script-title=ru:Тангуты в Центральной Азии: сборник статей в честь 80-летия проф.

'''Zhou Man''' ({{zh|c=周滿|p=Zhōu Mǎn}}), was a 15th-century [[China|Chinese]] admiral and explorer. He was born into a wealthy merchant family in the year 1378. When he was six years old, his father died on an overseas voyage to [[Korea]]. Mourning his father's death, he left his mother and his four younger siblings behind. He worked his way into the emperor's staff by the age of 22. At 32, he was assigned "Grand Leader of All Vessels Commanded by the Emperor's Swift Hand."

Zhou, with the help of three other commanders, explored wide reaches of the [[Indian Ocean]]. A stone inscription, dated 1431, at the Palace of the [[Tianfei|Celestial Spouse]] in [[Liujiagang]], [[Jiangsu]] is translated as:

:We, [[Zheng He]] and his companions [including Admirals [[Hong Bao]], Zhou Man, [[Zhou Wen]], and [[Yang Qing]]], at the beginning of [[Zhu Di]]'s reign received the Imperial Commission as envoys to the barbarians. Up until now seven voyages have taken place and, each time, we have commanded several tens of thousands of government soldiers and more than a hundred oceangoing vessels. We have...reached countries of the Eastern Regions, more than thirty countries in all. We have...beheld in the ocean huge waves like mountains rising sky-high, and we have set eyes on barbarian regions far away, hidden in a blue transparency of light vapors, whilst our sails, loftily unfurled like clouds, day and night continued their course, rapid like that of a star, traversing those savage waves.

==In fiction==
Thomas Seinbeck's "In the Shade of the Cypress" (published 2010) is a historical novel whose main character is Zhou Man.

In his book ''1421: The Year China Discovered the World'', amateur historian [[Gavin Menzies]] argues that Zhou Man built a fortess at [[Bittangabee Bay]] Australia and that his fleet approached and mapped the Pacific coast of [[North America]] and may have been wiped out by a [[megatsunami]] resulting from a [[comet]] impact creating [[Mahuika crater]]. The Australian geographer [[John Robert Victor Prescott|Professor Victor Prescott]] states that the structure at Bittangabee is considered by local archaeologists to be early 19th century and that Menzies misinterpreted the [[Waldseemüller map]] which he used as evidence for a visit by Zhou Man to the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Prescott|first=Victor|title=1421 AND ALL THAT JUNK|url=http://1421exposed.com/html/1421_and_all_that_junk.html|accessdate=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
