      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8699">'''Academic Health Science Networks''' (AHSNs) are membership organisations within the [[National Health Service|NHS in England]]. They were created in May 2013 with the aim of bringing together health services, and academic and industry members. Their stated purpose is to improve patient outcomes and generate economic benefits for the UK by promoting and encouraging the adoption of innovation in healthcare.  It is too early to judge the extent to which they are effective in performing their role.

== Background and history ==

A report in 2008 by Lord [[Ara Darzi]]&lt;ref name ="NextStage"&gt;[http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm74/7432/7432.pdf High Quality Care for All: NHS Next Stage Review, Department of Health, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; noted that the NHS was poor at innovating, and suggested wider collaboration between industry, education and all aspects of healthcare.  The NHS is one of the world's largest employers&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17429786 | title= Which is the world's largest employer? | date = 20 March 2012 | publisher=BBC | accessdate = 21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with the UK's spending on healthcare at over £140b in 2010 or 9.6% of national GDP,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/psa/expenditure-on-healthcare-in-the-uk/2011/art-expenditure-on-healthcare-in-the-uk-2011.html#tab-Key-points | title = Expenditure on Healthcare in the UK: 2011 | publisher = Office for National Statistics | accessdate = 21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is a key component of the national economy.  There is a generally recognised need to improve the NHS's ability to identify and adopt innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Academic Health Sciences Networks in England, David Fish, The Lancet, Volume 381, Issue 9882, Pages e18 - e19, 8 June 2013, doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60866-6&lt;/ref&gt;

AHSNs were first proposed by name in the report Innovation Health and Wealth &lt;ref name="Innovation"&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130107105354/http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/documents/digitalasset/dh_134597.pdf Innovation Health and Wealth: Accelerating Adoption and Diffusion in the NHS, Department of Health, 5 December 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Sir David Nicholson]], Chief Executive of [[NHS England]], and launched by the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[David Cameron]]. A request for expressions of interest was issued in June 2012&lt;ref name ="Expressions"&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/126785/Academic-Health-Science-Networks-21062012-gw-17626-PDF-229K.pdf.pdf Academic Health Science Networks: expressions of interest, Department of Health, 20 June 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; and, on 23 May 2013, the 15 designated AHSNs were formally announced.&lt;ref name="HSJdesig"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/technology/nhs-england-gives-green-light-on-70m-innovation-networks-project/5059011.article| title= NHS England Gives Green Light on £70m Innovation Networks Project | publisher = Health Service Journal | accessdate = 21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Designation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.england.nhs.uk/2013/05/23/acc-health-sci-ntwrk/ | title = AHSN Designation Announcement| publisher = NHS England | accessdate = 11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are regional, with non-overlapping territories covering the whole of England.  &lt;!--The 15 AHSNs are:

--&gt;

AHSNs take their place in the "fragmented cluttered and confusing"&lt;ref name="Innovation" /&gt; landscape of NHS innovation. As part of the "Sunset Review&lt;ref name="Innovation" /&gt;" a number of initiatives closed in 2013 including the NHS National Innovation Centre, NHS Institute for Innovation and Improvement, and Health Innovation and Education Clusters (HIECs).  There is still a range of currently active initiatives including NHS Innovation Hubs, NHS Supply Chain Innovation and NHS Improvement.

== Funding ==

Core funding will come from NHS England and work was "in hand to identify the funding" when expressions of interest were invited.&lt;ref name="Expressions" /&gt; A briefing paper&lt;ref name="Briefing"&gt;[http://www.nhsconfed.org/Publications/Documents/hsrn_briefing_246.pdf Academic Health Science Networks: Engaging with Improvement, NHS Confederation, June 2012]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; assumed funding to be in the region of £2 per head of population served.  With a population averaging 3m people, a typical AHSN might have expected roughly £6m per AHSN per year.  These figures reflect early expectations but were neither clarified nor confirmed with the designation announcement.

When contracts were signed with NHS England in November 2013, the 15 AHSNs shared around £60 million of funding.

== Operation and activity ==

Although their purpose is clear, the structure and approach of individual AHSNs is a matter for local decision.  This is apparent in the contrasting approaches taken and the variety of opinions expressed by network founders.&lt;ref name="conversations"&gt;{{cite news   |url=https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2013/apr/26/academic-health-science-networks-role |title= Academic Health Science Networks: their role and development |publisher =The Guardian, 26 April 2013| accessdate= 21 June 2013 |location=London |first=Sarah |last=Johnson |date=26 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As membership organisations, AHSNs do not have any direct authority over their members, but Innovation Health and Wealth&lt;ref name="Innovation" /&gt; states: "all NHS organisations will aspire to be affiliated to their local AHSN where the AHSN will operate as a gateway for the NHS on innovation and working with the life sciences industry on the evaluation, commercialisation and rapid adoption of health technologies". They will be seen to be successful if and only if they can demonstrably improve the rate of adoption of medical technologies and [[Information and communication technologies|ICT]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2013/jul/01/2013-watershed-year-telehealth | title= Why 2013 Could Turn Out to be a Watershed Year for Telehealth | publisher=The Guardian, 1 July 2013 | accessdate= 2 July 2013 | location=London | first=Claire | last=Medd | date=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014 it emerged that NHS England’s 2014-15 business plan, showed that AHSNs would receive £53.6m this financial year, a 5 per cent cut on last year’s budget. However, it represents a larger 23 per cent cut on the £70m NHS England announced in May 2013. A senior AHSN figure told the [[Health Service Journal]] that NHS England risked “castrating” the programme by cutting the budget and by a perceived lack of promotion in the networks. “They are trying to save a comparatively small amount of money [by cutting the budget] but in doing so they risk castrating the AHSNs.Commissioners are not going to sign up to us if they are thinking that we are not going to be around in two years’ time.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Innovation network could slip into ‘self-defeating spiral’|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/topics/innovation/innovation-network-could-slip-into-self-defeating-spiral/5069|accessdate=4 May 2014|newspaper=Health Service Journal|date=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5977">In the [[United Kingdom]], the '''advance corporation tax''' (ACT) was part of a partial [[dividend imputation]] system introduced in 1973 under which companies were required to [[withholding tax|withhold tax]] on [[dividend]]s before they were distributed to shareholders. The scheme was similar to the way banks were required to withhold an amount at a set rate on interest earned on bank deposits before it is paid to the account holder.

In general, this payment meant that the recipients of the dividend were considered to have already paid basic rate tax on the dividend income. Non-taxpayers, such as pension funds, who would not otherwise have paid income tax on the dividend income, became entitled to claim a refund of the ACT amount, or after 1993 a lesser amount. The refund of ACT for non-taxpayers was scrapped in 1997, but in 1999 ACT was itself scrapped, effectively making dividend income of non-taxpayers tax-free again.

The amount of ACT paid by a company could also be offset against the company's profits reducing its final [[United Kingdom corporation tax|corporation tax]] bill. ACT was scrapped in 1999.

== History ==
Until 1973, company profits were taxed as profits, and dividend payments were then taxed as income. In 1973, a partial imputation system was introduced for dividend payments, under which companies were required to withhold tax on dividends, called an advance corporation tax, before they were distributed to shareholders. UK companies could set off the ACT amount withheld against the overall company tax liability, subject to certain limits.&lt;ref name="CTM20105"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/ctm20105.htm Company Taxation Manual CTM20105 — ACT: set-off against CT on profits: introduction], HMRC. Retrieved 13 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; (The full amount of ACT paid could not be recovered if significantly large amounts of profits were distributed.) Shareholders of a UK company who received a dividend received a [[tax credit]] representing the ACT paid,&lt;ref name="CTM16120"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/ctm16120.htm Company Taxation Manual CTM16120 — Distributions: impact on CT: franked investment income: general], HMRC. Retrieved 12 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; which could be set off against their overall income tax liability.&lt;ref name="CTM15150"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/CTM15150.htm Company Taxation Manual CTM15150 — Distributions: general: tax consequences], HMRC. Retrieved 12 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Non-taxable shareholders, such as pension funds, were entitled to a refund of the ACT amount.

When introduced in 1973, the ACT rate on the gross dividend (the amount distributed plus the ACT withheld) was 30%, the basic rate of income tax at the time. Until 1993 the income tax rate payable on dividends was the same as all other income, and the ACT rate was adjusted to align it to changes in the basic rate of income tax. From April 1993, the ACT rate was cut to 22.5% while the tax rate on dividend income was set at 20%, the first time it was set at a different rate to that payable on other income (25%). The tax credit was tied to the 20% rate rather than the ACT rate of 22.5%, meaning that non-taxpayers could no longer claim a refund for the full amount that had previously been paid as ACT. The ACT rate was cut to 20% from April 1994.

In 1997, the tax credit was scrapped for non-taxpayers (except charities and [[Personal Equity Plan|PEPs]]), which had a particular impact on pension funds, which could no longer claim a refund for any amount that had previously been paid as ACT. The effect of the change was that pension funds became effectively taxed on dividend income by way of the now non-refundable ACT, thus lowering pension returns and allegedly resulting in the winding up of some pension funds. Treasury argued that the change was crucial to long-term economic growth: the existing corporation tax system created biased incentives for corporations to pay out profits as dividends to shareholders (including pension funds, who could then reclaim the tax paid) rather than to reinvest them into company growth (which would result in corporation tax being paid). The old system of corporation tax was widely viewed by economists as a constraint on British economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/evandavis/2007/04/that_pensions_raid.html That pensions raid], [[Evan Davis (journalist)|Evan Davis]] 2 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Times]]'' obtained documents under the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|Freedom of Information Act]] in April 2007 that showed the chancellor [[Gordon Brown]] had been advised that pension funds would suffer a £67 billion loss of the actuarial value of their assets as a net result of a combination of policies including the ACT change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article1599843.ece Gloomy predictions that the Chancellor chose to ignore - Times Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

ACT was scrapped from 6 April 1999,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/consult/consult_2.htm HM Revenue &amp; Customs: A modern system for corporation tax payments&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070307051505/http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/consult/consult_2.htm |date=March 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and replaced by a tax credit on dividend income of 10%. From 6 April 2016, the tax credit was itself abolished and replaced with a tax-free dividend allowance of £5,000.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dividend-allowance-factsheet/dividend-allowance-factsheet HM Revenue &amp; Customs Policy paper: Dividend Allowance factsheet]&lt;/ref&gt;

]]

'''Anne Clausdatter''', also known as '''Anne Arnold''' and ''Anna Clausdatter'' (born 5 June 1659 in [[Skien]], died 11 April 1713 at [[Borgestad Manor]]) was a Norwegian businesswoman and owner of [[Borgestad Manor]] in [[Skien]], one of the largest estates of [[Telemark|Bratsberg]]. Today, she is remembered i.a. as the title character of the poem ''[[Stolt Anne]]'' (''ca.'' 1700) by [[Hans Paus]], who was married to her first cousin. The poem portrays her as a generous person who was well liked by the population of [[Telemark]]. The poem is also notable for being the first written in [[dialect]] in Norway, and 12 verses were included in ''[[Norske Folkeviser]]'' (1853) by [[Magnus Brostrup Landstad]].

Anne Clausdatter was descended from the leading land owners and timber merchants of the [[Grenland]] area, and was married first to Stig Andersen Tønsberg (died 1690), and then to General [[Johan Arnold]] (died 1709)

An '''associate company''' (or '''associate''') in [[accounting]] and [[business valuation]] is a company in which another company owns a significant portion of voting [[shares]], usually 20–50%. In this case, an owner does not consolidate the associate's financial statements. Ownership of over 50% creates a [[subsidiary]], with its financial statements being consolidated into the parent's books. Associate value is reported in the [[balance sheet]] as an asset, the investor's proportional share of the associate's income is reported in the income statement and [[dividend]]s from the ownership decrease the value on the balance sheet. In Europe, investments into associate companies are called fixed financial assets.

Associate value in the [[enterprise value]] equation is the reciprocate of [[minority interest]].

Under the UK [[Companies Act 2006]], two companies are "associated" if one company is a subsidiary of the other or both are subsidiaries of the same body corporate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/pdfs/ukpga_20060046_en.pdf Companies Act 2006], section 256&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Australian Companies Institute''' ('''Ausbuy''') was, until 2016, a [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]], non-political organisation that encouraged [[Australians]] to support Australian-owned and Australian-made products and services. Their goal was to keep the jobs and profits in Australia and for the decisions to be made by Australians.

Due to a downturn in membership renewals and increased costs, the company went into voluntary administration and was [[Australian insolvency law#Liquidation|wound-up]] in 2016.&lt;ref name=rw-2016/&gt; The ownership of the Ausbuy logos, business name and trademarks were transferred to the [[Australian Made logo|Australian Made Campaign Ltd]].&lt;ref name=rw-2016/&gt;

{{toc level|3}}

==Objectives==
Ausbuy's main tasks involved communication at many levels as follows:

* To alert the people of Australia to the long term problems facing Australia and the possible effect on their children and grandchildren.
* Commenting on television and radio about relevant issues.
* Lobbying governments on such issues as labelling laws, foreign takeovers of Australian companies and competition issues.
* Publication of the ''Ausbuy Guide'',  designed to enable the Australian public to identify and support the products and services offered by Australian-owned companies. This book identified brands and was of a size that could be carried round by the principal shopper.
* Use of a [[logo]] which it licensed to its members to enable differentiation of their products and allow the consumer to identify them as being provided by Australian-owned companies.
* Arranging promotions with supermarkets to assist the members to sell their products.
* Publication of a newsletter discussing issues of the day in a non-partisan manner and using terms the general public understands.{{sfnp|Gallagher|2007|p=29}}

==Background==
&lt;small&gt;{{Essay-like|section|date=January 2010}}&lt;/small&gt;
After [[World War II]] Australia faced the problem of having an underdeveloped [[manufacturing]] base, which left it dependent on overseas supplies. There was a realisation that this situation, combined with Australia's geographic isolation, made it vulnerable. This led to the decision being made to build up manufacturing capability. The aftermath of war provided opportunities to recruit skilled workers from [[Europe]] and Australia was able to establish capacity behind the protection of a [[tariff]] wall. It became obvious that this wall had to be reduced but the rate of reduction ran well ahead of Australia's increasing ability to compete in a [[global market]]. 

===Effects of economic reform and tariff reduction===
Australia adopted policies of economic liberalisation and micro-economic reform in the early 1980s, including the privatisation of government corporations, deregulation of [[factor market]]s, floating of the [[Australian dollar]], and the reduction of trade protection.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron Clyde R ''[http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lab/86/cameron.html How the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party Lost Its Way] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120803004406/www.historycooperative.org/journals/lab/86/cameron.html |date=2012-08-03 }}''&lt;/ref&gt; Justifications for reducing trade tariffs included the portrayal of Australia as a good global citizen and, at the same time, reducing [[inflationary]] pressures. The costs have been high: Australia's [[foreign debt]] has risen extremely quickly, factories have closed and well-paid skilled jobs in factories have been replaced by unskilled jobs in the [[service industries]].{{sfnp|Gallagher|2007|p=27}}
 
Australia has effectively exported jobs overseas and its [[foreign debt]] exceeds A$600 billion and is growing. Australia simply does not produce more than it uses. The country has been living on borrowed time, and Australians have stopped talking about [[productivity]] and value adding. For example, Australia exports [[raw materials]] and its unique fine wool, but then imports them back at a higher value. [[Free trade agreements]] have been signed by Australia, which further expose what manufacturers it has left, and then Australian governments bolster strategic industries to save jobs.

Australia is recognised as an [[innovative]] and [[productive]] country, and it needs local governments and [[consumer]]s to appreciate and support what is unique to this country. The international trend of [[globalization|globalisation]] has been matched domestically with the rise of the mega store concept of retailing. Large [[supermarket]]s as well as warehouses have their selling policies based on ''anytime, everywhere, everything the same'', which means their procurement policies are centrally driven; they demand bulk orders from specific price competitive producers and farmers nor do these retail giants acknowledge local peculiarities and set a priority on ''Made in Australia''.{{sfnp|Fischer|2004|pp=111–113}}

===Buy Australian campaigns===
In its magazine ''Choice'' of January 1987 the Australian Consumers' Association advised [[consumers]] to ''Buy Australian'' when the quality was equal and the price comparable to imported products. Nevertheless, it is notable given that ''Choice'' is well regarded as an impartial source of information for Australian consumers, but the Australian Consumers' Association refused to make a commitment to favour an Australian product over a better product from overseas.{{sfnp|Australian Consumer's Association|1987|pp=32–33}} 

This could be classified as a typical means of [[moral suasion]], which can be seen as benevolent compulsion, or making others conform without enforcing rules directly. It is also termed simply ''suasion'' (in Japan it is known as ''window guidance'') which has been used to persuade consumers and institutions to keep to official guidelines. The ''moral aspect'' stems from pressing on the targets of the suasion their ''moral responsibility'' to operate in a way that is consistent with furthering the national good. In the United States it is known as [[jawboning]] - it means exercising the persuasive power of talk rather than legislation.{{sfnp|Fischer|2007|p=21}} 

In countries experiencing economic decline, especially those with a high [[unemployment]] level and [[trade deficit]], consumers are urged to buy locally made products to help create jobs, assist in defeating unemployment and to avoid import penetration. Sometimes it is a so-called ''war against unemployment'' where policy makers like to raise an appeal to [[patriotic]] behaviour, shifting the responsibility of employment and the level of high import penetration towards consumers.{{sfnp|Fischer|2007|pp=22–23}} Ultimately a successful moral suasion campaign which reduces import penetration significantly can be seen as a tax on imports with the potential to increase unemployment in the import sector as a result of decreasing demand for imports.

The lower supply of the [[Australian dollar]] may cause it to be of higher value in the foreign exchange markets, which obviously leads to a tax on exports, or consequently employment of Australians by Australian manufacturers producing goods for overseas markets will reduce.{{sfnp|Black|1995|p=8}} Furthermore, given that consumers are shifting their demand for consumer goods to domestic products, it still remains a dilemma whether the retailers and manufacturers of domestic products invest in Australian business operations. Or in other words, which authority controls that the profits remain in Australia?

==History of Ausbuy==
Ausbuy was founded in 1991 by Harry Wallace as a result of his family business of 120 years being lost to foreign [[import]]s deposited in Australia to gain market share. His company was only one example of this, as an increasing number of companies in Australia had been forced to sell out to foreign interests, and foreign governments subsidised their producers to sell cheaply into the Australian market in [[competition]] with Australian-owned companies who do not enjoy that level of government support.{{sfnp|Gallagher|2007|p=25}}

By 2007, Ausbuy had approximately 100 members, producing more than 3000 products across 150 categories. During the 2009 Truth in Labelling Senate Inquiry, Ausbuy was the only large representative organisation that   asked for Country of Origin to be required on labelling used by food producers, manufacturers and distributors.

Ausbuy presented a petition of over 55,000 signatures to the Federal Government in November 2012 asking for a moratorium on the sale of Australian land and wealth-creating assets until the establishment a national interest test.

On 26 May 2016, the Board of Directors decided to undertake voluntary winding up of the company.&lt;ref name=rw-2016/&gt; As a result of a number of factors including changes to country of origin labeling, downturn in membership renewals, increased one off costs associated with company structure, compliance and technology, Ausbuy was no longer able to continue as a going concern.&lt;ref name=rw-2016/&gt; Despite a wide range of activities and strategies designed to retain and grow membership over the previous 18 months, the organisation had continued its decline to a point where a voluntary winding up of the company was the only prudent option.

==History==

===Founding and early years===
Bechtel's business activities began in 1898 when [[cattle]] farmer [[Warren A.

Starting with the construction of Klamath River Highway in California in 1919, Bechtel ventured into jobs outside of building railroads. The company built roads, bridges, and highways throughout the [[western United States]]. The company worked on its first [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] projects in the 1920s for [[Pacific Gas and Electric Company]] in [[California]].&lt;ref name=Krause2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wright1973/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brunn2011&gt;{{cite book |author=Jason Henderson |editor=Stanley D.

In January 1931, Bechtel joined other contractors in the west to form [[Six Companies, Inc.]], a [[consortium]] created to bid for a contract from the [[Federal government of the United States|US government]] to construct the [[Hoover Dam]]. Six Companies won the bid in March and construction on the dam began in the summer of 1931.&lt;ref name=Hiltzik2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Krause2004/&gt;

===WWII, overseas expansion and the nuclear age===
Warren Bechtel died unexpectedly in 1933 while in [[Moscow]] on business. He was succeeded by his son, [[Stephen David Bechtel, Sr.|Stephen Bechtel, Sr.]], who became both the head of Bechtel and chief executive of the Hoover Dam project. Under his leadership, the Hoover Dam was finished in 1935. The project was the largest of its kind in US history at the time and Bechtel's first [[megaproject]].&lt;ref name=Wright1973/&gt;&lt;ref name=Church1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lubove1999&gt;{{cite news |title=Modern pharaohs |author=Seth Lubove |url=http://business.highbeam.com/392705/article-1G1-54663812/modern-pharaohs |work=[[Forbes]] |date=May 31, 1999 |accessdate=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], the [[United States Maritime Commission]] invited the company to bid for a contract to build half of their order of 60 cargo ships.

===Increased business and visibility===
The [[Early 1980s recession|recession of the 1980s]] turned the company’s focus toward new areas of growth including environmental cleanup and alternative energy projects.&lt;ref name=Rothman1991/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hayes1985&gt;{{cite news |title=Big Builders Learn to Think Small |author=Thomas C.

In 1991, Bechtel, in a joint venture with [[Parsons Brinckerhoff]], broke ground on Boston's Central Artery/Tunnel Project or "[[Big Dig]]," a project the company had been in charge of since 1986.&lt;ref name=Baker2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nelson03&gt;{{cite news |title=Bechtel says report on overruns was unfair |author=Scott Bernard Nelson |url=http://www.boston.com/globe/metro/packages/bechtel/022103_folo.shtml |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=21 February 2003 |accessdate=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Big Dig was, at the time, the largest and most complex urban transportation project ever undertaken in the United States. The 20-year project was critiqued for rising costs and an increasing scope of work, as the Big Dig became more complex than was originally estimated. Criticism of the project increased in 2005 when a leak sprang in one of the new tunnels. In the summer of 2006, a faulty tunnel ceiling panel collapsed, killing a motorist.&lt;ref name=Baker2006&gt;{{cite news |title=Big Dig tragedy could stain Bechtel's name / Delays, cost overruns, leaks and now a death in Boston puts spotlight on S.F. construction giant -- and some of its other mammoth projects |author=David R.

As a result of the [[Gulf war]], Bechtel took on the task of extinguishing oil well fires in [[Kuwait]] in 1991. This was part of the overall effort to rebuild the infrastructure of Kuwait.&lt;ref name=Lubove1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rothman1991/&gt;

In 1994, Bechtel began work on the US$20 billion [[Airport Core Programme|Hong Kong Airport Core Programme]], which was the largest civil engineering project at the time and included a [[Hong Kong International Airport|new airport]] and nine other infrastructure projects.&lt;ref name=Farley94&gt;{{cite news |title=Asia : Hong Kong's New Airport Finally Gets Off Ground |author=Maggie Farley |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-12-02/news/mn-4094_1_hong-kong |work=[[The Los Angeles Times]] |date=December 2, 1994 |accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rowe11&gt;{{cite book |title=Emergent Architectural Territories in East Asian Cities |author=Peter G Rowe |authorlink= |year=2011 |publisher=[[Walter de Gruyter]] |location= |isbn= |page=84 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GeuaUWm7RbAC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;lpg=PA84&amp;dq=Airport+Core+Programme+bechtel&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Lpdg-gIU1l&amp;sig=g7euwf-oOeQTrT0vz4UQXp0QArI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rG8PVKXsL8qbyAS29ICQCg&amp;ved=0CG8Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=bechtel&amp;f=false |accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bechtel's other major projects during the 1990s included the [[Athens Metro]] system,&lt;ref name=Church1998&gt;{{cite news |title=Stephen Bechtel: Global Builder |author=George J.

'''Brewers' Distributor Ltd.''' or '''BDL''' is a [[Canada|Canadian]] company that distributes [[beer]] throughout the four [[Western Canada|western provinces]] and three [[Territories of Canada|northern territories]].  It is a private [[joint venture]] company owned by [[InBev]] (parent company of [[Labatt Breweries]]) and [[Molson-Coors]] (parent company of [[Molson Breweries]] following the Molson-[[Coors Brewing Company|Coors]] [[merger]]).

==History==
The company was established in 1995 when Pacific Brewers Distributor in [[British Columbia]], Alberta Brewers Agents, Saskatchewan Brewers Association and Associated Beer Distributors in [[Manitoba]] (all of which were owned, or largely, owned by the two present shareholders) were consolidated into a single operation. BDL operates nine distribution centres and four [[cross dock]] facilities in [[Alberta]], British Columbia, Manitoba and [[Saskatchewan]].  The head office is located in [[Calgary]].

==Difference between Brewers Retail Inc.==
There are a few key differences between BDL and [[Brewers Retail Inc.]] which operates under largely the same ownership in the neighboring [[Canadian province|province]] of [[Ontario]].  First, BDL does not retail beer to consumers, it is only in the warehousing and distribution business.  Second, although BDL distributes the vast majority of beer sold in Western Canada, it has not been granted [[monopoly|monopolistic]] privileges by any provincial government.  Other domestic breweries are free to distribute their own beer if they wish – some non-shareholders (such as the [[Big Rock Brewery|Big Rock]] and [[Sleeman Breweries]]) have their own distribution chains although others voluntarily use BDL.  Third, BDL has been permitted to distribute some brands of [[imported beer]] since 2001 except in Alberta where the [[Alberta Gaming and Liquor Commission]] had already contracted out its entire distribution operation to a private company and {{As of|2006|lc=on}} continues to grant [[Connect Logistics Inc.]] the exclusive right to distribute imported beer to Alberta's privately owned establishments and stores.  BRI stocks imported beer in its [[The Beer Store]] locations but this beer is purchased through the [[Liquor Control Board of Ontario]].

==Clarification==
BDL does not distribute [[wine]] or [[distilled spirits]] in any province.  These are distributed in Alberta by the AGLC through its private contractor, and in the other western provinces and territories by their [[Alcoholic beverages in Canada|respective government-owned liquor corporations]].

Major '''Charles John Biddle''' (13 May 1890 – 22 March 1972) was an [[United States|American]] aviator, attorney, and author. He was a [[flying ace]] during [[World War I]]. Postwar, he launched a career in law and wrote his memoirs.

==Family and early life==
Charles John Biddle was born on 13 May 1890 at [[Andalusia (estate)|Andalusia]], the Biddle family estate near [[Philadelphia]].
His father was Charles Biddle (1857–1923) and mother was Letitia Glenn. His grandfather [[Charles John Biddle]] (1819–1873) was a soldier in the [[Union Army]] and subsequently a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]]. Andalusia was the estate of his great-grandfather, banker [[Nicholas Biddle (banker)|Nicholas Biddle]] (1786–1844).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Old roads out of Philadelphia |author= John Thomson Faris |publisher= J.B. Lippincott |year= 1917 |pages= 301–302 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=pkIuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA301 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Andalusia History |work= museum web site |url= http://www.andalusiapa.org/about/history.html |accessdate= 16 March 2011 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101106230126/http://www.andalusiapa.org/about/history.html |archivedate= 6 November 2010 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was an hereditary member of the [[Aztec Club of 1847]].

He graduated from [[Princeton University]] in 1911, and from [[Harvard Law School]] three years later. He was admitted to the Pennsylvania Bar, but interrupted his nascent career to serve in [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="aces"&gt;{{cite book |title= American Aces of World War I |author= Norman Franks |others= Illustrated by Harry Dempsey |pages= 23–24 |publisher= Osprey Publishing |year= 2001 |isbn= 978-1-84176-375-0 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=fb9QUlLwT_kC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War I service==
[[File:13th Aero Squadron - Salmson 2A2-3.jpg|thumb|left|Major Biddle's [[13th Aero Squadron]] SPAD S.XII "cannon fighter", 1918.]]
Biddle joined the  [[Lafayette Flying Corps]] in France on 8 April 1917. He was assigned to [[Escadrille 73]] as a private on 28 July 1917, under the command and mentorship of [[Albert Deullin]].  He was promoted to corporal on 2 June and to sergeant on 1 December.  Biddle initially fought several indecisive combats with a [[Spad VII]], but success evaded him until 5 December 1917. Flying a [[SPAD XIII]], he downed the [[Albatros Flugzeugwerke|Albatros]] two-seater of Leutnants Fritz Pauly and Ernst Sauter of [[Feldflieger Abteilung|FFA]] 45 despite a malfunction by both his Spad's machine guns.

Biddle transferred to the American [[103rd Aero Squadron]] on 10 January 1918 and was commissioned as a captain in the Aviation Section of the U.S. Army Signal Corps on 12 January 1918.  He then and reverted to the Spad VII for his 12 April win over a [[Halberstadt CL.II]] over [[Corbeny]].&lt;ref name="spad"&gt;{{cite book |title= SPAD XII/XIII aces of World War I |author= Jon Guttman |publisher= Osprey Publishing |year= 2002 |isbn= 978-1-84176-316-3 |pages= 12, 14–15 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=NrO1Y3RzyWIC }}&lt;/ref&gt; He moved on to the [[13th Aero Squadron]] (nicknamed "The Devil's Own Grim Reapers").

On 1 August, he shared his first two victories with [[William Howard Stovall]], John Seerly, and H. B. Freeman. He shot down three more enemy planes afterwards-his 5th official credit was a Rumpler CIV of Fliegerabteilung 46LB {pilot Eichler {POW} observer Gröschel {DOW} August 16, 1918.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaerodrome.com/forum/showthread.php?t=17766 The Aerodrome Forum]&lt;/ref&gt;  He was at one point entrusted with the only [[SPAD XII]] issued to Americans.&lt;ref name="spad"/&gt;  He was promoted to the rank of [[major (United States)|major]] on 1 November &lt;ref name="aero"&gt;{{cite web |title= Charles Biddle |work= The Aerodrome web site |url= http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/usa/biddle.php |accessdate= 16 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was given command of the [[4th Pursuit Group]].&lt;ref name="aces"/&gt;  He returned to the United States on 19 December and was discharged from the Army on 25 January.&lt;ref&gt;Harvard's Military Record in the World War.  pg. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recognition of his service, the French awarded him both the [[Legion of Honor]] and the ''[[Croix de Guerre]]'', and he received the American [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]] and the Belgian [[Order of Leopold II]].&lt;ref name="aero"/&gt;

After the war, Biddle wrote a book entitled ''The Way of the Eagle''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The way of the eagle |author= Major Charles J. Biddle |year= 1919 |publisher= C. Scribner's sons |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=_moLAAAAYAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal career==
Biddle initially practiced law in the Drexel Building with his father's firm. Following his father's death, he joined the [[law firm]] of [[Drinker Biddle &amp; Reath]] (not using that name at the time) in 1924. He was the firm's first lateral partner and brought clients that  included the [[Philadelphia Contributionship for the Insurance of Houses from Loss by Fire]] (founded by [[Benjamin Franklin]]) and the [[Philadelphia Savings Fund Society]]. Biddle became a partner in 1925 and was a major force at the firm for decades. In the 1950s, he led the defense of [[Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme]] in a major case concerning price-fixing. At a trial in [[Trenton, New Jersey]], he argued successfully for Merck's acquittal with [[Thomas E. Dewey]] who represented Eli Lilly.&lt;ref name="firm"&gt;{{cite web |title= About Drinker Biddle: Firm History |work= company web site |url= http://www.drinkerbiddle.com/about/history/#Charles%20J.%20Biddle/ |accessdate= 16 March 2011 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080509155641/http://www.drinkerbiddle.com/about/history/#Charles%20J.%20Biddle/ |archivedate= 9 May 2008 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biddle also sued the U. S. government on behalf of three widows who lost their husbands in a [[B-29 Superfortress]] crash in 1948. This case was the first in which the government claimed national security privileges for its documents, as the B-29 was carrying out experiments with radar control of airborne drones. The case was settled without the government production of documents.&lt;ref name="claim"&gt;{{cite book |title= Claim of Privilege |author= Barry Siegel |others= |pages= 81–182 |publisher= HarperCollins |year= 2008 |isbn= 978-0-06-077702-9 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, partner Wilson M. Brown III&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drinkerbiddle.com/wbrown/ Brown's firm bio from Drinker Biddle &amp; Reath]&lt;/ref&gt; used a Charles Biddle precedent to reopen the case on behalf of the survivors of the scientists killed in a 1948 B-29 crash. The US government still claimed national security for its defense.&lt;ref name="firm"/&gt; The U. S. Supreme Court took the unprecedented step of examining its own prior decision of the case; the government claim was exposed as a fraudulent one used to cover up neglect in maintenance and poor air crew training as cause of the accident.&lt;ref name="claim2"&gt;{{cite book |title= Claim of Privilege |author= Barry Siegel |others= |pages= 232–305 |publisher= HarperCollins |year= 2008 |isbn= 978-0-06-077702-9 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in 1972.

==Honors and awards==
'''Distinguished Service Cross (DSC)''' citation

The Distinguished Service Cross is presented to Charles John Biddle, Captain (Air Service), U.S. Army, for extraordinary heroism in action in the region of Damvillers, France, September 26, 1918. During an engagement between 11 Spads and 12 enemy Fokkers, Captain Biddle, perceiving a comrade in distress from the attack of two planes, dived upon them and by his fire forced them to withdraw. His prompt action saved the life of his comrade, who was in imminent danger of being shot to the ground. (General Orders No. 60, W.D., 1920&lt;ref name="aero"/&gt;)
 
'''Ordre de Léopold''' citation

For extraordinary heroism in action on 12 April 1918 near Corbeny, France, and on 15 May 1918, near Ypres, Belgium. Captain Biddle has daily shown himself an excellent and remarkable example of courage, energy and skill, leading his pilots to the attack at every opportunity and making his flight a most efficient one. On 12 April, he attacked and destroyed an enemy two-seater which crashed between the trenches at Corbeny. On 15 May, while leading his patrol, he attacked, at very low altitude and far within the enemy lines, an enemy two-seater, killing the observer and forcing him down. A few minutes later he engaged a second enemy plane at very close range. Wounded in his leg, his plane and motor riddled, Captain Biddle was forced to land in 'No Man's Land' less than 70 yards from the German trenches in the region of Ypres. With remarkable courage and presence of mind and despite his wound, he detached himself from his smashed machine and made his way from shell hole under intense artillery, machine gun and rifle fire, to an advanced British Observation post.&lt;ref name="aero"/&gt;
 
'''French Croix de Guerre''' citation, 4 June 1918

Pilot of marvelous spirit. Attacked two enemy two-seaters successfully behind their lines, probably shooting down the first. Wounded and disabled in the course of the second combat, by sheer strength he succeeded in landing in no man's land and after passing the day in a shell hole, by night he got back to the Allied trenches.&lt;ref name="aero"/&gt;

''Chemical Leasing'' is a business model that intends to shift the focus from increasing sales volume of chemicals towards a value-added approach.&lt;ref&gt;[[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]]&lt;/ref&gt; It leads to the more efficient use of chemicals, and to the improved health and safety, environmental, and economic benefits. '''Find the definition and the examples''' on [http://www.chemicalleasing.org www.chemicalleasing.org] 

== Definitions ==
The term Chemical Leasing is the name of a business model and is NOT the same thing as leasing of chemicals, although it may include leasing operations.&lt;ref&gt;"Chemical Leasing" vs leasing of chemicals, Vojislavka Satric and Maria Grineva, ([https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/chemical-leasing-vs-chemicals-maria-grineva/ LinkedIn], 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

The producer mainly sells the functions performed by the chemical and the functional units, such as the number of pieces painted, are the main basis for payment.&lt;ref&gt;Chemical Leasing Goes Global&amp;nbsp;– Selling Services Instead of Barrels: A Win-Win Business Model for Environment and Industry, Eds Thomas Jakl and Petra Schwager, (Wien : Springer&amp;nbsp;– Verlag, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; It is a business model in which a customer engages with a service provider in a strategic, long-term contract to supply and manage the customer’s chemical and related services.&lt;ref&gt;M Stoughton, T Votta, Implementing service-based chemical procurement: Lessons and results. Journal of Cleaner Production 11(8) (2003) 839– 849.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Chemical Leasing applied in many companies, but sometimes under different names. Similar concepts: eco-efficient services, product-service systems, pay-per-use, circular-economy, performance-based, functional-based, service-oriented, chemicals-as-a-service, etc. In case of the doubt, it is better to check the official UNIDO definition of Chemical Leasing &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chemicalleasing.org Chemical Leasing website]&lt;/ref&gt;:

* Chemical Leasing is a service-oriented business model that shifts the focus from increasing sales volume of chemicals towards a value-added approach.
* The producer mainly sells the functions performed by the chemical and functional units are the main basis for payment.
* Within Chemical Leasing business models the responsibility of the user and the supplier is extended and may include management of the entire lifecycle.
* Chemical Leasing strives for a win-win situation. It aims at increasing the efficient use of chemicals while reducing the risks of chemicals and protecting human health. It improves the economic and environmental performance of participating companies and enhances their access to new markets.
* Key elements of successful Chemical Leasing business models are proper benefit sharing, high-quality standards and mutual trust between participating companies.

[[File:ChL service.jpg|center|500px|thumb|Differences between traditional buyer-seller relationship and service-based model of chemical leasing.]]


Chemical leasing promotes the sustainable management of chemicals. By shifting the focus from increasing the sales volume of chemicals towards a more value-added approach, it is an illustration of [[extended producer responsibility]]. The chemical company supplies chemicals for a specific service, such as coatings, adhesives, washing agents, solvents, and also advises the user on its best use.&lt;ref&gt;Anurag Priyadarshi, The Colourist, 1 (4) (2009) 8 &lt;/ref&gt;.

Built on strong cooperation between partners and based on mutual trust, it increases the efficient use of chemicals, reduces the risks to human health brought about by their use, improves the economic and environmental performance of participating companies and ultimately enhances business performance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.unido.org/our-focus/safeguarding-environment/resource-efficient-and-low-carbon-industrial-production/chemical-leasing] &lt;/ref&gt;

== Globalization ==
At the [[Earth Summit 2002]] on sustainable development, the international community agreed on the goal of ensuring that, by the year 2020, chemicals will be produced and used in ways that minimize significant adverse impacts on human health and the environment. As a consequence the [http://www.unep.org United Nations Environmental Programme] (UNEP) decided to develop of the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management ([[SAICM]]) in 2003. In 2006 at the International Conference on Chemicals Management (ICCM) in Dubai, the signing countries committed themselves to promote the sound management of chemicals and hazardous wastes at all levels.

The Austrian government has played an important role in promoting chemicals management based on resource efficiency and precaution. When Austria held the [[Presidency of the European Union]] during the first half of 2006, chemicals policy was on top of the environmental agenda. Austria continues to promote chemical leasing.

The [[Federal Environment Agency]] (UBA) of [[Germany]] proposed to promote chemical leasing in its "Sustainable Chemicals" paper.&lt;ref&gt;Chemical Leasing Unburdens Environment&amp;nbsp;– UBA presents sustainable chemicals concept, UBA Press Release 14 (Umwelt Bundes Amt, Germany, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; [https://web.archive.org/web/20110610142122/http://www.umweltdaten.de/publikationen/fpdf-l/3734.pdf][http://www.chemikalienleasing.de/]

== UNIDO ==

In 2004, the [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]] (UNIDO) and the [[Austrian Ministry of Environment]] decided to jointly support chemical leasing through a number of global projects.  In partnership with [[National Cleaner Production Centers]], UNIDO has implemented chemical leasing projects in Austria, Egypt, Mexico, and Russia. Since then, pilot projects have been conducted in Latin and South America, Africa, Europe and Asia. Nowadays, more than 100 companies worldwide have included Chemical Leasing in their business strategies. 

Chemical Leasing can be applied in many industries and processes, ranging from car manufacturing to cleaning operations, wastewater treatment, textiles, beverage and food production. Some examples of the successful Chemical Leasing collaboration between the chemical user and the chemical supplier can be found here: http://chemicalleasing-toolkit.org/node/8 

A Joint Declaration of Intent on Chemical Leasing was signed between UNIDO, Austria, Germany and Switzerland in November 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unido.org/news/press/joint-declaration-of.html|title=Joint Declaration of Intent on Chemical Leasing signed between UNIDO, Austria, Germany and Switzerland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

PERO Innovative Services GmbH together with [[SAFECHEM Europe GmbH]], a subsidiary of [[The Dow Chemical Company]], have supported Automobiltechnik Blau in metal cleaning to use cost-efficient machines, lower the energy consumption and chemical usage.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}

[[Akzo Nobel Powder Coatings]] S.A.E has supported the chemical leasing of [[powder coating]] in Egypt to [[ABB ARAB]]. Environmental benefits are said to include recycling of powder waste, compliance with environmental regulations, and enhancement of supply chain management.

== REACH ==
The reversal of the burden of proof is a key component of the [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals]] (REACH) system leading to a "no data&amp;nbsp;– no market" concept, obliging producers or importers of substances to deliver documentation regarding properties of chemicals and possible risks during their application as a pre-condition for market access. The OECD Conference in Vienna in 2003 Nov. reiterated that, "... The new EU chemicals policy (REACH) will require a new relationship between provider and user ...." According to [[Thomas Jakl]], Chairman of the European Chemical Agency (ECHA), chemical leasing paves the way to comply with REACH obligations.

Chemical leasing and REACH share the same philosophy of ensuring compliance with a [[duty of care]] (REACH recital 16), as a tool to demonstrate adequate control (REACH para 60). They are mutually supportive in developing rules for sharing costs, and ensuring that chemicals are handled properly. Both are involve several different stages of the supply chain. There is a strong effort by the Austrian and German Governments to bring chemical leasing within the purview of EU Chemicals policy and regulations.&lt;ref name="Barrels 2008"&gt;Chemical Leasing Goes Global&amp;nbsp;– Selling Services Instead of Barrels: A Win-Win Business Model for Environment and Industry, Eds T Jakl and P Schwager, (Wien : Springer&amp;nbsp;– Verlag, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ChL REACH.jpg|500px|thumb|center|[[Synergy|Synergies]] between chemical leasing and [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals|EU REACH]] legislation.]]

== Project phases ==
Chemical leasing projects are divided into planning, implementation, evaluation and dissemination stages, based on a [[Deming Cycle]]. The planning stage consists of a preparatory phase, a process optimisation phase and a design phase. In this stage, discussions around the leasing model, its cost implications versus quality and environmental benefits, commercial terms, and conditions begin. A baseline audit is performed, and a report presented to the factory management. This audit outlines the potential for improvements and forms the basis of defining the [[key performance indicators]] (KPIs). The resources needed to fulfil improvements are also defined.

The implementation stage starts with the signing of a chemical leasing agreement that defines the scope and conditions, unit of payment, KPIs, roles, and responsibilities. The chemical company  supervises the chemical process, transporting and managing the inventory, laboratory management, improving process controls, record keeping, and training workers. Periodic checks and inspections are carried out independently to verify that the implementation is proceeding on expected lines. At the end of the implementation phase, progress is evaluated, often by an external party to secure objectivity. Finally, any project benefits are quantified and learning is documented, to provide input for future projects.&lt;ref name="Barrels 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anurag Priyadarshi, Chemical Leasing in Colour and Environmental Management&amp;nbsp;– theoretical framework, implementation methodology and future outlook, paper read at UNIDO&amp;nbsp;– GCPC Chemical Leasing workshop, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global Chemical Leasing Award ==

16 January 2018 - [https://www.unido.org/news/fourth-global-chemical-leasing-award-call-entries The United Nations Industrial Development Organization announced] the fourth Global Chemical Leasing Award. The award ceremony will take place on 6 November 2018 in Vienna, Austria. It will be part of the Green Chemistry Conference 2018 within the Trio Presidency of the Council of the European Union (EU) programme, “Smart and Sustainable Europe”, held during Austria’s EU Presidency.

Companies and individuals are invited to submit applications for the award in three categories:  case studies (for companies), research, and special innovation. The call for applications is open until 15 August 2018. More information can be found at www.chemicalleasing.org

The Global Chemical Leasing Award has been launched in 2010. The Award intends to further enhance the global visibility of Chemical Leasing, acknowledge best practices and inspire companies and individuals around the globe to apply the Chemical Leasing business concept by reducing the inefficient use and over-consumption of chemicals and developing strong business partnerships and innovation along the entire supply chain.&lt;/ref&gt; The awards took place in 2010 (Prague), in 2012 (Frankfurt-am-Main), and in 2014 (Vienna).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8870">'''Constant elasticity of substitution''' ('''CES'''), in [[economics]], is a property of some [[production function]]s and [[utility function]]s.

Specifically, it arises in a particular type of aggregator function which combines two or more types of consumption goods, or two or more types of production inputs into an aggregate quantity. This aggregator function exhibits constant [[elasticity of substitution]].

==CES production function==
The CES [[production function]] is a [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical production function]] that displays constant [[elasticity of substitution]]. In other words, the production technology has a constant percentage change in factor (e.g. [[Manual labour|labour]] and [[Capital (economics)|capital]]) proportions due to a percentage change in [[marginal rate of technical substitution]]. The two factor (capital, labor) CES production function introduced by [[Robert Solow|Solow]],&lt;ref name="Solow1956"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Solow|first=R.M |year=1956 |title=A contribution to the theory of economic growth |journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics |volume=70 |pages=65–94 |doi=10.2307/1884513}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later made popular by [[Kenneth Arrow|Arrow]], [[Hollis B. Chenery|Chenery]], [[Bagicha Singh Minhas|Minhas]], and [[Robert Solow|Solow]] is:&lt;ref name="Arrow1961"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Arrow |first=K. J. |authorlink= |author2=Chenery, H. B. |author3=Minhas, B. S. |author4= Solow, R. M.  |year=1961 |title=Capital-labor substitution and economic efficiency |journal=Review of Economics and Statistics |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=225–250  |jstor=1927286|doi=10.2307/1927286 |publisher=The MIT Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jorgensen2000"&gt;{{cite book |title=Econometrics, vol. 1: Econometric Modelling of Producer Behavior |last=Jorgensen |first=Dale W. |authorlink= |year=2000 |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, MA |isbn=0-262-10082-7 |page=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Klump"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Klump |first=R |authorlink= |author2=McAdam, P |author3=Willman, A.  |year=2007 |title=Factor Substitution and Factor Augmenting Technical Progress in the US: A Normalized Supply-Side System Approach |journal=Review of Economics and Statistics |volume=89 |issue=1 |pages=183–192|publisher=The MIT Press |doi=10.1162/rest.89.1.183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; Q =  F\cdot \left(a \cdot K^r+(1-a) \cdot L^r\right)^{\frac{1}{r}} &lt;/math&gt;

where

*      &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; = Quantity of output
*      &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; = [[Total_factor_productivity|Factor productivity]]
*      &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; = Share parameter
*      &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; = Quantities of primary production factors (Capital and Labor)
*      &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;{\frac{(s-1)}{s}}&lt;/math&gt;
*      &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;{\frac{1}{(1-r)}}&lt;/math&gt; = Elasticity of substitution.

As its name suggests, the CES production function exhibits constant elasticity of substitution between capital and labor. Leontief, linear and Cobb–Douglas functions are special cases of the CES production function.  That is, 
* If &lt;math&gt;r=1&lt;/math&gt; we have a [[linear utility|linear]] or perfect substitutes function; 
* If &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; approaches zero in the limit, we get the [[Cobb–Douglas production function|Cobb–Douglas]] production function;
* If &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; approaches negative infinity we get the [[Leontief production function|Leontief]] or perfect complements production function.

The general form of the CES production function, with ''n'' inputs, is:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.econ.ucsb.edu/~tedb/Courses/GraduateTheoryUCSB/elasticity%20of%20substitutionrevised.tex.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; Q =  F \cdot \left[\sum_{i=1}^n a_{i}X_{i}^{r}\ \right]^{\frac{1}{r}}&lt;/math&gt;

where

*      &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; = Quantity of output
*      &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; = Factor productivity
*      &lt;math&gt;a_{i}&lt;/math&gt; = Share parameter of input i, &lt;math&gt; \sum_{i=1}^n a_{i} = 1 &lt;/math&gt;
*      &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt; = Quantities of factors of production (i = 1,2...n)
*      &lt;math&gt;s=\frac{1}{1-r}&lt;/math&gt; = Elasticity of substitution.

Extending the CES (Solow) functional form to accommodate multiple factors of production creates some problems. However, there is no completely general way to do this. [[Hirofumi Uzawa|Uzawa]] showed the only possible n-factor production functions (n&gt;2) with constant partial elasticities of substitution require either that all elasticities between pairs of factors be identical, or if any differ, these all must equal each other and all remaining elasticities must be unity.&lt;ref name="Uzawa1962"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Uzawa|first=H|year=1962 |title=Production functions with constant elasticities of substitution |journal=Review of Economic Studies|volume=29 |pages=291–299 | doi = 10.2307/2296305 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is true for any production function.  This means the use of the CES functional form for more than 2 factors will generally mean that there is not constant elasticity of substitution among all factors.

Nested CES functions are commonly found in [[partial equilibrium]]  and [[general equilibrium]] models. Different nests (levels) allow for the introduction of the appropriate elasticity of substitution.

==CES utility function==
The same CES functional form arises as a utility function in [[consumer theory]]. For example, if there exist &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; types of consumption goods &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;, then aggregate consumption &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; could be defined using the CES aggregator:

:&lt;math&gt; X = \left[\sum_{i=1}^n a_{i}^{\frac{1}{s}}x_{i}^{\frac{s-1}{s}}\ \right]^{\frac{s}{s-1}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here again, the coefficients &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt; are share parameters, and &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is the elasticity of substitution. Therefore, the consumption goods &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; are perfect substitutes when &lt;math&gt;s &lt;/math&gt; approaches infinity and perfect complements when &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; approaches zero. The CES aggregator is also sometimes called the ''Armington aggregator'', which was discussed by [[Paul Armington|Armington]] (1969).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Armington |first=P. S. |authorlink= |year=1969 |title=A theory of demand for products distinguished by place of production |journal=IMF Staff Papers |volume=16 |issue= |pages=159–178  |url= |accessdate= |doi=10.2307/3866403}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CES utility functions are a special case of [[homothetic preferences]].

The following is an example of a CES utility function for two goods, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;,  with equal shares:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Varian Microeconomic Analysis 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|112}}
:&lt;math&gt;u(x,y) =(x^r + y^r)^{1/r}.&lt;/math&gt;
The [[expenditure function]] in this case is:
:&lt;math&gt;e(p_x,p_y,u) =(p_x^r + p_y^r)^{1/r} \cdot u,\quad r=\frac{s}{s-1}.&lt;/math&gt;
The [[indirect utility function]] is its inverse:
:&lt;math&gt;v(p_x,p_y,I) =(p_x^r + p_y^r)^{-1/r} \cdot I,\quad r=\frac{s}{s-1}.&lt;/math&gt;
The [[demand function]]s are:
:&lt;math&gt;x(p_x,p_y,I) = \frac{p_x^{1/(r-1)}}{p_x^{r/(r-1)} + p_y^{r/(r-1)}}\cdot I,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y(p_x,p_y,I) = \frac{p_y^{1/(r-1)}}{p_x^{r/(r-1)} + p_y^{r/(r-1)}}\cdot I.&lt;/math&gt;

A CES utility function is one of the cases considered by [[Avinash Dixit|Dixit]] and [[Joseph Stiglitz|Stiglitz]] (1977) in their study of optimal product diversity in a context of [[monopolistic competition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dixit |first=Avinash |last2=Stiglitz |first2=Joseph |year=1977 |title=Monopolistic Competition and Optimum Product Diversity |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=67 |issue=3 |pages=297–308 |jstor=1831401 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note the difference between CES utility and [[isoelastic utility]]: the CES utility function is an [[ordinal utility]] function that represents preferences on sure consumption commodity bundles, while the isoelastic utility function is a [[cardinal utility]] function that represents preferences on lotteries. A CES indirect (dual) utility function has been used to derive utility-consistent brand demand systems where category demands are determined endogenously by a multi-category, CES indirect (dual) utility function. It has also been shown that CES preferences are self-dual and that both primal and dual CES preferences yield systems of indifference curves that may exhibit any degree of convexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baltas | first1 = George | year = 2001 | title = Utility-Consistent Brand Demand Systems with Endogenous Category Consumption: Principles and Marketing Applications | url = | journal = Decision Sciences | volume = 32 | issue = 3| pages = 399–421 | doi=10.1111/j.1540-5915.2001.tb00965.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''cost centre''' is a department within a business to which [[cost]]s can be allocated. The term includes departments which do not produce directly but incur costs to the business,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What Are the Functions of a Cost Center in a Management Accounting System?|url = http://smallbusiness.chron.com/functions-cost-center-management-accounting-system-76935.html|website = Small Business - Chron.com|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the manager and employees of the cost centre are not accountable for the profitability and investment decisions of the business but they are responsible for some of its costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is a cost center? {{!}} AccountingCoach|url = http://www.accountingcoach.com/blog/what-is-a-cost-center|website = AccountingCoach.com|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Cost Center Definition {{!}} Investopedia|url = http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cost-center.asp|website = Investopedia|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
There are two main types of cost centres:
* Production cost centres, where the products are manufactured or processed. Example of this is an assembly area.
* Service cost centres, where services are provided to other cost centres. Example of this is the personnel department or the canteen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Accounting for non-accounting students|last = Dyson|first = John R.|publisher = Pearson Education Limited|year = 2010|isbn = 978-0-273-72297-7|location = England|pages = 286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples ==
* Marketing department
* [[Human resources]]
* [[Research and development]]
* Work office
* [[Quality assurance]]
* Engineering
* [[Logistics]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Principles and Practice of Cost Accounting|last = Bhattacharyya|first = Asish K.|publisher = Prentice Hall|year = 2006|isbn = 81 203 2555 9|location = India|pages = 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cost centres can be trimmed down to the smallest segregated tasks within Departments. It is not necessary to consider departments as outright cost centres. Some companies adopt a different approach when treating cost centres.{{such as|date=June 2018}}

== Function-specific cost ==
The main function of a cost centre is the tracing of all expenses linked with a certain function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Financial Accounting|last = Perks|first = Robert|publisher = McGraw-Hill Education|year = 2007|isbn = 9780077115401|location = Berkshire|pages = 352–355}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, by considering a call centre as an independent unit, the firm can calculate how much it is spending each year for its 1-800 support service. If a cost centre is not considered independent then it would take a lot of effort in measuring the cost of providing this service because it will include dividing up the company's entire personnel and phone bills by department each month.

==Benefits==
There are numerous benefits of a cost centre which include:
* Monitoring [[efficiency]] – Cost centres are beneficial as they allow the effectiveness of all aspects within a company to be monitored closely.
* Employee confidence – The delegation of authority that takes place when making employees accountable for cost centre is a way to improve confidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SWOT Revision|url = http://www.swotrevision.com/pages/alevel/business/mod1_part10.html|website = www.swotrevision.com|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Loss prevention – Cost centres try to update processes, be more effective and save money so that they can reduce the expenses. Cost centres try to cover all of their costs with offsetting revenue by reducing expenses and producing unpredicted revenue, thus preventing loss.
* Increasing profit – If one of the cost centres is removed from a firm then it has a negative impact on the [[profit margin]] of that firm. For example, if an HR department was removed then basic employment functions and essential business processes cannot be performed which will affect the firm's profit negatively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is cost center? - Definition from WhatIs.com|url = http://searchcrm.techtarget.com/definition/cost-center|website = SearchCRM|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Management efficiency – Managers compare cost data from different time periods in order to see whether the cost centre is becoming more or less profitable. Generally a specific person (a cost centre manager) is held accountable for costs incurring in the cost centre under his or her control, in which case, collecting and comparing costs may motivate the manager to be more productive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Accounting Information for Managers|last = Clarke|first = Peter J.|publisher = Oak Tree Press|year = 2002|isbn = 1 86076 248 4|location = Ireland|pages = 131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drawbacks==
There are a few drawbacks of cost centre which include:
* Negative effects on other departments - although the cost of operating a specific department is simple to calculate, cost centres are a source of encouragement for managers to underfund their elements so that it can benefit the cost centre, which can have a harmful effect on other departments within the firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is cost center? - Definition from WhatIs.com|url = http://searchcrm.techtarget.com/definition/cost-center|website = SearchCRM|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Hard to monitor efficiency - It is hard to keep a track of how efficient these centres are.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SWOT Revision|url = http://www.swotrevision.com/pages/alevel/business/mod1_part10.html|website = www.swotrevision.com|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Profit can not be controlled- Divisional performance can only be evaluated in terms of cost because profit is not in control of the manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Management Accounting for non-specialists|last = Gowthorpe|first = Catherine|publisher = Thomson Learning|year = 2005|isbn = 978 1 84480 206 7|location = London|pages = 302}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Efficiency and productivity cannot be assessed properly - in a cost centre, the result of a decision is calculated by cost alone; the achievements of the cost centre are not measured in financial terms, therefore it is hard to assess efficiency and productivity properly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Management Accounting|last = Pandey|first = I. M|publisher = Vikas Publishing|year = 1990|isbn = |location = India|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Difference between a cost centre and a profit centre ==
A cost centre adds to a firm's cost whereas a [[profit center|profit centre]] adds to the firm's cost and profit. Furthermore, the main objective of a cost centre is to minimise cost whereas the main objective of a profit centre is to maximise profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Cost Accounting|last = Tulsian|first = P C|publisher = McGraw Hill|year = 2006|isbn = 978 0 07 062043 8|location = Delhi|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Profit centres provide a wider and more general measurement of performance than the cost centre. In cost centre, the manager is only responsible for the cost whereas in a profit centre, the manager is responsible for cost and profit. In situations like this when manager is responsible for both, profit and cost, the contribution of each manager to the goal of the firm becomes easier to measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Cost Accounting|last = Khan|first = M Y|publisher = McGraw- Hill|year = 2000|isbn = 0 07 040224 8|location = New Delhi|pages = 21–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dani Antoun Bterrani''' is the founder of 3dr Models, the largest model making company in the Middle East. 3dr Models work on residential development, government buildings, university buildings, airports, public &amp; private institutions, banking and financial institutions, health care facilities, recreational &amp; sports facilities and more.

Mr. Bterrani is also responsible for creating the following companies: 3d Innovations, ADF Properties in Lebanon, Falmoze and BT Investments.

==Biography==

===Personal life===

'''Dani Antoun Bterrani''' is a Lebanese national. He was born in Kuwait and married in Beirut before moving to the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E) with his wife and three children. He studied in the U.A.E and majored in Economics.

Mr. Dani A. Bterrani has made a solid mark in the architectural model industry from a very young age. Born to an architect father, he got his basic training on blueprints and scale model calculations.
Now heading 3dr Models, a huge company that has grown to become an internationally recognized firm, with production center boasting an area of 50,000 sq.feet, well equipped state of the art machines, and more than 400 skillful professional model makers, has been a part of more than 5000 projects.

===Professional life===

In 1990, Mr. Bterrani opened his first model making workshop, 3d Model Making in Dubai, U.A.E, with only five workers. The effort he put into his models, in terms of details and passion, were quickly recognized by his clients, causing his company and reputation to grow.

In 1998, 3d Model Making branched out to signage laser and water-jet technologies under a new name, 3d Innovations. 
 
In 2002, he further diversified into wooden flooring trading and installation.

Meanwhile, the demand for model making was growing rapidly and in 2005, Bterrani met his current partner, Ray Cheung. With the same model making history in common, they immediately joined forces and created what is now the largest model making facility in the world.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2vzRDsR6qM&amp;list=UU2wIgPEizZ1-Q3Avk0Fd19Q&amp;index=30 Middle East Business, BBC Report.&lt;/ref&gt;

3dr Models and [https://www.rjmodels.com.hk/ RJ Models] currently have 18% of the world’s model making market, occupying 12,800 square meters with over 500 in manpower, producing over 60 models per month.

In 2009, Mr. Bterrani, diverted into real estate in Lebanon and established ADF Properties, which aimed to develop, rent and sell properties within Lebanon. In 2010, he proposed and initiated the world's largest Santa Clause Village to be built at the peak heights of Lebanon.

In 2011, Mr. Bterrani decided to venture into F&amp;B, where the Falmoze brand was created, and aimed to be a new kind of simple healthy food chain of outlets.

In 2012, Mr. Bterrani created BT Investments, a holding company that consolidates all his companies under a centralized management with an estimated turnover of over 150,000,000USD.

The companies under BT Investments include 3dr Models, ADF Properties, 3D Innovation and Falmoze.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bt-investments.com|title=BT-INVESTMENTS|website=www.bt-investments.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Mr. Bterrani was featured in Middle East Architect magazine as one of the Power 50 who shaped the architecture of the Middle East (page 62).&lt;ref&gt;http://edition.pagesuite-professional.co.uk/launch.aspx?eid=f9d6cabe-df30-406b-b378-118c53d2cef3 Middle East Architect, December 2013, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 Mr. Bterrani created an offshore company DAMA aimed to capture high end Italian Brands into F&amp;B Outlets, and has its first brand "Trussardi" signed.

===Architectural Models===

Bterrani and [https://www.rjmodels.com.hk/people/ Ray Cheung] published a book entitled Architectural Models. It was sold in Hong Kong libraries in its first year, but it now serves as a portfolio and catalog of every model they have made.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6884">'''Ernest Cable, 1st Baron Cable''' (1 December 1859 – 28 March 1927)&lt;ref name = "Riddick (2006), p. 241"/&gt; was an [[India]]n-born [[United Kingdom|British]] merchant and financier.

==Background==
Born in [[Calcutta]], he was the eldest son of George Hebberd Cable, a superintendent with the [[Indian Customs and Excise Service]].&lt;ref name = "Walford (1919), p. 208"&gt;Walford (1919), p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; His mother Emily Maria, was the daughter of William Pickersgill, who had served in the [[Royal Navy]].&lt;ref name = "Walford (1919), p. 208"/&gt; Cable was educated privately and at the [[University of Calcutta]].&lt;ref name = "Riddick (2006), p. 241"/&gt;

In 1886, he became a [[business partner|partner]] in the company.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkins and Schröter (1998), p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; By 1896 it directly employed 15,000 people and contracted 15,000 more.&lt;ref name = "Harrison (1964), p. 52"&gt;Harrison (1964), p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this expansion was due to Cable's business acumen and his knowledge of India and good relations with its people.&lt;ref name = "Harrison (1964), p. 52"/&gt; He also set up a subsidiary in the [[City of London]] to ease British investments in the company.&lt;ref name = "Harrison (1964), p. 94"/&gt; By 1914 he was senior partner of the company.&lt;ref name = "Harrison (1964), p. 94"&gt;Harrison (1964), p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917 Bird acquired a controlling interest in F. W. Heilgers and Co, another Calcutta merchant house, creating by far the largest company in India, employing 100,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison (1964), p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

After his return to England by 1913, Cable was invited into the Royal Commission on Indian Finance and Currency&lt;ref name = "Who's Who (1926), p. 444"/&gt; and in 1916 he was appointed [[High Sheriff of Devon]].&lt;ref&gt;Whitaker (1923), p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1921 New Year's Honours he was raised to [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]] with the title '''Baron Cable''', of Ideford, in the County of [[Devon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=32178|supp=y|page=1|date=31 December 1920}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue = 32212 |page=858 | date = 1 February 1921 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The couple had two daughters and two sons, both named George. The first died at or near birth and was buried on February 6th, 1891, in Calcutta, Bengal, India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=George Pickersgill Cable LT61-TDP.|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:FGVY-K29|publisher=India Deaths and Burials, 1719-1948}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second was born December 5th, 1891 at Ideford.

[[File:Litfass Ernő.jpg|thumb|Ernst Litfaß in 1855]]
[[File:Litfass-tomb.JPG|thumb|220px|Litfaß's grave in Berlin]]
'''Ernst Amandus Theodor Litfaß''' (or '''Litfass'''; {{IPA-de|ˈlɪtfas}};&lt;ref&gt;
''Litfaß'' is a [[proper name]] and thus not affected by the [[German spelling reform]] although the ''a'' in ''Litfaß'' is a short vowel and the following ''[[ß]]'' would otherwise have to be turned into an ''ss''. Accordingly, ''Litfaß'' is still correct, while ''Litfass'' is acceptable in non-German contexts.&lt;/ref&gt; 11 February 1816 &amp;ndash; 27 December 1874) was a German printer and publisher. He invented the free-standing cylindrical [[advertising column]] which bears his name in [[German language|German]] (''Litfaßsäule'').

==Biography==
[[File:Litfaß column Feb05.JPG|thumb|220px|A ''Litfaßsäule'' in [[Vienna]], Austria. The advertisements are for concerts with [[Ton Koopman]] and [[Kurt Masur]] respectively; at the bottom there is the weekly programme of the theatres of Vienna.]]
Born in Berlin, Litfaß took over his stepfather's business in 1845 and became the editor of a number of newspapers and pamphlets.  As publisher, he completed, in 1858, the edition of the ''[[Oekonomische Encyklopädie]]'' (in 242 volumes), which had been started by [[Johann Georg Krünitz]] in 1773.

In 1854 Litfaß proposed putting up columns in the streets of Berlin for announcement and advertising purposes. Allegedly, he was disgusted by the unsystematic and ubiquitous posting of pamphlets, notices and other materials on walls, doors, fences and trees. In December that year he was granted permission to erect such ''Annoncier-Säulen'' columns, and on 1 July 1855 the first 100 ''Litfaß-Säulen'' were presented in Berlin.

Litfaß had a monopoly on his [[advertising column]]s and grew rich fast. After his death in [[Wiesbaden]] in 1874, the idea of putting up ''Litfaßsäulen'' (''Litfaß columns'' or ''Litfaß pillars'') quickly spread to other German cities. Today, they can be found in other countries as well.

Later developments include the electrically powered slowly revolving Litfaß column; Litfaß columns that serve as vents for underground services; and the Litfaß column with a hidden door whose interior is used for storage purposes (tools for [[street sweeper|street sweeping]], electrical appliances, etc.)

Litfaß supported wounded veterans of the wars of 1864, 1866 and 1870–71 and their relatives by sponsoring concerts, fireworks, boat tours and donating the proceeds to charities.

He died during a spa in [[Wiesbaden]] and was buried in a honorary grave on the Dorotheenstadt cemetery in Berlin.

==Cultural references==
*In the movie ''[[The Third Man]]'', Harry Lime (played by [[Orson Welles]]) uses one of these columns as an escape route to the sewer system under Vienna.
*In the movie ''[[Gremlins 2: The New Batch|Gremlins 2]]'', Billy Peltzer (played by [[Zach Galligan]]) and Daniel Clamp (played by [[John Glover (actor)|John Glover]]), use one of these columns as an escape route from the [[Gremlin]]-infested Clamp Building.
*In the movie ''[[Men in Black II]]'', Agent K (played by [[Tommy Lee Jones]]) and Agent J (played by [[Will Smith]]), use a column as an escape route from an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]]-infested [[Men in Black|MiB]] Headquarters.

[[File:Supermarket full of goods.jpg|thumb|right|Store aisle of fast moving consumer goods]]
[[File:Soft drink shelf 2.jpg|thumb|right|Soft drinks are FMCGs]]
'''Fast-Moving Consumer Goods''' ('''FMCG''') or '''Consumer Packaged Goods''' ('''CPG''') are products that are sold quickly and at a relatively [[low cost]]. Examples include non-durable goods such as [[packaged food]]s, [[beverage]]s, [[toiletries]], [[over-the-counter drug]]s, and other [[consumables]].&lt;ref name="Ramanuj_Majumdar"&gt;{{cite book | title = Product Management in India | author = Ramanuj Majumdar | publisher = PHI Learning | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-81-203-1252-4 | pages = 26–27 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ESJzaCJE3fQC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=what+is+fmcg&amp;q=what%20is%20fmcg | accessdate = 2010-06-19
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The advertising handbook By Sean Brierley | author = Sean Brierley | publisher = Routledge | edition = 2, illustrated | year = 2002 | page = 14 | isbn = 978-0-415-24391-9
}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many fast moving consumer goods have a short [[shelf life]], either as a result of high consumer demand or as the result of fast deterioration. Some FMCG, such as meats, fruits, vegetables, dairy products, and baked goods are highly perishable. Other goods, such as pre-packaged foods, soft drinks, candies, and toiletries have high [[Inventory turnover|turnover]] rates. Sales are sometimes influenced by holiday and/or seasonal periods.

[[Packaging]] is critical for FMCG.  Logistics and distribution systems often require secondary and tertiary packaging to maximize efficiency. Unit or primary packaging protects products and shelf life while providing product information to consumers.

The [[profit margin]] on FMCG products can be relatively small, but they are generally sold in large quantities; thus, the cumulative profit on such products can be substantial. FMCG is a classic low margin and high volume business. According to BASES, 84% of fast-moving consumer goods professionals are under more pressure to quickly bring new products to the market than they were five or ten years ago. With this in mind, 47% of those surveyed confessed that product testing suffers most when deadlines are accelerated.&lt;ref&gt;United States: Nielsen Bases Debuts Faster In-Home Product Testing Solution for Fast-Moving Consumer Goods. (2018, August 23). Mena Report. from http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-551430065.html?refid=easy_hf&lt;/ref&gt; The most innovative FMCG companies are now adopting agile design [https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/marketing-and-sales/our-insights/agile-marketing-a-step-by-step-guide/ Agile Marketing] and development principles which allow them to remain nimble in response to market demand and customer feedback.

The growth of the internet over the past quarter century and the rise of the [[brand community]] phenomenon have contributed greatly to the demand for FMCG. According to the AGOF internet facts, 73% of Germany's population is online. Additionally, 83.7% of internet users claim to use the web to search for information and 68.3% shop online&lt;ref&gt;Meister, S. (2012). Brand communities for fast moving consumer goods: An empirical study of members behavior and the economic relevance for the marketer. Wiesbaden: Springer Gabler.&lt;/ref&gt;. Vendors use the internet to their advantage to connect with consumers and market their goods, targeting consumers who show high identification with a specific brand or good. Marketers of FMCG have discovered this capability and are using it to build relationships with their customers to understand what they want.  

== Characteristics ==

The following are the main characteristics of FMCGs:&lt;ref name="Ramanuj_Majumdar"/&gt;

{{columns-list|
* '''From the consumer perspective'''
** Frequent purchases
** Low involvements (little or no effort to choose the item)
** Low prices
** Short shelf life 
** Rapid consumption
* '''From the marketer perspective'''
** High volumes
** Low [[contribution margin]]s
** Extensive [[distribution (business)|distribution]] networks
** High [[stock turnover]]
}}

== Rural Consumers ==
Consumers in rural areas typically purchase goods from nearby towns and villages.  Recently, there has been a shift in consumer purchase behavior towards [[Local purchasing|purchasing locally]] that has prompted the need for better local promotional efforts to generate brand awareness in small towns.  FMCGs play a large part in the economy as inelastic products that touch every part of consumer life in one way or another.  Businesses that supply FMCGs to a rural community can help provide employment opportunities as well as drive down the cost of such products in those rural areas.  For instance, the FMCG sector in India is the 4th largest sector in its economy and generates employment for more than 3 million people in downstream activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.journalijdr.com/sites/default/files/issue-pdf/Download%201068.pdf|title=RURAL CONSUMER BEHAVIOUR ON FAST MOVING CONSUMER GOODS|last=Singaravelu|first=Dr. K.|date=October 2013|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===WikiPilipinas===
Gaspar brought Wiki to the Philippines by the creation of his [[WikiPilipinas]] which introduced the '[[copyleft]]' [[Intellectual Property Rights|IPR]] model of Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2007/aug/27/yehey/techtimes/20070827tech1.html  manilatimes.net/national, Wiki comes to the Philippines Bringing along ‘copyleft’ IPR model popularized by Wikipedia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110222952/http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2007/aug/27/yehey/techtimes/20070827tech1.html |date=2007-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The WikiPilipinas team, headed by webmaster Richard Grimaldo (internet and telecommunications administrator of the Vibal Group of Companies) and Alfred Ursua as its managing editor [http://en.wikipilipinas.org/index.php?title=Alfred_Ursua], were responsible for Gaspar's initial Project Wikipiniana.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yehey.com/News/print.aspx?id=177982  www.yehey.com, Wiki comes to the Philippines]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://isulong-seoph.aboutmyrecovery.com/2007/08/23/wikipilipinas-profile/  isulong-seoph.aboutmyrecovery.com,  WikiPilipinas Profile] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20110707075903/http://isulong-seoph.aboutmyrecovery.com/2007/08/23/wikipilipinas-profile/ |date=2011-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaspar projected for the [[long tail]] [[phenomenon]] or effect (Wired Magazine editor Chris Anderson) of this Philippine Wiki [[encyclopedia]] to give more prominence to Filipino culture on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/infotech/view_article.php?article_id=84296  newsinfo.inquirer.net, Wikipilipinas founder aims for ‘long tail’ effect] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100515150906/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/infotech/view_article.php?article_id=84296 |date=2010-05-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vibal complained that "almost all the articles in Wikipedia are written from a Western point of view". But aiming not just for balance, Vibal opted more for "a national campaign to foster [[nationalism]]". And like many local editions of Wikipedia, Wikipilipinas already suffers from the "frog in the well" [[syndrome]]: a regional [[ghetto]] of interest only to angry nationalists protesting that the Philippines is doomed and that it's all someone else's fault.&lt;ref&gt;[http://netnewsasia.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=194&amp;Itemid=67 netnewsasia.com, Feeding the frogs in the well]&lt;/ref&gt;  On March 15, 2008, Vibal's WikiPilipinas created WikiFilipino, for Filipino culture and information. It is managed by Alfred Ursua, with  web support by Richard Grimaldo, and guidance by Roberto T. Añonuevo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fil.wikipilipinas.org/index.php?title=Wikifilipino:Pagpapakilala wikipilipinas.org/index, WikiPilipino]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filnet and ESP===
Gaspar's Filipiniana.net is a digital library and online research portal "that houses the most comprehensive collection of Filipino- related documents that are in the public domain, from letters from Spanish Governor-General Pedro de Acuña to King Philip III to an obscure 1933 Philippine romance novel entitled "Ang Magmamani", and makes it all available to the public at no cost at all".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2007/06/09/YTCP2007060995585.html  mb.com.ph, Filipiniana.net]&lt;/ref&gt; Launched on November 23, 2006, it was Richard Grimaldo's web development and applications expertise that was crucial in the development of Filipiniana.net to spearhead Vibal's vision "of democratizing Filipino access to information about the Philippines through the internet." It digitized rare and out of print books, documents, and images and publishing them online without any cost to the readers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipilipinas.org/index.php?title=Richard_Grimaldo   en.wikipilipinas.org, Richard Grimaldo]&lt;/ref&gt;
VIBAL Publishing's 1980 Educational Service Program (ESP) was a brainchild of Gaspar Vibal, and has "evolved to become a full-scale teacher-training program with year-round seminars and workshops to help teachers and school administrators nationwide meet the increasing demands and challenges posed by their profession".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.vibalpublishing.com/new_014.html |title=vibalpublishing.com,  Vibal Publishing, ESP |access-date=2008-04-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080210173510/http://www.vibalpublishing.com/new_014.html |archive-date=2008-02-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vibal stated that: "Today, it (Filipiniana.net) has one of the widest and most comprehensive collection of hard-to-find Filipiniana books and documents categorized under history, geography, culture, government, and society. It also features photographs, maps, paintings and illustrations, the Virtual Philippine Revolutionary Records, 100 Nobelang Tagalog, Virtual Blair and Robertson, and the Master Union Bibliography of the Philippines, 100 Pinoy Komik Serials, Premio Zobel.org, and Archivo General de Filipinas." Vibal also announced the forthcoming birth of his [[Idea|brainchild]] e-turo.org.&lt;ref name="newsinfo.inquirer.net"/&gt;

===e-turo.org===
On June 12, 2008, the 110th [[Philippine Declaration of Independence]] day, e.turo.org was created by the Vibal Foundation, (owned by Gaspar Vibal and his family) a nonprofit organization which previously launched Filipiniana.net, and WikiPilipinas.org (a reference guide on the Philippines). Tin Mandigma, editor-in-chief of E-turo.org explained that it is an e-learning portal which "seeks to provide free and quality learning materials online to teachers and students; it gives teachers access to lesson plans and modules based on textbook materials published by Vibal Publishing House, Inc. amid plans to offer Department of Education-approved content from various learning institutions as supplementary teaching materials. One of the most common complaints of teachers is that while the Internet has so much information, most of it cannot be adapted to the local classroom. With this project, we hope to help teachers sort through the clutter and give them quality information that would be useful for their students."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=121529 abs-cbnnews.com, RP e-learning portal launched on Independence Day]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Amid the Department of Education's controversy on recent textbook project, Vibal Publishing House Inc. admitted that it had interlocking ownership with an affiliate, the LG and M Corp, but denied accusations of being the leader of a [[cartel]]. Vibal and LG and M formed a [[consortium]] regarding the publication and delivery of 17.5 million elementary textbooks and teaching manuals for public elementary and high schools funded by P 800-million loan ($40 million) [[World Bank]] loan. Contracts were awarded in September, 2006 to Vibal and Watana Phanit, inter alia, despite a pending Supreme Court petition filed by losing bidders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://services.inquirer.net/print/print.php?article_id=70331  services.inquirer.net,  Vibal Publishing House: What cartel?]&lt;/ref&gt; Further, Gaspar clarified that [[Wikipilipinas]] "should be treated as a separate entity from his family's publishing business, Vibal Publishing".&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/infotech/view_article.php?article_id=84783  newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews,  Wikipilipinas founder answers credibility issues] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829010904/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/infotech/view_article.php?article_id=84783 |date=2007-08-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rizaliana collection==
Vibal acquired the rare first edition copies of Dr. [[Jose Rizal]]'s novels, ''[[Noli Me Tangere (novel)|Noli Me Tangere]]'' and ''[[El Filibusterismo]]'', for his Filipiniana.net. Vibal discovered these at the Old Book Fair in [[Madrid]], Spain on October, 2006. These were part of the late [[Adelina Gurrea Monasterio]] collection. Vibal stated that: "They are very expensive" - opting to be careful not to reveal the price, for it might put the prized items in danger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knightsofrizal.org/content/?p=54 knightsofrizal.org,  Home at last for rare 'Noli,' 'Fili' copies]&lt;/ref&gt; Vibal spent 25 years of his life to bring back the original "Noli" and "Fili" to Philippine shores.&lt;ref&gt;[http://services.inquirer.net/print/print.php?article_id=35505  services.inquirer.net, There's The Rub : Flesh and spirit]&lt;/ref&gt;

Vibal has a {{convert|5|in|mm|adj=mid|-thick}} [[treasure]] collection of articles either written by, for, or about Dr. Jose Rizal, antiquated by dust and partly destroyed by [[termites]]. His wide collection of [[Filipiniana]] (printed works on Philippine history and culture) include:
*One volume of Ricardo Galang's first Philippine [[Encyclopedia]], published in 1939 (there were only 1,000 copies of the 20 volumes).
*One of the early copies of the 1935 [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]] [[Constitution of the Philippines]].
*[[Historian]] Esteban Ocampo's 40-year-old Rizaliana collection which he salvaged from the Heritage Art Center in [[Cubao]], Quezon City.
*Copies of first editions of [[Rizal]]'s ''[[Noli Me Tangere (novel)|Noli Me Tangere]]'' and ''[[El Filibusterismo]]''.
He digitized such historical resources / articles and upload them for free on filipinana.net. and wikipilipinas.org. Vibal and associate, Jaime Marco, initiated the portal with the help of Spanish historian Carlos Madrid.

'''Global Road Entertainment''' is an American [[film]] production and distribution company based in Los Angeles, California. It was launched in March 2011 as '''Open Road Films''' by the two largest American [[Movie theater|theatrical exhibitors]], [[AMC Theatres]] and [[Regal Entertainment Group]], who both owned the company as a joint venture until it was acquired by Tang Media Partners, a media company owned by [[Donald Tang]], in August 2017. After Tang's purchase, Open Road merged with [[IM Global]] and renamed to its current name.&lt;ref name=vty/&gt; In September 2018, Open Road declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and in November 2018, agreed to be purchased by Raven Capital Management pending court approval.

'''i-net Clear Reports''' (formerly known as i-net Crystal-Clear) is a Java-based cross-platform reporting application providing a [[report]] designer and a server component to create reports in numerous output formats like PDF, HTML, PS, RTF, XLS, TXT, CSV, SVG, XML, as well as being viewable in a Java applet or Swing component.&lt;ref name="Freshmeat"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://freshmeat.net/projects/crystalclear |title = i-net Clear Reports / freshmeat.net |date = May 15, 2009 |accessdate = 2009-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Application programmers can integrate i-net Clear Reports using the public [[API]] which spans over 200 classes.&lt;ref name="API"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inetsoftware.de/documentation/clear-reports/online-help/programming/apispec/index.html |title = i-net Clear Reports API |date = May 17, 2011 |accessdate = 2011-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting with release 11.0 i-net Clear Reports also supports the [[.NET Framework|.NET]] programming language and offers a public API for further integration in other products.

==History==
in Version 11.0 i-net Crystal-Clear was renamed to i-net Clear Reports. At this time it also gained .NET integration as a major feature.

i-net Crystal-Clear was primarily designed to read [[Crystal Reports]] templates. It had to be capable of reading the RPT report format and producing a reasonable output. For exporting and saving reasons a new file format had to be created later on, enabling Crystal-Clear to save the API results back and make them editable by a designer.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inetsoftware.de/products/clear-reports/developement-timeline |title = Development Timeline |date = March 17, 2011 |accessdate = 2011-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 the first version of i-net DesignerXML, the report designer, was written using Java Swing. The editing concept is slightly different from some other designers, using a band-oriented report template format, meaning that reports are designed based on rows of data.

The development efforts has changed in more recent years to a full reporting platform approach, rather than the developer-only, framework-based one.

True to its roots, i-net Crystal-Clear still has the ability to read and execute Crystal Reports report templates up until the latest versions of Crystal Reports.

Unlike Crystal Reports, however, the i-net Crystal-Clear report file format has always been an open format. Until version 9.0 it was an XML format. Since version 9, the report file format is in a [[ZIP (file format)|zip]]-based format similar to [[OpenDocument]].

==Flexibility==

Being a Java application, i-net Clear Reports has the ability to run on a variety of platforms and environments. There is virtually no restriction concerning data sources that can be used, as long as there is a [[JDBC]] driver available for accessing the data. For non-JDBC data sources, there are how-to's to write simple mini-drivers. With the new .NET API it got even more flexible and allows integration into .NET based applications.

i-net Clear Reports comes as a standalone server as well as a [[servlet]] which can be run on any [[Java EE]] application server such as [[Apache Tomcat|Tomcat]], [[Jetty]], [[Internet Information Services|IIS]], or [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]] (via [[PHP]]).

Features can be added using the public [[API]], or by adding custom [[JavaBeans]] which can be added to reports. User defined functions (UDF) extend the formula features of the embedded formula calculation routines.

'''Joaquín Bau Nolla''' (1897&amp;ndash;1973) was a [[Spaniards|Spanish]] [[Carlism|Carlist]] and [[Francoism|Francoist]] politician.

==Family and youth==
[[File:Tortosa - Casa Bau 2.JPG|thumbnail|160px|left|Casa Bau, Tortosa]]
Joaquín Bau Nolla was born to a [[bourgeoisie]] [[Catalans|Catalan]] family. His paternal grandfather [[Miguel Bau Isern]] (1836-1911) ran a chocolate manufacture in [[Tortosa]]&lt;ref&gt;Joaquín Monserrat Cavaller, ''Joaquín Bau Nolla y la restauración de la Monarquía'', Madrid 2001, {{ISBN|8487863949}}, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; and served as mayor of the city in 1901-1903,&lt;ref&gt;Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; co-founding Banc de Tortosa,&lt;ref&gt;Emili Llorente, ''La fundació del Banc de Tortosa (1881)'', [in:] ''Recerca'' 9 (2005), p. 261&lt;/ref&gt; Cambra Agricola de Tortosa and the local Cambra de Comerç.&lt;ref&gt;Roc Salvadó Poy, ''L'Escola del Treball perilla'', [in:] ''Quaderns de l'Elbe'' 1 (2010), p. 11, ''Miquel Bau i Isern'' entry at ''ilercavonia'' service,&lt;/ref&gt; One of his 16 children&lt;ref&gt;according to an anecdote, one of his children did some damage to his shop; Bau Isern summoned the culprit and commenced the interrogation by asking angrily "who is your father?". "You are, sir" – responded the frightened offender, referred after Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; and Joaquin's father,&lt;ref&gt;some sources claim Jose Bau Verges was brother of Miguel Bau Isern, see Llorente 2005, p. 283&lt;/ref&gt; [[José Bau Vergés]] (1868-1935), was an oil and vinegar trader and producer. He grew from a local merchant, transporting oil on his mules,&lt;ref&gt;Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; to "el rei de l'oli",&lt;ref&gt;Llorente 2005, p. 283&lt;/ref&gt; the owner of Aceites Bau S.A., a Tortosa-based company operating two factories,&lt;ref&gt;Monserrat Cavaller 2001, pp. 21-2&lt;/ref&gt; selling on the national Spanish market and exporting to South America, especially to [[Argentina]]. Following the commercial success, Bau Vergés built an imposing family residence in Tortosa; he was also honorary consul of [[Uruguay]] and Argentina,&lt;ref&gt;Salvadó Poy 2010, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; member of local business organizations and a Catholic activist.&lt;ref&gt;Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; In 1894 he married María Cinta Nolla Poy,&lt;ref&gt;''Josep Bau i Vergés'' entry at ''ilercavonia'' service&lt;/ref&gt; a [[stonemason]]'s daughter.&lt;ref&gt;it is not clear whether she was anyhow related to the Carlist general and organizer of Carlist hospital network during the Third Carlist War, also a tortosino, [[Ramón Nolla Marti]]&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had 4 children, all brought up in highly religious ambience; Joaquín was their second son.&lt;ref&gt;''Josep Bau i Vergés'' entry at ''ilercavonia'' service&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his early education in Colegio de San Pedro Apóstol of the Hermanos de las Escuelas Cristianas in Tortosa,&lt;ref&gt;Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; the young Joaquín obtained his bachillerato in [[:es:Colegio La Salle Bonanova|Colegio de la Bonanova de los Hermanos de La Salle]] in [[Barcelona]],&lt;ref&gt;Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; to complete military service in Regimiento de guarnición of [[Tarragona]] in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Encouraged by his father, he passed commercial [[broker]] exams and rose to president of Junta Central de Corredores de Commercio de España in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933 he commenced law studies as unenrolled student and graduated from Faculty of Law of [[University of Valencia|Universidad de Valencia]] in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 23-4&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920 Joaquín Bau married Pilar Elisa Carpi Esteller.&lt;ref&gt;''Joaquín Bau Nolla, 1. Conde de Bau'' entry at ''geneallnet'' service, available  [http://geneall.net/es/name/2177898/joaquin-bau-nolla-1-conde-de-bau/ here]&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had 5 children;&lt;ref&gt;''Joaquín Bau Nolla, 1. Conde de Bau entry'' at ''geneallnet''&lt;/ref&gt; the oldest son Joaquín as a 16-year-old volunteered to the Carlist [[requeté]] unit, survived the [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]]&lt;ref&gt;Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; and later became an engineer; José Luis served in the army as a lieutenant colonel and military judge, while Fernando practiced as a lawyer and a conservative politician. Between 1967 and 1977 he served in the Francoist [[Cortes Españolas|Cortes]];&lt;ref&gt;See the official Cortes service available [http://www.congreso.es/portal/page/portal/Congreso/Congreso/SDocum/ArchCon/SDHistoDipu/SDIndHistDip?_piref73_1340024_73_1340023_1340023.next_page=/wc/servidorCGI&amp;CMD=VERLST&amp;BASE=DIPH&amp;FMT=DIPHXLDA.fmt&amp;DOCS=1-25&amp;DOCORDER=FIFO&amp;OPDEF=Y&amp;QUERY=%2813190%29.NDIP. here]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1991 he published ''Crònica de veinte años. 1957-1977''.&lt;ref&gt;Compare abebooks service, available [http://www.abebooks.com/Cr%C3%B3nica-veinte-a%C3%B1os-1957-1977-Bau-Carpi/7915667420/bd here]&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Joaquín's paternal grandfather was a [[Liberal Party (Spain, 1880)|Liberal]]&lt;ref&gt;''Miquel Bau i Isern'' entry at ''ilercavonia'' service&lt;/ref&gt; his father was already reported as [[Traditionalism (Spain)|Traditionalist]]&lt;ref&gt;Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; and it was in his footsteps that Joaquín followed. As a youngster and teenager Bau engaged in local Traditionalist juvenile organisations. He became head of the Tortosa section of Requeté, a formation established in 1909 as a sporting and outdoor grouping for the Carlist youth.&lt;ref&gt;Monserrat Cavaller 2001, pp. 24-5&lt;/ref&gt; He seemed particularly fond of social and charity initiatives, organising Christmas for the poor, working in Patronato Escolar Obrero de la Sagrada Familia and co-founding Sindicatos Católicos Obreros.&lt;ref&gt;Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1920s he already emerged as a dynamic local politician. Once [[Primo de Rivera]] replaced the liberal [[Restoration (Spain)|restauración]] with dictatorship, Bau enthusiastically engaged in the nascent primoderiverista structures; in 1924 he co-founded the Tortosa branch of [[Spanish Patriotic Union|Unión Patriótica]] and became its jefe provincial.&lt;ref&gt;Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period called "Bauisme" in the history of Tortosa,&lt;ref&gt;Joan Sabaté Borràs, ''Els Ajuntaments republicans i els anys del Bauisme (1915 - 1930)'', [in:] ''Cent anys de crònica de Tortosa des del Centre de Comerç'', Tortosa 2001, {{ISBN|846072851X}}, pp. 77-85&lt;/ref&gt; in 1925 Bau was unanimously elected mayor of the city,&lt;ref&gt;Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; re-elected in 1928 and holding the post until 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; His contribution was multifold; during 5 years the Bau-led [[ayuntamiento]] executed the plan of public works, consisting of modernization of city streets, refurbishment of public schools and hospitals and setting up regular fire brigade services.&lt;ref&gt;Monserrat Cavaller 2001, pp. 29-30&lt;/ref&gt; He inaugurated [[Instituto Nacional de Segunda Ensenanza]] and [[Escuela de Trabajo]],&lt;ref&gt;Salvadó Poy 2010, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; expanded local railway line and enhanced the county road network.&lt;ref&gt;Monserrat Cavaller 2001, pp. 30, 39-40&lt;/ref&gt; Much of his activity was about tackling [[Ebro]]-related issues, like floods, navigation, bridges or land re-cultivation.&lt;ref&gt;Monserrat Cavaller 2001, pp. 30-31&lt;/ref&gt; Largely successful and sort of celebrated by [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|Alfonso de Borbón]] and the dictator as one of the youngest mayors,&lt;ref&gt;Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; he nevertheless failed in his attempt to elevate Tortosa - since 1833 part of the [[Tarragona province]] - to the provincial capital range, the new unit to be carved out from these of Tarragona, [[Castellón Province|Castellón]] and [[Teruel Province|Teruel]].&lt;ref&gt;Monserrat Cavaller 2001, pp. 40, 45&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:FFR.98.4.JPG|thumbnail|Bau as alcalde (1st from L), 1925]]
Though dictatorship was initially welcomed by the Carlists as a stepping stone towards a Traditionalist monarchy, in 1925 the claimant [[Jaime, Duke of Madrid|Don Jaime]] switched to opposition. Bau decided not to follow suit and went on contributing to the regime; in literature he is usually listed along [[Víctor Pradera Larumbe|Victor Pradera]] and [[Esteban de Bilbao Eguía|Esteban Bilbao]] as one of those Carlists who abandoned their king and joined the primoderiverista version of the [[Alfonsism|Alfonsine]] monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Vallverdú i Martí, ''El Carlisme Català Durant La Segona República Espanyola 1931-1936'', Barcelona 2008, {{ISBN|9788478260805}}, p. 18, Jordi Canal i Morell, ''El carlismo: dos siglos de contrarrevolución en España'', Madrid 2000, {{ISBN|8420639478}}, pp. 285-6&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927 he was appointed to the quasi-parliament, [[:es:Asamblea Nacional Consultiva|Asamblea Nacional Consultiva]], standing as representative of Organizaciones provinciales de Unión Patriótica&lt;ref&gt;see official Cortes service available [http://www.congreso.es/portal/page/portal/Congreso/Congreso/Iniciativas?_piref73_2148295_73_1335437_1335437.next_page=/wc/servidorCGI&amp;CMD=VERLST&amp;BASE=DIPH&amp;FMT=DIPHXD1S.fmt&amp;DOCS=1-1&amp;DOCORDER=FIFO&amp;OPDEF=Y&amp;NUM1=&amp;DES1=&amp;QUERY=%2813200%29.NDIP. here]&lt;/ref&gt; and representative of the Ayuntamientos;&lt;ref&gt;See official Cortes service available [http://www.congreso.es/portal/page/portal/Congreso/Congreso/Iniciativas?_piref73_2148295_73_1335437_1335437.next_page=/wc/servidorCGI&amp;CMD=VERLST&amp;BASE=DIPH&amp;FMT=DIPHXD1S.fmt&amp;DOCS=2-2&amp;DOCORDER=FIFO&amp;OPDEF=Y&amp;NUM1=&amp;DES1=&amp;QUERY=%2813200%29.NDIP here].&lt;/ref&gt; in the chamber he became one of the youngest members. He kept supporting the dictator by staging welcome celebrations in Tortosa and organizing manifestations of tortosinos in Madrid in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Monserrat Cavaller 2001, pp. 34-5&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929 Bau was re-elected jefe of the local Unión Patriótica, engaged in [[:es:Somatén|Somatén]],&lt;ref&gt;Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; animated the youth branch named Juventud Patriótica&lt;ref&gt;Monserrat Cavaller 2001, pp. 38-9&lt;/ref&gt; and until 1930s financed a local Tortosa periodical, ''Unión Patriótica''.&lt;ref&gt;Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; He is deemed responsible for 1929 expulsion from the city of [[:es:Marcelino Domingo|Marcelino Domingo]], at that time a [[Republicanism in Spain|Republican]] activist in serious health condition.&lt;ref&gt;Josep Sànchez i Cervelló (ed.), ''El republicanisme a les Terres de l'Ebre'', Tarragona 2007, {{ISBN|8461165705}}, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

Bau ceased as Tortosa mayor in 1930;&lt;ref&gt;Sànchez i Cervelló 2007, p. 28; there are no details provided on termination of Bau's service as mayor&lt;/ref&gt; in 1931 he was accused of financial irregularities, though none of the charges raised has been concluded.&lt;ref&gt;Monserrat Cavaller 2001, pp. 47-50&lt;/ref&gt; As three Traditionalist branches united in 1932 Bau resumed his service to the legitimist king rejoining the Carlist organization, [[:es:Comunión Tradicionalista|Comunión Tradicionalista]]. Within its structures he was heading the local Tortosa Requeté;&lt;ref&gt;Vallverdú 2008, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; as member of the Tarragona branch he had to accept leadership of the provincial jefe, Juan Maria Roma.&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Manuel Moral Roncal, ''La cuestión religiosa en la Segunda República española. Iglesia y carlismo'', Madrid, 2009, {{ISBN|9788497429054}}, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Spanish general election, 1933|1933 elections]] he represented Carlism within the local Tarragonese [[Unió Ciutadana]] alliance&lt;ref&gt;Vallverdú 2008, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; and was successfully elected.&lt;ref&gt;see 1933 entry at the official Cortes service, available [http://www.congreso.es/portal/page/portal/Congreso/Congreso/Iniciativas?_piref73_2148295_73_1335437_1335437.next_page=/wc/servidorCGI&amp;CMD=VERLST&amp;BASE=DIPH&amp;FMT=DIPHXD1S.fmt&amp;DOCS=3-3&amp;DOCORDER=FIFO&amp;OPDEF=Y&amp;NUM1=&amp;DES1=&amp;QUERY=%2813200%29.NDIP. here]. He was second-last on the Unió Ciutadana list elected, Vallverdú 2008, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, he emerged one of key figures in the [[Levante, Spain|Levantine]] Carlism,&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 18.12.34, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000534141&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt; especially in the comarcas of [[Terres de l'Ebre]],&lt;ref&gt;Vallverdú 2008, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; though following the death of [[Jaime Chicharro Sánchez-Guió|Jaime Chicharro]] also in Castellón.&lt;ref&gt;"Chicharro ha muerto. Viva Bau! Ya tenemos jefe", quoted after Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

Voicing his support for the Catalan identity&lt;ref&gt;"Cataluna, señores diputados, siente y quiere un regimen de autonomia", quoted after Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; Bau has nevertheless opposed the adopted [[:ca:Estatut d'Autonomia de Catalunya de 1932|autonomous statute]]&lt;ref&gt;''Joaquim Bau i Nolla'' at ''Gran Enciclopédia Catalana'' online service, available [http://www.enciclopedia.cat/EC-GEC-0008374.xml#.UwTaqWJ5PIA here]&lt;/ref&gt; as irreconcilable with the Spanish raison d'etat and produced by "traidores a su Patria y a su honor".&lt;ref&gt;Vallverdú 2008, pp. 202-3&lt;/ref&gt; He demanded its derogation&lt;ref&gt;according to Bau, the autonomy served "el mas duro de los centralismos y la mas fuerte de la tiranias", probably a reference to the unitarian nature of Catalan autonomy, neglecting the provincial differences, quoted after Vallverdú 2008, pp. 202-3&lt;/ref&gt; and replacement with a new autonomous statute, constructed along Traditionalist lines and properly reflecting the genuine personality of Catalonia.&lt;ref&gt;Vallverdú 2008, pp. 202-3, Monserrat Cavaller 2001, pp. 54-5&lt;/ref&gt; He sided with [[Francesc Cambó]] against the Catalan left-wing autonomism&lt;ref&gt;Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; and supported Catalan landowners in the notorious [[Catalan Leases Act]] case.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Blinkhorn, ''Carlism and Crisis in Spain 1931-1939'', Cambridge 2008, {{ISBN|9780521207294}}, 9780521086349, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; He also encouraged new Christian syndicates of the Tarragona province, confederated in [[Agrupacion Gremial de Trabajadores]].&lt;ref&gt;Bau claimed he was the founder of the unions, Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 78; other sources point to [[Tomàs Caylà]] as their moving spirit, see Joan Guinovart i Escarré, ''Tomàs Caylà, un home de la terra'', Valls 1997, {{ISBN|8492147679}}, 9788492147670&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1934 he was active mounting local opposition to the [[October 1934 Revolution|revolutionary sway]];&lt;ref&gt;Sànchez i Cervelló 2007, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; his close collaborator, [[:es:José María Sentís Simeón|Jose Maria Sentis Simeon]], co-ordinated action against the rebels in the province and was later appointed governors' delegate for Public Order.&lt;ref&gt;Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935 Bau arranged for [[Guardia de Asalto]] detachment to be stationed in Tortosa.&lt;ref&gt;Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:LLO.98.13.JPG|thumbnail|150px|[[José Calvo Sotelo|Calvo Sotelo]]]] 
By many Carlists Bau was viewed with suspicion. This was due to his enthusiasm when engaging in alliance talks with the Alfonsinos&lt;ref&gt;Compare Vallverdú 2008, pp. 278, 281, Canal i Morell 2000, p. 318. Bau did not take part in common Catalan Right-wing initiatives, as he is not listed in José Fernando Mota Muñoz, ''"Precursores de la unificación": el España Club y el voluntariado español, una experiencia unitaria de la extrema derecha barcelonesa (1935-1936)'', [in:] ''Historia y politica'' 28 (2012), pp. 273-303&lt;/ref&gt; and personal friendship with their leader, [[José Calvo Sotelo]];&lt;ref&gt;Blinkhorn 2008, p. 190, Vallverdú 2008, p. 192, Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 105. In 1935, after the death of Bau's father, the family moved to Madrid; as Calvo's close friend Bau and his family lived in the very same building, Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; though new Traditionalist jefe [[Manuel Fal Conde|Manuel Fal]] approached [[Bloque Nacional (Spanish alliance of 1930s)|Bloque Nacional]] as tactical option to be eventually abandoned, Bau was suspected of pushing for a dynastical compromise. In the spring of 1935 [[Alfonso Carlos, Duke of San Jaime|Don Alfonso Carlos]] and Fal considered Bau's activity in the Bloque intolerable and semi-rebellious.&lt;ref&gt;Valverdú 2008, pp. 190-192. In December 1935 Bau was notably absent during a meeting of Fal and the Catalan executive, Valverdú 2008 p. 193. On the other hand, Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 58-59 claims that when Fal left the regional Catalan gathering in June 1935 it was Joaquín Bau taking over the presidency&lt;/ref&gt; Also present-day scholars name his position as "conspiration",&lt;ref&gt;Vallverdú 2008, p. 281&lt;/ref&gt; while others claim that he was loyal to Calvo rather than to Traditionalism.&lt;ref&gt;Colin M. Winston, ''Workers and the Right in Spain, 1900-1936'', Princeton 2014, {{ISBN|9780691612164}}, p. 305&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was allowed to speak at massive Carlist meetings in [[Poblet]]&lt;ref&gt;in June 1935, Valverdú 2008, p. 267; Bau claimed credit for staging the event, noting only that "mis amigos los señores Bru y Caylá, que tan bien me han ayudado y han cooperado a la realización de la gran concentración do Poblet", see ''El Siglo Futuro'' 20.06.35, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000546803&amp;page=2 here], see also Monserrat Cavaller 2001, pp. 57-8&lt;/ref&gt; and at [[Santa Maria de Montserrat Abbey|Montserrat]];&lt;ref&gt;in October 1935, Valverdú 2008, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; he was also appointed to the Carlist Council of Economy.&lt;ref&gt;In the spring of 1935; the council was an 8-member body called to manage Carlist financial issues, Valverdú 2008, p. 276&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the [[Spanish general election, 1936|1936 elections]] Bau advocated the strategy of a [[Electoral Carlism (Second Republic)|broad Right-wing alliance]],&lt;ref&gt;Valverdú 2008, p. 286&lt;/ref&gt; an option which has never materialized; himself he competed on the list of [[Front Català d'Ordre]]&lt;ref&gt;Josep Santesmases i Ollé, ''De les eleccions del 16 de febrer de 1936 a l'entrada dels "nacionals". Notícies de les actes municipals de Vila-rodona'', [in:] ''La Resclosa'' 7 (2003), p. 102; Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; and was elected from Tarragona.&lt;ref&gt;See 1936 Bau entry at the official Cortes service, available [http://www.congreso.es/portal/page/portal/Congreso/Congreso/Iniciativas?_piref73_2148295_73_1335437_1335437.next_page=/wc/servidorCGI&amp;CMD=VERLST&amp;BASE=DIPH&amp;FMT=DIPHXD1S.fmt&amp;DOCS=4-4&amp;DOCORDER=FIFO&amp;OPDEF=Y&amp;NUM1=&amp;DES1=&amp;QUERY=%2813200%29.NDIP. here] Bau could have boasted a symbolic success, since he was the sole monarchist deputy from all the Levantine provinces, Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the [[Popular Front (Spain)|Frente Popular]] triumph was declared Bau and Calvo visited the prime minister [[Manuel Portela Valladares|Portela Valladares]] urging him to call the military and rule by decree; this was probably the most charged moment in his entire career.&lt;ref&gt;Monserrat Cavaller 2001, pp. 93-4, Paul Preston, ''Franco. A biography'', London 2011, {{ISBN|9780006862109}}, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; Once [[Lorenzo Maria Alier]] resigned as Carlist Catalan jefe in February 1936 one of the options considered was a triumvirate including Bau,&lt;ref&gt;other members of the triumvirate suggested were Joaquin Roma and Joaquin Gomis; this proposal was put forward by the Carlist provincial Girona council, Vallverdú 2008, p. 300&lt;/ref&gt; but eventually it was [[Tomàs Caylà]] appointed the new regional leader.

==Commissioner==
[[File:JoséSanjurjo.jpg|160px|thumbnail|left|[[José Sanjurjo|general Sanjurjo]]]]
Though until the summer of 1936 Bau was active in the Cortes,&lt;ref&gt;sponsoring a motion to make Ebro navigable around [[Flix]] on June 26, 1936, Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; he was heavily engaged in anti-Republican conspiracy, serving as a Carlist link to [[Renovación Española]].&lt;ref&gt;Blinkhorn 2008, pp. 238, 247, Vallverdú 2008, p. 310. Possibly Bau has even communicated with Franco, at that time stationed time on Canary Islands; Bau's personal archive contains a Spanish-English dictionary serving as key to encrypted correspondence with Franco, Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Following the death of Calvo Sotelo he travelled to [[Portugal]]&lt;ref&gt;he travelled by train on July 15 and narrowly escaped detention quoting his parliamentarian immunity, Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; to negotiate details of the rebellion with [[José Sanjurjo]], personally witnessing the crash of general's aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Blinkhorn 2008, p. 354; one of the factors usually quoted as cause of the crash was overloading of the small aircraft, as Sanjurjo insisted on taking his massive luggage containing uniforms and other garment; Bau lent Sanjurjo his sombrero, collected from the crash site and returned to Bau by Sanjurjo's widow 30 years later, Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Since Bau was originally scheduled to communicate uprising orders to requeté units in southern Catalonia, his departure impaired Carlist insurgent structures in Terres de l'Ebre.&lt;ref&gt;Vallverdú 2008, p. 332&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the [[Spanish coup of July 1936|hostilities broke out]] he returned from Portugal to [[Burgos]] in the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist zone]].

Early September 1936&lt;ref&gt;on September 4, 1936, Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; the supreme governing body of the rebels, [[:es:Junta de Defensa Nacional|Junta de Defensa Nacional]], constituted [[Comisión de Industria y Comercio]], a substitute for Ministry of Economy. Bau, considered by [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] one of the more collaborative Carlists,&lt;ref&gt;Blinkhorn 2008, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; was appointed one of its seven members;&lt;ref&gt;Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; his high nomination was allegedly related to ability to arrange finance through Catalan contacts who had fled abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Richards, ''A Time of Silence: Civil War and the Culture of Repression in Franco's Spain, 1936-1945'', Cambridge 2006, {{ISBN|9780521025065}}, p. 107; Paul Preston, ''Coming of the Spanish Civil War'', Routledge 2003, {{ISBN|9781134923274}}, p. 278, claims that within a "motley band of aristocrats, diplomats and politicians" Joaquín Bau "played a vital role in organizing the purchase of arms and other supplies, propaganda and financial assistance for the rebel cause", claiming also that Bau was Franco's friend&lt;/ref&gt; A month later&lt;ref&gt;On October 7, 1936, Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; the newly established [[:es:Junta Técnica del Estado|Junta Técnica del Estado]] set up [[Comisión de Industria, Comercio y Abastos]] with Bau appointed its president,&lt;ref&gt;Monserrat Cavaller 2001, pp. 123-124&lt;/ref&gt; the de facto minister of economy in the Nationalist zone. As head of 7 commissions formed and one of 16 members of the Junta Técnica, he rapidly grew to top Nationalist executive.&lt;ref&gt;Carlos Pulpillo Leiva, ''Orígenes del Franquismo: la construcción de la "Nueva España" (1936–1941)'', [PhD thesis], Madrid 2013, p. 767&lt;/ref&gt;

Bau's primary task was to keep production running and to build the gold deposit reserve of the Nationalists;&lt;ref&gt;Monserrat Cavaller 2001, pp. 126-7&lt;/ref&gt; he was subsequently involved in currency reform, first organizing the stamping of pre-War notes and then arranging for a new Nationalist [[Spanish peseta|peseta]] to be printed in [[Nazi Germany|Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Monserrat Cavaller 2001, pp. 128-130&lt;/ref&gt; The next objective was to control foreign trade and direct the flow of deficient components accordingly, which was attempted by numerous regulatory means. At that time Bau considered himself an advocate of the "directed" economy;&lt;ref&gt;Monserrat Cavaller 2001, pp. 130-134, 156-157. Bau spoke in favor of rapid industrialization, declaring respect for private property, though within the limits of social usefulness, Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; as an economist he was considered a disciple of Calvo Sotelo.&lt;ref&gt;Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; Heavily involved in dealings with semi-official Nazi companies, [[Sociedad Hispano-Marroquí de Transportes|HISMA]] and [[ROWAK]],&lt;ref&gt;involving also talks on German role in the Spanish mining industry, Christian Leitz, ''Economic Relations Between Nazi Germany and Franco's Spain: 1936-1945'', Oxford 1996, 0198206453, 9780198206453, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; he objected to increase of German stakes,&lt;ref&gt;Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; though key decisions were probably beyond his capacity.&lt;ref&gt;Monserrat Cavaller 2001, pp. 139-145&lt;/ref&gt; He hugely contributed to the Nationalist logistics by closing international deals covering 600 [[Fiat]] cars and 1,000 [[Studebaker]] chassis.&lt;ref&gt;Monserrat Cavaller 2001, pp. 146, 234-5&lt;/ref&gt;

Bau's relations with Carlism are not clear. According to one source, he took advantage of his position by procuring arms designed specifically for the requetés;&lt;ref&gt;Javier Ugarte Tellería, ''El carlismo en la guerra del 36. La formación de un cuasi-estado nacional-corporativo y foral en la zona vasco-navarra'', [in:] ''Historia contemporánea'' 38 (2009), p. 67. The author claims that Bau procured arms for the Pamplona-based Junta Central Carlista de Guerra de Navarra; the body assumed a semi-rebellious stance pushing for unconditional collaboration with Franco against the cautious policy adopted for the official Carlist executive, the Burgos-based Junta Nacional Carlista de Guerra&lt;/ref&gt; according to another, starting late 1936 he assisted in organization of [[Terç de Requetès de la Mare de Déu de Montserrat]],&lt;ref&gt;Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 206-208&lt;/ref&gt; the requeté battalion consisting of Carlist refugees from Catalonia. On the other hand, he is not known to have protested against Franco's measures against Manuel Fal;&lt;ref&gt;Maximiliano Garcia Venero, ''Historia de la Unificacion'', Madrid 1970, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; even detailed studies dealing with amalgamation of Carlism within Francoism in 1936-7 do not mention Bau,&lt;ref&gt;compare Mercedes Peñalba Sotorrío, ''Entre la boina roja y la camisa azul. La integración del carlismo en Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las JONS (1936-1942)'', Estella 2013,{{ISBN|978-84-235-3365-7}}, Juan Carlos Peñas Bernaldo de Quirós, ''El Carlismo, la República y la Guerra Civil (1936-1937). De la conspiración a la unificación'', Madrid 1996, {{ISBN|8487863523}}, 9788487863523&lt;/ref&gt; which suggests that at that time he was already hardly involved in Traditionalism. It seems that he unconditionally accepted [[:es:Decreto de Unificación|Decreto de Unificación]] and was leading Catalan Carlists co-operating with Franco;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Vallverdú Martí, ''La metamorfosi del carlisme català: del "Déu, Pàtria i Rei" a l'Assamblea de Catalunya (1936-1975)'', Montserrt 2014, {{ISBN|9788498837261}}, p. 50; the author claims that Franco intended to use Bau as counterweight to Fal&lt;/ref&gt; some scholars compare the role he played in Catalonia to the role played by [[Tomás Domínguez Arévalo]] in Vasco-Navarrese area.&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Martorell Pérez, ''La continuidad ideológica del carlismo tras la Guerra Civil'' [PhD thesis], Valencia 2009, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; Considered rebellious by Manuel Fal and the new regent-claimant [[Prince Xavier of Bourbon-Parma|Don Javier]], at an unspecified date he was expulsed from Carlism.&lt;ref&gt;Vallverdú 2014, p. 42; the author does not give exact date and mentions the expulsion when discussing late 1936 events&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcast==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 121-1010, Berlin-Lichterfelde, Suner, Himmler.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Ramón Serrano Suñer]], 1940]]
Bau's influence started to decline once [[Ramón Serrano Suñer]] arrived in Burgos. Upon arrival he was already averse towards Bau as late 1936 Franco decided that it would be the family of Bau, not the family of Serrano, to be exchanged with the Republicans for the family of general [[José Miaja|Miaja]].&lt;ref&gt;Bau's left his wife and children on July 15, 1936 in Benicasim, when leaving for Portugal; they were detained and kept in custody by the Republicans and exchanged in December 1936, Garcia Venero 1970, p. 47, Monserrat Cavaller 2001, pp. 183, 334. One of the exchanged, Bau's oldest son Joaquin, immediately volunteered to the requeté. Two Serrano's brothers were in the meantime executed by the Republicans&lt;/ref&gt; The animosity grew during 1937, when Bau opposed totalitarian designs pursued by Franco's cuñado.&lt;ref&gt;Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; When the first regular Francoist government was created early 1938 Bau was not even considered.&lt;ref&gt;Bau was released as president of Comision de Industria on January 30, 1938, Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring of 1938 he left Burgos, settling in [[San Sebastián]].&lt;ref&gt;Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with many Catalan industry tycoons taking refuge in the [[Gipuzkoa]]n capital, Bau engaged in plans to re-create regional economic institutions once Catalonia would be retaken by the Nationalist troops. He was offered presidency of [[:ca:Institut Agrícola Català de Sant Isidre|l'Institut Catala de Sant Isidre]], the regional agricultural organization, but declined quoting his hostile relations with Serrano.&lt;ref&gt;Vallverdú 2014, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the internal [[Falangist]] document denounced him as one of the leaders of local "plutocratas y alta burguesia" who conspired against the national-syndicalist state.&lt;ref&gt;Vallverdu 2014, p. 68, Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

Bau kept supporting the [[Terç de Requetès de la Mare de Déu de Montserrat|Catalan Montserrat battalion]].&lt;ref&gt;since early 1937 Bau was helping Catalan requetés from this tercio to enter military courses enabling promotion to alfereces provisionales; theoretically candidates should have been at least 4 months serving at the frontline, Monserrat Cavaller 2001, pp. 197-8, 200-202&lt;/ref&gt; He remained involved in numerous charity projects, like [[:es:Auxilio Social|Auxilio de Invierno]].&lt;ref&gt;Monserrat Cavaller 2001, pp. 217-218&lt;/ref&gt; The most important of Bau's ventures of that period was probably helping the Catalan Republican POWs. Personal acquaintance of officers commanding [[Francoist concentration camps|Campos de Concentración]] and [[Comisíon Clasificadora]],&lt;ref&gt;Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; Bau did his best to release Catalan prisoners and enlist them either in the Carlist tercios or in the Falangist banderas.&lt;ref&gt;Monserrat Cavaller 2001, pp. 224-229&lt;/ref&gt; Following the end of the war he returned to Tortosa, though he is not listed as taking part in the Carlist-Falangist competition for power in Catalonia.&lt;ref&gt;Bau is hardly mentioned in Joan Maria Thomas, ''Falangistes i carlins catalans a la «zona nacional» durant la Guerra civil (1936-1939)'', [in:] ''Recerques: Història, economia i cultura'' 31 (1995), pp. 7-18&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:RequeteViladot.JPG|thumbnail|160px|''S. M. Javier I'', 1959]]
Bau was not invited to the victory parade of May 19, 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; Though sidetracked in great national politics, he remained engaged in clandestine and extremely sensitive Francoist business schemes. In 1941-42 he managed the deal with [[Nazi]] [[Oberkommando der Marine]], supervising construction of 20 wooden ships intended to supply [[Afrika Korps|German troops]] fighting the [[North African Campaign (World War II)|British in Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Leitz 1996, p. 145. The delivery was delayed as Spanish shipyards proved inefficient and because the British, who got wind of the scheme due to increased traffic of wood from Spanish Guinea, intervened with Franco. Eventually only 2 ships entered the German service as late as 1944.&lt;/ref&gt; Later on he kept exchanging courteous but purely formal correspondence with Franco.&lt;ref&gt;or rather with his secretariat, Monserrat Cavaller 2001, pp. 337-338&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1940s Bau dedicated himself to family issues, various Catholic organizations and business; he became the first post-war president of Banco de Tortosa&lt;ref&gt;Llorente 2005, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt; and later multiplied his wealth by trading shares of the bank,&lt;ref&gt;''Joaquim Bau i Nolla'' at ''Gran Enciclopédia Catalana'' online service&lt;/ref&gt; going on also with the inherited Aceites Bau business.&lt;ref&gt;he transferred the company from Tortosa to Madrid in 1942, Salvadó Poy 2010, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Privately he pursued his interest in [[organ music]].&lt;ref&gt;Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 235&lt;/ref&gt;

Bau led one of 3 competing Traditionalist Tarragona factions, namely the one opposing [[Carloctavismo|Carloctavistas]]&lt;ref&gt;at least temporarily; one work claims that Bau supported Carlos VIII, Iker Cantabrana Morras, ''Lo viejo y lo nuevo: Diputacion-FET de las JONS: la convulsa dinámica política de la "leal" Álava (1938-1943)'', [in:] ''Sancho el Sabio'' 22 (2005), p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Xavier, Duke of Parma and Piacenza|javieristas]] and promoting rapprochement with the Alfonsist claimant, [[Juan de Borbon|Don Juan]].&lt;ref&gt;an internal Falangist document describing Tarragona in the early 1940s divided Carlists into 3 groups: 1) "Una parte bastante considerable está firmemente unida a Falange y la campaña de Carlos VIII ha aumentado bastante la fracción. Son los Tradicionalistas del grupo auténtico que siguió a Caylá. Gente sana y ruda que constituye un grupo excelente por su españolismo decidido"; 2) "Otra parte del carlismo autentico, algo superior en número al anterior, forma el núcleo rebelde. Su jefe provincial es un pobre diablo de Reus llamado Sugrañes [...] pero su jefatura no la acatan mis que en su pueblo y en alguna localidad vecina. Se mueven dentro del Falcondismo y andan de capa caida" 3) "existe el núcleo que sigue a la trilogia Bau, Sentis, Prat. Los carlistas puros están en contra porque les acusan de haberse vendido al juanismo franquisme tarragona". In another paragraph of the same document Bau is presented as leading "una fracción moderada frente al integrismo del Sr. Caylá de Valls", quoted after Joan Maria Thomàs, ''El Franquisme des de dins: un informe sobre Tarragona'', [in:] ''Butlletí de la Societat Catalana d'Estudis Històrics'' 9 (1998), pp. 152-153&lt;/ref&gt; The Tortosa javierista Carlists distributed leaflets presenting him as Francoist traitor who ignored the lot of requetés detained by the Francoist administration.&lt;ref&gt;"Los carlistas hemos visto con indignación cómo eran borrados y ridiculizados nuestros símbolos queridos y servía de irrisión y burla a todo el mundo. La Tradición ha pasado por muchas vicisitudes pero jamás nos habían podido acusar de cobardes como hacen ahora a pesar del sacrificio del Requeté. ¿Quiénes son los culpables de lo ocurrido? ¿Dónde están los Prat, los Sentís, los Bau?", quoted after Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; He apparently acknowledged that a future kingdom must encompass Francoist structures.&lt;ref&gt;Monserrat Cavaller 2001, pp. 311-319. In 1951 he wrote: "La Monarquía no puede ser conservadora, ni de "revancha". Ha de recoger lo social en su justo medio y estudiar lo corporativo y sindical", quoted after Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 321&lt;/ref&gt; His private papers from mid-1950s suggest that Bau, though with hesitation, tended to support what seemed a long-distance Franco's plan for crowning prince [[Juan Carlos]].&lt;ref&gt;see his analysis, possibly intended also for some political friends, and dated September 1954; in the document he seems to have accepted that Juan Carlos would be a better option than Don Juan, Monserrat Cavaller 2001, pp. 316-319&lt;/ref&gt; However, when in 1957 he joined the Carlists who abandoned the regent-claimant Don Javier, Bau declared Juan Carlos' father, [[Juan de Borbon|Don Juan]], the legitimate heir&lt;ref&gt;Francisco Javier Caspistegui Gorasurreta, ''El naufragio de las ortodoxias. El carlismo, 1962-1977'', Pamplona 1997; {{ISBN|9788431315641}}, 978843131564, pp. 24-25, Josep Carles Clemente, ''Historia del Carlismo Contemporaneo 1935-1972'', Barcelona 1977, {{ISBN|8425307597}}, 8425307600, p. 299&lt;/ref&gt; and continued to approach him as a king.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. he addressed his 1959 lecture, intended for Don Juan, "por su Majestad el Rey", Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 323; his mid-1960s correspondence with Don Juan contains the "S.M." invocation, see, Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt;

As in mid-1950s Franco shelved totalitarian plans and opted for a hybrid line of development, he started looking for loyal individuals not associated with Falangism; 1958 produced huge turnover of [[:es:Procurador en Cortes|procuradores]] nominated to the quasi-parliament, [[Cortes Españolas]].&lt;ref&gt;Stanley G. Payne, ''The Franco Regime'', Madison 2011, {{ISBN|0299110745}}, 9780299110741, p. 517&lt;/ref&gt; The dictator appointed Bau member of [[National Council of the Movement|Consejo Nacional of the Falange]],&lt;ref&gt;Bau entered the VIII Consejo, Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 243&lt;/ref&gt; which automatically ensured the Cortes mandate.&lt;ref&gt;see the 1958 record at the official Cortes service, available [http://www.congreso.es/portal/page/portal/Congreso/Congreso/Iniciativas?_piref73_2148295_73_1335437_1335437.next_page=/wc/servidorCGI&amp;CMD=VERLST&amp;BASE=DIPH&amp;FMT=DIPHXD1S.fmt&amp;DOCS=5-5&amp;DOCORDER=FIFO&amp;OPDEF=Y&amp;NUM1=&amp;DES1=&amp;QUERY=%2813200%29.NDIP. here]&lt;/ref&gt; He got his seat confirmed in 5 successive legislatives,&lt;ref&gt;either as member of Consejo Nacional, or as personal Jefe del Estado appointee or as member of the highest state bodies&lt;/ref&gt; appointed also in 1961,&lt;ref&gt;see the 1961 record at the official Cortes service, available  [http://www.congreso.es/portal/page/portal/Congreso/Congreso/Iniciativas?_piref73_2148295_73_1335437_1335437.next_page=/wc/servidorCGI&amp;CMD=VERLST&amp;BASE=DIPH&amp;FMT=DIPHXD1S.fmt&amp;DOCS=6-6&amp;DOCORDER=FIFO&amp;OPDEF=Y&amp;NUM1=&amp;DES1=&amp;QUERY=%2813200%29.NDIP. here]&lt;/ref&gt; 1964,&lt;ref&gt;see the 1964 record at the official Cortes service, available  [http://www.congreso.es/portal/page/portal/Congreso/Congreso/Iniciativas?_piref73_2148295_73_1335437_1335437.next_page=/wc/servidorCGI&amp;CMD=VERLST&amp;BASE=DIPH&amp;FMT=DIPHXD1S.fmt&amp;DOCS=7-7&amp;DOCORDER=FIFO&amp;OPDEF=Y&amp;NUM1=&amp;DES1=&amp;QUERY=%2813200%29.NDIP. here]&lt;/ref&gt; 1967&lt;ref&gt;see the 1967 record at the official Cortes service, available [http://www.congreso.es/portal/page/portal/Congreso/Congreso/Iniciativas?_piref73_2148295_73_1335437_1335437.next_page=/wc/servidorCGI&amp;CMD=VERLST&amp;BASE=DIPH&amp;FMT=DIPHXD1S.fmt&amp;DOCS=9-9&amp;DOCORDER=FIFO&amp;OPDEF=Y&amp;NUM1=&amp;DES1=&amp;QUERY=%2813200%29.NDIP. here]&lt;/ref&gt; and 1971.&lt;ref&gt;see the 1971 record at the official Cortes service, available  [http://www.congreso.es/portal/page/portal/Congreso/Congreso/Iniciativas?_piref73_2148295_73_1335437_1335437.next_page=/wc/servidorCGI&amp;CMD=VERLST&amp;BASE=DIPH&amp;FMT=DIPHXD1S.fmt&amp;DOCS=11-11&amp;DOCORDER=FIFO&amp;OPDEF=Y&amp;NUM1=&amp;DES1=&amp;QUERY=%2813200%29.NDIP. here]&lt;/ref&gt; As his career was re-launched, Bau kept assuming higher and higher posts.&lt;ref&gt;Bau was also gaining importance within Falange/Movimiento; in 1964 he was appointed member of [[Comisión Permanente del Consejo Nacional del Movimiento]], a 10-15 member executive body, Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 243; in 1967 he was appointed permanent (until 75 years of age) member of the Consejo; in 1971, shortly before completing 75 years, Bau stepped down as member of the Concejo, Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 244. He served also in some state-controlled business executive bodies like [[FEVE|Ferrocarriles de Vía Estrecha FEVE]], the narrow-gauge state railway company, see ''BOE'' 24.01.69, available [http://www.boe.es/boe/dias/1969/01/24/pdfs/A01133-01133.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963 he started leading various parliamentary committees,&lt;ref&gt;e. g. Comisión de Leyes Fundamentales, Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; formally nominated president of the internal affairs committee in 1964,&lt;ref&gt;Comisión de Gobernación, Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 249&lt;/ref&gt; president of Leyes Fundamentales committee in 1965&lt;ref&gt;Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 262&lt;/ref&gt; and then other committees working on new constitutional laws. In 1965 he was appointed president of [[:es:Consejo de Estado de España|Consejo de Estado]],&lt;ref&gt;Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 283, ''BOE'' 30.10.65, available [http://www.boe.es/boe/dias/1965/10/30/pdfs/A14853-14853.pdf here]. He was re-appointed in 1971, ''BOE'' 09.11.71, available [http://www.boe.es/boe/dias/1971/11/09/pdfs/A17965-17965.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; a body adding to extreme complexity of Francoist power structures and being part of Franco's recipe for political balance.&lt;ref&gt;see massive statistics on its sessions and work, Monserrat Cavaller 2001, pp. 287-8&lt;/ref&gt; The appointment produced his nomination to [[:es:Consejo del Reino|Consejo del Reino]],&lt;ref&gt;''BOE'' 06.08.70, available [http://www.boe.es/boe/dias/1970/08/06/pdfs/A12558-12558.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; another body with some competencies related to monarchical establishments.&lt;ref&gt;Payne 2011, pp. 372-3&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970 Bau was nominated its vice-president.&lt;ref&gt;Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 310, see ''BOE'' 06.09.70, available [http://www.boe.es/boe/dias/1970/08/06/pdfs/A12558-12558.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; As one of the regime's highest dignitaries in the late 1960s he became one of faces of Francoism.&lt;ref&gt;also in the newly born audiovisual media like TV, see for instance Radiotelevision Española service available [http://www.rtve.es/filmoteca/no-do/not-1193/1469179/ here] (starting 1:44)&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before his death he was made [[:es:Condado de Bau|Conde de Bau]].&lt;ref&gt;''BOE'' 21.05.73, available [http://www.boe.es/boe/dias/1973/05/21/pdfs/A10181-10181.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Bau's rise from political non-existence to president of Consejo de Estado in just 7 years was possible as he proved acceptable to most groupings competing for power within Francoism. Deprived of own political background, he posed no threat and might have been considered as sympathetic to their cause by Carlists, monarchists, [[:es:Planes de Desarrollo de España|technocrats]] (by virtue of his business activities and friendship with [[Laureano López Rodó|López Rodó]]&lt;ref&gt;Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 335&lt;/ref&gt;), the Church and even the military (maintained friendly relations with many high-ranking generals); it was only the Falangist syndicalists that he remained at odds with.&lt;ref&gt;see his 1966 complaints about Solis, Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 344&lt;/ref&gt; Bau, always impeccably elegant,&lt;ref&gt;Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; boosted his career by oratory skills and non-belligerent,&lt;ref&gt;"era amigo de todos", quoted after Monserrat Cavaller 2001, pp. 279-280&lt;/ref&gt; silky presiding style in numerous bodies of the regime,&lt;ref&gt;"el señor Bau tiene una firme flexibilidad, una caballera blanca como una aureola y una amable ironía de gran señor", opinion of one of the contemporaries quoted after Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 260; "empezaba a hablar sin saber lo que iba a decir", Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 279&lt;/ref&gt; excelling in conflict management and demonstrating sort of impartiality, combined with perfect loyalty to Franco.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. he is not even mentioned in Mercedes Vázquez de Prada, ''La oposición monárquica y su aproximación al franquismo a partir de 1954'', [in:] ''Memoria y civilización: anuario de historia'', 13 (2010), pp. 35-53; a biographer describes his stance as "lealtad hasta el extreme al Caudillo", Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 279&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Juan Carlos de Borbón, Prince of Spain.jpg|160px|thumbnail|[[Juan Carlos I of Spain|''Prince of Spain'']], 1971]]
Bau's own political outlook may be summarised as a watered-down [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]], non-dynastical monarchism based on diehard (marchamartillo) Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt; Following his return to great politics in 1958 he emerged as one of the most prominent monarchists, contributing to shaping of late Francoism in course of works on various key legal structures of the system.&lt;ref&gt;like Ley de Asociaciones, new Ley Orgánica del Estado, Ley Orgánica del Movimiento y de su Consejo Nacional, Ley de la Representación Familiar en Cortes, Ley Sindical, Ley de Libertad Religiosa and successive laws on Plan de Desarrollo Económico y Social, Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 253-280&lt;/ref&gt; Far from political militancy, starting mid-1960s Bau began to press the monarchical cause by advocating adoption of [[:es:Ley Orgánica del Estado|Ley Orgánica]] and [[:es:Príncipe de España|Ley de Designación]].&lt;ref&gt;Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 275, see also his letters to Franco, Monserrat Cavaller 2001, pp. 344-350&lt;/ref&gt; Mocked by some critics as himself the best successor to Franco,&lt;ref&gt;Julian Cerón Ayuso staged a mocked casting for Franco's succession and concluded that "Don Joaquín Bau es mi favorito. Lo tiene todo! Cumple ocho leyes, lleva más de un año preparándose (desde hace más tiempo apuesto yo por él), no cae mal ni bien que es muy importante, ocupa el cargo ideal, es de Tortosa – ciudad perfecta como símbolo" (the last piece was probably a reference to the Francoist Battle of Ebro monument in Tortosa), see filosofia.org service available [http://www.filosofia.org/ave/001/a233.htm here]&lt;/ref&gt; Bau could have considered his efforts crowned when Juan Carlos was officially confirmed as Franco's successor in 1969,&lt;ref&gt;asked by the ''ABC'' correspondent, Bau explained that he supported Ley de Designación because "con ello hago honor a mis convicciones políticas de toda la vida", Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 276&lt;/ref&gt; though as late as 1970 he kept fighting the regentialistas, first headed by [[Agustín Muñoz Grandes|Muñoz Grandez]] and than by [[:es:Alejandro Rodríguez de Valcárcel|Valcárcel]].&lt;ref&gt;Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 337, see his 1970 letter to Franco, denouncing those who intended to take advantage of "inconsciencia o bondada ignorancia del general Muñoz Grandez, los señores republicanos encubiertos y demás compañeros, que ahora pretenden alcanzar con la ayuda de Valcárcel", Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 352&lt;/ref&gt; When in the early 1970s advising Juan Carlos on prospective course to be adopted, he suggested [[:es:Federico Silva Muñoz|Federico Silva Muñoz]] as the man for future.&lt;ref&gt;Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 361&lt;/ref&gt; He retained Catalan identity taking part in a number of regional initiatives and bodies, always perfectly within the limits permitted by the regime.&lt;ref&gt;Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 277&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Joaquín Bau is commemorated by a very short street in Madrid, a parking-lot-plaza in the [[Ferreries district]] of Tortosa (until 2017) and a long backyard drive in the resort town of [[Benicasim]], where the family owns a summer residence purchased by Bau in the 1950s;&lt;ref&gt;named Villa Elisa, see ''La ruta de las villas de Benicassim, un paseo con historia'', [in:] ''enelmundoperdido'' service 08.10.14, available [http://www.enelmundoperdido.com/2014/10/la-ruta-de-las-villas-de-benicassim-un-paseo-con-historia/ here]; see also Beatriz de Rojas, ''Villas de Benicasim'', [in:] ''Antropología – Castellón de la Plana y su entorno'', available [http://mayores.uji.es/blogs/antrop/2012/02/05/1881/ here]&lt;/ref&gt; some of them are subject to various initiatives aiming at purging public space from Francoist&lt;ref&gt;see ''simbologia.cat'' service available [http://simbologia.cat.mialias.net/fitxasimbol.php?num=95&amp;ord=0&amp;pg=0 here]&lt;/ref&gt; or Fascist&lt;ref&gt;see [https://apaguemlesnuclears.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/mocio-popular.pdf here] or [http://terresdelebreantifeixistes.blogspot.com/2010/02/qui-era-joaquin-bau.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; symbols. No trace of Bau having been named "hijo predilecto" of Tortosa in 1966&lt;ref&gt;Monserrat Cavaller 2001, pp. 366-9&lt;/ref&gt; can be found on the official ayuntamiento web page.&lt;ref&gt;compare [http://www.tortosa.cat/ here]&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1956 until 2018 one of Tortosa [[college]]s was named "Institut Joaquín Bau"&lt;ref&gt;see the Institut home page, available [http://agora.xtec.cat/iesjbau/ here]&lt;/ref&gt; (today ''Institut Dertosa''), though there was a failed attempt to change the patron in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;see history section of the IJB service, available [http://agora.xtec.cat/iesjbau/linstitut/historia/ here]&lt;/ref&gt; Bau's biography, in large part a hagiographical compilation of his correspondence from the private archive, was published in 2001; the author defined Bau as a conservative monarchist and played down Carlist threads, ignoring also most controversial episodes from his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;Bau's shuttling between Carlist and Alfonsist claimants is ignored; there is no note of his harsh stance on Marcelino Domingo in 1929, on his war dealings with the Nazis in 1941-42 or on his "traitor" image among the Carlists in the 1940s&lt;/ref&gt; Condado de Bau is still functional and currently remains held by Bau's grandson.&lt;ref&gt;see ''BOE'' 06.05.99, availavle [http://www.boe.es/boe/dias/1999/05/06/pdfs/A17072-17072.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John "Johnny" Jones''' (March 1809 – 16 March 1869) was a pioneer settler in [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref name=Mennell&gt;{{cite Australasia|Jones, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Sydney]], Jones was the third son of Thomas Jones, one of the early settlers in [[New South Wales]].&lt;ref name=Mennell/&gt; He spent his early life on sealing and whaling ships, before becoming a ferryman at [[Port Jackson]]. He had an entrepreneurial streak and invested his savings in a way that by the age of 20, he had interests in three whaling ships.{{sfn|Scholefield|1940|p=442}} He married Sarah Sizemore on 7 January 1828 in Sydney,&lt;ref name="DNZB Jones"&gt;{{DNZB|Tapp|E. J.|1j4|Jones, John|3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they had 11 children, although two died as infants. [[John Richard Jones]] was his eldest son.{{sfn|Scholefield|1940|p=444}}

In 1835 Jones and Edwin Palmer went into a partnership to purchase a whaling station in New Zealand and a schooner for whaling. Within the next few years, his shrewd business skills allowed him to gain a controlling interest in seven New Zealand whaling stations.

[[File:Johnny Jones tomb.jpg|thumb|right|Johnny Jones's tomb in [[Dunedin Southern Cemetery]]]]In 1838 he bought a whaling station and land near [[Waikouaiti]], and also purchased a large area of land from [[Ngai Tahu]] chief [[Tuhawaiki|"Bloody Jack" Tuhawaiki]], amounting to a considerable part of what is now [[North Otago|North]] and [[Central Otago]]. Much of this purchase was later annulled when [[South Island]] lands were ceded to [[the Crown]]. After long wrangling, Jones was eventually allowed to keep some {{convert|11000|acre|km2|0}}.

In 1840, Jones' Waikouaiti station became the organised settlement in the eastern South Island known as [[Matanaka Farm]]. About a dozen families from Sydney were settled close to the station as a farming community, providing food for the station, growing crops and raising sheep and cattle.&lt;ref name="DNZB Jones" /&gt;

Financial constraints led Jones to move permanently to New Zealand with his family in 1843, dividing his time between Waikouaiti and [[Wellington]]. The decline of whaling forced him to close the Waikouaiti station in the late 1840s, and he concentrated on developing his farm which soon became an important food source for the new settlement of [[Dunedin]], where he moved in 1854. During the early days of settlement in Dunedin, Jones' shipping and trading interests set him up as the chief rival to [[James Macandrew]].

In 1861, Jones asked Dr. [[William Chapman (doctor)|William Chapman]], then of [[Christchurch]], to be the GP for the Waikouaiti community. {{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

During the 1860s, Jones' interests again turned to shipping, firstly as a shareholder of the short-lived Otago Steam Ship Company, and then through his own venture, the Harbour Steam Navigation Company,&lt;ref name=Mennell/&gt; which served the ports of Dunedin, [[Port Chalmers]], and [[Oamaru]], and later also traded with [[Hokitika]] on the [[West Coast, New Zealand|West Coast]].

Jones had little interest in politics, and refused a position offered by [[Edward Stafford (politician)|Edward Stafford]] on the [[New Zealand Legislative Council]]. He did, however, serve as chairman of the Dunedin Town Board in 1856. Jones died in Dunedin in 1869, and is buried in the city's [[Southern Cemetery, Dunedin|Southern Cemetery]]. His eldest son was an executor of his will and was thus instrumental in the amalgamation of various shipping companies to form the [[Union Company|Union Steam Ship Company]].{{sfn|Scholefield|1940|p=444}}

The '''Louisiana Center for Women in Government and Business Hall of Fame''' recognizes women natives or residents of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Louisiana]] for their significant achievements or statewide contributions. Among the inductees are men whose contributions to supporting strong women were deemed significant. The Center is headquartered at [[Nicholls State University]] in [[Thibodaux, Louisiana|Thibodaux]] and was established in 1991 to promote and encourage government and public service leadership of women. The first Hall of Fame inductions occurred in March 1994 during [[Women's History Month]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Louisiana Center for Women in Government and Business Hall of Fame|url=http://louisianawomen.org/|accessdate=January 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Martin Garlieb Amsinck''' (born 23 September 1831 in [[Hamburg]], died 10 April 1905 in Hamburg) was a German shipbuilder and ship-owner. He was one of the major ship-owners of [[Hamburg]]. He was a member of Hanseatic [[Amsinck]] family and the son of Johannes Amsinck and Emilie [[Berenberg-Gossler|Gossler]]. Unlike his four brothers, he did not join the family company, but started his own shipbuilding company.&lt;ref name="Hauschild-Thiessen"&gt;Renate Hauschild-Thiessen: ''Amsinck, Martin Garlieb.''

Built by [[Marshall Field &amp; Co.]] and later owned for over half a century by the [[Kennedy family]], the Mart centralized Chicago's [[wholesale]] goods business by consolidating architectural and interior design vendors and trades under a single roof.&lt;ref name="Architects"/&gt; It has since become home to several other enterprises, including the [[Shops at the Mart]], the Chicago campus of the [[Illinois Institute of Art – Chicago|Illinois Institute of Art]], [[Motorola Mobility]], and the Chicago tech startup center 1871.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nbcchicago.com/blogs/inc-well/How-1871-Has-Changed-Chicagos-Startup-World-One-Year-Later-205989051.html| date=2013-05-13| accessdate=2014-06-08| title=How 1871 Has Changed Chicago’s Startup World One Year Later| publisher=[[WMAQ-TV]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Construction and context===

[[Image:Merchandise mart construction 1929.jpg|thumb|left|Merchandise Mart under construction, 1929]]
[[File:Photography by Victor Albert Grigas (1919-2017) 00389 Chicago Loop Christmas time - developed March 1970 (37458766170).jpg|thumb|left|Merchandise Mart in late 1969]]

In 1926, a westward extension of double-deck [[Wacker Drive]] increased development on the south [[Bank (geography)|riverbank]]. In 1927, Marshall Field &amp; Co. announced its plans to build on the north bank opposite Wacker Drive.  The site, bordered by Orleans Street, [[Wells Street (Chicago)|Wells Street]], Kinzie Street and the [[Chicago River]], was formerly a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] trading post and the site of [[Chicago and North Western Railway]]'s former [[Wells Street Station (Chicago)|Wells Street Station]], abandoned in 1911 in favor of the [[Chicago and North Western Passenger Terminal]].&lt;ref name="Marchitecture"/&gt;  With the railroad's [[air rights]], the site was large enough to accommodate "the largest building in the world".&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.merchandisemart.com/marchitecture/history.html| accessdate=2007-07-10| title=History of the Mart| publisher=merchandisemart.com| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070602052539/http://www.merchandisemart.com/marchitecture/history.html |archivedate=2007-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Removing the train yard supported the [[Chicago Plan Commission]]'s desire to develop and beautify the riverfront.

James Simpson, president of Marshall Field &amp; Co. from 1923 to 1930 and chairman of the Chicago Plan Commission from 1926 to 1935, turned the first shovels of dirt at [[groundbreaking]] on August 16, 1928, along with architect Ernest Graham.  [[General contractor]] John W. Griffiths &amp; Sons brought building construction into the [[machine age]] through the use of techniques "ordinarily used in the construction of big [[dam]]s."&lt;ref name="Building"/&gt; [[Concrete]] arriving by boat was lifted by [[Pneumatics|compressed air]] to bins {{convert|75|ft|m|-1}} above the ground, with [[gravel]] and [[sand]] delivered by railroad cars to [[conveyor belt]]s and transfer elevators. Giant [[Concrete mixer|mixers]] provided wet [[concrete]] to skip hoists in vertical towers that were extended as the building rose. Continuously employing 2,500 men and as many as 5,700 men altogether, the construction project lasted a year and a half into the early months of the [[Great Depression]].  With a foundation [[surface area|footprint]] of nearly two square [[city block]]s, the building required 29 million [[brick]]s, {{convert|40|mi|km|0}} of [[plumbing]], {{convert|380|mi|km|-1}} of wiring, nearly {{convert|4000000|cuyd|m3}} of concrete, {{convert|200000|cuft|m3}} of stone, and 4,000 [[window]]s.&lt;ref name="Marchitecture"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OfficeRetail"/&gt;  [[Bethlehem Steel]] fabricated much of the 60,000 tons of [[steel]].&lt;ref name=Bethlehem&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsp.org/default.aspx?id=945 |accessdate=2007-07-22 |title=Bethlehem Steel: The Rise and Fall of an Industrial Giant |publisher=The Historical Society of Pennsylvania |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080127192659/http://www.hsp.org/default.aspx?id=945 |archivedate=2008-01-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  An estimated {{convert|7.5|mi|km|-1}} of corridors and over 30 [[elevator]]s were included in the construction.&lt;ref name="Marchitecture"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lot"&gt;{{cite news| title=A lot of Merchandise Series: 20TH CENTURY CHICAGO| url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4518645.html| date=October 22, 1999| last=Kennedy| first=Christopher G.| work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]| subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The total cost of construction was estimated to be $26 million.&lt;ref name = Langton&gt;James Langton, "End of the house that Joe built".

The Merchandise Mart opened on May 5, 1930, just east of Chicago's original [[trading post]], [[Wolf Point, Chicago|Wolf Point]].&lt;ref name=OfficeRetail&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.merchandisemart.com/officeretail/about.html| accessdate=2007-07-19| title=Merchandise Mart Office Retail| publisher=merchandisemart.com| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061025004147/http://www.merchandisemart.com/officeretail/about.html| archivedate=2006-10-25| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building realized Marshall Field’s dream of a single wholesale center for the entire nation and consolidated 13 different warehouses. It was purchased in 1945 or 1946, depending on the source,&lt;ref name=NPNLFtO&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/16/garden/new-pieces-new-looks-for-the-office.html?|title=New Pieces, New Looks For the Office|accessdate=July 13, 2010|date=June 16, 1998|author=Giovannini, Joseph|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CKCTPTWOTOFB&gt;{{cite news|author=Feuerstein, Phyllis|title=Christopher Kennedy Chicago's The Place To Work On The Other Family Business|date=August 22, 1993|page=8|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Kennedy family]] through Merchandise Mart Properties, Inc., and managed by [[Sargent Shriver]].   The purchase price was $13 million, roughly half of what it had cost to construct the complex twenty years earlier.&lt;ref name=Langton/&gt;  The building revenues became a principal source of Kennedy family wealth, including being a source of political campaign funding.&lt;ref name=Langton/&gt;  

The Kennedy family sold much of the complex center property to [[Vornado Realty Trust]] in 1998 as part of a larger $625&amp;nbsp;million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|625|1998|r=1}}}} million in current dollars) transaction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kennedy Family Selling Merchandise Mart To Vornado Realty|date=January 26, 1998|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, MMPI was acquired by Vornado for $450 million cash and a $100 million-plus stake in Vornado.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| date=January 26, 1998| url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-01-26/news/9801270086_1_vornado-realty-trust-kennedy-family-showroom-space| title=Kennedy Family Selling Merchandise Mart To Vornado Realty| work=[[Chicago Tribune]]| agency=[[Bloomberg News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Emporis&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=merchandisemart-chicago-il-usa| accessdate=2007-07-19| title=Merchandise Mart, Chicago| publisher=emporis.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of early 2007, the building was valued at $917 million.&lt;ref name=crains1&gt;{{cite web| first=Thomas A.| last=Corfman| date=February 21, 2007|  url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20070221/NEWS12/200023946/merchandise-marts-value-soars-in-9-years| accessdate=2016-02-17| title=Merchandise Mart’s value soars in 9 years| work=[[Crain Communications|Crain's Chicago Business]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Merchandise Mart was modernized in the late 1950s and 1960s.  The Indian chiefs were removed and replaced with concrete plates in 1961, of minimal note to onlookers as skyscrapers did not rise on the north side of the river as predicted. Some of the carvings were later found in a suburban backyard and auctioned in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Lost Pieces of Merchandise Mart Found in a Suburban Garden| url=http://www.chicagoarchitecture.org/2014/05/22/lost-pieces-of-merchandise-mart-found-in-a-suburban-garden/| publisher=Chicago Architecture| date=May 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Suburban Woman Selling Indian Heads That Once Adorned Merchandise Mart| url=http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2014/05/26/for-sale-two-indian-heads-which-used-to-adorned-merchandise-mart/| work=[[WBBM-TV|WBBM News]]| date=May 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, an entrance [[canopy (building)|canopy]] was constructed over the south for vehicle use.

In 1977, [[Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill]] designed the [[350 West Mart Center|Chicago Apparel Center]], located on the west side of Orleans Street, which increased the Merchandise Mart’s total floor space to {{convert|6200000|sqft|m2}}. Making use of plazas, [[esplanade]]s and overlooks employed the waterfront location for pedestrian pleasure.  In 1988, [[Helmut Jahn]] designed an enclosed pedestrian walking bridge over Orleans Street connecting the Mart and the Apparel Center.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;

After a 10-year, $100 million modernization in the late 1980s that included [[public utility]] upgrades, [[Beyer Blinder Belle]]'s commission in 1989 was to create additional perimeter entrances and restore the display windows, main entrance and lobby.&lt;ref name="Beyer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ChicagoL"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.chicago-l.org/stations/merchandise_mart.html| title=Merchandise Mart| date=May 15, 2006|publisher=chicago-l.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;   On the south facade, the drive-through canopy was removed and two smaller doorways aside the main entrance were added.  Display windows, [[paint]]ed over during the earlier modernization campaign, were restored with clear glass to showcase merchant's wares.  New main and corner entrances were added to the rear [[facade]], and the [[loading dock]] that occupied the north portion of the first floor of the river level was removed in order to use the bottom deck of North Bank Drive.  Improvements to the lobby included restoration of the original glass [[curtain wall (architecture)|curtain wall]] over the entrance, shop fronts and reception desk using terrazzo floors and wall sconces influenced by the original design.&lt;ref name="Building"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Beyer"/&gt;  The project was completed in 1991.

In November 2007, the building received [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] for Existing Buildings Silver recognition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenprogress.com/green_building_article.php?id=1408 The Merchandise Mart Chicago Receives LEED Silver Certification] greenprogress.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Merchandise Mart was designed by the Chicago architectural firm of [[Graham, Anderson, Probst and White]] to be a "city within a city".&lt;ref name="Emporis"/&gt;  Second only to [[Holabird &amp; Roche|Holabird &amp; Root]] in Chicago art deco architecture, the firm had a long-standing relationship with the Field family.  Started in 1928, completed in 1931, and built in the same [[art deco]] style as the [[Chicago Board of Trade Building]], its cost was reported as both $32 million and $38 million.  The building was the largest in the world in terms of floorspace, but was surpassed by the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] in 1943,&lt;ref name=MarshallField&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.merchandisemart.com/marchitecture/marshall_field.html| accessdate=2007-07-19| title=Marchitecture Marshall Field| publisher=merchandisemart.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and now stands forty-fourth on the [[list of largest buildings in the world]].  Once the largest commercial space in the world, [[New Century Global Center]] in China is now recognized by [[Guinness World Records]] as holding the record.&lt;ref name=AmericanWay&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanwaymag.com/aw/travel/feature.asp?archive_date=4/15/2005 |author=Pope, Elizabeth |date=2005-04-15 |accessdate=2007-08-16 |title=Wall Street of Flowers |publisher=American Airlines |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927043449/http://americanwaymag.com/aw/travel/feature.asp?archive_date=4%2F15%2F2005 |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture===
Designer Alfred Shaw integrated art deco stylings with influences from three building types—the [[warehouse]], the [[department store]] and the [[skyscraper]].&lt;ref name="Building"/&gt; A warehouse block stands as the 18-story bulk of the building. Ribbon [[Pier (architecture)|piers]] define the windows, and the building's chamfered corners, minimal setbacks, and corner [[pavilions]] disguise the edges of the mass and visually reduce bulk.&lt;ref name="Building"/&gt; The south corner pavilions are of greater height than the north corner pavilions. The building is open at the pedestrian level with bronzed framed [[display window]]s, typical of a department store, on the south, west and east boundaries. The 25-story central tower ascends with a peak in the form of a skyscraper, and rests in the southern half of the building. Deeply recessed [[Portal (architecture)|portals]] occur between raised panels, and are adorned with [[medallions]] featuring the interlocked initials of the Merchandise Mart. The same [[logo]] occurs throughout the building. Fifty-six [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] [[tribal chief|chiefs]] circled the tower's crown, a reference to the site's history and Chicago's early trade activities. Three and a half feet wide by seven feet tall, the [[terra cotta]] figures were barely visible from the street, meant to be viewed from the upper floors of the skyscrapers planned to rise along the riverbank.&lt;ref name="Building"/&gt;

The lobby of The Merchandise Mart is defined by eight square [[marble]] piers, with storefronts in side aisles framed in embossed [[bronze]] trim.  The green and orange [[terrazzo]] floor was conceived as a [[carpet]]: a pattern of squares and stripes bordered by overscaled chevrons inlaid with The Mart's [[initials]]. The [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron]] theme is continued in the column [[Sconce (light fixture)|sconce]]s lighting an ornamented [[cornice]] overhead.  Referred to as "business boulevards", two wide {{convert|650|ft|m}} long corridors with [[terrazzo]] floors in the upper levels featured six and one-half miles of display windows. Building regulations specified identical entrances along corridors but tenants could personalize the individual floor space. Excepting the corridors, elevator halls, and exhibition space on the fourth floor, the {{convert|5|acre|m2}} of each upper floor was "raw space" with concrete floors.&lt;ref name="Building"/&gt;

===Artwork===
[[Jules Guerin]]'s [[frieze]] of 17 [[murals]] is the primary feature of the lobby and graphically illustrate [[commerce]] throughout the world, including the countries of origin for items sold in the building.&lt;ref name="Emporis"/&gt; The murals depict the industries and products, the primary mode of transportation and the architecture of 14 countries.  Drawing on years as a stage set designer, Guerin executed the murals in red with [[gold leaf]] using techniques producing distinct image layers in successive planes. In a panel representing [[Italy]], [[Venice, Italy|Venetian]] [[glassware]] appears in the foreground with fishing boats moored on the Grand Canal and the facade of the Palazzo Ducale rises above the towers of the Piazza San Marco.&lt;ref name=Mural&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.merchandisemart.com/marchitecture/mural.html| accessdate=2007-07-19| title=Marchitecture Murals| publisher=merchandisemart.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"To immortalize outstanding American merchants", Joseph Kennedy in 1953 commissioned eight bronze [[Bust (sculpture)|busts]], four times life size, which would come to be known as the Merchandise Mart Hall of Fame:&lt;ref name="OfficeRetail"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lot"/&gt;
* retail magnates [[Frank Winfield Woolworth]], [[Marshall Field]] and [[Aaron Montgomery Ward]]
* [[Julius Rosenwald]] and [[Robert Elkington Wood]] of [[Sears, Roebuck and Company]] fame
* advertiser [[John Wanamaker]], merchandiser [[Edward Albert Filene]], and [[The Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company|A&amp;P]] grocery chain founder [[George Huntington Hartford]].
All of the busts rest on white pedestals lining the Chicago River and face north toward the gold front door of the building.

===Surroundings===
[[Image:Behind the Merch Mart.jpg|thumb|left|Plaza in front of the Merchandise Mart]]

Dominating the skyline in the south end of the [[Near North Side, Chicago|Near North Side]], the Mart lies just south of the gallery district on the southern terminus of Franklin Street.  Eateries and nightclubs abound on [[Hubbard Street]] one block to the north.  The [http://www.kinziechophouse.com Kinzie Chophouse], popular with [[politicians]] and celebrities, stands on the northwest corner of Wells and Kinzie, across from the Merchandise Mart. The [[Chicago Varnish Company Building]], listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] and now housing [[Harry Caray]]'s restaurant, is located east on Kinzie Street. Across the street to the east is 325 N. Wells Street, home to [[The Chicago School of Professional Psychology]] and DIRTT Environmental Solutions.

The Mart is not rectangular in shape due to being constructed after the [[bascule bridge]]s over the Chicago River. The control house for the double decked [[Wells Street Bridge (Chicago)|Wells Street Bridge]] stands between the lower level and the southeast corner of the building.  The [[Franklin Street Bridge]] stands at the southwest corner of the building, at the junction of Orleans Street and Franklin Street.  The building slants at the same angle as Franklin Street, from southeast to northwest along Orleans Street.

===Exterior lighting===
A heritage of lighting the structure finds the central and corner towers, along with the columns between each window on the setbacks, bathed nightly in an upwardly focused white light.  [[Tradition]] dictates annual changes to green in mid-March for [[St. Patrick's Day]] and orange during the fall months around [[Halloween]] and [[Thanksgiving]].  Prominent events have found the [[behemoth]] lit in pink for [[Cancer]] Awareness Month.  To note the [[2006 Chicago Bears season]], highlighted by reaching [[Super Bowl XLI]], the building was lit with team colors, orange floodlights for the setbacks and blue floodlights for the towers.  Red and green lights are used during the [[Christmas]] season. During the [[Art Chicago]] 2008 the American artist [[Jenny Holzer]] illuminated the facade of the building with a poem by the Polish winner of the [[Nobel Prize]] in Literature [[Wisława Szymborska]]. In 2018, a large projection screen will begin displaying images and videos across the structure's riverfront side.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://urbanmatter.com/merchandise-mart-projection-screen/|title=A Giant Projection Screen Will Light Up the Merchandise Mart {{!}} UrbanMatter|date=2017-03-13|work=UrbanMatter|access-date=2017-03-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nighttime lighting on the Mart typically matches the colors of [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] lighting on the [[Sears Tower]] and [[John Hancock Center]], as well as the colors used on the top floors of the [[Aon Center (Chicago)|Aon Center]].

===Green building practices===
Under [[Christopher G. Kennedy|Chris Kennedy]]'s leadership of the Mart, it was the largest building in the world to be awarded LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Certification in 2007&lt;ref name="greenprogress.com"&gt;[http://www.greenprogress.com/green_building_article.php?id=1408/ World's Largest LEED-EB Certified Building&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[United States Green Building Council]] (USGBC). The Mart has long been implementing sustainable practices. The Mart Center began operating a thermal storage facility in 1986, capable of building {{convert|2000000|lb}} of ice per night, cooling 71 buildings in the surrounding neighborhood, and saving $200,000 in electricity costs in the first year.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

In 1990, the Mart Center began using [[Green Seal]]-approved green cleaning products and the next year implemented a recycling program, which today includes all forms of paper products, glass, light bulbs, batteries, aluminum and construction materials. In 1996, the Mart Center became one of the first major property owners in downtown Chicago to enter into an agreement with the district cooling system now known as [[Thermal Chicago]], thus contributing to the national effort to reduce the discharge of ozone-damaging [[Chlorofluorocarbon|CFC]]s.

In 2006, MMPI joined [[Clean Air Counts]], a voluntary initiative to reduce smog forming pollutants and energy consumption in the Chicago area. Part of the campaign strategies included utilizing only low VOC cleaning products, paints and building materials, as well as energy efficient lighting and alternative workplace transportation options. To date, the Mart Center has reduced pollution by {{convert|264018|lb}}, the largest reduction by a commercial building.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

That same year, the Mart Center recycling program saved over 13,000 trees and recycled nearly 11 million pounds of waste, while water conservation efforts saved {{convert|5.5|e6USgal|m3}} of water. More than eight percent of the estimated 10,000 people working at the Mart walk, bike or take public transportation; to encourage greener methods of transportation, the Mart expanded bicycle storage capacity to more than 200.  In 2009, MMPI converted all stationery to a one hundred percent post-consumer recycled product. {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

The Mart has nine LEED-certified showrooms, with five others on their way to LEED certification.

==Uses==

===Commerce===
[[Image:A Display inside the Merchandise Mart.jpg|thumb|right|A display inside the Merchandise Mart]]
Wholesale showrooms occupy 50% of the usable floor space,&lt;ref name="Marchitecture"/&gt;  and the [[Sultan of Brunei]] once spent $1.6 million at the Mart to furnish his entire palace, claiming the location was the only place where the task could be completed in one week.&lt;ref name="Emporis"/&gt; Select showrooms are open only to wholesalers, with others accessible to the general public. Unlike stores with traditional shelf and rack displays, entire usable rooms are created, providing consumers an opportunity to compare form and function between applications and manufacturers. A portion of the stores offer items for purchase singly or as a collection, while others offer design services, preservation, renovation, or installation.  In addition to being a resource for architects and decorators, the Mart also has featured award-winning designs as selected by the [[American Institute of Architects]]. Catering to suppliers, on-site firms specialize in providing professional services for market research projects.

In 1931, Marshall Field and Company lost five million dollars, followed by eight million in 1932.&lt;ref name="MarshallField"/&gt;  The wholesale division was greatly reduced and Field's reduced its space in the Mart from four floors to one and half. The Mart continued to display the latest trends in home furnishings within the showrooms and trade shows.  The company recovered late in the decade, but did not return to all previously occupied space.

In 1942, [[Skaggs family|L. L. Skaggs]] formed a partnership with three other men and named the partnership the Owners Service Company, hence [[Osco Drug|Osco]]. The headquarters moved from Waterloo, Iowa, to the Merchandise Mart.

A retail shopping area, named The Shops at the Mart, opened in 1991 and includes apparel shops, beauty services, bookstores and [[newsagent|newsstands]], financial services, telecommunication services, travel services, specialty food and [[wine]] stores, photo services, a [[dry cleaning|dry cleaner]], [[shoe polish|shoe shine]] stand, and a [[food court]].  A [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Post Office]] is located on the first floor and a [[FedEx]] location is on the second floor.&lt;ref name="Metromix"/&gt;

The Apparel Center houses the 521-room Holiday Inn Chicago Mart Plaza River North hotel, the offices of the ''Chicago Sun-Times'' and the Chicago campus of the [[Illinois Institute of Art – Chicago]], as well as the Chicago office of the [[Ogilvy &amp; Mather]] advertising agency.  [[GoHealth]] occupies {{convert|93000|sqft|m2|-2}} on the 5th floor of Merchandise Mart, the [[Potbelly Sandwich Works]]' corporate offices are located in the tower.&lt;ref name="newsletter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmart.com/officeretail/tenant_newsletter.html |title=Tenant Newsletter |date=2007-08-08 |publisher=Merchandise Mart Properties, Inc. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814015036/http://www.mmart.com/officeretail/tenant_newsletter.html |archivedate=2007-08-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Motorola Mobility]] moved its headquarters to the Merchandise Mart in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]| url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304281004579222442197428538| title=Companies Say Goodbye to the 'Burbs| last=Weber| first=Lauren| date=December 3, 2013| accessdate=February 17, 2016| subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trade fairs===
{{Redirect-synonym|NeoCon|[[Neoconservatism]]}}

Since 1969, the Merchandise Mart has been home to the annual National Exposition of Contract Furnishings, known as '''NeoCon'''. With over 1,000 exhibitors of contract and commercial furnishings, and 50,000 attendees, it is the largest trade show of its kind in North America.&lt;ref name=NeoCon&gt;{{cite web| title=Show Info| url=http://www.neocon.com/about/show-info| publisher=NeoCon| accessdate=February 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2006 the Merchandise Mart has played host to the [[Art Chicago]] international art fair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Misha| last=Davenport| title=On With the Art Show -- At the Mart| work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]| date=April 27, 2006| page=8| url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1625480.html| subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;CC&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mass media===

====Radio====
Before the location even opened, [[NBC]] announced plans to build studios in the Mart. When opened on October 20, 1930, the nineteenth floor location covered {{convert|65000|sqft|m2|-2}} and supported a variety of live broadcasts including those requiring orchestras. [[WLS-TV|WENR]] and [[WMAQ (AM)|WMAQ]] broadcast from the location.  Expanded in 1935, with office space in the previously unoccupied tower, the additional {{convert|11500|sqft|m2|-1}} provided room for an [[Organ (music)|organ]] chamber, two echo rooms, and a total of 11 studios.  A staff of more than 300 produced up to 1,700 programs each month, including ''[[Amos 'n' Andy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.richsamuels.com/nbcmm/studiof.html |title=WMAQ Studio F| publisher=Samuels| accessdate=April 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tour"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.richsamuels.com/nbcmm/trguide.html |title=A Tour of the 1930 NBC Studios|publisher=Samuels| accessdate=April 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.richsamuels.com/nbcmm/birdseye.html| title=Birdseye, cut-away view of the NBC studios| publisher=Samuels| accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hugh Downs]] contributed to the [[Burr Tillstrom]] children's show ''[[Kukla, Fran and Ollie]]'' from the NBC studios after the network picked up the program from [[WBBM-TV|WBKB]]. The ''[[Captain Midnight]]'' radio program was broadcast from the Mart from 1942 until 1945.

WMAQ and WMAQ-TV moved to the [[NBC Tower]] in 1990 (even though the radio station had been sold to [[Westinghouse Broadcasting]] two years earlier). (Today, the former NBC space is being utilized by [[Tribeca Flashpoint Media Arts Academy]] as a learning site for Film + Broadcast productions.) WMAQ's former sister FM station, WKQX, stayed at the Merchandise Mart; renamed [[WIQI]], as of May 2012 it still occupies space on the west side of the second floor, along with co-owned [[WCKL-FM|WLUP]]. As of 2014 [[WKQX (FM)|WKQX]] has returned to its former Merchandise Mart location, however the station is expected to move to a new facility at [[NBC Tower]] by summer 2016.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

====Television====
On January 7, 1949, [[NBC]] station WNBQ commercially debuted its [[television]] broadcast schedule on channel 5, with a minimum of two hours of programming per day.  April 15, 1956, is remembered as "C-Day" at [[WMAQ-TV]], and was described by Broadcasting-Telecasting magazine as "a daring breakthrough the black-and-white curtain."  With Mayor [[Richard J. Daley]] looking on, NBC President [[David Sarnoff]] operated the controls as Channel 5 became the world's first [[Color television|all-color TV station]] as "Wide, Wide World" was broadcast to 110 NBC-TV affiliated stations across the country.  The color conversion project cost more than $1,250,000 with advertising costing $175,000. On "C-Day", three [[skywriting]] planes flew over the city, trailing streams of red, green and blue smoke.

WMAQ-TV first installed color equipment in late 1953, with the [[Tournament of Roses Parade|Rose Bowl parade]] of 1954 as the first major broadcast.  Introduced in March 1955, the first local color program was [[John Ott]]'s "How Does Your Garden Grow?", featuring the use of [[time-lapse]] color film.

Although WMAQ-TV has since moved to [[NBC Tower]] about a mile away, and for the most part the 19th floor of the Mart has been turned into office space, one former tenant (Bankers Life and Trust Company) maintained a remnant of the original studios as their video and multimedia department. The former WMAQ space is currently being redeveloped by Flashpoint Academy as a full modern soundstage facility as well as a screening room, backlot, and classroom space over the 19th and 20th floors.

Local [[regional sports network]] [[CSN Chicago|Comcast SportsNet Chicago]] has their control room, and broadcasts their live studio programming from the Apparel Center expansion; the studios had been home to previous RSNs [[FSN Chicago]] and [[SportsChannel|SportsChannel Chicago]].&lt;ref name="newsletter"/&gt;

Built in under four months and opened on December 5, 1930, the [[Merchandise Mart (CTA station)|Merchandise Mart]] elevated train station served the [[North Side Main Line (CTA)|Main Line of the North Side Division]].&lt;ref name="ChicagoL"/&gt;  The station is now noted for being one of two commercial locations to have its own station on the [[Chicago Transit Authority]]'s (CTA) [[Chicago 'L'|'L' system]].&lt;ref name="Marchitecture"/&gt;   The station is now served by the [[Brown Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Brown]] and [[Purple Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Purple Lines]].&lt;ref name="ChicagoL"/&gt;  An ADA accessible station, the [[turnstile]]s are located within the building on the second floor, while the platforms are connected to the east side of the building.  The northbound platform is accessed by an overhead bridge or elevator.  It was rebuilt in 1988, prior to the Wells Street Bridge reconstruction in 1989.

The Merchandise Mart housed the CTA's headquarters on the 7th floor from 1947 to 2004.&lt;ref name="Emporis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ChicagoL"/&gt;

==Early life and education==
Lynch was born in [[Ilford]], [[Essex]] in 1965 and grew up near [[Chelmsford, Essex]]. His mother was a nurse and his father a fireman.&lt;ref name="business.timesonline.co.uk"&gt;[http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/movers_and_shakers/article4289418.ece Business big shot: Mike Lynch of Autonomy] The Times, 8 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, aged 11, he won a scholarship to [[Bancroft's School]], [[Woodford, London|Woodford]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bancroftians.net/UserFiles/File/obaagmdocs.pdf OBA President's Report - 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; From there he went to [[Christ's College, Cambridge]] to study [[Natural Sciences (Cambridge)|Natural Sciences]].

After graduating he went on to do a [[PhD]] in [[signal processing]]&lt;ref name="lynchphd"&gt;{{cite thesis |degree=DPhil |first=Michael Richard|last=Lynch |title=Adaptive techniques in signal processing and connectionist models |publisher=University of Cambridge |date=1990 |url=http://ulmss-newton.lib.cam.ac.uk/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=11028|authorlink=Michael Richard Lynch}}&lt;/ref&gt; and communications research at the [[University of Cambridge]], and then undertook a research fellowship in adaptive pattern recognition.&lt;ref name="BBC Press Office"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2006/12_december/14/directors.shtml|title=BBC - Press Office - BBC appoints Executive Board|publisher=|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entrepreneurial career==
In the late 1980s Lynch formed Lynett Systems Ltd, producing designs and audio products for the music recording industry including the first ever sampler for the Atari ST, the Lynex, which was followed by the ADAS sampler for Atari, Mac &amp; PC. This led to the offshoot D2D Systems which produced a software-only hard disk recording system for the Atari Falcon.

In 1991 he set up ''Cambridge Neurodynamics'', which specialized in computer-based finger print recognition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/seminars/1995/95-11-14.html Security Group Seminar] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202211844/http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/seminars/1995/95-11-14.html |date=2 December 2012 }} University of Cambridge&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996 Lynch co-founded [[Autonomy Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060628201313/http://www.vnunet.com/networkitweek/features/2058993/kindness-strangers The Kindness of Strangers] VNU Net&lt;/ref&gt; and he served Autonomy as CEO. During this time Autonomy acquired Dremedia, Virage ($13m), Verity ($500m), Zantaz ($375m) and Interwoven ($606m).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/technology-media-telco-SP/idUSL0322638020070703 Autonomy to buy Zantaz for $375m, place shares] Reuters, 3 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2011 Autonomy was sold to Hewlett-Packard for $11 billion.&lt;ref name="Profile: Mike Lynch"/&gt;

In May 2012, HP fired Mike Lynch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcr-online.biz/news/read/hp-fires-mike-lynch/028388 HP fires Mike Lynch] PCR, 25 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disputes==
Larry Ellison, the CEO of [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]],  when dealing with Lynch and his colleagues said : "either Mr Lynch has a very poor memory or he is lying".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2011/09/larry-ellison-of-oracle-calls-autonomy-ceo-lying-liar/|title=Larry Ellison Of Oracle Calls Autonomy CEO Lying Liar|publisher=Gizmodo|date=30 September 2011| accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However Lynch was proved right when [[Frank Quattrone]], Autonomy's advisor, confirmed the presentation at the center of the controversy had been his and not given by Lynch as Oracle had asserted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/09/30/quattrone_says_autonomy_is_right|title=Quattrone blasts Ellison, says Autonomy is right|publisher=The Register|date=30 September 2011|accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, HP did a deal with law firms suing them on behalf of shareholders over the matter. HP would pay them and they would help HP sue Lynch and the former Autonomy CFO for [[fraud]]. HP's deal was objected to by a number of parties and was considered highly suspect as the lawyers were to be paid but not the shareholders. Judge Breyer threw the case out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/07/03/dealpolitik-more-evidence-of-broken-shareholder-litigation-system|title=Dealpolitik: More Evidence of Broken Shareholder Litigation System|accessdate=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; HP's claims were investigated at HP's request by the [[Serious Fraud Office (United Kingdom)|UK Serious Fraud Office]], however the SFO announced in January 2015 that it was ending its investigation with no action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-30883288|title=Autonomy HP sale investigation by Serious Fraud Office closes|date=19 January 2015|publisher=BBC|accessdate=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See|List of miscarriage risks}}
Miscarriage may occur for many reasons, not all of which can be identified. [[Risk factor]]s are those things that increase the likelihood of having a miscarriage but don't necessarily cause a miscarriage.

Successful implantation of the [[zygote]] into the [[uterus]] is most likely 8 to 10 days after conception.

Chromosomal abnormalities are found in more than half of embryos miscarried in the first 13 weeks. Half of embryonic miscarriages (25% of all miscarriages) have an [[aneuploidy]] (abnormal number of chromosomes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1980|title=Anatomic and chromosomal anomalies in 639 spontaneous abortuses|journal=Human Genetics|volume=55|issue=1|pages=87–98|doi=10.1007/BF00329132|pmid=7450760|vauthors=Kajii T, Ferrier A, Niikawa N, Takahara H, Ohama K, Avirachan S}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Common chromosome abnormalities found in miscarriages include [[Trisomy|autosomal trisomy]] (22-32%), [[Turner syndrome|monosomy X]] (5-20%), [[Polyploid|triploidy]] (6-8%), [[tetraploidy]] (2-4%), or other structural chromosomal abnormalities (2%).&lt;ref name=Will2013 /&gt; Genetic problems are more likely to occur with older parents; this may account for the higher rates observed in older women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Pregnancy Over Age 30 | website=MUSC Children's Hospital | url = http://www.musckids.com/health_library/hrpregnant/over30.htm | accessdate = December 18, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061113233603/http://www.musckids.com/health_library/hrpregnant/over30.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = November 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second and third trimesters===
Second trimester losses may be due to maternal factors such as [[uterine malformation]], growths in the uterus ([[Uterine fibroid|fibroid]]s), or [[Cervical incompetence|cervical problems]].&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; These conditions also may contribute to [[premature birth]].&lt;ref name="webmd" /&gt; Unlike first-trimester miscarriages, second-trimester miscarriages are less likely to be caused by a genetic abnormality; chromosomal aberrations are found in a third of cases.&lt;ref name=Will2013 /&gt; Infection during the third trimester can cause a miscarriage.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

=== Age ===
{{Further|Advanced maternal age}}
The age of the pregnant woman is a significant risk factor.  Miscarriage rates increase steadily with age, with more substantial increases after age 35.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bray I, Gunnell D, [[George Davey Smith|Davey Smith G]]|year=2006|title=Advanced paternal age: How old is too old?|journal=Journal of Epidemiology &amp; Community Health|volume=60|issue=10|pages=851–3|doi=10.1136/jech.2005.045179|pmc=2566050|pmid=16973530}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In those under the age of 35 the risk is about 10% while it is about 45% in those over the age of 40.&lt;ref name="John2012" /&gt; Risk begins to increase around the age of 30.&lt;ref name="NIH2013Epi" /&gt; Paternal age is associated with increased risk.{{sfn|Hoffman|page=175}}

===Obesity, eating disorders and caffeine===
Not only is obesity associated with miscarriage, it can result in sub-fertility and other adverse pregnancy outcomes. Recurrent miscarriage is also related to obesity. Women with [[bulimia nervosa]] and [[anorexia nervosa]] may have a greater risk for miscarriage. Nutrient deficiencies have not been found to impact miscarriage rates but [[hyperemesis gravidarum]] sometimes precedes a miscarriage.
{{sfn|Hoffman|page=173}}

[[Caffeine]] consumption also has been correlated to miscarriage rates, at least at higher levels of intake.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; However, such higher rates have been found to be statistically significant only in certain circumstances.

Vitamin supplementation has generally not shown to be effective in preventing miscarriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|journal = Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue = 5|pages = CD004073|last=Balogun|first=Olukunmi O|last2=da Silva Lopes|first2=Katharina|last3=Ota|first3=Erika|last4=Takemoto|first4=Yo|last5=Rumbold|first5=Alice|last6=Takegata|first6=Mizuki|last7=Mori|first7=Rintaro|date=2016-05-06|isbn = |language=en|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd004073.pub4|pmid = 27150280}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese traditional medicine has not been found to prevent miscarriage.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===Endocrine disorders===
Disorders of the thyroid may affect pregnancy outcomes. Related to this, iodine deficiency is strongly associated with an increased risk of miscarriage.{{sfn|Hoffman|page=173}} The risk of miscarriage is increased in those with poorly controlled insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.{{sfn|Hoffman|page=173}} Women with well-controlled diabetes have the same risk of miscarriage as those without diabetes.&lt;ref name=Ferri2017&gt;{{cite book|author=Fred F.

===Food poisoning===
Ingesting food that has been contaminated with [[listeriosis]], [[toxoplasmosis]], and [[salmonella]] is associated with an increased risk of miscarriage.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = gloss/&gt;

===Amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling===
Amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling are procedures conducted to assess the fetus. A sample of amniotic fluid is obtained by the insertion of a needle through the abdomen and into the uterus. Chorionic villus sampling is a similar procedure with a sample of tissue removed rather than fluid. These procedures are not associated with pregnancy loss during the second trimester but they are associated with miscarriages and birth defects in the first trimester.&lt;ref name="Alfirevic"/&gt; Miscarriage caused by invasive prenatal diagnosis ([[chorionic villus sampling]] (CVS) and [[amniocentesis]]) is rare (about 1%).&lt;ref name="Agarwal-Alfirevic-2012"/&gt;

===Surgery===
The effects of surgery on pregnancy are not well-known including the effects of [[bariatric]] surgery. Abdominal and pelvic surgery are not risk factors in miscarriage. Ovarian tumors and cysts that are removed have not been found to increase the risk of miscarriage. The exception to this is the removal of the corpus luteum from the ovary. This can cause fluctuations in the hormones necessary to maintain the pregnancy.{{sfn|Hoffman|pages=172–173}}

===Medications===
Immunizations have not been found to cause miscarriage.{{sfn|Hoffman|page=72}} There is no significant association between [[antidepressant]] medication exposure and spontaneous abortion.&lt;ref name="Ross LE 436–443"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ross LE|last2=Grigoriadis S|last3=Mamisashvili L|display-authors=etal|date=2013-04-01|title=Selected pregnancy and delivery outcomes after exposure to antidepressant medication: A systematic review and meta-analysis|journal=JAMA Psychiatry|volume=70|issue=4|pages=436–443|doi=10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2013.684|pmid=23446732|issn=2168-622X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The risk of miscarriage is not likely decreased by discontinuing [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|SSRI]] prior to pregnancy.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dalke|first=Katharine Baratz|last2=Wenzel|first2=Amy|last3=Kim|first3=Deborah R.|date=2016-04-19|title=Depression and Anxiety During Pregnancy: Evaluating the Literature in Support of Clinical Risk-Benefit Decision-Making|journal=Current Psychiatry Reports|language=en|volume=18|issue=6|pages=1–12|doi=10.1007/s11920-016-0698-x|pmid=27091646|issn=1523-3812}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some available data suggest that there is a small increased risk of miscarriage for women taking any [[antidepressant]],&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2010|title=Gestational exposure to antidepressants and the risk of spontaneous abortion: A review|journal=Current Drug Delivery|volume=7|issue=1|pages=76–92|doi=10.2174/156720110790396508|pmid=19863482|vauthors=Broy P, Bérard A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2010|title=Use of antidepressants during pregnancy and the risk of spontaneous abortion|journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal|volume=182|issue=10|pages=1031–7|doi=10.1503/cmaj.091208|pmc=2900326|pmid=20513781|vauthors=Nakhai-Pour HR, Broy P, Bérard A}}&lt;/ref&gt; though this risk becomes less [[Statistical significance|statistically significant]] when excluding studies of poor quality.&lt;ref name="Ross LE 436–443"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yonkers|first=Kimberly A.|last2=Blackwell|first2=Katherine A.|last3=Glover|first3=Janis|last4=Forray|first4=Ariadna|date=2014-01-01|title=Antidepressant Use in Pregnant and Postpartum Women|journal=Annual Review of Clinical Psychology|volume=10|issue=1|pages=369–392|doi=10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-032813-153626|pmc=4138492|pmid=24313569}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medicines that increase the risk of miscarriage include:

* retinoids&amp;nbsp;
* nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)&amp;nbsp;, such as ibuprofen
* misoprostol&amp;nbsp;
* methotrexate&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

===Chemotherapy and radiation treatments for cancer===
Ionizing radiation levels given to a woman during cancer treatment cause miscarriage. Exposure can also impact fertility. The use of chemotherapeutic drugs used to treat childhood cancer increases the risk of miscarriage.{{sfn|Hoffman|page=173}}

===Intercurrent diseases===
Several [[intercurrent diseases in pregnancy]] can potentially increase the risk of miscarriage, including diabetes, [[polycystic ovary syndrome]] (PCOS), hypothyroidism, certain infectious diseases, and autoimmune diseases. PCOS may increase the risk of miscarriage.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Two studies suggested treatment with the drug [[metformin]] significantly lowers the rate of miscarriage in women with PCOS,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jakubowicz DJ, Iuorno MJ, Jakubowicz S, Roberts KA, Nestler JE | title = Effects of Metformin on Early Pregnancy Loss in the Polycystic Ovary Syndrome | journal = Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism | volume = 87 | issue = 2 | pages = 524–9 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11836280 | doi = 10.1210/jc.87.2.524 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Khattab S, Mohsen IA, Foutouh IA, Ramadan A, Moaz M, Al-Inany H | title = Metformin reduces abortion in pregnant women with polycystic ovary syndrome | journal = Gynecological Endocrinology | volume = 22 | issue = 12 | pages = 680–4 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17162710 | doi = 10.1080/09513590601010508 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the quality of these studies has been questioned.&lt;ref name="RCOG-PCOS"&gt;{{cite web|last=Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists|title=Long-term consequences of polycystic ovarian syndrome|url=http://www.rcog.org.uk/files/rcog-corp/uploaded-files/GT33_LongTermPCOS.pdf|archive-url=https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20100710113119/http://www.rcog.org.uk/files/rcog-corp/uploaded-files/GT33_LongTermPCOS.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-07-10|website=Green-top Guideline No. 27|publisher=Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists|accessdate=2 July 2013|date=December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metformin treatment in pregnancy has not been shown to be safe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lilja AE, Mathiesen ER | title = Polycystic ovary syndrome and metformin in pregnancy | journal = Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica | volume = 85 | issue = 7 | pages = 861–8 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16817087 | doi = 10.1080/00016340600780441 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists also recommended against use of the drug to prevent miscarriage.&lt;ref name="RCOG-PCOS" /&gt; Thrombophilias or defects in coagulation and bleeding were once thought to be a risk in miscarriage but have been subsequently questioned.{{sfn|Hoffman|page=174}}
Severe cases of [[hypothyroidism]] increase the risk of miscarriage. The effect of milder cases of hypothyroidism on miscarriage rates has not been established. A condition called luteal phase defect (LPD) is a failure of the uterine lining to be fully prepared for pregnancy. This can keep a fertilized egg from implanting or result in miscarriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.womenshealth.gov/pregnancy/you-get-pregnant/trying-conceive/#4|title=Trying to conceive {{!}} womenshealth.gov|website=womenshealth.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-09-11}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Mycoplasma genitalium]]'' infection is associated with increased risk of [[preterm birth]] and miscarriage.&lt;ref name="LisRowhani-Rahbar2015"/&gt;

Infections can increase the risk of a miscarriage: rubella&amp;nbsp;(German measles), cytomegalovirus, bacterial vaginosis, HIV, chlamydia, gonorrhoea,&amp;nbsp;syphilis,&amp;nbsp;and malaria.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

===Immune status===
Autoimmunity is possible cause of recurrent or late-term miscarriages. In the case of an autoimmune-induced miscarriages the woman's body attacks the growing fetus or prevents normal pregnancy progression.&lt;ref name="CarpSelmi2012"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2012|title=The autoimmune bases of infertility and pregnancy loss|journal=J Autoimmun|type=Review|volume=38|issue=2–3|pages=J266–74|doi=10.1016/j.jaut.2011.11.016|pmid=22284905|vauthors=Carp HJ, Selmi C, Shoenfeld Y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2007|title=Female infertility due to abnormal autoimmunity: Frequently overlooked and greatly underappreciated.

===Anatomical defects and trauma===
Fifteen percent of women who have experienced three or more recurring miscarriages have some anatomical defect that prevents the pregnancy from being carried for the entire term.{{sfn|Hoffman|page=181}} The structure of the [[uterus]] has an effect on the ability to carry a child to term. Anatomical differences are common and can be congenital.

In some women, [[cervical incompetence]] or cervical insufficiency occurs with the inability of the cervix to stay closed during the entire pregnancy.&lt;ref name="American College of Obstetricians and 372–9"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; It does not cause first trimester miscarriages. In the second trimester it is associated with an increased risk of miscarriage. It is identified after a premature birth has occurred at about 16–18 weeks into the pregnancy.{{sfn|Hoffman|page=181}} During the second trimester, major trauma can result in a miscarriage.{{sfn|Hoffman|page=172}}

===Smoking===
{{See also|Smoking and pregnancy}}
Tobacco (cigarette) smokers have an increased risk of miscarriage.&lt;ref name="x"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; There is an increased risk regardless of which parent smokes, though the risk is higher when the gestational mother smokes.&lt;ref name="paternal smoking"/&gt;

===Morning sickness===
Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP, or [[morning sickness]]) are associated with a decreased risk. Several possible causes have been suggested for morning sickness but there is still no agreement.&lt;ref name="Kor2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koren|first1=G|title=Treating morning sickness in the United States--changes in prescribing are needed|journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology|date=December 2014|volume=211|issue=6|pages=602–6|pmid=25151184|doi=10.1016/j.ajog.2014.08.017}}&lt;/ref&gt; NVP may represent a defense mechanism which discourages the mother's ingestion of foods that are harmful to the fetus; according to this model, a lower frequency of miscarriage would be an expected consequence of the different food choices made by women experiencing NVP.&lt;ref name=Haviland2016&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FPgWDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA310&amp;dq=nausea+vomiting+pregnancy+defense+mechanism+2017&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjjj9q4yoveAhUKJMAKHbmoAnAQ6AEILDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=nausea%20vomiting%20pregnancy%20defense%20mechanism%202017&amp;f=false|title=Anthropology: The Human Challenge|last=Haviland|first=William A.|last2=Prins|first2=Harald E.

===Chemicals and occupational exposure===
Chemical and [[occupational exposure]]s may have some effect in pregnancy outcomes. A cause and effect relationship almost can never be established. Those chemicals that are implicated in increasing the risk for miscarriage are [[DDT]], [[lead]], [[formaldehyde]], [[arsenic]], [[benzene]] and [[ethylene oxide]]. [[Video display terminal]]s and ultrasound have not been found to have an effect on the rates of miscarriage. In dental offices where [[nitrous oxide]] is used with the absence of [[anesthetic gas scavenging equipment]], there is a greater risk of miscarriage. For women who work with cytotoxic [[antineoplastic chemotherapeutic agent]]s there is a small increased risk of miscarriage. No increased risk for [[cosmetologist]]s has been found.{{sfn|Hoffman|page=272}}

===Other===
Alcohol increases the risk of miscarriage.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Progesterone has not been found to be effective in preventing miscarriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Progestogen for preventing miscarriage; Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|journal = Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue = 10|last=Haas|first=David M|last2=Ramsey|first2=Patrick S|date=2013-10-31|year=|isbn = |pages=CD003511|language=en|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd003511.pub3|pmid = 24173668}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cocaine intoxication|Cocaine]] use increases the rate of miscarriage.&lt;ref name="x"/&gt; Some infections have been associated with miscarriage. These include [[Ureaplasma urealyticum infection|''Ureaplasma urealyticum'']], [[Mycoplasma hominis infection|''Mycoplasma hominis'']], [[Group B streptococcal infection|group B streptococci]], [[HIV/AIDS|HIV-1]], and [[syphilis]]. Infections of [[Chlamydia infection|''Chlamydia trachomatis,'']] [[Campylobacter fetus|''Camphylobacter fetus'']], and ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'' have not been found to be linked to miscarriage.&lt;ref name=Will2013 /&gt;

==Diagnosis==
In the case of blood loss, pain, or both, [[Obstetric ultrasonography|transvaginal ultrasound]] is performed.  If a viable intrauterine pregnancy is not found with ultrasound, blood tests (serial [[human chorionic gonadotropin|βHCG]] tests) can be performed to rule out ectopic pregnancy, which is a life-threatening situation.&lt;ref name="followHCG"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Condous G, Okaro E, Khalid A, Bourne T | title = Do we need to follow up complete miscarriages with serum human chorionic gonadotrophin levels? | journal = BJOG | volume = 112 | issue = 6 | pages = 827–9 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15924545 | doi = 10.1111/j.1471-0528.2004.00542.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bmj&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://us.bestpractice.bmj.com/best-practice/monograph/666.html|title=Miscarriage|last=BMJ Best Practice|first=|date=|website=us.bestpractice.bmj.com|language=en|others=Ida Muslim, Jothi Doraiswamy, Acknowledgements|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If [[hypotension]], [[tachycardia]], and [[anemia]] are discovered, exclusion of an ectopic pregnancy is important.&lt;ref name = bmj/&gt;

A miscarriage may be confirmed by an [[obstetric ultrasound]] and by the examination of the passed tissue. When looking for microscopic [[pathology|pathologic]] symptoms, one looks for the [[products of conception]]. Microscopically, these include [[Chorionic villi|villi]], [[trophoblast]], fetal parts, and background gestational changes in the [[endometrium]]. When chromosomal abnormalities are found in more than one miscarriage, genetic testing of both parents may be done.&lt;ref name="RCOG-recurrent"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcog.org.uk/files/rcog-corp/GTG17recurrentmiscarriage.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130705172612/https://www.rcog.org.uk/files/rcog-corp/GTG17recurrentmiscarriage.pdf |archive-date=July 5, 2013|title=The investigation and treatment of couples with recurrent first-trimester and second-trimester miscarriage |last=Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) |date=April 2011 |publisher=Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) |website=Green-top Guideline No. 17 |accessdate=2 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ultrasound criteria===
A review article in [[The New England Journal of Medicine]] based on a consensus meeting of the Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound in America (SRU) has suggested that miscarriage should be diagnosed only if any of the following criteria are met upon ultrasonography visualization:&lt;ref name="Doubilet2013"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Doubilet PM, Benson CB, Bourne T, Blaivas M, Barnhart KT, Benacerraf BR, Brown DL, Filly RA, Fox JC, Goldstein SR, Kendall JL, Lyons EA, Porter MB, Pretorius DH, Timor-Tritsch IE | title = Diagnostic Criteria for Nonviable Pregnancy Early in the First Trimester | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 369 | issue = 15 | pages = 1443–1451 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24106937 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1056/NEJMra1302417 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classification===
A threatened miscarriage describes any bleeding during pregnancy, prior to viability, that has yet to be assessed.. At investigation it may be found that the fetus remains viable and the pregnancy continues without further problems.{{Medical citation needed|date=November 2017}}

An [[Anembryonic gestation|anembryonic pregnancy]] (also called an "empty sac" or "blighted ovum") is a condition where the [[gestational sac]] develops normally, while the embryonic part of the pregnancy is either absent or stops growing very early. This accounts for approximately half of miscarriages. All other miscarriages are classified as embryonic miscarriages, meaning that there is an embryo present in the gestational sac. Half of embryonic miscarriages have [[aneuploidy]] (an abnormal number of chromosomes).&lt;ref name=Will2013 /&gt;

An inevitable miscarriage occurs when the cervix has already dilated,&lt;ref name="isbn 0-07-144874-8"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Latha |last1=Stead |first2=S. Matthew |last2=Stead |first3=Matthew |last3=Kaufman|first4=Luis |last4=Suarez |title=First Aid for The Obstetrics and Gynecology Clerkship |publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York |year=2006 |page=138 |isbn=978-0-07-144874-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the fetus has yet to be expelled. This usually will progress to a complete miscarriage. The fetus may or may not have cardiac activity.

[[File:Complete miscarriage.jpg|thumb|left|[[Transvaginal ultrasonography]] after an episode of heavy bleeding in an intrauterine pregnancy that had been confirmed by a previous ultrasononography. There is some widening between the [[uterine wall]]s, but no sign of any [[gestational sac]], thus in this case being diagnostic of a complete miscarriage.]] A complete miscarriage is when all products of conception have been expelled; these may include the [[trophoblast]], [[chorionic villi]], [[gestational sac]], [[yolk sac]], and [[fetal pole]] ([[embryo]]); or later in pregnancy the [[fetus]], [[umbilical cord]], [[placenta]], amniotic fluid, and [[amniotic sac|amniotic membrane]]. The presence of a [[pregnancy test]] that is still positive as well as an empty uterus upon [[transvaginal ultrasonography]] does, however, fulfill the definition of [[pregnancy of unknown location]]. Therefore, there may be a need for follow-up pregnancy tests to ensure that there is no remaining pregnancy, including an ectopic pregnancy. [[File:Incomplete miscarriage.jpg|thumb|[[Transvaginal ultrasonography]], with some products of conception in the [[cervix]] (to the left in the image) and remnants of a [[gestational sac]] by the [[fundus of the uterus|fundus]] (to the right in the image), indicating an incomplete miscarriage.]] An incomplete miscarriage occurs when some [[products of conception]] have been passed, but some remains inside the uterus.&lt;ref name="MedlinePlus"&gt;{{cite web |author=MedlinePlus | authorlink =MedlinePlus | date = October 25, 2004 |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000904.htm | title =Abortion – incomplete | website=Medical Encyclopedia| accessdate =May 24, 2006 |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20060425090648/https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000904.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = April 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an increased distance between the [[uterine wall]]s on transvaginal ultrasonography may also simply be an increased endometrial thickness and/or a [[polyp]]. The use of a Doppler ultrasound may be better in confirming the presence of significant retained products of conception in the uterine cavity.&lt;ref name="kirk2013"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kirk E, Bottomley C, Bourne T | title = Diagnosing ectopic pregnancy and current concepts in the management of pregnancy of unknown location | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 250–61 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24101604 | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmt047 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In cases of uncertainty, [[ectopic pregnancy]] must be excluded using techniques like serial [[beta-hCG]] measurements.&lt;ref name="kirk2013" /&gt;
{{anchor|missed}}[[File:Delayed or missed miscarriage at 13 weeks.gif|thumb|left|160px|A 13-week fetus without cardiac activity located in the uterus (delayed or missed miscarriage)]]A missed miscarriage is when the embryo or fetus has died, but a miscarriage has not yet occurred.  It is also referred to as delayed miscarriage, silent miscarriage, or missed abortion.&lt;ref name="Farquharson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hutchon-1997"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hutchon DJ | title = Missed abortion versus delayed miscarriage | journal = British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology | volume = 104 | issue = 6 | pages = 753 | date = June 1997 | pmid = 9197887 | doi = 10.1111/j.1471-0528.1997.tb11994.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Septic abortion|septic miscarriage]] occurs when the tissue from a missed or incomplete miscarriage becomes infected, which carries the risk of spreading infection ([[septicaemia]]) and can be fatal.&lt;ref name=Will2013 /&gt;

[[Recurrent miscarriage]] ("recurrent pregnancy loss" (RPL) or "habitual abortion") is the occurrence of multiple consecutive miscarriages; the exact number used to diagnose recurrent miscarriage varies.&lt;ref name=Will2013 /&gt; If the proportion of pregnancies ending in miscarriage is 15% and assuming that miscarriages are independent events,&lt;ref name="rcog2003" /&gt; then the probability of two consecutive miscarriages is 2.25% and the probability of three consecutive miscarriages is 0.34%. The occurrence of recurrent pregnancy loss is 1%.&lt;ref name="rcog2003"&gt;{{cite web |author=Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists |authorlink=Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists |date=May 2003 |title=The investigation and treatment of couples with recurrent miscarriage |website=Green-top Guideline No. 17 |url=http://www.rcog.org.uk/womens-health/clinical-guidance/investigation-and-treatment-couples-recurrent-miscarriage-green-top- |accessdate=October 20, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104235744/http://www.rcog.org.uk/womens-health/clinical-guidance/investigation-and-treatment-couples-recurrent-miscarriage-green-top- |archivedate=January 4, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A large majority (85%) of those who have had two miscarriages will conceive and carry normally afterward.

The physical symptoms of a miscarriage vary according to the length of pregnancy, though most miscarriages cause pain or cramping. The size of blood clots and pregnancy tissue that are passed become larger with longer gestations. After 13 weeks' gestation, there is a higher risk of placenta retention.&lt;ref name="ausbirth"&gt;{{cite web| date=October 2004| title=miscarriage| url=http://www.birth.com.au/Info.asp?class=6620&amp;page=13| accessdate=3 January 2014| author=Home page at www.birth.com.au| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201112940/http://www.birth.com.au/Info.asp?class=6620&amp;page=13| archivedate=December 1, 2008| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
Prevention of a miscarriage can sometimes be accomplished by decreasing risk factors.&lt;ref name="NIH2013Pre" /&gt; This may include good [[prenatal care]], avoiding drugs and alcohol, preventing infectious diseases, and avoiding x-rays.&lt;ref name="NIH2013Pre" /&gt; Identifying the cause of the miscarriage may help prevent future pregnancy loss, especially in cases of recurrent miscarriage. Often there is little a person can do to prevent a miscarriage.&lt;ref name="NIH2013Pre" /&gt; Vitamin supplementation before or during pregnancy has not been found to affect the risk of miscarriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|date=|year=2016|title=Vitamin supplementation for preventing miscarriage|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=5|issue=5|pages=CD004073|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004073.pub4|pmid=27150280|vauthors=Balogun OO, da Silva Lopes K, Ota E, Takemoto Y, Rumbold A, Takegata M, Mori R|deadurl=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modifiable risk factors===
Maintaining a healthy weight and good pre-natal care can reduce the risk of miscarriage.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Some risk factors can be minimized by avoiding the following:
*Smoking&lt;ref name="x"/&gt;&lt;ref name="paternal smoking"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;
*Cocaine use&lt;ref name="x"/&gt;
*Alcohol&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;
*Poor nutrition
*Occupational exposure to agents that can cause miscarriage{{sfn|Hoffman|page=272}}
*Medications associated with miscarriage{{sfn|Hoffman|page=72}}&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;
*Drug abuse&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

==Management==
Women who miscarry early in their pregnancy usually do not require any subsequent medical treatment but they can benefit from support and counseling.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jeve"/&gt; Most early miscarriages will complete on their own; in other cases, medication treatment or aspiration of the products of conception can be used to remove remaining tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.babycentre.co.uk/a1039515/understanding-early-miscarriage#ixzz2x52G1IYu |title=Understanding early miscarriage |date=January 2017 |accessdate=June 4, 2017 |publisher=BabyCenter, L.L.C. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905095051/https://www.babycentre.co.uk/a1039515/understanding-early-miscarriage#ixzz2x52G1IYu |archivedate=September 5, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[bed rest]] has been advocated to prevent miscarriage, this has not been found to be of benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Christina A.|last1=McCall|first2=David A.|last2=Grimes|first3=Anne Drapkin|last3=Lyerly|title="Therapeutic" bed rest in pregnancy: unethical and unsupported by data|journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology|date=1 June 2013|issn=1873-233X|pages=1305–1308|volume=121|issue=6|pmid=23812466|doi=10.1097/AOG.0b013e318293f12f}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hoffman|page = 176}} Those who are or who have experienced an abortion benefit from the use of careful medical language.

It is not acceptable to use the term "abortion" for miscarriage, despite its historical clinical prevalence.

"Miscarriage" (qualified by adjectives such as recurrent, delayed, early, late, etc.) is easily understood and well accepted.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methods===
No treatment is necessary for a diagnosis of complete miscarriage (so long as ectopic pregnancy is ruled out). In cases of an incomplete miscarriage, empty sac, or missed abortion there are three treatment options: watchful waiting, medical management, and surgical treatment. With no treatment ([[watchful waiting]]), most miscarriages (65–80%) will pass naturally within two to six weeks.&lt;ref name="afp"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kripke C | title = Expectant management vs. surgical treatment for miscarriage | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 74 | issue = 7 | pages = 1125–6 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17039747 | url = http://www.aafp.org/afp/2006/1001/p1125.html | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140525195924/http://www.aafp.org/afp/2006/1001/p1125.html | archivedate = May 25, 2014 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This treatment avoids the possible side effects and complications of medications and surgery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tang OS, Ho PC | title = The use of misoprostol for early pregnancy failure | journal = Current Opinion in Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 18 | issue = 6 | pages = 581–6 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17099326 | doi = 10.1097/GCO.0b013e32800feedb }}&lt;/ref&gt; but increases the risk of mild bleeding, need for unplanned surgical treatment, and incomplete miscarriage. Medical treatment usually consists of using [[misoprostol]] (a [[prostaglandin]]) to contract the uterus, expelling remaining tissue out of the cervix. This works within a few days in 95% of cases.&lt;ref name="afp" /&gt;  Vacuum aspiration or sharp curettage can be used, though vacuum aspiration is lower-risk and more common.&lt;ref name="afp" /&gt;

===Delayed and incomplete miscarriage===
In delayed or incomplete miscarriage, treatment depends on the amount of tissue remaining in the uterus. Treatment can include surgical removal of the tissue with [[vacuum aspiration]] or [[misoprostol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK333519/|title=Surgery for Family Planning, Abortion, and Postabortion Care|last=Babigumira|first=Joseph B.|last2=Vlassoff|first2=Michael|last3=Ahimbisibwe|first3=Asa|last4=Stergachis|first4=Andy|date=2015-01-01|publisher=The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank|isbn=9781464803468|editor-last=Debas|editor-first=Haile T.|location=Washington (DC)|pmid=26741012|editor-last2=Donkor|editor-first2=Peter|editor-last3=Gawande|editor-first3=Atul|editor-last4=Jamison|editor-first4=Dean T.|editor-last5=Kruk|editor-first5=Margaret E.|editor-last6=Mock|editor-first6=Charles N.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910181311/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK333519/|archivedate=September 10, 2017|df=mdy-all|doi=10.1596/978-1-4648-0346-8_ch7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies looking at the methods of anaesthesia for surgical management of incomplete miscarriage have not shown that any adaptation from normal practice is beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Calvache|first1=JA|last2=Delgado-Noguera|first2=MF|last3=Lesaffre|first3=E|last4=Stolker|first4=RJ|title=Anaesthesia for evacuation of incomplete miscarriage|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=18 April 2012|issue=4|pages=CD008681|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008681.pub2|pmid=22513963}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some organizations recommend delaying sexual relations immediately after a miscarriage to prevent [[infection]].&lt;ref name="misorg" /&gt; However, there is not sufficient evidence for the routine use of antibiotic to try to avoid infection in incomplete abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=May|first1=W|last2=Gülmezoglu|first2=AM|last3=Ba-Thike|first3=K|title=Antibiotics for incomplete abortion|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=17 October 2007|issue=4|pages=CD001779|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001779.pub2|pmid=17943756}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An induced abortion may be performed by a physician for women who do not want to continue the pregnancy.&lt;ref name="GLOWM_Late"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Borgatta|first1=L|date=December 2014|title=Labor Induction Termination of Pregnancy|url=http://www.glowm.com/section_view/heading/Labor%20Induction%20Termination%20of%20Pregnancy/item/443|journal=Global Library of Women's Medicine|volume=GLOWM.10444|doi=10.3843/GLOWM.10444|accessdate=25 September 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924082507/http://www.glowm.com/section_view/heading/Labor%20Induction%20Termination%20of%20Pregnancy/item/443|archivedate=September 24, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Self-induced abortion]] performed by a woman or non-medical personnel is extremely dangerous and is still a cause of maternal mortality in some countries.

===Support===
Organizations exist that provide information and counseling to help those who have had a miscarriage.&lt;ref name=uk/&gt; Family and friends often conduct a memorial or burial service. Hospitals also can provide support and help memorialize the event. Depending on locale others desire to have a private ceremony.&lt;ref name=uk/&gt; Providing appropriate support with frequent discussions and sympathetic counseling are part of evaluation and treatment.

===Subsequent pregnancies===
Some parents want to try to have a baby very soon after the miscarriage. The decision of trying to become pregnant again can be difficult. Reasons exist that may prompt parents to consider another pregnancy. For older mothers, there may be some sense of urgency. Other parents are optimistic that future pregnancies are likely to be successful. Many are hesitant and want to know about the risk of having another or more miscarriages. Some clinicians recommend that the women have one [[menstrual cycle]] before attempting another pregnancy. This is because the date of conception may be hard to determine. Also, the first menstrual cycle after a miscarriage can be much longer or shorter than expected. Parents may be advised to wait even longer if they have experienced late miscarriage or [[molar pregnancy]], or are undergoing tests. Some parents wait for six months based upon recommendations from their health care provider.&lt;ref name="misorg"/&gt;

The risks of having another miscarriage vary according to the cause. The risk of having another miscarriage after a molar pregnancy is very low. The risk of another miscarriage is highest after the third miscarriage. Pre-conception care is available in some locales.&lt;ref name="misorg" /&gt;

===Later cardiovascular disease===
There is a significant association between miscarriage and later development of [[coronary artery disease]], but not of [[cerebrovascular disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Oliver-Williams CT, Heydon EE, Smith GC, Wood AM | title = Miscarriage and future maternal cardiovascular disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Heart | volume = 99 | issue = 22 | pages = 1636–1644 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23539554 | pmc = 3812894 | doi = 10.1136/heartjnl-2012-303237 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hoffman|page = 172}}

==Epidemiology==
Among women who know they are pregnant, the miscarriage rate is roughly 10% to 20%, while rates among all [[Fertilisation|fertilized zygotes]] are around 30% to 50%.&lt;ref name="John2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NIH2013Epi" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Will2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name="jeve" /&gt; A 2012 review found the risk of miscarriage between 5 and 20 weeks from 11% to 22%.&lt;ref name=Avalos-2012 /&gt; Up to the 13th week of pregnancy, the risk of miscarriage each week was around 2%, dropping to 1% in week 14 and reducing slowly between 14 and 20 weeks.&lt;ref name=Avalos-2012 /&gt;

The precise rate is not known because a large number of miscarriages occur before pregnancies become established and before the woman is aware they are pregnant.&lt;ref name="Avalos-2012"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ammon Avalos L, Galindo C, Li DK | title = A systematic review to calculate background miscarriage rates using life table analysis | journal = Birth Defects Research.

Most affected women and family members refer to miscarriage as the loss of a baby, rather than an embryo or fetus, and healthcare providers are expected to respect and use the language that the person chooses.&lt;ref name="Chris2014" /&gt; Clinical terms can suggest blame, increase distress, and even cause anger. Terms that are known to cause distress in those experiencing miscarriage include:

* ''abortion'' (including ''spontaneous abortion'') rather than miscarriage, 
* ''habitual aborter'' rather than a woman experiencing [[recurrent pregnancy loss]], 
* ''products of conception'' rather than [[baby]], 
* ''blighted ovum'' rather than early pregnancy loss or delayed miscarriage, 
* ''cervical incompetence'' rather than [[cervical weakness]], and 
* ''evacuation of retained products of conception'' (ERPC) rather than [[surgical management of miscarriage]].&lt;ref name="Chris2014" /&gt;

''Pregnancy loss'' is a broad term that describes miscarriage, ectopic and molar pregnancies.&lt;ref name="Chris2014" /&gt; The term ''[[fetal death]]'' applies variably in different countries and contexts, sometimes incorporating weight, and gestational age from 16 weeks in Norway, 20 weeks in the US and Australia, 24 weeks in the UK to 26 weeks in Italy and Spain.&lt;ref name="Mohangoo-2013"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mohangoo AD, Blondel B, Gissler M, Velebil P, Macfarlane A, Zeitlin J | title = International comparisons of fetal and neonatal mortality rates in high-income countries: should exclusion thresholds be based on birth weight or gestational age? | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 8 | issue = 5 | pages = e64869 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23700489 | pmc = 3658983 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0064869 | bibcode = 2013PLoSO...864869M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AIHW-2012"&gt;{{cite web|last=Li|first=Z|title=Australia's Mothers and Babies 2010|url=http://www.aihw.gov.au/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=60129542372|website=Perinatal statistics series no. 27.

==History==
The medical terminology applied to experiences during early pregnancy has changed over time.&lt;ref name=pmid23429567&gt;{{cite journal | author = Moscrop A | title = 'Miscarriage or abortion?'

Some medical authors advocated change to use of ''miscarriage'' instead of ''spontaneous abortion'' because they argued this would be more respectful and help ease a distressing experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Beard RW, Mowbray JF, Pinker GD | title = Miscarriage or abortion | journal = Lancet | volume = 2 | issue = 8464 | pages = 1122–3 | year = 1985 | pmid = 2865589 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(85)90709-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hutchon DJ, Cooper S | title = Terminology for early pregnancy loss must be changed | journal = BMJ | volume = 317 | issue = 7165 | pages = 1081 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9774309 | pmc = 1114078 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.317.7165.1081 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|date=October 2017}} The change was being recommended by some in the profession in Britain in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name=Hutchon-1998&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hutchon DJ, Cooper S | title = Terminology for early pregnancy loss must be changed | journal = BMJ (Clinical Research Ed.) | volume = 317 | issue = 7165 | pages = 1081 | date = Oct 17, 1998 | pmid = 9774309 | pmc = 1114078 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.317.7165.1081 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) published a paper aiming to facilitate a revision of nomenclature used to describe early pregnancy events.&lt;ref name=Farquharson&gt;{{cite journal | author = Farquharson RG, Jauniaux E, Exalto N | title = Updated and revised nomenclature for description of early pregnancy events | journal = Human Reproduction | volume = 20 | issue = 11 | pages = 3008–11 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16006453 | doi = 10.1093/humrep/dei167 | author4 = ESHRE Special Interest Group for Early Pregnancy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==
Society's reactions to miscarriage changed over time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; &amp;nbsp;In the early 20th century, the focus was on the mother's physical health and the difficulties and disabilities that miscarriage could produce.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Other reactions, such as the expense of medical treatments and relief at ending an unwanted pregnancy, were also heard.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the 1940s and 1950s, people were more likely to express relief, not because the miscarriage ended an unwanted or mistimed pregnancy, but because people believed that miscarriages were primarily caused by birth defects, and miscarrying meant that the family would not raise a child with disabilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The dominant attitude in the mid-century was that a miscarriage, although temporarily distressing, was a blessing in disguise for the family, and that another pregnancy and a healthier baby would soon follow, especially if women trusted physicians and reduced their anxieties.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Media articles were illustrated with pictures of babies, and magazine articles about miscarriage ended by introducing the healthy baby—usually a boy—that had shortly followed it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Beginning in the 1980s, miscarriage in the US was primarily framed in terms of the individual woman's personal emotional reaction, and especially her grief over a tragic outcome.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The subject was portrayed in the media with images of an empty crib or an isolated, grieving woman, and stories about miscarriage were published in general-interest media outlets, not just [[women's magazines]] or health magazines.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Family members were encouraged to grieve, to memorialize their losses through funerals and other rituals, and to think of themselves as being parents.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; &amp;nbsp;This shift to recognizing these emotional responses was partly due to medical and political successes, which created an expectation that pregnancies are typically planned and safe, and to women's demands that their emotional reactions no longer be dismissed by the medical establishments.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; &amp;nbsp;It also reinforces the [[Pro-Life movement|pro-life movement's]] belief that human life begins at conception or early in pregnancy, and that [[Pronatalism|motherhood is a desirable life goal]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The modern one-size-fits-all model of grief does not fit every woman's experience, and an expectation to [[Performativity|perform]] grief creates unnecessary burdens for some women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The reframing of miscarriage as a private emotional experience brought less awareness of miscarriage and a sense of silence around the subject, especially compared to the public discussion of miscarriage during campaigns for access to birth control during the early 20th century, or the public campaigns to prevent miscarriages, stillbirths, and infant deaths by reducing industrial pollution during the 1970s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thecut.com/2018/04/the-history-of-talking-about-miscarriage.html|title=The History of Talking About Miscarriage|last=Blei|first=Daniela|work=The Cut|access-date=2018-04-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In places where induced abortion is illegal or carries social stigma, suspicion may surround miscarriage, complicating an already sensitive issue.

In the 1960s, the use of the word ''miscarriage'' in Britain (instead of ''spontaneous abortion'') occurred after changes in legislation.

Developments in ultrasound technology (in the early 1980s) allowed them to identify earlier miscarriages.&lt;ref name="pmid23429567" /&gt;

According to French statutes, an infant born before the age of viability, determined to be 28 weeks, is not registered as a 'child'. If birth occurs after this, the infant is granted a certificate that allows women who have given birth to a stillborn child, to have a symbolic record of that child. This certificate can include a registered and given name with the purpose of allowing a funeral and acknowledgement of the event.&lt;ref&gt;Communiqué de presse de [[Rachida Dati]], Garde des Sceaux, ministre de la Justice et de [[Roselyne Bachelot|Roselyne Bachelot-Narquin]], ministre de la Santé, de la Jeunesse, des Sports et de la Vie associative, « Possibilité de demande d’un acte d’enfant sans vie », 22 août 2008, [http://www.sante.gouv.fr/possibilite-de-demande-d-un-acte-d-enfant-sans-vie.html lire en ligne]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.service-public.fr/|title=Accueil Particuliers {{!}} service-public.fr|website=www.service-public.fr|language=fr|access-date=2017-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Décret n°74-449 du 15 mai 1974 relatif au livret de famille et à l'information des futurs époux sur le droit de la famille - Article 9|date=15 May 1974|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexteArticle.do?idArticle=LEGIARTI000006285245&amp;cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000328986|accessdate=2017-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other animals==
{{anchor|In animals}}
Miscarriage occurs in all animals that experience pregnancy, though in such contexts it is more commonly referred to as a "spontaneous abortion" (the two terms are synonymous). There are a variety of known risk factors in non-human animals. For example, in sheep, miscarriage may be caused by crowding through doors, or being chased by dogs.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, James.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=RXMuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA124&amp;lpg=PA124&amp;dq=abortion+and+husbandry&amp;ct=result#PPA124,M1 Sheep Husbandry in Canada] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924203629/https://books.google.com/books?id=RXMuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA124&amp;lpg=PA124&amp;dq=abortion+and+husbandry&amp;ct=result |date=September 24, 2015 }}'', page 124 (1911).&lt;/ref&gt; In cows, spontaneous abortion may be caused by contagious disease, such as [[brucellosis]] or ''[[Campylobacter]]'', but often can be controlled by vaccination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/B/BeefCattleAndBeefProduction/ManagementAndHusbandryOfBeefCattle/en "Beef cattle and Beef production: Management and Husbandry of Beef Cattle"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090101142401/http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/B/BeefCattleAndBeefProduction/ManagementAndHusbandryOfBeefCattle/en |date=January 1, 2009 }}, ''Encyclopaedia of New Zealand'' (1966).&lt;/ref&gt;  In many species of sharks and rays, stress induced miscarriage occurs frequently on capture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adams|first1=Kye R.|last2=Fetterplace|first2=Lachlan C.|last3=Davis|first3=Andrew R.|last4=Taylor|first4=Matthew D.|last5=Knott|first5=Nathan A.|title=Sharks, rays and abortion: The prevalence of capture-induced parturition in elasmobranchs|journal=Biological Conservation|date=January 2018|volume=217|pages=11–27|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2017.10.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other diseases are also known to make animals susceptible to miscarriage. Spontaneous abortion occurs in pregnant [[prairie vole]]s when their mate is removed and they are exposed to a new male,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fraser-Smith AC | title = Male-induced pregnancy termination in the prairie vole, Microtus ochrogaster | journal = Science | volume = 187 | issue = 4182 | pages = 1211–3 | year = 1975 | pmid = 1114340 | doi = 10.1126/science.1114340 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an example of the [[Bruce effect]], although this effect is seen less in wild populations than in the laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00265-002-0484-0 |title=A field test of the Bruce effect in the monogamous prairie vole (''Microtus ochrogaster'') |year=2002 |last1=Mahady |first1=Scott |last2=Wolff |first2=Jerry |journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=31–7 |jstor=4602102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Female mice who had spontaneous abortions showed a sharp rise in the amount of time spent with unfamiliar males preceding the abortion than those who did not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Becker SD, Hurst JL | title = Female behaviour plays a critical role in controlling murine pregnancy block | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B | volume = 276 | issue = 1662 | pages = 1723–9 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19324836 | pmc = 2660991 | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2008.1780 | jstor = 30245000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Plagiarism''' is the "wrongful appropriation" and "stealing and publication" of another [[author]]'s "language, thoughts, ideas, or expressions" and the representation of them as one's own [[original work]].&lt;ref name="RandomHouse95"&gt;From the 1995 ''[[Random House Dictionary of the English Language|Random House Compact Unabridged Dictionary]]'': &lt;blockquote&gt;use or close imitation of the language and thoughts of another author and the representation of them as one's own original work&lt;/blockquote&gt; qtd. in {{cite book | title = Library plagiarism policies | first = Vera | last= Stepchyshyn | first2 = Robert S. |last2= Nelson | publisher = Assoc. of College &amp; Resrch Libraries | year = 2007 | isbn = 0-8389-8416-9 | page = 65 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OHamIn5dPR8C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OEDdef"&gt;From the [[Oxford English Dictionary]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;The action or practice of taking someone else's work, idea, etc., and passing it off as one's own; literary theft.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Plagiarism is considered [[academic dishonesty]] and a breach of [[journalistic ethics]]. It is subject to sanctions such as penalties, suspension, and even [[Expulsion (academia)|expulsion]] from school or work. Recently, cases of "extreme plagiarism" have been identified in academia.&lt;ref name="O'Connor2015"&gt;O'Connor, Z (2015) ''Extreme plagiarism: The rise of the e-Idiot?'', International Journal of Learning in Higher Education, 20 (1), pp1-11. {{ISSN|2327-7955}} [https://www.academia.edu/9975666/Extreme_plagiarism_The_rise_of_the_e-Idiot_2015_]&lt;/ref&gt; The modern concept of plagiarism as immoral and originality as an [[Ideal (ethics)|ideal]] emerged in Europe in the 18th century, particularly with the [[Romantic movement]].

Plagiarism is not in itself a [[crime]], but can constitute [[copyright infringement]]. In academia and industry, it is a serious [[Ethics|ethical]] offense.&lt;ref name="Lynch02" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SSRN315562" /&gt; Plagiarism and copyright infringement overlap to a considerable extent, but they are not equivalent concepts, and many types of plagiarism do not constitute copyright infringement, which is defined by copyright law and may be adjudicated by courts. Plagiarism is not defined or punished by law, but rather by institutions (including professional associations, educational institutions, and commercial entities, such as publishing companies).

== Etymology ==
In the 1st century, the use of the Latin word ''plagiarius'' (literally "kidnapper") to denote stealing someone else's work was pioneered by the Roman poet [[Martial]], who complained that another poet had "kidnapped his verses". ''Plagiary'', a derivative of ''plagiarus'', was introduced into English in 1601 by dramatist [[Ben Jonson]] during the [[Jacobean Era]] to describe someone guilty of literary theft.&lt;ref name="Lynch02"&gt;Lynch (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Valpy05"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Valpy | first=Francis Edward Jackson | date=2005 | title=Etymological Dictionary of the Latin Language | page=345 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fsWzg7rTEa4C&amp;pg=PA345&amp;dq=etymology+plaga+net&amp;ei=JVxXSq2_GIiEywS8mPSyBw | access-date= | quote=entry for ''plagium'', quotation: "the crime of kidnapping."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The derived form ''plagiarism'' was introduced into English around 1620.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=plagiarism |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=April 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Latin]] ''plagiārius'', "kidnapper", and ''plagium'', "kidnapping", have the root ''plaga'' ("snare", "net"), based on the [[Proto-Indo-European root|Indo-European root]] ''*-plak'', "to weave" (seen for instance in [[Greek language|Greek]] ''plekein'', Bulgarian "плета" ''pleta'', and Latin ''plectere'', all meaning "to weave").

== Legal aspects ==
Although plagiarism in some contexts is considered theft or stealing, the concept does not exist in a legal sense, although the use of someone else's work in order to gain academic credit may meet some legal definitions of [[fraud]].&lt;ref name="link.springer.com"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-981-287-098-8_38|title=Handbook of Academic Integrity|first1=Philip M.|last1=Newton|first2=Christopher|last2=Lang|editor-first=Tracey|editor-last=Bretag|date=1 January 2016|publisher=Springer Singapore|pages=249–271|via=link.springer.com|doi=10.1007/978-981-287-098-8_38}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Plagiarism" specifically is not mentioned in any current statute, either [[Criminal law|criminal]] or [[Civil law (common law)|civil]].&lt;ref name="Lands99"&gt;Lands, Robert (1999) [http://www.theaoi.com/articles/texts/1999/decplagiarism.html ''Plagiarism is no Crime''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101213001/http://www.theaoi.com/articles/texts/1999/decplagiarism.html |date=2011-01-01 }} published by The Association of Illustrators (AOI), December 1999.

Plagiarism is not the same as [[copyright infringement]]. While both terms may apply to a particular act, they are different concepts, and false claims of authorship generally constitute plagiarism regardless of whether the material is protected by copyright. Copyright infringement is a violation of the rights of a copyright holder, when material whose use is restricted by copyright is used without consent. Plagiarism, in contrast, is concerned with the unearned increment to the plagiarizing author's reputation, or the obtaining of academic credit, that is achieved through false claims of authorship. Thus, plagiarism is considered a moral offense against the plagiarist's audience (for example, a reader, listener, or teacher).

Plagiarism is also considered a moral offense against anyone who has provided the plagiarist with a benefit in exchange for what is specifically supposed to be original content (for example, the plagiarist's publisher, employer, or teacher). In such cases,  acts of plagiarism may sometimes also form part of a claim for [[breach of contract|breach]] of the plagiarist's contract, or, if done knowingly, for a [[Tort|civil wrong]].

== In academia and journalism ==
Within [[academia]], plagiarism by students, professors, or researchers is considered [[academic dishonesty]] or academic fraud, and offenders are subject to academic censure, up to and including [[Expulsion (academia)|expulsion]]. Some institutions use [[Plagiarism detection|plagiarism detection software]] to uncover potential plagiarism and to deter students from plagiarizing. Some universities address the issue of academic integrity by providing students with thorough orientations, required writing courses, and clearly articulated honor codes{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}. Indeed, there is a virtually uniform understanding among college students that plagiarism is wrong{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}. Nevertheless, each year students are brought before their institutions’ disciplinary boards on charges that they have misused sources in their schoolwork."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lipson|first=Abigail|year=2003|title=The Responsible Plagiarist|url=|journal=About Campus|volume=8- issue 3|pages=7|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the practice of plagiarizing by use of sufficient word substitutions to elude detection software, known as [[rogeting]], has rapidly evolved as students and unethical academics seek to stay ahead of detection software.&lt;ref name=Grove&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grove|first1=Jack|title=Sinister buttocks?

An extreme form of plagiarism, known as [[contract cheating]] involves students paying someone else, such as an [[essay mill]], to do their work for them.&lt;ref name="link.springer.com" /&gt;

In [[journalism]], plagiarism is considered a breach of [[journalistic ethics]], and reporters caught plagiarizing typically face disciplinary measures ranging from suspension to termination of employment{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}. Some individuals caught plagiarizing in academic or journalistic contexts claim that they plagiarized unintentionally, by failing to include [[quotation]]s or give the appropriate [[citation]]. While plagiarism in scholarship and journalism has a centuries-old history, the development of the [[Internet]], where articles appear as electronic text, has made the physical act of copying the work of others much easier.&lt;ref&gt;Susan D. Blum, ''My Word!: Plagiarism and College Culture'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Academia ===
[[File:Example-of-Article-Plagiarism-Diagram.png|thumb|One form of academic plagiarism involves appropriating a published article and modifying it slightly to avoid suspicion.]] No universally adopted definition of academic plagiarism exists&lt;ref&gt;Eaton, S. E. (2017). [https://prism.ucalgary.ca/bitstream/handle/1880/106472/Eaton-2017.pdf?sequence=2 Comparative Analysis of Institutional Policy Definitions of Plagiarism: A Pan-Canadian University Study]. ''Interchange: A Quarterly Review of Education, 48''(3), 271-281. doi:10.1007/s10780-017-9300-7&lt;/ref&gt;; however, this section provides several definitions to exemplify the most common characteristics of academic plagiarism.

According to Bela Gipp&lt;ref name="Gipp14"&gt;{{cite book | last = Gipp | first = Bela |
url=https://www.springer.com/springer+vieweg/it+%26+informatik/k%C3%BCnstliche+intelligenz/book/978-3-658-06393-1 |title=Citation-based Plagiarism Detection: Detecting Disguised and Cross-language Plagiarism using Citation Pattern Analysis | publisher = Springer Vieweg | year = 2014 | isbn = 978-3-658-06393-1}} p.10&lt;/ref&gt;  academic plagiarism encompasses:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The use of ideas, concepts, words, or structures &lt;br /&gt; without appropriately acknowledging the source &lt;br /&gt; to benefit in a setting where originality is expected."&lt;ref name="Gipp14" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The definition by B. Gipp is an abridged version of Teddi Fishman's definition of plagiarism, which proposed five elements characteristic of plagiarism.&lt;ref name="Fishman09"&gt;{{cite news | last = Fishman | first = Teddi | url = http://www.bmartin.cc/pubs/09-4apcei/4apcei-Fishman.pdf |format=PDF|title=We know it when we see it is not good enough:  toward a standard definition of plagiarism that transcends theft, fraud, and copyright | publisher = Proceedings of the 4th Asia Pacific Conference on Educational Integrity |date=Sep 28–30, 2009}} p.5&lt;/ref&gt; According to T. Fishman, plagiarism occurs when someone:
#  Uses words, ideas, or work products
#  Attributable to another identifiable person or source
#  Without attributing the work to the source from which it was obtained
#  In a situation in which there is a legitimate expectation of original authorship
#  In order to obtain some benefit, credit, or gain which need not be monetary&lt;ref name="Fishman09" /&gt;

Furthermore, plagiarism is defined differently among institutions of higher learning and universities:

* [[Stanford University|Stanford]] sees plagiarism as the "use, without giving reasonable and appropriate credit to or acknowledging the author or source, of another person's original work, whether such work is made up of code, formulas, ideas, language, research, strategies, writing or other form."&lt;ref&gt;[http://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/judicialaffairs/integrity/plagiarism "What is Plagiarism"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026061453/http://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/judicialaffairs/integrity/plagiarism |date=2012-10-26 }}. Stanford University. 2012-07-27.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Yale University|Yale]] views plagiarism as the "... use of another's work, words, or ideas without attribution," which includes "... using a source's language without quoting, using information from a source without attribution, and paraphrasing a source in a form that stays too close to the original."
* [[Princeton University|Princeton]] perceives plagiarism as the "deliberate" use of "someone else's language, ideas, or other original (not common-knowledge) material without acknowledging its source."&lt;ref&gt;[http://wpacouncil.org/positions/WPAplagiarism.pdf "Defining and Avoiding Plagiarism: The WPA Statement on Best Practices"]. Princeton University. 2012-07-27&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Oxford College of Emory University]] characterizes plagiarism as the use of "a writer's ideas or phraseology without giving due credit."&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxford.emory.edu/audiences/current_students/Academic/academic-success/student-honor-code/ "Student Honor Code"]. Emory: Oxford College. 2012-07-27.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Brown University|Brown]] defines plagiarism as "... appropriating another person's ideas or words (spoken or written) without attributing those word or ideas to their true source."&lt;ref&gt;[http://dl.lib.brown.edu/libweb/plagiarism.php "What is plagiarism?"]. Brown University Library. 2012-07-27&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[United States Naval Academy|The U.S. Naval Academy]] defines plagiarism as "the use of the words, information, insights, or ideas of another without crediting that person through proper citation."&lt;ref&gt;[https://libguides.usna.edu/c.php?g=410493&amp;p=2795948 USNA Statements on Plagiarism - Avoiding Plagiarism] US Naval Academy, Retrieved April 5, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Common forms of student plagiarism ====

According to a 2015 survey of teachers and professors by [[Turnitin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Plagiarism Spectrum |url=http://go.turnitin.com/paper/plagiarism-spectrum |publisher=Turnitin |accessdate=7 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are 10 main forms of plagiarism that students commit:
&lt;!--THERE ARE PUBLISHED WORKS ON THIS, WHY ARE WE CITING THIS LOCAL UNIVERSITY WEB INFORMATION? SEE LIPSON'S WORK AT https://www.amazon.com/Doing-Honest-Work-College-Plagiarism/dp/0226484777, AND OTHER SUCH SOURCES.--&gt;
# Submitting someone's work as their own.
# Taking passages from their own previous work without adding citations.
# Re-writing someone's work without properly citing sources.
# Using quotations, but not citing the source.
# Interweaving various sources together in the work without citing.
# Citing some, but not all passages that should be cited.
# Melding together cited and uncited sections of the piece.
# Providing proper citations, but fails to change the structure and wording of the borrowed ideas enough.
# Inaccurately citing the source.
# Relying too heavily on other people's work. Fails to bring original thought into the text.

==== Sanctions for student plagiarism ====
In the academic world, plagiarism by students is usually considered a very serious offense that can result in punishments such as a failing grade on the particular assignment, the entire course, or even being expelled from the institution{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}. Generally, the punishment increases as a person enters higher institutions of learning{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}. The seriousness with which academic institutions address student plagiarism may be tempered by a recognition that students may not fully understand what plagiarism is. A 2015 study showed that students who were new to university study did not have a good understanding of even the basic requirements of how to attribute sources in written academic work, yet students were very confident that they understood what referencing and plagiarism are.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Academic integrity: a quantitative study of confidence and understanding in students at the start of their higher education|journal = Assessment &amp; Evaluation in Higher Education|first=Philip|last=Newton|date=2 April 2016|volume=41|issue=3|pages=482–497|doi=10.1080/02602938.2015.1024199}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same students also had a lenient view of how plagiarism should be penalised.

For cases of repeated plagiarism, or for cases in which a student commits severe plagiarism (e.g., purchasing an assignment), suspension or [[Expulsion (education)|expulsion]] may occur. There has been historic concern about inconsistencies in penalties administered for university student plagiarism, and a plagiarism tariff was devised in 2008 for UK higher education institutions in an attempt to encourage some standardization of approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.plagiarismadvice.org/BTariff.pdf |title=Benchmark Plagiarism Tariff |first1=Peter |last1=Tennant |first2=Gill |last2=Rowell |year=2009–2010 |website=plagiarism advice.org |publisher=iParadigms Europe |format=PDF |accessdate=9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, to impose sanctions, plagiarism needs to be detected. Strategies faculty members use to detect plagiarism include carefully reading students work and making note of inconsistencies in student writing, citation errors and providing plagiarism prevention education to students.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Colella-Sandercock, J. A., &amp; Alahmadi, H. W. (2015). Plagiarism education: Strategies for instructors. ''International Journal of Learning, Teaching and Educational Research, 13''(1), 76-84. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://ijlter.org/index.php/ijlter/article/view/395/190&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It has been found that a significant share of (university) teachers do not use detection methods such as using text-matching software.&lt;ref name="Sattler2015"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1080/03075079.2015.1085007|title = The use frequency of 10 different methods for preventing and detecting academic dishonesty and the factors influencing their use| journal=Studies in Higher Education| volume=42| issue=6| pages=1126–1144|year = 2017|last1 = Sattler|first1 = Sebastian| last2=Wiegel| first2=Constantin| last3=Veen| first3=Floris van}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few more try to detect plagiarism by reading term-papers specifically for plagiarism, while the latter method might be not very effective in detecting plagiarism – especially when plagiarism from unfamiliar sources needs to be detected.&lt;ref name="Sattler2015" /&gt; There are checklists of tactics to prevent student plagiarism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Practical Prevention of Plagiarism for University Faculty &amp; Management – 14 Tactics|last=Dawes|first=John|date=20 July 2018|ssrn = 3209034}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Criminal and negative behaviour by diploma mills ====
{{one source|section|date=May 2017}}
There are allegations that some diploma mills{{discuss|diploma mills (sic)}} take students' money for essays, then produce a low standard essay or close their websites without providing the purchased essay.  Students then have little time to provide an essay before a deadline.  Also diploma mills have allegedly [[blackmail]]ed students demanding more money than was originally agreed and threatening to reveal plagiarism to the university unless more money is paid.  Sorana Vieru of the [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|NUS]] said, “We would urge those who are struggling to seek support through their unions and universities rather than looking to a quick fix, and be aware that using these websites could cost not only money but jeopardise their qualifications.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/may/19/students-warned-against-using-essay-mill-sites-to-write-dissertations Students warned against using 'essay mill' sites to write dissertations] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

There are calls for diploma mills to be made illegal in the United Kingdom, in New Zealand and some juristictions in the United States they are already illegal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-45640236 University bosses call for ban on essay-writing companies] ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Plagiarism education ====
Given the serious consequences that plagiarism has for students, there has been a call for a greater emphasis on learning in order to help students avoid committing plagiarism.&lt;ref name="ireland"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264452242_Let_Them_Plagiarise_Developing_Academic_Writing_in_a_Safe_Environment|title=Let Them Plagiarise: Developing Academic Writing in a Safe Environment|first1=Chris|last1=Ireland|first2=University of|last2=Huddersfield|first3=|last3=UK|first4=John|last4=English|first5=University of|last5=Huddersfield|first6=|last6=UK|date=1 October 2011|publisher=|volume=1|issue=1|pages=165–172|doi=10.18552/joaw.v1i1.10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leung, C.

==== Factors influencing student´s decision to plagiarize ====
Several studies investigated factors that influence the decision to plagiarize. For example, a panel study with students from German universities found that academic procrastination predicts the frequency plagiarism conducted within six months followed the measurement of academic procrastination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Patrzek | first1 = J. | last2 = Sattler | first2 = S. | last3 = van Veen | first3 = F. | last4 = Grunschel | first4 = C. | last5 = Fries | first5 = S. | year = 2014 | title = Investigating the Effect of Academic Procrastination on the Frequency and Variety of Academic Misconduct: A Panel Study | url = | journal = Studies in Higher Education | volume = | issue = | pages = 1–16| doi = 10.1080/03075079.2013.854765 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that by plagiarizing students cope with the negative consequences that result from academic procrastination such as poor grades. Another study found that plagiarism is more frequent if students perceive plagiarism as beneficial and if they have the opportunity to plagiarize.&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian Sattler, Peter Graeff, Sebastian Willen: ''Explaining the Decision to Plagiarize: An Empirical Test of the Interplay Between Rationality, Norms, and Opportunity.'' In: ''Deviant Behavior.'' 34, 2013, S.&amp;nbsp;444–463, [[doi:10.1080/01639625.2012.735909]].&lt;/ref&gt; When students had expected higher sanctions and when they had internalized social norms that define plagiarism as very objectionable, plagiarism was less likely to occur.

=== Journalism ===
Since journalism relies on the public trust, a reporter's failure to honestly acknowledge their sources undercuts a newspaper or television news show's integrity and undermines its credibility. Journalists accused of plagiarism are often suspended from their reporting tasks while the charges are being investigated by the news organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.famousplagiarists.com/journalism.htm |title=Journalism  |website=Famous Plagiarists.com / War On Plagiarism.org |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070226090147/http://famousplagiarists.com/journalism.htm |archivedate=26 February 2007|accessdate=9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self-plagiarism ===
{{See also|Duplicate publication}}
The reuse of significant, identical, or nearly identical portions of one's own work without acknowledging that one is doing so or citing the original work is sometimes described as "self-plagiarism"; the term "recycling fraud" has also been used to describe this practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dellavalle | first = Robert P. | last2 = Banks | first2 = Marcus A. | last3 = Ellis | first3 = Jeffrey I. |date=September 2007 | title = Frequently asked questions regarding self-plagiarism: How to avoid recycling fraud | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology | volume = 57 | issue = 3 | page = 527 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaad.2007.05.018 | pmid = 17707155 | pmc = 2679117 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Articles of this nature are often referred to as duplicate or [[multiple publication]]. In addition there can be a copyright issue if copyright of the prior work has been transferred to another entity. Self-plagiarism is considered a serious ethical issue in settings where someone asserts that a publication consists of new material, such as in publishing or factual documentation.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Attwood.

Times Higher Education. 3 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; It does not apply to public-interest texts, such as social, professional, and cultural opinions usually published in newspapers and magazines.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

In academic fields, self-plagiarism occurs when an author reuses portions of their own published and copyrighted work in subsequent publications, but without attributing the previous publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hexham |first=Irving |year=2005 |title=The Plague of Plagiarism: Academic Plagiarism Defined |website=UCalgary.ca |url=http://people.ucalgary.ca/~hexham/content/articles/plague-of-plagiarism.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Roig, M.

Commentary on 'Seven ways to plagiarize: handling real allegations of research misconduct' | doi = 10.1007/s11948-002-0007-4 | journal = Science and Engineering Ethics | volume = 8 | issue = 4 | pages = 543–4 |date=October 2002 | pmid = 12501723 }}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that self-plagiarism is a misnomer, since by definition plagiarism concerns the use of others' material. Bird identifies the ethical issues of "self-plagiarism" as those of "dual or redundant publication." She also notes that in an educational context, "self-plagiarism" refers to the case of a student who resubmits "the same essay for credit in two different courses." As David B. Resnik clarifies, "Self-plagiarism involves dishonesty but not intellectual theft."&lt;ref&gt;See Resnik, David B. (1998). ''The Ethics of Science: an introduction'', London: Routledge. p.177, notes to chapter six, note 3. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zMn2KxPQyk8C&amp;lpg=PA177&amp;dq=%22self-plagiarism%22&amp;lr=&amp;pg=PA177 Online via Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Patrick M. Scanlon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://hdl.handle.net/2027/spo.5240451.0002.007 | author = Scanlon, PM | year = 2007 | title = Song from myself: an anatomy of self-plagiarism | journal = Plagiary | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–11 | accessdate=2010-08-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Self-plagiarism" is a term with some specialized currency. Most prominently, it is used in discussions of research and publishing integrity in biomedicine, where heavy publish-or-perish demands have led to a rash of duplicate and "salami-slicing" publication, the reporting of a single study's results in "[[least publishable unit]]s" within multiple articles (Blancett, Flanagin, &amp; Young, 1995; Jefferson, 1998; Kassirer &amp; Angell, 1995; Lowe, 2003; McCarthy, 1993; Schein &amp; Paladugu, 2001; Wheeler, 1989). Roig (2002) offers a useful classification system including four types of self-plagiarism: duplicate publication of an article in more than one journal; partitioning of one study into multiple publications, often called salami-slicing; text recycling; and copyright infringement.

==== Codes of ethics ====
Some academic journals have codes of ethics that specifically refer to self-plagiarism. For example, the ''Journal of International Business Studies''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Lorraine Eden |url=http://palgrave-journals.com/jibs/jibs_ethics_code.html |title=JIBS Code of Ethics |publisher=Journal of International Business Studies |accessdate=2010-08-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723212122/http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/jibs_ethics_code.html |archivedate=2010-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some professional organizations like the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM) have created policies that deal specifically with self-plagiarism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=June 2010 | title = ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism | url=http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism_policy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other organizations do not make specific reference to self-plagiarism such as the American Political Science Association (APSA). The organization published a code of ethics that describes plagiarism as "...deliberate appropriation of the works of others represented as one's own." It does not make any reference to self-plagiarism. It does say that when a thesis or dissertation is published "in whole or in part", the author is "not ordinarily under an ethical obligation to acknowledge its origins."&lt;ref&gt;American Political Science Association (2008). [http://www.apsanet.org/imgtest/ethicsguideweb.pdf "A Guide to Professional Ethics in Political Science"]. Second Edition. Section 21.1. {{ISBN|1-878147-05-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The American Society for Public Administration (ASPA) also published a code of ethics that says its members are committed to: "Ensure that others receive credit for their work and contributions," but it makes no reference to self-plagiarism.&lt;ref&gt;American Society for Public Administration. [http://www.aspanet.org/scriptcontent/index_codeofethics.cfm "ASPA's Code of Ethics"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124015330/http://www.aspanet.org/scriptcontent/index_codeofethics.cfm |date=2011-01-24 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Factors that justify reuse ====
[[Pamela Samuelson]], in 1994, identified several factors she says excuse reuse of one's previously published work, that make it not self-plagiarism.&lt;ref name="Samuelson, Pamela. (1994)" /&gt; She relates each of these factors specifically to the ethical issue of self-plagiarism, as distinct from the legal issue of fair use of copyright, which she deals with separately. Among other factors that may excuse reuse of previously published material Samuelson lists the following:

# The previous work must be restated to lay the groundwork for a new contribution in the second work.
# Portions of the previous work must be repeated to deal with new evidence or arguments.
# The audience for each work is so different that publishing the same work in different places is necessary to get the message out.
# The author thinks they said it so well the first time that it makes no sense to say it differently a second time.

Samuelson states she has relied on the "different audience" rationale when attempting to bridge interdisciplinary communities. She refers to writing for different legal and technical communities, saying: "there are often paragraphs or sequences of paragraphs that can be bodily lifted from one article to the other. And, in truth, I lift them." She refers to her own practice of converting "a technical article into a law review article with relatively few changes—adding footnotes and one substantive section" for a different audience.&lt;ref name="Samuelson, Pamela. (1994)" /&gt;

Samuelson describes misrepresentation as the basis of self-plagiarism.&lt;ref name="Samuelson, Pamela. (1994)" /&gt; She also states "Although it seems not to have been raised in any of the self-plagiarism cases, copyrights law's fair use defense would likely provide a shield against many potential publisher claims of copyright infringement against authors who reused portions of their previous works."&lt;ref name="Samuelson, Pamela. (1994)" /&gt;

=== Organizational publications ===
Plagiarism is presumably not an issue when organizations issue collective unsigned works since they do not assign credit for originality to particular people. For example, the [[American Historical Association]]'s "Statement on Standards of Professional Conduct" (2005) regarding textbooks and reference books states that, since textbooks and encyclopedias are summaries of other scholars' work, they are not bound by the same exacting standards of attribution as original research and may be allowed a greater "extent of dependence" on other works.&lt;ref name=AHA&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.historians.org/PUBS/Free/ProfessionalStandards.cfm | title = Statement on Standards of Professional Conduct | date = 2005-01-06 | accessdate=2009-04-16 | publisher = American Historical Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, even such a book does not make use of words, phrases, or paragraphs from another text or follow too closely the other text's arrangement and organization, and the authors of such texts are also expected to "acknowledge the sources of recent or distinctive findings and interpretations, those not yet a part of the common understanding of the profession."&lt;ref name=AHA /&gt;

== In the arts ==
=== The history of the arts ===
Through all of the [[history of literature]] and [[History of art|of the arts]] in general, works of art are for a large part repetitions of the [[Poetic tradition|tradition]]; to the entire history of [[artistic creativity]] belong plagiarism, literary theft, [[Appropriation (art)|appropriation]], incorporation, retelling, rewriting, recapitulation, revision, reprise, [[thematic variation]], ironic retake, [[parody]], imitation, stylistic theft, [[pastiche]]s, [[collage]]s, and deliberate [[Assemblage (art)|assemblages]].&lt;ref name="Derrida01p57"&gt; Derrida [1959] quotation: (p.40):{{full|date=April 2017}} "The boundaries between permissible and impermissible, imitation, stylistic plagiarism, copy, replica and forgery remain nebulous."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eco90"&gt;Eco (1990) p. 95 quotation:
{{quotation|Each of the types of repetition that we have examined is not limited to the mass media but belongs by right to the entire history of artistic creativity; plagiarism, quotation, parody, the ironic retake are typical of the entire artistic-literary tradition. &lt;br /&gt; Much art has been and is repetitive. The concept of absolute originality is a contemporary one, born with Romanticism; classical art was in vast measure serial, and the "modern" avant-garde (at the beginning of this century) challenged the Romantic idea of "creation from nothingness," with its techniques of collage, mustachios on the Mona Lisa, art about art, and so on.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lands99" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Alfrey"&gt;Alfrey (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Genette [1982] note 3 to ch. 7, p. 433. quotation: {{quotation|"transposition"... all the other possible terms (rewriting, rehandling, remake, revision, refection, recasting, etc.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Steiner98pp437-459" /&gt; There is no rigorous and precise distinction between practices like imitation, stylistic plagiarism, [[Copying|copy]], [[replica]] and [[forgery]].&lt;ref name="Derrida01p57" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Haywood87p109Arnau"&gt;Haywood (1987) p.109, quoting Arnau&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eco87p202Arnau"&gt;Eco (1987) p.202, quoting Arnau&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arnau59p40"&gt;Arnau [1959] quotation: (p. 40) "The boundaries between permissible and impermissible, imitation, stylistic plagiarism, copy, replica and forgery remain nebulous."&lt;/ref&gt; These appropriation procedures are the main axis of a literate culture, in which the tradition of the canonic past is being constantly rewritten.&lt;ref name="Steiner98pp437-459"&gt;Steiner (1998) pp. 437, 459 quotation:
{{quotation|(p. 437) There is between 'translation proper' and 'transmutation' a vast terrain of 'partial transformation'. The verbal signs in the original message or statement are modified by one of a multitude of means or by a combination of means. These include [[Paraphrasing of copyrighted material|paraphrase]], graphic illustration, pastiche, imitation, thematic variation, parody, citation in a supporting or undermining context, false attribution (accidental or deliberate), plagiarism, collage, and many others. This zone of partial transformation, of derivation, of alternate restatement determines much of our sensibility and literacy. It is, quite simply, the matrix of culture.

(p. 459) We could, in some measure, at least, come closer to a verifiable gradation of the sequence of techniques and aims, which leads from literal translation through paraphrases, mimesis, and pastiche to thematic variation. I have suggested that this sequence is the main axis of a literate culture, that a culture advances, spiralwise, via translations of its own canonic past.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruth Graham quotes [[T.S. Eliot]]—"Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal. Bad poets deface what they take."—she notes that despite the "taboo" of plagiarism, the ill-will and embarrassment it causes in the modern context, readers seem to often forgive the past excesses of historic literary offenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Graham |first=Ruth |url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/article/247130 |title=Word Theft |publisher=Poetryfoundation.org |date=January 7, 2014 |accessdate=2014-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Praisings of artistic plagiarism ===
A passage of [[Laurence Sterne]]'s 1767 ''[[Tristram Shandy]]'' condemns plagiarism by resorting to plagiarism.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Ford [http://www.lrb.co.uk/v26/n23/mark-ford/love-and-theft Love and Theft] [[London Review of Books]] Vol. 26 No. 23 · 2 December 2004 pages 34–35 | 4103 words&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oliver Goldsmith]] commented:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sterne's Writings, in which it is clearly shewn, that he, whose manner and style were so long thought original, was, in fact, the most unhesitating plagiarist who ever cribbed from his predecessors in order to garnish his own pages. It must be owned, at the same time, that Sterne selects the materials of his mosaic work with so much art, places them so well, and polishes them so highly, that in most cases we are disposed to pardon the want of originality, in consideration of the exquisite talent with which the borrowed materials are wrought up into the new form.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oliver Goldsmith]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=qEMVAAAAYAAJ The vicar of Wakefield: a tale, Volume 5] p.xviii&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== In other contexts ==

=== On the Internet ===
Free online tools are becoming available to help identify plagiarism,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-5663303-7.html "Apple accused of copyright wrongs"] CNET&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webpronews.com/topnews/2005/08/30/copyscape-searches-for-scraped-content|title=Copyscape Searches For Scraped Content|publisher=WebProNews|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221143230/http://www.webpronews.com/topnews/2005/08/30/copyscape-searches-for-scraped-content|archivedate=2007-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there are a range of approaches that attempt to limit online copying, such as [[Digital rights management|disabling]] [[Right-click#Common mouse operations|right clicking]] and placing warning banners regarding copyrights on web pages. Instances of plagiarism that involve copyright violation may be addressed by the rightful content owners sending a [[DMCA]] removal notice to the offending site-owner, or to the [[ISP]] that is hosting the offending site. The term "content scraping" has arisen to describe the copying and pasting of information from websites&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2006-07-31-net-plagiarism_x.htm | title = Authorship gets lost on Web | work = [[USA Today]] | date = August 1, 2006 | first = Del | last = Jones }}&lt;/ref&gt; and blogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2006/05/08/online_plagiarism_strikes_blog_world/ | title = Online plagiarism strikes blog world | work = [[The Boston Globe]] | first = Maura | last = Welch | date = May 8, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:New York's New Solar System2.jpg|thumb|300px|In this 1899 [[Udo Keppler]] cartoon from ''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]]'', all of New York City politics revolves around boss [[Richard Croker]].]]

A '''political machine''' is a political group in which an authoritative boss or small group commands the support of a corps of supporters and businesses (usually [[Political campaign|campaign workers]]), who receive rewards for their efforts. The machine's power is based on the ability of the nuggets to [[get out the vote]] for their candidates on election day.

Although these elements are common to most political parties and organizations, they are essential to political machines, which rely on hierarchy and rewards for political power, often enforced by a strong [[Whip (politics)|party whip]] structure. Machines sometimes have a [[political boss]], often rely on [[patronage]], the [[spoils system]], "behind-the-scenes" control, and longstanding political ties within the structure of a [[representative democracy]]. Machines typically are organized on a permanent basis instead of a single election or event. The term may have a pejorative sense referring to corrupt political machines.&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | title = political machine | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/467617/political-machine | encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica | accessdate = December 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "political machine" dates back to the 20th century in the United States, where such organizations have existed in some municipalities and states since the 18th century. Similar machines have been described in [[Latin America]], where the system has been called ''[[:en:clientelism|clientelism]]'' or '''''political clientelism''''' (after the similar [[:Clientela|Clientela]] relationship in the [[Roman Republic]]), especially in rural areas, and also in some African states and other emerging democracies, like postcommunist Eastern European countries. Japan's [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] is often cited as another political machine, maintaining power in [[suburb]]an and [[rural]] areas through its control of farm bureaus and road construction agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The American Journey, Reconstruction to the Present |edition=Student | year = 2005 | publisher = Glencoe/McGraw-Hill | ISBN=0078609801}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan, the word ''jiban'' (literally "base" or "foundation") is the word used for political machines.&lt;ref name=safire&gt;{{cite book | last = Safire |first= Nicole |title = Safire's Political Dictionary | pages = 391–392 | chapter = "Machine politics" | edition = First | year = 1978 |publisher = Random House}} (although the book existed in an earlier version titled "The New Language of Politics")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Bo0KAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22roman+republic%22+%22political+patronage%22&amp;dq=%22roman+republic%22+%22political+patronage%22&amp;lr=&amp;pgis=1 | title = Editorial Research Reports| publisher = Congressional Quarterly | year = 1973 |volume= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' defines "political machine" as, "in U.S. politics, a party organization, headed by a [[political boss|single boss]] or small autocratic group, that commands enough votes to maintain political and administrative control of a city, county, or state".&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt; [[William Safire]], in his ''Safire's Political Dictionary'', defines "machine politics" as "the election of officials and the passage of legislation through the power of an organization created for political action".&lt;ref name=safire/&gt; He notes that the term is generally considered pejorative, often implying corruption.

Hierarchy and discipline are hallmarks of political machines. "It generally means strict organization", according to Safire.&lt;ref name=safire/&gt; Quoting [[Edward J. Flynn|Edward Flynn]], a [[Bronx County]] Democratic leader who ran the borough from 1922 until his death in 1953,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last  = Glazer |first = Nathan  |last2=Monyhan |first2=Daniel Patrick |title =Beyond the Melting Pot: The Negroes, Puerto Ricans, Jews, Italians and Irish of New York | chapter = The Irish | page = 226 |publisher = The MIT Press |year = 1963 |quote = Ed Flynn ran the Bronx from 1922 until his death in 1953.}}&lt;/ref&gt; he wrote "[...] the so-called 'independent' voter is foolish to assume that a political machine is run solely on good will, or patronage. For it is not only a machine; it is an army. And in any organization as in any army, there must be discipline."&lt;ref name=safire/&gt;

Political patronage, while often associated with political machines, is not essential to the definition for either Safire or ''Britannica.''&lt;ref name=safire/&gt;

== Function ==
A political machine is a party organization that recruits its members by the use of tangible incentives—money, political jobs—and that is characterized by a high degree of leadership control over member activity.

Political machines started as [[grass roots]] organizations to gain the [[patronage]] needed to win the modern election. Having strong patronage, these "clubs" were the main driving force in gaining and getting out the "straight party vote" in the election districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = James Q. |last = Wilson | authorlink =  James Q.

In the late 19th century, large cities in the United States—[[Boston]], [[Chicago]], [[Cleveland]], [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[New York City]], [[Philadelphia]], [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]—were accused of using political machines.&lt;ref name=americans&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Americans: Reconstruction to the 21st Century: California Teacher's Edition |location=Evanston |publisher=McDougall Littell Inc |year=2006 |pages=267–268 |isbn= 978-0618184163}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During this time "cities experienced rapid growth under inefficient government".&lt;ref name=americans/&gt; Each city's machine lived under a hierarchical system with a [[political boss|"boss"]] who held the allegiance of local business leaders, [[elected officials]] and their appointees, and who knew the proverbial buttons to push to get things done. Benefits and problems both resulted from the rule of political machines.&lt;ref name=Blumer&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=The American Journal of Sociology |volume=20 |year = 1914–1915|quote=The political machine is in fact an attempt to maintain, inside the formal administrative organization of the city, the control of a primary group. |page=603 |first=Herbert |last=Blumer | jstor = 2763406 | title = The City: Suggestions for the Investigation of Human Behavior in the City Environment | doi = 10.1086/212433 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gosnell&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1177/000271623316900104 |title=The Political Party versus the Political Machine |journal=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science |first=Harold F. |last=Gosnell |volume=169 |date=September 1933 |pages=21–28 |quote=When the spoils element is predominant in a political organization, it is called a political machine.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This system of political control—known as "[[bossism]]"—emerged particularly in the [[Gilded Age]]. A single powerful figure (the boss) was at the center and was bound together to a complex organization of lesser figures (the political machine) by reciprocity in promoting financial and social self-interest. One of the most infamous of these political machines was [[Tammany Hall]], the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] machine that played a major role in controlling [[New York City]] and New York politics and helping immigrants, most notably the Irish, rise up in American politics from the 1790s to the 1960s. From 1872, Tammany had an Irish "boss". However, Tammany Hall also served as an engine for [[Graft (politics)|graft]] and political corruption, perhaps most notoriously under [[William M. Tweed|William M. "Boss" Tweed]] in the mid-19th century.

[[Lord Bryce]] describes these political bosses saying:

{{quote|An army led by a council seldom conquers: It must have a commander-in-chief, who settles disputes, decides in emergencies, inspires fear or attachment. The head of the Ring is such a commander. He dispenses places, rewards the loyal, punishes the mutinous, concocts schemes, negotiates treaties. He generally avoids publicity, preferring the substance to the pomp of power, and is all the more dangerous because he sits, like a spider, hidden in the midst of his web. He is a Boss.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | work = Digital History | title = Urban Political Machines | url = http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/historyonline/us28.cfm | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080821152014/http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/historyonline/us28.cfm | archivedate = 2008-08-21 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When asked if he was a boss, [[James Pendergast]] said simply,

{{quote|I've been called a boss. All there is to it is having friends, doing things for people, and then later on they'll do things for you... You can't coerce people into doing things for you—you can't make them vote for you. I never coerced anybody in my life. Wherever you see a man bulldozing anybody he don't last long.&lt;ref name=americans/&gt;}}

[[Theodore Roosevelt]], before he became president in 1901, was deeply involved in New York City politics. He explains how the machine worked:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The organization of a party in our city is really much like that of an army. There is one great central boss, assisted by some trusted and able lieutenants; these communicate with the different district bosses, whom they alternately bully and assist. The district boss in turn has a number of half-subordinates, half-allies, under him; these latter choose the captains of the election districts, etc., and come into contact with the common heelers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Theodore Roosevelt|title=The Works of Theodore Roosevelt: American ideals|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pqo3AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA132|year=1897|publisher=Collier|pages=132–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Voting strategy===
Many machines formed in cities to serve immigrants to the U.S. in the late 19th century who viewed machines as a vehicle for political [[enfranchisement]]. Machine workers helped win elections by turning out large numbers of voters on election day.  It was in the machine's interests to only maintain a minimally winning amount of support. Once they were in the majority and could count on a win, there was less need to recruit new members, as this only meant a thinner spread of the patronage rewards to be spread among the party members.  As such, later-arriving immigrants, such as Jews, Italians, and other immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe between the 1880s and 1910s, saw fewer rewards from the machine system than the well-established Irish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven P. Erie|title=Rainbow's End: Irish-Americans and the Dilemmas of Urban Machine Politics, 1840-1985|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NxrGXFRlbWgC&amp;pg=PA7|year=1990|publisher=U of California Press|pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the machines' staunchest opponents were members of the middle class, who were shocked at the malfeasance and did not need the financial help.&lt;ref&gt;Ari A. Hoogenboom, "An Analysis of Civil Service Reformers". ''Historian'' 23#1 (1960): 54–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

The corruption of [[urban politics in the United States]] was denounced by private citizens. They achieved national and state civil-service reform and worked to replace local patronage systems with [[civil service]]. By [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s time, the [[Progressive Era]] mobilized millions of private citizens to vote against the machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ruhil | first1 = Anirudh V.S. | year = 2003 | title = Urban Armageddon or politics as usual?

In the 1930s, [[James A. Farley]] was the chief dispenser of the Democratic Party's patronage system through the [[United States Post Office Department|Post Office]] and the [[Works Progress Administration]] which eventually nationalized many of the job benefits machines provided. The [[New Deal]] allowed machines to recruit for the WPA and [[Civilian Conservation Corps]], making Farley's machine the most powerful. All patronage was screened through Farley, including presidential appointments. The [[New Deal]] machine fell apart after he left the administration over the third term in 1940. Those agencies were abolished in 1943 and the machines suddenly lost much of their patronage. The formerly poor immigrants who had benefited under Farley's national machine had become assimilated and prosperous and no longer needed the informal or extralegal aides provided by machines.&lt;ref name=sv;av /&gt; In the 1940s most of the big city machines collapsed, with the exception of Chicago.&lt;ref name=sv;av&gt;{{citation | title = Political Machines | url = http://autocww.colorado.edu/~toldy2/E64ContentFiles/PoliticsAndGovernment/PoliticalMachines.htm | publisher = University of Colorado, Boulder}}&lt;/ref&gt; A local political machine in [[Tennessee]] was forcibly removed in what was known as the [[Battle of Athens (1946)|1946 Battle of Athens]].

Smaller communities such as [[Parma, Ohio]], in the post–Cold War Era under Prosecutor Bill Mason's "Good Old Boys" and especially communities in the Deep South, where small-town machine politics are relatively common, also feature what might be classified as political machines, although these organizations do not have the power and influence of the larger boss networks listed in this article. For example, the "Cracker Party" was a Democratic Party political machine that dominated city politics in [[Augusta, Georgia]], for over half of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/110799/opi_124-1871.shtml | title = Newspapers helped end long rule of corrupt Cracker Party | date = August 29, 2010 | newspaper = The Augusta Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://search.augusta.com/fast-elements.php?type=standard&amp;profile=augustachronicle&amp;querystring=%22cracker+party%22&amp;Go.x=0&amp;Go.y=0&amp;Go=Go | title = Search results for 'Cracker Party' | accessdate = 13 November 2012 | newspaper = The Augusta Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.augusta.com/leaders/slideshow_local/slide14.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=March 11, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050212142225/http://www.augusta.com/leaders/slideshow_local/slide14.html |archivedate=February 12, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-955 | title = Cites &amp; Counties: Augusta | publisher = The New Georgia Encyclopedia | first = Edward J. |last = Cashin | date = 2007-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.augusta.com/leaders/slideshow_local/slide10.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=March 11, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050324073605/http://www.augusta.com/leaders/slideshow_local/slide10.html |archivedate=March 24, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Political machines also thrive on Native American reservations, where the veil of sovereignty is used as a shield against federal and state laws against the practice.&lt;ref name=bbf926&gt;Fink, James (September 26, 2016).

==Evaluation==
The phrase is considered derogatory "because it suggests that the interest of the organization are placed before those of the general public", according to Safire. Machines are criticized as undemocratic and inevitably encouraging corruption.&lt;ref name=safire/&gt;

Since the 1960s, some historians have reevaluated political machines, considering them corrupt but efficient. Machines were undemocratic but responsive. They were also able to contain the spending demands of special interests. In ''Mayors and Money'', a comparison of municipal government in Chicago and New York, [[Ester R. Fuchs]] credited the [[Cook County Democratic Organization]] with giving Mayor [[Richard J. Daley]] the political power to deny [[labor union]] contracts that the city could not afford and to make the state government assume burdensome costs like [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] and courts. Describing New York, Fuchs wrote, "New York got reform, but it never got good government." At the same time, as Dennis R. Judd and Todd Swanstrom suggest in ''City Politics'' that this view accompanied the common belief that there were no viable alternatives. They go on to point out that this is a falsehood, since there are certainly examples of reform oriented, anti-machine leaders during this time.

In his mid-2016 article "How American Politics Went Insane" in ''[[The Atlantic]]'', [[Jonathan Rauch]] argued that the political machines of the past had flaws but provided better governance than the alternatives. He wrote that political machines created positive incentives for politicians to work together and compromise – as opposed to pursuing "naked self-interest" the whole time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/07/how-american-politics-went-insane/485570/|title=How American Politics Went Insane|author=[[Jonathan Rauch]]|publisher=''[[The Atlantic]]''|date=June 2016|accessdate=January 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard John Kerry''' (July 28, 1915 – July 29, 2000) was an American [[United States Foreign Service|Foreign Service]] officer and lawyer. He was the father of politicians [[John Kerry]] and [[Cameron Kerry]].

==Early life==
Kerry was born in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]], to Austrian-born shoe merchant Frederick A. "Fred" Kerry (May 11, 1873 – November 23, 1921) and Hungarian-born musician Ida Löwe (February 20, 1877 – January 19, 1960). He had an elder brother Eric (born c. 1901) and an elder sister Mildred (born 1910). Fred and Ida had changed their names from "Fritz and Ida Kohn" to "Frederick and Ida Kerry" in 1900 and converted from [[Judaism]] to [[Catholicism]] in 1901&lt;ref name="Kerry-GlobeBio"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Kranish, Michael |author2=Mooney, Brian C. |author3=Easton, Nina J. |title=John Kerry: The Complete Biography by ''The Boston Globe'' Reporters Who Know Him Best |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|publisher=[[John W. Henry]]|date=April 27, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kerry-GlobeRoots"&gt;{{cite news |title=Hearing of roots, Czech village roots Kerry on |author=Whitmore, Brian |date=February 22, 2004 |newspaper=The Boston Globe|publisher=John W.

Henry |date=June 15, 2003 |accessdate=January 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were baptized at the same time as Eric. Fred's brother Otto also embraced Catholicism and took on the "Kerry" name.&lt;ref name="Kerry-GlobeRoots"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kerry-NYTJudaism"&gt;{{cite news |title=Kerry's Grandfather Left Judaism Behind in Europe |last=Berger|first=Joseph |date=May 16, 2004 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, Jr.]]|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEEDF173FF935A25756C0A9629C8B63 |accessdate=January 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Kerry" name, widely misinterpreted as indicative of [[Ireland|Irish]] heritage, was reputedly selected arbitrarily: "According to family legend, Fritz and another family member opened an atlas at random and dropped a pencil on a map. It fell on County Kerry in Ireland, and thus a name was chosen."&lt;ref name="Kerry-GlobeBio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kerry-GlobeSurprise"/&gt; Leaving their hometown [[Mödling]], a suburb of [[Vienna]] where they had lived since 1896, Fred, Ida, and Eric emigrated to the United States in 1905, living at first in [[Chicago]] and eventually moving to [[Brookline, Massachusetts]], by 1915.&lt;ref name="Kerry-GlobeBio"/&gt;

For a time, Fred Kerry was prosperous and successful in shoe business. Because of his wealth, the family was able to afford to travel to Europe in the autumn of 1921, returning on October 21. A few weeks later, on November 15, Fred Kerry filed a will leaving everything to Ida and then, on November 23, walked into a washroom of the [[The Fairmont Copley Plaza Hotel|Copley Plaza]] Hotel in Boston and committed [[suicide]] by shooting himself in the head with a handgun. The suicide was front-page news in all of the Boston newspapers, reporting at the time that the motive was severe [[asthma]] and related health problems, but family members stated that the motive was financial trouble: "He had made three fortunes and when he had lost the third fortune, he couldn't face it anymore", according to Eric's daughter Nancy.&lt;ref name="Kerry-GlobeBio"/&gt; John Kerry has said that although he knew his paternal grandfather had come from Austria, he did not know until informed by ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' in January 2003 on the basis of their genealogical research that Fred Kerry had changed his name from "Fritz Kohn" and converted from Judaism to Catholicism&lt;ref name="Kerry-GlobeSurprise"/&gt; nor that Ida's brother Otto and sister Jenni had died in [[Nazi concentration camps]].&lt;ref name="Kerry-NYTJudaism"/&gt;

Richard Kerry attended [[Phillips Academy]], graduated from [[Yale University]] in 1937, and received his law degree from [[Harvard Law School]] in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kranish|first1=Michael|last2=Mooney|first2=Brian C.|last3=Easton|first3=Nina J.|title=John F.

==Career==
Kerry joined the [[United States Army Air Corps]] in [[World War II]] and volunteered to become a [[test pilot]]. He flew [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|C-47s]] and [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|B-29s]] until contracting [[tuberculosis]], after which he was discharged. Upon returning to [[Massachusetts]] after convalescing in [[Colorado]], he became an [[Assistant United States Attorney]]. He moved to [[Washington, D.C.]], in 1949, where he worked in the office of the General Counsel for the [[United States Department of the Navy|Navy Department]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Purdum|first=Todd S.|title=Prep School Peers Found Kerry Talented, Ambitious and Apart|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/16/us/prep-school-peers-found-kerry-talented-ambitious-and-apart.html|accessdate=January 25, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, Jr.|date=May 16, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard significantly influenced his son John's political views, and the two frequently bonded over politics.

Kerry entered the American foreign service and served as a [[diplomat]] in positions both in the United States and at foreign embassies, including in [[Germany]] and [[Norway]]. He also served as a lawyer in the [[Bureau of United Nations Affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Harrison, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZNO3WVTokk0C&amp;pg=PA3117&amp; The Family Forest: Descendants of Lady Joan Beaufort], 1998, page 3117&lt;/ref&gt; Kerry authored ''The Star Spangled Mirror: America's Image of Itself and the World'' in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Richard J.

==Personal life==
Kerry met nurse [[Rosemary Forbes Kerry|Rosemary Isabel Forbes]] in 1938 in [[Saint-Briac-sur-Mer|Saint Briac]], France, where he was taking a course in the sculpture of ship models and she was training as a nurse.

==Early life ==

Robert A. Berman’s father, Pip Berman, was a [[building contractor]] known for expanding the [[Concord Resort Hotel]] and the [[Imperial Room]] nightclub where [[Milton Berle]], [[Sid Caesar]], [[Buddy Hackett]], [[Joan Rivers]] and [[Jerry Seinfeld]] performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work =New York Times |title=The Long Wait For A Casino Is Over|url =https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/19/nyregion/in-the-catskills-the-long-wait-for-a-casino-is-over.html?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work =Barbra Archives |title=Concord Hotel |url =http://barbra-archives.com/live/60s/concord_hotel_streisand.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 19 years of age, Robert A. Berman received the first mass gathering permit to operate an outdoor music festival in [[Sullivan County, New York]] where a decade earlier the 1969 [[Woodstock Music Festival]] was held. Collaborating with music impresario [[Sid Bernstein]] on the site of the former Avon Lodge Hotel in Woodridge, [[New York (state)|New York]], Berman opened Music Mountain hosting artists including  [[The Doobie Brothers]], members of the Grateful Dead as the  Jerry Garcia band and Bobby and the Midnights, [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[The Allman Brothers]] Band, [[Carlos Santana]] and various others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work =New York Times |title=Complicated Casino Proposal Advances |url =https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/17/nyregion/against-all-odds-a-complicated-casino-proposal-advances.html?pagewanted=all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

From 1995 to 2000, Berman co-founded and served as chairman and chief executive officer of Hospitality Worldwide Services (HWS), a publicly traded platform that became one of the most prominent service providers in the [[Hospitality Industry]]. By 1998, HWS had several thousand employees with offices around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work =The Free Library |title= Hospitality Worldwide Establishes Divisional Structure |url =http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Hospitality+Worldwide+Services+establishes+divisional+structure+to...-a019251629}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1995 to 2000, Berman formed partnerships with institutional investors including [[ING]] and [[Apollo Global Management]], which led to the acquisition of more than $100M worth of hotel properties including the Warwick Hotel in [[Philadelphia]] and the Radisson Hotel at [[Chicago]]’s [[O’Hare International Airport]], amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work =New York Times |title= In The Castskill Region The Long Wait For A Casino Is Over |url =https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/19/nyregion/in-the-catskills-the-long-wait-for-a-casino-is-over.html?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work =Times Union |title= If State Is To Blame We’ll Pay The Price |url =http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/James-Odato-If-state-is-to-blame-we-ll-pay-price-5709744.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work =The Free Library |title= Hospitality Worldwide Services To Establish Divisional Structure |url =http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Hospitality+Worldwide+Services+establishes+divisional+structure+to...-a019251629}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996 he formed Catskill Development, LLC and purchased [[Monticello Racetrack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work = New York Times |title = In Catskills, the Long Wait for a Casino Nears an End |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/19/nyregion/in-the-catskills-the-long-wait-for-a-casino-is-over.html?_r=0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work = Times Union |title =James Odato: If state is to blame, we'll pay price |url = http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/James-Odato-If-state-is-to-blame-we-ll-pay-price-5709744.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time Berman worked towards building a Casino in partnership with the [[St. Regis Mohawk Reservation]] Tribe of [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work =New York Times |title = Against All Odds, a Complicated Casino Proposal Advances |url =  https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/17/nyregion/against-all-odds-a-complicated-casino-proposal-advances.html?pagewanted=all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work =NY Daily News |title= Castkill Casino Plan War with Trump Lose Big |url =http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/catskill-casino-plan-war-trump-atlantic-city-lose-big-article-1.5143670}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work =LA Times|title= Casino Project |url =http://articles.latimes.com/1998/apr/05/local/me-36103}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 Stanley Tollman, founder o [[The Travel Corporation]], assigned Berman to manage Alpha Hospitality, a public company directed by Tollman that aimed at administering a Casino for the [[Mohawk tribe]]. In 2003 he merged Catskill Development with Alpha Hospitality, creating [[Empire Resorts]].

From 2002 to 2005, Berman served as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for [[Empire Resorts]], a publicly traded [[NASDAQ]] (“NYNY”) gaming company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work =Businesswire |title= Empire Resorts Announces Departure of Robert Berman |url =http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20051012005967/en/Empire-Resorts-Announces-Departure-Robert-Berman

==Donald Trump controversy==
In 1993 Berman began a project involving an Internet lottery venture in collaboration with the [[Coeur d'Alene people]] tribe in [[Idaho]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work =The Boston Globe |title = Casino case raises issues of money, politics |url = http://cache.boston.com/globe/nation/packages/gaming/casino_case_raises_issues_of_money_politics.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work =NY Daily News |title= Castkill Casino Plan War with Donald Trump |url =http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/catskill-casino-plan-war-trump-atlantic-city-lose-big-article-1.514367}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project campaigned towards bringing [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] gaming to the [[Catskill Mountains|Catskill]] area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work =LA Times |title =Trump was once so involved in trying to block an Indian casino that he secretly approved attack ads |url = http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-anti-indian-campaign-20160630-snap-story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to federal approval to build the [[St. Regis Mohawk]] casino at [[Monticello Raceway]] in 2000, which caused rivalry with other regional casino owners, particularly [[Donald Trump]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work = Forbes |title = Cancer And The Presidency: Why This CEO Says Each Candidate Needs A Plan |url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/arleneweintraub/2016/03/30/cancer-and-the-presidency-why-this-ceo-says-each-candidate-needs-a-plan/#484024672927 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work =Record Online |title= News |url =http://www.recordonline.com/article/20120408/biz/204080314}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump funded an ad campaign to block the casino from being built by targeting the [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] tribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work = New York Times |title =In Catskills, the Long Wait for a Casino Nears an End |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/19/nyregion/in-the-catskills-the-long-wait-for-a-casino-is-over.html?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work =Wall Street Journal |title =Catskills Poised for Casinos |url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303936904579176201715452682}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-Mohawk ads appeared in various newspapers suggesting the negative impact a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] casino would have on the region.  This resulted in [[Donald Trump]] receiving an unprecedented fine of $250,000 for secretly funding a lobbying campaign against Native American casinos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work =NY Daily News |title= Castkill Casino Plan War with Trump Lose Big |url =http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/catskill-casino-plan-war-trump-atlantic-city-lose-big-article-1.5143670}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work =LA Times|title= Casino Project |url =http://articles.latimes.com/1998/apr/05/local/me-36103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work =Indianz |title= Donald Trump tried to bully his way into New York tribe's casino bid |url =http://www.indianz.com/IndianGaming/2016/04/18/donald-trump-tried-to-bully-hi.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Native American gaming==

In 1994 Berman worked with the [[Coeur d'Alene people]] to device the National Indian Lottery via the [[Indian Gaming Regulatory Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work = Spokesman |title = Investors Line Up For Piece Of Tribe’s Action National Indian Lottery Needs Big Stake For Set-Up Costs  |url =  http://www.spokesman.com/stories/1995/apr/02/investors-line-up-for-piece-of-tribes-action/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work = Reference for Business |title = Empire Resorts  |url =  http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history/De-En/Empire-Resorts-Inc.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project led to the creation of the [[Coeur d’Alene Casino]] in [[Idaho]] on land donated in trust to the tribe for the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work = New York Times |title = Against All Odds, a Complicated Casino Proposal Advances |url =   https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/17/nyregion/against-all-odds-a-complicated-casino-proposal-advances.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Davidson |first=Kirk |date=2003 |title= Selling Sin: The Marketing of Socially Unacceptable Products, 2nd Edition |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-qQhMYLT7tgC&amp;pg=PA77&amp;dq=Coeur+D%27Alene+Casino+history&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwisopLr0MbQAhXEtxoKHSQzAvIQ6AEIOjAE#v=snippet&amp;q=coeur%20d'alene&amp;f=false |location= |publisher=Praege |page= |isbn=978-1567206456

In 1999 the [[Mohawk people]] signed the deal with [[Caesars Entertainment Corporation]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work = Indian Country Today |title =Mohawk Catskills casino plans advance, backers survive a legal gauntlet |url =   http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2001/04/11/mohawk-catskills-casino-plans-advance-backers-survive-legal-gauntlet-86681 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This led to a multibillion-dollar lawsuit that was eventually dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work = Law Justicia |title = Catskill Development v.

Timothy Burns|publisher=congress.org|accessdate=August 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Mandeville, Louisiana|Mandeville]], [[Louisiana]], who is a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] former member of the [[Louisiana State Legislature|Louisiana House of Representatives]] for District 89 in [[St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana|St. Tammany Parish]].

Political web sites do not indicate Burns's place of birth. He holds three degrees from [[Tulane University]] in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] — [[Bachelor of Arts]] in economics in 1979, [[Master of Business Administration]] in 1980, and [[Juris Doctor]] in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ucsb.www.ucforcalifornia.org/bio/id/141590|title=Rep.

Burns nearly won outright the five-candidate, all-Republican [[nonpartisan blanket primary]] held on October 4, 2003. He led with 6,152 votes (46.7 percent). Susan Bonnett, with 3,534 votres (26.8 percent) ran second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://staticresults.sos.la.gov/10042003/10042003_Legislative.html|title=Louisiana primary election returns, October 4, 2003|publisher=staticresults.sos.la.gov|accessdate=August 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonnett withdrew from the pending [[general election]], and Burns won the seat outright.  Burns was reelected without opposition in 2007.

After the election of Republican [[Bobby Jindal]] as [[governor of Louisiana|governor]] in 2007, Burns soon entered the [[special election]] called to fill Jindal's term in [[Louisiana's 1st congressional district]]. His principal rival was newly elected [[Louisiana State Legislature|State Senator]] [[Steve Scalise]] of [[Jefferson, Louisiana|Jefferson]]. Burns accused Scalise of having used [[push poll]]ing to mislead voters in their congressional race. Under this system, a campaign contacts voters by telephone and asks probing questions which leave a negative impression of an opposing candidate. Scalise defended his poll from criticism by Burns: "We were running a public opinion survey this week conducted by the largest Republican polling firm in the country, Public Opinion Strategies. . . . conducted with a sample of 300 people, and it shows Scalise at 57 percent, Burns at 26 percent and undecided at 17 percent. The margin of error is 5.6 percent. We ran a fact-based public opinion survey, not a push poll."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nola.com/news/t-p/capital/index.ssf?/base/news-5/1205560202224150.xml&amp;coll=1 Scalise defends integrity of GOP runoff survey- NOLA.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the March 8, 2008, Republican primary, which was a [[closed primary|closed election]] restricted to registered Republicans, Scalise polled 16,799 votes (48 percent). Burns received 9,631 votes (28 percent), and two other candidates, Ben Morris and David Simpson, shared some 24 percent of the ballots cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://staticresults.sos.la.gov/03082008/03082008_MultiParish.html|title=Louisiana election returns, March 8, 2008|publisher=staticresults.sos.la.gov|accessdate=August 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[runoff election]] on April 5, Scalise easily prevailed, 19,338 (58 percent) to Burns's 13,958 (41.9 percent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://staticresults.sos.la.gov/04052008/04052008_Congressional.html|title=Congressional election results, April 5, 2008|publisher=staticresults.sos.la.gov|accessdate=August 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burns serves on these House committees: (1) Health and Welfare, (2) Judiciary, and (3) Transportation, Highways, and Public Works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freedomspeaks.com/official/41576/louisiana-(la)-state-representative-timothy-g-burns-%5Bla-house-of-representatives%5D|title=Louisiana State Representative Timothy G. Burns|publisher=freedomspeaks.com|accessdate=August 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Burns was rated in his legislative voting record 100 percent by the [[Louisiana Association of Business and Industry]] and 89 percent from the [[Louisiana Family Forum]]. In 2009, he was rated 100 percent by the Louisiana [[Right to Life]] Federation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.votesmart.org/issue_rating_category.php?can_id=35573|title=Rep. Timothy G. "Tim" Burns|publisher=votesmart.org|accessdate=August 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burns won his third and final term in the state House in the primary election held on October 22, 2011. He received 6,156 votes (69.1 percent) to 2,752 (30.9 percent) for his intraparty opponent, Pat Phillips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://staticresults.sos.la.gov/10222011/10222011_Legislative.html|title=Louisiana primary election returns, October 22, 2011|publisher=staticresults.sos.la.gov|accessdate=October 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded in January 2016 by another Republican, [[Reid Falconer]] of [[Madisonville, Louisiana|Madisonville]] in St. Tammany Parish, who defeated Pat Phillips in the primary election held on October 24, 2015.

'''Trade commissioner''' is the title of a government official whose primary duties are to promote international [[trade agreements]] and [[export]] trade programs on behalf of a national or regional government authority.  Such envoys are normally posted abroad, often being permanently resident in the country or region to which they have been assigned, but in some cases are locally engaged employees.  If assigned by an authority or organization lacking sovereignty, or if a local employee, a trade commissioner may not enjoy diplomatic status. The title Trade Commissioner is also used by some international organizations for the senior official responsible for trade.
