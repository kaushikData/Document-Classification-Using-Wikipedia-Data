      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1996">The '''1897-1898 season''' was the third competitive season in [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[football (soccer)|football]].

==Overview==
Only one official league existed at the time.  It was called ''Coupe de Championnat'' (Championship Cup) and was disputed between 5 teams as no new team was admitted.

No team was relegated this season since the FA decided to split the division into two leagues.  Four new teams were thus admitted at the end of the season and they formed one of the two leagues:  [[Club Brugge|F.C. Brugeois]] (that had already played in the first competitive season), [[Cercle Brugge K.S.V.|C.S. Brugeois]], [[K.R.C. Gent-Zeehaven|R.C. Gantois]] and [[K.V. Kortrijk|F.C. Courtraisien]].

'''Association Sportive de Pikine''' or simply '''AS Pikine''' is a Senegalese football club based in [[Pikine]]. They play at [[Stade Al Djigo|Stade Alassane Djigo]], which has a capacity of 5,000.

==History==
The earlier club was established in 1921 and was called Niayes-Pikine.

The modern club was established in 1970, first known as '''ASC Niayes-Pikine''' up to the 2000s.  AS Pikine entered Ligue 1 in 2009.  They would win their first national championship and cup title at the same time for the 2013/14 season&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://senepeople.com/2014/06/22/as-pikine-championne-du-senegal-2014/|title=AS Pikine est championne du Sénégal 2014 (''AS Pikine - Senegalese Champion of 2014'')|publisher=senepeople.com|accessdate=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and headed to participate in the [[2015 CAF Champions League|CAF Champions league in 2015]] and challenged [[Étoile Filante de Ouagadougou]], a club from Burkina Faso and later into the first round where they lost to [[USM Alger|USM Algiers]] from Algeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dzfoot.com/2015/04/03/caf-cl-116e-r-as-pikine-1-1-usm-alger-2-65946.php|title=CAF CL 1/16e R. : AS Pikine 1-1 USM Alger|publisher=dzfoot.com|date=3 April 2015|accessdate=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2014-15 season, Pikine did not had a successful season, their continued appearance in Ligue 1 vanished after being inside the relegation zone and placed 13th after [[ASC Port Autonome]] with 28 points, 4 wins and a staggering 14 losses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rsssf.com/tabless/sene2015.html 2014/15 Senegalese Ligue 1 at RSSSF] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905113512/http://rsssf.com/tabless/sene2015.html |date=September 5, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pikine first appeared in the 2009 edition, the club came in 2011 and won their only League Cup title after defeating [[ASC Yakaar|Yakaar]] 2-1.  Their second attempt for their second title vanished after the club lost to [[ASC Niarry Tally|Niarry Tally]] 1-0 in the 2012 league cup season.

'''[[Afghanistan]]''' competed at the '''[[1996 Summer Olympics]]''' in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]]. The Central Asian nation returned to the Olympic Games after missing the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] held in [[Barcelona]].

Afghanistan only sent three representatives to the Atlanta Games but light-middleweight boxer [[Mohammad Jawid Aman]] was disqualified after arriving at the Games too late for the [[weigh-in]]. The other participant, marathon runner [[Abdul Baser Wasiqi]] injured his [[hamstring]] prior to the race. He nevertheless took part in the marathon but finished last, more than two hours after the winner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/sports/2000/aug/17tal.htm "Taleban hope to get ban revoked"], Reuters, August 17, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Central Park''' is a multi-use [[stadium]] in [[Cowdenbeath]], [[Fife]], Scotland, used for [[Association football|football]] and [[stock car racing]].&lt;ref name = "sfgg"/&gt; It is situated in the centre of the town, just off the High Street,&lt;ref name = "sfgg"/&gt; and has a capacity of {{SPFL-stadiums|cowdenbeath}}.&lt;ref name="capacity"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spfl.co.uk/clubs/cowdenbeath/ |title=Cowdenbeath Football Club|publisher=Scottish Professional Football League |accessdate=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pitch size is 107 x 66 yards. Central Park has been the home ground of [[Scottish Professional Football League]] team [[Cowdenbeath F.C.]] since it opened in 1917. Stock car racing has taken place at the ground since 1970, and takes place on a tarmac racetrack surrounding the football pitch. Central Park was also previously a venue for [[greyhound racing]] between 1928 and 1965.

==History==
Cowdenbeath F.C. played at Jubilee Park until 1888, and then at [[North End Park]]. The club moved to Central Park when it was opened in 1917.&lt;ref name = "inglis"&gt;{{harvnb|Inglis|1996|p=437}}&lt;/ref&gt; A main stand was built in 1921.&lt;ref name = "inglis"/&gt; A record crowd of 25,586 attended a [[Scottish League Cup]] tie against [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] in 1949.&lt;ref name = "sfgg"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.footballgroundguide.com/scotland/cowdenbeath.html|title=Cowdenbeath|accessdate=11 June 2013|publisher=Duncan Adams|work=Scottish Ground Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "inglis"/&gt; Floodlights were first used in 1968, in a match against [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]].&lt;ref name = "inglis"/&gt; Central Park was also used for [[greyhound racing]] and [[Motorcycle speedway|speedway]].&lt;ref name = "inglis"/&gt; It became a [[stock car racing]] track in 1970, and has since hosted several world championships.&lt;ref name = "inglis"/&gt;

Half of the main stand was destroyed by a fire in 1992.&lt;ref name = "inglis"/&gt; The surviving section of this stand is called the West Stand, or the Old Stand. Beside this the ' [[Alex Menzies]] Stand' (or New Stand) was opened in March 1995,&lt;ref name = "inglis"/&gt; giving a total seated capacity of 1,622. Along with this the club built new dressing rooms, a board room, function suite, and office facilities. Both stands have a row of floodlight pylons in front of them, which can obstruct supporters views.&lt;ref name = "sfgg"/&gt; Three sides of the ground are uncovered terraces.&lt;ref name = "inglis"/&gt;

==Greyhound racing==
Greyhound racing around Central Park started on 7 July 1928. A 400-yard circumference track had an inside hare and both handicap and level start racing took place. It was an all grass track and distances raced were 289 and 489 yards. Greyhound racing ceased in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnes|first=Julia|title=Daily Mirror Greyhound Fact File|page =413|year=1988|publisher=Ringpress Books|isbn=0-948955-15-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future==

In 2011, there were plans for Cowdenbeath to move to a new stadium, to be located on the outskirts of Cowdenbeath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Social networks... Facebook Twitter |url=http://www.centralfifetimes.com/articles/1/23822 |title=News |publisher=Central Fife Times |date= |accessdate=2013-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625225539/http://www.centralfifetimes.com/articles/1/23822 |archivedate=25 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/13024840.stm Cowdenbeath take step towards new stadium], [[BBC Sport]], 11 April 2011
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport==

[[Cowdenbeath railway station]] is five minutes' walk from Central Park.&lt;ref name = "sfgg"/&gt; The [[M90 motorway]] passes near Cowdenbeath, with Central Park reached by leaving the motorway at junction 3, taking the [[A92 road|A92]] for [[Kirkcaldy]].&lt;ref name = "sfgg"/&gt; The A909 road then leads into Cowdenbeath and free car parking is provided at the ground.&lt;ref name = "sfgg"/&gt;

'''Club Andino Bariloche''' is a mountaineering organisation based in [[San Carlos de Bariloche]], in the Argentinian Andes. It was founded on the 13th of August 1931 by [[Otto Meiling]], Emilio Frey, [[Juan Javier Neumeyer]] and [[Reinaldo Knapp]], a group of friends who were exploring the region and making first ascents. [[Emilio Frey]] became its first president and continued in this role during 30 years.

The club was responsible for the construction and running of a number of [[mountain hut]]s in the area. Throughout its history, it has organised and funded a large number of expeditions, including many ambitious first ascents throughout the Andes.

==Huts==
Huts run by the club are as follows:
*Refugio Emilio Frey.
*Refugio Reynaldo Knapp.
*Refugio Cerro López.
*Vivac Velco.
*Refugio San Martín (o Jakob).
*Refugio Tronador Viejo.
*Laguna Ilón - Vivac Papa Manuel
*Refugio Manfredo Segre. (Laguna Negra)
*Refugio Berghof. ([[Cerro Otto]])
*Refugio Otto Meiling. ([[Mount Tronador]])
*Refugio Neumeyer.

'''Dreamstyle Stadium''', formerly known as '''University Stadium''', is an outdoor [[American football|football]] [[stadium]] located on the south campus of the [[University of New Mexico]] in [[Albuquerque]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kob.com/article/stories/S2711239.shtml Branch family purchase of naming rights]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the home field of [[New Mexico Lobos]] [[New Mexico Lobos football|football]], which competes as a member of the [[Mountain West Conference]].  The stadium opened in September 1960 and currently has a [[seating capacity]] of 39,224.  The playing surface, named '''Turner &amp; Margaret Branch Field''', is oriented in the north-south configuration that is traditional for football venues.  The stadium sits nearly a mile above sea level, at an elevation of 5,100 feet (1554 m).&lt;ref&gt;[http://msrmaps.com/image.aspx?T=2&amp;S=12&amp;Z=13&amp;X=439&amp;Y=4851&amp;W=3&amp;qs=%7cAlbuquerque%7cNM%7c Topographic map] from [[USGS]] ''[[The National Map]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  

==History==

===Replacement of Zimmerman Field===

Before 1960, Lobos football teams played home games at [[Zimmerman Field]], a 16,000-seat stadium which was located just south of the current Zimmerman Library on the university’s main campus.  The growth of the university after World War II, with the concomitant growth in the popularity of varsity athletics, made it clear by the mid-1950s that a new, larger football venue was needed.  Increasing enrollments also meant that space on the main campus was at a premium.  As such, it was decided that a new stadium would be constructed off of the main campus, which would both allow adequate space for a much larger stadium, and free up space for desperately needed academic facilities on the main campus.

The university purchased land for the new stadium south of campus near the corner of Avenida Cesar Chavez and University Boulevard. This land became known as "south campus," and would eventually become the home of the entire UNM Athletic Department.  Today, facilities located on south campus include [[The Pit (arena)|The Pit]] (now formally named Dreamstyle Arena), [[Isotopes Park]], the Lobo Tennis Club, Lobo Field, Lobo Softball field, the Rudy Davalos Basketball Center, athletics administration buildings, as well as the football stadium.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unm.edu/campusmap.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://msrmaps.com/image.aspx?T=4&amp;S=10&amp;Z=13&amp;X=1757&amp;Y=19407&amp;W=3&amp;qs=%7cAlbuquerque%7cNM%7c Aerial photo] from [[USGS]] ''[[The National Map]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  The new stadium was christened as University Stadium upon its opening in 1960. It consisted of grandstands along the east and west sidelines and a press box above the west stands. The stadium was built in an [[Arroyo (creek)|arroyo]], with the seating bowl created by the piling of excavated fill material to form earthen embankments on which the stands could be built. This "berm" style of construction placed the field below ground level with seats extending both above and below the natural grade.  The initial construction cost of the stadium was just over $4 million. The inaugural football game at University Stadium took place on September 17, 1960, with the Lobos defeating an overmatched [[National University of Mexico]] team by a score of 77-6.

A new press box with private suites was built before the 1976 season at a cost of $1.8 million. Because the stadium had been built on earthen fill, the press box had to be supported on large concrete piers that went down to the pre-existing ground level. In [[1995 in sports|1995]], UNM made a major addition to University Stadium with the construction of the L.F. "Tow" Diehm Athletic Facility, a field house and athletic training facility located just beyond the south end zone.  The athletics department announced in late 2011 that grass playing field would be replaced with a synthetic playing surface. [[FieldTurf]] was chosen as the artificial turf system by the UNM athletic department, and it was in place for the 2012 football season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abqjournal.com/sports/2012/05/13/unm-new-turf-for-12-not-later.html New playing turf, replaces grass]&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the end of the 2017 season, Lobos Football has an all-time record of 163-168-3 at Dreamstyle Stadium.

=== Naming rights ===
In 2012, naming rights for the stadium's playing surface were secured by local attorneys Turner and Margaret Branch, who are alumni and long-time donors to the UNM athletic department.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bizjournals.com/albuquerque/blog/morning-edition/2012/08/university-stadium-football-turf-now.html&lt;/ref&gt; Their $1.5 million donation to the “Lobo Leap to Excellence” capital campaign remains the second-largest single gift ever given to the athletic department by a living donor.  On May 3, 2017, UNM announced a $10 million, 10-year naming-rights agreement with Dreamstyle Remodeling, a local Albuquerque construction company, covering both the University Stadium and University Arena.  The venues were rechristened as Dreamstyle Stadium and [[The Pit (arena)|Dreamstyle Arena]].&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Dyer, [https://www.abqjournal.com/997706/dreamstyle-pledging-10-million-to-unm-most-goes-to-pit-stadium-naming-rights.html Dream deal for UNM nets $10 million over 10 years], Albuquerque Journal, May 3, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expansion==
[[Image:UNM Stadium.jpg|thumb|The west stands and press box]]
The stadium was expanded in 2001, with stands, new bathroom and concessions facilities constructed beyond the north end zone. UNM also added a large, state-of-the-art scoreboard that included the "LoboVision" video screen. In 2004, portable bleachers were donated to UNM by the city of [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] in 2004 to take the stadium's capacity beyond 39,000. Plans for future expansion have been adopted. The next phase of expansion includes renovations of the stadium's southwest and southeast corners, as well as adding 5,000 seats to the south end of the stadium.  Additionally, a tunnel connecting Dreamstyle Stadium and the Tow Diehm Facility has also been planned to allow easier player access to locker rooms during games.  When the currently planned renovations are completed, the stadium will seat over 43,000 spectators.

==Notable events==

===New Mexico Bowl===
{{Main|New Mexico Bowl}}
Since December [[2006 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2006]], University Stadium has hosted the [[New Mexico Bowl]]. The game was funded by a $2 million line of credit from [[ESPN]], and the inaugural edition featured New Mexico against [[2010–13 Mountain West Conference realignment|future]] [[Mountain West Conference]] foe [[San Jose State Spartans football|San Jose State]], then of the [[Western Athletic Conference]]. SJSU defeated UNM 20-12. The game was the first Division I bowl game played in the state of New Mexico. University Stadium had hosted the Division II national championship, named the [[Zia Bowl]], in early December [[1979 in sports|1979]] and [[1980 in sports|1980]].&lt;ref&gt;http://cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/bowls/bowl_results.php?bowlid=327&lt;/ref&gt; In Zia Bowl I, [[Delaware Fightin' Blue Hens football|Delaware]] defeated [[Youngstown State Penguins football|Youngstown State]] 38-21. In Zia Bowl II, [[Cal Poly Mustangs football|Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo]] (now simply [[California Polytechnic State University|Cal Poly]]) beat [[Eastern Illinois Panthers football|Eastern Illinois]] 21-13. Attendance was 4,000 or less for both Zia Bowls, and in 1981 the Division II championship was moved to McAllen, Texas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.d2championship.com/History/DII%20Champ%20History.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soccer===
University Stadium hosted a [[U.S. women's national soccer team]] [[FIFA Women's World Cup|Women's World Cup]] qualifying match against [[Mexico women's national football team|Mexico]] in May [[2004 in sports|2004]].  Three [[United States men's national soccer team|U.S. men's national soccer team]] matches have been played in the stadium, with the most recent being a friendly match with [[Honduras national football team|Honduras]] in March [[2005 in sports|2005]].

'''"Dynamic Tension"''' is the name [[Charles Atlas]] gave to the system of [[physical exercise]]s that he first popularized in the 1920s. 

Dynamic Tension is a self-resistance exercise method which pits [[muscle]] against muscle. The practitioner tenses the muscles of a given body part and then moves the body part against the tension as if a heavy weight were being lifted. Dynamic Tension exercises are not merely [[isometric exercise|isometrics]], since they call for movement. Instead, the method comprises a combination of exercises in three disciplines: [[isotonic (exercise physiology)|isotonic]], [[isokinetic]], and some exercises in the isometric discipline. 

Proponents assert that it is nearly impossible to be injured during exercise using this method because one's own muscles provide the force and, as they tire, so the force used also decreases. Likewise, the benefits can continue beyond the more traditional exercise methods because as the practitioner grows stronger, the exercise becomes more intense.

"Dynamic Tension" is a registered trademark of Charles Atlas, Ltd.

==History==

After being bullied as a child, Charles Atlas joined the [[YMCA]] and began to do numerous exercise routines. He became obsessed with strength. He said that one day he watched a [[tiger]] stretching in the [[zoo]] and asked himself, "How does Mr. Tiger keep in physical condition? Did you ever see a tiger with a [[barbell]]?" He concluded that [[lion]]s and tigers became strong by pitting muscle against muscle.

The story may be apocryphal, but it captures the essence of Mr. Atlas' innovation. There were many other "isometric" courses available at the time, and it only when Atlas used an advertisement depicting a bully kicking sand in the weakling's face that the sales took off.&lt;ref&gt;The 20th Century History With The Boring parts Left Out, D. Wallechinsky, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Some other notable users of this method include [[Joe DiMaggio]], [[Max Baer (boxer)|Max Baer]], [[Rocky Marciano]], [[Joe Louis]], [[Robert Ripley]] and [[Alan Wells]].

Specifically, dynamic tension is a technique very commonly used within martial arts. It refers to the "dynamic tension" literally applied using a person’s movements. Tightening core muscles and applying dynamic tension allows a person to change the tempo of his or her movement. The reconstruction of such movements gives a person more power and speed. That especially becomes useful in performing or sparring. Taking a deep breath, exhaling slowly while tightening the muscles, and sometimes even physically shaking the body part all portray a stronger presence while one performs. Following dynamic tension could be a series of quick movements to pick up the pace.

Dynamic tension is a technique that is universal and can be used on any movement or any style.

The '''Football Trust''' was a Government funded body to improve the safety of sports stadiums in the United Kingdom.

It was set up by the Labour Government in 1975, with the assistance of the pools companies and the [[Football League]]. Its original primary purpose (when it was known as the Football Grounds Improvement Trust) was to assist with the costs of implementing the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.

In October 1990, Chancellor of the Exchequer [[John Major]] reduced tax on the pools competitions such as "spot the ball" to help fund the trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Football Stadia After Taylor: Centre for the Sociology of Sport, Department of Sociology|url=http://www.le.ac.uk/sociology/css/resources/factsheets/fs2.html|publisher=University of Leicester}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It was chaired by [[Tom Pendry]].

In the foreground is the concession and fan seating area the Fisher Cats installed adjacent to right field. The gentle curve of the grandstand is a compromise to watching football games, and creates a large [[foul territory]] for baseball.]]
'''Gill Stadium''' is a [[sport]]ing [[stadium]] located in [[Manchester, New Hampshire]].  It is one of the oldest concrete-and-steel ballparks in the [[United States]]. The venue, which mainly hosts amateur [[baseball]] and [[American football|football]] contests, has a capacity of 3,012.&lt;ref name="City"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.manchesternh.gov/Departments/Parks-and-Recreation/Parks-Facilities/Gill-Stadium|title=Gill Stadium|publisher=City of Manchester|accessdate=2018-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Beech Street Grounds ==
Children and organized amateur teams had played baseball since at least 1880 in the area east of the [[Valley Cemetery]], which was known as "the Plains."

A ballpark called the '''Beech Street Grounds''' was built on the site of Gill Stadium at the corner of Beech and Valley Streets, on land owned by the [[Amoskeag Manufacturing Company]]. The park had a wooden fence and two wooden grandstands. Its main entrance was located on Beech Street. This was near third base, and home plate was in the field's southwest corner.&lt;ref name=Roper&gt;Scott C. Roper and Stephanie Abbot Roper, ''When Baseball Met Big Bill Haywood: The Battle for Manchester, New Hampshire, 1912–1916,'' McFarland and Company, Publishers, Inc., Jefferson NC, 2018. {{ISBN|9781476665467}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|67}} Baseball was played there between 1891 and 1894. In its first two years, the park was home to a minor-league baseball team, the Manchester Amoskeags of the [[New England League]].

== Varick Park ==
In 1894, local businessman Thomas Varick purchased an interest in the park, moved the two grandstands and designated one as men-only, constructed a 40-foot-wide, quarter-mile dirt bicycle and running track, and renamed the complex '''Varick Park'''. The baseball diamond was reoriented so that home plate was along the west (Beech Street) side of the field and the entrance was off Valley Street. As well as baseball, the park hosted track-and-field events, football and soccer games, and outdoor events for Amoskeag.&lt;ref name=Roper /&gt;{{rp|66-67}}

During the 1890s, control of Varick Park passed from Varick to William Freeman. The park was again home to several minor-league baseball teams in the New England League&lt;ref name=Roper /&gt;{{rp|67}} called the Manchester Amoskeags in 1891, the Manchesters in 1899, and the Manchester Textiles in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/New_England_League|title=New England League|publisher=baseball-reference.com|date=2015-12-20|accessdate=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Textile Field ==
In June 1912, Amoskeag officials began negotiations with Freeman to take control of the park for use by the city manufacturers' baseball league. In December 1912, Amoskeag announced that the field had been renamed '''Textile Field''' and that it would be reoriented and completely rebuilt as a modern, brick-and-concrete baseball facility.&lt;ref name=Roper /&gt;{{rp|65-76}}

The current grandstand was built in 1913 at a cost of more than $30,000. It was designed by Amoskeag engineers using brick in the style and color of the mills in Amoskeag's millyard,&lt;ref name=Roper /&gt;{{rp|90-91}} and built by the Amoskeag Textile Club, which was funded by Amoskeag and whose members were Amoskeag employees.

A single, covered grandstand was built, gently curved to provide for watching either baseball or football. For safety, concrete ramps were constructed along the sides and rear of the grandstand. Steel trusses and posts supported the roof. Although portions of the roof, floor, and some of the posts supporting the seating platform were of wood, publications from the period of construction — including Amoskeag's employee newspaper, the ''Amoskeag Bulletin'' — considered it "fireproof", like those being built in major-league cities between 1909 and 1915.&lt;ref name=Roper /&gt;{{rp|88-98}}

Textile Field was one of the first concrete-and-steel stadiums in the United States, the first not in a major city.&lt;ref name=Roper /&gt;{{rp|1-3}}  Only [[Harvard Stadium]] in [[Allston, Boston, Massachusetts|Allston]], [[Massachusetts]] (1903), [[Rickwood Field]] in [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], [[Alabama]] (1910), and [[Fenway Park]] in [[Boston]], Massachusetts (1912) are older surviving examples.

The construction appears to have been part of Amoskeag's benevolence programs.&lt;ref name=Roper /&gt;{{rp|9-10}}  Amoskeag, which employed about 17,000 people in a city of 65,000, included among its workforce a large number of immigrants.  In the minds of Amoskeag managers, the most troublesome of this group were the most recent arrivals from [[Greece]].&lt;ref name=Roper /&gt;{{rp|19-26}} Recent immigrants from southern and eastern Europe were being blamed for the 1912 [[Bread and Roses Strike]] in nearby [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]], which resulted in much violence and the involvement of the radical [[Industrial Workers of the World]] union. Amoskeag, which was not unionized, wanted no such trouble, particularly in light of the fact that IWW operatives were seen in Manchester during the Lawrence strike.&lt;ref name=Roper /&gt;{{rp|27-36, 81-82}} The company hoped to find a way to "Americanize" its workforce, thereby giving workers a stronger connection to the company and to the United States, and to find diversionary activities, like baseball, to keep them from unionizing in their free time.&lt;ref name=Roper /&gt;{{rp|52-54}}

Amoskeag, along with the McElwain Shoe Company and other industries in Manchester, organized the city Manufacturers' League in 1912. The league played at three locations in Manchester, of which Varick Park was the most important. Its reconstruction in 1913 as Textile Field made the league seem more professional. Textile Field made its debut over [[Memorial Day]] weekend of 1913, but the grandstand was not entirely completed until late July.&lt;ref name=Roper /&gt;{{rp|88-98}} The dedication game came on September 8,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.charliesballparks.com/st/NH-Manchester-Gill.htm|title=Gill Stadium, Manchester, N.H.|publisher=Charlie's Big Ballparks Page|date=August 2004|accessdate=2018-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the World Champion [[Boston Red Sox]] — playing its major-league lineup for nearly the entire game — defeated the Manufacturers' League All-Stars, 3-1.&lt;ref name=Roper /&gt;{{rp|117-120}} A year later, the World Champion [[Philadelphia Athletics]] defeated the All-Stars, 7-1.&lt;ref name=Roper /&gt;{{rp|158}} The score and the "vaudeville" act put on by the Athletics in the final inning — in which they changed positions and performed "trick" plays — made Amoskeag reconsider its commitment.&lt;ref name=Roper /&gt;{{rp|158}} Increased on- and off-field problems with players, who were hired ostensibly to work for the textile company but in reality were employed for their baseball skills, also led the Textile Club to withdraw its support for the Manufacturers League.&lt;ref name=Roper /&gt;{{rp|165-166}}

A team from the [[New England League]] moved from [[Fitchburg, Massachusetts]] to Textile Field in July 1914 as the Manchester Textiles. It played there in 1915 as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Manchester_Textiles|title=Manchester Textiles|publisher=baseball-reference.com|date=2013-12-24|accessdate=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, Textile Field became the sole domain of the city's manufacturers and schools until 1926.&lt;ref name=Roper /&gt;{{rp|188-198}} In September 1923, Amoskeag brought in the National League's [[Brooklyn Robins]] (now known as the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]) to play against the company team.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1923/09/06/archives/robins-triumph-13-to-4-defeat-amoskeag-mills-team-in-exhibition.html?sq=amoskeag%2520robins&amp;scp=1&amp;st=cse|title=ROBINS TRIUMPH, 13 TO 4.; Defeat Amoskeag Mills Team In Exhibition Game|publisher=New York Times|date=1923-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Athletic Field ==
Textile Field was purchased by the City of Manchester in 1927 and, in a name-the-field contest conducted by the ''[[Manchester Union-Leader]]'', renamed '''Athletic Field'''. Athletic Field hosted three professional teams of the New England League: The Manchester Blue Sox played there from 1926–1930, winning championships in 1926 and 1929, but the league folded in mid-1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Manchester_Blue_Sox|title=Manchester Blue Sox|publisher=baseball-reference.com|date=2015-04-10|accessdate=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Manchester Giants, affiliated with the [[New York Giants]], made the post-season in 1946 and 1947;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Manchester_Giants|title=Manchester Giants|publisher=baseball-reference.com|date=2009-08-18|accessdate=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Manchester Yankees]], affiliated with the [[New York Yankees]], played there in 1948 but disbanded on July 19, 1949&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Manchester_Yankees|title=Manchester Yankees|publisher=baseball-reference.com|date=2016-01-01|accessdate=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; for financial reasons.

== Gill Stadium ==
[[File:Gill_Stadium_reconstruction,_2004.jpg|thumb|right|400px|The view of Gill Stadium from the south (across Valley Street). This 2004 photo shows the construction of the elevator to the rooftop press box. A temporary poster describing the renovations is attached to the ticket booth.]]
In 1967, the stadium was renamed '''Gill Stadium''', after former Parks and Recreation Director Ignace J. Gill, who served from 1935 to 1967.&lt;ref name=City /&gt; In 1971 and 1972, an [[Eastern League (baseball)|Eastern League]] (class A) team, also called the Yankees, played there.&lt;ref name=City /&gt; Additionally, the Eastern League's [[Nashua Angels]] played a game at Gill Stadium in 1983.

The stadium was renovated extensively in preparation for the inaugural 2004 baseball season of the Eastern League's [[New Hampshire Fisher Cats]] (the class AA affiliate of the [[Toronto Blue Jays]]), acquiring an aluminum floor and molded plastic chairs, new clubhouses adjacent to the grandstand, and dugouts in what was formerly the dirt track. An elevator provided handicapped access to the rooftop press box. The grass surface was replaced with [[FieldTurf]] and the ticket booth and lavatories were renovated.

The Fisher Cats brought the 2004 Eastern League title home to Gill. In 2005, a new municipal baseball stadium — now known as [[Northeast Delta Dental Stadium]] — was completed along the [[Merrimack River]] near downtown, and the Fisher Cats made their scheduled move there.

Over the years, Gill Stadium has served as the home field for city high-school and [[American Legion]] ball clubs. The stadium hosted the American Legion World Series on five occasions. Gill Stadium continues to host numerous amateur baseball teams, and Manchester's annual [[Thanksgiving]] football tournament, the Turkey Bowl, which pits two of the four city schools against each other each year based on their performance during the just-completed season.

On-site parking comprises 300 spaces, accessible from Beech Street.&lt;ref name=City /&gt; Additional parking may be available just north at the adjacent [[John F. Kennedy Memorial Coliseum]], or on side streets.

A '''goalsneak''' is an [[Australian rules football]] player whose job is to kick goals in a game. It usually describes a forward player, particularly a player in a forward pocket, who is small and nimble. A goalsneak may use his pace and cunning to snatch a goal after a running play where a larger player would use brute strength and height to mark the ball.

In Japan ISPS supports bowling, hosting national tournaments throughout the year. In Japan roughly 20% of the population bowls, compared with the 13.8% who play golf. However, the number of bowling alleys has decreased from 3,000 to 1,000. Through the support of the ISPS, a number of bowling events have been held and the professionalism of the sport has been advanced.

'''Jonava Sports Arena''' is an indoor arena in [[Jonava]], Lithuania. Mostly used for basketball and volleyball games.

== History ==
Although construction works started in 2010 arena was not opened until early 2017 due lack of funding.&lt;ref name="jonavoszinios"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jonavoszinios.lt/atidaryta-jonavos-sporto-arena|title=Atidaryta Jonavos sporto arena|website=Jonavos žinios|accessdate=2017-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 fire started and spread across the roof of unfinished arena which resulted in more delays.

{{nihongo|'''Kūdō'''|空道|Kūdō}} (formerly ''Kakutō karate'' (格闘空手); often ''Daidōjuku'') is a [[Japan]]ese [[hybrid martial art]]. It is full-contact mixed combat sport with head 
Guard and gloves, throwing and grappling techniques are also allowed in the competition, including restraint, locks and [[strangle hold]]s. It can be called a mixed martial art with protective gear for the head&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ku-do.com/|title=Kudo International Federation - KIF is a governing organization for "KUDO", mixed Budo sport|website=Ku-do.com|accessdate=2016-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of Kūdō is to come as close as possible to realistic, real fighting, with appropriate protective clothing. To achieve this, Kūdō is fought with very few regulations, and has specialized techniques and actions. The techniques of Kūdō include the entire spectrum of a real struggle-fighting standing up, throwing techniques, grappling and ground fighting.

The training of Kūdō consists primarily of [[kihon]], general fitness training and combat. The [[kata]] of Kyokushin were eliminated without replacement.

Kūdō is a comprehensive martial art and philosophy, in which both the physical as well as mental development are considered. Traditional [[Japanese etiquette]] [[Budō|Budo]] (as [[Reigi]]) is followed, there are certain Japanese greeting ritual, a traditional training [[keikogi]] is worn, the names of the techniques are in Japanese, etc.

Kūdō is practiced in more than 52 countries, with the largest representation in Russia.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

== Takashi Azuma ==
[[File:Azuma Takashi.jpg|thumb|right]]
{{nihongo|'''Takashi Azuma'''|東 孝|Azuma Takashi}} (born 1949 in [[Kesennuma]], Japan) is the founder of Kūdō&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://deportes.terra.cl/luchas/panamericano-de-kudo-en-chile-sera-dirigido-por-su-fundador,cb40d74d8271f194cbd0dc969613a904wizl78o1.html|title=Panamericano de Kudo en Chile será dirigido por su fundador|publisher=[[Terra Chile]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com.co/elpais/juegos-mundiales/noticias/kudo-gran-camino-para-tener-mente-abierta|title=Kudo: El gran camino para tener una mente abierta|publisher=[[El País (Cali)|El País]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the President of the Kudo International Federation. He currently holds an 8th degree [[black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] in [[Kyokushin]] Budokai (awarded by [[Jon Bluming]]), a 3rd degree black belt in judo, and a 9th degree black belt in Kūdō.

Azuma came in contact with [[Budō|budo]] for the first time when he entered the [[judo]] club of his school in Kesennuma at the age of 16 in 1965. In 1972 after his service in the [[Japanese armed forces]], he joined [[Kyokushin Karate]]. That same year he founded a Kyokushin [[dan (rank)|dan]] at [[Waseda University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daidojuku.com/eng/daidojuku/jukucho.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-10-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019232400/http://www.daidojuku.com/eng/daidojuku/jukucho.html |archivedate=2013-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, Azuma founded his own martial art because he was unhappy with some characteristics of Kyokushin. Azuma was bothered that in Kyokushin serious head injuries are common. Azuma was also of the opinion that physically smaller fighters are at a disadvantage compared to bigger fighters.

Azuma's own development of a martial art was first a hybrid of Kyokushin Karate and Judo. Kyokushin was the basis, however, the regulations changed dramatically. Protective clothing was introduced, which allowed hand techniques to the head, and provides sufficient protection to the head during kicking techniques. Selected techniques of grappling and ground combat have been added from judo. Later, more martial arts and combat sports were analyzed and added to selected elements of its own martial art, primarily techniques of [[Muay Thai]] and [[jujutsu]].

[[File:VikersundbakkenWorld Cup Ski flying 2011.jpg|thumb|''[[Vikersundbakken]]'' in [[Vikersund]], Norway, where the current world record stands]]
[[Ski jumping]] is a [[winter sport]] in which athletes compete on distance and style in a jump from a [[ski jumping hill]]. The sport has traditionally focused on a combination of style and distance, and it was therefore early seen as unimportant in many milieus to have the longest jump.&lt;ref name=skifame&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skimuseum.ca/bios/Nelsen_Nels.pdf |title=Nels Nelsen |author=[[Canadian Ski Hall of Fame]] |format=PDF |accessdate=15 February 2011 |archivedate=15 February 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wWWQUfHu?url=http://www.skimuseum.ca/bios/Nelsen_Nels.pdf |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Ski Federation]] (Fédération Internationale de Ski; FIS) has largely been opposed to the inflation in hill sizes and setting of distance records, and no world records have been set at [[ski jumping at the Winter Olympics|Olympic]], [[FIS Nordic World Ski Championships|World Championship]], [[Holmenkollen Ski Festival]] or [[Four Hills Tournament]] events, as these have never been among the largest hills in the world.

Since 1936, when the first jump beyond {{convert|100|m|ft}} was made, all world records in the sport have been made in the discipline of [[ski flying]], an offshoot of ski jumping where distance is explicitly emphasised. As of March 2017, the official world record for the longest ski jump is {{convert|253.5|m|ft|abbr=on}}, set by [[Stefan Kraft]] at [[Vikersundbakken]] in [[Vikersund]], Norway. Two years prior, also in Vikersund, [[Dimitry Vassiliev]] reached {{convert|254|m|ft|abbr=on}} but fell upon landing; his jump is unofficially the longest ever made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/blogs/world-of-sport/ski-jump-world-record-broken-for-second-time-in-two-days-as-anders-fannemel-flies-to-glory-164459525.html|author=[[Eurosport]]|title=Ski jump world record broken for second time in two days as Anders Fannemel flies to glory|date=15 February 2015|accessdate=15 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217025612/https://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/blogs/world-of-sport/ski-jump-world-record-broken-for-second-time-in-two-days-as-anders-fannemel-flies-to-glory-164459525.html|archivedate=17 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History== 
Ski jumping originated in Norway, and has been practiced since time immemorial, using handmade temporary hills.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thoresen|2007|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first record is credited to [[Olaf Rye]], a soldier who set up a show spectated by his fellow soldiers in 1808, reaching {{convert|9.5|m|ft}} in [[Eidsberg]], Norway. This small hill was probably near [[Eidsberg church]], possibly at the farm Lekum.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thoresen|2007|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sondre Norheim]], credited as the 'father' of modern skiing,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thoresen|2007|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; made the second official record at {{convert|19.5|m|ft}} in 1868. Tim Ashburn says in his book ''The History of Ski Jumping'' that Norheim's longest jump on the circular track in Haugli ground in 1868 should have been measured at {{convert|31.5|m|ft}},&lt;ref&gt;({{ISBN|1-904057-15-2}}, p.&amp;nbsp;14)&lt;/ref&gt; but that newspapers in [[Oslo|Christiania]] reported that the length "was a little exaggerated", so the official record is everywhere written as 19.5 m.

The sport quickly spread to Finland, the United States and Canada, where some of the subsequent records were set.&lt;ref name=t371&gt;{{harvnb|Thoresen|2007|p=371}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early jumping competitions were only scored by style, and it was seen as disruptive to attempt to jump further.&lt;ref name=skifame /&gt; Not until 1901 was a scoring system for distance introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thoresen|2007|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the construction of ''[[Bloudkova Velikanka]]'' in [[Planica]], Yugoslavia, in 1934,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thoresen|2007|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; the separate discipline of [[ski flying]] was introduced, which is essentially an 'extreme' version of ski jumping.

With one exception, all of the world records for distance have been set on five of the world's six ski flying hills, of which five remain in use.&lt;ref name=list&gt;{{harvnb|Thoresen|2007|pp=371–373}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, [[Josef Bradl|Josef "Sepp" Bradl]] was the first to surpass the {{convert|100|m|ft}} mark, landing a jump of {{convert|101.5|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thoresen|2007|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FIS was long opposed to ski flying as a whole, and it has never been included in the Olympic or Nordic World Ski Championships. However, since 1972, the [[FIS Ski Flying World Championships]] has been a mainstay event, and ski flying event are also part of the [[FIS Ski Jumping World Cup]] calendar.&lt;!--not referenced to here--&gt; The first to officially reach {{convert|200|m|ft}} was [[Toni Nieminen]] in 1994, by landing a jump of {{convert|203|m|ft}}; at the time, ski jumpers did not receive distance points for the part of the jumps exceeding 191&amp;nbsp;metres.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thoresen|2007|p=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The distance of a ski jump is measured from the end of the 'table' (the very tip of the 'inrun' ramp) to halfway between the athletes' feet when they touch ground. To qualify, the jump must be made in a sanctioned competition, or official trial or qualification runs for these, with a system to control the actual length. To win a competition, an athlete needs both distance and style, the latter of which is achieved by attaining a proper [[Telemark landing]]; therefore jumpers are not motivated to jump as far as possible, only as far necessary to attain a good landing. Jumps are invalid if the jumper falls, defined as touching the ground with his hands or body before reaching the fall line. However, if an athlete touches the snow with any part of their body after landing, and receives style points greater than 14 from at least three judges, the jump is valid and counts as an official world record.&lt;ref&gt;English commentary by David Goldstrom after [[Kamil Stoch]]'s first-round jump, from the [[Eurosport 1]] broadcast in [[Letalnica bratov Gorišek|Planica]] on 26 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

When ski flying began in the 1930s, jumps were recorded in a traditional [[Scandinavia]]n measure of length, the [[alen (unit of length)|Danish alen]] (1 alen (Denmark) = {{convert|0.6277|m|ft|abbr=on}}). Some older United States and Canadian records were recorded in feet. Now, jump length is measured by the meter. Today, camera technology capably makes the measurements. Before, spectators were stationed downhill, meter by meter, and the raised hand of the nearest observer marked the jumper's landing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://berkutschi.com/en/front/encyclopedia/show/11-distance-measuring |title=Distance measurement |author=[[International Ski Federation]] |accessdate=15 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707224542/http://berkutschi.com/en/front/encyclopedia/show/11-distance-measuring |archivedate=7 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;small&gt;* [[Davos]] (2 Mar 1913) – many regard Thorleif Knudsen 48&amp;nbsp;m (157&amp;nbsp;ft) jumps as world records, although [[Ragnar Omtvedt|R. Omtvedt]] already set a new world record of 51.5&amp;nbsp;m (169&amp;nbsp;ft) on 16 Feb 1913 in [[Ironwood, Michigan|Ironwood]]. This is most likely due to Omtvedt jumping as a professional at that time.&lt;/small&gt;

==Invalid world records==

If an athlete touches the ground with their hands, body, or falls before reaching the outrun line, the jump is deemed invalid and thus not listed as a world record. Jumps landed during non-competition training rounds or hill tests are also not recognized as official world records. Distances set by test jumpers (''Vorspringer'', or "V-jumpers") during competition rounds are deemed official.

==Summer world records==

Plastic matting for ski jumping was invented by German athlete Hans Renner. The first ski jumping tests on plastic without any audience were made on 31 October 1954 at Regenbergschanze in [[Zella-Mehlis]], [[East Germany]]. The ''Wadeberg Jugendschanze'' K40 in [[Oberhof, Germany|Oberhof]], East Germany, which was built just next to the old Thüringenschanze, officially became the world's first plastic covered ski jumping hill. On 21 November 1954 they organized first ever and at the same time regional competition on plastic at »Wadeberg Jugendschanze K40« in front of 15,000 spectators where [[Werner Lesser]] set first two ever plastic/summer world records of 41 and 42 metres (135 &amp; 138&amp;nbsp;ft). Russian ski jumper [[Dimitry Vassiliev]] holds the current summer world record on plastic with 147.5 metres (484&amp;nbsp;ft) which he set at [[Russia]]n National Championships on 15 October 2016 in [[Sochi]], [[Russia]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4660">The '''Minnesota Boxing Hall of Fame''' is a commemorative organization with plans to create a museum. It celebrates the history of [[boxing]] in the state of [[Minnesota]] by honoring individuals whose achievements within the sport are noteworthy.

==History==
Though several individuals had previously considered creating a [[hall of fame]] for Minnesota boxing,&lt;ref name="wordpress1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fisticmystic.wordpress.com/2010/07/07/introducing-the-minnesota-boxing-hall-of-fame/ |title=Introducing: The Minnesota Boxing Hall of Fame |work=The Fistic Mystic |publisher=[[WordPress]]|date=2010-07-07 |accessdate=2014-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was noted boxing historian Jake Wegner who pulled together the local boxing community in 2009, filed for nonprofit status, and assembled a board of directors for the new hall.  With Wegner as the president, the board consisted of Jeff Flanagan (Vice-President),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eastsideboxing.com/news.php?p=24229&amp;more=1 |title=Minnesota's Boxing Hall of Fame |publisher=EastsideBoxing.com |date=2010-06-20 |accessdate=2014-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Don Evans (Treasurer), Jim Wells (Secretary), Denny Nelson, Jim Carlin, and Wayne Bebeau.&lt;ref name="wordpress1"/&gt;  The inaugural class of inductees was announced on July 5, 2010 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minnesotaboxing.com/Interviews/2010/minnesota_boxing_hall_of_fame_inductees.html |accessdate=July 20, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101102030125/http://minnesotaboxing.com/Interviews/2010/minnesota_boxing_hall_of_fame_inductees.html |archivedate=November 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the induction banquet took place on October 12, 2010.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/featuredColumns/104830239.html|title=New Boxing Hall of Fame unearths state's forgotten pearls |publisher=Star Tribune |date= 2010-10-13 |accessdate=2014-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, founder and President, Jake Wegner resigned from the organization.

In May 2014, Jeff Flanagan took over as President and the board consists of Vice President Denny Nelson,Secretary Jim Wells, Treasurer Don Evans,

'''North Perrott Cricket Club Ground''' is a former [[List A cricket]] ground located in [[North Perrott]], [[Somerset]].  It hosted a single [[Friends Provident Trophy|Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Trophy]] match in 2001 between [[Somerset Cricket Board]] and [[Wales Minor Counties Cricket Club|Wales Minor Counties]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/658_a.html |title=List A Matches played on North Perrott Cricket Club Ground (1) |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=2010-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ground has also been used by [[Somerset County Cricket Club]] and Board for numerous other matches.  It has also hosted the [[Somerset Women cricket team|Somerset women's cricket team]] occasionally since 2005.  The ground is home to [[North Perrott Cricket Club]], and has been since its creation in 1946.

==History==
===Ground development===
The ground, located on Willis Lane, was levelled and a wicket laid soon after the end of the Second World War.&lt;ref name="club history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northperrottcc.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=81&amp;Itemid=60 |title=The Club |publisher=North Perrott Cricket Club |accessdate=2010-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Courtesy of the Hoskyns family, North Perrott Cricket Club began using the ground in 1946.  In 1993, the club purchased the ground from the family, thanks in part to an anonymous sponsor, and a grant from the Sports and Arts Foundation.  Becoming owners of the ground, the club sought to build a pavilion, and after fund-raising and obtaining planning permission, the pavilion was officially opened in the 2000 season.  A couple of years later, the club built a new score-hut, and in 2004 upgraded to an electronic scoreboard.&lt;ref name="club history"/&gt;

===Usage by Somerset County Cricket Club===
[[File:North_perrott_pavilion.jpg|thumb|The pavilion, which was opened in 2000]]North Perrott Cricket Club Ground was first used by [[Somerset County Cricket Club]] in 1991, when their second XI played a [[Second XI Championship]] match against Glamorgan's seconds.  Somerset's seconds continued to use the ground regularly over the following years, playing 17 Second XI Championship matches and seven Second XI Trophy matches at the venue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/658_sec.html |title=Second XI Championship Matches played on North Perrott Cricket Club Ground (17) |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/658_set.html |title=Second XI Trophy Matches played on North Perrott Cricket Club Ground (7) |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Somerset Cricket Board]] team were also fixtures on the ground for four matches.  In addition to the first-round match against [[Wales Minor Counties Cricket Club|Wales Minor Counties]] in the [[Friends Provident Trophy|Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Trophy]], they were also scheduled to play three [[Minor Counties Trophy]] matches – two of these were abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/658_mint.html |title=Minor Counties Trophy Matches played on North Perrott Cricket Club Ground (1) |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In recent years, the ground has also been used by [[Somerset Women cricket team|Somerset women's cricket team]].  The women's side has no fixed home ground, playing at a variety of venues across the county, and first played at North Perrott in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/658_misc.html |title=Other matches played on North Perrott Cricket Club Ground (21) |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then, visits to the ground have become more regular, with over half of their home fixtures in 2009 and 2010 being played there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Seasons/ENG/2009_ENG_LV_Womens_County_Championship_2009.html |title=LV Women's County Championship 2009 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.somersetcountycc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/Womens/0,,11333,00.html |title=Somerset County Cricket Club / Fixtures / Womens |publisher=[[Somerset County Cricket Club]] |accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Raymond Chabot Grant Thornton Park''' (formerly '''JetForm Park''', '''Lynx Stadium''', and '''Ottawa Baseball Stadium'''), also known as '''RCGT Park''' is a [[baseball stadium]] in [[Ottawa]], Ontario, Canada with a seating capacity of 10,332.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.minorleaguebaseball.com/ballpark/page.jsp?ymd=20050518&amp;content_id=7018&amp;vkey=ballpark_t501&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;sid=t501 Lynx Stadium Facts]&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium is located in the city's east end near the interchange of [[Queensway (Ottawa)|Queensway]] and [[Riverside Drive (Ottawa)|Vanier Parkway]]. It has been used for minor-league professional baseball and music concerts since 1993.

==History==
The stadium was built to house the [[Ottawa Lynx]] of the International League and opened prior to the 1993 season. In its first season, the Lynx sold out 43 games and set an International League attendance record by averaging 9,772 fans per game.  However, annual attendance steadily declined from there, except for a modest increase in 2001. By 2006, Ottawa had the lowest average attendance in the league.&lt;ref name=CBC2006&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/ottawa/story/2006/08/25/lynx-fri.html | title=Baseball Lynx to stay in Ottawa, for now | date=25 August 2006 | accessdate=7 September 2009 | publisher=[[CBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lynx relocated after the 2007 season.

After the departure of the Lynx, the City of Ottawa considered other proposals for the site but kept the stadium as a baseball facility for the following season. Among the proposals rejected by the city in 2007 were:

* conversion of the stadium into the "Steelback Centre", a variable-use complex that could host 25,000 for concerts and 15,000 for sporting events as proposed by [[Frank D'Angelo]] of [[Steelback Brewery]];&lt;ref name=OBJSept07&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ottawabusinessjournal.com/289740073760027.php | accessdate=3 September 2007 | date=3 September 2007 | title=Businessman reveals ambitious plans for Lynx Stadium | first=Roman | last=Zakaluzny |work=[[Ottawa Business Journal]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928061259/http://www.ottawabusinessjournal.com/289740073760027.php |archivedate = 28 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* replacement of the stadium by a casino;&lt;ref name=OBJSept07 /&gt;
* replacement of the stadium with a larger Ottawa Congress Centre;&lt;ref name=OBJSept07 /&gt;
* redevelopment of the site as conventional retail or office space.&lt;ref name=OBJSept07 /&gt;

A new team, the [[Ottawa Rapidz]] of the [[Canadian American Association of Professional Baseball|Can-Am League]], was established in December 2007 and began to play in 2008. Despite attracting higher attendance than the Lynx in its final season, the Rapidz declared bankruptcy on September 29, 2009.&lt;ref name=CBCSep2008&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/ottawa-rapidz-go-under-1.733370 | title=Ottawa Rapidz go under | date=30 September 2008 | publisher=[[CBC News]] | accessdate=7 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A new team, the Voyageurs, was announced by the Can-Am league for the 2009 season. However, the league was faced with a lack of prospective owners for the team and with declining economic conditions and disbanded the Voyageurs in March 2009.&lt;ref name=CTVAug2009&gt;{{cite news | url=http://ottawa.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20090821/OTT_baseball_090821/20090821/?hub=OttawaHome | title=Owner making play for another Ottawa pro baseball team | date=21 August 2009 | publisher=[[CJOH-TV|CTV Ottawa]] | accessdate=7 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium remained unused in 2009 except for a late-August series of community baseball games sponsored by Ottawa city councillor [[Bob Monette]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://ottawacitizen.com/sports/Ottawa+stadium+idle+more/1942743/story.html |title=Ottawa stadium to be idle no more / Monette arranges for area teams to play games at field |first=Darren |last=Desaulniers |work=Ottawa Citizen |date=29 August 2009 |accessdate=7 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901011421/http://www.ottawacitizen.com/sports/Ottawa+stadium+idle+more/1942743/story.html |archivedate=1 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier, following the demise of the Voyageurs, Monette had suggested that the stadium be dismantled and the land sold to generate funds which could be applied to a new sports venue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://ottawa.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20090401/OTT_Stadium_090401?hub=OttawaHome | title=Councillors consider tearing down baseball stadium | publisher=[[CJOH-TV|CTV Ottawa]] | date=1 April 2009 | accessdate=7 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2009, area businessmen Dave Butler and Duncan MacDonald presented a proposal which would renovate the existing stadium facility for activities throughout the year, including use as a venue for [[Winterlude]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/ottawa/story/2009/08/24/ottawa-baseball-stadium.html | title=New Ottawa baseball pitch lands at city | date=24 August 2009 | accessdate=7 September 2009 | publisher=[[CBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, the [[Intercounty Baseball League]] voted 6–2 in favour of presenting the Ottawa Stadium Group with an expansion franchise that would play at the Ottawa Baseball Stadium&lt;ref&gt;[http://toronto.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20100226/OTT_baseball_return_ottawa_100226/20100226/?hub=OttawaHome CTV Ottawa- Baseball returns to play in Ottawa Stadium]&lt;/ref&gt; On March 10, 2010, the IBL confirmed that the application for an IBL expansion franchise had been accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=IBL CONFIRMS OTTAWA ENTRY FOR 2010 SEASON – 3/10/2010 |publisher=Intercounty Baseball League |date=10 March 2010 |url=http://www.theibl.ca/tml/content/NewsArticle.aspx?newsid=512&amp;page=1&amp;categoryid=0&amp;year=2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706205439/http://www.theibl.ca/tml/content/NewsArticle.aspx?newsid=512&amp;page=1&amp;categoryid=0&amp;year=2010 |archivedate=6 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new team, the [[Ottawa Fat Cats]], played from 2010 through 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://ottawacitizen.com/sports/local-sports/pro-baseball-returns-to-the-plate-in-ottawa | title=

After spending two years negotiating with various ownership groups to bring a double-A baseball franchise to Ottawa, including a prospective deal with [[Mandalay Sports Entertainment|Mandalay Baseball]] which required the city to invest $40 million in stadium renovations, the city signed a ten-year lease with the Can-Am League to field a team in 2015, named the [[Ottawa Champions]].&lt;ref name="Citizen-Double-A-rejected"&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Branding===
Ottawa company [[JetForm]] first bought the naming rights to the Stadium. The name was changed to simply "Lynx Stadium" after the 2002 season when JetForm changed its name to Accelio. Accelio was in turn bought by Adobe Systems. For the 2008 season, the Rapidz marketed the stadium as "Rapidz Stadium".

On March 12, 2015, it was announced that accounting firm [[Raymond Chabot Grant Thornton]] had signed a multi-year naming rights deal, giving the park its current name.&lt;ref name="rcgtpark"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ottawachampions.com/en/ottawa-champions-baseball-club-and-raymond-chabot-grant-thornton-announce-naming-rights-for-ottawa-stadium/ | title=Ottawa Champions Baseball Club and Raymond Chabot Grant Thornton Announce Naming Rights for Ottawa Stadium | publisher=[[Ottawa Champions]] | date=12 March 2015 | accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
The stadium is in the split-level design, with a concourse running around the middle of the seating bowl.  This concourse is at street level, so fans in the "lower" seats walk down, and fans in the "upper" seats walk up.  All seats are blue chair-back models.  Concessions, restrooms, a gift shop, and a kids' play area are located along a wider concourse (also at street level) located underneath the upper seats.

The stadium also features skyboxes and the "Upper Deck" restaurant (open to all fans) perched behind home plate.  While the windows do open, there is no outdoor seating at this level.  Access is by elevator from the concourse below.  There are open-air picnic tables down the left-field line which are also available to all fans.

Coventry Road runs along the left-field fence, and games can easily be seen from the street while driving or walking.  There is less than {{convert|50|ft|m}} of buffer between the stadium wall and the road, so flying balls can occasionally pose a hazard to passing cars.

==Concerts==

Concerts have been held at the stadium on rare occasions:

* July 19, 1998: Stardust Picnic with [[Blue Rodeo]], [[Great Big Sea]], [[54-40]], [[The Waltons (Canadian band)|The Waltons]] and [[Weeping Tile (band)|Weeping Tile]];&lt;ref name=Canoe2007 /&gt;

'''Scholastic wrestling''', sometimes known in the [[United States]] as '''folkstyle wrestling''', is a style of [[amateur wrestling]] practiced at the [[high school]] and [[middle school]] levels in the United States. This [[wrestling]] style is essentially [[collegiate wrestling]] with some slight modifications. It is practiced in 49 of the 50 [[U.S. state|states]] in the United States. When practiced by wrestling clubs of younger participants, scholastic wrestling is better known as "folkstyle".

According to an athletics participation survey taken by the [[National Federation of State High School Associations]], boys' wrestling ranked eighth in terms of the number of schools sponsoring teams, with 9,445 schools participating in the 2006-07 school year. Also, 257,246 boys participated in the sport during that school year, making scholastic wrestling the sixth most popular sport among high school boys. In addition, 5,048 girls participated in wrestling in 1,227 schools during the 2006-07 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Krisher | first = Cassie | title = High School Wrestling Rules Changes Announced for 2008-09 | publisher = [[National Federation of State High School Associations|NFHS]] | date = 2008-05-01 | url = http://www.nfhs.org/web/2008/05/high_school_wrestling_rules_chan.aspx | accessdate = 2008-11-05 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080521135733/http://www.nfhs.org/web/2008/05/high_school_wrestling_rules_chan.aspx | archivedate = 2008-05-21 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholastic wrestling is currently practiced in 49 of the 50 states; only [[Mississippi]] does not officially sanction scholastic wrestling for high schools and middle schools.

==History==
[[File:Wrestling glenninvite002.jpg|thumb|300px|In scholastic wrestling, great emphasis is placed on one wrestler's control of the opponent on the mat, usually by controlling the opponent's legs or torso. When a wrestler maintains restraining power over an opponent, as seen here, he is said to be in the position of advantage.]]

The history of scholastic wrestling in the United States is closely tied to the development of its college counterpart. The [[Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Association]] held its first tournament in 1905, which soon sparked many more wrestling tournaments for both [[college]] and [[university]] students and high school students.&lt;ref&gt;"Wrestling, Freestyle" by Michael B. Poliakoff from ''Encyclopedia of World Sport: From Ancient Times to the Present'', Vol. 3, p. 1191, eds. David Levinson and Karen Christensen (Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, Inc., 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; College and high school wrestling grew especially after the standardization of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) wrestling rules, which applied early on to both collegiate and scholastic wrestling (with high school modifications). More colleges, universities, and junior colleges began offering dual meets and tournaments, including championships and having organized wrestling seasons. There were breaks in wrestling seasons because of [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], but in the high schools especially, state association wrestling championships sprung up in different regions throughout the 1930s and 1940s. As amateur wrestling grew after World War II, various collegiate athletic conferences also increased the number and quality of their wrestling competition, with more wrestlers making the progression of wrestling in high school, being recruited, and entering collegiate competition. Girls' scholastic wrestling has somewhat fuzzy roots, as girls from time to time would join boys' teams as early as the 1970s, and there have been established various private girls wrestling clubs throughout the U.S.. Most notable among these athletes was National Wrestling Hall of Fame inductee, Tricia Saunders. However, the first official, public-school all-girls wrestling team was formed in Brookline High School in Brookline Massachusetts by coach Dustin Carter; the team of 15 girls was formed in 1993 and became an official public high school team three years later. The first official U.S. Girls Wrestling Nationals was held 1997.  Today, the various state high school associations continue to also host annual wrestling championships for individuals and for teams. At one time there could be no middle school wrestlers wrestling at the high school level, but today, middle school wrestlers can do this (according to procedures set out by their state association). In the past they could have had their wrestling eligibility taken away or other punishment.{{where|date=August 2014}} Generally, in all scholastic sports, when a middle schooler participates at a Varsity level, they can no longer compete in a Junior high or Middle School level (in that sport).

==Weight classes==
{{further|Wrestling weight classes}}
Scholastic wrestling is regulated by the [[National Federation of State High School Associations]] (NFHS). Each state high school association has adopted its wrestling rules, with each making some modifications. Every high school is expected to practice wrestling at two levels: [[varsity team|varsity]] and [[junior varsity team|junior varsity]], although wrestling at the freshmen (ninth grade) level is becoming more widespread. The NFHS generally sets the standard for weight classes for high school-level dual meets, multiple duals, and tournaments. In most [[U.S. state|states]], high school wrestlers can compete at 14 different weight classes, ranging from {{convert|106|lb|kg|abbr=on}} to the Heavyweight division of up to {{convert|285|lb|kg||abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = [[National Federation of State High School Associations]] | title = 2008-09 NFHS Wrestling Rules Book | publisher = [[National Federation of State High School Associations|NFHS]] | date = 2007-08-01 | page = 19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.howtowrestleincollege.com/2011/08/high-school-wrestling-basics/|title=High School Wrestling Basics- High School Wrestling Scoring Rules and Weight Classes|publisher=How To Wrestle in College|accessdate=29 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other states have additional or modified weight classes such as the {{convert|96|lb|kg|abbr=on}} weight class in states such as [[New York (state)|New York]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = [[New York State Public High School Athletic Association]] | title = 2008-2010 NYSPHSAA Handbook | work = pp. 118-19 | publisher = [[New York State Public High School Athletic Association|NYSPHSAA]] | date = 2008-08-01 | url = http://www.nysphsaa.org/handbook/pdf/Handbook_0810.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate = 2008-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the {{convert|98|lb|kg|abbr=on}} and {{convert|105|lb|kg|abbr=on}} weight classes in states such as [[Montana]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = [[Montana High School Association]] | title = 2008-09 Montana High School Association Handbook | work = p. 201 | publisher = [[Montana High School Association|MHSA]] | date = 2008-08-01 | url = http://www.mhsa.org/Handbook/2008-09Handbook/2008-09-Wrestling.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate = 2008-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the {{convert|180|lb|kg|abbr=on}} weight class in states such as [[Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = [[University Interscholastic League]] | title = 2008-09 Wrestling Manual | work = p. 34 | publisher = [[University Interscholastic League|UIL]] | date = 2008-08-01 | url = http://www.uil.utexas.edu/athletics/manuals/wrestling/pg24_51reg_season.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate = 2008-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Weight classes for junior varsity, freshman, and middle school teams may differ from state to state. Each state high school association that sanctions wrestling also has a defined weight-control plan that prohibits excessive weight loss and dehydration during the season. The plan would include at least a minimum 7 percent [[body fat]] for males and 12 percent body fat for females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = [[National Federation of State High School Associations]] | title = 2008-09 NFHS Wrestling Rules Book | publisher = [[National Federation of State High School Associations|NFHS]] | date = 2008-08-01 | page = 10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These weight control plans include provisions for weight assessment by the school's athletics medical staff, and certification of the lowest allowable weight class with the team's head coach and the person that performs the weight assessment. Often, this is done online through the website of the state high school association or the [[National Wrestling Coaches Association]] (NWCA). After the date of certification, a growth allowance of two pounds in each weight class may be allowed in some states. Many tournaments offer an allowance of one or two pounds, allowing wrestlers to compete in a certain class if they are within the allowance of making the weight limit for that class. All of this is done in order to protect the wrestler's health.
NWCA Official Weight Classes as of 2014-15:
106, 113, 120, 126, 132, 138, 145, 152, 160, 170, 182, 195, 220, 285.

== Season structure ==
The high school wrestling season customarily runs from October or November to March. Regular season competition begins in late October or early November and continues until February. Post-season competition usually continues from February to March (depending on, if individual wrestlers or teams qualify for a regional, sectional, or state championship). Normally, wrestling teams from two different [[high school]]s would compete in what is known as a "dual meet". It is possible for there also to be a "multiple dual", where more than two wrestling teams compete against each other at the same event on the same day. For example, one high school wrestling team may face another wrestling team for the first dual, and then a third wrestling team for the second dual. Also, those two wrestling teams may compete against each other in a dual meet as well. High schools often compete in regional, city-, or county-wide leagues.

===Dual meets===
Dual meets usually take place on evenings during the [[school week]], or on Saturday mornings, afternoons, or evenings during the wrestling season and begin with weigh-ins, shoulder-to-shoulder, at a maximum of one hour before the meet begins. Wrestlers may wrestle up only one weight class above the weight class that they are placed in, with some exceptions. If a wrestler fails to make weight, he either has to forfeit or weigh-in at a higher class. If a wrestler is suspected by a referee or coach of having a communicable skin disease, the wrestler can either be disqualified or provide written documentation from a physician that the skin disease is not communicable. If a meet physician is on-site, his or her judgment would overrule such documentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = [[National Federation of State High School Associations]] | title = 2008-09 NFHS Wrestling Rules Book | publisher = [[National Federation of State High School Associations|NFHS]] | date = 2008-08-01 | pages = 20–21 | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dual meets often feature one or two pound allowances, but in order to qualify for a league championship, wrestlers are required to weigh in without the benefit of a pound allowance (at "scratch weight") a certain number of times during the dual meet season. In all cases, after weigh-ins, the referee coordinates the random draw, which determines the sequence of weight classes for the dual meet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = [[National Federation of State High School Associations]] | title = 2008-09 NFHS Wrestling Rules Book | publisher = [[National Federation of State High School Associations|NFHS]] | date = 2008-08-01 | pages = 9, 28}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the random draw, the referee will call the wrestlers from each team who have been designated as captains. One of the captains will call a disk toss. The disk will then fall to the floor and determine: 1) which team has the choice of position at the start of the second period and 2) which one of the team's members is to appear first at the scorer's table when called by the referee for each weight class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = [[National Federation of State High School Associations]] | title = 2008-09 NFHS Wrestling Rules Book | publisher = [[National Federation of State High School Associations|NFHS]] | date = 2008-08-01 | pages = 9–10, 27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wrestler-captain who won the disk toss may choose the even or odd weight classes. That is, he may choose the weight classes, from lowest to highest, that are numbered evenly or oddly. The first weight class chosen in the random draw is odd. Thus, the rest of the weight classes are even and odd accordingly. For example, if the 120lb weight class is chosen in the random draw, then the 120lb, 132lb, 145lb, etc. weight classes would be odd, and the 126lb, 138lb, 152lb, etc. weight classes would be even. This order would work in the traditional sequence until the last even weight class of 113lb. 
[[File:Scholastic wrestling 2.jpg|frame|right|Figure four to the head]]&lt;ref name="WRB32"/&gt;

During a dual meet, both the junior varsity and varsity squads from the two involved schools compete against each other. The format of competition is as follows:

#The top junior varsity wrestler of each school compete against each other in an order determined by the random draw. The first weight class drawn starts the competition, with the following weight classes proceeding in order. For example, if the 152&amp;nbsp;lb weight class was drawn first, the matches would follow after that weight class up to the 285&amp;nbsp;lb match. The matches would then revert to 106&amp;nbsp;lb and proceed to 145&amp;nbsp;lb. The dual meet would then commence with each school's top junior varsity wrestler in the first weight class drawn. After that, the top junior varsity wrestlers then compete in the succeeding weight classes. Often if more than one junior varsity wrestler is at a certain weight class for each school, the coaches will hold an "exhibition match" which does not count towards the junior varsity team score but allows the wrestlers to gain more competitive experience. Sometimes matches are not scored for a winning team, allowing wrestlers to focus on skills and technique rather than winning. Sometimes if one school has two junior varsity wrestlers at the same weight and the other school only has one, the lone wrestler may wrestle both the other's wrestlers. It is also common for junior varsity wrestlers to compete against wrestlers one or two weight classes above or below them.
#After a break, the varsity matches commence in the same fashion as the junior varsity matches. However, there are no exhibition matches at the varsity level. Freshmen wrestling matches could also begin during the same time, or before the junior varsity matches.

===Tournaments===
[[File:Jon Goncalves001.jpg|thumb|250px|Often, a defensive wrestler will attempt to ''bridge'' (when in a supine position, to lift one's body up by the neck with the back arched away from the mat and only the feet and hands or the feet and head on the mat&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's Sports Dictionary'', p. 57, (Springfield, MA: G. &amp; C. Merriam Co. (now Merriam-Webster), 1976).&lt;/ref&gt;) out to escape the opponent's hold, particularly in a near fall or fall (pinning) situation.]]
Often, many high schools in the United States will compete in a tournament. This allows many schools to establish their rankings, not only for individual student-wrestlers, but also for high school teams as a whole (e.g., city, county, regional, sectional, and state wrestling championships). Tournaments are often sponsored by a high school or a state high school association and are held on Friday, Saturday, Sunday, or over any two days during the weekend. Admission is often charged to cover costs and make a small profit for the host. A tournament committee usually administers the event and after individual and team entries have been verified, the officials then determine the order of the matches (called "drawing") by certain brackets (e.g., brackets of eight, 16). The tournament officials when doing this drawing take into account each wrestler's win-loss record, previous tournament placements, and other factors that indicate the wrestler's ability. With that in mind, wrestlers who are noticed as having the most superior records are bracketed so that two top-ranked superior wrestlers in each weight class do not compete against each other in an early round. This is called "seeding". A tournament begins with weigh-ins, shoulder-to-shoulder, starting two hours or less before competition begins. An allowance of one pound is granted for each subsequent day of the tournament, up to a maximum of two pounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

With the drawing and weigh-ins completed, wrestlers then compete in two brackets in each of the 14 weight classes. Often, a tournament host will field a "house team" composed of junior varsity wrestlers from competing schools when there are open slots in the brackets. Tournaments are usually either varsity or junior varsity competitions. If there are not enough wrestlers to fill up the bracket in a weight class in the first round, a "bye" will be awarded to a wrestler who does not have to compete against another wrestler in his pairing. After taking account the number of byes, the first round in each weight class then begins. Most high school wrestling tournaments are in [[double elimination]] format. The last two wrestlers in the upper (championship) bracket wrestle for first place in the finals, with the loser winning second place. In other words, a wrestler cannot place higher than third if he is knocked down to the lower (consolation) bracket by losing in the championship semifinals. This is largely the result of time constraints: one-day tournaments often last into the evening. If the winner of the consolation bracket were allowed to challenge the winner of the championship bracket in the championship, the tournament could continue well past midnight before finishing.&lt;ref name=WRB5152&gt;{{cite book

  | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on how many places are scored, the consolation rounds would then commence, beginning among all of the wrestlers who lost to the winners of a certain round. For example, in tournaments scoring eight places, consolation rounds would begin with all of the wrestlers who lost to the winners of the first round matches. After the championship semifinals, the losers in the semifinals would be cross-bracketed into the consolation semifinals. The winner of the consolation finals would then win third place, with the loser winning fourth place. In tournaments where six places are awarded, the losers of the consolation semifinals would wrestle for fifth place, with the loser winning sixth place. If eight places are awarded, the losers of the consolation quarterfinals would wrestle for seventh place, with the loser winning eighth place, and so on. After the championships finals, the awards ceremony usually takes place with plaques, medals, trophies, or other awards given to the individual and team winners with the highest placements. Precise rules for tournaments may vary from one event to the next.&lt;ref name="WRB5152" /&gt;

For tournaments too large to properly accommodate all wrestlers, some host schools will implement a "carry-over" bracket system in order to finish a tournament within the standard time restrictions of a few days.  In said tournament, a wrestler will advance into the consolation bracket only if the winning opponent successfully advances into the finals.  In the first few rounds of the tournament, a single-elimination-type method is implemented.  For example, if a wrestler goes to a 64-person tournament, he or she must win at least one match before losing.  Upon the loss, the winning opponent will advance until he or she reaches the finals.  Only those wrestlers who advance to the round before the quarter finals and those who have lost to the wrestlers of the quarter finals may have a chance at placing in the tournament.  If our said wrestler wins the first match and loses the second match.  The second opponent must advance an additional three rounds before our wrestler will be guaranteed another match and opportunity to place in this tournament.  The carry-over system allows for more matches and a better siphoning process for large-scale tournaments by allowing only the best wrestlers to advance and giving the best of the losing opponents a chance to place in the tournament as well.  However, many complain about the carry-over system, as it doesn’t allow for those unseeded a fair opportunity in the tournament.

Each state or geographic area features two or three "elite" tournaments every year. These events are by invitation only and are called "Invitationals". Tournament sponsors (which are usually high schools, though sometimes colleges and universities) invite the best varsity wrestlers from their area to compete against each other. Many elite tournaments last two or even three days. For this reason, elite tournaments are often scheduled during the school's winter break. One of the most elite and longest-running high school wrestling invitational in the nation is hosted by [[Eagle Grove High School]] in [[Eagle Grove, Iowa]].

Between one season and the next, postseason tournaments and preseason tournaments are often held in scholastic wrestling and also in [[freestyle wrestling|freestyle]] and [[Greco-Roman wrestling|Greco-Roman]]. The most active wrestlers often take part in those to sharpen their skills and techniques. Also, clinics and camps are often held for both wrestlers and their coaches to help refresh old techniques and gain new strategies.

==Wrestling mat==
The match takes place on a thick rubber mat that is shock-absorbing to ensure safety.  A large outer circle at least 28 feet in diameter that designates the wrestling area is marked on the mat. The circumference line of that circle is called the boundary line. The wrestling area is surrounded by a safety mat area (or protection area) that is at least five inches in width. The mat area is designated by the use of contrasting colors or a {{convert|2|in|mm|adj=mid|-wide}} line, which is in bounds as of the 2011-2012 scholastic season. The wrestlers are within bounds when the supporting points (the weight-bearing points of the body, such as the feet, hands, knees, buttocks) of either wrestler are inside this boundary line.&lt;ref name=WRB11&gt;{{cite book

The mat can be no thicker than four inches nor thinner than a mat which has the shock-absorbing qualities of at least 1-inch (2.5&amp;nbsp;cm) PVC vinyl-covered foam. Inside the outer circle is usually an inner circle about 10 feet (3m) in diameter, designated by the use of contrasting colors or a {{convert|2|in|mm|adj=mid|-wide}} line. Wrestlers are encouraged to stay within this inner circle or else they risk being penalized for stalling (that is, deliberately attempting to slow down the action of the match). Each wrestler begins action at a starting line inside the inner circle that is three feet long. Two one-inch lines close the ends of the starting lines and are marked red for the wrestler from the visiting team and green for the wrestler from the home team. The two starting lines are 12&amp;nbsp;inches (30&amp;nbsp;cm) from outside to outside and form a rectangle in the middle of the wrestling area. This rectangle designates the starting positions for the three periods. All mats that are in sections are secured together. Additional padding may be added under the mat to protect the wrestlers.&lt;ref name=WRB11 /&gt; For younger age groups, one mat may be divided into halves or quarters so that multiple matches may be staged on a single mat.

==Equipment==
[[File:Pinned three seconds later.jpg|thumb|275px|Securing the fall, or pinning, is the supreme goal in all wrestling, as it also scores the most points in team competitions. This near fall situation is about to turn into a [[Pin (amateur wrestling)|fall]] in three seconds.]]
* A [[Wrestling singlet|singlet]] is a one-piece wrestling garment made of [[spandex]], [[nylon]] or [[lycra]]. It should provide a tight and comfortable fit for the wrestler, and prevents an opponent from using anything on the wrestler as leverage. The singlets are usually light or dark depending on whether the wrestlers are competing at home or abroad, and they are usually designed according to the school's or club's team colors. Wrestlers also have the option of wearing [[leggings]] with their singlets.&lt;ref name=WRB17 /&gt;
* A special pair of [[Wrestling shoes|shoes]] is worn by a wrestler to increase his mobility and flexibility. Wrestling shoes are light and flexible in order to provide maximum comfort and movement.

&lt;/ref&gt; while high school wrestling does not. Junior varsity and freshmen matches may be shorter than varsity matches in some states. Any differences in the length of time are explained by the fact that junior varsity and freshmen wrestlers are presumed to be younger, less skilled, and possibly in poorer shape than varsity wrestlers, though this may not always be the case. Period lengths vary for age groups below high school and are different from state to state.

The main official at the wrestling match is the [[Referee#Wrestling (amateur)|referee]], who is responsible for starting and stopping the match; observing all holds; signaling points; calling penalties such as illegal holds, unnecessary roughness, fleeing the mat, or flagrant misconduct; and finally observing a full view of and determining the fall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Period format===

====Pre-match====
Each wrestler is called by the referee, reports to the scorer's table, steps onto the mat, and may put on a &lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;green&lt;/span&gt; (for the home team) or &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;red&lt;/span&gt; (for the visiting team) anklet about two inches wide which the referee will use to indicate scoring. The [[referee]] then prepares the wrestlers to begin the first period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====First period====
The referee prepares both wrestlers for the first period by making sure each wrestler is correctly in the "neutral position". The neutral position has the two wrestlers standing opposite each other on their feet. Each wrestler starts with his lead foot on the green or red area of the starting lines, and his other foot even with or behind the lead foot. Both wrestlers then usually slightly crouch with their arms in front of them at or above waist level. In this position, neither wrestler is in control.&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's Sports Dictionary'', p. 282, (Springfield, MA: G. &amp; C. Merriam Co. (now Merriam-Webster), 1976).&lt;/ref&gt; When the referee is certain that both wrestlers are correctly in the neutral position, he blows the whistle to begin the first period (as well as whenever wrestling is resumed, such as at the beginning of the second and third periods, when contestants resume wrestling after going out of bounds, etc.). The match commences with each wrestler attempting to ''take down'' his opponent. There are various ways to accomplish this, such as taking a shot or completing a throw. The first period in high school [[Varsity team|varsity]] wrestling matches is two minutes long.&lt;ref name=WRB32&gt;{{cite book

====Second period====
If the match is not ended by a fall, technical fall, default, or disqualification, the referee then prepares both wrestlers to begin the second period. After the first period ends, one wrestler will have the choice of starting position in the second period. In dual meets, this is determined by the colored disk toss that took place before the meet began. In tournaments, the referee will toss a colored disk, with a &lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;green&lt;/span&gt;-colored side and a &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;red&lt;/span&gt;-colored side, and the winner of that disk toss will have the choice of position. The wrestler could choose between the neutral position, or to begin in what is called the "referee's position" on the mat. The referee's position has both wrestlers beginning action at the center of the mat with one wrestler (in the "defensive starting position") on the bottom with his hands spread apart in front of the forward starting line and his knees spread apart behind the rear starting line with his legs held together. The other wrestler on the top (in the "offensive starting position") then kneels beside him with one arm wrapped around the bottom wrestler's waist (with the palm of his hand against the opponent's navel) and the other hand on or over the back of the opponent's near elbow for control.&lt;ref name=WSD348&gt;''Webster's Sports Dictionary'', p. 348, (Springfield, MA: G. &amp; C. Merriam Co. (now Merriam-Webster), 1976).&lt;/ref&gt; The wrestler on the top must place his hand on the opponent's navel first, and then the elbow (this rule was recently instated in order to prevent the top wrestler's advantageous "slow arm" technique, where he/she can take advantage from placing his/her on the opponent's navel slowly).  The wrestler starting in the offensive position is in control of his opponent, and thus does not need to gain control to score nearfall points or a pin. The wrestler could also choose the defensive (bottom) position, where he would have the opportunity to score points for a reversal or an escape and a subsequent takedown, as riding time is not calculated in high school wrestling. The wrestler could also defer his choice to the beginning of the third period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[File:The Escape.jpg|thumb|225px|One of the scholastic wrestlers pictured here is escaping from his opponent's control for one point.]]
More recently, another starting position choice has been allowed, known as the "optional offensive starting position" or "optional start". After the wrestler with the choice (the offensive wrestler) indicates his intention to the referee, the referee lets the defensive wrestler adjust and begin in the defensive starting position. Next, the offensive wrestler goes to either side of the defensive wrestler or behind him, with all his weight supported by both his feet or by one or both knees. The offensive wrestler would then place both his hands on the opponent's back between the neck and the waist. When the referee starts the match by blowing the whistle, the defensive wrestler then has the opportunity to get back to his feet in a neutral position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The offensive wrestler must signal this intention to the referee before he comes set.

The second period is two minutes long.&lt;ref name=WRB32 /&gt;

====Third period====
If the match is not ended by a fall, technical fall, default, or disqualification, the referee then prepares both wrestlers to begin the third period. The wrestler who did not choose the starting position for the second period now chooses the starting position. The third period is also two minutes long.&lt;ref name=WRB32 /&gt;



=====Sudden victory period=====
If the third period ends in a tie, a one-minute sudden victory period occurs.  Both wrestlers start in the neutral position. The first wrestler to score a point wins.&lt;ref name=WRB3536&gt;{{cite book

[[File:16bc27a.jpg|frame|900px|right|The referee raises the winners arm in victory after every match]]

=====Tiebreaker periods=====
If no points are scored in the sudden victory period, two 30-second tiebreaker periods occur. Both wrestlers start in the referee's position. The wrestler who won a colored disk toss made by the referee has the choice of either top or bottom position, and he may NOT defer the choice to his opponent. After the wrestler makes the choice, the two contestants then wrestle. Either of the two wrestlers must try to score as many points as he can. Once one 30-second period is over, the wrestler who did not have the choice in the previous period may choose to start the new period from the top or bottom. Whoever scores the most points (or is awarded a fall, default, or disqualification) wins the match.&lt;ref name=WRB3536 /&gt;

=====Ultimate tiebreaker period=====
If no points were scored or the score is still tied after the two 30-second tiebreaker periods, a final ultimate tiebreaker period is used. The ultimate tiebreaker period lasts for 30 seconds. Both wrestlers also start in the referee's position. The wrestler who scored the first points in regulation (except in the case of double-stalling or simultaneous penalties) has the choice of top or bottom position, or he may defer the choice to the opponent. If no points were scored in the regulation match, the winner of a colored disk toss will have the choice of position. After the wrestler makes his choice, the two contestants then wrestle. The person in the bottom position must then escape or reverse his opponent to get the win. If the wrestler in the offensive (top) position rides the defensive (bottom) wrestler (that is, keeps the defensive wrestler under control in the position of advantage) for the entire 30 seconds, he wins the match and is awarded one point. Wrestlers may still be awarded points for near falls, and a fall terminates the bout.&lt;ref name=WRB3536 /&gt;

===Post-match===
After the match is completed, regardless of the victory condition, the wrestlers will return to the center of the mat (on the 10-foot inner circle) while the referee checks with the scorer's table. Upon the referee's return to the mat, the two wrestlers shake hands, and the referee declares the winner by raising the winner's hand. While not stipulated by the rules, it is customary for both contestants to then shake the hand of the opposing team's coach(es). Both contestants then return to their team benches from the mat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Match scoring===
[[File:2006-02-25 State Open 274.jpg|thumb|235px|A near fall can be scored when the defensive wrestler is held either in a high bridge or on both elbows, as shown.]]
In scholastic wrestling, points are awarded mostly on the basis of control. Control occurs when a wrestler has gained restraining power over an opponent, usually, by controlling the opponent's legs and torso. When a wrestler gains control and maintains restraining power over an opponent, he is said to be in the "position of advantage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[File:Going in for the pin!.jpg|thumb|left|175px|A near fall can also be scored when the defensive wrestler is held with one shoulder on the mat and one shoulder at an angle of 45 degrees or less toward the mat, as shown.]]
* '''Takedown''' ('''2 points'''): A wrestler is awarded two points for a takedown when, from the neutral position, he gains control by taking the other wrestler down to the mat in bounds and beyond reaction time, and the supporting point(s) of either wrestler are in bounds.  This is most often accomplished by attacking the legs of the opponent, although various throws can also be used to bring a wrestler down to the mat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

* '''Near Fall''': This is similar to the points for "exposure" or the "danger position" awarded in the international styles of wrestling, but the emphasis for near falls is on control, not risk. Near fall criteria is met when: (1) the offensive wrestler holds the defensive wrestler in a high bridge or on both elbows; (2) the offensive wrestler holds any part of both his opponent's shoulders or scapulae (shoulder blades) within four inches of the mat; or (3) the offensive wrestler controls the defensive wrestler in such a way that one of the bottom wrestler's shoulders or scapulae, or the head, is touching the mat, and the other shoulder or scapula is held at an angle of 45 degrees or less to the mat. The referee counts the seconds off.&lt;ref name="National Federation of State High School Associations 23–24, 47"&gt;{{cite book

Much of the criteria for the near fall was used in a former scoring opportunity known as ''predicament'' in scholastic wrestling.&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's Sports Dictionary'', pp. 279-280, (Springfield, MA: G. &amp; C. Merriam Co. (now Merriam-Webster), 1976).&lt;/ref&gt; When near fall points are given after the opponent is injured, signals an injury, or bleeds excessively, it is a consequence of what is sometimes referred to as the ''scream rule''.

:: ('''2 points''') - Two points are given when near fall criteria is met for two to four seconds. Two points can also be granted in cases where a pinning combination is executed legally and a near fall is imminent, but the defensive wrestler is injured, signals an injury, or bleeds excessively before the near fall criterion is met.&lt;ref name="National Federation of State High School Associations 23–24, 47"/&gt;
[[File:Wrestling falconfrenzy026.jpg|thumb|195px|A near fall situation can also occur if both shoulders are within four inches of touching the mat, as shown.]]

:: ('''3 points''') - Three points are given when near fall criteria is met for five seconds or more.  After five seconds, the referee awards three points and stops counting.

* '''Penalty''' ('''1 or 2 points'''): One or two points can be awarded by the referee to the opponent for various penalty situations. "Unsportsmanlike conduct" by the wrestler includes swearing, teasing the opponent, etc. "Unnecessary roughness" involves physical acts during the match that exceed normal aggressiveness. "Flagrant misconduct" includes actions (physical or nonphysical) that intentionally attack the opponent, the opponent's team, or others in a severe way. Illegal holds are also penalized accordingly, and potentially dangerous holds are not penalized, but the match will be stopped by the referee. Also, "technical violations" such as stalling, interlocking hands, and other minor infractions are penalized. With some situations, such as stalling, a warning is given after the first occurrence, and if there is another occurrence the penalty point is given. In other situations, there is no warning and penalty points are automatically given. In general, after a certain number of occurrences where penalty points are given, the penalized wrestler is disqualified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Victory conditions==
[[File:Wrestling falconfrenzy065.jpg|thumb|180px|A [[Pin (amateur wrestling)|fall]], also known as a [[Pin (amateur wrestling)|pin]], occurs when any part of both [[shoulder]]s or both [[scapula|scapulae (shoulder blades)]] of the defensive wrestler is held in continuous contact with the mat for a specified amount of time (in scholastic wrestling for two seconds).]][[File:Wrestling falconfrenzy053.jpg|thumb|180px|Falls (or pins) can be attained in many different technique combinations. The pinning situation seen here is that from a double arm tie-up. The wrestler later secured the fall.]]
A match can be won in the following ways:
* '''Win by pin''': The object of the entire wrestling match is to attain victory by what is known as the fall. A fall, also known as a pin, occurs when one wrestler holds any part of both of his opponent's shoulders or both of his opponent's shoulder blades in continuous contact with the mat for two seconds at the high school level&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and lower levels. The fall ends the match immediately, and the offensive wrestler who secured the fall is declared the winner. Falls (or pins) can be attained in many different ways. The most common way of securing the fall is through the various [[nelson hold]]s, in particular, the [[Nelson hold#Half nelson|half nelson]]. Other techniques used to secure falls are ''[[Cradle (wrestling)|cradles]]'', the [[Grappling hold|''headlock'' (''head and arm'')]], single or double ''armbars'' (''bar arms''), the ''leg Turk'', the ''reverse body lock'', the ''guillotine'', the ''leg split'' (also known as the ''banana split'' or ''spread eagle''), the ''spladle'', the ''[[Compressive asphyxia|straight body scissors]]'', and the [[Grappling hold|''double grapevine'']] (also called the ''Saturday night ride'').

* '''Win by technical fall''': If a fall is not secured to end the match, a wrestler can win a match simply by points. If a wrestler can secure an advantage of 15 points over an opponent, then the wrestler can win the match by "[[technical fall]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

If the 15-point advantage is gained while the offensive wrestler has his opponent in a pinning situation, the match would continue to allow the offensive wrestler to secure the fall. If the offensive wrestler is unable to secure a fall, the match ends once a near fall situation is no longer seen by the referee or when the wrestlers return to the neutral position.

* '''Win by major decision''': If no fall or technical fall occurs, a wrestler can also win simply by points. If the match concludes, and a wrestler has a margin of victory of eight or more points over an opponent, but under the 15 points needed for a technical fall, the win is known as a "major decision".&lt;ref name=WRB48&gt;{{cite book

* '''Win by decision''': If the match concludes, and a wrestler has a margin of victory of less than eight points over an opponent, or wins the first point in a sudden victory period in overtime without gaining a fall, default, or a win by an opponent's disqualification, the wrestler then wins by "decision".&lt;ref name=WRB48 /&gt;
* '''Win by default''': If for any reason, a wrestler is unable to continue competing during the match (e.g., because of injury, illness), his opponent is awarded victory by "default".

===Team scoring in dual meets===
On the high school level in a "dual meet", the wrestler not only wins the match for himself, but also gains points for his team. The number of points awarded to a team during a dual meet depends on the victory condition.&lt;ref&gt;The reference for team points awarded during dual meets is found here: {{cite book

In a dual meet, when all team points are totaled, the team with the most points wins the competition. In all victory cases, the junior varsity and varsity competitions are scored separately.  If there is a tie between teams, the tie is broken by one team point being awarded to the winning team based on certain criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Team scoring in tournaments===
In a tournament, most of the team points are scored for advancement. For example, a team winning a match in the championship bracket would be awarded two team advancement points; one advancement point would be awarded if a team won a match in the consolation bracket. The corresponding team points also apply if a wrestler from the team gained a bye and then won his next match in that bracket. Two additional points are for victories by fall, default, disqualification, and forfeit. One and one-half additional points are awarded for technical fall victories. One additional point is awarded for major decisions. A team could then win a certain number of placement points if its wrestlers have placed individually in the championship and consolation brackets. Thus, whole teams are awarded placements (first, second, etc.) based on their total number of victories.&lt;ref name="National Federation of State High School Associations 49–50"&gt;{{cite book
  | last = [[National Federation of State High School Associations]]

  | location =
  | pages = 49–50
  | url =
  | doi =
  | id =  
  | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual placement points are also awarded as given minimum placements are clinched. For example, in a tournament scoring eight places, the winner of a quarterfinal in the championship bracket (where first and second places are awarded) would win three place points. The winner of a semifinal in the championship bracket would win nine place points. The winners of first and second place would then win four additional place points. In the consolation bracket (where third and fifth places are awarded), those wrestlers who reach the quarterfinal round will receive one place point. The winner of a semifinal match in the consolation bracket would receive four place points. The winners of third and fifth place would receive two additional place points. The winner of seventh place would receive one additional place point, and so on.&lt;ref name="National Federation of State High School Associations 49–50"/&gt; A more detailed account of how individual and team points are awarded for tournaments is given on pages 47 to 50 of the ''2008-09 NFHS Wrestling Rules Book''.

==Folkstyle - age-group level==
At young ages, independent tournaments are often run in the [[Freestyle wrestling|freestyle]] and [[Greco-Roman wrestling|Greco-Roman]] styles. There are also tournaments where wrestlers compete in a style very similar to collegiate or high school (scholastic) wrestling.To differentiate this style from freestyle and Greco-Roman, the term "folkstyle wrestling" is a more commonly used phrase than the term collegiate wrestling or scholastic wrestling. In many places in the [[United States]], there are small associations known as wrestling clubs designed to introduce young people to the sport of wrestling, many of whom are even as young as 3 to 5 years old. Often these wrestling clubs are benefitted by the experience of older wrestlers, particularly those who wrestle in middle school and high school. The rules governing youth matches largely correspond to those of the [[National Federation of State High School Associations]] (NFHS), with shorter periods (generally, depending on the age divisions, the periods typically last anywhere from one to one and a half minutes) and other modifications.

The injuries sustained while participating in scholastic wrestling are as follows. 68% of injuries are due to lack of training while participating in conditioning (asthma attacks, etc.) 21% of injuries are sustained to the ankles of participants. 8% of those injuries are sustained while in conditioning. Injuries in matches stand at 11%, with 83% of injuries sustained to the ankles due to weak shoewear, and to the groin.

&lt;/ref&gt;

There is, however, much less visible organization of wrestling in the freestyle and Greco-Roman styles for young wrestlers, especially at the high school and college age levels. Many high school and college students do compete in freestyle and Greco-Roman dual meets and tournaments however with great success, some of which are on the regional and national levels.

Similarly, the differences between collegiate (folkstyle) wrestling and the international styles are enough to create potential disadvantages to the wrestlers not growing up focusing on the international styles. However, some would argue that the real reason the United States does not typically fare as well in international wrestling competitions is because of the greater focus much of the rest of the world places on the sport. [[USA Wrestling]] and the [[Amateur Athletic Union]] currently sponsors duals, state, regional, and national competitions in folkstyle, freestyle, and Greco-Roman for elementary and middle school age students, as well as for all ages.

==Unhealthy weight loss==
Cutting weight is a common occurrence in the sport of wrestling.  The process of cutting weight allows a wrestler to compete at a lower weight class, facing lighter opponents.  The advantage is gained when the wrestler loses only water-weight and fat-weight, but retains lean body mass.  The wrestler then re-hydrates himself after weighing-in but before competition begins.  If done properly, a wrestler who does cut weight can gain a very significant strength and weight advantage over opponents who do not.

Unfortunately, cutting weight is often done in an unhealthy way which can cause negative conditions both in the short and the long term. [[Dehydration]] can result when a wrestler severely reduces intake of fluids while maintaining rigorous daily workouts. This may result in [[cramps]] or rarely, in extreme cases, [[heatstroke]] and swelling of the brain which causes [[seizures]] and [[hypovolemic shock]].  Malnutrition can also result if cutting weight over long periods of time.  Long term weight cutting can mean that a wrestler does not intake essential nutrients like protein, calories, vitamin B, vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, iron, and zinc; this can result in [[Clinical depression|depression]], [[muscular atrophy]], and [[fevers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Some wrestlers, if weigh-in time is approaching and they have not yet reached their weight class, will resort to desperate measures such as throwing up or abusing diuretics to quickly lose the remaining weight.  Extreme weight cutting can have similar effects to [[anorexia nervosa]] and [[bulimia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Every state in American high school wrestling uses national hydration assessment tests. These tests analyze body fat percentages at the alpha weight and determine how much weight a wrestler can lose each week.  When a wrestler reaches the minimum body fat percentage of 7% of their alpha fat composition it is illegal for the wrestler to cut any more weight (12% for females).  This system is meant to make cutting weight as healthy as possible and reduce the negative side effects of cutting.

'''Stafford Common''' is home to [[Garden Village F.C.|Garden Village Football Club]], based in the village of [[Kingsbridge, Swansea|Kingsbridge]] in the west of [[Swansea]].

==Pitches==
There are three full size pitches, one of them used by the two senior teams who play in the Welsh Football League (first team in Division 2 and the second team in Reserve Division West).

The other two pitches are used by the two senior teams who play in the Carmarthenshire League (third team in Division 1 and fourth team in Reserve Division 1) as well as the Junior sides and Swansea City Ladies.

The main pitch at Stafford Common is also used to host local and regional cup ties, including finals. And in September 2010 it hosted its first ever international - Wales women's Under-17 side beat Belgium 1-0 to register their first ever win at that level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thisissouthwales.co.uk/Angharad-seals-win-U17s/story-12436239-detail/story.html | work=This is South Wales | title=Angharad seals first win for U17s | accessdate=12 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==
There is a clubhouse at the ground situated between the car park and the changing room facility, which consists of a bar, plasma television screen, a pool table and plenty of seating.

The changing rooms were opened in July 2005 by the President of the club, Mr. Jack Thomas. There are four full-size changing rooms available to cater for two matches at a time, a treatment room and disabled toilet facilities are also available.

New floodlights have been added to Stafford Common in January 2011. This is a major development and has been eagerly anticipated for years.

{{Infobox Beverage
|name = Staminade
|image= [[Image:Staminade logo.png|200px]]
|manufacturer= [[Steric Pty Ltd]]
|type= [[Sports drink]]
|origin= Australia
|introduced=1970s
}}

'''Staminade''' is the first sports drink to be commercially manufactured and marketed in Australia, available in Australian retail outlets since the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Staminade website|url=http://www.staminade.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Staminade advertisement|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/110346091?searchTerm=staminade&amp;searchLimits=sortby=dateAsc|accessdate=27 February 2016|newspaper=The Canberra Times|date=31 March 1971|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Staminade is owned by an Australian company, Steric Trading Pty Ltd and manufactured in [[Villawood, New South Wales|Villawood]], New South Wales, Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Steric Trading website|url=http://www.steric.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sports drink ==
Staminade is a sports drink as described under standard 2.6.2 in the Australia New Zealand Food Standards code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code – Standard 2.6.2 – Non-Alcoholic Beverages and Brewed Soft Drinks|url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2013C00145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Powder ==
A 585-gm tub of Staminade powder made nine litres of Staminade drink when mixed with water.  Directions for mixing recommended that one scoop of powder be mixed with 250ml chilled or iced water.
 
Staminade produced 19g powder sachets (one sachet makes up 350ml) and a one kilogram powder tub which made up to 21 litres of sports drink.  These two options were only available to wholesale food service customers.

Since 2015 Staminade has only been available as a powder in 550g tubs with a changed formulation using [[sucrose]] as the primary ingredient.

== Concentrate ==
In 2005 Staminade concentrate was available in a 750-ml bottle.

From September 2013 to 2015, Staminade concentrate was packaged in a one-litre bottle which made five litres of Staminade drink.  Directions for mixing recommended that 50ml of concentrate be mixed with 200ml of water to make 250ml of sports drink. Its primary non-water ingredient was [[glucose]].

The concentrate is now discontinued.

== Staminade flavours ==
*Lemon lime fusion ''(powder)''
*Wild berry rush ''(powder)'' 
*True Blue ''(discontinued)''

== Staminade formulation ==
Staminade is formulated to contain sodium and potassium levels at 16.4&amp;nbsp;mmol per litre and 4.8&amp;nbsp;mmol per litre.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Staminade powder when made up according to directions claims to have an osmomolality of approximately 275milliOsmol per litre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Osmolality and pH of sport and other drinks available in Switzerland|url=http://www.sgsm.ch/fileadmin/user_upload/Zeitschrift/54-2006-3/Osmolality_54_3_06.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2010 the powder formulation of Staminade was changed to use [[Sucrose]] as its primary ingredient instead of [[dextrose]] as the primary sweetener and source of energy. The liquid concentrate used glucose as its primary ingredient and acesulphame potassium as a sweetener.

Prior to the change of using sucrose as its primary ingredient, Staminade was the only large commercially made sports drink in Australia that did not use sucrose as its primary ingredient. Sucrose has been commonly cited as a primary cause of tooth decay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tooth decay &amp; sugary drinks|url=http://www.rethinksugarydrink.org.au/facts/tooth-decay.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Magnesium ==
Staminade was the first ready-to-drink sports drink available in Australia to add magnesium to its formula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aussie icon Staminade tackles US sports drink giants, Dynamic Business, June 21, 2010|url=https://www.dynamicbusiness.com.au/entrepreneur-profile/staminade-tackles-gatorage-powerade-sports-drinks-1703.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Staminade powder contains magnesium lactate and Staminade concentrate contained magnesium sulphate.

[[File:Squawandchild.jpg|thumb|175px|Native American woman using a tumpline]]
[[Image:SillaCatherwood.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Tumplines in use in [[Mexico]]]]

A '''tumpline''' (/tump-lyne/) is a [[strap]] attached at both ends to a sack, [[backpack]], or other [[luggage]] and used to carry the object by placing the strap over the top of the head.  This utilizes the [[Vertebral column|spine]] rather than the [[shoulder]]s as standard backpack straps do.  Tumplines are not intended{{by whom?|date=December 2018}} to be worn over the forehead, but rather over the top of the head just back from the hairline, pulling straight down in alignment with the spine.  The bearer then leans forward, allowing the back to help support the load.&lt;ref&gt;Conover, Garrett, 1991. Beyond The Paddle - A Canoeist's Guide to Expedition Skills: Poling, Lining, Portaging and Maneuvering through Ice.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tumplines are often{{quantify|date=December 2018}} used to transport heavy loads across uneven terrain such as [[Trail|footpaths]] and [[portage]]s.  The ''[[voyageurs]]'' of the [[North America]]n [[fur trade]] used tumplines exclusively to carry their cargoes of pelts and rations across portages.

Backpacks for the military and recreational campers were redesigned to carry larger loads during the middle and late twentieth century, and tumplines have become less common in the developed world.

The indigenous natives in Mexico (and other Latin American countries) traditionally have used the tumpline for carrying heavy loads, such as firewood, baskets (including baskets loaded with construction materials and dirt for building), bird cages, and furniture. In the 1920s a man  delivered pianos in Mexico City on his back using a tumpline.{{cn|date=December 2018}} In Mexico a common name for ''tumpline'' is "mecapal". Modern highland Mayans of southern Mexico use tumplines for various pedestrian transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Brill |first= David |title= In Focus, National Geographic Greatest Portraits |year= 2004 |origyear= 1975 |pages= 344–345 |quote= 'Mayan Children in the Mexican Highlands', photo of Maya girl [ca. age 10], man [ca. age 60], and boy [ca. age 13]. The girl has a [[bandana]] tumpline across the top of her head with each end tied to each side of a cloth sack; the man has a narrow woven-strap tumpline across top of head.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During World War Two, the Canadian Army developed special supply-packs with tumplines for moving supplies over rough terrain.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Tusker Football Club''' is a football club based in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]]. It is the third most successful club in Kenya with eleven Kenyan league championships and four Kenyan cup wins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[RSSSF]]|author=Stokkermans, Karel|title=Kenya&amp;nbsp;– List of Champions|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesk/kenyachamp.html|date=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[RSSSF]]|author1=Jönsson, Mikael  |author2=King, Ian |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Kenya&amp;nbsp;– List of Cup Winners|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesk/kenyacuphist.html|date=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it has won four East African [[CECAFA Clubs Cup]] titles.

Formed in 1969, the club is sponsored by [[East African Breweries]] and its name refers to [[Tusker (beer)|Tusker]], a well-known beer brand by the company. The club was known as '''Kenya Breweries''' until 1999, when the current name was adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Michezo Afrika|author=Machio, Dennis|title=Tusker FC receives new bus and 1Million bonus|url=http://www.michezoafrika.com/kpl/tusker-fc-receives-new-bus-and-1million-bonus/3860.aspx|date=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tusker play their home games at the Kinoru Stadium in Meru.
