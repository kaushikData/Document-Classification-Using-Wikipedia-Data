{{for|the band|Action Item}}
In [[management]], an '''action item''' is a documented event, task, activity, or [[action (philosophy)|action]] that needs to take place. Action items are discrete units that can be handled by a single person.

==Planning actions==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2007}}
Action items are usually created during a discussion by a group of people who are [[meeting]] about one or more topics and during the discussion it is discovered that some kind of action is needed.  The act required is then documented as an action item and usually assigned to someone, usually a member of the group.  The person to whom the action is assigned is then obligated to perform the action and report back to the group on the results.

Action items are usually documented in the meeting [[minutes]] and are recorded in the [[task list]] of the group.  As people complete action items, the items are documented as being completed and the item is removed from the list of outstanding action items.

==Attributes==
There are many attributes that can be associated with an action item - e.g.:
* Identifier - Unique mark to reference event or item.
* Description - Short explanation of activity to be performed
* Work stream - Business requirements, technical design, user interface, commit checklist, commit gate materials, etc. (optional)
* Issue or Risk - Associated with a project issue or risk
* Status - Open, In Progress, Resolved, Canceled
* Urgency/Priority - What is the impact to your project's critical path?
* Comments - Description of what is now being done to solve the issue
* Owner - Who is responsible for actively working the issue?
* Created Date - Date issue was opened
* Planned completion date - When will this issue be solved?
* Actual completion date - Date issue was closed

==Tracking==
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2007}}
A usual format for an action item is to record an action item number, the date when the action item is identified or created, the name of the person to whom the action is assigned, a title description of the action, a more detailed description of the action and its outcomes, and its deliverables.

An action item can be considered a more general form of various types of action/issue/defect tracking methods.  For instance, a [[bug report]] is a form of action item as is a service report created by a service company to track a problem reported by a customer or an [[Return Merchandise Authorization|RMA]] number.

Follow up in a consistent and timely manner with the responsible individual(s) to track their progress and drive the action item to resolution.

It is important to understand the distinction here that we track to resolution and not to completion.  While it is the goal to have every action item completed, there are numerous scenarios in which the action item may no longer be relevant or completion may not be possible.

==Software==

There are a number of software applications for tracking action items or service reports.  These applications are used within software development organizations as well as in customer support functions.  Because these software applications facilitate group communication, they are often referred to as [[Collaborative software]] or groupware.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}. Various such software are available in the market. They are known to increase the productivity of Managers.

Many information technology support groups use some kind of service report software so that when a trouble report is called in, the person answering the telephone will create a trouble ticket to track the issue.  The trouble ticket is assigned to a member of the IT services organization who then visits the person who has reported a problem and resolves the problem.  The IT services person will then close out the trouble ticket indicating the issue has been resolved.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

Recent research at the Computational Semantics Lab at [[Stanford University]] seeks to automatically identify action items and extract their properties (the ''what'', ''who'', and ''when'' of the action item) using [[automatic speech recognition]] transcripts from spontaneous, multi-party conversations during meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/sigdial06.pdf|title=Automatically Detecting Action Items in Audio Meeting Recordings|website=Stanford EDU|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Advertising Research Foundation''' (ARF) is a nonprofit [[trade association|industry association]] for creating, aggregating, synthesizing and sharing knowledge in the fields of [[advertising]] and [[mass media|media]]. It was founded in 1936 by the [[Association of National Advertisers]] and the [[American Association of Advertising Agencies]]. Its stated mission is to improve the practice of [[advertising]], [[marketing]] and media research in pursuit of more effective marketing and advertising communications. Its membership consists of over 400 [[advertiser]]s, [[Advertising agency|advertising agencies]], research firms, [[Media proprietor|media companies]], educational institutions and international organizations.&lt;ref name="AllBusiness"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

The ARF conducts several research initiatives. It publishes the ''Journal of Advertising Research'', a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] academic [[periodical]]. It also sponsors a variety of advertising-related [[marketing research]] endeavours and hosts periodic conferences on advertising and media-related topics. The ARF operates the ''Roy Morgan Information Center'' as a clearinghouse for advertising research, promulgating industry standards and guidelines, and it provides training and administers the annual ''[[David Ogilvy (businessman)|David Ogilvy]] Awards Program''.

The ARF has a '''Knowledge Center''' which houses historical reports, papers and videos developed during the formative years of the advertising research industry which are not available anywhere else. Established in 1953 to serve as a central resource for the wealth of materials relating to advertising research, the ARF Knowledge Center also offers specialized tools and services to help ARF members keep up-to-date with the latest knowledge that is applicable to their business needs.

== History ==
The Advertising Research Agency was formed in 1936.  During its first 15 years, ARF sponsored over 200 studies including studies involving newspapers, farm magazines, business magazines, and an executive management publication.

In the beginning of the 1950s the ARF began working with media companies in addition to advertisers and agencies.  The agency supervised a study on household ownership of radio &amp; television sets in 1954.  It also published "Recommended Standards for Radio &amp; Television Program Audience Size Measurements," in 1954.  In 1955 the ARF influenced the U.S. Census Bureau to include a TV ownership question in its questionnaires.  Research companies were invited to become ARF members in 1967.

&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1990s, the ARF spearheaded notable [[primary research]] in studies such as the ''Copy Research Validity Project'', which redefined the area of [[copy testing]], and the ''ARF/Ad Council Study'' to determine the impact of [[public service advertising]].&lt;ref name="AllBusiness"/&gt; More recently, the ARF has pioneered efforts to define [[Engagement (marketing)|advertising engagement]] and to measure consumers' emotional responses to advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Aída M. Álvarez''' (born 1950) is a Puerto Rican businesswoman and politician. She is the first [[Latino|Latina]] woman to hold a [[United States Cabinet]]-level position, as the Administrator of the Small Business Administration, during Bill Clinton's presidency.

==Early years==
Alvarez was born in [[Aguadilla, Puerto Rico]] into a family of modest economical means, who despite their hardships always encouraged her to pursue her dreams. After she received her primary education in Puerto Rico, her family moved to [[New York City]] in hopes of improving their economic situation. In New York, she attended high school and participated in a program called "ASPIRA". "ASPIRA" was founded by [[Antonia Pantoja|Dr. Antonia Pantoja]] and has helped disadvantaged children, especially girls, gain the leadership skills and knowledge required to go to college.

Álvarez applied and was accepted at [[Radcliffe College]] of [[Harvard University]] where in 1971 she earned her [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree, graduating ''cum laude''. During her student years many people provided her with support.

==Journalist for the ''New York Post''==
Álvarez began her career as a [[journalist]] for the ''[[New York Post]]'' and won a "Front Page Award". She later became a news reporter and [[anchor]] for Metromedia Television (Channel Five) also in New York. In 1982, she won an [[Associated Press]] Award for Excellence and she was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] for her reporting of guerilla activities in [[El Salvador]].&lt;ref name="Gale"&gt;[http://gale.cengage.com/free_resources/chh/bio/alvarez_a.htm Gale Cengage learning] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227053753/http://gale.cengage.com/free_resources/chh/bio/alvarez_a.htm |date=December 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Álvarez ventured into the banking business by becoming an investment banker at the [[First Boston Corporation]] and at [[Bear Stearns]]. As a public servant, she spent two years at the NYC Health and Hospitals Corp. She was also a commissioner on the New York City Charter Revision Commission and a member of the Mayor's (NYC) Committee on Appointments. On June 1993, Álvarez was named Director of the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight. She created a financial safety and soundness oversight program for [[Fannie Mae]] and [[Freddie Mac]].&lt;ref name="Gale"/&gt;

==Small Business Administration==
[[File:President Clinton meeting with advisers on Air Force One.jpg|thumb|250px| Aída Álvarez with President Clinton and Clinton administration advisers on Air Force One]]
In 1997, Álvarez was appointed by [[Bill Clinton|President Bill Clinton]], Administrator of the [[Small Business Administration]], thus becoming the first Hispanic woman and Puerto Rican to serve as an executive officer in the U.S. Cabinet. She directed the delivery of a comprehensive set of financial and business development programs for [[United States|American]] small businesses. The agency provided financing worth eleven billion dollars a year to small businesses across the nation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ns.umich.edu/htdocs/releases/story.php?id=2941 University of Michigan News]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Álvarez was elected to the Board of Overseers of Harvard University. Her role is to visit the graduate schools, departments and museums of the University to ensure that the University remains true to its Charter as a place of learning. She also serves on the National Trust for Historic Preservation; the Coalition for Supportive Housing and is on the Board of Trustees of the [[Latino Community Foundation]].&lt;ref name="Gale"/&gt;

During the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 Presidential Election]], Álvarez was named official spokeswoman for [[Senator]] [[John Kerry]]. Álvarez had met Kerry during her days as the Small Business Administration administrator. She became familiar with his work in the [[U.S. Senate]] for small business development.&lt;ref name="Gale"/&gt; As of January 2008, Alvarez sits on the board of directors for [[Wal-Mart]]. As of 2014, Álvarez sits on the Board of Directors of [[The Cisneros Center for New Americans]].

Álvarez has been featured in many magazines, among them "[[Latina Style magazine|Latina Style]]" and is featured in the book "Hard Won Wisdom" by [[Fawn Gerner]], where she is quoted as saying:

'''Alfred Irénée du Pont''' (May 12, 1864 &amp;ndash; April 28, 1935) was an American [[Business magnate|industrialist]], [[financier]], [[Philanthropy|philanthropist]] and a member of the influential [[Du Pont family]].&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt;&lt;ref name="Prechel2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Harland N. Prechel|title=Big business and the state: historical transitions and corporate transformation, 1880s-1990s|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cHk-SuLP6xkC&amp;pg=PA103|accessdate=18 August 2010|year=2000|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-4593-8|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alfred du Pont first rose to prominence through his work in his family's [[Delaware]]-based gunpowder manufacturing plant, [[DuPont|E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company]] (now known as DuPont), in which for many years he served as a director of the [[Board of directors|board]] and Vice President of operations.

Following an acrimonious departure and a brief dip in personal fortunes, he embarked on business of his own, investing in land and banking in [[Florida]]. He died a [[Multimillionaire#Multimillionaire|multimillionaire]], with the bulk of his fortune sustaining the [[Alfred I. duPont Testamentary Trust]].

== Early years ==
Du Pont was born in the Brandywine Valley region of Delaware to which his great-great-grandfather [[Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours]] had immigrated with his sons after the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name="Silverman2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Silverman|first=Sharon Hernes|title=Brandywine Valley: the informed traveler's guide|date=March 2004|publisher=Stackpole Books|isbn=978-0-8117-2974-1|page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The National cyclopaedia of American biography"&gt;{{cite book|title=The National cyclopaedia of American biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z9kbAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA456|accessdate=18 August 2010|year=1896|publisher=J.T. White|page=456}}&lt;/ref&gt; The son of Éleuthère Irénée du Pont II, a partner in the DuPont family gunpowder business, and Charlotte Shepard Henderson, he had two older sisters and two younger brothers. When du Pont was 13, his mother, who had a history of [[mental illness]], was committed to an [[Psychiatric hospital|asylum]] following an episode of [[hysteria]].&lt;ref name="MacTaggart2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=MacTaggart|first=Ross|title=Millionaires, mansions, and motor yachts: an era of opulence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oSdHXKyds0kC&amp;pg=PA100|accessdate=18 August 2010|date=8 November 2004|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|isbn=978-0-393-05762-1|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a week, she died. The du Pont children were orphaned a month later when Éleuthère followed, a victim of [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref name="MacTaggart2004"/&gt;
 
Du Pont's family intended to separate the children and sell their family home, Swamp Hall, but were persuaded otherwise by the fierce resistance of the children.&lt;ref name="MacTaggart2004"/&gt; The girls remained in the home, but du Pont was sent to [[boarding school]]: first, to the religious Shinn Academy in [[New Jersey]] and then, two years later, [[Phillips Academy]] at [[Andover, Massachusetts]]. After graduation, he enrolled in the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], rooming with his cousin [[T. Coleman du Pont]].

== Family business ==
In 1884, after only  two years at MIT, he left to work at the family's gunpowder manufacturing plant in the Brandywine mills. Though he started in a low position, he eventually became known, according to the Alfred I. du Pont Foundation, as "one of the nation's top powder men."&lt;ref name=brochure&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alfrediduponttrust.org/dupont/highlights.html |title=Biographic Highlights |publisher=Alfred I. du Pont Trust |accessdate=2010-08-18 |page=7 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521022023/http://www.alfrediduponttrust.org/dupont/highlights.html |archivedate=2011-05-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the over 200 [[patent]]s he registered were related to this work.

Du Pont married his cousin Bessie Gardner (1864–1949) in 1887, and she was the mother of his first four children.&lt;ref name="Silverman2004"/&gt; In 1889, the manufacturing plant passed to the management of [[Eugène du Pont]], at which time it was reorganized and renamed [[E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company]], and du Pont was made a limited partner.&lt;ref&gt;MacTaggart (2004), p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DUPONTCO&gt;[http://www2.dupont.com/Heritage/en_US/related_topics/alfred_i_dupont.html DuPont Company website: Heritage-Alfred I. du Pont]&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond that, Eugène du Pont and other family members largely ignored du Pont, excluding him from the company board.&lt;ref name="MacTaggart103"&gt;MacTaggart (2004), p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1902, upon the death of Eugène du Pont, the three senior partners considered selling the company to competitor [[Laflin &amp; Rand Powder Company]].&lt;ref name=DUPONTCO/&gt; Du Pont proposed keeping the company in the family, and the senior partners agreed on condition that du Pont be joined in the venture by T. Coleman du Pont, who would be president, and [[Pierre S. du Pont]].&lt;ref name="MacTaggart103"/&gt; They had no money, but the cousins were able to convince other family members to exchange their company shares for a [[promissory note]] instead of cash, plus shares in the reorganized company.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} According to the Trust organization, the company was purchased "for $15.4 million—$12 million in notes and 33,000 shares of the reorganized DuPont", with the partners retaining $8.6 million worth of shares (86,400).&lt;ref name=brochure/&gt; The actual amount of money which the partners were required to pay was $2,100, at $700 each for lawyers' fees.

Pierre du Pont was named Treasurer and Executive Vice President of the company, while Alfred du Pont served as vice president for operations and took over the black powder manufacture and sat on the Executive Committee. Alfred was directly engaged with the company and instituted major changes to its operation that resulted in greater efficiency and safety, leading to a boom in business.&lt;ref name="MacTaggart103"/&gt;

==Divorce and remarriage==
During this period, du Pont was involved in a hunting accident that would eventually cost him an eye.&lt;ref name="MacTaggart103"/&gt; The same year, 1906, he divorced his first wife, Bessie. The couple's marriage had never been a happy one, and although du Pont supported his family financially, with $24,000 a year in support, he cut off contact with all but his eldest child, Madeleine du Pont. With a week's eviction notice, he removed them from the family home at Swamp Hall and had it destroyed. This, coupled with du Pont's remarriage to a divorced second cousin in 1907, seriously strained relations between du Pont and other members of his family.&lt;ref name="Silverman2004"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MacTaggart (2004), p. 103-105.&lt;/ref&gt;

Du Pont's relationship with his second wife, Mary (Alicia) Heyward Bradford (1875–1920), had already been the subject of family scandal, as family members had remarked on the close relationship of the two even before Alicia Bradford's marriage to du Pont's secretary, George Amory Maddox.&lt;ref name="Winkler2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Winkler|first=John K.|title=The Dupont Dynasty|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UzRtdEMhRsEC&amp;pg=PA178|accessdate=18 August 2010|date=4 May 2005|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|isbn=978-1-4191-2857-8|pages=177–178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maddox and his wife lived close to du Pont and were frequently visited by him; du Pont and Bradford, who had borne a daughter in the meantime, left their spouses at around the same time and were married two weeks after Bradford's divorce was final. Du Pont's adoption of Bradford's daughter, Alicia Maddox, brought fresh gossip to the family, who largely rallied in support of his first wife, which in turn inspired du Pont to file several lawsuits against family members and friends for [[slander]], all of which were dropped in due time.&lt;ref name=Winkler178&gt;Winkler (2005), 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

Du Pont gave Bradford a new home built on {{convert|300|acre|km2}} in Wilmington, Delaware. Construction of the [[Nemours Mansion and Gardens]] occurred between 1909 and 1910.&lt;ref name="Silverman2004"/&gt; The mansion is a five-story, 77-room, {{convert|47000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} structure that was designed by renowned architects, [[Carrère and Hastings]], who also designed the [[New York Public Library Main Branch|New York Public Library]], New York City's [[Frick Collection|Frick Mansion]], and Whitehall, the Henry [[Flagler Museum]] in [[Palm Beach, Florida]]. The building looks like a French [[château]] and the architectural style is [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]]. The estate was named after the French town affiliated with his ancestor, [[Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours]].

Within the short time of the marriage, Bradford bore two children for du Pont, neither of whom survived long.&lt;ref name="MacTaggart105"&gt;MacTaggart (2004), p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuit and departure from E.I. du Pont de Nemours==
Through the early 1910s, Alfred du Pont was engaged in fierce debate over the future of the family's business with Coleman and Pierre du Pont, whose support for du Pont's first wife had extended to building her and her children a home after their eviction from Swamp Hall.&lt;ref name="MacTaggart105"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ChandlerSalsbury2000"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chandler|first1=Alfred Dupont|author2=Stephen Salsbury|title=Pierre S. Du Pont and the Making of the Modern Corporation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6MA6f-rL-fEC&amp;pg=PA306|accessdate=18 August 2010|year=2000|publisher=Beard Books|isbn=978-1-58798-023-7|pages=305–308}}&lt;/ref&gt; The struggle became bitter after Coleman du Pont decided to leave the company for health concerns in 1914.&lt;ref name="MacTaggart105"/&gt;

As he was departing, ill and in need of money for another business transaction, Coleman du Pont decided to sell 20,000 shares in the company to key company employees, but when Alfred du Pont and Pierre du Pont disagreed on the proper pricing and handling of the transaction, wound up selling considerably more shares (over 77,000 shares combined of common and preferred stock) to Pierre du Pont and five associates, who had formed the DuPont Securities Company.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler and Salsbury (2000), pp. 328-329; 331-333.&lt;/ref&gt; This secret and swift transaction gave Pierre du Pont, 60 percent ownership of DuPont Securities, considerable control over the family business.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler and Salisbury (2000), p. 335.&lt;/ref&gt; While the value of the shares greatly increased due to the success of the company during [[World War I]], Alfred du Pont and other minority shareholders launched a lawsuit against Pierre du Pont, alleging that he had acted as an agent of the E.I. du Pont de Nemours company, who should be rightful holders of the shares.&lt;ref name="NYTwins"&gt;{{cite news |title= DU PONT CO. WINS IN $60,000,000 SUIT; Judge Thompson Files Decree in U.S. Court Dismissing Bill of Complaint. UPHOLDS STOCKHOLDERS Counsel for Defendants Says Contest Is Ended in Lower Court, but Predicts Appeal. Business Is Reorganized. |newspaper= [[The New York Times]]|date= 21 March 1918 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B04E3D6113FE433A25752C2A9659C946996D6CF |accessdate=18 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The suit was extremely well publicized and acrimonious. In 1916, shortly after company shareholders voted to remove Alfred du Pont from its board of directors, the [[United States District Court]] found that Pierre du Pont had operated in bad faith, ordering a stockholder vote to determine if the stockholders (aside from those who owned the disputed shares) wished to purchase the disputed shares.&lt;ref name="NYTwins"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chandler and Salisbury (2000), p. 345.&lt;/ref&gt; By a share ratio of 33:13, shareholders did not, and, accordingly, in 1918, the court dismissed the action.&lt;ref name="NYTwins"/&gt; Alfred du Pont brought an appeal which ended unsuccessfully in March 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler and Salisbury (2000), p. 357.&lt;/ref&gt;

No longer involved in running E.I. du Pont de Nemours, du Pont instead began to invest in newspapers, as a publisher of which he successfully opposed T. Coleman du Pont's bid for presidency and [[Henry A. du Pont]]'s third run for [[United States Senate|Senate]].&lt;ref name="MacTaggart105"/&gt; According to the du Pont Trust, he also "established an investment firm Nemours Trading Corporation, and an import-export business in New York" and acquired a majority interest in the [[Delaware Trust Company]].&lt;ref name=brochure/&gt;

== Widowed and third marriage ==
A bad business transaction had left him nearly [[bankruptcy|bankrupt]] when, in January 1920, his second wife died.&lt;ref name="MacTaggart105"/&gt; Missing an eye since his earlier accident, he was now also nearly [[deaf]].&lt;ref name=HAI&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.wlu.edu/specialcollections/jessiebd.pdf |title=Jessie Ball du Pont papers |author=History Associates Incorporated |accessdate=2009-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120906001628/http://library.wlu.edu/specialcollections/jessiebd.pdf |archivedate=2012-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But his life was about to change with his third marriage.

Du Pont had been corresponding with [[Jessie Ball du Pont|Jessie Ball]], 20 years his junior, since the time of their meeting in 1898 when she was 14.&lt;ref name="HAI"/&gt; By 1920, Ball was an assistant principal at an elementary school in [[San Diego, California]], and du Pont began courting her, at the same time divesting himself of assets and cutting back on spending.&lt;ref name="MacTaggart105"/&gt; He wed Ball on January 22, 1921, and the couple returned to the East coast to settle into Nemours.&lt;ref name=HAI/&gt;  The couple had no children of their own, but Ball du Pont accepted young Denise, a child du Pont had fostered with his second wife, as her own.&lt;ref name="Colby1984"&gt;{{cite book|last=Colby|first=Gerard|authorlink=Gerard Colby|title=Du Pont dynasty|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jUq1AAAAIAAJ|accessdate=18 August 2010|date=September 1984|publisher=L.

Ball du Pont proved to be a great assistance to him as well in his work,&lt;ref name=HAI/&gt; as did her younger brother. [[Edward Ball (businessman)|Edward Ball]] and du Pont hit it off and Edward Ball began working for his brother-in-law in 1923, moving to Delaware where he was publicly named manager of the Clean Food Products Company. Privately, he was du Pont's confidential business partner and became a shrewd financier and caretaker of the du Pont de Nemours estate fortune.&lt;ref name=FSU&gt;[http://www.fsu.edu/~fsuml/spring2000.html Florida State University: Coastal Laboratory Tidings-Spring, 2000] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080823222235/http://www.fsu.edu/~fsuml/spring2000.html |date=August 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relocation and later life==
[[File:Formal garden, Epping Forest, home of Mrs. Alfred I. du Pont, Jacksonville, Florida.jpg|thumbnail|left|du Pont home "Epping Forest" in Jacksonville, ca. 1930-1945]]
Du Pont and his third wife had already made several trips to Florida on their motor yacht, ''Nenemoosha'', when Pierre du Pont was named Tax Commissioner of Delaware in 1925. Harboring hard feelings against his cousin, Alfred du Pont and Jessie Ball du Pont moved to [[Jacksonville, Florida]] in 1926, where they established permanent residency.&lt;ref name=brochure/&gt; There, du Pont purchased {{convert|58|acre|m2}} of land on the [[St. Johns River]] and built a 25-room mansion and landscaped grounds, as well as a berth for the couple's motor yacht. Ball du Pont named the estate [[Epping Forest (Jacksonville, Florida)|Epping Forest]], after the Virginia plantation of [[Mary Ball Washington]], [[George Washington]]'s mother and Ball du Pont's relative.&lt;ref name=brochure/&gt; Edward Ball, too, relocated to Florida, to continue working with du Pont.

In Florida, du Pont made primarily small real estate investments at first, correctly fearing a drop in real estate values, before turning his attention to acquiring interest in banks. He acquired an interest in [[Florida National Bank]] (FNB) of Jacksonville, keeping it solvent during a [[bank run]] of 1929 by putting $15 million of his own money into an account.&lt;ref name="MacTaggart105"/&gt;&lt;ref name=GREAT /&gt; During the early 1930s, six other Florida National Banks were opened throughout Florida, including Lakeland and Bartow.

During this time, du Pont was expanding his philanthropic activities. He personally funded a pension plan program for seniors in Delaware in 1929 and turned his attention to revitalizing Florida after the devastation of a [[1926 Miami hurricane|1926 hurricane]] and the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref name="MacTaggart105"/&gt;

==Other activities==
Besides his interest in business, du Pont was an accomplished and passionate violinist and composer. Using friends and his factory workers from E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, he formed an orchestra that was named the ''Tankopanicum Musical Club''. According to the du Pont Trust, du Pont "published nine pieces of music [during his lifetime], eight marches and one ''gavotte'', a French peasant dance, which was performed at the [[Grand Opera House (Wilmington, Delaware)|Grand Opera House]] in Wilmington in 1907."&lt;ref name=brochure/&gt; [[John Philip Sousa]], who was a friend, performed one of his marches.&lt;ref name=brochure/&gt;

==Death and legacy==
When du Pont died in 1935 in [[Jacksonville, Florida]] at age 70,&lt;ref name=nytobit&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Alfred I. du Pont Dies in Florida. End Comes Suddenly to the Founder and Former Head of Explosives Company. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1935/04/29/archives/lfred-i-dij-pont-dies-in-florida-end-comes-suddenly-to-the-founder.html |quote= |work=The New York Times |date=April 29, 1935 |accessdate=2007-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; his estate was valued at over $56 million, which, after estate taxes of $30 million, left $26 million.

The vast majority of his fortune was left in [[testamentary trust]] with Jessie named as the principal trustee with complete discretion regarding use of any money, but in reality, she deferred business decisions to her brother, who took control of the assets, which included the large Florida landholdings of the [[St. Joe Company]] and industrial interests, including the [[Florida East Coast Railway]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uflib.ufl.edu/spec/pkyonge/Ball.htm University of Florida Smathers Libraries: Special and Area Studies Collections-Edward Ball Papers]&lt;/ref&gt; Jessie preferred to handle the philanthropic activities of the trust while Edward concentrated on making money. The fortune did not become a charitable trust until Jessie's death in 1970, which explains why $30 million in estate taxes were paid in 1935. The [[Alfred I. duPont Testamentary Trust]]'s sole charitable beneficiary is the [[Nemours Foundation]], which runs children's medical facilities in Delaware and Florida.

The trust was valued at $72.5 million in 1939; $2 billion in 1981; $4.5 billion in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alfrediduponttrust.org/history/financial.asp Alfred du Pont Trust: Financial History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060518120004/http://www.alfrediduponttrust.org/history/financial.asp |date=2006-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike most of his family members, du Pont was not buried at the family's [[Du Pont de Nemours Cemetery]]. He is interred, along with his wife and brother-in law, in a large mausoleum on the grounds of the [[Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children]], one of the first projects created with his trust.

Both Nemours and Epping Forest have been restored to their original splendor. A public school in Jacksonville, the Alfred I. duPont Middle School, is located not far from his Epping Forest estate.

Alfred du Pont was designated a [[Great Floridians|Great Floridian]] by the Florida Department of State in the ''Great Floridians 2000 Program''. A plaque attesting to the honor is located at the entry gate to the Epping Forest estate in Jacksonville.&lt;ref name=GREAT&gt;[http://www.flheritage.com/services/sites/floridians/?section=j#Jacksonville(Northeast) Florida Department of State: Great Floridians 2000 Program-Jacksonville] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031001517/http://www.flheritage.com/services/sites/floridians/?section=j |date=2010-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alwin Charles Ernst''' ([[Certified Public Accountant|CPA]]) (July 26, 1881 - May 13, 1948) was an American businessman who co-founded the [[Accountant|accounting]] firm of  [[Ernst &amp; Young|Ernst &amp; Ernst]] in 1903 and who is credited with inventing [[management consulting]].

==Biography==
Ernst was born on July 26, 1881 in [[Cleveland, Ohio]]. After finishing [[high school]], Ernst took evening courses at a [[business college]]. In 1900, he went to work for The Audit Co. in Cleveland.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/guardian_jobs_and_money/story/0,3605,819260,00.html Ernst &amp; Young] Guardian, 26 October 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Ernst died at age sixty-six on May 13, 1948 at the Lakeside Hospital in Cleveland.

In 1903, Ernst and his older brother Theodore founded the Ernst &amp; Ernst [[bookkeeping]] service with an invested capital of $500. In October 1906, Theodore left the business.

Ernst expanded his business credentials by obtaining his Ohio Certified Public Accountant (CPA) certificate in 1910. Aggressive and ambitious, Ernst had already opened offices in [[Chicago]] by 1908 and in [[New York City]] by 1909.

By the time of his death on May 13, 1948, Ernst had grown the business to more than fifty offices in the United States and [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-604197/Commentary-The-pity-of-it.html Commentary: The pity of it all] Accounting Today, September 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Ernst was buried at [[Knollwood Cemetery]] in [[Mayfield Heights, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Alwin C. Ernst|work=The Plain Dealer|date=May 15, 1948|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Ernst's death, his estate went to his four daughters and in August 1948 they sold most of his racing stable through an auction at [[Saratoga Race Course]]. A part of the dispersal, Algasir was purchased by [[F. Ambrose Clark]] for [[United States dollar|US$]]106,000.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/416784161.html?dids=416784161:416784161&amp;FMT=CITE&amp;FMTS=CITE:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Aug+22%2C+1948&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=Gelding+Brings+%24106%2C000+at+Saratoga+Sale&amp;pqatl=google Gelding Brings $106,000 at Saratoga Sale] Los Angeles Times, 22 August 1948&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thoroughbred racing==
Ernst owned and bred [[Thoroughbred]] racehorses, primarily those that ran in [[Sprint (horse racing)|sprint]] races. Among his best horses was multiple stakes winner Alorter whose wins included the 1943 [[Cowdin Stakes]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1943/09/16/archives/alorter-scores-upset-victory-in-cowdin-stakes-3590-for-2-shot.html Alorter Scores Upset Victory in Cowdin Stakes; $35.90 FOR $2 SHOT TRIUMPHS BY A HEAD] New York Times, 16 September 1943&lt;/ref&gt; Ernst also bred Algasir but died before he could see the horse win the 1948 [[Cowdin Stakes|Cowdin]] and [[Flash Stakes]] and set a [[world record]] for four [[furlong]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1949/04/04/archives/sports-of-the-times-looking-over-the-field.html Sports of the Times; Looking Over the Field] New York Times, 4 April 1949&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout most of his time in racing, Ernst's horses were trained by [[John H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="53192">'''Anti Monopoly Law of China''' refers to the Anti-Monopoly Law of the People’s Republic of China, passed by the National People’s Congress on 30 August 2007, and implemented as of 1 August 2008. 

== Definition ==

The Anti-Monopoly Law (AML) of China in a narrow sense refers only to the Anti-Monopoly Law of the People’s Republic of China, passed by the National People’s Congress on 30 August 2007, and implemented as of 1 August 2008. In a broad sense it refers to the anti-monopoly legal system of China, including not only the AML, the post-AML ancillary legislative, and legal documents for the purpose of enforcing the AML, but also all pre-AML legislative and administrative documents with an anti-monopoly nature, as well as regulatory or administrative enforcement, private enforcement and judicial procedures.  The definition used here refers to its broad meaning.

== History of the Legislation ==

It is commonly recognized that the legislation of the anti-monopoly law in China was initiated in August 1987 when an AML drafting team was set up by the former Legal Affairs Bureau of the State Council to formally proceed to draft the AML.  Prior to this, however, and following the economic reforms and opening in China, the State Council had already promulgated The Provisional Rules on Expediting Economic Alliance&lt;ref&gt;Became invalid as of 23 March 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; as early as 1 July 1980, aiming to “break down... territorial blockades and departmental barriers.” This was followed by The State Council Provisional Rules on the Launching and Protecting the Socialist Competition&lt;ref&gt;Became invalid as of 6 October 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; on 17 October 1980, aiming to “step by step reform the existing economic management system and actively promote and protect... smooth competition;" a third document, the State Council Rules on Further Expediting and Protecting Socialist Competition,&lt;ref&gt;Replaced The Provisional Rules on Expediting Economic Alliance of 1980 and became invalid as of 6 October 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; was released on 23 March 1986. These three documents served as the earliest form of anti-monopoly law and were intended to break down the historical planning of economic monopolies in the pre-1980’s era and to promote the initial and basic market economy and competition.

Since August 1987 onward, the significant milestones of anti-monopoly law legislation in China are as follows:

'''* 1988: the drafting team produced the Anti-Monopoly and Anti Unfair Competition Provisional Regulations (Proposal Draft).'''

* 2 September 1993: the Anti Unfair Competition Law was promulgated by the 8th Session of the NPC Standing Committee, implemented as of 1 December 1993.
* 1994: the AML was listed in the legislation plan by the 8th Session of the NPC Standing Committee, and the former National Economic and Trade Commission and the State Administration for Industry and Commerce were delegated to be jointly responsible to draft the AML; in May, the AML Draft Steering Team and AML Draft Working Team were set up
* July 1997: the 1st Version of the AML Outline Draft was produced.
* 1998: the AML was listed in the legislation plan by the 9th Session of the NPC Standing Committee; in November, the 2nd Version of the AML Outline Draft was produced
* June 2000: the 1st Draft of the AML (Soliciting Opinion Version) was produced
* December 2003: the AML was listed in the legislation plan by the 10th Session of the NPC Standing Committee as one of the fundamental economic legislations
* 2004: the AML was listed in the legislation plan by the State Council; on 26 February, the Ministry of Commerce submitted the AML (For Review Version) to the State Council
* February 2005: the AML was listed in the legislation plan by the NPC Standing Committee; in the same year, the State Council set up AML Review and Modify Steering Team, AML Modify Working Team, and AML Review and Modify Expert Team to review and modify the AML (Draft)
* 7 June 2006: the AML (Draft) was reviewed, discussed, and passed in principle by the State Council Executive Meeting that also decided to submit it to the NPC Standing Committee for review upon further revision; from 24 to 29 June, the 10th NPC Standing Committee conducted the first read of the AML (Draft)
* from 24 to 29 June 2007: the 10th NPC Standing Committee conducted the second read of the AML (Draft) and third read from 24 to 30 August

'''* 30 August 2007: the 10th NPC Standing Committee passed and promulgated the AML'''

'''* 1 August 2008: the AML was put into enforcement'''

* Post-AML Legislative Practice and Development'''
* Landmark Judicial Judgements and Rulings'''

'''* ''Huawei vs. IDC cases'''''

'''* ''Ruibang vs. Johnson &amp; Johnson case'''''

'''* ''Tencent vs. Qihu 360 case'''''

== The Four Cornerstones of the Anti-Monopoly Law of China ==

== The doctrines of “''illegal per se rule''” and “''rule of reason''” in the anti-monopoly law of China ==

The doctrines of “''illegal per se rule''” (“''per se rule''”) and the “''rule of reason''” are two landmark and the most important legal theories in the history and development of the anti-trust law not only in its country of origin but also in many other countries and jurisdictions all over the world.  The doctrines make a clear and straight definition in legal theory and can be efficiently and effectively implemented in practical enforcement.  The fact that the doctrines in the United States have directly, effectively and successfully regulated the market situation and competitive practices, protected and promoted the market competition, and the anti-trust legal theory and practice have been consistently evolving and developing to cope with the market, economic and competition development, makes the doctrines significantly influential in the competition law legislation and enforcement in other countries and jurisdictions.

Literally, the doctrines of “per se rule” and the “rule of reason” can be found in the AML context as well as in the Supreme Court Judicial Opinion on one hand, but it is found otherwise in several court judgement on the other hand.

=== Legislation ===

During the processes of the AML legislation, the AML drafting team had not only studied and referenced to the greatest extent the statues of the EU competition law legislation as a result the basic structure and contents of the AML are as close and similar as the EU competition law,&lt;ref&gt;For instance, AML Articles 13, 14 and 15 vs. Articles 81(1), 82 and 81(3) of the EU Treaty.&lt;/ref&gt; but had also studied the US antitrust legal theory and cases and consulted the US antitrust law experts.  As such, the spirit of the doctrines of “''per se rule''” and the “''rule of reason''” indeed exists or influences the creation of the AML.

In the legislation, as far as the literal provisions of the AML is concerned, it is found that '''Articles 13 (horizontal agreement), 14 (vertical Agreement) and 17(1) (abuse of dominant market position)''' as one category using the literal word "prohibit" without any pre condition, while there is a condition of "reasonable cause" for the "prohibition" in '''Articles 17(2) to (6) (abuse of dominant market position without justifiable cause)''' as another category, as a result making literal difference that there should be different legislative purposes and intents as well as different legal meanings in the AML between the above two categories: with regard to the unconditional prohibition in the first category on one hand, any agreement or conduct breaching unconditional prohibition will then constitute a violation of law without regard to the result or effect caused by the violation, as such these unconditional prohibitions can be treated or argued to have the nature or character of "''illegal per se''" and accordingly it is an alternative expression of "''illegal per se rule''" in the AML; while with regard to Articles 17(2) to (6), on the other hand, the literal words "reasonable cause", given its obvious literal meaning, will then be an alternative expression of the "''rule of reason''".

=== Supreme Court Judicial Opinion ===

In the judicial opinion, however, unlike the EU Court of First Instance in Case T-112/99 M6 and Others v Commission&lt;ref&gt;Section 72, Case T-112/99 [2001] Métropole télévision (M6), Suez-Lyonnaise des eaux, France Télécom and Télévision française 1 SA (TF1) v Commission of the European Communities&lt;/ref&gt; has expressly denied the existence of "''rule of reason''" in the EU competition law, China Supreme Court by far has yet clearly clarified and it has been hesitating in its Judicial Opinions on Several Issues Concerning the Application of Law in Proceeding Civil Cases Caused by Monopolistic Conducts (Fa Shi [2012] No. 5)&lt;ref&gt;Passed by the China Supreme Court on 30 January 2012, published on 3 May 2012 and implemented as of 1 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; (hereinafter the “SCJO”) if the "''illegal per se rule''" and the "''rule of reason''" exists in the anti-monopoly legal system of China or can be invoked in the practical enforcement cases or not, in other words, it still remains unclear if '''Articles 13, 14 and 17(1)''' as one category would have the nature of "''illegal per se''" and only '''Articles 17(2) to (6)''' as another category subject to the "''rule of reason''", or if there is any different legislative purpose and intent and different legal meaning or not between the two categories.  As a result, also unlike the EU Court of First Instance in the same Case T-112/99 that has clearly stated that the pro- or anti-competition aspects should be examined within the scope of Article 85(3) of the EU Treaty, otherwise “Article 85(3) of the Treaty would lose much of its effectiveness if such an examination had to be carried out already under Article 85(1) of the Treaty”,&lt;ref&gt;Section 74, Case T-112/99 [2001].&lt;/ref&gt; China Supreme Court has further left unclear if the "reasonable cause" provided in Articles 17(2) to (6) is limited to the pre-set scope in Article 15 or all relevant pro- or anti-competition aspects of undertaking and the relevant market can be taken into account and examined according to the doctrine of "''rule of reason''".

In the Supreme Court Judicial Oipnions on Several Issues Concerning the Application of Law in Proceeding Anti-Monopoly Civil Dispute Cases (Soliciting Comment Version) Circulated by the China Supreme Court on 25 April 2011 (hereinafter the “SCJO SCV”), unlike in the literal provisions of the AML, it seems to draw no distinction as between '''Articles 13, 14 and 17(1)''' as one category '''Articles 17(2) to (6)''' as another category as initially drafted as in Article 8&lt;ref&gt;It was renumbered as Article 7 in the finally promulgated and implemented SCJO.&lt;/ref&gt; of the SCJO : “The victims of the monopoly agreements shall have burden of proof against the alleged monopoly agreements for the effects of the exclusion or restriction of competition.  The victims shall not have burden of proof against such monopoly agreements for the effects of the exclusion or restriction of competition if the monopoly agreements fall within the scope of ''Articles 13(1) to (5)'' or ''Articles 14(1) and (2)'', except for if the alleged undertakings to the said monopoly agreements are able to prove otherwise by the contrary evidence.” which could be read as that both Articles 13(1) to (5) or Articles 14(1) and (2) are subject to effect examination (''rule of reason'').

In the official SCJO, however, Article 7 of the SCJO merely provides that “the defendant shall have burden of proof for no effect of exclusion and restriction of competition for acts falling within the monopoly agreements under Articles 13(1) to (5)”, which draws an obvious distinction between the formally equal Article 13, per se illegal unless defendant proves otherwise, and Article 14, subject to plaintiff’s burden of proof on effect (or rule of reason) examination.&lt;ref&gt;See Paragraph (1) in Section 6.3 Tencent vs. Qihu 360 case below.&lt;/ref&gt; Article 8&lt;ref&gt;It was renumbered as Article 7 in the finally promulgated and implemented SCJO.&lt;/ref&gt; of the SCJO also seems to have drawn an unclear distinguish on burden of proof between Article 17(1) from Articles 17(2) to (6) by saying “plaintiff shall [only] have burden of proof for the dominant position, and the abuse of such dominant position by the defendant in the relevant market”, alleged defendant monopoly conduct will be justified unless plaintiff proves illegal by effect examination (or rule of reason); this Article 8 seems to make AML Article 17(1) equal to Articles 17(2) to (6)  that both are subject to the effect examination.

=== Judicial Judgements ===

This topic, especially as to if there is any difference between Articles 13 and 14, remained unclear until the Ruibang vs. J&amp;J case that Shanghai High Court made a very judgement on 1 August 2013 in which including an analysis on the interrelations between AML Articles 13 and 14.&lt;ref&gt;See more details in Section 7(ii) below.&lt;/ref&gt;  Shanghai High Court examined and concluded that “the effects of exclusion and restriction of competition are the constitutive and necessary factors in the examination of monopoly agreement with clause of restricting the minimum resale price as referred to in Article 14 of the AML”.&lt;ref&gt;Pages 38 and 39 of the Ruling.&lt;/ref&gt;  From this ruling and the position that Shanghai High Court allowed both plaintiff and defendant to submit and cross examine the reports prepared by the economic experts on the relevant markets, J&amp;J’s products and its market share, the effects of pro- and anti-competition of the alleged vertical agreement in question with restriction on the minimum resale price, etc., it appears that Shanghai High Court is rather in favour of agreeing to conduct a comprehensive examination of all related aspects in particular of the pro- and anti-competition effects of "Article 14 agreements" in accordance with the doctrine of the “rule of reason”.

=== Administrative Enforcement ===

Nonetheless the above, however, in the administrative enforcement, it appears that the NDRC is rather apt to apply the doctrine of “illegal per se rule” directly to the first category (i.e., AML Articles 13, 14 and 17(1)) because of the low difficulty and costs and easy proceeding to apply the “per se rule” in the administrative enforcement of the AML.  This is evidenced by the most recent four major cases that NDRC announced during January to August 2013 &lt;ref&gt;The four major cases include (1) LED panel price fixing agreement case amongst Samsung, LG, Chimei, AU Optronic、Chunghwa Picture Tubes and Hannstar; (2) price monopoly case by Wuliangye and Maotai; (3) price monopoly case by Shanghai Gold Accessories Industry Association and several Gold Accessory Shops; and (4) “agreements to restricting minimum resale price agreements” case by milk powder suppliers including Biostime, Mead Johnson, Danone Dumex, Abbott, Friso and Fonterra; in which LED price fixing agreements existed prior to the AML implementation and the NDRC’s ruling was then based on the Price Law instead of AML.  However, as it was defined at the beginning, Price Law is also an important component of the anti-monopoly law of China in broad sense.&lt;/ref&gt; because neither examination nor analysis on the “reason” or “reasonable cause” had ever been made to the effects of restriction or exclusion of competition by the alleged monopolistic conducts.  Albeit this has been questioned,&lt;ref&gt;While there had no questionable comment made towards the application of “per se rule” in the LED and Gold Accessories cases because both of which were horizontal agreements, some questions and comments had been made towards the milk powder and Wuliangye/Maotai vertical agreement cases that whether or not the “reason” or the “reasonable cause” must have been examined, on a case by case basis, for the effects of exclusion or restriction of competition before the decision was made.&lt;/ref&gt; NDRC appears to follow and carry on the strategy and tactics that were adopted in the US in the early stage of the enforcement of Sherman Act at the turn of 19th and 20th centuries to put a direct “''illegal per se''” effect to the AML Articles 13 and 14.  This makes very important sense because it is drawing a boundary line as between the “''illegal per se''” conducts and agreement and those conducts and agreement with “reasonable cause”.

In a summary, until the Supreme Court clearly interprets this important issue by further judicial opinions or rulings, whether or not the unconditional prohibition in Articles 13 and 14 would equally have similar nature of "illegal per se" and how to distinguish Articles 13 and 14 them from the "reasonable cause" in Articles 17(2) to (6), still remain an open topic in the anti-monopoly legal system in China.

== Legal Applicable Exemptions ==

The AML adopts in Article 15&lt;ref&gt;In addition to Article 15, AML Articles 55 and 56 also provide extra exceptions where the AML will not apply.&lt;/ref&gt; the same doctrine of “legal applicable exceptions” as in Article 81(3) of the EU Treaty.  Unlike the EU competition law that the EU Commission has promulgated and implemented various specific regulations for the purpose of implementing and enforcing Article 81(3), however, several fundamental issues such as the specific contents and criteria of the “legal exceptions”, who has the authority or being authorized to stipulate the implementing rules, by the NPC Standing Committee, the State Council, or the NDRC or SAIC, still remain unclear in the anti-monopoly legal system.  In private enforcement, the contents and criteria of the proof of evidences for “reasonable cause” and whether the assessment and comparison between pro-competition vs. anti-competition are limited within the preset scope of AML Article 15 only or can include all reasonable  causes in all relevant aspects or elements beyond AML Article 15, also remain unclear.

== Some Landmark Cases and Judicial Judgements ==

There is no precedent case law in China.  The judgements, especially those methodological or judicial examinations in the judicial rulings or opinions made by the high court or the Supreme Court in the landmark cases, are commonly studied by law practitioners, academic researchers and sometimes indirectly as a principle or guideline invoked by other courts in the subsequent cases.

=== 'Huawi v. IDC cases' ===

In 2011, Huawei brought two separate litigations against the same group of defendants of Inter Digital Corporation, Inc. and its affiliated companies (IDC).  The first case was brought to Shenzhen Intermediate Court for the judicial ruling on the royalty rate by Huawei to IDC for certain patent licenses ([2011] Shen Zhong Fa Zhi Min Chu Zi No. 857, Case 857) and the second on was also brought to Shenzhen Intermediate Court for damages caused by IDC’s abuse of dominant market position ([2011] Shen Zhong Fa Zhi Min Chu Zi No. 858, Case 858).  Both cases were appealed to the Guangdong Provincial High Court.Guangdong Provincial High Court made the final judgement on the first Huawei v. IDC case (Case No. 857) On 16 October 2013 ([2013] Yue Gao Fa Min San Zhong Zi No 305, Judgement 305) and on the second one (Case 858) on 21 October 2013 ([2013] Yue Gao Fa Min San Zhong Zi No 306, Judgement 306).  Upon the petition of both Huawei and IDC, both cases were not publicly heard due to the large amount of sensitive commercial and technical information and dada.

The two judgements made by Guangdong High Court are published in which all sensitive information and data are redacted. Both cases and the two judgements, usually treated as one combined case by Huawei against IDC, have been appraised by the China Courts as one of the best 10 AML cases by then, while commented by the public as very controversial.  The following can be considered:

(1)	In Judgement 305 (Case 857): there is an extremely lack of (1) judicial analysis to justify and support the ruling on choices of Chinese law and the forum jurisdiction of the China court in a royalty rate case arising from, or at least substantially depending on the interpretation of, royalty policy and rules of the European Telecommunications Standards Institute ETSI, which is organized and governed by French law; (2) legal grounds under the current Chinese law on the [discretionary] right of the court in determining a non-tort (or infringement), non-breach of contract, but a pure commercial term as well as its other judicial rulings.

(2)	On 14 April 2014, IDC filed a petition to the China Supreme Court for retrial and seeking a dismissal of this judgement or at least a higher, market-based royalty rate.  It is currently pending with China Supreme Court.

(3)	In Judgement 306 (Case 858), this is rather an “abuse of intellectual property right” case under AML Article 55 than an “abuse of dominant market position” case under AML Article 17, Guangdong High Court finally upheld the initial judgement to judge IDC to compensate Huawei RMB20 millions. this final Ruling covered two AML aspects both of which are not only jurisprudence important but also leading edge.  The first aspect is the “extraterritoriality” under AML Article 2, while the second aspect is that the Ruling appears to make use of the “abuse of dominant market position” under AML Article 17 for the “abuse of intellectual property right” case under AML Article 55.&lt;ref&gt;It appears that both plaintiff and the Court recognized the lawful proprietary, exclusive or monopolistic nature of the intellectual property right according to the relevant laws, as such the difficulty, especially the burden of proof, in the “abuse of intellectual property right” litigation is significantly higher than the “abuse of dominant market position” litigation, the latter of which can be established as a good arguable case on the basis of the adequate information and data of the relevant market.&lt;/ref&gt;  (1) AML Article 2 is itself too general and vague which merely empowers the right and offers possibility to apply “extraterritorial jurisdiction”.  As to how to apply such “extraterritorial jurisdiction”, the detailed rules, conditions and criteria in the application, neither AML nor the Supreme Court has yet made any clear implementing regulations, interpretation or guideline, but would rather merely rely on the discretionary power of the competent court.  Taking these into account in conjunction with the complicated factors of either or both private and public international laws that may be associated with the application of “extraterritorial jurisdiction” as well as that many other courts may possibly follow after this Ruling to apply the “extraterritorial jurisdiction” in other cases, it appears to be desirable and urgent for the Supreme Court to make judicial ruling as to how to appropriately and delicately apply the “extraterritorial jurisdiction”.  (2) Because this Ruling may be a modeling precedent of making use of the “abuse of dominant market position” under AML Article 17 for the “abuse of intellectual property right” case under AML Article 55 or even it is merely an “abuse of dominant market position” case involving intellectual property right elements, how to treat and balance the prohibition of “abuse of intellectual property right” verse the lawful proprietary, exclusive or monopolistic right of the intellectual property right as well as verse the legal exception of application of the AML provided in the same AML Article 55, and how to treat the anti-monopoly provisions provided by the AML verse the lawful proprietary, exclusive or monopolistic right of the intellectual property right provided by intellectual property laws such as Patent Law, all of such complicated and delicate issues remain unclear and uncertain pending the Supreme Court judicial opinion, in order to not only protect competition and prohibit monopoly but also to protect the intellectual property right as well as its lawful proprietary, exclusive or monopolistic right.

NDRC, upon Huawei’s petition (or informant), launched the formal AML investigation against IDC in June 2013.  With the high pressure from the NDRC, IDC eventually reached a private settlement with NDRC by making certain commitments leading to NDRC withdrawing the investigation in May 2014.  It is widely believed that both courts (of Shenzhen Municipality and Guangdong Province) and NDRC played both judicial and administrative sticks against IDC to support Huawei’s launching and development in the US market.

=== 'Ruibang v. Johnson &amp; Johnson cases' &lt;ref&gt;See more details in Section 4 above for analysis on the application of “rule of reason” in this case.&lt;/ref&gt;===

This is the first judicial case and judgement of vertical monopoly agreement under AML Article 14.2, as well as the first case that the High Court (of appeal) overruled the judgement in favour of the defendant made by the Intermediate Court (of first instance).

The fact of the case is simple and straightforward: Ruibang Yonghe Technology Co., Ltd. ("Ruibang"), the plaintiff in this case, is an authorized distributor of Johnson &amp; Johnson (Shanghai) Medical Equipment Co., Ltd. and Johnson &amp; Johnson (China) Medical Equipment Co., Ltd. ("J&amp;J"), the defendants in the case, in the authorized territory under a distribution agreement.  Ruibang sued J&amp;J to the Shanghai Pudong New District Court for J&amp;J's partially withdraw of Ruibang's distributorship, taking off Ruibang's distributor deposit and eventually refusing to supply by reason of Ruibang's breach of lowest re-sell price in the unauthorized territory.  Both courts (of first instance and appeal) made similar judicial analysis in term of AML Article 14.2, Shanghai New District Court made a judgement on 18 May 2012 (Judgement (2010) Hu Yi Zhong Min Wu (Zhi) Chi Zi No 169) in favour of J&amp;J on the ground of plaintiff's insufficient evidence.  Ruibang appealed to the Shanghai High Court and submitted a very comprehensive expert affidavit made by a professor of China Foreign Economic and Trade University, as a defending fight back J&amp;J also submitted the a comprehensive expert affidavit made by a professor of Shanghai Finance and Economic University.  The Shanghai High Court conclusively made a judgement on 1 August 2013 (Judgement (2012) Hu Gao Min San (Zhi) Zhong Zi No 63) that overruled the judgement made by the Shanghai Pudong New District Court ruling that J&amp;J had violated AML Article 14.2 and be liable for the judged damages.

This case and its final judgement offer some observation:

(1)	Under the AML, the vertical agreement is subject to “rule of reason”, namely, it is not “per se illegal” but very likely “per se challengeable” and “effect” test is necessary to assess if a vertical agreement breaches the AML, or not.&lt;ref&gt;Page 38 of the Judgement.&lt;/ref&gt;

(2)	Four elements in the “effect” test: (1) sufficient competition, (2) market position, (3) motivation, and (4) effects of competition restriction and competition promotion.&lt;ref&gt;Pages 40-61 of the Judgement.&lt;/ref&gt;

(3)	The application of the doctrine of maxim semper necessitas probandi incumbit ei qui agit in the AML private enforcement case.&lt;ref&gt;Pages 39-40 of the Judgement.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 'Tencent vs. Qihu 360 case' ===

This is a case of the “abuse of dominant market position”, the first AML private enforcement case that was initially brought to and examined by the provincial High Court, then appealed to and finally judged by the Supreme Court, and by far, the Supreme Court’s written judgement is the best and most professional, both judicially and technically, judicial judgement of its kind ever amongst all AML cases in China.  Given the judicial power and nature of the Supreme Court, this judgement established and reaffirmed several very important judicial rules with precedent case law effect insofar as the private enforcement of AML is concerned.

These important judicial rules include:

(1)	reaafirms the doctrine of semper necessitas probandi incumbit ei qui agit (he who alleges must prove) with regard to the allocation of onus probandi (burden of proof) in the AML judicial case

(2)	defining relevant market is not a purpose but instead rather a methodology in assessing the relevant undertaking’s market power and the influence power of the alleged monopoly conduct on to the competition, as such it is not compulsory to specifically and exactly define the relevant market in every AML litigation of abuse of dominant market position

(3)	an HMT (hypothetical monopoly test) based on tools of SSNIP (small but significant and non-transitory increase in price) or SSNDQ (small but significant and non-transitory decrease in quality) may be conducted in defining the relevant market but should be conducted carefully with cautious

(4)	the related market situation and technology development trend post the litigation may be taken into consideration in defining the relevant market

(5)	market share is not the only one element in concluding dominant market position

(6)	multi elements should be comprehensively evaluated in defining the dominant market position, including but not limited to: (1) the market share of the undertaking in question and the competition situation of the said market; (2) the control ability of the undertaking in question in the said market; (3) the financial and technical status of the undertaking in question; (4) the degree of dependence of other undertakings on the undertaking in question; and (5) the degree of difficulty to access to the relevant markey by other undertakings

(7)	if the relevant market is clearly defined and the alleged undertaking does not have dominant market position, normally it is not necessary to conduct an abuse behavior analysis and it can be directly concluded that such undertaking did not have abuse behavior; however, if neither the boundary of the relevant market nor the dominant market position of the alleged undertaking is clear or if the alleged undertaking had dominant market position, “effect examination” may be carried out so as to determine if the alleged conduct was lawful or not

(8)	the “tie-in” under the AML is illegal if it meets all of these criteria: (1) the base product and the “tie-in” product are independent to each other, (2) the undertaking has dominant market position in the base product market, (3) certain enforcement implemented upon the buyer who became lack of other options but to accept the tie-in product, (4) the tie-in could not be justified, was contrary to the commercial or consumer practice or ignored the functionalities of the products, and (5) the tie-in gave rise to negative effect to the competition

(9)	if an undertaking successfully proved the alleged monopoly conduct was justifiable under AML does not mean such undertaking has automatically and same successfully proved the monopoly conduct has not caused negative effect of exclusion or restriction of competition.

==History==
The area now known as Astoria was originally called Hallett's Cove, after its first landowner William Hallet, who settled there in 1652 with his wife, [[Elizabeth Fones]]. Beginning in the early 19th century, affluent New Yorkers constructed large residences around 12th and 14th streets, an area that later became known as Astoria Village (now Old Astoria). Hallett's Cove, incorporated on April 12, 1839&lt;ref&gt;http://s-media.nyc.gov/agencies/lpc/arch_reports/952.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and previously founded by fur merchant Stephen A. Halsey, was a noted recreational destination and resort for Manhattan's wealthy.&lt;ref name="Astoria history1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astorialic.org/topics/topics_p.php |title=History Topics |accessdate=February 25, 2008 |format= |work=[[Greater Astoria Historical Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Astoria history2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astorialic.org/neighborhoods/neighborhoods_p.php |title=The Neighborhoods of Long Island City |accessdate=February 25, 2008 |format= |work=[[Greater Astoria Historical Society]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308193450/http://www.astorialic.org/neighborhoods/neighborhoods_p.php |archivedate=March 8, 2008  |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area was renamed for [[John Jacob Astor]], then the wealthiest man in America with a net worth of more than $40 million, in order to persuade him to invest in the neighborhood. He only invested $500, but the name stayed nonetheless, as a bitter battle over naming the village finally was won by Astor's supporters and friends. From Astor's summer home in [[Hell Gate]], [[Manhattan]]—on what is now East 87th Street near [[York Avenue (Manhattan)|York Avenue]]—he could see across the [[East River]] the new [[Long Island]] village named in his honor. Astor, however, never actually set foot in Astoria.

During the second half of the 19th century, economic and commercial growth brought increased immigration from German settlers, mostly furniture and cabinet makers. One such settler was [[Henry E. Steinway|Heinrich Engelhard Steinweg]], patriarch of the Steinway family who founded the piano company [[Steinway &amp; Sons]] in 1853, which today is a worldwide piano company. Later on, the Steinways built a sawmill and foundry, as well as a streetcar line. The family eventually established Steinway Village for their workers, a [[company town]] that provided school instruction in German as well as English.&lt;ref name="Astoria history3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astorialic.org/neighborhoods/stein_p.php |title=Neighborhoods: Steinway |accessdate=February 25, 2008 |format= |work=[[Greater Astoria Historical Society]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080310022426/http://www.astorialic.org/neighborhoods/stein_p.php |archivedate=March 10, 2008  |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the motivation for locating the Steinway factory in Queens was to keep the workers isolated from the ferment of labor organizing and radicalism occurring in other parts of New York, notably the Lower East Side.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = New York city guide; a comprehensive guide to the five boroughs of the metropolis: Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Bronx, Queens, and Richmond|url = https://archive.org/stream/newyorkcityguide00federich#page/556/mode/2up|website = archive.org|accessdate = December 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Astoria and several other surrounding villages, including Steinway, were incorporated into [[Long Island City]] in 1870. Long Island City remained an independent municipality until it was incorporated into New York City in 1898. The area's farms were turned into housing tracts and street grids to accommodate the growing number of residents.&lt;ref name="Astoria history1"/&gt;

Astoria also figured prominently in early American filmmaking as one of its initial centers. That heritage is preserved today by the [[Museum of the Moving Image (New York City)|Museum of the Moving Image]] and [[Kaufman Astoria Studios]].

Today, much of the Astoria waterfront is being redeveloped and underutilized industrial sites in forgotten historic neighborhoods are being revived. Hallets Point is one of five former industrial sites on the waterfront being transformed, and will bring seven new mixed-use residential towers, including 2,000 market-rate units and 500 affordable units, into the neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/waterfront-development-works-hallets-point-article-1.376049 |title=Waterfront development in the works for Hallets Point |last1=Brosh |first1=Brendan |date=June 16, 2009 |website=nydailynews.com |publisher=The New York Daily News |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development will also include new waterfront parks, a supermarket, retail shops and restaurants, and two new schools.

Based on data from the [[2010 United States Census]], the population of Astoria was 78,793, a decrease of 10,329 (11.6%) from the 89,122 counted in [[2000 United States Census|2000]]. Covering an area of {{convert|902.94|acres}}, the neighborhood had a population density of {{convert|87.3|PD/acre|PD/sqmi PD/sqkm}}.&lt;ref name=PLP5&gt;[http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/pdf/data-maps/nyc-population/census2010/t_pl_p5_nta.pdf Table PL-P5 NTA: Total Population and Persons Per Acre - New York City Neighborhood Tabulation Areas*, 2010], Population Division - [[New York City]] Department of City Planning, February 2012.

The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 49.2% (38,749) [[White (U.S. Census)|Non-Hispanic White]], 4.5% (3,553) [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 0.2% (137) [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 16.2% (12,759) [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.0% (30) [[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]], 1.2% (936) from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 2.2% (1,714) from two or more races.

Accessed June 14, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnic groups===
&lt;!-- {{Ethnic New York City sidebar}} --&gt;
Astoria was first settled by the [[Dutch people|Dutch]], English, and [[Germans]] in the 17th century. Many [[Irish American|Irish]] settled in the area during the waves of Irish immigration into New York City during the 19th and early 20th centuries.

[[Italian American|Italians]] were the next significant immigrants in Astoria, and numerous Italian restaurants, delis, bakeries, and pizza shops are found throughout Astoria, particularly in the Ditmars Boulevard area.

[[American Jews|Jews]] were also a significant ethnic and religious group. The [[Astoria Center of Israel]], which is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], was built in 1925 after outgrowing the former Congregation Mishkan Israel, which was built in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astorialic.org/events/jews1_p.php|title=Greater Astoria Historical Society - Events|publisher=|accessdate=April 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1960s saw a large increase of [[Greeks|Greek]] population from mainland [[Greece]], and after [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|1974]], there was an influx of [[Cypriot American|Greeks]] from [[Cyprus]]. This cultural imprint can be seen in the numerous Greek restaurants, bakeries, [[taverna]]s, and cafes, as well as several [[Greek Orthodox]] churches. While the population of Greeks in Astoria was 22,579 in 1980, it dropped to 18,127 by 1990 due to decreased immigration and lower birth rates. Greek organizations in the area include the Hellenic American Action Committee (HANAC) and the Federation of Hellenic Societies of Greater New York.&lt;ref name="NYU"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nyu.edu/classes/blake.map2001/greece.html |title=Astoria: 'A Little Greece' in New York |last=Williams |first=Solange |author2=Stephanie Mejia |year=2001 |publisher=New York University |accessdate=February 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent [[Economy of Greece|economic issues in Greece]] have seen a resurgence of Greek immigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = New wave of Greeks flocking to Astoria|url = http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/new-wave-greeks-flocking-astoria-article-1.1328443|website = NY Daily News|accessdate = December 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 20,000 [[Maltese Americans|Maltese]] also live in Astoria, and although this population has steadily been emigrating from the area, there are still many Maltese, supported by the Maltese Center of New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.everyculture.com/multi/Le-Pa/Maltese-Americans.html|title=Every Culture Page|accessdate=October 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the mid-1970s, the neighborhood's [[Muslim]] population grew from earlier immigrants from [[Lebanon]] to also include people from [[Kosovo]], [[Albania]], [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]], [[Egypt]], [[Syria]], [[Yemen]], [[Tunisia]], [[Morocco]], and [[Algeria]]. In the 1990s, [[Steinway Street]] between 28th Avenue and Astoria Boulevard saw the establishment of many Arabic shops, restaurants, and cafes, which is unofficially called "Little Morocco", due to the amount of Arabs (Predominantly Moroccans) residing there.

[[Croatians]] from [[Croatia]] and [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]] have been numerous since the 1960s and their numbers continue to grow. New populations of South American and Balkan peoples have seen significant growth since the early 1990s, including a large population of [[Brazil]]ians, who reside in the 36th Avenue area. [[Albanians]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Serbs]], and [[Bosnians]] have also shown a rise in numbers. Many [[Spanish Americans]] live in Astoria, with most of them being of [[Galician American|Galician]] heritage from Northwestern Spain; this community is supported by the Casa Galicia (Galicia House) and the Circulo Español (Spanish Circle).

At one time, many [[Bangladeshi American]]s settled in Astoria, but by 2001, many of them had moved to [[Metro Detroit]]. A survey of an Astoria-area Bengali language newspaper estimated that, in an 18-month period until March 2001, 8,000 Bangladeshi people moved to the Detroit area. However, as of 2010, the Bangladeshi American community in Astoria has been increasing.&lt;ref&gt;Kershaw, Sarah. "[https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/08/nyregion/queens-to-detroit-a-bangladeshi-passage.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm Queens to Detroit: A Bangladeshi Passage]." ''[[The New York Times]]''. March 8, 2001. Retrieved on February 28, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Population losses in Queens were particularly high in immigrant neighborhoods such as Astoria, which suffered the greatest population loss in the city, losing more than 10,000 residents between the years 2000 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NYC2010 |url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/pdf/census/census2010/pgrhc.pdf |work=Results from the 2010 census |publisher=City of New York |accessdate=March 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Why|date=July 2016}}

==Geography==

[[File:Astoria Park Night 2007.jpg|right|thumb|Night view of the [[Triborough Bridge]] and [[Manhattan]] from Astoria Park]]
There is some debate as to what constitutes the geographic boundaries of Astoria. The neighborhood was part of [[Long Island City]] prior to the latter's incorporation into the City of New York in 1898.

The area south of Astoria was called Ravenswood, and traditionally, [[Broadway (Queens)|Broadway]] was considered the border between the two. Today, however, many residents and businesses south of Broadway identify themselves as Astorians for convenience or status, since Long Island City has historically been considered an [[Industrial district|industrial area]], and Ravenswood is now mostly a low-income neighborhood. Some of the thoroughfares have lent their names to unofficial terms for the areas they serve. For instance, the eastern end of Astoria, with Steinway Street as its main thoroughfare, is sometimes referred to simply as "Steinway", and the northern end around Ditmars Boulevard is sometimes referred to as "Ditmars", with their convergence point bearing the neighborhood name "Ditmars-Steinway".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |quotes= |last=Jones |first=Delmos J. |authorlink= |author2=Joan Turner |author3=Joan Montbach |date=December 1992 |title=Declining Social Services and the Threat to Social Reproduction: An Urban Dilemma |journal=City &amp; Society |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=99–114 |doi=10.1525/city.1992.6.2.99 |id= |url= |format= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Banners displayed on lamp posts along 30th Avenue refer to it as "the Heart of Astoria".&lt;ref&gt;O'Donnell, Michelle.

Accessed January 30, 2008. "Gary Lyons shook his head. He pointed to welcome banners that had been affixed to lampposts. “See the flag?” he asked. “The heart of Astoria,” it reads, “Welcome to 30th Avenue.”"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ravenswood===
Ravenswood is the name for the strip of land bordering the [[East River]] in Long Island City, and is part of Astoria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forgotten-ny.com/2005/04/quoth-the-ravenswood-queens/ Forgotten New York: Ravenswood]
&lt;/ref&gt;

The land was acquired in 1814 by Col. [[George Gibbs (mineralogist)|George Gibbs]], a businessman from New York City who developed it. Gibbs died in 1833, and the land was divided into nine parcels by three developers. From 1848, there were several mansions built on this land, but the high class housing did not survive. The spring of 1853 brought the opening of a post office of its own and country store "run by Messrs. Moore &amp; Luyster, and Mr. Samuel H. Moore of that firm received the appointment of postmaster, handling the mails in a corner of the store."&lt;ref name="Seyfried"&gt;{{cite book |last=Seyfried |first=Vincent F. |year=1984 |title=300 Years of Long Island City: 1630-1930 |url=http://www.astorialic.org/events.php?id=9 |publisher=Greater Astoria Historical Society |location=USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ravenswood, unlike Astoria, never became a village; there was no disposition at any time to become independent as there was insufficient population or commercial activity to justify such a move. Ravenswood remained an exclusive hamlet within the Town of Newtown until its absorption with the Village of Astoria and the hamlets of [[Hunters Point, Queens|Hunters Point]], [[Blissville, Queens|Blissville]], [[Sunnyside, Queens|Sunnyside]], [[Dutch Kills]], Steinway, Bowery Bay and Middleton in Newtown Township into Long Island City in 1870.&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.astorialic.org/neighborhoods/raven_p.php Neighborhoods: Ravenswood] from the [[Greater Astoria Historical Society]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1870, Ravenswood, along with several other hamlets and the Village of Astoria, merged to form Long Island City.&lt;ref name="Seyfried"/&gt;

In 1875, the first commercial buildings were erected, and the mansions were converted into offices and boarding houses. In 1879, the Long Island Terra Cotta Company was established in Ravenswood, by Rudolph Franke. By 1900, Ravenswood was heavily commercial, and remains so to this day. However, the name has retained its residential character through the [[New York City Housing Authority]] project that was built in 1949 to 1951 with this name between 34th and 36th Avenues, and 12th and 24th Streets.

The name also identifies the large electric power station established along the shore of the East River, just south of the [[Roosevelt Island Bridge]]. The [[Big Allis|Ravenswood No. 3 Generating Station]] was built by [[Consolidated Edison|Con Edison]] in 1963-65 but, due to deregulation, has subsequently been owned by [[KeySpan]], National Grid, and [[TransCanada Corp.|TransCanada]]. The power plant can generate approximately 2,500 megawatts of power, which is about 20 percent of New York City's electricity demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Massey |first=Daniel |title=Labor fight could unplug Queens power plant |newspaper=Crain's New York Business |date=June 23, 2009 |url=http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20090623/FREE/906239978 |accessdate=August 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ditmars===
[[File:Ditmars Residential Neighborhood in Fall of 2012.jpg|thumb|right|220px|A street in Ditmars (2012)]]

Ditmars is a [[middle class]] section of Astoria bounded by [[Bowery Bay]] to the north, 31st Street to the east (boundary with the adjacent neighborhood of Steinway, with which Ditmars is sometimes confused), 23rd Avenue to the south and the [[East River]] on the west. The adjacent Steinway neighborhood was largely developed as a [[company town]] by the [[Steinway &amp; Sons]] piano company, and included houses and public facilities that were also available to non-employees.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth T. Jackson|Jackson, Kenneth T.]], ''[[The Encyclopedia of New York City]]'', [[Yale University Press]], 1995, p. 335.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Ditmars neighborhood was not included in the Steinway &amp; Sons company housing and related facilities project. Ditmars is considered to be a popular neighborhood among young professionals and in some real estate references the adjacent neighborhoods of Ditmars and Steinway are joined as a single "Ditmars-Steinway" reference. The neighborhood takes its name from Ditmars Boulevard which was named in honor of [[Raymond Lee Ditmars]], (1876–1942) famed American herpetologist and curator of Reptiles of the New York Zoological Society at the Bronx Zoo.&lt;ref&gt;Neighborhood Gudies. http://www.nestseekers.com/Guides/Neighborhood/Ditmars-Steinway. June 29, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Astoria Heights===
Astoria Heights, or Upper Ditmars, is bounded by Hazen Street to the west, [[La Guardia Airport]] to the east, [[Bowery Bay]] to the north, and [[Astoria Boulevard]] and the [[Grand Central Parkway]] to the south. It is mostly a quiet [[middle class]] neighborhood of one- and two-family private homes.

The Riker-Lent Homestead is near the north end of Astoria Heights at 78-03 19th Road. Built around 1655 by [[Abraham Rycken|Abraham Riker]] under a patent from Nieuw Nederland's last governor, [[Peter Stuyvesant]], it is believed to be the oldest remaining dwelling in New York City still used as a residence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rikerhome.com/history/overview.htm The Lent-Riker-Smith Homestead: History], accessed December 25, 2006. "The facts confirm that this dwelling is the oldest dwelling in New York City that is still a dwelling."&lt;/ref&gt; There is an adjacent family cemetery. The Smiths, who bought the house in 1975, have been restoring it for many years. The annual public tour was given usually in mid-September by the owners for the benefit of a local historical society, but has since ceased to occur.&lt;ref&gt;In 2008 the tour benefited the  [http://www.astorialic.org/ Greater Astoria Historical Society.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Before [[Prohibition]], there were dance halls, picnic areas, and amusement park rides at North Beach.

Ragtime composer [[Scott Joplin]] is buried across the [[Grand Central Parkway]] at St. Michael's Cemetery, which occasionally holds ragtime concerts.

The [[Rikers Island Bridge]] to New York City's main prison, [[Rikers Island]], runs from the north end of Hazen Street. Technically, Rikers Island is in [[the Bronx]] since New York City took it over from Long Island City in 1884, after it had annexed the South Bronx but before it consolidated Queens. However, like Astoria Heights, Rikers Island gets its mail from the [[East Elmhurst, Queens|East Elmhurst]] ([[Zip code]] 11370) station of the Flushing Post Office.

* The 1973 film adaptation of the [[John-Michael Tebelak]] stage musical ''[[Godspell]]'' includes multiple images of characters beneath the supports for The [[Hell Gate Bridge]], or East River Arch Bridge, as seen from Randall's Island, both while the plot unfolds as well as during visual montages that take place in such numbers as ''Day by Day'' and ''We Beseech Thee''. The view of the bridge is similar to those found in Astoria Park and Astoria can occasionally be viewed in the background of shots facing east.

The high school featured in the film is [[William Cullen Bryant High School]] on 31st Avenue, the church used in the film is St. Joseph's on 30th Avenue, and the funeral parlor scenes were shot from a funeral home on 30th Ave, across the street from St. Joseph's Church.

The game features a Bohemian Hall-inspired "Steinway Beer Garden", but as an Irish-and-German themed bar instead of Czech. (A mock TV commercial for the Steinway Beer Garden, viewable at the Rockstar website, includes the voice-over remarking that the Garden is "ethnically confused.")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rockstargames.com/IV/#?page=steinway&amp;content=video0 |title=Rockstar Games: Grand Theft Auto IV: Steinway Beer Garden |accessdate=February 8, 2008 |format= |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steinway Park is modeled after Astoria Park, with its famous outdoor pool (including the diving platforms) and scenic water's-edge pathway. Numerous signs and awnings of real local Astoria businesses appear in the game, although the names have been altered (e.g. "ASTORIA Medical Dental" becomes "ROSARIA Medical Dental").

"That is where Roark's trial would have been held, since his crime of blowing up Cortlandt Homes took place in Astoria, County of Queens."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Music''''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5702">'''Belinda Mulrooney''' (1872&amp;ndash;1967) was an entrepreneur and purportedly the "richest woman in the Klondike".&lt;ref name=PostalMuseum&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/gold/belinda.html |title=Belinda Mulrooney: The Richest Woman in the Klondike |publisher=[[National Postal Museum]] |accessdate=July 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She made one fortune in the [[Klondike Gold Rush]], lost it, and amassed a second, which lasted most of her life.

Mulrooney was born in Ireland. When she was young, her family either emigrated to Pennsylvania, where her father worked as a miner&lt;ref name=PostalMuseum/&gt; in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]],&lt;ref name=ExploreNorth&gt;{{cite web |url=http://explorenorth.com/library/yafeatures/klondike_women.html |title=Women of the Klondike |author=Ken Spotswood |publisher=explorenorth.com |accessdate=July 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; or sent her to live with relatives there.&lt;ref name=Review&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rmmla.wsu.edu/ereview/55.1/reviews/parker.asp |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121215062148/http://rmmla.wsu.edu/ereview/55.1/reviews/parker.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=December 15, 2012 |title=Review of ''Staking Her Claim: The Life of Belinda Mulrooney, Klondike and Alaska Entrepreneur'', Melanie J. Mayer and Robert N. DeArmand |author=Allene M.

Instead of seeking her fortune as a prospector, Mulrooney bought supplies of "silk underwear, bolts of cotton cloth and hot water bottles"&lt;ref name=PostalMuseum/&gt; with her savings of $5000&lt;ref name=ExploreNorth/&gt; and transported them over the [[Chilkoot Pass]] to [[Dawson City]], where she sold them for six times that amount in June 1897.&lt;ref name=PostalMuseum/&gt; She built a restaurant in Dawson, then a roadhouse, the [[Grand Forks Hotel]] and restaurant, near the gold fields. Prospering, she started buying mining claims as well; by the end of the year, she either owned or was a partner in five.&lt;ref name=PostalMuseum/&gt; She sold the hotel for $24,000 and set about building the finest hotel in Dawson. The [[Fairview Hotel]] opened its doors on July 27, 1898, with a restaurant and rooms for thirty guests.&lt;ref name=PostalMuseum/&gt;

Mulrooney once partnered with fellow Klondike legend [[Alex McDonald (prospector)|Alex McDonald]] to salvage the cargo from a small ship wrecked on a sand bar. McDonald got there first and took all of the food, leaving only [[Wellington boot|gum boots]] and whiskey for her. She got her revenge, however. The next spring, when McDonald needed boots for his workers, he had to pay her $100 a pair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Klondike: The Last Gold Rush 1896-1899 |last=Berton |first=Pierre |authorlink=Pierre Berton |year=2001 |publisher=Anchor Canada |isbn=0-385-65844-3 |pages=181–182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 1, 1900, Mulrooney married self-styled "Count" Charles Eugene Carbonneau, who claimed to be a French aristocrat, but was actually a champagne salesman and former barber from [[Quebec]].&lt;ref name=PostalMuseum/&gt; By 1903&lt;ref name=PostalMuseum/&gt; or 1904,&lt;ref name=Review/&gt; the couple separated, and she lost her fortune. She obtained a divorce in December 1906.&lt;ref name=Review/&gt;

Starting over, she moved to [[Fairbanks, Alaska]] in 1904&lt;ref name=PostalMuseum/&gt; or 1905&lt;ref name=Review/&gt; and prospered once again. She established the [[Dome City Bank]] in Fairbanks&lt;ref name=TimesLeader/&gt; with her younger sister Margaret.&lt;ref name=Review/&gt;

Mulrooney eventually retired to [[Yakima, Washington]], where she had a large mansion built. She supported her family until her money ran out. She then moved to [[Seattle]], where she died in 1967.

The '''Consumer Credit Act 1974''' ([http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1974/39/contents c 39]) is an [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] that significantly reformed the law relating to [[consumer credit]] within the [[United Kingdom]].

Prior to the Consumer Credit Act, legislation covering consumer credit was slapdash and focused on particular areas rather than consumer credit as a whole, such as moneylenders and [[hire-purchase]] agreements. Following the report of the Crowther Committee in 1971 it was decided that wide-ranging reform of consumer credit law was needed, and a bill to do this was introduced to Parliament. Despite its progress through Parliament being disrupted by [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|a general election]], the bill passed quickly through the legislative process thanks to support from both the government and the opposition, coming into law on 31 July 1974.

The Act introduces new protection for consumers and new regulation for bodies trading in consumer credit and related industries. Such traders must have full licenses from the [[Office of Fair Trading]], which may be suspended or revoked in the event of irregularities. The Act also regulates what may be taken as [[Security (finance)|security]], limits the ways in which credit organisations can advertise and gives the [[county court]] the ability to intercede in the case of unfair or unjust credit agreements. It also gives additional rights to the debtor, including certain limited rights to cancel concluded agreements. The Act was amended by the [[Consumer Credit Act 2006]].

==Background==

===Early evolution of consumer protection===
[[Credit (finance)#Consumer credit|Consumer credit]] regulation was almost entirely ignored by both Parliament and the courts for over 800 years, with the judges and [[Member of Parliament (UK)|Members of Parliament]] taking the attitude that there was no reason to interfere with fairly concluded [[English contract law|contracts]]. The first piece of legislation to deal with consumer credit was the [[Bills of Sale Act 1854]], which required [[bill of sale|bills of sale]] to be registered. This allowed the courts to intervene for the first time, since an unregistered bill of sale was void and could not be claimed by creditors.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.1&lt;/ref&gt; This act was followed by the [[Bills of Sale Act 1878]] and the [[Bills of Sale Act (1878) Amendment Act 1882]], which provided limited protection for debtors. Outside of these acts, however, little was done between 1854 and 1900, and moneylenders used this to their advantage, sometimes abusively; the report of the House of Commons Select Committee on Money-Lending in 1898 included testimony from one moneylender who admitted he charged 3,000% interest, while another had worked under 34 different aliases to avoid having notoriety associated with his name.&lt;ref name=g3&gt;Goode (1979) p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of this report the [[Moneylenders Act 1900]] was passed, which required registration for moneylenders and allowed the courts to dissolve "unfair" moneylending agreements. This act had two main weaknesses, however; firstly, many of the debtors who would like to sue their moneylender to have the agreement cancelled were by definition poor, and could not afford legal representation. Secondly, the Act only focused on specific types of lenders; lending by a single moneylender was covered, lending by a bank was not. In 1927 a [[Moneylenders Act 1927|second Moneylenders Act]] was passed, which required licensing as well as registration and forbade moneylenders from employing agents, canvasses or sending out unsolicited advertisements.&lt;ref name=g3/&gt; Unfortunately the 1900 and 1927 Acts also covered commercial transactions, and since people lending money in a commercial area were not excluded as banks were, a slight infraction could make a loan completely irrecoverable. This was partially solved with the passing of the [[Companies Act 1967]], which allowed the [[Board of Trade]] to give individual moneylenders licenses saying that they were acting as banks, not moneylenders.&lt;ref name=g4&gt;Goode (1979) p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the restrictions on business caused by the Moneylenders Act 1927, the idea of [[hire-purchase]] developed. These were first regulated by the [[Hire-Purchase and Small Debt (Scotland) Act 1932]], which only covered [[Scotland]]; England and Wales was first covered by the [[Hire-Purchase Act 1938]], later amended by the [[Hire-Purchase Act 1954]] and the [[Hire-Purchase Act 1964]]. The 1965 Act applied to all hire-purchase agreements worth less than £2,000 and when the hirer and buyer was not a corporation.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crowther Committee===
In 1965 the Crowther Committee was established to look at the state of consumer credit law in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Keenan (2005) p.420&lt;/ref&gt; Chaired by [[Geoffrey Crowther, Baron Crowther|Lord Crowther]], the Committee began sitting in December that year and eventually extended their review to cover consumer credit generally rather than just the bills of sale and moneylending they had initially been concerned with, and their report was finally published in March 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.5&lt;/ref&gt; The report discussed the economical, social and legal aspects of consumer credit, and concluded that the existing law was so confused and unsatisfactory that it was not worth amending.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.6&lt;/ref&gt; Instead it recommended the complete repeal of all existing legislation and its replacement with two new acts: a Lending and Security Act, which would regulate legitimate business transactions, and a Consumer Sale and Loan Act which would regulate consumer credit and establish a licensed system for its use.

The reaction to the report from consumer and business organisations was overwhelmingly positive, but the government initially did nothing, since the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] wanted time to work out the particular details of any Acts. Their hand was eventually forced by [[Norah Phillips, Baroness Phillips|Baroness Phillips]] a year later, who initiated a debate in the [[House of Lords]] on the matter. The government's official statement was that they were willing to accept almost all the recommendations made about consumer credit, they did not wish to legislate on lending and securities.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.7&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1973 they created a Voluntary Code which they expected those lending to observe. The Code set out guidelines for loaning money to individuals and disclosing the cost of the loan.

In September 1973 the government issued a [[white paper]] titled ''Reform of the Law on Consumer Credit'' in which they indicated they were planning to implement almost all of the Crowther Committee's consumer credit recommendations. The only real differences were an increase in the limits for financial protection from £2,000 to £5,000 (due to the drop in value of money), and stronger protection for hirers under hire-purchase agreements.&lt;ref name=g9&gt;Goode (1979) p.9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation of the Act==
The Act was first introduced to Parliament as the Consumer Credit Bill at the beginning of November 1973, and initially ran to 96 pages. It was given its [[second reading]] on 14 November,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1973/nov/14/consumer-credit-bill|title=CONSUMER CREDIT BILL (Hansard, 14 November 1973)|date=14 November 1973|publisher=[[Hansard]]|accessdate=2009-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was welcomed by both the government and opposition.By February 1974 it had passed through the [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom#Committee stage|Committee Stage]], but its progress was cut short by a [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|general election]] in the same month. Thanks to the support of the opposition to the original bill this did not make a significant impact, and the new administration immediately reintroduced the bill in the [[House of Lords]]. It was passed on 31 July 1974, and immediately received the [[Royal Assent]].&lt;ref name=g10&gt;Goode (1979) p.10&lt;/ref&gt; The final version of the act contained 193 sections and 5 schedules, much larger than the original 96 pages.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.37&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisions of the Act==
The Act is divided into 12 sections, and is "designed to provide a comprehensive code regulating the consumer credit and consumer hire fgb and almost every aspect of a credit granting operation".&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.38&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part I: Director General of Fair Trading===
The office of Director General of Fair Trading was created by the [[Fair Trading Act 1973]], with the Director appointed by the government for a five-year term. Consumer credit was not originally part of his duties (although the scope of his role did contain some elements of consumer credit) and the [[Crowther Committee]] had recommended the creation of a separate Consumer Credit Commissioner, something included in the original bill. When the bill was resurrected after the [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|February 1974]] general election, however, it was decided that the duties should instead be given to the Office of Fair Trading, and for this purpose a separate division (the Division of Consumer Credit) was set up within the OFT.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.42&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 1 of the Act gives the Director General of Fair Trading the duties of administering the licensing system set up by the Act, supervising the working and enforcement of the Act and any regulations made by it and, if appropriate, enforce the Act and regulations himself. The DGFT is also tasked with advising the government about social and commercial developments within the United Kingdom, and any actions taken to enforce the Act and its orders and regulations. Section 4 of the act requires him to disseminate any appropriate information and advice about consumer credit to the people of the United Kingdom. This allows him to educate the public about consumer credit, and was intended to be conducted through organisations such as the [[Citizens Advice Bureau]]. The Director's duties under this Act overlap slightly with those given by the Fair Trading Act, but are still an expansion over his original role.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.43&lt;/ref&gt; The Director General is tasked with issuing licenses, and under Section 35 of the Act, the Director is required to maintain a register containing all appropriate information related to licenses and applications for licenses. The register was created on 2 February 1976, and is kept at Chancery House in London.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.47&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Enterprise Act 2002]] formally substituted the Office of Fair Trading for the Director General of Fair Trading for the purposes of this Act.&lt;ref&gt;Enterprise Act 2002 S.278-9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part II: Credit agreements, hire agreements and linked transactions===
Part II contains definitions for many types of agreements covered by the Act. There are three main types of agreement; regulated consumer credit agreements, regulated consumer hire agreements and partially regulated agreements.

====Regulated agreements====
A regulated consumer credit agreement is defined as an agreement between two parties, one of whom (the debtor) is an individual, and the other of whom (the creditor) is "any other person", in which the creditor provides the debtor with credit not exceeding £5,000 (this figure was subsequently increased to £25,000 and under the Consumer Credit Act 2006 there is no upper limit). An exception to this definition is so-called "exempt agreements", which are agreements made where the creditor is a land improvement company, a charity, a [[friendly society]], a trade union, an insurance company or "a body corporate named or specifically referred to in any public general Act".&lt;ref&gt;Consumer Credit Act 1974 S.16(1)&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of "agreement" is given as any discussion which produces a legal relationship; a [[English contract law|contract]]. As such the decision of courts as to whether an agreement constituted an "agreement" under the Act rests with English contract law, and is not discussed within the Act. In many cases this is largely academic, however, since unless one party tries to contest the existence of a contract any agreement can proceed regardless of its validity under contract law.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.53&lt;/ref&gt;

"Individual" is defined as including a partnership or other unincorporated body, but not corporations registered at [[Companies House]] or created by an [[Act of Parliament]] or [[Royal Charter]], such as the [[BBC]]. The definition also excludes "corporations sole", such as certain government ministers and bishops. Under the [[Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1965]], [[industrial and provident society|industrial and provident societies]] are considered corporate bodies and thus excluded from the Act, but friendly societies and trade unions are unincorporated and thus qualify. In contrast, however, the definition of "person" includes both individuals and incorporated bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.55&lt;/ref&gt;

A regulated consumer hire agreement is defined as an agreement between two bodies, one of whom (the hirer) is an individual, and the other of whom, (the owner) is a person, by which goods are loaned to the hirer for use without an option to purchase.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.56&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement must be "capable of subsisting" for longer than three months, not require the hirer to make payments of more than £5,000 total and not be an "exempt agreement". "Goods" are defined as [[Personal property|chattels personal]], with "capable of subsisting" simply meaning that the agreement does not restrict the time limit of use to less than three months. The agreement does not have to exceed three months, but the option to do so must be given by one party.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.57&lt;/ref&gt;

====Partially regulated agreements====
Partially regulated agreements are those consumer hire or consumer credit agreements which are not an exempt agreement but are exempt from certain provisions of the Act. What these provisions are depends on the type of agreement; small agreements, non-commercial agreements and contracts with a foreign element.

Small agreements are defined in Section 17 of the act as regulated consumer credit agreements where the credit does not exceed £30 and regulated consumer hire agreements which do not require the hirer to pay more than £30 in fees. This does not include hire-purchase or conditional sale agreements, which do not qualify regardless of the size of credit, secure transactions and transactions where the parties have attempted to break up a transaction into multiple smaller ones worth under £30 to avoid regulation.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.58&lt;/ref&gt;  Small agreements are exempt from almost all of Part V of the act, although they remain controlled by Part IV.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.59&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act is primarily aimed at commercial and professional traders, and as a result excludes non-commercial agreements. Non-commercial agreements are defined by the Act as agreements where neither the creditor nor debtor are providing the transaction for business purposes in any way. Non-commercial agreements are exempt from Part V of the Act.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.60&lt;/ref&gt;

Contracts with a foreign element would not normally be mentioned in Acts of Parliament, which are deliberately constructed to avoid giving the law extraterritorial effect. In this case, however, the Act contains provisions for contracts with a foreign element, which due to the nature of commerce are common (a credit card issued in the United Kingdom, for example, which is used on holiday in France). As a result, Section 16(5) specifically excludes contracts "having a connection with a country outside the United Kingdom" from the Act.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.62&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part III: Licensing of credit and hire businesses===
The previous Acts on commercial credit provided no mechanism to regulate and enforce the rules, and the Consumer Credit Act's licensing system was the first major regulatory process within British consumer credit law. Licenses are required to carry out a consumer credit or consumer hire business, with exceptions for local authorities and corporate bodies allowed by an Act of Parliament to carry out consumer credit business. All other bodies must apply to the Consumer Credit Licensing Branch of the [[Office of Fair Trading]] for a license.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.106&lt;/ref&gt;

====Types of license====
There are two types of license given - group licenses and standard licenses.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.108&lt;/ref&gt;

Group licenses are issued by the Director General of Fair Trading to cover a group of people in those activities described in the license. Group licenses can be issued following an application, or simply voluntarily by the Director. Holders of a group license do not have to apply individually and are not vetted individually, and holding a group license does not prevent members from also applying for a standard license. The group licenses are intended for cases where individual screening is not in the public interest; for example, when bodies are so large and established that their reputation is without question and individual screening would take too much time. Bodies currently holding group licenses include the [[Law Society of England and Wales]] and the [[Law Society of Northern Ireland]], both professional associations of [[solicitors]]. The Director has the ability to exclude named individuals from group licenses to prevent obvious abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.109&lt;/ref&gt;

Standard licenses are licenses issued by the Director General to an individual. It can only be provided following an application, not at the Director General's discretion like a group license, and covers certain activities in a fixed period. Initially there was no obligation to issue licenses, but an amendment to the bill in Parliament means that the Director General is required to issue a license on the application of any person, providing that person is a fit person to engage in such activities and the name he applies to be licensed under is not misleading or undesirable. The license allows an individual or a partnership to trade under those names listed on the license, and is divided into seven categories:
*Category A: Consumer credit business
*Category B: Consumer hire business
*Category C: Credit brokerage
*Category D: Debt-adjusting and counselling
*Category E: Debt-collecting
*Category F: Credit reference agencies

Holders of a license are obliged to inform the Director General when there is a change made within the office of a corporate licensee, an unincorporated body or a partnership. This must be done within 21 days of the change occurring. Details of new licenses are published in the ''Consumer Credit Bulletin'', the weekly journal of the [[Office of Fair Trading]].  A license lasts for 3 years beginning with the date specified on the license, not the date of its issue. A person who engages in activities that require a license when he does not have one commits a criminal offence. In addition, those agreements he makes are considered unenforceable unless the Director General directly intercedes.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.117&lt;/ref&gt;

A license can be terminated on the death of the licensee, the licensee becoming bankrupt, the licensee becoming a patient under the [[Mental Health Act 1959]], a bankruptcy deal under the [[Bankruptcy Act 1914]] in which the license is given to a trustee or a deal under the [[Deeds of Arrangement Act 1914]] in which the licensee's license is handed to a trustee. Such provisions cover both individual, unincorporated bodies and partnerships who are license holders.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.119&lt;/ref&gt; These provisions do not cover corporate bodies, because following consultations the Government became aware that the liquidation and winding-up of a corporate body would pose problems with licensing, largely because the body continues to trade through a liquidator.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.120&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part IV: Seeking business===
The Act specifically controls the way in which traders and companies seek business. Prior to this individual aspects had been controlled — advertisement by moneylenders had been strictly regulated since the [[Moneylenders Act 1927]] — but no other aspects of consumer credit were regulated at all. While this was acceptable for large and respectable institutions, the evolution of less reputable trading organisations necessitated some kind of regulation, and the Consumer Credit Act was the first statute to provide such controls for consumer credit organisations. It covers three main areas: advertising, canvassing and quotations and the display of information. No regulations have yet been made on quotations or the display of information.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.140&lt;/ref&gt;

====Advertising====
The advertising provisions apply to any advertisement published for the business carried out by the advertiser which indicates he is willing to provide credit or provide goods to be hired. "advertisement" is taken to mean any form of advertisement, including a publication, television or radio broadcast, the display of signs, labels or goods, the distribution of samples, circulars, catalogues or price lists or the exhibition of picture, models or films, or in "any other way". Previous legislation such as the [[Advertisements (Hire-Purchase) Act 1967]] limited the definition of advertisement to visual advertisements and excluded oral communications and radio broadcasts, which are included by the Act. The test of whether an oral communication counts as an "advertisement" is whether or not the communication is made for drawing attention to the advertiser's business or for answering a specific enquiry without promoting the business. In ''[[R. v Delmayne]]'' [1970] 2 QB 170 the [[High Court of Justice]] decided that even replying to an enquiry can amount to an advertisement if framed in such a way that it is calculated to attract business.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.141&lt;/ref&gt;

Part IV only applies to "public" advertising published to promote a business — as such circulars given to employees advertising such terms would not be considered "advertisements". Advertisements are not regulated by the Act if the advertiser is not involved in a consumer credit business, consumer hire business or a business in which he provides credit to individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.142&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Part IV, the Secretary of State can make regulations limiting the form and content of advertisements covered by the Act. The regulations can also specifically include certain terms or facts, and failing to follow them constitutes an offence. The intent of these regulations is to ensure that no advertisement contains misleading information, that advertisements provide the reader with a "reasonable picture" of the terms and conditions and that the reader is aware that the availability and terms of credit may be affected by factors such as the age and employment of the applicant.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.144&lt;/ref&gt;

====Canvassing====
The Crowther Committee recommended that [[Peddler|doorstep canvassing]] for loans should be completely prohibited. The original provisions in the bill were indeed extremely stringent, and caused potential problems for other businesses, but were significantly amended and now only affect the canvassing they were intended to prevent. Canvassing is defined as a situation in which an individual (the canvasser) solicits the entry of another individual (the consumer) into an agreement based on his oral representations during a visit by the canvasser to "any place" for the purpose of making such representations. Exceptions to "any place" are places where business is carried out, either permanently or temporarily, by the creditor, owner, supplier, canvasser, employer of the canvasser or the consumer. There is no requirement that the oral solicitations take place in person - they can come over the telephone, or be trying to induce another individual to convince the consumer into entering an agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.147&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part V: Entry into credit or hire agreements===
Part V of the Act deals with four elements of entering into a credit or hire agreement; pre-contract disclosure, the formalities of entry into a regulated agreement, cancellation of a regulated agreement and its consequences and withdrawal from a prospective regulated agreement and its consequences. In some cases, specific information must be disclosed before a contract is made, with the standard provision that contracts where this is not followed are unenforceable without an order from the courts.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.181&lt;/ref&gt;

====Formalities====
There are certain formalities for entry into a regulated agreement, mostly based on the documentation that must be provided. Under Section 60, the Secretary of State is required to make certain regulations covering the format that contracts must take. These regulations must ensure that the debtor is made aware of the rights and/or duties conferred on him by the agreement, the amount and rate of the total charge for credit, the protection and remedies available to him and "any other matters which, in the opinion of the secretary of state, it is desirable for him to know about in connection with the agreement". The Act allows the Director General of Fair Trading to waive certain requirements if it appears, on the application of a consumer credit business, that to enforce them would be impracticable.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.182&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 61 lays out the formalities required for a regulated agreement. The terms must be found in a signed and legible document, a copy of the unsigned agreement must be supplied to the debtor or hirer, a copy of the signed document must be supplied to the debtor or hirer and a notice advising the debtor or hirer of his rights of cancellation must be included with the signed and unsigned copies. The "signed and legible document" is described in Section 61 as a document which contains all the prescribed terms, other than implied terms, and is, when presented to the debtor or hirer for signature, in such a state that all its terms are legible. Such a document must be in the form "prescribed by regulations".&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.183&lt;/ref&gt;

The regulations in question are the 1983 Regulations (UK Parliament SIs 1980-1989/1983/1551-1600/Consumer Credit (Agreements) Regulations 1983 (SI 1983/1553) 1983 No 1553 "Consumer Credit (Agreements) Regulations 1983"). These regulations laid down specific rules regarding certain "prescribed terms". For example, a regulated credit agreement had to contain prescribed information about the amount of credit, the length of any fixed term loan, the amount of monthly repayments and so on. If a lender failed to comply with the prescribed regulations then the agreement would not be "properly executed" under section 61 and could then be challenged as "irredeemably unenforceable" under section 127.

====Withdrawals====
Part V contains several provisions relating to the cancellation of a regulated agreement and the withdrawal from a prospective regulated agreement. These are similar to those found in the [[Hire-Purchase Act 1965]], but cover all consumer credit and consumer hire agreements rather than the hire-purchase and instalment sale agreements previously covered. The withdrawal from a prospective agreement is found primarily at [[common law]]; a party may withdraw from a prospective agreement at any point before it becomes a contract without obligations. He can withdraw the prospective agreement by notice to the other party, with the Act allowing the creditor to use credit brokers as agents for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.190&lt;/ref&gt;

The right to cancel a confirmed agreement was introduced by the [[Hire-Purchase Act 1964]], mainly to frustrate doorstep salesmen who would take advantage of an unsuspecting person and force them to sign up to an agreement, normally with misrepresentations. In the Consumer Credit Act, the right of cancellation is covered in Section 67, which allows the debtor or hirer the right to cancel an agreement if there were false oral representations made to the debtor by somebody acting for the creditor. The cancellation may be enacted by serving a notice of writing given to the creditor or an agent of the creditor within six days of the agreement being made.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.202&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part VI: Matters arising during currency of credit or hire agreements===

===Part VII: Default and termination===

===Part VIII: Security===
The Act was the first attempt by the Government of the United Kingdom to provide coherent rules relating to the taking of [[Security (finance)|securities]] when dealing with consumer credit. Other than the Bills of Sale Acts there had been little law on securities before this, apart from a few provisions in the Hire-Purchase Acts. The Consumer Credit Act devoted an entire part of the Act to security, mostly between debtor and creditor, with third-party rights and regulations mostly governed by [[common law]]. The Act provides the form of securities, requires certain information and documents to be supplied, controls the enforcement of securities and provides certain circumstances in which securities can be considered void.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.260&lt;/ref&gt;

"Security" is defined by the Act to mean any form of [[Mortgage law|mortgage]], [[Bond (finance)|bond]], indemnity, guarantee or other right provided by the debtor as "security" to the consumer credit or hire-purchase agreement being conducted with the creditor. This covers both "real" securities such as mortgages and personal securities such as bonds. The only requirement is that the security must be given at the request of the debtor. Any security must be expressed in writing, and in some cases are part of the original hire agreement. This is distinct from previous law, which required a written note of the agreement but allowed the agreement to be conducted orally.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.261&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain other formalities must be observed; under Section 105, a security is not considered properly executed unless a document is signed on or on behalf of the debtor. This document must conform to certain regulations; the terms must be legible when it is presented to be signed, it must give all the terms and conditions other than implied terms, a copy must also be presented and if the security is provided before the regulated agreement is made, a copy of the security agreement must be given to the debtor within seven days of the regulated agreement being made.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.262&lt;/ref&gt; If the formalities are not complied with the security agreement becomes unenforceable without a court order.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.263&lt;/ref&gt; The Act does not provide for any civil or criminal sanctions for creditors who enforce the agreement without a court order, however, but it may lead to the revocation or suspension of the creditor's license.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.265&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part IX: Judicial control===
Part IX gives the courts wide powers to re-open credit deals deemed extortionate and gives them control over regulated agreements. Section 189 establishes that "courts" means the [[county court]]; all problems are to be brought to the county court, although certain situations relating to extortionate credit agreements can be sent to the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]].&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.321&lt;/ref&gt;

====Orders====
[[File:Watford County Court.jpg|thumb|right|The County Court at Watford: the county court deals with the majority of judicial actions brought under the Act.]]
The courts are allowed to issue enforcement orders for cases where the contract has been infringed upon, except in situations where the contract has not been signed or the terms are not set out in the contract, in which case they are permanently unenforceable. The courts are also prohibited from making enforcement orders where the owner or creditor did not give a copy of the agreement to the debtor or hirer before the contract commenced. Other than this the court is obliged to issue such orders. There are also situations in which orders can be made even when there has been no infringement. These are when the debtor or hirer has died, to recover protected goods without the consent of a debtor and to enforce a land mortgage.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.323&lt;/ref&gt;

The courts can also make "time orders" providing for either payment by the debtor of any sum owed to the creditor, remedying any breach of the agreement by the debtor other than non-payment of money or both. These orders are made at the discretion of the courts after an application for an enforcement order.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.325&lt;/ref&gt; The time orders can also cover [[Bailment|statutory bailment]] in the case of hire-order or hire-purchase agreements.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.326&lt;/ref&gt; If the court feels that the property in dispute or acting as security is at risk of damage or deprecation, they can give protection orders preventing the use of the property. This re-enacts Section 35 of the [[Hire-Purchase Act 1965]], which was repealed by the Consumer Credit Act.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.330&lt;/ref&gt;

Other orders are "special orders", covered by Section 133 of the Act. There are two types; return orders and transfer orders. Return orders are orders from the court requiring the return of goods covered by the agreement to the creditor. These orders may be immediate or subject to a delay, and may give the debtor the option to pay the goods value to the creditor if he does not return the goods in time. Transfer orders are orders transferring the creditor's ownership of certain goods to the debtor, ordering the payment of the rest of the goods to the creditor. This can only be done if the debtor pays an amount of money equal or more than one third of the value of the returned goods.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.332&lt;/ref&gt;

====Credit bargains====
The courts have long held [[Equity (law)|equitable]] jurisdiction to set aside "harsh and unconscionable bargains", but prior to the Consumer Credit Act this was mainly used in cases where uninformed tradespeople have been selling goods at a loss, and was rarely used in the 20th century. The [[Moneylenders Act 1900]] allowed the court to re-open a moneylending transaction if there was evidence that interest rates were "harsh and unconscionable or otherwise such that a court of equity would give relief", unless the moneylender could justify the rates. It was rarely used in the field of consumer credit because it was limited to those sorts of consumer transactions covered by the Moneylenders Act, and did not cover hire-purchase agreements or instalment sale agreements or loan transactions from people who were not moneylenders, such as banks.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.334&lt;/ref&gt;

The Consumer Credit Act provided guidelines for the court in determining whether a credit bargain is extortionate and extends the courts jurisdiction in this area to cover all credit agreements. If the court does believe the bargain was extortionate, it can re-open the agreement and examine the terms of it. If they decide it is indeed extortionate, they can set aside the remaining money owed, order the creditor to give money to the debtor, alter the terms of the agreement or order the return of any security.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.341&lt;/ref&gt; This only covers consumer credit agreements, not hire agreements.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.335&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part X: Ancillary credit businesses===

====Definitions====
An ancillary credit business is defined in Section 145 of the Act as any business that works in [[credit broker]]age, debt adjusting, debt collecting, debt counselling or as a credit reference agency.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.346&lt;/ref&gt;

Credit brokers are people involved in negotiating deals between potential debtors looking for credit and creditors, normally in exchange for a commission. Under the Act, "credit broker" includes not only [[mortgage broker]]s and loan brokers but also car dealers, shops that introduce customers to financial houses for [[hire-purchase]] agreements and [[solicitor]]s who negotiate advances for non-corporate clients. An exception to this is if introductions and negotiations are not made in the individual's capacity as an employee of a business.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.347&lt;/ref&gt;

Debt adjusting is when a company or individual negotiates with the creditor or owner in an agreement on behalf of the debtor to change the terms for the discharge of the debt, takes over the debt in exchange for payment by the debtor or engages in "any similar activity concerned with the liquidation of a debt".Pieheads  This is again a wide area; the base definition covers, for example, solicitors and accountants who act as negotiators for clients who owe money to a third party. There are certain exceptions; a solicitor negotiating for the settlement of his client's debts is not considered to be working as a debt adjuster thanks to Section 146 of the Act, which excludes "a solicitor engaging in contentious business" as defined in the [[Solicitors Act 1957]].&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.348&lt;/ref&gt;

Debt counselling is the giving of advice to debtors or hirers about the liquidation of debts under consumer credit or consumer hire agreements. This covers any debt counsellor, regardless of if it is free legal advice; as a result the [[Citizens Advice Bureau]], for example, is considered a debt counsellor, although its advisers are covered by a group license. Debt collectors are covered by similar provisions, and are defined as anybody who takes steps to "procure payment of debts due" under consumer credit agreements and consumer hire agreements. Those who "purchase" debts and attempt to collect on them are covered by this definition.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.349&lt;/ref&gt;

Exceptions for these definitions are provided under Section 146 if the credit broker, debt adjuster, debt counsellor or debt collector is the creditor or owner under the credit agreement, the supplier under the agreement, a credit broker who has acquired the business of the supplier or somebody expressly excluded from certain definitions, such as a [[solicitor]]. The provisions for suppliers only come into effect when the credit is a loan, so that the supplier and creditor are different people. The exceptions do not include people who "buy" the roles above by purchasing the debts, such as professional debt buyers or financial houses.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.350&lt;/ref&gt;

Credit reference agencies are covered separately from other ancillary credit businesses, and are defined in Section 148 as individuals or companies which carry on a business "comprising the furnishing of persons with information relevant to the financial standard of individuals, being information collected by the agency for that purpose". This definition was the subject of much academic debate, because the holding of the license for a credit reference agency involves a duty to supply information on credit status which the company might prefer to keep confidential. There are exceptions; the information must be collected for the purpose of giving it to others, so the fact that a bank, for example, has that information, does not mean they need to obtain a license as a credit reference agency.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.351&lt;/ref&gt;

====Licensing and other matters====
Part III of the Act applies directly to ancillary credit businesses, who must obtain a license. As with standard credit agreements, agreements made by an unlicensed ancillary trader are only enforceable against the other party if the Director General of Fair Trading issues an order which applies to the agreement. Under Section 149, creditors have an onus to make sure that the credit brokers they obtain business from are duly licensed. Again, if the broker is unlicensed, the agreement between the debtor and creditor is only enforceable when the Director General makes an order saying so. These provisions came into effect on 1 July 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.353&lt;/ref&gt;

Part IV of the Act also applies to ancillary credit businesses in relation to advertising, canvassing and quotations, as well as ways in which business can be sought. The Act also limited the brokerage fees that credit brokers can charge. Under Section 155, if the brokerage work does not lead to the client entering into an agreement with a creditor within 6 months of the work, the entire fee (minus the sum of £1) is refundable to the client. The Director General at the time indicated that those businesses which flouted Section 155 would be refused a license. These provisions came into force on 1 April 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.354&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part XI: Enforcement of Act===

===Part XII: Supplement===

==Implementation of the Act==
Some elements of the Act came into force on 31 July 1974, the day it was passed, but many were left to be brought in later at the discretion of the government. This process was "painfully slow", with almost nothing apart from the licensing system being active in 1979.&lt;ref name=g10/&gt; Section 141, which requires enforcement actions of a regulated credit or linked transaction to be pursued in the [[county court]], came into force on 19 May 1985 through the [[Statutory instrument (UK)|statutory instrument]] "Consumer Credit Act 1974 (Commencement No. 8) Order 1983".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=17 February 1988|title=LEGAL UPDATE - Consumer credit – Consumer Credit Act 1974 (practice note issued by the Queen's Bench Masters 21 January 1988)|journal=Law Society Gazette|volume=85|issue=38|issn=0262-1495|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/uk/legal/results/docview/docview.do?docLinkInd=true&amp;risb=21_T7549115139&amp;format=GNBFULL&amp;sort=PUBLISHED-DATE,D,H,$PSEUDOLOSK,A,H&amp;startDocNo=1&amp;resultsUrlKey=29_T7549115144&amp;cisb=22_T7549115143&amp;treeMax=true&amp;treeWidth=0&amp;csi=280335&amp;docNo=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act repealed the [[Hire-Purchase Act 1965]], the [[Advertisements (Hire Purchase) Act 1967]], the [[Moneylenders Act 1900]], the [[Moneylenders Act 1927]], the [[Pawnbrokers Act 1872]] and the [[Pawnbrokers Act 1960]]. The Act was influential outside the United Kingdom, and was studied in both the [[United States]] and the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. It formed the basis of a 1979 Directive on Consumer Credit of the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name=g10/&gt;

The Act did not go to the full extent suggested by the Crowther Committee's report, with protection only being available for consumers, not for the credit industry.&lt;ref&gt;Rogerson (1975) p.436&lt;/ref&gt;
The Act was widely supported by all sides of the political spectrum, and by academia. Arthur Rogerson compared it to the [[Law of Property Act 1925]] in that, like the 1925 Act, it "represents fundamental rethinking of an area of great economic significance, which has resulted in the sweeping away of a chaos of obsolete rules, and the substitution for them of a simpler and better enforced body of law".&lt;ref&gt;Rogerson (1975) p.435&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Contract law}}

'''''Contra proferentem''''' ([[Latin language|Latin]]: "against [the] offeror"),&lt;ref name="bld"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Black's Law Dictionary]]|edition=9th|editor-last1=Garner|editor-first1=Bryan A.|editor-link1=Bryan A. Garner |first=Henry C. |last=Black |authorlink=Henry Campbell Black |location=St. Paul, MN |publisher=[[West Publishing]] |year=2009 |type=Print. |isbn=0-314-19949-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as "interpretation against the draftsman", is a [[Legal doctrine|doctrine]] of [[contract]]ual interpretation providing that, where a promise, agreement or [[contractual term|term]] is [[ambiguity|ambiguous]], the preferred meaning should be the one that works against the interests of the party who provided the wording.&lt;ref name="r2d206"&gt;{{cite book|last=American Law Institute|title=Restatement (Second) of Contracts|year=1981|publisher=American Law Institute Publishers|location=St. Paul, Minnesota|volume=2|chapter=The Scope of Contractual Obligations|at=§ 206|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The doctrine is often applied to situations involving standardized contracts or where the parties are of unequal [[bargaining power]], but is applicable to other cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|American Law Institute|1981|loc=§ 206, cmt. a}}&lt;/ref&gt; The doctrine is not, however, directly applicable to situations where the language at issue is mandated by law, as is often the case with [[insurance contract]]s and [[bill of lading|bills of lading]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|American Law Institute|1981|loc=§ 206, cmt. b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reasoning behind this rule is to encourage the drafter of a contract to be as clear and explicit as possible and to take into account as many foreseeable situations as it can.

Additionally, the rule reflects the court's inherent dislike of [[Standard form contract|standard-form take-it-or-leave-it contracts]] also known as contracts of adhesion (e.g., standard form insurance contracts for individual [[consumer]]s, residential leases, etc.). The [[court]] perceives such contracts to be the product of bargaining between parties in unfair or uneven positions. To mitigate this perceived unfairness, [[legal system]]s apply the doctrine of ''contra proferentem''; giving the benefit of any doubt in favor of the party upon whom the contract was foisted.  Some courts when seeking a particular result will use ''contra proferentem'' to take a strict approach against insurers and other powerful contracting parties and go so far as to interpret [[Contractual Term|terms]] of the contract in favor of the other party, even where the meaning of a term would appear clear and unambiguous on its face,{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} although this application is disfavored.

''Contra proferentem'' also places the cost of losses on the party who was in the best position to avoid the harm. This is generally the person who drafted the [[contract]]. An example of this is the insurance contract mentioned above, which is a good example of an adhesion contract. There, the insurance company is the party completely in control of the terms of the contract and is generally in a better position to, for example, avoid contractual forfeiture. This is a longstanding principle: see, for example, [[California Civil Code]] §1654 (“In cases of uncertainty ... the language of a contract should be interpreted most strongly against the party who caused the uncertainty to exist"), which was enacted in 1872. Numerous other states have also codified the rule.

The principle has also been codified in international instruments such as the [[UNIDROIT]] Principles and the [[Principles of European Contract Law]].

'''Edgar William Brandt''' (1880–1960) was a [[France|French]] [[ironwork]]er, prolific weapons designer and head of a company that designed 60mm, 81mm and 120mm [[Mortar (weapon)|mortars]] that were very widely copied throughout and subsequent to World War II. He also invented discarding-[[sabot]] [[artillery]] shells,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ian V. Hogg, |title=German Secret Weapons of the Second World War: The Missiles, Rockets, Weapons and New Technology of the Third Reich (Greenhill Military Paperbacks) |publisher=Greenhill Books |location=London |year= |isbn=1-85367-510-5 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contributed substantially through his development of [[High explosive anti-tank warhead|HEAT]] rifle grenades to the development of effective HEAT-warhead weapons for infantry anti-tank use.

In 1902, Brandt set up the business ''établissements Brandt'', where he produced ironwork and light armaments; this was based at 76 rue Michel-Ange in [[Paris]].

His company was nationalised in 1936, and subsequently it purchased several engineering companies including the ''société Mécanique Industrielle de Précision (MIP)'' at [[Tulle]] in 1938. The same year, Brandt opened a major facility at [[La Ferté-Saint-Aubin]] which became the company's headquarters.

In 1956 [[Hotchkiss et Cie]] merged with établissements Brandt to form the Hotchkiss-Brandt company, which ten years later merged with [[Thomson-CSF|Thomson]] and became ''Thomson-Brandt Armements''. After further evolutions, the company is now called [[TDA Armements SAS]] and is a part of the [[Thales Group]].

He also was a very fine artist. He made things out of metal like his very fine Firescreen he created for a fireplace.

== Products ==
Some of the products designed and built by Brandt's company and its successors include:

* [[Brandt 60 mm LR Gun-mortar]]
* [[Brandt Mle CM60A1]] 60 mm gun-mortar
* [[Brandt Mle 27/31]] 81 mm mortar
* [[Brandt Mle 1935]] 60 mm mortar
* [[Mortier 120mm Rayé Tracté Modèle F1]]

An '''evil corporation''' is a [[wikt:trope|trope]] in [[popular culture]] that portrays a [[corporation]] as ignoring [[social responsibility]] in order to make money for its shareholders.&lt;ref name="allan"&gt;{{cite news | last=Allan | first=Angela | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/04/evil-corporation-trope/479295/ | title=How the 'Evil Corporation' Became a Pop-Culture Trope | work=[[The Atlantic]] | date=April 25, 2016 | accessdate=January 11, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Angela Allan writing in ''[[The Atlantic]]'', the notion is "deeply embedded in the landscape of contemporary culture—populating films, novels, videogames, and more." The [[science fiction]] genre served as the initial background to portray corporations in this [[dystopian]] light.&lt;ref name="allan" /&gt; Evil corporations can be seen to represent the danger of combining [[capitalism]] with larger [[hubris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=McHenry | first=Jackson | url=https://www.gq.com/story/mr-robot-e-corp | title=''Mr. Robot''{{'}}s Chilling Message: Every Corp Is E Corp | work=[[GQ]] | date=August 26, 2015 | accessdate=January 11, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In real life, too, corporations have been accused of being evil. To guard against such accusations, [[Google]] adopted the official motto "[[Don't be evil]]",&lt;ref name="allan" /&gt; which it later silently abandoned following an employee exodus in protest of a [[Unmanned combat aerial vehicle|military drone]] [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gizmodo.com/google-removes-nearly-all-mentions-of-dont-be-evil-from-1826153393|title=Google Removes 'Don't Be Evil' Clause From Its Code of Conduct|last=Conger|first=Kate|work=Gizmodo|access-date=2018-06-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.livescience.com/62225-google-drone-project-maven-letter.html|title=Google Employees Are Livid About Company's 'Evil' Military Partnership|work=Live Science|access-date=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New Yorker]]'' wrote that "many food activists consider [[Monsanto]] to be ''the'' definitively evil corporation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Specter | first=Michael | url=http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/why-the-climate-corporation-sold-itself-to-monsanto | title=Why the climate corporation sold itself to Monsanto | journal=[[The New Yorker]] | date=November 4, 2013 | accessdate=January 23, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Debate over Corporate Social Responsibility'' wrote, "For many consumers, [[Wal-Mart]] serves as the evil corporation prototype, but record numbers shop at the stores for low prices."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author-last1=Kendall | author-first1=Brenden E. | author-last2=Gill | author-first2=Rebecca | author-last3=Cheney | author-first3=George | year=2007 | chapter=Consumer Activism and Corporate Social Responsibility: How Strong a Connection? | editor-last1=May | editor-first1=Steven K. | editor-last2=Cheney | editor-first2=George | title=The Debate over Corporate Social Responsibility | publisher=Oxford University Press | page=258 | isbn=978-0-19-517883-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan, a committee of journalists and rights activists issues an annual "corporate raspberry award" known as Most Evil Corporation of the Year Award (also called the Black Company Award) to [[Black company (Japanese term)|a company "with a culture of overwork, discrimination and harassment"]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Kikuchi | first=Daisuke | url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/12/23/national/social-issues/ad-giant-dentsu-declared-evil-corporation-year/ | title=Ad giant Dentsu declared Most Evil Corporation of the Year | work=[[The Japan Times]] | date=December 23, 2016 | accessdate=January 27, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Field Artillery''''' (or '''FA''') is a discontinued bimonthly magazine on the subject of [[field artillery]], published from 1911 to 2007. It was published by the US Field Artillery Association, [[Fort Sill]], [[Oklahoma]] and was an official publication of the [[United States Army Field Artillery Corps]]. Its intended readership included active and reserve [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] field artillerymen stationed around the world. In its final years, ''FA'' included much discussion of the military operations in both [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq War|Iraq]].

==History==
The magazine was first published as the ''Field Artillery Journal'' in 1911. It has gone through several name changes. Due to low subscriptions it merged with the ''[[Infantry (magazine)|Infantry Journal]]'' in 1950,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/009799716/Home |title=United States Army Combat Forces Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was published as ''Combat Forces Journal''; CFJ became ''Army'' in 1954.

The US Army Artillery and Missile School began the in-house publication of ''Tactical and Technical Trends in Artillery for Instruction'' in 1957 that was renamed to ''Artillery Trends'' in 1958. After the Artillery branch split into the Field Artillery and Air Defense Artillery branches in 1969, the name changed to ''The Field Artilleryman''. ''Field Artillery Journal'' restarted in 1973 as an official Field Artillery branch publication. Due to budget cuts, the magazine dropped a number of sections and was renamed ''Field Artillery'' in 1987.As part of the cost-saving measures of [[Base Realignment and Closure]], several branch professional magazines were directed to merge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hollis |first=Patrecia Slayden |year=2007 |url=http://sill-www.army.mil/firesbulletin/archives/2007/MAR_APR_2007/MAR_APR_07_Full_Edition.pdf |title=Editor's Bully Pulpit |pages=37–40 |work=Field Artillery}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Field Artillery'' ceased publication with its final edition of March–April 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Zabecki |first=David T. |author2=Hollis, Patrecia Slayden |title=Field Artillery Magazine: Pointing the Way to the Future |work=Field Artillery |year=2007 |pages=4–10 |url=http://sill-www.army.mil/firesbulletin/archives/2007/MAR_APR_2007/MAR_APR_07_Full_Edition.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The successor is ''Fires'', a merger of ''Field Artillery'' and ''Air Defense Artillery'' magazines.

Sir '''Hans Rausing''', [[Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire|KBE]]&lt;ref name=Forbes /&gt; (born 25 March 1926) is a Swedish businessman based in the [[United Kingdom]]. He made his fortune from his co-inheritance of [[Tetra Pak]], a company founded by his father [[Ruben Rausing]] and currently the largest [[food packaging]] company in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Yang Ning, [http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/cndy/2011-06/20/content_12732084.htm "Creating a Benchmark for Recycling Rubbish"], ''China Daily'', 20 June 2011, retrieved 7 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.packagingeurope.com/Packaging-Europe-News/44268/Tetra-Pak-launches-nextgeneration-cheese-production-unit.html "Tetra Pak launches next generation cheese production unit"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924063133/http://www.packagingeurope.com/Packaging-Europe-News/44268/Tetra-Pak-launches-nextgeneration-cheese-production-unit.html |date=24 September 2015 }}, ''Packaging Europe News'', 11 November 2011, retrieved 11 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Forbes]] world fortune ranking, Rausing was placed at number 83 with an estimated fortune of [[United States dollar|$US]]10 billion in 2011. According to Forbes, he was the second richest Swedish billionaire in 2013. {{As of|2016|07}}, Forbes reported his net worth as $12.5 billion.&lt;ref name=Forbes /&gt; {{As of|2013|05|17}}, ''Bloomberg Billionaires Index'' estimated Rausing's net worth to be $13.3 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/profile/hans-rausing/ Forbes Billionaires Sweden 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Rausing was born in [[Gothenburg]] in 1926 as the second son to industrialist [[Ruben Rausing]] and his wife Elisabeth (née Varenius). Rausing had two brothers, [[Gad Rausing|Gad]] and Sven.

==Career==
Rausing studied Economics, Statistics and Russian at [[Lund University]], graduating in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Leander, Lars, ''Tetra Pak. A Vision Becomes Reality. A company history with a difference'', Lund: Tetra Pak International, 1996 ({{ISBN|91-630-4789-6}}), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954 Rausing was appointed Managing Director of Tetra Pak and his brother Gad Deputy Managing Director.&lt;ref name=Leander29&gt;Leander (1996), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Rausing became Chairman of the Tetra Pak board in 1985.&lt;ref name=Leander29 /&gt; He left the company in 1993 and sold his 50% share of the company to Gad in 1995.&lt;ref name=Ingram&gt;Frederick C.

Encyclopedia.com, retrieved 22 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tetra Pak's success in the 1970s and 1980s has been credited to the leadership of Hans and Gad Rausing, who turned the six-person family business into a multi-national company.&lt;ref name=Ingram /&gt; Over the course of his career, Rausing became a specialist in Russian affairs and has made many investments in Russia and Ukraine. He was responsible for the Tetra Pak's Russian market, and negotiated the first Tetra Pak machine export to the Soviet Union in 1959, eventually making Tetra Pak the largest foreign employer in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb4779/is_12/ai_n28975205/pg_3/?tag=content;col1 Hans Rausing] European Business Forum, retrieved 4 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Companies law}}
'''Incorporation (Inc.)''' is the formation of a new corporation (a corporation being a legal entity that is effectively [[corporate personhood|recognized as a person under the law]]). The corporation may be a [[business]], a [[nonprofit organization]], [[sports club]], or a [[government]] of a new [[city]] or [[town]]. This article focuses on the process of incorporation; see also [[corporation|Corporation]] (Corp.).

==USA==

===Certificate of Inc. (requirements)===
The information required differ in different states. However, there are some common information that are asked by almost all the states and so, must be incl. in the Certificate of Inc., accordingly. They are as follows:
*'''Business purpose''' – It would describe the incorporated tasks a Company (Co.) has to do or provide. At present, only two types of business purpose clauses are used. They are:

# General – General purpose clauses are accepted by some and not all states. It indicates that the budding company has been formed to carry out "all lawful business" in the region.
# Specific – Alternatively, some states have made it mandatory for the business owners to furnish a more detailed explanation of the products and/or services to be offered by their Co..

*'''Corp. name''' – A chosen name must be added to the Certificate of Inc.. This should be followed with the corporate identifier such as "Corp.", "Inc.", "Co.". A preliminary name availability search is advisable, prior to the submission of the Articles of Inc.. In case of online incorporation, the state will have final say with regards to the name chosen for the company and that the name shouldn't deceive or mislead the consumers.
*'''Regd. agent''' – Almost all the states require every corporation to have a registered agent of their own in the state of incorporation. Registered (Regd.) agents will receive all the important legal as well as tax documents on behalf of the corporation. A typical regd. agent will need a physical address (PO box nos.) in the state of incorporation and should be accessible during normal business hours.
*'''Inc.''' – An Inc. is the person who prepares and files the Certificate of Inc. with the concerned state.
*'''Share par value''' – It refers to the stated minimum value, and generally doesn't correspond to the actual value. Usually, $00.01, $01.00 or no par are some of the common par values. In reality, the value of a share is based on its fair market value, or whatever amount a buyer is willing to pay for the same.
*'''Nr. of authorized shares of stock''' – An Inc. needs to stipulate the exact number of shares they as a company are willing to authorize. Moreover, it is mandatory for every Corp., be it small or large, to have stock. A stock represents ownership in the corporation.
*'''Directors''' – Many states need the name and addresses of the initial directors of the corporation in the incorporation papers. They are responsible for the corporation's daily affairs and oversee major corporate decisions. Directors hold an [[elected office]] as chosen by the shareholders' mandate and will be responsible to appoint officers.
*'''Preferred shares''' – If a Co./Corp. is willing to permit both [[preferred stock|preferred]] as well as [[common stock|common shares]] of stock, then this should have a mention in the Articles of Incorporation, along with the voting rights information. Generally, preferred shares provide its shareholders preferential payments of distribution of assets or dividends, in case the company shuts down its operations. A lot of small business owners only allow shares of common stock. 
*'''Officers''' – Officers include president, vice president, secretary and treasurer have the responsibility towards the daily activities of the Corp.. Certain states require that officer information be included, while others have kept it optional.
*'''Legal address of the Co./Corp.''' – In many states, it is optional to provide the legal or principal business address. But in some states it is mandatory.

===Legal benefits===
*'''Protection of personal assets''' – One of the most important legal benefits is the safeguarding of personal assets against the claims of creditors and lawsuits. Sole proprietors and general partners in a [[partnership]] are personally and jointly responsible for all the [[legal liability|Legal Liability]] (LL) of a business such as loans, accounts payable, and legal judgments. In a corporation, however, [[stockholders]], [[board of directors|directors]] and [[Chief executive officer|officers]] typically are not liable for the company's debts and obligations. They are limited in liability to the amount they have invested in the corporation. For example, if a shareholder purchased $100 in stock, no more than $100.00 can be lost. Corporation (Corp.) and [[limited liability company|Limited Liability Company]] (LLC) may hold assets such as real estate, cars or boats. If a shareholder of a corporation is personally involved in a lawsuit or [[bankruptcy]], these assets may be protected. A creditor of a shareholder of a Corp. or LLC cannot seize the assets of the company. However, the creditor can seize ownership shares in the corporation, as they are considered a personal asset.
*'''Transferable ownership''' – Ownership in a Corp. or LLC is easily transferable to others, either in whole or in part. Some state laws are particularly corporate-friendly. For example, the transfer of ownership in a corporation incorporated in [[Delaware corporation|US-DE]] is not required to be filed or recorded. 
*'''Retirement funds''' – Retirement funds and qualified retirements plans, such as a [[401(k)]], may be established more easily.
*'''Taxation''' – In USA, Corp. are [[tax]]ed at a lower rate than individuals are. Also, they can own shares in other corporations and receive corporate dividends 80% tax-free. There are no limits on the amount of losses a corporation may carry forward to subsequent tax years. A sole proprietorship, on the other hand, cannot claim a capital loss greater than $3,000.00 unless the owner has offsetting capital gains.
*'''Raising funds through sale of stock'''. A Corp. can easily raise capital from investors through the sale of stock.
*'''Durability''' – A corporation is capable of continuing indefinitely. Its existence is not affected by the death of shareholders, directors, or officers of the corporation.
*'''Credit rating''' – Regardless of an owner's personal [[credit score]]s, a corporation can acquire its own [[credit rating]], and build a separate credit history by applying for and using corporate credit.

===Legal history===
Am. opinion of corporations has evolved significantly throughout history, and [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] cases provide a means to observe this evolution. While these cases may seem arbitrary and decontextualized when examined individually, when viewed successively and within historical context, a narrative emerges that offers an explanation for why such views are upheld.

====''Dartmouth College v. Woodward'', 1819====
1816 the [[New Hampshire]] state legislature passed a bill that would turn privately owned [[Dartmouth College]] into a publicly owned university with a Board of Trustees appointed by the governor.&lt;ref&gt;''Dartmouth College v. Woodward'', 1819&lt;/ref&gt; The board filed a suit challenging the constitutionality of the legislature. The suit alleged the college enjoyed the right to contract and the government changing that contract was not allowed. Chief Justice John Marshall delivered the majority opinion and affirmed that the right to contract exists between owners of private property rather than between a government and its citizens. The case was the first case in US history that asked fundamental questions about corporate entities and the protections they enjoy; it also was a precedent-setting case in extending "individual rights" to corporations.

====''Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad'', 1886====
The railroad was an expensive multi-year project that greatly changed and altered both the physical and commercial landscape of the country. As with most new technology developments that have a broad impact, there are disputes about how those technologies and the businesses they thrive in fit under the umbrella of laws that govern regulations and taxation. In 1886 one such taxation dispute arose between [[Santa Clara County]] and [[Southern Pacific Railroad]].&lt;ref&gt;''Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad'', 1886&lt;/ref&gt; The railroad thought the tax code was misapplied to some of their property and assets. In deciding the case, a unanimous court ruled that governments must abide by the same tax code enforcement for individuals that it did for corporations. While not explicitly stated in the case, it was implied that this case extended equal protection rights to corporations under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th amendment]].

====''Liggett v. Lee'', 1933====
The booming economy the railroad corporations helped build from the late 19th into the early 20th centuries came to a screeching halt in 1929. [[The Great Depression]], as it came to be known, helped a view of corporations emerge that put them at odds with the normal working man. The election of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] was a manifestation of many populist sentiments the country might have felt. In 1933 a [[Florida]] case came before the court, again disputing taxation.&lt;ref&gt;''Liggett v. Lee'', 1933&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Louis K. Liggett Co. v. Lee|''Liggett v. Lee'']] the court ruled that there could be a corporate tax, essentially saying the structure of business was a justifiably discriminatory criterion for governments to consider when writing tax legislation. This was a unique ruling handed down during a unique time in US history that denied a corporation freedom it sought in the courtroom.

====''First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti'', 1978====
From 1940 to 1990 the percent of total [[GDP]] made up by financial service professionals increased by 300%.&lt;ref&gt;Cracks in the Pipeline Part One: Restoring Efficiency to Wall Street and Value to Main Street&lt;/ref&gt; Along with that growth there was a growth in the profits this industry experienced as well. As the disposable income of banks and other financial institutions rose, they sought a way to use it to influence politics and policy. In response, [[Massachusetts]] passed a law limiting corporate donations strictly to issues related to their industry.&lt;ref&gt;''Bank of Boston v. Belloti'', 1978&lt;/ref&gt; The [[First National Bank of Boston]] challenged the law on First Amendment grounds and won. ''[[First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti]]'' allowed business to use financial speech in political causes of any nature.

====''Citizens United v. FEC'', 2010====
In 2010 amidst an outpouring of frustration and blame directed at [[Wall Street]] the issue of corporate contributions came before the court again.&lt;ref&gt;''Citizens United v. FEC'', 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Citizens United v. FEC]]'' the court said there was virtually no distinction between monetary contributions and political speech, and because we do not limit political speech unless it is tantamount to bribery, corporations have the right as people to donate unlimited amounts of money to any political cause so long as it is not to a direct campaign.

===Steps required for incorporation===
The '''[[articles of incorporation]]''' (also called a [[charter]], [[certificate of incorporation]] or [[letters patent]]) are filed with the appropriate state office, listing the purpose of the corporation, its principal place of business and the number and type of shares of stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lawserver.com/maps/state-corporation-departments |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211035539/https://www.lawserver.com/maps/state-corporation-departments|title=State Corporation Departments: Interactive Map :: LawServer|archivedate=2013-02-11|date=2013-02-11|access-date=2017-11-01||work=LawServer}}&lt;/ref&gt; A registration fee is due, which is usually between $25 and $1,000, depending on the state.

A corporate name is generally made up of three parts: "distinctive element", "descriptive element", and a legal ending. All corporations must have a distinctive element, and in most filing jurisdictions, a legal ending to their names. Some corporations choose not to have a descriptive element. In the name "Tiger Computers, Inc.", the word "Tiger" is the distinctive element; the word "Computers" is the descriptive element; and the "Inc." is the legal ending. The legal ending indicates that it is in fact a [[legal corporation]] and not just a [[business License|business registration]] or [[partnership]]. Incorporated, [[limited company|limited]], and corporation, or their respective abbreviations (Inc., Ltd., Corp.) are the possible legal endings in the US.

Usually, there are also '''[[bylaw|corporate bylaws]]''' which must be filed with the state. Bylaws outline a number of important administrative details such as when annual shareholder meetings will be held, who can vote and the manner in which shareholders will be notified if there is need for an additional "special" meeting.

===Taxation===
{{Main article|Corporate tax in the United States}}
Corporations can only deduct net operating losses going back two years and forward 20 years.

===Reporting after incorporation===
Assuming a corporation has not sold [[stock]] to the public, conducting corporate business is straightforward. Often, it amounts to recording key corporate decisions (for example, borrowing money or buying real estate) and holding an annual meeting. These formalities can often be supplanted by written agreement and do not usually need a face-to-face meeting.

==In the United Kingdom==
{{Main article|Company formation}}
In the UK, the process of incorporation is generally called company formation. The United Kingdom is one of the quickest locations to incorporate, with a fully electronic process and a very fast turnaround by the national registrar of companies, the [[Companies House]]. The current [[Companies House]] record is five minutes to vet and issue a [[certificate of incorporation]] for an electronic application.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

===Types of companies===
There are many different types of UK companies:

* [[Public limited company]] (PLC)
* [[Private company limited by shares]] (Ltd.)
* [[Company limited by guarantee]]
* [[Unlimited company]] (Unltd.)
* [[Limited liability partnership]] (LLP)
* [[Community interest company]]
* [[Industrial and provident society]] (IPS)
* [[Royal charter]] (RC)

==International perspective==
{{See also|Types of business entity}}
The legal concept of incorporation is recognized all over the world.

* In the United States, there are many ways that a corporation can be identified. The four forms that are valid in all 50 states and the District of Columbia are "Corporation", "Incorporated", and the abbreviations "Corp." and "Inc." Some states allow the use of "Company" and some have additional optional names. A complete list of which names are allowed in each state can be found at [[Types of business entity#United States]].
* In [[Germany]], [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]], the [[Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung|GmbH]] ("Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung", meaning "limited liability business association"), as well as the [[Aktiengesellschaft|AG]] ("Aktiengesellschaft", meaning "business association with shares"), are the entities most similar to the corporations in the US.
* In the [[United Kingdom]], with the exception of an [[unlimited company]] or corporation which requires no designation as part of its legal company name, the titles [[Limited company|Ltd.]] (limited company) or [[Public limited company|plc]] (public limited company) are used for corporations.
* In [[France]], [[Switzerland]], [[Belgium]] and [[Luxembourg]], the term "[[Sàrl|SARL]] ({{fr}}), (société à responsibilité limitée, company with limited liability)" or [[S.A.

: Limited liability company (LLC) – A hybrid legal structure that provides the limited liability features of a corporation and the tax efficiencies and operational flexibility of a partnership.
: Corporation – A legal entity owned by shareholders.
: Non-profit – An organization engaged in activities of public or private interest where making a profit is not a primary mission. Some non-profits are exempt from federal taxes.
* [[Singapore]] uses Pte.

* In [[Canada]], the process of incorporation can be done either at the federal or provincial level. Companies which incorporate with the federal government will generally need to register extra-provincially in the province that they elect to do business. Similarly, a provincial corporation may need to register extra-provincially if they are to have offices outside of their home province. Incorporations are effected quite quickly, depending upon the jurisdiction of registration, as several provinces and the federal government have started to allow for electronic filing. Incorporated Canadian companies can generally use either Limited, Incorporated or Corporation in their name, but this may vary from province to province.
* [[Dubai]] uses "LLC" to denote a limited liability company. Listed companies use "PJSC" to denote a public joint stock company.
* In [[Turkey]], Ltd. Şti. (which stands for ''Limited Şirketi'') is a common form to denote limited liability companies.

ISI was founded in 1953 by [[Frank Chodorov]] with [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]] as its first president.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt; The organization sponsors lectures and debates on college campuses, publishes books and journals, provides funding and editorial assistance to a network of conservative and libertarian college newspapers, and finances graduate fellowships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wood|first1=Kate|last2=Binder|first2=Amy|title=Becoming Right: How Campuses Shape Young Conservatives|date=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0691145377|pages=104–111|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1nkZy0ikBGwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=becoming+right:+how+colleges+shape+young+conservatives#v=onepage&amp;q=becoming%20right%3A%20how%20colleges%20shape%20young%20conservatives&amp;f=false|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1953, [[Frank Chodorov]] founded ISI as the Intercollegiate Society of Individualists, with a young [[Yale University]] graduate [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]] as president.&lt;ref name="peele"&gt;Gillian Peele, 'American Conservatism in Historical Perspective', in ''Crisis of Conservatism? The Republican Party, the Conservative Movement, &amp; American Politics After Bush'', Gillian Peele, Joel D. Aberbach (eds.), Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]], 2011, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; [[E. Victor Milione]], ISI's next and longest-serving president, established publications, a membership network, a lecture and conference program, and a graduate fellowship program.

ISI has been teaching various forms of intellectual conservatism on college campuses ever since.&lt;ref name=nytimes-young-hipublicans&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/25/magazine/armies-of-the-right-the-young-hipublicans.html?smid=pl-share New York Times, ARMIES OF THE RIGHT; The Young Hipublicans]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Past ISI president and former Reagan administration official [[T. Kenneth Cribb]] led the institute from 1989 until 2011, when current president Christopher G. Long took over. Cribb is credited with expanding ISI's revenue from one million dollars that year to $13,636,005 in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mediatransparency.org/recipientprofile.php?recipientID=177 Intercollegiate Institute, Inc.] MediaTransparency.org. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011081519/http://mediatransparency.org/recipientprofile.php?recipientID=177 |date=October 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs and activities==
ISI runs a number of programs on college campuses, including student societies and student papers. The organization also hosts academic-style conferences for undergraduates at various locations across the U.S.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Intercollegiate Studies Institute Student's Guide Multi-volume set.jpg|thumb|120px|ISI introduces the major disciplines through a series of Student's Guides.]] --&gt;
In providing what ISI calls a [[classically liberal]] education to its member students, ISI runs other programs as well. It publishes a number of "Student's Guide to..." books, for example ''A Student's Guide to Liberal Learning'', providing a classical introduction into several disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://isi.org/books/bookdetail.aspx?id=c4130aec-1f9a-4b8b-9668-5a326493eba1 Student's Guide to the major disciplines] Intercollegiate Studies Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;{{third-party-inline|date=March 2015}} It also holds other events, such as conferences, that feature prominent [[Conservatism|conservative]] speakers and academics, and provides funding for students to attend these conferences. In this funding capacity ISI is affiliated with the Liberty Fund.

In the summer of 2005, ISI Books, the imprint of ISI, published ''[[It Takes a Family|It Takes a Family: Conservatism and the Common Good]]'', by Pennsylvania Republican Senator [[Rick Santorum]], which premiered at #13 on the [[New York Times Best Seller list]]. Passages from the book generated controversy during [[United States Senate election in Pennsylvania, 2006|Santorum's 2006 reelection campaign]], as well as during [[Rick Santorum presidential campaign, 2012|his 2012 presidential campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/03/rick-santorum-was-warned-that-2005-book-could-become-fodder-for-political-attacks/|title=Rick Santorum Was Warned That 2005 Book Could Become Fodder For Political Attacks|publisher=[[ABC News]]|date=March 17, 2012|first=Michael|last=Falcone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISI administers the [[Collegiate Network]], which provides editorial and financial outreach to conservative and libertarian student journalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beer|first1=Jeremy|last2=Jeffrey|first2=Nelson|last3=Frohnen|first3=Bruce|title=American Conservatism: An Encyclopedia|date=May 20, 2014|publisher=Open Road Media|isbn=1497651573|url=https://books.google.com/?id=T1yOAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT263&amp;dq=collegiate+network#v=onepage&amp;q=collegiate%20network&amp;f=false|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall of 2006, ISI published the findings of its survey of the teaching of America's history and institutions in higher education. The Institute reported, as the title suggests, that there is a "coming crisis in citizenship."&lt;ref name=chronicle-graduates-flunk&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Most-College-Graduates-Flun/1357/|title=Most College Graduates Flunk 'Civic Literacy,' Group Says|work=The Chronicle of Higher Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chronicle-more-liberal&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/article/College-Makes-Students-More/64040|title=College Makes Students More Liberal, but Not Smarter About Civics|work=The Chronicle of Higher Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify inline|date=March 2015}}

==ISI Books==
Intercollegiate Studies Institute operates ISI Books, which publishes books on conservative issues and distributes a number of books from other publishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.isi.org/books/| title=ISI Books | publisher=Intercollegiate Studies Institute |year= 2008 | first= | last=    | accessdate =2008-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Focus is largely on the humanities and the foundations of Western culture and its challenge by radical left-wing [[progressivism]].

'''Jay B. Barney''' is an American professor in [[strategic management]], best known for his contributions to the resource-based theory of [[competitive advantage]].

==Early life and education==
Jay Barney was born in [[Walnut Creek, California]] on October 8, 1954.  He spent his formative years in San Bruno, California and graduated from [[San Carlos High School]] in San Carlos, California in 1972.  He attended [[Brigham Young University]] in Provo, Utah where he majored in Sociology.  He graduated from BYU, summa cum laude, in December 1974 and began the Ph.D. program in Sociology at [[Yale University]] in New Haven, Connecticut in 1976.  By 1978, he had created a special joint Ph.D. degree in Sociology and Administrative Sciences at Yale.  He finished this degree in 1982.

==Career==
Barney joined the faculty at the Anderson Graduate School of Management at UCLA in 1980, moved to the Mays Business School at [[Texas A&amp;M University]] in 1986, to the Fisher College of Business at the [[Ohio State University]] in 1994—where he held the Chase Chair for Excellence in Corporate Strategy, and to the Eccles School of Business at the University of Utah in 2012—where he held the rank of Presidential Professor and the Lassonde Chair in Social Entrepreneurship.

Barney is best known for his contributions to the resource-based theory of competitive advantage in the field of strategic management [[Resource-based View]]. The field of strategic management focuses on explaining why some firms outperform others. Research in this field was changed dramatically with the introduction of concepts from micro-economics by Michael Porter in 1979 and 1908[1]  Building on the work of Joe Bain [2], Professor Porter developed tools for analyzing the competitive threats in an industry.  Operationalized in his famous "five forces framework," [[Porter's Five Forces]] Professor Porter's work could be used to explain why firms in some industries outperformed firms in other industries.

However, there is often substantial variance in the performance of firms within the same industry.  For example, both Wal-Mart and Kmart operate in the discount retail industry, and yet Wal-Mart became one of the largest firms in the world, while at the same time, Kmart struggled with bankruptcy.  A theory that used the structure of competition in an industry—such as Professor Porter's theory—had little to say about such intra-industry variation in firm performance.  Resource-based theory is designed to address this problem.

The main tenants of resource-based theory were developed in a series of articles by Professors Richard Rumelt [3], [[Birger Wernerfelt]] [4],  Jay Barney [5], and Margie Peteraf [6].  However, the theory grew in popularity and influence when Professor Barney published a paper on the resource-based view in 1991.[7]  This paper has become one of the most cited papers in the field of strategic management.

The central assumptions of resource-based theory are (1) that firms can vary in their resources and capabilities, and (2) that these differences can last over time.  The reason differences in resources and capabilities can be stable often has to do with the nature of some of these resources and capabilities—their path dependence [8], their causal ambiguity [9], their tacitness [10], and so forth.  These characteristics of resources and capabilities may create information asymmetries between firms that possess them and those that do not.  These information asymmetries may make it costly for firms without certain resources and capabilities to imitate them.  In addition, imitation can be costly—even if information asymmetries do not exit—because of these resource characteristics.  For example, a disadvantage firm may know, with certainty, that its competitor's success is due to its organizational culture—an example of a socially complex resource of capability—and not be able to change its own culture to imitate this successful culture.

Professor Barney's 1991 paper developed a simple framework for distinguishing among several different types of firm performance—i.e., competitive disadvantage, competitive parity, temporary competitive advantage, and sustained competitive advantage [[competitive advantage]]—and identified the attributes of resources and capabilities that would make them costly to imitate.  This framework has come to be known as the VRIO (Valuable, Rare, Costly to Imitate, and exploited by Organization).  Resources that do not increase a firm's revenues or decrease its costs as not valuable, and are a source of competitive disadvantage.  Resources that are valuable but not rare are a source of competitive parity.  Resources that are valuable and rare can be a source of temporary competitive advantage.  Resources that are valuable, rare, and costly to imitate can be a source of sustained competitive advantage.  Organization acts like an adjustment factor in this theory—enabling firms that should only have competitive parity to gain high level performance from their resources or leading firms with potentially higher levels of performance to lose that performance because they are poorly organized.

Resource-based theory dominated research in the field of strategic management from the early 1990s through 2015.  It has also influenced a variety of other fields, including human resource management[12], information technology [13]; supply chain management [14]; and others.

In the mid-2000s, Professor {{when|date=May 2016}} Barney worked with Dr. Sharon Alvarez to develop a new theoretical approach to the study of entrepreneurship.  Rather than assuming that entrepreneurial opportunities are formed by exogenous shocks to established markets or industries, this approach suggests that opportunities can also be endogenous to entrepreneurial action [15].  By 2015, this "creation view" of entrepreneurship was beginning to gain traction among entrepreneurship scholars.

Research topics that build directly on resource-based theory include [[The Knowledge based Theory of the Firm]], [[Relational View]], [[Dynamic Capabilities]], theories of [[core competence]], and [[competitive heterogeneity]].

==Biography==
Joe Harris was born on January 5, 1928, in [[Jersey City, New Jersey]], to Gladys ([[née]] Golden) and Charlie Harris.&lt;ref name=nybj/&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; He enlisted and served in both the [[United States Navy]] and the [[United States Marine Corps]].&lt;ref name=nybj/&gt; He graduated from the [[Pratt Institute]] in [[Brooklyn, New York]].&lt;ref name=nybj/&gt;

Harris joined the staff of the New York City-based ad agency [[Dancer Fitzgerald Sample]] as a [[Copywriting|copywriter]] shortly after graduating from Pratt.&lt;ref name=nybj/&gt; In 1954, one of Dancer Fitzgerald Sample's clients, General Mills, introduced Trix cereal as a sugar-coated version of its popular brand, [[Kix (cereal)|Kix]].&lt;ref name=cr/&gt; The company experimented with a puppet rabbit for Trix commercials as early as 1955.&lt;ref name=nybj/&gt; However, Harris, then an illustrator and copywriter for Dancer Fitzgerald Sample, created the cereal's now iconic animated mascot, the Trix rabbit, who debuted in television commercials in 1959.&lt;ref name=nybj/&gt; Harris also conceived the Trix commercial's tagline, "Silly rabbit! Trix are for kids", utilized as the foil whenever children stop the rabbit from stealing Trix cereal.&lt;ref name=nybj/&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; Harris' tagline, and his famous Trix rabbit, are still used in General Mills' Trix campaign fifty years after its first commercial.&lt;ref name=nybj/&gt;

Chet Stover, who managed the General Mills' Trix account for Dancer Fitzgerald Sample, fully credited Harris with creating the Trix rabbit in an internal memo to the company, writing, "In a business where the only thing we have to sell are ideas, it is of first importance the credit is given where credit belongs — and Joe gets all the credit for this one."&lt;ref name=nybj/&gt;

In 1959, Harris joined with several Dancer Fitzgerald Sample colleagues, including Stover and [[W. Watts Biggers]], to co-found [[Total Television]], which produced [[Saturday morning cartoon]]s.&lt;ref name=nybj/&gt; Harris personally created several of Total Television's iconic cartoon characters, most famously Underdog, the dog superhero and star of the 1960s animated series, ''[[Underdog (TV series)|Underdog]]''.&lt;ref name=nybj/&gt; Harris' also designed other notable creations, including  King Leonardo, Klondike Kat and Tennessee Tuxedo.&lt;ref name=nybj/&gt; Additionally, Harris drew the storyboards for Total Television's animated shows, while Stover and Biggers, a Dancer Fitzgerald Sample account manager, wrote penned the scripts for the episodes.&lt;ref name=nybj/&gt;

Harris returned to the advertising industry after Total Television folded in 1969.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; He also penned and illustrated several [[children's books]], including "The Belly Book."&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

Harris died at his home in [[Stamford, Connecticut]], on March 26, 2017, at the age of 89.&lt;ref name=nybj/&gt; His first wife, Janet Opel, died in 1981, while his second wife, Vanessa Campbell, died in 2002.&lt;ref name=nybj/&gt; He was survived by three daughters, Merrie Harris, Joelle Malec, and Sophie Harris; three grandchildren, and his stepbrother, David.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

John Lee Carroll was also a great-grandson of Maryland's second (and seventh) [[Governor of Maryland]], [[Thomas Sim Lee]], (1745–1819).&lt;ref name=msa&gt;{{cite web |url=http://msa.maryland.gov/megafile/msa/speccol/sc3500/sc3520/001400/001468/html/1468extbio.html |title=John Lee Carroll (1830–1911) |publisher=Maryland State Archives |date=March 14, 2001 |accessdate=September 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of ten, in 1840, Carroll was sent to [[Mount St. Mary's University|Mount Saint Mary's College]] in [[Frederick County, Maryland|Frederick County's]] [[Emmitsburg, Maryland|Emmitsburg]], where he remained for two years. After leaving he attended [[Georgetown University]] in [[Georgetown, D.C.|Georgetown]], near [[Washington, D.C.]], and then the secular part of [[St. Mary's Seminary and University|St. Mary's College]], on North Paca Street in [[Baltimore]], for another three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CPsMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA215&amp;lpg=PA215 |title=Governors of Maryland: from the revolution to the year 1908 |page=215 |last=Buchholz |first=Heinrich Ewald |publisher=Williams &amp; Wilkins |year=1908 |edition=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carroll then decided to enter the legal profession, and attended [[Harvard Law School]] of [[Harvard College]], (now [[Harvard University]]), in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], adjacent to [[Boston]] for two terms.

==Career==

After finishing schooling, Carroll worked as a student lawyer for the law office of Brown and Brune in Baltimore. He was admitted to the bar in 1851. Carroll practiced law in [[Maryland]] from 1854 until 1858. He ran as a [[Howard County, Maryland|Howard County]] Democratic candidate for the state [[Maryland General Assembly|General Assembly]] in 1854, (shortly after the separation of the former Howard or Western District of [[Anne Arundel County]] and the "erection"/establishment of [[Howard County, Maryland|Howard]] as the 22nd of the state's 23 counties), however losing to his opponent from the newly-dominant "[[Know Nothing]]" Party (also known as the American Party) during the political crises of the 1850s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Grand River Times|date=October 17, 1855}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carroll then moved to [[New York City]] and while there, accepted a position as deputy clerk and United States [[Commissioner]] in the office of the clerk of the [[United States district court|United States District Court]]. He stayed there until 1861, at the outbreak of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], when he returned to Maryland, where he then remained the rest of his life.  When he returned to Maryland, Carroll purchased the "[[Doughoregan Manor]]", historic family estate in [[Howard County, Maryland|Howard County]], near [[Ellicott City, Maryland|Ellicott City]] from his older brother Charles Carroll.

Carroll was elected into the [[Maryland Senate|Maryland State Senate]] of the [[Maryland General Assembly|General Assembly of Maryland]] in 1867 and served two terms. He was elected [[President of the Senate|President of the State Senate]] in 1874.

In 1875, Carroll became the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] nominee for [[Governor of Maryland]], opposed by [[James Morrison Harris]]. He won by a 10,000-vote majority and was inaugurated as governor on January 12, 1876.

===Strikes and unrest in 1877===
{{main|Baltimore railroad strike of 1877}}
The [[Great Railroad Strike of 1877]] began with a sudden cut in wages by the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad|B. &amp; O. Railroad's]] Board of Directors and President [[John Work Garrett]], which caused workers to walk off the job in [[Martinsburg, West Virginia]], and spread nationwide to the rest of the B. &amp; O., as well as several other lines.  Governor Carroll called up the 5th and 6th Regiments of the [[Maryland National Guard]] to stop railroad workers from striking in [[Cumberland, Maryland|Cumberland]], [[Hagerstown, Maryland|Hagerstown]] and in [[Frederick County, Maryland|Frederick County's]] shops and roundhouses at [[Brunswick, Maryland|Brunswick]].  Once the news spread by telegraph east, it touched off riots in [[Baltimore]] at the [[Mount Clare Shops]] and the yards at the B. &amp; O.'s [[Camden Station|Camden Street Station]], headquarters of the line.

The [[Maryland Army National Guard|National Guard]] attempted to march from their armories to [[Camden Station]]—the [[5th Maryland Regiment|Fifth Regiment]] from the armory in the assembly hall above the Richmond Market along North Howard Street in the northwest city, and the [[175th Infantry Regiment (United States)|Sixth]] from their armory at North Front and East Fayette Streets, near [[Jonestown, Baltimore|Jonestown/Old Town]]. The Fifth marched south down Howard Street and the Sixth attempted to march south on Front Street along the east bank of the [[Jones Falls]] for a few blocks then west on East Baltimore Street, through the middle of the downtown business district (and avoided the obvious associations of marching along the waterfront of Pratt Street, as the [[6th Massachusetts Regiment]] did 16 years before, with its [[Baltimore riot of 1861|tragic memories]]). Despite this precaution, each regiment had to again literally fight its way through the streets of the city, attacked by projectiles, rocks and angry mobs the entire way. Conflict gripped the city and Governor Carroll was powerless to stem the tide. Later, additional reinforcements of Federal troops were called in by newly elected 18th President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] to restore order in Baltimore.&lt;ref name="scharf"&gt;{{cite book |last=Scharf|first=John Thomas|title=History of Maryland From the Earliest Period to the Present Day |publisher=Tradition Press |year=1967 |origyear=1879 |location=Hatboro, PA |volume=2 |pages=733–42 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=9IEjAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later career===
In later years, Governor Carroll served on the [[Howard County Public School System|Howard County Board of Education]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Archives of Maryland Manual |volume=154|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; and served in 1883 on an early grand jury that used both Caucasian and African American members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=March 21, 1883}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Governor was also a member of the District of Columbia Society of the [[Sons of the Revolution]].

'''Kaare Frydenberg''' (born 30 April 1950) is a Norwegian businessperson.

==Education and early career==
He was born at [[Bærum Hospital]], graduated from upper secondary school at [[Nadderud Upper Secondary School|Nadderud]] in 1969 and attended [[Oslo Commerce School]] for one year. In 1974 he graduated from the [[Norwegian School of Management]] with a [[siviløkonom|siv.øk.]] degree.&lt;ref name=budst&gt;{{cite news|title=Arvelig belastet jurist|last=Byles|first=Anine G.|date=15 April 2010|work=[[Budstikka]]|pages=62–63|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He started his career in the media. He was assisting director of the newspaper ''[[Aftenposten]]'' from 1977 to 1987, and the chief executive officer of ''[[Dagens Næringsliv]]'' from 1987 to 1989, overseeing its name change from ''Norges Handels- og Sjøfartstidende''. From 1989 to 1996 he again worked for ''Aftenposten'', first as deputy CEO, then as CEO.&lt;ref name=budst/&gt;

==Later career==
From 1996 to 2000 Frydenberg was the CEO of Pripps Ringnes,&lt;ref name=budst/&gt; an amalgamation of [[Pripps]] and [[Ringnes]] which in 2001 was bought by [[Carlsberg Group|Carlsberg Breweries]].&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=|title=Ringnes AS|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|editor=Henriksen, Petter|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/Ringnes_AS|language=Norwegian|accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2000 to 2005 he was the CEO of [[Posten Norge]], the Norwegian postal service.&lt;ref name=budst/&gt; During his time as CEO, the company went through significant changes, among others with sizeable downsizing and the integration of [[postal office]]s into [[grocery store]]s, dubbed "Post i butikk" (lit. post-in-store). The company also made moves in the market, such as the buying of smaller company [[Nor-Cargo]], to compensate for the general decline in the sending of letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=– Slutt på dramatiske nedbemanninger i Posten|agency=Norwegian News Agency|date=23 May 2005|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frydenberg was one of the best paid leaders of a Norwegian [[Government-owned corporation|state-owned company]], with a basic wage of {{NOK|2,210,000}} and total income (with bonus and other fees) of NOK 2,923,738 in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Avslutter med tre mill.|last=|first=|date=14 April 2005|work=Dagens Næringsliv|page=4|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the partially state-owned companies [[Telenor]], [[Norsk Hydro]], [[DnB NOR]] and [[Statoil]] are excluded, Frydenberg emerged as the best paid leader of a fully state-owned company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lønnsfyrstene i statlige selskaper|last=|first=|date=10 May 2005|work=Dagsavisen|page=8|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Right below Frydenberg was [[Bård Mikkelsen]] of [[Statkraft]], [[Kjell Pedersen]] of [[Petoro]], and [[John G. Bernander]] of the [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]].&lt;ref name=post&gt;{{cite news|title=Postmann Kaare på toppen|last=Syversen|first=Atle|date=7 October 2004|work=Aftenposten|page=|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 Frydenberg started working as a partner in Saga Corporate Management. In this job, he has been loaned out to companies that need a temporary business executive.&lt;ref name=budst/&gt; The best-known job since 2005 has been CEO of Scandinavian Property Development (SPDE). The company ventured into selling property at [[Fornebu]], but the actual development was very slow. The company struggled with slim income and high loans. Frydenberg was brought in to replace the fired CEO Stein Haugbro on 1 September 2008, and resigned in March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ba om tid – ble sendt på dør|last=Nygaard|first=Lars-Erik|date=22 August 2008|work=Dagens Næringsliv|page=16|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Går på dagen|last=Aartun|first=Jorun Sofie F.|date=18 March 2009|work=Dagens Næringsliv|page=19|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frydenberg has also been chairman of [[ErgoGroup]],&lt;ref name=post/&gt; [[Arcus (company)|Arcus]], [[Budstikka|Asker og Bærums Budstikke]], [[Dinamo Forlag]], [[Hotel Continental, Oslo]] and [[NKI Fjernundervisning|NKI-gruppen]], and a board member of ''Dagens Næringsliv''.&lt;ref name=budst/&gt;

He is married and has two children, and resides at [[Bekkestua]].&lt;ref name=budst/&gt;

Miura was born in [[Yamanashi Prefecture]] in 1947. After dropping out of a high school in Yokohama, he was arrested for [[arson]] and served some years in a juvenile prison. He was suspected of the 1979 killing of his former lover Chizuko Shiraishi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saipantribune.com/newsstory.aspx?cat=1&amp;newsID=80746|title='Unidentified dead woman found in '79 was Miura's missing GF'|publisher=Saipan Tribune|date=2008-06-10|accessdate=2008-10-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928095505/http://www.saipantribune.com/newsstory.aspx?cat=1&amp;newsID=80746|archivedate=2011-09-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/asia/la-me-oldermiura,0,4897275.story |title=From the archives: Japanese arrest mate of woman mortally shot on L.A. street |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=1985-10-11 |accessdate=2008-10-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017205808/http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/asia/la-me-oldermiura%2C0%2C4897275.story |archivedate=October 17, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Attack on Kazumi Miura ==
Miura, a clothing importer who often traveled to the [[United States]], was suspected of conspiring to kill his wife, {{nihongo|Kazumi Miura|三浦 一美|Miura Kazumi}} on November 18, 1981, while visiting [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], [[United States]]. On that day an unknown assailant shot Miura in the right leg and his wife in the head while the two were in a [[Downtown Los Angeles]] parking lot. After the shooting, Kazumi Miura remained in a coma. She was flown back to Japan via a [[United States Air Force|US Air Force]] hospital jet. She was blind, paralyzed, unconscious and subsisting on life-support machinery. She died almost a year to the day after the shooting. Kazumi Miura was the mother of a 13-month-old child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/los_angeles_metro/la-me-miuri31mar31,0,5730726.story?page=1|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130127174741/http://www.latimes.com/news/local/los_angeles_metro/la-me-miuri31mar31,0,5730726.story?page=1|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-01-27|title=Man Is Convicted in Japan of L.A. Murder|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=1994-03-31|accessdate=2008-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miura said that street robbers killed his wife, and, while in the hospital, campaigned against violence in Los Angeles. Miura said that he would write letters to [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Governor of California|California governor]] [[Jerry Brown]] and ask the two to secure Los Angeles.  The incident reinforced Japanese [[stereotype]]s about U.S. violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7261477.stm|title=Man held over wife's 1981 murder|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=2008-02-24|accessdate=2008-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arrest and trial in Japan ==
In 1984, the Japanese magazine ''Shūkan Bunshun'' published articles which indicated Miura had been involved in the killing of his wife. The articles revealed that he took out a [[life insurance]] policy on his wife worth the equivalent of [[United States dollars|US$]]1.4 million. In addition, an actress, who said she was Miura's lover, said that Miura asked her to kill his wife. [[Daryl Gates]], the chief of the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] during the Miura incident, said that the department and Japanese police suspected Miura had arranged to have his wife killed.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/02/23/japan.businessman.ap/index.html?iref=newssearch  Japan businessman arrested in wife's 1981 killing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219031354/http://www.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/02/23/japan.businessman.ap/index.html?iref=newssearch |date=2008-12-19 }}."

''[[CNN]]''. February 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the shooter was never found and there was no physical evidence linking Miura to the murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20030401b2.html|title=Miura case came to define sensationalism|publisher=Japan Times|date=2003-04-01|accessdate=2008-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to then Los Angeles District Attorney [[Ira Reiner]], LAPD homicide detectives did not believe that Miura was the perpetrator, but rather that the events had been a "vicious...street crime".&lt;ref name="iht"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/02/26/america/NA-GEN-US-Japanese-Businessmans-Wife.php|title=Arrest warrant says Japanese businessman orchestrated wife's killing in Los Angeles|publisher=[[International Herald Tribune]]|date=2008-02-26|accessdate=2008-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However one officer, Jimmy Sakoda, head of the Asian Crimes Squad, did not share the homicide detectives' conclusions.  He took his concerns to Reiner who then began working with Japanese prosecutors. Reiner has stated that were it not for Sakoda's persistence the case might have been relegated to the unsolved, or [[cold case (criminology)|cold case]] files.&lt;ref name="iht"/&gt;

Miura was convicted of the murder and was sentenced to [[life imprisonment in Japan]] in 1994, upon which he promptly appealed to [[Tokyo High Court]]. After four years of deliberation, [[Tokyo High Court]] overturned the conviction and the resulting sentence, because they were not able to identify the assailant&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/california/la-me-japanese2mar02,1,140660.story |title=Miura case draws media frenzy |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=2008-03-02 |accessdate=2008-03-06 |first=Teresa |last=Watanabe |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522135609/http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/california/la-me-japanese2mar02%2C1%2C140660.story |archivedate=May 22, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus could not prove conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/feature/20080225-1331217/fe_080304_01.htm|archive-url=https://archive.is/20080314111815/http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/feature/20080225-1331217/fe_080304_01.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2008-03-14|script-title=ja:ロス疑惑「共謀罪」焦点に |language=Japanese |publisher=[[Yomiuri shimbun]]|date=2008-03-04|accessdate=2010-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chiezo"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=ロス疑惑 | encyclopedia =知恵蔵|publisher=[[Asahi shimbun]]| year = 2008 |url=http://kotobank.jp/word/%E3%83%AD%E3%82%B9%E7%96%91%E6%83%91|accessdate=2010-01-07|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the [[Supreme Court of Japan|Supreme Court]] also acquitted him of the charge, saying "high court's judgment that there is reasonable doubt that he conspired with an unidentified person to kill his late wife is reasonable."&lt;ref name="chiezo"/&gt;

Under a 2004 California law, if convicted, the time already served would be credited against any potential sentence.

== Arrest by the U.S. authorities and death ==
California authorities learned that Miura frequently visited U.S. territory on business, and waited until he made a trip to the island of [[Saipan]] in the U.S. [[Northern Mariana Islands]], where he was arrested on February 22, 2008.  In Saipan he began fighting [[extradition]] to California

A former Federal prosecutor noted that the 27 years since the crime could help Miura's defense. "Witness memories don't get better with time," she said in an interview with the [[International Herald Tribune]].&lt;ref name="iht"/&gt; Los Angeles prosecutors announced that they identified the actual sniper, though there was no move by the prosecutors to arrest the deadly sniper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knbc.com/news/17694136/detail.html|title=Japanese Man Facing Murder Charges In LA Hangs Himself|publisher=[[KNBC]]|date=2008-10-11|accessdate=2008-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legal battle to avoid getting extradited to California, which has the [[capital punishment in the United States|death penalty]], continued until late September when the [[Los Angeles Superior Court]] dropped the murder charges, due to prohibition of [[double jeopardy]], but found conspiracy charges, which do not have capital punishment, valid.

'''Leo Morandi''' (14 September 1923 &amp;ndash; 2 May 2009) was a promoter of the new post-[[World War II]] commercial [[ceramic]]s industry of [[Sassuolo]], Italy. At first he collaborated with local ceramic producers ([[Marazzi Group]]) and with Industries D'Agostino in [[Salerno]], [[Italy]]. In 1954, after selling an innovative [[patent]] to Ceramiche Marazzi ([[Bisque (pottery)|biscuit]] selection unit), he was able to initiate startup of his own equipment supply business. Leo Morandi's innovations, knowledge, and experience aided growth and advancement throughout the [[Sassuolo]] ceramic companies, which in the 1960s constituted the worldwide known ''Sassuolo tile district''.

==Impact on industry==
In particular, he used two [[electrodes]] to select the biscuit; the passage of electricity through the material showed that it was not suitable for the successive glazing.

The production chain for ceramic tiles was then mainly handcrafted and labour-intensive, but Leo Morandi's inventions started the successful automation of various units. After the initial years he was able to open a distinct efficient production unit. Morandi was a reserved man and did not like publicity. He involved his workers and customers in the improvement of his inventions and innovations.
[[File:Fiera di Modena 1959.jpg|200px|left]]
Ceramic industry equipment examples include: automated floor tile edge glaze remover, automated packaging (floor tiles where historically bound with thin iron wire, before shipment), specialized [[silk]] screen machines, the peristaltic [[pump]], the transport line, the [[hydraulic press]], [[tile]] overturning mechanism, press reception unit, and glazing applications done with disk booths. These basic tile processing elements are still in use.

Leo Morandi began exporting these proven automated Italian [[ceramic]] industry innovations to [[Spain]], allowing advancement of two primary ceramic industry clusters.

The following is a '''list of Sony Walkman products''' (but does not include cassette tape devices).

==MiniDisc Walkman==

=== NetMD ===

Sony expanded MiniDisc's possibilities with the introduction of NetMD (NetworkMD). These allowed the use of a PC to convert music from CDs or MP3s into [[ATRAC3]] format, and use a USB cable to transfer the music to the MiniDisc at a much faster rate than was possible when using a line-in cable.

The MZ-N10 was released in 2002. It was Sony's '10th Anniversary' product, released 10 years after the introduction of the MiniDisc format in 1992. The case was made from a magnesium alloy, and the unit featured a built-in [[lithium-ion battery]] which provided 24 hours of battery life. The MZ-N10 allowed music to be transferred from a PC at up to 64 times actual playback speed, not including the time required for audio re-encoding. It was also the first MD Walkman to incorporate the [[ATRAC]] DSP TYPE S codec, and is today (2006) the lightest recording MD Walkman ever produced. The accompanying 10th anniversary playback-only MiniDisc Walkman, the MZ-E10, was also released. It is the lightest MD Walkman ever produced, weighing 55&amp;nbsp;g (including built-in rechargeable battery) with a thickness of 9.9&amp;nbsp;mm.

=== Hi-MD ===

In 2004, Sony introduced the [[HiMD|Hi-MD]] format. Hi-MD Walkmans use 1&amp;nbsp;GB Hi-MD discs in the same form-factor as regular MiniDiscs, and allow 1&amp;nbsp;GB of files and/or audio to be stored per disc. They also accept regular MiniDiscs, which can be initialized in Hi-MD mode for 305&amp;nbsp;MB capacity per disc (with the added ability to store audio and data, like Hi-MD discs).

Unlike NetMD, Hi-MD Walkmans allow two-way digital transfers to and from PCs virtually unrestricted. Hi-MD also allows the option to record and transfer audio in lossless linear PCM on standard MiniDiscs and Hi-MD discs. This offers sound quality equal to CD (as opposed to lossy ATRAC codecs used on standard MiniDisc/ NetMD).

Hi-MD Walkmans introduced from 2005 onwards allowed direct playback of MP3s without the need to transcode the MP3s to ATRAC format. However, SonicStage is required for transfer onto the disc itself. Playable audio cannot be transferred to the devices without SonicStage.

==Network Walkman==

=== NW-MS7 ===
The NW-MS7 was released mid-1999 as Sony's first foray into the portable solid state music player industry. This first model shipped with a white 64MB MagicGate Memorystick and built-in battery, selling it alongside the NW-E3 (64 MB built-in and using two AAA battery for 4-5 hours playtime). The player could only play ATRAC formatted files.  The user needed to transfer songs with bundled software OpenMG Jukebox (only works with Win98SE and later known as SonicStage).  Any files not in the ATRAC format (i.e. MP3s) needed to be converted before they could be transferred and played.

=== NW-MS9/MS11 ===
The Network Walkman line was later updated with the NW-MS9/MS11.  These came bundled with either 64MB/128MB MagicGate memory sticks and used a Gumstick type battery.  Software continued to use OpenMG.

=== NW-MS70D/MS90D ===

The NW-MS70D had 256MB of built-in flash memory. It could also be expanded by its MagicGate MemoryStick Duo port. However, at the time, the Memory Stick PRO Duo had not yet been released. So therefore the NW-MS70D maximum capacity would be 384MB with the additional memory stick. The other downside to it was that it was incredibly expensive, costing as much as a 15&amp;nbsp;GB iPod. It also used a very buggy software, Sonicstage, and only played Atrac3, Atrac3plus and WAV files. However, it was the smallest digital audio player at that time. It was also solidly built with an aluminium shell. It boasted a 44-hour battery life. Despite a heavy marketing campaign, its sales were limited.

The alternate model, the NW-MS90D, used the same software as NW-MS70D, and had a maximum capacity of 640&amp;nbsp;MB.  It too was also extremely expensive. The most eminent change was the 512&amp;nbsp;MB inbuilt memory and its new black shell. Due to its price and limited capacity, it was still largely ignored by the general public.

== ATRAC HDD ==

=== NW-HD1 ===

Sony's first attempt at equalling the iPod's success was the NW-HD1, which was smaller and was advertised as having better sound quality than the iPod at the time. However, the unit would only play Sony's proprietary format, ATRAC3, whereas other players on the market would play the much more widely used MP3 format without having to be converted to ATRAC3. Sony did upgrade the HD1 to play MP3s but it still needed SonicStage to transfer the files. The NW-HD1 did not sell as well as Sony had hoped. Its successors, the NW-HD3 and NW-HD5, also failed to make a major dent in the iPod's sales.

=== NW-HD3 ===
[[File:SonyWalkmanNW-HD3.jpg|thumb|Sony Walkman NW-HD3]]

The successor to the hard disk-based NW-HD1, the NW-HD3 was a very similar design; however, despite the fact that the unit would play MP3s natively, the PC software was still buggy, and the unit was therefore equally poorly received.

=== NW-HD5 ===

Sony's next model, the NW-HD5, was an updated design from the HD1 / HD3, and boasted a simpler control system, a user-removable lithium-ion battery, better file format compatibility, a unique "Follow Turn Display" that would automatically align itself based on how the player was held on startup, and updated software. A main feature was its advertised running time of 40 hours, when using low-quality format settings, i.e., 48 kbit/s ATRAC3 files, and no player-based audio enhancements (although the player does include these). Playback of 128 kbit/s MP3s was rated at 30 hours. The player was available in black, silver and red and was not sold in the Canadian market.

Unfortunately, the NW-HD5 was shipped with a cosmetic design flaw which meant that the buttons developed small visible cracks under their plastic coating. Although this did not affect functionality, many customers complained. Sony United Kingdom Limited allowed owners to send the units back to be re-fitted with slightly raised, crack-resistant buttons. Perhaps because of this problem, the NW-HD5 was on the market for a very short time before being pulled in preparation for the next model.

In January 2006, the NW-HD5 became unavailable as a normal purchase from retail electronics stores and was relegated to online auction sites and used-electronics warehouses as a consumer item. Eventually the whole of the Network Walkman line would be discontinued for Sony's new solution.

==Walkman MP3==

=== NW-A Series ===
[[File:SonyNW-A1000V.JPG|thumb|Sony NW-A1000 6GB MP3 Player]]

The NW-A series Walkman is a digital music player available in 6 (NW-A1000), 8 (NW-A1200) and 20 gigabyte (NW-A3000) versions and features an [[electroluminescence|EL]]-technology screen. Battery life can reach 20 and 35 hours respectively. The player supports [[ATRAC3]], MP3, WMA and from firmware version 3.00 it also supports [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sony.co.uk/product/nws-a-series |title=A series (WALKMAN® MP3 &amp; MP4 video) |publisher=Sony |accessdate=4 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary means of putting music on this device is to use Sony software: SonicStage and [[Connect Player]] (now withdrawn due to too many problems). The software only works on [[Microsoft Windows]]. Other common platforms such as [[macOS]] and [[Linux]] are not supported. SonicStage has received much criticism. It is only possible to move tracks from the music player to the PC's hard drive, and thereby from one music player to another, if each device/computer is "authorized" to the user's account with the Connect Store for their country. Users from countries that do not have the Connect Store service are currently limited to one device/computer.

There are a number of features to select music according to a variety of criteria. The "Artist link" function prompts the Walkman to search, find and display similar artists in that genre. There are two new shuffle modes. By selecting "My Favourite Shuffle", the device automatically selects the 100 most listened to songs and plays them at random. The "Time Machine Shuffle" function randomly selects a year and plays all of the songs from that particular year currently held on the device. A recent firmware update (V3.00) added the "Artist Link Shuffle" function to the list of Intelligent Shuffle modes, along with a clock and calendar.

=== NW-B series ===

Released in July 2007, this was a line of 1 GB (''NWD-B103/B103F'') and 2 GB (''NWD-B105/105F'') multifunction MP3 player and voice recording function. It was the firm's first-ever MP3 player to be liberated from the SonicStage software, but it has been shorn of the ability to play back [[ATRAC]] and [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] music files.

The Auto-Transfer option allowed this Walkman to search for all the MP3 files on the PC and then copy these files directly to the Walkman. It also could record CDs directly from a Sony compatible [[Hifi]] system via USB connection without any PC (the NWD-B105 also supported [[Windows Media Audio|WMA]] files).

It also came with a three-line colour display; the voice recorder (MP3) came with bit rates of low (96 kbit/s), mid (128 kbit/s) and high. Models with the built-in FM tuner ("F") had 30 preset stations with a frequency of 87.5–108.0&amp;nbsp;MHz, with the capability to record and play FM content. The five preset equaliser also had a custom setting option.

=== NW-E Series ===
[[File:Sony Walkman NWZ-E443F face.jpg|thumb|NWZ-E443F]]
The E series was a pure [[MP3]] player without a large [[LCD]] display to play videos. It had a similar design to a [[USB]] [[flashdrive]], and it was offered in many different colors. The E020 series released in Japan featured a changeable case.

In August 2006 Sony released the '''NW-E00X''' series, filled with 512MB, 1 GB or 2 GB of flash-memory. Very compact, this Walkman offered a battery life of up to 28 hours. It had a built-in USB key for easy file transfer. The battery charge/recharge was through USB connection. It was also equipped with a bright and clear 1 line OLED display for easy navigation. Dimensions were: width 24.6mm, height 79.0mm, depth 13.6mm and weight 25.0&amp;nbsp;grams.

Supported multiple codec ATRAC (''ATRAC3 66'' kbit/s, 105 kbit/s, 132 kbit/s, ''ATRAC3plus'' 48 kbit/s, 64 kbit/s, 256 kbit/s) MP3 and WMA (and later AAC), via SonicStage 3.4 software for music management and transfers of tracks for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].

This series also worked with [[Linux]] and [[macOS|Mac]] using the [[free software]] originally called ''NW-E00X MP3 File Manager'', that eventually become in ''Symphonic'', and now ''JSymphonic''. JSymphonic is an open source, cross-platform program (that runs on any Windows/Linux/Mac machine with java 1.5 installed), that, once copied into the Walkman enables the transfer of several audio files, including MP3, to/from several flash based Walkman Series. [https://web.archive.org/web/20120723222048/http://symphonic.sourceforge.net/page.php?4 It can be downloaded from here] and is in continuous development.

In March 2007, [[Asia]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], some countries of [[Europe]] and [[Canada]] had the Walkman '''NW-E01X''' series (NW-E013, NW-E015 and NW-E016) a small USB flash player. Weighing only 23&amp;nbsp;g, the NW-E01X was available in capacities from 1 to 4&amp;nbsp;GB and came in five colors: pink, violet, teal, black, and gold. Its features included a rechargeable lithium-ion battery, built-in FM tuner, a three-line color OLED display, calendar and time function, and Clear Stereo and Clear Bass technologies to enhance the audio quality. A release date and pricing for the NW-E01X in the [[United States]] was also unknown.

The '''NW-E02X''' series, were released in [[Japan]] in March 2008. The memory sizes were 1 GB for the NW-E023, 2 GB for the NW-E025, and 4 GB for the NW-E026. Each size was available in a five color assortment: white, pink, green, red, and black. The faces of the players were designed for admit changeable color and design templates. The supplied earbuds were the MDR-EX82 earphones in white for the white, pink, and green player and black for the red and black player.

These could play [[ATRAC]], [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]], [[Windows Media Audio|WMA]], [[MP3]], and [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]], ([[Digital rights management|DRM]]'ed WMA and AAC couldn't be played). As in older models the connector, was the standard male USB. The screen was [[LCD]] and displayed three lines along with an optional album-jacket function. It had a five-band equalizer and Sony's "clear stereo" which means pre-set EQ function.

They had a built-in [[Li-Ion]] cell which had a quick-charge for approximately three hours playback from a 3-minute plug-in and a complete charge takes about one hour. Sony mentioned the capability of FM reception, (Japan band of 76 to 90&amp;nbsp;MHz), usually devices with an ''F'' at the end of the model number. Dimensions were 83.7 × 22.3 × 16.2mm and weigh 30&amp;nbsp;grams.

Available accessories for all E series included lanyards, armbands, A/C adapters, metallic and silicone cases.

=== NW-S Series ===

The Sony "NW-S700" series is the first flash-based Network Walkman with built-in [[Active noise control]] technology. It blocks surrounding noise with integrating mic in its EX-earphone. This player is one of only a few other [[Digital audio player|DAP]]s that have a noise cancellation feature at this size. The earphone has a proprietary design specifically made for this player, thus making it impossible to plug into other DAPs, even the ones that come from Sony.
This Walkman has a small OLED screen capable displaying album art and some text information about the song and the player features. The S700 comes in 1&amp;nbsp;GB (NW-S703), 2&amp;nbsp;GB (NW-S705), and 4&amp;nbsp;GB (NW-S706) capacities; some countries sell the 2&amp;nbsp;GB and 1&amp;nbsp;GB models only. Selected models are also equipped with a Stereo FM Tuner.

=== NW-Z Series ===

The Sony NWZ-A826 is one of many MP3 players belonging to the Walkman Z-series. This edition features 4 GB flash memory, as well as a large {{convert|2.4|in|mm|adj=on}} monitor; in addition the MP3 player offers several audio options in a housing with a thickness of 9.3&amp;nbsp;mm. The EX earplugs come packaged. There are four audio options: Clear Stereo, Clear Bass, VPT Surround and DSEE Sound Enhancer.The ear plugs are a combination of earplugs and a normal earset in one.

=== W Series ===
[[File:walkman-w-series.JPG|thumb|Sony Walkman W series]]

The W series is a wireless MP3 player built into a set of water-resistant headphones with 2&amp;nbsp;GB of internal memory. It can play 11 hours of music and can "quick-charge" for three minutes to yield up to 90 minutes of playback. It can play back MP3, AAC (unprotected only), and WMA (subscription included) files. It features Zappin, which allows the user to browse through tracks by playing a snippet of the chorus of each song.

==Walkman Video MP3==

=== NW-A800 Series ===
{{Main|Sony NW-A800}}

The '''Sony NW-A800''' series is a [https://web.archive.org/web/20071028075729/http://www.walkmanvideomp3.com/ video-enabled Network Walkman player]. This series has a metallic build. A chrome-like strip surrounds the edge of the device, and accenting of the same style surrounds the buttons and makes up the logos on the front. It features a QVGA display with ID3 tag and album art support.

It is available in 2&amp;nbsp;GB, 4&amp;nbsp;GB, and 8&amp;nbsp;GB capacities. The interface is similar to that of a mobile phone. The screen is a {{convert|2.0|in|mm|adj=on}} QVGA (240×320) colour LCD and can be used either horizontally or vertically. The Lithium-ion rechargeable battery can last up to 30 hours for music and 8 hours for video.

The NW-A800 has been released in the European Union, Asia, New Zealand, and North America. As of 19 May 2007, Sony Canada has released the 8 GB and 4 GB models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonystyle.ca/commerce/servlet/CategoryDisplays?storeId=10001&amp;catalogId=10001&amp;langId=-1&amp;categoryId=46881 |title=Sony Style Canada |publisher=Sonystyle.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2 GB model was released on 13 June 2007.

This player is an ATRAC Audio Device which relies on SonicStage to manage music. For photo and video management it uses Sony's Image Converter.

=== NW-A810 Series ===
{{Main|Sony NW-A810}}

While hardware wise is the same as NW-A800, this series introduces some substantial changes in its media manager software. First, this player introduce drag and drop feature to transfer media. This update eliminates the need of Sony's proprietary SonicStage program and uses Windows Media Player instead. Also, this player no longer supports the ATRAC format.

=== NW-S710 and S610 Series ===

Soon, Sony launched another series of Walkman video player, type S, standing for "specialized". This was considered as a lower end product to Walkman A series.

=== NW-A820, A910 Series in Japan ===

At the end of 2007 and the beginning of 2008, Sony tried to further extend the product line of Walkman, with the debut of A910 series, A820 series. Among them, A910 and A820 should be the successor to A810, which feature larger LCD display and memory, and built-in wireless function (for A820 only).

The '''NW-A919''', a 16GB video walkman with a digital '[[1seg]]' TV tuner. The player has a touch screen, measures 47.2mm×86.0mm×12.3mm and will be available in black or silver. It was released in Japan in November 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecat.sony.co.jp/walkman/product.cfm?PD=29380&amp;KM=NW-A919 |title=NW-A910シリーズ &amp;#124; ポータブルオーディオプレーヤー WALKMAN "ウォークマン" &amp;#124; ソニー |publisher=Ecat.sony.co.jp |date= |accessdate=2011-01-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501023823/http://www.ecat.sony.co.jp/walkman/product.cfm?PD=29380&amp;KM=NW-A919 |archivedate=2008-05-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== NWZ-A820 and A720 Series ===

In March 2008, Sony debuted A720 and A820 series in the United States. These two models seemed to have exactly the same external design. The only difference appeared that the A820 series was equipped with a Bluetooth module which can be used to connect wireless headphones. The upgraded A820 and A720 had a 2.4" LCD display and a selection of memory from 4 gigabytes to 16 gigabyte. This also includes the popular 8 GB version. In some regions the package will contain a pair of Sony In-Ear Earbuds with sound-reduction technology. The EX85 series earbuds are included in the US retail package. It will not include an FM radio, additional memory storage, or a voice recorder. After Sony upgraded the Walkman A model, the A810 series was no longer viewable at SonyStyle online store.

=== Walkman X Series ===
[[File:Walkman X.jpg|thumb|150px|Sony [[Walkman X Series]] (2009)]]
{{Main|Walkman X Series}}

The Sony Walkman X series was a touchscreen audio and video player from Sony. It has a {{convert|3|in|mm|adj=on}} OLED touch screen, internet access through Wi-Fi and digital noise-cancelling as well as applications for [[Slacker (music service)|Slacker]] and [[YouTube]]. It is available in 16 GB and 32 GB versions.

Media files can be transferred using programs such as Media Manager, Windows Media Player 11 (both programs are on the CD), and Content Transfer (Sony made), but they can also be dragged and dropped from the computer to the device using a file manager such as Windows Explorer (if drag and drop is used, some id tag information is not included, such as the year). If [[Media Transfer Protocol|MTP]] is not installed on the computer, the Walkman switches to [[USB mass storage device class|UMS]]/MSC mode.

Like all Sony players sold outside Japan since 2007 (since the NWZ-A810 series), the player is not gapless (there is a gap between tracks, unless [[WAV]]/[[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] audio files are used), it does not support lossless compression, and there is no on-the-go playlist feature (playlists can only be created on a computer).{{Or|date=January 2011}}

'''Newton King''' (21 July 1855 &amp;ndash; 27 July 1927) was a New Zealand auctioneer, merchant and businessman. He was born in [[New Plymouth]], New Zealand, on 21 July 1855.&lt;ref name="DNZB King"&gt;{{DNZB|title=Newton King|first= James|last= Watson|id=3k13|accessdate=1 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King was born in [[New Plymouth]] into a leading local family. His father, [[Thomas King (New Zealand politician)|Thomas King]], was a [[Member of Parliament]]  and Provincial Treasurer on the Taranaki Provincial Council, as well as being a prominent local businessman. His brother, [[Truby King]] was a leading doctor and paediatrician, and founder of the [[Plunket Society]].&lt;ref name="DNZB King"/&gt;

After education at William Crompton's school, he became a clerk at the mercantile and shipping company Webster Brothers, before co-founding his own [[stock and station agency]] with Robert Bauchope in 1880. The new business, [[Newton King Limited]], took off and expanded, becoming leading rural auctioneers and dealing in both seed and grain and in imports and exports. In 1900, retail branches were established throughout [[Taranaki]].  In 1888 King was one of the founders of the Crown Dairy Company, along with James George and Richard Cock, and by 1897 it was New Zealand second largest dairy product company.&lt;ref name="DNZB King"/&gt;

Newton King was a strong supporter of development of New Plymouth harbour and was chairman of the harbour board from 1917 to 1922. A wharf completed in 1925 was named after him. Newton King died at his home, Brooklands, in 1927, survived by his wife, three sons and two daughters.&lt;ref name="DNZB King"/&gt;

'''''Nothing in Common''''' is a 1986 American [[comedy-drama]] film directed by [[Garry Marshall]]. It stars [[Tom Hanks]] and [[Jackie Gleason]] in what would prove to be Gleason's final film role; he was suffering from terminal cancer.

The film was not a great financial success in initial release, but it became more popular as Hanks' fame grew. It is considered by some to be a pivotal role in Hanks' career because it marked his transition from less developed comedic roles to leads in more serious stories, and many critics also praised Gleason's performance.

==Plot==
Happy-go-lucky advertising executive David Basner, who recently got a promotion at his Chicago ad agency, returns to work from a vacation. He is carefree, until his parents split up, after 36 years of marriage. It soon becomes apparent that he must care for his aging, bitter father Max, as well as support his emotionally fragile mother Lorraine, especially since his father has also just been fired from his 35-year career in the garment industry. Although his ex-girlfriend, Donna, is sympathetic, she also tells him he needs to "grow up," but David fears that if he tried to be less child-like, his advertising work could be adversely affected. At work, David is developing a commercial for Colonial Airlines, owned by the rich and bullish Andrew Woolridge. A successful ad campaign would likely gain David a promotion to partner in his company. David develops a relationship with Woolridge's daughter, Cheryl Ann Wayne. His father is well aware of David's playboy nature. Asking at one point whether his son is in bed with a woman, Max adds: "Anybody you know?"

The parents separately each begin to rely more on David, frequently calling him on the phone. His mother needs help moving to a new apartment. His father needs to be driven to an eye doctor. Late one night, David's mother calls to be rescued from a bar after going out on a date, having become frightened when the man tried to kiss her goodnight. At the bar, David's mother confides that his father Max had cheated on her and humiliated her in their marriage. An enraged David goes to confront Max. Their argument ends with David saying: "Tomorrow I'm shooting a commercial about a family who loves each other, who cares about each other. I'm fakin' it." The next day, David is distracted by his problems with his father, affecting his work. As a peace offering, David offers to take Max to a nightclub to hear some of his favored jazz music. While there, David accidentally discovers that his father has been dealing with diabetes and his foot has gangrene.

Max must have surgery. Beforehand, he and Lorraine share thoughts about their life together, and she condemns him for his treatment of her. Alone, Max sobs in regret. At the agency, Andrew Woolridge insists that David accompany him to New York to promote the new ad campaign for his airline. David refuses, saying he wants to be with his father, who is scheduled for surgery. After Woolridge complains and slaps David on his arm, David loses his temper with this important client, and loses the account. The next day, David accompanies his dad to the operating room. His boss Charlie is sympathetic, relating an experience as a son dealing with an aging father and assures David that he will personally smooth things over with Woolridge, so David can take time to be with his father. Max has two toes amputated. When he goes home from the hospital, David pushes his wheelchair. Max tells him: "You were the last person I thought would ever come through for me." Later, David recovers his job and gets to show Max what his work is about.

== Critical reception ==
The film received mixed reviews from critics and audiences. Review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 57% out of 23 professional critics gave the film a positive review, with an average score of 5.9/10.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/nothing_in_common/ Nothing in Common - Rotten Tomatoes]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] of [[The Chicago Sun-Times]] awarded the film a 2.5 out of 4 stars and stated in his review "The movie splits in two, starting out as a wise-guy comedy and ending up as the heart-breaking story of a yuppie who is trying to understand his bitter, lonely parents. Movies aren't novels."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nothing in Common|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/nothing-in-common-1986|publisher=Roger Ebert|date=1986-07-30|accessdate=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television series==
{{Main|Nothing in Common (TV series)}} 
The movie inspired a short-lived [[NBC]] sitcom in 1987 that was scheduled to follow the highly [[Nielsen ratings|rated]] ''[[Cheers]].'' Due to audience drop-off, the sitcom was cancelled. The series starred [[Todd Waring]] as David Basner and [[Bill Macy]] as his father Max Basner.

'''Omar Albertto''' (more often known simply as, '''Omar''') is a Los Angeles-based agent for the fashion industry, who has specialized in representing ethinically diverse male models.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-12-14/news/vw-6599_1_ethnic-models|title=FASHION :  The New Models :  Unconventional Looks Are in Vogue on the Runway and in Photo Layouts|first=WILLIAM|last=KISSEL|date=14 December 1990|publisher=|accessdate=4 September 2017|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the founder of the highly influential agency, Omar's Men, which had more than a million dollars of revenue its first year of operation (1987),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/itn-fashion-tv-appoints-los-angeles-premier-model-agent-omar-as-president-7271312.html&lt;/ref&gt; with continued growth thru the mid-90s. It  included a roster of male models from The [[Philippines]], [[Turkey]], [[Brazil]], [[Cambodia]], [[America]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9GlNAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Omar+Albertto%22&amp;dq=%22Omar+Albertto%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjahoTArsrOAhVB6GMKHQ69CnkQ6AEIIDAA|title=Cosmopolitan|author=|date=1 January 1994|publisher=Hearst Corporation|accessdate=4 September 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He currently owns and runs, ''JustOmar'', a modeling agency and branding company in [[Southern California]].&lt;ref name="fashion.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fashion.net/omar-albertto|title=Omar Albertto on FASHION NET|author=|date=|website=www.fashion.net|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albertto is known for finding new talents and often credited with originally introducing ''real people'' into the U.S. fashion market. In a 1988 [[LA Times]] article by Jeanine Stein, he was quoted, ''"I want to have an agency of real people, not models. They are real, everyday people with great style"''.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-12-02/news/vw-912_1_modeling-agent|title=Fashion 88 :  The Style Broker :  Omar the Agent Says Goodby &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93; to the Ken Doll Image and Hello to a New Realism in Male Modeling|first=JEANNINE|last=STEIN|date=2 December 1988|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the last three decades his Men have appeared in almost every prestigious international fashion magazine including;  [[L’Uomo Vogue]], [[GQ (magazine)]], [[Arena Magazine]] and [[Esquire (magazine)]] - and have appeared in campaigns for [[Ralph Lauren]], [[Versace]],  [[Gucci]], [[Armani]] and [[Dolce &amp; Gabbana]].&lt;ref name="fashion.net"/&gt; Many have also segued into successful acting careers. Thru the years he has introduced (via modeling) the actors [[Djimon Honsou]] (Academy Award Nominee), [[Antonio Sabàto Jr.]] and [[Tyrese Gibson]] - the star of [[The Fast and the Furious]] franchise films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/fast-furious-8-tyrese-gibson-teases-new-cast-member-charlize-therons-impact-movie-1568619|title=Tyrese Gibson reveals new cast member Charlize Theron's impact on Fast And Furious 8|first=Jigmey|last=Bhutia|date=3 July 2016|website=ibtimes.co.uk|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His models have worked extensively with photographers such as [[Bruce Weber (photographer)|Bruce Weber]], [[Mario Testino]], [[Matthew Rolston]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.uomoclassico.com/2009/12/1988-omars-men-models.html|title=1988: OMAR'S MEN Models|author=|date=|website=uomoclassico.com|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the late [[Herb Ritts]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Ritts once used Albertto himself to appear in a [[Gap Inc.|Gap]] advertisement that appeared seventy-five feet high above [[Times Square]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fashion.net/omar-albertto|title=Omar Albertto on FASHION NET|website=fashion.net|publisher=[[Fashion Net]]|accessdate=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agent career==

Omar's first job as a modeling booker began in 1981 with New York's L'image agency where he worked with a young [[Paul Fisher (agent)|Paul Fisher]] (present-day star of [[Remodeled]] on [[The CW]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1941007/|title=Remodeled (TV Series 2012– )|author=|date=|website=imdb.com|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;). A couple of years later they both moved to California and found work with EastWest Models. Paul represented the girls division and Omar ran the Men's side of the company. After just over a year Paul left the agency to begin his own firm, It Models.

In 1987, Omar left as well and founded ''Omar's Men'' joining Fisher (and It Models) in an adjoined complex in [[Hollywood]]'s Photo District. According to the Los Angeles Times, the two agents combined gross revenue was
$15,000,000 annually.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; The men's department soon outgrew itself and Albertto opened an East Coast hub of the company out of Herb Ritt's studio office in [[Manhattan]].
Omar has since headed the Men's Divisions of the agencies, Warning Model Management, Q Models, and Talent Rock Entertainment and was briefly president of ITN Fashion TV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/itn-fashion-tv-appoints-los-angeles-premier-model-agent-omar-as-president-72761312.html|title=ITN Fashion TV Appoints Los Angeles' Premier Model Agent, Omar, as President|first=Internet Television|last=Network|date=|website=www.prnewswire.com|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On multiple occasions Albertto has cast models in large-scale projects (including [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]] and [[Dolce &amp; Gabbana]]) for iconic photographer [[Mario Testino]], who was quoted in [[Business Wire]] as saying, ''"Omar's eye is uncanny, he never misses. He never steers me wrong."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20030408005271/en/Warning-Model-Collars-Omar-Talent|title=Warning Model Collars Omar for Talent - Business Wire|website=businesswire.com|accessdate=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With his latest incarnation, the agency '''JustOmar''', he is presenting new faces, artists and photographers such as; designer/model Bryant Brown, model Chris Theo, artist/model Connor Tingley, artist/model David Caffrey, architect/model Jose Laguna and Los Angeles photographer, Josie Perez. He has also launched a division specifically for product branding.&lt;ref name="fashion.net"/&gt;

==The Producer==

In recent years, Omar Albertto has also begun getting more involved in TV and film production. In 2013, he (and Brian Lewis) produced an independent romantic drama film entitled, ''Things Never Said'', for Ohio Street Pictures. The project starred [[Shanola Hampton]], [[Omari Hardwick]] and [[Elimu Nelson]] and was written/directed by Charles Murray. The picture had a limited theatrical release in the United States and also appeared on [[Hulu]] TV.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indiewire.com/2013/08/charles-murrays-things-never-said-gets-a-new-release-trailer-poster-166026/
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Omar collaborated with fashion photographer Andrew MacPherson to produce one of the first ever fashion magazine shoots involving an autistic model, in this case, 18 year old RJ Peete (son of football player [[Rodney Peete]] and actress [[Holly Robinson Peete]]. The images (and Omar in person) later appeared on an airing of the program [[For Peete's Sake]] on the [[Oprah Winfrey Network (U.S. TV channel)|Oprah Winfrey Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rj-peete-model-autism_us_573cbb18e4b0aee7b8e8bd97|title=Aspiring Teen Model Proves That Autism Won't Hold Him Back|first=|last=OWN|date=19 May 2016|publisher=|accessdate=4 September 2017|via=Huff Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modeling==

In 1977, while attending a party at [[New York City|New York]]'s infamous [[Studio 54]] where he was a regular, nineteen year old Omar was discovered by a scout for [[Elite Model Management]]. This was an encounter that changed his life drastically. For the next four years, he worked regularly doing print and runway in [[Paris]], [[Milan]] and [[London]]. All the while, frequently returning to New York to attend Studio 54 on the weekends. Although never officially retiring as a model, Omar began his first official employment as an agent in 1981 at L'image Models on [[Madison Avenue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-12-02/news/vw-912_1_modeling-agent/2|title=Fashion 88 :  The Style Broker :  Omar the Agent Says Goodby to the Ken Doll Image and Hello to a New Realism in Male Modeling|first=JEANNINE|last=STEIN|date=2 December 1988|publisher=|accessdate=4 September 2017|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Omar Albertto who is ''non-religious'' of Bremudan and [[Jewish]]-[[Ethiopian]] descent, grew up in Panama, where he was born. He was a competitive amateur swimmer between the ages of nine and eighteen, representing Panama as a member of the club, Los Pulpos Da Villa. In 1976 he went to [[Florida]]'s [[Disney World]] on vacation and never returned, defecting to the [[United States]]. He graduated from [[Brooklyn]]'s [[Midwood High School]] in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Fashion 88 : The Style Broker : Omar the Agent Says Goodby &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93; to the Ken Doll Image and Hello to a New Realism in Male Modeling |url= http://articles.latimes.com/1988-12-02/news/vw-912_1_modeling-agent/2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.vivapanama.org/omar-albertto.html |title= Omar Albertto |website= vivapanama.org |publisher= |accessdate= 18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7015">'''Operating leverage''' is a measure of how revenue growth translates into growth in [[operating income]].  It is a measure of [[Leverage (finance)|leverage]], and of how risky, or volatile, a company's operating income is.

==Definition==
There are various measures of operating leverage,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westga.edu/~bquest/1998/leverage.html Operating and Financial leverage&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
which can be interpreted analogously to [[financial leverage]].

===Costs===
One analogy is '''"fixed costs + variable costs = total costs ..similar to.. debt + equity = assets".''' This analogy is partly motivated because (for a given amount of debt) debt servicing is a fixed cost. This leads to two measures of operating leverage:

One measure is [[fixed costs]] to [[total costs]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\text{FC}}{\text{TC}}=\frac{\text{FC}}{\text{FC}+\text{VC}}&lt;/math&gt;
Compare to [[Debt to equity ratio|debt to value]], which is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\text{Debt}}{\text{Assets}}=\frac{\text{Debt}}{\text{Debt}+\text{Equity}}&lt;/math&gt;

Another measure is [[fixed costs]] to [[variable costs]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\text{FC}}{\text{VC}}&lt;/math&gt;
Compare to [[debt to equity ratio]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\text{Debt}}{\text{Equity}}&lt;/math&gt;

Both of these measures depend on sales: if the unit variable cost is constant, then as sales increase, operating leverage (as measured by fixed costs to total costs or variable costs) increases.

===Contribution===
[[Contribution margin]] is a measure of operating leverage: the higher the contribution margin is (the lower variable costs are as a percentage of total costs), the faster the profits increase with sales. Note that unlike other measures of operating leverage, in the linear [[Cost-Volume-Profit Analysis]] Model, contribution margin is a fixed quantity, and does not change with Sales.
Contribution  =  Sales - Variable Cost

===DOL and Operating income===
Operating leverage can also be measured in terms of change in [[operating income]] for a given change in sales (revenue).

The '''Degree of Operating Leverage''' (DOL) can be computed in a number of equivalent ways; one way it is defined as the ratio of the percentage change in Operating Income for a given percentage change in Sales {{harv|Brigham|1995|p=426}}:
:&lt;math&gt;\text{DOL} = \frac{\%\text{ change in Operating Income}}{\% \text{ change in Sales}}&lt;/math&gt;

This can also be computed as Total [[Contribution Margin]] over [[Operating Income]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\text{DOL} = \frac{\text{Total Contribution}}{\text{Operating Income}} = \frac{\text{Total Contribution}}{\text{Total Contribution} - \text{Fixed Costs}} = \frac{(\text{P}-\text{V})\cdot \text{X}}{(\text{P}-\text{V})\cdot \text{X} - \text{FC}}&lt;/math&gt;

The above equivalence follows as the relative change in operating income with one more unit dX equals the contribution margin divided by operating income while the relative change in sales with one more unit dX equals price divided by revenue (or, in other words, 1 / X with X being the quantity). 

Alternatively, as Contribution Margin Ratio over [[Operating Margin]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\text{DOL} = \frac{\text{Contribution Margin Ratio}}{\text{Operating Margin}}&lt;/math&gt;

For instance, if a company has sales of 1,000,000 units, at price $50, unit variable cost of $10, and fixed costs of $10,000,000, then its unit contribution is $40, its Total Contribution is $40m, and its Operating Income is $30m, so its DOL is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\$\text{40m}}{\$\text{30m}} = 1 \frac{1}{3} \approx 1.33&lt;/math&gt;
This could also be computed as 80%=$40m/$50m Contribution Margin Ratio divided by 60%=$30m/$50m Operating Margin.

It currently has Sales of $50m and Operating Income of $30m, so additional Unit Sales (say of 100,000 units) yield $5m more Sales and $4m more Operating Income: a 10% increase in Sales and a 10% &lt;math&gt;\times 1 \frac{1}{3}=&lt;/math&gt; 13{{fraction|1|3}}% increase in Operating Income.

Assuming the  model, for a given level of sales, the DOL is higher the higher fixed costs are ([http://moneyterms.co.uk/operational_gearing/ an example]): for a given level of sales and profit, a company with higher fixed costs has a lower Operating Income, and hence its Operating Income increases more rapidly with Sales than a company with lower fixed costs (and correspondingly lower contribution margin and higher Operating Income).

If a company has no fixed costs (and hence breaks even at zero), then its DOL equals 1: a 10% increase in Sales yields a 10% increase in Operating Income, and its [[operating margin]] equals its  [[contribution margin]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\text{Operating Income}}{\text{Sales}}=\frac{\text{Unit Price} - \text{Unit Variable Cost}}{\text{Unit Price}}&lt;/math&gt;

DOL is highest near the [[break-even point]]; in fact, at the break-even point, DOL is undefined, because it is infinite: an increase of 10% in sales, say, increases Operating Income for 0 to some positive number (say, $10), which is an infinite (or undefined) percentage change; in terms of margins, its Operating Margin is zero, so its DOL is undefined.
Similarly, for a very small positive Operating Income (say, $.1), a 10% increase in sales may increase Operating Income to $10, a 100x (or 9,900%) increase, for a DOL of 990; in terms of margins, its Operating Margin is very small, so its DOL is very large.

DOL is closely related to the rate of increase in the [[operating margin]]: as sales increase past the break-even point, operating margin rapidly increases from 0% (reflected in a high DOL), and as sales increase, asymptotically approaches the contribution margin: thus the rate of change in operating margin decreases, as does the DOL, which asymptotically approaches 1.

==Industry-specific==
Examples of companies with high operating leverage include companies with high R&amp;D costs, such as pharmaceuticals: it can cost billions to develop a drug, but then pennies to produce it. Hence from a [[Whole-life cost|life cycle cost analysis]] perspective, the ratio of preproduction costs (e.g. design widgets) versus incremental production costs (e.g. produce a widget) is a useful measure of operating leverage.

===Outsourcing===
[[Outsourcing]] a product or service is a method used to change the ratio of [[fixed costs]] to [[variable costs]] in a business.  Outsourcing can be used to change the balance of this ratio by offering a move from fixed to variable cost and also by making variable costs more predictable.

'''Partners HealthCare''' is a Boston-based non-profit hospital and physicians network that includes [[Brigham and Women’s Hospital]] (BWH) and [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] (MGH), two of the nation’s most prestigious teaching institutions.&lt;ref name="Connors_2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HBR_2002"&gt;{{citation |title=Just-in-Time Delivery Comes to Knowledge Management |authors=Thomas H.

==History==

In 1994, [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]] and [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] were brought together by Partners founding co-chairs [[John H. McArthur]] and [[Ferdinand Colloredo-Mansfeld|Ferdinand "Moose" Colloredo-Mansfeld]]. [[Jack Connors (advertising)|Jack Connors]] succeeded them as chair in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.partners.org/About/History-Achievements/History-of-Partners.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, the [[United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts]] announced that Partners HealthCare System and one of its hospitals, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, agreed to pay a $10 million fine to resolve allegations that a [[stem cell]] research lab fraudulently obtained [[Federal grants in the United States|federal grant funding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Finucane |first=Martin |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/04/27/million-settlement-announced-brigham-and-women-research-fraud-case/Tml7mJl1isJhUwSOZIyNlO/story.html |title=Partners, Brigham and Women’s to pay $10m in research fraud case |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=2017-04-27 |accessdate=2017-04-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Partners Healthcare Urgent Care in Boston.jpg|thumb|left|250px|alt=A Partners Urgent Care facility in Boston, Massachusetts.|A Partners Urgent Care facility in Boston, Massachusetts.]]

In May 2017, Partners announced they would be cutting more than $600 million in expenses over the next three years in an effort to control higher costs and to become more efficient. The cost-cutting initiative is called Partners 2.0, and the plan will look to reduce costs in research, care delivery, revenue collection, and supply chain. The plan will begin on October 1, 2017 and will eliminate jobs. The company lost $108 million in 2016.&lt;ref name="Dayal" /&gt;

In February 2018, Partners announced that 100 [[Clinical coder|coders]] would have their jobs [[Business process outsourcing to India|outsourced to India]] in a cost saving move. This is all part of the non-profit hospital and physicians network's three-year plan to reduce $500 million to $800 million in overhead costs.&lt;ref name="Kowalczyk" /&gt;

In February 2018, the state of Massachusetts Public Health Council formally signed off on the acquisition of [[Massachusetts Eye and Ear]]. The deal was formalized on April 1, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McCluskey |first=Priyanka Dayal |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2018/02/14/state-formally-signs-off-merger-between-mass-eye-and-ear-parthers-healthcare/OIpu8OOgPSGtkpH40pbHeJ/story.html |title=State formally signs off on merger between Mass.

PIMS collaborates with foreign [[embassies]], ministries of health, and [[universities]] overseas to improve health status indicators directly through [[patient care]] initiatives and indirectly through medical conferences and other educational programs for physicians and nurses.

Partners's biomedical research "juggernaut was larger than Harvard University's."&lt;ref name="BG_2008" /&gt; and embarked{{when|date=May 2016}} on a multibillion-dollar expansion program that rivals those of all other Massachusetts hospitals combined."&lt;ref name="BG_2008" /&gt; A doctors' magazine recently named Partners' current chief executive the most powerful physician executive in the nation.

==Expansion==
In 2013, Partners HealthCare System's plan to take over 378-bed South Shore Hospital in [[Weymouth, Massachusetts|Weymouth]] was reviewed due to fears that the expansion plan is anticompetitive, a conduct Partners HealthCare System had been accused of over the past four years in other cases.&lt;ref name=globe2&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/health-wellness/2014/01/17/partners-healthcare-rebuts-state-report-says-expansion-south-shore-will-save-millions/2wGIQEELBo5HLkhjHguDRO/story.html |date=17 January 2014 |accessdate=11 July 2015 |title=Partners defends plan to expand: Rebutting state, says South Shore merger would save millions |author=Liz Kowalczyk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/2013/09/16/health-care-industry-awaits-decision-regulators-partners-bid-acquire-south-shore-hospital/iUdPr5AuTksCfTdYIBPmeP/story.html|date=16 September 2013 |title=Health care industry awaits decision by regulators on Partners bid to acquire South Shore Hospital |author=Robert Weisman |accessdate=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blue Cross==
Partners CEO Thier led Partners' efforts to demand higher payments from insurance companies.&lt;ref name="BG_2008"&gt;{{cite news |date=2008 |title=Unhealthy System: Is medical giant Partners HealthCare good for Massachusetts? |series=The Boston Globe Spotlight team |url= http://www.boston.com/news/specials/healthcare_spotlight/|newspaper= [[The Boston Globe]]|accessdate= 11 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2000 Thier and William C. Van Faasen, CEO of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts—the state's biggest health insurer—agreed to a deal that raised insurance costs all across Massachusetts. They agreed that Van Faasen would substantially increase insurance payments to Partners HealthCare doctors and hospitals, largely correcting the underpayments of the previous 10 years. Prior to this, Thier had informed all three managed care companies that they would all be paid at the same rate.&lt;ref name="boston_2008"&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/specials/2008/12/28/handshake-that-made-healthcare-history/QiWbywqb8olJsA3IZ11o1H/story.html |title=A handshake that made healthcare history |date=28 December 2008 |accessdate=11 July 2015 |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |authors=Scott Allen, Marcella Bombardieri}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Those who helped broker the deal say Thier promised he would push for the same or bigger payment increases for everything from X-rays to brain surgery from Van Faasen's competition, ensuring that all major insurers would face tens of millions in cost increases. Blue Cross called it a "market covenant."|''The Boston Globe'', 28 December 2008}}

According to ''Boston Globe'' investigative journalists, Blue Cross and other insurers increased the rate it paid Partners HealthCare by 75 percent between 2000 and 2008.&lt;ref name="BG_2008" /&gt;

'''''Putney Swope''''' is a 1969 [[Satire#Satire and Humor|satirical comedy]] film written and directed by [[Robert Downey Sr.]] and starring [[Arnold Johnson (actor)|Arnold Johnson]] as the title character, a black advertising executive. The film satirizes the [[advertising|advertising world]], the portrayal of [[race (human categorization)|race]] in [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood films]], the [[White supremacy|white power structure]], and the nature of [[Corporate crime|corporate corruption]].

In 2016, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".

==Plot==
Putney Swope, the only black man on the executive board of an advertising firm, is accidentally put in charge after the sudden death of the [[Board of directors|chairman of the board]]: prevented by the company by-laws to vote for themselves, in a [[secret ballot]], most board members voted for the one person they thought could not win:  Putney Swope.

Renaming the business "Truth and Soul, Inc.", Swope replaces all but one of the white employees with blacks and insists they no longer accept business from companies that produce [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[tobacco]] or [[toy guns]].  The success of the business draws unwanted attention from the United States government, which considers it "a threat to the [[national security]]".

==Production==

In an interview on the [[DVD]] version of the film, Downey states that Arnold Johnson had great difficulty memorizing and saying his lines during the film shoot. Downey says he was not concerned because he had developed a plan to dub in his own voice to replace Johnson's.

Though the movie is in black-and-white, Truth and Soul's commercials are shown in color.

==Legacy==
The character Buck Swope ([[Don Cheadle]]), from [[Paul Thomas Anderson]]'s ''[[Boogie Nights]]'', was named as an homage to this film.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} [[Robert Downey Sr.]] also made a small cameo in ''Boogie Nights'' as the owner of a recording studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://filmschoolrejects.com/37-things-we-learned-from-the-boogie-nights-commentary-fb8bba501524#.f1o1nidqv |title=37 Things We Learned From the ‘Boogie Nights’ Commentary |date=September 13, 2012 |author=jeremykirk13 |publisher=[[Film School Rejects]] |accessdate=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character Wing Soney, a [[China|Chinese]] businessman, was the inspiration for Cosmo, the Chinese character throwing [[firecrackers]] during the drug deal scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/mediaroom/video/275870/Putney-Swope-Movie-Clip-Wing-Soney.html |title=Putney Swope - (Movie Clip) Wing Soney |publisher=Tcm.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Six Segment Analysis''' is a framework to analyze the general environment of a firm. The framework is frequently used in the analysis of [[competitive strategy]]. Six Segment Analysis can help managers to identify potential opportunities and threats. The six segments of the general environment are ''demographic'', ''sociocultural'', ''political/legal'', ''technological'', ''economic'', and ''global''.&lt;ref name="Besanko, D. 2009"&gt;Besanko, D., Dranove, D., Shanley, M., &amp; Schaefer, S. (2009). ''[[Economics of Strategy]]''. John Wiley &amp; Sons. New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to [[Michael Porter]]'s [[Five forces analysis]], which focuses on the competitiveness of a specific industry, Six Segment Analysis target on broader macro-environmental trends. Such trends could potentially affect the profitability of the industry as a whole and influence the sustainability of the competitive strategies of a company.

== Composition ==
Below is a sample list of macro-environmental trends classified according to the six segments.&lt;ref name="slideshare"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/birubiru/environment-analysis-6953951 |title=Environment analysis|publisher=slideshare.net|accessdate=2015-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Natural ===
*sensitivity to the environment
*Growth of importance and pressure
*Reduce pollution
*Renewal of energy 
*Global warming

=== Sociocultural segment ===
*Women in the workplaces
*Workforce diversity
*Attitudes about quality of worklife
*Concerns about environment
*Shifts in work and career preferences
*Shifts in product and service preferences

=== Political/legal segment ===
*Antitrust laws
*Taxation laws
*Deregulation philosophies
*Labor training laws
*Educational philosophies and policies

=== Technological segment ===
*Product innovations
*Applications of knowledge
*Focus of private and government-supported R&amp;D expenditures
*New communication technologies

=== Economic segment ===
*Inflation rates
*Interest rates
*Trade deficits or surpluses
*Budget deficits or surpluses
*Personal savings rate
*Business savings rates
*Gross domestic product

=== Global segment ===
*Important political events
*Critical global markets
*Newly industrialized countries
*Different cultural and institutional attributes

== Interaction with other frameworks ==
When management analyzes a firm's strategic position, it is important to obtain a good understanding of the external environment of the company. Typically the external environment analysis consists of ''general environment'', ''industry environment'' and ''competitor environment''.&lt;ref name="pradeeploganathan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pradeeploganathan.com/management/external-environment-opportunities-threats-industry-competition-and-competitor-analysis/ |title=External Environment, Opportunities, Threats, Industry competition and Competitor analysis. &amp;#124; Pradeep Loganathan |publisher=pradeeploganathan.com|accessdate=2015-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six Segment Analysis provides insights on the threats and opportunities existing in the general environment.

While a very popular framework for the industry environment analysis is the [[Five forces analysis]], [[strategic group]] is a substructure of an industry that may play a role in understanding performance differences among firms.&lt;ref name="Besanko, D. 2009"/&gt;

Competitor analysis typically starts with an identification of the [[market structure]] and proceed with complex strategic decision making analysis of [[Game Theory]].

'''''Space Station Tycoon''''' was a [[video game]] to be released in the future for the [[Wii]] developed by [[Wahoo Studios]] (developer of [[Outpost Kaloki X]]) and published by [[Namco Bandai]]. In this [[business simulation game]], players take on the role of Shawn and his monkey sidekick, Tam, as they build and maintain [[space station]]s. The game also features 30 other characters. It features a level-based system, where gamers have to complete a set of mission objectives—including "light puzzle solving"—to progress to the next stage and further expand their empire.

The game lets players use the motion sensing of the [[Wii Remote]] to create gravity points and interact with objects in the environment. As well as undertaking tasks such as catching asteroids to stop them from smashing into the space station and lobbing cannonballs at space pirates. There is also a [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] mode and [[co-op]] play elements.

'''Stan Katz''' (born 25 March 1949) is a South African broadcaster, best known as the presenter of  [[Radio 702]]'s highly rated '''Morning Zoo''' show. Katz would later become the CEO of [[Primedia Broadcasting]].

==Background==
Katz completed a  B.Com at the [[University of the Witwatersrand]] and began his broadcasting career at [[Swazi Music Radio]] where he was a radio presenter and programme director. In 1976 he began his own communications company and began staging music festivals in South Africa. He wrote and produced 'A Tribute to Jimmy Hendrix' at the [[Market Theatre (Johannesburg)]]. 

He returned to radio presenting in 1982 with an afternoon slot on [[Radio 702]] presenting “The Stan Katz Goodtime Lowdown Rock and Roll Radio Show”. Three years later he became the station's Sales and Marketing Director. By 1987 he was both the managing director of the station and popular host of the highly rated '''Morning Zoo'''.

In 1994 he became CEO of [[Primedia Broadcasting]] and oversaw the establishment of Cape Town's premier radio station, [[Cape Talk]]. Several years later, he co-founded MobiBlitz, a mobile media company specializing in the deployment of Bluetooth systems in shopping malls.

Katz was inducted into the MTN Radio Awards Hall of Fame in 2012 and continues to work as a radio consultant, lending his expertise and experience to both domestic and international radio stations.

He has also authored a book on radio advertising and marketing entitled: “Radio Advertising. A Sound Investment. 10 Key Principles for Maximising Returns”.

==Personal life==

The '''Tony Jannus Award''' recognizes outstanding individual achievement in scheduled commercial aviation by airline executives, inventors and manufacturers, and government leaders. The award is conferred annually by the '''Tony Jannus Distinguished Aviation Society''' and was first bestowed in 1964 in [[Tampa, Florida]], U.S. Its namesake, aviation pioneer [[Tony Jannus]] (1889&amp;ndash;October 12, 1916), piloted the inaugural flight of the [[St. Petersburg–Tampa Airboat Line]] on January 1, 1914, the first scheduled commercial airline flight in the world using heavier-than-air aircraft.&lt;ref name=NYT67&gt;{{cite news|title=Rickenbacker is honored for assistance to airlines|date=January 21, 1967|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1967/01/21/82993793.pdf|accessdate=2009-01-27 | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Society&gt;{{cite web|title=Tony Jannus, an enduring legacy of aviation |work=Tony Jannus Distinguished Aviation Society |url=http://www.tonyjannusaward.com/history.html |accessdate=October 27, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716153330/http://tonyjannusaward.com/history.html |archivedate=July 16, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to preserving the legacy of Tony Jannus, the non-profit Society also offers financial assistance to college students pursuing studies in aviation and conducts an annual essay contest for high school students to encourage careers in aviation.

Past recipients of the award include such famed luminaries as  [[Eddie Rickenbacker]], [[Donald Wills Douglas, Sr.|Donald Douglas]], [[Jimmy Doolittle]], [[C. R. Smith]] (the founder of [[American Airlines]]), [[William A. Patterson]] (president of [[United Airlines]] 1934&amp;ndash;1966), and [[Chuck Yeager]]. Those so honored are enshrined at the St. Petersburg Museum of History's First Airline Pavilion. The Museum, located  {{convert|100|yards|0}} from the site of the inaugural flight's takeoff on January 1, 1914, also has an operational replica of the [[Benoist XIV]] airplane flown by Jannus that day.&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Warren J.|title=Florida's Aviation History|publisher=Aero-Medical Consultants|location=Largo, Florida|year=1994|isbn=0-912522-70-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|334}} On January 29, 2011, the [[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics]] dedicated an historic site plaque on the museum's grounds, commemorating the site of the world’s first regularly scheduled airline.

==History==
{{main|Tony Jannus}}

[[Tony Jannus]] was an early American [[Aviator|pilot]] whose aerial exploits were widely publicized in aviation's pre-World War I period. He flew the first airplane from which a parachute jump was made, in 1912.&lt;ref name=govt&gt;{{cite web|title=Aviation History Facts – March |publisher=U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission |year=2008 |url=http://www.centennialofflight.gov/user/fact_mar.htm |accessdate=2009-01-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117201935/http://centennialofflight.gov/user/fact_mar.htm |archivedate=2009-01-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jannus was also the first airline pilot, having pioneered the inaugural flight of the [[St. Petersburg–Tampa Airboat Line]] on January 1, 1914, the first scheduled commercial airline flight in the world using heavier-than-air aircraft.&lt;ref name=Society/&gt; Departing from a location near the downtown St. Petersburg Municipal Pier on Second Avenue North, Jannus piloted the twenty-three-minute inaugural flight of the pioneer airline's [[Benoist XIV]] flying boat biplane. A crowd of 3,000 gathered at the pier to watch the history-making takeoff at 10&amp;nbsp;a.m. and were told by organizer Percival Fansler that "What was impossible yesterday is an accomplishment today, while tomorrow heralds the unbelieveable" {{sic}}.&lt;ref name=Brown /&gt;{{Rp|68}}  
[[Image:Benoist xiv.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The ''St. Petersburg&amp;ndash;Tampa Airboat Line'' over Tampa Bay, 1914]]
Occurring just ten years after [[Wright brothers|Wilbur and Orville Wright]]'s historic first airplane flight, the new St. Petersburg–Tampa Airboat Line began providing two daily round trips across Tampa Bay, departing St. Petersburg at 10&amp;nbsp;a.m. and 2&amp;nbsp;p.m., with return flights from Tampa departing at 11&amp;nbsp;a.m. and 3&amp;nbsp;p.m. At a fare of five dollars, it was the first time tickets were sold to the general public for point-to-point commercial air travel on a scheduled basis.&lt;ref name=Brown /&gt;{{Rp|63}}&lt;ref name=Trib&gt;{{cite news|title=First Commercial Air Ship Line in World Inaugurated|publisher=''[[The Tampa Tribune]]''|date=January 2, 1914|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fifty years later, in 1963, James Hamlett and the Greater Tampa Chamber of Commerce created the Tony Jannus Award to recognize the "Man who has done the most to advance the airline industry" and to celebrate the Tampa Bay area's historic role in the development of commercial aviation.&lt;ref name=NYT67 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Brown /&gt;{{Rp|321}} The following March 1964, Senator [[A. S. Mike Monroney]] was named the first Tony Jannus Award recipient for his work as chairman of the U.S. Senate's Aviation Subcommittee and as chief proponent of the [[Federal Aviation Act of 1958]] that created the [[Federal Aviation Administration]].&lt;ref name=Brown /&gt;{{Rp|322}} In the 1970s, the St. Petersburg Chamber of Commerce joined with the Tampa chamber to co-sponsor the award. The joint effort by the two chambers of commerce eventually evolved into the Tony Jannus Distinguished Aviation Society, a non-profit organization which now confers the award.

Winners of the Tony Jannus Award are enshrined at the St. Petersburg Museum of History's ''First Airline Pavilion'' and Tony Jannus-related exhibits. The Museum, located {{convert|100|yards|0}} from the site of the inaugural flight's takeoff on January 1, 1914, also has an operational replica of the [[Benoist XIV]] airplane flown by Jannus that day. The replica was built by the Florida Aviation Historical Society in 1983 and flown across Tampa Bay from St. Petersburg to Tampa on January 1, 1984, in a reenactment of the Jannus inaugural flight 70&amp;nbsp;years earlier.&lt;ref name=Brown /&gt;{{Rp|330}} The replica was moved to the museum in January, 1993.&lt;ref name=Brown /&gt;{{Rp|334}}

== General election ==
=== Candidates ===
* [[Ben Nelson]] (D), incumbent U.S. Senator
* [[Pete Ricketts]] (R), former COO of [[TD Ameritrade]]

=== Campaign ===
The primary election was held May 9, 2006. Pete Ricketts won the Republican nomination with 48% of the vote. Ben Nelson was unopposed for the Democratic nomination. Nelson was elected in 2000 by a margin of 51% to 49% after serving as the state's governor for two terms. Nelson, considered the most conservative Democrat in the Senate, is the lone Democrat in Nebraska's Congressional delegation. This election was one of the most expensive in Nebraska history. In 2005, Ben Nelson raised $3.9 million for his re-election campaign. [[Pete Ricketts]] contributed $14.35 million of his own money to his campaign; he raised an additional $485,000 in contributions. The race also attracted national attention and generated several high-level campaign appearances. President [[George W. Bush]] appeared at a rally for Ricketts on November 5, 2006, in [[Grand Island, Nebraska|Grand Island]], while then-U.S. Senator [[Barack Obama]] appeared at a fundraiser for Nelson and other Nebraska Democrats on May 5, 2006 in [[Omaha]]. However, he won re-election by a wide margin.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8451">The '''''Wage Earner Protection Program Act''''' (S.C. 2005, c. 47, s.1),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ''Wage Earner Protection Program Act''| url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/W-0.8/index.html | accessdate = 2012-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the ''Act'') is an Act of the [[Parliament of Canada]]. It was part of a package of reforms to the [[insolvency law of Canada]] that were brought into force in 2008 and 2009  to compensate employees of companies made [[bankrupt]] or placed into [[receivership]] under the ''[[Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Summary of Key Legislative Changes in Chapter 47 of the Statutes of Canada, 2005, and Chapter 36 of the Statutes of Canada, 2007|url = http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/bsf-osb.nsf/eng/br01782.html| accessdate = 2012-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was subsequently expanded in 2011 to cover employees who lose their jobs when their employer's attempt at restructuring subsequently ends in bankruptcy or receivership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Recent legislative changes to the WEPP|url = http://www.servicecanada.gc.ca/eng/sc/wepp/changes_wepp.shtml| accessdate = 2012-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

The issue of fairness with respect to employees terminated as a result of business failures was addressed by the [[Parliament of Canada]] as early as 1949, when the ''Bankruptcy Act'' was amended to provide a limited preferred creditor status to such claims. From 1975, legislative proposals were actively considered for the establishment of a wage protection scheme in the event of  the bankruptcy, liquidation or receivership of an employer. The various options discussed for how this could be achieved included:

:* super priority for wage claims,;
:* recognition of existing provincial/territorial priorities within the ''BIA'' framework,
:* a waiver of the waiting period for employment insurance benefits, and
:* a wage earner protection fund financed either out of general tax revenues or as part of the [[employment insurance]] regime.

In November 2003, the Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce reviewed the history of these discussions and recommended that the option for super priority status be adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = DEBTORS AND CREDITORS SHARING THE BURDEN: A Review of the ''Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act'' and the ''Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act''|url = http://www.parl.gc.ca/Content/SEN/Committee/372/bank/rep/bankruptcy-e.pdf|publisher = Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce|pages = 87–99|date = November 2003|accessdate = 2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the ''BIA'' was accordingly amended and the ''WEPPA'' enacted. These provisions did not immediately come into force, as several technical amendments needed to be passed in 2007. The ''Act'' came into force on 7 July 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Wage Earner Protection Program in Force, July 7, 2008|url = http://www.gardiner-roberts.com/documents/WEPP%20in%20force.pdf|accessdate = 2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wage Earner Protection Program framework==

The WEPP is administered by [[Human Resources and Skills Development Canada]], drawing on reports submitted by trustees and receivers of employers undergoing restructuring, bankruptcy or receivership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Wage Earner Protection Program|url = http://www.servicecanada.gc.ca/eng/sc/wepp/index.shtml|accessdate = 2012-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Program, payouts are made to eligible employees who earned eligible wages during a specified eligibility period, and such payments constitute (in part) a "super-priority" upon the employer's current assets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-62.html ''Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act'', s. 81.3]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-63.html ''Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act'', s. 81.4]&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Eligible employees'' are those whose employer has declared bankruptcy or has been placed into receivership, except those who:
:* were an officer or a director of the former employer
:* had a controlling interest in the business of the former employer
:* were a manager whose responsibilities included making binding financial decisions impacting the business of the former employer, and/or making binding decisions on the payment or non payment of wages by the former employer, or
:* were not dealing at arm's length with any of these persons&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Am I eligible for the WEPP?|url = http://www.servicecanada.gc.ca/eng/sc/wepp/apply/who.shtml|accessdate = 2012-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Eligible wages'' are:
:*Salaries, commissions, compensation for services rendered, vacation pay, gratuities accounted for by the employer, disbursements of a travelling salesperson properly incurred in and about the business of the former employer, production bonuses and shift premiums that were earned during the eligibility period preceding the bankruptcy or receivership, and
:*Severance pay and termination pay for employment that ended in the eligibility period preceding the bankruptcy or receivership.&lt;ref name = "Wage"&gt;{{Cite web|title = What are eligible wages under the WEPP?|url = http://www.servicecanada.gc.ca/eng/sc/wepp/apply/wages.shtml|accessdate = 2012-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''eligibility period'' starts six months before a restructuring event and ends on the date of bankruptcy or receivership. If the employer did not go through restructuring, the eligibility period is the six-month period ending on the date of bankruptcy or receivership.&lt;ref name = "Wage" /&gt;
* The maximum amount that an eligible individual may receive is equal to four weeks of insurable [[Employment Insurance]] (EI) earnings. In 2016, the maximum equals $3,807.68.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How much will I receive?|url = http://www.servicecanada.gc.ca/eng/sc/wepp/payment/howmuch.shtml|accessdate = 2012-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To the extent of the payments made, the WEPP is [[subrogation|subrogated]] to any claims for wages an employee may have against:
:* the bankrupt or insolvent employer, and
:* where the employer is a corporation, any of its directors&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/W-0.8/page-7.html#h-13 ''WEPPA'', s. 36]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy over scope and effect of WEPPA==

As the ''Act'' only covers wage claims that arise upon bankruptcy or receivership, it does not figure in proceedings conducted only under the ''[[Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act]]''.

The phrase "compensation for services rendered" in the definition for "eligible wages" was held by the [[British Columbia Supreme Court]] in 2009 to include other amounts that were earned by the employee and which were directed to be paid to a third party pursuant to a contract covering the employee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcsc/doc/2009/2009bcsc41/2009bcsc41.html ''Ted Leroy Trucking Ltd. and 383838 B.C. Ltd. (Re.)'', 2009 BCSC 41 (CanLII)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ted LeRoy Trucking Ltd. and 383838 B.C. Ltd. - Monitor's Ninth report to Court and Receiver's Second report to Court|url = http://www.pwc.com/ca/en/car/tedleroy/assets/tedleroy-45_042111.pdf|publisher = [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]]|accessdate = 2012-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = EMPLOYEE SUPER-PRIORITY UNDER THE WEPPA AND THE BIA: Comments on ''Ted LeRoy Trucking Ltd. and 383838 B.C. Ltd. (Re)''|url = http://www.fmc-law.com/upload/en/publications/2009/Employee_SuperPriority_Under_the_WEPPA_and_BIA.pdf|author = Mary I.A. Buttery, Cindy Cheuk|publisher = [[Fraser Milner Casgrain]]|accessdate = 2012-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ruling was upheld in 2010 by the [[British Columbia Court of Appeal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcca/doc/2010/2010bcca223/2010bcca223.html ''Ted Leroy Trucking Ltd. v. Century Services Inc.'', 2010 BCCA 223 (CanLII)]&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been argued that the WEPPA may also have the counterintuitive effect of reducing manufacturing employment in Canada through [[automation]] and [[offshoring]] of processes, as well as restricting financing that could be available to manufacturers, because of the super-priority nature of the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = WEPPA: Wage Protection for Employees, Credit Constriction for Employers|url = http://www.bdo.ca/library/publications/articles/manufacturing/WEPPA120808.cfm|author = Matthew Lem|publisher = [[BDO Dunwoody]]|accessdate = 2012-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
