'''Abdullah Al Muti Sharfuddin''' ({{lang-bn|আব্দুল্লাহ আল মুতী}} ''Abdullah Al Muti Sharfuddin'', January 1, 1930 &amp;ndash; November 30, 1998), mostly known as "Abdullah Al Muti" was a Bangladeshi educationist and popular science writer.&lt;ref name=bpedia&gt;Sajahan Miah, [http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Sharafuddin,_Abdullah_Al-Muti Sharafuddin, Abdullah Al-Muti], ''[[Banglapedia]]: The National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh'', [[Asiatic Society]] of Bangladesh, [[Dhaka]], Retrieved: August 3, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote tough scientific ideas in an easy fashion suitable for children and teenagers. This writing style brought him fame as a pioneer of science writing in Bengali. He is the first Bangladeshi writer who has won UNESCO Kalingo prize.

==Early life==
Born in a village in [[Sirajgonj]] district, Muti was the eldest among five sons and six daughters of Sheikh Moin Shorfuddin and Halima Shrfuddin. In 1945, attending matriculation (presently SSC) from Muslim High School, Dhaka he placed second in Kolkata board.&lt;ref name="www.priyo.com"&gt;[http://www.priyo.com/people/9404 ''www.priyo.com''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150912044657/http://www.priyo.com/people/9404 |date=2015-09-12 }}, retrieved August 12, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later he passes IA exam (presently HSC) and got admitted in Dhaka University. He completed his B.Sc and M.Sc. in Physics standing first class first in 1952 and 1953 respectively. Then he got a scholarship from US government and went to University of Chicago, Illinois. There he accomplished MA(education) and PhD(education) in 1960 and 1962 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=115282 ''http://archive.thedailystar.net''], November 24, 2009, retrieved August 12, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Abdullah-Al-Muti started his career as a lecturer in Physics at the Rajshahi Government College in 1954. He became Professor in the same college in 1955. He held the post Director, Education Extension Center, Dhaka from 1965 to 1973. He also assumed office as Education and Culture Councilor at different foreign embassies of Bangladesh, Joint Secretary, Additional Secretary and Secretary at Education and Science Ministry at different times. After his retirement in 1986, he was the chief adviser of Secondary Scientific Education Program financed by ADB and UNDP. Besides he also presented several science related popular programs in radio and television.

Muti started writing on science since his school days. At that time he contributed articles to the Dainik Azad ('Mukuler Mahfil') and Monthly Mohammadi. He was also associated with editing tabloid magazines named 'Mukul' and 'Mukul Fouz'. Besides, he also wrote about prospects of education in the Monthly 'Hullor' and 'Dilruba.

The prominent writer authored 27 books on science and education. He also translated 10 books from English into Bengali. He was the Executive Editor of Unesco Batayan, a quarterly Bengali edition of Unesco Courier from 1982 to until his death.

'''Afitti''' (also known as Dinik, Ditti, or Unietti) &lt;ref name="ethno"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ethnologue: Languages of the World|year=2009|publisher=SIL International|location=Dallas, Texas|edition=sixteenth|editor=Paul M. Lewis|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=aft}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a language spoken on the eastern side of Jebel el-Dair, a solitary rock formation in the [[North Kurdufan|North Kordofan]] province of [[Sudan]]. Although the term ‘Dinik’ &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stevenson|first=Robert C|title=The Nuba People of Kordofan Province. An Ethnographic Survey|year=1984|publisher=Ithaca Press|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  can be used to designate the language regardless of cultural affiliation, people in the villages of the region readily recognize the terms ‘Ditti’ and ‘Afitti.’ There are approximately 4000 speakers of the Afitti language and its closest linguistic neighbor is the [[Nyimang language]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacDiarmid|first=P.A.|author2=D.N. MacDiarmid|title=The Languages of the Nuba Mountains|journal=Sudan Notes and Records|year=1931|volume=14|pages=159–162}}&lt;/ref&gt; spoken west of Jebel el-Dair in the Nuba Mountains of the [[South Kordofan]] province of Sudan.

==History==
The Afitti live to the east of Jebel el-Dair. They previously resided at the base of the mountain, but after [[World War I]] increasing numbers of cattle and overcrowding drove them down the mountain to the plain where they resettled on farms. As a result of these movements the towns of Kitra in the north, Kundukur in the east, and Sidra towards the south were established. Because of an increase in the number of cattle, a separate group was forced to settle at the foot of Jebel Dambir, further northeastwards. Cattle herders from Sidra settled to the southwest of Dambir and those from Kitra to the northeast. Today, the people of Kitra are known as “Ditti” while the others are known as "Afitti", but the dialects have only minor lexical differences between them.

When a drought struck the country in 1984, the majority of the cattle herders lost their livestock and became farmers; consequently, Afitti and Ditti speakers no longer herd cattle. In the 1950s, when [[Islam]] entered the area, the process of conversion began and today all speakers of Afitti are considered [[Muslim]]. [[Arabic Language|Arabic]] has become the main language of communication, especially for the Afitti speakers; the local school also uses Arabic for teaching.The change of occupation for the cattle herders, the modernization in Sidra, and the overall dominance of Arabic have combined to reduce the overall importance of Afitti as well as decreasing speaker proficiency. Loanwords pervade the language, and it is only the Ditti who raise their children until school-going age without the use of Arabic.

==Phonology==

=== Vowels ===
The table below illustrates the vowels of Afitti; the symbols in parentheses represent prominent allophones of the phoneme beside which they appear.&lt;ref name="de Voogt" /&gt;
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|-
!  !! [[Front vowel|Front]] !! [[Central vowel|Central]] !! [[Back vowel|Back]] 
|-
![[Close vowel|High]]
| i (ɩ/ɨ) ||  || u (ʊ) 
|-
![[Mid vowel|Mid]]
| e (ɛ) || ə || o (ɔ)
|-
![[Open vowel|Low]]
| f|| ɑ (a) ||  
|}

Afitti has six vowels that have an allophonic variation that is mostly predicted by the syllable structure. Vowels are relatively short in Afitti with occasional lengthening occurring in stressed syllables. Furthermore, vowels are shorter in closed syllables than they are in open syllables. In closed syllables, vowels become open and sometimes centralized.&lt;ref name="dual"&gt;{{cite journal|last=de Voogt|first=Alex|title=Dual Marking and Kinship Terms in Afitti|journal=Studies in Language|year=2011|volume=35|issue=4|pages=898–911|doi=10.1075/sl.35.4.04dev}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[schwa]], however, is always short and limited in distribution, never being found in word-final position.&lt;ref name="de Voogt" /&gt; It remains short when the syllable is stressed and in such cases the consonant that follows it may be [[Gemination|geminated]]. 	

Combinations of two vowels are common in Afitti and include combinations where the second vowel is schwa. There are no clear (level) [[diphthong]]s and the vowels are given individual tones that can be analyzed as part of different syllables. Sequences of three or more vowels were not found within the confines of one word.

|}Afitti has nasals and plosives at four places of articulation: alveolar, bilabial, velar, and palatal. The plosives have a voicing contrast primarily found in word-initial position. This distinction is mostly lost in intervocalic position with neutralization in favor of the voiced variant. The majority of plosives are voiceless in final position due to a devoicing process affecting other sounds as well.

No words begin with a [[voiceless bilabial stop]] and final voiceless stops are often unreleased, but these variants occur in free variation with a released [[allophone]]. [[Alveolar stop|Alveolar]] and [[dental stop]]s also appear in free variation. The dental variant appears with some speakers if they wish to stress the consonant that is being pronounced. Nasals occur in all positions, including as syllabic nasals.&lt;ref name="de Voogt"&gt;{{cite journal|last=de Voogt|first=Alex|title=A Sketch of Afitti Phonology|journal=Studies in African Linguistics|year=2009|volume=38|issue=1|pages=35–52|url=http://elanguage.net/journals/sal/article/download/794/683}}&lt;/ref&gt; They usually assimilate to a following consonant. When a word-initial [[velar nasal]] follows a word-final, [[voiceless velar stop]], the stop will be unreleased and voiced. The [[Liquid consonant|liquids]] /l/ and /r/, like the plosives, tend to become devoiced in word-final position. For both /l/ and /r/ their devoiced allophones can be easily mistaken for a fricative because of the heavy airflow. Like the nasals, the liquids have a syllabic variant. The syllabic /r/ is common in the language and is found in monosyllabic words as well as in word-final position. The syllabic /l/, on the other hand, is rare and unattested in word-initial position. As a consonant the central resonant /r/, as opposed to /l/, however, is not found in word- initial position and changes to a [[retroflex flap]] intervocalically.&lt;ref name="de Voogt" /&gt; Whenever /r/ occurs in word-initial position, it is in words clearly borrowed words from Arabic and other languages. The allophonic flap and /l/ are easily confused but the flap can also be found immediately following a consonant (and preceding a vowel), a position where /l/ is absent, one of the rare cases where a sequence of consonants can be found.&lt;ref name="de Voogt" /&gt; The lateral liquid is found in word-initial, intervocalic and word-final position and is slightly palatalized. This palatalization leads to a slightly fricated voiceless palatal release with some speakers when it is in word-final position.

The fricatives /s/ and /f/ are usually voiceless but, in some instances, vary with their voiced counterparts. They occur word initially and intervocalically, but only loanwords possess the fricatives in word-final position. The /s/ is sometimes palatalized (realized as [ʃ]) before the high front vowel /i/.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bender|first=Lionel M.|title=Roland Stevenson’s Nyimang and Dinik Lexicon|journal=Afrikanistische Arbeitspapiere|year=2000|volume=63|pages=103–120}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Tone and Stress===
Afitti is a tone language with stress.&lt;ref name="de Voogt" /&gt; Tonal minimal pairs are attested for monosyllabic, bisyllabic, and trisyllabic words. In longer, however, words stress seems to play a more important role. The stressed syllable is marked by a combination of volume, duration and change in tone, rather than just tone alone. Afitti has only two phonemic tones&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kauczor|first=Daniel|author2=Albert Drexel|title=Die Daiersprache in Kordofan|journal=Bibliotheca Africana|year=1930|volume=4|issue=1|pages=67–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;  with clear and strong downdrift, with no third tone or even downstep. The shortening of syllables ending in /r/ has led to many words that have an intervocalic flap following a schwa or a syllabic /r/. The schwa is omitted altogether by some speakers reducing the word by one syllable and possibly eliminating a tone.&lt;ref name="de Voogt" /&gt; When this reduction occurs, one tone is assimilated to the neighboring tone, keeping the tonal pattern intact.

===Syllable Structure===
Afitti has both closed and open syllables.&lt;ref name="de Voogt" /&gt; Syllables may be closed with a liquid, a nasal or a stop. Single-segment syllables may consist of a (syllabic) liquid, a (syllabic) nasal, or a vowel. Syllables include combinations of vowel and consonant but there are few consonant clusters. Nasals that precede consonants are always syllabic – there are no nasal-consonant sequences or prenasalized segments. Liquids that follow fricatives or consonants are preceded by a schwa for most speakers, but in many cases are realized (exceptionally) as consonant clusters. There are no tautosyllabic consonants that follow liquids or fricatives and nasals do not follow other consonants. Words usually contain one, two or three syllables, but verbs may contain as many as eight or more.&lt;ref name="de Voogt" /&gt;

==Grammar==

===Morphology===
Afitti can tentatively be defined as an agglutinative [[Subject–object–verb|SOV]] language with postpositions.&lt;ref name="dual" /&gt; Plural marking on adjectives and nouns take the form of a suffix. Plural marking in verbs is found for both objects and subjects. Plural forms of verbs without a verbal plural marker are translated as duals. Afitti has no definite or indefinite articles and gender marking also seems to be absent. All of these characteristics are common both geographically and within the Eastern Sudanic language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thelwall|first=Robin|author2=Thilo C. Schadeberg|title=The linguistic settlement of the Nuba mountains.|journal=Sprache und Geschichte in Afrika|year=1983|volume=5|pages=219–231}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the exception of Nyimang, the differentiation between dual and plural is particular to Afitti.&lt;ref name="dual" /&gt;

===Kinship Terms===
The Afitti kinship terms have specific possessive pronouns and in the case of ‘father’ and ‘mother’, there is a separate set of dual forms. This set is also found when speaking, plurally, of ‘mothers and ‘fathers’. Other kinship terms, namely ‘son’, ‘sibling’ and ‘mother- in-law’, also have a set of dual forms but lose this distinction when speaking, plurally, of ‘sons’, ‘siblings’ and ‘mothers-in-law’. All other terms, including ‘daughter’, ‘father- in-law’, ‘husband’, ‘wife’ and ‘(paternal or maternal) uncle’ do not or no longer distinguish dual from plural forms.&lt;ref name="dual" /&gt; The dual is mainly formed by way of morpheme or word order. More specifically, in the case of ‘father’ and ‘mother,’ the dual seems to be created by inversing the order of possessive pronoun and kinship term.

==Afitti and Meroitic==
The Afitti language may help scholars to better understand texts in [[Meroitic alphabet|Meroitic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rilly|first=Claude|title=The Meroitic Language and Writing System|year=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|author2=Alex de Voogt}}&lt;/ref&gt; a script whose sounds can be deciphered but whose meanings remain unclear. In the last few years, some linguists have come to the opinion that ancient Meroitic shares a history with a number of languages still spoken today. According to French archaeologist Claude Rilly, Meroitic belongs part of the Nilo-Saharan language group, and has particular affinities with that group’s North Eastern Sudanic branch which comprises a handful of languages spoken in Chad, Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Sudan.

[[File:Bannwald BaWue Schild.jpg|thumb|Information sign]]
'''''Bannwald''''' is a German word used in parts of Germany and Austria to designate an area of protected forest. Its precise meaning has varied by location and over time.

== Etymology ==
The word ''Bannwald'' is a combination of ''Bann'' (English ''ban'') and ''Wald'' (English ''forest'' or ''wood''). ''Bann'' has many historical meanings in German, one of which refers to an area controlled by and set aside for the use of a landowner in medieval times (comparable to the forests subject to the royal ban in Anglo-Saxon England).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[John Mitchell Kemble]]|title=The Saxons in England: A History of the English Commonwealth Till the Period of the Norman Conquest|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aGGZGJBRT-8C&amp;pg|date=1849|publisher=[[Longman]]|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''Bannwald'' was a forest where a nobleman had the prerogative to make use of it and the creatures in it.&lt;ref name="Forestry"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alexander Porteous|title=The Forest in Folklore and Mythology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UZyjAQAAQBAJ|date=1928|publisher=[[Courier Dover Publications]]|isbn=978-0486420103|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; A royal ban forest existed at Dreieich (from the heathen worship of three oaks) for a very long period, and its charter was one of the most primitive.&lt;ref name="Forestry"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Jacob Grimm]]|title=Teutonic Mythology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I2WhHX2peKEC|date=1835|publisher=[[Nabu Press]]|isbn=978-1171888192|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; The (obsolete) [[French language|French]] literal equivalent [[:fr:bambois (toponyme)|''bambois'']] (also: ''banbois'')&lt;ref&gt;[[University of Lorraine]]: [http://docnum.univ-lorraine.fr/public/DDOC_T_2012_0207_TAVELLA_ANNEXES.pdf Page 9, Glossaire: Bambois, Banbois]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henry Suter: [http://henrysuter.ch/glossaires/topoB0.html Toponymes: Baimbo, Bambois, Banbois]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Courrendlin]]: [http://www.courrendlin.ch/fr/Vivre-a-Courrendlin/Geographie/Lieux-dits/Lieux-dits.html Lieux-dits - Le Bambois: Forêt réservée et mise à ban]&lt;/ref&gt; is still the toponym of local forests&lt;ref&gt;Tous les Faits: [http://tous-les-faits.fr/bambois_(toponyme) Bambois (toponyme)]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205051047/http://tous-les-faits.fr/bambois_%28toponyme%29 |date=December 5, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in areas which once were part of the former [[Holy Roman Empire]].

In modern times, the term ''Bannwald'' is, in a certain sense, an archaic word which has been revived as a specific term for forests under various types of protection.

== Scope ==
The term is generally used with a rather broad meaning:
* ''[[Protection forest]]'', for the protection against avalanches, [[rockfall]], [[mudflow]], or [[flooding]]
* ''[[Forest reserve]]'', forest areas protected for reasons of [[nature conservation]] and [[environmental protection]]
* ''[[Protected forest|Recreational forest]]'', sometimes also as [[recreation area]]

Depending on the respective forest act, there may be an overlapping or difference in meaning between the terms ''banned forest'' and ''protection forest''.

== Function ==
[[File:Sebalder Reichswald Bannwald-Denkmal 001.JPG|thumb|Banned forest monument in the imperial forest of Nuremberg]]

[[Silvicultural]] use is still permitted and in the case of protection forests it is even welcome (except in [[Baden-Württemberg]]). However, it is prohibited in the core zones of [[nature reserves in Germany|nature reserves]]. ''[[exclusion zone|Forestal exclusion zones]]'' (temporarily restricted forest areas) subject to hunting prohibitions or restrictions, or temporary ''[[hunting|hunting grounds]]'' or ''[[game preserve]]s'' (areas closed during a [[hunting season]] or [[breeding season|breeding and upbringing season]]) are not classified as banned forests.

== History ==

The term ''Bann'' dates back to the [[Middle Ages]]. At that time a ''Bannwald'' referred to a forest area where the respective [[territorial lord]] had the exclusive right to use the forest (''forest privilege''). Originally this applied only to hunting (''hunting privilege'') and fishing, however, later it was extended to the complete use of the forest. In the mountain valleys of [[Switzerland]] banned forests had the function to protect against avalanches and also to provide sufficient timber for [[fencing]] torrents. Corresponding decrees from the 14th century deal with protection against avalanches, rockfalls and flooding. The concept of ''Bannwald'' plays an important part in [[Ludwig Ganghofer]]'s novel ''Die Martinsklause'' in which a tyrannical administrator in [[Berchtesgaden]] claims excessive privileges.

== Countries ==

=== Germany ===

==== Baden-Württemberg ====
[[Image:Bannwald BaWue Schlattstall.JPG|thumb|Banned forest with footpath in Baden-Württemberg]]
→ ''see also: [[:de:Liste der Bannwälder in Baden-Württemberg|List of Bannwälder in Baden-Württemberg]]''

In Baden-Württemberg, there are ''Bannwälder Totalreservate'', fully protected reserves where any use is strictly prohibited by law. In other federal states of Germany such ''total reserves'' are known under different names. Due to their structural diversity in living trees and dry wood banned forests are [[refugium (population biology)|refugia]] for many endangered species of animals, plants, and mushrooms.

==== Bavaria ====
In [[Bavaria]] "forest and its existence and size is extremely essential in particular in densely populated and sparsely wooded areas and consequently its size and structure must be preserved as it is of extraordinary importance for the climate, water resources or for air purification" and may be classified as banned forest."&lt;ref name=BayWald&gt;[https://archive.is/20130106012238/http://www.servicestelle.bayern.de/bayern_recht/recht_db.html?http://by.juris.de/by/WaldG_BY_2005_Art38.htm Bavarian Forestry Act of July 22, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hessen ====
[[Image:Bannwald rockenberg4.jpg|thumb|Information sign in [[Rockenberg]] (Hesse)]]
In [[Hesse]] a ''Bannwald'' is a forest which because of its location, size and extraordinary importance for hydrological balance, climate and air purification has to be preserved and may be cut only in exceptional cases.

=== Austria ===
In Austria, a ''Bannwald'' is a stricter form of a protection forest.&lt;ref&gt;Article 21 et seq. of the 1975 Forestry Act.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Switzerland ===
The Swiss Forestry Act of 1874 uses the term, '''''Schutzwald''''' ([[protection forest]]), rather than ''Bannwald''.

A '''battle cry''' is a yell or chant taken up in [[battle]], usually by members of the same combatant group.
Battle cries are not necessarily articulate (e.g. "Eliaaaa!", "Alala"..), although they often aim to invoke patriotic or religious sentiment. Their purpose is a combination of arousing aggression and [[esprit de corps]] on one's own side and causing intimidation on the hostile side. Battle cries are a universal form of [[display behaviour]] (i.e., [[threat display]]) aiming at [[competitive advantage]], ideally by overstating one's own aggressive potential to a point where the enemy prefers to avoid confrontation altogether and opts to flee. In order to overstate one's potential for aggression, battle cries need to be as loud as possible, and have historically often been amplified by acoustic devices such as [[Blowing horn|horns]], drums, [[conch]]es, [[carnyx]]es, [[bagpipe]]s, [[bugle (instrument)|bugle]]s, etc. (see also [[martial music]]).

Battle cries are closely related to other behavioral patterns of [[human aggression]], such as [[war dance]]s and taunting, performed during the "warming up" phase preceding the escalation of physical violence. From the [[Middle Ages]], many cries appeared on standards and were adopted as [[motto]]es, an example being the motto "[[Dieu et mon droit]]" ("God and my right") of the English kings. It is said that this was [[Edward III of England|Edward III]]'s rallying cry during the [[Battle of Crécy]]. The word "[[slogan]]" originally derives from ''sluagh-gairm'' or ''sluagh-ghairm'' (''sluagh'' = "people", "army", and ''gairm'' = "call", "proclamation"), the [[Scottish Gaelic]] word for "gathering-cry" and in times of war for "battle-cry". The Gaelic word was borrowed into English as ''slughorn'', ''sluggorne'', "slogum", and ''slogan''.

==History==

===Antiquity===

* The war cry is an aspect of epic battle in [[Homer]]: in the ''[[Iliad]]'', [[Diomedes]] is conventionally called "Diomedes of the loud war cry." [[Hellenes]] and [[Akkadians]] alike uttered the [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] cry ''"[[alala]]"'' in battle.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Burkert|Burkert, Walter]], 1992. ''The Orientalizing Revolution: Near Eastern Influences on Greek Culture in the Early Archaic Age'', p 39f.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The troops of ancient [[Athens]], during the [[Greco-Persian Wars|Medic Wars]] and the [[Peloponnesian War]] were noted for going into battle shouting "''Alala or [[Alale]]!''", which was supposed to emulate the cry of the owl, the bird of their patron goddess [[Athena]].&lt;ref&gt;Per Hesiod, Penguin Edition of Works and Days&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Western Huns]] attacked with terrifying battle cries.&lt;ref&gt;T.J. Craughwell, 2008, ''The Vikings, Vandals, Huns, Mongols, Goths, and Tartars who Razed the Old World and Formed the New'', Fair Winds Press, p. 41, {{ISBN|978-1-59233-303-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*One of the common [[Hindu]] war cries was "Har Har Mahadev" meaning either ''Everyone is [[Shiva|Mahadev]]'' or ''Mahadev takes sorrows away''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.krazylyrics.in/2016/09/21/har-har-mahadev-meaning-english/|title=HAR HAR MAHADEV MEANING – English Translations and Meaning of hindi songs – KrazyLyrics|date=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A common war cry used in ancient [[Tamilakam]] was "Vetrivel, Veeravel" (Victorious Vel, Courageous Vel). [[Vel]] is the holy lance of the Hindu god of war [[Murugan]].&lt;ref&gt;Kalki R. Krishnamurthy's Ponniyin Selvan: The first floods,Macmillan India Limited, 1 January 2000, p. 300&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===
{{Heraldic achievement}}
* Each Turkic tribe and tribal union had its distinct [[Tamga]] (seal), totemic ''[[Ongon]]'' bird, and distinct ''Uran'' (battle cry) (hence the Slavic ''Urah'' "battle cry").&lt;ref&gt;Shipova E.N., 1976, ''Dictionary of Türkisms in Russian Language'', Alma-Ata, "Science", p. 349&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dal V.I., ''Explanatory Dictionary of the Live Great Russian language'', vol. 4, p. 507, Diamant, Sankt Peterburg, 1998 (reprint of 1882 edition by M.O.Wolf Publisher), (''In Russian'')&lt;/ref&gt; While tamgas and ''ongons'' could be distinct down to individuals, the hue of horses and ''uran'' battle cries belonged to each tribe, were passed down from generation to generation, and some modern battle cries were recorded in antiquity. On split of the tribe, their unique distinction passed to a new political entity, endowing different modern states with the same ''uran'' battle cries of the split tribes, for example [[Kipchak people|Kipchak]] battle cry among [[Kazakhs]], [[Kyrgyz people|Kirgizes]], [[Turkmens]], and [[Uzbeks]]. Some larger tribes' ''uran'' battle cries:

Another early translation, of the 23rd Psalm, made by an indigenous Tlingit, when back-translated, read "The Lord is my goat-hunter; I don't want him. He knocks me down on the mountains, he drags me down to the beach ... ".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sil.org/resources/archives/6595|title=The Lord is my goat hunter|date=2013-01-24|newspaper=SIL International|access-date=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Constance Naish and Gillian Story, both of [[Wycliffe Bible Translators]], translated John's gospel into Tlingit—this was published in 1969 as ''Dikée ankáwoo doo yéet dàt John-ch kawshixidee yooxu̕tunk''.

A few selected verses from both testaments were translated for their hymnal ''Utk'-uheenee X'usheex'ee. They also produced a 17-page booklet "The Brass serpent and other stories", containing stories from the Old Testament.

Andrew P. Johnson translated parts of the Bible into Tlingit and recorded it on tapes that he then distributed.&lt;ref&gt;*{{citation|last1=Black|first1=Lydia T.|author1-link=Lydia T.

George Benson also translated parts of the Bible into Tlingit. Walter Soboleff, a Tlingit elder, said of him, "He could open the Bible and make a free translation of English into the Tlingit language ... And he could do it so beautifully."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sitnews.us/Kiffer/Soboleff/021611_Soboleff.html|title=SitNews: Native Rights Leader Turns 102 By DAVE KIFFER|last=SitNews|website=www.sitnews.us|access-date=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benson, and perhaps Johnson, could have been working together with the Wycliffe Translators.

'''Bunga bunga''' is a phrase of uncertain origin and various meanings that dates from 1910, and a name for an area of Australia dating from 1852. By 2010 the phrase had gained popularity in Italy and the international press to refer to former Italian Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]]'s [[Silvio Berlusconi underage prostitution charges|sex parties]], which caused a major political scandal in Italy.

== Early use ==
An 1852 issue of ''[[James Hogg (publisher)|Hogg's Instructor]]'' states that "bunga bunga" is the name given by locals to a location near [[Moreton Bay]] on the eastern coast of Australia.&lt;ref&gt;"Popular botany: The pine and the palm", ''Hogg's Instructor'' vol.&amp;nbsp;9 (Edinburgh, 1852), [https://books.google.com/books?id=e6LNAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA411#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.&amp;nbsp;411].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1910 [[Horace de Vere Cole]], [[Virginia Woolf]], her brother [[Adrian Stephen]] and a small group of friends, pretended to be the Prince of Abyssinia and his entourage. They obtained permission to visit one of the world's most powerful warships [[HMS Dreadnought (1906)|HMS ''Dreadnought'']] in [[Weymouth, Dorset]], in what became known as the [[Dreadnought hoax|''Dreadnought'' hoax]]. It was reported that each time the Commander showed them a marvel of the ship, they murmured the phrase ''bunga, bunga!''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/hoax/archive/permalink/dreadnought_hoax/ "The Dreadnought Hoax"], ''Museum of Hoaxes''. Retrieved 24 January 2011. This anonymous article cites Adrian Stephen, ''The Dreadnought Hoax'' (Hogarth Press, 1983).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=On or about December 1910: early Bloomsbury and its intimate world | volume=8 | series=Studies in cultural history| first=Peter | last=Stansky | publisher=Harvard University Press | year=1997 | isbn=0-674-63606-6 | page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; which then became a popular [[Catch phrase|catchphrase]] of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Bloomsbury group: a collection of memoirs and commentary | first=Stanford Patrick | last=Rosenbaum | publisher=University of Toronto Press | year=1995 | isbn=0-8020-7640-8 | page=13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adrian Stephen, had this to say about the phrase:
{{quote| ...one of the newspapers published an interview.  I think it was supposed to be with one of the assistants at Clarksons, who professed to know a great deal more than he did, and in particular stated that we used the expression "Bunga-Bunga".  Anyhow the words "Bunga-Bunga" became public catchwords for a time, and were introduced as tag in music-hall songs and so forth.  Apparently the Admiral was unable to go ashore without having them shouted after him in the streets, and I suppose the other officers were treated in the same way.&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Stephen, ''The Dreadnought Hoax, page 51, 1983 reissue.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A 1950 Bugs Bunny short "[[Bushy Hare]]" used the phrase "Unga Bunga Bunga" in a nonsensical exchange between Bugs Bunny and a character who represented an Australian Aborigine and who was referred to as "Nature Boy".&lt;ref&gt;IMDB. "Bushy Hare"  https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042291/{{unreliable source?|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Malay-speaking countries bunga means flower. As such bunga bunga (written as bunga-bunga) is simply the plural form of flower.  Possibly, [[Makassan contact with Australia]] can explain the existence of the word within the Australian Aborigines culture.

== Resurgence in Italy ==
[[File:Silvio Berlusconi (2010).jpg|thumb|upright|The term "Bunga Bunga" has been closely associated with former [[Prime Ministers of Italy|Italian Prime Minister]] [[Silvio Berlusconi]] in recent history.]]
A century later, the term ''bunga bunga'' became popular again as part of a joke on the internet.&lt;ref name=slate&gt;{{cite news|last=Palmer|first=Brian|title=What the Heck Is Bunga Bunga?|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2274429/|accessdate=16 February 2011|work=Slate|date=10 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="n"&gt;The joke had circulated in print with other "nonsense" words for some time, for example in 1996 "mamba" ({{Cite book|others=Ronald P. Hamel, Edwin R. DuBose (editors)|title=Must we suffer our way to death?: cultural and theological perspectives on death by choice|page=26|date=August 1996|publisher=Southern Methodist University Press|isbn=978-0-87074-392-4}}) and in 1993 "chi-chi" ({{Cite book|page=245|author=Colin Alexander|title=God's Adamantine Fate|date=1 September 1993|publisher=D.I. Fine|isbn=978-1-55611-371-0}})&lt;/ref&gt; This joke was then narrated by Italian Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]] at his dinner parties (in a version which featured, as prisoners, former ministers from the centre-left opposition party led by [[Romano Prodi]]).&lt;ref&gt;Angelo Agrippa, "[http://corrieredelmezzogiorno.corriere.it/napoli/notizie/politica/2009/28-aprile-2009/ecco-noemi-diciottenne-che-chiama-berlusconi-papi-1501304940417.shtml Ecco la bella Noemi, diciottenne che chiama Berlusconi «papi»] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328101157/http://corrieredelmezzogiorno.corriere.it/napoli/notizie/politica/2009/28-aprile-2009/ecco-noemi-diciottenne-che-chiama-berlusconi-papi-1501304940417.shtml |date=28 March 2014 }}", ''Corriere del Mezzogiorno'', 28 April 2009 (modified 7 May 2009). {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This expression was then frequently quoted by the Italian and international press during the 2011 investigation surrounding [[Silvio Berlusconi underage prostitution charges|Silvio Berlusconi's underage prostitution charges]], acquiring a quite different meaning as "an orgy involving a powerful leader"; it was allegedly taught to Silvio Berlusconi by [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]],&lt;ref&gt;Chase Madar, "[http://www.timeslive.co.za/sundaytimes/article839667.ece/Catholic-communist-gay Catholic, communist, gay]", ''Times'', 9 January 2011. Retrieved 18 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; who was also the unwitting originator of the phrase [[Zenga Zenga]].

In Italy, the term "has become an instant, supposedly hilarious, household expression".&lt;ref&gt;Maria Laura Rodotà, "[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/07/silvio-berlusconi-sex-antics Silvio Berlusconi's sex antics disgust me and other Italian women]", ''The Observer'', 7 November 2010. Retrieved 18 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent explanations disagree on its meaning, or perhaps illustrate the range of its reference. It "is said to be a sort of underwater orgy where nude young women allegedly encircled the nude host and/or his friends in his swimming pool",&lt;ref&gt;Barbie Latza Nadeau, "[http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-11-07/silvio-berlusconis-bunga-bunga-parties/ Will Berlusconi get the boot?]", ''Daily Beast'', 7 November 2010.

Retrieved 18 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative explanation for its origins was proposed by actress [[Sabina Began]], who claimed that it was a nickname based on her surname and that she had organized the parties.&lt;ref name="Kathryn Westcott"&gt;{{cite news

The lexicographer [[Jonathon Green]] does not expect the term to make much headway, or to last, in English.&lt;ref&gt;Thane Burnett, "[http://www.torontosun.com/news/columnists/thane_burnett/2011/01/20/16966401.html Academic charts expanding universe of slang]", ''[[Toronto Sun]],'' 20 January 2011. Retrieved 23 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bunga bunga culture sparked a social movement called "Se Non Ora Quando" in 2011, which included street protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Rawe|first1=Catherine|last2=Hipkins|first2=Danielle|title=Asia Argento, Harvey Weinstein and Italy's complex relationship with feminism|url=https://theconversation.com/asia-argento-harvey-weinstein-and-italys-complex-relationship-with-feminism-88496|accessdate=9 January 2018|work=The Conversation|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
In 2011, the faux-French, American band [[Nous Non Plus]] released a song entitled "Bunga Bunga".  The cover of the single featured a picture of Silvio Berlusconi.&lt;ref&gt;iTunes Music Store. "Bunga Bunga – Single"  https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/bunga-bunga-single/id462223591/&lt;/ref&gt;  The song lyrics list famous cities around the world (in French) while the video is a black and white show-reel of semi-nude dancing women.&lt;ref&gt;Come Into Land. "NOUS NON PLUS – “BUNGA BUNGA""  http://comeintoland.com/2013/05/22/nous-non-plus-bunga-bunga/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the term was used in the British motoring show ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'' in Season 18, Episode 1. It was used to describe [[The Stig]]'s Italian cousin, who emerged from a motor-home dressed in a suit, followed by three glamorous girls, to set a lap time in a [[Ferrari 458]] Italia at the [[Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari]] (Imola Circuit).

In 2013, the American band [[Cherry Poppin' Daddies]] used the term several times in the lyrics for their song "[[White Teeth, Black Thoughts|The Babooch]]", a satire of "[[We are the 99%|one-percenter]]" lifestyles.  The song's music video features clips of Berlusconi alongside other billionaire figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2013/07/02/cherry-poppin-daddies-video-premiere/2482461/ |title=Video premiere: Cherry Poppin' Daddies' 'The Babooch' |author=Mansfield, Brian |date=2 July 2013 |work=[[USA Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chilean Spanish''' ({{lang-es|español chileno}}, ''{{lang|es|español de Chile}}'' or ''{{lang|es|castellano de Chile}})'' is any of several varieties of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] spoken in most of [[Chile]]. Chilean Spanish dialects have distinctive pronunciation, grammar, vocabulary, and [[slang]] usage that differ from those of [[standard Spanish]].&lt;ref&gt;Miguel Ángel Bastenier, [http://internacional.elpais.com/internacional/2014/07/18/actualidad/1405706583_805924.html "Neologismos y barbarismos en el español de dos océanos"], ''[[El País]]'', 19 July 2014, retrieved 20 July 2014. "...el chileno es un producto genuino e inimitable por el resto del universo lingüístico del español."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variation and accents==
{{See also|Chilote Spanish|Cuyano Spanish}}
In Chile, there are not many differences between the Spanish spoken in the northern, central and southern areas of the country,&lt;ref name="Canfield 1981 31"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Canfield|1981|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; although there are notable differences in zones of the far south—such as [[Aysén Region|Aysén]], [[Magallanes y la Antártica Chilena Region|Magallanes]] (mainly along the border with Argentina), and [[Chiloé]]—and in [[Arica]] in the extreme north. There is, however, much variation in the Spanish spoken by different social classes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoamerica.org/documentos_pdf/bernstein05.pdf CLASES SOCIALES, LENGUAJE Y SOCIALIZACION ] Basil Bernstein, http://www.infoamerica.org/ retrieved June 25, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In rural areas from Santiago to Valdivia, Chilean Spanish shows the historical influence of the [[Castúo]] dialects of [[Extremadura]] (Spain),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vozdemitierra.wiki-site.com/index.php/CHILE |title=CHILE - Vozdemitierra |language=es |publisher=Vozdemitierra.wiki-site.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130209141516/http://vozdemitierra.wiki-site.com/index.php/CHILE |archivedate=2013-02-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paseovirtual.net/america/ |title=Extremadura en América - Diez mil extremeños - Biblioteca Virtual Extremeña |publisher=Paseovirtual.net |date= |accessdate=2013-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; but some authors point to the Spanish province of [[Andalusia]] and more specifically to the city of [[Seville]] as an even greater influence on the historical development of Chilean Spanish.

==Phonology==
There are a number of phonetic features common to most Chilean accents, but none of them is individually unique to Chilean Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cvc.cervantes.es/ensenanza/biblioteca_ele/asele/pdf/04/04_0553.pdf EL ESPAÑOL EN AMÉRICA] cvc.cervantes.e  - JESÚS SÁNCHEZ LOBATO - page 553-570&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, it is the particular combination of features that sets Chilean Spanish apart from other regional Spanish dialects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisischile.cl/1207/2/862/language-of-chile-chileanismos-castellano-and-indigenous-roots/Article.aspx Language of Chile: Chileanismos, Castellano and indigenous roots] www.thisischile.cl - February 22, 2011, retrieved August 08,2013&lt;/ref&gt; The features include the following:&lt;ref&gt;Lipski (1994: 199-201)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cvc.cervantes.es/obref/congresos/valladolid/ponencias/unidad_diversidad_del_espanol/2_el_espanol_de_america/saez_l.htm |title=El dialecto más austral del español: fonética del español de Chile |author=Sáez Godoy, Leopoldo |work=Unidad y divesidad del español, Congreso de Valladolid |publisher=Centro Virtual Cervantes |accessdate=2007-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Yeísmo]]'', the historical merger of the [[phoneme]] {{IPA|/ʎ/}} (spelled {{angbr|ll}}) with {{IPA|/ʝ/}} (spelled {{angbr|y}}). For speakers with ''yeísmo'', the verbs ''cayó'' 's/he fell' and ''calló'' 's/he fell silent' are [[homophone]]s, both pronounced {{IPA|[kaˈʝo]}}. (In dialects that lack ''yeísmo'', maintaining the historical distinction, the two words are pronounced respectively {{IPA|[kaˈʝo]}} and {{IPA|[kaˈʎo]}}.) ''Yeísmo'' characterizes the speech of most Spanish-speakers both in Spain and in the Americas. In Chile, there is a declining number of speakers who maintain the distinction, mainly in some Andean areas, south of Santiago.&lt;ref name="Canfield 1981 31"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Oroz|1966|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Like most other American dialects of Spanish, Chilean Spanish has [[seseo]]: {{IPA|/θ/}} is not distinguished from {{IPA|/s/}}. In much of the Andean region, the merged phoneme is pronounced as [[Apical consonant|apicoalveolar]] {{IPAblink|s̺}}, a sound with a [[place of articulation]] intermediate between [[Laminal consonant|laminodental]] {{IPAblink|s}} and [[Palatal consonant|palatal]] {{IPAblink|ʃ}}. That trait, unique in the Americas, is associated with a large number of northern Spanish settlers in Andean Chile.
*Syllable-final {{IPA|/s/}} is often aspirated to {{IPA|[h]}} or lost entirely, another feature common to many varieties of Spanish in the Americas, as well as the Canary Islands and the southern half of Spain. Whether final {{IPA|/s/}} aspirates or is elided depends on a number of social, regional, and phonological factors, but in general, aspiration is most frequent before a consonant. Complete elision is most commonly found word-finally but carries a sociolinguistic stigma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lipski|1994|p=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, ''los chilenos'' '(the) Chileans' can be {{IPA|[lɔh t͡ʃiˈleːnɔ]}}.
*The [[velar]] consonants {{IPA|/k/}}, {{IPA|/ɡ/}}, and {{IPA|/x/}} are fronted or [[palatalization (sound change)|palatalized]] before [[front vowel]]s. Thus, ''queso'' 'cheese', ''guía'' 'guide', and ''jinete'' 'rider/horseman' are pronounced respectively {{IPA|[ˈceːso]}}, {{IPA|[ˈɟi.a]}}, and {{IPA|[çiˈn̪eːt̪e]}}. Also, {{IPA|/x/}}, it is pronounced {{IPA|[h]}} or {{IPA|[x]}} in other phonological environments and so ''caja'' 'box' and ''rojo'' 'red' are pronounced {{IPA|[ˈkaxa]}} ~ {{IPA|[ˈkaha]}} and {{IPA|[ˈroxo]}} ~ {{IPA|[ˈroho]}} respectively.
*Between vowels and word-finally, {{IPA|/d/}} commonly elides or [[lenition|lenites]], as is common throughout the Spanish-speaking world); ''contado'' 'told' and ''ciudad'' 'city' are {{IPA|[kon̪ˈt̪aːo]}} and {{IPA|[sjuˈð̞aː]}} respectively. Elision is less common in formal or upper-class speech.
*The [[voiceless postalveolar affricate]] {{IPA|/t͡ʃ/}} is pronounced as a fricative {{IPA|[ʃ]}} by many lower-class speakers and so ''Chile'' and ''leche'' (milk) are pronounced {{IPA|[ˈʃiːle]}} and {{IPA|[ˈleʃe]}}, respectively). That pronunciation is greatly stigmatized. Other variants are more fronted and include the [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]] affricate {{IPA|[t͡s]}} or an even more fronted [[dental consonant|dental]] affricate {{IPAblink|t̪͡s̪}}, mostly in the upper class. Thus, ''Chile'' and ''leche'' are pronounced {{IPA|[ˈt͡siːle]}} or {{IPA|[ˈlet͡se]}}.
*Unstressed word-final vowels are often devoiced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lipski|1994|p=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Syntax and grammar ==

* Doubling the object clitics ''me'', ''te'', ''se'', ''lo(s)'', ''la(s)'' and ''le(s)'' before and after the verb is common in or lower-class speech. For example, 'I'm going to go' becomes ''me voy a ir'''me''''' (Standard Spanish: ''me voy a ir'' and ''voy a irme''). 'I'm going to give them to you' becomes ''te las voy a dár'''telas'''''.
* ''[[Queísmo]]'' (using ''que'' instead of ''de que'') is socially accepted and used in the media, and '' [[dequeísmo]]'' (using ''de que'' instead of ''que'') is somewhat stigmatized.
* In ordinary speech, conjugations of the [[imperative mood]] of a few of verbs tend to be replaced with the indicative third-person singular. For example, the second-person singular imperative of ''poner'' 'to put', which is ''pon'', becomes ''pone''; that of ''hacer'' 'to do', which is ''haz'', becomes ''hace''; and that  of ''salir'' 'to exit', ''sal'', becomes ''sale'': ''hace lo que te pedí'' 'do what I asked'. However, that is not done in formal speech. Chileans also replace the etymological second-person singular imperative of the verb ''ir'' 'to go', ''ve'', with the second-person singular imperative of ''andar'' 'to walk', ''anda'', and ''ve'' is reserved for the verb ''ver'' 'to see': ''ve la hora'' 'look at the time'.
* Another feature to note is the lack of use of the possessive ''nuestro'' 'our', which is usually replaced by ''de nosotros'' 'of us': ''ándate a la casa '''de nosotros''''', literally 'go to the house of us', instead of ''ándate a nuestra casa'' 'go to our house'.
* It is very common in Chile, as in many other Latin American countries, to use the diminutive suffixes ''-ito'' and ''-ita''. They can mean 'little', as in ''perrito'' 'little dog' or ''casita'' 'little house', but can also express affection, as with ''mamita'' 'mummy, mommy'. They can also diminish the urgency, directness, or importance of something to make something annoying seem more pleasant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.contactchile.cl/en/chile-chilenianisms.php Chilean Spanish &amp; Chileanisms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060112140209/http://www.contactchile.cl/en/chile-chilenianisms.php |date=2006-01-12 }} http://www.contactchile.cl/  retrieved June 27, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; So, if someone says ''espérese un momentito'' literally 'wait a little moment', it does not mean that the moment will be short, but that the speaker wants to make waiting more palatable and hint that the moment may turn out to be quite long.

===Pronouns and verbs===
Chileans use the ''[[voseo]]'' and ''[[tuteo]]'' forms for the intimate second-person singular. ''Voseo'' is common in Chile, with both pronominal and verbal ''voseo'' being widely used in the spoken language.
 
In Chile there are at least four grades of formality:
 
*Pronominal and verbal voseo, the use of the pronoun ''vos'' (with the corresponding ''voseo'' verbs): &lt;br&gt;''vos sabí(s)'', ''vos vení(s)'', ''vos hablái(s)'', etc. &lt;br&gt;
This occurs only in very informal situations and should be approached and used with caution by foreigners. It is always considered rude and insulting but is tolerated and enjoyed as part of friendly bonding and banter. However, with even a slight change in intonation, it can change from a tone of friendly banter to a form of insult to a heated argument, even among friends. Non-natives should refrain from using ''vos'' until sufficient understanding of its use is gained.

*Verbal ''voseo'', the use of the pronoun ''tú'': &lt;br&gt;''tú sabí(s)'', ''tú vení(s)'', ''tú hablái(s)'', etc. &lt;br&gt;This is the predominant form used in the spoken language.&lt;ref&gt;Lipski (1994: 201-2)&lt;/ref&gt; It should never be used in formal situations or with people one does not know well.

*Standard ''tuteo'': &lt;br&gt;''tú sabes'', ''tú vienes'', ''tú hablas'', etc. &lt;br&gt;This is the only acceptable way to write the intimate second-person singular. Its use in spoken language is reserved for slightly more formal situations such as (some) child-to-parent, teacher-to-student, or peer-to-peer relations among people who do not know each other well.

*The use of the pronoun ''usted'': &lt;br&gt;''usted sabe'', ''usted viene'', ''usted habla'', etc. &lt;br&gt;This is used for all business and other formal interactions, such as student-to-teacher but not always teacher-to-student as well as "upwards" if one person is considered to be well respected, older or of an obviously higher social standing. Stricter parents will demand this kind of speech from their children as well.
 
[[Voseo#Present Indicative|The Chilean voseo conjugation]] has only three irregular verbs in the present indicative: ''ser'' 'to be', ''ir'' 'to go', and ''haber'' 'to have' (auxiliary).

===Ser===
In Chile, there are various ways to say 'you are' to one person.

*'''Vo(s) soi'''
*'''Vo(s) erí(s)'''
*'''Tú soi'''
*'''Tú erí(s)'''
*'''Tú eres'''
*'''Usted es'''

Only the last two are considered [[Standard Spanish]]. Usage depends on politeness, social relationships, formality, and education. The ending ''(s)'' in those forms is aspirated or omitted.

===Conjugation===

A comparison of the conjugation of the Chilean ''voseo'', the ''voseo'' used in Latin American countries other than Chile, and ''tuteo'' follows:

|}
&lt;small&gt;* [[Rioplatense Spanish]] prefers the tuteo verb forms.&lt;/small&gt;

==Vocabulary==

Chilean Spanish has a great deal of distinctive slang and vocabulary. Some examples of distinctive Chilean slang include ''al tiro'' (right away), ''gallo/a'' (guy/gal), ''fome'' (boring), ''pololear'' (to go out as girlfriend/boyfriend),&lt;ref name="Real Academia Española"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rae.es/ |title=Real Academia Española |publisher=Rae.es |date= |accessdate=2013-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''pelambre'' (gossip), ''pito'' (marijuana cigarette i.e. joint) ''poto'' (buttocks),&lt;ref&gt;Lipski (1994: 203)&lt;/ref&gt; ''quiltro'' (mutt) and ''chomba'' (knitted sweater)&lt;ref name="Real Academia Española"/&gt; ''wea'' (thing; can be used for an object or situation).  In addition, several words in Chilean Spanish are borrowed from neighboring Amerindian languages.

===Argentine and Rioplatense influence===
In Chilean Spanish there is lexical influence from Argentine dialects, which suggests a [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|covert prestige]]. Lexical influences cut across the different social strata of Chile. Argentine summer tourism in Chile and Chilean tourism in Argentina provide a channel for influence on the speech of the upper class.&lt;ref name=Argentinismos2014/&gt; The middle classes receive Argentine influence by watching [[association football|football]] on [[cable television]] and Argentine programs on [[broadcast television]].&lt;ref name=Argentinismos2014/&gt; ''[[La Cuarta]]'', a popular Chilean newspaper, regularly employs words and expressions from the [[lunfardo]] slang of the Buenos Aires region. Usually Chileans do not recognize the Argentine borrowings as such, claiming they are Chilean terms and expressions.&lt;ref name=Argentinismos2014/&gt; The relation between Argentine dialects and Chilean Spanish is one of asymmetric permeability, with Chilean Spanish adopting sayings from Argentine variants but usually not the reverse.&lt;ref name=Argentinismos2014&gt;{{cite journal |last=Salamanca |first=Gastón |last2=Ramírez |first2=Ariella |date=2014 |title=Argentinismos en el léxico del español de Chile: Nuevas evidencias  |url=http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0718-04622014000100006 |journal=[[Atenea]] |volume=509 |issue= |pages=97–121  |doi= |access-date=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Coa and Lunfardo expressions

[[Lunfardo]] is an [[argot]] of the [[Spanish language]] that originated in the late 19th century among the lower classes of [[Buenos Aires]] and [[Montevideo]]. Coa is an argot common among criminals in Chile. It has been heavily influenced by Lunfardo. Examples of Lunfardo and Coa words and phrases in Chilean Spanish are:&lt;ref name=chilenismos&gt;{{cite book

===Mapudungun loanwords===

The [[Mapudungun language]] has left a relatively small number of words in Chilean Spanish, given its large geographic expanse. Many Mapudungun loans are names for plants, animals, and places. For example:&lt;ref name=Fernando/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.emol.com/noticias/Nacional/2017/02/21/845966/Dia-de-la-lengua-materna-Que-palabras-de-uso-diario-provienen-de-nuestros-pueblos-originarios.html | title=Día de la lengua materna: ¿Qué palabras de uso diario provienen de nuestros pueblos originarios? &amp;#124; Emol.com| date=2017-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://juliosuarezanturi.wordpress.com/2011/04/02/del-origen-mapuche-de-palabras-chilenas/|title=Del origen mapuche de las palabras chilenas|date=2 April 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quechua loanwords===
The [[Quechua language]] is probably the Amerindian language that has given Chilean Spanish the largest number of [[loanword]]s. For example, the names of many American vegetables in Chilean Spanish are derived from Quechua names, rather than from [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]] or [[Taíno language|Taíno]] as in Standard Spanish. Some of the words of Quechua origin include:&lt;ref name="Fernando"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cepchile.cl/dms/lang_1/doc_3765.html |language=Spanish |title=Tras la huella del Mapudungun |author=Zúñiga, Fernando |date=2006-06-11 |work=El Mercurio |publisher=Centro de Estudios Publicos |accessdate=2007-11-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029160440/http://www.cepchile.cl/dms/lang_1/doc_3765.html |archivedate=2007-10-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
[[File:Chunilal Madia birth place in Dhoraji.jpg|thumb|Birth place of Madia in [[Dhoraji]]|left|upright=0.6]]
Chunilal Madia's ancestors had immigrated to [[Dhoraji]] (now in [[Rajkot district]], [[Gujarat]])  from Nikava village in [[Halar]] region. Chunilal was born in middle class [[Jain]] Baniya family on 12 August 1922 in Dhoraji to a grocery shop owner Kalidas Jadavji and his wife Prankunwar aka Kasumbabahen. Chunilal was youngest among ten siblings, of whom only five survived till adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Madia |first=Amitabh |title=Chunilal Madia: Ek Abhyas |date=2013 |publisher=Navbharat Sahitya Mandir |location=Ahmedabad |isbn=978-81-8440-744-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GSP"&gt;{{cite web | title=ચુનીલાલ મડિયા, ગુજરાતી સાહિત્ય પરિષદ | website=Chunilal Madia, Gujarati Sahitya Parishad | url=http://www.gujaratisahityaparishad.com/prakashan/photo-gallery/sahitya-sarjako/Chunilal-Madia.html | language=gu | accessdate=2015-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Communication design''' is a mixed discipline between [[design]] and information-development which is concerned with how [[media (communication)|media]] intervention such as [[printing|printed]], [[craft]]ed, [[electronic media]] or [[presentations]] communicate with people. A communication design approach is not only concerned with developing the [[message]] aside from the [[aesthetic]]s in media, but also with creating new media channels to ensure the message reaches the target audience. Some designers use [[graphic design]] and communication design interchangeably due to overlapping skills.

Communication design can also refer to a systems-based approach, in which the totality of media and messages within a culture or organization are designed as a single integrated process rather than a series of discrete efforts. This is done through communication channels that aim to inform and attract the attention of the people one are focusing one's skills on. Design skills must be tailored to fit to different cultures of people, while maintaining pleasurable visual design. These are all important pieces of information to add to a media communications kit to get the best results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cgiar.org/www-archive/www.cgiar.org/communicationstoolkit/pdf/Developing%20a%20Communication%20Plan.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150413032136/http://www.cgiar.org/www-archive/www.cgiar.org/communicationstoolkit/pdf/Developing%20a%20Communication%20Plan.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the discipline of Communication, a framework for Communication as Design has emerged that focuses on redesigning interactivity and shaping communication [[Affordance|affordances]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aakhus|first=Mark|date=2007-03-01|title=Communication as Design|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03637750701196383|journal=Communication Monographs|volume=74|issue=1|pages=112–117|doi=10.1080/03637750701196383|issn=0363-7751}}&lt;/ref&gt; Software and applications create opportunities for and place constraints on communication. Recently, Guth and Brabham examined the way that ideas compete within a [[crowdsourcing]] platform, providing a model about the relationships among design ideas, communication, and platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guth|first=Kristen L.|last2=Brabham|first2=Daren C.|date=2017-08-04|title=Finding the diamond in the rough: Exploring communication and platform in crowdsourcing performance|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03637751.2017.1359748|journal=Communication Monographs|volume=0|issue=0|pages=1–24|doi=10.1080/03637751.2017.1359748|issn=0363-7751}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same authors have interviewed technology company founders about the democratic ideals they build into the design of [[e-government]] applications and technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brabham|first=Daren C.|last2=Guth|first2=Kristen L.|date=2017-08-01|title=The Deliberative Politics of the Consultative Layer: Participation Hopes and Communication as Design Values of Civic Tech Founders|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcom.12316/abstract|journal=Journal of Communication|language=en|volume=67|issue=4|pages=445–475|doi=10.1111/jcom.12316|issn=1460-2466}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interest in the Communication as Design framework is growing among researchers. 

==Overview==
Communication design seeks to attract, inspire, create desires and motivate the people to respond to messages, with a view to making a favorable impact to the bottom line of the commissioning body, which can be either to build a brand, move sales, or for humanitarian purposes. Its process involves strategic [[business]] thinking, using [[market research]], [[creativity]], and [[problem-solving]]. Communications designers translate ideas and information through a variety of media. Their particular talent lies not only in the traditional skills of the hand, but also in their ability to think strategically in design and marketing terms, in order to establish credibility through the communication.

The term communication design is often used interchangeably with [[visual communication]], but has an alternative broader meaning that includes [[Auditory system|auditory]], vocal, touch and smell. Examples of communication design include [[information architecture]], [[editing]], [[typography]], [[illustration]], [[web design]], [[animation]], [[advertising]], [[ambient media]], [[Brand management|visual identity design]], [[performing arts]], [[copywriting]] and [[professional writing]] skills applied in the [[creative industries]].

==Education==
Students of communication design learn how to create visual messages and broadcast them to the world in new and meaningful ways. In the complex [[digital environment]] around us, communication design has become a powerful means of reaching out to the [[target audience]]. Students learn how to combine communication with [[art]] and [[technology]]. Communication Design discipline involves teaching how to design [[Web page|web pages]], [[Video game|video games]], [[animation]], [[motion graphics]] and more.

Communication Design has content as its main purpose. It must achieve a reaction, or get customer to see a product in a genuine way to attract sales or get across a message. Students of Communications Design are often Illustrators, Graphic Designers, Web designers, Advertising artists, Animators, Video Editors or Motion graphic artists, or even printmakers and conceptual artists. The term Communications Design is fairly general and practitioners work in various mediums to get a message across.

      <comment>Removed a confusing 'occurred, or' in the definition of Dateline. The news industry uses Dateline to refer to where and when the story was written or filed from, not necessarily occurred. The footnote gets it right.</comment>

A '''dateline''' is a brief piece of text included in [[news]] articles that describes where and when the story was written or filed,&lt;ref name="BarbieStuart2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zelizer |first1= Barbie|last2=Allan |first2= Stuart|title=Keywords in News and Journalism Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kl6iw6HiDIkC&amp;pg=PA29|year= 2010 |location= Milton Keynes |publisher= Open University Press |isbn=978-0-335-22183-7|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the date is often omitted. In the case of articles reprinted from [[wire service]]s, the distributing organization is also included (though the originating one is not). Datelines are traditionally placed on the first line of the text of the article, before the first sentence.

==Format==
The location appears first, usually starting with the [[city]] in which the [[reporter]] has written or dispatched the report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moos|first1=Julie|title=Datelines, Bylines, Other Lines|url=http://www.poynter.org/2003/datelines-bylines-other-lines/11797/|publisher=Poynter Institute|accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; City names are usually printed in uppercase, though this can vary from one publication to another. The [[political division]] and/or [[nation]] the city is in may follow, but they may be dropped if the city name is widely recognizable due to its size or political importance (a national [[Capital (political)|capital]], for instance). The date of the report comes after, followed by an [[em dash]] surrounded by spaces, and then the article.

A typical newspaper dateline might read: &lt;!-- not a real news clipping, no copyright --&gt;
:&lt;code&gt;BEIRUT, Lebanon, June 2&amp;nbsp;— The outlook was uncertain today as ...&lt;/code&gt;

The same story if pulled from the [[Associated Press]] (AP) wire might appear as:
:&lt;code&gt;BEIRUT (AP)&amp;nbsp;— The outlook was uncertain today as ...&lt;/code&gt;

Datelines can take on some unusual forms. When reporters collaborate on a story, two different locations might be listed.&lt;ref name="Martin2010"&gt;{{cite book|first=Paul |last= Martin|title=The Wall Street Journal Essential Guide to Business Style and Usage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MqdSIpKgEZMC&amp;pg=PA34|year=2010 |location= New York |publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4516-0364-4|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Associated Press omits a dateline "when a story has been assembled from sources in widely separate areas".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last= Goldstein |editor-first= Norm |year= 1998 |title= The Associated Press Stylebook and Libel Manual |edition= 33rd |location= New York |publisher= Associated Press |page=58   |isbn= 0-917360-16-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, the exact location may be unknown or intentionally imprecise, such as when covering [[military]] operations while on a [[ship]] at sea or following an invasion force.

==Other media==
The concept of a dateline has been adapted to [[television]]. Reporters on news programs might have their location mentioned in an introduction from the [[news anchor]]:
:&lt;code&gt;"Here now from Albuquerque, New Mexico, is reporter Nigel Culpepper"&lt;/code&gt;  
A field reporter might also end his stories by combining the location from where he filed the report with a "lockout" (the last thing a reporter says in the report, and includes his name and station ID); especially if the segment is recorded and not live. For example, the last bit of a report could sound like:
:&lt;code&gt;"... prompting an investigation into the matter. Richard Morris, BBC News, London."&lt;/code&gt;

A number of [[current affairs (news format)|current affairs]] TV shows have ''[[Dateline (disambiguation)|dateline]]'' as part of their name.

'''Dittography''' is the accidental, erroneous act of repeating a letter, word, phrase or combination of letters by a scribe or copyist.&lt;ref&gt;Paul D. Wegner, [https://books.google.com/books?id=SIMsY6b2n2gC&amp;pg=PA48&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''A student's guide to textual criticism of the Bible: its history, methods, and results''], InterVarsity Press, 2006, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used in the field of [[textual criticism]]. The opposite phenomenon, in which a copyist omits text by skipping from a word or phrase to a similar word or phrase further on, is known as [[haplography]].

==Example==
[[Papyrus 98|&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{P}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sup&gt;98&lt;/sup&gt;]] in Rev 1:13 has {{lang|el|περιεζωσμμενον}} instead of {{lang|el|περιεζωσμενον}} (doubled μ). [[Codex Vaticanus]]  in John 13:14 word {{lang|el|διδασκαλος}} is repeated twice. In Codex Vaticanus in [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]], a book of the [[Bible]], verse 19:34, the phrase "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians" appears twice while it only appears once in other manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlham.edu/~seidti/iam/dittography.html Dittography—earlham.edu/~seidti]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dominik Kuhn''' (pseudonym: ''Dodokay''; born September 16, 1969) is a German producer, language artist, comedian, director and musician.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.starpatrol.com/eindex.html Dominik Kuhn's Website]&lt;/ref&gt; He is the owner of the production company STARPATROL Entertainment.

He got famous in Germany with [[Swabian German|Swabian]] [[fandub]] videos, synchronising, among others, the [[Dalai Lama]] or [[Barack Obama]] in Swabian German dialect.
 
== Biography  ==
Dominik Kuhn was raised in [[Reutlingen]]. He did his [[Abitur]] in 1989. While in school, he started a rental company for event technology and worked simultaneously at a local radio station as music editor, [[DJ]] and sound technician. Later, he also worked as an independent audio engineer and started producing radio commercials and music, before he began to producing films. He produced some commercials and low-budget films and worked as an actor, especially in regional productions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laible-und-frisch.de/Figuren%20und%20Schauspieler/Schafferdinger/Martin%20Buck Official website, TV series ''Laible und Frisch'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dodokay.com  FAQ on dodokay.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

He translated a couple of [[science fiction]] novels for Dino Verlag in Stuttgart, among others for the ''[[Star Wars]]'' series and the German version of ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]''.&lt;ref name=sw/&gt; Dominik Kuhn speaks Dutch and English.&lt;ref name=sw&gt;[http://www.starwars-union.de/sw/dominik_kuhn/ Interview on StarWars-Union.de]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Using a pseudonym, ''Dodokay'', Kuhn got famous with [[Swabia|Swabian]] [[fandub]] videos, which have been published on various video sites such as [[YouTube]], Clipfish and [[MyVideo]]. In 2007, a ''[[Star Wars]]'' parody about [[viral marketing]] in [[Stuttgart]] found hundreds of thousands of fans. Despite some copyright conflicts, he gained fame in the mainstream media and quickly received offers to do such spots professionally.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/10/14/us-media-youtube-starwars-idUSTRE69D3V920101014 Star Wars dub sends jobbing ad man into orbit], By Dave Graham Reuters STUTTGART, Germany Thu Oct 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of the Star Wars video, Kuhn also made a version in "Swabian English".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media  | people = Dominik Kuhn | year =  | title = Viral Marketing on Death Star Stuttgart| medium =  | language = Swabian English| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q82NlrF1ArY&amp;hd=1| accessdate = 17 October 2014 | archiveurl =  | archivedate =  | format =  | time = 1 | location =  | publisher =  | id =  | isbn =  | oclc =  | quote =  | ref = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 he started to produce a fandub [[news parody]], called ''Die Welt auf Schwäbisch'' (The World in Swabian), for one of Germany's public broadcaster [[Südwestrundfunk|SWR]]'s TV channel [[SWR Fernsehen]]. The original text is not translated but completely changed. Among the news report clips featured were [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] 'Swabian edition' with former French president [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] explaining software features and [[Hillary Clinton]] doing the weather report.&lt;ref name =star/&gt; Kuhn found new tasks coaching various celebrities and actors in Swabian and was asked to work and lecture on viral marketing campaigns.&lt;ref name =star&gt;[http://www.starpatrol.com/dvoice.html Kuhn's website biography]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.welcome-to-the-pleasuredome.com/dband.html Members list of the band ''Welcome To The Pleasuredome''], retrieved May 31, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Business-to-business|B2B]] video for [[IBM]], about the "LAN-Ball", an allegedly remote-controlled football, is among his professional campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;Reality Bites - Best Practices &amp; Erfolgsfaktoren im B2B-Marketing&lt;/ref&gt; Dodokay also created fandubs of Barack Obama's 2009 and 2013 Berlin speeches; in both version he placed Obama in front of an assembly of home owners in a Stuttgart mansion.&lt;ref&gt;Gebrauchsanweisung für Stuttgart Elisabeth Kabatek Piper Verlag, 17.09.2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, rather Swabian problems with neighbors cleaning the car at 5:30 in the morning were used for a fandub of the [[Dalai Lama]]. German public broadcaster [[ZDF]] used Kuhn's fandub of a Romney-Obama TV discussion to start reporting about the outcome of the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 US presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |work=Südkurier |title=Obama gegen Romney auf Schwäbisch |trans-title=Obama versus Romney in Swabian |url=http://www.suedkurier.de/nachrichten/politik/themensk/Obama-gegen-Romney-auf-Schwaebisch;art1015367,5759332 |language=German |date= 6 November 2012 |accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |work=Merkur |title="Dr Mitt hot halt koi Ahnung!"

Dricky Beukes (29 December 1918, Prieska, Northern Cape – 9 November 1999) was a writer of [[Afrikaans]] novels, short stories and radio dramas. Beukes wrote more than a hundred Afrikaans novels, a large number of short stories and numerous Afrikaans radio dramas, including some extensive pieces for the commercial station Springbok Radio. She died in 1999 in Bellville after a battle with blood cancer. There is a Dricky Beukes Street named after her in Kokrus, [[Vereeniging]]. 
 
==Early Life==
She was born on Seekoebaard farm in Prieska as Hendrika Johanna van Staden and she was the youngest of 13 children &lt;ref name= "Dricky"&gt;[https://www.springbokboeke.co.za/html/dricky_beukes.html "Dricky Beukes". Springbok Books]&lt;/ref&gt;. When she was three years old, her father moved their family to Karos, a small town near the [[Gariep River]] in [[Upington]] in the [[Northern Cape]], where she grew up and received her early school education. She matriculated from the Higher Business School in [[Paarl]] and took up a job at the Karos Post Office after writing her Public Service Examination &lt;ref name= "Beukes"&gt;[https://www.litnet.co.za/dricky-beukes-19181999/ "Dricky Beukes (1918–1999)" Terreblanche, E. 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;. 

She married Abraham Opperman Beukes of Prince Albert on July 4, 1942. He was the first principal of Laerskool Vredelust in Bellville, who himself also wrote three children's books. The couple moved to Bellville and they had a son, Van Staden, and two daughters Brenda and Wilmari. In Bellville, Beukes was the editor for a small newspaper called ''Die Noordwester'' and a regular contributor to the ''Oudtshoorn Courant''. After retirement, the couple settled in Tygerberg in Bellville &lt;ref&gt;''[[Die Burger]]'' 13 November 1999&lt;/ref&gt;. Beukes’ husband died in Durbanville in March 1993.

== Work==
Beukes was an accomplished writer and a host on the SABC’s service Springbok radio. Beukes was made popular by her sequel stories. A phrase which gained country-wide popularity at the time was her introduction to the radio drama Die Indringer (The Trespasser): 'n verhaal wat elke moederhart sal roer (a story to touch the heart of every mother).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Die Burger]]'' 13 November 1999&lt;/ref&gt;   Die Indringer was a story about the trials of a woman who adopted child &lt;ref name= "Beukes"&gt;[https://www.litnet.co.za/dricky-beukes-19181999/ "Dricky Beukes (1918–1999)" Terreblanche, E. 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;. Die Indringer was broadcast for the first time on the May 16, 1960 and it was the most popular day program on Springbok radio for 11 years. Other popular radio stories by Dricky Beukes include Skaduwees oor Summerdown, Blinkwater, Die geel karavaan and Dokter Karenien &lt;ref name= "Dricky"&gt;[https://www.springbokboeke.co.za/html/dricky_beukes.html "Dricky Beukes". Springbok Books]&lt;/ref&gt;. Beukes remained on air for more than a decade making her a household name in Afrikaans speaking homes. 

She wrote her first novel, “Madelief”, in just 14 days and it was published in 1945 in ''The Housewife''. She was just 18 years old at the time &lt;ref name= "Beukes"&gt;[https://www.litnet.co.za/dricky-beukes-19181999/ "Dricky Beukes (1918–1999)" Terreblanche, E. 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;. The story was inspired by her mother’s death which occurred in the same year.

Beukes published many popular books in Afrikaans. The Kamberg series: “Kamberg se wêreld” (Kamberg's world), 1982, “Kamberg se mense” (Kamberg's people), 1986 and “Kamberg se Kinders” (Kamberg's children), 1988, were popular among readers. Beukes also wrote Meetsnoere and Een wat ’n muur afbreek. The stories depicted the lives of the people in Karos, where she spent her childhood.

{{Anti-consumerism |Theories}}
An '''ecovillage'''  is a traditional or [[intentional community]] with the [[goal]] of becoming more socially, culturally, economically, and ecologically [[sustainability|sustainable]]. It is consciously designed through locally owned, participatory processes to regenerate and restore its social and natural environments. Most range from a population of 50 to 250 individuals, although some are smaller, and traditional ecovillages are often much larger. Larger ecovillages often exist as networks of smaller sub-communities. Some ecovillages have grown through like-minded individuals, families, or other small groups—who are not members, at least at the outset—settling on the ecovillage's periphery and participating ''[[de facto]]'' in the community.

Ecovillagers are united by shared [[Ecology|ecological]], [[Triple bottom line|social-economic]] and [[Spiritual ecology|cultural-spiritual]] values.&lt;ref name = Redefining&gt;Van Schyndel Kasper, D. (2008). [http://www.humanecologyreview.org/pastissues/her151/kasper.pdf "Redefining Community in the Ecovillage."] ''Human Ecology Review'' '''15''':12–24. Retrieved on July 28, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;  Concretely, ecovillagers seek alternatives to ecologically destructive electrical, water, transportation, and waste-treatment systems, as well as the larger social systems that mirror and support them.  Many see the breakdown of traditional forms of community, wasteful [[consumerism|consumerist]] lifestyles, the destruction of natural habitat, [[urban sprawl]], [[factory farming]], and over-reliance on fossil fuels as trends that must be changed to avert ecological disaster and create richer and more fulfilling ways of life.

Ecovillages offer small-scale communities with [[Low-impact development (UK)|minimal ecological impact]] or regenerative impacts as an alternative.  However, such communities often cooperate with peer villages in networks of their own (''see'' [[Global Ecovillage Network]] for an example).  This model of [[collective action]] is similar to that of [[Ten Thousand Villages]], which supports the [[fair trade]] of goods worldwide.

==Definition==
In 1991, [[Robert Gilman]] set out a definition of an ecovillage that became standard for many years.  Gilman defined an ecovillage as a:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[[human-scale]] full-featured settlement in which human activities are harmlessly integrated into the natural world in a way that is supportive of healthy human development, and can be successfully continued into the indefinite future."&lt;ref&gt;Gilman, Robert (Summer, 1991). [http://www.context.org/ICLIB/IC29/Gilman1.htm "The Eco-village Challenge"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041213201638/http://www.context.org/ICLIB/IC29/Gilman1.htm |date=2004-12-13 }}. ''In Context.'' Retrieved on: 2008-04-09.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kosha Joubert, Executive Director of the Global Ecovillage Network, more recently defined an ecovillage as an:

&lt;blockquote&gt; "intentional, traditional; rural or urban community that is consciously designed through locally owned, participatory processes in all four dimensions of sustainability (social, culture, ecology and economy) to regenerate their social and natural environments." &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGbuOBCGfmQ From Apartheid to Ecovillage, TEDX 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In this view, ecovillages are seen as an ongoing process, rather than a particular outcome. They often start off with a focus on one of the four dimensions of sustainability, e.g. ecology, but evolve into holistic models for restoration. In this view, aiming for sustainability is not enough; it is vital to restore and regenerate the fabric of life and across all four dimensions of sustainability: social, environmental, economic and cultural.

Ecovillages have developed in recent years as technology has improved so they have more sophisticated structures as noted by Baydoun, M. 2013.

Generally the ecovillage concept is not tied to specific sectarian (religious, political, corporate) organizations or belief systems not directly related to environmentalism, such as monasteries, cults, or communes.

==History==
The modern-day desire for community was most notably characterized by the communal "back to the land" movement of the 1960s and 1970s through communities such as the earliest example that still survives, the [[Miccosukee Land Co-op]] co-founded in May 1973 by [[James Clement van Pelt]] in Tallahassee, Florida. The movement became more focused and organized in the [[cohousing]] and related alternative-community movements of the mid-1980s. Then, in 1991, [[Robert Gilman]] and [[Diane Gilman]] co-authored a germinal study called "Ecovillages and Sustainable Communities" for Gaia Trust, in which the ecological and communitarian themes were brought together.

The ecovillage movement began to coalesce at the annual autumn conference of [[Findhorn Ecovillage|Findhorn]], in Scotland, in 1995. The conference was called: "Ecovillages and Sustainable Communities", and conference organizers turned away hundreds of applicants. According to [[Ross Jackson]], "somehow they had struck a chord that resonated far and wide. The word 'ecovillage'... thus became part of the language of the [[Cultural Creatives]]."&lt;ref name=Movement&gt;Jackson, Ross (Summer, 2004). [http://www.ross-jackson.com/rj/21987/41762/ "The Ecovillage Movement."]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Permaculture Magazine'' '''40'''. Retrieved on: 2011-08-11.&lt;/ref&gt; After that conference, many intentional communities, including Findhorn, began calling themselves "ecovillages", giving birth to a new movement. The [[Global Ecovillage Network]], formed by a group of about 25 people from various countries who had attended the Findhorn conference, crystallized the event by linking hundreds of small projects from around the world, who had with similar goals but had formerly operated without knowledge of each other. Gaia Trust, Denmark, agreed to fund the network for its first five years.&lt;ref name = Movement/&gt; Today, there are self-identified ecovillages in over 70 countries on six continents.&lt;ref name=Inside&gt;Taggart, Jonathan (Nov-Dec, 2009). [https://archive.is/20120713075004/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6685/is_5_35/ai_n39169482/?tag=content;col1 Inside an ecovillage]. bNet - CBS Interactive Business Network. Retrieved on: 2011-08-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1995 conference, a number of the early members of the Global Ecovillage Network have tried other approaches to eco-village building in an attempt to build settlements that would be attractive to mainstream culture in order to make sustainable development more generally accepted. One of these with some degree of success is [[Living Villages]] and The Wintles where eco-houses are arranged so that social connectivity is maximised and residents have shared food growing areas, woodland and animal husbandry for greater sustainability.

The principles on which ecovillages rely can be applied to [[urban area|urban]] and [[rural]] settings, as well as to developing and developed countries. Advocates seek a sustainable lifestyle (for example, of [[voluntary simplicity]]) for inhabitants with a minimum of trade outside the local area, or [[ecoregion]]. Many advocates also seek independence from existing infrastructures, although others, particularly in more urban settings, pursue more integration with existing infrastructure. Rural ecovillages are usually based on [[organic farming]], [[permaculture]] and other approaches which promote [[ecosystem]] function and [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://socialsciences.arts.unsw.edu.au/tsw/D09TheSigOfTheGEM.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512162136/http://socialsciences.arts.unsw.edu.au/tsw/D09TheSigOfTheGEM.html |archivedate=2013-05-12 |df= }} [[Ted Trainer]] on ecovillages.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ecovillages, whether urban or rural, tend to integrate community and ecological values within a principle-based approach to sustainability, such as permaculture design.&lt;ref&gt;Holmgren, David. [http://holmgren.com.au/product/essence-of-permaculture/ "The Essence of Permaculture."] Retrieved on: 2013-07-31&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnathan Dawson, former president of the Global Ecovillage Network, describes five ecovillage principles in his 2006 book ''Ecovillages: New Frontiers for Sustainability'':
# They are not government-sponsored projects, but grassroots initiatives.
# Their residents value and practice community living.
# Their residents are not overly dependent on government, corporate or other centralized sources for water, food, shelter, power and other basic necessities. Rather, they attempt to provide these resources themselves.
# Their residents have a strong sense of shared values, often characterized in spiritual terms.
# They often serve as research and demonstration sites, offering educational experiences for others.&lt;ref name = Inside/&gt;

The imperative for alternatives to radically inefficient energy-use patterns, in particular automobile-enabled [[suburban sprawl]], was brought into focus by the energy crises of the 1970s. The term "eco-village" was introduced by Georgia Tech Professor George Ramsey in a 1978 address, "Passive Energy Applications for the Built Environment", to the First World Energy Conference of the Association of Energy Engineers,&lt;ref&gt;George Ramsey, "Passive Energy Applications for the Built Environment", First World Energy Conference, Association of Energy Engineers, published in ''Energy Engineering Technology: Proceedings of the First World Energy Engineering Congress'', October 31-November 2, 1978 in Atlanta, Ga. (Fairmont Press, 1979), pp. 220-242. For the term "eco-village" itself, see pp. 229 and 239. http://www.villagehabitat.com/resources/papers/passive_energy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; to describe small-scale, car-free, close-in developments, including suburban infill, arguing that "the great energy waste in the United States is not in its technology; it is in its lifestyle and concept of living."&lt;ref&gt;"Passive Energy Applications for the Built Environment", p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; Ramsey's article includes a sketch for a "self-sufficient pedestrian solar village" by one of his students that looks very similar to eco-villages today.

==Governance==
Effective government is important to Eco-villages. It provides {{clarify|text=education charity for promotion in sustainable lifestyle|post-text=- Much in this section is unclear or poorly phrased|date=November 2016}} (Cunningham and Wearing, 2013). While the first generation of ecovillagers tended to adopt [[consensus decision-making]] as a governance method, some difficulties with consensus as an everyday decision-making method  emerged: it can be extremely time-intensive, and decisions too often could be blocked by a few intransigent members.&lt;ref&gt;Diana Leafe Christian, "Busting-the-myth-that-consensus-with-unanimity-is-good-for-communities", http://www.resilience.org/stories/2013-03-20/busting-the-myth-that-consensus-with-unanimity-is-good-for-communities-part-ii&lt;/ref&gt; More recently many ecovillages have moved toward [[sociocracy]] and related alternative decision-making methods.&lt;ref&gt;Buck, John; Villines, Sharon (2007). We the People: Consenting to a Deeper Democracy (First edition, second printing with corrections ed.). Washington DC: Sociocracy.info Press. pp. 31, 39. {{ISBN|978-0-9792827-0-6}}(pbk)&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, ecovillages look for alternative government which emphasis on deeper connections with ecology than economy.

{{French language}}
{{broader|French verbs}}
'''French conjugation''' is the creation of derived forms of a [[French verbs|French verb]] from its [[principal parts]] by [[inflection]]. French verbs are conventionally divided into three conjugations (''conjugaisons'') with the following grouping:
* 1st group: verbs ending in ''-er'' (except ''aller'').
* 2nd group: verbs ending in ''-ir'', with the [[gerund]] ending in ''-issant''
* 3rd group: verbs ending in ''-re'' (with the exception of irregular verbs).
** 1st section: verbs ending in ''-ir'', with the gerund ending in ''-ant''
** 2nd section: verbs ending in ''-oir''.
** 3rd section: verbs ending in ''-re''
** ''aller''.

The first two groups follow a [[regular verbs|regular]] conjugation, whereas the third group follows an [[irregular verb|irregular]] one. The third group is considered a closed-class conjugation form,&lt;ref&gt;''Le nouveau Bescherelle: L'art de conjuguer'', 1972, pp.&amp;nbsp;10&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that most new verbs introduced to the French language are of the first group (''téléviser, atomiser, radiographier''), with the remaining ones being of the second group (''alunir'').

The verb ''aller'' is the only verb ending in -er belonging to the third group.

==Moods and tenses==
There are seven different [[grammatical mood|moods]] in French conjugation: [[indicative]] (''indicatif''), [[subjunctive]] (''subjonctif''), [[conditional mood|conditional]] (''conditionnel''), [[imperative mood|imperative]] (''impératif''), [[infinitive]] (''infinitif''), [[participle]] (''participe''), and [[gerund]] (''gérondif''). The infinitive, participle, and gerundive are not verbal moods.

Tenses are described under the mood to which they belong, and they are grouped as follows. Other tenses are constructed through the use of an auxiliary verb:

*Indicative

==Auxiliary verbs==
There are two [[auxiliary verb|auxiliary]] verbs in French: ''avoir'' (to have) and ''être'' (to be), used to conjugate compound tenses according to these rules:

*[[Transitive verb]]s (direct or indirect) in the [[active voice]] are conjugated with the verb ''avoir''.
*[[Intransitive verb]]s are conjugated with either ''avoir'' or ''être'' (see [[French verbs#Temporal auxiliary verbs]]).
*[[Reflexive verb]]s (or "pronominal verbs") are conjugated with ''être''.
*''être'' is used to form the [[passive voice]]. ''être'' is itself conjugated according to the tense and mood, and this may require the use of ''avoir'' as an additional auxiliary verb, e.g. ''Il a été mangé'' (It was eaten).

Compound tenses are conjugated with an auxiliary followed by the past participle, ex: ''j'ai fait'' (I did), ''je suis tombé'' (I fell). When ''être'' is used, the participle is [[inflection|inflected]] according to the [[grammatical gender|gender]] and [[grammatical number|number]] of the subject. The participle is inflected with the use of the verb ''avoir'' according to the direct object, but only if the direct object precedes the participle, ex:
* ''il a marché, elle a marché, nous avons marché'' (he walked, she walked, we walked)
* ''il est tombé, elle est tombée, nous sommes tombés, elles sont tombées'' (he fell, she fell, we fell, they (fem.) fell)
* ''Il a achet'''é''' une voiture. Voilà la voiture qu'il a achet'''ée'''.'' (He bought a car. Here is the car he bought)

As stand-alone verbs, the conjugation of the two auxiliaries is listed in the table below:

===''Avoir''===
This verb has different stems for different tenses. These are imperfect ''av-'' {{IPA|/av/}}; present subjunctive ''ai-'' {{IPA|/ɛ/}}; future and conditional ''aur-'' {{IPA|/oʁ/}}; simple past and past subjunctive ''e-'' (not pronounced: ''eus, eusse'' are pronounced as bare inflections {{IPA|/y, ys/}}). Although the stem changes, the inflections of these tenses are as a regular ''-oir'' verb.

In the present, not only are there stem changes, but the inflections are irregular as well:

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; Notice that the imperative form uses the subjunctive conjugation.

Non-finite forms:
* Infinitive: avoir {{IPA|/avwaʁ/}}
* Present participle: ayant {{IPA|/ejɑ̃/}}
* Gerundive: en ayant {{IPA|/ɑ̃n‿ejɑ̃/}}
* Verbal adjective: ayant(s) {{IPA|/ejɑ̃/}}, ayante(s) {{IPA|/ejɑ̃t/}}
* Past participle: eu(e)(s) {{IPA|/y/}}

Auxiliary verb: ''avoir''

===''Être''===
This verb has different stems for different tenses. These are all pronounced differently: imperfect ''ét-'' {{IPA|/et/}};  present subjunctive ''soi-'' {{IPA|/swa/}}; future and conditional ''ser-'' {{IPA|/səʁ/}}; simple past and past subjunctive in ''f-'' {{IPA|/f/}}. The inflections of these tenses are as a regular ''-oir'' verb (that is, as an ''-re'' verb but with the vowel ''u'' {{IPA|/y/}} in the ''f-'' forms). For example, subjunctive ''soyons, soyez'' is pronounced with the ''y'' sound ({{IPA|/swajɔ̃, swaje/}}) of other ''-re'' and ''-oir'' verbs.

In the simple present, not only are there stem changes, but the inflections are irregular as well:

|}

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; The imperative form uses the subjunctive conjugation.

The non-finite forms use the stem ''êt-'' {{IPA|/ɛt/}} (before a consonant)/''ét-'' {{IPA|/et/}} (before a vowel):
* Infinitive: être
* Present participle: étant
* Gerundive: en étant
* Verbal adjective: étant(e)(s)
* Past participle: été

Auxiliary verb: ''avoir''

==First group verbs (''-er'' verbs)==
{{anchor|First}}French verbs ending in ''-er'', which constitute the largest class, inflect somewhat differently from other verbs. Between the stem and the inflectional endings that are common across most verbs, there may be a vowel, which in the case of the ''-er'' verbs is a silent ''-e-'' (in the simple present singular), ''-é'' or ''-ai'' {{IPA|/e/}} (in the past participle and the ''je'' form of the simple past), and ''-a-'' {{IPA|/a/}} (in the rest of simple past singular and in the past subjunctive). In addition, the orthographic ''-t'' found in the ''-ir'' and ''-re'' verbs in the singular of the simple present and past is not found in this conjugation, so that the final consonants are ''-Ø'', ''-s'', ''-Ø'' rather than ''-s'', ''-s'', ''-t.''

Auxiliary verb: ''avoir''
(''arriver'', ''entrer'', ''monter'', ''passer'', ''rester'', ''rentrer'', ''retourner'', and ''tomber'' use ''être'')

Exceptional contexts:
* When the first-person singular present tense form of the indicative or subjunctive is found in inversion, the writer must change the final ''e'' to either ''é'' (traditional usage) or ''è'' (rectified modern usage), in order to link the two words : « Parlè-je ? », {{IPA|/paʁlɛʒ/}}, "Am I speaking?" (This is a very rare construction, however.)
* When the second-person singular form of the imperative is followed by its object ''y'' or ''en'', a final ''s'' is added: « Parles-en ! », {{IPA|[paʁlzɑ̃]}}, "Talk about it!"

Exceptional verbs:
* The verb ''aller'', though it ends in ''-er'' is completely irregular and belongs to the third group.
* In ''-cer'' verbs, the ''c'' becomes a ''ç'' before endings that start with ''a'' or ''o'', to indicate that it is still pronounced /s/ (je déplac&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt; - nous déplaç&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;ons&lt;/span&gt;); similarly, in ''-ger'' verbs, the ''g'' becomes ''ge'' before such endings, to indicate that it is pronounced /ʒ/ (je mang&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt; - nous mange&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;ons&lt;/span&gt;).
* In ''-oyer'' and ''-uyer'' verbs, the ''y'' becomes an ''i'' before endings that start with a silent ''e'' (nous envoy&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;ons&lt;/span&gt; - j'envoi&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;); in ''-ayer'' verbs, the writer may or may not change the ''y'' to an ''i'' before such endings (je pa&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;ye&lt;/span&gt; - je pa&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;ie&lt;/span&gt;). Additionally, the future and conditional forms of ''envoyer'' start with ''enverr-'' rather than ''envoyer-''; and similarly with ''renvoyer''.
* In ''-é.er'' verbs, the ''é'' becomes an ''è'' before silent endings, and optionally in the future and conditional tenses.
* In ''-e.er'' verbs other than most ''-eler'' and ''-eter'' verbs, the ''e'' becomes an ''è'' before endings that start with a silent ''e'' (including the future and conditional endings). For example: peler (to peel) -&gt; je p&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;èle&lt;/span&gt; (present) / je p&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;èlerai&lt;/span&gt; (futur) / je p&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;èlerais&lt;/span&gt; (conditional).
* In most ''-eler'' and ''-eter'' verbs, the writer must either change the ''e'' to an ''è'' before endings that start with a silent ''e'', or change the ''l'' or ''t'' to ''ll'' or ''tt''. In the rest of these verbs, only one or the other form is allowed. For example: appeler (to call) -&gt; j'appel&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;le&lt;/span&gt; (present) / j'appel&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;lerai&lt;/span&gt; (futur) / j'appel&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;lerais&lt;/span&gt; (conditional).
*The verbal adjective of following verbs is irregular: adhérer - adhérent(e)(s); coïncider - coïncident(e)(s); confluer - confluent(e)(s); affluer - affluent(e)(s); converger - convergent(e)(s); déterger - détergent(e)(s); différer - différent(e)(s); exceller - excellent(e)(s); diverger - divergent(e)(s); négliger, négligent(e)(s); précéder - précédent(e)(s); violer - violent(e)(s); influer - influent(e)(s); communiquer - communicant(e)(s); suffoquer - suffocant(e)(s); provoquer -  provocant(e)(s); naviguer - navigant(e)(s); déléguer - délégant(e)(s); fatiguer - fatigant(e)(s); intriguer - intrigant(e)(s).

==Second group verbs (''-ir'' verbs / gerund ending in -issant)==
The ''-ir'' verbs differ from the ''-er'' verbs in the following points:
* The vowel of the inflections is always ''-i-,'' for example ''-isse'' in the past subjunctive rather than the ''-asse'' of the ''-er'' verbs.
* A few of the singular inflections themselves change, though this is purely orthographic and does not affect the pronunciation: in the simple present and past, these are ''-s, -s, -t'' rather than ''-Ø, -s, -Ø.'' (The change in pronunciation is due to the change of vowel from ''e, ai, a'' to ''-i-.'')
* In the simple present, imperfect, the present subjunctive, and the gerund, a suffix ''-iss-'' {{IPA|/is/}} appears between the root and the inflectional endings. In the simple present singular, this suffix has disappeared and the endings are ''-is, -is, -it.''

Auxiliary verb: ''avoir'' (''partir'' uses ''être'')

;''haïr''
The verb ''haïr'' loses its diaeresis in the singular of the simple present tense (the ''i'' loses its trema, reflecting the pronunciation of the initial syllable as a single vowel {{IPA|/ɛ/}} rather than the hiatus {{IPA|/ai/}}): ''je hais, tu hais, il/elle hait'' but ''nous haïssons, vous haïssez, ils/elles haïssent'' {{IPA|/ʒə ɛ, ty ɛ, il ɛ, nu aisɔ̃, vu aise, il ais/}}. ''Hais'' is as usual used for the imperative. In all other forms, the root is {{IPA|/ai/}} (imperfect and present &amp; past subjunctive {{IPA|/ais/}}-, future and conditional {{IPA|/aiʁ/}}-).
Another conjugation is used in [[Quebec French]] that keeps the two syllables stem with the hiatus {{IPA|/ai/}}, and therefore the diaeresis for all the paradigm: ''J'haïs, tu haïs, il/elle haït, nous haïssons, vous haïssez, ils/elles haïssent''. Note that the ''h'' of ''haïr'' is mute in Quebec French, hence the [[elision]] for ''j'haïs'' /ʒai/ compared to European French ''je hais'' /ʒə.ɛ/.

==Third group==

===First sub-conjugation: Verbs with seven principal parts===
Most irregular French verbs can be described with seven [[principal parts]].  In reality, few if any verbs have separate stems for all seven parts; instead, they tend to "inherit" the same stem as another part.  Note that the endings for these verbs are basically the same as for regular ''-ir'' verbs; in fact, regular ''-ir'' verbs can be fit into this scheme by treating the ''-iss-'' variants as different principal parts.

{|class="wikitable"
! Principal part !! How to get the stem !! "Inherited" (regular) value of stem
|-
| [[infinitive]] || Remove ending ''-er, -ir, -oir, -re'' || —
|-
| First singular [[present indicative]] || Remove ending ''-s, -e'' || Infinitive stem
|-
| First plural [[present indicative]] || Remove ending ''-ons'' || Infinitive stem
|-
| Third plural [[present indicative]] || Remove ending ''-ent'' || First plural present stem
|-
| (First singular) future || Remove ending ''-ai'' || Full infinitive stem (minus any ''-e'')
|-
| (Masculine singular) [[past participle]] || Full word || Infinitive stem, plus ''-i'' (plus ''-u'' if ends ''-re'')
|-
| (First singular) simple past || Remove ending ''-s, -ai'' || Past participle (minus any ''-s'' or ''-t'')
|}

The following table shows how the paradigm of an irregular verb is constructed from its principal parts.  Note that a few verbs construct the present indicative (especially the singular) differently.

The following table gives principal parts for a number of irregular verbs.  There are a number of fair-sized groups of verbs that are conjugated alike; these are listed first.  There are some additional irregularities in the present indicative, which are listed below.  Nearly all irregularities affect the singular, and are purely issues of spelling. (Stems that are irregular in the sense of being unpredictable by the above rules are given in '''boldface'''.)

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Only in Quebec French

&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; The ending ''-t'' is regularly dropped when directly following a ''d'' or ''t'' (e.g. ''il vend'' "he sells", not ''*il vendt'').

&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Alternation of "-ai-" and  ''-oi-'' before consonant or unstressed ''e'', "-ay-" and ''-oy-'' before other vowels is automatic in all verbs.

The following table shows an example paradigm of one of these verbs, ''recevoir'' "to receive".

===Verbs with eleven principal parts===

Nine verbs also have an irregular subjunctive stem, used at least for the singular and third plural of the present subjunctive.  These verbs can be said to have 11 principal parts, because the subjunctive stem may or may not be used for the first and second plural present subjunctive, the imperative and/or the present participle, in ways that vary from verb to verb.

The following table shows how the paradigm of an 11-principal-part irregular verb is constructed from its principal parts.  Note that these verbs are generally the most irregular verbs in French, and many of them construct the present indicative (especially the singular) in an idiosyncratic fashion.  The verb ''aller'' also constructs its past participle and simple past differently, according to the endings for ''-er'' verbs.

===''Aller''===
The verb ''aller'' means "to go" and is sufficiently irregular that it merits listing its conjugation in full.  It is the only verb with the first group ending "er" to have an irregular conjugation. It belongs to none of the three sections of the third group, and is often categorized on its own.
The verb has different stems for different tenses. These are all pronounced differently: past ''all-'' {{IPA|/al/}} (simple past, imperfect, past subjunctive);  present subjunctive ''aill-'' {{IPA|/aj/}}; conditional and future ''ir-'' {{IPA|/iʁ/}}. The inflections of these tenses are completely regular, and pronounced as in any other ''-er'' verb. However, in the simple present, not only are there stem changes, but the inflections are irregular as well:

* Infinitive: aller
* Present participle: allant
* Gerundive: en allant
* Verbal adjective: allant(e)(s)
* Past participle: allé(e)(s)

Auxiliary verb: ''être''

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; In Classical French and even in certain dialects (like in Cajun and some Quebec dialects) ''je vas'' is used.

1. In an interrogative sentence, the final ''e'' is written ''é'' (traditional spelling) or ''è'' (rectified spelling), and is pronounced as an open ''è'' {{IPA|[ɛ]}}. Additionally, the ''e'' in ''je'' becomes silent. For example: je marche {{IPA|/ʒə.maʁʃ/}} (I walk), marchè-je? {{IPA|/maʁʃɛʒ/}} (do I walk?)

2. The following verbs have the ending ''-ont'': ''ils sont ''(they are), ''ils ont ''(they have), ''ils font ''(they do), '' ils vont ''(they go).

2.1. Only the verb ''être'' has irregular endings here: ''nous sommes ''(we are), ''que je soi-s ''(that I be), ''que tu soi-s ''(that you be).

2.2. The following verbs (and their derivatives) have the ending ''-es'': ''vous êtes'' (you are), ''vous faites'' (you do), ''vous dites'' (you tell).

2.3. Only the verbs ''être'' and ''avoir'' take a final ''t: qu'il/elle/on soi-t ''(that it/he/she/we be), ''qu'il/elle/on ai-t ''(that it/he/she/we have).

3. Only in ''je/tu peux'' (I/you can), ''je/tu veux'' (I/you want), and ''je/tu vaux'' (I am/you are 'worth').

4. Verbs in ''-dre'' have a final ''d'' for the 3rd singular person, except for those ending in ''-indre'' and ''-soudre'' which take a final ''t''. The verbs ''vaincre'' (defeat) and ''convaincre'' (convince) are conjugated as ''vainc'' and ''convainc'', respectively, in 3rd singular person.

5. The only verbs having this ending are: ''assaillir'' (assail), ''couvrir'' (cover), ''cueillir'' (pluck), ''défaillir'' (default), ''offrir'' (offer), ''ouvrir'' (open), ''souffrir'' (suffer), ''tressaillir'' (shiver), and in the imperative only, ''avoir'' (have), ''savoir'' (know), and ''vouloir'' (want).

The first-person plural ending ''-ons'', as well as the nominative first-person plural pronoun ''nous'' ("we"), is rarely used in modern spoken French (use of object ''nous'' ("us"), however, remains widespread).&lt;ref name="vanCompernolle2008"&gt;{{cite journal |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=85–110 |year=2008 |last=van Compernolle |first=Rémi A. |title=''Nous'' versus ''on'': Pronouns with first-person plural reference in synchronous French chat |journal=Canadian Journal of Applied Linguistics |url=https://journals.lib.unb.ca/index.php/CJAL/article/download/19917/21774}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pronoun ''on'', which can also serve as the [[impersonal pronoun]] and uses the third-person singular form of the verb, is widely used instead. For example, ''nous chantons'' ("we sing" or "we are singing"), is likely to be replaced by ''on chante'' in almost all contexts except in very careful language. This almost leads to a loss of a verb form in Modern French. However, the verb ending ''-ons'' can still be found in the imperative: ''Chantons&amp;nbsp;!'' ("Let's sing!"), which can also be replaced in some contexts by ''On chante&amp;nbsp;!''

'''Gopal Hari Deshmukh''' (18 February 1823&amp;nbsp;– 9 October 1892) was an Indian activist, [[intellectual|thinker]], [[social reformer]] and writer from [[Maharashtra]]. His original surname was Shidhaye. Because of [[Vatandar|'Vatan']] (right of Tax collection) that the family had received,the family  was later called [[Deshmukh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Golden Book of India: A Genealogical and Biographical Dictionary of the Ruling Princes, Chiefs, Nobles, and Other Personages, Titled Or Decorated of the Indian Empire|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=7iOsNUZ2MXgC|publisher=Aakar Books|year=1893|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Deshmukh is regarded as an important figure of the Social Reform Movement in [[Maharashtra]].

==Early life==
Gopal Hari Deshmukh was born into a [[Chitpawan]] family, a subcaste of [[Maharashtrian Brahmin]]s, in 1823. His father was the treasurer of [[Bapu Gokhale]], the general of [[Bajirao II]] during the [[Third Anglo-Maratha War]]. Deshmukh studied at the Poona English Medium School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gokhale: The Indian Moderates and the British Raj|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pI19BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA17#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1977|page=17|author=Bal Ram Nanda|quote=His[Deshmukh's] family of Chitpawan Brahmans, one of the greatest beneficiaries of the Peshwa regime...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Deshmukh started his career as a translator for the government then under [[British Raj]]. In 1867, the government appointed him a small cause judge in [[Ahmedabad]], [[Gujarat]]. He worked as a Diwan also in Ratlam state. The government had honoured him while he was working only, as a 'Justice of Peace' and 'Raobahadur'. He retired as a sessions judge. He held many other important positions, including those of the Assistant Inam Commissioner, Joint Judge of Nasik High Court, and Member of the Law Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Language Politics, Elites, and the Public Sphere|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=ATq1nRGNF0QC|publisher=Orient Blackswan|year=2001|page=83-84}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Social activism==
===Social work in Maharashtra===
At age 25, Deshmukh started writing articles aimed at social reform in Maharashtra in the weekly ''Prabhakar'' (प्रभाकर) under the pen name ''Lokhitawadi'' (लोकहितवादी). In the first two years, he penned 108 articles on social reform. That group of articles has  come to be known in Marathi literature as ''Lokhitawadinchi Shatapatre'' (लोकहितवादींची शतपत्रे).

He promoted emancipation (liberation) and education of women, and wrote against arranged [[child marriage]]s, [[dowry]] system, and [[polygamy]], all of which were prevalent in India in his times.

He wrote against the evils of the [[caste system]] which was strongly prevalent in India in his times, condemned harmful [[Hindu]] religious orthodoxy, and attacked the monopoly in religious matters and rituals which [[Brahmin]] priests had through a long tradition. (Noteworthily, Deshmukh belonged to the Brahmin class.) He enunciated certain 15 principles for bringing about religious reform in Hindu society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Language Politics, Elites, and the Public Sphere|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=ATq1nRGNF0QC|publisher=Orient Blackswan|year=2001|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deshmukh founded a public library in Pune under the leadership of the then governor of the state of [[Bombay]], Henry Brown. He also donated some books to Univ. of Bombay (1875) Library, when it was established by British people. His personal collection is added to Univ. of Mumbai - J.N.Library, Vidyanagari, Mumbai -400098 − called as "Deshmukh collection". His life-size portrait (with some amount to add some new books from its interest every year) is donated to Univ. of Mumbai Library by his 5th generation − Mr. Ajit S. Deshmukh &amp; Librarian/Poet/Translator- Mrs. Jyoti (Deshmukh) Kunte in his Death Centenary year 1992, for the benefit of students doing research on his work.

He took a leadership role in founding ''Gyan Prakash'' (ज्ञानप्रकाश), ''[[Indu Prakash]]'' (इंदुप्रकाश), and ''Lokhitwadi'' (लोकहितवादी) periodicals in Maharashtra.

===Social work in Gujarat===
While Deshmukh was serving as a judge in Ahmedabad, he organized in that city annual speech conferences on social issues under the sponsorship of Premabhai Institute, and also himself delivered speeches. He established in Ahmedabad a branch of [[Prarthana Samaj]], founded an institute promoting remarriages of widows, and invigorated Gujarat Vernacular Society. He started a weekly ''Hitechchhu'' (‘हितेच्छु) in both Gujarati and English. He also started " Gujarati Budhhi-Wardhak Sabha".

==Books==
Deshmukh wrote 35 books on diverse topics, including religious, social, economic, political, historic, and literary matters. He also translated some English works into Marathi. Many books are written 'on him &amp; his work' by famous writers.

[[File:Little Chalfont, Lodge Lane - geograph.org.uk - 102231.jpg|thumb|Little Chalfont, Lodge Lane: a greenfield site located in the south east of England.]]

'''Greenfield land''' is undeveloped land in a city or rural area either used for [[agriculture]] or landscape design, or left to evolve naturally. These areas of land are usually agricultural or amenity properties being considered for urban development.

Greenfield land can be unfenced open fields, urban lots or restricted closed properties, kept off limits to the general public by a private or government entity.

Rather than building upon greenfield land, a developer may choose to redevelop [[brownfield land|brownfield]] or [[greyfield land]]s, areas that have been developed but left abandoned or underused.

==Use of term in cable industry==
A greenfield development is a welcome opportunity for a cable operator to choose (and install) new equipment, without having to consider any migration issues related to legacy equipment. Equipment for the local distribution hub can be chosen solely on its own merits, taking into consideration permitting, aesthetic objections, and construction costs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31456">{{Other uses|Interpretation (disambiguation)}}

An '''interpretation''' is an assignment of meaning to the [[symbol (formal)|symbols]] of a [[formal language]]. Many formal languages used in [[mathematics]], [[logic]], and [[theoretical computer science]] are defined in solely [[syntax|syntactic]] terms, and as such do not have any meaning until they are given some interpretation. The general study of interpretations of formal languages is called [[formal semantics (logic)|formal semantics]].

The most commonly studied formal logics are [[propositional logic]], [[predicate logic]] and their [[modal logic|modal]] analogs, and for these there are standard ways of presenting an interpretation. In these contexts an interpretation is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] that provides the [[extension (predicate logic)|extension]] of symbols and strings of symbols of an object language. For example, an interpretation function could take the predicate ''T'' (for "tall") and assign it the extension {''a''} (for "Abraham Lincoln"). Note that all our interpretation does is assign the extension {a} to the non-logical constant ''T'', and does not make a claim about whether ''T'' is to stand for tall and 'a' for Abraham Lincoln. Nor does logical interpretation have anything to say about logical connectives like 'and', 'or' and 'not'.  Though ''we'' may take these symbols to stand for certain things or concepts, this is not determined by the interpretation function.

An interpretation often (but not always) provides a way to determine the [[truth value]]s of [[sentence (mathematical logic)|sentences]] in a language. If a given interpretation assigns the value True to a sentence or [[theory (mathematical logic)|theory]], the interpretation is called a [[model (model theory)|model]] of that sentence or theory.

== Formal languages ==
{{main|Formal language}}

A formal language consists of a possibly infinite set of ''sentences'' (variously  called ''words'' or ''[[well formed formula|formulas]]'') built from a fixed set of ''letters'' or ''symbols''. The inventory from which these letters are taken is called the ''[[alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]]'' over which the language is defined. To distinguish the strings of symbols that are in a formal language from arbitrary strings of symbols, the former are sometimes called ''[[Well-formed_formula|well-formed formulæ]]'' (wff). The essential feature of a formal language is that its syntax can be defined without reference to interpretation. For example, we can determine that (''P'' or ''Q'') is a well-formed formula even without knowing whether it is true or false.

=== Example ===
A formal language &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{W}&lt;/math&gt; can be defined with the
alphabet &lt;math&gt;\alpha = \{ \triangle, \square \}&lt;/math&gt;, and with a word being in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{W}&lt;/math&gt; if it begins with &lt;math&gt;\triangle&lt;/math&gt; and is composed solely of the symbols &lt;math&gt;\triangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;.

A possible interpretation of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{W}&lt;/math&gt; could assign the decimal digit '1' to &lt;math&gt;\triangle&lt;/math&gt; and '0' to &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\triangle \square \triangle&lt;/math&gt; would denote 101 under this interpretation of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{W}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Logical constants ===
In the specific cases of propositional logic and predicate logic, the formal languages considered have alphabets that are divided into two sets: the logical symbols ([[logical constant]]s) and the non-logical symbols.  The idea behind this terminology is that ''logical'' symbols have the same meaning regardless of the subject matter being studied, while ''non-logical'' symbols change in meaning depending on the area of investigation.

Logical constants are always given the same meaning by every interpretation of the standard kind, so that only the meanings of the non-logical symbols are changed. Logical constants include quantifier symbols ∀ ("all") and ∃ ("some"), symbols for [[logical connective]]s ∧ ("and"), ∨ ("or"), ¬ ("not"), parentheses and other grouping symbols, and (in many treatments) the equality symbol =.

== General properties of truth-functional interpretations ==
Many of the commonly studied interpretations associate each sentence in a formal language with a single truth value, either True or False. These interpretations are called ''truth functional'';{{dubious|reason=The article 'Truth-functional' gives a more restricted definition: the truth-value of a compound sentence should be a function of the truth-value of its sub-sentences.|date=September 2015}} they include the usual interpretations of propositional and first-order logic. The sentences that are made true by a particular assignment are said to be ''[[satisfiable|satisfied]]'' by that assignment.

No sentence can be made both true and false by the same interpretation,{{dubious|reason=Except for paraconsistent logic.|date=September 2015}} but it is possible that the truth value of the same sentence can be different under different interpretations.  A sentence is ''[[Consistency|consistent]]'' if it is true under at least one interpretation; otherwise it is ''inconsistent''. A sentence φ is said to be ''logically valid'' if it is satisfied by every interpretation (if φ is satisfied by every interpretation that satisfies ψ then φ is said to be a ''[[logical consequence]]'' of ψ).

=== Logical connectives ===
Some of the logical symbols of a language (other than quantifiers) are [[logical connective|truth-functional connectives]] that represent truth functions&amp;nbsp;— functions that take truth values as arguments and return truth values as outputs (in other words, these are operations on truth values of sentences).

The truth-functional connectives enable compound sentences to be built up from simpler sentences. In this way, the truth value of the compound sentence is defined as a certain truth function of the truth values of the simpler sentences. The connectives are usually taken to be [[logical constant]]s, meaning that the meaning of the connectives is always the same, independent of what interpretations are given to the other symbols in a formula.

This is how we define logical connectives in propositional logic:
*¬Φ is True [[iff]] Φ is False.
*(Φ ∧ Ψ) is True iff Φ is True and Ψ is True.
*(Φ ∨ Ψ) is True iff Φ is True or Ψ is True (or both are True).
*(Φ → Ψ) is True iff ¬Φ is True or Ψ is True (or both are True).
*(Φ ↔ Ψ) is True iff (Φ → Ψ) is True and (Ψ → Φ) is True.

So under a given interpretation of all the sentence letters Φ and Ψ (i.e., after assigning a truth-value to each sentence letter), we can determine the truth-values of all formulas that have them as constituents, as a function of the logical connectives. The following table shows how this kind of thing looks. The first two columns show the truth-values of the sentence letters as determined by the four possible interpretations. The other columns show the truth-values of formulas built from these sentence letters, with truth-values determined recursively.

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center; margin: 1em auto;"
|+ Logical connectives
!  Interpretation !! Φ !! Ψ !! ¬Φ !! (Φ ∧ Ψ) !! (Φ ∨ Ψ) !! (Φ → Ψ) !! (Φ ↔ Ψ)
|-
|#1|| T || T || F || T || T || T || T
|-
|#2|| T || F || F || F || T || F || F
|-
|#3|| F || T || T || F || T || T || F
|-
|#4|| F || F || T || F || F || T || T
|}

Now it is easier to see what makes a formula logically valid. Take the formula ''F'': (Φ ∨ ¬Φ). If our interpretation function makes Φ True, then ¬Φ is made False by the negation connective. Since the disjunct Φ of ''F'' is True under that interpretation, ''F'' is True. Now the only other possible interpretation of Φ makes it False, and if so, ¬Φ is made True by the negation function. That would make ''F'' True again, since one of ''F''s disjuncts, ¬Φ, would be true under this interpretation. Since these two interpretations for ''F'' are the only possible logical interpretations, and since ''F'' comes out True for both, we say that it is logically valid or tautologous.

== Interpretation of a theory ==
{{Main|Theory (mathematical logic)}}

An ''interpretation of a theory'' is the relationship between a theory and some subject matter when there is a [[many-to-one]] correspondence between certain elementary statements of the theory, and certain statements related to the subject matter. If every elementary statement in the theory has a correspondent it is called a ''full interpretation'', otherwise it is called a ''partial interpretation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Haskell Curry]] |title=Foundations of Mathematical Logic |publisher=Mcgraw Hill |date=1963}} Here: p.48&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretations for propositional logic ==
The formal language for [[propositional logic]] consists of formulas built up from propositional symbols (also called sentential symbols, sentential variables, and propositional variables) and logical connectives.  The only [[non-logical symbol]]s in a formal language for propositional logic are the propositional symbols, which are often denoted by capital letters. To make the formal language precise, a specific set of propositional symbols must be fixed.

The standard kind of interpretation in this setting is a function that maps each propositional symbol to one of the [[truth value]]s true and false. This function is known as a ''truth assignment'' or ''valuation'' function. In many presentations, it is literally a truth value that is assigned, but some presentations assign [[truthbearer]]s instead.

For a language with ''n'' distinct propositional variables there are 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; distinct possible interpretations. For any particular variable ''a'', for example, there are 2&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;=2 possible interpretations: 1) ''a'' is assigned '''T''', or 2) ''a'' is assigned '''F'''. For the pair ''a'', ''b'' there are 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=4 possible interpretations: 1) both are assigned '''T''', 2) both are assigned '''F''', 3) ''a'' is assigned '''T''' and ''b'' is assigned '''F''', or 4) ''a'' is assigned '''F''' and ''b'' is assigned '''T'''.

Given any truth assignment for a set of propositional symbols, there is a unique extension to an interpretation for all the propositional formulas built up from those variables. This extended interpretation is defined inductively, using the truth-table definitions of the logical connectives discussed above.

== First-order logic ==
Unlike propositional logic, where every language is the same apart from a choice of a different set of propositional variables, there are many different first-order languages. Each first-order language is defined by a [[signature (mathematical logic)|signature]].  The signature consists of a set of non-logical symbols and an identification of each of these symbols as a constant symbol, a function symbol, or a predicate symbol.  In the case of function and predicate symbols, a natural number [[arity]] is also assigned. The alphabet for the formal language consists of logical constants, the equality relation symbol =, all the symbols from the signature, and an additional infinite set of symbols known as variables.

For example, in the language of [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], there are constant symbols 0 and 1, two binary function symbols + and ·, and no binary relation symbols. (Here the equality relation is taken as a logical constant.)

Again, we might define a first-order language '''L''', as consisting of individual symbols a, b, and c; predicate symbols F, G, H, I and J; variables x, y, z; no function letters; no sentential symbols.

=== Formal languages for first-order logic ===
Given a signature σ, the corresponding formal language is known as the set of σ-formulas. Each σ-formula is built up out of atomic formulas by means of logical connectives; atomic formulas are built from terms using predicate symbols.  The formal definition of the set of σ-formulas proceeds in the other direction: first, terms are assembled from the constant and function symbols together with the variables. Then, terms can be combined into an atomic formula using a predicate symbol (relation symbol) from the signature or the special predicate symbol "=" for equality (see the section "[[#Interpreting equality|Interpreting equality"]] below). Finally, the formulas of the language are assembled from atomic formulas using the logical connectives and quantifiers.

=== Interpretations of a first-order language ===
To ascribe meaning to all sentences of a first-order language, the following information is needed.
* A [[domain of discourse]]&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes called the "universe of disourse"&lt;/ref&gt; ''D'', usually required to be non-empty (see below).
* For every constant symbol, an element of ''D'' as its interpretation.
* For every ''n''-ary function symbol, an ''n''-ary function from ''D'' to ''D'' as its interpretation (that is, a function ''D&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''D'').
* For every ''n''-ary predicate symbol, an ''n''-ary relation on ''D'' as its interpretation (that is, a subset of ''D&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'').
An object carrying this information is known as a [[structure (mathematical logic)|structure]] ({{not a typo|of}} signature σ), or σ-structure, or ''L''-structure, or as a "model".

The information specified in the interpretation provides enough information to give a truth value to any atomic formula, after each of its [[free variable]]s, if any, has been replaced by an element of the domain. The truth value of an arbitrary sentence is then defined inductively using the [[T-schema]], which is a definition of first-order semantics developed by Alfred Tarski. The T-schema interprets the logical connectives using truth tables, as discussed above. Thus, for example, {{nowrap|φ &amp; ψ}} is satisfied if and only if both φ and ψ are satisfied.

This leaves the issue of how to interpret formulas of the form {{nowrap|∀ ''x'' φ(''x'')}} and {{nowrap|∃ ''x'' φ(''x'')}}. The domain of discourse forms the [[range (mathematics)|range]] for these quantifiers. The idea is that the sentence {{nowrap|∀ ''x'' φ(''x'')}} is true under an interpretation exactly when every substitution instance of φ(''x''), where ''x'' is replaced by some element of the domain, is satisfied. The formula {{nowrap|∃ ''x'' φ(''x'')}} is satisfied if there is at least one element ''d'' of the domain such that φ(''d'') is satisfied.

Strictly speaking, a substitution instance such as the formula φ(''d'') mentioned above is not a formula in the original formal language of φ, because ''d'' is an element of the domain. There are two ways of handling this technical issue. The first is to pass to a larger language in which each element of the domain is named by a constant symbol. The second is to add to the interpretation a function that assigns each variable to an element of the domain. Then the T-schema can quantify over variations of the original interpretation in which this variable assignment function is changed, instead of quantifying over substitution instances.

Some authors also admit [[propositional variable]]s in first-order logic, which must then also be interpreted. A propositional variable can stand on its own as an atomic formula. The interpretation of a propositional variable is one of the two truth values ''true'' and ''false.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Because the first-order interpretations described here are defined in set theory, they do not associate each predicate symbol with a property&lt;ref&gt;The extension of a property (also called an attribute) is a set of individuals, so a property is a unary relation. E.g. The properties "yellow" and "prime" are unary relations.&lt;/ref&gt;(or relation), but rather with the extension of that property (or relation). In other words, these first-order interpretations are [[Extensional definition|extensional]]&lt;ref&gt;see also [[Extension (predicate logic)]]&lt;/ref&gt; not [[Intensional definition|intensional]].

=== Example of a first-order interpretation ===
An example of interpretation &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; of the language '''L''' described above is as follows.
* Domain: A chess set
* Individual constants: a: The white King b: The black Queen c: The white King's pawn
* F(x): x is a piece
* G(x): x is a pawn
* H(x): x is black
* I(x): x is white
* J(x, y): x can capture y

In the interpretation &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; of L:
* the following are true sentences: F(a), G(c), H(b), I(a) J(b, c),
* the following are false sentences: J(a, c), G(a).

=== Non-empty domain requirement === &lt;!--Please preserve this section heading; it is being used in another article --&gt;
As stated above, a first-order interpretation is usually required to specify a nonempty set as the domain of discourse. The reason for this requirement is to guarantee that equivalences such as
::&lt;math&gt;(\phi \lor \exists x \psi) \leftrightarrow \exists x (\phi \lor \psi)&lt;/math&gt;,
where ''x'' is not a free variable of φ, are logically valid. This equivalence holds in every interpretation with a nonempty domain, but does not always hold when empty domains are permitted. For example, the equivalence
:&lt;math&gt;[\forall y (y = y) \lor \exists x ( x = x)] \equiv \exists x [ \forall y ( y = y) \lor x = x]&lt;/math&gt;
fails in any structure with an empty domain.  Thus the proof theory of first-order logic becomes more complicated when empty structures are permitted. However, the gain in allowing them is negligible, as both the intended interpretations and the interesting interpretations of the theories people study have non-empty domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Hailperin | first1=Theodore | title=Quantification theory and empty individual-domains |mr=0057820 | year=1953 | journal=The Journal of Symbolic Logic | volume=18 | pages=197–200 | doi=10.2307/2267402 | issue=3 | publisher=Association for Symbolic Logic | jstor=2267402}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Quine | first1=W. V. | title=Quantification and the empty domain |mr=0064715 | year=1954 | journal=The Journal of Symbolic Logic | volume=19 | pages=177–179 | doi=10.2307/2268615 | issue=3 | publisher=Association for Symbolic Logic | jstor=2268615}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Empty relations do not cause any problem for first-order interpretations, because there is no similar notion of passing a relation symbol across a logical connective, enlarging its scope in the process. Thus it is acceptable for relation symbols to be interpreted as being identically false. However, the interpretation of a function symbol must always assign a well-defined and total function to the symbol.

=== Interpreting equality ===
The equality relation is often treated specially in first order logic and other predicate logics. There are two general approaches.

The first approach is to treat equality as no different than any other binary relation. In this case, if an equality symbol is included in the signature, it is usually necessary to add various axioms about equality to axiom systems (for example, the substitution axiom saying that if ''a'' = ''b'' and ''R''(''a'') holds then ''R''(''b'') holds as well). This approach to equality is most useful when studying signatures that do not include the equality relation, such as the signature for [[set theory]] or the signature for [[second-order arithmetic]] in which there is only an equality relation for numbers, but not an equality relation for set of numbers.

The second approach is to treat the equality relation symbol as a logical constant that must be interpreted by the real equality relation in any interpretation. An interpretation that interprets equality this way is known as a ''normal model'', so this second approach is the same as only studying interpretations that happen to be normal models. The advantage of this approach is that the axioms related to equality are automatically satisfied by every normal model, and so they do not need to be explicitly included in first-order theories when equality is treated this way. This second approach is sometimes called ''first order logic with equality'', but many authors adopt it for the general study of first-order logic without comment.

There are a few other reasons to restrict study of first-order logic to normal models. First, it is known that any first-order interpretation in which equality is interpreted by an [[equivalence relation]] and satisfies the substitution axioms for equality can be cut down to an [[elementary substructure|elementarily equivalent]] interpretation on a subset of the original domain. Thus there is little additional generality in studying non-normal models. Second, if non-normal models are considered, then every consistent theory has an infinite model; this affects the statements of results such as the [[Löwenheim–Skolem theorem]], which are usually stated under the assumption that only normal models are considered.

=== Many-sorted first-order logic ===
A generalization of first order logic considers languages with more than one ''sort'' of variables. The idea is different sorts of variables represent different types of objects. Every sort of variable can be quantified; thus an interpretation for a many-sorted language has a separate domain for each of the sorts of variables to range over (there is an infinite collection of variables of each of the different sorts). Function and relation symbols, in addition to having arities, are specified so that each of their arguments must come from a certain sort.

One example of many-sorted logic is for planar [[Euclidean geometry]]. There are two sorts; points and lines. There is an equality relation symbol for points, an equality relation symbol for lines, and a binary incidence relation ''E'' which takes one point variable and one line variable. The intended interpretation of this language has the point variables range over all points on the [[Euclidean plane]], the line variable range over all lines on the plane, and the incidence relation ''E''(''p'',''l'') holds if and only if point ''p'' is on line ''l''.

== Higher-order predicate logics ==
A formal language for [[higher-order logic|higher-order predicate logic]] looks much the same as a formal language for first-order logic. The difference is that there are now many different types of variables. Some variables correspond to elements of the domain, as in first-order logic. Other variables correspond to objects of higher type: subsets of the domain, functions from the domain, functions that take a subset of the domain and return a function from the domain to subsets of the domain, etc.  All of these types of variables can be quantified.

There are two kinds of interpretations commonly employed for higher-order logic. ''Full semantics'' require that, once the domain of discourse is satisfied, the higher-order variables range over all possible elements of the correct type (all subsets of the domain, all functions from the domain to itself, etc.). Thus the specification of a full interpretation is the same as the specification of a first-order interpretation. ''Henkin semantics'', which are essentially multi-sorted first-order semantics, require the interpretation to specify a separate domain for each type of higher-order variable to range over. Thus an interpretation in Henkin semantics includes a domain ''D'', a collection of subsets of ''D'', a collection of functions from ''D'' to ''D'', etc.  The relationship between these two semantics is an important topic in higher order logic.

== Non-classical interpretations ==
The interpretations of propositional logic and predicate logic described above are not the only possible interpretations. In particular, there are other types of interpretations that are used in the study of [[non-classical logic]] (such as [[intuitionistic logic]]), and in the study of modal logic.

Interpretations used to study non-classical logic include [[topological model]]s, [[Boolean-valued model]]s, and [[Kripke model]]s.  [[Modal logic]] is also studied using Kripke models.

== Intended interpretations ==
Many formal languages are associated with a particular interpretation that is used to motivate them. For example, the first-order signature for set theory includes only one binary relation, ∈, which is intended to represent set membership, and the domain of discourse in a first-order theory of the natural numbers is intended to be the set of natural numbers.

The intended interpretation is called the ''standard model'' (a term introduced by [[Abraham Robinson]] in 1960).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Anthonie Meijers|title=Philosophy of technology and engineering sciences|year=2009|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-444-51667-1|series=Handbook of the Philosophy of Science|volume=9|author=Roland Müller|chapter=The Notion of a Model}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of [[Peano arithmetic]], it consists of the natural numbers with their ordinary arithmetical operations. All models that are [[isomorphic]] to the one just given are also called standard; these models all satisfy the [[Peano axioms]]. There are also [[Peano axioms#Nonstandard models|non-standard models of the (first-order version of the) Peano axioms]], which contain elements not correlated with any natural number.

While the intended interpretation can have no explicit indication in the strictly formal [[deductive system|syntactical rules]], it naturally affects the choice of the [[formal grammar|formation]] and [[transformation rules]] of the syntactical system. For example, [[primitive notion|primitive signs]] must permit expression of the concepts to be modeled; [[sentential formula]]s are chosen so that their counterparts in the intended interpretation are [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaningful]] [[declarative sentence]]s; [[axiom|primitive sentences]] need to come out as [[Truth|true]] [[sentence (mathematical logic)|sentences]] in the interpretation; [[rules of inference]] must be such that, if the sentence &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}_j&lt;/math&gt; is directly [[formal proof|derivable]] from a sentence &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}_i&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}_i \to \mathcal{I}_j&lt;/math&gt; turns out to be a true sentence, with {{imp}} meaning [[material conditional|implication]], as usual. These requirements ensure that all [[formal proof|provable]] sentences also come out to be true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Rudolf Carnap]] |title=Introduction to Symbolic Logic and its Applications |publisher=Dover publications| location=New York |date=1958 |isbn=9780486604534}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most formal systems have many more models than they were intended to have (the existence of [[non-standard model]]s is an example). When we speak about 'models' in [[empirical science]]s, we mean, if we want [[reality]] to be a model of our science, to speak about an ''intended model''. A model in the empirical sciences is an ''intended factually-true descriptive interpretation'' (or in other contexts: a non-intended arbitrary interpretation used to clarify such an intended factually-true descriptive interpretation.) All models are interpretations that have the same [[domain of discourse]] as the intended one, but other [[value assignment|assignments]] for [[non-logical constant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Hans Freudenthal |title=The Concept and the Role of the Model in Mathematics and Natural and Social Sciences (Colloquium proceedings)|publisher=Springer |isbn= 978-94-010-3669-6 |date=Jan 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|reason=Every chapter is written by a different author.|date=September 2015}}

=== Example ===

Given a simple formal system (we shall call this one &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{FS'}&lt;/math&gt;) whose alphabet α consists only of three symbols &lt;math&gt;\{ \blacksquare, \bigstar, \blacklozenge \}&lt;/math&gt; and whose formation rule for formulas is:
: 'Any string of symbols of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{FS'}&lt;/math&gt; which is at least 6 symbols long, and which is not infinitely long, is a formula of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{FS'}&lt;/math&gt;. Nothing else is a formula of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{FS'}&lt;/math&gt;.'

The single [[axiom schema]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{FS'}&lt;/math&gt; is:

: " &lt;math&gt;\blacksquare \ \bigstar \ast \blacklozenge \ \blacksquare \ast&lt;/math&gt; " (where " &lt;math&gt;\ast&lt;/math&gt; " is a [[metasyntactic variable]] standing for a finite string of " &lt;math&gt;\blacksquare&lt;/math&gt; "s )

A formal proof can be constructed as follows:
# &lt;math&gt;\blacksquare \ \bigstar \ \blacksquare \ \blacklozenge \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\blacksquare \ \bigstar \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare \ \blacklozenge \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\blacksquare \ \bigstar \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare \ \blacklozenge \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare&lt;/math&gt;

In this example the theorem produced " &lt;math&gt;\blacksquare \ \bigstar \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare \ \blacklozenge \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare&lt;/math&gt; " can be interpreted as meaning "One plus three equals four." A different interpretation would be to read it backwards as "Four minus three equals one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Geoffrey Hunter (logician)|Geoffrey Hunter]] |title=Metalogic: An Introduction to the Metatheory of Standard First Order Logic| publisher=University of California Press |date=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2015}}

== Other concepts of interpretation ==
There are other uses of the term "interpretation" that are commonly used, which do not refer to the assignment of meanings to formal languages.

In model theory, a structure ''A'' is said to interpret a structure ''B'' if there is a definable subset ''D'' of ''A'', and definable relations and functions on ''D'', such that ''B'' is isomorphic to the structure with domain ''D'' and these functions and relations. In some settings, it is not the domain ''D'' that is used, but rather ''D'' modulo an equivalence relation definable in ''A''.  For additional information, see [[Interpretation (model theory)]].

A theory ''T'' is said to interpret another theory ''S'' if there is a finite [[extension by definition]]s ''T''′ of ''T'' such that ''S'' is contained in ''T''′.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1875">'''John Lasarus Williams''' (29 October 1924 &amp;ndash; 15 June 2004), known as '''John L''', was a [[Welsh nationalist]] activist.

Williams was born in [[Llangoed]] on [[Anglesey]], but lived most of his life in nearby [[Llanfairpwllgwyngyll]].  In his youth, he was a keen footballer, and he also worked as a teacher.  His activism started when he campaigned against the refusal of Brewer Spinks, an employer in [[Blaenau Ffestiniog]], to permit his staff to speak [[Welsh language|Welsh]].  This inspired him to become a founder of Undeb y Gymraeg Fyw, and through this organisation was the main organiser of ''Sioe Gymraeg y Borth'' (the Welsh show for [[Menai Bridge]] using the colloquial form of its Welsh name).&lt;ref name="colli"&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/welsh/hi/newsid_3810000/newsid_3810200/3810259.stm Colli John L Williams]", ''[[BBC Cymru]]'', 15 June 2004 {{cy icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Williams also joined [[Plaid Cymru]].  He was a long-serving councillor on [[Gwynedd]] County Council, and was twice the party's candidate for [[Anglesey (UK Parliament constituency)|Anglesey]], at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1970|1970]] and [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 general election]]s.&lt;ref name="colli" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/welsh/hi/newsid_4280000/newsid_4283800/4283838.stm Seremoni i gofio arloeswr]", ''[[BBC Cymru]]'', 26 September 2005 {{cy icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Williams later worked at [[Bangor Normal College]], lecturing in Welsh.  He wrote a number of books, on history, the Welsh language, and also his autobiography.&lt;ref name="colli" /&gt;

In 2012 he published his first novel, entitled ''El talent'', with the publishing house Labreu Edicions. It narrates the experiences of a young couple who travels to Lisbon with a stolen prototype that can detect litarari talent.&lt;ref name="lv"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guillamon|first=Julià|title=Au, va, va, va, que ja hi som|journal=Cultura(s), La Vanguardia|date=9 May 2012|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks to this invention they are able to discover the hidden talent of several people, publish their work and earn a living.&lt;ref name="20m"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/1414603/0/catalan-jordi-nopca/estrena-novela/talent/|title=El catalán Jordi Nopca se estrena en la novela con 'Talent'|publisher=20minutos, EFE|date=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the author, the novel "should be placed before the crisis, that has led to a gradual dismantling of illusions, so this novel is pre-illusions lost".&lt;ref name="20m"/&gt;

The literary critic [[Julià Guillamon]] states in ''[[La Vanguardia]]'' that "his first novel is a wise foolish, full of references to ancient and modern authors, classics and fashion books, which are mixed in an rough history". According to Guillamon, "the flair of the novel is that it makes you slide very quickly, by dint of wit, hilarious dialogues and impossible narrative situations".&lt;ref name="lv"/&gt;

In 2013 he received the II Memorial Pere Rodeja, awarded by Catalan Association of Booksellers, for "offering to the readers a broad view, innovative and complete of the literary reality of our country".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Jordi Nopca, escriptor i periodista de l'ARA, rep el premi del Gremi de Llibreters|journal=Ara|date=26 June 2013|url=http://www.ara.cat/cultura/Jordi-Nopca-periodista-Gremi-Llibreters_0_944905724.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The acronym ''"Ladok"'' abbreviates the Swedish "'''''L'''okalt '''a'''db–baserat '''dok'''umentationssystem''" ("Local [[Electronic data processing|Edp]] based documentation system"). It is a student [[population registry|registration]] and grading documentation system, not to be confused with the admission system and with various [[learning management system]]s used at the universities. 

LADOK has been developed by the universities and has been controlled by ''Ladokkonsortiet'' ("the Ladok Consortium"). Each institution using the system has its own database which is limited to containing the results and registrations of its students; 
each handles its own service management on exactly one of the three certified service nodes, which are located in [[Umeå]], [[Uppsala]] and [[Lund]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2234">'''Landing area''' is an official designation of specialized Earth surface region by the international standard publication describing [[airfield]]s and [[airport]]s to aviators, the [[Aeronautical Information Publication]].  As such, it is directly translated into dozens of languages, wherever an [[Aeronautical Information Publication|AIP]] publication exists, which is one for every aviation-regulating country of the world. It is the most salient description of the ''[[logistics]] [[real estate]]'' which enable planes or helicopters or other aircraft to come and go.  It also has other meanings, which extend beyond aviation concepts and airport terminology, all of them military in kind.

A '''landing area''' may be:
# Any wrought, treated or merely selected ''surface'' of land, water, or a ship vessel's deck employed in a sustained way for either takeoff or landing of [[aircraft]]. 
# [[Area of operations|Operational area segment]] of an [[amphibious warfare|amphibious military unit]]. This may comprise the [[beach]], the over-water or over-land approaches to the said beach, as well as adjacent transport areas, airspace, or so-called ''fire support zones'', including airspace and terrain subjected to the presence or actions of [[Close air support|close-support aircraft]]. Usually this concept extends to any land included in any consequent military advance made.
# (''Airborne forces'') The area where landing troops are to be deployed, or supplies, either through [[Landing operation|air landing]] or [[air drop]], including [[drop zone]]s, [[landing strip]]s, adjacent airspace or body of water.

'''Limonese Creole''' (also called '''Limón Creole English''' or '''Mekatelyu''') is a dialect of [[Jamaican Creole]] spoken in [[Limón Province]] on the [[Caribbean Sea]] coast of [[Costa Rica]]. Limón Coastal Creole is similar to varieties such as [[Colón Creole]], [[Miskito Coastal Creole|Mískito Coastal Creole]], [[Belizean Kriol language|Belizian Kriol]], and [[San Andrés and Providencia Creole]]. The number of speakers is below 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=CR&lt;/ref&gt; Limón Coastal Creole does not have the status of an official language. It is very similar to [[Jamaican Creole]] and has borrowed many words from [[English language|English]].

Jamaican Creole was introduced to the Limón Province by [[Jamaica]]n migrant workers who arrived to work on the construction of the Atlantic [[railway]], the [[Banana plantation|banana plantations]] and on the Pacific railway.

The name ''Mekatelyu'' is a transliteration of the phrase "make I tell you", or in standard English "let me tell you". Linguists of the [[National University of Costa Rica|Universidad Nacional de Costa Rica]] and the [[University of Costa Rica|Universidad de Costa Rica]] consider it as not English.

When European countries went to Africa to [[Atlantic slave trade|take people for slavery]], they sent Africans from different countries who had no language in common to work on plantations in the Caribbean Islands. Those Africans had to develop a way to speak to communicate between themselves. If their slave driver spoke English, they started to learn it. Over time, those enslaved people created an English that was only understandable between them (a kind of pidgin) and then, they taught that way to speak to their children{{Em dash}}a [[creole language]].

Those speakers of [[creole English]] had a lot of contact with [[Scottish people|Scottish]], [[Irish people|Irish]] and [[English people]], so they had to learn to speak an [[English language|English]] that was more understandable to different nationalities (a "neutral" or [[standard English]]). Therefore, they created many ways to speak English, from the "most creole" to the "most standard" varying gradually according to the context.

Africans enslaved by the French developed a [[French-based creole languages|French creole]], but they had little or no contact with French speakers. So, their French creole became an independent language.

One common way to call the '''Limón Creole English''' in Costa Rica is by the term "[[Patois]]", a word was used initially by French. In France, there are [[Varieties of French|many ways to speak French]] and also [[Languages of France|many languages]] (including other romance languages as [[Provençal dialect|Provençal]]). This country needed to homogenize the language and declared the [[Parisian French|French of Paris]] as the correct [[French language|French]]. For that, the other [[varieties of French]] or the other [[Minority language|minority languages]] were considered incorrect or bad ways to speak and were called ''patois'' (that means to speak with the feet). The French creole was also considered patois because it differed to the French or Paris. By the pass of time, the meaning of the term patois expanded even more. As an analogy to the French creole, the English creole was also called with patois. When Costa Ricans talk about the Costa Rican Patois used in Limón, it is not clear if they mean the creole English (the most common creole) or the creole French.

Limón was once a very important [[port]] of the [[Caribbean]] and the English was an important language used there. There were French creole speakers that migrated to this region and had to learn English. As it was hard for these migrants to learn a new language as adults, they started to mix their native language (French creole) with the creole English. That is the reason why some Costa Ricans have the false belief that in Limón is spoken a mix of French and English. Only a few migrants made it.

Linguists are undecided if the English creole is a [[Varieties of English|kind of English]] or another language. According to some authors,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title = ¿Kryol, patwá, inglés, mekaytelyu? ¿Lengua o dialecto? ¿Qué se habla en Limón?|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zGKkLyQAQs|date = 2016-01-21|accessdate = 2016-02-03|last = Museo Nacional de Costa Rica - Canal Oficial}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Limonese Creole should be declared other language as it happens with the [[Haitian Creole|French creole of Haiti]]. However, in Haiti there is no [[Dialect continuum|dialectal continuum]], as the distinction between the French and the creole is clear; and in Limón there exists a continuum between the English and the Creole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = MI LENGUA MATERNA Y YO|url = http://revistas.ucr.ac.cr/index.php/filyling/article/view/6426|journal = Revista de Filología y Lingüística de la Universidad de Costa Rica|date = 2011-01-01|issn = 2215-2628|volume = 37|issue = 2|language = es|first = Franklyn Perry|last = Price}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is related to the linguistic phenomenon of [[decreolization]].

There is controversy about what should be taught in Limón schools, Creole English or [[Standard English]]. The first option would conserve [[cultural identity]] and history of those African descendants. However, the second option would allow people to have jobs needing [[bilingualism]] in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[English language|English]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4434">'''Linguistic demography''' is the [[Statistics|statistical study]] of [[language]]s among all populations. Estimating the number of speakers of a given language is not straightforward, and various estimates may diverge considerably. This is first of all due to the question of defining "[[language]]" vs. "[[dialect]]". Identification of varieties as a single language or as distinct languages is often based on ethnic, cultural, or political considerations rather than [[mutual intelligibility]]. The second difficulty is [[multilingualism]], complicating the definition of "native language". Finally, in many countries, insufficient [[census]] data add to the difficulties.

'''Demolinguistics''' is a branch of [[Sociology of language]] observing linguistic trends as affected by population distribution and redistribution and by the status of societies.

==Most spoken languages==

The following table compares the estimates of  Comrie (1998) and  Weber (1997)&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Comrie, Encarta Encyclopedia (1998); George Weber “Top Languages: The World’s 10 Most Influential Languages” in Language Today (Vol. 2, Dec 1997){{cite web|url=http://www2.ignatius.edu/faculty/turner/languages.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927062910/http://www2.ignatius.edu/faculty/turner/languages.htm |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (number of native speakers in millions). Also given are the estimates of [[SIL Ethnologue]] (2005). 
Comparing estimates that do not date to the same year is problematic due to the 1.14% per year growth of [[world population]] (with significant regional differences).

This table shows that for the world's largest languages, it is impossible to give an estimate of the number of native speakers with a certainty better than 10% or so. [[Macrolanguage]]s like Chinese and Arabic are particularly difficult to define, and estimates consequently show uncertainties of the order of 25%.

'''Minimum viable population''' ('''MVP''') is a [[lower bound]] on the population of a species, such that it can survive in the wild.  This term is used in the fields of [[biological sciences|biology]], [[ecology]], and [[conservation biology]]. More specifically, MVP is the smallest possible size at which a biological population can exist without facing extinction from natural disasters or demographic, environmental, or genetic [[stochastic]]ity.&lt;ref name="Holsinger2007"&gt;{{cite web|last=Holsinger |first=Kent |date=2007-09-04 |title=Types of Stochastic Threats |work=EEB310: Conservation Biology |publisher=University of Connecticut |url=http://darwin.eeb.uconn.edu/eeb310/lecture-notes/small-populations/node4.html |accessdate=2007-11-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120023317/http://darwin.eeb.uconn.edu/eeb310/lecture-notes/small-populations/node4.html |archivedate=2008-11-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "population" rarely refers to an entire species. For example, the undomesticated [[dromedary]] camel is extinct in its natural wild habitat; however, there is a domestic population in captivity and [[Australian feral camel|an additional feral population]] in [[Australia]]. Two groups of [[house cat]]s in separate houses which are not allowed outdoors are also technically distinct populations. Typically, however, MVP is used to refer solely to a wild population, such as the [[red wolf]].

==Estimation==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}
Minimum viable population is usually estimated as the population size necessary to ensure between 90 and 95 percent probability of survival between 100 and 1,000 years into the future. The MVP can be estimated using [[computer simulation]]s for [[population viability analysis|population viability analyses]] (PVA). PVA models populations using demographic and environmental information to project future [[population dynamics]]. The probability assigned to a PVA is arrived at after repeating the environmental simulation thousands of times.

For example, for a theoretical simulation of a population of 50 giant pandas in which the simulated population goes completely extinct, 30 out of 100 stochastic simulations projected 100 years into the future are not viable. Causes of extinction in the simulation may include [[inbreeding depression]], [[natural disaster]], or [[climate change]]. Extinction occurring in 30 out of 100 runs would give a survival probability of 70%. In contrast, in the same simulation with a starting population of 60 pandas, the panda population may only become extinct in four of the hundred runs, resulting in a survival probability of 96%. In this case the minimum viable population that satisfies the 90- to 95% probability for survival is between 50 and 60 pandas. (These figures have been invented for the purpose of this example.)

==Extinction==
[[Image:Laysan Duck Brood.jpg|thumb|right|In 1912, the [[Laysan duck]] had an [[effective population size]] of 7 at most.]]
MVP does not take external intervention into account. Thus, it is useful for conservation managers and environmentalists; a population may be increased above the MVP using a captive breeding program, or by bringing other members of the species in from other reserves.

There is naturally some debate on the accuracy of PVAs, since a wide variety of assumptions generally are required for future forecasting; however, the important consideration is not absolute accuracy, but promulgation of the concept that each species indeed has an MVP, which at least can be approximated for the sake of conservation biology and [[Biodiversity Action Plan]]s.&lt;ref name="Shaffer1981"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Shaffer ML |year=1981 |title=Minimum population sizes for species conservation |journal=[[BioScience]] |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=131–134 |doi=10.2307/1308256 |jstor=1308256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a [[Inbreeding depression#Example taxa not subject to significant inbreeding depression|marked trend]] for [[island|insularity]], surviving [[genetic bottleneck]]s and [[r-strategy]] to allow far lower MVPs than average. Conversely, taxa easily affected by inbreeding depression – having high MVPs – are often decidedly [[K-strategist]]s, with low [[population densities]] while occurring over a wide range. An MVP of 500 to 1,000 has often been given as an average for terrestrial vertebrates when inbreeding or genetic variability is ignored.&lt;ref name="Lehmkuhl1984"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01866938 |author=Lehmkuhl J |year=1984 |title=Determining size and dispersion of minimum viable populations for land management planning and species conservation |journal=Environmental Management |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=167–176}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thomas1990"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.1990.tb00295.x |author=Thomas CD |year=1990 |title=What do real population dynamics tell us about minimum viable population sizes? |journal=Conservation Biology |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=324–327}}&lt;/ref&gt; When inbreeding effects are included, estimates of MVP for many species are in the thousands. Based on a meta-analysis of reported values in the literature for many species, Traill ''et al.'' reported concerning vertebrates "a cross-species frequency distribution of MVP with a median of 4169 individuals (95% CI = 3577–5129)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2007.06.011|title=Minimum viable population size: A meta-analysis of 30 years of published estimates|journal=Biological Conservation|volume=139|pages=159–166|year=2007|last1=Traill|first1=Lochran W.|last2=Bradshaw|first2=Corey J.A.|last3=Brook|first3=Barry W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Out-of-battery''' refers to the status of a firearm before the action has returned to the normal firing position.

==Description==
The term originates from artillery, referring to a gun that fires before it has been pulled back.

In artillery guns, "out of battery" usually refers to a situation where the recoiling mass (breech and barrel) has not returned to its proper position after firing because of a failure in the recoil mechanism. Most gun carriage designs should prevent this; however, if a gun is fired out of battery, then damage to the carriage can occur, as the effectiveness of the recoil mechanism will have been compromised.

In [[firearm]]s and [[artillery]] where there is an automatic loading mechanism, a condition can occur in which a live round is at least partially in the firing chamber and capable of being fired, but is not properly secured by the usual mechanism of that particular weapon. The gas pressure produced at the moment of firing can rupture the not fully supported cartridge case and can result in flame and high-pressure gas being vented at the [[Breech-loading weapon|breech]] of the weapon, potentially creating flying [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|fragments]] and possibly injuring the operator.

Depending on the design, it is also possible for a semi-automatic handgun to simply not fire upon pulling the trigger when in an out-of-battery state.

The '''Punjabi dialects''' are the [[dialect chain|series of dialects]] spoken in the [[Punjab]] region of Pakistan and India.&lt;ref&gt;For the use of the term "Greater Panjabi", see {{harvtxt|Rensch|1992|p=87}} and {{harvtxt|Rahman|1996|p=175}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A distinction is usually made between [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] in the east and the diverse group of "[[Lahnda]]" in the west. The literary languages that have developed on the basis of dialects of this area are Punjabi in eastern and central Punjab, [[Saraiki language|Saraiki]] in the southwest, [[Hindko language|Hindko]] in the northwest, and [[Pothwari]] in the north. The varieties of "Greater Punjabi"  have a number of characteristics in common, for example the preservation of the [[Prakrit]] double consonants in stressed syllables.{{sfn|Shackle|2003|p=591}} Nevertheless, there is disagreement on whether they form part of a single [[language group]], with some proposed classifications placing them all within the Northwestern zone of [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]], while others reserving this only for the western varieties, and assigning the eastern ones to the Central zone alongside [[Hindi]].{{sfn|Masica|1991|pp=446–63}}

==Major dialects==

===Standard Punjabi (Majhi)===
[[Majhi dialect|Majhi]] is Punjabi [[dialect]] spoken by the majority of the people in [[Lahore]], [[Gujranwala District|Gujranwala]], [[Sheikhupura District|Sheikhupura]], [[Kasur District|Kasur]], [[Sialkot District|Sialkot]], [[Narowal District|Narowal]], [[Gujrat District|Gujrat]], [[Okara, Pakistan|Okara]], [[Pakpattan District|Pakpattan]], [[Sahiwal District|Sahiwal]], [[Hafizabad District|Hafizabad]], [[Nankana Sahib District|Nankana Sahib]] and [[Mandi Bahauddin District|Mandi Bahauddin]] districts of Pakistan's Punjab Province.  It also has a large presence in every district in the rest of Pakistani Punjab, and in all large cities in Pakistan's other provinces.

In India it is spoken in [[Amritsar]], [[Tarn Taran Sahib]], [[Pathankot]] and [[Gurdaspur]] Districts of the State of Punjab and sizable population also in major cities of the States of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Mumbai India.

In Pakistan Standard Punjabi dialect is not called Majhi which is Indian terminology, in Pakistan it is simply called Standard Punjabi. This dialect is used for both Punjabi Films, TV and Theater industry to make Punjabi language content in Lahore.

===&lt;span id="Eastern PunjabI Jurgdhda"&gt;Eastern Punjabi&lt;/span&gt;===
====Malwai====
[[Malwai dialect|Malwai]] is spoken in the southern part of Indian Punjab South of river [[Sutlej]] and also in [[Bahawalnagar]] and [[Vehari]] districts of Pakistan. This dialect is spoken in [[Ludhiana]], [[Moga district|Moga]], [[Ferozepur]], [[Fazilka]],
[[Muktsar]], [[Faridkot district|Faridkot]], [[Bathinda]], [[Barnala]], [[Sangrur]] and, [[Mansa district, Punjab|Mansa]] districts of [[Punjab, India]] and also in [[Ganganagar]] and [[Hanumangarh]] districts of [[Rajasthan]] and, the [[Sirsa]] and, [[Fatehabad district|Fatehabad]] districts of [[Haryana]].
Not to be confused with the Malvi language, which shares its name.

====Doabi====
[[Doabi]] is spoken in both the Indian Punjab as well as parts of Pakistan Punjab owing to post-1947 migration of Muslim populace from East Punjab. The word "Do Aabi" means "the land between two rivers" and this dialect is spoken between the rivers of [[Beas River|the Beas]] and [[Sutlej River|the Sutlej]] in the region called [[Doaba]]. Regions it is presently spoken includes the [[Jalandhar District|Jalandhar]], [[Kapurthala District|Kapurthala]], [[Hoshiarpur]] and [[Nawanshahr]] districts in Indian Punjab as well as the [[Toba Tek Singh District|Toba Tek Singh]] and [[Faisalabad District|Faisalabad]] districts in Pakistan Punjab where it is spoken by the erstwhile migrants from Eastern Punjab and their descendants. The dialect is known as Faisalabadi Punjabi in Pakistan.

This Dialect is also used as a standard for Indian Punjabi Films and TV shows.

====Pwadhi====
[[Pwadhi dialect|Pwadhi]], Powadh, Puadh or Powadha is a region of Punjab and parts of Haryana between the Satluj and Ghaggar rivers. The part lying south, south-east and east of Rupnagar adjacent to [[Ambala]] District (Haryana) is Powadhi. The Powadh extends from that part of the [[Rupnagar]] District which lies near Satluj to beyond the Ghaggar river in the east up to Kala Amb, which is at the border of the states of Himachal pradesh and Haryana. Parts of [[Fatehgarh Sahib]] district, and parts of [[Patiala]] districts like Rajpura are also part of Powadh. The language is spoken over a large area in present Punjab as well as Haryana. In Punjab, Kharar, Kurali, Ropar, Nurpurbedi, Morinda, Pail, Rajpura and Samrala are the areas where the Puadhi is spoken and the dialect area also includes Pinjore, Kalka, Ismailabad, Pehowa to Bangar area in [[Fatehabad district]].

===[[Lahnda|Western Punjabi]]===
The literary language of Lahnda speakers has traditionally been Standard Punjabi.&lt;ref name="Tolstaya 1981"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tolstaya|first=Natalya I.|year=1981|title=The Panjabi Language|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780710009395|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BmA9AAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date = November 2016|reason = contradicts almost every other text on the subject; also, a brief mention in a 1981 translation of a 1960s Russian book isn't enough of a source}}

====Shahpuri====
[[Shahpuri dialect|Shahpuri]] dialect (also known as Sargodha dialect) is mostly spoken in Pakistani Punjab. Its name is derived from former Shahpur District (now Shahpur Tehsil, being part of Sargodha District). It is spoken throughout a widespread area, spoken in [[Sargodha]] and Khushab Districts and also spoken in neighbouring [[Mianwali]] and [[Bhakkar]] Districts. It is mainly spoken on western end of Sindh River to Chennab river crossing Jehlam river.&lt;ref name="mother tongue"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sikhchic.com/history/mother_tongue_the_many_dialects_of_punjabi |title=The Art and Culture of the Diaspora &amp;#124; Mother Tongue: The Many Dialects of Punjabi |website=Sikhchic.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jhangochi/Changvi====
[[Jhangochi dialect|Jhangochi]] (جھنگوچی) dialect is spoken in Pakistani Punjab throughout a widespread area, starting from [[Khanewal]] and [[Jhang]] at both ends of Ravi and Chenab to Hafizabad district.

====Jangli/Rachnavi====
[[Jangli dialect|Jangli]] is a dialect of former nomad tribes of areas whose names are often suffixed with 'Bar' derived from jungle bar before irrigation system arrived in the start of the 20th century, for example, Sandal Bar, Kirana Bar, Neeli Bar, Ganji Bar. Former Layllpur and western half of Montgomary district used to speak this dialect.

====Pothohari/Pahari-Potowari or Modern Panjistani====
[[Pothohari dialect|Pothohari]] is spoken in north Pakistani Punjab and [[Azad Kashmir]]. The area where it is spoken extends in the north from [[Muzaffarabad]] to as far south as [[Jhelum District|Jhelum]](mainly in Dina and Sohawa tehsils), [[Gujar Khan]], [[Rawat, Murree|Rawat]] and [[Rawalpindi]], [[Murree Hills]] north of Rawalpindi, and east to [[Bhimber]]. Chibhali and Dhundi-Kairali dialects may be related. It merges with Majhi dialect at Saraialamgir/Kharian in the south and with Hindko dialects in the north at Attock.

====Hindko====
The diverse dialects of the furthest northwest areas of "Greater Punjabi" are known as [[Hindko]]. The central Hindko dialects comprise [[Ghebi]], [[Awankari]], [[Chacchi]] and [[Kohati]]. Peshawari, the divergent dialect spoken to the northwest in [[Peshawar]], has been used as a basis for a literary language. The dialect of the Hazara region to the northeast forms a dialect group of its own known as [[Northern Hindko]] or Kagani.

Ghebi is quite similar to the Potowari dialect, but differs slightly, for example in the past tense, in which it uses (ahay+prefix) for 'was'. For example, "Mea ahayaan" means "I was". It also uses "Vinjna" instead of "jaana" or "gchna" for "going". It is mostly spoken in [[Fateh Jang Tehsil]] and [[Pindi Gheb Tehsil]] in Pakistani Punjab.

====[[Dhani dialect|Dhani]]====
Spoken in parts of Rawalpindi Division (Pothohar) of Pakistani Punjab. Its name is derived from Dhan valley where its spoken. It is spoken in [[Chakwal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meetcornor.wordpress.com/category/history/history-of-chakwal/ |title=History of Chakwal &amp;#124; I Have A Dream In My Eyes |website=Meetcornor.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Khewra]], parts of Jehlam Districts and Attock Districts. The people of Pothohar speak Pothohari dialect. However, the people of Chakwal or the Dhanni area in particular do not speak Pothohari and are ethnologically not regarded as Potoharis. They speak a distinctive Chakwali or Dhanni dialect of Punjabi.&lt;ref name="mother tongue" /&gt;

====Jafri/[[Khetrani language|Khetrani]]====
These are a form of Derawali very strongly influenced by baluchi and sindhi languages, spoken in [[Musakhel District, Pakistan|Musakhel]] and [[Barkhan]], districts of Pakistani Province Balochistan respectively. Khetrani may not actually be a Lahnda language, but originally a Dardic language that gradually merged into neighboring lahnda dialects.

====Chenavari====
West of Chenaab river in Jhang district of Pakistani Punjab the dialect of Jhangochi merges with Thalochi and resultant dialect is Chenavari. Name is derived from Chenaab river.

====[[Saraiki dialect|Saraiki]]====
The emergent language of the southern parts of Punjab is [[Saraiki language|Saraiki]]. Its standard is based on the central dialect of [[Multani dialect|Multani]]. Other dialects that are commonly associated with it are [[Riasti dialect|Riasti]] (also known as Bahawalpuri or Choolistani) to the south and [[Thali dialect|Thali]] (or Thalochri) to the northwest. The varieties of Multani and Thali spoken in the west along the boundary with Balochistan and Pashtun dominated regions are also known as [[Derawali]].

=== Videsi (Barli Boli) ===
There are several dialects all cited in the dialect link. Note as the language is spreading with immigration throughout the world variations on the exported dialects of the immigrants mixed with local languages are now emerging where Punjabi has managed to sustain itself. For example, in the UK and North America English words and grammar have begun infiltrating Punjabi spoken there as has Swahili in Kenya. The effect of this is a myriad of Diaspora Creole variations that deviate from the source language somewhat like English, Spanish, Portuguese, and French have in Latin America, the Caribbean, and North America.

'''Rifian''', '''Rif Berber''' or '''Rifian Berber''' (native local name: '''''Tmaziɣt'''''; external name: ''Tarifit'') is a [[Zenati languages|Zenati]] [[Northern Berber languages|Northern]] [[Berber language]]. It is spoken natively by some 1.4 million [[Rifian people|Rifians]] of [[Morocco]] and [[Algeria]], primarily in the [[Rif]] provinces of [[Al Hoceima Province|Al Hoceima]], [[Nador Province|Nador]], [[Driouch Province|Driouch]], [[Berkane Province|Berkane]] and as a minority language in [[Tangier-Assilah Prefecture|Tangier]], [[Oujda-Angad Prefecture|Oujda]], [[Tetouan Province|Tetouan]] and [[Larache|Leɛrayec]]. In addition, Rifian expatriate communities also speak the language.

==Classification==
Rifian is a [[Zenati languages|Zenati Berber language]]&lt;ref name=e18&gt;{{Ethnologue18|rif}}&lt;/ref&gt; which consists of various sub-dialects specific to each clan and of which a majority are spoken in the [[Rif]] region, a large mountainous area of Northern [[Morocco]], and a minority spoken in the western part of neighbouring [[Algeria]].

==Geographic distribution==
[[File:Percent of Tarifit speakers in Morocco by census 2004.png|thumb|Percent of Rif-Berber speakers in Morocco by census 2004 Based on data found Here [http://www.hcp.ma/Recensement-general-de-la-population-et-de-l-habitat-2004_a633.html]]]
Rifian is spoken mainly in the [[Morocco|Moroccan]] [[Rif]] on the Mediterranean coast and in the Rif mountains, with a large minority in the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[autonomous city]] of [[Melilla]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lukor.com/not-esp/locales/0412/03150841.htm |title=CpM moción regular Tamazight Melilla tomando ejemplo Bable Asturias |website=Web.archive.org |date=2010-04-14 |accessdate=2017-03-07 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414121319/http://www.lukor.com/not-esp/locales/0412/03150841.htm |archivedate=2010-04-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also speakers of Rifian in Morocco outside the Rif region, notably in the rest of [[Morocco|Moroccan]] cities where they compose a minority. The neighbour state of [[Algeria]] is also home to Rif minorities. A Rifian-speaking community exists in the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]] as well as to a lesser extent other [[Europe]]an countries. Its own speakers simply call it "Tamazight", a term also often applied in a broader sense to the [[Berber language]] across North Africa in general.

==Dialects==
[[File:Riffian Dialects in Morocco.PNG|thumb|right|Distribution of Rifian dialects]]
Dialects include West-Rifian (Al Hoceima), Central-Rifian (Nador) and East-Rifian (Berkan). 

[[Iznasen Berber|Iznasen]] (Iznacen, Beni Snassen) is counted as a dialect in Kossman (1999), but Blench (2006) classifies it as one of the closely related [[Mzab–Wargla languages]].

==Morocco==
There is a large amount of dialectal variation in Rifian Berber; this can easily be seen using the dialect Atlas (Lafkioui, 1997), however Rifian compose a single language with its own phonetical innovations distinct from other [[Berber languages]]. Majority of them are spoken in Northern Morocco, this includes the varieties of [[Al Hoceima]], [[Temsamane]], [[Nador]], Ikbadene (including Iznasen) and the more southernly variety in the [[Taza]] province. Besides Rifian, two other unrelated and smaller Berber languages are spoken in North Morocco : the [[Senhaja language|Sanhaja de Srair]] and the [[Ghomara language|Ghomara]] languages.

==Algeria==
[[File:Berbères en Algérie occidentale.svg|thumb|Linguistic map of western Algeria showing Berber-speaking areas, including Rifian cluster of Bettioua, Marsa Ben-Mhidi, Aït Snous and Aït Bousaïd]]
A few Rifian dialects are or used to be in the western part of [[Algeria]], notably by the Beni Snouss tribe of the Tlemcen, as well in [[Bethioua]] but also in various colonial districts Rifians started to emigrate to since the 19th century.

==Sounds==

Rifian's most noticeable differences from other [[Berber language|Berber]] dialects are that:

*{{IPAslink|l}} in other dialects corresponds to {{angle bracket|ř}} in Rifian (example: ''ul'' (heart) → ''uř&amp;nbsp;'')
** {{IPA|/ll/}} (geminate {{IPAslink|l|lː}}) in other dialects corresponds to {{angle bracket|ǧǧ}} ({{IPA|/dː͡ʒ/}}) in Rifian (example: ''yelli'' (my daughter) → ''yeǧǧi&amp;nbsp;'').
** {{IPA|/lt/}} in other dialects corresponds to {{angle bracket|č}} ({{IPAslink|t͡ʃ}}) in Rifian (example: ''weltma'' (my sister) → ''wečma&amp;#x202f;'').

These variations do not occur in the Rifian dialects of Ikebdanen and Iznasen.

* postvocalic {{IPAslink|r}} preceding a consonantal coda is dropped, as in ''taddart'' (house/home) → ''taddaat''. Thus in ''tamara'' the {{IPAslink|r}} is conserved because it precedes a vowel.
* Additionally, the initial masculine ''a-'' prefix is dropped in certain words, e.g., ''afus'' (hand) becomes ''fus'', and ''afighar'' (snake) becomes ''fighar''. This change, characteristic of [[Zenati languages|Zenati]] Berber varieties, further distances Rifian from neighbouring dialects such as [[Central Morocco Tamazight|Atlas-Tamazight]] and [[Shilha language|Shilha]].
**"Tarifit" or "Tarifiyt" is by some tribes pronounced as [Tharifesht].

==Writing system==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2012}}
Like other Berber languages, Rifian has been written with several different systems over the years. Most recently (since 2003), [[Tifinagh]] has become official throughout Morocco. The [[Arabic script]] is not used anymore for writing Rifian Berber. The [[Berber Latin alphabet]] continues to be used unofficially online and in most publications in Morocco and abroad. However, unlike the nearby [[Tashelhit]] (Shilha), Rifian Berber has little written literature before the twentieth century.

[[File:stopwatch2.jpg|right|thumb|Before the introduction of shot timers, the [[referee]] had to manually stop a stopwatch when the shooter was finished.]]
[[File:Stangskyting2.jpg|thumb|Some shot timers can be linked to big board displays to provide instant feedback to the audience.]]
'''A shot timer''' is a [[gunshot|shot]] activated timer used in [[shooting sport]]s, which starts the competitor by an audible signal and also records the competitor's time electronically by detecting the sound of each shot together with the time from the start signal. When the competitor is finished the timer will show the time from the start signal until the last shot. The time is usually recorded to hundredths of a second ([[centisecond]]), which is required by competitions in the [[International Practical Shooting Confederation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipsc.org/pdf/RulesHandgun.pdf IPSC 2016 Handgun Rules, section 9.2.1.1]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some timers come with additional functions:
* Par times: The timer first gives a start, then a stop signal after a pre-programmed time.
* Instant or delayed start signal: The start signal can either come instantly by the push of the start button, or by a delay between 1 to 4 seconds.
* Big board display: The possibility for direct connection to a big board display for instant audience feedback.
* The possibility for scoring points on target in addition to the time, with automatic hit factor calculation, making for a complete scoring solution. The results can be loaded to a computer, i.e. by Bluetooth or RF.
* Splits between shots fired
* Memory storage of previous runs
* Auxiliary jack for external loud horn, visual starts or target turning
* Adjustable shot detector sensitivity

Shot timers can also be downloaded as apps for smartphones, although less reliable than dedicated standalone units.

'''Spanish grammar''' is the [[grammar]] of the [[Spanish language]] (''español''), which is a [[Romance language]] that originated in north central Spain and is spoken today throughout Spain, some twenty countries in the Americas, and [[Equatorial Guinea]] in [[Africa]].

Spanish is an [[Inflection|inflected]] language.  The [[verbs]] are potentially marked for [[Grammatical tense|tense]], [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]], [[Grammatical mood|mood]], [[Grammatical person|person]], and [[Grammatical number|number]] (resulting in some fifty [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] forms per verb).  The [[nouns]] form a two-[[Grammatical gender|gender]] system and are marked for [[Grammatical number|number]]. Pronouns can be inflected for [[Grammatical person|person]], [[Grammatical number|number]], [[Grammatical gender|gender]] (including a residual neuter), and a very reduced [[Grammatical case|case]]; the Spanish pronominal system represents a simplification of the ancestral Latin system.

[[Image:Grammatica Nebrissensis.JPG|thumb|130px|right|Frontispiece of the Grammatica Nebrissensis]]
Spanish was the first of the European vernaculars to have a grammar treatise, ''[[Gramática de la lengua castellana]]'', written in 1492 by the [[Andalusia]]n philologist [[Antonio de Nebrija]] and presented to Queen [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella of Castile]] at [[Salamanca]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry Kamen, ''Empire: how Spain became a world power, 1492–1763'', 2002:3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Real Academia Española]] (RAE, Royal Spanish Academy) traditionally dictates the [[linguistic prescription|normative]] rules of the [[Spanish language]], as well as its [[Spanish orthography|orthography]].

Formal differences between [[Peninsular Spanish|Peninsular]] and [[Spanish language in the Americas|American Spanish]] are remarkably few, and someone who has learned the dialect of one area will generally have no difficulties using formal speech in the other; however, pronunciation does vary, as well as grammar and vocabulary.

Recently published comprehensive Spanish reference grammars in English include {{Harvcoltxt|DeBruyne|1996}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Butt|Benjamin|2011}}, and {{Harvcoltxt|Batchelor|San José|2010}}.

== Verbs ==
{{Main article|Spanish verbs|Spanish conjugation|Spanish irregular verbs}}

Every Spanish verb belongs to one of three form classes, characterized by the [[infinitive]] ending:  ''-ar'', ''-er'', or ''-ir''—sometimes called the first, second, and third conjugations, respectively.

A Spanish verb has nine [[Indicative mood|indicative]] tenses with more-or-less direct English equivalents:  the [[present tense]] ('I walk'), the [[preterite]] ('I walked'), the [[imperfect]] ('I was walking' or 'I used to walk'), the [[present perfect]] ('I have walked'), the [[Perfect (grammar)|past perfect]] — also called the [[pluperfect]] ('I had walked'), the [[Future tense|future]] ('I will walk'), the future perfect ('I will have walked'), the [[Conditional mood|conditional simple]] ('I would walk') and the conditional perfect ('I would have walked').

In most dialects, each tense has six potential forms, varying for first, second, or third [[Grammatical person|person]] and for singular or plural [[Grammatical number|number]]. In the second person, Spanish maintains the so-called "[[T–V distinction]]" between familiar and formal modes of address. The formal second-person pronouns (''usted'', ''ustedes'') take third-person verb forms.

The second-person familiar plural is expressed in most of Spain with the pronoun ''vosotros'' and its characteristic verb forms (e.g. ''coméis'' 'you [pl.] eat'), while in Latin American Spanish it merges with the formal second-person plural (e.g. ''ustedes comen''). Thus ''ustedes'' is used as both the formal and familiar second-person pronoun in Latin America.

In many areas of Latin America (especially Central America and southern South America), the second-person familiar singular pronoun ''tú'' is replaced by ''vos'', which frequently requires its own characteristic verb forms, especially in the present indicative, where the endings are ''-ás'', ''-és'', and ''-ís'' for ''-ar'', ''-er'', ''-ir'' verbs, respectively. See "[[voseo]]".

In the tables of paradigms below, the (optional) subject pronouns appear in parentheses.

=== Present indicative ===
The present indicative is used to express actions or states of being in a present time frame. For example:
* Yo ''soy'' alto (I ''am'' tall).
* Ella ''canta'' en el club (She ''sings'' in the club).
* Todos nosotros ''vivimos'' en un submarino amarillo (We all ''live'' in a yellow submarine).
* ''Son'' las diez y media ([It] ''is'' ten thirty).

=== Past tenses ===
Spanish has a number of verb tenses used to express actions or states of being in a past time frame. The two that are "simple" in form (formed with a single word, rather than being [[compound verb]]s) are the [[preterite]] and the [[imperfect]].

==== Preterite ====
The preterite is used to express actions or events that took place in the past, and which were instantaneous or are viewed as completed. For example:
* Ella murió ayer (She died yesterday)
* Pablo apagó las luces (Pablo turned the lights off)
* Yo me comí el arroz (I ate the rice)
* Te cortaste el pelo (You had your hair cut)

Note that (1) for ''-ar'' and ''-ir'' verbs (but not ''-er''), the first-person plural form is the same as that of the present indicative; and (2) ''-er'' and ''-ir'' verbs share the same set of endings.

==== Imperfect or "copretérito" ====
The imperfect expresses actions or states that are viewed as ongoing in the past. For example:
* Yo era cómico en el pasado (I was comical in the past)
* Usted comía mucho (You ate a lot – literally, this sentence is saying "You used to eat a lot", saying that in the past, the person being referred had a characteristic of "eating a lot")
* Ellos escuchaban la radio (They were listening to the radio)
All three of the sentences above describe "non-instantaneous" actions that are viewed as continuing in the past. The characteristic in the first sentence and the action in the second were continuous, not instantaneous occurrences. In the third sentence, the speaker focuses on the action in progress, not on its beginning or end.

Note that (1) for all verbs in the imperfect, the first- and third-person singular share the same form; and (2) ''-er'' and ''-ir'' verbs share the same set of endings.

==== Using preterite and imperfect together ====
The preterite and the imperfect can be combined in the same sentence to express the occurrence of an event in one clause during an action or state expressed in another clause. For example:
* ''Ellos escuchaban la radio cuando oyeron un ruido afuera.'' (They were listening to the radio when they heard a noise outside.)
* ''Yo estaba en mi cuarto cuando usted entró.'' (I was in my room when you came in.)
* ''Era un día muy tranquilo cuando eso pasó.'' (It was a very peaceful day when that happened.)
In all three cases, an event or completed action interrupts an ongoing state or action. For example, in the second sentence, the speaker states that he was in his room (expressed through the imperfect to reflect the ongoing or unfinished state of being there) when the other person "interrupted" that state by entering (expressed through the preterite to suggest a completed action).

=== Present progressive and imperfect progressive ===
The present and imperfect progressive both are used to express ongoing, progressive action in the present and past, respectively. For example:
* ''Estoy haciendo mi tarea''. (I am doing my homework)
* ''Estamos estudiando''. (We are studying)
* ''Estaba escuchando la radio''. (I was listening to the radio)
* ''Él estaba limpiando su cuarto''. (He was cleaning his room)
The present progressive is formed by first conjugating the verb ''estar'' or ''seguir'', depending on context, to the subject, and then attaching a gerund of the verb that follows. The past (imperfect) progressive simply requires the estar or seguir to be conjugated, depending on context, in imperfect, with respect to the subject.

==== Forming gerunds ====
To form the gerund of an ''-ar'' verb, replace the ''-ar'' of the infinitive with ''-ando'';
e.g. ''jugar'', ''hablar'', ''caminar'' → ''jugando'', ''hablando'', ''caminando''.
For ''-er'' or ''-ir verbs'', replace the ''-er'' or ''-ir'' ending with ''-iendo'';
e.g. ''comer'', ''escribir'', ''dormir'' → ''comiendo'', ''escribiendo'', ''durmiendo'' (note that ''dormir'' undergoes the stem vowel change that is typical of ''-ir'' verbs).&lt;!--It is arguably not irregular for an ''-ir'' verb to raise its stem vowel.--&gt;
In ''-er'' verbs whose stem ends with a vowel, the ''i'' of the ''-iendo'' ending is replaced by ''y'': e.g. ''leer'', ''traer'', ''creer'' → ''leyendo'', ''trayendo'', ''creyendo''.
In ''-ir'' verbs whose stem ends with ''e''—such as ''reír'' and ''sonreír''—the stem vowel ''e'' is raised to ''i'' (as is typical of ''-ir'' verbs), and this ''i'' merges with the ''i'' of the ''-iendo'' ending; e.g. ''reír'', ''freír'' → ''riendo'', ''friendo''.

=== Subjunctive ===
The subjunctive of a verb is used to express certain connotations in sentences such as a wish or desire, a demand, an emotion, uncertainty, or doubt.

==== Present subjunctive ====
Normally, a verb would be conjugated in the present indicative to indicate an event in the present frame of time.
* Yo '''soy''' muy ambicioso (I '''am''' very ambitious)
* Marta '''trae''' la comida (Marta '''brings''' the food)
If the sentence expresses a desire, demand, or emotion, or something similar, in the present tense, the subjunctive is used.
* Quiero que '''seas''' muy ambicioso (I want you to '''be''' very ambitious—literally, I want ''that you be'' very ambitious)
* Me alegro de que Marta '''traiga''' la comida (I am happy that Marta '''brings''' the food)
* Es una lástima que '''llegues''' tarde (It is a shame that you '''arrive''' late)

The subjunctive is also used to convey doubt, denial, or uncertainty.
* Busco un amigo que ''sea'' simpático (I search for a friend who will ''be'' likable or I search for a likable friend)
* No hay ningún autor que lo ''escriba''. (There are no authors who ''write'' that.)
* Es posible que ella ''sepa'' mucho (It is possible that she ''knows'' a lot.)
* No parece que ''tengan'' mucho dinero (It does not seem that they ''have'' much money.)
In the first two examples, the ideally likable friend has not yet been found and remains an uncertainty, and authors "who write that" are not known to exist. In the third, possibility is not certainty, but rather a conjecture, and the last expresses clear doubt. Thus, subjunctive is used.
Some of the phrases and verbs that require sentences to have subjunctive formation include:
*Dudar, negar, esperar, alegrarse de, temer, sentir, pedir, aconsejar, exigir, desear, querer, mandar
*Es necesario que, conviene que, no parece que, es dudoso que, es probable que, no creo que, importa que, parece mentira que
Some phrases that require the indicative instead, because they express certainty, include:
*Es verdad que, es obvio que, es seguro que, parece que, es evidente que, creo que

To form the first-person singular subjunctive, first take the present indicative first-person singular ('yo') form of a verb. For example, the verbs hablar, comer, and vivir (To talk, to eat, to live) → Yo hablo, yo como, yo vivo. Then, replace the ending 'o' with the "opposite ending". This is done in the following way: if the verb is an -er or -ir verb such as comer, poder, vivir, or compartir, replace the ending 'o' with an 'a' i.e. : Yo como; yo puedo; yo vivo → Yo coma; yo pueda; yo viva. If the verb is an -ar verb such as hablar or caminar replace the ending 'o' with an 'e' i.e. : Yo hablo; yo camino → Yo hable, yo camine. This forms the first-person conjugation. The other conjugations work similarly, as follows:
*'''Yo''' → Yo hable; yo coma; yo viva
*'''Tú''' → Tú hables; tú comas; tú vivas
*'''Él/Ella/Usted''' → Él hable; él coma; él viva
*'''Nosotros''' → Nosotros hablemos; nosotros comamos; nosotros vivamos
*'''Vosotros''' → Vosotros habléis; vosotros comáis; vosotros viváis
*'''Ellos/Ellas/Ustedes''' → ellos hablen; ellos coman; ellos vivan

Since the ''vos'' forms are derived from ''vosotros'' the following would be expected (and [[Central American Spanish|used in Central America]])
*'''Vos''' → Vos hablés; vos comás; vos escribás
However, the [[Royal Spanish Academy]], following [[Rioplatense Spanish|Argentinian usage]], recommends using the ''tú'' forms:
*'''Vos''' → Vos hables;&lt;ref&gt;[[Diccionario de la lengua española de la Real Academia Española]], [http://lema.rae.es/drae/srv/search?id=i2L07VthUVcRjHg4jsgm hablar]&lt;/ref&gt; vos comas;&lt;ref&gt;[[Diccionario de la lengua española de la Real Academia Española]], [http://lema.rae.es/drae/srv/search?id=VXZt8v5sFVcRjCuqbdPw comer]&lt;/ref&gt; vos escribas&lt;ref&gt;[[Diccionario de la lengua española de la Real Academia Española]], [http://lema.rae.es/drae/srv/search?id=9A7UfXpimVcRjjCsty4m escribir]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Imperfect subjunctive ====
Today, the two forms of the imperfect subjunctive are largely interchangeable.*  The "-se" form derives (as in most Romance languages) from the Latin pluperfect subjunctive, while the "-ra" form derives from the Latin pluperfect indicative. The use of one or the other is largely a matter of personal taste and dialect.  Many only use the ''-ra'' forms in speech, but vary between the two in writing.  Many may spontaneously use either, or even prefer the rarer ''-se'' forms. The imperfect subjunctive is formed for basically the same reasons as the present subjunctive, but is used for other tenses and time frames.

== Nouns ==
{{Main article|Spanish nouns|Grammatical gender in Spanish}}
In Spanish, as in other Romance languages, all nouns belong to one of two genders, "masculine" or "feminine", and many adjectives change their form to agree in gender with the noun they modify. For most nouns that refer to persons, grammatical gender matches biological gender.

== Adjectives ==
{{Main article|Spanish adjectives}}

Spanish generally uses adjectives in a similar way to English and most other Indo-European languages.  However, there are three key differences between English and Spanish adjectives.

* In Spanish, adjectives usually go ''after'' the noun they modify.  The exception is when the writer/speaker is being slightly emphatic, or even poetic, about a particular quality of an object (rather than the mundane use of using the quality to specify which particular object they are referring to).
** ''Mi casa roja'' could either mean that there are many red houses in the world but I wish to talk about the one that I happen to own, or that I have many houses but am referring to the red one. ''Mi casa roja'' = My house, the red one.
** ''Mi roja casa'' means that I am stressing how red my particular house is (probably the only house I have). ''Mi roja casa'' = My house, which is obviously red.
* In Spanish, adjectives [[agreement (linguistics)|agree]] with what they refer to in terms of both number (singular/plural) and gender (masculine/feminine). For example, ''taza'' (cup) is feminine, so "the red cup" is ''la taza roj&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;'', but ''vaso'' (glass) is masculine, so "the red glass" is ''el vaso roj&lt;u&gt;o&lt;/u&gt;''.
* In Spanish, it is perfectly normal to let an adjective stand in for a noun or pronoun—with (where people are involved) no implication of condescension or rudeness. For example, ''los altos'' means "the tall ones" or "the tall men". ''El grande'' means "the big one" or "the big man".

== Determiners ==
{{Main article|Spanish determiners}}

Spanish uses [[Determiner (class)|determiners]] in a similar way to English. The main difference is that they inflect for both number (singular/plural) and gender (masculine/feminine).  Common determiners include ''el'' ("the"), ''un'' ("a"), ''este'' ("this"), ''mucho'' ("much, a lot"), ''alguno'' ("some"), and so on.

== Pronouns ==
{{Main article|Spanish pronouns}}
Spanish pronouns fall into the same broad categories as English pronouns do: [[Personal pronoun|personal]], [[Demonstrative pronoun|demonstrative]], [[Interrogative pronoun|interrogative]], [[Relative pronoun|relative]], and [[Possessive pronoun|possessive]]. The personal pronouns–those that vary in form according to whether they represent the first, second, or third [[grammatical person]]–include a variety of second-person forms that differ not only according to [[Grammatical number|number]] (singular or plural), but also according to [[T–V distinction|formality]] or the social relation between speakers. Additionally, these second-person forms vary according to geographical region. Because the form of a conjugated verb reflects the person and number of its subject, subject pronouns are usually omitted, except where they are felt to be needed for emphasis or disambiguation.

==Adverbs==
Spanish adverbs work much like their English counterparts, e.g. ''muy'' ("very"), ''poco'' ("a little"), ''lejos'' ("far"), ''mucho'' ("much, a lot"), ''casi'' ("almost"), etc.  To form adverbs from adjectives, the adverbial suffix ''-mente'' is generally added to the feminine singular of the adjective, whether or not it differs from the masculine singular. Thus:

* ''claro'' ("clear", m. sg.) → ''clara'' (f. sg.) → ''claramente'' ("clearly")
* ''rápido'' ("fast, rapid", m. sg.) → ''rápida'' (f. sg.) → ''rápidamente'' ("fast, quickly, rapidly")
* ''natural'' ("natural", m. &amp; f. sg.) → ''naturalmente'' ("naturally")
* ''triste'' ("sad", m. &amp; f. sg.) → ''tristemente'' ("sadly")
* ''audaz'' ("bold", m. &amp; f. sg.) → ''audazmente'' ("boldly")

The adjectives ''bueno'' ("good") and ''malo'' ("bad") have irregular adverbial forms: ''bien'' ("well") and ''mal'' ("badly"), respectively.

As in English, some adverbs are identical to their adjectival counterparts.  Thus words such as ''temprano'' ("early"), ''lento'' ("slow"), and ''hondo'' ("deep") can also mean "early" (as in English, as in "He arrived early") "slowly", and "deeply", respectively.

In series of consecutive adverbs that would each end in ''-mente'' on their own, the ''-mente'' is dropped from all but the final adverb, and the others are left as if they were adjectives in the feminine singular. Thus:

* ''rápida y fácilmente'' = "quickly and easily"
* ''lenta, cuidosa, y duchamente'' = "slowly, carefully, and skillfully"
* ''parcial o completamente'' = "partially or completely"

There are also a wide variety of adverbial phrases in Spanish, such as ''a menudo'' ("often"), ''en todas partes'' ("everywhere"), ''de repente'' ("suddenly"), ''por fin'' ("finally"), and ''sin embargo'' ("however, nevertheless").

As with adjectives, the [[comparative]] of adverbs is almost always formed by placing ''más'' ("more") or ''menos'' ("less") before the adverb.  Thus ''más temprano'' ("earlier"), ''más rápidamente'' ("faster, quicker, more quickly"), ''menos interesantemente'' ("less interestingly"), etc. The [[superlative]] is formed by placing the neuter article ''lo'' before the comparative, although it is generally used with an additional qualifier phrase such as ''que puedas'' ("that you can") or ''de todos'' ("of all"): ''lo más rápidamente que puedas'' ("as quickly as you can", lit. "the most quickly that you can"), ''lo más interesantemente de todos'' ("most interestingly of all"), ''lo menos claramente de ellos'' ("the least clearly of them"), etc. As with their corresponding adjectival forms,  ''bien'' ("well") and ''mal'' ("badly") have irregular comparative forms (''mejor'' ("better") and ''peor'' ("worse"), respectively), and ''más'' and ''menos'' are the comparatives of ''mucho'' ("much, a lot") and ''poco'' ("a little"), respectively.

== Prepositions ==
{{Main article|Spanish prepositions}}

Spanish has a relatively large number of [[preposition]]s, and does not use [[postposition]]s.  The following list is traditionally cited:

{{quote|''A, ante, bajo, cabe, con, contra, de, desde, en, entre, hacia, hasta, para, por, según, sin, so, sobre, tras.''}}

Recently, two new prepositions have been added: "durante" and "mediante", usually placed at the end to preserve the list (which is usually learnt by heart by Spanish students).

This list includes two archaic prepositions (''so'' and ''cabe''), but leaves out two new Latinisms (''vía'' and ''pro'') as well as a large number of very important compound prepositions.

Prepositions in Spanish do not change a verb's meaning as they do in English.  For example, to translate "run out of water", "run up a bill", "run down a pedestrian", and "run in a thief" into Spanish requires completely different verbs, and not simply the use of "correr" ("run") plus the corresponding Spanish preposition. This is more due to the nature of English [[phrasal verbs]] rather than an inherent function of Spanish verbs or prepositions.
&lt;!--You can edit this summary, but don't duplicate the role of the main article--&gt;

== Conjunctions ==
The Spanish conjunctions ''y'' ('and') and ''o'' ('or') alter their form in both spoken and written language to ''e'' and ''u'' respectively when followed by an identical vowel sound.  Thus, ''padre '''e''' hijo'' ('father and son'), ''Fernando '''e''' Isabel'' ('Ferdinand and Isabella'), ''sujeto '''u''' objeto'' ('subject or object'), ''vertical '''u''' horizontal'' ('vertical or horizontal').

The change does not take place before the ''(h)i'' of a diphthong, as in ''acero '''y''' hierro'' ('steel and iron').  Nor does the conjunction ''y'' change when initial in a question (where it serves to introduce or reintroduce a name as a [[topic–comment|topic]], rather than to link one element with another), as in ''¿'''Y''' Inés?'' ('What about Inés?').

When the conjunction ''o'' appears between numerals, it is usually spelled with an accent mark (''ó''), in order to distinguish it from zero (0); thus, ''2 '''ó''' 3'' ('2 or 3') in contrast to ''203'' ('two-hundred three').

== Syntax and syntactic variation ==

=== Order of constituents ===
Spanish unmarked word order for affirmative declarative sentences is [[subject-verb-object]] (SVO); however, as in other Romance languages, in practice, word order is more variable, with [[topicalization]] and [[Focus (linguistics)|focus]] being the primary factors in the selection of a particular order. [[Verb-subject-object]] (VSO), [[verb-object-subject]] (VOS), and [[object-verb-subject]] (OVS) are also relatively common, while other orders are very uncommon outside of poetry.

Thus, to simply say, "My friend wrote the book", one would say (SVO):
*''Mi amigo escribió el libro''

Although bare VSO and VOS are somewhat rare in declarative independent clauses, they are quite common in sentences in which something other than the subject or direct object functions as the focus. For example:
*''Hace pocos años escribió mi amigo un libro'' or ''Hace pocos años escribió un libro mi amigo'' = "A few years ago, my friend wrote a book"
*''Ayer vio mi madre a mi amigo y le preguntó por su libro'' or ''Ayer vio a mi amigo mi madre y le preguntó por su libro'' = "Yesterday, my mother saw my friend and asked him about his book"

In many [[dependent clauses]], the verb is placed before the subject (and thus often VSO or VOS) to avoid placing the verb in final position:
*''Este es el libro que '''escribió''' mi amigo'', but rarely ''Este es el libro que mi amigo escribió'' = "This is the book that my friend wrote"

A sentence in which the direct object is the [[Topic and comment|topic]] or "theme" (old information), while the subject is part of the comment, or "rheme" (new information), often assumes OVS order. In this case the direct object noun phrase is supplemented with the appropriate direct object pronoun; for example:
*''El libro lo escribió mi amigo''

Because subject pronouns are [[Pro-drop language|often dropped]], one will often see sentences with a verb and direct object but no explicitly stated subject.

In questions, VSO is usual (though not obligatory):
*''¿Escribió mi amigo el libro?'' = "Did my friend write the book?"

Yes/no questions, regardless of constituent order, are generally distinguished from declarative  sentences by context and intonation.

=== Cleft sentences ===
A [[clefting|cleft sentence]] is one formed with the copular verb (generally with a [[dummy pronoun]] like "it" as its subject), plus a word that "cleaves" the sentence, plus a subordinate clause.  They are often used to put emphasis on a part of the sentence.  Here are some examples of English sentences and their cleft versions:
*"I did it." → "It was I who did it" or colloquially "It was me that did it."
*"You will stop smoking through willpower." → "It is through willpower that you will stop smoking."

Spanish does not usually employ such a structure in simple sentences.  The translations of sentences like these can be readily analyzed as being normal sentences containing relative pronouns.  Spanish is capable of expressing such concepts without a special cleft structure thanks to its flexible word order.

For example, if we translate a cleft sentence such as "It was Juan who lost the keys", we get ''Fue Juan el que perdió las llaves.''  Whereas the English sentence uses a special structure, the Spanish one does not.  The verb ''fue'' has no dummy subject, and the pronoun ''el que'' is not a cleaver but a nominalising relative pronoun meaning "the [male] one that".  Provided we respect the parings of "el que" and "las llaves", we can play with the word order of the Spanish sentence without affecting its structure – although each permutation would, to a native speaker, give a subtly different shading of emphasis.

For example, we can say ''Juan fue el que perdió las llaves'' ("Juan was the one who lost the keys") or ''El que perdió las llaves fue Juan'' ("The one who lost the keys was Juan").  As can be seen from the translations, if this word order is chosen, English stops using the cleft structure (there is no more dummy "it" and a nominalising relative is used instead of the cleaving word) whilst in Spanish no words have changed.

Here are some examples of such sentences:
*''Fue Juan &lt;u&gt;el que&lt;/u&gt; perdió las llaves'' = "It was John who lost the keys"
*''Son sólo tres días &lt;u&gt;los que&lt;/u&gt; te quedan'' = "It is only three days that you have left"
*''Seré yo &lt;u&gt;quien&lt;/u&gt; se lo diga'' = "It will be I who tells him"
*''Son pocos &lt;u&gt;los que&lt;/u&gt; vienen y se quedan'' = lit. "There are few who come and stay"

Note that it is ungrammatical to try to use just ''que'' to cleave such sentences as in English, but using ''quien'' in singular or ''quienes'' in plural is grammatical.
*''*Fue Juan &lt;u&gt;que&lt;/u&gt; perdió las llaves'' (incorrect)
*''Fue Juan &lt;u&gt;quien&lt;/u&gt; perdió las llaves'' (correct)

When prepositions come into play, things become complicated.  Structures unambiguously identifiable as cleft sentences are used.  The verb ''ser'' introduces the stressed element and then there is a nominaliser.  Both of these are preceded by the relevant preposition.  For example:
*''Fue &lt;u&gt;a mí a quien&lt;/u&gt; le dio permiso'' = "It was me to whom he gave permission", lit. "It was to me to whom he gave permission"
*''Es &lt;u&gt;para nosotros para quienes&lt;/u&gt; se hizo esto'' = "It is us for whom this was made", lit. "It is for us for whom this was made"
*''Es &lt;u&gt;por eso por lo que&lt;/u&gt; lo hice'' = "That is why I did it", more literally: "It is because of that that I did it", or completely literally: "It is because of that because of which I did it"
*''Es así &lt;u&gt;como&lt;/u&gt; se debe hacer'' = "It is this way that it must be done", lit. "It is this way how it must be done" (''como'' replaces longer expressions such as ''la forma en que'')

This structure is quite wordy, and is therefore often avoided by not using a cleft sentence at all.  Emphasis is conveyed just by word order and stressing with the voice (indicated here within bolding):
*''Me dio permiso &lt;u&gt;a '''mí'''&lt;/u&gt;'' = "He gave permission to '''me'''"
*''Se hizo esto &lt;u&gt;para '''nosotros'''&lt;/u&gt;'' = "This was done for '''us'''"
*''&lt;u&gt;Por '''eso'''&lt;/u&gt; lo hice'' = "I did it because of '''that'''"
*''Se debe hacer &lt;u&gt;'''así'''&lt;/u&gt;'' = "It must be done '''this''' way"

In casual speech, the complex cleaving pronoun is often reduced to ''que'', just as it is reduced to "that" in English.  Foreign learners are advised to avoid this.
*''Es para nosotros &lt;u&gt;que&lt;/u&gt; se hizo esto''
*''Es por eso &lt;u&gt;que&lt;/u&gt; lo hice''
*''Fue a mí &lt;u&gt;que&lt;/u&gt; le dio permiso'' (preferred: '''''a quien''''')
*''Es así &lt;u&gt;que&lt;/u&gt; se debe hacer'' (preferred: '''''como''''')

In the singular, the subordinate clause can agree either with the relative pronoun or with the subject of the main sentence, though the latter is seldom used.  However, in the plural, only agreement with the subject of the main sentence is acceptable.  Therefore:
;Singular
*''Yo fui el que &lt;u&gt;me lo bebí&lt;/u&gt;'' = "I was the one who drank it" (agreement with subject of main sentence)
*''Yo fui el que &lt;u&gt;se lo bebió&lt;/u&gt;'' (preferred form with same meaning, agreement with ''el que'')
*''La que lo &lt;u&gt;sé&lt;/u&gt; soy yo'' = "I am the one who knows" (agreement with subject of main sentence)
*''La que lo &lt;u&gt;sabe&lt;/u&gt; soy yo'' = (preferred form with same meaning, agreement with ''la que'')

;Plural
*''Somos los únicos que no &lt;u&gt;tenemos&lt;/u&gt; ni un centavo para apostar'' = "We are the only ones who do not have even a cent to bet" (agreement with subject of main sentence) (from dialogue of the [[Gabriel García Márquez]] novel ''[[No One Writes to the Colonel|El coronel no tiene quien le escriba]]'')
*''Vosotras sois las que lo &lt;u&gt;sabéis&lt;/u&gt;'' = "You girls are the ones who know" (agreement with subject of main sentence)

== Dialectal variations ==

=== Forms of address ===
The use of ''usted'' and ''ustedes'' as a polite form of address is universal.  However, there are variations in informal address.  ''Ustedes'' replaces ''vosotros'' in much of Andalusia, the Canary Islands and Latin America, except in the liturgical or poetic of styles.  In some parts of Andalusia, the pronoun ''ustedes'' is used with the standard ''vosotros'' endings.

Depending on the region, Latin Americans may also replace the singular ''tú'' with ''usted'' or ''vos''.  The choice of pronoun is a tricky issue and can even vary from village to village.  Travellers are often advised to play it safe and call everyone ''usted''.

A feature of the speech of the [[Dominican Republic]] and other areas where syllable-final /s/ is completely silent is that there is no audible difference between the second and third person singular form of the verb.  This leads to redundant pronoun use, for example, the tagging on of ''¿tú ves?'' (pronounced ''tuvé'') to the ends of sentences, where other speakers would say ''¿ves?''.

==== ''Voseo'' ====
{{Main article|Voseo}}
''Vos'' was used in medieval Castilian as a polite form, like the French ''vous'' and the Italian ''voi'', and it used the same forms as ''vosotros''.  This gave three levels of formality:
*''Tú quieres''
*''Vos queréis'' (originally ''queredes'')
*''Vuestra merced quiere'' (today ''usted'')

Whereas ''vos'' was lost in standard Spanish, some dialects lost ''tú'', and began using ''vos'' as the informal pronoun.  The exact connotations of this practice, called ''[[voseo]]'', depend on the dialect.  In certain countries there may be socioeconomic implications. El ''voseo'' uses the pronoun ''vos'' for ''tú'', but maintains ''te'' as an object pronoun and ''tu'' and ''tuyo'' as possessives.

In ''[[voseo]]'', verbs corresponding to ''vos'' in the present indicative (roughly equivalent to the English simple present), are formed from the second person plural (the form for ''vosotros''). If the second person plural ends in '''áis''' or '''éis''', the form for ''vos'' drops the '''i''':

* Vosotros habláis – vos hablás
* Vosotros tenéis – vos tenés

Similarly the verb '''ser''' (to be) has:

* Vosotros sois – vos sos

If the second person plural ends in '''-ís''' (with an accent on the '''í'''), then the form for ''vos'' is identical:

* Vosotros vivís – vos vivís
* Vosotros oís – vos oís
* Vosotros huís – vos huís

In the imperative, the form for ''vos'' is also derived from the second person plural. The latter ends always in '''-d'''. So for the form for ''vos'' this '''d''' is removed, and if the verb has more than one syllable, an accent is added to the last vowel:

* Tened (vosotros) – tené (vos)
* Dad (vosotros) – da (vos)

The only exception to these rules is in the verb '''ir''' (to go), which does not have an imperative form for '''vos''' and uses the analogous form of the verb '''andar''', which has a similar meaning, and is regular:

* Andad – andá

In the present subjunctive, the same rules as for the present indicative apply, though these forms coexist in Argentina with those for the pronoun '''tú''':

* Que vosotros digáis – que vos digás
Or:
* Que tú digas – que vos digas

Other tenses always have the same form for '''vos''' as for '''tú'''.

Outside Argentina, other combinations are possible. For instance, people in [[Maracaibo]] may use standard ''vosotros'' endings for ''vos'' ''(vos habláis, que vos habléis)''.

==== ''Vosotros'' imperative: ''-ar'' for ''-ad'' ====
In Spain, colloquially, the infinitive is used instead of the normative imperative for ''vosotros''. This is not accepted in the [[linguistic prescription|normative]] language.
* ''¡Venir!'' instead of ''¡Venid!''
* ''¡Callaros!'' instead of ''¡Callaos!'' (''¡Callarse!'' in some dialects)
* ''¡Iros!'' or ''¡Marcharos!'' instead of ''¡Idos!''

==== Non-normative ''-s'' on ''tú'' form ====
A form used for centuries but never accepted normatively has an ''-s'' ending in the second person singular of the preterite or simple past. For example, ''lo hicistes'' instead of the normative ''lo hiciste''; ''hablastes tú'' for ''hablaste tú''. That is the only instance in which the ''tú'' form does not end in an ''-s'' in the [[linguistic prescription|normative]] language.

[[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino]] has gone further with ''hablates''.

=== Third-person object pronoun variation ===
The third-person direct-object and indirect-object pronouns exhibit variation from region to region, from one individual to another, and even within the language of single individuals. The Real Academia Española prefers an "etymological" usage, one in which the indirect object function is carried by ''le'' (regardless of gender), and the direct object function is carried by ''la'' or ''lo'' (according to the gender of the antecedent, and regardless of its animacy).

The Academy also condones the use of ''le'' as a direct object form for masculine, animate antecedents (i.e. male humans). Deviations from these approved usages are named ''[[leísmo]]'' (for the use of ''le'' as a direct object), and ''[[laísmo]]'' and ''[[loísmo]]'' (for the use of ''la'' and ''lo'' as indirect objects). The object pronoun variation is studied in detail by {{Harvcoltxt|García|Otheguy|1977}}.

Here are some examples for this:

* '''Leísmo''': ''Le miraron'' (They saw him/her/it). &lt;u&gt;Normative&lt;/u&gt;: ''lo miraron'' or ''la miraron'' depending on the gender of the object.
* '''Laísmo''': ''La dijeron que se callara'' (They told her to shut up). &lt;u&gt;Normative&lt;/u&gt;: ''Le dijeron que se callara''. The person who is told something is an indirect object in Spanish, and the substituting pronoun is the same for both genders.
* '''Loísmo''': ''Lo dijeron que se callara'' (They told him to shut up). &lt;u&gt;Normative&lt;/u&gt;: ''Le dijeron que se callara''. See above.

=== ''Queísmo'' and ''dequeísmo'' ===
[[Dependent clause|Noun clauses]] in Spanish are typically introduced by the [[complementizer]] ''que'', and such a noun clause may serve as the object of the preposition ''de'', resulting in the sequence ''de que'' in the standard language.  This sequence, in turn, is often reduced colloquially to just ''que'', and this reduction is called ''[[queísmo]]''.

Some speakers, by way of [[hypercorrection]] (i.e. in an apparent effort to avoid the "error" of ''queísmo''), insert ''de'' before ''que'' in contexts where it is not prescribed in standard grammar.  This insertion of "extraneous" ''de'' before ''que'' — called ''[[dequeísmo]]'' — is generally associated with less-educated speakers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1760">Despite Chinese history's overall positive view of intellectuals, the '''Stinking Old Ninth''' ({{Zh|c=臭老九|p=chòu lǎo jiǔ}}) is a Chinese [[dysphemism]] for [[intellectual]]s used at two major points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Li|first=Kwok-sing|title=A glossary of political terms of the People's Republic of China|year=1995|publisher=The Chinese University Press|location=Hong Kong|pages=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term originated during the [[Yuan Dynasty]] where the [[Mongol]] conquerors identified ten "[[caste]]s" of Chinese: [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|bureaucrat]]s, [[official]]s, [[Buddhist monk]]s, [[Taoist priest]]s, [[physician]]s, [[worker]]s, [[hunter]]s, [[prostitute]]s, (ninth) [[Confucianism|Confucian]] scholars and finally [[beggar]]s, with only beggars at a status below the intellectuals.

During the [[Cultural Revolution]] the "Nine Black Categories" were: [[Landlord]]s, rich farmers, [[Anti-revolutionary|anti-revolutionaries]], bad influences, [[Right-wing politics|right-wingers]], [[traitor]]s, [[Espionage|spies]], [[capitalist roader]]s and (ninth) [[intellectual]]s.  While often attributed to [[Mao Zedong]], in 1977, [[Deng Xiaoping]] argued that it was the [[Gang of Four]] who came up with the phrase and that Mao himself saw intellectuals as having some value in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Deng|first=Xiaoping|title=Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, Volume 2|year=1984|publisher=Foreign Language Press|location=Beijing|chapter=Mao Zedong Thought Must be Correctly Understood as an Integral Whole}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Subjacency''' is a general syntactic [[locality (linguistics)|locality]] constraint on [[syntactic movement|movement]]. It specifies restrictions placed on movement and regards it as a strictly local process. This term was first defined by [[Noam Chomsky]] in 1973 and constitutes the main concept of the [[Government and Binding Theory]]. The revised definition of subjacency from Chomsky (1977) is as follows: "A cyclic rule cannot move a phrase from position Y to position X (or conversely) in … X … [α… [β… Y … ] … ] … X …, where α and β are cyclic nodes. Cyclic nodes are S and NP",&lt;ref&gt;(Chomsky 1977: 73)&lt;/ref&gt; (where S=[[Sentence (linguistics)|Sentence]] and NP=[[Noun Phrase]]).

This principle states that no movement can move an element over more than one [[bounding node]] at a time. In more recent frameworks, [[bounding nodes]] which are hurdles to movement are AgrP ([[Agreement phrase]]) and DP ([[Determiner phrase]]) (S and NP in Chomsky’s definition respectively). Therefore, Subjacency condition limits movement by defining [[bounding nodes]]. It also accounts for the fact that all movements are local.

== The subjacency condition in examples ==

The notion of bounding was first observed in the early [[generative grammar]] by, for instance, [[John R. Ross]] (1967). He noticed that movement is impossible out of certain phrases called [[Extraction island]]s. These evidence were further interpreted in terms of the [[Government and Binding Theory]] and Subjacency condition in the following way:

(1) who&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; did [&lt;sub&gt;AGRP&lt;/sub&gt; Mary think [&lt;sub&gt;CP&lt;/sub&gt; t&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; [&lt;sub&gt;AGRP&lt;/sub&gt; John saw t&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; ]]]

(2) *who&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; did [&lt;sub&gt;AGRP&lt;/sub&gt; John ask [&lt;sub&gt;CP&lt;/sub&gt; when&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; [&lt;sub&gt;AGRP&lt;/sub&gt; t&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; fixed the car t&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; ]]]

(3) *who&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; did [&lt;sub&gt;AGRP&lt;/sub&gt; John believe [&lt;sub&gt;DP&lt;/sub&gt; the statement [&lt;sub&gt;CP&lt;/sub&gt; t&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; that [&lt;sub&gt;AGRP&lt;/sub&gt; Bill hit t&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; ]]]]&lt;ref&gt;For more examples see Cook and Newson (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

In (1) the ''[[Wh-word|wh]]''-element moves out of the object position of the [[embedded clause]] via [[cyclic movement]], crossing only one AgrP at a time. Thereby, it respects the Subjacency condition and the sentence is grammatical. The details of this movement are presented in the diagram below:

(1)
[[File:Rys1.jpg]]

As the [[Specifier (linguistics)|specifier]] of CP position is empty in (1), the ''wh''-element may use it as an escape hatch before moving further. In the example (2), on the other hand, the [[Specifier (linguistics)|specifier]] of CP position is already taken and the ''wh''-element moves over two AgrP at a time, violating the Subjacency condition and yielding the ungrammatical sentence.

TENA is designed to promote integrated testing and [[simulation-based acquisition]] through the use of a large-scale, distributed, real-time synthetic environment, which integrates testing,
training, simulation, and high-performance computing technologies, distributed across many facilities, using a common architecture.&lt;ref&gt;TENA-2012-Paper-Final from the Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA) Website [https://www.tena-sda.org/download/attachments/6750/TENA-2012-Paper-Final.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

__TOC__

==Overview==

TENA recognizes five basic categories of [[software]]:
# TENA Applications (Range Resource Applications and TENA Tools) – Range Resource Applications are range instrumentation or processing systems (software applications) built to be compliant with TENA and are the heart of any TENA execution. TENA Tools are generally reusable TENA applications, stored in the repository and made available to the community, that help facilitate the management of a logical range through the entire range event lifecycle.
# Non-TENA Applications – range instrumentation/processing systems, systems-under-test, simulations, and C4ISR systems not built in accordance with TENA but needed for a test or training event.
# The TENA Common Infrastructure – those software subsystems that provide the foundation for achieving TENA’s goals and driving requirements. These include the TENA Repository, as a means for storing applications, object models, and other information between logical ranges; the TENA Middleware, for real-time information exchange; and the Event [[Data management system|Data Management System]], for storing scenario data, data collected during an event, and summary information.
# The TENA Object Models – the common language used for communication between all range resources and tools. The set of objects used in a logical range is called the “logical range object model (LROM)” and may contain TENA standard object definitions as well as non-standard (user-defined) object definitions.
# TENA Utilities – applications specifically designed to address issues related to usability or management of the TENA logical range.

'''Toposa''' (also Akara, Kare, Kumi, Taposa, Topotha) is a [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan language]] ([[Eastern Sudanic]], [[Nilotic languages|Nilotic]]) spoken in [[South Sudan]] by the [[Toposa people]].  Mutually intelligible language varieties include Jiye of South Sudan, [[Nyangatom language|Nyangatom]] of Ethiopia, [[Karimojong_language|Karimojong]], Jie&lt;ref&gt;Jiye and Jie are the same name, but refer to different varieties&lt;/ref&gt; and Dodos of Uganda and [[Turkana language|Turkana]] of Kenya.  [[Teso_language|Teso]] (spoken in both Kenya and Uganda) is lexically more distant.

*Toposa, like many Nilotic languages, has vowel harmony with two sets of vowels: a set with the tongue root advanced (+ATR) and a &amp;minus;ATR set.  +ATR is marked.  The vowel {{IPA|/a/}} is neutral with respect to vowel harmony.&lt;ref&gt;Schröder &amp; Schröder 1987b, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;
*All nine vowels also occur as devoiced, contrasting with their voiced counterparts.  These voiceless vowels occur primarily in prepause contexts.  Some Toposa morphemes consist only of a high voiceless vowel; the functional load appears to be much greater with the high vowels than with the lower.&lt;ref&gt;Schröder &amp; Schröder 1987a, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;
*Toposa has tone, which is grammatical rather than lexical.  Tone is used to mark case in nouns and tense in verbs.

'''Twm o’r Nant''' was the pen name of the [[Welsh language]] dramatist and poet '''Thomas Edwards''' (January 1739 &amp;ndash; 3 April 1810), also known as ''Tom of the Dingle''. He was famous for his ''anterliwtau'' (interludes or short plays), which he performed mainly around his native [[Denbighshire]].&lt;ref name=DWB/&gt;&lt;ref name=historypoints/&gt;

Edwards was born in [[Llannefydd]], [[Denbighshire]] (now in [[Conwy County Borough]]). When a child his parents moved to Y Nant Isaf ({{Language with name/for||Welsh|''Lower Brook''|links=no}}), near [[Nantglyn]], from which he took his pen name. Edwards had little formal education: he attended one of [[Griffith Jones (priest)|Griffith Jones]]' circulating schools where he learned to read, and attended a school in [[Denbigh]] for two weeks to learn English.&lt;ref name=DWB/&gt;&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; However, he was eager to learn to write – he cadged writing paper and wrote with ink that he made from [[Sambucus nigra|elderberries]].&lt;ref name=Borrow59/&gt;

In 1749 Edwards joined a local company of touring actors who typically performed on an improvised stage such as a cart. He wrote seven interludes before he was twenty years old, all of which have been lost.&lt;ref name=historypoints/&gt;&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

In 1763 Edwards married Elizabeth Hughes; the wedding was conducted by the poet-priest [[Evan Evans (poet)|Evan Evans (Ieuan Fardd)]]. The couple settled in Denbigh where Edwards worked hauling timber, performing in his interludes throughout North Wales, and selling printed copies of the interludes. After financial problems caused by the bankruptcy of his uncle for whom he stood [[surety]], Edwards moved to South Wales where he again worked in timber haulage and for a time kept an inn in [[Llandeilo]]. He returned to North Wales in 1786 where he resumed his performances of interludes and became a [[stonemason]]. During 1808 he worked for [[William Madocks]] on the construction of the [[Porthmadog]] embankment.&lt;ref name=DWB/&gt;

Edwards' interludes commentate on the social evils of his day, frequently referring to unpopular taxes, greedy landowners, swindling lawyers and immoral clergymen.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; They form a link between the medieval and modern traditions of Welsh drama.&lt;ref name=Barnes/&gt; Edwards also wrote and published [[ballads]], of which about 200 remain (some as fragments).&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; He wrote a short autobiography which was published in the periodical ''Y Greal'' in 1805.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; 

Edwards participated in the annual [[eisteddfodau]] of the [[Gwyneddigion Society]] (the precursors of the [[National Eisteddfod]]). His failure to win the main prize at the [[Corwen]] eisteddfod in 1789 may be due to a dispute over an impromptu composition competition with [[Gwallter Mechain|Walter Davies (Gwallter Mechain)]], in which Edwards was supported by [[David Samwell]] ([[Captain Cook]]'s surgeon). Samwell named Edwards ''The Cambrian Shakespeare'' and gave him a silver pen as a consolation prize for having been unfairly beaten. The silver pen is in the collection of [[National Museum Wales]].&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;&lt;ref name=NMW/&gt;

Edwards died on 3 April 1810 and was buried at St Marcella's church, Denbigh, where there is a memorial.&lt;ref name=DWB/&gt;

==Legacy==
Edwards' interludes were republished after his death, and a collection of six interludes were published by [[Isaac Foulkes]] in 1874.&lt;ref name=Gwaith/&gt;

[[George Borrow]] devotes two chapters to Edwards in his 1862 travel book ''[[Wild Wales|Wild Wales: Its People, Language and Scenery]]'', including a translation of part of Edwards' interlude ''Riches and Poverty''.&lt;ref name=Borrow59/&gt;&lt;ref name=Borrow60/&gt;

In 1974 the Welsh playwright [[Dedwydd Jones]] published ''Bard : a play on the life and times of Twm O'r Nant'', which was commissioned as the opening play of the [[Sherman Theatre]], Cardiff.&lt;ref name=Dedwydd_1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dedwydd_2/&gt;

'''Uralic–Yukaghir''' is a proposed [[language family]] composed of [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] and [[Yukaghir languages|Yukaghir]]. It is also known as Uralo-Yukaghir.

Uralic is a large and diverse family of languages spoken in northern and eastern [[Europe]] and northwestern [[Siberia]]. Among the better-known Uralic languages are [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]], and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]].

Yukaghir is a small family of languages spoken in eastern Siberia. It formerly extended over a much wider area (Collinder 1965:30). It consists of two languages, [[Northern Yukaghir language|Tundra Yukaghir]] and [[Southern Yukaghir language|Kolyma Yukaghir]].

== History ==

The idea that the Uralic and Yukaghir languages are related is not new. It was advanced in passing by [[Holger Pedersen (linguist)|Holger Pedersen]] in his 1931 book ''Linguistic Science in the Nineteenth Century'' (p.&amp;nbsp;338). Pedersen included both languages in his proposed [[Nostratic languages|Nostratic]] language family (ib.).

A [[genetic relationship (linguistics)|genetic relationship]] between Uralic and Yukaghir was argued for in ''Jukagirisch und Uralisch'' ('Yukaghir and Uralic'), a 1940 work by [[Björn Collinder]], one of the leading Uralic specialists of the 20th century (Greenberg 2005:124). Collinder was inspired by a 1907 article by Heikki Paasonen, which pointed to similarities between Uralic and Yukaghir, though it did not identify the two languages as genetically related (Greenberg, ib.).

Uralic–Yukaghir is listed as a language family in ''A Guide to the World's Languages'' by [[Merritt Ruhlen]] (1987).

Uralic and Yukaghir are listed as a language family, forming a subgroup of a higher-order family called "Eurasiatic", in [[Joseph Greenberg]]'s ''Indo-European and Its Closest Relatives'' (2000–2002). However, Greenberg did not present a discursive argument for this subgroup, presumably leaving it to the reader to work it out from the data on grammar and vocabulary he presented.

The Uralic–Yukaghir family has been accepted by the American Nostraticist [[Allan R. Bomhard|Allan Bomhard]] (2008:176, citing Ruhlen 1987:64–65) but without presenting any argument for it, and Russian linguist [[Vladimir Napolskikh]].

== Arguments ==
{{Essay|date=June 2009}}

Collinder summarizes his case for, not merely a relationship between Uralic and Yukaghir, but for a Uralic–Yukaghir language family, in his ''Introduction to the Uralic Languages'' (1965:30):

:The features common to Yukagir and Uralic are so numerous and so characteristic that they must be remainders of a primordial unity. The case system of Yukagir is almost identical with that of Northern Samoyed. The imperative of the verbs is formed with the same suffixes as in Southern Samoyed and the most conservative of the Fenno-Ugric languages. The two negative auxiliary verbs of the Uralic languages are also found in Yukagir. There are striking common traits in verb derivation. Most of the pronominal stems are more or less identical. Yukagir has half a hundred words in common with Uralic, in addition to those that may fairly be suspected of being loanwords. This number is not lower than should be expected on the assumption that Yukagir is akin to Uralic. In Yukagir texts one may find sentences of up to a dozen words that consist exclusively or almost exclusively of words that also occur in Uralic. Nothing in the phonologic or morphologic structure of Yukagir contradicts the hypothesis of affinity, and Yukagir agrees well with Uralic as far as the syntax is concerned.

Collinder goes on to compare Uralic with Indo-European (1965:30–34). He begins by saying, "An [[Indo-Uralic languages|Indo-Uralic]] affinity is far from being strictly proved", and emphasizes that he has not been able to find as many "plausible" cognates for Uralic and Indo-European as for Uralic and Yukaghir, at most about twenty. He then goes on to list 15 of these cognates, with reflexes in Uralic and Indo-European languages, and to discuss similarities between Uralic and Indo-European in [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]].
He makes no explicit statement on the [[subgrouping (linguistics)|subgrouping]] of the language family that must have existed if Uralic, Yukaghir, and Indo-European are all related. While the similarities he attributes to Uralic and Yukaghir, but not to Indo-European, such as the imperative endings, show closer kinship of Uralic and Yukaghir than of Uralic and Indo-European, the similarities he attributes to Uralic and Indo-European, but not to Uralic and Yukaghir, could also be placed in the balance, for example a plural in ''*-i''.

Collinder appears to enumerate approximately as many morphological similarities between Uralic and Indo-European as between Uralic and Yukaghir and at least as many similarities in pronouns (though his treatment of the pronouns is not very comprehensive), so that at bottom the case he makes, if any, for a closer relationship between Uralic and Yukaghir than between Uralic and Indo-European comes down to the fact that Uralic and Yukaghir, in his view, have about two and a half times as many fairly secure lexical cognates as Uralic and Indo-European — a fact that is certainly suggestive but cannot, in the present state of the question, be considered definitive.

Greenberg (2002) lists 115 lexical cognates for Uralic and Indo-European versus 44 lexical cognates for Uralic and Yukaghir. He lists 35 lexical cognates for Indo-European and Yukaghir. Of these cognates, 27 are common to Indo-European, Uralic, and Yukaghir.

Even if one considers Greenberg's listings to be only the result of inspection, as they do not involve the construction of a comprehensive set of sound correspondences, they at least constitute a suggestive preliminary result. However, a large number of Proto-Uralic lexemes are traditionally explained as loanwords from Proto-Indo-European.

The figures could also be skewed by the fact that the Indo-European and Uralic languages are much more heavily attested than the Yukaghir ones. However, the impressive figure is the 44 Uralic / Yukaghir cognates versus the 35 Indo-European / Yukaghir ones. This figure does not by any means suggest an overwhelmingly closer relationship of Yukaghir and Uralic than of Yukaghir and Indo-European, especially since the opportunities for mutual influence were much greater between Yukaghir and Uralic than between Yukaghir and Indo-European, both with regard to the transmission of innovations and the conservation of older forms (on the latter, cf. Sweet 1900:120–121).

It therefore appears that an explicit case for a Uralic–Yukaghir language family, as opposed to a Uralic–Yukaghir kinship at some unspecified higher level, has not been made. Collinder (1965:30) has vaguely implied the existence of a Uralic–Yukaghir genetic node, and in this he seems to have been followed by Ruhlen and Greenberg, followed in turn by Bomhard. The actual relations of these languages remain to be scrutinized in detail. No work of synthesis of a definitive nature has appeared on this subject. As in several other cases of this sort (see [[Ural–Altaic languages]]), that Uralic and Yukaghir are related has been argued for in some detail, but how they are related remains uncertain.

It is therefore not surprising that, at the present time (2009), the validity of the Uralic–Yukaghir family is controversial. The questions that need to be answered to make a definitive determination in favor of it or against it are:

* Can a genetic relationship between Uralic and Yukaghir be shown?
* If such a relationship can be shown, is it a close one (Uralic and Yukaghir form a language family), or a more distant one (Uralic and Yukaghir are related, but as independent members of a larger language family, such as the proposed [[Uralo-Siberian languages|Uralo-Siberian]] grouping)? (Cf. Greenberg 2005:325.)

In answering these questions, a key additional question is:

* To what extent are any non-coincidental similarities due to descent from a common ancestor, to what extent are they due to borrowing caused by [[areal feature|language contact]]?

The last question is a source of controversy, since [[historical linguistics|historical linguists]] are divided into two opposed camps that have been called "Geneticists" and "Diffusionists" by Merritt Ruhlen (1994:113–114) and are sometimes caricatured as "[[lumpers and splitters]]". This conflict will not soon be resolved. However, the fact that, for instance, no-one still believes in the [[Hamitic]] family or that the [[Dené–Yeniseian languages|Dené–Yeniseian]] family has recently{{When|date=June 2013}} attained general acceptance{{Speculation inline|date=June 2013}}&lt;!-- This statement is quite premature. It may have seemed at some point that the proposal would quickly find general acceptance, but it cannot be said to be consensus right now, see [[Dené–Yeniseian languages]] and its associated talk page. Simply removing the statement, however, could make the sentence seem nonsensical and destroy the whole point, so the sentence needs to be rewritten entirely. Perhaps a different example exists. --&gt; suggests that linguistic science may yet be able to resolve some of these seemingly intractable issues (cf. Vajda 2008).

Häkkinen (2012) rejects a genetic link between Uralic and Yukaghir, arguing that the grammatical systems show too few convincing resemblances, especially the morphology, and proposes instead that many apparent Uralic–Yukaghir cognates are really borrowed from an early stage of Uralic (ca. 3000 BC; he dates Proto-Uralic at ca. 2000 BC) into an early stage of Yukaghir, while Uralic was (according to him) spoken near the [[Sayan Mountains|Sayan]] region and Yukaghir near the Upper [[Lena River]] and near [[Lake Baikal]]. Aikio (2014) agrees that Uralic–Yukaghir is unsupported and implausible and that several apparent cognates are borrowings from Uralic into Yukaghir, though he rejects some of the examples adduced by Häkkinen as spurious or accidental resemblances and puts the date of borrowing much later, arguing that the loanwords he accepts as valid were borrowed from an early stage of Samoyedic (preceding Proto-Samoyedic; thus roughly in the 1st millennium BC) into Yukaghir, in the same general region west of Lake Baikal.

=== The evidence of the Uralic–Yukaghir negative verb ===

A more decisive piece of evidence that Uralic and Yukaghir form a valid genetic node comes from the presence of similar negative verb formations in each. In 1933, the pioneering Indo-Europeanist [[Holger Pedersen (linguist)|Holger Pedersen]] published a comparative study of the verb endings in Uralic and Indo-European. According to Pedersen (1933: §8), the Uralic negative verb was formed from a verb ''*e-'' meaning 'be' plus the personal endings, which are identical to the personal pronouns. For instance, for the verb ''*mene'' 'go', the Proto-Uralic forms would have been: 1s. ''*e-m mene'', 2s. ''*e-t mene''; 1p. ''*e-me mene'', 2p. ''*e-te mene'' meaning 'I do not go', 'thou dost not go', etc., literally 'be-me go', 'be-thou go', etc. The Uralic negative particle ''*ne'' 'not' would have originally formed part of the expression, as ''*ne e-m mene'' 'not be-me go' etc. What made it possible to drop the negative particle was that there was no morphological or syntactic possibility of confusing the expression with the positive verb, which had the form 1s. ''*mene-m'', 2s. ''*mene-t''; 1p. ''*mene-me'', 2p. ''*mene-te'' (still preserved without change in Finnish, except for final ''*-m'' &gt; ''-n'') 'I go', etc. The dropping of the negative particle is well-attested by such expressions as French ''pas'', ''personne'', ''rien'' and Old Norse ''engi'', ''eigi'' (ib.).

Pedersen’s argument implies that the Uralic negative verb is very ancient, for three reasons: (1) The Uralic negative verb represents a worn-down formation and is therefore presumably an old one. (2) It is built on an obsolete verb ‘to be’. (3) Most decisively, it is found in all branches of Uralic, including Samoyedic. Therefore, it is at least as ancient as Proto-Uralic, that is to say, some 4,500 or 6,500 years old, according to the two prevailing current estimates.

The Yukaghir negative verb is unlikely to be borrowed from Uralic, because morphological formations are rarely borrowed. Yet no evidence for the Uralic/Yukaghir negative verb formation is found in the Indo-European languages. It thus seems likely that the Uralic/Yukaghir negative verb goes back to a period of primitive Uralic–Yukaghir unity, from which Indo-European was separate. It could nevertheless be imagined that Indo-European once had this negative verb, but had lost it by Proto-Indo-European times, so this evidence is not conclusive, though strongly suggestive.

'''Visual semiotics''' is a sub-domain of semiotics that analyses the way visual images communicate a message.

Studies of meaning evolve from [[semiotics]], a philosophical approach that seeks to interpret messages in terms of signs and patterns of symbolism. Originating in literary and linguistic contexts, the study of [[semiotics]] (or semiology in [[France]]) has been expanding in a number of directions since the early turn-of-the-century work of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] in the U.S. and [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] and [[Ferdinand Saussure]] in France.

A sign can be a word, sound, or visual image. Saussure divides a sign into two components: the signifier, which is the sound, image, or word, and the signified, which is the concept or meaning the signifier represents. As Berger points out, the problem of meaning arises from the fact that the relation between the signifier and the signified is arbitrary and conventional. In other words, signs can mean anything we agree that they mean, as well as mean different things to different people. Nonverbal signs can produce many complex symbols and hold multiple meanings.

==Belgian input==
[[Image:Groupe Mu 1991.jpg|thumb|The Mu Group µ in 1991 : J.-M. Klinkenberg, P. Minguet, F. Edeline.]]The Belgian Mu Group ([[Groupe µ]]) (founded 1967) developed a structural version of visual semiotics, on a cognitive basis, as well as a [[visual rhetoric]].&lt;ref&gt;Trait of sign visual (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

Most signs operate on several levels—iconic as well as symbolic and/or indexical. This suggests that visual semiotic analysis may be addressing a hierarchy of meaning in addition to categories and components of meaning. As [[Umberto Eco]] explains, "what is commonly called a 'message' is in fact a ''text'' whose content is a multilevel ''discourse''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Umberto Eco|title=A Theory of Semiotics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BoXO4ItsuaMC&amp;pg=PA57|accessdate=13 July 2013|year=1979|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-20217-8|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The broadening concept of text and discourse encourages additional research into how visual communication operates to create meaning. Deely explains that "at the heart of [[semiotics]] is the realization that the whole of human experience, without exception, is an interpretive structure mediated and sustained by signs." [[Semiotics]] now considers a variety of texts, using Eco's terms, to investigate such diverse areas as movies, art, advertisements, and fashion, as well as visuals. In other words, as Berger explains, "the essential breakthrough of semiology is to take linguistics as a model and apply linguistic concepts to other phenomena--texts--and not just to language itself." Anthropologists like [[Grant McCracken]] and marketing experts like [[Sydney Levy]] have even used semiotic interpretations to analyze the rich cultural meanings of products and consumer consumption behaviors as texts.

Visual texts are an important area of analysis for semioticians and particularly for scholars working with visually intensive forms such as advertising and television because images are such a central part of our [[mass communication]] sign system. Linda Scott has deconstructed the images in perfume advertising as well as in Apple's "1984" commercial using close readings of the various messages that can be interpreted from the ads. Shay Sayre has also looked at perfume advertising images and the visual rhetoric in Hungary's first free election television advertisements using [[semiotic analysis]]. Also using [[semiotics]], [[Arthur Asa Berger]] has deconstructed the meaning of the "1984" commercial as well as programs such as Cheers and films such as Murder on the Orient Express.

Systems of meaning, Culler and Berger tells us, are analyzed by looking at cultural and communication products and events as signs and then by analysing the relationship between these signs. The categories of signs and the relationships between them create a system. Barthes, for example, has analyzed the "fashion system," and classified the system of communication through fashion into two categories: image clothing and descriptive clothing. Likewise, an advertisement has its own system of meaning. We expect an appeal to purchase, either directly or implied, to be made and a product to be shown, for example, as part of the advertising system.&lt;ref&gt;Visual Communication Division of AEJMC, Washington, DC, August 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

In their book Discourses in Place: Language in the material world, Ron Scollon and Suzie Wong Scollon note that visual semiotics has to do with turning “from the spoken, face-to-face discourses to the representations of that interaction order in images and signs” (82). Interaction order involves the various social interactions that takes place in any setting, such as being alone, being with a companion, at a meeting, watching a show etc., and it “is almost always complex,” with various interactions occurring at once (83). When it comes to images, says Scollon and Wong, there are also multiple relationships. These include the relationships between the components of a visual image, the relationships between the producers of the visual image, the relationships between the producers and the components, as well as the relationships between the components of an image and those who are viewing it. That's are the main point.

This interaction order has four main semiotic systems, says Scollon and Wong. These include represented participants, modality, composition and interactive participants. Represented participants are elements of a visual image, and are either narrative (“present unfolding actions and events or… processes of change”) or conceptual (“show abstract, comparative or generalized categories”) (Scollon and Wong 86). Modality is how true to reality a visual image is, and main indicators include color saturation, color differentiation, depth, illumination and brightness, among others. With modality, it is often found “that truth, veracity, or sincerity might be expressed in very different ways from one society to another,” with Western cultures favoring naturalistic representation, or as true to seeing it in person as possible (Scollon and Wong 89-90).

Composition is the way in which represented participants within a visual image are arranged in relation to one another, with the three main systems of compositions being ideal-real(top to bottom), given-new(left to right), and center-margin relationships (Scollon and Wong 92). So for example, when reading a menu at a fast food restaurant, the given information would be something such as “hamburger,” and the new information would be the price, read left to right and recognized in that order. As mentioned above, interactive participants, explain Scollon and Wong, are the various relationships that occur around a visual image, such as those between the producers of the image and the represented participants in that image. In this way, these four components work together to help convey the meaning of signs and symbols.&lt;ref&gt;Scollon, Ronald, and Suzanne B. K. Wong Scollon. Discourses in Place: Language in the Material World. London: Routledge, 2003. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Association of Visual Semiotics==
The [[International Association of Visual Semiotics]] was formed in 1989. The Association, being of an international nature, recognizes three official languages: English, French, and Spanish. The Association is in French and Spanish:  Association Internationale de Sémiotique Visuelle and El Asociación Internacional de Semiótica Visual, respectively.

Congresses have been held in Blois (France) 1989,  Bilbao (Spain) 1992, Berkeley (California, USA) 1994,  São Paulo (Brazil) 1996, Siena (Italy) 1999, Québec (Canada) 2001, Mexico city 2003, Lyon (France) 2004, Istanbul (Turkey) 2007, Venice (Italy) 2010, and Buenos Aires (Argentina) 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AISV Buenos Aires 2012 |url=http://www.aisv2012.org |accessdate=13 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* President: José Luis Caivano (University of Buenos Aires, Argentina)
* General Secretary: [[Göran Sonesson]] (University of Lund, Sweden).

Previous Presidents: [[Jean-Marie Klinkenberg]] (2001-2012), Paolo Fabbri (1998-2001), Ana Claudia de Oliveira (1996-1998), [[Jacques Fontanille]] (1994-1996), Fernande Saint-Martin (1990-1994), Michel Costantini (1989-1990).

Visual Semiotics are also associated with that of Film, Fashion and Advertising. it is suggested that the use of semiotics in films are used to connote a specific underlying theme like that of the nuclear bomb in Godzilla.

Like most playwrights of his period, [[William Shakespeare]] did not always write alone. A number of his surviving plays are collaborative, or were revised by others after their original composition, although the exact number is open to debate. Some of the following attributions, such as ''[[The Two Noble Kinsmen]]'', have well-attested contemporary documentation; others, such as ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'', are dependent on linguistic analysis by modern scholars; recent work on [[Stylometry|computer analysis of textual style]] (word use, word and phrase patterns) has given reason to believe that parts of some of the plays ascribed to Shakespeare are actually by other writers. 

In some cases the identity of the collaborator is known; in other cases there is a scholarly consensus; in others it is unknown or disputed. These debates are the province of [[Shakespeare attribution studies]]. Most collaborations occurred at the very beginning and the very end of Shakespeare's career.

==Elizabethan authorship==
The [[Elizabethan theatre]] was nothing like the modern theatre, but rather more like the modern [[film industry]]. Scripts were often written quickly, older scripts were revised, and many were the product of collaboration. The unscrupulous nature of the Elizabethan book printing trade complicates the attribution of plays further; for example, [[William Jaggard]], who published the [[First Folio]], also published ''[[The Passionate Pilgrim]] by W. Shakespeare'', which is mostly the work of other writers.

==Shakespeare's collaborations==
===Early works===
* ''[[Edward III (play)|Edward III]]'' was published anonymously in 1596. It was first attributed to Shakespeare in a bookseller's catalogue published in 1656.&lt;ref&gt;W. W. Greg, ''A List of Masques, Pageants, &amp;c. Supplementary to "A List of English Plays",'' Appendix II, lxiv (1902)&lt;/ref&gt; Various scholars have suggested Shakespeare's possible authorship, since a number of passages appear to bear his stamp, among other sections that are remarkably uninspired. In 1996, [[Yale University Press]] became the first major publisher to produce an edition of the play under Shakespeare's name. A consensus is emerging that the play was written by a team of dramatists including Shakespeare early in his career – but exactly who wrote what is still open to debate. The play is included in the Second Edition of the ''Complete Oxford Shakespeare'' (2005), where it is attributed to "William Shakespeare and Others", and in the ''Riverside Shakespeare''. In 2009, [[Brian Vickers (academic)|Brian Vickers]] published the results of a computer analysis using a program designed to detect plagiarism, which suggests that 40% of the play was written by Shakespeare with the other scenes written by [[Thomas Kyd]] (1558–1594).&lt;ref name=vickers&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/stage/article6870086.ece|title=Computer program proves Shakespeare didn't work alone, researchers claim|publisher=Times of London|first=Jack|last=Malvern|date=12 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Henry VI, Part 1]]'': possibly the work of a team of playwrights, whose identities are unknown. Some scholars argue that Shakespeare wrote less than 20% of the text. [[Gary Taylor (scholar)|Gary Taylor]] argues that the first act was the work of [[Thomas Nashe]].&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Gary. "Shakespeare and Others: The Authorship of Henry the Sixth, Part One", Medieval and Renaissance Drama, 7 (1995), 145–205.&lt;/ref&gt; Paul J. Vincent concludes that, in light of recent research into the Elizabethan theatre, ''1 Henry VI'' is Shakespeare's partial revision of a play by Nashe (Act 1) and an unknown playwright (Acts 2–5), the original of which was performed in early 1592. Shakespeare's work in the play, which was most likely composed in 1594, can be found in Act 2 (scene 4) and Act 4 (scenes 2–5 and the first 32 lines of scene 7).&lt;ref&gt;Vincent (2005: 377–402)&lt;/ref&gt;  Vincent's authorship findings, especially with regard to Nashe's authorship of Act 1, are supported overall by [[Brian Vickers (academic)|Brian Vickers]], who agrees with the theory of co-authorship and differs only slightly over the extent of Shakespeare's contribution to the play, tentatively identifying Thomas Kyd as the author of the rest of the play.&lt;ref&gt;Vickers (2007: 311–352)&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'': seen as a collaboration with, or revision of, [[George Peele]]. See [[Authorship of Titus Andronicus|Authorship of ''Titus Andronicus'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/treasures/shakespeare/titus.html|title=Titus Andronicus - Shakespeare in quarto|first=Moira|last=Goff|date=|website=www.bl.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Sir Thomas More (play)|Sir Thomas More]]'': some pages of the manuscript of this play are in Shakespeare's handwriting, with the assembled text being a collaboration with [[Anthony Munday]] (the primary author) and others.&lt;ref&gt;Bald, R.C., "The Booke of Sir Thomas More and Its Problems." Shakespeare Survey II (1949), pp. 44–65; Evans, G. Blakemore. Introduction to Sir Thomas More. The Riverside Shakespeare. Herschel Baker, Anne Barton, Frank Kermode, Harry Levin, Hallett Smith, and Marie Edel, eds. Boston, New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1974, 1997, p. 1683; McMillin, Scott. The Elizabethan Theatre and "The Book of Sir Thomas More". Ithaca, N.Y., Cornell University Press, 1987, pp. 82–3, 140–4, etc.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[The Spanish Tragedy]]'': although definitely known to be by Thomas Kyd, [[Thomas Pavier]]'s edition of 1602 added five new passages to the preexisting text, totaling 320 lines, with the most substantial addition being an entire scene, known as the ''"painter scene"'', since it is dominated by Hieronimo's conversation with a painter. Even before Pavier's quarto, however, the scene seems to have been in existence and known to audiences, since [[John Marston (poet)|John Marston]] parodies the painter scene in his 1599 play ''[[Antonio and Mellida]]''. The five additions in the 1602 text may have been made for the 1597 revival by the Admiral's Men. In 2013, scholar Douglas Bruster, after comparing spellings in the additions with what we know of Shakespeare's handwriting, concluded that Shakespeare did indeed write the additions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/13/arts/further-proof-of-shakespeares-hand-in-the-spanish-tragedy.html|title=Further Proof of Shakespeare’s Hand in ‘The Spanish Tragedy’|first=Jennifer|last=Schuessler|date=12 August 2013|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruster attributed mistakes in the text of the additions to the illegibility of Shakespeare's handwriting; the resulting mistakes have led to the devaluing of the portions that Shakespeare presumably wrote.

===Collaboration with Wilkins===
* ''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre]]'': includes the work of [[George Wilkins]]. Most scholars take the view that Wilkins wrote the first two acts, and Shakespeare the last three.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fbrt.org.uk/pages/essays/essay-shakespeare%20collaboration.html|title=Collaborations|author=|date=|website=fbrt.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hope, Jonathan. The Authorship of Shakespeare's Plays: A Socio-Linguistic Study (Cambridge, 1994); Jackson, MacDonald P. "The Authorship of Pericles: The Evidence of Infinitives", Note &amp; Queries 238 (2993): pp. 197–200; Jackson 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collaborations with Middleton===
* ''[[Macbeth]]'': [[Thomas Middleton]] may have revised this tragedy as it appears in the [[First Folio]] in 1615 to incorporate extra musical sequences.
* ''[[Measure for Measure]]'': may have undergone a light revision by Middleton at some point after its original composition. As with ''Macbeth'', the only source is that of the [[First Folio]].
* ''[[Timon of Athens]]'': may result from collaboration between Shakespeare and Middleton which might explain its incoherent plot and unusually cynical tone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bard.org/education/resources/shakespeare/timonimperfect.html|title=Timon of Athens, with Middleton|author=|date=|website=bard.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[All's Well That Ends Well]]'': research published in 2012 by Emma Smith and Laurie Maguire of [[Oxford University]] suggests a collaboration between Shakespeare and Middleton.&lt;ref&gt;^ a b Maguire, Laurie (19 April 2012). "Many Hands – A New Shakespeare Collaboration?". The Times Literary Supplement. also at Centre for Early Modern Studies, University of Oxford accessed 22 April 2012: "The recent redating of ''All's Well'' from 1602–03 to 1606–07 (or later) has gone some way to resolving some of the play's stylistic anomalies" ... "[S]tylistically it is striking how many of the widely acknowledged textual and tonal problems of ''All's Well'' can be understood differently when we postulate dual authorship."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collaborations with Fletcher===
* ''[[The History of Cardenio|Cardenio]]'', a lost play; contemporary reports say that Shakespeare collaborated on it with [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wam.umd.edu/~david/cardenio1.htm|title=Don Quixote portal|author=|date=|website=umd.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Henry VIII (play)|Henry VIII]]'': generally considered a collaboration between Shakespeare and Fletcher.
* ''[[The Two Noble Kinsmen]]'', published in quarto in 1634 and attributed to John Fletcher and William Shakespeare on the title page;&lt;ref&gt;Potter, Lois (ed.), Fletcher, John and Shakespeare, William ''The Two Noble Kinsmen'' The Arden Shakespeare: Third Series, Thomson Learning 1997, {{ISBN|1-904271-18-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; each playwright appears to have written about half of the text. It is excluded from the First Folio.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cummingsstudyguides.net/xTwoNoble.html Authorship of ''Two Noble Kinsmen'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uq.edu.au/emsah/drama/fletcher/nf/tnk/tnk_q/tnk_misc/division.html|title=''Two Noble Kinsmen'' – Qualifying the authorship|author=|date=|website=uq.edu.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Wine &amp; Spirit Education Trust''', often referred to as '''WSET''', is a global organisation which arranges courses and exams in the field of [[wine]] and [[Distilled beverage|spirits]]. WSET was founded in 1969&lt;ref name=tjrwt&gt;{{cite web|last= Ray |first= Johnathan, ''The Daily Telegraph'' |title= The top wine-tasting courses |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/wine/main.jhtml?xml=/wine/2008/08/29/wine-jonathan-ray129.xml|date= August 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, is headquartered in [[London]]&lt;ref&gt;wset.co.uk [http://www.wset.co.uk/about_us/default.asp WSET: About us], accessed on February 4, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and is generally regarded as one of the world's leading provider of wine education.&lt;ref&gt;J. Robinson (ed), ''[[The Oxford Companion to Wine]]'', Third Edition, p. 769, Oxford University Press 2006, {{ISBN|0-19-860990-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, it opened its first international office, WSET Asia Pacific, in [[Hong Kong]] in response to high demand for wine and spirit education across Greater China&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wsetglobal.com/news-events/news/2016/october/25/wset-opens-first-international-office-in-hong-kong/|title=WSET Opens First International Office in Hong Kong {{!}} Wine &amp; Spirit Education Trust|website=www.wsetglobal.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==History and management==
WSET grew out of the Wine &amp; Spirit Association’s Education Committee and was set up with the financial assistance of the Vintners’ Company. The management of the WSET reports to a Board of Trustees made up of 8 members; three from The Vintners’ Company, three from the Wine &amp; Spirit Association, one from the Worshipful Company of Distillers and another one from the Institute of [[Masters of Wine]].&lt;ref&gt;wsetglobal.com [http://www.wsetglobal.com/about_us/history/default.asp], accessed on March 14, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Courses==
[[File:Cropped WSET level 3.png|right|thumb|Award certification letter and pin for completion of the Level 3 program in Wine &amp; Spirits.]]
The courses given by WSET were originally intended for people in the wine &amp; spirit trade. The WSET programmes have increasingly been attended also by non-professional [[connoisseur]]s. The WSET offers professional certification in more than 70 countries worldwide, and have been favorably reviewed by the US-based trade group SOMM. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.somm.us/wine-spirit-education-trust/|title=Wine &amp; Spirit Education Trust  |publisher=SOMM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The course content of WSET courses has its focus on general theoretical knowledge of the world of wine and spirits (countries and regions of production, regulations, their style of wine and spirits, grape varieties etc.), and practical identification of beverages and their flavours, including [[wine tasting]] techniques.

The attainment of the WSET Diploma is one of the few avenues of qualifying to enter the [[Master of Wine]] program.
