The '''2007–2008 Ethiopian crackdown in Ogaden''' was a military campaign by the [[Ethiopian Army]] against the [[Ogaden National Liberation Front]] (ONLF). The crackdown against the guerrillas began after they [[Abole raid|killed 74 people in an attack]] on a Chinese-run oil exploration field in April 2007.

The main military operations were centered on the towns of [[Degehabur]], [[Kebri Dahar]], [[Werder, Ethiopia|Werder]] and [[Shilavo]] in [[Ogaden]], which are in the [[Ethiopia]]n [[Somali Region]]. The area is home to the [[Ogaden (clan)|Ogaden clan]], seen as the bedrock of support of the ONLF.&lt;ref name = AlertNet&gt;[http://www.alertnet.org/db/crisisprofiles/ET_OGA.htm?v=in_detail Ethiopia Ogaden crisis], [[Reuters]] AlertNet, 1st December, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Human Rights Watch]] (HRW), various [[human rights]] abuses were committed by the [[Ethiopian military]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/reports/2008/ethiopia0608/3.htm |title=Collective Punishment: War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity in the Ogaden area of Ethiopia's Somali Regional State: Summary |publisher=Hrw.org |date= |accessdate=2010-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

=== Insurgency ===
{{main|Insurgency in Ogaden}}
Ethiopia's eastern Somali Region, whose major part constitutes the Ogaden, is the site of a long-running, low-intensity armed conflict between the Ethiopian Government and the ONLF.&lt;ref name = HRW47&gt;[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2007/07/02/ethiop16327.htm Ethiopia: Crackdown in East Punishes Civilians], [[Human Rights Watch]], July 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Formed in 1984, many of the ONLF's members had supported [[Somalia]] in the [[Ogaden War]] with Ethiopia over the region in the 1970s. The group's aims have varied over time from independence to joining a "[[greater Somalia]]" or obtaining greater autonomy within Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/674C444B-B772-4A5D-982E-384399CC8010.htm Unrest simmers in Ethiopia's Ogaden], ''AlJazeera'', April 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Somali land 2007 05 18.png|left|thumb|Areas of fighting on 18 May 2007, shown in dark red.]]

On October 21, 2007, the ONLF stated its forces had killed 250 soldiers during the battle near the town of Werder. There was no confirmation of the attack either from the Ethiopian Government or from independent sources.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,22633366-5005961,00.html Rebels claim 250 troops killed]," ''[[Herald Sun]]'', October 23, 2007.   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025065149/http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0%2C21985%2C22633366-5005961%2C00.html |date=October 25, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 4, the ONLF claimed that up to 270 Ethiopian soldiers had been killed in clashes between October 26 and November 1.

== Allegations of human rights abuses ==

=== Abuses perpetrated by the Ethiopian military ===
[[File:Somali region and towns.PNG|thumb|right|300px|[[Ethiopia]]n [[Somali region]] and major flashpoints.]]
Ethiopia's military campaign has triggered a serious [[humanitarian crisis]], according to several humanitarian organisations.

According to [[Human Rights Watch]], civilians in the Somali region were trapped between the warring parties. HRW learned that dozens of civilians have been killed in what appeared to have been a deliberate effort to mete out collective punishment against a civilian population suspected of sympathizing with the rebels.&lt;ref&gt;Porteous, Tom."[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2007/08/05/ethiop16594.htm Ethiopia's dirty war]," ''[[Guardian Unlimited]]'' (re-published by [[Human Rights Watch]]), August 05, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Refugees fleeing the crackdown told stories of widespread violence, with entire villages being destroyed along with arbitrary theft, rape and murder by Ethiopian soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Africa_22/Ethiopia_starves_kills_own_people_its_refugees_say.shtml Ethiopia starves, kills own people, its refugees say] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019020108/http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Africa_22/Ethiopia_starves_kills_own_people_its_refugees_say.shtml |date=2007-10-19 }}," ''[http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/index.shtml GaroweOnline] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511165314/http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/index.shtml |date=2008-05-11 }}'', September 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2007, ''[[The Independent]]'' reported that the situation in Ogaden had begun to mirror the [[Darfur conflict]], with refugees stating that government troops had burned villages and raped and killed civilians.&lt;ref name="independent2007-10-17"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/world/africa/article3067244.ece|title=Ethiopia's 'own Darfur' as villagers flee government-backed violence|accessdate=2007-10-23|last=Bloomfield|first=Steve|date=2007-10-17|work=The Independent|publisher=Independent News and Media Ltd|quote=[Refugees'] stories reveal the brutality of Ethiopia's hidden war, a brutal counter-insurgency that some aid officials believe has parallels with Darfur.|location=London|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019012514/http://news.independent.co.uk/world/africa/article3067244.ece|archivedate=19 October 2007|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier in the month, Human Rights Watch had told the [[United States House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa and Global Health]] that "the Ogaden is not Darfur.

Human Rights Watch says it has documented dozens of cases of severe abuse by Ethiopian troops in the Ogaden, including gang rapes, burned villages and what it calls "demonstration killings," like hanging and beheading of populace, meant to terrorize the population.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;[[Jeffrey Gettleman|Gettleman, Jeffrey]].

=== Forceful draft of civilians ===
Several Ethiopian refugees and international organizations reported in December 2007 that the Ethiopian military, strained by its deployment in Somalia, was forcing local civilians (including government employees and health workers) to fight alongside troops against the ONLF rebels. According to the same reports, these under-equipped and poorly trained militias suffered heavy casualties in several battles. One Western aid official said soldiers barged into hospitals to [[Conscription|draft]] recruits and threatened to jail health workers if they did not comply. In other cases, lists of names were posted on public bulletin boards, ordering government employees to report for duty, according to a current member of the regional parliament and two Ethiopian administrators who have fled the country. Many of those who refused were fired, jailed and in some cases tortured, the administrators and parliament member said.&lt;ref name=IHT&gt;Gettleman, Jeffrey. "[http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/12/14/africa/ethiopia.php Civilians are forced to fight Ethiopian rebels]," ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'', December 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethiopian officials denied the charges, claiming that local tribes were willingly forming defense groups against the ONLF. Several United Nations officials and Western diplomats said they were discussing the militia program in private meetings, but contended they could not comment publicly for fear of provoking the ire of the Ethiopian government, resulting in a possible suspension of humanitarian efforts in the region.&lt;ref name=IHT/&gt;

== Expulsions of humanitarian agencies ==
Large segments of the region were inaccessible to outside agencies as Ethiopian troops attempted to suppress the rebel insurgency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6975126.stm#map Ethiopia rebels 'agree UN truce'], ''[[BBC News]]'', September 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 6, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) announced opening an aid facility in the Ogaden region. The U.N. has also called for an independent investigation into allegations of human rights abuses by Ethiopian forces in the region. Government troops are fighting ONLF rebels who want more autonomy for their region.&lt;ref name="reuters2007-11-06"&gt;{{cite news|first=Barry |last=Malone |title=UN to open office in Ethiopia's troubled Ogaden |url=http://africa.reuters.com/wire/news/usnL06251906.html |work=Africa.reuters.com |publisher=Reuters |date=2007-11-06 |accessdate=2007-11-06 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071123123916/http://africa.reuters.com/wire/news/usnL06251906.html |archivedate=23 November 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Médecins Sans Frontières is among the 12 organizations that have received permission to work in Ogaden, while the ICRC is still barred from working in the region.&lt;ref name="reuters2007-11-06" /&gt;

== The Eritrea and Somalia factors ==

Experts say the ONLF was active in the Somali capital [[Mogadishu]] during 2006 while that city was controlled by the [[Islamic Courts Union]], and that some Islamist fighters may have fled to Ogaden after they were [[Fall of Mogadishu|ousted from Mogadishu]].&lt;ref name = AlertNet/&gt;

'''Africa Beyond''' is a project celebrating African arts and culture in the UK, supported by [[Arts Council England]], the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]], the [[British Museum]], the [[Southbank Centre]], iniva (Institute for International Visual Arts) and other partners.

Africa Beyond was founded in March 2006, based in [[London]]. It was created as a legacy of Africa 05, a major celebration of African arts, held throughout 2005. It organises artist residencies linking Africa and the UK, runs public events such as the Word from Africa festival (first hosted at the British Museum in May 2007), and works with arts venues to improve their links with African audiences and artists.

The BBC hosted the Africa Beyond website, which features articles on African music, film, theatre, dance, literature and visual arts, with a special focus on artists and stories relevant to audiences in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesouthafrican.com/bbc-launches-africa-beyond/ "BBC launches Africa Beyond"], TheSouthAfrica.com, 27 march 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The website is no longer updated.

'''''Akete''''' (or '''''kete''''') are drums commonly used in [[Nyabinghi rhythm|Nyabinghi]] music, and ''kete'' is sometimes used to refer to one of these drums, the "repeater".&lt;ref name="Moskowitz2"&gt;{{cite book| last = Moskowitz| first = David Vlado| title = The Words and Music of Bob Marley| year = 2007| publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group| isbn = 978-0-275-98935-4| page = 161 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hebdige"&gt;{{cite book| last = Hebdige| first = Dick| title = Cut 'n' mix culture, identity, and Caribbean music| year = 1987| publisher = Comedia (US)| isbn = 978-0-415-05875-9| page = 39 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Akete drums consist of a larger bass (or "baandu") drum, a "funde" (or "fundeh"), and a "repeater".&lt;ref name="Moskowitz"&gt;{{cite book| last = Moskowitz| first = David Vlado| title = Caribbean Popular Music An Encyclopedia of Reggae, Mento, Ska, Rock Steady, and Dancehall| year = 2006| publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group| isbn = 978-0-313-33158-9| page = 7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roberts"&gt;{{cite book| last = Roberts| first = June E.| title = Reading Erna Brodber Uniting the Black Diaspora Through Folk Culture and Religion| year = 2006| publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group| isbn = 978-0-313-32074-3| page = 212 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The funde and repeater are of similar size, but the funde has a slack drum head while the repeater has a tighter head, giving a higher note.&lt;ref name="Moskowitz" /&gt; The drums are double-membraned, with heads are generally made of [[goat]] skin.&lt;ref name="Hebdige" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garfield Smith, Michael; Augier, Roy; Nettleford, Rex M. (1978), ''The Rastafari movement in Kingston, Jamaica'', University of the West Indies, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bass drum is typically held in the lap and beaten with a padded stick (a tennis ball is often used), while the funde and repeater are held on the floor between the knees and played with the hands, the funde with the palms and the repeater with the fingertips.&lt;ref name="Murrell"&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Murrell| first1 = Nathaniel Samuel| last2 = Spencer| first2 = William David| last3 = McFarlane| first3 = Adrian Anthony| title = Chanting Down Babylon The Rastafari Reader| year = 1998| publisher = Temple University Press| isbn = 978-1-56639-584-7| pages = 233–4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally from the [[Asanteman|Asante]] of modern-day [[Ghana]] (which is also the name of the dance which the drums are used for) via the [[trans-Atlantic slave trade]]&lt;ref&gt;Joseph S. Kaminski, ''Asante Ivory Trumpet Music in Ghana: Culture Tradition and Sound Barrage''.&lt;/ref&gt; and then in [[Burru]] music, which was played in Jamaica as far back as the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="Moskowitz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Murrell" /&gt; They became commonly used in [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]] ghettos in the mid 20th century, after being introduced by migrants from rural Jamaica.&lt;ref name="Edmonds"&gt;{{cite book| last = Edmonds| first = Ennis Barrington| title = Rastafari From Outcasts to Culture Bearers| year = 2003| publisher = Oxford University Press on Demand| isbn = 978-0-19-513376-9| page = 100 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Al-Aqsa Mosque''' ({{lang-ar|ٱلْـمَـسْـجِـد الْاَقْـصَى|Al-Masjid al-Aqṣā}}, {{IPA-ar|ʔælˈmæsdʒɪd ælˈʔɑqsˤɑ|IPA|ArAqsaMosque.ogg}}, "the Farthest Mosque"), located in the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]] of [[Jerusalem]], is the [[Holiest sites in Islam|third holiest site]] in [[Islam]]. The mosque was built on top of the [[Temple Mount]], known as [[Haram esh-Sharif]] in Islam. [[Muslim]]s believe that [[Muhammad]] was transported from the [[Great Mosque of Mecca|Sacred Mosque]] in [[Mecca]] to al-Aqsa during the [[Isra and Mi'raj|Night Journey]]. [[Hadith|Islamic tradition]] holds that Muhammad led prayers towards this site until the 17th month after [[Hegira|his migration from Mecca to Medina]], when [[Allah|Allāh]] directed him to turn towards the [[Kaaba]] in Mecca.

The covered mosque building was originally a small prayer house erected by [[Umar]], the second caliph of the [[Rashidun]] Caliphate, but was rebuilt and expanded by the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] caliph [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]] and finished by his son [[Al-Walid I|al-Walid]] in 705 CE. The mosque was completely destroyed by an earthquake in 746 and rebuilt by the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] caliph [[al-Mansur]] in 754. It was rebuilt again in 780. Another earthquake destroyed most of al-Aqsa in 1033, but two years later the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] caliph [[Ali az-Zahir]] built another mosque whose outline is preserved in the current structure. The mosaics on the arch at the qibla end of the nave also go back to his time.

During the periodic renovations undertaken, the various ruling dynasties of the Islamic [[Caliphate]] constructed additions to the mosque and its precincts, such as its dome, facade, its ''[[minbar]]'', minarets and the interior structure. When the [[Crusades|Crusaders]] captured Jerusalem in 1099, they used the mosque as a palace and the Dome of the Rock as a church, but its function as a mosque was restored after its recapture by [[Saladin]] in 1187. More renovations, repairs and additions were undertaken in the later centuries by the [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]]s, [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]]s, [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]s, the [[Supreme Muslim Council]], and [[Jordan]]. Today, the Old City is under [[Israeli-occupied territories|Israeli control]], but the mosque remains under the administration of the Jordanian/Palestinian-led Islamic ''[[Jerusalem Islamic Waqf|Waqf]]''.

The mosque is located in close proximity to historical sites significant in [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]], most notably the site of the [[Second Temple]], the [[Holy places#Judaism|holiest site in Judaism]]. As a result the area is highly sensitive, and has been a flashpoint in the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=qZjih7ngVokC&amp;pg=PA355&amp;dq=%22al-aqsa%22+second+temple&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj_jbjW-K_bAhVsJJoKHYQuA7AQ6AEIMjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22al-aqsa%22%20second%20temple&amp;f=false The Archaeology of the Holy Land: From the Destruction of Solomon's Temple to the Muslim Conquest], Cambridge University Press, Jodi Magness, page 355&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
''Al-Masjid al-Aqsa'' translates from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] into English as "the farthest mosque". The name refers to a chapter of the [[Quran]] called ''[[Isra and Mi'raj|Al-Isrā’]]'' ({{lang-ar|ٱلْإِسْـرَاء}}), "The Night Journey"), in which it is said that [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]] travelled from Mecca to "the farthest mosque", and then up to [[Heaven]] on a heavenly creature called ''[[Buraq|al-Burāq ash-Sharīf]]'' ({{lang-ar|ٱلْـبُـرَاق الـشَّـرِيْـف}}).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |title=Al-Aqsa Mosque, Jerusalem |publisher=Atlas Travel and Tourist Agency |url=http://www.atlastours.net/holyland/al_aqsa_mosque.html |accessdate=29 June 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080726195105/http://www.atlastours.net/holyland/al_aqsa_mosque.html| archivedate= 26 July 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lailat al Miraj |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC MMVIII |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/holydays/lailatalmiraj.shtml |accessdate=29 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
===Haram vs. Al-Aqsa===
Although in its narrowest sense, the Al-Aqsa indicates the silver-domed [[mosque]] on the southern side of the Temple Mount plaza, the term "Al-Aqsa" has often been used to refer to the entire area, including the [[mosque]], along with the [[Dome of the Rock]], the [[Gates of the Temple Mount]], and the [[Minarets of the Temple Mount|four minarets]]. ''al-Masjid al-Aqsa'' referred not only to the mosque, but to the entire sacred sanctuary, while ''Al-Jâmi‘ al-Aqṣá'' ({{lang-ar|ٱلْـجَـامِـع الْأَقْـصّى}}) referred to the specific site of the mosque.{{#tag:ref|According to historian Oleg Grabar, "It is only at a relatively late date that the Muslim holy space in Jerusalem came to be referred to as al-haram al-sharif (literally, the Noble Sacred Precinct or Restricted Enclosure, often translated as the Noble Sanctuary and usually simply referred to as the Haram). While the exact early history of this term is unclear, we know that it only became common in Ottoman times, when administrative order was established over all matters pertaining to the organization of the Muslim faith and the supervision of the holy places, for which the Ottomans took financial and architectural responsibility. Before the Ottomans, the space was usually called al-masjid al-aqsa (the Farthest Mosque), a term now reserved to the covered congregational space on the Haram, or masjid bayt al-maqdis (Mosque of the Holy City) or, even, like Mecca's sanctuary, ''al-masjid al-ḥarâm'',"&lt;ref&gt;Grabar 2000, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}} During the period of Ottoman rule (c. early 16th century to 1917) the wider compound began to also be referred to as ''al-Ḥaram ash-Sharīf'' ({{lang-ar|اَلْـحَـرَم الـشَّـرِيْـف}}, the Noble Sanctuary),&lt;ref&gt;Schieck, Robert (2008) in Geographical Dimension of Islamic Jerusalem, Cambridge Scholars Publishing; see also Omar, Abdallah (2009) al-Madkhal li-dirasat al-Masjid al-Aqsa al-Mubarak, Beirut: Dar al-Kotob al-Ilmiyaah; also by the same author the Atlas of Al-Aqsa Mosque (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jarrar85&gt;Jarrar 1998, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Al-Qibli vs. Al-Aqsa===
Al-Aqsa Mosque is also referred to as Al-Qibli Mosque on account of a particular building within it, the [[Al-Qibli Chapel]] (''al-Jami' al-Aqsa'' or ''al-Qibli'', or ''Masjid al-Jumah'' or ''al-Mughata'').&lt;ref name="Al-Habtoor 2007 Al-Aqsa Mosque"&gt;{{cite web |work=Al Habtoor Group |title=Al-Aqsa Mosque |publisher=''Al-Shindagah.com'' |year=2007 |url=http://www.alshindagah.com/shindagah75/alaqsa_mosque.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Mahdi Abdul Hadi]]: "Al-Aqsa Mosque, also referred to as Al-Haram Ash-Sharif (the Noble Sanctuary), comprises the entire area within the compound walls (a total area of 144,000 m2) - including all the mosques, prayer rooms, buildings, platforms and open courtyards located above or under the grounds - and exceeds 200 historical monuments pertaining to various Islamic eras. According to Islamic creed and jurisprudence, all these buildings and courtyards enjoy the same degree of sacredness since they are built on Al-Aqsa’s holy grounds. This sacredness is not exclusive to the physical structures allocated for prayer, like the Dome of the Rock or Al-Qibly Mosque (the mosque with the large silver dome)"&lt;br&gt;[http://www.tika.gov.tr/upload/2016/INGILIZCE%20SITE%20ESERLER/TANITIM%20BROŞÜRLERİ/PDF/Haram-Ash-sharief-Final-En_2013.pdf Mahdi Abdul Hadi] [[Palestinian Academic Society for the Study of International Affairs]]; Tim Marshall: "Many people believe that the mosque depicted is called the Al-Aqsa; however, a visit to one of Palestine's most eminent intellectuals, Mahdi F. Abdul Hadi, clarified the issue. Hadi is chairman of the Palestinian Academic Society for the Study of International Affairs, based in East Jerusalem. His offices are a treasure trove of old photographs, documents, and symbols. He was kind enough to spend several hours with me. He spread out maps of Jerusalem's Old City on a huge desk and homed in on the Al-Aqsa compound, which sits above the Western Wall. “The mosque in the Al- Aqsa [Brigades] flag is the Dome of the Rock. Everyone takes it for granted that it is the Al-Aqsa mosque, but no, the whole compound is Al-Aqsa, and on it are two mosques, the Qibla mosque and the Dome of the Rock, and on the flags of both Al-Aqsa Brigades and the Qassam Brigades, it is the Dome of the Rock shown,” he said." {{cite book|author=Tim Marshall|title=A Flag Worth Dying For: The Power and Politics of National Symbols|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ysYpDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA151|date=4 July 2017|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-5011-6833-8|pages=151–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Pre-construction===
The mosque is located on the [[Temple Mount]], referred to by Muslims today as the "Haram al-Sharif" ("Noble Sanctuary"), an enclosure expanded by King [[Herod the Great]] beginning in 20&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref name="Hartsock2014"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hartsock |first1=Ralph |date=Aug 27, 2014 |title=The temple of Jerusalem: past, present, and future |journal=Jewish Culture and History |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=199–201 |doi=10.1080/1462169X.2014.953832 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original sanctuary is believed to date to the time of [[Abraham in Islam]].&lt;ref name="Michigan C 1986"&gt;{{cite book |author=Michigan Consortium for Medieval and Early Modern Studies |editor1=Goss, V. P. |editor2=Bornstein, C. V. |title=The Meeting of Two Worlds: Cultural Exchange Between East and West During the Period of the Crusades |publisher=Medieval Institute Publications, Western Michigan University |volume=21 |page=208 |isbn=0918720583 |url=https://books.google.ae/books?id=p44kAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq |year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mosque resides on an artificial platform that is supported by arches constructed by Herod's engineers to overcome the difficult topographic conditions resulting from the southward expansion of the enclosure into the [[Tyropoeon Valley|Tyropoeon]] and [[Kidron Valley|Kidron]] valleys.&lt;ref name="Netzer2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ehud Netzer|title=Architecture of Herod, the Great Builder|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DbEFv2BBsCgC&amp;pg=PA161|date=October 2008|publisher=Baker Academic|isbn=978-0-8010-3612-5|pages=161–171}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the [[Second Temple]], the present site of the mosque was occupied by the [[Royal Stoa (Jerusalem)|Royal Stoa]], a [[basilica]] running the southern wall of the enclosure.&lt;ref name="Netzer2008"/&gt; The Royal Stoa was destroyed along with the Temple during the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|sacking of Jerusalem]] by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] in 70&amp;nbsp;CE.

It was once thought that [[Justinian|Emperor Justinian]]'s "[[Nea Ekklesia of the Theotokos]]", or the New Church of the God-Bearer, dedicated to the [[Theotokos|God-bearing]] [[Virgin Mary]], consecrated in 543 and commonly known as the Nea Church, was situated where al-Aqsa Mosque was later constructed. However, remains identified as those of the Nea Church were uncovered in the south part of the [[Jewish Quarter (Jerusalem)|Jewish Quarter]] in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nahman Avigad |title=A Building Inscription of the Emperor Justinian and the Nea in Jerusalem |journal=Israel Exploration Journal |volume=27 |issue=2/3 |year=1977 |pages=145–151 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Robert Schick |chapter=Byzantine Jerusalem |title=Jerusalem before Islam |publisher=Archaeopress |editor1=Zeidan Kafafi |editor2=Robert Schick |page=175 |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysis of the wooden beams and panels removed from the mosque during renovations in the 1930s shows they are made from [[Lebanon Cedar|Cedar of Lebanon]] and [[cypress]]. Radiocarbon dating indicates a large range of ages, some as old as 9th-century BCE, showing that some of the wood had previously been used in older buildings.&lt;ref&gt;N. Liphschitz, G. Biger, G. Bonani and W. Wolfli, Comparative Dating Methods: Botanical Identification and &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C Dating of Carved Panels and Beams from the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, ''Journal of Archaeological Science'', (1997) 24, 1045–1050.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, it was reported that [[Robert Hamilton (archaeologist)|Robert Hamilton]], an archaeologist who worked on the Temple Mount after the [[1927 Jericho earthquake]], had discovered remains under al-Aqsa mosque that he did not publish in his book on the excavations. These included a mosaic like those used in Byzantine churches, and a Jewish [[mikveh]] from the [[Second Temple period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_article.php?id=4890 | title=Second Temple-era mikveh discovered under Al-Aqsa mosque | publisher=Israel Hayom | accessdate=June 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=175342 | title=In honor of Jerusalem Day, MKs get to dig into past | publisher=Jerusalem Post | accessdate=December 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Construction by the Umayyads===

The current construction of the al-Aqsa Mosque is dated to the early Umayyad period of rule in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. Architectural historian [[K. A. C. Creswell]], referring to a testimony by [[Arculf]], a [[Gaul|Gallic]] monk, during his pilgrimage to Palestine in 679–82, notes the possibility that the second [[caliph]] of the [[Rashidun Caliphate]], [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]], erected a primitive quadrangular building for a capacity of 3,000 worshipers somewhere on the Haram ash-Sharif. However, Arculf visited Palestine during the reign of [[Mu'awiyah I]], and it is possible that Mu'awiyah ordered the construction, not Umar. This latter claim is explicitly supported by the early Muslim scholar al-Muthahhar bin Tahir.&lt;ref name="Elad"&gt;Elad, Amikam. (1995). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=CDz_yctbQVgC&amp;pg=PA29 Medieval Jerusalem and Islamic Worship Holy Places, Ceremonies, Pilgrimage]'' BRILL, pp. 29–43. {{ISBN|90-04-10010-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to several Muslim scholars, including [[Mujir al-Din al-'Ulaymi|Mujir ad-Din]], [[al-Suyuti]], and [[al-Muqaddasi]], the mosque was reconstructed and expanded by the [[caliph]] Abd al-Malik in 690 along with the [[Dome of the Rock]].&lt;ref name="Elad"/&gt;&lt;ref name="le Strange"&gt;le Strange, Guy. (1890). ''Palestine under the Moslems'', pp. 80–98.&lt;/ref&gt; Guy le Strange claims that Abd al-Malik used materials from the destroyed Church of Our Lady to build the mosque and points to possible evidence that substructures on the southeast corners of the mosque are remains of the church.&lt;ref name="le Strange"/&gt; In planning his magnificent project on the Temple
Mount, which in effect would turn the entire complex into the Haram al-Sharif ("the Noble Sanctuary"), Abd al-Malik wanted to replace the slipshod structure described by Arculf with a more sheltered structure enclosing the ''[[qibla]]'' ("direction"), a necessary element in his grand scheme. However, the entire Haram al-Sharif was meant to represent a mosque. How much he modified the aspect of the earlier building is unknown, but the length of the new building is indicated by the existence of traces of a bridge leading from the Umayyad palace just south of the western part of the complex. The bridge would have spanned the street running just outside the southern wall of the Haram al-Sharif to give direct access to the mosque. Direct access from palace to mosque was a well-known feature in the Umayyad period, as evidenced at various early sites. Abd al-Malik shifted the central axis of the mosque some {{convert|40|m|ft|sp=us}} westward, in accord with his overall plan for the Haram al-Sharif. The earlier axis is represented in the structure by the niche still known as the "mihrab of 'Umar." In placing emphasis on the [[Dome of the Rock]], Abd al-Malik had his architects align his new al-Aqsa Mosque according to the position of the [[Foundation Stone|Rock]], thus shifting the main north–south axis of the Noble Sanctuary, a line running through the [[Dome of the Chain]] and the Mihrab of Umar.&lt;ref name="GandA"&gt;Grafman and Ayalon, 1998, [https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20071225141527/http://www.archnet.org/library/pubdownloader/pdf/9702/doc/DPC1569.pdf pp. 1–15].&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, Creswell, while referring to the Aphrodito Papyri, claims that Abd al-Malik's son, [[al-Walid I]], reconstructed the Aqsa Mosque over a period of six months to a year, using workers from [[Damascus]]. Most scholars agree that the mosque's reconstruction was started by Abd al-Malik, but that al-Walid oversaw its completion. In 713–14, a series of earthquakes ravaged Jerusalem, destroying the eastern section of the mosque, which was subsequently rebuilt during al-Walid's rule. In order to finance its reconstruction, al-Walid had gold from the dome of the Rock minted to use as money to purchase the material.&lt;ref name="Elad"/&gt; The Umayyad-built al-Aqsa Mosque most likely measured 112 x 39 meters.&lt;ref name="GandA"/&gt;

===Earthquakes and reconstructions===
In 746, the al-Aqsa Mosque was damaged in an earthquake, four years before [[as-Saffah]] overthrew the Umayyads and established the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. The second Abbasid caliph [[Abu Ja'far al-Mansur]] declared his intent to repair the mosque in 753, and he had the gold and silver plaques that covered the gates of the mosque removed and turned into [[dinar]]s and [[dirham]]s to finance the reconstruction which ended in 771. A second earthquake damaged most of al-Mansur's repairs, excluding those made in the southern portion in 774.&lt;ref name="le Strange"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nusseibeh"/&gt; In 780, His successor Muhammad [[al-Mahdi]] had it rebuilt, but curtailed its length and increased its breadth.&lt;ref name="le Strange"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ADL"/&gt; Al-Mahdi's renovation is the first known to have written records describing it.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffers, 2004, pp. 95–96.&lt;/ref&gt; In 985, Jerusalem-born [[Arab]] geographer [[al-Muqaddasi]] recorded that the renovated mosque had "fifteen naves and fifteen gates".&lt;ref name="Nusseibeh"/&gt;

[[File:Saladin Minbar-Aqsa.JPG|thumb|right|The doors of the Saladin Minbar, early 1900s. The ''[[minbar]]'' was built on [[Nur ad-Din Zangi|Nur al-Din]]'s orders, but installed by Saladin]]
In 1033, there was another earthquake, severely damaging the mosque. The [[Fatimid]] caliph [[Ali az-Zahir]] rebuilt and completely renovated the mosque between 1034 and 1036. The number of naves was drastically reduced from 15 to seven.&lt;ref name="Nusseibeh"/&gt; Az-Zahir built the four arcades of the central hall and aisle, which presently serve as the foundation of the mosque. The central aisle was double the width of the other aisles and had a large gable roof upon which the dome—made of wood—was constructed.&lt;ref name="Elad"/&gt; Persian geographer, [[Nasir Khusraw]] describes the Aqsa Mosque during a visit in 1047:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Haram Area (Noble Sanctuary) lies in the eastern part of the [[Jerusalem|city]]; and through the [[bazaar]] of this (quarter) you enter the Area by a great and beautiful gateway ([[Dargah]])... After passing this gateway, you have on the right two great colonnades ([[Riwaq (arcade)|Riwaq]]), each of which has nine-and-twenty marble pillars, whose capitals and bases are of colored marbles, and the joints are set in lead. Above the pillars rise arches, that are constructed, of masonry, without mortar or cement, and each arch is constructed of no more than five or six blocks of stone. These colonnades lead down to near the [[Maqsurah]] (enclosure).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepages.luc.edu/~avande1/jerusalem/sources/nasir.htm |title=The travels of Nasir-i-Khusrau to Jerusalem, 1047 C.E |publisher=Homepages.luc.edu |accessdate=13 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719231956/http://homepages.luc.edu/~avande1/jerusalem/sources/nasir.htm |archivedate=19 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jerusalem was captured by the [[Crusades|Crusader]]s in 1099, during the [[First Crusade]]. They named the mosque "Solomon's Temple", distinguishing it from the Dome of the Rock, which they named ''Templum Domini'' (Temple of God). While the Dome of the Rock was turned into a Christian church under the care of the [[Augustinians]],&lt;ref name="Pringle403"&gt;Pringle, 1993, p. 403.&lt;/ref&gt; the al-Aqsa Mosque was used as a royal palace and also as a stable for horses. In 1119, it was transformed into the headquarters of the [[Knights Templar|Templar Knights]]. During this period, the mosque underwent some structural changes, including the expansion of its northern porch, and the addition of an [[apse]] and a dividing wall. A new cloister and church were also built at the site, along with various other structures.&lt;ref&gt;Boas, 2001, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; The Templars constructed vaulted western and eastern annexes to the building; the western currently serves as the women's mosque and the eastern as the [[Islamic Museum]].&lt;ref name="Nusseibeh"/&gt;

After the [[Ayyubid]]s under the leadership of Saladin reconquered Jerusalem following the [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|siege of 1187]], several repairs and renovations were undertaken at al-Aqsa Mosque. In order to prepare the mosque for [[Friday prayer]]s, within a week of his capture of Jerusalem Saladin had the toilets and grain stores installed by the Crusaders at al-Aqsa removed, the floors covered with precious carpets, and its interior scented with rosewater and incense.&lt;ref&gt;Hancock, Lee.

In 1345, the [[Mamluk]]s under al-Kamil Shaban added two naves and two gates to the mosque's eastern side.&lt;ref name="Nusseibeh"/&gt;

After the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]s assumed power in 1517, they did not undertake any major renovations or repairs to the mosque itself, but they did to the Noble Sanctuary as a whole. This included the building of the [[Fountain of Qasim Pasha]] (1527), the restoration of the [[Pool of Raranj]], and the building of three free-standing domes—the most notable being the [[Dome of the Prophet]] built in 1538. All construction was ordered by the Ottoman governors of Jerusalem and not the [[List of Ottoman Sultans|sultan]]s themselves.&lt;ref name="AG07"&gt;[http://www.aqsa.org.uk/MULTIMEDIA/AlAqsaGuide/tabid/82/language/en-GB/Default.aspx Al-Aqsa Guide] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006175930/http://www.aqsa.org.uk/MULTIMEDIA/AlAqsaGuide/tabid/82/language/en-GB/Default.aspx |date=6 October 2008 }} Friends of Al-Aqsa 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The sultans did make additions to existing minarets, however.&lt;ref name="AG07"/&gt; In 1816, the mosque was restored by Governor [[Sulayman Pasha al-Adil]] after having been in a dilapidated state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pappe|first1=Ilan|title=The Rise and Fall of a Palestinian Dynasty: The Huyaynis 1700 – 1948|date=2012|publisher=Saqi Books|isbn=978-0-86356-801-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WzshBQAAQBAJ|chapter=Chapter 2: In the Shadow of Acre and Cairo: The Third Generation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Al aqsa moschee 2.jpg|thumb|right|The dome of the mosque in 1982. It was made of aluminum (and looked like silver), but replaced with its original lead plating in 1983.]]

The first renovation in the 20th&amp;nbsp;century occurred in 1922, when the [[Supreme Muslim Council]] under [[Amin al-Husayni]] (the [[Grand Mufti of Jerusalem]]) commissioned [[Turkey|Turkish]] architect [[Mimar Kemaleddin Bey|Ahmet Kemalettin Bey]] to restore al-Aqsa Mosque and the monuments in its precincts. The council also commissioned [[Great Britain|British]] architects, [[Egypt]]ian engineering experts and local officials to contribute to and oversee the repairs and additions which were carried out in 1924–25 by Kemalettin. The renovations included reinforcing the mosque's ancient Umayyad foundations, rectifying the interior columns, replacing the beams, erecting a [[scaffolding]], conserving the [[arch]]es and drum of the main dome's interior, rebuilding the southern wall, and replacing timber in the central nave with a slab of concrete. The renovations also revealed Fatimid-era mosaics and inscriptions on the interior arches that had been covered with [[plasterwork]]. The arches were decorated with gold and green-tinted [[gypsum]] and their timber tie beams were replaced with [[brass]]. A quarter of the stained glass windows also were carefully renewed so as to preserve their original Abbasid and Fatimid designs.&lt;ref name="Yuvaz149-153"&gt;Yuvaz, 1996, pp.&amp;nbsp;149–153.&lt;/ref&gt; Severe damage was caused by the [[Galilee earthquake of 1837|1837]] and [[1927 Jericho earthquake|1927]] earthquakes, but the mosque was repaired in 1938 and 1942.&lt;ref name="Nusseibeh"/&gt;

On July 20, 1951, [[King Abdullah I]] was shot three times by a Palestinian gunman as he entered the mosque, killing him. His grandson [[King Hussein of Jordan|Prince Hussein]], was at his side and was also hit, though a medal he was wearing on his chest deflected the bullet.

On 21&amp;nbsp;August&amp;nbsp;1969, a fire was  started by a visitor from Australia named [[Denis Michael Rohan]]. Rohan was a member of an [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] [[Christian]] sect known as the [[Worldwide Church of God]].&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Burning of Al-Aqsa |work=Time Magazine |page=1 |date=29 August 1969 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,901289,00.html?promoid=googlep |accessdate=1 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He hoped that by burning down al-Aqsa Mosque he would hasten the [[Second Coming]] of Jesus, making way for the rebuilding of the Jewish Temple on the Temple Mount.

In the 1980s, Ben Shoshan and [[Yehuda Etzion]], both members of the [[Gush Emunim Underground]], plotted to blow up the al-Aqsa mosque and the [[Dome of the Rock]]. Etzion believed that blowing up the two mosques would cause a spiritual awakening in Israel, and would solve all the problems of the Jewish people. They also hoped the [[Third Temple|Third Temple of Jerusalem]] would be built on the location of the mosque.&lt;ref&gt;Dumper, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sprinzak 2001, pp. 198–199.&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 January&amp;nbsp;1988, during the [[First Intifada]], [[Israeli troops]] fired [[rubber bullet]]s and [[tear gas]] at protesters outside the mosque, wounding 40 worshipers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/2ee9468747556b2d85256cf60060d2a6/03a0ba144d71e526852573700066e774 OpenDocument Letter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628180644/http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/2ee9468747556b2d85256cf60060d2a6/03a0ba144d71e526852573700066e774 |date=28 June 2011 }} Dated 18 January 1988 from the Permanent Observer for the Palestine Liberation Organization to the United Nations Office at Geneva Addressed to the Under-Secretary-General for Human Rights Ramlawi, Nabil.

On 28&amp;nbsp;September&amp;nbsp;2000, then-opposition leader of Israel [[Ariel Sharon]] and members of the [[Likud Party]], along with 1,000 armed guards, visited the al-Aqsa compound; a large group of Palestinians went to protest the visit. After Sharon and the Likud Party members left, a demonstration erupted and Palestinians on the grounds of the [[Haram al-Sharif]] began [[Palestinian stone throwing|throwing stones]] and other projectiles at Israeli riot police. Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at the crowd, injuring 24 people. The visit sparked a five-year uprising by the Palestinians, commonly referred to as the [[al-Aqsa Intifada]], though some commentators, citing subsequent speeches by PA officials, particularly Imad Falouji and Arafat himself, claim that the Intifada had been planned months in advance, as early as July upon [[Yasser Arafat]]'s return from Camp David talks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Provocative' mosque visit sparks riots |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC MMVIII |date=28 September 2000 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/28/newsid_3687000/3687762.stm |accessdate=1 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=toameh&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=29 March 2006|url=http://www.mafhoum.com/press3/111P55.htm|title=How the war began|author=Khaled Abu Toameh| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060328023742/http://www.mafhoum.com/press3/111P55.htm| archivedate= 28 March 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=atlantic&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/prem/200509/samuels|date=September 2005|publisher=[[The Atlantic Monthly]] Online|title=In a Ruined Country}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29&amp;nbsp;September, the Israeli government deployed 2,000 riot police to the mosque.

===Dome===
[[File:Israel-2007-Jerusalem-Temple Mount-Al-Aqsa Mosque 01.jpg|thumb|right|The silver-colored dome consists of lead sheeting]]

Nothing remains of the original dome built by Abd al-Malik. The present-day dome was built by az-Zahir and consists of wood plated with lead [[enamelwork]].&lt;ref name="Elad"/&gt; In 1969, the dome was reconstructed in concrete and covered with [[anodized aluminum]], instead of the original ribbed lead enamel work sheeting. In 1983, the aluminum outer covering was replaced with lead to match the original design by az-Zahir.&lt;ref name="Archnet"&gt;[http://www.archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.jsp?site_id=475 Al-Aqsa Mosque Restoration] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103003046/http://www.archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.jsp?site_id=475 |date=3 January 2009 }} Archnet Digital Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beneath the dome is the '''Al-Qibli Chapel''' ({{lang-ar|المصلى القبلي}} ''al-Musalla al-Qibli''); also known as '''al-Jami' al-Qibli''' {{lang-ar|الجامع القِبْلي }}, a Muslim prayer hall, located in the southern part of the mosque.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.visitmasjidalaqsa.com/what-is-masjid-al-aqsa/&lt;/ref&gt; It was built by the Rashidun caliph [[Umar ibn Al-Khattab]] in 637 CE.

Al-Aqsa's dome is one of the few domes to be built in front of the ''mihrab'' during the Umayyad and Abbasid periods, the others being the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus (715) and the [[Great Mosque of Sousse]] (850).&lt;ref&gt;Necipogulu, 1998, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The interior of the dome is painted with 14th-century-era decorations. During the 1969 burning, the paintings were assumed to be irreparably lost, but were completely reconstructed using the ''[[Cesare Brandi|trateggio]]'' technique, a method that uses fine vertical lines to distinguish reconstructed areas from original ones.&lt;ref name="Archnet"/&gt;

===Facade and porch===
[[File:Al-Aqsa05.JPG|thumb|The facade of the mosque. It was constructed by the [[Fatimid]]s, then expanded by the [[Crusades|Crusader]]s, the [[Ayyubid]]s and the Mamluks]]

The facade of the mosque was built in 1065 CE on the instructions of the Fatimid caliph [[Ma'ad al-Mustansir Billah|al-Mustansir Billah]]. It was crowned with a balustrade consisting of arcades and small columns. The Crusaders damaged the facade, but it was restored and renovated by the Ayyubids.

The remaining four rows are better proportioned. The capitals of the columns are of four different kinds: those in the central aisle are heavy and primitively designed, while those under the dome are of the [[Corinthian order]],&lt;ref name="LHL"/&gt; and made from Italian white marble. The capitals in the eastern aisle are of a heavy basket-shaped design and those east and west of the dome are also basket-shaped, but smaller and better proportioned. The columns and piers are connected by an architectural rave, which consists of beams of roughly squared timber enclosed in a wooden casing.&lt;ref name="LHL"&gt;[http://www.lifeintheholyland.com/al_aqsa_mosque.htm Al-Aqsa Mosque] Life in the Holy Land.&lt;/ref&gt;

A great portion of the mosque is covered with [[whitewash]], but the drum of the dome and the walls immediately beneath it are decorated with [[mosaic]]s and marble. Some paintings by an Italian artist were introduced when repairs were undertaken at the mosque after an earthquake ravaged the mosque in 1927.&lt;ref name="LHL"/&gt; The ceiling of the mosque was painted with funding by King [[Farouk of Egypt]].&lt;ref name="SD"/&gt;

The ''[[minbar]]'' ("[[pulpit]]") of the mosque was built by a craftsman named Akhtarini from [[Aleppo]] on the orders of the Zengid sultan [[Nur ad-Din Zangi|Nur ad-Din]]. It was intended to be a gift for the mosque when Nur ad-Din would capture Jerusalem from the Crusaders and took six years to build (1168–74). Nur ad-Din died and the Crusaders still controlled Jerusalem, but in 1187, Saladin captured the city and the ''minbar'' was installed. The structure was made of ivory and carefully crafted wood. [[Arabic calligraphy]], geometrical and floral designs were inscribed in the woodwork.&lt;ref name="Oweis"&gt;Oweis, Fayeq S.

===Ablution fountain===
[[File:TM washing.JPG|right|thumb|The mosque's "Al-Kas" ablution fountain]]

The mosque's main [[Ritual purification|ablution]] fountain, known as ''al-Kas'' ("the Cup"), is located north of the mosque between it and the Dome of the Rock. It is used by worshipers to perform ''[[wudu]]'', a ritual washing of the hands, arms, legs, feet, and face before entry into the mosque. It was first built in 709 by the Umayyads, but in 1327–28 Governor Tankiz enlarged it to accommodate more worshipers. Although originally supplied with water from [[Solomon's Pools]] near [[Bethlehem]], it currently receives water from pipes connected to Jerusalem's water supply.&lt;ref&gt;Dolphin, Lambert. [http://www.templemount.org/visittemp.html The Temple Esplanade].&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th-century, al-Kas was provided taps and stone seating.&lt;ref&gt;Gonen, 2003, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Fountain of Qasim Pasha]], built by the Ottomans in 1526 and located north of the mosque on the platform of the Dome of the Rock, was used by worshipers for ablution and for drinking until the 1940s. Today, it stands as a monumental structure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.jsp?site_id=5556 Qasim Pasha Sabil] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525060601/http://archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.jsp?site_id=5556 |date=25 May 2011 }}.

==Religious significance in Islam==
In Islam, the term "al-Aqsa Mosque" refers to the entire Noble Sanctuary. The mosque is believed to be the second house of prayer constructed after the [[Masjid al-Haram]] in [[Mecca]]. Post-Rashidun-era Islamic scholars traditionally identified the mosque as the site referred to in the ''[[sura]]'' (Quranic chapter) [[al-Isra]] ("the Night Journey"). This specific verse in the Quran cemented the significant religious importance of al-Aqsa in Islam.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} The specific passage reads "Praise be to Him who made His servant journey in the night from the sacred sanctuary to the remotest sanctuary."  In early Islam the story of Muhammad's ascension from Al-Aqsa Mosque—'"the farthest place of prayer" (al masjid al aqsa) was understood as relating to the Jewish [[Temple in Jerusalem]]. There was a significant Muslims group disputed this connection, identifying "the farthest place of prayer" as a reference to a site in the heavens.&lt;ref name="Colby2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=[https://casprofile.uoregon.edu/sites/casprofile2.uoregon.edu/files/cv/cv-1819.pdf Frederick S.

===Isra and Mi'raj===
According to the Quran and Islamic traditions, Al-Aqsa Mosque is the place from which Muhammad went on a [[Isra and Mi'raj|night journey]] (''al-isra'') during which he rode on [[Buraq]], who took him from Mecca to al-Aqsa.&lt;ref name=enc&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Richard C.

===First qibla===
[[Image:Aqsa 2.jpg|thumb|Interior view of the mosque showing the ''[[mihrab]]'', indicating the ''[[qibla]]h'']]

The historical significance of the al-Aqsa Mosque in Islam is further emphasized by the fact that Muslims turned towards al-Aqsa when they prayed for a period of 16 or 17 months after [[Hijra (Islam)|migration]] to [[Medina]] in 624; it thus became the ''[[qibla]]'' ("direction") that Muslims faced for prayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Buchanan|first=Allen |authorlink=Allen Buchanan |year=2004 |title=States, Nations, and Borders: The Ethics of Making Boundaries |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-52575-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bntCSupRlO4C&amp;pg=PA192}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad later prayed towards the [[Kaaba]] in [[Mecca]] after receiving a revelation during a prayer session {{Quran-usc-range|2|142|end=151}}&lt;ref&gt;Shah, 2008, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Masjid al-Qiblatayn]].&lt;ref&gt;Raby, 2004, p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patel, 2006, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''qibla'' was relocated to the Kaaba where Muslims have been directed to pray ever since.&lt;ref&gt;Asali, 1990, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

The altering of the ''qibla'' was precisely the reason the [[Rashidun]] caliph Umar, despite identifying the mosque which Muhammad used to ascend to [[Heaven]] upon his arrival at the Noble Sanctuary in 638, neither prayed facing it nor built any structure upon it. This was because the significance of that particular spot on the Noble Sanctuary was superseded in [[Islamic jurisprudence]] by the Kaaba in Mecca after the change of the ''qibla'' towards that site.&lt;ref name="Mosaad"/&gt;

According to early Quranic interpreters and what is generally accepted as Islamic tradition, in 638 CE Umar, upon entering a conquered Jerusalem, consulted with [[Ka'ab al-Ahbar]]—a Jewish convert to Islam who came with him from [[Medina]]—as to where the best spot would be to build a mosque. Al-Ahbar suggested to him that it should be behind the Rock "...&amp;nbsp;so that all of Jerusalem would be before you." Umar replied, "You correspond to Judaism!" Immediately after this conversation, Umar began to clean up the site—which was filled with trash and debris—with his cloak, and other Muslim followers imitated him until the site was clean. Umar then prayed at the spot where it was believed that Muhammad had prayed before his night journey, reciting the Quranic ''sura'' ''[[Sad (sura)|Sad]]''.&lt;ref name="Mosaad"&gt;Mosaad, Mohamed. [http://www.godsholymountain.org/papers/bayt.pdf Bayt al-Maqdis: An Islamic Perspective] pp. 3–8&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, according to this tradition, Umar thereby reconsecrated the site as a mosque.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mustaqim.co.uk/ipb-archive/alaqsa/chapone.htm The Furthest Mosque, The History of Al – Aqsa Mosque From Earliest Times] Mustaqim Islamic Art &amp; Literature. 5 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the holiness of Noble Sanctuary itself—being a place where [[David]] and [[Solomon]] had prayed—Umar constructed a small prayer house in the southern corner of its platform, taking care to avoid allowing the Rock to come between the mosque and the direction of Kaaba so that Muslims would face only Mecca when they prayed.&lt;ref name="Mosaad"/&gt;

Jerusalem is recognized as a sacred site in Islam. Though the Quran does not mention Jerusalem by name, it has been understood by Islamic scholars since the earliest times that many passages in the Quran refer to Jerusalem.&lt;ref name="Khatib"&gt;{{cite journal|last=el-Khatib |first=Abdallah |date=1 May 2001 |title=Jerusalem in the Qur'ān |journal=British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=25–53 |doi=10.1080/13530190120034549 |url=http://taylorandfrancis.metapress.com/openurl.asp?genre=article&amp;issn=1353-0194&amp;volume=28&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=25 |accessdate=17 November 2006 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jerusalem is also mentioned many times in the [[hadith]]. Some academics attribute the holiness of Jerusalem to the rise and expansion of a certain type of literary genre, known as ''al-Fadhail'' or history of cities. The Fadhail of Jerusalem inspired Muslims, especially during the Umayyad period, to embellish the sanctity of the city beyond its status in the holy texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

All of these inspired Muslims to ''embellish the sanctity of the city beyond its status in the holy texts''. The greatest source of information for al-Fadhail was the hadith, the Prophet's traditions, which were beginning to be quoted extensively in the last third of the first Muslim century (the seventh century of the Christian era). The traditions were used to enumerate the values of visiting the city and al-Aqsa Mosque. Circulating widely during the Umayyad period, these traditions were often a reflection of the ''Umayyad policy of enhancing the religious status of Jerusalem''.--&gt;

| quote = &lt;!--After the prophet died in June 632 a series of successors, or caliphs, assumed authority as Islam's leaders. Between 661 and 750 the Umayyad Dynasty held the Caliphate and ruled from Damascus. ''During the time they ruled, on account of various internal and external pressures, the Umayyads exerted enormous effort to elevate Jerusalem's status'', perhaps even to the level of Mecca ... the Palestinian historian A.L. Tibawi writes, that building an actual Al Aqsa Mosque "gave reality to the figurative name used in the Koran ..." As Pipes points out, moreover, "it had the hugely important effect of giving Jerusalem a place in the Koran post hoc which naturally imbued the city with a higher status in Islam." Which is another way of saying, before the Umayyads built Dome of the Rock and Al Aksa, Jerusalem had no status at all in Islam. Israeli scholar Izhak Hasson says: "construction of the Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa mosque, the rituals instituted by the Umayyads on the Noble Sanctuary and the dissemination of Islamic-oriented Traditions regarding sanctity of the site, ''all point to the political motives which underlay the glorification of Jerusalem among the Muslims''." In other words the sanctification of Jerusalem in Islam is based on the Umayyad building program.--&gt;

Later medieval scripts, as well as modern-day political tracts, tend to classify al-Aqsa Mosque as the third holiest site in Islam.&lt;ref name=Webster&gt;{{cite book |first=Wendy |last=Doninger |title=Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions

==Current situations==

===Administration===
The Waqf Ministry of Jordan held control of the al-Aqsa Mosque until the 1967 [[Six-Day War]]. After Israel's victory in that war, Israel transferred the control of the mosque and the northern Noble Sanctuary to the Islamic ''waqf'' trust, who are independent of the Israeli government. However, [[Israeli Security Forces]] are permitted to patrol and conduct searches within the perimeter of the mosque. After the 1969 arson attack, the ''waqf'' employed architects, technicians and craftsmen in a committee that carry out regular maintenance operations. The [[Islamic Movement (Israel)|Islamic Movement]] in Israel and the ''waqf'' have attempted to increase Muslim control of the Temple Mount as a way of countering Israeli policies and the escalating presence of Israeli security forces around the site since the [[Second Intifada]]. Some activities included refurbishing abandoned structures and renovating.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20000525002731/http://www.passia.org/jerusalem/publications/khaled_khatib_Conservation_Jerusalem/chapter1.htm Social Structure and Geography] Palestinian Academic Society for the Study of International Affairs.&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel claims sovereignty over the mosque along with all of the Temple Mount (Noble Sanctuary), but [[Palestinians]] hold the custodianship of the site through the Islamic ''waqf''.

==Biography==
Spang is an enrolled member of the Tsitsistas/Suhtai (Northern Cheyenne) Nation in southeastern Montana and was born at the Crow-Northern Cheyenne Indian Hospital on the Crow Reservation located in Crow Agency, Montana in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;Bently Spang&lt;/ref&gt; Spang grew up both on and off the [[Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation]], living in places such as [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]], [[Alaska]] and [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]] &lt;ref&gt;The artist&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref name="Memory and Vision"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hansen |first=Emma I. |title=Memory and Vision: Arts, Cultures, and Lives of Plains Indian People |year=2007 |publisher=Buffalo Bill Historical Center |location=Cody, Wyoming |isbn=978-0-295-98580-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|300}} He graduated from [[Montana State University Billings]] and earned a [[Master of Fine Arts]] degree at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=American Indian Housing Initiative Will Link Tribal and Academic Communities |url=https://news.cals.wisc.edu/2005/05/18/american-indian-housing-initiative-will-link-tribal-and-academic-communities/ |work=College of Agricultural and Life Sciences |publisher=University of Wisconsin-Madison |date=May 18, 2005 |accessdate=August 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bozeman"&gt;{{cite news |last=Rod |first=Luann |title=Bently Spang examines culture with humor in Emerson installation |url=https://www.bozemandailychronicle.com/arts_and_entertainment/art/article_43bc7f70-4b65-11e0-8265-001cc4c002e0.html |accessdate=December 19, 2012 |newspaper=[[Bozeman Daily Chronicle]] |date=August 13, 2018 |location=Bozeman, Montana}}&lt;/ref&gt; He taught at the [[School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]] from 2007 to 2009 as a full-time Visiting Faculty Member in Video.&lt;ref name="SMFA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smfa.edu/facultymodule/view/id/281/ |title=Bently Spang |publisher=SMFA Boston |accessdate=March 25, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103131053/http://www.smfa.edu/facultymodule/view/id/281/ |archivedate=November 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Wyoming]]'s American Indian Study Program named Spang its "Eminent Artist in Residence" for the spring semester of 2014. During this time he taught a class on Native American art and held exhibitions at the university's art museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Spang is UW American Indian Studies Program Eminent Artist in Residence |url=http://www.uwyo.edu/uw/news/2014/01/spang-is-uw-american-indian-studies-program-eminent-artist-in-residence.html |publisher=University of Wyoming |date=January 7, 2014 |accessdate=August 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spang now works as an independent artist and has a studio in [[Billings, Montana|Billings]], Montana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=bently spang |url=https://www.artmuseum.org/exhibition/bently-spang/ |website=ArtMuseum.org |publisher=Yellowstone Art Museum |accessdate=August 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art works==
Spang's early work included mixed media sculptures, often made out of metal, and installations. His later work focused on incorporating digital technologies such as film and photography.&lt;ref name="pop culture"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hoffman |first=Elizabeth Delaney |title=American Indians and Popular Culture, Volume 1 |year=2012 |publisher=[[Praeger Publishers|Praeger]] |isbn=978-0313379901 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v_9w4eXZNg4C&amp;pg=RA1-PA201&amp;lpg=RA1-PA201#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |chapter=Leap of Faith |page=201 |location=Santa Barbara, California}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spang drew inspiration for his work in mixed media from how his Cheyenne ancestors incorporated European materials into their artwork; he has stated, "There was this fearlessness about mediums that we don't really have today."&lt;ref name="bozeman"/&gt; Spang considers his art autobiographical, addressing his cultural identity as a Cheyenne living in a modern society and bridging the gap between these two worlds.&lt;ref name="Memory and Vision"/&gt;{{rp|288–289}} Spang often adds humor to his works to help present these themes to his audience.&lt;ref name="bozeman"/&gt;

For example, in his sculpture ''Pevah'' (meaning "good" in Cheyenne), Spang used stone and wood to signify the Cheyenne part of him, and he used aluminum to signify the contemporary world. In constructing the project, he explained, "The metal binds the stone, the wood binds them both. I am bound by my culture; we are still here after all."&lt;ref name="Memory and Vision"/&gt;{{rp|295}} Another one of Spang's sculptures is inspired by the Cheyenne tradition of adorning the fringe of war shirts with the hairs from the warrior's community. The fringe on Spang's ''War Shirt #1'' is likewise composed of the photographic negatives of people he knows to show that he draws his strength from the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Patricia A. |first=Johnston |title=Seeing High &amp; Low: Representing Social Conflict in American Visual Culture |year=2006 |publisher=University of California |location=Berkeley, CA |isbn=9780520241886 |pages=138–9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zpAhjXHBm3kC&amp;pg=PA138#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spang collaborated with techno DJ [[Bert Benally]] to create the ''Techno Pow Wow'', a mix of [[rave]] dance culture with into a traditional [[pow wow]].&lt;ref name="Creative Capital overview"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.creative-capital.org/index.php?url=projects/view/184 |title=Bently Spang: Techno Powwow: Overview |location=New York, NY |work=Creative Capital |accessdate=August 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This piece was inspired by the 1990s [[electronic music]] movement. Spang claimed that the energy and effortless dancing reminded him of the pow wows at the reservation. Spang performed as part of this piece as "The Blue Guy", the [[tribal chief]] figure of the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Larsen |first=Jessica Hunter |journal=La Tertulia |volume=23 |issue=3 |title=Tekcno Powwow: Ancient Rhythms for the I-Pod Generation |url=https://digitalccbeta.coloradocollege.edu/pid/coccc:1371/datastream/OBJ |format=PDF |date=Fall 2007 |access-date=August 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the installation's mix of cultural music and dance, Spang hoped to showcase the similarities between Native American and modern culture.&lt;ref name="Creative Capital"/&gt; In his ''New American Relics: Redux 2'' (2009), Spang satirized museums and anthropologists' depiction of indigenous America as a "lost culture" using irony. He designed a futuristic museum exhibit for the "vit-heut" (meaning "white man" in Northern Cheyenne) with "artifacts" molded from the plastic encasings of ordinary modern objects.&lt;ref name="iaia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bozeman"/&gt;

From February to March 2014, Spang presented his "Bently Spang: On Fire" exhibition at the [[University of Wyoming Art Museum]], which told the story of the 2012 Ash Creek wildfire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.uwyo.edu/uw/news/2014/01/eminent-artist-in-residence-bently-spang-public-programs-scheduled-at-uw.html |title=Eminent Artist in Residence Bently Spang Public Programs Scheduled at UW |publisher=University of Wyoming |date=January 31, 2014 |accessdate=August 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2017, Spang presented the video installation "War Shirt #6 – Waterways" as part of his Modern Warrior Series, at the Dry Creek Schoolhouse in [[Belgrade, Montana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Webb |first=Jaci |url=https://billingsgazette.com/entertainment/arts-and-theatre/waterworks-series-features-celebrated-northern-cheyenne-artist-bently-spang/article_197489f5-ca20-5e3d-84a4-f8b99614e670.html |title=WaterWorks series features celebrated Northern Cheyenne artist Bently Spang |work=Billings Gazette |date=July 20, 2017 |accessdate=August 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ragain |first=Melissa |url=https://hyperallergic.com/455655/mountain-time-arts-waterworks-water-scarcity-montana/ |title=Artists Reflect on Water Scarcity in a Gentrifying Montana Town |date=August 17, 2018 |work=Hyperallergic |accessdate=August 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The installation was a series of moving images within a steel war shirt conveying Spang's relationship with water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gianelli |first=Sarah |url=http://www.explorebigsky.com/waterworks-flows-to-the-wetlands |title='WaterWorks' flows to the wetlands |work=Explore Big Sky |date=July 19, 2017 |accessdate=January 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and recognition==
In 2003, Spang won an Outstanding Alumni Award from MSU Billings for "Exceptional Contribution"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Outstanding Alumni of the 2nd Millennium |url=http://www.msubillings.edu/alumni/outstanding00s.htm |work=Montana State University Billings |accessdate=December 19, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106043736/http://www.msubillings.edu/alumni/outstanding00s.htm |archivedate=November 6, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Woodrow Wilson Foundation]]: Imagining America grant. The next year, he was awarded a [[Paul G. Allen Family Foundation]] Grant for his residency in conjunction with the Techno Powwow Project.

[[File:Seized! The Border and Customs Uncovered.jpg|thumb|The entrance to Seized! The Border and Customs Uncovered]]
'''Seized! The Border and Customs uncovered''' is the [[Border Force]] National Museum (previously - [[UK Border Agency]]), located in [[Liverpool]], [[England]] and holds the national collection of [[HM Revenue and Customs]], one of the most important collections of its type held anywhere in the world.  Originally HM Customs &amp; Excise National Museum, the collection is now a gallery located on the basement floor of the [[Merseyside Maritime Museum]] at the [[Albert Dock]].

The exhibits tell the story of [[smuggling]] and [[contraband]] from the 18th century to the present day.  They include an extensive display of tools of the job, prints, paintings and photographs relating to the work of the UK Border Agency and HM Revenue and Customs. Other items look at the ingenious and often dangerous world of smuggling, prohibited goods and concealment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/maritime/collections/seized/ Seized! The Border and Customs uncovered], National Museums Liverpool. Accessed 21 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The museum was established in 1994 a partnership between [[National Museums Liverpool]] and [[HM Customs &amp; Excise]], which in 2005 merged with the [[Inland Revenue]] to form HM Revenue and Customs. The museum was designed to educate the public about smuggling and contraband from 1700s to the present day.&lt;ref name="HM Customs &amp; Excise"&gt;{{cite web|title=HM Customs &amp; Excise National Museum|url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk:80/customs/|publisher=[[National Museums Liverpool]]|accessdate=7 October 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030910164429/http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/customs/|archivedate=10 September 2003|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The museum was named as [[HM Revenue and Customs]] National Museum in May 2008 (known as 'Seized! Revenue and Customs Uncovered')&lt;ref name="Customs"&gt;{{cite web|title=Seized!

The Border and Customs uncovered Border Force National Museum".&lt;ref name="Seized"&gt;{{cite web|title=Seized!

Since May 2008 the collection has been located in the basement of [[Merseyside Maritime Museum]].

'''''A Hebrew and English Lexicon of the Old Testament''''', more commonly known  as '''''Brown–Driver–Briggs''''' or '''''BDB''''' (from the name of its three authors) is a standard reference for [[Biblical Hebrew]] and [[Biblical Aramaic|Aramaic]],&lt;ref name=BHAL2013/&gt; first published in 1906. It is organized by (Hebrew) alphabetical order of [[triliteral|three letter roots]]. It was based on the Hebrew-German [[lexicon]] of [[Wilhelm Gesenius]], translated by [[Edward Robinson (scholar)|Edward Robinson]]. The chief editor was [[Francis Brown (theologian)|Francis Brown]], with the co-operation of [[Samuel Rolles Driver]] and [[Charles Augustus Briggs]], hence the name Brown–Driver–Briggs.  Some modern printings have added the [[Strong's concordance|Strong's reference numbers]] for Biblical Hebrew and Aramaic words.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In 2013, [[Semitic studies|semitists]] [[Jo Ann Hackett]] and John Huehnergard received a [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] grant to fund creation of a revised and updated electronic version of the BDB; the resulting ''Biblical Hebrew and Aramaic Lexicon'' will be available through a website (''Semitica Electronica'') or via print-on-demand.&lt;ref name=BHAL2013&gt;{{cite web |date=11 July 2013 |title=Jo Ann Hackett and John Huehnergard Receive NEH Grant for Biblical Hebrew and Aramaic Lexicon |website=UT College of Liberal Arts |publisher=University of Texas at Austin |url=http://liberalarts.utexas.edu/mes/news/article.php?id=6768 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chaldean Neo-Aramaic''', or simply '''Chaldean''', is a [[Northeastern Neo-Aramaic]] language&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur John Maclean|Maclean, Arthur John]] (1895). ''Grammar of the dialects of vernacular Syriac: as spoken by the Eastern Syrians of Kurdistan, north-west Persia, and the Plain of Mosul: with notices of the vernacular of the Jews of Azerbaijan and of Zakhu near Mosul''. Cambridge University Press, London.&lt;/ref&gt; spoken throughout a large region stretching from the plain of [[Urmia]], in northwestern Iran, to the [[Nineveh plains]], in northern Iraq, together with parts of southeastern Turkey.

Chaldean Neo-Aramaic is [[mutual intelligibility|closely related]] to [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]], where it is at times considered a dialect of that language. Most [[Assyrian Christians]] in Iraq, Iran and the Khabour River Valley in Syria speak either the Chaldean Neo-Aramaic or Assyrian Neo-Aramaic variety, two varieties of Christian Neo-Aramaic or ''Sureth''. Despite the two terms seeming to indicate a separate religious or even ethnic identity, both languages and their native speakers originate from and are indigenous to the same [[Upper Mesopotamia]]n region (what was [[Assyria]] between the 9th century BC and 7th century BC).&lt;ref&gt;Nordhoff, Sebastian; Hammarström, Harald; Forkel, Robert; Haspelmath, Martin, eds. (2013). "Northeastern Neo-Aramaic". Glottolog 2.2. Leipzig: Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blench, 2006. The Afro-Asiatic Languages: Classification and Reference List&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khan 2008, pp. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Assyrian Gospel 1.jpg|thumb|260px|An 18th-century Assyrian Gospel Book from the [[Urmia]] region of [[Iran]].]]
[[Imperial Aramaic]] was adopted as the second language of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] by [[Tiglath-Pileser III]] in the 8th century BC in account of the mostly Aramaic population in areas conquered west of the Euphrates. On the Western periphery of Assyria there had been widespread Aramean-[[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] bilingualism at least since the mid-9th century BC. Aramaic would supplant Akkadian throughout the entire empire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aramaic-dem.org/English/History/ON%20THE%20ROLE%20OF%20ARAMAIC%20IN%20THE%20ASSYRIAN%20EMPIRE%20-%20Hayim%20Tadmor%20.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chaldean Neo-Aramaic is one of a number of modern [[Northeastern Aramaic languages]] spoken by Syriac Christians native to the northern region of [[Iraq]] from [[Kirkuk]] through the [[Nineveh plains]], [[Irbil]] and [[Mosul]] to [[Dohuk]], [[Urmia]] in northwestern [[Iran]], northeastern [[Syria]] (particularly the [[Al Hasakah]] region) and in southeast [[Turkey]], particularly [[Hakkari]], [[Bohtan]], [[Harran]], [[Tur Abdin]], [[Mardin]] and [[Diyarbakir]]. The [[Assyrian Christian]] dialects have been heavily influenced by [[Classical Syriac]], the literary language of the [[Church of the East]] and the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] in antiquity. Therefore, Christian Neo-Aramaic has a dual heritage: literary [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and colloquial [[Neo-Assyrian]] [[Eastern Aramaic]]. The closely related dialects are often collectively called ''Soureth'', or ''Syriac ''in [[Iraqi Arabic]].

[[Jews]], [[Mandeans]] and [[Syriac Christians|Syriac]]-[[Aramean]] Christians speak different dialects of Aramaic that are often mutually unintelligible.

==Dialects==
[[File:Chaldeandialect.ogg|thumb|right|Sample of the standard Chaldean dialect. The frequent usage of /ħ/ and /ʕ/ makes it similar sounding to the [[Western Aramaic]] languages (voice by Bishop Amel Shamon Nona).]]
Chaldean Neo-Aramaic and Assyrian Neo-Aramaic originate in the [[Nineveh Plains]] and [[Upper Mesopotamia]], a region which was an integral part of ancient Assyria between the 9th century BC and 7th century BC. Chaldean (Assyrian) Neo-Aramaic bears a resemblance to the Assyrian tribal dialects of [[Tyari]] and [[Barwari|Barwar]] in the [[Hakkari Province]], although the Assyrian dialects do not use the [[Pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeal]]s /ħ/ and /ʕ/.

[[List of loanwords in Assyrian Neo-Aramaic|Loanwords]] of Arabic, Persian and Kurdish origin exist in the language, as with Assyrian.

*The Chaldean dialects are generally characterised by the presence of the fricatives {{IPA|/θ/}} (''th'') and {{IPA|/ð/}} (''dh'') which correspond to {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}}, respectively, in other Assyrian dialects (excluding the [[Tyari]] dialect). However, the standard or educational form of Chaldean would realize the consonants {{IPA|/θ/}} and {{IPA|/ð/}} as {{IPA|/tˤ/}}.
*Most Chaldean Neo-Aramaic varieties would use the phoneme of {{IPA|/f/}}, which corresponds to {{IPA|/p/}} in most of Assyrian Neo-Aramaic dialects (excluding the Tyari dialect).
*In some Chaldean dialects {{IPA|/r/}} is realized as {{IPAblink|ɹ}}. In others, it is either a [[Tap consonant|tap]] {{IPAblink|ɾ}} or a [[Trill consonant|trill]] {{IPAblink|r}}.
*Unlike in Assyrian Neo-Aramaic, the [[guttural]] sounds of {{IPAblink|ʕ}} and {{IPAblink|ħ}} are used predominantly in Chaldean varieties; this is a feature also seen in other [[Northeastern Neo-Aramaic]] languages.&lt;ref&gt;*Beyer, Klaus (1986).

==Script==
Chaldean Neo-Aramaic is written in the ''Madenhaya'' version of the [[Syriac alphabet]], which is also used for classical Syriac. The ''School of Alqosh'' produced religious poetry in the colloquial Neo-Aramaic rather than classical Syriac in the 17th century prior to the founding of the Chaldean Catholic Church and the naming of the dialect as ''Chaldean Neo-Aramaic'', and the Dominican Press in [[Mosul]] has produced a number of books in the language. Alternatively, the [[Syriac Latin alphabet]] may also be used to transliterate the Syriac script into [[Latin script|Latin]].

The '''''Collins Spanish Dictionary''''' is a bilingual dictionary of English and Spanish derived from the Collins Word Web, an analytical linguistics database.  As well as its primary function as a bilingual dictionary, it also contains usage guides for English and Spanish (known as ''Lengua y Uso'' and ''Language in Use'' respectively) and English and Spanish verb tables. In 2009,  the dictionary was brought to the [[iPhone]] &amp; [[iPad]] platform. The iOS app of this dictionary, which has become one of the most popular Spanish dictionaries in the [[App store]] since then is developed by Cole Zhu Inc.

== Protocol support ==
Several versions of the TLS protocol exist. SSL 2.0 is a deprecated&lt;ref name=ssl2diediedie&gt;[//tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6176 RFC6176: Prohibiting Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Version 2.0]&lt;/ref&gt; protocol version with significant weaknesses.  SSL 3.0 (1996) and TLS 1.0 (1999) are successors with two weaknesses in CBC-padding that were explained in 2001 by Serge Vaudenay.&lt;ref name="vaudenay-cbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/52417/files/IC_TECH_REPORT_200150.pdf|title="CBC-Padding: Security Flaws in SSL, IPsec, WTLS,...", Serge Vaudenay, 2001|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  TLS 1.1 (2006) fixed only one of the problems, by switching to random [[initialization vector]]s (IV) for CBC block ciphers, whereas the more problematic use of mac-pad-encrypt instead of the secure pad-mac-encrypt was addressed with RFC7366.&lt;ref name=rfc7366&gt;[//tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7366 RFC7366: Encrypt-then-MAC for Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security]&lt;/ref&gt;  A workaround for SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0, roughly equivalent to random IVs from TLS 1.1, was widely adopted by many implementations in late 2011,&lt;ref name="BEAST-countermeasure"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.educatedguesswork.org/2011/11/rizzoduong_beast_countermeasur.html|title=Rizzo/Duong BEAST Countermeasures|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; so from a security perspective, all existing version of TLS 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2 provide equivalent strength in the base protocol and are suitable for 128-bit security according to NIST SP800-57 up to at least 2030.  In 2014, the [[POODLE]] vulnerability of SSL 3.0 was discovered, which takes advantage the known vulnerabilities in CBC, and an insecure fallback negotiation used in browsers.&lt;ref name="poodle"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.openssl.org/~bodo/ssl-poodle.pdf | title=This POODLE Bites: Exploiting The SSL 3.0 Fallback | date=September 2014 | accessdate=15 October 2014 |author1=Möller, Bodo |author2=Duong, Thai |author3=Kotowicz, Krzysztof }}&lt;/ref&gt;

TLS 1.2 (2008) introduced a means to identify the hash used for digital signatures.  While permitting the use of stronger hash functions for digital signatures in the future (rsa,sha256/sha384/sha512) over the SSL 3.0 conservative choice (rsa,sha1+md5), the TLS 1.2 protocol change inadvertently and substantially weakened the default digital signatures and provides (rsa,sha1) and even (rsa,md5).&lt;ref name="TLSv1.2-changes"&gt;[//tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246#section-1.2 TLSv1.2's Major Differences from TLSv1.1]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Datagram Transport Layer Security]] (DTLS or Datagram TLS) 1.0 is a modification of TLS 1.1 for a packet-oriented transport layer, where packet loss and packet reordering have to be tolerated.  The revision DTLS 1.2 based on TLS 1.2 was published in January 2012&lt;ref name="RFC 6347"&gt;RFC 6347&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that there are known vulnerabilities in SSL 2.0 and SSL 3.0.  With the exception of the predictable IVs (for which an easy workaround exists) all currently known vulnerabilities affect all version of TLS 1.0/1.1/1.2 alike.&lt;ref name=attacks&gt;{{cite web | title = Bard attack | citeseerx = 10.1.1.61.5887 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== NSA Suite B Cryptography ==
Required components for [[NSA Suite B Cryptography]] (RFC 6460) are:
* [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] (AES) with key sizes of 128 and 256 bits. For traffic flow, AES should be used with either the Counter Mode (CTR) for low bandwidth traffic or the [[Galois/Counter Mode]] (GCM) mode of operation for high bandwidth traffic (see [[Block cipher modes of operation]]) — [[symmetric encryption]]
* [[Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm]] (ECDSA) — [[digital signature]]s
* [[Elliptic Curve Diffie–Hellman]]  (ECDH) — [[key agreement]]
* [[SHA-2|Secure Hash Algorithm 2]] (SHA-256 and SHA-384) — [[message digest]]

Per CNSSP-15, the 256-bit elliptic curve (specified in FIPS 186-2), SHA-256, and AES with 128-bit keys are sufficient for protecting classified information up to the [[Security clearance#Secret|Secret]] level, while the 384-bit elliptic curve (specified in FIPS 186-2), SHA-384, and AES with 256-bit keys are necessary for the protection of [[Security clearance#Top Secret|Top Secret]] information.

== Compression ==
Note the [[CRIME (security exploit)|CRIME security exploit]] takes advantage of TLS compression, so conservative implementations do not enable compression at the TLS level. [[HTTP compression]] is unrelated and unaffected by this exploit, but is exploited by the related [[BREACH (security exploit)|BREACH attack]].

== Extensions ==
In this section the extensions each implementation supports are listed. Note that the Secure Renegotiation extension is critical for HTTPS client security {{citation needed|date=August 2014}}. TLS clients not implementing it are vulnerable to attacks, irrespective of whether the client implements TLS renegotiation.

Wilson] p. 26-27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=carnegie/&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Bligh, Alexander. 1985. " The Saudi Religious Elite (Ulama) as Participant in the Political System of the Kingdom." International Journal of Middle East Studies 17, no. 1, 37-50&lt;/ref&gt;The council is appointed by the king, with salaries paid by the government. As of 2009, the council was made up of 21 members.&lt;ref name=carnegie/&gt;  Saudi [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia|King Fahd]] has continued the precedent set by earlier kings of meeting weekly with Council members who resided in the capital, [[Riyadh]].&lt;ref name=GS&gt;{{cite web|title=Council of Senior Ulama|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/gulf/sa-ulama.htm|publisher=globalsecurity.org|accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2010, Saudi [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|King Abdullah]] decreed that only members of the Council and a few other clerics could issue [[fatwa]] in Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name=carnegie/&gt;

==History==
Prior to 1971, the council met informally, headed by the [[Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia|Grand Mufti]].&lt;ref name=ComingStorm/&gt;  (As of 2009, the Grand Mufti—Sheikh [[Abdul-Aziz ibn Abdullah Al Shaykh]]—is still the head of the council.)
On 29 August 1972 [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|King Faisal ibn Abd al-Aziz]] issued a royal decree establishing the Council.&lt;ref name=Islamopedia&gt;[http://islamopediaonline.org/websites-institutions/permanent-committee-islamic-research-and-opinion-saudi-Arabia Islamopedia: "Standing Committee for Scholarly Research and Issuing Fatwas, (Saudi Arabia)"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226104000/http://islamopediaonline.org/websites-institutions/permanent-committee-islamic-research-and-opinion-saudi-Arabia |date=February 26, 2012 }} retrieved 22 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 2009, the body was restricted to members of the [[Hanbali]] [[madhab]] (school of Islamic jurisprudence). On 14 February of that year [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|King Abdullah]] expanded the Committee to include scholars from the other three [[Sunni]] schools of Islamic jurisprudence ([[Shafi'i]], [[Hanafi]] and [[Maliki]]).&lt;ref name=carnegie/&gt; Despite the newfound diversity, observers note that the scholars continue to hold very similar positions in regard to ''[[ʿAqīdah]]'' (creed).&lt;ref name=carnegie/&gt;

The Senior Council assists in reviewing requests for fatwas prepared by the four (or five) member [[Permanent Committee for Islamic Research and Issuing Fatwas]] whose membership is drawn from the Senior Council. The members of the Senior Council are appointed to four year terms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&amp;contentID=2009021529324 Saudi Gazette: "Council of Senior Ulema reconstituted"] 22 June 2013| (list of members of the council)&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2010, Saudi [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|King Abdullah]] decreed that only officially approved religious scholars would be allowed to issue fatwas in Saudi Arabia, primarily the members the Council of Senior Scholars.&lt;ref name=carnegie/&gt; At least one Islamic fatwa website [[Islam-QA]] run by Saudi Islamic scholar [[Muhammad Al-Munajid]] was banned in [[Saudi Arabia]] as a result.&lt;ref name=carnegie/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2010/09/03/118350.html Al Arabiya: "Saudi Arabia blocks 'Islam Question and Answer'" (''in Arabic'')] 2 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The Senior Council and the Permanent Committee issue fatwas, the [[imams]] communicate them, and the [[Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (Saudi Arabia)|Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice]] enforces their rulings.&lt;ref name=ComingStorm /&gt;

==Ulama==
While the ulema of Saudi Arabia and the Council are sometimes used interchangeably (for example [https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/uploads/Documents/pubs/PolicyFocus96.pdf here]), in fact, of the estimated 7,000 to 10,000 people that make up the ulama and their families, only thirty to forty of the most senior scholars "exercised substantive political influence".&lt;ref name=GS/&gt;

==Oversight==
According to Simon Henderson, the council must give a fatwa of approval before a new king is crowned.&lt;ref name=Henderson&gt;{{cite web|last=Henderson|first=Simon|title=After King Abdullah Succession in Saudi Arabia|url=https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/uploads/Documents/pubs/PolicyFocus96.pdf|work=August 2009|publisher=Washington Institute for Near East Policy|accessdate=19 March 2014|page=9|quote=The ulama must then declare the new king an imam (Muslim leader). The declaration can only be made on the basis of a fatwa indicating that the decision is legitimate. The approval of the nation’s religious leaders not only authenticates the succession on religious grounds but also serves as a reminder of the historically close relationship between the House of Saud and the dominant Salafi version of Islam in the kingdom. In theory, a danger exists that the ulama will be independent in its judgment and issue a fatwa bequeathing leadership outside the normal line of succession, but this has never happened. The ulama issuing the fatwa comprises members of the Supreme Religious Council, appointed by the king.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to ''the Columbia World Dictionary of Islamism'', the council serves in theory to guide the Saudi king and to verify his  "fidelity" to the Islamic principle of "absolute obedience" to [[Sharia|Islamic law]] upon which "the absolute authority of the sovereign" over the Saudi population rests.&lt;ref name=CWDI&gt;{{Cite book|title=Columbia World Dictionary of Islamism|editors=Olivier Roy, Antoine Sfeir|page=403|quote=Abd el-Wahhab's doctrine lays down that people are subject to the absolute authority of the sovereign in return for the sovereign's absolute obedience to the law of God ... The sovereign's fidelity to his commitment must therefore be verified by a body of `ulema` whose role is to examine his politices to verfy that they conform to the principles of Islam }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in practice the council "virtually never expresses opposition to any proposal from the royal family.".&lt;ref name=CWDI/&gt;

==Support for monarchy==
The Council is often used to provide religious support for government edicts. For example, in 2011 it issued a fatwa ruling against protest demonstrations calling them "deviant intellectual and partisan connections". Demonstrations "and anything that leads to disunity and fragmentation of the nation" were not allowed under Sharia (Islamic law). Reform could only come from giving advice and counsel, "and not by issuing and collecting signatures on intimidating and incendiary statements that violate what God the most High has commanded"  (sura 4, aya 83, of the Koran were cited in support).&lt;ref name=LoC&gt;{{cite web|title=Saudi Arabia: The Regime Invokes Sharia Law to Prevent Public Protest|url=https://www.loc.gov/lawweb/servlet/lloc_news?disp2_l205402565_text|work=10 March 2011|publisher=Library of Congress, US|accessdate=18 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is rarely in opposition to government policy, and when it does disagree, the Council generally expresses it by silence.&lt;ref name=carnegie&gt;[http://carnegieendowment.org/2010/10/27/saudi-fatwa-restrictions-and-state-clerical-relationship/6b81 "Saudi Fatwa Restrictions and the State-Clerical Relationship"]| by Christopher Boucek| Carnegie Endowment| 27 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  Observers differ as to how much influence the Council has.  Many believe the government generally consults the Council prior to issuing legislation, while other believe that "more often than not", the government does "as it likes and then seeks approval after the fact".&lt;ref name=carnegie/&gt; According to Christopher Boucek,&lt;ref&gt;an associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace&lt;/ref&gt; the influence of the Council and ulema in general varies according to how "secure" the royal family feels. Great levels of royal confidence lead to less disregard shown to, and greater control over the religious establishment.&lt;ref name=carnegie/&gt;  Unlike other ulema, Saudi scholars do not have income-generating lands or endowments to fund them and are dependent on government salaries.&lt;ref name=ComingStorm/&gt;

In 1992 [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia|King Fahd]] pressured seven members of the Senior Ulema into retirement after they failed to sign a letter condemning conservative attacks on the al-Saud family.&lt;ref name=ComingStorm/&gt; In 2009, another member—Sheikh Saad bin Nasser al-Shithri—was pressured to resign after he opposed [[Gender segregation and Muslims|gender mixing]] at the new [[King Abdullah University of Science and Technology]], the first co-ed university in the Kingdom.&lt;ref name=Hoteit&gt;{{cite web|last=Hoteit|first=Lamis|title=Saudi cleric sacked over co-ed university spat|url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2009/10/04/86923.html|date=4 October 2009|work=AL Arabiya News|accessdate=25 February 2014|author2=Courtney C.

The '''Digital Transgender Archive''' (DTA) is an online resource created by the [[College of the Holy Cross]] in [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester, Massachusetts]], in collaboration with more than thirty international colleges, universities, nonprofit organizations, and private collections. It was established to enable researchers to locate and make use of [[transgender]]-related materials in digital and physical collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://acrl.ala.org/dh/2016/09/08/recommended-trans-ing-history-on-the-web-the-digital-transgender-archive/|title=RECOMMENDED: Trans-ing History on the Web: The Digital Transgender Archive|date=2016-09-08|work=dh+lib|access-date=2017-06-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.digitaltransgenderarchive.net/about/overview|title=Overview -  Digital Transgender Archive|website=www.digitaltransgenderarchive.net|language=en|access-date=2017-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It serves as a finding aid for archival materials and an online hub for born-digital materials and digitized historical materials. According to the archive's website: "In order to address these significant barriers to the accessibility of trans history, the DTA virtually merges disparate archival collections, digital materials, and independent projects with a single search engine. With rich primary source materials and powerful search tools, the DTA offers a generative point of entry into the fascinating and expansive world of trans history."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.digitaltransgenderarchive.net/about/overview|title=Overview -  Digital Transgender Archive|website=www.digitaltransgenderarchive.net|language=en|access-date=2017-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
The DTA co-locates and provides direct access or links to materials from over thirty institutions including (but not limited to) [[Canadian Lesbian and Gay Archives]], [[GLBT Historical Society]], [[Leather Archives and Museum]], [[Transgender Oral History Project]], [[University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee]], and [[ONE National Gay &amp; Lesbian Archives]] in order to assist researchers in overcoming several challenges in conducting research into transgender history. Materials documenting transgender history are widely dispersed, and the level of description and access for materials varies widely. The creation of this resource makes available materials that were previously unavailable online or very difficult to find in archival collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hyperallergic.com/285786/amassing-the-worlds-largest-digital-transgender-archive/?ref=featured|title=Amassing the World's Largest Digital Transgender Archive|date=2016-03-24|work=Hyperallergic|access-date=2017-06-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because the term ''transgender'' is relatively new, materials processed in archives prior to the 1990s may not contain the now widely-accepted descriptive term, so this digital repository seeks to bridge that gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://i-d.vice.com/en_us/article/the-first-digital-transgender-archive-is-a-lesson-in-history-discrimination-relationships-and-everyday-life|title=the first digital transgender archive is a lesson in history, discrimination, relationships, and everyday life {{!}} look {{!}} i-D|work=i-D|access-date=2017-06-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DTA contains over 2,300 items, including newsletters, periodicals, photographs, and zines, and—according to one of the originators of the project—"anything related to 'trans-ing gender.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blog.historians.org/2016/08/trans-ing-history-web-digital-transgender-archive/|title=Trans-ing History on the Web: The Digital Transgender Archive - American Historical Association|date=2016-08-29|work=American Historical Association|access-date=2017-06-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; By digitally merging materials from multiple institutions world-wide, access is greatly increased.

== Awards ==
Assistant Professor K.J. Rawson received a Digital Innovation Fellowship and subsequent $150,000 Digital Extension Grant from the [[American Council of Learned Societies]] for work on the DTA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Coker Award from the [[Society of American Archivists]], which honors "finding aids, finding aid systems, innovative development in archival description, or descriptive tools that enable archivists to produce more effective finding aids".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.archivists.org/book/export/html/21769|title=C.F.W.

REGIONAL SCHOOL UNIT 26 |vol= |reporter= |opinion= |pinpoint= |court=Maine Supreme Judicial Court |date=January 30, 2014 |url=https://www.glad.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/doe-v-clenchy-decision-1-30-14.pdf |access-date=July 22, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;''''' (also referred to as '''''Doe v. Clenchy''''') was an anti-discrimination case decided by the [[Maine Supreme Judicial Court]] in June 2013. In that case, [[transgender]] teenager [[Nicole Maines]] won the right to use the female bathroom in her high school.&lt;ref name=time/&gt; Upon initial filing, Maines was referenced by the pseudonym "Susan Doe" in court papers to protect her identity. This case marked the first time that a [[State court (United States)|state court]] ruled denying a transgender student access to the bathroom consistent with their [[gender identity]] is unlawful.&lt;ref name=advocate/&gt;&lt;ref name=ap1/&gt;&lt;ref name=ap2/&gt;&lt;ref name=wt2/&gt;

The case stemmed from an incident when Maines was in elementary school and the grandfather of a classmate complaining after learning that Maines used the female washroom. Following this, Maines was forced to use the staff bathroom, which resulted in her parents suing the school district for discrimination.&lt;ref name="time" /&gt; In June 2014, the Maine Supreme Judicial Court ruled that the school district violated the [[Maine Human Rights Act|Human Rights Act]], and prohibited the district from barring transgender students access to bathrooms consistent with their gender identity. Maines and her family were awarded $75,000.&lt;ref name="time" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://time.com/3615599/transgender-student-restroom-lawsuit-maine/ |title=Transgender Teen Awarded $75,000 in Lawsuit |last=Stout |first=David |date=December 3, 2014 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |access-date=July 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Fork Me, Spoon Me: The sensual cookbook''''' is a [[cookbook]] by [[Amy Reiley]]. It was published in 2006 by Life of Reiley, the author’s publishing, consulting and speaking company.

''Fork Me, Spoon Me'' is 142 pages of recipes using ingredients which are thought to have an [[aphrodisiac]] effect. The book features 12 ingredients noted for their [[aphrodisiac]] history which are: [[Mentha|mint]], [[ginger]] root, [[rosemary]], [[vanilla]], [[chocolate]], [[almond]]s, [[figs]], [[peach]]es, [[mango]], [[chile pepper]]s, [[honey]] and [[saffron]]. Each ingredient is used in three to four recipes with tips for presentation and when to serve. Reiley includes references to ancient cultures and individuals that have mentioned foods having an aphrodisiac potential.&lt;ref name="''The Food Paper'' review"&gt;{{cite news| last = Brown| first = Liz| title = Review of ''Fork Me, Spoon M''e| publisher = ''The Food Paper''| date = n.d.| url = http://www.thefoodpaper.com/cookbooks/forkme_spoonme.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Fork Me, Spoon Me'' was inspired by and fashioned after the ''[[Joy of Sex]]'' — the chapter layout and flow of content is similar.
The recipes in ''Fork Me, Spoon Me'' were created so that none requires a knife to eat. Only a fork, spoon and/or fingers are needed, hence the title of the cookbook.

''Fork Me, Spoon Me'' has been mentioned by the ''[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]'',&lt;ref name="''National Geographic'' article"&gt;{{cite news| last = Handwerk| first = Brian| title = Do Aphrodisiacs Really Work? | publisher = ''National Geographic'' | date = February 14, 2006| url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/02/0214_060214_valentines.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Times]]'',&lt;ref name="''The Times'' article"&gt;{{cite news| last = Dr. Stuttaford| first = Thomas|author2=Godson, Suzi| title = Agony and Ecstasy: Sex Advice | publisher = ''The Times'' | date = January 20, 2007| url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/features/article1294255.ece | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Marie Claire]]''&lt;ref name="''Marie Claire'' article"&gt;{{cite news| author = n/a| title = Can You Dine Your Way to Better Sex? | publisher = ''Marie Claire'' | date = n.d.| url = http://www.forkmespoonme.com/images/marieclaireclip.jpg}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The New York Daily News]]''.&lt;ref name="''New York Daily News'' article"&gt;{{cite news| last = Piaza| first = Joe| title = Sex on the Half Shell | publisher = ''New York Daily News'' | date = September 26, 2006| url = http://www.forkmespoonme.com/nydnsept06.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cookbook has also led to appearances on news and entertainment programs throughout the United States and Canada, Australia and Britain.

[[File:Würzburger Vierjahreszeitenaltar 2.jpg|thumb|Summer cherub]]
[[File:Würzburger Vierjahreszeitenaltar 3.jpg|thumb|Autumn cherub]]
A [[ancient Rome|Roman]] decorated altar dating from early in the reign of [[Claudius]] (around AD 40) is known as the '''Four seasons altar of Würzburg''' ([[German language|de]]: ''Würzburger Vierjahreszeitenaltar''). It is kept in the [[Martin von Wagner Museum]] in [[Würzburg]] under the inventory number ''H 5056''.

== Discovery ==
The altar was found in 1886 on the [[Pincian Hill]] in [[Rome]], once the site of the [[Horti Sallustiani]] and later an imperial property. The altar was immediately published, but it was soon forgotten. Decades later it turned up in an American private collection. In 1966 it was brought back to Rome, thanks to the artefact trade of [[Gorgio Fallani]]. There it was acquired for the antiquities division of [[Martin von Wagner Museum]] in [[Würzburg]] by [[Erika Simon]] who recognised the lost altar. The Italian state could raise no claim to the work after eighty years. The work was almost taken by the [[Antikensammlung Berlin]], after Erika Simon made [[Friedrich Matz Junior]] and the director of the [[West Berlin]] collection [[Adolf Greifenhagen]] aware of the altar. However, despite the larger offer, Fallani sold the altar to Würzburg in accordance with his earlier promise.

== Description ==
[[File:Würzburger Vierjahreszeitenaltar 1.jpg|thumb|left|Winter cherub at left]]
The four seasons altar made of fine-grained white [[marble]] had a height of 73 centimetres and a diameter of 56.4 centimetres. Apart from a few nicks, it remains fully intact. The [[cherub]] representing the winter received some damage during the carving of the deed animal, which was not repaired.

The round altar shows four cherubs evenly spaced around it, which seem from their attributes to represent the four seasons. Winter is dressed as a farmworker and points to winter activities with a slaughtered animal and a wine [[amphora]]. The other three [[personification]]s allude to deities, who are symbolically associated with the four seasons by authors of the literary tradition, such as [[Ovid]] and [[Lucretius]]. A girdle of flowers recalls that of the Spring goddesses [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] and [[Flora (mythology)|Flora]]; ears of corn and poppies refer to the goddess of fertility and summer, [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]]. The cherub of autumn recalls a [[satyr]] and holds a basket of grapes - symbolising the wine and autumn god [[Bacchus]]. The winter and spring cherubs face each other, as do the cherubs of autumn and summer.

== Purpose ==
The altar was probably intended less for cultic purposes than as an evocative garden decoration. Also, in the early imperial period, Imperial princes were depicted as cherubs, so there is probably a political significance in addition to the decorative function, which aimed for a prosperous growth of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2227">'''Ggulu''' is a character in the Gandan [[creation myth]]. He is the creator of all things in heaven.

==The Legend==
In the legend, two of Ggulu's daughters discover [[Kintu]], the first human being according to Gandan myth. When Kintu declines to follow the daughters to heaven, they tell Ggulu who promptly tells his son to steal Kintu's cow, his only source of nutrition. When Kintu is brought to heaven by Nambi, Ggulu's daughter, Ggulu tests him by ordering Kintu to eat ten thousand meals to prove that he is a man. Kintu secretly disposes of the food into a hidden cavern and Mugulu tests him yet again. When Kintu succeeds in the second test of cutting stones, through the use of a magical bronze axe, Ggulu orders Kintu to fetch him a bucket of dew to drink. Kintu is able to do this as the bucket itself has magical powers. Ggulu then tests Kintu one final time by herding three herds of ten thousand of cows before him. Kintu's job is to retrieve his cow, and when the third herd is driven by, a magic hornet aids him in identifying his cow, and two calves born while in captivity.

Upon passing all of Ggulu's tests, Ggulu gives Kintu his daughter, Nambi, to take back to Earth. He also gives them multiple vegetable plants, a hen, and some millet. He warns them then to hurry back to Earth to avoid gaining the attention of [[Walumbe]] (meaning "disease or death"), Nambi's sister. He tells them not to come back for anything, but when Kintu forgets the hen's millet, he returns for it. Upon Kintu's return, [[Walumbe]] discovers the situation and confronts Kintu and Nambi. After much deliberation, Kintu and Nambi allow [[Walumbe]] to stay with them on Earth for a time. When [[Walumbe]] begins killing children on Earth, Kintu returns to Ggulu. Ggulu sends his son, [[Kaikuzi]], to aid in ridding Earth of [[Walumbe]]. Finally, when humans ruin [[Kaikuzi]]'s plan for capturing [[Walumbe]], [[Kaikuzi]] returns to heaven and Ggulu allows [[Walumbe]] to remain on Earth.

'''Harding v Coburn''' [1976] 2 NZLR 577 was a [[New Zealand]] case that was one of the first that upheld that the [[Illegal Contracts Act 1970]] had the power to validate (i.e. make legal) despite the fact that another legal enactment "deemed to be unlawful and shall have no effect".&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Contract |edition=4th |last1=Walker |first1=Campbell |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71770-X|year=2004 |pages=162–163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Harding sold their farm to Coburn. Unfortunately, the parties neglected to get the sale approved by the Court, as required under s25(4) of the Land Settlement Promotion and Land Acquisition Act [1952]. Under this Act, failure to obtain such a consent made the sale "unlawful and shall have no effect".

As a consequence, Coburn sought the relief of validation under section 7 of the Illegal Contracts Act 1970. Harding's lawyers argued that as the sale was illegal under the Land Settlement Promotion and Land Acquisition Act, there was no legally enforceable sale agreement.

==Decision==
The Court of Appeal ruled that the courts had the power to validate contracts that are deemed illegal unless the other Act expressly prohibits validation under the Illegal Contracts Act.

*[[New Life Children’s Refuge case]]. In the aftermath of the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]], ten [[Baptist]] [[missionary|missionaries]] are arrested and charged with kidnapping.

==2009==
*China - "Six government officials in southwest China have been punished over an orphanage scandal when three children were taken away from their families who could not afford fines for violating family planning regulations. The orphanage sent the children overseas for adoption from 2004 to 2006, a [[Guizhou]]-based newspaper reported today."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shanghaidaily.com/sp/article/2009/200907/20090703/article_406276.htm |title=上海日报 - English Window to China News |publisher=Shanghai Daily |date=2013-04-18 |accessdate=2013-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Ethiopia]] - [[Canadian Broadcasting Company]] reports Canadian families "claim that CAFAC has informed them their child is an orphan when the parents in fact exist...

Research done by the adoption agency, shows that the information about the children on file does not match with their actual back ground.

*[[Samoa]] - Samoa rushes through legislation "to tighten up on foreign adoptions following the death of a child who had been in the care of an American agency..." one year after "a One News investigation revealed Samoan parents had put their children up for adoption with the organisation Focus On Children, not realising they would never see them again.

"The lid was lifted on the "evil and exploitative" business of international adoption yesterday when a High Court judge attacked a British freelance social worker for allowing a blacklisted family to buy a baby from a couple in the United States...But before her first birthday she was placed at the mercy of the courts after her "new" parents, who were barred from adoption in Britain by conventional means, split and her adoptive mother committed suicide."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/judge-attacks-social-worker-over-international-adoption-scandal-599872.html |location=London |work=The Independent |title=Judge attacks social worker over international adoption scandal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101023064313/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/judge-attacks-social-worker-over-international-adoption-scandal-599872.html |archivedate=2010-10-23 |accessdate=2013-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2001==
*In December 2001, U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service halts adoptions from Cambodia.  Richard Cross, the lead investigator for the [[US Immigration and Customs Enforcement]], “accused officials at the highest level of government of complicity of scams involving hundreds of babies and millions of dollars.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brandeis.edu/investigate/gender/adoption/CambodiaNews.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628171921/http://www.brandeis.edu/investigate/gender/adoption/CambodiaNews.html |date=June 28, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also "the lead federal investigator for the prosecution of Lauryn Galindo for visa fraud and money laundering involved in Cambodian adoptions, estimated that most of the 800 adoptions Galindo facilitated were fraudulent--either based on fraudulent paperwork, coerced/induced/recruited relinquishments, babies bought, identities of the children switched, etc."&lt;ref&gt;Desiree Smolin and David Kruchkow, ''Why Bad Stories Must Be Told'', The Adoption Agency Checklist, [http://www.adoptionagencychecklist.com/page794.html]&lt;/ref&gt; 
This followed investigations by a local human rights group and the [[Phnom Penh Post]] exposing baby-buying and abduction through Lauryn Galindo's adoption operations, as well as others. In 2004, Galindo pleaded guilty to federal charges and was sentenced to 18 months in prison and also ordered to forfeit more than $1.4 million in property in Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brandeis.edu/investigate/gender/adoption/outofcambodia.html |accessdate=November 1, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804110545/http://www.brandeis.edu/investigate/gender/adoption/outofcambodia.html |archivedate=August 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1999==
*India - [[Andhra Pradesh]] - "[T]he scandal broke in March and April of 1999, and once again involved Sanjeeva Rao and his orphanage, ASD. This time, another individual, Peter Subbaiah, who ran the Good Samaritan Evangelical and Social Welfare Association, was also implicated. The primary accusation concerned buying babies from a tribal group called the Lambada. The Lambada were a traditionally nomadic people, now settled into hamlets (called tandas) and surviving primarily through subsistence farming and farm labor, often under conditions of severe poverty. The Lambada had previously practiced the custom of a bride price, but had adopted the culturally predominant Indian dowry system, which requires the family of the bride to pay a substantial sum to the groom’s family in order to arrange her marriage. In addition, the Lambada were said to believe that the third, sixth, and ninth child was, if a girl, “inauspicious.” They were allegedly prone both to female infanticide, and also to selling, for very modest sums, some of their female infants. Press accounts in India referred to their “fair complexion” as making them more attractive to foreign parents, although it is not clear whether this reflected Indian, rather than American, prejudices. The 1999 scandals began with the arrest of two women who were alleged to be acting as scouts or intermediaries in the purchase of children.  Although some reports styled these women as “social workers,” they were charged with buying Lambada infants for relatively small sums ($15 to $45), and then receiving significantly larger sums ($220 to $440) from the orphanages for the children. Press reports indicated that the orphanages received $2000 to $3000 for each child placed in intercountry adoption. As a result of the 1999 scandals, Sanjeeva Rao and Peter Subbaiah were arrested and placed in prison."&lt;ref name="bepress2005"&gt;"The Two Faces of Intercountry Adoption: The Significance of the Indian Adoption Scandals" Seton Hall Law Review Thirty-Five.Number Two (2005): 403-493.

==1995-1996==
*India - "The [[Andhra Pradesh]] adoption scandals focused on suspicions of irregularities in an orphanage called [[Action for Social Development]]. Children whose adoptions had been held up by the American embassy were granted visas and allowed to travel to the United States.&lt;ref name="bepress2005"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1877">'''''London Past and Present: Its History, Associations, and Traditions''''' by [[Henry B. Wheatley]] is a [[Topography|topographical]] and historical dictionary of [[London]] streets and landmarks, published by [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]] in 1891, that is still regarded as a definitive work in its area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.topsoc.org/uploads/documents/marks.pdf "The London Topographical Society: A brief account"] by Stephen Marks in ''[[The London Topographical Record]]'', 1980, pp. 1-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Wheatley's work was based upon ''The Handbook of London'' by [[Peter Cunningham (writer, born 1816)|Peter Cunningham]], published 1849, as well as literary, architectural and historical sources.

It was reprinted by [[Cambridge University Press]] in 2011 in the Cambridge Library Collection of "works of enduring scholarly value".

A '''maritime museum''' (sometimes '''nautical museum''') is a [[museum]] specializing in the display of objects relating to [[ship]]s and travel on large bodies of water. A subcategory of maritime museums are '''naval museums''', which focus on [[navy|navies]] and the military use of the sea.

The great prize of a maritime museum is a historic ship (or a replica) made accessible as a [[museum ship]], but as these are large and require a considerable budget to maintain, many museums preserve smaller or more fragile [[Ships preserved in museums|ships or partial ships within the museum buildings]]. Most museums exhibit interesting pieces of ships (such as a [[figurehead]] or [[cannon]]), [[ship model]]s, and miscellaneous small items associated with ships and shipping, like [[cutlery]], [[uniform]]s, and so forth.

[[Ship model]]lers often have a close association with maritime museums; not only does the museum have items that help the modeller achieve better accuracy, but the museum provides a display space for models larger than will comfortably fit in a modeller's home, and of the museum is happy to take a ship model as a donation. Museums will also commission models.

There are thousands of maritime museums in the world. Many belong to the [[International Congress of Maritime Museums]], which coordinates members' efforts to acquire, preserve, and display their material. There is a risk that too many maritime museums might dilute the experience for the public, while a poorly managed museum might put other municipalities off from the idea of hosting such a museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =St. Jacques| first =Robert| title =Naval Warship Museums Problems And Potentials| publisher =Naval Weapons of the World| date =1 October 2000| url =http://www.navweaps.com/index_tech/museum1.htm| accessdate = 23 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At {{convert|19|acre|m2}}, [[Mystic Seaport]] in Mystic, Connecticut, US, can lay claim to the title of largest museum; it preserves not only a number of [[sailing ship]]s, but also a large number of original seaport buildings, including a [[ship chandlery]], [[sail loft]], [[ropewalk]], and so forth. However, the [[United Kingdom|UK]]'s [[National Maritime Museum]] in Greenwich is also a contender, with many items of great historical significance, such as the actual uniform worn by [[Horatio Nelson]] at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]].

A recent activity of maritime museums is to build replicas of ships, since there are few survivors that have not already been restored and put on display. Another is operating a [[museum harbour]], most notably in [[Germany]] and the [[Netherlands]] but elsewhere too, that offers mooring to privately owned historical vessels, which can be watched but not boarded.

== Preservation of ships ==
The preservation of ships in museums ensures that ancient and historic vessels are preserved for posterity in optimum conditions and are available for academic study and for public education and interest.

Remains of ancient and historic ships and boats can be seen in [[museum]]s around the world. Where a ship is in a good state of preservation it can sometimes act as a museum in its own right. Many [[museum ships]], such as [[HMS Victory]] are popular tourist attractions. Some ships are too fragile to be exposed outdoors or are incomplete and must be preserved indoors. The remains of the [[Mary Rose]] for example are kept in a purpose designed building so that conservation treatment can be applied.

In some cases, archaeologists have discovered traces of ships and boats where there are no extant physical remains to be preserved, such as [[Sutton Hoo]], where museum displays can show what the vessel would have looked like, although the vessel itself no longer exists.

{{For|other natural history museums|List of natural history museums}}
The '''Natural History Museum''' in London is a [[natural history museum]] that exhibits a vast range of specimens from various segments of [[natural history]]. It is one of three major [[museum]]s on [[Exhibition Road]] in [[South Kensington]], the others being the [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]] and the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]. The Natural History Museum's main frontage, however, is on [[Cromwell Road]].

The museum is home to life and earth science specimens comprising some 80 million items within five main collections: [[botany]], [[entomology]], [[mineralogy]], [[paleontology]] and [[zoology]]. The museum is a centre of research specialising in [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], identification and conservation. Given the age of the institution, many of the collections have great historical as well as scientific value, such as specimens collected by [[Charles Darwin]]. The museum is particularly famous for its exhibition of [[dinosaur]] skeletons and ornate architecture—sometimes dubbed a ''cathedral of nature''—both exemplified by the large ''[[Diplodocus]]'' cast that dominated the vaulted central hall before it was replaced in 2017 with the skeleton of a blue whale hanging from the ceiling. The Natural History Museum Library contains extensive books, journals, manuscripts, and artwork collections linked to the work and research of the scientific departments; access to the library is by appointment only. The museum is recognised as the pre-eminent centre of natural history and research of related fields in the world.

Although commonly referred to as the Natural History Museum, it was officially known as '''British Museum (Natural History)''' until 1992, despite legal separation from the [[British Museum]] itself in 1963. Originating from collections within the British Museum, the landmark [[Alfred Waterhouse]] building was built and opened by 1881 and later incorporated the [[Geological Museum]]. The Darwin Centre is a more recent addition, partly designed as a modern facility for storing the valuable collections.

Like other publicly funded national museums in the United Kingdom, the Natural History Museum does not charge an admission fee. (It did but was scrapped in 2001) &lt;ref&gt;{https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1331446/Natural-History-Museum-scraps-9-fee.html&lt;/ref&gt;
The museum is an [[exempt charity]] and a [[non-departmental public body]] sponsored by the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/about-us/corporate-information/museum-governance/index.html |title=Museum governance |publisher=The Natural History Museum |accessdate=14 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge]] is a patron of the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.today.com/news/duchess-kate-become-patron-three-new-charities-6C9539365|title=Duchess Kate to become patron of three new charities|first1=Lily |last1=Harrison |first2=Lindsey |last2=Caldwell|work=Today News|date=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are approximately 850 staff at the Museum. The two largest strategic groups are the Public Engagement Group and Science Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/about-us/museum-information/index.html|title=Our vision|work=nhm.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation of the collection was that of the Ulster doctor Sir [[Hans Sloane]] (1660–1753), who allowed his significant collections to be purchased by the British Government at a price well below their market value at the time. This purchase was funded by a lottery. Sloane's collection, which included dried plants, and animal and human skeletons, was initially housed in [[Montagu House, Bloomsbury]], in 1756, which was the home of the [[British Museum]].

Most of the Sloane collection had disappeared by the early decades of the nineteenth century. Dr [[George Shaw]] (Keeper of Natural History 1806–13) sold many specimens to the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England|Royal College of Surgeons]] and had periodic ''cremations'' of material in the grounds of the museum. His successors also applied to the trustees for permission to destroy decayed specimens.&lt;ref name="leach"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harrison|first1=Keith|last2=Smith|first2=Eric|title=Rifle-Green by Nature: A Regency Naturalist and his Family, William Elford Leach|date=2008|publisher=Ray Society|location=London|isbn=9780903874359|pages=265–266}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1833 the Annual Report states that, of the 5,500 insects listed in the Sloane catalogue, none remained. The inability of the natural history departments to conserve its specimens became notorious: the Treasury refused to entrust it with specimens collected at the government's expense. Appointments of staff were bedevilled by gentlemanly favoritism; in 1862 a nephew of the mistress of a Trustee was appointed Entomological Assistant despite not knowing the difference between a butterfly and a moth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gunther|first1=Albert E.|title=A Century of Zoology at the British Museum through the Lives of Two Keepers, 1815–1914|date=1975|publisher=Dawsons|location=London|isbn=9780712906180}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gunther|first1=Albert E.|title=The Founders of Science at the British Museum, 1753–1900|date=1980|publisher=Halesworth Press|location=Halesworth, Suffolk|isbn=9780950727608}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verification needed|date=November 2014}}&lt;!--Remarkable if true: embarrassing if hoax. Exact pages and quote(s) needed here.--&gt;

[[J. E. Gray]] (Keeper of Zoology 1840–74) complained of the incidence of mental illness amongst staff: George Shaw threatened to put his foot on any shell not in the [[12th edition of Systema Naturae|12th edition]] of [[Linnaeus]]' ''[[Systema Naturae]]''; another had removed [[museum label|all the labels]] and registration numbers from [[entomological]] cases arranged by a rival. The huge collection of the [[conchologist]] [[Hugh Cuming]] was acquired by the museum, and Gray's own wife had carried the open trays across the courtyard in a gale: all the labels blew away. That collection is said never to have recovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barber|first1=Lynn|title=The Heyday of Natural History: 1829–1870|date=1980|publisher=Cape|location=London|isbn=9780224014489|chapter=Omnium Gatherum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Principal Librarian at the time was [[Antonio Panizzi]]; his contempt for the natural history departments and for science in general was total. The general public was not encouraged to visit the Museum's natural history exhibits. In 1835 to a Select Committee of Parliament, Sir [[Henry Ellis (librarian)|Henry Ellis]] said this policy was fully approved by the Principal Librarian and his senior colleagues.

Many of these faults were corrected by the [[palaeontologist]] [[Richard Owen]], appointed Superintendent of the natural history departments of the British Museum in 1856. His changes led [[Bill Bryson]] to write that "by making the Natural History Museum an institution for everyone, Owen transformed our expectations of what museums are for".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bryson|first1=Bill|authorlink1=Bill Bryson|title=A Short History of Nearly Everything|date=2003|publisher=Doubleday|location=London|isbn=9780385408189|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yRuICgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT88#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Planning and architecture of new building===
[[File:DSC00669 - Copy.jpg|thumb|left|Detail from facade of Natural History Museum, London]]
Owen saw that the natural history departments needed more space, and that implied a separate building as the British Museum site was limited. Land in South Kensington was purchased, and in 1864 a competition was held to design the new museum. The winning entry was submitted by the civil engineer Captain [[Francis Fowke]], who died shortly afterwards. The scheme was taken over by [[Alfred Waterhouse]] who substantially revised the agreed plans, and designed the façades in his own idiosyncratic [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style which was inspired by his frequent visits to the Continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.architecture.com/LibraryDrawingsAndPhotographs/Albertopolis/TheStoryOf/NaturalHistoryMuseum/Interior.aspx| title=Interior of the NHM| publisher=[[Royal Institute of British Architects]]| accessdate=14 December 2010| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119053417/http://www.architecture.com/LibraryDrawingsAndPhotographs/Albertopolis/TheStoryOf/NaturalHistoryMuseum/Interior.aspx| archivedate=19 January 2012| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original plans included wings on either side of the main building, but these plans were soon abandoned for budgetary reasons. The space these would have occupied are now taken by the Earth Galleries and Darwin Centre.

Work began in 1873 and was completed in 1880. The new museum opened in 1881, although the move from the old museum was not fully completed until 1883.

Both the interiors and exteriors of the Waterhouse building make extensive use of [[terracotta]] tiles to resist the sooty atmosphere of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] London, manufactured by the Tamworth-based company of [[Gibbs and Canning Limited]]. The tiles and bricks feature many relief sculptures of flora and fauna, with living and extinct species featured within the west and east wings respectively. This explicit separation was at the request of Owen, and has been seen as a statement of his contemporary rebuttal of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin's]] attempt to link present species with past through the theory of [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/visit-us/history-architecture/architecture-tour/design/decoration/index.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608182831/http://www.nhm.ac.uk/visit-us/history-architecture/architecture-tour/design/decoration/index.html|title=Decoration|archivedate=8 June 2011|work=nhm.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The central axis of the museum is aligned with the tower of [[Imperial College London]] (formerly the Imperial Institute) and the [[Royal Albert Hall]] and [[Albert Memorial]] further north. These all form part of the complex known colloquially as [[Albertopolis]].'''

===Separation from the British Museum===
Even after the opening, the Natural History Museum legally remained a department of the British Museum with the formal name '''British Museum (Natural History)''', usually abbreviated in the [[scientific literature]] as ''B.M.(N.H.)''. A petition to the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] was made in 1866, signed by the heads of the [[Royal Society|Royal]], [[Linnean Society|Linnean]] and [[Zoological Society of London|Zoological]] Societies as well as naturalists including [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], [[Alfred Russel Wallace|Wallace]] and [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Huxley]], asking that the museum gain independence from the board of the British Museum, and heated discussions on the matter continued for nearly one hundred years. Finally, with the passing of the [[British Museum Act 1963]], the British Museum (Natural History) became an independent museum with its own Board of Trustees, although – despite a proposed amendment to the act in the [[House of Lords]] – the former name was retained. In 1989 the museum publicly re-branded itself as The Natural History Museum and effectively stopped using the title British Museum (Natural History) on its advertising and its books for general readers. Only with the [[Museums and Galleries Act 1992]] did the Museum's formal title finally change to the '''Natural History Museum'''.

===Geological Museum===
{{Main|Geological Museum}}
[[File:Globespin.jpg|thumb|left|The spinning globe in 1996]]
In 1986, the museum absorbed the adjacent [[Geological Museum]] of the [[British Geological Survey]], which had long competed for the limited space available in the area. The Geological Museum became world-famous for exhibitions including an active volcano model and an earthquake machine (designed by James Gardner), and housed the world's first computer-enhanced exhibition (''Treasures of the Earth''). The museum's galleries were completely rebuilt and relaunched in 1996 as ''The Earth Galleries'', with the other exhibitions in the Waterhouse building retitled ''The Life Galleries''. The Natural History Museum's own Mineralogy displays remain largely unchanged as an example of the 19th-century display techniques of the Waterhouse building.

The central atrium design by Neal Potter overcame visitors' reluctance to visit the upper galleries by "pulling" them through a model of the Earth made up of random plates on an escalator. The new design covered the walls in recycled slate and sandblasted the major stars and planets onto the wall. The Museum's 'star' geological exhibits are displayed within the walls. Six iconic figures are the backdrop to discussing how previous generations have viewed Earth. These were later removed to make place for a [[Stegosaurus]] skeleton that was put on display in late 2015.

===The Darwin Centre===
[[File:NHMDarwinCentreTankRoom.jpg|thumb|right|Backstage at the NHM. The Tank Room within Darwin Centre Phase 1 holds larger fish from the spirit collection, and preparation facilities for them.]]
The Darwin Centre (named after [[Charles Darwin]]) was designed as a new home for the museum's collection of tens of millions of preserved specimens, as well as new work spaces for the museum's scientific staff, and new educational visitor experiences. Built in two distinct phases, with two new buildings adjacent to the main Waterhouse building, it is the most significant new development project in the museum's history.

Phase one of the Darwin Centre opened to the public in 2002, and it houses the [[zoological]] department's 'spirit collections'—organisms preserved in [[alcohol]]. Phase Two was unveiled in September 2008 and opened to the general public in September 2009. It was designed by the Danish architecture practice [[C. F. Møller Architects]] in the shape of a giant, eight-story [[Cocoon (silk)|cocoon]] and houses the [[entomology]] and [[botanical]] collections—the 'dry collections'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7594295.stm|title=Museum 'cocoon' prepares to open |work=BBC News|accessdate=20 January 2009|date=2 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible for members of the public to visit and view non-exhibited items behind the scenes for a fee by booking onto one of the several Spirit Collection Tours offered daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/events/behind-the-scenes-tour-the-spirit-collection.html|title=Behind-the-Scenes Tour: Spirit Collection {{!}} Natural History Museum|website=www.nhm.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Arguably the most famous creature in the centre is the 8.62-metre-long [[giant squid]], affectionately named Archie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/about-us/news/2006/feb/news_5255.html|title=Giant squid goes on display|work=nhm.ac.uk|access-date=14 March 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060420195441/http://www.nhm.ac.uk/about-us/news/2006/feb/news_5255.html|archive-date=20 April 2006|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Attenborough Studio===
[[File:Nature Live at the Natural History Museum.jpg|thumb|Nature Live event in the Attenborough Studio, Natural History Museum, on 23 January 2012.]]
As part of the museum's remit to communicate science education and conservation work, a new multimedia studio will form an important part of Darwin Centre Phase 2. In collaboration with the [[BBC Natural History Unit|BBC's Natural History Unit]] (holder of the largest archive of natural history footage) the Attenborough Studio—named after the broadcaster Sir [[David Attenborough]]—provides a multimedia environment for educational events. The studio plans to continue the daily lectures and demonstrations.

== Major specimens and exhibits ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Blue Whale]] --&gt;
[[File:Blue-Whale-Balaenoptera musculus-NHM-2017-PNG-001.png|thumb|left|A [[Blue Whale]] skeleton installed in Hintze Hall, 2017]]
[[File:Large Mammal Room.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A balcony view of the Large Mammals Hall]]
One of the most famous and certainly most prominent of the exhibits—nicknamed "[[Dippy (London)|Dippy]]"—is a {{convert|105|ft|m|sing=on}}-long replica of a ''[[Diplodocus|Diplodocus carnegii]]'' skeleton which was on display for many years within the central hall. The cast was given as a gift by the Scottish-American industrialist [[Andrew Carnegie]], after a discussion with King [[Edward VII]], then a keen trustee of the British Museum. Carnegie paid £2,000 for the casting, copying [[Dippy (Pittsburgh)|the original]] held at the [[Carnegie Museum of Natural History]]. The pieces were sent to London in 36 crates, and on 12 May 1905, the exhibit was unveiled to great public and media interest. The real fossil had yet to be mounted, as the Carnegie Museum in Pittsburgh was still being constructed to house it. As word of Dippy spread, Mr Carnegie paid to have additional copies made for display in most major European capitals and in Latin and South America, making Dippy the most-viewed dinosaur skeleton in the world. The dinosaur quickly became an iconic representation of the museum, and has featured in many cartoons and other media, including the 1975 Disney comedy ''[[One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing]]''.  After 112 years on display at the museum, the dinosaur replica was removed in early 2017 to be replaced by the actual skeleton of a young [[blue whale]]. Dippy is due to start a tour of British museums in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jan/01/dippy-diplodocus-london-tour-replica-dinosaur-whale-natural-history-museum |title=Dippy’s last days: diplodocus leaves London after 112 years for farewell UK tour |first=Tracy |last=McVeigh |work=The Observer |date= 1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph 2017"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/04/dippy-diplodocus-bids-farewell-public-natural-history-museum/ |title=Dippy the Diplodocus bids farewell to his public at the Natural History Museum |first=George|last= Fuller|date=4 January 2017 |work=The Daily Telegraph }}&lt;/ref&gt;


The blue whale skeleton that has replaced Dippy is another prominent display in the museum. The display of the skeleton, some 25 m long and weighing 10 tons, was only made possible in 1934 with the building of the '''New Whale Hall''' (now the '''Large Mammals Hall'''). The whale had been in storage for 42 years since its stranding on sandbanks at the mouth of [[Wexford Harbour]], Ireland in March 1891 after being injured by whalers.&lt;ref name="telegraph 2017"/&gt; Discussion of the idea of a life-size model also began around this time, and work was undertaken within the Whale Hall itself. Since taking a cast of such a large animal was deemed prohibitively expensive, scale models were used to meticulously piece the structure together. During construction, workmen left a trapdoor within the whale's stomach, which they would use for surreptitious cigarette breaks. Before the door was closed and sealed forever, some coins and a telephone directory were placed inside—this soon growing to an [[urban myth]] that a [[time capsule]] was left inside. The work was completed—entirely within the hall and in view of the public—in 1938. At the time it was the largest such model in the world, at 28.3 m in length. The construction details were later borrowed by several American museums, who scaled the plans further. The work involved in removing Dippy and replacing it with the whale skeleton was documented in a [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] Television special, ''[[Horizon (UK TV series)|Horizon]]: Dippy and the Whale'', narrated by [[David Attenborough]], which was first broadcast on [[BBC Two]] on 13 July 2017, the day before the whale skeleton was unveiled for public display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Dippy_and_the_Whale|title=Dippy and the Whale|publisher=DocuWiki|date=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;



The Darwin Centre is host to [[Archie (squid)|Archie]], an eight-metre-long [[giant squid]] taken alive in a fishing net near the [[Falkland Islands]] in 2004. The squid is not on general display, but stored in the large tank room in the basement of the Phase 1 building. On arrival at the museum, the specimen was immediately frozen while preparations commenced for its permanent storage. Since few complete and reasonably fresh examples of the species exist, "wet storage" was chosen, leaving the squid undissected. A 9.45-metre acrylic tank was constructed (by the same team that provide tanks to [[Damien Hirst]]), and the body preserved using a mixture of [[formalin]] and [[saline solution]].

The museum holds the remains and bones of the "[[River Thames whale]]", a [[northern bottlenose whale]] that lost its way on 20 January 2006 and swam into the Thames. Although primarily used for research purposes, and held at the museum's storage site at [[Wandsworth]], the skeleton has been put on temporary public display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/about-us/news/2007/january/news_10254.html|title=First ever display of Thames whale skeleton|work=nhm.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dinocochlea]], one of the longer-standing mysteries of paleontology (originally thought to be a giant [[gastropod shell]], then a [[coprolite]] and now a [[concretion]] of a worm's tunnel), has been part of the collection since its discovery in 1921.

The museum keeps a wildlife garden on its west lawn, on which a potentially new species of insect resembling [[Arocatus roeselii]] was discovered in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/story/618991/mystery-insect-bugs-experts|title=Mystery Insect Bugs Experts|publisher=Sky news|date=15 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and research==
[[File:NaturalHistoryMuseumLondon.jpg|thumb|upright|A young student at the Museum]] 
The museum runs a series of [[Museum education|educational]] and public engagement programmes. These include for example a highly praised "How Science Works" hands on workshop for school students demonstrating the use of microfossils in geological research. The museum also played a major role in securing designation of the [[Jurassic Coast]] of [[Devon]] and [[Dorset]] as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage site]] and has subsequently been a lead partner in the [[Lyme Regis]] Fossil Festivals.

In 2005, the museum launched a project to develop notable gallery characters to patrol display cases, including 'facsimiles' of luminaries such as [[Carl Linnaeus]], [[Mary Anning]], [[Dorothea Bate]] and [[William Smith (geologist)|William Smith]]. They tell stories and anecdotes of their lives and discoveries and aim to surprise visitors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/prehistoric/reviews/05_11_shindler.htm Review by Miles Russell] of ''Discovering Dorothea: the Life of the Pioneering Fossil-Hunter Dorothea Bate'' by Karolyn Shindler at ucl.ac.uk (accessed 23 November 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 a six-part [[BBC]] documentary series was filmed at the museum entitled ''[[Museum of Life (documentary)|Museum of Life]]'' exploring the history and ''behind the scenes'' aspects of the museum.&lt;ref name="Museum of Life"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/museum-of-life/episode-six/index.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830090305/http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/museum-of-life/index.html | archivedate=30 August 2010 | title=Museum of Life | accessdate=5 January 2011 | year=2010 | publisher=The Natural History Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since May 2001 the Natural History Museum admission is free for most of the exhibitions. However, there are certain temporary exhibits and shows that would entail a fee.

&lt;!--This is not a balanced 'summary style' report of the research at the museum, but (WP:UNDUE, maybe WP:RECENT) emphasises just one project as if selling it. This isn't what we should be doing here.--&gt;

A connecting bridge between the Natural History and Science museums closed to the public in the late 1990s.

==In fiction==
{{sources|section|date=May 2018}}
The museum is a prominent setting in [[Charlie Fletcher]]'s children's book about unLondon ''[[Stoneheart]]''. George Chapman, the hero, sneaks outside when punished on a school trip; he breaks off a small dragon's stone head from a relief and is chased by a [[pterodactyl]] which comes to life from a statue on the roof.

The museum is the primary setting for Rattle His Bones, the 8th Daisy Dalrymple Mystery by ''[[Carola Dunn]]''. The story revolves around a murder and jewel theft occurring during the time Daisy Dalrymple is writing a story about the museum for an American publisher.

The museum plays an important role in the London-based [[Disney]] live-action feature ''[[One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing]]''; the eponymous skeleton is stolen from the museum, and a group of intrepid [[nanny|nannies]] hide inside the mouth of what is supposed to be the Blue Whale model (in fact a specially created prop – the nannies peer out from behind the whale's teeth, but a real Blue Whale is a [[baleen whale]] and has no teeth). Additionally, the film is set in the 1920s, before the Blue Whale model was built.

British fantasy author [[China Miéville]] based the plot of his 2010 novel ''[[Kraken (novel)|Kraken: An Anatomy]]'' around the theft of "Archie" from the museum's Darwin Centre by a mysterious squid cult.

In the 2014 film ''[[Paddington (film)|Paddington]]'' the villain is a taxidermist at the museum. She kidnaps the bear Paddington intending to kill and stuff him, but is thwarted by the Brown family after scenes involving chases inside and on the roof of the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Connor|first1=Joanne|title=On location: Paddington|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/1747ca2a-7a29-11e4-8958-00144feabdc0.html|accessdate=1 January 2015|work=Financial Times|date=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first episode of the third season of the TV series ''[[Penny Dreadful (TV series)|Penny Dreadful]]'' (2014 - 2016), the main character Vanessa Ives ([[Eva Green]]) visited the museum when her psychotherapist told her to "go somewhere different". There, she meets Dr. Alexander Sweet ([[Christian Camargo]]) who is a zoologist and the Director of Zoological Studies. The museum was then frequently seen in the following episodes as Vanessa and Dr. Sweet's relationship flourishes.

==Natural History Museum at Tring==
{{Main|Natural History Museum at Tring}}
The NHM also has an outpost located in [[Tring]], [[Hertfordshire]]. Built by local eccentric
[[Lionel Walter Rothschild]], the NHM took ownership in 1938. In 2007, the museum announced the name would be changed to the '''Natural History Museum at Tring''', though the older name, the Walter Rothschild Zoological Museum is still in widespread use.

The '''Odd Fellows Building and Auditorium''', located at 228—250 Auburn Avenue, N.E.  in the [[Sweet Auburn Historic District]] of [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], are historic buildings built in 1912 and 1913, respectively, as the headquarters of the District Grand Lodge No. 18,  Jurisdiction of Georgia, of the [[Grand United Order of Odd Fellows in America]]. B.S. Ingram was District Grand Master and Dr. William F. Penn was chairman of the building committee. Renowned Atlanta-based architect [[William Augustus Edwards]] designed the buildings, while Robert E. Pharrow was the contractor and M.B. Morton was superintendent of construction.&lt;ref name="waymarking.com"&gt;[http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM3FNE Waymark listing for Odd Fellows Building and Auditorium]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Booker T. Washington]] dedicated the Odd Fellows Building in 1912.&lt;ref name="sweetauburn.us"&gt;[http://sweetauburn.us/oddfellows.htm Sweet Auburn Avenue article on  Odd Fellows Building and Auditorium]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Odd Fellows Building and Auditorium are closely linked with Benjamin Jefferson Davis, Sr. (1870–1945), Atlanta's most influential black journalist, who edited the ''Atlanta Independent'', the official organ of District No. 18. He was District Grand Secretary and a member of the Building Committee when they were built.&lt;ref name="sweetauburn.us"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/GA/Fulton/state3.html National Register listings for Fulton County]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Odd Fellows Building, called the '''Tower''', is 6 stories high while the Auditorium next door, called the '''Annex''', is 2 stories with an [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]] that adds another 2 or 3 stories in height. Both are built of redbrick except for the first floor of the Tower which is stone. The Annex was used for many years as a [[movie house]] and was the only major venue in Atlanta where blacks could be seated on the main floor. In addition to providing meeting and office space for the Odd Fellows, the Tower provided office and store space for black-owned businesses and black professionals. Its flat roof was used for dances for many years.&lt;ref name="waymarking.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sweetauburn.us"/&gt;

On May 2, 1975, both buildings were added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

'''Ratner's''' was a famous [[Jewish]] [[kosher]] [[dairy]] ''(milkhik)'' restaurant on the [[Lower East Side]] of [[New York City]]. Since it did not serve meat in deference to the [[Milk and meat in Jewish law|kosher rule about not mixing milk and meat products]], it was often regarded as a complement to [[Katz's Deli]].{{cn|date=March 2013}}

==Ownership==
Ratner's was founded in 1905 by [[Jacob Harmatz]] and his brother-in-law [[Alex Ratner]], who supposedly flipped a coin to decide whose name would be on the sign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koshertoday.com/history.asp Kosher History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061127170556/http://www.koshertoday.com/history.asp |date=2006-11-27 }}, accessed December 5, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Ratner sold his share in the restaurant to Harmatz in 1918, and it remained in the Harmatz family from then on. Jacob's son, [[Harold Harmatz]], took over the business in the mid-1950s, dying a year after the restaurant ceased operation in 2002.&lt;ref name="lmi"&gt;[http://www.lowermanhattan.info/news/ratner_s_closes__98492.aspx "Ratner's Closes, For the Last Time," ''LowerManhattan.Info''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061003231109/http://www.lowermanhattan.info/news/ratner_s_closes__98492.aspx |date=2006-10-03 }} Dated December 16, 2004; retrieved August 25, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Menu==
[[File:Ratners onion rolls.jpg|thumb|left|A batch of the onion rolls made with the recipe found in "The World-Famous Ratner's Meatless Cookbook".]]
Brunch was the main meal at the dairy restaurant, and up to 1,200 people were served daily at the peak of its popularity. Noted menu items included cheese [[blintzes]], [[potato pancakes]] ''(latkes)'', hot [[onion rolls]], and [[pea soup|split-pea soup]].&lt;ref name="lmi"/&gt;  Other key items were [[gefilte fish]],  poached salmon-in-aspic, [[kasha]] varnishkes, and vegetable [[borsht]]. and many recipes survive in print.{{cn|date=March 2013}} According to "The World-Famous Ratner's Meatless Cookbook", the winner and undisputed champion at Ratner's was its famous onion roll which were featured on every table with every meal.  More than fifteen hundred onion rolls were baked daily, three thousand on Sundays.

==Locations==
The original location was on [[Pitt Street, Manhattan|Pitt Street in Manhattan]], but the restaurant moved in 1918 to its better-known location at 138 [[Delancey Street]], where it remained until its closing. There was also a location at 111 [[Second Avenue (Manhattan)|Second Avenue]], operated by other members of the family.  Until 1975, it was open 24 hours a day and therefore part of the late-night city scene popular with Jewish performers, actors, musicians, and [[gangsters]]. Entertainers [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]], [[Al Jolson]], [[Fanny Brice]], [[Marty Allen (comedian)|Marty Allen]], [[Eydie Gormé]], [[Walter Matthau]], [[Elia Kazan]], [[Max Gordon (producer)|Max Gordon]], [[Groucho Marx]], and [[Alan King (comedian)|Alan King]] were all regular customers, while gangsters [[Bugsy Siegel]] and [[Meyer Lansky]] frequented the Delancey Street location.&lt;ref name="lmi"&gt;[http://www.lowermanhattan.info/news/ratner_s_closes__98492.aspx "Ratner's Closes, For the Last Time," ''LowerManhattan.Info''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061003231109/http://www.lowermanhattan.info/news/ratner_s_closes__98492.aspx |date=2006-10-03 }} Dated December 16, 2004; retrieved August 25, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the closing of the Delancey Street location, a back room at Ratner's was opened as a bar called "Lansky's Lounge," named after the deceased gangster who, according to Robert Harmatz, told the owners he was there so often that he deserved to have his own room.  The lounge has since closed as well{{when|date=March 2013}}, though another bar continues to exist in the space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nymag.com/listings/bar/The-Back-Room/ The Back Room]&lt;/ref&gt;

There was also a Ratner's soup cart that operated on only on weekdays and served a selection of dairy soups.  The cart was located at the corner of 6th Avenue and 46th Street and operated until sometime in the late 1990s.

The Ratner's located at 111 Second Avenue, run by Abraham Harmatz, surpassed the Delancey Street restaurant in popularity for many years, especially during the late 1960s and early 1970s when the [[Lower East Side]] gradually became known as "The [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]]" -- a hip and creative Mecca. Sam Jaffee, the longtime night manager of The Second Avenue Ratner's, worked with [[Fillmore East]] impresario Bill Graham, in stocking the Fillmore's mezzanine food concession with Ratner's baked goods.{{cn|date=March 2013}}

==Products==
A number of products are still manufactured using the Ratner's name by King Kold, which owns the brand, including blintzes, crepes, potato pancakes, veggie pancakes, pierogies, matzo balls, and soups, which are distributed wholesale to supermarkets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kingkold.com/index.php?id=15 King Kold Frozen Foods], accessed December 5, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cookbooks==
In 1975, Jacob Harmatz's daughter, Judith Gethers, and her niece, Elizabeth Lefft, published ''The World Famous Ratner's Meatless Cookbook''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unofficialmadmencookbook.com/blog/ratners-kosher-restaurant-the-harmatz-family-shares-memories-of-the-mad-men-era-a-recipe-and-giveaway/ Ratner’s Kosher Restaurant: The Harmatz Family Shares Memories of the Mad Men era, a recipe and giveaway]&lt;/ref&gt;  Ms. Gethers authored seven cookbooks and assisted other chefs with their publications.

==In popular culture==
An exterior scene of Ratner's is shown in the movie ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'', where Angie and Sal Boca have a sunrise breakfast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://onthesetofnewyork.com/thefrenchconnection.html The FrenchConnection Film Locations]&lt;/ref&gt; Ratner's was also featured at the end of the "Christmas Waltz" episode of ''[[Mad Men]]'', first broadcast on May 20, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unofficialmadmencookbook.com/blog/ratners-kosher-restaurant-the-harmatz-family-shares-memories-of-the-mad-men-era-a-recipe-and-giveaway/ Ratner’s Kosher Restaurant: The Harmatz Family Shares Memories of the Mad Men era, a recipe and giveaway]&lt;/ref&gt;

The exterior of the Second Avenue Ratner's is briefly visible in a 1962 episode of the ''[[Naked City (TV series)|Naked City]]'' TV series entitled "The Face of the Enemy".

Ratner's was also seen in the 2000 movie, "Boiler Room" where the main character Seth, (Giovanni Ribisi) has a meal with his family. An exterior shot shows the front of the restaurant. The interior scene that immediately follows shows Ratner's famous onion rolls on the family's table. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/b/boilerroom.html#.WDkt3GeVs8o&lt;/ref&gt;

A scene in Bringing Out the Dead was filmed here as well. Theodore Peck, the great grandson of Jacob spilled whiskey on a camera.

The British explorer and [[Arabist]] Sir [[Richard Francis Burton]] (1821–1890) published over 40 books and countless articles, monographs and letters. Most of Burton's books are travel narratives and translations. His only works of original imaginative fiction are both in verse: ''Stone Talk'' (1865) and the well-known ''[[The Kasidah]]'' (1880), both of which he published under the pseudonym "Frank Baker".

A great number of Burton's journal and magazine pieces have never been catalogued.

{{Emotion}}

'''''Schadenfreude''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʃ|ɑː|d|ən|f|r|ɔɪ|d|ə}}; {{IPA-de|ˈʃaːdn̩ˌfʁɔʏ̯də|lang|Schadenfreude-native-german.flac}}; {{abbrlink|lit.|literal translation}} 'harm-joy') is the experience of pleasure, joy, or self-satisfaction that comes from learning of or witnessing the troubles, failures, or humiliation of another. It is one of four related emotions or concepts.

Schadenfreude is a complex negative emotion. Rather than feeling sympathy towards someones misfortune, schadenfreude evokes joyful feelings that take pleasure from watching someone fail. This emotion is displayed more in children than adults, however adults also experience schadenfreude, they are just better at concealing their expressions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Paulus |first1=Shannon |title=Schadenfreude is a Childish Emotion |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/schadenfreude-childish-emotion-180952163/ |website=smithsonian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;,

== Etymology ==
''Schadenfreude'' is borrowed from [[German language|German]]; it is a compound of ''Schaden'', "damage, harm", and ''Freude'', "joy". The German word was first mentioned in English texts in 1852 and 1867, and first used in English running text in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 1982, [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/172271 ''s.v.'']&lt;/ref&gt; In German, it was first attested in the 1740s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?q=%22schadenfreude%22&amp;lr=lang_de&amp;source=lnt&amp;tbs=lr%3Alang_1de%2Ccdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3A1%2F1%2F1600%2Ccd_max%3A12%2F31%2F1750&amp;tbm=bks Google Books] (the 1659 and 1700 dates are incorrect)&lt;/ref&gt;

Though [[Proper noun|common nouns]] are normally not capitalised in English, ''Schadenfreude'' is sometimes capitalised following the German [[German orthography#Spelling of nouns|convention]].

==What motivates schadenfreude==
Researchers have found that there are three driving forces behind schadenfreude: aggression, rivalry, and justice. The people who experience schadenfreude usually have low self esteem. Seeing another person fail brings them a small surge of confidence. Whereas, seeing someone who is successful poses as a threat to their sense of self and seeing the 'mighty' fall can be a source of comfort&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hendricks |first1=Scotty |title=3 types of Schadenfreude and when you feel them |url=https://bigthink.com/mind-brain/schadenfreude-and-psychopathy}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

*Schadenfreude that is agression based involves group identity. With aggression based schadenfreude, it involves a group such as a team or family.

*Rivalry schadenfreude is individualistic. It happens when a person goes out of their way to dominate another persons actions in order to see them fail.

*Justice based schadenfreude is the type of joy a person experiences when someone gets busted for doing something wrong. For example, a successful person who cheats and robs finally gets caught for his wrongdoing, the schadenfreude experienced here would be justice.

== Synonyms ==
''Schadenfreude'' has equivalents in other languages (for example, German, Dutch, Arabic, Hebrew, Bangla, Czech, Norwegian and Finnish), but no commonly used precise English single-word equivalent. There are other ways to express the concept in English.

"[[Tall poppy syndrome]]" is a cultural phenomenon where people of high status are resented, attacked, cut down, or criticized because they have been classified as better than their peers. This is similar to begrudgery, the resentment or envy of the success of a peer. If someone were to feel joy by the victim’s fall from grace, they would be experiencing ''Schadenfreude''.

A "Roman holiday" is a metaphor from [[George Gordon, Lord Byron|Byron's]] poem ''[[Childe Harold's Pilgrimage]]'', where a [[gladiator]] in [[ancient Rome]] expects to be "butchered to make a Roman holiday" while the audience would take pleasure from watching his suffering. The term suggests debauchery and disorder in addition to sadistic enjoyment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Roman%20holiday |title=Roman holiday – Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2007-04-25 |accessdate=2010-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Morose delectation" (''delectatio morosa'' in [[Latin language|Latin]]), meaning "the habit of dwelling with enjoyment on evil thoughts".&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/adorai/oed/morose definition of morose delectation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414034751/http://web.mit.edu/adorai/oed/morose |date=April 14, 2016}}, ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt; was considered by the medieval church to be a sin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2074.htm#6 ''Prima Secundae Partis, Q. 74''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160702011344/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2074.htm#6 |date=July 2, 2016}}, ''The [[Summa Theologica]] of St. [[Thomas Aquinas]]'', Second and Revised Edition, 1920; Literally translated by Fathers of the English Dominican Province, Online Edition Copyright © 2006 by Kevin Knight.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RPUuyWtO3eoC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;dq=%22morose+delectation%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=QpmslAISN-&amp;sig=nL01zLP7iH1kR44-MBqhOGJilsc#PPA139,M1 ''Chapter 6 Proposing the Story of the World''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827225210/https://books.google.com/books?id=RPUuyWtO3eoC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;dq=%22morose+delectation%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=QpmslAISN-&amp;sig=nL01zLP7iH1kR44-MBqhOGJilsc#PPA139,M1 |date=August 27, 2016}}, Richard John Neuhaus, Catholic Matters: Confusion, Controversy, and the Splendor of Truth, Basic Books, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[France|French]] writer [[Pierre Klossowski]] maintained that the appeal of [[Sadomasochism|sadism]] is morose delectation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minerva.mic.ul.ie//vol10/Religion.html ''Heterodox Religion and Post-Atheism: Bataille / Klossowski/ Foucault''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426064629/http://www.minerva.mic.ul.ie/ |date=April 26, 2016}}, Jones Irwin, ISSN 1393-614X Minerva – An Internet Journal of Philosophy Vol. 10 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Klossowski|Klossowski, Pierre]]. 1991.

"Gloating" is an English word of similar meaning, where "[[gloat]]" means "to observe or think about something with triumphant and often malicious satisfaction, gratification, or delight" (e.g., to gloat over an enemy's misfortune).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gloat "Dictionary definition of gloat"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827125609/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gloat |date=August 27, 2016}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Gloating is different from ''Schadenfreude'' in that it does not necessarily require malice (one may gloat to a friend about having defeated him in a game without ill intent), and that it describes an action rather than a state of mind (one typically gloats to the subject of the misfortune or to a third party). Also, unlike ''Schadenfreude'', where the focus is on another's misfortune, gloating often brings to mind inappropriately celebrating or bragging about one's own good fortune without any particular focus on the misfortune of others.

== Related emotions or concepts ==
Permutations of the concept of pleasure at another's unhappiness are: pleasure at another's happiness, displeasure at another's happiness, and displeasure at another's unhappiness. Words for these concepts are sometimes cited as [[antonym]]s to ''Schadenfreude'', as each is the [[opposite (semantics)|opposite]] in some way.

Pleasure at another's happiness is described by the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] concept of ''[[mudita]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muditajournal.com/archives/000266.php ''The Upside of Shadenfreude''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413072532/http://www.muditajournal.com/archives/000266.php |date=April 13, 2016}}, Joshua Zader, Mudita Journal, December 6, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sirtumble.blogspot.com/2005/02/are-you-schadenfreude-or-mudita.html ''Are you Schadenfreude or Mudita?''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311235315/http://sirtumble.blogspot.com/2005/02/are-you-schadenfreude-or-mudita.html |date=March 11, 2016}}, Sirtumble, One of Six Billion..., February 6, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nell |first1=Regen |title=Regen |journal=Iowa City Public Library and the International Writing Program Panel Series |date=September 16, 2011 |url=https://iwp.uiowa.edu/sites/iwp/files/Regan_ICPL2011_0.pdf |accessdate=17 July 2017 |ref=https://iwp.uiowa.edu/ |series=The International Writing Program |publisher=University of Iowa}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the concept of "[[compersion]]" in the [[polyamory]] community.

Displeasure at another's happiness is involved in [[envy]], and perhaps in [[jealousy]]. The recent coinage "freudenschade" similarly means sorrow at another's success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://groups.yahoo.com/group/wwftd/message/1226 |title=Yahoo Groups "worthless word for the day is ... freudenschade" |publisher=Groups.yahoo.com |accessdate=2010-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080513182307/http://daily.stanford.edu/article/2006/4/28/freudenschade Daily Stanford (2006) "Freudenschade"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Displeasure at another's unhappiness is [[sympathy]], [[pity]], or [[compassion]].

"[[Sadistic personality disorder|Sadism]]" is pleasure derived from the ''infliction'' of pain, whereas schadenfreude is pleasure on ''observing'' misfortune and in particular the fact that the other somehow deserved the misfortune.&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Ben-Ze'ev, "The personal comparative concern in schadenfreude" in Wilco W. can Dijk, Jaap W. Ouwerkerk, eds., ''Schadenfreude: Understanding Pleasure at the Misfortune of Others'', Cambridge 2014, {{ISBN|1107017505}}, p. 86''f''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Neologisms and variants ==
[[Neologisms]] and [[portmanteau]] words were coined from the word as early as 1993, when Lincoln Caplan, in his book ''Skadden: Power, Money, and the Rise of a Legal Empire'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Latest activity 19 hours ago |title=Skadden: Power, Money, and the Rise of a Legal Empire (9780374524241): Lincoln Caplan: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |isbn=0374524246}}&lt;/ref&gt; used the word ''Skaddenfreude'' to describe the delight that competitors of [[Skadden Arps]] took in its troubles of the early 1990s. Others include ''spitzenfreude'', coined by ''[[The Economist]]'' to refer to the fall of [[Eliot Spitzer prostitution scandal|Eliot Spitzer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/world/unitedstates/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10852872 |title=Premium content |publisher=Economist.com |date=2008-03-13 |accessdate=2010-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Schadenford'', coined by ''[[Toronto Life]]'' in regard to Canadian politician [[Rob Ford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=When the Ford jokes stop |author=Bartley Kives |url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/opinion/columnists/when-the-ford-jokes-stop-208982891.html |newspaper=[[Winnipeg Free Press]] |date=26 May 2013 |accessdate=26 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literary usage and philosophical analysis ==
The [[Book of Proverbs]] mentions an emotion similar to ''Schadenfreude'': "Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth: Lest the LORD see it, and it displease him, and he turn away his wrath from him." (Proverbs 24:17–18, [[King James Version]]).

In the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', [[Aristotle]] used ''epikhairekakia'' (ἐπιχαιρεκακία in Greek) as part of a triad of terms, in which ''epikhairekakia'' stands as the opposite of ''[[phthonos]]'' (φθόνος), and ''[[Archenemy|nemesis]]'' (νέμεσις) occupies the mean. ''Nemesis'' is "a painful response to another's undeserved good fortune", while ''phthonos'' is a painful response to any good fortune, deserved or not. The ''epikhairekakos'' (ἐπιχαιρέκακος) person takes pleasure in another's ill fortune.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pedrick |first=Victoria |authorlink= |author2=Oberhelman, Steven M. |year=2006 |title=The Soul of Tragedy: Essays on Athenian Drama |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago, IL |isbn=978-0-226-65306-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Page:The ethics of Aristotle.djvu/68|''Nicomachean Ethics'', 2.7.1108b1-10]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lucretius]] characterises the emotion in an extended [[simile]] in ''[[De rerum natura]]'': ''Suave, mari magno turbantibus aequora ventis, e terra magnum alterius spectare laborem'', "It is pleasant to watch from the land the great struggle of someone else in a sea rendered great by turbulent winds." The abbreviated [[List of Latin phrases|Latin tag]] ''suave mare magno'' recalled the passage to generations familiar with the Latin classics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrick O'Brian]]'s usage of the tag in his Aubrey-Maturin historical novels is reflected in Dean King's companion lexicon ''A Sea of Words'' (3rd ed.2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Caesarius of Heisterbach]] regards "delight in the adversity of a neighbour" as one of the "daughters of envy ... which follows anger" in his ''Dialogue on Miracles''.&lt;ref&gt;''Dialogus miraculorum'', IV, 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[17th century philosophy|17th century]], [[Robert Burton (scholar)|Robert Burton]] wrote in his work ''[[The Anatomy of Melancholy]]'', "Out of these two [the concupiscible and irascible powers] arise those mixed affections and passions of [[anger]], which is a desire of revenge; hatred, which is inveterate anger; zeal, which is offended with him who hurts that he loves; and ἐπιχαιρεκακία, a compound affection of joy and hate, when we rejoice at other men's mischief, and are grieved at their prosperity; [[pride]], [[self-love]], emulation, envy, [[shame]], &amp;c., of which elsewhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=1621 |title=The Anatomy of Melancholy |author=Robert Burton |pages=t. 1, sect. 1, memb. 2, subsect. 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] mentioned ''Schadenfreude'' as the most evil sin of human feeling, famously saying "To feel envy is human, to savor schadenfreude is diabolic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Schopenhauer |first=Arthur |title=The Essays of Arthur Schopenhauer On Human Nature |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/10739/pg10739.html |work=On Human Nature |quote=But it is ''Schadenfreude'', a mischievous delight in the misfortunes of others, which remains the worst trait in human nature. It is a feeling which is closely akin to cruelty, and differs from it, to say the truth, only as theory from practice.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi [[Harold S. Kushner]] in his book ''[[When Bad Things Happen to Good People]]'' describes ''Schadenfreude'' as a universal, even wholesome reaction that cannot be helped. "There is a German psychological term, ''Schadenfreude'', which refers to the embarrassing reaction of relief we feel when something bad happens to someone else instead of to us." He gives examples and writes, "[People] don't wish their friends ill, but they can’t help feeling an embarrassing spasm of gratitude that [the bad thing] happened to someone else and not to them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=1981 |title=When Bad Things Happen to Good People |author=Harold S. Kushner |publisher=first published by Schocken Books |page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Susan Sontag]]'s book ''[[Regarding the Pain of Others]]'', published in 2003, is a study of the issue of how the pain and misfortune of some people affects others, namely whether [[war photography]] and [[War art|war paintings]] may be helpful as anti-war tools, or whether they only serve some sense of ''Schadenfreude'' in some viewers.

[[Philosopher]] and [[sociologist]] [[Theodor Adorno]] defined schadenfreude as "... largely unanticipated delight in the suffering of another, which is cognized as trivial and/or appropriate."&lt;ref&gt;Cited in {{cite book |author=Portmann, John |title=When bad things happen to other people |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=2000 |isbn=0-415-92335-2 |oclc= |doi= |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scientific studies ==
A ''[[New York Times]]'' article in 2002 cited a number of scientific studies of ''Schadenfreude'', which it defined as "delighting in others' misfortune". Many such studies are based on [[social comparison theory]], the idea that when people around us have bad luck, we look better to ourselves. Other researchers have found that people with low [[self-esteem]] are more likely to feel ''Schadenfreude'' than are those who have high self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=St. John |first=Warren |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE3D6153CF937A1575BC0A9649C8B63 |title=Sorrow So Sweet: A Guilty Pleasure in Another's Woe |newspaper=The New York Times |date=24 August 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2003 study examined intergroup ''Schadenfreude'' within the context of sports, specifically an international football (soccer) competition. The study focused on the German and Dutch football teams and their fans. The results of this study indicated that the emotion of''Schadenfreude'' is very sensitive to circumstances that make it more or less legitimate to feel such malicious pleasure towards a sports rival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Leach |first=C. |author2=Spears, R. |author3=Branscombe, N. R. |author4=Doosje, B. |title=Malicious pleasure: Schadenfreude at the suffering of another group |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |year=2003 |volume=84 |issue=5 |pages=932–943 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.84.5.932}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 study by Cikara and colleagues using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) examined ''Schadenfreude'' among [[Boston Red Sox]] and [[New York Yankees]] fans, and found that fans showed increased activation in brain areas correlated with self-reported pleasure ([[ventral striatum]]) when observing the rival team experience a negative outcome (e.g., a [[strikeout]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Us Versus Them Social Identity Shapes Neural Responses to Intergroup Competition and Harm |url=http://pss.sagepub.com/content/22/3/306 |journal=Psychological Science |date=2011-03-01 |issn=0956-7976 |pmc=3833634 |pmid=21270447 |pages=306–313 |volume=22 |issue=3 |doi=10.1177/0956797610397667 |first=Mina |last=Cikara |first2=Matthew M. |last2=Botvinick |first3=Susan T. |last3=Fiske}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, fans exhibited increased activation in the [[Anterior cingulate cortex|anterior cingulate]] and insula when viewing their own team experience a negative outcome.

A 2006 experiment about justice served suggests that men, but not women, enjoy seeing "bad people" suffer. The study was designed to measure empathy, by watching which brain centers are stimulated when subjects observed via fMRI see someone experiencing physical [[pain]]. Researchers expected that the brain's empathy center of subjects would show more stimulation when those seen as "good" got an electric shock, than would occur if the shock was given to someone the subject had reason to consider "bad". This was indeed the case, but for male subjects, the brain's pleasure centers also lit up when someone got a shock that the male thought was "well-deserved".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Singer T |author2=Seymour B |author3=O'Doherty JP |author4=Stephan KE |author5=Dolan RJ |author6=Frith CD |title=Empathic neural responses are modulated by the perceived fairness of others |journal=Nature |volume=439 |issue=7075 |pages=466–9 |date=January 2006 |pmid=16421576 |doi=10.1038/nature04271 |url= |pmc=2636868 |bibcode=2006Natur.439..466S}} [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/19/science/19revenge.html?ex=1139547600&amp;en=5cb415405edddd2e&amp;ei=5070l Lay-summary] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416211358/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/19/science/19revenge.html?ex=1139547600&amp;en=5cb415405edddd2e&amp;ei=5070l |date=April 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brain-scanning studies show that ''Schadenfreude'' is correlated with envy in subjects. Strong feelings of envy activated physical pain nodes in the brain's dorsal [[anterior cingulate cortex]]; the brain's reward centers, such as the [[ventral striatum]], were activated by news that other people envied had suffered misfortune. The magnitude of the brain's ''Schadenfreude'' response could even be predicted from the strength of the previous envy response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/323/5916/937 |journal=Science |date=2009-02-13 |title=When Your Gain Is My Pain and Your Pain Is My Gain: Neural Correlates of Envy and Schadenfreude |doi=10.1126/science.1165604 |last1=Takahashi |first1=H. |last2=Kato |first2=M. |last3=Matsuura |first3=M. |last4=Mobbs |first4=D. |last5=Suhara |first5=T. |last6=Okubo |first6=Y. |volume=323 |issue=5916 |pages=937–9 |pmid=19213918 |bibcode=2009Sci...323..937T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/17/science/17angi.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=17 February 2009 |title=In Pain and Joy of Envy, the Brain May Play a Role |first=Natalie |last=Angier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted in 2009 provides evidence for people's capacity to feel ''Schadenfreude'' in response to negative events in politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Combs |first=D. J. Y.|author2=Powell, C. A. J. |author3=Schurtz, D. R. |author4=Smith, R. H. |title=Politics, schadenfreude, and ingroup identification: The sometimes happy things about a poor economy and death |journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology |year=2009 |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=635–646 |url=http://spp.sagepub.com/content/3/1/63.full.pdf |doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2009.02.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study was designed to determine whether or not there was a possibility that events containing objective misfortunes might produce ''Schadenfreude''. It was reported in the study that the likelihood of experiencing feelings of ''Schadenfreude'' depends upon whether an individual's own party or the opposing party is suffering harm. This study suggests that the domain of politics is prime territory for feelings of ''Schadenfreude'', especially for those who identify strongly with their political party.

'''Soundrangers''' was the first online sound library of original [[sound effects]] and [[production music]] designed for specifically for [[interactive media]] such as [[video games]], websites and interactive software. Soundrangers was also one of the first sound effects and [[music libraries]] to pioneer the audition and automated delivery of sound files over the internet. The Emmy Award-winning staff also specializes in custom sound design for interactive media with many major projects and top video game titles to their credit.

==Company history==
Established in 1998 in [[Seattle, Washington]] by Barry Dowsett and Kevin Tone. Working together in the recording industry as sound designers and musicians, they recognized the need for audio content optimized for use in the emerging field of interactive and ‘new’ media. Initially providing custom [[sound design]] and [[Foley (filmmaking)|Foley]] for interactive projects, within months Soundrangers expanded their focus to include the development of a library of original [[sound effects]] and [[production music]] designed and optimized to easily integrate into [[interactive media]]. This library was designed from the beginning for audition and download over the [[internet]] at  [http://www.soundrangers.com/ Soundrangers.com], allowing interactive developers a resource for quickly finding and implementing audio content into their projects using content pre-rendered to the specifications of interactive development.

As one of the earliest companies delivering sound files over the internet, Soundrangers pioneered several features common today in the online delivery of audio content including the individual auditioning of sound files through its [[Adobe Flash]] interface and the automated delivery of content via download with selectable file format, sample and bit rate. All Soundrangers content is built and offered exclusively through the Soundrangers website creating a clear licensing path for the end user and ensuring the continuity of quality across the entire library.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6824">In [[library science]], '''special collections''' ('''Spec. Coll.''' or '''S.C.''') are libraries or library units that house materials requiring specialized security and user services.

Materials housed in special collections can be in any format (including [[rare books]], [[manuscripts]], [[photographs]], [[archives]], [[ephemera]], and digital records), and are generally characterized by their [[Digital artifactual value#Intrinsic value in analog materials|artifactual]] or [[Monetary value#Explanations of Value|monetary value]], physical format, uniqueness or rarity, and/or an institutional commitment to long-term [[Preservation (library and archival science)|preservation]] and access.{{sfn|Dooley|2010|page=16}} They can also include association with important figures or institutions in history, culture, politics, sciences, or the arts.{{sfn|ARL Task Force on Special Collections|2003}} 

Individual libraries or archival institutions determine for themselves what constitute their own special collections,{{sfn|Cave|1982|page=11}} resulting in a somewhat mutable definition.{{sfn|Panitch|2001|page=4, 9}} For research libraries, a special collections area or division can be a fundamental part of their mission.{{sfn|ARL Task Force on Special Collections|2002}} Some special collections are standalone institutions that are privately funded, such as the [[Newberry Library]] or the [[American Antiquarian Society]] while others are part of a larger institution, such as the [[Beinecke Library]] at Yale University. Many American university special collections grew out of the merging of rare book rooms and manuscripts departments in a university's library system.

In contrast to general (or circulating) libraries, the uniqueness of special collections means that they are not easily replaced (if at all) and therefore require a higher level of security and handling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.umd.edu/special/research/define/special.html "Research Using Primary Sources: Special Collections," University of Maryland (accessed 5 February 2016).]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
The primary function of a special collections division is to foster research by providing researchers access to items while ensuring their longevity. Many staff members involved with special collections have either advanced degrees or specialized training related to the collections for which they are responsible.{{sfn|Association of Research Libraries|2008}}

==Storage==
Items in a special collection are usually stored in closed stacks (not directly accessible to library patrons) which contain noncirculating items, meaning that items cannot be loaned or otherwise removed from the premises. Access to materials is usually under supervision. Depending on the policies of an institution holding special collections, researchers may be asked to present identification cards, letters of reference, or other credentials to gain access.{{sfn|ARL Task Force on Special Collections|2003}}

Most special collections are stored in areas in which the [[temperature]], [[humidity]], [[lighting|illumination]], and other environmental conditions are carefully monitored to ensure the integrity of materials, and adequate security is provided to protect the materials from unauthorized access, theft, and vandalism.

Offsite storage facilities have become increasingly popular among institutions holding special collections. Most libraries consider it their mandate to maintain acquisition of new collections, although the limitations of their physical plants may not be able to handle all that is acquired. Storing materials offsite allows flexibility in how libraries design and apportion their space and provides security for materials.  The 2010 "Taking Our Pulse" report cites a survey in which 67% of responding institutions use offsite facilities, with another 5% in planning stages.{{sfn|Dooley|2010|p=32}}

==Reading room characteristics==
Special [[Reference library|reading room]]s are often provided to minimize the risk to holdings while being consulted by patrons, which are sometimes monitored by library personnel who also provide reference assistance and relay requests for materials. Rules often apply to use of materials in order to protect against inadvertent damage; Writing implements which use [[ink]] are very commonly prohibited, as well as flash photography, use of mobile phones, and the presence of food and beverages. Protective gloves are sometimes required when consulting particularly delicate materials, photographs, and metal objects, and many libraries may require that books be read only while resting in special cradles.

'''''Sports Collectors Digest''''' ('''''SCD''''') is an [[United States|American]] advertising weekly paper published at [[Iola, Wisconsin]].  The magazine provides an avenue through which sellers, traders and avid buyers of [[Sports card|sports memorabilia]] may interact.

''SCD'' was started in 1973 by the Stommen family.  In 1981 it was purchased by [[Krause Publications]]; Krause was acquired by [[F+W Media]], its current publisher, in 2002.

The thickness of the magazine has varied throughout the years, and could arguably be seen as a reflection of the sports collecting market.  For example, the July 13, 1990 issue contained 332 pages; however, the January 22, 2010 issue was only 36 pages long.  Accounts of some athletes of the past and their activities festoon some of the pages.  Other issues are written similarly.  Pages are 11x14 inches (28x35.5&amp;nbsp;cm).

''SCD'' has long billed itself as "The Voice of the Hobby" and mixes hobby news with features, collecting stories, athlete profiles and opinion. The magazine is one of the few publications that have been successful in the sports card and memorabilia hobby. It's accompanying website offers content similar to the magazine, with an Auction Prices Realized database that is the only one of its kind in the hobby. The site also offers videos, blogs, features and a forum.

Classified ads remain a staple of the magazine, although it is rare when classifieds fill a full page. Many collectors have relied on the ''SCD'' classifieds over the years to build and maintain their collections. Before the Internet, it was a major source for buyers and sellers in the hobby to network.

The magazine remains the sports collecting hobby's leading news publication with a loyal subscriber base. ''SCD'' has been effected by the trend toward selling collectibles on the Internet. Issues have shrunk, and the publication rarely features fresh editorial product. In recent issues, editors have recycled 10-year-old, previously-published interviews. Correspondents who provided columns and features were dropped for budgetary reasons and most of the limited editorial content is produced in-house.

The '''striped marlin''' (''Kajikia audax'') is a species of [[marlin]] found in tropical to temperate [[Indo-Pacific]] oceans not far from the surface. It is a desirable commercial and [[game fish]] with a record weight (in 1982) of {{convert|190|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and a maximum length of {{convert|4.2|m|ft|1|abbr=on}}. The striped marlin' is a predator that hunts during the day in the top 100 m or so of the water column, often near the surface. One of their chief prey is sardines.

== Sustainable consumption == 
In 2010, Greenpeace International has added the striped marlin to its seafood red list. &lt;!--"The Greenpeace International seafood red list is a list of fish that are commonly sold in supermarkets around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries." --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/international/seafood/red-list-of-species Greenpeace International Seafood Red list]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14877">The '''TSN Top 50 CFL Players''' was a list of the greatest fifty [[Canadian Football League]] players, as selected by a panel of sixty former CFL players, then-current and former coaches, executives, and media members in [[2006 CFL season|2006]]. The panel was assembled by sports television network [[The Sports Network|TSN]] in partnership with the CFL. The results were announced as part of the [[2006 Grey Cup]] festivities in [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]].

==The Top 50==
The panel voted on a list of 185 players, including 119 named to the [[Canadian Football Hall of Fame]] on the basis of performance since [[1945 in Canadian football|1945]], and 66 others identified during a three-month research process. Brothers [[Doug Flutie]] and [[Darren Flutie]] bookended the top 50, while [[Damon Allen]] (professional [[gridiron football]]'s all-time leading passer at the time; his record was surpassed on October 10, 2011 by [[Anthony Calvillo]], who did not make the list), [[Milt Stegall]] (the CFL's all-time leader in [[touchdown]] receptions), [[Terry Vaughn]] (the CFL's all-time leader in receptions at the time; his record was beaten by [[Ben Cahoon]] in October 2010), and [[Joe Montford]] (perennial all-star defensive end), were still active when named to the list.

{{about|the 1841 book|the 1815 guide|The Epicure's Almanack}}
'''''The Epicure’s Almanac''''' (also known as '''''Diary of Good Living''''') contained a variety of original or valuable tips for daily life. These tips were gained as a result of the real life  experience of people in their enjoyment of the 'good things in life'. The book was written in 1841 by Benson Earle Hill and published, in London, by How and Parsons. It is now a rare book.

This early nineteenth century book was intended for people who were not rich and could not really afford to go to restaurants. One useful tip was to add [[bicarbonate of soda]] to [[cider]] to make a 'poor mans [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]]'. As a soldier, Hill gained a broad experience of life and hence this book includes recipes like Cheshire [[pork pie]], North Wiltshire cheese, Nag’s-head cake, cooked [[tomato]]es, [[kebab]]s, [[coconut]] and [[chutney]]s. The recipes demonstrate the influence that [[British Empire|Britain’s colonies]] were beginning to exert on British lifestyle and cuisine.
The book was not a great commercial success and hence very few copies have survived.

A '''tip sheet''' is a publication containing the latest information, [[tipster|tips]] or predictions for a particular industry. Tip sheets are commonly published to impart business or stock market information, music industry songwriter leads, and tips on [[horse racing]] results.

==Types of tip sheet==
In the financial sector tip sheet newsletters offer investors' advice on [[stock and flow|stocks]]. In the UK, tip sheets are regulated by the [[Financial Conduct Authority]] (FCA) since 2010 to prevent malpractice. In prior to 2010, Financial Service Authority (FSA) also regulated.

Media tip sheets are typically lists of tips on how to do something, or solve a particular problem, that are printed in newspapers and magazines and appear on television. An example tip sheet might be titled "8 Tax Tips the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] Wishes You Didn't Know". They offer their creators free publicity and provide media outlets with free ready-made content, which they can reprint verbatim.

==Music tip sheets==
A music tip sheet, or song tip sheet, is a research service that regularly publishes information about which [[musician|recording artists]] and film and TV projects are looking for music, along with the appropriate contact information. They are used by songwriters, publishers and record producers, but most commonly by new songwriters looking to gain a foothold in the industry.&lt;ref name="emusician"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://emusician.com/tutorials/columns/pitching_songs_how/ |title=How to pitch your songs to industry insiders. |publisher=EMusician |date=1 July 2007 |accessdate=25 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724185818/http://emusician.com/tutorials/columns/pitching_songs_how/ |archivedate=24 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Songwriter, publisher and "respected music industry veteran" Eric Beall&lt;ref name="berkleemusic.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berkleemusic.com/school/faculty-member?person_id=1176543 |title=Eric Beall – Music Business |publisher=berkleemusic.com |accessdate=31 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; said that "If I were going to spend money on anything when I started out as a songwriter, other than the actual demos, I would put it into tip sheets."&lt;ref name="hitquarters"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Eric_Beall_Interview.html |title=Interview with Eric Beall |publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=7 April 2008 |accessdate=31 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Established music tip sheets include "RowFax", the [[MusicRow]] publication, and [[SongQuarters]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1395">In '''''Totoyi v Ncuka''''', an important case in the [[South African law of lease]], the parties had agreed that the amount of rent after the first four years was to rise gradually from two pounds and ten shillings per annum, "but not to exceed 4 pounds per annum." The court held that the formula was too vague to be converted into a sum of money.

The case of ''[[Raner and Bernstin v Armitage]]'' must be distinguished from this one, as there a lessee had the option to renew, one of the terms of the option being that "the [...] rental shall not exceed the sum of 75 pounds per month." The court in ''Raner'' held that this formula was adequate, because it meant that the lessee had the right to renew at the rental of 75 pounds per month.

The distinction between the two cases lies in the fact that, in ''Totoyi'', the formula stipulated an indefinite period, during which indefinite amounts would be added, whereas in the second the formula referred to a precise moment in time (the date of renewal) and allowed the whole amount of the rise to take place at that time.

'''William Kolodney''' (1899 – January 18, 1976) was a Russian-born American cultural educator and program director for two major New York City institutions, the [[92nd Street Y]] and the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].

==Early life and education==
Kolodney was born in [[Minsk]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jta.org/1976/01/22/archive/william-kolodney-dead-at-76 "William Kolodney Dead at 76"], [[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]], January 22, 1976, accessed July 25, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and his family moved to America when he was 4 years old. He attended [[New York University]] as an undergraduate and earned a master's degree and a Doctorate from [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref name=NYTimesObit&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1976/01/19/archives/dr-william-kolodney-dies-at-76-brought-arts-to-the-92d-st-y.html "Dr. William Kolodney Dies at 76; Brought Arts to the 92d St. 'Y'"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 19, 1976, accessed July 25, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; His dissertation was based on his work at the [[92nd Street Y]], describing its transformation during his tenure into "a major arts institution".&lt;ref name=Rothstein1992&gt;Rothstein, Edward. [https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/29/arts/classical-view-lessons-for-the-future-may-lurk-in-the-past.html "Classical View; Lessons for the Future May Lurk in the Past"], ''The New York Times'', November 29, 1992, accessed July 25, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==92nd Street Y==
Kolodney created the educational program for the [[Jewish Community Center|YMHA]] in Pittsburgh in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.92y.org/uptown/school-of-the-arts/harkness-dance-center/about/celebrating-75-years-of-dance-at-92nd-street-y/our-history.aspx "Our History"], [[92nd Street Y]], accessed July 25, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935, he joined the 92nd street Y in New York as Educational Director, instituting a wide-ranging educational program. He made the "Y" a center for chamber music, poetry readings, and dance performances.&lt;ref name=Rothstein1992/&gt; He was guided by idealistic principles. He decided "not to popularize or glamorize knowledge through publicity methods designed to attract large numbers." At the same time, he felt that fees for "Y" programs "should be small enough to enable the clerical or the salaried worker with a modest income to enroll in any activity which might meet his needs and interests."&lt;ref name=Rothstein1992/&gt;

Kolodney felt that music was a way to educate the emotions and that each person "responds differently to every sound, from the wind in the trees to a Shostakovich symphony."&lt;ref name=Tolchin&gt;Tolchin, Martin. [https://query.nytimes.com/search/sitesearch/#/william+kolodney+martin+tolchin+1960+%22attuning+the+young+to+music%22/ "Attuning the Young to Music"], ''The New York Times'', June 26, 1960, accessed July 25, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; He presented great musicians such as [[Rudolf Serkin]], [[Myra Hess]], [[Gregor Piatigorsky]], [[Erica Morini]], and [[Joseph Hoffman]] as well as the [[Budapest String Quartet]] in annual series. He established the Y School of Music under the direction of [[Abraham Wolf Binder]], who believed that it was more important to teach a child how to listen to music than to play an instrument.&lt;ref name=Tolchin/&gt;

In 1936 Kolodney invited [[Martha Graham]] to give a dance recital as part of the new Dance Center at the "Y". During the next ten years she performed there as a solo recitalist or with her group. Other dancers or faculty at the "Y" have included [[Doris Humphrey]], [[Charles Weidman]], [[Hanya Holm]], [[Anna Sokolow]], [[Agnes de Mille]], [[Paul Taylor (choreographer)|Paul Taylor]], [[Jose Limon]] and [[Alvin Ailey]] among others. When Ailey received New York's Handel Medallion, he said he could not have formed his company without the support of Kolodney.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, John P. [https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/12/opinion/l-martha-graham-wrought-emotion-into-dance-her-role-at-the-y-420091.html "Martha Graham Wrought Emotion Into Dance; Her Role at the 'Y'"], Letters to the Editor, ''The New York Times'', April 12, 1991, accessed July 25, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, Agnes de Mille said "No other institution in the United States has done more for American dance. Without William Kolodney, there simply was no place to go. He gave us a stage and an intelligent audience. He taught us to hope."&lt;ref&gt;Kisselgoff, Anna.

Kolodney created The Poetry Center at the "Y" in 1939 "to meet the needs of the very few persons in New York to whom poetry offers the theological, ethical and esthetic equivalents of traditional religion".&lt;ref&gt;Farrell, William E. [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1980/12/20/111325182.html?pageNumber=30 "About New York: Echoes From a Venerable but Lively Auditorium"], ''The New York Times'', December 20, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; Poetry was Kolodney's greatest love: "At the center we had the greatest poets, [[T. S. Eliot|Eliot]], [[E. E. Cummings|Cummings]], [[Wallace Stevens|Stevens]]. Eliot turned down other institutions to read at the 'Y'".&lt;ref&gt;Kisselgoff, Anna.

Eliot]], to the anti-Semitic 1952 [[Slánský trial]] in [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Czechoslovakia]], but the volume was never released.&lt;ref&gt;Eliot, T.S.

When he retired from the 92nd Street Y after 35 years in 1969, a ''New York Times'' editorial noted that he had made the "Y" "the source of some of the most varied and stimulating artistic fare in the nation. His view was ecumenical; the person was always submerged in the artist. He made the "Y" a stay against confusion, a place where for a moment all that is harmonious, stable, beautiful comes to rest."&lt;ref&gt;Editorial.
