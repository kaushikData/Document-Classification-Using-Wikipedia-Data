'''{{mp|2006 RH|120}}''' is a tiny [[Near-Earth object|near-Earth asteroid]]&lt;ref name=jpldata/&gt; and [[List of fast rotators (minor planets)|fast rotator]] with a diameter of approximately 2–3 meters&lt;ref name="Barbee2015"/&gt; that ordinarily orbits the Sun but makes close approaches to the Earth–Moon system around every twenty years,&lt;ref name=Pseudo-MPEC/&gt; when it can temporarily enter [[Earth]] orbit through ''temporary satellite capture'' (TSC). Most recently, it was in Earth orbit from September 2006 to June 2007.&lt;ref name=klotz&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.discovery.com/space/asteroids-meteors-meteorites/asteroid-capture-earth-gravity-satellite-mini-moon-130207.htm|title=Mystery Mini Moons: How Many Does Earth Have?|work=DNews}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence of its temporary orbit around the Earth, it is currently the smallest asteroid in the Solar System with a well-known orbit.

Until given a [[minor planet designation]] on 18 February 2008,&lt;ref name="MPEC2008-D12"/&gt; the object was known as '''6R10DB9''', an internal identification number assigned by the [[Catalina Sky Survey]].&lt;ref name=Shefford&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birtwhistle.org/Gallery6R10DB9.htm |title=2006 RH120 ( = 6R10DB9) – A second moon for the Earth? |author=Great Shefford Observatory |accessdate=16 April 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509212342/http://www.birtwhistle.org/Gallery6R10DB9.htm |archivedate=9 May 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discovery ==

{{mp|2006 RH|120}} was discovered on 14 September 2006 by the {{convert|27|in|mm|adj=on}} Schmidt camera of the Catalina Sky Survey in [[Arizona]].&lt;ref name=DASO&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/~gwilliams/DASO/000000/DASO_000068.txt |title=Distant Artificial Satellites Observation (DASO) Circular No. 68, 2006 Sept. 17, 16:59 UT |accessdate=26 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; "6R10DB9"&lt;ref name=DASO/&gt; was the Catalina Sky Survey's own discovery designation for this object, which usually would only be used on the [[Minor Planet Center|MPC]]'s [[Near-Earth Object|NEO]] Confirmation Page (NEOCP) until an [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] designation was applied, if the object was classified as a minor object. It was added on 14 September to the NEOCP and subsequently removed with the explanation that it "was not a [[minor planet]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hohmanntransfer.com/news/0704.htm#news |title=Major News About Minor Objects, April 18, 2007 |accessdate=27 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preliminary orbital calculations indicated it was captured by Earth's [[gravity]] from solar orbit of a period of about 11 months, which is similar to that of many spent rocket boosters dating to the [[Apollo program]] of the 1960s and early 1970s. 6R10DB was assigned the designation {{mp|2006 RH|120}} on 18 February 2008.&lt;ref name="MPEC2008-D12"/&gt;

== Origin ==

Some controversy existed regarding the origin of the object. Upon discovery, it was not given a formal name because its size, orbit, and spectrum were consistent with the white titanium-oxide paint used on Saturn V rockets,&lt;ref&gt;Spectrum measured by Carl Hergenrother and Rob Whitely of the University of Arizona.&lt;/ref&gt; which meant it could be an artificial object. Precedents for this exist: [[J002E3]] is currently thought to be the third-stage Saturn [[S-IVB]] booster from [[Apollo 12]] and was in an almost identical orbit,&lt;ref name=astronomy&gt;{{cite news|title=Is Another Moon Possible?|last=Yeomans|first=Don|date=April 2010|work=Astronomy}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[6Q0B44E]], discovered a month earlier, was also thought to be artificial.&lt;ref name="b44e"&gt;[[The Guardian]], Spacewatch, 6 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Its status as a satellite was also debated, with A. W. Harris of the [[Space Science Institute]] commenting, "Claiming some bit of fluff in a temporary looping orbit to be a ‘satellite,’ with all the baggage that term carries, is mere hype".&lt;ref name=Pseudo-MPEC/&gt;&lt;ref name="ST2007"&gt;{{cite web |date=17 April 2007 |title=Earth's "Other Moon" |publisher=Sky &amp; Telescope |author=Roger W. Sinnott |url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/news/7067527.html |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Orbit ==
Analysis has shown that [[Radiation pressure|solar-radiation pressure]] is [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbing]] its motion perceptibly.&lt;ref name=Goldstone&gt;{{cite web |date=20 June 2007 |title=6R10DB9 Planning |url=http://echo.jpl.nasa.gov/asteroids/6R10DB9/6R10DB9_planning.html |publisher=JPL/NASA Asteroid Radar Research |author=Dr. Lance A. M. Benner |accessdate=27 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Paul Chodas in [[JPL]]'s Solar System Dynamics Group suspects that the perturbations are consistent with expectations for a rocky object but not with old flight hardware.&lt;ref name=Goldstone/&gt; One hypothesis is that the object is a piece of lunar rock ejected by an impact.&lt;ref name=Pseudo-MPEC&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.projectpluto.com/pluto/mpecs/6r1.htm| author=Bill Gray| accessdate=16 August 2007| title="Pseudo-MPEC" for 6R10DB9|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070927183814/http://home.gwi.net/~pluto/mpecs/6r1.htm| archivedate= 27 September 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 February 2008, the object was given a minor planet designation.&lt;ref name="MPEC2008-D12"/&gt;

The object made four Earth orbits of about three months each before being ejected after the June 2007 [[perigee]]. At that perigee, it dipped inside the Moon's orbit to a distance of {{convert|276845|km|mi}}.&lt;ref name=Shefford/&gt; {{mp|2006 RH|120}} became an [[List of Apollo asteroids|Apollo-class asteroid]] in June 2007.

== 14 June 2007 perigee ==

On 14 June 2007, {{mp|2006 RH|120}} made its fourth and last perigee of the most recent Earth encounter.&lt;ref name=jpl-close&gt;{{cite web |type=last observation: 2007-06-22; [[Observation arc|arc]]: 281 days |title=JPL Close-Approach Data: (2006 RH120) |url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=2006RH120;cad=1#cad |accessdate=27 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was 0.7 [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|lunar distances]] at closest, with an [[apparent magnitude]] of 18.5–19.0. [[Astronomer]]s at [[JPL]] [[Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex|Goldstone]] in California made [[radar]] [[astrometry]] measurements on 12, 14 and 17 June 2007.

== Future events ==

{{mp|2006 RH|120}} is now in solar orbit&lt;ref name="ST2007"/&gt; as an [[Amor asteroid|Amor-class asteroid]]&lt;ref name="mpc"/&gt; with an orbit completely outside of Earth's orbit. As of 2017, this object is 2&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] from Earth on the other side of the Sun.&lt;ref name="NEODyS"/&gt; Systematic residuals in the positions of the object probably indicate that the model used to determine solar radiation pressure may be too simple to adequately describe its motion over a long period of time.&lt;ref name=Shefford/&gt; The next near-Earth encounter is in August 2028 when the object will pass Earth at a relatively low speed of {{convert|136|m/s|mph|0|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref name=Shefford/&gt;&lt;ref name=jpl-close/&gt; For comparison, on 13 April 2029, asteroid [[99942 Apophis]] will pass Earth at a relative speed of {{convert|7.4|km/s|mph|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref name=jpl-Apophis/&gt; {{mp|2006 RH|120}} is listed as part of the Near-Earth Object Human Space Flight Accessible Targets Study (NHATS).&lt;ref name="NHATS"/&gt;

== History ==
[[Image:Audion receiver.jpg|thumb|One of the earliest Audion radio receivers, constructed by De Forest in 1914. Audion tubes were mounted upside down, with the delicate filament hanging down, to prevent it from sagging and touching the grid. This was a detector (rectifier) and two stage [[audio amplifier]] unit; the radio signal came from a separate "tuner" unit.]]

It had been known since the middle of the 19th century that gas flames were [[Electrical conduction|electrically conductive]], and early wireless experimenters had noticed that this conductivity was affected by the presence of [[Radio frequency|radio waves]]. De Forest found that gas in a partial [[vacuum]] heated by a conventional lamp filament behaved much the same way, and that if a wire were wrapped around the glass housing, the device could serve as a detector of radio signals. In his original design, a small metal plate was sealed into the lamp housing, and this was connected to the positive terminal of a 22 volt battery via a pair of headphones, the negative terminal being connected to one side of the lamp filament. When wireless signals were applied to the wire wrapped around the outside of the glass, they caused disturbances in the current which produced sounds in the headphones.

This was a significant development as existing commercial wireless systems were heavily protected by [[patent]]s; a new type of detector would allow De Forest to market his own system. He eventually discovered that connecting the antenna circuit to a third electrode placed directly in the current path greatly improved the sensitivity; in his earliest versions, this was simply a piece of wire bent into the shape of a grid-iron (hence "grid").

The Audion provided power gain; with other detectors, all of the power to operate the headphones had to come from the antenna circuit itself. Consequently, weak transmitters could be heard at greater distances.

=== Patents and disputes ===
De Forest and everybody else at the time greatly underestimated the potential of his original device, imagining it to be limited to mostly military applications. It is significant that he apparently never saw its potential as a [[long distance calling|telephone repeater amplifier]], even though crude electromechanical ''note magnifiers'' had been the bane of the telephone industry for at least two decades. (Ironically, in the years of patent disputes leading up to World War I, it was only this "loophole" that allowed vacuum triodes to be manufactured at all, since none of De Forest's patents specifically mentioned this application).

De Forest was granted a patent for his early two-electrode version of the Audion on November 13, 1906 ({{US patent|841386}}), but the "triode" (three electrode) version was patented in 1908 ({{US patent|879532}}). De Forest continued to claim that he developed the Audion independently from [[John Ambrose Fleming]]'s earlier research on the [[thermionic valve]] (for which Fleming received Great Britain patent 24850 and the American [[Fleming valve]] patent {{US patent|803684}}), and De Forest became embroiled in many radio-related patent disputes. De Forest was famous for saying that he "didn't know why it worked, it just did".{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

He  always referred to the vacuum triodes developed by other researchers as "Oscillaudions", although there is no evidence that he had any significant input to their development. It is true that after the invention of the true vacuum triode in 1913 (see below), De Forest continued to manufacture various types of radio transmitting and receiving apparatus, (examples of which are illustrated on this page). However, although he routinely described these devices as using "Audions", they actually used high-vacuum triodes, using circuitry very similar to that developed by other experimenters.

In 1914, [[Columbia University]] student [[Edwin Howard Armstrong]] worked with professor [[John Harold Morecroft]] to document the electrical principles of the Audion. Armstrong published his explanation of the Audion in ''[[Electrical World]]'' in December 1914, complete with circuit diagrams and oscilloscope graphs.&lt;ref name="Armstrong-audion"&gt;{{cite journal

|date=December 12, 1914 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March and April 1915, Armstrong spoke to the [[Institute of Radio Engineers]] in New York and Boston, respectively, presenting his paper "Some Recent Developments in the Audion Receiver", which was published in September.&lt;ref name="Armstrong1915" /&gt; A combination of the two papers was reprinted in other journals such as the ''Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences''.&lt;ref name="Armstrong-audion" /&gt; When Armstrong and De Forest later faced each other in a dispute over the [[Regenerative circuit|regeneration]] patent, Armstrong was able to demonstrate conclusively that De Forest still had no idea how it worked.&lt;ref name="Lee" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3iIOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA178 |pages=178–184 |last=McNicol |first=Donald Monroe |title=Radio's Conquest of Space the Experimental Rise in Radio Communication |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=1946}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem was that (possibly to distance his invention from the Fleming valve) De Forest's original patents specified that low-pressure gas inside the Audion was essential to its operation (Audion being a contraction of "Audio-Ion"), and in fact early Audions had severe reliability problems due to this gas being adsorbed by the metal electrodes. The Audions sometimes worked extremely well; at other times they would barely work at all.

As well as De Forest himself, numerous researchers had tried to find ways to improve the reliability  of the device by stabilizing the partial vacuum. Much of the research that led to the development of true vacuum tubes was carried out by [[Irving Langmuir]] in the [[General Electric]] (GE) research laboratories.

===Kenotron and Pliotron===

[[Image:General electric pliotron pp schenectady 3.jpg|thumb|right|General Electric Company Pliotron]]
Langmuir had long suspected that certain assumed  limitations on the performance of various low-pressure and vacuum electrical devices, might not be fundamental physical limitations at all, but simply due to contamination and impurities in the manufacturing process.

His first success was in demonstrating that, contrary to what Edison and others had long asserted, incandescent lamps could function more efficiently and with longer life if the glass envelope was filled with low-pressure inert gas rather than a complete vacuum. However, this only worked if the gas used was meticulously 'scrubbed" of all traces of oxygen and water vapor.
He then applied the same approach to producing a rectifier for the newly developed "Coolidge" X-ray tubes. Again contrary to what had been widely believed to be possible, by virtue of meticulous cleanliness and attention to detail, he was able to produce versions of the Fleming Diode that could rectify hundreds of thousands of volts. His rectifiers were called "Kenotrons" from the Greek ''keno'' (empty, contains nothing, as in a vacuum) and ''tron'' (device, instrument).

He then turned his attention to the Audion tube, again suspecting that its notoriously unpredictable behaviour might be tamed with more care in the manufacturing process.

However he took a somewhat unorthodox approach. Instead of trying to stabilize the partial vacuum, he wondered if it was possible to make the Audion function with the total vacuum of a Kenotron, since that was somewhat easier to stabilize.

He soon realized that his "vacuum" Audion had markedly different characteristics from the De Forest version, and was really a quite different device, capable of linear amplification and at much higher frequencies.  To distinguish his device from the Audion he named it the "Pliotron", from the Greek ''plio'' (more or extra, in this sense meaning [[gain (electronics)|gain]], more signal coming out than went in).

Essentially, he referred to all his vacuum tube designs as Kenotrons, the Pliotron basically being a specialized type of Kenotron. However, because Pliotron and Kenotron were registered trademarks, technical writers tended to use the more generic term "vacuum tube". By the mid-1920s, the term "Kenotron" had come to exclusively refer to vacuum tube rectifiers, while the term "Pliotron" had fallen into disuse. Ironically, in popular usage, the sound-alike brands "Radiotron" and "Ken-Rad" outlasted the original names.

== Applications and use ==
[[Image:First vacuum tube AM radio transmitter.jpg|thumb|The first Audion AM radio transmitter, built by Lee De Forest and announced April, 1914]]
[[Image:De Forest Audion AM radio transmitters.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Some of the earliest Audion AM radio transmitters, built by De Forest around 1916.  The invention of the Audion oscillator in 1912 made inexpensive sound radio transmission possible, and was responsible for the advent of [[radio broadcasting]] around 1920.]]  
[[Image:Audion vacuum tube advertisement.png|thumb|Audion advertisement, ''Electrical Experimenter'' magazine, 1916]]

De Forest continued  to manufacture and supply Audions to the US Navy up until the early 1920s, for maintenance of existing equipment, but elsewhere they were regarded as well and truly obsolete by then. It was the vacuum [[triode]] that made practical radio broadcasts a reality.

Prior to the introduction of the Audion, radio receivers had used a variety of [[detector (radio)|detector]]s including [[coherer]]s, [[barretter detector|barretter]]s, and [[crystal detector]]s.  The most popular crystal detector consisted of a small piece of [[galena]] crystal probed by a fine wire commonly referred to as a "[[cat's-whisker detector]]". They were very unreliable, requiring frequent adjustment of the cat's whisker and offered no amplification. Such systems usually required the user to listen to the signal through headphones, sometimes at very low volume, as the only energy available to operate the headphones was that picked up by the antenna. For long distance communication huge antennas were normally required, and enormous amounts of electrical power had to be fed into the transmitter.

The Audion was a considerable improvement on this, but the original devices could not provide any subsequent amplification to what was produced in the signal detection process. The later vacuum triodes allowed the signal to be amplified to any desired level, typically by feeding the amplified output of one triode into the grid of the next, eventually providing more than enough power to drive a full-sized speaker. Apart from this, they were able to amplify the incoming radio signals prior to the detection process, making it work much more efficiently.

Vacuum tubes could also be used to make superior [[radio transmitter]]s. The combination of much more efficient transmitters and much more sensitive receivers revolutionized radio communication during [[World War I]].

By the late 1920s such "tube radios" began to become a fixture of most [[Western world]] households, and remained so until long after the introduction of [[transistor]] radios in the mid-1950s.

In modern [[electronics]], the [[vacuum tube]] has been largely superseded by [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] devices such as the [[transistor]], invented in 1947 and implemented in [[integrated circuit]]s in 1959, although vacuum tubes remain to this day in such applications as high-powered transmitters, guitar amplifiers and some high fidelity audio equipment.

*:: This appears in some Audion Bulbs and not in others. If allowed to persist, the vacuum automatically increases. For this reason the glow should not be allowed to appear and certainly not to continue, as the vacuum may rise to a very high value, requiring very high voltage in the “B” battery.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14874">The '''Bayou Bridge Pipeline''' (BBP) is a 162.5-mile [[crude oil]] pipeline planned from [[Lake Charles, Louisiana]] to [[St. James, Louisiana]] by Bayou Bridge, LLC, a subsidiary of [[Energy Transfer Partners]]. Communities directly impacted by the pipeline have asked the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] for an [[Environmental Impact Statement]]. The Corps refused to do so and approved the project on 15 December 2017.

==Description==
The Bayou Bridge Pipeline (BBP), is a [[crude oil]] pipeline project through Louisiana´s [[Atchafalaya Basin]] and across 11 parishes. It is to connect an oil-and-gas hub in Texas with oil refineries in Louisiana. The planned 162 miles of pipeline have been estimated to cost $670 million.&lt;ref name=Ball&gt;J.R. Ball [http://www.houmatoday.com/news/20170220/huge-louisiana-pipeline-project-draws-opposition Huge Louisiana pipeline project draws opposition.] Houma Today-GateHouse Media LLC NOLA.com/The Times-Picayune. Feb 20, 2017, retrieved 19 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The Bayou Bridge pipeline is to deliver heavy and light crude oil from the Phillips 66 and Sunoco Logistics terminals in [[Nederland, Texas]] into [[Lake Charles, Louisiana]] other than by ship or rail. [[Greg Garland]], chairman of Phillips 66 said it complemented other pipeline projects to deliver [[Bakken oil deposits|Bakken crude oil]] to the Gulf Coast.&lt;ref name=napipe&gt;[http://napipelines.com/bayou-bridge-pipeline-to-deliver-crude-to-louisiana-refinery-market/ Bayou Bridge Pipeline to Deliver Crude to Louisiana Refinery Market] napipelines.com 3 August 2015, retrieved 19 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ownership==
In August 2015, [[Energy Transfer Partners]] LP announced a [[joint venture]] with [[Phillips 66]] (40%) and Sunoco Logistics Partners LP (30%) to construct the Bayou Bridge pipeline, in which they would have a 30% interest.&lt;ref name=napipe/&gt;

==Financing==
{{Empty section|date=December 2017}}


==Route==
The proposed 162-mile Bayou Bridge Pipeline project is located in Calcasieu, [[Jefferson Davis Parish, Louisiana]], [[Acadia Parish, Louisiana]], [[Vermilion Parish, Louisiana]], [[Lafayette Parish, Louisiana]], [[Iberia Parish, Louisiana]], [[St. Martin Parish, Louisiana]], [[Iberville Parish, Louisiana]], [[Ascension Parish, Louisiana]], [[Assumption Parish, Louisiana]], and [[St. James Parish, Louisiana]]. Two pump stations have been proposed in Jefferson Davis and St. Martin parishes. There are eight watersheds within the project: Lower Calcasieu, Mermentau, Vermilion, Bayou Teche, Atchafalaya, Lower Grand, West Central Louisiana Coastal, and East Central Louisiana Coastal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mvn.usace.army.mil/bayoubridge/ BayouBridge] USACE New Orleans district, n.d., retrieved 19 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

An important context of the route is the fact that marshes and wetlands have suffered long-term erosion from levees, which are keeping the Mississippi River from flooding but also from re-depositing sediments.&lt;ref&gt;James Fletcher [https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-34053365?SThisFB The washing away of Cajun culture.] BBC News, Leeville. 27 August 2015, retrieved 19 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
With the 2015 joint venture, Phase I of the project began, the construction of a 30-inch pipeline from [[Nederland, Texas]] to Lake Charles, Louisiana. In April 2016, this pipeline went into service.&lt;ref name=ETP&gt;[http://energytransfer.com/ops_bayou_bridge.aspx Bayou Bridge] Energy Transfer Partners, n.d. retrieved 19 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt; 

Phase II of the pipeline entails a 24” pipe from Lake Charles to St. James, Louisiana, which is expected to be completed in the first few months of 2018.&lt;ref name=ETP/&gt;
Informational meetings were held in January 2017. By May 2017, pipes had already been manufactured.&lt;ref&gt;Sam Barnes [https://www.businessreport.com/business/pipe-670-million-pipeline-south-louisiana-ready-go-owners-awaiting-regulatory-green-light Pipe for a $670 million pipeline through south Louisiana is ready to go. But its owners are awaiting the regulatory green light.] BATON ROUGE BUSINESS REPORT. May 15, 2017, retrieved 19 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt; 
In August 2017, St James residents opposed the pipeline.&lt;ref&gt;Meghan Holmes [http://www.louisianaweekly.com/st-james-residents-oppose-proposed-pipeline/ St. James residents oppose proposed pipeline.] LOUISIANA WEEKLY-14 August 2017, retrieved 19 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and the parish council delayed its vote,&lt;ref&gt;David J Mitchell [http://www.houmatoday.com/news/20170810/st-james-parish-council-delays-vote-on-oil-pipeline-permit St. James Parish Council delays vote on oil pipeline permit.] Houma Today- GateHouse Media LLC- The Advocate (Baton Rouge) Aug 10, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; but 10 days later, it approved the land use for the pipeline by a margin of 4-3 so it could run through the [[Vacherie, Louisiana]] area. The vote was along racial lines, with the white majority prevailing.&lt;ref&gt;David J Mitchell [http://www.houmatoday.com/news/20170824/oil-pipeline-wins-approval-to-run-through-vacherie-area Oil pipeline wins approval to run through Vacherie area.] Houma Today- GateHouse Media LLC. The Advocate, Aug 24, 2017, retrieved 19 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, as Bayou Bridge LLC was to expropriate property, environmental activists demanded to see project records, including internal company communications, per Louisiana’s [[public records]] law.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Hardy [http://www.houmatoday.com/news/20171207/louisiana-environmental-groups-target-bayou-bridge-pipeline-records Louisiana environmental groups target Bayou Bridge pipeline records.] Houma Today- GateHouse Media LLC, The Advocate (Baton Rouge)- Dec 7, 2017, retrieved 19 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governmental permissions==
Two government permits are needed for the pipeline: one from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and one from the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources. {{As of |2017|12}} the latter had approved the project.

==Concerns==
===Human health===
St James residents have stated that the oil industry is hurting their health and their town in what is known as cancer alley.&lt;ref&gt;Lauren Zanolli in St James, Louisiana [‘Cancer Alley’ residents say industry is hurting town: ‘We’re collateral damage’] THE GUARDIAN-  6 June 2017, retrieved 19 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent explosion of an oil platform on [[Lake Pontchartrain]] on 6 December 2017 illustrates the dangers involved.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Hardy [http://www.theadvocate.com/new_orleans/news/article_452ec35c-b20d-11e7-8e62-eb936ad3d199.html Lake Pontchartrain oil platform explosion leaves 7 injured, 1 missing; resident describes seeing ‘tremendous flames’] The ADVOCATE Dec 6, 2017, retrieved 19 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Environmental pollution===
Oil spills are a realistic concern. In May 2017, Energy transfer pipelines in Ohio had a series of leaks.&lt;ref&gt;Sam Levin in San Francisco [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/25/energy-transfer-partners-dakota-access-oil-leaks-ohio Firm behind Dakota Access pipeline faces intense scrutiny for series of leaks.] THE GUARDIAN- 25 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;On December 1 it was reported that a pipeline leaked oil into Louisiana marsh.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.houmatoday.com/news/20171201/hole-in-pipeline-leaks-oil-into-louisiana-marsh Hole in pipeline leaks oil into Louisiana marsh.] Houma Today-GateHouse Media LLC -The Associated Press, 1 Dec 2017, retrieved 19 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt;At a meeting of the [[St. Martin Parish Council, Louisiana|St. Martin Parish Council]] the Louisiana Crawfish Producers Association-West noted that many pipelines and their spill banks underneath the Atchafalaya Basin running east to west have changed the water flow to such a degree that it no longer flows throughout the Basin, creating "[[dead water]]" or low-oxygen swamp water. The Corps of Engineers has required pipeline companies to maintain water flow, but is not enforcing the requirement.&lt;ref&gt;Danny Fenster [http://www.iberianet.com/news/basin-s-water-flow-brought-up-at-meeting/article_a4d4561a-92b8-11e7-aaf9-cfd52d6888c3.html Basin’s water flow brought up at meeting.] THE DAILY IBERIAN-Sep 6, 2017

===Impact on fishing industry===
Crawfishermen have been impacted by the oil industry, particularly since the [[2010 BP Oil Spill]].&lt;ref&gt;Jody Meche [http://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/opinion/article_7afdfae2-b83a-11e7-ad90-f77b6e7597e0.htmlGuest column: Crawfishermen under threat as oil, gas companies show flagrant disregard for our way of life] The Advocate Oct 24, 2017, retrieved 19 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt; This comes on the background of deteriorating health of the basin, an increase of the dead zones.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Zernich, Meteorologist [http://www.katc.com/story/36340251/parts-of-the-basin-are-becoming-dead-zones-for-fisherman Parts of the basin are becoming dead zones for fisherman.] KATC.com –Sep 12, 2017, retrieved 19 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Lack of trust===
Residents who have been impacted by the oil industry have heard companies´ promises of protecting and restoring the coast but not to come true.&lt;ref&gt;Lamar White, Jr.[https://www.bayoubrief.com/2017/08/18/rigged-the-lies-and-contradictions-of-big-oils-campaign-against-protecting-and-restoring-louisianas-coast/Rigged: The Lies and Contradictions of Big Oil’s Campaign Against Protecting and Restoring Louisiana’s Coast.] BAYOU BRIEF, August 18, 2017, retrieved 19 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Blue Marsh National Recreation Area''' is an [[artificial lake]] located northwest of the city of [[Reading, Pennsylvania]], USA and managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Philadelphia District. It is in western [[Berks County]], fed into by the [[Tulpehocken Creek (Pennsylvania)|Tulpehocken Creek]]. The main span of the lake is along the border between [[Bern Township, Pennsylvania|Bern]] and [[Lower Heidelberg Township, Pennsylvania|Lower Heidelberg Townships]]. However, the northwesternmost portions lie in the more sparsely populated [[North Heidelberg Township, Pennsylvania|North Heidelberg]] and [[Penn Township, Berks County, Pennsylvania|Penn Townships]]. In the middle of the lake is a large, uninhabited [[island]] (claimed by Bern Township). The lake is a popular recreation area in the summer, where people can [[fishing|fish]], [[human swimming|swim]], and [[boating|boat]].

==History==
Blue Marsh was the name of the village that was located where the lake now is. It was the first settlement in [[Lower Heidelberg Township, Pennsylvania|Lower Heidelberg Township]]. The land was very fertile. It was also a heavily forested area with abundance of wildlife. There were many Farms, and 18th and 19th century homes. The village also had a church, schoolhouse, post office, and Pyles General Store. Some buildings were spared, such as Gruber Wagon Works, which was originally in Blue Marsh but was moved a safe distance away before the dam was created. Others include Old Dry Rd. Farm, which most of its buildings were relocated out of the village. Residents were put under eminent domain and had no choice but to move out. Initial authorization for the reservoir was granted by the [[Flood Control Act of 1962]] that started eight projects on the [[Delaware River]] basin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://berkshistory.org/articles/blue-marsh/ |title=Historical Survey of Blue Marsh Project Area |author=George M. Meiser IX |publisher=The Historical Society of Berks County |work=The Historical Review of Berks County |date=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Pennsylvania [[Project 70 Land Acquisition and Borrowing Act]] provided funding and permitted the [[eminent domain]] acquisition of the land that would later become the lake with the governor's permission in 1969.  The [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] began constructing the lake in March 1974 with the impoundment of the Tulpehocken Creek and was completed in September 1979.&lt;ref name="Official"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nap.usace.army.mil/Missions/CivilWorks/BlueMarshLake.aspx |title=Blue Marsh Lake |publisher=U.S. Army Corps of Engineers |accessdate=October 23, 2010 |date=August 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PADEP"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dep.state.pa.us/dep/deputate/watermgt/Wqp/WQStandards/StreamStatus/Blue_Marsh_Report.htm |title=Water Quality Standards Review: Blue Marsh Lake |publisher=Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection |accessdate=October 23, 2010 |date=January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Penn History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.co.berks.pa.us/penn/cwp/view.asp?A=2379&amp;Q=493888 |title=History of Penn Township |publisher=Township of Penn |accessdate=October 23, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cessair&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cessair |url=https://nameberry.com/babyname/Cessair |website=Nameberry |accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;''' or '''Cesair''' (spelt '''Ceasair''' in modern Irish; anglicized '''Kesair''', Pron: KAH-seer, Meaning: Sorrow, Affliction) is a character from the ''[[Lebor Gabála Érenn]]'', a medieval Christian pseudo-history of Ireland. According to the ''Lebor Gabála'', she was the leader of the first inhabitants of [[Ireland]], before the [[Bible|Biblical]] [[Deluge (mythology)|Flood]].&lt;ref name=DCM&gt;"Cesair 1,"  A Dictionary of Celtic Mythology. James McKillop. [[Oxford University Press]], 1998&lt;/ref&gt; The tale may be an attempt to [[Christianisation|Christianize]] an earlier pagan myth,&lt;ref name=DCM/&gt; but may alternatively be the product of post-conversion [[pseudohistory]].

==Overview==
According to the ''LGÉ'', Cessair was daughter of [[Noah]]'s (non-Biblical) son '''Bith''' and his wife '''Birren'''.&lt;ref name=DCM/&gt; Cessair's father's name Bith is derived from [[Proto-Celtic]] ''Bitu''-, which was a common prefix in Gaulish and Insular king names and has the meaning of "World", "Life", or "Age" in Old Irish (cf. [[Bituitus]]).&lt;ref&gt;https://lrc.la.utexas.edu/eieol_base_form_dictionary/iriol/17&lt;/ref&gt; In some versions of the tale, Noah tells them to go to the western edge of the world to escape the oncoming Flood. In other versions, when their people are denied a place on [[Noah's Ark]], Cessair tells them to make an [[Idolatry|idol]] to advise them. This idol tells them to escape the Flood by sailing to Ireland. They set out in three ships and reach Ireland after a long journey. However, when they attempt to land, two of the ships are lost. The only survivors are Cessair, forty-nine other women, and three men: [[Fintan mac Bóchra]], Bith and Ladra. They land in Ireland at Dún na mBarc (on [[Bantry Bay]]) forty days before the Flood, in Age of the World 2242&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100005A/index.html Annal 2242] [The Annals do not attempt to ascribe BC dates to these events.]&lt;/ref&gt; according to the [[Annals of the Four Masters]], or 2361 BC according to [[Seathrún Céitinn]]'s chronology.

The men are shared out evenly among the women. Each also takes one as her primary husband: Cessair takes Fintán, Bairrfhind takes Bith and Alba takes Ladra. However, Bith and Ladra soon die (Ladra becoming the first man buried in Ireland). Fintán is left with all the women but is unable to cope and so he flees. When the Flood comes, Fintán is the only one to survive. He becomes a salmon and later an eagle and a hawk, living for 5,500 years after the Flood, whence he becomes a man again and recounts Ireland's history. According to legend, Cessair died at ''Cúil Ceasra(ch)'' in [[Connacht]] and a [[cairn]], ''Carn Ceasra(ch)'', was raised over her body. It has been said that this cairn is near [[Boyle, County Roscommon|Boyle]] in [[County Roscommon]], or alternatively that it is [[Cnoc Meadha]] in [[County Galway]] (Lynch, 2006).

An earlier version of the tale, apparently found in the [[Cín Dromma Snechtai]], says that it was [[Banba]] who first came to Ireland with her two sisters, three men and fifty women.&lt;ref&gt;[[John T. Koch|Koch, John T.]]. ''Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia''. ABC-CLIO, 2006. p.165&lt;/ref&gt; Banba, [[Fódla]] and [[Ériu]] were [[Triple deity|a trio]] of land goddesses and their husbands were [[Mac Cuill]] (son of hazel), [[Mac Cecht]] (son of the plough) and [[Mac Gréine]] (son of the Sun). It is likely that Cessair, Bairrfhind and Alba are a Christianized replacement for the three goddesses and Fintán, Bith and Ladra a replacement for the three gods.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Carey (Celticist)|Carey, John]]. [http://www.ucc.ie/academic/smg/CDI/PDFs_articles/JCarey_QuigginPamphletsI.pdf ''The Irish National Origin-Legend: Synthetic Pseudohistory'']. [[University of Cambridge]], 1994. p.21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=monaghan85&gt;Monaghan, Patricia. ''The Encyclopedia of Celtic Mythology and Folklore''. Infobase Publishing, 2004. p.85&lt;/ref&gt; Fintán/Mac Cuill may also be linked to the [[Salmon of Knowledge]], which gains all the world's knowledge after eating nine hazelnuts that fall into [[Connla's Well|a well]]. The women who accompany Cessair appear by their names to represent the world's ancestral mothers; they included German (Germans), Espa (Spanish), Alba (British), Traige (Thracians), Gothiam (Goths), and so forth. Thus "their arrival can be read as creating a microcosm of the whole world's population in Ireland". Several other companions echo the names of ancient Irish goddesses.&lt;ref name=monaghan85/&gt;

Seathrún Céitinn also refers to a legend that three fishermen from [[Iberia]]—Capa, Laigne and Luasad—were driven to Ireland by a storm a year before the Flood. They liked it, so they went home to get their wives, returned shortly before the Flood, and were drowned.

According to another medieval Irish legend, Cessair is also the name of a daughter of the king of [[Gallia]] who married the [[High King of Ireland]], [[Úgaine Mór]], in the 6th or 5th century BC.

Mallory &lt;ref&gt;J.P. Mallory, ''The Origins of the Irish'', Thames &amp; Hudson (2013), Chapter Seven {{ISBN|9780500051757}} &lt;/ref&gt; has a slightly different version.  There were 150 women and 3 men. The first man died and was buried in Wexford.  The second man now had 100 women and soon died of exhaustion. The 150 women then chased the remaining man who saved himself by jumping into the sea and turning into a salmon.

'''Dependency theory''' is the notion that resources flow from a "periphery" of poor and [[Developing country|underdeveloped states]] to a "core" of [[Developed country|wealthy states]], enriching the latter at the expense of the former. It is a central contention of dependency theory that poor states are impoverished and rich ones enriched by the way poor states are integrated into the "[[world system]]".

The theory arose as a reaction to [[modernization theory]], an earlier [[development theory|theory of development]] which held that all societies progress through similar stages of development, that today's underdeveloped areas are thus in a similar situation to that of today's developed areas at some time in the past, and that, therefore, the task of helping the underdeveloped areas out of [[poverty]] is to accelerate them along this supposed common path of development, by various means such as [[investment]], [[technology transfer]]s, and closer integration into the [[World economy|world market]]. Dependency theory rejected this view, arguing that underdeveloped countries are not merely primitive versions of developed countries, but have unique features and [[structuralism|structures]] of their own; and, importantly, are in the situation of being the weaker members in a world [[market economy]].&lt;ref&gt;Newschool, [http://homepage.newschool.edu/het/schools/develop.htm "Economic Development"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714063027/http://homepage.newschool.edu/het/schools/develop.htm|date=14 July 2009}}, retrieved July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dependency theory no longer has many proponents as an overall theory, though some writers have argued for its continuing relevance as a conceptual orientation to the global division of wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year=1997|last1=James|first1=Paul|authorlink2=Paul James (academic)|title=Post-Dependency: The Third World in an Era of Globalism and Late Capitalism|url=https://www.academia.edu/7311042/Post-Dependency_The_Third_World_in_an_Era_of_Globalism_and_Late_Capitalism|journal=Alternatives: Social Transformation and Human Governance|volume=22|issue=2|pages=205–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Dependency theory originates with two papers published in 1949 – one by [[Hans Singer]], one by [[Raúl Prebisch]] – in which the authors observe that the [[terms of trade]] for underdeveloped countries relative to the developed countries had deteriorated over time: the underdeveloped countries were able to purchase fewer and fewer [[Final good|manufactured goods]] from the developed countries in exchange for a given quantity of their raw materials exports. This idea is known as the [[Prebisch–Singer hypothesis|Prebisch–Singer thesis]]. Prebisch, an Argentine economist at the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean|United Nations Commission for Latin America]] (UNCLA), went on to conclude that the underdeveloped nations must employ some degree of [[protectionism]] in trade if they were to enter a self-sustaining development path. He argued that [[Import substitution industrialization|import-substitution industrialisation]] (ISI), not a [[Export-oriented industrialization|trade-and-export orientation]], was the best strategy for underdeveloped countries.&lt;ref&gt;Short [http://homepage.newschool.edu/het/profiles/prebisch.htm Prebisch biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090812085123/http://homepage.newschool.edu/het/profiles/prebisch.htm |date=2009-08-12 }} at Newschool; retrieved July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory was developed from a [[Marxian economics|Marxian]] perspective by [[Paul A. Baran]] in 1957 with the publication of his ''The Political Economy of Growth''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Matias Vernengo|url=http://www.econ.utah.edu/activities/papers/2004_06.pdf|title=Technology, Finance and Dependency: Latin American Radical Political Economy in Retospect|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317085658/http://www.econ.utah.edu/activities/papers/2004_06.pdf|archivedate=17 March 2012|year=2004|page=5}}Working Paper No. 2004-06, University of Utah Dept. of Economics.&lt;/ref&gt; Dependency theory shares many points with earlier, Marxist, theories of [[imperialism]] by [[Rosa Luxemburg]] and [[Vladimir Lenin]], and has attracted continued interest from Marxists. Some authors identify two main streams in dependency theory: the Latin American Structuralist, typified by the work of Prebisch, [[Celso Furtado]], and [[Aníbal Pinto Santa Cruz|Aníbal Pinto]] at the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America (ECLAC, or, in Spanish, CEPAL); and the American Marxist, developed by [[Paul A. Baran]], [[Paul Sweezy]], and [[Andre Gunder Frank]].

Using the Latin American dependency model, the Guyanese Marxist historian [[Walter Rodney]], in his book ''How Europe Underdeveloped Africa'', described in 1972 an Africa that had been consciously exploited by European imperialists, leading directly to the modern underdevelopment of most of the continent.&lt;ref&gt;Rodney, W. (1972). How Europe underdeveloped Africa. Beyond borders: Thinking critically about global issues, 107-125.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory was popular in the 1960s and 1970s as a criticism of modernization theory, which was falling increasingly out of favor because of continued widespread poverty in much of the world. It was used to explain the causes of [[overurbanization]], a theory that urbanization rates outpaced industrial growth in several developing countries.&lt;ref name=Shandra&gt;Shandra, John M., Bruce London, and John B. Williamson. "Environmental Degradation, Environmental Sustainability, and Overurbanization in the Developing World: A Quantitative, Cross-National Analysis." Sociological Perspectives 46, no. 3 (1 September 2003): 309–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latin American Structuralist and the American Marxist schools had significant differences but agreed on some basic points:{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}&lt;blockquote&gt;[B]oth groups would agree that at the core of the dependency relation between center and periphery lays [lies] the inability of the periphery to develop an autonomous and dynamic process of technological innovation. Technology &lt;span role="presentation"&gt;–&lt;/span&gt; the Promethean force unleashed by the [[Industrial Revolution]] &lt;span&gt;–&lt;/span&gt; is at the center of stage. The Center countries controlled the technology and the systems for generating technology. Foreign [[Capital (economics)|capital]] could not solve the problem, since it only led to limited transmission of technology, but not the process of innovation itself. Baran and others frequently spoke of the [[international division of labour]] – skilled workers in the center; unskilled in the periphery – when discussing key features of dependency.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Baran placed surplus extraction and [[capital accumulation]] at the center of his analysis. Development depends on a population's producing more than it needs for bare subsistence (a surplus). Further, some of that surplus must be used for capital accumulation – the purchase of new [[means of production]] – if development is to occur; spending the surplus on things like luxury consumption does not produce development. Baran noted two predominant kinds of economic activity in poor countries. In the older of the two, plantation agriculture, which originated in [[Colonialism|colonial times]], most of the surplus goes to the landowners, who use it to emulate the consumption patterns of wealthy people in the developed world; much of it thus goes to purchase foreign-produced luxury items –automobiles, clothes, etc. – and little is accumulated for investing in development. The more recent kind of economic activity in the periphery is industry—but of a particular kind. It is usually carried out by foreigners, although often in conjunction with local interests. It is often under special [[tariff]] protection or other government concessions. The surplus from this production mostly goes to two places: part of it is sent back to the foreign [[shareholder]]s as [[Profit (economics)|profit]]; the other part is spent on conspicuous consumption in a similar fashion to that of the plantation aristocracy. Again, little is used for development. Baran thought that political revolution was necessary to break this pattern.

In the 1960s, members of the Latin American Structuralist school argued that there is more latitude in the system than the Marxists believed. They argued that it allows for partial development or "dependent development"&amp;ndash;development, but still under the control of outside decision makers. They cited the partly successful attempts at [[industrialisation]] in Latin America around that time (Argentina, Brazil, Mexico) as evidence for this hypothesis. They were led to the position that dependency is not a relation between commodity exporters and industrialised countries, but between countries with different degrees of industrialisation. In their approach, there is a distinction made between the economic and political spheres: economically, one may be developed or underdeveloped; but even if (somewhat) economically developed, one may be politically autonomous or dependent.&lt;ref&gt;So, Alvin Y. 1990. Social Change and Development: Modernization, Dependency, and World-Systems Theory. Newbury Park, London and New Delhi: Sage Publications
&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Guillermo O'Donnell]] has argued that constraints placed on development by [[neoliberalism]] were lifted by the military coups in Latin America that came to promote development in authoritarian guise (O'Donnell, 1982).&lt;ref&gt;G O'Donnell, ''El Estado Burocrático Autoritario: Triunfos, Derrotas y Crisis'', Buenos Aires, Universidad de Belgrano, written 1982, published 1996, cited in Vernengo, ''Technology, Finance and Dependency'', p 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance of [[multinational corporation]]s and state promotion of technology were emphasised by the Latin American Structuralists.

Fajnzybler has made a distinction between systemic or authentic competitiveness, which is the ability to compete based on higher productivity, and spurious competitiveness, which is based on low wages.&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Vernengo, p 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Debt of developing countries|third-world debt]] crisis of the 1980s and continued stagnation in Africa and Latin America in the 1990s caused some doubt as to the feasibility or desirability of "dependent development".&lt;ref&gt;Vernengo, p 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''sine qua non'' of the dependency relationship is not the difference in technological sophistication, as traditional dependency theorists believe, but rather the difference in financial strength between core and peripheral countries&amp;ndash;particularly the inability of peripheral countries to borrow in their own currency. He believes that the [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] position of the United States is very strong because of the importance of its financial markets and because it controls the international [[reserve currency]] &amp;ndash; the [[United States dollar|US dollar]]. He believes that the end of the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods international financial agreements]] in the early 1970s considerably strengthened the United States' position because it removed some constraints on their financial actions.

"Standard" dependency theory differs from Marxism, in arguing against [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]] and any hope of progress in less developed nations towards industrialization and a liberating revolution. Theotonio dos Santos described a "new dependency", which focused on both the internal and external relations of less-developed countries of the periphery, derived from a Marxian analysis. Former Brazilian President [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]] (in office 1995&amp;ndash;2002) wrote extensively on dependency theory while in political exile during the 1960s, arguing that it was an approach to studying the economic disparities between the centre and periphery. Cardoso summarized his version of dependency theory as follows:
*there is a financial and technological penetration by the developed capitalist centers of the countries of the periphery and semi-periphery;
*this produces an unbalanced economic structure both within the peripheral societies and between them and the centers;
*this leads to limitations on self-sustained growth in the periphery;
*this favors the appearance of specific patterns of [[Social class|class]] relations;
*these require modifications in the role of the state to guarantee both the functioning of the economy and the political articulation of a society, which contains, within itself, foci of inarticulateness and structural imbalance.&lt;ref&gt;Cardoso &amp; Faletto, 1979, cited in Tausch, ''Sustainable Development and Turkey's Accession'', about 1/6 of way through.&lt;/ref&gt;

The analysis of development patterns in the 1990s and beyond is complicated by the fact that capitalism develops not smoothly, but with very strong and self-repeating ups and downs, called cycles. Relevant results are given in studies by Joshua Goldstein, Volker Bornschier, and Luigi Scandella.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

With the economic growth of India and some East Asian economies, dependency theory has lost some of its former influence. It still influences some [[NGO]] campaigns, such as [[Make Poverty History]] and the [[fair trade]] movement.

==Other theorists and related theories==
Two other early writers relevant to dependency theory were [[François Perroux]] and [[Kurt W. Rothschild|Kurt Rothschild]]. Other leading dependency theorists include Herb Addo, [[Walden Bello]], Ruy Mauro Marini, Enzo Faletto, Armando Cordova, Ernest Feder, Pablo González Casanova, [[Keith Griffin (economist)|Keith Griffin]], [[Kunibert Raffer]], Paul Israel Singer, and Osvaldo Sunkel. Many of these authors focused their attention on Latin America; the leading dependency theorist in the Islamic world is the Egyptian economist [[Samir Amin]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tausch|first=Arno|date=2003|title=Social Cohesion, Sustainable Development and Turkey's Accession to the European Union: Implications from a Global Model|url=http://alternativesjournal.net/article/view/5000159492/5000143927|journal=[[Alternatives: Turkish Journal of International Relations]]|volume=2|issue=1|doi=|pmid=|via=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827004744/http://alternativesjournal.net/article/view/5000159492/5000143927|archivedate=27 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tausch,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; based on works of Amin from 1973 to 1997, lists the following main characteristics of periphery capitalism:
#Regression in both agriculture and small scale industry characterizes the period after the onslaught of foreign domination and colonialism
#Unequal international specialization of the periphery leads to the concentration of activities in export-oriented agriculture and or mining. Some industrialization of the periphery is possible under the condition of low wages, which, together with rising productivity, determine that unequal exchange sets in (double factorial terms of trade &lt; 1.0; see Raffer, 1987)
#These structures determine in the long run a rapidly growing tertiary sector with hidden unemployment and the rising importance of rent in the overall social and economic system
#Chronic current account balance deficits, re-exported profits of foreign investments, and deficient business cycles at the periphery that provide important markets for the centers during world economic upswings
#Structural imbalances in the political and social relationships, inter alia a strong '[[wikt:comprador|compradore]]' element and the rising importance of state capitalism and an indebted state class&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The American sociologist [[Immanuel Wallerstein]] refined the Marxist aspect of the theory and expanded on it, to form [[world-systems theory]]. This postulates a third category of countries, the ''semi-periphery'', intermediate between the core and periphery. Wallerstein believed in a tri-modal rather than a bi-modal system because he viewed the world-systems as more complicated than a simplistic classification as either core or periphery nations. To Wallerstein, many nations do not fit into one of these two categories, so he proposed the idea of a semi-periphery as an in between state within his model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Change and Development: Modernization, Dependency, and World-Systems Theory|last=So|first=Alvin|publisher=[[SAGE Publications]]|year=1990|isbn=|location=Newbury Park, London|pages=169-199|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, the semi-periphery is industrialized, but with less sophistication of technology than in the core; and it does not control finances. The rise of one group of semi-peripheries tends to be at the cost of another group, but the unequal structure of the world economy based on unequal exchange tends to remain stable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Tausch&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; traces the beginnings of world-systems theory to the writings of the Austro-Hungarian socialist [[Karl Polanyi]] after the [[World War I|First World War]], but its present form is usually associated with the work of Wallerstein.

Dependency theory has also been associated with [[Johan Galtung]]'s structural theory of imperialism.

Dependency theorists hold that short-term spurts of growth notwithstanding, long-term growth in the periphery will be imbalanced and unequal, and will tend towards high negative [[current account]] balances.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Cyclical fluctuations also have a profound effect on cross-national comparisons of economic growth and societal development in the medium and long run. What seemed like spectacular long-run growth may in the end turn out to be just a short run cyclical spurt after a long recession. Cycle time plays an important role. [[Giovanni Arrighi]] believed that the logic of accumulation on a world scale shifts over time, and that the 1980s and beyond once more showed a deregulated phase of world capitalism with a logic, characterized - in contrast to earlier regulatory cycles - by the dominance of financial capital.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

It is argued that, at this stage, the role of [[unequal exchange]] in the entire relationship of dependency cannot be underestimated.{{Clarify|date=August 2016}} Unequal exchange is given if double factorial terms of trade of the respective country are &lt; 1.0 (Raffer, 1987, Amin, 1975).

The former ideological head of the [[Blekingegade Gang]] and political activist [[Torkil Lauesen]] argues in his book ''The Global Perspective'' that political theory and practice stemming from dependency theory are more relevant than ever.&lt;ref&gt;Lauesen, Torkil. ''The Global Perspective: Reflections on Imperialism and Resistance''. Montreal: Kersplebedeb, 2018. p. 321ff.&lt;/ref&gt; He postulates that the conflict between countries in the core and countries in the periphery has been ever-intensifying and that the world is at the onset of a resolution of the core-periphery contradiction – that humanity is "in for an economic and political rollercoaster ride".&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Economic policies based on dependency theory has been criticized by [[Free market|free-market]] economists such as [[Peter Thomas Bauer|Peter Bauer]] and [[Martin Wolf]] and others:&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Korotayev A., Zinkina J. [http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=361&amp;Itemid=1 On the structure of the present-day convergence. ''Campus-Wide Information Systems''. Vol. 31 No. 2/3, 2014, pp. 139–152]&lt;/ref&gt;

*Lack of competition: by subsidizing in-country industries and preventing outside imports, these companies may have less incentive to improve their products, to try to become more efficient in their processes, to please customers, or to research new innovations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Michelle|title=The End of the Developmental State?|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0415854822|pages=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Sustainability: industries reliant on government support may not be sustainable for very long, particularly in poorer countries and countries which largely depend on foreign aid from more developed countries.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}
*Domestic opportunity costs: subsidies on domestic industries come out of state coffers and therefore represent money not spent in other ways, like development of domestic infrastructure, seed capital or need-based social welfare programs.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} At the same time, the higher prices caused by tariffs and restrictions on imports require the people either to forgo these goods altogether or buy them at higher prices, forgoing other goods.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Market economists cite a number of examples in their arguments against dependency theory. The improvement of [[India]]'s economy after it moved from state-controlled business to open trade is one of the most often cited (''see also'' [[economy of India]], ''[[The Commanding Heights]]''). India's example seems to contradict dependency theorists' claims concerning comparative advantage and mobility, as much as its economic growth originated from movements such as [[outsourcing]] – one of the most mobile forms of capital transfer. [[South Korea]] and [[North Korea]] provide another example of trade-based development vs. autocratic self-sufficiency. Following the Korean War, North Korea pursued a policy of [[import substitution industrialization]] as suggested by dependency theory, while South Korea pursued a policy of [[export-oriented industrialization]] as suggested by comparative advantage theory. In 2013, South Korea's per capita GDP was 18 times that of North Korea. In Africa, states which have emphasized import-substitution development, such as [[Zimbabwe]], have typically been among the worst performers, while the continent's most successful non-oil based economies, such as [[Egypt]], [[South Africa]], and [[Tunisia]], have pursued trade-based development.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/economic_studies/whats_driving_africas_growth&lt;/ref&gt;

According to economic historian Robert C. Allen, dependency theory's claims are "debatable", and that the protectionism that was implemented in Latin America as a solution ended up failing.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oupcanada.com/catalog/9780199596652.html|title=Global Economic History: A Very Short Introduction {{!}} Robert C.

== History ==
[[File:1831-View-Whitechapel-Road-steam-carriage-caricature.jpg|250px|thumb|1831 cartoon, warning about road troubles of the future.]]
In the early 20th century, cars entered [[mass production]]. The United States produced 45,000 cars in 1907, but 28 years later, in 1935, this had increased nearly 90-fold to 3,971,000.&lt;ref name="Bradford J. DeLong" /&gt; This increase in production required a new large work force. In 1913 there were 13,623 people working for [[Ford Motor Company]], but by 1915 this had increased to 18,028.&lt;ref name="Bradford J. DeLong"&gt;{{cite web |last=DeLong |first=Bradford |title=The Roaring Twenties." Slouching Towards Utopia? The Economic History of the Twentieth Century. |url=http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/tceh/slouch_roaring13.html |accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=October 2016}} [[Bradford DeLong]], author of [[The Roaring Twenties]], tells us that "Many more lined up outside the Ford factory for chances to work at what appeared to them to be (and, for those who did not mind the pace of the [[assembly line]] much, was) an incredible [[boondoggle]] of a job.&lt;ref name="Bradford J. DeLong"/&gt;" There was a surge in the need for workers at big, new [[high-technology]] companies such as Ford. [[Employment]] increased greatly.
[[File:Sacrifices to the Modern Moloch.jpg|thumb|''Sacrifices to the Modern [[Moloch]]'', a cartoon published in [[The New York Times]], satirising the indifference from the society regarding the increasing on automobile related traffic fatalities.]]
Though, when the motor age arrived in western countries at the beginning of the 20th century, many conservative intellectuals opposed the increase in motor vehicles on the roads. These increases removed space for pedestrians, and brought a tremendous increase in pedestrian deaths caused by car collisions.

[[W.S. Gilbert]], a famous British [[librettist]], wrote to ''[[The Times]]'' on 3 June 1903:

{{Cquote|''Sir,–I am delighted with the suggestion made by your spirited correspondent Sir Ralph Payne-Gallwey that all pedestrians shall be legally empowered to discharge shotguns (the size of the shot to be humanely restricted to No. 8 or No. 9) at all motorists who may appear to them to be driving to the common danger. Not only would this provide a speedy and effective punishment for the erring motorist, but it would also supply the dwellers on popular highroads with a comfortable increase of income. "Motor shooting for a single gun" would appeal strongly to the sporting instincts of the true Briton, and would provide ample compensation to the proprietors of eligible road-side properties for the intolerable annoyance caused by the enemies of mankind.''  }}

Ten years later, Alfred Godley wrote a more elaborate protest, "[[The Motor Bus]]", a poem which cleverly combined a lesson in Latin grammar with an expression of distaste for innovative motor transport.

==Access and convenience==
[[File:APlus AH Plaza Secaucus jeh.JPG|thumb|[[Convenience store]] in a [[rest area]] serving [[New Jersey Turnpike]] users.]]
Worldwide, the car has allowed easier access to remote places. However, average journey times to regularly visited places have increased in large cities, as a result of widespread car adoption and [[urban sprawl]], as well as the [[History of trams#Disappearance from many cities|decommissioning of older tram systems]]. This is due to [[traffic congestion]] and the increased distances between home and work brought about by urban sprawl.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |last=Gilbert |first=Alan |title=The mega-city in Latin America |publisher=United Nations University Press |year=1996 |isbn=92-808-0935-0}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of car access issues in underdeveloped countries are for example the paving of [[Mexican Federal Highway 1]] through [[Baja California]], completing the connection of [[Cabo San Lucas]] to [[California]]. In [[Madagascar]], another example, about 30% of the population does not have access to reliable all-weather roads&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldbank.org/transport/rural_tr/gp_docs/madagascar.htm |title=Madagascar: The Development of a National Rural Transport Program |publisher=Worldbank.org |date=2010-11-23 |accessdate=2011-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[China]], 184 towns and 54,000 villages have no motor road (or roads at all).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/2003/May/64719.htm |title='&amp;#39;China Through a Lens: Rural Road Construction Speeded Up'&amp;#39; |publisher=China.org.cn |date=2003-05-16 |accessdate=2011-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain developments in retail are partially due to car use, such as drive-thru [[fast food]] purchasing and [[Gasoline station]] grocery shopping.

== Economic changes ==

=== Employment and consumption habits ===
[[File:Ravenswood 101 signs.jpg|thumb|High signs attract the attention of drivers on the adjacent [[freeway]].]]
[[File:Ancaster suburbs.jpg|thumb|A street without a sidewalk, where the [[pedestrian]] must walk on the road pavement.]]

The development of the car has contributed to changes in employment distribution, shopping patterns, social interactions, manufacturing priorities and [[city planning]]; increasing use of cars has reduced the roles of [[walking]], [[horse]]s and [[railroad]]s.&lt;ref name="crabgrass"&gt;{{cite crabgrass}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to money for roadway construction, car use was also encouraged in many places through new [[zoning laws]] that allowed any new business to construct a certain amount of parking based on the size and type of facility. The effect was to create many free [[parking]] spaces, and business places further back from the road. In aggregate, this led to less dense settlements and made a carless lifestyle increasingly unattractive.

Many new [[shopping center]]s and [[suburbs]] did not install [[sidewalk]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.startribune.com/local/11588256.html Sidewalks? Too Pedestrian] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304175542/http://www.startribune.com/local/11588256.html |date=2014-03-04 }} by: Mary Jane Smetanka Minneapolis-St Paul Star Tribune, Aut 18, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; making pedestrian access dangerous.  This had the effect of encouraging people to drive, even for short trips that might have been walkable, thus increasing and solidifying American auto-dependency.&lt;ref name="parking"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bV622ieCXakC Lots of Parking: Land Use in a Car Culture] By John A. Jakle, Keith A. Sculle. 2004. {{ISBN|0-8139-2266-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this change, employment opportunities for people who were not wealthy enough to own a car and for people who could not drive, due to age or physical disabilities, became severely limited.&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;[[When Work Disappears]] by William Julius Wilson. {{ISBN|0-679-72417-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic growth ===
[[File:Motorisation rate vs Economic growth in Europe.png|left|thumb|upright=1.2|Motorisation rate&lt;ref name="Eurostat1"&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tsdpc340&amp;plugin=1 Motorisation Rate]; ''Cars per 1000 inhabitants in Europe'', Eurostat&lt;/ref&gt; vs. Economic growth&lt;ref name="Eurostat2"&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tec00115&amp;plugin=1 Economic Growth], ''Real GDP growth rate - volume, Percentage change on previous year'', Eurostat.&lt;/ref&gt; in European countries whose population is greater than 1 million inhabitants. Source: Eurostat.]]
In countries with major car manufacturers, such as USA or Germany, a certain degree of car dependency might be positive for the economy at a macroeconomic level, since it demands automobile production, therefore resulting also in job demand and tax revenue. These economic conditions were particularly valid during the 1920s when the number of automobiles, worldwide, had a substantial annual average increase, but also during the [[post–World War II economic expansion]]. Notwithstanding the growing effects provided by the automobile on the economy of some countries, several other auto-dependent countries, deprived from automobile industry and oil resources, have to allocate substantial economic assets, to satisfy its mobility policies, affecting then their [[commercial balance]]. This situation is broadly valid in the majority of the European countries, since, disregarding some few exceptions such as [[Energy in Norway|Norway]], Europe is largely dependent on imports for its fossil fuels. Furthermore, just few European countries, such as Germany or France, have car manufacturers productive enough to satisfy their country's internal demand for cars. All these factors related to high motorisation rates, affect therefore the economic growth in the majority of the European countries.&lt;ref name="Eurostat1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Eurostat2"/&gt; Most African countries are also dependant from imported cars, usually second-hand from Western countries, some of those vehicles being in a very worn-out state. Finally, even countries with oil ressources could be deprived of refineries, such as Nigeria which has to import fuel even though it is a major oil producer.

=== Employment in the automotive industry ===
As of 2009 the U.S. motor vehicle manufacturing industry employed 880,000 workers, or approximately 6.6% of the U.S. manufacturing workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Michaela|first=Platzer|last2=Glennon|first2=Harrison|title=The U.S. Automotive Industry: National and State Trends in Manufacturing Employment|url=http://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1671&amp;context=key_workplace|journal=Congressional Research Service|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traffic==
{{Main|Traffic}}
Cycling steadily became more important in Europe over the first half of the twentieth century, but it dropped off dramatically in the United States between 1900 and 1910. Automobiles became the preferred means of transportation. Over the 1920s, bicycles gradually became considered children's toys, and by 1940 most bicycles in the United States were made for children.
From the early 20th century until after World War II, the [[roadster (bicycle)|roadster]] constituted most adult bicycles sold in the United Kingdom and in many parts of the British Empire. For many years after the advent of the motorcycle and automobile, they remained a primary means of adult transport. In several places - both high and low income - bicycles have retained or regained this position. In Denmark, cycling policies were adopted as a direct consequence of the [[1973 oil crisis]] whereas bike advocacy in the Netherlands started in earnest with a campaign against traffic deaths called "stop child murder". Today both countries have high [[modal share]]s of cycling despite high car ownership rates.

==Cultural changes==
Prior to the appearance of the automobile, horses, walking and [[tram|streetcars]] were the major [[modes of transportation]] within cities.&lt;ref name="crabgrass"/&gt; Horses require a large amount of care, and were therefore kept in public facilities that were usually far from residences. The wealthy could afford to keep horses for private use, hence the term [[carriage]] trade referred to elite patronage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/carriage+trade Carriage trade] The Free Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; Horse [[manure]] left on the streets also created a [[sanitation]] problem.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Strasser, ''Waste and Want: A Social History of Trash'', Owl Books, 355 pages (1999) {{ISBN|978-0-8050-6512-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The motorcycle made regular medium-distance travel more convenient and affordable and after World War I the automobile too, especially in areas without railways.  Because cars did not require rest, were faster than horse-drawn conveyances, and soon had a lower [[total cost of ownership]], more people were routinely able to travel farther than in earlier times. The construction of [[controlled-access highway|highways]] in the 1950s continued this.  Some experts suggest that many of these changes began during the earlier [[Bicycle craze|Golden age of the bicycle]], from 1880 to 1915.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Robert (1972). ''A Social History of the Bicycle, its Early Life and Times in America''. American Heritage Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changes to urban society===
[[File:Ngaajyunlapgaau.JPG|thumb|Urban interchange in [[Shenzhen]]]]
Beginning in the 1940s, most urban environments in the [[United States]] lost their [[streetcars]], [[Cable car (railway)|cable cars]], and other forms of [[light rail]], to be replaced by [[diesel fuel|diesel]]-burning motor coaches or [[buses]].  Many of these have never returned, but some urban communities eventually installed [[rapid transit]].

Another change brought about by the car is that modern urban pedestrians must be more alert than their ancestors.  In the past, a pedestrian had to worry about relatively slow-moving streetcars or other obstacles of travel.  With the proliferation of the car, a pedestrian has to anticipate safety risks of automobiles traveling at high speeds because they can cause serious injuries to a human and can be fatal,&lt;ref name="crabgrass" /&gt; unlike in previous times when traffic deaths were usually due to horses escaping control.

According to many social scientists, the loss of [[pedestrian]]-scale villages has also disconnected communities. Many people in developed countries have less contact with their neighbors and rarely walk unless they place a high value on [[exercise]].&lt;ref name="fromhighway"&gt;[http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=ENV&amp;recid=5182080&amp;q=car+culture&amp;uid=789848837&amp;setcookie=yes From Highway to Superhighway: The Sustainability, Symbolism and Situated Practices of Car Culture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118033911/http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=ENV&amp;recid=5182080&amp;q=car+culture&amp;uid=789848837&amp;setcookie=yes |date=2007-11-18 }} Graves-Brown.

=== Advent of suburban society ===
In the decades following World War II, the auto united in the United States with the single family dwelling to form suburbs. Suburban affluence led to a baby boomer generation far removed from the hardships of their parents.  Community standards of the past, driven by scarcity and the need to share public resources, gave way to new credos of self-exploration.  As the economy of the fifties and sixties boomed, car sales grew steadily, from 6 million units sold per year in the U.S. to 10 million.  Married women entered into the economy and two car households became commonplace.  In the seventies, however, the comparative economic stagnation then experienced was accompanied by societal self-reflection on the changes the auto brought.  Critics of automotive society found little positive choice in the decision to move to the suburbs; the physical movement was looked upon as flight.  The auto industry was also under attack from bureaucratic fronts, and new emission and CAFÉ regulations began to hamper Big Three profit margins.

Kenneth Schneider in Autokind vs Mankind (1971) called for a war against the auto, derided it for being a destroyer of cities, and likened its proliferation to a disease.  Renowned social critic Vance Packard in A Nation of Strangers (1972) blamed the geographic mobility enabled by the auto for loneliness and social isolation.  Auto sales peaked in 1973, at 14.6 million units sold, and were not to reach comparable levels for another decade. The 1973 Arab-Israeli War was followed by the OPEC oil embargo, leading to an explosion of prices, long gas lines, and talk of rationing.

While it may appear clear, in retrospect, that the automotive/suburban culture would continue to flourish, as it did in the 1950s and 1960s, no such certainty existed at the time when British architect Martin Pawley authored his seminal work, The Private Future (1973).  Pawley called the automobile “the shibboleth of privatization; the symbol and the actuality of withdrawal from the community” and perceived that, in spite of its momentary misfortunes, its dominance in North American society would continue.  The car was a private world that allowed for fantasy and escape, and Pawley forecasted that it would grow in size, and in technological capacities.  He saw no pathology in consumer behavior grounded in freedom of expression.

Improved transport accelerated the outward growth of cities and the development of [[suburb]]s beyond an earlier era's [[streetcar suburb]]s.&lt;ref name="crabgrass" /&gt; Until the advent of the car, [[factory worker]]s lived either close to the factory or in high density communities farther away, connected to the factory by [[streetcar]] or [[Rail transport|rail]]. The car and the federal [[Subsidy#Infrastructure subsidies|subsidies]] for roads and suburban development that supported car culture allowed people to live in low density [[residential area]]s even farther from the [[city center]] and [[Racial integration|integrated]] city neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="crabgrass" /&gt; were [[Industrial suburb]]s being few, due in part to [[single use zoning]], they created few local jobs and residents commuted longer distances to work each day as the suburbs continued to expand.&lt;ref name="asphalt" /&gt;

===Cars in popular culture===
{{see also|Automobile folklore}}

====In The United States====
[[File:James Dean and Porsche Speedster 23F at Palm Springs Races March, 1955.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|[[James Dean]] inside a Porsche Speedster]]

The car had a significant effect on the [[culture of the United States]]. As other vehicles had been, cars were incorporated into artworks including music, books and movies. Between 1905 and 1908, more than 120 songs were written in which the automobile was the subject.&lt;ref name="crabgrass" /&gt;{{failed verification|date=February 2016}} Although authors such as [[Booth Tarkington]] decried the automobile age in books including ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons]]'' (1918), novels celebrating the political effects of motorization included ''[[Free Air]]'' (1919) by [[Sinclair Lewis]], which followed in the tracks of earlier [[Bicycle touring#Social significance|bicycle touring]] novels. Some early 20th century experts doubted the safety and suitability of allowing female automobilists. [[Dorothy Levitt]] was among those eager to lay such concerns to rest, so much so that a century later only one country had a [[women to drive movement]]. Where 19th-century mass media had made heroes of [[Casey Jones]], [[Allan Pinkerton]] and other stalwart protectors of public transport, new [[road movie]]s offered heroes who found freedom and equality, rather than duty and hierarchy, on the open road.

[[George Monbiot]] writes that widespread car culture has shifted voter's preference to the [[right-wing]] of the political spectrum, and thinks that car culture has contributed to an increase in individualism and fewer social interactions between members of different socioeconomic classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=George Monbiot |url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/columnist/story/0,9321,1671055,00.html |title=George Monbiot, '&amp;#39;The Guardian'&amp;#39;, December 20, 2005 |publisher=Politics.guardian.co.uk |date=2005-12-20 |accessdate=2011-01-09 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Motor League]] had promoted the making of more and better cars since the early days of the car, and the [[American Automobile Association]] joined the [[good roads movement]] begun during the earlier [[bicycle craze]]; when manufacturers and petroleum fuel suppliers were well established, they also joined construction contractors in lobbying governments to build public roads.&lt;ref name="asphalt"/&gt;

As [[tourism]] became motorized, individuals, families and small groups were able to vacation in distant locations such as [[national park]]s. Roads including the [[Blue Ridge Parkway]] were built specifically to help the urban masses experience natural scenery previously seen only by a few. Cheap restaurants and [[motel]]s appeared on favorite routes and provided wages for locals who were reluctant to join the trend to [[rural depopulation]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

====Europe====
[[File:1973 Triumph TR6 Roadster (16313636976).jpg|thumb|1973 Triumph TR6 Roadster]]
Road building was sometimes also influenced by [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian-style]] political ideologies. In Europe, massive freeway building programs were initiated by a number of [[social democratic]] governments after [[World War II]], in an attempt to create jobs and make the car available to the working classes. From the 1970s, promotion of the automobile increasingly became a trait of some [[Conservatism|conservatives]]. [[Margaret Thatcher]] mentioned a "great car economy" in the paper on [[Roads for Prosperity]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The 1973 oil crisis and with it fuel rationing measures brought to light for the first time in a generation, what cities without cars might look like, reinvigorating or creating environmental consciousness in the process. Green parties emerged in several European countries in partial response to car culture, but also as the political arm of the anti-nuclear movement.

===Cinema===
The rise of car culture during the twentieth century, played an important cultural role in cinema, mainly through [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbusters]]. Important characters such as [[James Bond]], or the ones performed by [[James Dean]], were always provided on scene with powerful automobiles, which through time, have become cultural icons.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

===Cars as a lifestyle===
[[File:WindmillSaabs.jpg|thumb|180px|International [[Saab Group|Saab]] Club meeting in [[Latvia]].]]
Over time, the car has evolved beyond being a means of transportation or status symbol and into a subject of interest and a cherished lifestyle amongst many people in the world, who appreciate cars for their craftsmanship, their performance, as well as the vast arrays of [[car club|activities]] one can take part in with his/her car.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aaca.org/About-AACA/an-introduction-to-aaca.html. ''A Concise History of AACA in the Beginning''. Antique Automobile Club of America. Retrieved on February 20, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; People who have a keen interest in cars and/or participate in the car hobby are known as "Car Enthusiasts".

One major aspect of the hobby is collecting. Cars, especially [[vintage car|classic vehicles]], are appreciated by their owners as having aesthetic, recreational and historic value.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wealthdaily.com/articles/investing-in-classic-cars/4748. ''Investing in classic cars''. Retrieved on April 5, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Such demand generates investment potential and allows some cars to command extraordinarily high prices and become financial instruments in their own right.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/info-invcar04.html. "The Dow Jones Classic Car Index". The Wall Street Journal. Retrieved on July 14, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

A second major aspect of the car hobby is vehicle modification, as many car enthusiasts modify their cars to achieve performance improvements or visual enhancements. Many subcultures exist within this segment of the car hobby, for example, those building their own custom vehicles, primarily appearance-based on original examples or reproductions of pre-1948 US car market designs and similar designs from the World War II era and earlier from elsewhere in the world, are known as [[hot rod]]ders, while those who believe cars should stay true to their original designs and not be modified are known as "[[wikt:purist|Purist]]s".

In addition, [[motorsport]] (both professional and amateur) as well as casual driving events, where enthusiasts from around the world gather to drive and display their cars, are important pillars of the car hobby as well. Notable examples such events are the annual [[Mille Miglia]] classic car rally and the [[Gumball 3000]] supercar race.

Many [[car club]]s have been set up to facilitate social interactions and companionships amongst those who take pride in owning, maintaining, driving and showing their cars. Many prestigious social events around the world today are centered around the hobby, a notable example is the [[Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance]] classic car show.

==Safety and traffic collisions==

Motor vehicle [[accident]]s account for 37.5% of accidental deaths in the United States, making them the country's leading cause of accidental death.&lt;ref&gt;Directly from: http://www.benbest.com/lifeext/causes.html See '' Accident as a Cause of Death''&lt;br&gt;Derived from: National Vital Statistics Report, Volume 50, Number 15 (September 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Though travelers in cars suffer fewer deaths per journey, or per unit time or distance, than most other users of [[private transport]] such as bicyclers or pedestrians {{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}, cars are also more used, making [[automobile safety]] an important topic of study. For those aged 5–34 in the United States, motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death, claiming the lives of 18,266 Americans each year.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cdc.gov/injury/overview/data.html&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=March 2018}}

It is estimated that motor vehicle collisions caused the death of around 60 million people during the 20th century&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medcrunch.net/death-20th-century-infographic/ |title=Death in the 20th Century.

Notwithstanding the high number of fatalities, the trend of motor vehicle collision is showing a decrease. Road toll figures in developed nations show that car collision fatalities have declined since 1980. Japan is an extreme [[List of motor vehicle deaths in Japan by year|example]], with road deaths decreasing to 5,115 in 2008, which is 25% of the 1970 rate per capita and 17% of the 1970 rate per vehicle distance travelled. In 2008, for the first time, more pedestrians than vehicle occupants were killed in Japan by cars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japantoday.com/category/national/view/pedestrians-become-chief-victims-of-road-accident-deaths-in-2008 Pedestrians become chief victims of road accident deaths in 2008] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090725140530/http://www.japantoday.com/category/national/view/pedestrians-become-chief-victims-of-road-accident-deaths-in-2008 |date=2009-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides improving general road conditions like lighting and separated walkways, Japan has been installing [[intelligent transportation system]] technology such as stalled-car monitors to avoid crashes.

In developing nations, statistics may be grossly inaccurate or hard to get. Some nations have not significantly reduced the total death rate, which stands at 12,000 in Thailand in 2007, for example.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.thaihealth.or.th/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=133&amp;Itemid=1 365 Days for Stopping Accident Deaths]&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, twenty-eight states had reductions in the number of automobile crash fatalities between 2005 and 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoaccidentattorneys.net/injuries/auto-death-state.html People Killed in Motor Vehicle Crashes, by State, 2005-2006]&lt;/ref&gt; 55% of vehicle occupants 16 years or older in 2006 were not using [[seat belts]] when they crashed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=NCSA Research Note (DOT-HS-810-948) |publisher=US [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] |date=May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Road fatality trends tend to follow [[Smeed's law]],&lt;ref name=smeed&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geog.ucl.ac.uk/~jadams/PDFs/smeed%27s%20law.pdf |format=PDF |first=John |last=Adams |publisher=[[University College London]] |title=Smeed's Law : some further thoughts}}&lt;/ref&gt; an empirical schema that correlates increased fatality rates per capita with traffic congestion.

==External and internal costs==
{{Main|Economics of automobile usage}}

===Public or external costs===
{{Main|Externalities of automobiles}}
According to the ''Handbook on estimation of external costs in the transport sector''&lt;ref name="Delft"&gt;
{{cite journal |author1=M. Maibach |author2=C. Schreyer |author3=D. Sutter |author4=H.P. van Essen |author5=B.H. Boon |author6=R. Smokers |author7=A. Schroten |author8=C. Doll |author9=B.

&lt;/ref&gt; made by the [[Delft University]] and which is the main reference in [[European Union]] for assessing the [[Externality|externalities]] of cars, the main external costs of driving a car are:

*[[Traffic congestion|congestion]] and [[scarcity]] costs,
*[[Traffic collision|accident]] costs,
*[[air pollution]] costs,
*[[noise]] costs,
*[[climate change]] costs,
*costs for nature and landscape,
*costs for [[water pollution]],
*costs for [[soil pollution]] and
*costs of [[Energy independence|energy dependency]].

Use of cars for transportation creates barriers by reducing the landscape required for walking and cycling. It may look like a minor problem initially but in the long run, it poses a threat to children and the elderly. Transport is a major [[land use]], leaving less land available for other purposes.

Cars also contribute to pollution of air and water.  Though a horse produces more waste, cars are cheaper, thus far more numerous in urban areas than horses ever were. Emissions of harmful gases like [[carbon monoxide]], ozone, carbon dioxide, benzene and [[particulate matter]] can damage living organisms and the environment.  The emissions from cars cause disabilities, respiratory diseases, and [[ozone depletion]]. [[Noise pollution]] from cars can also potentially result in hearing disabilities, headaches, and stress to those frequently exposed to it.

[[Image:SaoPaulo PrestesMaia.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|left|Congestion is a notorious [[Externalities of automobiles|external cost]] of driving, such as in [[São Paulo]] (pictured).]]

In countries such as the United States the [[transport infrastructure|infrastructure]] that makes car use possible, such as highways, roads and parking lots is funded by the government and supported through zoning and construction requirements.&lt;ref name="Shoup"&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=K1qYHgAACAAJ&amp;dq=%22the+high+cost+of+free+parking%22&amp;ei=G56TR8SwMIKg7gLz-sGtBw&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1 The High Cost of Free Parking]'' by [[Donald C. Shoup]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fuel taxes in the United States]] cover about 60% of highway construction and repair costs, but little of the cost to construct or repair local roads.&lt;ref name="Vuchic"&gt;Graph based on data from ''Transportation for Livable Cities'' By Vukan R. Vuchic p. 76. 1999. {{ISBN|0-88285-161-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MacKenzie, J.J., R.C. Dower, and D.D.T. Chen. 1992. ''[http://www.wristore.com/goinratwhati.html The Going Rate: What It Really Costs to Drive]''. Washington, DC: World Resources Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; Payments by motor-vehicle users fall short of government expenditures tied to motor-vehicle use by 20–70 cents per gallon of gas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.its.ucdavis.edu/people/faculty/delucchi&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zoning]] laws in many areas require that large, [[free parking]] lots accompany any new buildings. Municipal parking lots are often free or do not charge a [[market rate]]. Hence, the cost of driving a car in the US is subsidized, supported by businesses and the government who cover the cost of roads and parking.&lt;ref name="Shoup" /&gt; This is in addition to other external costs car users do not pay like accidents or pollution. Even in countries with higher gas taxes like Germany motorists don't fully pay for the external costs they create.

This government support of the automobile through subsidies for infrastructure, the cost of [[highway patrol]] enforcement, recovering [[Motor vehicle theft|stolen cars]], and many other factors makes public transport a less economically competitive choice for commuters when considering [[Out-of-pocket expenses]]. Consumers often make choices based on those costs, and underestimate the [[indirect costs]] of car ownership, insurance and maintenance.&lt;ref name="Vuchic" /&gt; However, globally and in some US cities, tolls and parking fees partially offset these heavy subsidies for driving. [[Transportation planning]] policy advocates often support tolls, increased fuel taxes, [[congestion pricing]] and market-rate pricing for municipal parking as a means of balancing car use in urban centers with more efficient modes such as buses and trains.

When cities charge [[market rates]] for parking, and when bridges and tunnels are tolled, driving becomes less competitive in terms of out-of-pocket costs. When municipal parking is underpriced and roads are not tolled, most of the cost of vehicle usage is paid for by general government revenue, a subsidy for motor vehicle use. The size of this subsidy dwarfs the federal, state, and local subsidies for the maintenance of infrastructure and discounted fares for public transportation.&lt;ref name="Vuchic" /&gt;

By contrast, although there are environmental and social costs for rail, there is a very small impact.&lt;ref name="Vuchic" /&gt;

Walking or cycling often have net positive impacts on society as they help reduce health costs and produce virtually no pollution.

====Kinetic speed vs. consumer speed====
The Austrian philosopher [[Ivan Illich]], a critic of the modern society habits, was one of the first thinkers to establish the so-called '''consumer speed''' concept. He wrote in his book ''Energy and Equity''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Illich |first=Ivan |url=http://www.uvm.edu/~asnider/Ivan_Illich/Ivan%20Illich_Energy%20and%20Equity.pdf |date=1974 |title=Energy and Equity |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222231815/https://www.uvm.edu/~asnider/Ivan_Illich/Ivan%20Illich_Energy%20and%20Equity.pdf |archivedate=2015-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1974:

{{Cquote|''The model American male devotes more than 1600 hours a year to his car. He sits in it while it goes and while it stands idling. He parks it and searches for it. He earns the money to put down on it and to meet the monthly installments. He works to pay for gasoline, tolls, insurance, taxes, and tickets. He spends four of his sixteen waking hours on the road or gathering his resources for it. And this figure does not take into account the time consumed by other activities dictated by transport: time spent in hospitals, traffic courts, and garages; time spent watching automobile commercials or attending consumer education meetings to improve the quality of the next buy. The model American puts in 1600 hours to get 7500 miles: less than '''five miles per hour''' [the '''consumer speed''']. In countries deprived of a transportation industry, people manage to do the same, walking wherever they want to go, and they allocate only 3 to 8 percent of their society's time budget to traffic instead of 28 percent. What distinguishes the traffic in rich countries from the traffic in poor countries is not more mileage per hour of lifetime for the majority, but more hours of compulsory consumption of high doses of energy, packaged and unequally distributed by the transportation industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ranprieur.com/readings/illichcars.html |author=Ivan Illich, ''excerpts from Energy and Equity; also collected in Toward a History of Needs'' |title=The industrialization of traffic}}&lt;/ref&gt;''}}

It is known by [[classical mechanics]] that the average [[Kinetics (physics)|kinetic]] [[speed]] &lt;math&gt;v_k&lt;/math&gt; of an automobile and its passengers is simply the amount of space the car travels, divided by the elapsed time, i.e.:
:&lt;math&gt;v_k=\frac{d}{t_t}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the distance travelled by the car and &lt;math&gt;t_t&lt;/math&gt; is the travelled time, i.e., the time elapsed during the travel.

Though, to assess the consumer speed, we must sum the amount of time the car owner strictly allocates to work to afford such travelled distance. Then the consumer speed &lt;math&gt;v_v&lt;/math&gt; is:
:&lt;math&gt;v_v=\frac{d}{t_t+t_w}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;t_w&lt;/math&gt; is the time the driver needs to work, to afford doing that specific travelled distance &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; using such car.

=====Example=====
James (an example), a common car owner and driver who takes his car to get to work, spends totally (standing and running costs) on his car an average of €5000 per year. Considering James just uses his car to get to work and that one year has around 250 [[business day]]s, James pays on average €20 per working day to afford his car. Consider the James' average net salary is €10 per hour; then James needs to work 2 hours per day just to afford his mean of transport to get to work, time strictly allocated to pay his car bills.

If he lives 20&amp;nbsp;km away from his workplace and he gets there in half an hour, then he makes 40&amp;nbsp;km per day during one hour (round trip). His kinetic average speed would then be:
:&lt;math&gt;v_k=\frac{40\ km}{1\ h}=40\ km/h&lt;/math&gt;
Though, James needs on average 2 hours per day just to afford his car, working time budget strictly allocated for paying his car bills, so his consumer speed would be:
:&lt;math&gt;v_v=\frac{40\ km}{1\ h+2\ h}\approx 13\ km/h&lt;/math&gt;
just 1/3 of his kinetic speed.

'''''Elephant''''' is a 1964 [[science book]] by [[L. Sprague de Camp]], published by [[Pyramid Books]] as part of [[The Worlds of Science]] series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Laughlin | first=Charlotte |author2=Daniel J. H. Levack | title=De Camp: An L. Sprague de Camp Bibliography | location=San Francisco | publisher=Underwood/Miller | year=1983 | page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book treats its subject comprehensively, covering elephants in captivity and the wild, their use in ancient warfare, modern conflicts between elephants and farmers, and preservation efforts, among other topics. It is "[d]esigned for the general reader and student, about the various aspects of the world's largest land animal, from fossils to captive elephants."&lt;ref&gt;''The Science News-Letter'', v. 86, no. 13, September 26, 1964, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt;

While a decent study, the book is important more for its insight into the mind of the author than in its own right, elephants being a lifelong interest of de Camp's that figures in many of his other literary works. In his early time travel novel ''[[Lest Darkness Fall]]'' his protagonist Martin Padway pens a similar monograph, while in his historical novel ''[[An Elephant for Aristotle]]'' details the difficulties in transporting an elephant from India to [[Greece]] during ancient times. De Camp also wrote a number of articles about [[elephant]]s, a few of which appeared, together with a chapter selected from the present work, in his later collection ''[[The Fringe of the Unknown]]'' (1983).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="538">'''Emesh''' is a [[Sumerian mythology|Sumerian]] god of vegetation. He was created, alongside the god [[Enten]], at the wish of [[Enlil]] to take responsibility on earth for woods, fields, sheep folds, and stables. He is identified with the abundance of the earth and with summer.

Burning of [[charcoal]] and [[wood fuel]] provides approximately 94 percent of the energy in [[Malawi]].&lt;ref name="One"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/004/ab585e/AB585E06.htm |
title=FAO Country Report: Malawi | access-date=18 April 2018 | date=2004 |publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) |author=FAO |location=Rome}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the renewable [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] potential of the country is untapped. As of 2009, the national electrification rate in Malawi was 10%, with 37% of the urban population and only 2% of the rural population having access to electricity.&lt;ref name="Two"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S1021-447X2015000200003 |title=Energy supply in Malawi: Options and issues: Current status of energy demand and supply in Malawi |access-date=18 April 2018 | date=May 2015 |journal=Journal of Energy in Southern Africa | format=Volume 26, number 2 |location=Cape Town |author=John L Taulo, Kenneth Joseph Gondwe, and Adoniya Ben Sebitosi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In March 2018, Malawi's installed electricity-generating capacity was {{convert|363|MW}},&lt;ref name="Three"&gt;{{cite web|author=USAID |url=https://www.usaid.gov/powerafrica/malawi |title=Malawi: Power Africa Fact Sheet |access-date=18 April 2018 |date=28 March 2018 |publisher=[[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) |location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which 93.3 percent was hydroelectric.&lt;ref name="Four"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.indexmundi.com/malawi/energy_profile.html | title=Malawi Energy Profile 2018 |access-date=18 April 2018 | publisher=Indexmundi.com |author=Indexmundi |date=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a population of 19 million people in 2018,&lt;ref name="Five"&gt;{{cite web|title=Malawi Demographics Profile 2018 | url=https://www.indexmundi.com/malawi/demographics_profile.html
|access-date=18 April 2018 |date=20 January 2018 |last=Indexmundi |publisher=Indexmundi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the country's per capita consumption of electrical energy is still low, estimated at 93 kWh per year compared with an average of 432 kWh for [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] and 2167 kWh per year for the World average. There is urgency for Malawi to reach the critical threshold of 500 kWh per year.&lt;ref name="Two"/&gt;

The un-bundling of the former electricity monopoly Electric Supply Commission of Malawi (ESCOM), with the formation of the [[Electricity Generation Company Malawi Limited]] (Egenco), is a welcome development. With the [[government of Malawi]] continuing to reform the energy sector, strong investor interest has developed with Independent Power Producers (IPPs) willing to enter the Malawi energy market.&lt;ref name="Three"/&gt;

== Hydroelectricity ==
The majority of the country's hydroelectric power stations are situated in the [[Southern Region, Malawi|Southern Region]] of the country, specifically on the [[Shire River]]. Total grid-connected hydro-power is 351 megawatts. This is expected to increase to 369 megawatts, when the 18 megawatts [[Tedzani IV Hydroelectric Power Station]] is completed in 2020.&lt;ref name="Two"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Six"&gt;{{cite web|access-date=16 April 2018 |url=https://www.hydroworld.com/articles/2017/07/18-mw-being-added-to-tedzani-hydropower-complex-in-malawi-africa.html | title=18-MW being added to Tedzani hydropower complex in Malawi, Africa |author=Gregory B. Poindexter |publisher=Hyroworld.com |date=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With peak demand of 350 megawatts and growing at about 6 percent annually, the Malawian grid has very little flexibility.&lt;ref name="Seven"&gt;{{cite web|access-date=18 April 2018 | url=http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/malawi-power-station-2014-05-23/rep_id:4136 |title=Chinese bank looks to finance Malawi power station |location=Johannesburg |  
date=23 May 2014 |first=Marcel |last=Chimwala | publisher=Engineeringnews.co.za}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has exposed the country to severe, recurrent load-shedding. It has also stunted big industrial and manufacturing projects, especially in the areas of mining and processing, slowing national development and curtailing job creation.&lt;ref name="Eight"&gt;{{cite web|access-date=18 April 2018 | url=https://www.times.mw/phombeya-substation-ready-november-2017/ |title=Phombeya substation ready November 2017 | date=14 November 2016 |newspaper=[[The Daily Times (Malawi)]] |first=Feston | last=Malekezo |location=Blantyre}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hydro-potential of the Shire River is estimated at about 600 MW, and another 400 megawatts of potential exists on smaller rivers including [[Songwe River]], [[South Rukuru River]], [[Dwangwa River]] and ''Bua River''. Smaller off-grid untapped potential exists on smaller rivers scattered around the county.&lt;ref name="Two"/&gt;

==Thermal power==
Malawi has coal reserves estimated at 22 billion tons. Coal can also be imported from neighboring [[Mozambique]], via railroad. In 2014, Malawi decided to go ahead with plans to build [[Kammwamba Thermal Power Station]], a planned {{convert|1000|MW}}, [[coal-fired]] power station in [[Neno District]]. The plans call for starting with a 300 megawatts development, expandable in the future to 1,000 megawatts. The primary source of the coal to fire the power station, was identified as the [[Moatize]] coalfields in neighboring [[Mozambique]]. The imported coal would be hauled to the site via the nearby railway line.&lt;ref name="Nine"&gt;{{cite web|
author=World Coal |access-date=18 April 2018 |date=8 May 2014 | url=https://www.worldcoal.com/power/08052014/malawi_will_build_coal_fired_power_plant_819/ |title=Malawi will build 300 MW coal-fired power plant  |publisher=Worldcoal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government, through the ''Electricity Supply Commission of Malawi'', has established, on a temporary basis, several [[diesel fuel]] power stations in various locations around the country.&lt;ref name="Eleven"&gt;{{cite web|access-date=18 April 2018 | url=http://www.manaonline.gov.mw/index.php/business/item/7729-power-woes-to-end-in-2018-president-mutharika |date=31 January 2018 |title=Power woes to end in 2018 - President Mutharika |author=Tiwonge Mvula |publisher=[[Malawi News Agency| Malawi News Agency Online]] |location=Lilongwe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Oil and natural gas ==
As of April 2018, Malawi has no proven oil and/or gas reserves.&lt;ref name="Two"/&gt;

==Solar energy==
Several IPPs are in the process of setting up grid-ready [[photo-voltaic]] solar power plants, to be ready by December 2019. The sites under consideration include [[Salima (township)|Salima]], [[Lilongwe]], [[Dedza]] and [[Nkhotakota]]. A total of 40-70 megawatts is expected from these sites.&lt;ref name="Ten"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201804110146.html |title=Malawi: Power Situation Will Improve - Masi |

The '''European Energy Centre''' (EEC) was incorporated in 2010 in Scotland as a private limited company&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/SC371195 |title=Companies House websearch |accessdate=8 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;; it has no official links to the European Union.  Although its website makes a claim that it was created in 1975, this relates to the Centro Studi Galileo, an affiliated (but legally unconnected) company in Italy that runs a biennial conference on air-conditioning and refrigeration.  EEC's focus is on renewable energy training and conference delivery to help develop a workforce capable of installing, repairing and maintaining renewable energy equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euenergycentre.org/training |title=Renewable Energy Training |publisher=Euenergycentre.org |date= |accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The intense radiation of most observed GRBs is thought to be released during a [[supernova]] or [[superluminous supernova]] as a high-mass [[star]] collapses to form a [[neutron star]] or a [[black hole]].

A subclass of GRBs (the "short" bursts) appear to originate from a [[kilonova]] (the merger of [[binary star|binary]] [[neutron stars]]). The cause of the precursor burst observed in some of these short events may be the development of a resonance between the crust and core of such stars as a result of the massive tidal forces experienced in the seconds leading up to their collision, causing the entire crust of the star to shatter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Resonant Shattering of Neutron Star Crust |last1=Tsang |first1=David |last2=Read |first2=Jocelyn S. |last3=Hinderer |first3=Tanja |last4=Piro |first4=Anthony L. |last5=Bondarescu |first5=Ruxandra |date=2012 |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=108 |page=5 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.108.011102|arxiv = 1110.0467 |bibcode = 2012PhRvL.108a1102T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sources of most GRBs are billions of [[light year]]s away from [[Earth]], implying that the explosions are both extremely energetic (a typical burst releases as much energy in a few seconds as the [[Sun]] will in its entire 10-billion-year lifetime)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Massive star's dying blast caught by rapid-response telescopes |url=https://phys.org/news/2017-07-massive-star-dying-blast-caught.html |date=26 July 2017 |work=PhysOrg |accessdate=27 July 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and extremely rare (a few per galaxy per million years&lt;ref name="rates"&gt;[[#Podsiadlowski|Podsiadlowski 2004]]&lt;/ref&gt;). All observed GRBs have originated from outside the [[Milky Way galaxy]], although a related class of phenomena, [[soft gamma repeater]] flares, are associated with [[magnetar]]s within the Milky Way. It has been hypothesized that a gamma-ray burst in the Milky Way, pointing directly towards the Earth, could cause a [[mass extinction]] event.&lt;ref name="Melott2004"&gt;[[#Melott|Melott 2004]]&lt;/ref&gt;

GRBs were first detected in 1967 by the [[Vela (satellite)|Vela satellites]], which had been designed to detect [[Partial Test Ban Treaty|covert nuclear weapons tests]]; this was declassified and published in 1973.&lt;ref name="KSO"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Following their discovery, hundreds of theoretical models were proposed to explain these bursts, such as collisions between [[comet]]s and [[neutron star]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#HurleyBib|Hurley 2003]]&lt;/ref&gt; Little information was available to verify these models until the 1997 detection of the first X-ray and optical afterglows and direct measurement of their [[redshift]]s using optical [[spectroscopy]], and thus their distances and energy outputs. These discoveries, and subsequent studies of the galaxies and [[supernova]]e associated with the bursts, clarified the distance and luminosity of GRBs, definitively placing them in distant galaxies.

{{Main|History of gamma-ray burst research}}
[[File:BATSE 2704.jpg|thumb|Positions on the sky of all gamma-ray bursts detected during the BATSE mission. The distribution is [[isotropic]], with no concentration towards the plane of the Milky Way, which runs horizontally through the center of the image.]]
Gamma-ray bursts were first observed in the late 1960s by the U.S. [[Vela (satellite)|Vela]] satellites, which were built to detect gamma radiation pulses emitted by nuclear weapons tested in space. The [[United States]] suspected that the [[Soviet Union]] might attempt to conduct secret nuclear tests after signing the [[Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]] in 1963. On July 2, 1967, at 14:19 [[UTC]], the Vela 4 and Vela 3 satellites detected a flash of gamma radiation unlike any known nuclear weapons signature.&lt;ref name="FlashVela" /&gt; Uncertain what had happened but not considering the matter particularly urgent, the team at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], led by [[Ray Klebesadel]], filed the data away for investigation. As additional Vela satellites were launched with better instruments, the Los Alamos team continued to find inexplicable gamma-ray bursts in their data. By analyzing the different arrival times of the bursts as detected by different satellites, the team was able to determine rough estimates for the [[Star position|sky positions]] of sixteen bursts&lt;ref name="FlashVela"&gt;[[#Schilling|Schilling 2002]], p.12–16&lt;/ref&gt; and definitively rule out a terrestrial or solar origin. The discovery was declassified and published in 1973.&lt;ref name="KSO"&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1973ApJ...182L..85K |title=Observations of Gamma-Ray Bursts of Cosmic Origin |author1=Klebesadel R.W. |author2=Strong I.B. |author3=Olson R.A. |date=1973 |journal=Astrophysical Journal Letters |volume=182 |pages=L85 |doi=10.1086/181225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most early theories of gamma-ray bursts posited nearby sources within the [[Milky Way Galaxy]]. From 1991, the [[Compton Gamma Ray Observatory]] (CGRO) and its Burst and Transient Source Explorer ([[CGRO#Instruments|BATSE]]) instrument, an extremely sensitive gamma-ray detector, provided data that showed the distribution of GRBs is [[Isotropy|isotropic]]—not biased towards any particular direction in space.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Meegan|Meegan 1992]]&lt;/ref&gt; If the sources were from within our own galaxy they would be strongly concentrated in or near the galactic plane. The absence of any such pattern in the case of GRBs provided strong evidence that gamma-ray bursts must come from beyond the Milky Way.&lt;ref name="Vedrenne p. 16–40"&gt;[[#VedrenneAtteia|Vedrenne &amp; Atteia 2009]], p. 16–40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Schilling|Schilling 2002]], p.36–37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pac95|Paczyński 1999]], p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Piran92"&gt;[[#Piran92|Piran 1992]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, some Milky Way models are still consistent with an isotropic distribution.&lt;ref name="Vedrenne p. 16–40" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lamb"&gt;[[#Lamb|Lamb 1995]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018, astronomers reported that GRB 150101B, a gamma-ray burst event detected in 2015, may be directly related to the historic [[GW170817]], a [[gravitational wave]] event detected in 2017, and associated with the [[Neutron star merger|merger]] of two [[neutron star]]s. The similarities between the two events, in terms of [[gamma ray]], [[optical]] and [[x-ray]] emissions, as well as to the nature of the associated host [[Galaxy|galaxies]], are "striking", suggesting the two separate events may both be the result of the merger of neutron stars, and both may be a kilonova, which may be more common in the universe than previously understood, according to the researchers.&lt;ref name="EA-20181016"&gt;{{cite news |author=[[University of Maryland]] |title=All in the family: Kin of gravitational wave source discovered - New observations suggest that kilonovae -- immense cosmic explosions that produce silver, gold and platinum--may be more common than thought |url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-10/uom-ait101518.php |date=16 October 2018 |work=[[EurekAlert!]] |accessdate=17 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NC-20181016"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Troja, E. et al. |title=A luminous blue kilonova and an off-axis jet from a compact binary merger at z = 0.1341 |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06558-7 |date=16 October 2018 |journal=[[Nature Communications]] |volume=9 |number=4089 (2018) |doi=10.1038/s41467-018-06558-7 |accessdate=17 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-20181016"&gt;{{cite news |last=Mohon |first=Lee |title=GRB 150101B: A Distant Cousin to GW170817 |url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/chandra/images/grb-150101b-a-distant-cousin-to-gw170817.html |date=16 October 2018 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=17 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SPC-20181017"&gt;{{cite web |last=Wall |first=Mike |title=Powerful Cosmic Flash Is Likely Another Neutron-Star Merger |url=https://www.space.com/42158-another-neutron-star-crash-detected.html |date=17 October 2018 |work=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=17 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Counterpart objects as candidate sources ===
For decades after the discovery of GRBs, astronomers searched for a counterpart at other wavelengths: i.e., any astronomical object in positional coincidence with a recently observed burst. Astronomers considered many distinct classes of objects, including [[white dwarf]]s, [[pulsar]]s, [[supernova]]e, [[globular cluster]]s, [[quasar]]s, [[Seyfert galaxies]], and [[BL Lac object]]s.&lt;ref name="spatial"&gt;[[#HurleyConf|Hurley 1986]], p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; All such searches were unsuccessful,&lt;ref group="nb" name="790305b"&gt;A notable exception is the [[GRB 790305b|5 March event]] of 1979, an extremely bright burst that was successfully localized to supernova remnant [[LMC N49|N49]] in the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]]. This event is now interpreted as a [[magnetar]] [[Gamma-ray burst progenitors#Magnetar giant flares|giant flare]], more related to [[soft gamma repeater|SGR]] flares than "true" gamma-ray bursts.&lt;/ref&gt; and in a few cases particularly well-localized bursts (those whose positions were determined with what was then a high degree of accuracy) could be clearly shown to have no bright objects of any nature consistent with the position derived from the detecting satellites. This suggested an origin of either very faint stars or extremely distant galaxies.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pedersen|Pedersen 1987]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hurley92|Hurley 1992]]&lt;/ref&gt; Even the most accurate positions contained numerous faint stars and galaxies, and it was widely agreed that final resolution of the origins of cosmic gamma-ray bursts would require both new satellites and faster communication.&lt;ref name="CFishman" /&gt;

=== Afterglow ===
[[File:BeppoSAX.jpg|thumb|The Italian–Dutch satellite [[BeppoSAX]], launched in April 1996, provided the first accurate positions of gamma-ray bursts, allowing follow-up observations and identification of the sources.]]
Several models for the origin of gamma-ray bursts postulated that the initial burst of gamma rays should be followed by slowly fading emission at longer wavelengths created by collisions between the burst [[ejecta]] and interstellar gas.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pac93|Paczynski 1993]]&lt;/ref&gt; This fading emission would be called the "afterglow". Early searches for this afterglow were unsuccessful, largely because it is difficult to observe a burst's position at longer wavelengths immediately after the initial burst. The breakthrough came in February 1997 when the satellite [[BeppoSAX]] detected a gamma-ray burst ([[GRB 970228]]&lt;ref group="nb" name="grbnames"&gt;GRBs are named after the date on which they are discovered: the first two digits being the year, followed by the two-digit month and two-digit day and a letter with the order they were detected during that day. The letter 'A' is appended to the name for the first burst identified, 'B' for the second, and so on. For bursts before the year 2010 this letter was only appended if more than one burst occurred that day.&lt;/ref&gt;) and when the X-ray camera was pointed towards the direction from which the burst had originated, it detected fading X-ray emission. The [[William Herschel Telescope]] identified a fading optical counterpart 20 hours after the burst.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Paradijs|van Paradijs 1997]]&lt;/ref&gt; Once the GRB faded, deep imaging was able to identify a faint, distant host galaxy at the location of the GRB as pinpointed by the optical afterglow.&lt;ref name="Vedrenne p. 90"&gt;[[#VedrenneAtteia|Vedrenne &amp; Atteia 2009]], p. 90 – 93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Schilling|Schilling 2002]], p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the very faint luminosity of this galaxy, its exact distance was not measured for several years. Well before then, another major breakthrough occurred with the next event registered by BeppoSAX, [[GRB 970508]]. This event was localized within four hours of its discovery, allowing research teams to begin making observations much sooner than any previous burst. The [[absorption spectrum|spectrum]] of the object revealed a [[redshift]] of ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.835, placing the burst at a distance of roughly 6 billion&amp;nbsp;[[light year]]s from Earth.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reichart|Reichart 1995]]&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first accurate determination of the distance to a GRB, and together with the discovery of the host galaxy of 970228 proved that GRBs occur in extremely distant galaxies.&lt;ref name="Vedrenne p. 90" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Schilling|Schilling 2002]], p. 118–123&lt;/ref&gt; Within a few months, the controversy about the distance scale ended: GRBs were extragalactic events originating within faint galaxies at enormous distances. The following year, [[GRB 980425]] was followed within a day by a bright supernova ([[SN 1998bw]]), coincident in location, indicating a clear connection between GRBs and the deaths of very massive stars. This burst provided the first strong clue about the nature of the systems that produce GRBs.&lt;ref name="98bw"&gt;[[#Galama|Galama 1998]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Swift spacecraft.jpg|thumb|left|[[NASA]]'s [[Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission|Swift Spacecraft]] launched in November 2004]]
BeppoSAX functioned until 2002 and [[Compton Gamma Ray Observatory|CGRO]] (with BATSE) was deorbited in 2000. However, the revolution in the study of gamma-ray bursts motivated the development of a number of additional instruments designed specifically to explore the nature of GRBs, especially in the earliest moments following the explosion. The first such mission, [[High Energy Transient Explorer|HETE-2]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#HETE|Ricker 2003]]&lt;/ref&gt; launched in 2000 and functioned until 2006, providing most of the major discoveries during this period. One of the most successful space missions to date, [[Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission|Swift]], was launched in 2004 and as of 2016 is still operational.&lt;ref&gt;[[#NASA2008|McCray 2008]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gehrels04|Gehrels 2004]]&lt;/ref&gt; Swift is equipped with a very sensitive gamma ray detector as well as on-board X-ray and optical telescopes, which can be rapidly and automatically [[Slew (spacecraft)|slewed]] to observe afterglow emission following a burst. More recently, the [[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope|Fermi]] mission was launched carrying the [[Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor|Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor]], which detects bursts at a rate of several hundred per year, some of which are bright enough to be observed at extremely high energies with Fermi's [[Fermi LAT|Large Area Telescope]]. Meanwhile, on the ground, numerous optical telescopes have been built or modified to incorporate robotic control software that responds immediately to signals sent through the [[Gamma-ray Burst Coordinates Network]]. This allows the telescopes to rapidly repoint towards a GRB, often within seconds of receiving the signal and while the gamma-ray emission itself is still ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;[[#ROTSE|Akerlof 2003]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Akerlof99|Akerlof 1999]]&lt;/ref&gt;

New developments since the 2000s include the recognition of short gamma-ray bursts as a separate class (likely from merging neutron stars and not associated with supernovae), the discovery of extended, erratic flaring activity at X-ray wavelengths lasting for many minutes after most GRBs, and the discovery of the most luminous ([[GRB 080319B]]) and the former most distant ([[GRB 090423]]) objects in the universe.&lt;ref name="Bloom"&gt;[[#Bloom|Bloom 2009]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#090423|Reddy 2009]]&lt;/ref&gt; The most distant known GRB, [[GRB 090429B]], is now the most distant known object in the universe.

== Classification ==
[[File:GRB BATSE 12lightcurves.png|thumb|Gamma-ray burst light curves]]
The [[light curve]]s of gamma-ray bursts are extremely diverse and complex.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Katz|Katz 2002]], p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; No two gamma-ray burst light curves are identical,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Marani|Marani 1997]]&lt;/ref&gt; with large variation observed in almost every property: the duration of observable emission can vary from milliseconds to tens of minutes, there can be a single peak or several individual subpulses, and individual peaks can be symmetric or with fast brightening and very slow fading. Some bursts are preceded by a "precursor" event, a weak burst that is then followed (after seconds to minutes of no emission at all) by the much more intense "true" bursting episode.&lt;ref name="Lazzati"&gt;[[#Lazzati|Lazatti 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt; The light curves of some events have extremely chaotic and complicated profiles with almost no discernible patterns.&lt;ref name="CFishman"&gt;[[#CFishman|Fishman &amp; Meegan 1995]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although some light curves can be roughly reproduced using certain simplified models,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Simic|Simić 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt; little progress has been made in understanding the full diversity observed. Many classification schemes have been proposed, but these are often based solely on differences in the appearance of light curves and may not always reflect a true physical difference in the progenitors of the explosions. However, plots of the distribution of the observed duration&lt;ref group="nb" name="T90"&gt;The duration of a burst is typically measured by T90, the duration of the period which 90 percent of the burst's [[energy]] is emitted. Recently some otherwise "short" GRBs have been shown to be followed by a second, much longer emission episode that when included in the burst light curve results in T90 durations of up to several minutes: these events are only short in the literal sense when this component is excluded.&lt;/ref&gt; for a large number of gamma-ray bursts show a clear [[bimodal distribution|bimodality]], suggesting the existence of two separate populations: a "short" population with an average duration of about 0.3 seconds and a "long" population with an average duration of about 30 seconds.&lt;ref name="Kouveliotou"&gt;[[#Kouveliotou|Kouveliotou 1994]]&lt;/ref&gt; Both distributions are very broad with a significant overlap region in which the identity of a given event is not clear from duration alone. Additional classes beyond this two-tiered system have been proposed on both observational and theoretical grounds.&lt;ref name="Horvath98"&gt;[[#Horvath98|Horvath 1998]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hakkila"&gt;[[#Hakkila|Hakkila 2003]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chattopadhyay"&gt;[[#Chattopadhyay|Chattopadhyay 2007]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Virgili"&gt;[[#Virgili|Virgili 2009]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Short gamma-ray bursts ===
[[File:Hubble captures infrared glow of a kilonova blast.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hubble Space Telescope]] captures infrared glow of a [[kilonova]] blast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hubble captures infrared glow of a kilonova blast|url=http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/opo1329a/|work=Image Gallery|publisher=ESA/Hubble|accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

Events with a duration of less than about two seconds are classified as short gamma-ray bursts. These account for about 30% of gamma-ray bursts, but until 2005, no afterglow had been successfully detected from any short event and little was known about their origins.&lt;ref name=r1&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/swift/bursts/short_burst_oct5.html In a Flash NASA Helps Solve 35-year-old Cosmic Mystery]. NASA (2005-10-05) The 30% figure is given here, as well as afterglow discussion.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, several dozen short gamma-ray burst afterglows have been detected and localized, several of which are associated with regions of little or no star formation, such as large [[elliptical galaxy|elliptical galaxies]] and the central regions of large [[galaxy cluster]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bloom06|Bloom 2006]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hjorth|Hjorth 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Berger07|Berger 2007]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gehrels05|Gehrels 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt; This rules out a link to massive stars, confirming that short events are physically distinct from long events. In addition, there has been no association with supernovae.&lt;ref name="Zhang"&gt;[[#Zhang09|Zhang 2009]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The true nature of these objects was initially unknown, and the leading hypothesis was that they originated from the mergers of binary neutron stars&lt;ref name="Nakar 2007"&gt;[[#Nakar07|Nakar 2007]]&lt;/ref&gt; or a neutron star with a [[black hole]].

The observation of minutes to hours of X-ray flashes after a short gamma-ray burst is consistent with small particles of a primary object like a neutron star initially swallowed by a black hole in less than two seconds, followed by some hours of lesser energy events, as remaining fragments of tidally disrupted neutron star material (no longer [[neutronium]]) remain in orbit to spiral into the black hole, over a longer period of time.&lt;ref name=r1 /&gt; A small fraction of short gamma-ray bursts are probably produced by giant flares from [[soft gamma repeaters]] in nearby galaxies.&lt;ref name="Frederiks"&gt;[[#Frederiks|Frederiks 2008]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hurley05|Hurley 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Long gamma-ray bursts ===
Most observed events (70%) have a duration of greater than two seconds and are classified as long gamma-ray bursts. Because these events constitute the majority of the population and because they tend to have the brightest afterglows, they have been observed in much greater detail than their short counterparts. Almost every well-studied long gamma-ray burst has been linked to a galaxy with rapid star formation, and in many cases to a [[core-collapse supernova]] as well, unambiguously associating long GRBs with the deaths of massive stars.&lt;ref name="Woosley06"&gt;[[#Woosley06|Woosley &amp; Bloom 2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; Long GRB afterglow observations, at high redshift, are also consistent with the GRB having originated in star-forming regions.&lt;ref name="Pontzen"&gt;[[#Pontzen|Pontzen et al. 2010]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ultra-long gamma-ray bursts ===
These events are at the tail end of the long GRB duration distribution, lasting more than 10,000 seconds. They have been proposed to form a separate class, caused by the collapse of a [[blue supergiant star]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=2013ApJ...766...30G |doi=10.1088/0004-637X/766/1/30 |title=The Ultra-Long Gamma-Ray Burst 111209A: The Collapse of a Blue Supergiant? |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=766 |issue=1 |page=30 |date=2013 |last1=Gendre |first1=B. |last2=Stratta |first2=G. |last3=Atteia |first3=J.

== Energetics and beaming ==
[[File:GRB080319B illustration NASA.jpg|thumb|Artist's illustration of a bright gamma-ray burst occurring in a star-forming region. Energy from the explosion is beamed into two narrow, oppositely directed jets.]]
Gamma-ray bursts are very bright as observed from Earth despite their typically immense distances. An average long GRB has a [[bolometric magnitude|bolometric]] flux comparable to a bright star of our galaxy despite a distance of billions of light years (compared to a few tens of light years for most visible stars). Most of this energy is released in gamma rays, although some GRBs have extremely luminous optical counterparts as well. [[GRB 080319B]], for example, was accompanied by an optical counterpart that peaked at a [[visible magnitude]] of 5.8,&lt;ref name="Racusin"&gt;[[#Racusin08|Racusin 2008]]&lt;/ref&gt; comparable to that of the dimmest naked-eye stars despite the burst's distance of 7.5 billion light years. This combination of brightness and distance implies an extremely energetic source. Assuming the gamma-ray explosion to be spherical, the energy output of GRB 080319B would be within a factor of two of the [[Mass–energy equivalence|rest-mass energy]] of the [[Sun]] (the energy which would be released were the Sun to be converted entirely into radiation).&lt;ref name="Bloom" /&gt;

Gamma-ray bursts are thought to be highly focused explosions, with most of the explosion energy [[collimated light|collimated]] into a narrow [[relativistic jet|jet]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rykoff|Rykoff 2009]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Abdo|Abdo 2009]]&lt;/ref&gt; The approximate angular width of the jet (that is, the degree of spread of the beam) can be estimated directly by observing the achromatic "jet breaks" in afterglow light curves: a time after which the slowly decaying afterglow begins to fade rapidly as the jet slows and can no longer [[relativistic beaming|beam]] its radiation as effectively.&lt;ref name="Sari99"&gt;[[#Sari99|Sari 1999]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Burrows|Burrows 2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; Observations suggest significant variation in the jet angle from between 2 and 20 degrees.&lt;ref name="Frail"&gt;[[#Frail|Frail 2001]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because their energy is strongly focused, the gamma rays emitted by most bursts are expected to miss the Earth and never be detected. When a gamma-ray burst is pointed towards Earth, the focusing of its energy along a relatively narrow beam causes the burst to appear much brighter than it would have been were its energy emitted spherically. When this effect is taken into account, typical gamma-ray bursts are observed to have a true energy release of about 10&lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;J, or about 1/2000 of a [[Solar mass]] ({{Solar mass|link=y}}) energy equivalent&lt;ref name="Frail" /&gt;—which is still many times the mass-energy equivalent of the Earth (about 5.5&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;41&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;J). This is comparable to the energy released in a bright [[Type Ib supernova|type Ib/c]] [[supernova]] and within the range of theoretical models. Very bright supernovae have been observed to accompany several of the nearest GRBs.&lt;ref name="98bw" /&gt; Additional support for focusing of the output of GRBs has come from observations of strong asymmetries in the spectra of nearby [[Type Ib and Ic supernovae|type Ic supernova]]&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mazzali|Mazzali 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt; and from radio observations taken long after bursts when their jets are no longer relativistic.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Frail2000|Frail 2000]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Short (time duration) GRBs appear to come from a lower-redshift (i.e. less distant) population and are less luminous than long GRBs.&lt;ref name="SHBhosts"&gt;[[#Prochaska|Prochaska 2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; The degree of beaming in short bursts has not been accurately measured, but as a population they are likely less collimated than long GRBs&lt;ref&gt;[[#Watson|Watson 2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; or possibly not collimated at all in some cases.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Grupe|Grupe 2006]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Progenitors ==
{{Main|Gamma-ray burst progenitors}}
[[File:Wolf rayet2.jpg|thumb|Hubble Space Telescope image of [[Wolf–Rayet star]] [[WR 124]] and its surrounding nebula. Wolf–Rayet stars are candidates for being progenitors of long-duration GRBs.]]
Because of the immense distances of most gamma-ray burst sources from Earth, identification of the progenitors, the systems that produce these explosions, is challenging. The association of some long GRBs with supernovae and the fact that their host galaxies are rapidly star-forming offer very strong evidence that long gamma-ray bursts are associated with massive stars. The most widely accepted mechanism for the origin of long-duration GRBs is the [[Hypernova|collapsar]] model,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mac99|MacFadyen 1999]]&lt;/ref&gt; in which the core of an extremely massive, low-[[metallicity]], rapidly rotating star collapses into a [[black hole]] in the final stages of its [[stellar evolution|evolution]]. Matter near the star's core rains down towards the center and swirls into a high-density [[accretion disk]]. The infall of this material into a black hole drives a pair of [[relativistic jet]]s out along the rotational axis, which pummel through the stellar envelope and eventually break through the stellar surface and radiate as gamma rays. Some alternative models replace the black hole with a newly formed [[magnetar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Zhang |first=Bing |last2=Mészáros |first2=Peter |date=2001-05-01 |title=Gamma-Ray Burst Afterglow with Continuous Energy Injection: Signature of a Highly Magnetized Millisecond Pulsar |bibcode=2001ApJ...552L..35Z |journal=The Astrophysical Journal Letters |volume=552 |issue=1 |pages=L35–L38 |doi=10.1086/320255 |arxiv = astro-ph/0011133 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Troja |first=E. |last2=Cusumano |first2=G. |last3=O'Brien |first3=P.

The closest analogs within the Milky Way galaxy of the stars producing long gamma-ray bursts are likely the [[Wolf–Rayet star]]s, extremely hot and massive stars, which have shed most or all of their hydrogen to [[radiation pressure]]. [[Eta Carinae]] and [[WR 104]] have been cited as possible future gamma-ray burst progenitors.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Plait|Plait 2008]]&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear if any star in the Milky Way has the appropriate characteristics to produce a gamma-ray burst.&lt;ref name="Stanek"&gt;[[#Stanek|Stanek 2006]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The massive-star model probably does not explain all types of gamma-ray burst. There is strong evidence that some short-duration gamma-ray bursts occur in systems with no star formation and no massive stars, such as elliptical galaxies and [[galaxy halo]]s.&lt;ref name="SHBhosts" /&gt; The favored theory for the origin of most short gamma-ray bursts is the merger of a binary system consisting of two neutron stars. According to this model, the two stars in a binary slowly spiral towards each other because [[gravitational radiation]] releases energy&lt;ref&gt;[[#Abbott|Abbott 2007]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kochanek|Kochanek 1993]]&lt;/ref&gt; until [[tidal forces]] suddenly rip the neutron stars apart and they collapse into a single black hole. The infall of matter into the new black hole produces an accretion disk and releases a burst of energy, analogous to the collapsar model. Numerous other models have also been proposed to explain short gamma-ray bursts, including the merger of a neutron star and a black hole, the accretion-induced collapse of a neutron star, or the [[black hole evaporation|evaporation]] of [[primordial black hole]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Vietri|Vietri 1998]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mac2006|MacFadyen 2006]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Blinnikov|Blinnikov 1984]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cline"&gt;[[#Cline|Cline 1996]]&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative explanation proposed by [[Friedwardt Winterberg]] is that in the course of a gravitational collapse and in reaching the event horizon of a black hole, all matter disintegrates into a burst of gamma radiation.&lt;ref&gt;Winterberg, Friedwardt (2001 Aug 29). "Gamma-Ray Bursters and Lorentzian Relativity". Z. Naturforsch 56a: 889–892.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tidal disruption events ===
{{Main|Tidal disruption event}}
This new class of GRB-like events was first discovered through the detection of [[GRB 110328A]] by the [[Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission]] on 28 March 2011. This event had a gamma-ray duration of about 2 days, much longer than even ultra-long GRBs, and was detected in X-rays for many months. It occurred at the center of a small elliptical galaxy at redshift z = 0.3534. There is an ongoing debate as to whether the explosion was the result of stellar collapse or a tidal disruption event accompanied by a relativistic jet, although the latter explanation has become widely favoured.

A tidal disruption event of this sort is when a star interacts with a [[supermassive black hole]] shredding the star, and in some cases creating a relativistic jet which produces bright emission of gamma ray radiation. The event GRB 110328A (also denoted Swift J1644+57) was initially argued to be produced by the disruption of a main sequence star by a black hole of several million times the mass of the Sun,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Daily|Science Daily 2011]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Levan11"&gt;[[#Levan11|Levan 2011]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloom11"&gt;[[#Bloom11|Bloom 2011]]&lt;/ref&gt; although it has subsequently been argued that the disruption of a [[white dwarf]] by a black hole of mass about 10 thousand times the Sun may be more likely.&lt;ref&gt;[[#KrolikPiran|Krolick &amp; Piran 11]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emission mechanisms ==
{{Main|Gamma-ray burst emission mechanisms}}
The means by which gamma-ray bursts convert energy into radiation remains poorly understood, and as of 2010 there was still no generally accepted model for how this process occurs.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Stern|Stern 2007]]&lt;/ref&gt; Any successful model of GRB emission must explain the physical process for generating gamma-ray emission that matches the observed diversity of light curves, spectra, and other characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;[[#GFishman|Fishman, G. 1995]]&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly challenging is the need to explain the very high efficiencies that are inferred from some explosions: some gamma-ray bursts may convert as much as half (or more) of the explosion energy into gamma-rays.&lt;ref&gt;[[#FanPiran|Fan &amp; Piran 2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; Early observations of the bright optical counterparts to [[GRB 990123]] and to [[GRB 080319B]], whose optical light curves were extrapolations of the gamma-ray light spectra,&lt;ref name="Racusin" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Liang|Liang et al. 1999, GRB 990123: The Case for Saturated Comptonization, The Astrophysical Journal, 519:L21-L24, 1999 July 1. http://iopscience.iop.org/1538-4357/519/1/L21/fulltext/995164.text.html]]&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that [[Compton scattering|inverse Compton]] may be the dominant process in some events. In this model, pre-existing low-energy [[photons]] are scattered by relativistic electrons within the explosion, augmenting their energy by a large factor and transforming them into gamma-rays.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wozniak09|Wozniak 2009]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The nature of the longer-wavelength afterglow emission (ranging from [[X-ray]] through [[radio waves|radio]]) that follows gamma-ray bursts is better understood. Any energy released by the explosion not radiated away in the burst itself takes the form of matter or energy moving outward at nearly the speed of light. As this matter collides with the surrounding [[interstellar gas]], it creates a [[relativistic speed|relativistic]] [[shock wave]] that then propagates forward into interstellar space. A second shock wave, the reverse shock, may propagate back into the ejected matter. Extremely energetic electrons within the shock wave are accelerated by strong local magnetic fields and radiate as [[synchrotron]] emission across most of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Meszaros|Meszaros 1997]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sari98|Sari 1998]]&lt;/ref&gt; This model has generally been successful in modeling the behavior of many observed afterglows at late times (generally, hours to days after the explosion), although there are difficulties explaining all features of the afterglow very shortly after the gamma-ray burst has occurred.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nousek|Nousek 2006]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rate of occurrence and potential effects on life ==
[[File:GROND image of the gamma-ray burst GRB 151027B.jpg|thumb|On 27 October 2015, at 22:40 GMT, the NASA/ASI/UKSA Swift satellite discovered its 1000th gamma-ray burst (GRB).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ESO Telescopes Observe Swift Satellite’s 1000th Gamma-ray Burst|url=http://www.eso.org/public/announcements/ann15085/|accessdate=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Gamma ray bursts can have harmful or destructive effects on life. Considering the universe as a whole, the safest environments for life similar to that on Earth are the lowest density regions in the outskirts of large galaxies. Our knowledge of [[galaxy]] types and their distribution suggests that life as we know it can only exist in about 10% of all galaxies. Furthermore, galaxies with a redshift, ''z'', higher than 0.5 are unsuitable for life as we know it, because of their higher rate of GRBs and their stellar compactness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Piran |first1=Tsvi |last2=Jimenez |first2=Raul |title=Possible Role of Gamma Ray Bursts on Life Extinction in the Universe |journal=Physical Review Letters |date=5 December 2014 |volume=113 |issue=23 |pages=231102 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.113.231102|pmid=25526110 |arxiv=1409.2506 |bibcode=2014PhRvL.113w1102P }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schirber |first=Michael |title=Focus: Gamma-Ray Bursts Determine Potential Locations for Life |url=https://physics.aps.org/articles/v7/124 |journal=Physics |volume=7 |page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All GRBs observed to date have occurred well outside the Milky Way galaxy and have been harmless to Earth. However, if a GRB were to occur within the Milky Way and its emission were beamed straight towards Earth, the effects could be harmful and potentially devastating for the [[ecosystem]]s. Currently, orbiting satellites detect on average approximately one GRB per day.

Estimating the exact rate at which GRBs occur is difficult; for a galaxy of approximately the same size as the [[Milky Way]], estimates of the expected rate (for long-duration GRBs) can range from one burst every 10,000 years, to one burst every 1,000,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-21082617|title=Gamma-ray burst 'hit Earth in 8th Century'|publisher=BBC|work=Rebecca Morelle|date=2013-01-21|accessdate=January 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only a small percentage of these would be beamed towards Earth. Estimates of rate of occurrence of short-duration GRBs are even more uncertain because of the unknown degree of collimation, but are probably comparable.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Guetta|Guetta and Piran 2006]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since GRBs are thought to involve beamed emission along two jets in opposing directions, only planets in the path of these jets would be subjected to the high energy gamma radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/44823014/ns/technology_and_science-science/#.Tqoe10K5PvI | title=Can gamma-ray bursts destroy life on Earth? | publisher=MSN | author=Welsh, Jennifer | date=2011-07-10 | accessdate=October 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although nearby GRBs hitting Earth with a destructive shower of gamma rays are only hypothetical events, high energy processes across the galaxy have been observed to affect the Earth's atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;[https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/1998/ast29sep98_2/ "Earth does not exist in splendid isolation" - Energy burst from an X-ray star disturbed Earth's environment]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effects on Earth ===
Earth's atmosphere is very effective at absorbing high energy electromagnetic radiation such as x-rays and gamma rays, so these types of radiation would not reach any dangerous levels at the surface during the burst event itself. The immediate effect on life on Earth from a GRB within a few [[parsec]]s would only be a short increase in ultraviolet radiation at ground level, lasting from less than a second to tens of seconds. This ultraviolet radiation could potentially reach dangerous levels depending on the exact nature and distance of the burst, but it seems unlikely to be able to cause a global catastrophe for life on Earth.&lt;ref name=Threat&gt;[https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/0903/0903.4710.pdf Gamma-Ray Bursts as a Threat to Life on Earth]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Effects"&gt;[https://arxiv.org/pdf/0911.2196.pdf Effects of Gamma Ray Bursts in Earth's Biosphere] {{doi|10.1007/s10509-009-0211-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The long-term effects from a nearby burst are more dangerous. Gamma rays cause chemical reactions in the atmosphere involving [[oxygen]] and [[nitrogen]] [[molecules]], creating first [[nitrogen oxide]] then [[nitrogen dioxide]] gas. The nitrogen oxides cause dangerous effects on three levels. First, they deplete [[ozone layer|ozone]], with models showing a possible global reduction of 25–35%, with as much as 75% in certain locations, an effect that would last for years. This reduction is enough to cause a dangerously elevated [[UV index]] at the surface. Secondly, the nitrogen oxides cause [[photochemical smog]], which darkens the sky and blocks out parts of the [[sunlight]] spectrum. This would affect [[photosynthesis]], but models show only about a 1% reduction of the total sunlight spectrum, lasting a few years. However, the smog could potentially cause a cooling effect on Earth's climate, producing a "cosmic winter" (similar to an [[impact winter]], but without an impact), but only if it occurs simultaneously with a global climate instability. Thirdly, the elevated nitrogen levels in the atmosphere would wash out and produce [[Acid rain|nitric acid rain]]. [[Nitric acid]] is toxic to a variety of organisms, including amphibian life, but models predict that it would not reach levels that would cause a serious global effect. The [[nitrates]] might in fact be of benefit to some plants.&lt;ref name=Threat/&gt;&lt;ref name="Effects"/&gt;

All in all, a GRB within a few parsecs, with its energy directed towards Earth, will mostly damage life by raising the UV levels during the burst itself and for a few years thereafter. Models show that the destructive effects of this increase can cause up to 16 times the normal levels of DNA damage. It has proved difficult to assess a reliable evaluation of the consequences of this on the terrestrial ecosystem, because of the uncertainty in biological field and laboratory data.&lt;ref name=Threat/&gt;&lt;ref name="Effects"/&gt;

==== Hypothetical effects on Earth in the past ====
GRBs close enough to affect life in some way might occur once every five million years or so — around a thousand times since [[Earliest known life forms|life on Earth began]].&lt;ref&gt;John Scalo, Craig Wheeler in New Scientist print edition, 15 December 2001, p 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The major [[Ordovician–Silurian extinction events]] 450 million years ago may have been caused by a GRB. The [[late Ordovician]] species of [[trilobite]]s that spent portions of their lives in the [[plankton]] layer near the ocean surface were much harder hit than deep-water dwellers, which tended to remain within quite restricted areas. This is in contrast to the usual pattern of extinction events, wherein species with more widely spread populations typically fare better. A possible explanation is that trilobites remaining in deep water would be more shielded from the increased UV radiation associated with a GRB. Also supportive of this hypothesis is the fact that during the late Ordovician, burrowing [[bivalve]] species were less likely to go extinct than bivalves that lived on the surface.&lt;ref name="Melott2004" /&gt;

A case has been made that the [[774–775 carbon-14 spike]] was the result of a short GRB,&lt;ref name="pavlov"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Pavlov | first1=A.K. | last2=Blinov | first2=A.V. | last3=Konstantinov | first3=A.N. | display-authors=etal | title=AD 775 pulse of cosmogenic radionuclides production as imprint of a Galactic gamma-ray burst | journal=Mon.

==== WR 104: A nearby GRB candidate ====
{{Main|WR 104}}
A [[Wolf–Rayet star]] in WR 104, about {{convert|8000|ly|parsec|sp=us}} away, is considered a nearby GRB candidate that could have destructive effects on terrestrial life. It is expected to explode in a core-collapse-supernova at some point within the next 500,000 years and it is possible that this explosion will create a GRB. If that happens, there is a small chance that Earth will be in the path of its gamma ray jet.&lt;ref name=tuthill_subject_expert&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tuthill|first1=Peter|title=WR 104: The prototype Pinwheel Nebula|url=http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/~gekko/pinwheel.html|accessdate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=time_super_duper&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kluger|first1=Jeffrey|title=The Super-Duper, Planet-Frying, Exploding Star That’s Not Going to Hurt Us, So Please Stop Worrying About It|url=http://science.time.com/2012/12/21/the-super-duper-planet-frying-exploding-star-thats-not-going-to-hurt-us-so-please-stop-worrying-about-it/|accessdate=20 December 2015|publisher=[[Time Magazine]]|date=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tuthill_subject_expert_faq&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tuthill|first1=Peter|title=WR 104: Technical Questions|url=http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/~gekko/pinwheel/tech_faq.html|accessdate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== GRB candidates in the Milky Way ==
No gamma-ray burst from within our own galaxy, the [[Milky Way Galaxy|Milky Way]], has been observed, and the question of whether one has ever occurred remains unresolved. In light of evolving understanding of gamma-ray bursts and their progenitors, the scientific literature records a growing number of local, past, and future GRB candidates. Long duration GRBs are related to superluminous supernovae, or hypernovae, and most [[luminous blue variable]]s (LBVs), and rapidly spinning [[Wolf–Rayet star]]s are thought to end their life cycles in core-collapse supernovae with an associated long-duration GRB. Knowledge of GRBs, however, is from metal-poor galaxies of [[history of the universe|former epochs of the universe's evolution]], and it is impossible to directly extrapolate to encompass more evolved galaxies and stellar environments with a higher [[metallicity]], such as the Milky Way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid =  23630373 | doi=10.1098/rsta.2012.0237 | volume=371 | issue=1992 | title=Gamma-ray burst progenitors and the population of rotating Wolf-Rayet stars | journal=Philos Trans Royal Soc A | pages=20120237 | author=Vink JS|bibcode = 2013RSPTA.37120237V | year=2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=M.

[[File:GreenWave.gif|thumb|right]]
A '''green wave''' occurs when a series of [[traffic light]]s (usually three or more) are coordinated to allow continuous traffic flow over several [[Intersection (road)|intersections]] in one main direction.

Any vehicle travelling along with the green wave (at an approximate speed decided upon by the [[Traffic engineering (transportation)|traffic engineers]]) will see a progressive cascade of green lights, and not have to stop at intersections. This allows higher traffic loads, and reduces noise and energy use (because less acceleration and braking is needed). In practical use, only a group of cars (known as a "platoon", the size of which is defined by the [[Signal timing|signal times]]) can use the ''green wave'' before the time band is interrupted to give way to other traffic flows.

The coordination of the signals is sometimes done dynamically, according to sensor data of currently existing traffic flows - otherwise it is done statically, by the use of timers. Under certain circumstances, ''green waves'' can be interwoven with each other, but this increases their complexity and reduces usability, so in conventional set-ups only the roads and directions with the heaviest loads get this preferential treatment.

In 2011, a study modeled the implementation of green waves during the night in a busy Manchester suburb ([[Chorlton-cum-Hardy]]) using S-Paramics microsimulation and the AIRE emissions module.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gse.cat.org.uk/papers?download=6%3Ablaise-kelly-a-green-wave-reprieve |title=("A Green Wave Reprieve" Blaise Kelly) |date= |accessdate=2014-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Traffic Engineering &amp; Control, Volume: 53, Issue Number: 2, Hemming Group, Limited, {{ISSN|0041-0683}}, http://trid.trb.org/view.aspx?id=1136945&lt;/ref&gt; The results showed using green wave signal setups on a network have the potential to:

Attempted "green wave": 8.5mph on Market; 50 vara district: 10.5 mph north-south, 14.5 mph east-west; 100 vara district: 14.5mph north-south, 20.5mph east-west.]]

* Reduce [[CO2|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[NOx|NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[PM10|PM&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;]] emissions from traffic.
* Reduce fuel consumption of vehicles.
* Be used on roads that intersect with other green waves.
* Reduce the time cars wait at side roads.
* Give pedestrians more time to cross at crossings and help them to cross streets as vehicles travel in platoons &lt;ref&gt;Gartner, N.H. &amp; Stamatiadis, C. (2002) Arterial-based control of traffic flow in urban grid networks. Mathematical and computer modelling, 35 (5-6), pp.657–671.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Control the speed of traffic in urban areas.
* Reduce component wear of vehicles and indirect energy consumption through their manufacture &lt;ref&gt;Pakyardim, Y.K. (2009) Calculation of Embodied Energy of Gearbox of an ordinary car. China, Zhengzhou University.&lt;/ref&gt;

A green wave in both directions may be possible with different speed recommendations for each direction, otherwise traffic coming from one direction may reach the traffic light faster than from the other direction if the distance from the previous traffic light is not mathematically a multiple of the opposite direction. Alternatively a dual carriageway may be suitable for green waves in both directions if there is sufficient space in the [[median strip|central reservation]] to allow pedestrians to wait and separate pedestrian crossing stages for each side of the road.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gse.cat.org.uk/papers?download=6%3Ablaise-kelly-a-green-wave-reprieve ("A Greenwave Reprieve" Blaise Kelly)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Traffic Engineering &amp; Control, Volume: 53, Issue Number: 2, Hemming Group, Limited, {{ISSN|0041-0683}}, [http://trid.trb.org/view.aspx?id=1136945]&lt;/ref&gt;

Green waves are sometimes used to facilitate [[bicycle traffic]]. [[Copenhagen]],&lt;ref&gt;"30.000 cyclists get green traffic light wave" Copenhagen Capacity, accessed Jan 28,2008 {{cite web |url=http://www.copcap.com/composite-9862.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807155446/http://www.copcap.com/composite-9862.htm |archivedate=2008-08-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amsterdam]],&lt;ref&gt;"Green wave for cyclists tested" News from Amsterdam, http://www.nieuwsuitamsterdam.nl/English/2007/11/green_wave.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[San Francisco]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sterbentz |first=Janel |url=http://sf.streetsblog.org/2009/03/02/valencia-signals-re-timed-to-improve-traffic-flow-and-safety/ |title=Valencia Signals Re-timed to Improve Traffic Flow and Safety &amp;#124; Streetsblog San Francisco |publisher=Sf.streetsblog.org |date=2009-03-02 |accessdate=2014-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other cities may synchronize traffic signals to provide a green light for a flow of cyclists. On San Francisco's Valencia Street, the signals were retimed in early 2009 to provide a green wave in both directions, possibly the first street in the world with a two-way green wave for cyclists. In Copenhagen, a green wave on the arterial street Nørrebrogade facilitates 30,000 cyclists to maintain a 12&amp;nbsp;mph (19.3&amp;nbsp;km/h) speed for 2.5 kilometers. In Amsterdam, cyclists riding at a speed of 15 to 18&amp;nbsp;km/h will be able to travel without being stopped by a red signal. Tests show that public transport can benefit as well and cars may travel slightly slower.

In Vienna, Austria a stretch of cycle path on Lassellestrasse in the 2nd district has a display that tells cyclists their speed and the speed they must maintain to make the next green light.

[[Frederiksberg]], a part of Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark, has implemented a green wave for emergency vehicles to improve the public services.

In the UK, in 2009, it was revealed that the [[Department for Transport]] had previously discouraged green waves as they reduced fuel usage, and thus less revenue was raised from fuel taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7998182.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; Drivers catch green lights 'wave' |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-04-14 |accessdate=2014-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DfT (2004) WebTag Unit 3.5.3 - Transport User Benefit Calculation&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this government Webtag documents were only updated in 2011. It is still unclear if the economic appraisal software used to apply these guidelines has also been updated and if the new guidelines are being applied to new projects.

In a more limited sense, the term Green wave has also been applied to railroad travel. For several years starting in the 1960s, the [[German Federal Railway]] maintained an [[advertising campaign]] featuring the slogan ''garantiert grüne Welle'' (Guaranteed Green Wave), which communicated the notion of speed, limited delays and open track [[Signalling block system|blocks]] to potential customers choosing between train and automobile travel, and was featured prominently in promotional materials ranging from posters to radio jingles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8836">'''Joel Walker Hedgpeth''' (September 29, 1911 &amp;ndash; July 28, 2006) was a [[marine biologist]], [[environmentalist]] and [[author]]. He was an expert on the marine arthropods known as [[sea spiders]] (Pycnogonida), and on the seashore plant and animal life of southern California. He was a spokesperson for care for the floral and faunal diversity of the California coastline.

==Early life==
Hedgpeth was born on September 29, 1911 in [[Oakland, California]].&lt;ref name=obit&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/12/science/12hedgpeth.html?ex=1313035200&amp;en=d8ae82c493a23e14&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss Joel Hedgpeth, Marine Biologist and Advocate of Sea Life, Dies at 94], ''[[New York Times]]'', August 12, 2006, p. B16. Obituary by Jeremy Pearce.&lt;/ref&gt; He married Florence Warrens in 1944, and the couple would have two children.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; He obtained his PhD (on the distribution and ecology of invertebrates along the Texas and Louisiana coasts)  from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1952. While at Berkeley, he studied under two of the most important marine biologists of the era, S.F. Light and Ralph I. Smith.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;ref name = Smith/&gt;

==Career==
Hedgpeth met and corresponded with [[Edward F. Ricketts]] (1897–1948), a charismatic researcher of West Coast marine biology and the real-life model for the character "Doc" in John Steinbeck's novel, Cannery Row. Hedgpeth himself may have been the model for the character, "Old Jay" in Steinbeck's novel, Sweet Thursday [Schram and Newman 2007]. Hedgpeth later was the editor of several editions of Ricketts' "Between Pacific Tides," a classic in marine biology, describing marine life along the coasts of California, Oregon and Washington. Hedgpeth edited more of Ricketts' writings in two volumes of "The Outer Shores."

His publications included the massive Volume 1 of the "Treatise on Maine Ecology &amp; Paleoecology" (1957); and ''Introduction to Seashore Life of the San Francisco Bay Region'' (1962).&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;Smith, Randall W. 2007. Beyond Pacific Tides: The Inner Shores. Remembering Joel Walker Hedgpeth (1911–2006). The Quarterly Review of Biology 82(2):93-96.&lt;/ref&gt; His teaching posts included the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] at [[University of California, San Diego]].  He was also director of the [[Pacific Marine Station]], a [[University of the Pacific (United States)|University of the Pacific]] research facility at [[Dillon Beach, California|Dillon Beach]], [[California]], from 1957 to 1965. He was director of the Yaquina Biological Laboratories of the [[Hatfield Marine Science Center|Marine Science Center]], [[Oregon State University]], [[Newport, Oregon]], from 1965 to 1973.  He retired as Professor of Oceanography in September, 1973.  He and his wife moved to Santa Rosa, California during retirement.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; He died July 28, 2006 in [[Hillsboro, Oregon]]. His archives are housed at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, California.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

The [[nudibranch]] ''Polycera hedgpethi''[http://slugsite.us/bow/nudwk459.htm] was named in his honor by [[Ernst Marcus]], a marine biologist who taught at the [[University of São Paulo]] in [[Brazil]].

Hedgpeth was an iconoclast and an early environmentalist. He spoke Latin, German, Welsh, and Russian. He founded the "Society for the Prevention of Progress" and was its sole member, under a pseudonym, Jerome Tichenor (Schram and Newman 2007). Under the same pseudonym, he published "Poems in Contempt of Progress" and vocally opposed a nuclear power plant once proposed at Bodega Head, California (Carlton 2006). He was influential in the developing West Coast environmental movement in the 1970s. His influence was instrumental in getting the California freshwater shrimp, ''[[Syncaris pacifica]]'', listed as an endangered species (Schram and Newman 2007).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2073">The '''Knudsen Paradox''' has been observed in experiments of channel flow with varying channel width or equivalently different pressures.&lt;ref name="Knudsen1909"&gt;[[Martin Knudsen]], [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229813701_Die_Gesetze_der_Molekularstromung_und_der_inneren_Reibungsstromung_der_Gase_durch_Rohrn "Die Gesetze der Molekularströmung und der inneren Reibungsströmung der Gase durch Röhren"], [[Annalen der Physik]] 333 (1909) 75–130.&lt;/ref&gt; If the normalized [[mass flux]] through the channel is plotted over the [[Knudsen number]] based on the channel width a distinct minimum is observed around &lt;math&gt;Kn= 0.8&lt;/math&gt;. This is a paradoxical behaviour because, based on the [[Navier–Stokes equations]], one would expect the mass flux to decrease with increasing the Knudsen number. The minimum can be understood intuitively by considering the two extreme cases of very small and very large Knudsen number. For very small Kn the [[viscosity]] vanishes and a fully developed steady state channel flow shows infinite flux. On the other hand, the particles stop interacting for large Knudsen numbers. Because of the constant acceleration due to the external force, the steady state again will show infinite flux.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222551263_A_solution_algorithm_for_the_fluid_dynamic_equations_based_on_a_stochastic_model_for_molecular_motion], A solution algorithm for the fluid dynamic equations based on a stochastic model for molecular motion.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19840">[[Image:South Yorkshire outline map with UK.png|right|thumb|250px|South Yorkshire shown within the UK.]] This is a '''list of [[Sites of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSIs) in [[South Yorkshire]]''', [[United Kingdom]]. {{As of|2009}}, There are 35 sites designated within this [[Area of Search]], of which 18 have been designated due to their biological interest, 14 due to its geological interest, and 3 for both biological and geological interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SSSIs in South Yorkshire|work=Natural England|url=http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/special/sssi/searchresults.cfm?sssi_name=&amp;frmcounty=1036|accessdate=2007-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In England the body responsible for designating SSSIs is [[Natural England]], which chooses a site because of its [[fauna]], [[plant|flora]], [[geology|geological]] or physiographical features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notification of SSSIs |work=Natural England |url=http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/special/sssi/notification.cfm |accessdate=2007-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515062100/http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/special/sssi/notification.cfm |archivedate=2012-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural England took over the role of designating and managing SSSIs from [[English Nature]] in October 2006 when it was formed from the amalgamation of English Nature, parts of the [[Countryside Agency]] and the [[Rural Development Service]]. Natural England, like its predecessor, uses the [[Metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties of England|1974–1996 county system]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=County search of SSSIs |work=Natural Endland |url=http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/Special/sssi/search.cfm |accessdate=2007-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819192309/http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/Special/sssi/search.cfm |archivedate=2010-08-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and as such the same approach is followed here, rather than, for example, merging all [[Yorkshire]] sites into a single list. Natural England produces citation sheets for each SSSI and are the main source of information for this list.&lt;ref name="data"&gt;''[http://www.naturalengland.org.uk Natural England]'' citation sheets for each SSSI.

South Yorkshire's geography can be split into different types. The very west of South Yorkshire is part of [[Dark Peak]] which is part of the [[Peak District National Park]] and lies to the west of [[Sheffield]]. This extensive moorland is one of the largest semi-natural areas in England and has broad [[plateau]]s with rocky outcrops interspersed with valleys.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/Images/jca51_tcm2-21087_tcm6-4988.pdf Dark Peak], Natural England. Retrieved 2009-02-17&lt;/ref&gt; Moving east the land elevation drops with a transition from the peak district to coal fields. Much of this area of transition has seen urban development with Sheffield being a good example.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/Images/jca37tcm2-21136_tcm6-5181.pdf Yorkshire Southern Pennine Fringe], Natural England. Retrieved 2009-02-17&lt;/ref&gt;

The central region, to the north of [[Sheffield]] is largely dependent on the presence of coal measures in the areas geology. This is reflected by ancient woodlands, valley wetlands and large arable fields where there is no urban development. To the east of the coal measures is a strip of [[dolostone|Magnesian Limestone]] which runs north to south between Sheffield and [[Doncaster]]. This open landscape is characterised by ancient woodlands and limestone grasslands and often has historic limestone monuments. However the light and dry soils are ideal for cultivation which means little of the original habitat remains. In the very east of South Yorkshire the [[Humberhead Levels]] dominate, with the area being relatively flat and dominated by the areas river systems. The area is predominately covered with small fields or areas of [[peatland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/landscape/englands/character/areas/default.aspx Natural Character Areas], Natural England.

This is a '''list of Superfund sites in Arizona''' designated under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) environmental law.  The CERCLA federal law of 1980 authorized the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to create a list of [[Pollution|polluted]] locations requiring a long-term response to clean up hazardous material contaminations.&lt;ref&gt;P.L. 96-510, {{USC|42|9601|9675}}), December 11, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;   These locations are known as [[Superfund]] sites, and are placed on the [[National Priorities List]] (NPL).  

The NPL guides the EPA in "determining which sites warrant further investigation" for [[environmental remediation]].&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;  As of May 1, 2010, there were nine Superfund sites on the National Priorities List in [[Arizona]].&lt;ref name="NPL"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/npl/ |title=National Priorities List |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate=2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Three other sites have been cleaned up and removed from it; no sites are currently proposed for addition to the NPL.&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;

{{refimprove |date=September 2014}}
The following is a list of the [[class (biology)|classes]] in each [[phylum]] of the kingdom [[Animal]]ia. There are 107 classes of animals in 33 phyla in this list. However, different sources give different numbers of classes and phyla. For e.g, [[Protura]], [[Diplura]], and [[Collembola]] are often considered to be the three orders in the class [[Entognatha]]. This list should by no means be considered complete and authoritative and should be used carefully.

Below is the '''list of asteroid close approaches to Earth in 2014'''.

== Timeline of known close approaches less than one lunar distance from Earth in 2014 ==
A list of known [[near-Earth asteroid]] close approaches less than 1 [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|lunar distance]] (384,400 [[Kilometre|km]] or 0.00256 [[astronomical unit|AU]]) from Earth in 2014.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For a list of current Earth close approaches see [http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/ca NEO Earth Close Approaches]&lt;/ref&gt;

For reference, the radius of Earth is approximately {{convert|0.0000426|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} or 0.0166 Lunar distances.&lt;br&gt;The orbit of geosynchronous satellites, however, is {{convert|0.000282|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} or 0.110 Lunar distances. This year, 3 asteroids were detected which traveled nearer than this, most notably [[2014 AA]], which impacted. This list does not include any of the other [[List_of_bolides|32 objects that collided with earth in 2014]], none of which were discovered in advance, but were recorded by sensors designed to detect detonation of nuclear devices (of the 33 objects detected 5 had an impact energy greater than that of a 1 kiloton device) &lt;ref&gt;https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/fireballs/&lt;/ref&gt;.

{{color box|#ff9999}} Rows highlighted red indicate objects which were not discovered until after closest approach

{{color box|#ffff99}} Rows highlighted yellow indicate objects discovered less than 24 hours before closest approach

{{color box|#99ff99}} Rows highlighted green indicate objects discovered more than one week before closest approach (in 2014 only one object was detected on approach this far in advance, {{mp|2014 WX|202}})

{{color box|#79d8ff}} Rows highlighted blue indicate objects discovered more than one year before closest approach i.e. objects successfully cataloged on a previous orbit, rather than being detected during approach (in 2014, there were no objects detected this far in advance)

=== Notes ===
{{Reflist|group="note"}}

== Timeline of close approaches less than one Lunar distance from the Moon in 2014 ==
The number of asteroids listed here are significantly less than those of asteroids approaching Earth for several reasons:
* Asteroids approaching Earth not only move faster, but are brighter and are easier to detect with modern surveys due to these factors
* Asteroids approaching closer to Earth are higher priority to confirm, and only confirmed asteroids are listed with a lunocentric approach distance
* Those which make close approaches to the Moon are frequently lost in its glare, making them harder to confirm, and are more easily discovered during the new Moon, when the Moon is too close to the Sun for any asteroids to be detected while they are near to the Moon anyway.

These factors combined severely limit the amount of Moon-approaching asteroids, to a level many times lower than the detected asteroids to pass just as close to Earth instead.

'''''Kampō''''' (or ''Kanpō'', 漢方) medicine is the [[Japan]]ese study and adaptation of [[traditional Chinese medicine]]. In 1967, the Japanese [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Japan)|Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare]] approved four ''[[kampo]]'' medicines for reimbursement under the National Health Insurance (NHI) program. In 1976, 82 [[kampo]] medicines were approved by the [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Japan)|Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare]]. Currently, 148 [[kampo list|''kampo'' medicines]] are approved for reimbursement. [http://www.itmonline.org/arts/kampo.htm]

The 14th edition of the ''Japanese Pharmacopoeia'' (JP) (日本薬局方 Nihon yakkyokuhō) lists 165 herbal ingredients that are approved to be used in ''kampo'' remedies. [https://web.archive.org/web/20070926083230/http://www.herbalgram.org/youngliving/herbclip/pdfs/041806-179.pdf] The following are the most common herbs used in it:

Tsumura (ツムラ) is the leading maker;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060927141157/http://www.tsumura.co.jp/english/kampo/wik/resource.htm] they make 128 of the 148 ''kampo]] medicines. The "count" column shows in how many of these 128 formulae the herb is found. The most common herb  is [[Glycyrrhiza|Glycyrrhizae Radix]] (Chinese liquorice root). It is in 94 of the 128 Tsumura formulae. Other common herbs are [[Ginger|Zingiberis Rhizoma]] (ginger) (51 of 128 formulae) and [[Paeonia lactiflora|Paeoniae Radix]] (Chinese peony root) (44 of 128 formulae).

[[File:NL-Nationaleparken.svg|thumb|right|National Parks in the Netherlands]]
'''[[National park]]s in the [[Netherlands]]''' were defined in the 1960s as areas of at least 10&amp;nbsp;km² consisting of natural terrains, water and/or forests, with a special landscape and flora and fauna.

The first two national parks were founded in the 1930s by private organisations. The first official national park, [[Schiermonnikoog National Park]], was not established until 1989. The most recent national park to have been established is the [[Nieuw Land National Park]], which is established in 2018.

In 2011, the government decided to make the provinces responsible for the national parks.

The following page lists all '''[[nuclear power station]]s''' that are larger than {{nowrap|1,000 [[Megawatt|MW]]}} in current net capacity. Those power stations that are smaller than {{nowrap|1,000 MW}}, and those that are only at a planning or proposal stage, may be found in regional lists at the end of the page or in the [[list of nuclear reactors]]. The list is based on figures from PRIS (Power Reactor Information System) maintained by [[International Atomic Energy Agency]].

This table lists all currently operational power stations with current net capacity over {{nowrap|1,000 MW}}. Some of these may have reactors under construction, but only current net capacity is listed. Capacity of permanently shut-down reactors is not included, but capacity of long-term shut-down reactors is included. Power stations with past net capacity over {{nowrap|1,000 MW}} and current net capacity under {{nowrap|1,000 MW}} are listed in third table.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9461">'''Parson-naturalists''' were [[Minister (Christianity)|ministers of religion]] who also studied [[natural history]]. The archetypical [[parson-naturalist]] was a [[Priest#Anglican or Episcopalian|priest in the Church of England]] in charge of a country parish, who saw the study of science as an [[Relationship between religion and science|extension of his religious work]]. The philosophy entailed the belief that God, as the Creator of all things, wanted man to understand his Creations and thus to study them through [[scientific technique]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; They often collected and preserved natural artefacts such as leaves, flowers, birds' eggs, birds, insects, and small mammals to classify and study. Some wrote books or kept nature diaries.

| Bossier City, Louisiana, US
| This "Winter" Tornado occurred at 2&amp;nbsp;a.m., with winds peaking at 260&amp;nbsp;mph, cutting an 8 mile long, 1/2 mile wide path of devastation. Classified as an F4 on the [[Fujita scale|Fujita Scale]], this monster tornado caused over 100 million dollars in damage, injuring 266 people, and killing two young girls, ages 8 and 13. The girls were killed as they slept in their beds when the tornado lifted and threw a car into their home, which landed directly on their bedroom. The minimal loss of life during this tornado was attributed to the fact that the majority of the town's population was at home asleep at this time of day.

'''''Millennium Live''''' is a cancelled international [[television special]], which was an unsuccessful attempt to broadcast an international celebration of the beginning of the Year 2000, or the so-called [[Millennium]]. Reports claimed that the show was to have involved broadcasters in up to 130 nations. ''Millennium Live: Humanity's Broadcast'' was going to compete against the ''[[2000 Today]]'' international broadcast that was supported by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in the [[United States]], and led by [[BBC]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]].

The programme was called off on 28 December 1999 when its organizers, the Millennium Television Network (MTN), announced that it had failed to obtain sufficient financing for the broadcast. MTN reportedly was not paying production and satellite companies for their services prior to the cancellation before MTN shelved their efforts to establish a global broadcast for the following New Year's Eve.

==History==

The '''photoelectric effect''' is the emission of [[electron]]s or other free carriers when [[light]] shines on a material. Electrons emitted in this manner can be called ''photo electrons''. This phenomenon is commonly studied in [[electronics|electronic]] [[physics]], as well as in fields of [[chemistry]], such as [[quantum chemistry]] or [[electrochemistry]].

According to [[classical electromagnetism|classical electromagnetic]] theory, this effect can be attributed to the transfer of [[energy]] from the light to an electron. From this perspective, an alteration in the [[intensity (physics)|intensity]] of light would induce changes in the kinetic energy of the electrons emitted from the metal. Furthermore, according to this theory, a sufficiently dim light would be expected to show a time lag between the initial shining of its light and the subsequent emission of an electron. However, the experimental results did not correlate with either of the two predictions made by classical theory.

Instead, electrons are dislodged only by the impingement of photons when those photons reach or exceed a threshold [[frequency]] (energy). Below that threshold, no electrons are emitted from the material regardless of the light intensity or the length of time of exposure to the light. (Rarely, an electron will escape by absorbing two or more quanta. However, this is extremely rare because by the time it absorbs enough quanta to escape, the electron will probably have emitted the rest of the quanta.) To make sense of the fact that light can eject electrons even if its intensity is low, [[Albert Einstein]] proposed that a beam of light is not a wave propagating through space, but rather a collection of [[Photon|discrete wave packets]] (photons), each with energy ''hν''. This shed light on [[Max Planck]]'s previous discovery of the [[Planck's relation|Planck relation]] ({{nowrap|1=''E'' = ''hν''}}) linking energy (''E'') and frequency (''[[ν]]'') as arising from quantization of energy. The factor ''h'' is known as the [[Planck constant]].&lt;ref name="serway_1"&gt;{{cite book

In 1900, while studying [[black-body radiation]], the German physicist [[Max Planck]] suggested that the energy carried by electromagnetic waves could only be released in "packets" of energy. In 1905, [[Albert Einstein]] published a paper advancing the hypothesis that light energy is carried in discrete quantized packets to explain experimental data from the photoelectric effect. This model contributed to the development of [[quantum mechanics]]. In 1914, [[Millikan's Experiment]] supported Einstein's model of the photoelectric effect. Einstein was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize]] in 1921 for "his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The photoelectric effect requires photons with energies approaching zero (in the case of negative electron affinity) to over 1 [[MeV]] for core electrons in [[Chemical element|elements]] with a high [[atomic number]]. Emission of conduction electrons from typical metals usually requires a few electron-volts, corresponding to short-wavelength visible or ultraviolet light. Study of the photoelectric effect led to important steps in understanding the quantum nature of light and electrons and influenced the formation of the concept of [[wave–particle duality]].&lt;ref name="serway_1" /&gt; Other phenomena where light affects the movement of electric charges include the photoconductive effect (also known as [[photoconductivity]] or [[photoresistor|photoresistivity]]), the [[photovoltaic effect]], and the [[photoelectrochemical cell|photoelectrochemical effect]].

Photoemission can occur from any material, but it is most easily observable from metals or other conductors because the process produces a charge imbalance, and if this charge imbalance is not neutralized by current flow (enabled by conductivity), the potential barrier to emission increases until the emission current ceases. It is also usual to have the emitting surface in a vacuum, since gases impede the flow of photoelectrons and make them difficult to observe. Additionally, the energy barrier to photoemission is usually increased by thin oxide layers on metal surfaces if the metal has been exposed to oxygen, so most practical experiments and devices based on the photoelectric effect use clean metal surfaces in a vacuum.

When the photoelectron is emitted into a solid rather than into a vacuum, the term ''internal photoemission'' is often used, and emission into a vacuum distinguished as ''external photoemission''.
[[File:Versuch zum Fotoeffekt.png|thumb|right|Schematic of experimental apparatus to demonstrate the photoelectric effect. The filter passes light of certain wavelengths from the lamp at left. The light strikes the curved electrode, and electrons are emitted. The adjustable voltage can be increased until the current stops flowing. This "stopping voltage" is a function only of the electrode material and the frequency of the incident light, and is not affected by the intensity of the light.]]

==Emission mechanism==
The photons of a light beam have [[photon energy|a characteristic energy proportional to the frequency of the light]]. In the photoemission process, if an electron within some material absorbs the energy of one photon and acquires more energy than the [[work function]] (the electron binding energy) of the material, it is ejected. If the photon energy is too low, the electron is unable to escape the material. Since an increase in the intensity of low-frequency light will only increase the number of low-energy photons sent over a given interval of time, this change in intensity will not create any single photon with enough energy to dislodge an electron. Thus, the energy of the emitted electrons does not depend on the intensity of the incoming light, but only on the energy (equivalent frequency) of the individual photons. It is an interaction between the incident photon and the outermost electrons.

Electrons can absorb energy from photons when irradiated, but they usually follow an "all or nothing" principle. All of the energy from one photon must be absorbed and used to liberate one electron from atomic binding, or else the energy is re-emitted. If the photon energy is absorbed, some of the energy liberates the electron from the atom, and the rest contributes to the electron's [[kinetic energy]] as a free particle.&lt;ref name="Ref_Lenard"&gt;{{cite journal

===Experimental observations of photoelectric emission===
The theory of the photoelectric effect must explain the experimental observations of the emission of electrons from an illuminated metal surface.

For a given metal surface, there exists a certain minimum frequency of incident [[radiation]] below which no photoelectrons are emitted. This frequency is called the ''threshold frequency''. Increasing the frequency of the incident beam, keeping the number of incident photons fixed (this would result in a proportionate increase in energy) increases the maximum [[kinetic energy]] of the photoelectrons emitted. Thus the stopping [[voltage]] increases. The number of electrons also changes because of the [[probability]] that each photon results in an emitted electron are a function of [[photon energy]]. If the intensity of the incident radiation of a given frequency is increased, there is no effect on the kinetic energy of each photoelectron.

Above the threshold frequency, the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted photoelectron depends on the frequency of the incident light, but is independent of the intensity of the incident light so long as the latter is not too high.&lt;ref name="Zhang1996"&gt;{{cite journal
 |last1=Zhang |first1=Q.

 |title=Intensity dependence of the photoelectric effect induced by a circularly polarized laser beam

 |bibcode=1996PhLA..216..125Z
 |doi=10.1016/0375-9601(96)00259-9
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a given metal and frequency of incident radiation, the rate at which photoelectrons are ejected is directly proportional to the intensity of the incident light. An increase in the intensity of the incident beam (keeping the frequency fixed) increases the magnitude of the photoelectric current, although the stopping voltage remains the same.

The time lag between the incidence of radiation and the emission of a photoelectron is very small, less than 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; second.

The direction of distribution of emitted electrons peaks in the direction of [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] (the direction of the electric field) of the incident light, if it is linearly polarized.&lt;ref name="Bupp"&gt;{{cite journal

===Mathematical description===
In 1905, Einstein proposed an explanation of the photoelectric effect using a concept first put forward by Max Planck that light waves consist of tiny bundles or packets of energy known as [[photons]] or quanta. [[File: Photoelectric effect diagram.svg|thumb|Diagram of the maximum kinetic energy as a function of the frequency of light on zinc]]
The maximum [[kinetic energy]] &lt;math&gt;K_\mathrm{max}&lt;/math&gt; of an ejected electron is given by

:&lt;math&gt;K_\mathrm{max} = h\,f - \varphi,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Planck constant]] and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the frequency of the incident photon. The term &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is the [[work function]] (sometimes denoted &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = h\,f_0,&lt;/math&gt;

===Stopping potential===
&lt;!--needs a diagram, P's and Q's confusing otherwise --&gt;
The relation between [[Electric current|current]] and applied [[voltage]] illustrates the nature of the photoelectric effect. For discussion, a light source illuminates a plate P, and another plate electrode Q collects any emitted electrons. We vary the potential between P and Q and measure the current flowing in the external circuit between the two plates.

If the frequency and the intensity of the incident radiation are fixed, the photoelectric current increases gradually with an increase in the positive potential on the collector electrode until all the photoelectrons emitted are collected. The photoelectric current attains a saturation value and does not increase further for any increase in the positive potential. The saturation current increases with the increase of the light intensity. It also increases with greater frequencies due to a greater probability of electron emission when collisions happen with higher energy photons.

If we apply a [[negative potential]] to the collector plate Q with respect to the plate P and gradually increase it, the photoelectric current decreases, becoming zero at a certain negative potential. The negative potential on the collector at which the photoelectric current becomes zero is called the ''stopping potential'' or ''cut off'' potential&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

i. For a given frequency of incident radiation, the stopping potential is independent of its intensity.

ii. For a given frequency of incident radiation, the stopping potential is determined by the maximum kinetic energy &lt;math&gt;K_\mathrm{max}&lt;/math&gt; of the photoelectrons that are emitted. If ''q&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the charge on the electron and &lt;math&gt;V_0&lt;/math&gt; is the stopping potential, then the work done by the retarding potential in stopping the electron is &lt;math&gt;q_eV_0&lt;/math&gt;, so we have

:&lt;math&gt;q_eV_0 = K_\mathrm{max}.&lt;/math&gt;

Recalling
:&lt;math&gt;K_\mathrm{max} = h \left(f - f_0\right),&lt;/math&gt;

we see that the stopping voltage varies linearly with frequency of light, but depends on the type of material. For any particular material, there is a threshold frequency that must be exceeded, independent of light intensity, to observe any electron emission.

==History==
When a surface is exposed to electromagnetic radiation above a certain threshold [[frequency]] (typically visible light for [[alkali metals]], near [[ultraviolet]] for other metals, and [[extreme ultraviolet]] for non-metals), the radiation is absorbed and [[electron]]s are emitted.
Light, and especially ultra-violet light, discharges negatively electrified bodies with the production of rays of the same nature as [[cathode rays]].&lt;ref name="Smithsonian report" /&gt; Under certain circumstances it can directly ionize gases.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian report" /&gt; The first of these phenomena was discovered by Hertz and Hallwachs in 1887.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian report" /&gt; The second was announced first by [[Philipp Lenard]] in 1900.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian report" /&gt;

The ultra-violet light to produce these effects may be obtained from an [[arc lamp]], or by burning magnesium, or by sparking with an induction coil between zinc or cadmium terminals, the light from which is very rich in ultra-violet rays. Sunlight is not rich in ultra-violet rays, as these have been absorbed by the atmosphere, and it does not produce nearly so large an effect as the arc-light. Many substances besides metals discharge negative electricity under the action of ultraviolet light: lists of these substances will be found in papers by G. C. Schmidt&lt;ref name="Ref_c"&gt;Schmidt, G. C. (1898) Wied. Ann. Uiv. p. 708.&lt;/ref&gt; and O.

===19th century===
In 1839, [[A. E. Becquerel|Alexandre Edmond Becquerel]] discovered the [[photovoltaic effect]] while studying the effect of light on [[electrolytic cell]]s.&lt;ref name="Petrova-KochHezel2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Vesselinka Petrova-Koch|author2=Rudolf Hezel|author3=Adolf Goetzberger|title=High-Efficient Low-Cost Photovoltaics: Recent Developments|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/vn6024740l4343p6/|year=2009|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-79358-8|pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though not equivalent to the photoelectric effect, his work on [[photovoltaics]] was instrumental in showing a strong relationship between light and electronic properties of materials. In 1873, [[Willoughby Smith]] discovered [[photoconductivity]] in [[selenium]] while testing the metal for its high resistance properties in conjunction with his work involving submarine telegraph cables.&lt;ref name="Smith1873"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Smith, W.|url=https://www.histv.net/willoughby-smith|year=1873|title=Effect of Light on Selenium during the passage of an Electric Current|doi=10.1038/007303e0|journal=Nature|page=303|volume=7|issue=173|bibcode = 1873Natur...7R.303. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johann Elster (1854–1920) and Hans Geitel (1855–1923), students in [[Heidelberg]], developed the first practical photoelectric cells that could be used to measure the intensity of light.&lt;ref name="Ref_e"&gt;Asimov, A.

For [[copper]], [[platinum]], [[lead]], [[iron]], [[cadmium]], [[carbon]], and [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] the effects with ordinary light are too small to be measurable. The order of the metals for this effect is the same as in Volta's series for contact-electricity, the most electropositive metals giving the largest photo-electric effect.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1887, [[Heinrich Hertz]] observed the photoelectric effect and the production and reception of electromagnetic waves.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian report"&gt;Report of the Board of Regents By Smithsonian Institution. Board of Regents, United States National Museum, Smithsonian Institution. [https://books.google.com/books?id=ic0rAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA239 p. 239].&lt;/ref&gt; He published these observations in the journal [[Annalen der Physik]]. His receiver consisted of a coil with a [[spark gap]], where a spark would be seen upon detection of electromagnetic waves. He placed the apparatus in a darkened box to see the spark better. However, he noticed that the maximum spark length was reduced when in the box. A glass panel placed between the source of electromagnetic waves and the receiver absorbed ultraviolet radiation that assisted the electrons in jumping across the gap. When removed, the spark length would increase. He observed no decrease in spark length when he replaced the glass with quartz, as [[quartz]] does not absorb UV radiation. [[Hertz]] concluded his months of investigation and reported the results obtained. He did not further pursue the investigation of this effect.

The discovery by Hertz&lt;ref name="Ref_f"&gt;Hertz, Wied. Ann. xxxi. p. 983, 1887.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1887 that the incidence of ultra-violet light on a spark gap facilitated the passage of the spark, led immediately to a series of investigations by [[Wilhelm Hallwachs|Hallwachs]],&lt;ref name="Ref_g"&gt;Hallwachs, Wied.

It was proved by these investigations that a newly cleaned surface of zinc, if charged with negative electricity, rapidly loses this charge however small it may be when ultra-violet light falls upon the surface; while if the surface is uncharged to begin with, it acquires a positive charge when exposed to the light, the negative electrification going out into the gas by which the metal is surrounded; this positive electrification can be much increased by directing a strong airblast against the surface.

With regard to the ''Hertz effect'', the researchers from the start showed a great complexity of the phenomenon of photoelectric fatigue — that is, the progressive diminution of the effect observed upon fresh metallic surfaces. According to an important research by [[Wilhelm Hallwachs]], ozone played an important part in the phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Ref_m"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/andp.19073280807|title=Über die lichtelektrische Ermüdung|year=1907|last1=Hallwachs|first1=W.|journal=Annalen der Physik|volume=328|issue=8|pages=459–516|bibcode = 1907AnP...328..459H }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other elements enter such as oxidation, the humidity, the mode of polish of the surface, etc. It was at the time not even sure that the fatigue is absent in a vacuum.

In the period from February 1888 and until 1891, a detailed analysis of photoeffect was performed by [[Aleksandr Stoletov]] with results published in 6 works;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stoletow, A.|year=1888 |title=Sur une sorte de courants electriques provoques par les rayons ultraviolets |journal=[[Comptes rendus de l'Académie des sciences|Comptes Rendus]] |volume=CVI |page=1149}} (Reprinted in {{cite journal|doi=10.1080/14786448808628270|title=On a kind of electric current produced by ultra-violet rays|year=1888|last1=Stoletow|first1=M.A.|journal=Philosophical Magazine |series=Series 5|volume=26|issue=160|page=317}}; abstract in Beibl.

First, in these works Stoletov invented a new experimental setup which was more suitable for a quantitative analysis of photoeffect. Using this setup, he discovered the direct proportionality between the intensity of light and the induced photo electric current (the first law of photoeffect or [[Stoletov's law]]). One of his other findings resulted from measurements of the dependence of the intensity of the electric photo current on the gas pressure, where he found the existence of an optimal gas pressure P&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; corresponding to a maximum [[photocurrent]]; this property was used for a creation of [[solar cell]]s.{{citation needed|date=October 2009}}

In 1899, [[J. J. Thomson]] investigated [[ultraviolet light]] in [[Geissler tube|Crookes tubes]].&lt;ref name="Ref_o"&gt;''The International Year Book''. (1900). New York: Dodd, Mead &amp; Company. p. 659.&lt;/ref&gt; Thomson deduced that the ejected particles were the same as those previously found in the cathode ray, later called electrons, which he called "corpuscles". In the research, Thomson enclosed a metal plate (a cathode) in a vacuum tube, and exposed it to high-frequency radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was thought that the oscillating electromagnetic fields caused the atoms' field to resonate and, after reaching a certain amplitude, caused a subatomic "corpuscle" to be emitted, and current to be detected. The amount of this current varied with the intensity and color of the radiation. Larger radiation intensity or frequency would produce more current.{{citation needed|date=October 2009}}

===20th century===
The discovery of the ionization of gases by ultra-violet light was made by [[Philipp Eduard Anton von Lenard|Philipp Lenard]] in 1900. As the effect was produced across several centimeters of air and made very great positive and small negative ions, it was natural to interpret the phenomenon, as did J. J. Thomson, as a ''Hertz effect'' upon the solid or liquid particles present in the gas.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian report" /&gt;

In 1902, Lenard observed that the [[energy]] of individual emitted electrons increased with the [[frequency]] (which is related to the [[color]]) of the light.&lt;ref name="Ref_Lenard" /&gt;

This appeared to be at odds with Maxwell's [[wave theory of light]], which predicted that the electron energy would be proportional to the [[intensity (physics)|intensity]] of the radiation.

Lenard observed the variation in electron energy with light frequency using a powerful electric arc lamp which enabled him to investigate large changes in intensity, and that had sufficient power to enable him to investigate the variation of potential with light frequency. His experiment directly measured potentials, not electron kinetic energy: he found the electron energy by relating it to the maximum stopping potential (voltage) in a phototube. He found that the calculated maximum electron [[kinetic energy]] is determined by the frequency of the light. For example, an increase in frequency results in an increase in the maximum kinetic energy calculated for an electron upon liberation – [[ultraviolet radiation]] would require a higher applied stopping potential to stop current in a phototube than blue light. However, Lenard's results were qualitative rather than quantitative because of the difficulty in performing the experiments: the experiments needed to be done on freshly cut metal so that the pure metal was observed, but it oxidized in a matter of minutes even in the partial vacuums he used. The current emitted by the surface was determined by the light's intensity, or brightness: doubling the intensity of the light doubled the number of electrons emitted from the surface.

The researches of Langevin and those of Eugene Bloch&lt;ref name="Ref_p"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1051/radium:0190800508024001|title=L'ionisation de l'air par la lumière ultra-violette|year=1908|last1=Bloch|first1=E.|journal=Le Radium|volume=5|issue=8|page=240}}&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that the greater part of the [[Lenard effect]] is certainly due to this 'Hertz effect'.

In 1905, [[Albert Einstein]] solved this apparent paradox by describing light as composed of discrete quanta, now called [[photon]]s, rather than continuous waves. Based upon [[Max Planck]]'s theory of [[black-body radiation]], Einstein theorized that the energy in each quantum of light was equal to the frequency multiplied by a constant, later called [[Planck's constant]]. A photon above a threshold frequency has the required energy to eject a single electron, creating the observed effect. This discovery led to the [[quantum]] revolution in physics and earned Einstein the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1921.&lt;ref name="Ref_s"&gt;{{cite web|title = The Nobel Prize in Physics 1921|publisher = Nobel Foundation|url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1921/index.html|accessdate=2008-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; By wave-particle duality the effect can be analyzed purely in terms of waves though not as conveniently.&lt;ref name="Lamb1968"&gt;{{cite news|first = Willis E.|last = Lamb|author-link = Willis Lamb|last2 = Scully|first2 = Marlan O.|title = Photoelectric effect without photons, discussing classical field falling on quantized atomic electron |url =http://users.unimi.it/aqm/wp-content/uploads/Lamb-1968.pdf|year = 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Albert Einstein]]'s mathematical description of how the photoelectric effect was caused by absorption of [[quantum|quanta]] of light was in [[Annus Mirabilis papers|one of his 1905 papers]], named "''On a Heuristic Viewpoint Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light''". This paper proposed the simple description of "light quanta", or photons, and showed how they explained such phenomena as the photoelectric effect. His simple explanation in terms of absorption of discrete [[quantum|quanta]] of light explained the features of the phenomenon and the characteristic frequency.

The idea of light quanta began with Max Planck's published law of [[Planck's law|black-body radiation]] ("''On the Law of Distribution of Energy in the Normal Spectrum''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Ueber das Gesetz der Energieverteilung im Normalspectrum (On the Law of Distribution of Energy in the Normal Spectrum)|journal=Annalen der Physik|volume=4|page=553 |year=1901|doi=10.1002/andp.19013090310|last1=Planck|first1=Max|issue=3|bibcode=1901AnP...309..553P}}&lt;/ref&gt;) by assuming that Hertzian oscillators could only exist at energies ''E'' proportional to the frequency ''f'' of the oscillator by ''E'' = ''hf'', where ''h'' is Planck's constant. By assuming that light actually consisted of discrete energy packets, Einstein wrote an equation for the photoelectric effect that agreed with experimental results. It explained why the energy of photoelectrons was dependent only on the ''frequency'' of the incident light and not on its ''intensity'': a low-intensity, the high-frequency source could supply a few high energy photons, whereas a high-intensity, the low-frequency source would supply no photons of sufficient individual energy to dislodge any electrons. This was an enormous theoretical leap, but the concept was strongly resisted at first because it contradicted the wave theory of light that followed naturally from [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s equations for electromagnetic behavior, and more generally, the assumption of [[infinite divisibility]] of energy in physical systems. Even after experiments showed that Einstein's equations for the photoelectric effect were accurate, [[Photon#Early objections|resistance to the idea]] of photons continued since it appeared to contradict Maxwell's equations, which were well understood and verified.

Einstein's work predicted that the energy of individual ejected electrons increases linearly with the frequency of the light. Perhaps surprisingly, the precise relationship had not at that time been tested. By 1905 it was known that the energy of photoelectrons increases with increasing ''frequency'' of incident light and is independent of the ''intensity'' of the light. However, the manner of the increase was not experimentally determined until 1914 when [[Robert Andrews Millikan]] showed that Einstein's prediction was correct.&lt;ref name="Ref_Millikan" /&gt;

The photoelectric effect helped to propel the then-emerging concept of [[wave–particle duality]] in the nature of [[light]]. Light simultaneously possesses the characteristics of both waves and particles, each being manifested according to the circumstances. The effect was impossible to understand in terms of the classical [[wave]] description of light,&lt;ref name="Ref_u"&gt;Resnick, Robert (1972) ''Basic Concepts in Relativity and Early Quantum Theory'', Wiley, p. 137, {{ISBN|0-471-71702-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref_"&gt;Knight, Randall D.

Classical theory predicted that the electrons would 'gather up' energy over a period of time, and then be emitted.&lt;ref name="Ref_" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref_w"&gt;Resnick, Robert (1972) ''Basic Concepts in Relativity and Early Quantum Theory'', Wiley, p. 138, {{ISBN|0-471-71702-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses and effects==
===Photomultipliers===
{{Main|Photomultiplier}}
These are extremely light-sensitive vacuum tubes with a [[photocathode]] coated onto part (an end or side) of the inside of the envelope. The photocathode contains combinations of materials such as cesium, rubidium, and antimony specially selected to provide a low work function, so when illuminated even by very low levels of light, the photocathode readily releases electrons. By means of a series of electrodes (dynodes) at ever-higher potentials, these electrons are accelerated and substantially increased in number through [[secondary emission]] to provide a readily detectable output current. Photomultipliers are still commonly used wherever low levels of light must be detected.&lt;ref name="Ref_Timothy"&gt;Timothy, J. Gethyn (2010) in Huber, Martin C.E. (ed.) ''Observing Photons in Space'', ISSI Scientific Report 009, ESA Communications, pp. 365–408, {{ISBN|978-92-9221-938-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Image sensors===
[[Video camera tube]]s in the early days of [[television]] used the photoelectric effect, for example, [[Philo Farnsworth]]'s "[[Image dissector]]" used a screen charged by the photoelectric effect to transform an optical image into a scanned electronic signal.&lt;ref name="Ref_x"&gt;Burns, R. W. (1998) ''Television: An International History of the Formative Years'', IET, p. 358, {{ISBN|0-85296-914-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gold-leaf electroscope===
[[File:Gold leaf electroscope diagram.svg|thumb|right|200px|The gold leaf [[electroscope]]]]
Gold-leaf [[electroscope]]s are designed to detect [[static electricity]]. Charge placed on the metal cap spreads to the stem and the gold leaf of the electroscope. Because they then have the same charge, the stem and leaf repel each other. This will cause the leaf to bend away from the stem.

An electroscope is an important tool in illustrating the photoelectric effect. For example, if the electroscope is negatively charged throughout, there is an excess of electrons and the leaf is separated from the stem. If high-frequency light shines on the cap, the electroscope discharges, and the leaf will fall limp. This is because the frequency of the light shining on the cap is above the cap's threshold frequency. The photons in the light have enough energy to liberate electrons from the cap, reducing its negative charge. This will discharge a negatively charged electroscope and further charge a positive electroscope. However, if the electromagnetic radiation hitting the metal cap does not have a high enough frequency (its frequency is below the threshold value for the cap), then the leaf will never discharge, no matter how long one shines the low-frequency light at the cap.&lt;ref name=Tsokos&gt;{{cite book

===Photoelectron spectroscopy===
Since the energy of the photoelectrons emitted is exactly the energy of the incident photon minus the material's work function or binding energy, the work function of a sample can be determined by bombarding it with a [[monochromatic]] [[X-ray]] source or [[Ultraviolet|UV]] source, and measuring the kinetic energy distribution of the electrons emitted.&lt;ref name="Stefan2003" /&gt;{{rp|14–20}}

[[Photoelectron spectroscopy]] is usually done in a high-vacuum environment, since the electrons would be scattered by gas molecules if they were present. However, some companies are now selling products that allow photoemission in air. The light source can be a laser, a discharge tube, or a [[synchrotron radiation]] source.&lt;ref name="Ref_aa"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Solid-State Photoelectron Spectroscopy with Synchrotron Radiation|doi=10.1126/science.206.4415.151|year=1979|last1=Weaver|first1=J. H.|last2=Margaritondo|first2=G.|journal=Science|volume=206|issue=4415|pages=151–156|pmid=17801770|bibcode=1979Sci...206..151W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concentric hemispherical analyzer is a typical electron energy analyzer and uses an electric field to change the directions of incident electrons, depending on their kinetic energies. For every element and core (atomic orbital) there will be a different binding energy. The many electrons created from each of these combinations will show up as spikes in the analyzer output, and these can be used to determine the elemental composition of the sample.

===Spacecraft===
The photoelectric effect will cause [[spacecraft]] exposed to sunlight to develop a positive charge. This can be a major problem, as other parts of the spacecraft are in shadow which will result in the spacecraft developing a negative charge from nearby plasmas. The imbalance can discharge through delicate electrical components. The [[static electricity|static charge]] created by the photoelectric effect is self-limiting, because a higher charged object doesn't give up its electrons as easily as a lower charged object does.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Moon dust===
Light from the sun hitting lunar dust causes it to become charged with the photoelectric effect. The charged dust then repels itself and lifts off the surface of the [[Moon]] by [[electrostatic levitation]].&lt;ref name="Ref_ac"&gt;[https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2005/30mar_moonfountains/ Bell, Trudy E., "Moon fountains"], NASA.gov, 2005-03-30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref_ad"&gt;[http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Dust_Gets_A_Charge_In_A_Vacuum.html Dust gets a charge in a vacuum]. spacedaily.com, July 14, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; This manifests itself almost like an "atmosphere of dust", visible as a thin haze and blurring of distant features, and visible as a dim glow after the sun has set. This was first photographed by the [[Surveyor program]] probes in the 1960s. It is thought that the smallest particles are repelled kilometers from the surface and that the particles move in "fountains" as they charge and discharge.

===Night vision devices===
Photons hitting a thin film of alkali metal or [[semiconductor]] material such as gallium arsenide in an [[image intensifier]] tube cause the ejection of photoelectrons due to the photoelectric effect. These are accelerated by an [[electrostatic field]] where they strike a [[phosphor]] coated screen, converting the electrons back into photons. Intensification of the signal is achieved either through acceleration of the electrons or by increasing the number of electrons through secondary emissions, such as with a [[micro-channel plate]]. Sometimes a combination of both methods is used. Additional kinetic energy is required to move an electron out of the conduction band and into the vacuum level. This is known as the [[electron affinity]] of the photocathode and is another barrier to photoemission other than the forbidden band, explained by the [[band gap]] model. Some materials such as Gallium Arsenide have an effective electron affinity that is below the level of the conduction band. In these materials, electrons that move to the conduction band are all of the sufficient energy to be emitted from the material and as such, the film that absorbs photons can be quite thick. These materials are known as negative electron affinity materials.

==Cross section==
The photoelectric effect is one interaction mechanism between photons and atoms. It is one of 12 theoretically possible interactions.&lt;ref name="Evans1955a"&gt;{{cite book|title = The Atomic Nucleus|author = Evans, R. D.|year = 1955|page= 673|url = https://archive.org/details/atomicnucleus032805mbp|isbn = 0-89874-414-8|publisher = Krieger|location = Malabar, Fla.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the high photon energies comparable to the electron rest energy of {{val|511|u=keV}}, [[Compton scattering]], another process, may take place. Above twice this ({{val|1.022|u=MeV}}) [[pair production]] may take place.&lt;ref name="Evans1955"&gt;{{cite book|title = The Atomic Nucleus|author = Evans, R. D.|year = 1955|page= 712|url = https://archive.org/details/atomicnucleus032805mbp|isbn = 0-89874-414-8|publisher = Krieger|location = Malabar, Fla.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compton scattering and pair production are examples of two other competing mechanisms.

Indeed, even if the photoelectric effect is the favoured reaction for a particular single-photon bound-electron interaction, the result is also subject to statistical processes and is not guaranteed, albeit the photon has certainly disappeared and a bound electron has been excited (usually K or L shell electrons at [[gamma ray]] energies). The probability of the photoelectric effect occurring is measured by the cross-section of interaction, σ. This has been found to be a function of the atomic number of the target atom and photon energy. A crude approximation, for photon energies above the highest atomic binding energy, is given by:&lt;ref name="Davisson1965"&gt;{{cite book|title = Interaction of gamma-radiation with matter|author = Davisson, C. M.|year = 1965|pages = 37–78|bibcode = 1965abgs.conf...37D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \sigma = \mathrm{constant} \cdot \frac{Z^n}{E^3} &lt;/math&gt;

Here ''Z'' is [[atomic number]] and ''n'' is a number which varies between 4 and 5. (At lower photon energies a characteristic structure with edges appears, K edge, L edges, M edges, etc.) The obvious interpretation follows that the photoelectric effect rapidly decreases in significance, in the gamma-ray region of the spectrum, with increasing photon energy, and that photoelectric effect increases steeply with atomic number. The corollary is that high-''Z'' materials make good gamma-ray shields, which is the principal reason that lead (''Z'' = 82) is a preferred and ubiquitous gamma radiation shield.&lt;ref name="Knoll1999"&gt;{{cite book|title = Radiation Detection and Measurement|author = Knoll, Glenn F.|year = 1999|page = 49|url = http://sitemaker.umich.edu/gknoll/home|isbn = 0-471-49545-X|publisher = Wiley|location = New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cretaceous polar forests''' were [[temperate forest]]s that grew at polar latitudes during the final period of the [[Mesozoic]] Era, known as the [[Cretaceous]] Period 145–66&amp;nbsp;Ma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stratigraphy.org/index.php/ics-chart-timescale |title=International Chronostratigraphic Chart |publisher=[[International Commission on Stratigraphy]] |accessdate=June 5, 2013 |date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, global average temperature was about {{convert|10|C-change|F-change}} higher and [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) levels were approximately 1000 [[parts per million]] (ppm), 2.5 times the current concentration in Earth's atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Peralta"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Emiliano Peralta-Medina |author2=Howard J. Falcon-Lang |last-author-amp=yes |date=2012 |title=Cretaceous forest composition and productivity inferred from a global fossil wood database |journal=[[Geology (journal)|Geology]] |volume=40 |issue=3 |pages=219–222 |doi=10.1130/G32733.1|bibcode=2012Geo....40..219P }}&lt;/ref&gt; The abundance of atmospheric carbon dioxide had a very significant impact on global climate and Earth's natural systems as its concentration is considered one of the main factors in the development of a pronounced [[greenhouse Earth]] during the Cretaceous with a very low average global temperature gradient. As a consequence, high paleolatitudes in both hemispheres were much warmer than at present. This temperature gradient was partly responsible for the lack of continental [[ice sheet]]s in polar regions.&lt;ref name="Peralta"/&gt;

As a response to elevated global temperatures, the Earth's [[hydrologic cycle]] was significantly enhanced due to greater volume of moisture evaporation from the surface of the ocean. In turn, the absolute [[sea level]] during this time period stood at elevations much higher than the present level. Continental encroachment of seawater formed widespread shallow seas, including expanses of [[epeiric seas]].

An increase in surface area between shallow, warm epeiric seawater and the atmosphere permits higher evaporation rates and more precipitation at various latitudes, producing a more temperate global climate. A widespread temperate climate also had significant effects on high latitude ecosystems.

==Cretaceous polar forests==
During the Cretaceous, temperate forests thrived at polar latitudes,&lt;ref name="Peralta"/&gt; as there was a notable difference from current conditions at high latitudes during the Cretaceous polar seasons.&lt;ref name="Brentnall_et_al."&gt;{{cite journal |display-authors=4 |author=S. J. Brentnall |author2=D. J. Beerling |authorlink2 = David Beerling|author3=C. P. Osborne |author4=M. Harland |author5=J. E. Fancis |author6=P. J. Valdes |author7=V. W.

J. Beerling |authorlink = David Beerling|author2=C. P. Osborne |last-author-amp=yes |date=2002 |title=Physiological ecology of Mesozoic polar forests in a high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; environment |journal=[[Annals of Botany]] |volume=89 |issue=3 |pages=329–339 |doi=10.1093/aob/mcf045|pmc=4233824 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This variation in light is thought to have played a critical role in the composition and evolution of polar forests. Fossilized flora evidence suggests the presence of paleoforests up to latitudes of 85° in both Northern and Southern hemispheres. The dominant forms of vegetation at these high latitudes during the previous 100 million years were rapidly evolving and ultimately being replaced during a time known as the [[Cretaceous Terrestrial Revolution]]. During the Cretaceous Terrestrial Revolution, [[conifer]]s, [[cycad]]s and [[fern]]s were selectively replaced by [[angiosperms]] and [[gymnosperms]], becoming the main species dominating the high paleolatitudes. In this Cretaceous greenhouse world, Arctic conifer forests were considered predominantly [[deciduous]], while those that grew on Antarctica contained a significantly greater proportion of [[evergreens]].&lt;ref name="Brentnall_et_al."/&gt;

==Forest diversification==
In the early Cretaceous, approximately 130 million years ago, there was a major diversification of angiosperms that set in motion a large evolutionary change in high paleolatitude forest composition. The diversification of angiosperms is in close connection with pollen and nectar collecting insects. It is thought that the diversification of these insects would have a substantial impact on the rate of angiosperm [[speciation]].&lt;ref name="Crane"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Peter R. Crane |author2=Else Marie Friis |author2link=Else Marie Friis |author3=Kaj Raunsgaard Pedersen |last-author-amp=yes |date=1995 |title=The origin and early diversification of angiosperms |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=374 |issue=6517 |pages=27–33 |bibcode=1995Natur.374...27C |doi=10.1038/374027a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever the mechanism for the diversification, the early Cretaceous angiosperm "takeover" denotes an important transition of the ecosystem. By the end of the Cretaceous, the composition of polar forest regions had diversified by approximately 50-80%.&lt;ref name="Crane"/&gt; This transition from conifers, cycads and ferns to predominantly angiosperms reflects an interesting evolutionary adaptation to the regional polar climate and quite possibly numerous other factors like sea-floor spreading rates, eustatic sea level and high global temperatures.

==Ecological productivity==
Poleward displacement of the temperate zone during the Cretaceous significantly elevated terrestrial forest [[primary productivity]]. At high to mid paleolatitudes, forest productivity was estimated to be twice as much relative to lower paleolatitudes.&lt;ref name="Peralta"/&gt; Terrestrial productivity in the high paleolatitudes is strongly linked to elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations.&lt;ref name="Beerling"/&gt; Results from the experiments on deciduous and evergreen tree growth under various carbon dioxide concentrations show differing impacts.

There are four main factors that contribute to net forest productivity: carbon dioxide concentration, root respiration rates, temperature and [[photosynthesis]]. Carbon dioxide alone tends to decrease leaf and root respiration by lowering the light compensation point of photosynthesis, allowing for a net positive gain in carbon intake during the course of a day.&lt;ref name="Beerling"/&gt; The reduction of root respiration tends to initiate root growth and ultimately results in an improvement in nutrient and water uptake efficiency. When photosynthesis is added to the effects of carbon dioxide, depending on regional temperature, forest productivity is drastically increased. The combination of all four physiological factors results in a significant net increase in forest productivity. According to experimental results, tree species with long lived evergreen foliage tend to benefit the greatest in a carbon dioxide rich environment because of their longer growing season and adaptations like canopy development that allow them to thrive in the temperate polar paleolatitudes of the Cretaceous.&lt;ref name="Beerling"/&gt;

==Fossilized forest==
The composition and structure of high latitude Cretaceous forests was composed primarily of deciduous conifers, ferns, angiosperms and gymnosperms. The most abundant and globally widespread plant taxa were the araucarioid and podocarpoid conifers, extending approximately 80° into both hemispheres and composing more than 90% of the canopy generating evergreen vegetation.&lt;ref name="Peralta"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Falcon"&gt;{{cite journal |author=H. J. Falcon-Lang |author2=D. J. Cantrill |last-author-amp=yes |date=2001 |title=Leaf phenology of some mid-Cretaceous polar forest, Alexander Island, Antarctica |journal=[[Geological Magazine]] |volume=138 |issue=1 |pages=39–52 |doi=10.1017/s0016756801004927|bibcode=2001GeoM..138...39F }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other types of conifers, although abundant in occurrence, were restricted to mid and low latitudes in both hemispheres, confined mainly by regional climates. As global climate evolved, the rise of angiosperms began to put pressure on conifers at higher latitudes by growing taller and ultimately winning the battle for sunlight.&lt;ref name="Peralta"/&gt; The rapid evolution of diverse angiosperm species 25 million years later eventually became the dominant tree type by the mid-Cretaceous. By the Late Cretaceous, a temperate climate in both the Northern and Southern hemisphere was ideal for the rapid diversification and distribution of various angiosperms and to a lesser extent, conifers. Studies on the mid-Cretaceous paleorecord conclude that forest compositions in Northern hemisphere high paleolatitudes were mainly populated by mixed evergreen and deciduous tree types. In contrast, the Southern hemisphere was composed primarily of evergreens.&lt;ref name="Falcon"/&gt;

==Paleoclimate proxies==
A [[paleoclimate]] indicator, also known as a paleoclimate [[climate proxy|proxy]], can reveal important information about what global climate may have been like in the past. Paleoclimate studies on tree growth rings, deep sea cores, ice cores and paleosols are just a few of the many common proxies used to evaluate the major forcings on paleoclimates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=O. Nehza |author2=K. S. Woo |author3=K. C.

==Paleothermometry==
One of the most important and valuable tools for paleothermometry reconstruction is the analysis of [[isotope-ratio mass spectrometry]] data on stable isotopes like those of hydrogen and oxygen. Studies on marine (planktonic/benthic) [[foraminifera]] and bulk carbonate isotope ratios during the mid-Cretaceous suggest a continual warming period from ~100&amp;nbsp;Ma to 66&amp;nbsp;Ma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |display-authors=4 |author=K.

==Dendrochronology on Cretaceous wood==
[[File:Tree.ring.arp.jpg|thumb|right|Fossilized tree growth rings]]
Growth ring measurements during the Cretaceous can also provide details of what the climate might have been like in various geographic locations on Earth. Pattern analysis of tree rings or growth rings from Cretaceous fossil woods are mainly used to make inferences into paleoclimate and forest productivity. One very useful scientific method used for tree growth ring dating is [[dendrochronology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jane E. Francis |date=1986 |title=Growth rings in Cretaceous and Tertiary wood from Antarctica and their palaeoclimatic implications |journal=[[Palaeontology (journal)|Palaeontology]] |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=665–684 |url=http://palaeontology.palass-pubs.org/pdf/Vol%2029/Pages%20665-684.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most of the studies conducted on fossilized wood rely on the idea that processes related to tree growth rates that operated in the past are identical to the processes that operate in the present, [[uniformitarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Anne-Lise Brison |author2=Marc Philippe |author3=Frédéric Thevenard |last-author-amp=yes |date=2001 |title=Are Mesozoic wood growth rings climate induced? |journal=[[Paleobiology (journal)|Paleobiology]] |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=531–538 |jstor=1558086 |doi=10.1666/0094-8373(2001)027&lt;0531:AMWGRC&gt;2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; On this basis, forest productivity can be inferred from the analysis of growth rings in Cretaceous trees. Analysis of forest productivity from the Cretaceous shows that annual tree growth rates at low paleolatitudes were significantly elevated relative to the present. In the polar paleolatitudes, growth rate analysis also indicates elevated productivity, but even more significantly improved relative to today.&lt;ref name="Peralta"/&gt; Dendrochronology of fossilized wood growth rings from high paleolatitudes suggests the presence of greenhouse-like climatic conditions on a global scale during this time period.&lt;ref&gt;Beerling ''et al.'', 1999{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10221">'''Political globalization''' refers to the growth of the worldwide [[political system]], both in size and complexity. That system includes [[Government|national government]]s, their [[governmental organizations|governmental]] and [[intergovernmental organizations]] as well as government-independent elements of [[global civil society]] such as [[international non-governmental organizations]] and [[social movement organization]]s. One of the key aspects of the political globalization is the declining importance of the [[nation-state]] and the rise of other actors on the political scene. The creation and existence of the [[United Nations]] has been called one of the classic examples of political globalization.

Political globalization is one of the three main dimensions of globalization commonly found in academic literature, with the two other being [[economic globalization]] and [[cultural globalization]].&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-146"&gt;{{cite book|author=Salvatore Babones|editor=George Ritzer|chapter=Studying Globalization: Methodological Issues|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKnmvRATtfAC&amp;pg=PA146|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William R. Thompson]] has defined it as "the expansion of a global political system, and its institutions, in which inter-regional transactions (including, but certainly not limited to trade) are managed".&lt;ref name="ModelskiDevezas2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=George Modelski|author2=Tessaleno Devezas|author3=William R.

Moghadam defined it as "an increasing trend toward [[multilateralism]] (in which the [[United Nations]] plays a key role), toward an emerging 'transnational state apparatus,' and toward the emergence of national and [[international nongovernmental organizations]] that act as watchdogs over governments and have increased their activities and influence".&lt;ref name="Moghadam2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Valentine M.

But it also refers to the spread and influence of [[international non-governmental organization]]s, [[social movement organization]]s and transnational advocacy networks operating across borders and constituting a kind of [[global civil society]]."&lt;ref name="AmentaNash2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Colin Crouch|chapter=Democracy and Capitalism in the Wake of the Financial Crisis|editor1=Edwin Amenta|editor2=Kate Nash|editor3=Alan Scott|title=The Wiley-Blackwell Companion to Political Sociology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uz8gk5-a5CUC&amp;pg=PT487|date=2 February 2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-5507-9|page=487}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, [[Gerard Delanty]] and [[Chris Rumford]] define it as "a tension between three processes which interact to produce the complex field of [[global politics]]: global [[geopolitics]], global [[normative culture]] and [[polycentric networks]]."&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-414"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gerard Delanty|author2=Chris Rumford|editor=George Ritzer|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|chapter=Political Globalization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKnmvRATtfAC|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|page=414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
[[Salvatore Babones]] discussing sources used by scholars for studying political globalizations noted the usefulness of [[Europa World Year Book]] for data on diplomatic relationships between countries, publications of [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]] such as ''The Military Balance'' for matters of military, and US government publication ''Patterns of Global Terrorism'' for matters of terrorism.&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-152"&gt;{{cite book|author=Salvatore Babones|editor=George Ritzer|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|chapter=Studying Globalization: Methodological Issues|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKnmvRATtfAC|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political globalization is measured by aggregating and weighting data on the number of embassies and high commissioners in a country, the number of the country's membership in international organization, its participation in the UN peacekeeping missions, and the number of international treaties signed by said country. This measure has been used by [[Axel Dreher]], [[Noel Gaston]], [[Pim Martens]] [[Jeffrey Haynes]] and is available from the [[KOF institute]] at [[ETH Zurich]]&lt;ref name="Haynes2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffrey Haynes|title=Religion and Political Change in the Modern World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8z-DCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT64|date=7 September 2015|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-69699-5|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Welfens2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul J.J.

==Aspects==
[[Dimensions of globalization|Like globalization itself]], political globalization has several dimensions and lends itself to a number of interpretations. It has been discussed in the context of new emancipatory possibilities, as well as in the context of loss of autonomy and fragmentation of the social world.&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-414"/&gt; Political globalization can be seen in changes such as [[democratization]] of the world, creation of the global [[civil society]],&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-426"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gerard Delanty|author2=Chris Rumford|editor=George Ritzer|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|chapter=Political Globalization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKnmvRATtfAC|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|page=426}}&lt;/ref&gt; and moving beyond the centrality of the [[nation-state]], particularly as the sole actor in the field of politics.&lt;ref name="Steger2003-56"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MooneyEvans2007"/&gt; Some of the questions central to the discussion of the political globalization are related to the future of the nation-state, whether its importance is diminishing and what are the causes for those changes; and understanding the emergence of the concept of [[global governance]].&lt;ref name="Steger2003-57"&gt;{{cite book|author=Manfred B. Steger|title=Globalization: A Very Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SgVRoIOhYegC&amp;pg=PA57|date=27 March 2003|publisher=Oxford University Press, UK|isbn=978-0-19-153938-1|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creation and existence of the [[United Nations]] has been called one of the classic examples of political globalization.&lt;ref name="MooneyEvans2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Annabelle Mooney|author2=Betsy Evans|title=Globalization: The Key Concepts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RCV-AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA194|date=12 March 2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-20472-4|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political actions by non-governmental organizations and social movements, concerned about various topics such as [[environmental protection]], is another example.&lt;ref name="MooneyEvans2007"/&gt;

[[David Held]] has proposed that continuing political globalization may lead to the creation of a [[world government]]-like [[cosmopolitan democracy]], though this vision has also been criticized as too idealistic.&lt;ref name="Steger2003-68"&gt;{{cite book|author=Manfred B.

==Political Globalization and Nation State==
There is a heated debate over Political Globalization and Nation State. The question arises whether or not political globalization signifies the decline of the nation-state. Hyper globalists argue that globalization has engulfed today's world in such a way that state boundaries are beginning to lose significance. However, skeptics disregard this as naiveté, believing that the nation-state remains the supreme actor in international relations. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://internationalaffairsbd.com/political-globalization-nation-state/|title=Contemporary Debate on Political Globalization and Nation StateYeg=PA68|author=|first=|last2=|date=2017|publisher=International Affairs, UK|year=|isbn=978-0-19-153938-1|location=|page=68|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Quadratic magnetic rotation''' (also known as '''QMR''' or '''QMR effect''') is a type of [[magneto-optic]] effect, discovered in the mid 1980s by a team of Ukrainian physicists.&lt;ref name="JETP"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kharchenko |first1=N.F. |last2=Bibik |first2=A.V. |last3=Eremenko |first3=V.V. |title=Quadratic magnetic rotation of the polarization plane of light in the antiferromagnet CoF2 |journal=JETP Letters |date=1985 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=553-556 |url=http://www.jetpletters.ac.ru/ps/1439/article_21887.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; QMR, like the [[Faraday effect]], establishes a relationship between the magnetic field and rotation of polarization of the plane of linearly polarized light. In contrast to the [[Faraday effect]], QMR originates from the quadratic proportionality between the angle of the rotation of the plane of polarization and the strength of the magnetic field. Mostly QMR can be observed in the transverse geometry when the vector of the magnetic field strength is perpendicular to the direction of light propagation.

The first evidence of QMR effect was obtained in the [[antiferromagnetic]] crystal of cobalt fluoride in 1985.&lt;ref name=JETP /&gt;

Considerations of the symmetry of the media, light and axial vector of the magnetic field forbid QMR in non-magnetic or magnetically disordered media. Onsager's reciprocal relations generalized for magnetically ordered media eliminate symmetry restrictions for QMR in the media which have lost the center of anti-inversion as an operation of symmetry at an ordering of its magnetic subsystem. Despite the fact that some crystal groups of symmetry are devoid of the center of anti-inversion, they also don’t have QMR because of action of other operators of symmetry. They are eleven groups without the center of anti-inversion 432, 43'm, m3m, 422, 4mm, 4'2m, 4/mmm, 622, 6mm, 6'm2 and 6/mmm. Accordingly, the rest of groups of crystal symmetry where QMR can be observed constitutes 27 [[antiferromagnetic]] and 31 pyromagnetic crystal classes.

QMR is described by fourth-order c-tensor which is antisymmetrical as to the first two indices.

{{Condensed matter physics}}
'''Soft matter''' or '''soft condensed matter''' is a subfield of [[condensed matter]] comprising a variety of physical systems that are deformed or structurally altered by thermal or mechanical stress of the magnitude of thermal fluctuations.  They include [[liquid]]s, [[colloids]], [[polymers]], [[foam]]s, [[gels]], [[granular material]]s, [[liquid crystal]]s, and a number of [[biomaterials|biological materials]].  These materials share an important common feature in that predominant physical behaviors occur at an [[energy]] scale comparable with [[room temperature]] [[thermal energy]].  At these temperatures, [[quantum]] aspects are generally unimportant.
[[Pierre-Gilles de Gennes]], who has been called the "founding father of soft matter,"&lt;ref&gt;Rheology Bulletin Volume 74 Number 2 July 2005, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; received the [[Nobel Prize in physics]] in 1991 for discovering that methods developed for studying [[order parameter|order phenomena]] in simple systems can be generalized to the more complex cases found in soft matter, in particular, to the behaviors of [[liquid crystal]]s and [[polymer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1991/| title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1991|accessdate=January 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distinctive physics ==
Interesting behaviors arise from soft matter in ways that cannot be predicted, or are difficult to predict, directly from its atomic or molecular constituents. Materials termed soft matter exhibit this property due to a shared propensity of these materials to [[Self-organization|self-organize]] into ''[[Mesoscopic scale|mesoscopic]]'' physical structures. By way of contrast, in hard [[condensed matter physics]] it is often possible to predict the overall behavior of a material because the molecules are organized into a crystalline lattice with no changes in the pattern at any mesoscopic scale.

One defining characteristic of soft matter is the [[mesoscopic scale]]
of physical structures. The structures are much larger than the microscopic scale (the arrangement of [[atom]]s and [[molecule]]s), and yet are much smaller than the macroscopic (overall) scale of the material.  The properties and interactions of these mesoscopic structures may determine the macroscopic behavior of the material.&lt;ref name="jones"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=R.A.L.|title=Soft condensed matter|date=2004|publisher=Oxford Univ. Pr.|location=Oxford [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-19-850589-1|pages=1–2|edition=Reprint.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Turbulence|turbulent]] [[vortex|vortices]] that naturally occur within a flowing [[liquid]] are much smaller than the overall quantity of liquid and yet much larger than its individual molecules, and the emergence of these vortices control the overall flowing behavior of the material.  Also, the bubbles that comprise a [[foam]] are mesoscopic because they individually consist of a vast number of molecules, and yet the foam itself consists of a great number of these bubbles, and the overall mechanical stiffness of the foam emerges from the combined interactions of the bubbles. 

A second common feature of soft matter is the importance of thermal fluctuations. Typical bond energies in soft matter structures are of similar scale as thermal energies.  Therefore, the structures are constantly affected by thermal fluctuations, undergoing [[Brownian motion]].&lt;ref name="jones" /&gt;

Finally, a third distinctive feature of soft matter system is self-assembly.  The characteristic complex behavior and hierarchical structures arise spontaneously as the system evolves towards equilibrium.&lt;ref name="jones" /&gt;

== Applications ==

Soft materials are important in a wide range of technological applications.  They may appear as structural and packaging materials, foams and adhesives, detergents and cosmetics, paints, food additives, lubricants and fuel additives, rubber in tires, etc. In addition, a number of biological materials (blood, muscle, milk, yogurt, jello) are classifiable as soft matter. [[Liquid crystal|Liquid crystals]], another category of soft matter, exhibit a responsivity to electric fields that make them very important as materials in display devices (LCDs). In spite of the various forms of these materials, many of their properties have common physicochemical origins, such as a large number of internal degrees of freedom, weak interactions between structural elements, and a delicate balance between [[entropy|entropic]] and [[enthalpy|enthalpic]] contributions to the [[Helmholtz free energy|free energy]]. These properties lead to large [[thermal fluctuations]], a wide variety of forms, sensitivity of equilibrium structures to external conditions, macroscopic [[Hardness|softness]], and metastable states. [[Active fluid|Active liquid crystals]] are another example of soft materials, where the constituent elements in liquid crystals can self propel. Soft matters, such as polymers and lipids have found applications in nanotechnology as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mashaghi S.| author2 = Jadidi T.| author3 = Koenderink G.| author4 = Mashaghi A. | date = 2013| title = Lipid Nanotechnology | url = http://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/14/2/4242 | journal = Int. J. Mol. Sci. | volume = 14| pages = 4242–4282 | doi = 10.3390/ijms14024242 | pmid=23429269 | pmc=3588097 | issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==

The realization that soft matter contains innumerable examples of [[symmetry breaking]], generalized elasticity, and many fluctuating degrees of freedom has re-invigorated classical fields of [[physics]] such as [[fluid]]s (now generalized to non-[[Newtonian fluid|Newtonian]] and structured media) and elasticity (membranes, [[wiktionary:Filament|filaments]], and [[anisotropic]] networks are all important and have common aspects).

An important part of soft condensed matter research is [[biophysics]]. Soft condensed matter biophysics may be diverging into two distinct directions: a [[Protein dynamics|physical chemistry]] approach and a [[Systems biology|complex systems]] approach.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

'''Soft power''' is the ability to attract and [[Co-option|co-opt]], rather than [[coerce]] ([[hard power]]). Soft power is the ability to shape the preferences of others through appeal and attraction. A defining feature of soft power is that it is non-coercive; the currency of soft power is culture, political values, and foreign policies. Recently, the term has also been used in changing and influencing social and public opinion through relatively less transparent channels and [[lobbying]] through powerful political and non-political organizations. In 2012, [[Joseph Nye]] of [[Harvard University]] explained that with soft power, "the best [[propaganda]] is not propaganda", further explaining that during the [[Information Age]], "credibility is the scarcest resource."&lt;ref name=WSJmay2012&gt;{{cite news |last1=Nye |first1=Joseph |title=China's Soft Power Deficit To catch up, its politics must unleash the many talents of its civil society |url=https://online.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304451104577389923098678842 |accessdate=6 December 2014 |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nye coined the term in a 1990 book, ''Bound to Lead: The Changing Nature of American Power''. In this book, he wrote: “when one country gets other countries to want what it wants-might be called co-optive or soft power in contrast with the hard or command power of ordering others to do what it wants.”&lt;ref name="Nye, Joseph 1990"&gt;Nye, Joseph.''Bound to Lead: The Changing Nature of American Power''(New York: Basic Books, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt; He further developed the concept in his 2004 book, ''Soft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics''. The term is now widely used in international affairs by analysts and statesmen. For example, [[US Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert Gates]] spoke of the need to enhance American soft power by "a dramatic increase in spending on the civilian instruments of [[national security]] – [[diplomacy]], [[strategic communications]], foreign assistance, civic action and [[economic reconstruction]] and development."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech |author=Robert M.

According to the Soft Power 30, an annual index published by [[Portland Communications]] and the [[USC Center on Public Diplomacy]] for 2018, the [[United Kingdom]] is the leading sovereign state in soft power. Other leading countries in soft power include [[France]], [[Germany]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Japan]], [[Switzerland]], [[Australia]], [[Sweden]], and the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McClory|first=Jonathan|title=''The Soft Power 30: A Global Ranking of Soft Power, 2017''|url=http://softpower30.portland-communications.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/The-Soft-Power-30-Report-2017-Web-1.pdf|date=18 July 2017|publisher=Portland|accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2016/17 [[Monocle (UK magazine)|''Monocle'']] Soft Power Survey, ranks the United States as the leading country in soft power.

== Description ==
[[File:Soft Power (2004) by Joseph Nye.jpg|thumb|left|Joseph Nye's 2004 book describing the concept of "soft power"]]

[[Joseph Nye]] introduced the concept of "soft power" in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Soft-Power-Means-Success-Politics/dp/1586482254/&lt;/ref&gt; For Nye, power is the ability to influence the behavior of others to get the outcomes you want. There are several ways one can achieve this: you can coerce them with threats; you can induce them with payments; or you can attract and co-opt them to want what you want. This soft power – getting others to want the outcomes you want – co-opts people rather than coerces them.&lt;ref name="Nye, Joseph 1990"/&gt;

It can be contrasted with '[[hard power]]', which is the use of coercion and payment. Soft power can be wielded not just by states but also by all actors in international politics, such as [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] or international institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Nye, ''Soft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics''&lt;/ref&gt; It is also considered the "second face of power" that indirectly allows you to obtain the outcomes you want. A country's soft power, according to Nye, rests on three resources: "its culture (in places where it is attractive to others), its political values (when it lives up to them at home and abroad), and its foreign policies (when others see them as legitimate and having moral authority)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nye|first=Joseph S.|title=The Future of Power|year=2011|publisher=PublicAffairs|location=New York|isbn=9781586488925|page=84|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Future_of_Power.html?id=AH08y1Bi1Y0C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"A country may obtain the outcomes it wants in world politics because other countries – admiring its values, emulating its example, aspiring to its level of prosperity and openness – want to follow it. In this sense, it is also important to set the agenda and attract others in world politics, and not only to force them to change by threatening military force or economic sanctions. This soft power – getting others to want the outcomes that you want – co-opts people rather than coerces them."&lt;ref name="Nye, Joseph 2004"&gt;Nye, Joseph. ''Soft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics'' (New York: Public Affairs, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Soft power resources are the assets that produce attraction which often leads to acquiescence.&lt;ref name="Nye, Joseph 2004"/&gt; Nye asserts that, "Seduction is always more effective than coercion, and many values like democracy, human rights, and individual opportunities are deeply seductive."&lt;ref name="Nye, Joseph 2004 p X"&gt;Nye, Joseph. ''Soft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics'' (New York: Public Affairs, 2004) p. x.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Angelo Codevilla]] observed that an often overlooked essential aspect of soft power is that different parts of populations are attracted or repelled by different things, ideas, images, or prospects.&lt;ref name="Angelo M. Codevilla 2008"&gt;Angelo M. Codevilla, "Political Warfare: A Set of Means for Achieving Political Ends," in Waller, ed., ''Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda and Political Warfare'' (IWP Press, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Soft power is hampered when policies, culture, or values repel others instead of attracting them.

In his book, Nye argues that soft power is a more difficult instrument for governments to wield than hard power for two reasons: many of its critical resources are outside the control of governments, and soft power tends to "work indirectly by shaping the environment for policy, and sometimes takes years to produce the desired outcomes."&lt;ref name="Nye, Joseph 2004 p X"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lord, Carnes 2008. p 59-71"&gt;Lord, Carnes, "Public Diplomacy and Soft Power,"in Waller, ed., ''Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda and Political Warfare'' (IWP Press, 2008.) pp. 59–71.&lt;/ref&gt; The book identifies three broad categories of soft power: "culture", "political values", and "policies."

In ''The Future of Power'' (2011), Nye reiterates that soft power is a descriptive, rather than a normative, concept.&lt;ref name="The Future of Power 81"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nye|first=Joseph S.|title=The Future of Power|year=2011|publisher=PublicAffairs|location=New York|isbn=9781586488925|page=81|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_future_of_power.html?id=jThyCT8d3mYC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, soft power can be wielded for nefarious purposes. "[[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]], [[Josef Stalin|Stalin]], and [[Mao Zedong|Mao]] all possessed a great deal of soft power in the eyes of their acolytes, but that did not make it good. It is not necessarily better to twist minds than to twist arms."&lt;ref name="The Future of Power 81" /&gt; Nye also claims that soft power does not contradict the international relations theory of [[Realism (international relations)|realism]]. "Soft power is not a form of idealism or liberalism. It is simply a form of power, one way of getting desired outcomes."&lt;ref name="The Future of Power 82"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nye|first=Joseph S.|title=The Future of Power|year=2011|publisher=PublicAffairs|location=New York|isbn=9781586488925|page=82|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_future_of_power.html?id=jThyCT8d3mYC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations of the concept ==
{{+rs|date=March 2016}}
Soft power has been criticized as being ineffective by authors such as [[Niall Ferguson]] in the preface to ''Colossus''. [[Neorealism (international relations)|Neorealist]] and other rationalist and neorationalist authors (with the exception of [[Stephen Walt]]) dismiss soft power out of hand as they assert that actors in international relations respond to only two types of incentives: economic incentives and force.

As a concept, it can be difficult to distinguish between soft power from hard power. For example, Janice Bially Mattern argues that [[George W. Bush]]'s use of the phrase "you are either with us or with the terrorists" was in fact an exercise of hard power. Though military and economic force was not used to pressure other states to join its coalition, a kind of force – representational force – was used. This kind of force threatens the identity of its partners, forcing them to comply or risk being labelled as evil. This being the case, soft power is therefore not so soft.&lt;ref&gt;Janice Bially Mattern, "Why 'Soft Power' Isn't So Soft: Representational Force and the Sociolinguistic Construction of Attraction in World Politics," ''Millennium: Journal of International Studies'' 33, no. 3 (2005): 586.&lt;/ref&gt; However, rationalist authors{{Who|date=May 2013}} would merely see this as an 'implied threat', and that direct economic or military sanctions would likely follow from being 'against us'.

== Measurement ==
The first attempt to measure soft power through a composite index was created and published by the [[Institute for Government]] and the media company ''[[Monocle (media company)|Monocle]]'' in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jonathan|last=McClory|title=The new persuaders: an international ranking of soft power|date=2010-12-07|publisher=Institute for Government|url=http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/publications_download.php?id=20|work=Institute for Government website|page=13|accessdate=2011-05-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724053803/http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/publications_download.php?id=20|archivedate=2011-07-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IfG-Monocle Soft Power Index combined a range of statistical metrics and subjective panel scores to measure the soft power resources of 26 countries. The metrics were organized according to a framework of five sub-indices including culture, diplomacy, education, business/innovation, and government. The index is said to measure the soft power resources of countries, and does not translate directly into ability influence. ''Monocle'' has published an annual ''Soft Power Survey'' since then. As of 2016/17, the list is calculated using around 50 factors that indicate the use of soft power, including the number of cultural missions (primarily language schools), [[Olympic medals]], the quality of a country's [[architecture]] and business brands.&lt;ref name="monocle.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://monocle.com/film/affairs/soft-power-survey-2016-17/|title=Soft Power Survey 2016/17|date=2016|publisher=Monocle|accessdate=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Soft Power 30'', which includes a foreword by Joseph Nye, is a ranking of countries' soft power produced and published by the media company ''Portland'' in 2015. The ranking is based on "the quality of a country’s political institutions, the extent of their cultural appeal, the strength of their diplomatic network, the global reputation of their higher education system, the attractiveness of their economic model, and a country’s digital engagement with the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Soft Power 30 - A Global Ranking of Soft Power|url=http://softpower30.portland-communications.com/pdfs/the_soft_power_30.pdf|publisher=Portland|accessdate=17 July 2015|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Softly does it|url=https://www.economist.com/news/britain/21657655-oxbridge-one-direction-and-premier-league-bolster-britains-power-persuade-softly-does-it|accessdate=17 July 2015|work=The Economist|date=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In ‘soft power’ terms, Japan ranks eighth out of 30 countries in U.K. consultancy report|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/07/15/national/soft-power-terms-japan-ranks-eighth-30-u-k-consultancy-gauge/#.Value4u-ra4|accessdate=17 July 2015|work=Japan Times|date=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Elcano Global Presence Report'' scores the [[European Union]] first for soft presence when its member states are excluded and the EU is considered as a whole.&lt;ref name=ElcanoEU /&gt;

Soft power, then, represents the third behavioral way of getting the outcomes you want. Soft power is contrasted with hard power, which has historically been the predominant realist measure of national power, through [[Quantitative property|quantitative]] [[Metric (mathematics)|metrics]] such as [[population]] size, concrete [[military]] assets, or a nation's [[gross domestic product]]. But having such resources does not always produce the desired outcomes, as the United States discovered in the Vietnam War. The extent of attraction can be measured by public opinion polls, by elite interviews, and case studies.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Nye argues that soft power is more than influence, since influence can also rest on the hard power of threats or payments. And soft power is more than just persuasion or the ability to move people by argument, though that is an important part of it. It is also the ability to attract, and attraction often leads to acquiescence.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

In [[international relations]], soft power is generated only in part by what the government does through its policies and public diplomacy. The generation of soft power is also affected in positive (and negative) ways by a host of non-state actors within and outside the country. Those actors affect both the general public and governing elites in other countries, and create an enabling or disabling environment for government policies.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

In some cases, soft power enhances the probability of other elites adopting policies that allow one to achieve preferred outcomes. In other cases, where being seen as friendly to another country is seen as a local political kiss of death, the decline or absence of soft power will prevent a government from obtaining particular goals. But even in such instances, the interactions of civil societies and non-state actors may help to further general milieu goals such as democracy, liberty, and development. Soft power is not the possession of any one country or actor.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The success of soft power heavily depends on the actor's [[reputation]] within the [[international community]], as well as the flow of information between actors. Thus, soft power is often associated with the rise of [[globalization]] and [[Neoliberalism (international relations)|neoliberal international relations theory]]. [[Popular culture]] and [[mass media]] are regularly identified as a source of soft power,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20110625-economic-warfare-on-the-silver-screen-cinema-cannes-festival-2011-hollywood-france|title=Economic warfare on the silver screen|publisher=FRANCE 24|date=28 June 2011|accessdate=2012-01-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119013813/http://www.france24.com/en/20110625-economic-warfare-on-the-silver-screen-cinema-cannes-festival-2011-hollywood-france|archivedate=19 January 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as is the spread of a national language or a particular set of [[norm (sociology)|normative]] structures; a nation with a large amount of soft power and the good will that engenders it inspire others to [[acculturation|acculturate]], avoiding the need for expensive [[hard power]] expenditures.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} More particularly, [[World news|international news]] was found crucial in shaping the image and reputation of foreign countries. The high prominence of the US in international news, for example, has been linked to its soft power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blondheim|first1=Menahem|last2=Segev|first2=Elad|title=Just Spell US Right: America’s News Prominence and Soft Power|journal=Journalism Studies|date=2015|doi=10.1080/1461670X.2015.1114899|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1461670X.2015.1114899|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Positive news coverage was associated with positive international views, while negative news coverage with negative views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Segev|first=Elad|title=International News Online: Global Views with Local Perspectives|year=2016|publisher=Peter Lang|location=New York|isbn=9781433129841|pages=139–153|url=http://www.peterlang.com/index.cfm?event=cmp.ccc.seitenstruktur.detailseiten&amp;seitentyp=produkt&amp;pk=85473&amp;concordeid=312985|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611205324/http://www.peterlang.com/index.cfm?event=cmp.ccc.seitenstruktur.detailseiten&amp;seitentyp=produkt&amp;pk=85473&amp;concordeid=312985|archivedate=2016-06-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because soft power has appeared as an alternative to raw power politics, it is often embraced by ethically-minded scholars and policymakers. But soft power is a descriptive rather than a normative concept. Like any form of power, it can be wielded for good or bad purposes. While soft power can be used with bad intentions and wreak horrible consequences, it differs in terms of means. It is on this dimension that one might construct a normative preference for greater use of soft power.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

== Research ==

Academics have engaged in several debates around soft power. These have included:
* Its usefulness (Giulio Gallarotti, Niall Ferguson, Josef Joffe, Robert Kagan, Ken Waltz, Mearsheimer vs Nye, Katzenstein, Janice Bially Mattern, Jacques Hymans, Alexander Vuving, Jan Mellisen)
* How soft power and hard power interact (Giulio Gallarotti, Joseph Nye)
* Whether soft power can be coercive or [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]], (Janice BIally Mattern, Katzenstein, Duvall &amp; Barnet vs Nye, Vuving)
* How the relationship between [[structure and agency]] work (Hymans vs Nye)
* Whether soft balancing is occurring (Wohlforth &amp; Brooks vs Walt ''et al''.)
* Soft power and normative power in Europe (Ian Manners, A Ciambra, Thomas Diez, A Hyde Pryce, Richard Whitman)
* How [[civil resistance]] (i.e., non-violent forms of resistance) can often involve certain uses of soft power, but remains a distinct concept (Adam Roberts, Timothy Garton Ash)
* The ways through which states' attempts at soft power can backfire, leading to instances of 'soft disempowerment' (Paul Michael Brannagan and Richard Giulianotti)

One study finds that a state's soft power has a measurable effect on its exports. Countries that are admired for their positive global influence export more, holding other things constant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Soft power raises exports|url = http://www.voxeu.org/article/soft-power-raises-exports|website = VoxEU.org|accessdate = 2015-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

=== Throughout the world ===
The Soviet Union competed with the U.S. for influence throughout the [[Cold War]]. The Soviets were engaged in a broad campaign to convince the world of the attractiveness of its Communist system. In 1945, the Soviet Union was very effective in attracting many in Europe from its resistance to Hitler, and in colonized areas around the world because of its opposition to European imperialism.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Nye, Joseph. ''Soft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics'' (New York: Public Affairs, 2004). Ch 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviets also employed a substantially large [[public diplomacy]] program that included: promoting their high culture, broadcasting, disseminating disinformation about the West, and sponsoring nuclear protests, peace movements, and youth organizations. Despite all of this, the Soviets' closed system and lack of popular culture impeded the ability of the Soviet Union to compete with the U.S. in terms of soft power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Soviet soft power in Poland : culture and the making of Stalin's new empire, 1943-1957 |last=Babiracki |first=Patryk |date=2015 |publisher=The University of North Carolina Press |isbn=9781469623085 |location=Chapel Hill |oclc=911173017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of [[Autocracy|non-democratic governments]] have attempted to use [[Human migration|migration]] as an instrument of soft power: [[Egypt]] under the rule of [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] trained and dispatched thousands of teachers across the [[Arab world]] in an effort to spread ideas of [[Anti-imperialism|anti-colonialism]] and [[anti-Zionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Tsourapas |first=Gerasimos |date= |title=Authoritarian emigration states: Soft power and cross-border mobility in the Middle East |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0192512118759902 |journal=International Political Science Review |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=400-416}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Cuba]], the [[Fidel Castro]] regime's [[Cuban medical internationalism|medical internationalism]] programme has dispatched thousands of medical professionals abroad for cultural diplomacy purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Cuban medical internationalism : origins, evolution, and goals |last=Kirk |first=John M. |date=2009 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |last2=Erisman |first2=H.

After [[Pope John Paul II]] visited [[Poland]] in 1979, some political commentators said his visit influenced events against Poland's communist government, the [[Soviet Union]], and ultimately [[communism]], which promoted [[atheism]].&lt;ref name="Angelo M. Codevilla 2008" /&gt;

{{quote|"The Pope won that struggle by transcending politics. His was what Joseph Nye calls "soft power" – the power of attraction and repulsion. He began with an enormous advantage, and exploited it to the utmost: He headed the one institution that stood for the polar opposite of the Communist way of life that the Polish people hated. He was a Pole, but beyond the regime’s reach. By identifying with him, Poles would have the chance to cleanse themselves of the compromises they had to make to live under the regime. And so they came to him by the millions. They listened. He told them to be good, not to compromise themselves, to stick by one another, to be fearless, and that God is the only source of goodness, the only standard of conduct. "Be not afraid," he said. Millions shouted in response, "We want God! We want God! We want God!" The regime cowered. Had the Pope chosen to turn his soft power into the hard variety, the regime might have been drowned in blood. Instead, the Pope simply led the Polish people to desert their rulers by affirming solidarity with one another. The Communists managed to hold on as despots a decade longer. But as political leaders, they were finished." &lt;ref&gt;Angelo M. Codevilla, "Political Warfare: A Set of Means for Achieving Political Ends," in Waller, ed., ''Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda and Political Warfare'' (IWP Press, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Besides the Pope's visit, American-government broadcasting and propaganda into Soviet-occupied Europe, particularly Poland, contributed to the rise of the [[Solidarity]] movement and to the collapse of the Soviet-backed governments there and in the rest of the [[Warsaw Pact]] alliance.&lt;ref name="Lord, Carnes 2008. p 59-71"/&gt;

The United States and Europe have consistently been sources of influence and soft power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Joseph Nye|title=Europe’s Soft Power|url=http://www.theglobalist.com/europes-soft-power/|publisher=The Globalist|accessdate=30 July 2015|date=3 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[European culture]]'s art, literature, music, design, fashion, and even food have been global magnets for some time.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Europe and the U.S. have often claimed to support [[human rights]] and [[international law]] throughout the world. Unlike the U.S., Europeans' love of football enhances their soft power globally, whereas the primary sports of the U.S. such as American football and baseball are largely unpopular on the world stage. In 2012, the [[European Union]] was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] "for over six decades [it has] contributed to the advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy and human rights in Europe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nobel Peace Prize 2012 - European Union (EU)|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2012/eu-facts.html|publisher=Nobel Prize|accessdate=24 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=From war to peace: European Union accepts Nobel Prize|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/10/world/nobel-peace-prize/|accessdate=24 December 2013|newspaper=CNN|date=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. has the largest diplomatic network in the world,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://globaldiplomacyindex.lowyinstitute.org/country_rank.html|title=Global Diplomacy Index – Country Rank|last=|first=|date=|website=Lowy Institute|language=|access-date=2018-04-01|ref=Lowy2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the largest number of foreign journalists based in the country,&lt;ref name="Monocle2012"&gt;{{cite web|title=Soft Power Survey 2012|url=http://monocle.com/film/affairs/soft-power-survey-2012/|publisher=Monocle|accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the most popular destination for international students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Study in the USA|url=http://www.internationalstudent.com/study_usa/|publisher=International Student|accessdate=5 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cinema of the United States|American films]], among other influences, have contributed to the [[Americanization]] of other cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fluck|first1=Prof. Dr. Winfried|title=The Americanization of Modern Culture: A Cultural History of the Popular Media*|url=http://www.jfki.fu-berlin.de/en/v/publications_fluck/2000/Romance_with_America/Fluck__Winfried_-_The_Americanization_of_Modern_Culture.pdf|publisher=John F.

Asia and more recently China have been working to use the potential soft power assets that are present in the admiration of their ancient cultures, arts, fashion and cuisine. China is presenting itself as a defender of national sovereignty,&lt;ref&gt;Friedberg, Aaron L. ''A Contest for Supremacy: China, America and the Struggle for Mastery in Asia'', New York: Norton Publishing, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; which became an issue after the [[NATO]] air campaign to oust Colonel Muammar Gaddafi and NATO's support of the rebels in Libya.&lt;ref&gt;Felgenhauer, Pavel. "The Fall of Gaddafi Angers Many In Moscow". ''Eurasia Daily Monitor'' Volume: 8 Issue: 164. September 8, 2011. http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=38374&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese are also competing with the United States to gain influence throughout the South Pacific, however some commentators have said their recent assertiveness in this region has created an appeal for nations in this region to align with the United States thus increasing U.S. soft power in this area.&lt;ref&gt;Friedberg, Aaron L. ''A Contest for Supremacy: China, America and the Struggle for Mastery in Asia'', New York: Norton Publishing, 2011. p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

Soft power extends beyond the operations of government, to the activities of the private sector and to society and culture at large.&lt;ref&gt;Lord, Carnes, "Public Diplomacy and Soft Power,"in Waller, ed., ''Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda and Political Warfare'' (IWP Press, 2008) p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Soft power has gained more influence because it addresses the underlying dispositions of the people who have increasingly become more active in their governments.&lt;ref name="Angelo M. Codevilla 2008" /&gt; This is true even in authoritarian countries where people and institutions are increasingly able to shape the debate.&lt;ref&gt;Defense Science Board, Report of the Defense Science Board Task Force on Strategic Communication (Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, September 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[information age]] has also led to the rise of soft power resources for non-state actors, Primarily, through the use of global media, and to a greater extent the internet using tools such as the [[World Wide Web]], non-state actors have been able to increase their soft power and put pressure on governments that can ultimately affect policy outcomes. Instead of front organizations, non-state actors can create cyber advocacy organizations &lt;ref&gt;Steele, Robert D. ''The New Craft of Intelligence: Personal, Public, &amp; Political: Citizen's Action Handbook for Fighting Terrorism, Genocide, Disease, Toxic Bombs and Corruption''. Oakton, Virginia: OSS International Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; to recruit members and project their voice on the global stage.

=== China ===
{{Main|Soft power of China}}
China's traditional culture has been a source of attraction, building on which it has created several hundred [[Confucius Institute]]s around the world to teach its language and culture. The enrollment of foreign students in China has increased from 36,000 a decade before to at least 240,000 in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph S. Nye Jr. Why China Is Weak on Soft Power; Jan, 17, 2012 https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/18/opinion/why-china-is-weak-on-soft-power.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt; China's [[Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank]] has attracted many western countries to join.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=With New Bank, China Shows U.S. It's Got Soft Power|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2015/03/23/with-new-bank-china-shows-u-s-its-got-soft-power/print/|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=31 July 2015|date=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, China had the second largest diplomatic network in the world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A spring 2014 Global Attitudes survey from Pew Research Center states China receives mostly positive reviews in the sub-Saharan African nations polled, although South Africans are closely divided (45% favorable, 40% unfavorable).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Opposition to U.S. Surveillance and Drones, but Limited Harm to America’s Image|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/07/14/chapter-2-chinas-image/|publisher=Pew Research Center|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  China's increasing soft power can be explained by looking at China's economic growth and regarding economic engagement with many African countries. China's expansion of trade and investment on the African continent and the spread of Chinese-led infrastructure projects gives positive impressions of China to people in Africa. China's economic engagement in African countries is considered as much more pragmatic and in consistency with the priorities of many African countries. Moreover, China's increasing role as a global superpower seems appealing and this drives a desire to tie African economies more closely to China's economy.

China has made a systematic effort to expand and give greater profile to its soft-power policies in Africa ever since the first Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in 2000. The commitments of China's soft power ranges from health, humanitarian assistance to academic, professional and cultural exchange. China's assistance to Africa, however, is not near the U.S. assistance in Africa.

Cultural exchange between China and Africa can be a representative example of how China has been spreading its soft power.
In 2005, the first Confucius Institute was established in Africa. The institute is funded by the Chinese government and it provides Chinese language and cultural programming to the public. There are 19 institutes today in Africa and China has planned to spend 20 million renminbi for education projects in South Africa, including the teaching of Mandarin in 50 local high schools.

Furthermore, there is an increasing support for cultural visitors programs which gained momentum in 2004 when the African Cultural Visitors Program was established. There is a rising number of African entrepreneurs who choose to move to China and there are also diaspora communities in many Chinese cities that have been found.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer G. Cooke. China's soft power in Africa; {{cite web |url=http://www.relooney.fatcow.com/SI_Oil-Politics/Africa-China_54.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324122951/http://www.relooney.fatcow.com/SI_Oil-Politics/Africa-China_54.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of Africa, Chinese soft power extends to countries like [[Barbados]]. Barbadian Prime Minister [[David Thompson (Barbadian politician)|David Thompson]] expressed admiration for the Chinese economic model and sought to emulate the way Chinese state controlled banks guided development.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wikileaks.org/cable/2009/03/09BRIDGETOWN144.html# Wikileaks 09Barbados144]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== France ===
[[France]] has long exerted a great amount of soft power. The country and [[French culture|its culture]] have for centuries been admired in many parts of the world; so much so that [[Thomas Jefferson]] is famously quoted as saying "Every man has two countries, his own and France."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://france.usembassy.gov/us-france-americans.html|title=Americans in France|publisher=[[U.S. Embassy Paris]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418070413/http://france.usembassy.gov/us-france-americans.html|archivedate=2015-04-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The very term "culture" comes from France.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/39149-french-culture.html French Culture: Customs &amp; Traditions], [[LiveScience]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, France had the third largest diplomatic network in the world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

France was a focal point of the [[Age of Enlightenment]];&lt;ref&gt;"Enlightenment thought culminates historically in the political upheaval of the French Revolution, in which the traditional hierarchical political and social orders (the French monarchy, the privileges of the French nobility, the political power and authority of the Catholic Church) were violently destroyed and replaced by a political and social order informed by the Enlightenment ideals of freedom and equality for all, founded, ostensibly, upon principles of human reason." [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/enlightenment/ Enlightenment], Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; its attachment to the ideals of [[liberty]], [[Social equality|equality]], [[Toleration|tolerance]] and [[reason]] was notably embodied in the writing and publishing of the ''[[Encyclopédie]]''. The [[French Revolution]] was one of the most significant events in European and world history. France has since then been instrumental in spreading [[Republicanism in France|Republican ideals]]. The [[Napoleonic Code]], which influenced much of the rest of Europe and beyond, is regarded as one of the most important law document of the [[modern era]].&lt;ref name="Robert B. Holtman 1981"&gt;Robert B. Holtman, ''The Napoleonic Revolution'' (Baton Rouge: [[Louisiana State University Press]], 1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[French language]] has for centuries been an important diplomatic language. For example, French has to be used  &amp;ndash; on par with English &amp;ndash; for all documents issued by the [[United Nations Treaty Series]], ensuring that all UN treaties are equally valid in their English and French versions.&lt;ref&gt;"Treaties registered with the United Nations Treaty Series are always translated into French and English. Documents are always provided in French and English. This city’s Geneva Conventions, written in equally authentic French and English versions, laid part of the groundwork for the international system." [https://www.economist.com/blogs/johnson/2013/04/languages-diplomacy Languages of diplomacy - Towards a fairer distribution], [[The Economist]]&lt;/ref&gt;

France has also followed for decades a very active diplomatic and cultural policy. The ''[[Alliance Française]]'', whose aim is to promote the French language and French culture, was created as early as [[1883]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alliancefr.org/en/who-are-we |title=Who are we? |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120094935/http://www.alliancefr.org/en/who-are-we |archive-date=2015-11-20 |publisher=[[Alliance Française]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Monocle (media company)|Monocle]]'''s 2015 "Soft Power 30" report, France was ranked first in the "engagement" criteria, which is intended to measure "the reach of states’ diplomatic network and their commitment to major challenges like development and the environment." ''Monocle'' further noted that "In terms of influential reach, France is the best networked state in the world and is member of more multi-lateral organisations than any other country." Overall, France ranked fourth in that study.&lt;ref name="francemonocle"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comres.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Report_Final-published.pdf |title=The Soft Power 30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120204008/http://www.comres.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Report_Final-published.pdf |archive-date=2015-11-20 |publisher=[[Monocle (media company)|Monocle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

France's [[laïcité]], [[secularism]], policy has inspired some countries over time. For instance, France was [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Atatürk]]'s main role model for [[Westernization]] as part of the major reform efforts that he spearheaded when he was President of [[Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;Soner Cagaptay, [https://books.google.com/books?id=V8vQAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA45&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;dq=french+laicit%C3%A9+turkey&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Gz_UaAWfWN&amp;sig=NAEle23Sl5HmUbOS2mjT-NnAl0U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiA45fHrbXJAhXH8RQKHfvKAIwQ6AEIWzAF#v=onepage&amp;q=french%20laicit%C3%A9%20turkey&amp;f=false The Rise of Turkey: The Twenty-First Century's First Muslim Power], pp. 44-45&lt;/ref&gt;

France, and in particular [[Paris]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sonia-gil/myths-and-truths-romantic-cities_b_4777532.html Myths and Truths: The Most Romantic Cities Around the World], [[The Huffington Post]], 2014&lt;/ref&gt; has long been considered one of the most romantic places to be. France was in 2014 [[Tourism in France|the most visited country in the world]].&lt;ref name="WTO Tourism Highlights 2015 Edition"&gt;{{cite press release |title= UNWTO Tourism Highlights 2015 Edition |publisher=UNWTO |date=25 June 2015 |url=http://www.e-unwto.org/doi/pdf/10.18111/9789284416899 |accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===
The annual soft power rankings by ''Monocle'' magazine and the Institute for Government ranks 30 countries which “best attract favor from other nations through culture, sport, cuisine, design, diplomacy and beyond.”
''Monocle'' magazine said: “[[Angela Merkel|Merkel]] may be painted as a stern taskmaster but it seems she has a softer side, or the country she leads does.”
It said Germany’s rise as a soft power should not come as a surprise.
“The country is traditionally excellent at pursuing its ideas, values and aims using diplomatic, cultural and economic tools," it said. “By quietly doing the simple things well it is a country that has become a global power and the rest of us can feel comfortable with that.”
Germans had been understandably wary about depicting a dominant image abroad, the magazine added, but it said that the country’s rise should not make everyone else feel uncomfortable.&lt;ref&gt;Germany tops world 'soft power' rankings; http://www.thelocal.de/20131121/germany-number-one-for-soft-power&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gerhard Schröder: 'Germany Can Only Lead Europe the Way Porcupines Mate'|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/interview-former-german-chancellor-gerhard-schroeder-on-foreign-policy-a-891839.html|publisher=Spiegel Online International|accessdate=30 July 2015|date=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obama sets off on farewell trip to Europe in shadow of president-elect|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/14/barack-obama-faces-awkward-task-on-sad-farewell-visit-to-europe|accessdate=14 November 2016|work=Reuters|date=14 November 2016|quote=As the Americans see it, Merkel – and certainly not the vainglorious European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker – runs the EU.

=== Italy ===
The famous elements of Italian soft culture are its art, music, fashion, and iconic food. Italy was the birthplace of [[opera]],&lt;ref&gt;Kimbell, David R. B. [https://books.google.com/books?id=C37Gq2GagZIC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Italian Opera.''] Cambridge University Press, 1994. p. 1. Web. 22 Jul. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and for generations the language of opera was [[Italian language|Italian]], irrespective of the nationality of the composer. Popular tastes in drama in Italy have long favored comedy; the improvisational style known as the ''[[Commedia dell'arte]]'' began in Italy in the mid-16th century&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=it |url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/commedia-dell-arte/ |title=Commedia dell'arte |work=Treccani, il portale del sapere |access-date=24 Jul 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is still performed today. Before being exported to France, the famous [[Ballet]] dance genre also originated in Italy.
The country boasts several world-famous cities. [[Rome]] was the ancient capital of the Roman Empire and seat of the [[Pope]] of the [[Catholic Church]]. [[Florence]] was the heart of the [[Renaissance]], a period of great achievements in [[the arts]] that ended the Dark Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Zirpolo, Lilian H. [https://books.google.com/books?id=QPqWxHwdMNAC&amp;pg=PA154&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The A to Z of Renaissance Art.''] Scarecrow Press, 2009. pp. 154-156. Web. 16 Jul. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Other important cities include [[Turin]], which used to be the capital of Italy, and is now one of the world's great centers of automobile engineering.

{{Main article|Cool Japan}}
"'''Cool Japan'''" is a concept coined in 2002 as an expression of [[Culture of Japan|Japan’s popular culture]]. The concept has been adopted by the Japanese government as well as trade bodies seeking to exploit the commercial capital of the country’s culture industry.&lt;ref&gt;Japan's Soft Power-Squaring the Cool, June 14, 2014; https://www.economist.com/blogs/banyan/2014/06/japans-soft-power&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cool Japan Illustrated, http://www.cool-jp.com/index.php&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as a form of soft power, "the ability to indirectly influence behavior or interests through cultural or ideological means."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Christine R.

In a 2002 article in the journal ''Foreign Policy'' titled “Japan’s Gross National Cool”, Douglas McGray wrote of Japan “reinventing superpower” as its cultural influence expanded internationally despite the economic and political problems of the “lost decade.” Surveying youth culture and the role of J-pop, manga, anime, fashion, film, consumer electronics, architecture, and cuisine, McGray highlighted Japan’s considerable soft power, posing the question of what message the country might project. He also argued that Japan’s recession may even have boosted its national cool, due to the partial discrediting of erstwhile rigid social hierarchies and big-business career paths.&lt;ref name="McGray"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.douglasmcgray.com/cool-japan.html |title=Japan's Gross National Cool |author=McGray, Douglas |publisher=[[Foreign Policy]] |date=1 May 2002 |accessdate=11 September 2012}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2002/05/01/japans_gross_national_cool |title=Japan's Gross National Cool |url-access=subscription |author=McGray, Douglas |publisher=[[Foreign Policy]] |date=1 May 2002 |accessdate=18 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Japan had the fifth largest diplomatic network in the world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

"'''Hallyu'''", also known as the "'''Korean Wave'''", is a [[neologism]] referring to the spread of South Korean culture since the late 1990s. According to a ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' reporter, the spread of South Korean entertainment has led to higher sales of other goods and services such as food, clothing, and [[Korean language]] classes.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/30/AR2006083002985.html|work=The Washington Post|title=Japanese Women Catch the 'Korean Wave'|first=Anthony|last=Faiola|date=August 31, 2006|accessdate=May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides increasing the amount of exports, the ''Korean Wave'' is used by the government as a soft power tool to engage with the masses of young people all over the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=K-pop: Soft Power for the Global Cool|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/linda-constant/kpop-soft-power-for-the-g_b_1088238.html|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=17 February 2013|first=Linda|last=Constant|date=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to try reduce [[anti-Korean sentiment]].&lt;ref name="antikoreansentiment"&gt;{{cite news|title=Korea to turn hallyu into industry|url=http://nwww.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20120417001073|work=[[The Korea Herald]]|accessdate=17 February 2013|quote=To prevent anti-Korean sentiment, the government will offer incentives for production companies or broadcasters planning to jointly produce movies or dramas with Chinese companies.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the [[BBC]]'s country rating poll revealed that public opinion of [[South Korea]] has been improving every year since the first rating poll for the country was conducted in 2009. In several countries such as [[Russia]], [[India]], [[China]] and [[France]], public opinion of South Korea turned from slightly negative to generally positive. The report cited culture and tradition as among the most important factors contributing to positive perceptions of South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2012 BBC Country Ratings|url=http://www.globescan.com/images/images/pressreleases/bbc2012_country_ratings/2012_bbc_country%20rating%20final%20080512.pdf|publisher=Globescan/BBC World Service|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This comes alongside a rapid growth in the total value of cultural exports which rose to US$4.2 billion in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oliver|first=Christian|title=South Korea's K-pop takes off in the west|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/ddf11662-53c7-11e1-9eac-00144feabdc0.html|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First driven by the spread of [[Korean drama]]s televised across [[East Asia|East]], [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]] during its initial stages, the ''Korean Wave'' evolved from a regional development into a global phenomenon due to the proliferation of Korean pop ([[K-pop]]) music videos on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Yoon, Lina.

=== United States ===
The [[United States]] has long had a great deal of soft power. Examples include [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[four freedoms]] in Europe at the end of [[World War II]], young people behind the [[Iron Curtain]] listening to the government's foreign propaganda arm [[Radio Free Europe]], Chinese students symbolizing their protests in [[Tiananmen Square]] by creating a replica of the [[Statue of Liberty]] that they called "Goddess of Democracy", newly liberated Afghans in 2001 asking for a copy of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] and young Iranians today surreptitiously watching banned American videos and satellite television broadcasts in the privacy of their homes.&lt;ref name="Nye, Joseph 2004 p X" /&gt; America's early commitment to religious toleration, for example, was a powerful element of its overall appeal to potential immigrants; and American aid in the reconstruction of Europe after World War II was a propaganda victory to show off the prosperity and the generosity of the people of the United States.

Studies of American broadcasting into the [[Soviet bloc]], and testimonials from Czech President [[Václav Havel]], Polish President [[Lech Wałęsa]], and Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]] support that soft power efforts of the United States and its allies during the Cold War were ultimately successful in creating the favorable conditions that led to the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Carnes Lord, "Public Diplomacy and Soft Power," in Waller, ed., ''Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda and Political Warfare'' (IWP Press, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|"Satellite TV is actively promoting American soft power in the Arab world in ways that the United States has been incapable of doing. The launch of the Arabic-language [[Alhurra]] satellite channel in early 2004 to provide news and entertainment in ways more beneficial to the U.S., marked an important turning point in U.S. public diplomacy development. Though it calls itself the largest Arabic-language news organization in the world, the Virginia-based Alhurra lacks the cachet and brand recognition of Al Jazeera, but its balanced presentation of news has earned it a small but significant viewership. Controversial innovations in radio broadcasting that target young mass audiences through a mix of light news and mild American popular music – [[Radio Sawa]] in [[Arabic]] and [[Radio Farda]] in [[Persian language|Persian]] – have captured a substantial market share in their target regions."&lt;ref name="Lord, Carnes 2008. p 59-71" /&gt;

'''Stephen Thomas''' is a professor at the [[University of Greenwich]] Business School, working in the area of [[energy policy]]. Before moving to the University of Greenwich in 2001, Thomas worked for twenty-two years at the [[University of Sussex]].

==Research work==
Stephen Thomas is professor at the [[University of Greenwich]] Business School, and has been a researcher in the area of [[energy policy]] for over twenty-five years. He specialises in the economics and policy of [[nuclear power]], liberalisation and privatisation of the [[electricity]] and gas industries, and trade policy on network energy industries.  Professor Thomas serves on the editorial boards several periodicals including ''Energy Policy, Utilities Policy, Energy and Environment'', and ''International Journal of Regulation and Governance''.&lt;ref name=tom&gt;[http://www.gre.ac.uk/schools/business/departments/ibe/Professor-Steve-Thomas Professor Steve Thomas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080123122124/http://www.gre.ac.uk/schools/business/departments/ibe/Professor-Steve-Thomas |date=2008-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before moving to the University of Greenwich in 2001, Thomas worked for twenty-two years at the [[Science Policy Research Unit]] (SPRU) at the [[University of Sussex]].

==Views on nuclear power==
Thomas has been critical of the idea that the nuclear power industry is undergoing a "[[nuclear renaissance]]". In May 2009 he said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
We've been waiting in vain on a 'Nuclear Renaissance' in Europe since the early 1990s. Even before the recent collapse in energy prices and the financial downturn, it was clear that all of the talk of a new resurgence in the prospects for nuclear reactors was just that: talk.&lt;ref name=to&gt;[http://www.psr.org/safe-energy/the-myth-of-the-european.html The Myth of the European "Nuclear Renaissance"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090623200954/http://www.psr.org/safe-energy/the-myth-of-the-european.html |date=2009-06-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In terms of the nuclear power industry in the USA, Thomas said, in May 2009:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
U.S. efforts to revive nuclear ordering, begun in 2002, were originally expected to get a new plant on-line by 2010. Even if there are no further delays, the earliest a new plant could be on-line is now looking closer to 2020. In the meantime, the nuclear industry has upped its demands for taxpayer-backed loan guarantees to build demonstration plants from about $5 billion to more than $100 billion. The prospect that these demonstration plants would lead to unsubsidized ordering now looks fanciful.&lt;ref name=to/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Regarding the UK nuclear power industry, on 20 November 2014, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"If someone wants to make losses on [building nuclear] plants in Britain, well, good luck to them."  The UK "lost its nuclear industry probably 35 years ago, and I'm not sure we should be too worried about that – it's not an industry that's done well for us... The last reactors we exported were more than 50 years ago. ... We should be focusing on energy efficiency and renewable energy, which is becoming cheaper while nuclear is becoming more expensive." 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Tree box filters'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ianrpubs.unl.edu/epublic/live/ec701/build/ec701.pdf| "Stormwater Terminology" 2011. University of Nebraska Press Extension Curricular&lt;/ref&gt; are typically filtration systems installed under a street or sidewalk which have trees planted in them.  The systems collect [[stormwater]] runoff through methods such as permeable pavers or curb cuts.  The runoff is then filtered by soil, microbes and vegetation before either being utilized by the tree or discharged into a [[storm drain]] system.

==Benefits==

Tree box filters have the potential to improve the quality and health of street trees by providing larger areas for roots to stabilize the tree and more availability of water and nutrients. Additionally, the filters can delay the [[peak flow]] and improve the [[water quality]] of [[water]] entering a storm drain system. It is a practical management strategy for stormwater issues in urban settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Geronimo|first=Franz Kevin F.|last2=Maniquiz-Redillas|first2=Marla C.|last3=Kim|first3=Lee-Hyung|date=2013-05-01|title=Treatment of parking lot runoff by a tree box filter|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19443994.2013.781099|journal=Desalination and Water Treatment|volume=51|issue=19-21|pages=4044–4049|doi=10.1080/19443994.2013.781099|issn=1944-3994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Ranking !! Summary
|-
| Individual UCI World Ranking || This ranking system is calculated on a 52 week rolling basis, rankings are updated each Monday. The ranking at the end of the calendar year will be utilised to award an annual winner. Unlike previous ranking systems the UCI World Classification will include &lt;u&gt;all&lt;/u&gt; male riders from the World Tour down to U23 riders. Points will be awarded on all races from World Tour level down to 1.2 and 2.2 races.
|-
| UCI World Ranking by nations || This is based on the world ranking with the best eight riders from each country contributing towards their nation's overall score.
|-
|UCI WorldTour Rankings || This is the UCI WorldTour ranking of riders, teams and nations taking part in the events of the UCI WorldTour. Only riders being part of a UCI WorldTeam obtain points in UCI WorldTour races.
|-
| Continental Ranking || There will be subsets of rankings which are made up from points scored in non-World Tour races (i.e, UCI Europe Tour, UCI Asia Tour etc) for individuals, teams and nations. This will therefore allow one rider to appear in more than one ranking, for example a rider who won Strade Bianchi and a stage in the Tour of California would be part of the Europe Tour and America Tour rankings.
