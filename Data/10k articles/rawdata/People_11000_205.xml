'''Anatoly Anatolyevich Durov''' (sometimes spelled ''Durow'') ({{lang-ru| Анато́лий Анато́льевич Ду́ров}}) (1887&amp;ndash;1928) was a renowned 20th century [[animal training|animal trainer]].  He was a member of the Durov family of performers who raised the quality and prestige of the Russian circus.

==Background==
Anatoly Anatolyevich's great-grandmother, [[Nadezhda Durova]], was the first female officer in the Russian Army, who became a decorated soldier in the Russian cavalry during the [[Napoleonic wars]]. His mother, née Tereza Stadler, was a talented circus horse rider of [[German diaspora|German descent]] and owned the [[Bavaria]]n Circus] Long and successful tours led her to make Russia her home. His father, Anatoly Durov, was born to an old noble family and broke with it to join a traveling troupe. Anatoly (Jr.) was a good acrobat, a magician, and a monologue reciter. Anatoly (Sr.) and [[Vladimir Durov]] were the first of the Durov clan to gain fame as circus entertainers.

==Career==
Anatoly (Jr.) made his circus debut in 1914 in the Nikitin brothers' circus in the city of [[Ryazan]]. His real fame came in the years following the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]]. The younger Anatoly Durov performed with a large and varied group of animals. His performance commentary was always biting and topical. He toured abroad in 1921. 

In [[Serbia]] he performed in the city of [[Subotica]] in the variety show Alhambra; in the city of [[Zagreb]] in the Music Hall; in the city of [[Sarajevo]] in the Winter Garden. In November 1921, he signed a contract for performances in the cities of [[Graz]] and [[Vienna]], [[Austria]] with the international circus Orpheus for 500,000 kronor plus travel expenses. 

In 1922-1923 he toured throughout the [[Italy]], performing in [[Rome]], [[Milan]], [[Padua]] ([[Padova]]), [[Genoa]] (Genova), [[Bari]], [[Venice]], [[Bologna]], [[Treviso]], [[Adria]] (Atria), and other places. 

At the request of Queen [[Elena of Italy]], Anatoly (Jr.)  gave a private performance at the royal villa. His performing dog ''Petit'' lived in the queen's apartment for three days.  Queen Elena granted Anatoly Durov Jun. a golden cigarette-case and a letter of thanks.

After his tours across [[Europe]] and the [[United States]], Anatoly Durov returned to [[Soviet Union|Soviet Russia]] and founded an entertainment program that gained international recognition. In 1926 he settled in the city of [[Taganrog]] on Shevchenko street 111, where he founded ''The Taganrog Animal Theater of Anatoly Durov''.

Anatoly Anatolyevich Durov died in 1928 in a hunting accident near [[Izhevsk]]. Anatoly Durov was interred at [[Taganrog Old Cemetery]].

His nephews, Vladimir Grigorievich Durov (1909-1972) and Yury Vladimirovich Durov (1909-1971) continued in his footsteps. Both became [[People's Artist of the USSR|People's Artists of the USSR]]. Currently the Durov Theater in [[Moscow]] is run by Tereza Durova (b. September 5, 1926), a niece.

== Biography ==
In the years leading up to the [[Ukrainian independence]] in 1991 Parubiy was an independence activist and was arrested for organizing an unsanctioned [[Demonstration (protest)|rally]] in 1989.&lt;ref name=liga/&gt; In 1991 he founded the [[Social-National Party of Ukraine]] together with [[Oleh Tyahnybok]];&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2014/02/12/who-are-the-protesters-in-ukraine/ Who are the protesters in Ukraine?]". ''The Washington Post.'' February 12, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; the party combined [[radical nationalism]] and some [[neo-Nazi]] features (by its name and the "[[Wolfsangel]]"-like sign).&lt;ref name=liga/&gt;&lt;ref name=leftFR2004&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/6327298/Interview_with_Reuters_re_Svoboda_the_OUN-B_and_other_Far_Right_Organizations_in_Ukraine_March_4_2014_FullText Ivan Katchanovski interview with Reuters Concerning Svoboda, the OUN-B, and other Far Right Organizations in Ukraine], [[Academia.edu]] (March 4, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aca&gt;{{cite journal|last=Umland|first=Andreas|author2=Anton Shekhovtsov|title=Ultraright Party Politics in Post-Soviet Ukraine and the Puzzle of the Electoral Marginalism of Ukrainian Ultranationalists in 1994–2009|journal=Russian Politics and Law|date=September–October 2013|volume=51|issue=5|url=https://www.academia.edu/5261476/Ultraright_Party_Politics_in_Post-Soviet_Ukraine_and_the_Puzzle_of_the_Electoral_Marginalism_of_Ukrainian_Ultranationalists_in_1994-2009|page=41|accessdate=February 20, 2015|quote=It is noteworthy that of these various Ukrainian nationalist parties the SNPU was the least inclined to conceal its neofascist affiliations. Its official symbol was the somewhat modified Wolf's Hook (wolfsangel), used as a symbol by the German SS division Das Reich and the Dutch SS division Landstorm Nederland during World War II and by a number of European neofascist organizations after 1945. As seen by the SNPU leadership, the Wolf's Hook became the "idea of the nation." Moreover, the official name of the party's ideology, "social nationalism," clearly referred back to "national socialism" – the official name of the ideology of the National-Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP) and of the Hitlerite regime. The SNPU's political platform distinguished itself by its openly revolutionary ultranationalism, its demands for the violent takeover of power in the country, and its willingness to blame Russia for all of Ukraine's ills. Moreover, the SNPU was the first relatively large party to recruit Nazi skinheads and football hooligans. But in the political arena, its support in the 1990s remained insignificant.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998–2004 Parubiy led the paramilitary organization of SNPU, the [[Patriot of Ukraine (organization)|Patriot of Ukraine]].&lt;ref name=aca/&gt; Parubiy left these organizations in 2004.&lt;ref name=leftFR2004/&gt;

Parubiy co-led the Orange Revolution in 2004.&lt;ref name=liga/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A35924-2004Dec4?language=printer Kiev Protesters Look Beyond Vote], [[The Washington Post]] (December 5, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Ukrainian parliamentary election, 2007|2007 parliamentary elections]] he was voted into the [[Ukrainian parliament]] on an [[Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc]] ticket. He then became a member of the deputy group that would later become [[For Ukraine!]].&lt;ref name=liga/&gt; Parubiy stayed with [[Our Ukraine (political party)|Our Ukraine]] and became a member of its political council.&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://razom.org.ua/349/1507/ Президія Політичної Ради партії] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613183539/http://razom.org.ua/349/1507/ |date=June 13, 2011 }}, [[Our Ukraine (political party)|Our Ukraine]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010 Parubiy asked the [[European Parliament]] to reconsider its negative reaction to former [[Ukrainian President]] [[Victor Yushchenko]]'s decision to award [[Stepan Bandera]], the leader of the [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists]], the title of [[Hero of Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/60550/ Parubiy asks European Parliament to reconsider its decision on Bandera], [[Kyiv Post]] (February 26, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

As Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council, Parubiy oversaw {{dubious|date=May 2016}} the "anti–terrorist" operation against [[2014 pro-Russian conflict in Ukraine|pro-Russian separatists]] in eastern Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/parubiy-says-anti-terrorist-operation-will-continue-as-separatists-in-luhansk-donetsk-reject-putins-call-to-postpone-referendum-346933.html Parubiy says anti-terrorist operation will continue as separatists in Luhansk, Donetsk reject Putin’s call to postpone referendum], Kyiv Post (May 8, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

He declined to say why, stating "I believe it is unacceptable to comment on my resignation in a time of war", and he would "continue to assist the front, primarily volunteer battalions".&lt;ref name="Parubiy steps down"/&gt; President Poroshenko signed a decree confirming Parubiy's dismissal the same day.&lt;ref name=interfax-217343/&gt; [[RT (TV network)|RT]] reported that local media were stating that Parubiy resigned after he was ordered to declare another ceasefire in the [[War in Donbass|southeast of Ukraine]], but refused to do so.&lt;ref name=rt-20140807&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.rt.com/news/178760-ukraine-security-chief-resigns/ |title=Ukraine's security chief Parubiy resigns |newspaper=RT |date=7 August 2014 |accessdate=19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3062">In [[Greek mythology]], '''Apemosyne''' ([[Ancient Greek]]: Ἀπημοσύνη) was a daughter of [[Catreus]], the son of [[Minos]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Bibliotheke|Apollodorus]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+3.2.1 3.2.1]; Diodorus Siculus, [http://www.theoi.com/Text/DiodorusSiculus4D.html#4 4.60.4]. [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]],  [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+8.53.4 8.53.4] says that, while the Cretans claim Catreus was the son of Minos, according to the [[Tegea]]ns, Catreus was the son of [[Tegeates]].&lt;/ref&gt; and king of [[Crete]]. She had a brother [[Althaemenes]], and two sisters [[Aerope]] and [[Clymene (mythology)|Clymene]].

Apemosyne is mentioned in the account of [[Bibliotheke|Apollodorus]].&lt;ref&gt;Apollodorus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+3.2 3.2]&lt;/ref&gt; According to  Apollodorus, Catreus received an oracle saying that he would be killed by one of his children, and although  Catreus  hid the oracles, his son Althaemenes found out. Fearing that ''he'' would be the one to kill Catreus, Althaemenes took Apemosyne and fled with her to [[Rhodes]].

There, [[Hermes]] fell in love with Apemosyne, but Apemosyne fled from him. Hermes could not catch her, because she ran faster than him.  On her way back from a spring, Apemosyne slipped on freshly skinned hides that Hermes had laid across her path. Hermes then caught and raped her. Later, when Apemosyne told her brother what had happened, he became angry, thinking that she was lying about being molested by the god. In his anger, he kicked her to death.

Cook,&lt;ref&gt; Cook, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9iShet_ZtHAC&amp;pg=PA923 923&amp;ndash;924]&lt;/ref&gt; saw in the myth of Apemosyne an historical element reflecting the relationship between Minoan Crete and Rhodes, as well as a possible etiological aspect explaining an ancient Rhodian custom involving human sacrifice.

'''Avram Iancu''' ({{IPA-ro|aˈvram ˈjaŋku}}; 1824 – September 10, 1872) was a [[Transylvania]]n [[Romanians|Romanian]] [[lawyer]] who played an important role in the local chapter of the [[The Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|Austrian Empire Revolutions]] of 1848–1849. He was especially active in the [[Țara Moților]] region and the [[Apuseni Mountains]]. The rallying of peasants around him, as well as the allegiance he paid to the [[Habsburgs|Habsburg]] got him the [[moniker]] ''Crăișorul Munților'' ("The Little Prince of the Mountains").&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Ion Ranca, Valeriu Nițu, ''Avram Iancu: documente și bibliografie'', Bucharest, Editura Științifică, 1974 (most contemporary documents about Avram Iancu, including his report to Wohlgemuth)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Avram Iancu was born in [[Avram Iancu, Alba|Vidra de Sus]] (currently [[Avram Iancu, Alba|Avram Iancu]], [[Alba County]]), [[Transylvania]], then part of the [[Austrian Empire]] into a family of peasants that had been [[emancipated]] from [[serfdom]]. His father was [[Alisandru Iancu]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iuNKAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22avram+iancu%22++Alisandru+Iancu&amp;dq=%22avram+iancu%22++Alisandru+Iancu&amp;hl=ro&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiXwI_h3tjKAhVG8mMKHVzNBZcQ6AEIHjAA|title=Avram Iancu în tradița poporului român|first=Florian|last=Dudaș|date=10 March 1989|publisher=Editura Facla|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1787-1855) and his mother was Maria Gligor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xCAKAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Maria+Gligor%22&amp;dq=%22Maria+Gligor%22&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjgoM-O4NjKAhUIxmMKHdciAYsQ6AEISzAI|title=Din istoria Transilvaniei|first1=Ioan|last1=Lupaș|first2=Marina|last2=Vlasiu|first3=Florin|last3=Constantiniu|date=10 March 1988|publisher=Editura Eminescu|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had one elder brother, Ion (born 1822), who became a priest.

Avram Iancu's grandfather was Gheorghe Iancu&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;q=%22Gheorghe+Iancu%22+%22avram+iancu%22#tbm=bks&amp;q=%22este+bunicul+s%C4%83u,+b%C4%83tr%C3%AEnul+Gheorghe+Iancu%22|title="Gheorghe Iancu" "avram iancu" - Google Search|website=www.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; (deceased before 1812), who had seven children (four girls and three boys): girls - Sântioana, Maria, Zamfira and Ana; boys - Alisandru (the father), Avram and Ioan.

Little is known today about Avram Iancu's childhood. It is known, by local tradition, that he had a typical [[Țara Moților|moț]] character, joyful and witty and he played well the leaf, alphorn, flute and violin.

Avram Iancu attended primary school in his village, in the "[[Avram Iancu, Alba|Târsa]]" hamlet. His teacher was Mihai Gomboș. After a while, he was sent by his parents at the school in [[Poiana Vadului|Neagra (now Poiana Vadului)]] village. Further, he attended the school from [[Câmpeni]], [[Alba county]], his teacher being Mihai Ioanette. He graduated the [[Câmpeni]] school at age 13.

After this, he went to school in [[Zlatna]], where he studied in a Hungarian school, in the [[Latin]] language, as Romanian schools didn't exist in this area. His teachers were Iozephus Stanken (1837-1838), Gregorius Iakabus (1838-1839) and Ludovicus Kovács (1839-1840 and 1840-1841). He graduated at age 17.

He studied [[humanities]] from 1841, in the [[Piarists|Piarist College]] of [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]], graduating [[law school]].

==Initial stages of 1848 Revolutions==

Avram Iancu became a [[law clerk]] in [[Târgu Mureș]], and it was there that he learned about the events of March 1848 of [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire#Revolution in the Austrian lands|Vienna]] and [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848#Revolt|Pest]]. His attitude at the time showed the nature of the conflict that was to engulf [[Transylvania]]: while Iancu welcomed the transition, he was indignant at the fact that Hungarian revolutionaries (many of whom were [[landowners]]) refused to debate the abolition of [[serfdom]] (which at the time was the state of the larger part of the Romanian population in Transylvania).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Ioan N. Ciolan, Constantin Voicu, Mihai Racovițan, "Transylvania:Romanian history and perpetuation, or, what official Hungarian documents say", Military Publishing House, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Apuseni]] mountains, he started rallying peasants in [[Câmpeni]]. The protests he organized were recognized as peaceful by the authorities, but nevertheless worried them. Iancu and his associate [[Ioan Buteanu]] quickly became the main figures of the Romanian-led actions in the area, especially after they took part in the [[Blaj]] Assemblies starting in April, where over 40,000 Romanians met to protest against Transylvania becoming a part of Hungary.&lt;ref name=Stoica1&gt;{{cite book|last=Stoica|first=Vasile|title=The Roumanian Question: The Roumanians and their Lands|year=1919|publisher=Pittsburgh Printing Company|location=Pittsburgh|page=23|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/7314/view/1/23/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Blaj]] (formerly known as ''Balázsfalva/Blasendorf'') both opted for the main, radical wing of the movement. Centered on [[Alexandru Papiu Ilarian]], the group opposed the Hungarian revolutionary option of uniting Transylvania and Hungary. It got into conflict with the minority wing around [[Romanian Church United with Rome, Greek-Catholic|Greek-Catholic]] [[Bishop]] [[Ioan Lemeni]], one which chose not to [[boycott]] the elections for the [[Hungarian Parliament]].

While the union was carried of on May 30, 1848, the majority of Romanian activists looked towards [[Vienna]] and Emperor [[Ferdinand I of Austria|Ferdinand]], sharing the cause of the [[Transylvanian Saxons]]. Things became heated after July 11, when Hungary declared its independence. [[Austria]] started to open itself to the Romanian demands, while bloody conflicts ensued between the Hungarian nobles and their Romanian [[serfs]]. The last Assembly in Blaj saw the [[Habsburg]] governor, [[Anton Freiherr von Puchner]], approve of the arming of National Guards for Romanians and Saxons. On September 27, the [[lynching]] of Austrian [[plenipotentiary]] [[Count Franz Philipp von Lamberg|Count Lemberg]] by a Pest crowd cut off any dialogue between the two centers. The new Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] and the Austrian government granted the Romanians numerous liberties and rights; although [[Lajos Kossuth]]'s government abolished serfdom, this was no longer a match for the Imperial offer.

===Outbreak===
The Austrians clearly rejected the October demand that the ethnical criteria become the basis for internal borders, with the goal of creating a province for Romanians (Transylvania grouped alongside [[Banat]] and [[Bukovina]]), as they did not want to replace the threat of Hungarian nationalism with the potential of Romanian [[separatism]]. Yet they did not declare themselves hostile to the rapid creation of Romanian administrative offices within Transylvania.

The territory was organized in ''prefecturi'' ("prefectures"), with Avram Iancu and Buteanu as two prefects in the Apuseni. Iancu's prefecture, the ''Auraria Gemina'' (a name charged with [[Latin]] symbolism), became the most important one as it took over from bordering areas that were never really fully organized.

In the same month, the administrative efforts were put to a halt, as Hungarians under [[Józef Bem]] carried out a sweeping offensive through Transylvania. With the discreet assistance of [[Imperial Russia]]n troops, the Austrian army (except for the garrisons at [[Alba Iulia]] and [[Deva, Romania|Deva]]) and the Austrian-Romanian administration retreated to [[Wallachia]] and Wallachian [[Oltenia]] (both were, at the time, under Russia's occupation).

===Attrition===
On 8 November, Avram Iancu, along with his 4,000 combatants of the "Auraria Gemina" Legion took part in joint military actions with Austrian forces. The Legion reached Turda, and the city surrendered without a fight on 20 November. Then, he and his troops returned to the mountains.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Dragomir 1968, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 November, Avram Iancu had another 1,500 troops mobilized for action. On 4 December, he reached Săcuieu, and on 6-7 December, he and his men were ordered to attack the enemy lines by surprise. However, the attack failed, due to the incompetence of an Austrian officer, and the Romanians were forced to withdraw by 10 December.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; By early January 1849, Transylvania was almost entirely conquered by the Hungarian Army. The Romanian fighters holding out in their mountains stronghold were running low of supplies, having only 800 rifles to arm a few thousand men, and were completely surrounded by Hungarian troops by the end of March.&lt;ref&gt;Dragomir 1968, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

In April 1849, Iancu was approached by the Hungarian envoy [[Ioan Dragoş]] (in fact, a Romanian deputy in the Hungarian Parliament).
Dragoș appeared to have been acting out of his own desire for peace, since Iancu's troops were tying down too many Hungarian troops, about 10,000, a third of the Hungarian Army in Transylvania, according to Hungarian general János Czecz.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; He worked hard to get the Romanian leaders to meet him in [[Abrud]] and listen to the Hungarian demands. Iancu's direct adversary, Hungarian commander [[Imre Hatvany]], seems to have taken profit on the provisional [[armistice]] to attack the Romanians in Abrud.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Keith Hitchins, ''Românii 1774-1866'', Bucharest, Humanitas, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; He did not, however, benefit from a surprise, as Iancu and his men retreated and then encircled him. In the meanwhile, Dragoș was lynched by the Abrud crowds, in the belief that he was part of Hatvany's ruse.

Hatvany also angered the Romanians by having Buteanu captured and murdered. While his position became weaker, he was permanently attacked by Iancu's men, until the major defeat of May 22. Hatvany and most of his armed group were massacred by their adversaries, as Iancu captured their [[cannon]]s, switching the tactical advantage for the next months. Hatvany's troops lost 5,000 soldiers and all of their artillery.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Kossuth was angered by Hatvany's gesture (an inspection of the time dismissed all of Hatvany's close collaborators), especially since it made future negotiations unlikely.

On 8 June, the Romanian stronghold in the mountains was attacked by the largest Hungarian force yet: 4,000 men supported by 19 cannons led by General  Kemeny Farkas. The battle lasted between 11 and 17 June and ended in a crushing victory for the Romanians, the Hungarians having at least 500 troops killed during the battle.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

The Russian intervention in June precipitated events, especially since [[Poles]] fighting in the Hungarian revolutionary contingents wanted to see an all-out resistance to the [[Tsarist]] armies. People like [[Henryk Dembiński]] mediated for an understanding between Kossuth and the Wallachian [[émigré]] revolutionaries. The latter, understandably close to Avram Iancu (especially [[Nicolae Bălcescu]], [[Gheorghe Magheru]], [[Alexandru G. Golescu]], and [[Ion Ghica]]) were also keen to inflict a defeat on the Russian armies that had crushed their movement in September 1848. Fighting also continued in July, during the peace negotiations, on 2, 4, and 22 July, all Hungarian attacks being repulsed yet again. Finally, the conflict ended on 29 July, as Avram Iancu offered a guarantee to the Hungarian troops that he would not attack them, allowing them to withdraw in front of the Austro-Russian offensive.&lt;ref&gt;Dragomir 1968, pp. 270-271&lt;/ref&gt;

===Negotiations===
Bălcescu and Kossuth met in May 1849, in [[Debrecen]]. The contact has for long been celebrated by Romanian [[Marxist]] historians and politicians: [[Karl Marx]]'s condemnation of everything opposing Kossuth had led to any Romanian initiative being automatically considered "''[[reactionary]]''". In fact, it appears that the agreement was in no way a pact: Kossuth meant to flatter the Wallachians, by getting them to champion the idea of Iancu's armies leaving Transylvania for good, in order to help Bălcescu in [[Bucharest]]. While agreeing to mediate for peace, Bălcescu never presented these terms to the fighters in the Apuseni. His personal documents (commented by [[Liviu Maior]]) show that the un-realistic assumptions of Kossuth had made him view the Hungarian leader as a "''[[demagogue]]''".&lt;ref name="Liviu Maior 1849"&gt;Liviu Maior, ''1848-1849. Români și unguri în revoluție'', Bucharest, Editura Enciclopedică, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Even more contradictory, the only thing Avram Iancu agreed to (and which no party had asked for) was his forces' "''neutrality''" in the conflict between Russia and Hungary.&lt;ref name="Liviu Maior 1849"/&gt; Thus, he secured his position as the Hungarian armies suffered defeats in July, culminating in the [[Battle of Segesvár]] ([[Sighişoara]]), and then the capitulation of August 13.

==Later years==


Avram Iancu agreed to disarm as soon as the Austrians took over, and wrote a detailed report to the new governor of Transylvania, General [[Ludwig von Wohlgemuth]] (in 1850). In order to avoid suspicion of Romanian separatism, the document does not mention the contacts with the Wallachians. As the Austrians granted the abolition of serfdom, they also forbade all representative institutions in Transylvania. While Hungarian nationalism was slowly fitting in the pattern that would make the ''[[Ausgleich]]'' acceptable for both sides involved, the Romanian option raised more and more irritation. The revolutionary zeal it had found under Iancu, although profiting the Monarchy, could also prove to be a weapon used for very different goals (the Austrians were especially fearful that the [[Eastern Orthodox]] faith of the Romanians would accommodate itself with [[Pan-Slavism]], completing the gap between [[Serbia]] and the Russian Empire).

It is very possible that Iancu was not able to properly observe the new status quo. While decision for his initial arrest (in December 1849) was quickly overturned after local protests (and explained as an abuse), he was censored throughout his life, had his library confiscated, and was placed under surveillance. He was even arrested a second time, in 1852, after it was presumed that his presence alone served to inflame local sentiments. Local traditions &lt;ref&gt;http://www.curentul.net/2015/03/15/apel-la-memoria-romanismului-replici-celebre-ale-lui-avram-iancu/&lt;/ref&gt;hold that the emperor [[Franz Joseph]] was visiting Transylvania and on July 21st, 1852 he was in the [[Apuseni Mountains]] area, purportedly  to attend [[The Maidens' Fair]] on [[Găina Mountain]] but also hoping that Iancu would agree to meet him. Allegedly, Iancu refused, uttering his famous line '''"It's all for naught, a madman and a liar can't by any means come to understand each other"'''. Soon after his release, Iancu visited Vienna and attempted to petition the Emperor. He was prevented to do so by the police, a public humiliation which provoked a [[nervous breakdown]] from which he never recovered. He spent the rest of his life as a half-mad vagrant, traveling the Apuseni, living out of whatever alms that the impoverished [[Țara Moților|moți]] population could spare for him, singing sad Romanian [[Doina|doina songs]] on his flute.
[[File:AvramIancuOld.jpg|thumb|Avram Iancu in his late, half-mad years]]

'''Badrinath "Badri" Roysam''' (born 1961) is an Indian-American professor and researcher. He is the current chairman of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the [[University of Houston]] [[Cullen College of Engineering]].&lt;ref name = "UHsite"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ece.uh.edu/faculty/roysam|title=Roysam|work=UH Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Roysam is notable as the creator of the FARSIGHT project, which is a collaborative effort to create an open source software toolkit to analyze multidimensional images.&lt;ref name="eeweb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eeweb.com/spotlight/interview-with-dr.-badri-roysam|title=Interview with Dr. Badri Roysam - EEWeb Community|work=eeweb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roysam's work as a researcher focuses on cancer [[immunotherapy]] and [[neuroscience]].&lt;ref name="UHsite" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hhmi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hhmi.org/annualreport2010/janelia-farm/diadem-challenge-yields-big-win-for-neuroscience.php|title=Howard Hughes Medical Institute - 2010 Annual Report - DIADEM Challenge Yields Big Win for Neuroscience|work=hhmi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to interdisciplinary collaborations such as FARSIGHT, Dr. Roysam is also a proponent of the Electrical Power Analytics Consortium, which aims to improve the state of the power grid in the hurricane-prone Houston area.&lt;ref name="radio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/news/bauer-business-focus-badri-roysam-and-electric-power-research/|title=Bauer Business Focus: Badri Roysam and Electric Power Research|work=Houston Public Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Roysam received his Bachelor of Technology degree from the [[Indian Institute of Technology]] (IIT) in 1984. He then went on to earn his master's degree from [[Washington University]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] in 1987, and his Doctor of Science degree from the same institution in 1989.&lt;ref name="bgnd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iprpi.rpi.edu/Badrinath%20Roysam.htm|title=Badrinath Roysam: RPI|work=Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Roysam began his career at [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] in [[Troy, New York]] in 1989, where he was a professor of electrical and computer engineering. Here, he became director of the Rensselaer branch of the Center for Subsurface Imaging and Sensing Systems (CenSISS) from 2001 until his departure in 2010.&lt;ref name="UHsite"/&gt; CenSISS is a multi-institution and multidisciplinary [[National Science Foundation|NSF]] funded center. In 2006, it was endowed by the [[Bernard Marshall Gordon]] foundation and renamed the Bernard Marshall Gordon Center for Subsurface Imaging and Sensing Systems (Gordon-CenSISS).&lt;ref name = 
"Censsis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.censsis.neu.edu/about_the_center/center_history/|title=CenSISS History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roysam initiated the development of FARSIGHT while at RPI, with the intention of developing an interdisciplinary resource for imaging tools.&lt;ref name="eeweb"/&gt; The development of the FARSIGHT project triggered interest, and subsequently funding, from federal institutions such as [[DARPA]] and the [[NIH]].&lt;ref name="UHsite"/&gt; The success of FARSIGHT also led to industry collaborations, such as with [[Kitware]], a local [[New York City]] company founded by an RPI alumnus.&lt;ref name="kit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesunion.com/business/article/Computer-visionaries-598281.php|title=Computer Visionaries|work=The Times Union}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Roysam left RPI for the University of Houston, becoming the Hugh Roy and Lillie Cranz Cullen endowed professor, as well as an administrative role as the chairman of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department.&lt;ref name="UHsite"/&gt; Here he continued his work with FARSIGHT, and was part of the collaborative effort to develop a tool for the analysis of high dimensional data (STrenD).&lt;ref name ="strend"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Xu|first= Yan|last2= Qiu|first2= Peiliang|last3 = Roysam|first3= Badrinath|date= 20 January 2015|title=Unsupervised Discovery of Subspace Trends|url= http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?reload=true&amp;arnumber=7015603|journal= IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence|publisher= IEEE|volume= PP|issue= 99|pages= 1|doi= 10.1109/TPAMI.2015.2394475|access-date=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, Roysam has been recognized for his research in cancer immunotherapy using [[bioinformatics]]. Working in partnership with [[M.D. Anderson Cancer Center]] and the Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering Department of the University of Houston, Roysam and his colleagues have developed software that can single out cancer cells and profile their interactions on a cell-to-cell level. This allows close study of immune system cells and how they can be used to neutralize cancer cells.&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilymullin/2015/08/12/how-bioinformatics-could-finding-the-next-breakthrough-cancer-drug/|title=How Bioinformatics Could Find The Next Breakthrough Cancer Drug|work=Forbes Business}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Merouane|first= Amine|last2= Rey-Villamizar|first2= Nicolas|last3 = Lu|first3= Yanbin|last4 = Liadi|first4= Ivan|last5 = Romain|first5= Gabrielle|last6 = Lu|first6= Jennifer|last7 = Singh|first7= Harjeet|last8 = Cooper|first8= Laurence J.N.|last9 = Varadarajan|first9= Navin|last10 = Roysam|first10= Badrinath|date= 9 June 2015|title=Automated profiling of individual cell–cell interactions from high-throughput time-lapse imaging microscopy in nanowell grids (TIMING) |url= http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/07/10/bioinformatics.btv355?cited-by=yes&amp;legid=bioinfo;btv355v2#cited-by|journal= Bioinformatics|publisher= Oxford University Press|volume= 31|issue= |pages= 3189–3197|doi= 10.1093/bioinformatics/btv355|access-date=22 August 2015 |pmid=26059718 |pmc=4693004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cai eventually became an influential [[warlord]] in [[Yunnan]], and is best known for his role in challenging the imperial ambitions of [[Yuan Shikai]].

Cai's name has also been [[Romanisation of Chinese|romanised]] as '''Tsai Ao'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.cntv.cn/special/1911/20110923/111825.shtml|title=Cai E - Chinese Revolutionary Leader and Warlord  CCTV News - CNTV English|website=english.cntv.cn|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early career===
[[File:The Memorial Cottage of Cai E3.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Memorial Cottage of Cai E, located in [[Yuelu Mountain]], [[Changsha]], [[Hunan]], China.]]

Cai studied at the prestigious and progressive ''Shiwu Xuetang'' (School of Current Affairs), where he was taught by [[Liang Qichao]] and [[Tang Caichang]], and went to [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] to study in 1899. Cai returned to China in 1900, when he was only 18, and attempted to take part in an uprising against the [[Qing Dynasty]] as part of the Self-Support Army, a revolutionary militia led by Tang Caichang. When the rebellion failed, Cai returned to Japan. During this second sojourn in Japan he received military training at the [[Tokyo Shimbu Gakko]], followed by the [[Imperial Japanese Army Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;''Yuelu Academy''&lt;/ref&gt;

He returned to [[Guangxi]] Province, where he held several military posts and established a military training academy from 1904-10. While in Guangxi he joined the [[Tongmenghui]], a Chinese revolutionary organization dedicated to the overthrow of the [[Qing dynasty]]. In 1910 he was transferred to [[Yunnan]] Province to command the 37th Brigade of the [[New Army]] and teach at the Yunnan Military Academy in [[Kunming]]. One of his pupils at the school was [[Zhu De]], who began studying there in 1909 and graduated in 1912.

Shortly after the [[Xinhai Revolution]] began on 10 October 1911, Cai, leading the 37th Brigade, successfully occupied Yunnan. After the revolution he served as Commander-in-Chief of the Military Government of Yunnan.&lt;ref name="schemmel"&gt;Schemmel&lt;/ref&gt;

Cai E was Governor of Yunnan from 1911-13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pn5CAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=tang+jiyao+governor+1913&amp;dq=tang+jiyao+governor+1913&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=QarNTMH_HYPGlQe61KXjCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwCA|title=The Yunnan Provincial Faction, 1927-1937|author=J.

Following Song's assassination by [[Yuan Shikai]], and Yuan's subsequent assumption of the presidency of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]], Yuan had Cai removed from office and eventually held under house arrest in [[Beijing]].&lt;ref name="schemmel" /&gt; [[Tang Jiyao]] replaced Cai E as Military Governor of Yunnan in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dCrVAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=After+the+Xinhai+revolution,+military+power+in+Yunnan+had+been+seized+by+General+Cai+E.+When+he+left+for+Beijing+in+1913,+Tang+Jiyao+succeeded+him+as+military+governor.+Afraid+of+losing+his+hold+on+power,+Tang+had+refused+to+march&amp;dq=After+the+Xinhai+revolution,+military+power+in+Yunnan+had+been+seized+by+General+Cai+E.+When+he+left+for+Beijing+in+1913,+Tang+Jiyao+succeeded+him+as+military+governor.+Afraid+of+losing+his+hold+on+power,+Tang+had+refused+to+march&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZqrNTKnkB8b_lgeixt3nCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA|title=Модерн хисторий оф Чина|author=Сергей Леонидович Тихвинский|year=1983|publisher=Progress Publishers|location=|pages=624|isbn=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition to Yuan Shikai===
In 1915 [[Yuan Shikai]] announced his plans to dissolve the [[History of the Republic of China|Republic]] and proclaim himself the emperor of a new dynasty. After hearing of his intentions, Cai escaped detention on 11 November, first returning to Japan and then to Yunnan.&lt;ref name="schemmel" /&gt; After returning to Yunnan, Cai established the local [[National Protection War|National Protection Army]] to resist Yuan and defend the Republic.&lt;ref name="Beck1"&gt;Beck "Yuan Shikai's Presidency 1912-16"&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 December Yuan formally "accepted" a petition to become emperor, and protests spread throughout China. On 23 December Cai sent a telegram to Beijing threatening to declare independence if Yuan did not cancel his plans within two days. When Yuan did not respond favorably, Cai declared independence on 25 December and made plans to invade [[Sichuan]]. The governor of [[Guizhou]] joined Cai in rebellion, declaring independence on 27 December. Yuan had himself inaugurated as emperor on 1 January 1916, and Cai successfully occupied Sichuan later that month.&lt;ref name="Beck1" /&gt;

[[File:Cai e's tomb.JPG|thumb|250px|right|The Tomb of Cai E, located in Yuelu Mountain, Changsha, Hunan, China.]]

Yuan sent two leading military commanders from northern China to attack Cai, but although the forces sent by Yuan outnumbered Cai's army, Yuan's commanders were either unwilling or unable to defeat him. When it became clear that Cai's rebellion would be successful, many other provinces joined him in resisting Yuan. Guangxi and Shandong declared independence in March, Guangdong and Zhejiang in April and Shaanxi, Sichuan and Hunan in May. With several provinces behind them, the revolutionaries successfully forced Yuan to abandon monarchism on 20 March 1916.&lt;ref name="Beck1" /&gt;

After Yuan died on 6 June 1916, Cai held the positions of Governor-General and Governor of Sichuan. He left for Japan for medical treatment at [[Kyushu Imperial University]] in [[Fukuoka]] for [[tuberculosis]] later in 1916, but died shortly after his arrival. He was accorded a [[state funeral]] in China at [[Yuelu Mountain]] in [[Hunan]] on 12 April 1917.

==Legacy==
Many of the warlords who served under [[Yuan Shikai]] did not support his ambition to revive the monarchy, and Cai E was one of the leading figures who successfully forced Yuan to step down. He served as an inspiration for the young [[Zhu De]], who later became one of the most successful military leaders of the [[Chinese Red Army]], the forerunner to the [[People's Liberation Army]].

== Depiction in popular culture ==
*In October 2009, [[TVB]] broadcast a series about the story of Cai E and Yuan Shikai: ''[[In the Chamber of Bliss]]''.

'''Courtney Brown''' (born 1952) is an [[associate professor]] in the [[political science]] department at [[Emory University]] and is known for promoting the use of [[nonlinearity|nonlinear mathematics]] in social scientific research.  He is also known as a proponent of [[remote viewing]], a form of [[extrasensory perception]].

==Applied mathematics==
Brown's research in applied mathematics is mostly focused on social science applications of time-dependent models. He has published five peer-reviewed books and numerous articles in applied mathematics. Brown is also a very visible advocate of the use of the [[R_(programming_language)|R Programming Language]], both for statistical as well as nonlinear modeling applications in the social sciences.

==Remote viewing==

Brown learned the basic [[Transcendental Meditation]] and an advanced technique called the [[TM-Sidhi program]] in 1991. He claims to have engaged in "yogic flying" at the Golden Dome of Pure Knowledge at [[Maharishi University of Management]] in [[Fairfield, Iowa]] in 1992,&lt;ref name= "Brown1996"&gt;{{Cite book |publisher= Farsight |isbn= 9780525940982 |last= Brown |first= Courtney |title= Cosmic Voyage: A Scientific Discovery of Extraterrestrials Visiting Earth |year= 1996 |pages= 38–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; though there is no empirical evidence that such a thing is possible.

The field of [[remote viewing]] is exceptionally controversial. Brown's remote viewing findings have been dismissed by scientists, such as his colleague at Emory University [[Scott O. Lilienfeld]], who has claimed that Brown has refused to subject his ideas and his claimed psychic powers to independent scientific testing on what Lilienfeld describes as "curious" grounds.&lt;ref name= "Lilienfeld1996"&gt;{{cite news |title= The Courtney Brown affair and academic freedom |department= First Person |url= http://www.emory.edu/EMORY_REPORT/erarchive/1996/September/ERsept.9/9_9_96first_person.html |magazine= Emory Report |date= 1996-09-09 |volume= 43 |issue= 3 |last= Lilienfeld |first= Scott O. |publisher= Office of Communications and Marketing, [[Emory University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This claim is based on a request that Brown show up in an Emory classroom to remote view something. Brown refused saying that he does not do anything related to remote viewing at Emory. Brown is not restricted in listing his affiliation with Emory when talking about remote viewing or any other subject, something that has been incorrectly reported elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Shermer2001"&gt;{{cite book |last= Shermer |first= Michael |authorlink= Michael Shermer |title= The Borderlands of Science: Where Sense Meets Nonsense |year= 2001 |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] |isbn= 9780198032724 |pages= [https://books.google.com/books?id=KCanmmIb8QUC&amp;pg=PA3 3–4]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He normally acts as a data analyst while working with other remote viewers (who do the actual viewing) who have been trained in procedures that were developed by the U.S. military{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}.

Among a variety of controversial topics, Brown has claimed to apply remote viewing to the study of multiple realities, the nonlinearity of time, planetary phenomena, extraterrestrial life, UFOs, [[Atlantis]], and even [[Jesus Christ]].&lt;ref name= "Shermer2001"/&gt; According to [[Michael Shermer]] "The claims in Brown's two books are nothing short of spectacularly weird. Through his numerous SRV sessions he says he has spoken with Jesus and Buddha (both, apparently, are advanced aliens), visited other inhabited planets, time traveled to Mars back when it was fully inhabited by intelligent ETs, and has even determined that aliens are living among us—one group in particular resides underground in New Mexico."&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Shermer|Shermer, Michael]]. (1997). ''[[Why People Believe Weird Things|Why People Believe Weird Things: Pseudoscience, Superstition, and Other Confusions of Our Time]]''. Henry Holt and Company. p. 325. {{ISBN|0-8050-7089-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert A. Baker|Robert Baker]] writing in the ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'' came to the conclusion that Brown's beliefs from remote viewing about alien civilizations is a case of [[self-deception]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert A. Baker|Baker, Robert]]. (1996). [http://www.csicop.org/sb/show/scientific_remote_viewing/ "Scientific Remote Viewing"] Csicop.org. Retrieved 2014-06-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around May 2017, the CIA officially shared publicly, the results of several experiments on remote viewing,  confirming the use and development of these techniques by the intelligence of U.S. military, also included the step by step instructions for perfection of remote viewing technique.[https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/collection/stargate], when prompted the officers in charge of this release, they limited their answer, by just saying; "It is time...", thus supporting the statements from Brown.

'''David Ahenakew''' {{post-nominals|CD}}{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} (July 28, 1933 – March 12, 2010) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|First Nations]] ([[Cree]]) politician, and former National Chief of the [[Assembly of First Nations]].

Ahenakew was born at the [[Ahtahkakoop First Nation|Sandy Lake Indian Reserve]] in [[Saskatchewan]]. He and his wife, Grace Ahenakew, had five children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sicc.sk.ca/faces/mahenda.htm Aboriginal Faces of Saskatchewan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610074057/http://www.sicc.sk.ca/faces/mahenda.htm |date=2008-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military and political career==
Ahenakew served in the [[Canadian Forces]] from 1951 to 1967, during which time he was stationed in [[Germany]], [[Korea]] (during the [[Korean War]]), and [[Egypt]].

In 1967, upon leaving the army, Ahenakew accepted a position with the Saskatchewan government, and became active in the [[Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations]] (FSIN). He was elected to the position of FSIN president in 1968. He stated that his military experience heavily influenced his choice to pursue politics: "I could see that what was happening to our people was the same kind of exploitation and degradation I had seen in Korea and Egypt."

During his time as FSIN president he released a report entitled "Indian Education in Saskatchewan," and played a role in the founding of the Saskatchewan Indian Cultural College and the [[Saskatchewan Indian Federated College]] in 1972.

Ahenakew received the [[Order of Canada]] in the degree of Member in 1978. His citation read: "Member of a United Nations committee and of the World Indigenous Peoples Council. His many years of service to Indians and Métis in Saskatchewan culminated in his election as Chief of the Federation of Saskatchewan Indians, which has revolutionized Indian education in his province." He was stripped of the Order of Canada in 2005 after making controversial remarks about the Holocaust.&lt;ref name="cbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/conrad-black-stripped-of-order-of-canada-1.2519299?cmp=fbtl|title=Conrad Black removed from Order of Canada &amp;#124; CBC News|website=cbc.ca|accessdate=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, he was elected Chief of the Assembly of First Nations, a national representative body for Canadian aboriginals.

==Controversy surrounding anti-semitic remarks==
On December 13, 2002, Ahenakew gave a speech to an FSIN group, which was attended by James Parker, a reporter from the ''[[Saskatoon StarPhoenix]]''. He made references to "goddamn immigrants" in Canada during his speech. During a question-and-answer session following his lecture, Ahenakew said that [[Jews]] were a disease in Germany and that [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] was trying to "clean up Europe" when he "fried six million of those guys." He also stated that [[Israel]] and the [[United States]] (specifically mentioning [[George W. Bush]]) were going to start the next world war.&lt;ref name="charged"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2003/06/11/ahenakew_charge030611.html |title=Ahenakew charged with spreading hate |work=[[CBC News]] |date=June 11, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Germans used to tell me, and I got to know them well because I played soccer against them and with them and so forth. But they used to tell me that you guys are blessed. What we know about the Indians in Canada. They are blessed. But that blessing is being destroyed by your immigrants that are going over there. Especially the Jews, they said. The Second World War was started by the Jews and the Third World War, whatever it is, is between Israel and the Arab countries. I was there as well. But there's going to be a war because the Israelis and the "Bushies" – you know, the bully, the bigot in the United States – tells you that if you're not with me you're against me.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After the session concluded, the ''StarPhoenix'' reporter asked him to clarify these remarks, and he explained that while serving in the army after the war, Germans had told him the Jews had provoked the war. The ''StarPhoenix'' quoted him as further saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Jews damn near owned all of Germany prior to the war. That's why Hitler came in. He was going to make damn sure that the Jews didn't take over [[Germany]], or even [[Europe]]. That's why he fried six million of those guys, you know. Jews would have owned the goddamned world. And look what they're doing now, they're killing people in [[Arab]] countries.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The reporter asked how Ahenakew could justify the [[Holocaust]]. The ''StarPhoenix'' quoted Ahenakew as replying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;How else do you get rid of a disease like that, that's going to take over, that's going to dominate?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Public reaction ===
The comments were first circulated in the Canadian national media several days later, and were quickly condemned as [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] by Jewish groups, aboriginal leaders and Canadian politicians alike. Both [[Perry Bellegarde|Perry Bellgarde]], president of FSIN, and [[Matthew Coon Come]], [[Assembly of First Nations|AFN]] national chief, were quick to distance themselves from Ahenakew's comments.

In June 2003, Ahenakew was formally charged by the Saskatchewan Justice Department with promoting hatred.&lt;ref name="charged" /&gt;

In an interview in the July/August 2003 edition of ''[[This Magazine]]'', Ahenakew expressed to reporter Alex Roslin his dissatisfaction with what he called "racial control" of the media, saying that "when a group of people, a race of people, control the world media, something has to be done about it." The article also quotes claims that Ahenakew had long held racist beliefs against Jews, Blacks and other ethnic groups that had been shielded from the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Speak No Evil |url=http://www.thismagazine.ca/issues/2003/07/speaknoevil.php |work=[[This (Canadian magazine)|This Magazine]] |last=Roslin |first=Alex |date=July–August 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060827093351/http://www.thismagazine.ca/issues/2003/07/speaknoevil.php |archivedate=2006-08-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In connection with the remarks from 2002, which were recorded on tape with his knowledge, Ahenakew was later convicted in July 2005 of willfully promoting hatred against Jews. Ahenakew apologized for the remarks, saying they did not represent his beliefs and that he was "caught up in the heat of the moment. I was attempting to spark debate on what has been happening to our First Nations people." At his trial, he later recanted his apology and blamed his outburst on his [[diabetes]], some wine and a change in medication, a defense that was rejected by the court and he was subsequently fined $1,000. Despite this, he retained his belief that the Jews started the Second World War. Jewish groups, aboriginals and politicians later called for Ahenakew's membership in the [[Order of Canada]] to be revoked. The [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Removal from the Order of Canada|revoked]] Ahenakew's membership shortly after his trial.&lt;ref name="revocation"/&gt;

In June 2006, the decision was overturned by the Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench on the grounds that the trial judge failed to properly take into account that the remarks were uttered in the midst of an angry confrontation with a reporter, and therefore may not have constituted a "willful" promotion of hatred. A new trial was ordered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2006/06/08/ahenakew-newtrial.html|title=Judge orders new trial for David Ahenakew |work=[[CBC News]]|date=June 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second trial===
Ahenakew was retried in Saskatoon in 2008. In February 2009, Saskatchewan Provincial Court Judge Wilfred Tucker acquitted Ahenakew because his statements, while "revolting, disgusting and untrue" did not show an intent to incite hatred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ca.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idCATRE51M5NZ20090223|title=Canada native leader cleared in second hate trial|work=[[Reuters]]|date=February 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Following a long battle with cancer, Ahenakew died on March 12, 2010 at a hospital in [[Shellbrook, Saskatchewan]], aged 76.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/news/Controversial+native+leader+David+Ahenakew+dies/2677874/story.html|title=Controversial native leader David Ahenakew dies|work=[[Canwest News Service]]|date=March 13, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324015704/http://www.canada.com/news/Controversial+native+leader+David+Ahenakew+dies/2677874/story.html|archivedate=2010-03-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/controversial-native-leader-ahenakew-dies-1.885292|title=Controversial native leader ahenakew dies|work=[[CBC News]]|date=March 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dominic Dim Deng''' (1 March 1950 – 2 May 2008) was a senior member of the [[Sudan People's Liberation Army]], a distinguished military veteran General and the first [[Defence Minister]] in the Government of [[Southern Sudan]] who lost his life alongside his wife Madam [[Josephine Apieu Jenaro Aken]], senior politician Dr. Justin Yac Arop and 18 other [[Sudan People's Liberation Army]] and Government of Southern Sudan officials on a leased [[CEM Air]] [[Beechcraft 1900]] that crashed 375&amp;nbsp;km west of [[Juba, Sudan]] on May 2, 2008.

==Life and career==
[[File:Flag of the SPLAM.svg|thumb|left|Flag of Sudan People's Liberation Army]]
Dominic Dim, a member of the [[Dinka]] group from the [[Bahr el Ghazal (region of South Sudan)|Bahr el Ghazal]] region was born in a remote village called Adol in Twic County, [[Warrap (state)|Warrap State]], [[Southern Sudan]]. In 1962, he attended Nyarkach Primary School. He completed his primary education at Nyarkach and joined Kuajok Intermediate School in 1964.

In 1966 at the age of only sixteen Dim joined the rebels of Southern Sudan in [[the First Sudanese Civil War]]. A peace agreement was signed in 1972 between the rebels and the Government of Sudan, known as the [[Addis Ababa Agreement (1972)|Addis Ababa Agreement]], as part of the agreement Dim was absorbed in the Sudanese National Army (SNA) with a rank of 1st Lt.

While he was on active duty in the SNA, Dim underwent several military courses. He passed all of the courses top of his batch as a result he was able to make rapid and regular promotions at different ranks in the Sudan National Army. With a new war brewing in the South, Dim eventually decided to leave the Sudan National Army with a rank of Col. and join SPLM/A in 1987.

His first assignment was Deputy Commander for Northern Zone ([[Bahr el Ghazal (region of South Sudan)|Bahr el Ghazal]]) which was commanded by the President of [[Southern Sudan]] [[Salva Kiir Mayardit]]. Two years later, he was promoted to Commander and assigned to Central Zone (Bor, Jonglei), where he defeated Saif El Hobuor. Cdr Diim was wounded in this operation and was given permission to travel to London for medical treatment in 1991/1992.

While on medical leave in London, United Kingdom, Dim obtained BA Honorary degree in [[Business Administration]] in 1998.

In 2004 Dim was appointed as member of National Liberation Council, the highest political organ of the SPLM/A. In 2005, Dim became commander of Special Reserved Forces ([[Sudan People's Liberation Army]]) and nominated by Twic Mayardit Community as member of the [[South Sudan Legislative Assembly]], a position he served until his death.

In 2005, when Sudan's Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) was signed all the SPLA ranks were converted to be similar to that of Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) ranks. Dim was promoted to the rank of Lt. General. In 2006 Lt. Gen. Dim was sent to South Africa for military leadership course, part of a programme initiated by the South African Government, for SPLM/A senior staff.

In 2007 he became the first political officer of the [[Sudan People's Liberation Army]] when he was appointed as the first Minister for SPLA Affairs in the Government of Southern Sudan. He was also locally elected as the Chairperson of [[Warrap State]] Communities.

Dim is buried alongside his wife at the [[Sudan People's Liberation Army]] Headquarters in Juba.

== Personal life ==
Dim was married to [[Josephine Apieu Jenaro Aken]] whom he met at Pannyok School where her father Jenario Aken was a teacher. They were married in 1973.

{{Ulysses Grant sidebar}}

The '''early life and career of Ulysses S. Grant''' (born '''Hiram Ulysses Grant'''; April 27, 1822 – July 23, 1885) tells the story of the future general's ancestry, birth, and early career in and out of the United States army from 1822 to 1861. Grant was born in Ohio in 1822. Grant was educated in both private and public schools or academies and was later known to be an avid reader. Grant was raised a [[Methodist]], but uncommon for his times, he was not baptized or forced to attend church by his parents. Growing up in a middle-class family, supported by his father's tanneries, he sought a different career in the military. He was appointed to [[West Point]] by Ohio Congressman [[Thomas L. Hamer]]. It was Hamer who had given Grant the name ''Ulysses S. Grant'' when Grant entered West Point as a plebe in 1839. After four years at [[West Point]], he was stationed in Missouri, where he met his future wife, [[Julia Grant|Julia Dent]]. In 1846, Grant served in the [[Mexican–American War]], where he was brevetted for bravery. There he fought in Mexico and learned under two commanders, [[Zachary Taylor]] and [[Winfield Scott]]. Upon his return to the United States, he married Julia and started a family.

After the war, Grant was assigned to posts in New York and Michigan before traveling West to a posting [[Vancouver Barracks|Fort Vancouver]] and at Fort Humboldt in present-day northern California. On his journey to California by ship, Grant compassionately aided victims of a cholera epidemic while traveling through Panama, arriving in San Francisco in 1853, during the [[California Gold Rush]]. Grant's tenure in the [[Pacific Northwest]] included the aftermath of the [[Cayuse War]]. Grant's various attempts at speculation ventures failed in his effort to support Julia and his family. While stationed at Fort Humboldt Grant became lonely and depressed and he began to drink. After accusations of drunkenness while on duty at Fort Humboldt, Grant was compelled to resign and returned to Missouri and his family. Six years of civilian life were difficult for Grant, as he had little aptitude for business or farming, and was devastated by the [[Panic of 1857]]. In 1859, the family moved again, to [[Galena, Illinois]], where Grant had a job as a clerk in his father's leather shop. He worked there until 1861, when the [[American Civil War]] began.

==Ancestry==
Grant was of [[English people|English]] and [[Ulster Scots people|Ulster Scots]] ancestry; his immigrant ancestor Mathew Grant arrived with [[Puritans]] from England in the 1630s.{{sfn|Brands|2012|p=7}} Grant's paternal grandmother Suzanna Delano, of French origin, was the granddaughter of Jonathan Delano (1647–1720), 7th child of [[Philip Delano|Philippe de La Noye]] (1602–1681). Philippe was descended from the illustrious [[Delannoy|House of Lannoy]], and was one of the ''[[Fortune (Plymouth Colony ship)|Fortune]]'''s passengers who landed at Plymouth in November 1621, joining the first settlers of the ''[[Mayflower]]''. The offspring of the paternal uncle of Suzanna, Thomas Delano (born 1704), gave a few decades later another president of the United States, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwwrobinsongenealogy.blogspot.fr/2012/09/connected-to-ulysses-s-grant-and.html Connected to Ulysses S.

==Early life and family==
[[File:Jesse and Hannah Grant.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Grant's parents Jesse and Hannah Grant&lt;br&gt;Photo ''1870'']]
Hiram Ulysses Grant was born in [[Point Pleasant, Ohio]] on April 27, 1822.{{sfn|Chernow|2017|p=3}} Point Pleasant was located in the southwestern corner of Ohio near [[Cincinnati]].{{sfn|Chernow|2017|p=3}} His father [[Jesse Root Grant]] (1794–1873) was a self-reliant [[Tanner (occupation)|tanner]] and businessman, and his mother was Hannah (Simpson) Grant (1798–1883).{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=21–22}} Grant was Jesse's and Hannah's first child.{{sfn|White|2016|p=9}} Both Jessie and Hanna were natives of Pennsylvania.{{sfn|White|2016|pp=6,8}} In the fall of 1823, the family moved to the village of [[Georgetown, Ohio|Georgetown]] in [[Brown County, Ohio]].

At the age of five, young Grant began his formal education, starting at a subscription school and later was enrolled in two private schools.{{sfnm|McFeely|1981|1p=497|White|2016|2pp=16, 18}} In the winter of 1836–1837, Grant was a student at [[John Brett Richeson House#Maysville Academy|Maysville Seminary]], and in the autumn of 1838 he attended [[John Rankin (abolitionist)|John Rankin]]'s academy. Raised in a [[Methodist]] family devoid of religious pretentiousness, Grant prayed privately and was not an official member of the church.{{sfnm|Farina||1pp=13–14|Simpson|2000|2pp=2–3}} Unlike his younger siblings, Grant was neither disciplined, baptized, nor forced to attend church by his parents.{{sfn|Longacre|2006|pp=6–7}} One of his biographers suggests that Grant inherited a degree of introversion from his reserved, even "uncommonly detached" mother (she did not visit the White House during her son's presidency).{{sfn|McFeely|1981|p=8}} Grant assumed the duties expected of him as a young man at home, which primarily included maintaining the firewood supply; he thereby developed a noteworthy ability to work with, and control, horses in his charge, and used this in providing transportation as a vocation in his youth.{{sfn|McFeely|1981|p=10}}

== West Point (1839–1843) ==
[[image:ThomasLHamer.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Congressman Thomas L. Hamer nominated Grant to West Point.]]
At the age of 17, with the help of his father, Grant was nominated by Congressman [[Thomas L. Hamer]] for a position at the [[United States Military Academy]] (USMA) at [[West Point, New York]]. Hamer mistakenly nominated him as "Ulysses S. Grant of Ohio". At West Point, he adopted this name with a middle initial only. His nickname became "Sam" among army colleagues at the academy since the initials "U.S." also stood for "Uncle Sam". The "S", according to Grant, did not stand for anything, though Hamer had used it to abbreviate his mother's maiden name.{{sfnm|McFeely|1981|1p=12|Smith|2001|2pp=24, 83}} The influence of Grant's family brought about the appointment to West Point, while Grant himself later recalled "a military life had no charms for me".{{sfn|McFeely|1981|p=16}} Grant, stood 5 feet 1&amp;nbsp;inches and weighed 117&amp;nbsp;lbs, when he entered West Point.{{sfn|McFeely|1981|p=13}} Grant later said that he was lax in his studies, but he achieved above average grades in mathematics and geology.{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=26–28}} Although Grant had a quiet nature, he did establish a few intimate friends at West Point, including [[Frederick Tracy Dent]] and [[Rufus Ingalls]].{{sfnm|McFeely|1981|1p=20|Longacre|2006|2p=18}} He joined a fraternity group known as the ''Twelve in One'', and was highly esteemed by his classmates.{{sfn|Longacre|2006|pp=18, 21}} While not excelling scholastically, Grant studied under [[Romanticism|Romantic]] artist [[Robert Walter Weir]] and produced nine surviving artworks.{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=26–28}} He also established a reputation as a fearless and expert horseman, setting an equestrian high-jump record that stood almost 25 years.{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=26–28}} He graduated in 1843, ranking 21st in a class of 39. Grant later recalled that his departure from West Point was of the happiest of his times and that he had intended to resign his commission after serving the minimum term of obligated duty.{{sfn|McFeely|1981|pp=16, 19}} Despite his excellent horsemanship, he was not assigned to the cavalry, as assignments were determined by class rank, not aptitude.{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=26–28}} Grant was instead assigned as a regimental quartermaster, managing supplies and equipment in the [[4th Infantry Regiment (United States)|4th Infantry Regiment]], with the rank of brevet [[second lieutenant]].{{sfnm|Smith|2001|1pp=26–28|Longacre|2006|2p=24}}

== First assignment (1843–1846) ==
Grant's first assignment after graduation took him to the [[Jefferson Barracks]] near [[St. Louis, Missouri]].{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=28–29}} After recuperating from an illness that left him thin and weak, Grant reported there in September 1843.{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=28–29}} It was the nation's largest military bastion in the West, commanded by Colonel [[Stephen W. Kearny]]. Grant was happy with his new commander, but still looked forward to the end of his military service and a possible teaching career.{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=30–33}} Grant spent some of his time in Missouri visiting the family of his West Point classmate, Frederick Dent, and getting to know Dent's sister, [[Julia Boggs Dent|Julia]]; the two became secretly engaged in 1844.{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=30–33}}

==Mexican–American War (1846–1848)==
[[File:Brevet Second Lieutenant Ulysses S. Grant in 1843.jpg|thumb|left|150px|alt= Engraving of young Grant in uniform |Second lieutenant U.S. Grant in 1843]]

Rising tensions with Mexico saw Grant's unit shifted to Louisiana that year as a part of the [[Army of Observation]] under [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Zachary Taylor]].{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=35–37}} President [[James K Polk]] ordered Taylor south to force the Mexican government to bargain over disputed territory between the United States and Mexico.{{sfn|White|2016|pp=66–67}} Grant was in charge of securing hundreds of mules in preparation for the move south.{{sfn|White|2016|p=67}} Grant purchased the mules from Mexicans and had the mules branded, but the mules resisted being broken to wear a saddle and pack. {{sfn|White|2016|p=67}} Taylor took notice of Grant when Grant jumped in the water to help his men remove oyster beds so ships could advance from Aransas Bay to Corpus Christi, saying he wished he "had more officers like Grant." {{sfn|White|2016|p=67}} On March 11, 1846, Grant's Fourth Infantry, part of the Third Battalion, left Corpus Christi, first traveling west and then veering south. {{sfn|White|2016|p=67}} Having reached the Rio Grand, both the Mexican and American armies spied on each other.{{sfn|White|2016|p=67}} On April 25, the [[Mexican–American War]] broke out when Mexican troops fired on and killed 11 American troops, Commanded by Captain Seth Thorton, at Rancho de Carricitos. {{sfn|White|2016|pp=67–68}} Defending Fort Texas on the Rio Grande, Taylor's army advanced on Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma.

[[image:Battle of Monterrey.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Monterey street fighting during the Mexican–American War.&lt;br&gt;''September 1846'']]

Grant's first battle experience came at the [[Battle of Palo Alto]] against a substantial Mexican force that intended to flank and attack the American army. {{sfn|White|2016|p=71}} Grant did not panic and readied his 1822 musket when Taylor ordered two large artillery guns that fired on the Mexican army, who retreated. {{sfn|White|2016|pp=71–72}} The next day the American army followed the retreating Mexican army to Resaca de la Palma.{{sfn|White|2016|pp=73–74}}Not content with his responsibilities as a quartermaster, Grant made his way to the front lines to engage in the battle, and participated as a ''de facto'' cavalryman at the [[Battle of Resaca de la Palma]].{{sfn|McFeely|1981|pp=32–33}} Grant led his company in a charge capturing a Mexican officer and a few of his men, Grant's first victory.{{sfn|White|2016|pp=73–74}} Grant later realized the ground he gained and his captives had earlier been won in the battle.{{sfn|White|2016|pp=73–74}}

Crossing the Rio Grand, the United States army continued its advance into Mexico. Thousands of American volunteers were incorporated into the U.S. military serving alongside the regular army, including Thomas Hamer, who had nominated Grant to West Point.{{sfn|White|2016|pp=78–79}} Starting in September, Taylor and his Army of Invasion, moved south and engaged the Mexican army at the [[Battle of Monterrey]].{{sfn|White|2016|p=78}} During the battle, Grant demonstrated his equestrian ability, carrying a dispatch through Monterrey's sniper-lined streets on horseback while mounted in one stirrup.{{sfn|Longacre|2006|pp=37–42}}

President [[James K. Polk]], wary of Taylor's growing popularity, divided his army, sending some troops (including Grant's unit) to form a new army under Maj. Gen. [[Winfield Scott]].{{sfn|McFeely|1981|pp=34–35}} Scott's army landed at [[Veracruz]] and advanced toward [[Mexico City]]. The army met the Mexican forces at battles of [[Battle of Molino del Rey|Molino del Rey]] and [[Battle of Chapultepec|Chapultepec]] outside Mexico City. At the latter battle, Grant dragged a howitzer into a church steeple to bombard nearby Mexican troops.{{sfn|McFeely|1981|pp=36–37}} Scott's army was soon into the city, and the Mexicans agreed to peace not long after.

In his memoirs, indicating he had learned extensively by closely observing the decisions and actions of his commanding officers, particularly admiring Taylor's methods, and in retrospect identified himself with Taylor's style. At the time he felt that the war was a wrongful one and believed that territorial gains were designed to spread slavery throughout the nation; writing in 1883, Grant said "I was bitterly opposed to the measure, and to this day, regard the war, which resulted, as one of the most unjust ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation." He also opined that the later Civil War was inflicted on the nation as punishment for its aggression in Mexico.{{sfn|McFeely|1981|pp=31, 37}}

==Marriage and family==
On August 22, 1848, after a four-year engagement, Grant and Julia were married.{{sfn|McFeely|1981|pp=20, 26}} He and Julia would go on to have four children: [[Frederick Dent Grant]]; [[Ulysses S. Grant, Jr.|Ulysses S. "Buck" Grant, Jr.]]; [[Ellen Wrenshall Grant|Ellen Wrenshall "Nellie" Grant]]; and [[Jesse Root Grant]].{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=73}} The couple corresponded during his service in Mexico; in one letter Julia shared with him a very pleasurable dream she had of him in a beard, which he was then sporting upon his return after the war.{{sfn|McFeely|1981|p=34}}

==Extended military service (1848–1854)==
[[File:SanFranciscoharbor1851c sharp.jpg|right|thumb|220px|San Francisco harbor during the California Gold Rush.&lt;br&gt;''1850–1851'']]
Although Grant received promotions during the [[Mexican–American War]], the peacetime army offered little for a young officer's advancement.{{sfn|Simon|2002|p=242}} Lieutenant Grant was assigned to several different posts over the ensuing six years. His first post-war assignments took him and Julia to [[Detroit]] and [[Sackets Harbor, New York]], the location that made them the happiest. In the spring of 1852, he traveled in to Washington, D.C. in a failed attempt to prevail upon the Congress to rescind an order that he, in his capacity as quartermaster, reimburse the military $1000 in losses incurred on his watch, for which he bore no personal guilt.{{sfn|McFeely|1981|p=46}} He was sent west to [[Vancouver Barracks|Fort Vancouver]] in the [[Oregon Territory]] in 1852, initially landing in [[San Francisco]] during the height of the [[California Gold Rush]]. Julia could not accompany him as she was eight months pregnant with their second child; further, a lieutenant's salary would not support a family on the frontier.{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=76–77}} The journey proved to be an ordeal due to transportation disruptions and an outbreak of [[cholera]] within the entourage while traveling overland through Panama. Grant made use of his organizational skills, arranging makeshift transportation and hospital facilities to take care of the sick. There were 150 4th Infantry fatalities including Grant's long-time friend John H. Gore.{{sfn|McFeely|1981|p=47}} After Grant arrived in San Francisco he traveled to Fort Vancouver, continuing his service as quartermaster; }side note to the war/{Mr.Jeans, senator of Pennsylvania at the time, also provided the North with supplies such as section reviews} [[Pacific Northwest]] between settlers and Indians in the aftermath of the [[Cayuse War]].

While on assignment out west and in an effort to supplement a military salary inadequate to support his family, Grant, assuming his work as quartermaster so equipped him, attempted but failed at several business ventures.{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=81–82}} The business failures in the West confirmed Jesse Grant's belief that his son had no head for business, creating frustration for both father and son. In at least one case Grant had even naively allowed himself to be swindled by a partner.{{sfn|McFeely|1981|pp=48–49}} These failures, along with the separation from his family, made for quite an unhappy soldier, husband and son. Rumors began to circulate that Grant was drinking in excess.{{sfn|McFeely|1981|pp=48–49}}

In the summer of 1853, Grant was promoted to [[Captain (U.S. Army)|captain]], one of only fifty on active duty, and assigned to command Company F, 4th Infantry, at [[Fort Humboldt State Historic Park|Fort Humboldt]], on the northwest California coast. Without explanation, he shortly thereafter resigned from the army on July 31, 1854. The commanding officer at Fort Humboldt, brevet Lieutenant Colonel [[Robert C. Buchanan]], a strict disciplinarian, had reports that Grant was intoxicated off duty while seated at the pay officer's table.{{sfn|Longacre|2006|pp=55–58}} Buchanan had previously warned Grant several times to stop his drinking.{{sfn|Longacre|2006|pp=55–58}} In lieu of a court-martial, Buchanan gave Grant an ultimatum to sign a drafted resignation letter.{{sfn|Longacre|2006|pp=55–58}} Grant resigned; the War Department stated on his record, "Nothing stands against his good name."{{sfn|Longacre|2006|pp=55–58}} Rumors, however, persisted in the regular army of Grant's intemperance. According to biographer McFeely, historians overwhelmingly agree that his intemperance at the time was a fact, though there are no eyewitness reports extant.{{sfn|McFeely|1981|p=55}} Two of Grant's lieutenants corroborated this incident and Buchanan confirmed it to another officer in a conversation during the Civil War. {{sfnm|Smith|2001|1pp=87–88|Lewis|2pp=328–332}} Historian [[Jean Edward Smith]] says, "The story rings true.{{sfnm|Smith|2001|1pp=86–87|White|2016|2pp=118–120|McFeely|1981|3p=55}} Jean Edward Smith maintains Grant's resignation was too sudden to be a calculated decision.{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=87}} Historian William McFeely said that Grant left the army simply because he was "profoundly depressed" and that the evidence as to how much and how often Grant drank remains elusive.{{sfn|McFeely|1981|p=55}} Buchanan never mentioned it again until asked about it during the Civil War.{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=88}} The effects and extent of Grant's drinking on his military and public career are debated by historians.{{sfn|Farina|2007|p=202}} Lyle Dorsett said Grant was an "alcoholic" but functioned amazingly well. William Farina maintains Grant's devotion to family kept him from drinking to excess and sinking into debt.{{sfnm|Farina|2007|1pp=13, 202|Dorsett|1983}}

Years later after his resignation, Grant told [[John Eaton (General)|John Eaton]], "the vice of intemperance had not a little to do with my decision to resign."{{sfnm|Smith|2001|1pp=87–88|Lewis|2pp=328–332}} Grant's father, again believing his son's only potential for success to be in the military, tried to get the Secretary of War to rescind the resignation, to no avail.{{sfn|McFeely|1981|p=57}}

==Civilian life, poverty, and struggles (1854–1861)==

At age 32, with no civilian vocation, Grant began to struggle through seven financially lean years and poverty.{{sfn|Simon|2002|pp=241–242}} His father, Jesse, initially offered Grant a position in the Galena, Illinois branch of the tannery business, on condition that Julia and the children, for economic reasons, stay with her parents in Missouri, or Grant's in Kentucky. Ulysses and Julia were adamantly opposed to another separation, and declined the offer.{{sfn|McFeely|1981|pp=58–60}} In 1854, Grant farmed on his brother-in-law's property near St. Louis, using slaves owned by Julia's father, but it did not succeed.{{sfn|McFeely|1981|pp=58–60}} Two years later, Grant and family moved to a section of his father-in-law's farm; to give his family a home, built a house he called "Hardscrabble".{{sfn|McFeely|1981|pp=58–60}} Julia hated the rustic house, which she described as an "unattractive cabin".{{sfn|McFeely|1981|pp=58–60}} During this time, Grant also acquired a slave from Julia's father, a thirty-five-year-old man named William Jones.{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=94–95}} Having met with no success farming, the Grants left the farm when their fourth and final child was born in 1858. Grant freed his slave in 1859 instead of selling him, at a time when slaves commanded a high price and Grant needed money badly.{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=94–95}} For the next year, the family took a small house in St. Louis where he worked, again without success, with Julia's cousin Harry Boggs, as a bill collector.{{sfn|McFeely|1981|p=64}} In 1860 Jesse offered him the job in his tannery in [[Galena, Illinois]], without condition, which Ulysses accepted. The leather shop, "Grant &amp; Perkins", sold harnesses, saddles, and other leather goods and purchased hides from farmers in the prosperous Galena area. He moved his family to Galena before that year.{{sfn|McFeely|1981|pp=65–66}}

Although unopposed to slavery at the time, Grant kept his political opinions private and never endorsed any candidate running for public office before the Civil War.{{sfn|McFeely|1981|p=69}} His father-in-law was a prominent [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] in Missouri, a factor that helped derail Grant's bid to become county engineer in 1859, while his own father was an outspoken [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]].{{sfn|Welles|1881|pp=xi–xii}} In the 1856 election, Grants cast his first presidential vote for the Democratic candidate [[James Buchanan]], saying he was really voting against Fremont, the Republican candidate.{{sfn|McFeely|1981|p=69}} In 1860, he favored the Democratic presidential candidate [[Stephen A. Douglas]] over [[Abraham Lincoln]], and Lincoln over the alternate Democratic candidate, [[John C. Breckinridge]]. Lacking the residency requirements in Illinois at the time, he could not vote. By August 1863, during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], after the fall of [[Vicksburg Campaign|Vicksburg]], Grant's political sympathies fully coincided with the [[Radical Republicans]]' aggressive prosecution of the war and for the abolition of slavery.{{sfn|Catton|p=8}}

'''Edward Langworthy''' (1738&amp;ndash;1802) was an American teacher who was a delegate to the [[Continental Congress]] from [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. He signed the [[Articles of Confederation]].

Edward was born in [[Savannah, Georgia]] in 1738. Nothing is known of his ancestors since he was a [[Child abandonment|foundling]]. He was raised in the Bethesda Orphan House at Savannah, and educated in the school there. He later taught in that same school. Since he was born only five years after [[James Oglethorpe]] shipped the first colonists to Georgia, it is likely that his parents were included with those recruited from debtors' prisons or poorhouses.

Langworthy began working with Georgia's ''Committee of Safety'', and was their secretary when they became a revolutionary ''Council of Safety'' on December 11, 1775. The Georgia assembly sent him to the Continental Congress in 1777, and he arrived just in time to sign the Articles of Confederation. He served in the Congress until 1779.

Edward moved to [[Baltimore, Maryland]] in 1785. He married a young lady named Wright, and the couple had four children. He also bought a part interest in a newspaper ''The Maryland Journal &amp; Baltimore Advertiser'' and became its editor. In 1787 he sold his interest, and became an instructor at the Baltimore Academy.

In 1795 Langworthy was made the clerk of customs for Baltimore, a post he held until his death. He died of [[Yellow fever]] on November 2, 1802 and was buried at the Old Episcopal Church. The church was torn down in 1891, and details of any re-interment are unknown.

She was also the [[Deputy Prime Minister]] of Romania.

==Background==
She was born Lenuța Petrescu into a peasant family in [[Petreşti, Dâmboviţa|Petrești]] [[Communes of Romania|commune]], [[Dâmboviţa County|Dâmbovița County]], in the historical region of [[Wallachia]]. Her father worked as a [[plough|ploughman]]. She was only able to acquire an [[elementary school]] level education. After elementary school, she moved along with her brother to [[Bucharest]], where she worked as a laboratory assistant before finding employment in a textile factory. She joined the Bucharest branch of the [[Romanian Communist Party]] in 1939 and met 21-year-old Nicolae Ceaușescu. Ceaușescu was instantly attracted to her which, reportedly, made him never look at another woman in a romantic manner.&lt;ref name=Revolution1989&gt;{{cite book|last=Sebetsyen|first=Victor|title=Revolution 1989: The Fall of the Soviet Empire|publisher=[[Pantheon Books]]|location=New York City|year=2009|isbn=0-375-42532-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their relationship was interrupted by Ceaușescu's frequent stints in prison, but they finally married on 23 December 1947.

==Career in government==
[[File:1975 Elena Ceausescu Honoris Causa Manilla.jpg|thumb|Elena Ceaușescu receiving an honorary doctorate in [[Manila]] (1975).]]
After the Communists took power, Ceaușescu worked as a secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and was an unimportant figure until her husband became general secretary of the party. Starting in July 1972, Elena Ceaușescu was given various offices at senior levels in the [[Romanian Communist Party]]. In June 1973 she became a member of the Politburo of the Romanian Communist Party, becoming the second most important and influential person after Ceauşescu himself.  She was deeply involved in party administration alongside her husband, and was one of the few spouses of a Communist Party boss to have a high political profile of her own.

Ceaușescu frequently accompanied her husband on official visits abroad. During a state visit to the [[People's Republic of China]] in June 1971, she took note of how [[Jiang Qing]], Chairman [[Mao Zedong]]'s wife, maintained a position of real power. Most likely inspired by this, she began to engineer her own political rise in Romania. In July 1971, after a [[July Theses|mini-cultural revolution]] launched by her husband, she was elected a member of the Central Commission on Socio-Economic Forecasting, and in July 1972, she became a full member of the Romanian Communist Party Central Committee. In June 1973, after having been nominated by [[Emil Bodnăraş|Emil Bodnăraș]], she was elected to the party's Executive Committee. In November 1974, at the 11th Party Congress, she was made a member of the (renamed) political executive committee, and in January 1977, she became a member of the highest party body, the Permanent Bureau of the Political Executive Committee. In March 1975, she was elected to the [[Great National Assembly]], the country's national legislature, holding the seat for [[Pitești]], [[Arges County]], the most important industrial region of the country, until her death in 1989.  In March 1980, she was made a First Deputy Prime Minister, a state title she also held until she was executed in the [[Romanian Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://files.osa.ceu.hu/holdings/300/8/3/text/53-8-63.shtml Enhanced Personality Cult for Elena Ceausescu]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} 1986-1-8&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1975 Ceausescus Tokio Hirohito.jpg|thumb|left|Elena and [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] with Emperor [[Hirohito]] during a visit in Tokyo in 1975]]
From the early 1980s onward, Elena was the object of a [[Nicolae Ceaușescu's cult of personality|personality cult]] as intense as that of her husband, which exalted her as the "Mother of the Nation." By all accounts, her vanity and desire for honours exceeded that of her husband. As with her husband, [[Romanian Television]] was under strict orders to take great care portraying her on screen. For instance, she was never supposed to be shown in profile because of her large nose and overall homely appearance.&lt;ref name=Revolution1989&gt;{{cite book|last=Sebetsyen|first=Victor|title=Revolution 1989: The Fall of the Soviet Empire|publisher=[[Pantheon Books]]|location=New York City|year=2009|isbn=0-375-42532-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fall from power==
{{main|Romanian Revolution|Trial of Nicolae and Elena Ceaușescu}}
Ceaușescu fled with her husband on 22 December 1989, after the events in [[Timișoara]] led to the [[Romanian Revolution]], but she and her husband were captured in the town of [[Târgoviște|Targoviste]].  At the show trial that took place, she answered only a few questions since her husband took a protective role, asked her to calm down and shook his head each time her mouth opened to reply in anger.

==Execution==
On the afternoon of 25 December 1989, (Christmas Day) in [[Târgovişte|Târgoviște]] they were turned over to a firing squad and executed. Her arms, and those of her husband, were tied behind their backs. Popular history author [[Simon Sebag Montefiore]] has claimed that, before the sentences were carried out, Elena reacted far more belligerently than her husband, allegedly screaming: "You motherfucking assholes!" while being led up against the wall; at the same time Nicolae Ceaușescu sang "[[The Internationale]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Montefiore|first=Simon Sebag|title=101 Villains from Vlad the Impaler to Adolf Hitler: History's Monsters|year=2008|publisher=Metro Books|isbn=978-1-4351-0937-7|page=274}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their actual execution was not filmed in time – the firing squad was in a hurry to carry out the sentence – but the aftermath, including echoes of the final volley, the pall of smoke, and the bodies immediately afterwards, were caught on camera. She was 73 years old.&lt;ref&gt;Juan J.

Ceaușescu was outlived by her mother, a near centenarian at the time of her death, her brother Gheorghe Petrescu (also an important figure in the party) and her three children: [[Valentin Ceauşescu|Valentin]] (b. 1948), [[Zoia Ceauşescu|Zoia]] (1949–2006) and [[Nicu Ceauşescu|Nicu]] (1951–1996), who was also a very important member of the Romanian Communist Party. Elena Ceaușescu was buried in [[Ghencea Cemetery]].

==Reputation as a chemical researcher==
After graduating from primary school in her village and moving to Bucharest, Ceaușescu attempted to continue her education through [[Night school|night courses]], but was [[Expulsion (education)|expelled]] after being caught cheating.&lt;ref name="ceausescu.org"&gt;http://www.ceausescu.org/ceausescu_texts/elena_ceausescus_cult.htm&lt;/ref&gt; As such, her formal education was minimal. Despite this, during the communist period she was promoted as a scientist, and was also awarded a [[PhD]] in chemistry.&lt;ref name="ceausescu.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.gandul.info/articol_34827/piesa_rara__teza_de_doctorat_a_elenei_ceausescu.html ''Piesă rară: teza de doctorat a Elenei Ceauşescu'' ("Unique: the PhD Thesis of Elena Ceauşescu")], in [[Gândul]], 26 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957 she was a research scientist at ICECHIM (National Institute for Chemical Research). In the early 1960s she was reported to be secretary of the party committee of the Bucharest Central Institute of Chemical Researches, and, when her husband took over the party leadership in March 1965, she was listed as the institute's director. In December of the same year, she was elected a member of the newly established National Council of Scientific Research, and in September 1966 she was awarded the Order of Scientific Merit First Class.&lt;ref name=rep45&gt;René de Flers, "Biographical Sketches of the Ceausescu Clan." (RAD Background Report/135 (Romania); 27 July 1984) ''[[Radio Free Europe]]/Radio Liberty Background Reports'', p.4. [http://files.osa.ceu.hu/holdings/300/8/3/text/53-6-20.shtml Open Society Archives of Central European University] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071231073818/http://files.osa.ceu.hu/holdings/300/8/3/text/53-6-20.shtml |date=31 December 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1974, she was made a member of the Romanian Academy's Section for Chemical Sciences. Ceaușescu was given many honorary awards for scientific achievement in the field of [[polymer]] [[chemistry]] during the period when her husband ruled [[Romania]].

After the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|Revolution of 1989]], several scientists have claimed that Ceaușescu had forced them to write papers in her name.&lt;ref name=Revolution1989/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22E.+Ceau%C8%99escu%22&amp;btnG=&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C44 Elena Ceaușescu on Google Scholar&lt;/ref&gt; Claims have also arisen that the university gave her the honour of the doctorate solely because of her political position.

Most respected academic institutions and universities in the West refused to acknowledge her alleged academic merit.&lt;ref name="Shaw82"&gt;{{cite book |last= Shaw |first= Karl |title= Power Mad! |trans-title= Šílenství mocných |edition= |year= 2005 |origyear= 2004 |publisher= Metafora |location= Praha |language= Czech |isbn= 80-7359-002-6 |page= 82 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was made a member of the Illinois Academy of Sciences. Ceaușescu later responded by saying that she never heard of [[Illinois]] and made an antisemitic remark about the President of the Academy of Sciences at the time, the chemist [[Emanuel Merdinger]]. She allegedly obtained her awards with money, instead of merit.&lt;ref name="Shaw82"/&gt;

According to a 1984 report by [[Radio Free Europe]], "It is rumored that, at the time when she wanted to receive her doctorate from the Bucharest Faculty of Chemistry, she met with strong opposition from the Romanian chemist [[Costin D. Nenitescu]], the dean of the faculty. She was forced instead to present her thesis to Cristofor Simionescu and Ioan Ursu at the University of Iasi, where she met with complete success."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=de Flers|first=Rene|title=RAD Background Report/135 (Romania) 27 July 1984 BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES OF THE CEAUSESCU CLAN|url=http://files.osa.ceu.hu/holdings/300/8/3/text/53-6-20.shtml|publisher=Radio Free Europe|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603045842/http://files.osa.ceu.hu/holdings/300/8/3/text/53-6-20.shtml|archivedate=3 June 2009|pages=5|date=27 July 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In summary, to quote from an article on [[plagiarism]] in the leading scientific journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'':
{{quote|"...Elena Ceauşescu did not have a BSc, but the power of her husband Nicolae – Romania's dictator until communism fell – still made sure that the University of Bucharest awarded her a PhD in chemistry. The contents of her many scientific papers were penned by others."&lt;ref name="nature2012"&gt;{{cite journal| title=Repeat after me | date=16 August 2012 | volume=488 | issue=7411 | journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | page=253 | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v488/n7411/full/488253a.html | doi=10.1038/488253a}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

She was sometimes nicknamed "Codoi", referring to her alleged mispronunciation of the name of the chemical compound [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub &gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] (C for carbon, O for oxygen, and "doi" being Romanian for "two"). She was mocked by many, including an official who called her by this nickname during her show trial.&lt;ref&gt;Trecutul de langa noi, [http://www.lumeam.ro/nr10_2003/trecutul_de_langa_noi2.html Lumea. nr. 10] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051125085511/http://www.lumeam.ro/nr10_2003/trecutul_de_langa_noi2.html |date=25 November 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jela, Doina.

The [[beatification|Blessed]] '''Elizabeth of Reute, [[Third Order of St. Francis#Third Order Regular of St. Francis|T.O.R.]]''', (also known as ''Betha the Good; Betha von Reute; Elisabeth Acheer; Elisabeth Achlin; Elisabeth Bona von Reute; Elisabeth den Gode; Elisabeth the Good; Elizabeth Acheer; Elizabeth of Reute; Elizabeth the Good; Elizabeth the Recluse; Elsbeth Achler; Elsbeth Achlin; Elsbeth von Reute'') (November 25, 1386 - November 25, 1420) was a [[Germany|German]] Franciscan [[Third Order|tertiary]] [[Religious sister|sister]] who is [[veneration|venerated]] as a [[mysticism|mystic]] and as having borne the [[Stigmata]].

==Life==
Elizabeth was born on November 25, 1386 to Hans and Anna Achler in [[Bad Waldsee|Waldsee]] in the region of [[Upper Swabia]] (an historic and linguistic region in Germany).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kloster-reute.de/818.0.html Franziskanerrinen von Reute "Gute Beth"]{{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was raised in a pious home, hearing the [[Gospels]] explained to her by her mother in the form of stories, where she developed a strong devotion to the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion of Christ]]. She became a member of the [[Third Order of St. Francis]] at the age of fourteen. Seeking to further her spiritual growth, she took as her [[confessor]] the [[provost (religion)|provost]] of the local [[Canonry]] of St. Peter in Waldsee, [[Dom (title)|Dom]] Konrad Kügelin (1366-1428).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kloester-bw.de/klostertexte.php?kreis=&amp;bistum=&amp;alle=&amp;ungeteilt=&amp;art=&amp;orden=&amp;orte=&amp;buchstabe=&amp;nr=674&amp;thema=Geschichte Klöster in Baden-Wüttermberg "Geschicte"]{{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under his guidance, she and several other girls who belonged to that Franciscan fraternity sought to follow a more intense experience of their Franciscan [[vocation]]. To this end, they acquired a house in [[Reute]] on the outskirts of Waldsee in 1403.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kloster-reute.de/819.0.html Franziskanerrinen von Reute "Die Gute Beth von Reute: Ein Weg bewegt"]{{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This community was a proto-monastery of the Order, as tertiaries of the [[mendicant order]]s had not yet been allowed to [[profession|profess]] vows. Elizabeth threw herself into a life of prayer and service, working in the cloister kitchen and in the garden, where she would spend long hours in prayer.&lt;ref name=Mershman&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05391b.htm Mershman, Francis. "Blessed Elizabeth of Reute." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 5. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 18 June 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

She was known for her hospitality to visitors to the little monastery, especially for her concern for the poor who came to the gate to beg. Her love of the [[Blessed Sacrament]] was so great that she lived the last twelve years of her life subsisting solely on the [[Eucharist in the Catholic Church|consecrated hosts]].&lt;ref&gt;"Ein Weg bewegt"&lt;/ref&gt; She died on her birthday in 1420.

Her head is said to have showed the marks of the [[crown of thorns]] worn by [[Christ]], and her body the marks of Christ's [[scourging]]. Although [[Stigmata]] only occasionally appeared on her hands, she always felt its pain.  She was credited with the gift of [[prophecy]] foretelling the election of [[Pope Martin V]] and the end of the Great [[Western Schism]].&lt;ref name=Mershman/&gt;

==Veneration==
She was buried in the [[parish church]] of Reute.  A [[biography]] of her was written by Kügelin, her confessor, and sent to the Bishop of [[Konstanz]].  However, popular veneration for Elizabeth occurred only after 1623, when her tomb was opened by the then-provost of Waldsee. [[Miracle]]s were attributed to her, which were compiled into a formal document by a contemporary canon, Heinrich Scheffler (d. 1635).&lt;ref&gt;Klöster&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Clement XIII]] officially approved her [[cult (religious practice)#Roman Catholic ''cultus''|''cultus'']] on 19 June 1766.  Her [[calendar of saints|feast day]] is celebrated in Germany on 25 November.&lt;ref name=Mershman/&gt;

'''[[Stanley Donen]]''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɔː|n|ən}} {{respell|DAWN|ən}}&lt;!-- Are we sure it's not  {{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɒ|n|ən}} {{respell|DON|ən}}? --&gt;; born April 13, 1924) is an American film director and choreographer, and occasionally worked in the American theater. He has directed 28 feature films and worked on various other films or television projects, often as a choreographer. He began his career in the chorus line on Broadway for director [[George Abbott]], where he befriended [[Gene Kelly]]. Shortly afterwards he moved to Hollywood and collaborated with Kelly on numerous films as a chorographer until they became co-directors on his feature film debut ''[[On the Town (film)|On the Town]]''. In 1952 Donen and Kelly co-directed the musical ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'', regarded as one of the [[List of films considered the best|greatest films ever made]]. He went on to direct hit films for several decades thereafter, many of which are currently regarded as classics. He has won numerous awards for his life's work, most notably an [[Honorary Academy Award]] in 1998 and a [[Golden Lion#Golden Lion – Honorary Award|Career Golden Lion]] from the [[Venice Film Festival]] in 2004.

A republican, he contributed to the [[Italian unification]] and the creation of the [[Kingdom of Italy]]. He is considered one of the greatest generals of modern times&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iWK7AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA133&amp;dq=Garibaldi+one+of+the+greatest+generals+of+modern+time&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjIxJm7j9HVAhXHC8AKHU0DA5MQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Garibaldi%20one%20of%20the%20greatest%20generals%20of%20modern%20time&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; and one of Italy's "fathers of the fatherland" along with [[Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour]], [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy]] and [[Giuseppe Mazzini]].

Garibaldi is also known as the "''Hero of the Two Worlds''" because of his military enterprises in [[Brazil]], [[Uruguay]] and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sapere.it/sapere/pillole-di-sapere/italia-150/unita-d-italia-giuseppe-garibaldi-eroe-dei-due-mondi.html |title= Unità d'Italia: Giuseppe Garibaldi, l'eroe dei due mondi |date= |website=Sapere.it |language=Italian }}&lt;/ref&gt; He commanded and fought in many military campaigns that led eventually to the [[Italian unification]]. In 1848, the provisional government of [[Milan]] made Garibaldi a general, and in 1849, the Minister of War promoted him to General of the [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] to lead the [[Expedition of the Thousand]] on behalf and with the consent of Victor Emmanuel II. His last military campaign took place during the [[Franco-Prussian War]], as commander of the [[Army of the Vosges]].

Garibaldi was very popular in Italy and abroad, aided by exceptional international media coverage at the time. Many great intellectuals of the time, such as [[Victor Hugo]], [[Alexandre Dumas]], and [[George Sand]], showered him with admiration. The United Kingdom and the United States helped him a great deal, offering him financial and military support in difficult circumstances. In the popular telling of his story, he is associated with the [[Redshirts (Italy)|red shirts]] that his volunteers, the ''Garibaldini'', wore in lieu of a uniform.

Garibaldi was born and christened Joseph-Marie Garibaldi&lt;ref name="sc3"&gt;{{harvsp|Scirocco|2011|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 4 July 1807 in [[Nice]], which had been directly annexed by the [[First French Empire]] in 1805, to the [[Liguria]]n family of Giovanni Domenico Garibaldi from [[Chiavari]]&lt;ref&gt;Baptismal record: "Die 11 d.i (giugno 1766) Dominicus Antonina Filius Angeli Garibaldi q.

Fabris.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1814, the [[Congress of Vienna]] returned Nice to [[Victor Emmanuel I of Sardinia]]; nevertheless, France re-annexed it in 1860 by the [[Treaty of Turin (1860)|Treaty of Turin]], which was ardently opposed by Garibaldi.

Garibaldi's family's involvement in coastal trade drew him to a life at sea. He participated actively in the [[Nizzardo Italians]] community and was certified in 1832 as a [[merchant navy]] captain.

In April 1833 he travelled to [[Taganrog]], Russia, in the schooner ''Clorinda'' with a shipment of oranges. During ten days in port he met Giovanni Battista Cuneo from [[Oneglia]], a politically active immigrant and member of the secret [[Young Italy (historical)|Young Italy]] movement of [[Giuseppe Mazzini]]. Mazzini was an impassioned proponent of Italian unification as a liberal republic through political and social reform. Garibaldi joined the society and took an oath dedicating himself to the struggle to liberate and unify his homeland free from Austrian dominance.
[[File:First meeting between Giuseppe Garibaldi.jpg|thumb|upright|First meeting between Garibaldi and Mazzini]]

In [[Geneva]] during November 1833, Garibaldi met Mazzini, starting a long relationship that later became troublesome. He joined the [[Carbonari]] revolutionary association, and in February 1834 participated in a failed Mazzinian insurrection in [[Piedmont]]. A Genoese court sentenced Garibaldi to death ''in absentia'', and he fled across the border to [[Marseille]].

==South American period==
{{refimprove|section|date=October 2018}}&lt;!--only one paragraph has citations--&gt;
Garibaldi first sailed to [[Beylik of Tunis|Tunisia]] before eventually finding his way to the [[Empire of Brazil]]. Once there, he took up the cause of [[Riograndense Republic|Republic of Rio Grande do Sul]] in its attempt to separate from Brazil, joining the rebels known as the Ragamuffins in the [[Ragamuffin War]].

During this war he met [[Anita Garibaldi|Ana Ribeiro da Silva]], commonly known as ''Anita''. When the Ragamuffins tried to proclaim another republic in the Brazilian province of [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]] in October 1839, she joined him aboard his ship, ''Rio Pardo'', and fought alongside him at the battles of Imbituba and Laguna.

In 1841, Garibaldi and Anita moved to [[Montevideo]], Uruguay, where Garibaldi worked as a trader and [[schoolmaster]]. The couple married in Montevideo the following year. They had four children&lt;ref name=Kleis&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Sascha M. |last=Kleis |title=Der Löwe von Caprera |trans-title=The Lion of Caprera |language=German |work=[[Damals]] |year=2012 |issue=6 |pages=57–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; – Menotti (born 1840), Rosita (born 1843), Teresita (born 1845), and Ricciotti (born 1847). A skilled horsewoman, Anita is said to have taught Giuseppe about the [[gaucho]] culture of southern Brazil and Uruguay. Around this time, he adopted his trademark clothing—the red shirt, [[poncho]], and [[sombrero]] commonly worn by gauchos.

[[File:Garibaldi and his men carrying boats from Los Patos lagoon to Tramandahy lake during the Rio Grande do Sul War..jpg|thumb|left|Garibaldi and his men carrying boats from Los Patos lagoon to Tramandahy lake during the Rio Grande do Sul War]]

In 1842, Garibaldi took command of the Uruguayan fleet and raised an "[[Italian Legion]]" of soldiers known as ''[[Redshirts (Italy)|Redshirts]]'', who wore red, [[blouse]]-type shirts, for the [[Uruguayan Civil War]]. He aligned his forces with the Uruguayan [[Colorado Party (Uruguay)|Colorados]] led by [[Fructuoso Rivera]], who were aligned with the Argentine [[Unitarian Party|Unitarios]]. This faction received some support from the French and British Empires in their struggle against the forces of former Uruguayan president [[Manuel Oribe]]'s [[National Party (Uruguay)|Blancos]], which was also aligned with Argentine [[Federales (Argentina)|Federales]] under the rule of [[Buenos Aires Province|Buenos Aires]] [[caudillo]] [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]].

[[File:BilleteGaribaldi.jpg|thumb|Ten "pesos" banknote, printed in Uruguay in 1887, with the image of Garibaldi; located in the National Historic Museum - House of Joseph Garibaldi, Montevideo, Uruguay]]

The Italian Legion adopted a black flag that represented Italy in mourning, with a volcano at the center that symbolized the dormant power in their homeland. Though contemporary sources don't mention the [[Redshirts (Italy)|red shirts]], popular history asserts that the legion first wore them in Uruguay, getting them from a factory in Montevideo that had intended to export them to the slaughterhouses of [[Argentina]]. These shirts became the symbol of Garibaldi and his followers.

[[File:The Battle of Sant'Antonio, Uruguay in which Garibaldi participated, in 1846.jpg|thumb|The Battle of Sant'Antonio, Uruguay, in which Garibaldi participated in 1846]]
Between 1842 and 1848, Garibaldi [[Uruguayan Civil War#The Great Siege|defended]] Montevideo against forces led by Oribe. In 1845 he managed to occupy [[Colonia del Sacramento]] and [[Martín García Island]], and led the controversial sack of [[Gualeguaychú, Entre Ríos|Gualeguaychú]] during the [[Anglo-French blockade of the Río de la Plata]]. Adopting guerrilla tactics, Garibaldi later achieved two victories during 1846, in the Battle of Cerro and the Battle of San Antonio del Santo.

==Induction to Freemasonry==
Garibaldi joined Freemasonry during his exile, taking advantage of the asylum the lodges offered to political refugees from European countries governed by despotic regimes. At the age of thirty-seven, during 1844, Garibaldi was initiated in the "L'Asil de la Vertud" Lodge of Montevideo. This was an irregular lodge under a Brazilian Freemasonry not recognized by the main international masonic obediences, such as the United Grand Lodge of England or the [[Grand Orient de France]].  While Garibaldi had little use for masonic rituals, he was an active [[Freemasonry|Freemason]] and regarded Freemasonry as a network that united [[progressivism|progressive]] men as brothers both within nations and as a global community. Garibaldi was eventually elected as the Grand Master of the [[Grand Orient of Italy]].&lt;ref name="Garibaldi – the mason"&gt;[http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/biography/garibaldi_g/garibaldi.html Garibaldi – the mason] Translated from Giuseppe Garibaldi Massone by the Grand Orient of Italy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="freemasonry.bcy.ca"&gt;http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/biography/garibaldi_g/garibaldi.html

Garibaldi later regularized his position in 1844, joining the lodge "Les Amis de la Patrie" of Montevideo under the Grand Orient of France.

===1846 Election of Pope Pius IX===
The fate of his homeland, however, continued to concern Garibaldi. The election of [[Pope Pius IX]] in 1846 caused a sensation among Italian patriots, both at home and in exile. Pius's initial reforms seemed to identify him as the liberal pope called for by [[Vincenzo Gioberti]], who went on to lead the unification of Italy. When news of these reforms reached Montevideo, Garibaldi wrote to the Pope: {{quote|If these hands, used to fighting, would be acceptable to His Holiness, we most thankfully dedicate them to the service of him who deserves so well of the Church and of the fatherland. Joyful indeed shall we and our companions in whose name we speak be, if we may be allowed to shed our blood in defence of Pius IX's work of redemption|12 October 1847&lt;ref&gt;A. Werner, ''Autobiography of Giuseppe Garibaldi'', Vol. III, Howard Fertig, New York (1971) p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Mazzini, from exile, also applauded the early reforms of Pius IX. In 1847, Garibaldi offered the [[Papal diplomacy|apostolic nuncio]] at Rio de Janeiro, Bedini, the service of his Italian Legion for the liberation of the peninsula. Then news of an outbreak of revolution in [[Palermo]] in January 1848 and revolutionary agitation elsewhere in Italy encouraged Garibaldi to lead around sixty members of his legion home.

== Return to Italy ==
Garibaldi returned to Italy amidst the turmoil of the [[revolutions of 1848 in the Italian states]] and offered his services to [[Charles Albert of Sardinia]]. The monarch displayed some liberal inclinations, but treated Garibaldi with coolness and distrust. Rebuffed by the Piedmontese, he and his followers crossed into Lombardy where they offered assistance to the provisional government of Milan, which had rebelled against the Austrian occupation. In the course of the following unsuccessful [[First Italian War of Independence]], Garibaldi led his legion to two minor victories at [[Luino]] and [[Morazzone]].

After the crushing Piedmontese defeat at [[Battle of Novara (1849)|Novara]] (23 March 1849), Garibaldi moved to Rome to support the [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Republic]] recently proclaimed in the [[Papal States]], but a French force sent by Louis Napoleon (the future [[Napoleon III]]) threatened to topple it. At Mazzini's urging, Garibaldi took command of the defence of Rome. In fighting near [[Velletri]], [[Achille Cantoni]] saved his life. After Cantoni's death, during the [[Battle of Mentana]], Garibaldi wrote the novel ''Cantoni il volontario'' (Cantoni the Volunteer).

[[File:Giuseppe Garibaldi assedio di Roma.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Giuseppe Garibaldi siege of Rome]]
On 30 April 1849 the Republican army, under Garibaldi's command, defeated a numerically far superior French army. Subsequently, French reinforcements arrived, and the [[Roman Republic (19th century)#French siege|siege of Rome]] began on 1 June. Despite the resistance of the Republican army, the French prevailed on 29 June. On 30 June the Roman Assembly met and debated three options: surrender, continue fighting in the streets, or retreat from Rome to continue resistance from the Apennine mountains. Garibaldi, having entered the chamber covered in blood, made a speech favouring the third option, ending with: ''Ovunque noi saremo, sarà Roma.''&lt;ref&gt;G. C.Hibbert,''Garibaldi and his enemies'', Longmans, London (1965) p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; (Wherever we go, Rome will be there).

The sides negotiated a truce on 1 July, and on 2 July Garibaldi withdrew from Rome with 4,000 troops, and an ambition to rouse popular rebellion against the Austrians in central Italy. The French Army entered Rome on 3 July and reestablished the [[Holy See]]'s temporal power. Garibaldi and his forces, hunted by Austrian, French, Spanish, and [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies|Neapolitan]] troops, fled to the north, intending to reach Venice, where the [[repubblica di San Marco|Venetians were still resisting]] the Austrian siege. After an epic march, Garibaldi took momentary refuge in [[San Marino]], with only 250 men having not abandoned him. Anita, who was carrying their fifth child, died near [[Comacchio]] during the retreat.

===North America and the Pacific===
Garibaldi eventually managed to reach [[Porto Venere]], near [[La Spezia]], but the Piedmontese government forced him to emigrate again.

He went to [[Tangier]], where he stayed with Francesco Carpanetto, a wealthy Italian merchant. Carpanetto suggested that he and some of his associates finance the purchase of a merchant ship, which Garibaldi would command. Garibaldi agreed, feeling that his political goals were, for the moment, unreachable, and he could at least earn his own living.&lt;ref name="Autobio"&gt;{{cite book|first=Giuseppe|last=Garibaldi|title=Autobiography of Giuseppe Garibaldi|publisher=Walter Smith and Innes|year=1889|pages=54–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship was to be purchased in the United States, so Garibaldi went to New York, arriving on 30 July 1850. However, the funds for purchasing a ship were lacking. While in New York, he stayed with various Italian friends, including some exiled revolutionaries. He attended the masonic lodges of New York in 1850, where he met several supporters of democratic internationalism, whose minds were open to socialist thought, and to giving Freemasonry a strong anti-papal stance.&lt;ref name="freemasonry.bcy.ca"/&gt;

The inventor [[Antonio Meucci]] employed Garibaldi in his [[candle]] factory on [[Staten Island]].&lt;ref name="Citycyclopedia"&gt;{{cite book|first=Kenneth T.|last=Jackson|title=The Encyclopedia of New York City|publisher=The New York Historical Society and Yale University Press|year=1995|page=451}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The cottage on Staten Island where he stayed is listed on the U.S. [[National Register of Historic Places]] and is preserved as the [[Garibaldi Memorial]].) Garibaldi was not satisfied with this, and in April 1851 he left New York with his friend
Carpanetto for Central America, where Carpanetto was establishing business operations. They went first to [[Nicaragua]], and then to other parts of the region. Garibaldi accompanied Carpanetto as a companion, not a business partner, and used the name ''Giuseppe Pane''.&lt;ref name="Autobio"/&gt;

Carpanetto went on to [[Lima]], Peru, where a shipload of his goods was due, arriving late in 1851 with Garibaldi. En route, Garibaldi called on [[Andes|Andean]] revolutionary heroine [[Manuela Sáenz]]. At Lima, Garibaldi was generally welcomed. A local Italian merchant, Pietro Denegri, gave him command of his ship ''Carmen'' for a trading voyage across the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]]. Garibaldi took the ''Carmen'' to the [[Chincha Islands]] for a load of [[guano]]. Then on 10 January 1852, he sailed from Peru for [[Canton (Guangzhou)|Canton]], China, arriving in April.&lt;ref name="Autobio"/&gt;

After side trips to [[Xiamen]] and [[Manila]], Garibaldi brought the ''Carmen'' back to Peru via the Indian Ocean and the South Pacific, passing clear around the south coast of Australia. He visited [[Three Hummock Island]] in [[Bass Strait]].&lt;ref name="Autobio"/&gt; Garibaldi then took the ''Carmen'' on a second voyage: to the United States via [[Cape Horn]] with copper from [[Chile]], and also [[wool]]. Garibaldi arrived in Boston, and went on to New York. There he received a hostile letter from Denegri, and resigned his command.&lt;ref name="Autobio"/&gt;  Another Italian, Captain Figari, had just come to the U.S. to buy a ship, and hired Garibaldi to take the ship to Europe. Figari and Garibaldi bought the ''Commonwealth'' in [[Baltimore]], and Garibaldi left New York for the last time in November 1853.&lt;ref name="Citycyclopedia"/&gt; He sailed the ''Commonwealth'' to London, and then to [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] on the [[River Tyne]] for coal.&lt;ref name="Autobio"/&gt;

===Tyneside===
The ''Commonwealth'' arrived on 21 March 1854. Garibaldi, already a popular figure on [[Tyneside]], was welcomed enthusiastically by local working men-though the ''Newcastle Courant'' reported that he refused an invitation to dine with dignitaries in the city. He stayed in Huntingdon Place [[Tynemouth]] for a few days,&lt;ref&gt;http://openplaques.org/plaques/8453&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[South Shields]] on Tyneside for over a month, departing at the end of April 1854. During his stay, he was presented with an inscribed sword, which his grandson [[Giuseppe Garibaldi II]] later carried as a volunteer in British service in the [[Second Boer War]].&lt;ref&gt;Bell, David. ''Ships, Strikes and Keelmen: Glimpses of North-Eastern Social History'', 2001 {{ISBN|1-901237-26-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then sailed to [[Genoa]], where his five years of exile ended on 10 May 1854.&lt;ref name="Autobio"/&gt;

==Second Italian War of Independence==
[[File:Garibaldi in the Alps 1.jpg|thumb|Garibaldi in the Alps]]
Garibaldi returned again to Italy in 1854. Using an [[inheritance]] from the death of his brother, he bought half of the Italian island of [[Caprera]] (north of [[Sardinia]]), devoting himself to agriculture. In 1859, the [[Second Italian War of Independence]] (also known as the Austro-Sardinian War) broke out in the midst of internal plots at the Sardinian government. Garibaldi was appointed [[major general]], and formed a volunteer unit named the [[Hunters of the Alps]] (''Cacciatori delle Alpi''). Thenceforth, Garibaldi abandoned Mazzini's republican ideal of the liberation of Italy, assuming that only the Piedmontese monarchy could effectively achieve it. He and his volunteers won victories over the Austrians at [[Varese]], Como, and other places.

Garibaldi was, however, very displeased, as his home city of Nice (''Nizza'' in Italian) had surrendered to the French in return for crucial military assistance. In April 1860, as deputy for Nice in the Piedmontese parliament at Turin, he vehemently attacked Cavour for ceding Nice and the [[County of Nice]] (''Nizzardo'') to Louis Napoleon, Emperor of France. In the following years, Garibaldi (with other passionate ''[[Nizzardo Italians]]'') promoted the ''[[Italian irredentism]]'' of his ''Nizza'', even with riots (in 1872).

==Campaign of 1860==
{{see also|Expedition of the Thousand}}

[[File:Garibaldi departing on the Expedition of the Thousand in 1860.jpg|left|thumb|Garibaldi departing on the Expedition of the Thousand in 1860]]
On 24 January 1860, Garibaldi married an 18-year-old Lombard woman, Giuseppina Raimondi. Immediately after the wedding ceremony, she informed him that she was pregnant with another man's child and Garibaldi left her the same day.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, Christopher. Garibaldi and His Enemies. New York: Penguin Books, 1987. p.171
&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of April 1860, uprisings in [[Messina, Italy|Messina]] and [[Palermo]] in the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]] provided Garibaldi with an opportunity. He gathered about a thousand volunteers – called ''i Mille'' (the Thousand), or, as popularly known, the [[Redshirts (Italy)|Redshirts]] – in two ships named Il Piemonte and Il Lombardo, and left from [[Genoa]] on 5 May in the evening and landed at [[Marsala]], on the westernmost point of Sicily, on 11 May.

[[File:Battle of Calatafimi.jpg|thumb|Battle of Calatafimi]]
Swelling the ranks of his army with scattered bands of local rebels, Garibaldi led 800 volunteers to victory over an enemy force of 1500 on the hill of [[Calatafimi-Segesta|Calatafimi]] on 15 May. He used the counter-intuitive tactic of an uphill bayonet charge. He saw that the hill was terraced, and the terraces would shelter his advancing men. Though small by comparison with the coming clashes at Palermo, Milazzo and Volturno, this battle was decisive in establishing Garibaldi's power in the island. An apocryphal but realistic story had him say to his lieutenant [[Nino Bixio]], ''Qui si fa l'Italia o si muore'', that is, ''Here we either make Italy, or we die''. In reality, the Neapolitan forces were ill guided, and most of its higher officers had been bought out. The next day, he declared himself [[Dictatorship of Garibaldi|dictator of Sicily]] in the name of [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy]]. He advanced to the outskirts of Palermo, the capital of the island, and launched a [[siege]] on 27 May. He had the support of many inhabitants, who rose up against the garrison—but before they could take the city, reinforcements arrived and bombarded the city nearly to ruins. At this time, a British admiral intervened and facilitated an armistice, by which the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies|Neapolitan]] royal troops and warships surrendered the city and departed. Historians Clough et al. argue that Garibaldi’s Thousand were students, independent artisans, and professionals, not peasants. The support given by Sicilian peasants was from patriotism, but from their hatred of exploitative landlords and oppressive Neapolitan officials. Garibaldi himself had no interest in social revolution, and instead sided with the Sicilian landlords against the rioting peasants.&lt;ref&gt;Shepard B.  Clough et al., ''A History of the Western World'' (1964) p.  948&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Garibaldi--Entrée à Naples.jpg|thumb|left|upright|People cheering as Giuseppe Garibaldi rides into Naples on horseback, 7 September 1860]]
By conquering Palermo, Garibaldi had won a signal victory. He gained worldwide renown and the adulation of Italians. Faith in his prowess was so strong that doubt, confusion, and dismay seized even the Neapolitan court. Six weeks later, he marched against Messina in the east of the island, winning a ferocious and difficult battle at Milazzo. By the end of July, only the citadel resisted.

[[File:REALISM MURAL 19TH.jpg|thumb|Meeting between Giuseppe Garibaldi and Victor Emmanuel II on the bridge of Teano on 26 October 1860]]
Having conquered Sicily, he crossed the [[Strait of Messina]] and marched north. Garibaldi's progress was met with more celebration than resistance, and on 7 September he entered the capital city of [[Naples]], by train. Despite taking Naples, however, he had not to this point defeated the Neapolitan army. Garibaldi's volunteer army of 24,000 was not able to defeat conclusively the reorganized Neapolitan army (about 25,000 men) on 30 September at the [[Battle of Volturnus (1860)|Battle of Volturno]]. This was the largest battle he ever fought, but its outcome was effectively decided by the arrival of the Piedmontese Army. Following this, Garibaldi's plans to march on to Rome were jeopardized by the Piedmontese, technically his ally but unwilling to risk war with France, whose army protected the Pope.  (The Piedmontese themselves had conquered most of the Pope's territories in their march south to meet Garibaldi, but they had deliberately avoided Rome, capital of the Papal state.)  Garibaldi chose to hand over all his territorial gains in the south to the Piedmontese and withdrew to Caprera and temporary retirement. Some modern historians consider the handover of his gains to the Piedmontese as a political defeat, but he seemed willing to see Italian unity brought about under the Piedmontese crown. The meeting at [[Teano]] between Garibaldi and Victor Emmanuel II is the most important event in modern Italian history, but is so shrouded in controversy that even the exact site where it took place is in doubt.

== Aftermath ==
[[File:Giuseppe Garibaldi on Caprera....jpg|thumb|Giuseppe Garibaldi on [[Caprera]] island, Sardinia]]
Garibaldi deeply disliked the Sardinian Prime Minister, [[Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour]]. To an extent, he simply mistrusted Cavour's pragmatism and ''[[realpolitik]]'', but he also bore a personal grudge for Cavour's trading away his home city of Nice to the French the previous year. On the other hand, he felt attracted toward the Piedmontese monarch, who in his opinion had been chosen by Providence for the liberation of Italy. In his famous meeting with [[Victor Emmanuel II]] at [[Teano]] on 26 October 1860, Garibaldi greeted him as [[King of Italy]] and shook his hand. Garibaldi rode into Naples at the king's side on 7 November, then retired to the rocky island of [[Caprera]], refusing to accept any reward for his services.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

At the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]] (in 1861), Garibaldi volunteered his services to President [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Garibaldi was offered a major general’s commission in the U. S. Army through the letter from Secretary of State [[William H. Seward]] to H. S. Sanford, the U. S. Minister at Brussels, July 17, 1861.&lt;ref&gt;Mack Smith, pp. 69-70&lt;/ref&gt; On September 18, 1861, Sanford sent the following reply to Seward:

:He [Garibaldi] said that the only way in which he could render service, as he ardently desired to do, to the cause of the United States, was as Commander-in-chief of its forces, that he would only go as such, and with the additional contingent power—to be governed by events—of declaring the abolition of slavery; that he would be of little use without the first, and without the second it would appear like a civil war in which the world at large could have little interest or sympathy.&lt;ref&gt;Mack Smith, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

These conditions could not be met. On August 6, 1863, after the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] had been issued, Garibaldi wrote to Lincoln, "Posterity will call you the great emancipator, a more enviable title than any crown could be, and greater than any merely mundane treasure".&lt;ref&gt;Mack Smith, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 October 1861, Garibaldi set up the [[International Legion]] bringing together different national divisions of French, [[Poland|Poles]], [[Switzerland|Swiss]], German and other nationalities, with a view not just of finishing the liberation of Italy, but also of their homelands. With the motto "Free from the [[Alps]] to the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]]," the unification movement set its gaze on Rome and Venice. Mazzini was discontented with the perpetuation of monarchial government, and continued to agitate for a republic. Garibaldi, frustrated at inaction by the king, and bristling over perceived snubs, organized a new venture. This time, he intended to take on the Papal States.

== Expedition against Rome ==
{{main|Battle of Aspromonte}}
[[File:The Injured Garibaldi in the Aspromonte Mountains (oil on canvas).jpg|thumb|The Injured Garibaldi in the Aspromonte Mountains (oil on canvas)]]
Garibaldi himself was intensely anti-Catholic and anti-papal. His efforts to overthrow the pope by military action mobilized anti-Catholic support. For example, there were major anti-Catholic riots in his name across Britain in 1862, with the Irish Catholics fighting in defense of their Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald M. MacRaild|title=The Irish Diaspora in Britain, 1750-1939|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jygdBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA178|year=2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|pages=178–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For his role in the United States, see&lt;/ref&gt; Garibaldi's hostility to the Pope's temporal domain was viewed with great distrust by Catholics around the world, and the French emperor [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]] had guaranteed the independence of Rome from Italy by stationing a French garrison in Rome. Victor Emmanuel was wary of the international repercussions of attacking the Papal States, and discouraged his subjects from participating in revolutionary ventures with such intentions. Nonetheless, Garibaldi believed he had the secret support of his government.

In June 1862, he sailed from Genoa to Palermo to gather volunteers for the impending campaign, under the slogan ''Roma o Morte'' (Rome or Death). An enthusiastic party quickly joined him, and he turned for Messina, hoping to cross to the mainland there. He arrived with a force of around two thousand, but the garrison proved loyal to the king's instructions and barred his passage. They turned south and set sail from [[Catania]], where Garibaldi declared that he would enter Rome as a victor or perish beneath its walls. He landed at [[Melito di Porto Salvo|Melito]] on 14 August, and marched at once into the [[Calabria]]n mountains.
[[File:Garibaldi after being wounded on the Aspromonte Massif.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Garibaldi after being wounded on the Aspromonte Massif]]
Far from supporting this endeavor, the Italian government was quite disapproving. General [[Enrico Cialdini]] dispatched a division of the regular army, under Colonel Emilio Pallavicini, against the volunteer bands. On 28 August the [[Battle of Aspromonte|two forces met]] in the rugged [[Aspromonte]]. One of the regulars fired a chance shot, and several volleys followed, killing a few of the volunteers. The fighting ended quickly, as Garibaldi forbade his men to return fire on fellow subjects of the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946)|Kingdom of Italy]]. Many of the volunteers were taken prisoner, including Garibaldi, who had been wounded by a shot in the foot. (The episode was the origin of a famous Italian [[nursery rhyme]]: ''Garibaldi fu ferito'' "Garibaldi was wounded").

A government steamer took him to a prison at [[Varignano, La Spezia|Varignano]] near [[La Spezia]], where he was held in a sort of honorable imprisonment and underwent a tedious and painful operation to heal his wound. His venture had failed, but he was consoled by Europe's sympathy and continued interest. One historian of the [[American Civil War]] wrote that the distraction created by Garibaldi's wounding, followed by his unequivocal endorsement of the Union cause, was as important as Lincoln's [[Emancipation Proclamation]] in preserving British and French neutrality in the American conflict—thus significantly aiding the Northern cause.&lt;ref&gt;Don H. Doyle, ''The Cause of All Nations: An International History of the American Civil War'' (New York: Basic Books, 2015), 226-33.&lt;/ref&gt; After he regained his health, the government released Garibaldi and let him return to Caprera.

En route to London in 1864 he stopped briefly in Malta, where many admirers visited him in his hotel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Laurenza,Vincenzo | title=Victorian Sensation | publisher=Anthem Press | year=2003 | isbn=1-84331-150-X | pages=50–53 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Feeble protests by opponents of his anticlericalism were easily suppressed by the British colonial authorities.

At that time, his ambitious international project included the liberation of a range of occupied nations, such as Croatia, Greece, and Hungary. He also visited [[Bedford]] and was given a tour of the Britannia Iron Works, where he planted a tree (which was cut down in 1944 due to decay).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.galaxy.bedfordshire.gov.uk/webingres/bedfordshire/vlib/0.digitised_resources/bedford_digitisation_garibaldi.htm|publisher=Bedford Borough Council|title=Visit of Garibaldi to the Britannia Iron Works, 1864|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525033243/http://www.galaxy.bedfordshire.gov.uk/webingres/bedfordshire/vlib/0.digitised_resources/bedford_digitisation_garibaldi.htm|archivedate=25 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Final struggle with Austria, and other adventures ==
Garibaldi took up arms again in 1866, this time with the full support of the Italian government. The [[Austro-Prussian War]] had broken out, and Italy had allied with [[Prussia]] against the [[Austrian Empire]] in the hope of taking [[Venetia (region)|Venetia]] from Austrian rule ([[Third Italian War of Independence]]). Garibaldi gathered again his Hunters of the Alps, now some 40,000 strong, and [[Invasion of Trentino (1866)|led them]] into the [[Trentino]]. He defeated the Austrians at [[battle of Bezzecca|Bezzecca]] (securing the only Italian victory in that war) and made for [[Trento]].

The Italian regular forces were defeated at [[Battle of Lissa (1866)|Lissa]] on the sea, and made little progress on land after the disaster of [[Battle of Custoza (1866)|Custoza]]. The sides signed an armistice by which Austria ceded Venetia to Italy, but this result was largely due to Prussia's successes on the northern front. Garibaldi's advance through Trentino was for nought, and he was ordered to stop his advance to Trento. Garibaldi answered with a short telegram from the main square of Bezzecca with the famous motto: ''Obbedisco!'' ("I obey!") .

[[File:Garibaldi at Mentana, 3rd November 1867.jpg|thumb|left|Garibaldi at Mentana, 3 November 1867]]
After the war, Garibaldi led a political party that agitated for the capture of Rome, the peninsula's ancient capital. In 1867, he again marched on the city, but the Papal army, supported by a French auxiliary force, proved a match for his badly armed volunteers. He was shot in the leg in the [[Battle of Mentana]], and had to withdraw from the Papal territory. The Italian government again imprisoned him for some time, after which he returned to Caprera.

In the same year, Garibaldi sought international support for altogether eliminating the papacy. At an 1867 congress in [[Geneva]] he proposed: "The papacy, being the most harmful of all secret societies, ought to be abolished."&lt;ref&gt;Giuseppe Guerzoni, ''Garibaldi: con documenti editi e inediti'', Florence, 1882, Vol. 11, 485.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Garibaldi in Dijon.jpg|thumb|Garibaldi at Dijon]]
When the [[Franco-Prussian War]] broke out in July 1870, Italian public opinion heavily favored the Prussians, and many Italians attempted to sign up as volunteers at the Prussian embassy in Florence. After the French garrison was recalled from Rome, the Italian Army captured the Papal States without Garibaldi's assistance. Following the wartime collapse of the [[Second French Empire]] at the [[Battle of Sedan]], Garibaldi, undaunted by the recent hostility shown to him by the men of Napoleon III, switched his support to the newly declared [[French Third Republic]]. On 7 September 1870, within three days of the revolution of 4 September in Paris, he wrote to the ''Movimento'' of Genoa, "Yesterday I said to you: war to the death to Bonaparte. Today I say to you: rescue the French Republic by every means."&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, p. 602&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Garibaldi went to France and assumed command of the [[Army of the Vosges]], an army of volunteers.

==Death==
[[File:Garibaldi at Caprera.jpg|thumb|left|Garibaldi at Caprera]]

Despite being elected again to the Italian parliament, Garibaldi spent much of his late years in [[Caprera]].&lt;ref name=Kleis/&gt; He however supported an ambitious project of land reclamation in the marshy areas of southern [[Lazio]]. In 1879 he founded the ''League of Democracy'', which advocated universal suffrage, abolition of ecclesiastical property, [[emancipation of women]], and maintenance of a standing army. Ill and confined to  bed by [[arthritis]], he made trips to Calabria and Sicily. In 1880, he married Francesca Armosino, with whom he  previously had three children.
[[File:Funeral of Garibaldi at Caprera.jpeg|thumb|Funeral of Garibaldi at Caprera]]
On his deathbed, Garibaldi asked for his bed to be moved to where he could gaze at the emerald and sapphire sea. On his death on 2 June 1882 at the age of almost 75, his wishes for a simple funeral and cremation were not respected. He was buried in his farm on the island of [[Caprera]] alongside his last wife and some of his children.&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, p. 633&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Garibaldi's descendants announced that, with permission from authorities, they would have Garibaldi's remains exhumed to confirm through DNA analysis that the remains in the tomb are indeed Garibaldi's. Some anticipated that there would be a debate about whether to preserve the remains or to grant his final wish for a simple cremation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Giuseppe Garibaldi's body to be exhumed in Italy|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-19006337|accessdate=2 October 2013|date=26 July 2012|agency=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, personnel changes at the Ministry of Culture sidelined the exhumation plans. The new authorities were "less than enthusiastic" about the plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-20987487|date=14 January 2013|title=Garibaldi: Is his body still in its tomb?|author=Alan Johnston|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Writings ==
{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}
Garibaldi wrote at least two novels, characterized by an anti-clerical tone:
* ''Clelia'' or ''Il governo dei preti'' (1867) [https://archive.org/details/ruleofmonkorrome01gariuoft english translation, t. 1] [https://archive.org/details/ruleofmonkorrome02gariuoft english translation, t. 2]
* ''Cantoni il volontario'' (1870)
* ''I Mille'' (1873)
He also wrote non-fiction:

Garibaldi's popularity, skill at rousing the common people, and his military exploits are all credited with making the unification of Italy possible. He also served as a global exemplar of mid-19th century revolutionary nationalism and liberalism—but after the liberation of southern Italy from the Neapolitan monarchy, Garibaldi chose to sacrifice his liberal republican principles for the sake of unification.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Garibaldi subscribed to the [[anti-clericalism]] common among Latin liberals, and did much to circumscribe the temporal power of the [[Pope|Papacy]]. His personal religious convictions are unclear to historians—in 1882 he wrote "Man created God, not God created Man," yet in his autobiography he is quoted as saying, "I am a Christian, and I speak to Christians&amp;nbsp;– I am a true Christian, and I speak to true Christians. I love and venerate the religion of Christ, because Christ came into the world to deliver humanity from slavery," and, "You have the duty to educate the people—educate the people—educate them to be Christians—educate them to be Italians&amp;nbsp;... Viva l'Italia! Viva Christianity!"&lt;ref name="Sinistra costituzionale, correnti democratiche e società italiana dal 1870 al 1892: atti del XXVII Convegno storico toscano (Livorno, 23–25 settembre 1984)"&gt;{{cite book|title=Sinistra costituzionale, correnti democratiche e società italiana dal 1870 al 1892: atti del XXVII Convegno storico toscano (Livorno, 23–25 settembre 1984)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l3ofAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=21 February 2011|year=1988|publisher=L.

Giuseppe Garibaldi died at Caprera in 1882, where he was interred. Five ships of the [[Italian Navy]] have been named after him, including a World War II [[Italian cruiser Giuseppe Garibaldi (1936)|cruiser]] and the former [[flagship]], the [[aircraft carrier]] ''[[Giuseppe Garibaldi (551)|Giuseppe Garibaldi]]''. Statues of his likeness, as well as the handshake of Teano, stand in many Italian squares, and in other countries around the world. On the top of the [[Janiculum]] hill in Rome, there is a statue of Garibaldi on horse-back. His face was originally turned in the direction of the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] (an allusion{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} to his ambition to conquer the Papal States), but after the [[Lateran Treaty]] in 1929 the orientation of the statue was changed at the Vatican's request.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} A bust of Giuseppe Garibaldi is prominently placed outside the entrance to the old Supreme Court Chamber in the U.S. Capitol Building in Washington, DC, a gift from members of the Italian Society of Washington. Many theatres in Sicily take their name from him and are named [[Garibaldi Theatre (Piazza Armerina)|Garibaldi Theatre]].

Garibaldi was a popular hero in Britain. In a book review in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' (9 and 16 July 2007) of a Garibaldi biography, Tim Parks cites the English historian, [[A. J. P. Taylor]], as saying, "Garibaldi is the only wholly admirable figure in modern history."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2007/07/09/070709crbo_books_parks?currentPage=all]&lt;/ref&gt;  The reputation stems from a monumental trilogy (1907–11), by [[G. M. Trevelyan]].   According to [[David Cannadine]]:

{{quote|It depicted Garibaldi as a [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlylean]] hero—poet, patriot, and man of action—whose inspired leadership created the Italian nation. For Trevelyan, Garibaldi was the champion of freedom, progress, and tolerance, who vanquished the despotism, reaction, and obscurantism of the Austrian empire and the Neapolitan monarchy. The books were also notable for their vivid evocation of landscape (Trevelyan had himself followed the course of Garibaldi's marches), for their innovative use of documentary and oral sources, and for their spirited accounts of battles and military campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;David Cannadine, "Trevelyan, George Macaulay (1876–1962)", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography,''  2004; online edn, Jan 2011 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/36554, accessed 5 Nov 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1865, English football team [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] chose their home colours from the uniform worn by Garibaldi and his men  in 1865.&lt;ref name=nffchist&gt;[https://www.nottinghamforest.co.uk/club/history-landing-page/history-of-nffc/ "History of Nottingham Forest" nottinghamforest.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; A school in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire was also named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.garibaldi.org.uk/|title=The Garibaldi School|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Garibaldi biscuit]] was named after him, as was a style of beard. The [[Giuseppe Garibaldi Trophy]] has been awarded annually since 2007 within the [[Six Nations Championship|Six Nations]] [[rugby union]] framework to the victor of the match between France and Italy, in the memory of Garibaldi.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=March 2018}}

Garibaldi, along with [[Giuseppe Mazzini]] and other Europeans, supported the creation of a European federation. Many Europeans expected that the 1871 [[German Unification|unification of Germany]] would make Germany a European and world leader that would champion humanitarian policies. This idea is apparent in the following letter Giuseppe Garibaldi sent to [[Karl Blind]] on 10 April 1865:

{{quote|The progress of humanity seems to have come to a halt, and you with your superior intelligence will know why. The reason is that the world lacks a nation which possesses true leadership. Such leadership, of course, is required not to dominate other peoples, but to lead them along the path of duty, to lead them toward the brotherhood of nations where all the barriers erected by egoism will be destroyed. We need the kind of leadership which, in the true tradition of medieval chivalry, would devote itself to redressing wrongs, supporting the weak, sacrificing momentary gains and material advantage for the much finer and more satisfying achievement of relieving the suffering of our fellow men. We need a nation courageous enough to give us a lead in this direction. It would rally to its cause all those who are suffering wrong or who aspire to a better life, and all those who are now enduring foreign oppression.

This role of world leadership, left vacant as things are today, might well be occupied by the German nation. You Germans, with your grave and philosophic character, might well be the ones who could win the confidence of others and guarantee the future stability of the international community. Let us hope, then, that you can use your energy to overcome your moth-eaten [[thirty tyrants]] of the various German states. Let us hope that in the center of Europe you can then make a unified nation out of your fifty millions. All the rest of us would eagerly and joyfully follow you.&lt;ref&gt;Denis Mack Smith (Editor), ''Garibaldi (Great Lives Observed)'', Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, N.J. (1969) p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On 18 February 1960, the American television series ''[[Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theatre]]'' aired the episode "Guns for Garibaldi" to commemorate the centennial of the unification of Italy. This was the only such program to emphasize the role of Italians in pre-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] America. The episode is set in Indian Creek, a [[Western (genre)|western]] gold mining town. Giulio Mandati, played by [[Fernando Lamas]], takes over his brother's gold claim. People in Indian Creek wanted to use the gold to finance a dam, but Mandati plans to lend support to General Garibaldi and Italian reunification. Garibaldi had asked for financing and volunteers from around the world as he launched his Redshirts in July 1860 to invade Sicily and conquer the Kingdom of Naples for annexation to what would finally become the newly-born Kingdom Of Italy with King Victor Emmanuel II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0754239/|title=''Zane Grey Theatre'': "Guns for Garibaldi", February 18, 1960|publisher=[[Internet Movie Data Base]]|accessdate=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Garibaldi is a major character in two juvenile historical novels by [[Geoffrey Trease]]: ''Follow My Black Plume'' and ''A Thousand for Sicily''.  They are both closely based on G.&amp;nbsp;M. Trevelyan's accounts, the former set in the Roman Republic. Garibaldi is played by [[Raf Vallone]] in the 1952 film ''[[Red Shirts (film)|Red Shirts]]'', by [[Renzo Ricci]] in the 1961 film ''[[Garibaldi (film)|Garibaldi]]'', and by [[Giorgio Pasotti]] in the 2012 miniseries ''[[Anita Garibaldi (miniseries)|Anita Garibaldi]]''. Garibaldi was one of the most important characters of ''[[A Casa das Sete Mulheres]]'', a Brazilian serial of 2003, in which he was portrayed by [[Thiago Lacerda]].

'''Gorakhnath''' (also known as '''Goraksanath''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bruce M. Sullivan|title=Historical Dictionary of Hinduism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cvhGP8NRx4QC |year=1997|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-3327-2|pages=96, 149}}&lt;/ref&gt; estimated c. early 11th century) was a [[Hindu]] [[yogi]] and [[saint]] who was the influential founder of the [[Nath]] Hindu monastic movement in [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;George Weston Briggs (1938), ''Gorakhnath and the Kanphata Yogis'', 6th Edition (2009 Reprint), Motilal Banarsidass. {{ISBN|978-8120805644}}, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; He is considered as one of the two notable disciples of [[Matsyendranath]]. His followers are found in India at the place known as Garbhagiri which is in Ahmednagar in the state of [[Maharashtra]]. These followers are called [[yogi]]s, ''Gorakhnathi'', ''Darshani'' or ''Kanphata''.&lt;ref&gt;George Weston Briggs (1938), ''Gorakhnath and the Kanphata Yogis'', 6th Edition (2009 Reprint), Motilal Banarsidass. {{ISBN|978-8120805644}}, page 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The details of his biography are unknown and disputed. He was one of nine saints also known as [[Navnath]] and is widely popular in Maharashtra, India.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs (1938), ''Gorakhnath and the Kanphata Yogis'', 6th Edition (2009 Reprint), Motilal Banarsidass. {{ISBN|978-8120805644}}, pp. 228-250&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hagiography|Hagiographies]] describe him as more than a human teacher and someone outside the laws of time who appeared on earth in different ages.&lt;ref name=briggs249/&gt; Historians state Gorakhnath lived sometime during the first half of the 2nd millennium CE, but they disagree in which century. Estimates based on archaeology and text range from Briggs' 15th- to 12th-century&lt;ref name=briggs249&gt;George Weston Briggs (1938), ''Gorakhnath and the Kanphata Yogis'', 6th Edition (2009 Reprint), Motilal Banarsidass. {{ISBN|978-8120805644}}, p. 249&lt;/ref&gt; to Grierson's estimate of the 14th-century.&lt;ref&gt;George Weston Briggs (1938), ''Gorakhnath and the Kanphata Yogis'', 6th Edition (2009 Reprint), Motilal Banarsidass. {{ISBN|978-8120805644}}, pp. 228-230&lt;/ref&gt;

Gorakhnath is considered a ''Maha-yogi'' (or great yogi) in the Hindu tradition.&lt;ref name=banerjeagn23&gt;AK Banerjea (1983), Philosophy of Gorakhnath with Goraksha-Vacana-Sangraha, {{ISBN|978-8120805347}}, page 23-25&lt;/ref&gt; He did not emphasize a specific metaphysical theory or a particular Truth, but emphasized that the search for Truth and the spiritual life is a valuable and normal goal of man.&lt;ref name=banerjeagn23/&gt; Gorakhnath championed [[Yoga]], spiritual discipline and an ethical life of self-determination as a means to reaching [[samadhi]] and one's own spiritual truths.&lt;ref name=banerjeagn23/&gt;

Gorakhnath, his ideas and yogis have been highly popular in rural India, with monasteries and temples dedicated to him found in many states of India, particularly in the eponymous city of [[Gorakhpur]].&lt;ref name=whitesiddhayogi7/&gt;&lt;ref name=lorenzenmunozx&gt;David N. Lorenzen and Adrián Muñoz (2012), Yogi Heroes and Poets: Histories and Legends of the Naths, SUNY Press, {{ISBN|978-1438438900}}, pages x-xi&lt;/ref&gt; Among urban elites, the movement founded by Gorakhnath has been ridiculed.&lt;ref name=whitesiddhayogi7&gt;{{Citation | last =White | first =David Gordon | year =2012 | title =The Alchemical Body: Siddha Traditions in Medieval India | publisher =University of Chicago Press | pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Historian accounts===
Historians vary in their estimate on when Gorakhnath lived. Estimates based on archaeology and text range from Briggs' 11th- to 12th-century&lt;ref name="briggs249"/&gt; to [[Fariduddin Ganjshakar|Baba Farid]] documents and Jnanesvari manuscripts leading Abbott to connect Gorakhnath to the 13th-century,&lt;ref name=briggs230&gt;George Weston Briggs (1938), ''Gorakhnath and the Kanphata Yogis'', 6th Edition (2009 Reprint), Motilal Banarsidass. {{ISBN|978-8120805644}}, pages 230, 242-243&lt;/ref&gt; to Grierson who relying on evidence discovered in Gujarat suggests the 14th-century.&lt;ref name=briggs230/&gt; His influence is found in the numerous references to him in the poetry of Kabir and of Guru Nanak of [[Sikhism]], which describe him as a very powerful leader with a large following, thereby suggesting he likely lived around the time these spiritual leaders lived in India.&lt;ref&gt;George Weston Briggs (1938), ''Gorakhnath and the Kanphata Yogis'', 6th Edition (2009 Reprint), Motilal Banarsidass. {{ISBN|978-8120805644}}, pages 236-242&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical texts imply that Gorakhnath was originally a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] in a region influenced by Shaivism, and he converted to Hinduism championing [[Shiva]] and [[Yoga]].&lt;ref&gt;George Weston Briggs (1938), ''Gorakhnath and the Kanphata Yogis'', 6th Edition (2009 Reprint), Motilal Banarsidass. {{ISBN|978-8120805644}}, pages 229, 233-235&lt;/ref&gt; Gorakhnath led a life as a passionate exponent of ideas of Kumarila and [[Adi Shankara]] that championed the Yoga and [[Advaita Vedanta]] interpretation of the Upanishads.&lt;ref&gt;AK Banerjea (1983), Philosophy of Gorakhnath with Goraksha-Vacana-Sangraha, {{ISBN|978-8120805347}}, pagea xli, 303-307&lt;/ref&gt; Gorakhnath considered the controversy between [[Dualistic cosmology#Theistic dualism|dualism]] and [[nondualism]] spiritual theories in medieval India as useless from practice point of view, he emphasized that the choice is of the yogi, that the spiritual discipline and practice by either path leads to "perfectly illumined samadhi state of the individual phenomenal consciousness", states Banerjea.&lt;ref&gt;AK Banerjea (1983), Philosophy of Gorakhnath with Goraksha-Vacana-Sangraha, {{ISBN|978-8120805347}}, pagea xli, 307-312&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hagiographic accounts===
The hagiography on Gorakhnath describe him to have appeared on earth several times.&lt;ref name=briggs249/&gt; The legends do not provide a time or place where he was born, and consider him to be superhuman.&lt;ref name=briggs229/&gt; North Indian hagiographies suggest he originated from northwest India (Punjab, with some mentioning Peshawar).&lt;ref name=briggs229&gt;Briggs (1938), ''Gorakhnath and the Kanphata Yogis'', 6th Edition (2009 Reprint), Motilal Banarsidass. {{ISBN|978-8120805644}}, p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; Other hagiographies on Gorakhnath in ([[Bengal]]) and Bihar suggest he originated from eastern region of India ([[Including Bangladesh]]).&lt;ref name=briggs229/&gt;

These hagiographies are inconsistent, and offer varying records of the spiritual descent of Gorakhnath. All name [[Adi Nath|Adinath]] and [[Matsyendranath]] as two teachers preceding him in the succession. Though one account lists five [[guru]]s preceding Adinath and another lists six teachers between Matsyendranath and Gorakhnath, current tradition has Adinath identified with Lord [[Shiva]] as the direct teacher of  [[Matsyendranath]], who was himself the direct teacher of Gorakhnath.&lt;ref&gt;George Weston Briggs (1938), pp. 229&amp;ndash;231&lt;/ref&gt;

The legends in the Nath tradition assert that he traveled widely across the Indian subcontinent, and accounts about him are found in some form in several places including [[Nepal]], [[Punjab region|Punjab]], [[Sindh]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Uttarakhand]], [[Assam]], [[Tripura]], [[Bengal]], [[Odisha]], [[Kathiawar|Kathiawar(Gujarat)]], [[Maharashtra]], [[Karnataka]], and even [[Sri Lanka]].

==Nath Sampradaya==
The [[Nath|Nath tradition]] states that its traditions existed before Gorakhnath, but the movement's greatest expansion happened under the guidance and inspiration of Gorakhnath. He produced a number of writings and even today is considered the greatest of the [[Nath]]s. It has been purported that Gorakhnath wrote the first books on [[Laya yoga]]. In India there are many caves, many with temples built over them, where it is said that Gorakhnath spent time in meditation. According to [[Bhagawan Nityananda]], the samadhi shrine (tomb) of Gorakhnath is at Nath Mandir near the [[Vajreshwari temple]] about one kilometer from Ganeshpuri, [[Maharashtra]], [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhagawannityananda.org/bn5.html|title=Discipleship|accessdate=2007-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to legends Gorakhnath and Matsyendranath did penance in Kadri Temple at Mangalore, Karnataka. They are also instrumental in laying Shivlingam at Kadri and Dharmasthala.

The temple of ''Gorakhnath'' is also situated on hill called Garbhagiri near Vambori, Tal Rahuri; Dist Ahmednagar. There is also a famous temple of Gorakhnath in the state of Odisha.

===Gorakhnath Math===
[[File:Gorakhnath mandir.jpg|thumb|Gorakhnath mandir in Gorakhpur, India]]
The [[Gorakhnath Math]] is a monastery of the Nath monastic group named after the medieval saint, Gorakhnath (c. 11th century), of the Nath sampradaya. The math and town of [[Gorakhpur]] in Uttar Pradesh is named after him. The monastery and the temple perform various cultural and social activities and serve as the cultural hub of the city. The monastery also publishes texts on the philosophy of Gorakhnath.&lt;ref&gt;AK Banerjea (1983), Philosophy of Gorakhnath with Goraksha-Vacana-Sangraha, {{ISBN|978-8120805347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==

===Hatha yoga===
Some scholars associate the origins of [[Hatha yoga]] with the [[Nath]] yogis, in particular Gorakhnath and his guru [[Matsyendranath]].{{sfn| Encyclopedia Britannica | 2007}}&lt;ref name=mallinsongnyogi&gt;James Mallinson (2014). [https://www.academia.edu/5304343/The_Yog%C4%ABs_Latest_Trick The Yogīs’ Latest Trick]. Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society (Third Series), 24, pp 165-180. doi:10.1017/S1356186313000734, Quote: "That these Nāth Yogīs were the originators and foremost exponents of haṭhayoga is a given of all historical studies of yoga. But these Yogīs were in fact the willing and complicit beneficiaries of the semantic confusion which has caught out White and many other scholars."&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Gerald James Larson|Ram Shankar Bhattacharya|Karl H. Potter|2008|p=140}} According to British indologist [[James Mallinson (author)|James Mallinson]], this association is false.&lt;ref name=mallinsongnyogi/&gt; In his view, the origins of hatha yoga should be associated with the [[Dashanami Sampradaya]] of [[Advaita Vedanta]]{{sfn|James Mallinson|2011|pp=331-332 with footnote 22}} (Hinduism), the mystical figure of [[Dattatreya]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/3490868/Yoga_and_Yogis Yoga and Yogis]. March 2012. James Mallinson. pg. 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Ramananda|Rāmānandīs]].{{sfn|James Mallinson|2012|pp=26-27, Quote: "Thee key practices of hathayoga — including complex, non-seated āsanas [...] whose first descriptions are found in Pāñcarātrika sources — originated among the forerunners of the Dasnāmīs and Rāmānandīs."}}

While the origins of Hatha yoga are disputed, according to [[Guy Beck]] – a professor of Religious Studies known for his studies on Yoga and music, "the connections between Goraknath, the Kanphatas and Hatha yoga are beyond question".{{sfn|Guy L. Beck|1995|pp=102-103}}

===Nepal===
{{main|Gurkha}}
The [[Gurkhas]] of Nepal and Nepali people of India take their name from this saint. He has long been considered the ''rastradevata''  (lord of state) of Nepal, with his name appearing on numerous versions of Nepalese coins and currency notes.&lt;ref name="Larsonp440"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gerald James Larson|author2=Ram Shankar Bhattacharya|author3=Karl H. Potter|title=Yoga: India's Philosophy of Meditation|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=p6pURGdBBmIC&amp;pg=PA440| year=2008|publisher= Motilal Banarsidass |isbn =978-81-208-3349-4|pages=440–441}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gorkha]], a historical district of Nepal, is named after him.

There is a cave with his paduka (footprints) and an idol of him. Every year on the day of Baisakh Purnima there is a great celebration in Gorkha at his cave, called Rot Mahotsav; it has been celebrated for the last seven hundred years.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

A legend asserts, state William Northey and John Morris, that a disciple of Machendra by name Gorakhnath, once visited Nepal and retired to a little hill near Deo Patan. There he meditated in an unmovable state for twelve years. The locals built a temple in his honor there, and it has since been remembered with

===In Tamil Siddhar tradition===
[[Korakkar]] is one among the 18 [[Siddhar]]s and also known as Goraknath amongst Navanathar. [[Agattiyar]] and [[Bogar]] were his [[guru]]s. His Jeeva [[samadhi]] temple is in Vadukupoigainallur of Nagapattinam district of Tamil Nadu. According to one account, he spent a portion of his growing-up years in the [[Velliangiri Mountains]] in [[Coimbatore]].

Other sanctums related with Korakkar are [[Perur]], [[Thiruchendur]] and Triconamalli. Korakkar caves are found in Chaturagiri and [[Kolli Hills]]. Like other siddhas, Korakkar has written songs on Medicine, Philosophy, and Alchemy.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

===West Bengal -  Assam - Tripura===
The Bengali Community located in these states and neighbouring country of Bangladesh have a sizable number of Yogi Brahmins (Also called Rudraja Brahmins/ Yogi Nath - who used surnames like Debnath, Debsharma, Nath, Ghoshal and Bhowmick) who have taken their name from this saint.

===Community kitchens===
According to Arvind-Pal Singh Mandair, a professor of Sikh Studies, Gorakhnath orders in Punjab were operating free community kitchens in Punjab when Guru Nanak founded Sikhism.&lt;ref name="Mandair2013p25"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arvind-Pal Singh Mandair|title=Sikhism: A Guide for the Perplexed|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BEP0Ty-GuVEC |year=2013|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4411-1708-3|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gorakhnath shrines have continued to operate a langar and provide a free meal to pilgrims who visit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ron Geaves|title=Saivism in the Diaspora: Contemporary Forms of Skanda Worship|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o2fXAAAAMAAJ |year=2007|publisher=Equinox|isbn=978-1-84553-234-5|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
[[Romola Butalia]], an Indian writer of Yoga history, lists the works attributed to Gorakhnath as follows:
"Guru Gorakhnath is thought to have authored several books including the Goraksha Samhita, Goraksha Gita, Siddha Siddhanta Paddhati, Yoga Martanada, Yoga Siddhanta Paddhati, Yoga-Bija, Yoga Chintamani. He is believed to be the founder of the [[Nath Sampradaya]] and it is stated that the nine [[Nath]]s and [[Mahasiddha|84 Siddha]]s are all human forms created as yogic manifestations to spread the message of yoga and meditation to the world. It is they who reveal samadhi to mankind."

===Siddha Siddhanta Paddhati===
The ''Siddha Siddhanta Paddhati'' is a [[Hatha Yoga]] Sanskrit text attributed to Gorakhnath by the [[Nath]] tradition. According to [[Georg Feuerstein|Feuerstein]] (1991: p.&amp;nbsp;105), it is "one of the earliest hatha yoga scriptures, the ''Siddha Siddhanta Paddhati'', contains many verses that describe the [[avadhuta]]" (liberated) yogi.&lt;ref&gt;Feuerstein, Georg (1991). 'Holy Madness'. In ''Yoga Journal'' May/June 1991. With calligraphy by Robin Spaan. Source: [https://books.google.com/books?id=lekDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA105 page 105] (accessed: 29 February 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gerald James Larson|author2=Ram Shankar Bhattacharya|author3=Karl H. Potter|title=Yoga: India's Philosophy of Meditation|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=p6pURGdBBmIC | year=2008|publisher= Motilal Banarsidass |isbn =978-81-208-3349-4|page=453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Siddha Siddhanta Paddhati'' text is based on an [[Advaita Vedanta|advaita (nonduality)]] framework, where the yogi sees "himself in all beings, and all in himself" including the identity of the individual soul ([[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]]) with the universal ([[Brahman]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gerald James Larson|author2=Ram Shankar Bhattacharya|author3=Karl H. Potter|title=Yoga: India's Philosophy of Meditation|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=p6pURGdBBmIC | year=2008|publisher= Motilal Banarsidass |isbn =978-81-208-3349-4|pages=440–441}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea appears in the text in various forms, such as the following:

{{Quote|
The four varna (castes) are perceived to be located in the nature of the individual, i.e. Brahmana in ''sadacara'' (righteous conduct), Ksatriya in ''saurya'' (valor and courage), Vaisya in ''vyavasaya'' (business), and Sudra in ''seva'' (service). A yogin experiences all men and women of all races and castes within himself. Therefore he has no hatred for anybody. He has love for every being.
|Gorakhnath|''Siddha Siddhanta Paddhati III.6-8'' (Translator: D Shastri)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gerald James Larson|author2=Ram Shankar Bhattacharya|author3=Karl H.

'''Henry Fuseli''' {{Post-nominals|post-noms=[[List of Royal Academicians|RA]]}} (German: '''Johann Heinrich Füssli'''; 7 February 1741 – 17 April 1825) was a Swiss painter, [[drawing|draughtsman]] and writer on art who spent much of his life in [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. Many of his works, such as ''The Nightmare'', deal with supernatural subject-matter. He painted works for [[Boydell Shakespeare Gallery|John Boydell's Shakespeare Gallery]], and created his own "Milton Gallery". He held the posts of Professor of Painting and Keeper at the Royal Academy. His style had a considerable influence on many younger British artists, including [[William Blake]].

==Biography==
[[File:Johann Heinrich Füssli 011.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Thor Battering the Midgard Serpent]]'' was Fuseli's diploma work for the [[Royal Academy]], accepted 1790.]]

Fuseli was born in [[Zürich]], Switzerland, the second of 18 children. His father was [[Johann Caspar Füssli]], a painter of portraits and landscapes, and author of ''Lives of the [[Helvetia|Helvetic]] Painters''. He intended Henry for the church, and sent him to the Caroline college of Zurich, where he received an excellent classical education. One of his schoolmates there was [[Johann Kaspar Lavater]], with whom he became close friends.&lt;ref name="eb1911"&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 1911&lt;/ref&gt;

After taking orders in 1761 Fuseli was forced to leave the country as a result of having helped Lavater to expose an unjust magistrate, whose powerful family sought revenge. He travelled through [[Germany]], and then, in 1765, visited England, where he supported himself for some time by miscellaneous writing. Eventually, he became acquainted with [[Sir Joshua Reynolds]], to whom he showed his drawings. Following Reynolds' advice, he decided to devote himself entirely to art. In 1770 he made an art-pilgrimage to Italy, where he remained until 1778, changing his name from Füssli to the more Italian-sounding Fuseli.&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt;

Early in 1779 he returned to Britain, taking in Zürich on his way. In London he found a commission awaiting him from [[John Boydell|Alderman Boydell]], who was then setting up his [[Boydell Shakespeare Gallery|Shakespeare Gallery]]. Fuseli painted a number of pieces for Boydell, and published an English edition of Lavater's work on [[physiognomy]]. He also gave [[William Cowper]] some valuable assistance in preparing a translation of [[Homer]]. In 1788 Fuseli married [[:File:Sophia Rawlins by Henry Fuseli.jpg|Sophia Rawlins]] (originally one of his models), and he soon after became an associate of the [[Royal Academy]].&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt; The early feminist [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], whose portrait he had painted, planned a trip with him to Paris, and pursued him determinedly, but after Sophia's intervention the Fuselis' door was closed to her forever. Fuseli later said "I hate clever women. They are only troublesome".&lt;ref&gt;Myrone, Martin (2001) ''Henry Fuseli''. London: Tate Gallery Publishing, p. 53. {{ISBN|1854373579}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1790 he became a full [[Academician]], presenting ''[[Thor Battering the Midgard Serpent]]'' as his [[Reception piece|diploma work]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.racollection.org.uk/ixbin/indexplus?_IXSESSION_=JZYSvRhQvBq&amp;_IXSR_=&amp;_IXACTION_=display&amp;_MREF_=20058&amp;_IXSP_=1&amp;_IXFPFX_=templates/full/&amp;_IXSPFX_=templates/full/''Thor battering the Midgard Serpent'', 1790.] Royal Academy of Arts Collections, 5 February 2014.

Four years later he was chosen as Keeper, and resigned his professorship, but resumed it in 1810, continuing to hold both offices until his death.&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt; As Keeper, he was succeeded by [[Henry Thomson (painter)|Henry Thomson]].

In 1799 Fuseli exhibited a series of paintings from subjects furnished by the works of [[John Milton]], with a view to forming a Milton gallery comparable to Boydell's Shakespeare gallery. There were 47 Milton paintings, many of them very large, completed at intervals over nine years. The exhibition proved a commercial failure and closed in 1800. In 1805 he brought out an edition of Pilkington's ''Lives of the Painters'', which did little for his reputation.&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt;

[[Antonio Canova]], when on his visit to England, was much taken with Fuseli's works, and on returning to Rome in 1817 caused him to be elected a member of the first class in the Academy of St Luke.&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt;

==Works==
As a painter, Fuseli favoured the supernatural. He pitched everything on an ideal scale, believing a certain amount of exaggeration necessary in the higher branches of historical painting. In this theory he was confirmed by the study of [[Michelangelo]]'s works and [[Horse Tamers|the marble statues of the Monte Cavallo]],&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.romeartlover.it/Vasi61.html Papal Palace on Monte Cavallo, Rome]. Retrieved 2011-12-28.&lt;/ref&gt; which, when at [[Rome]], he liked to contemplate in the evening, relieved against a murky sky or illuminated by lightning.&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt;

Describing his style, the 1911 edition of the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' said that:&lt;blockquote&gt;His figures are full of life and earnestness, and seem to have an object in view which they follow with intensity. Like [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] he excelled in the art of setting his figures in motion. Though the lofty and terrible was his proper sphere, Fuseli had a fine perception of the ludicrous. The grotesque humour of his fairy scenes, especially those taken from ''A Midsummer-Night's Dream'', is in its way not less remarkable than the poetic power of his more ambitious works.&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Though not noted as a colourist,&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt; Fuseli was described as a master of light and shadow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leslie |first=C. R. |type=Letter to Miss Leslie December 1816|title=Autobiographical Recollections|editor=Tom Taylor|publisher=Ticknor &amp; Fields|location=Boston|year=1855}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than setting out his palette methodically in the manner of most painters, he merely distributed the colours across it randomly. He often used his pigments in the form of a dry powder, which he hastily combined on the end of his brush with oil, or [[turpentine]], or [[Water gilding|gold size]], regardless of the quantity, and depending on accident for the general effect. This recklessness may perhaps be explained by the fact that he did not paint in oil until the age of 25.&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt;

[[File:John Henry Fuseli - The Nightmare.JPG|thumb|''[[The Nightmare]],'' (1781), [[Detroit Institute of Arts]]]]
Fuseli painted more than 200 pictures, but he exhibited only a small number of them. His earliest painting represented "Joseph interpreting the Dreams of the Baker and Butler"; the first to excite particular attention was ''[[The Nightmare]]'', exhibited in 1782.&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt; He painted two versions, shown in the [[The Nightmare|Nightmare]] article. Themes seen in ''The Nightmare'' were repeated in his 1796 painting, ''Night-Hag visiting the Lapland Witches''.

His sketches or designs numbered about 800; they have admirable qualities of invention and design, and are frequently superior to his paintings.&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt; In his drawings, as in his paintings, his method included deliberately exaggerating the proportions of the human body and throwing his figures into contorted attitudes. One technique involved setting down arbitrary points on a sheet, which then became the extreme points of the various limbs.&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt; Notable examples of these drawings were made in concert with George Richmond when the two artists were together in Rome.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} He rarely drew the figure from life, basing his art on study of the antique and Michelangelo. He produced no [[Landscape art|landscapes]]—"Damn Nature! she always puts me out," was his characteristic exclamation—and painted only two portraits.&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt;

Many interesting anecdotes of Fuseli, and his relations to contemporary artists, are given in his ''Life'' by [[John Knowles (author)|John Knowles]] (1831).&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt; He influenced the art of [[Fortunato Duranti]].

==Writings==
[[File:Henry Fuseli by Edward Hodges Baily, 1824, National Portrait Gallery, London.jpg|thumb|Henry Fuseli (aged 63) by [[Edward Hodges Baily]], 1824, National Gallery, London]]
In 1788 Fuseli started to write essays and reviews for the ''[[Analytical Review]]''. With [[Thomas Paine]], [[William Godwin]], [[Joseph Priestley]], [[Erasmus Darwin]], [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], and others interested in art, literature and politics, Fuseli frequented the home of [[Joseph Johnson (publisher)|Joseph Johnson]], a [[publisher]] and prominent figure in radical British political and intellectual life. He also visited Allerton Hall in Liverpool, the home of [[William Roscoe]].

When Louis XVI was executed in France in 1793, Fuseli condemned the revolution as despotic and anarchic,{{where|date=September 2017}} although he had first welcomed it as a sign of "an age pregnant with the most gigantic efforts of character".

He was a thorough master of [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]], and could write in all these languages with equal facility and vigour, although he preferred German as the vehicle of his thoughts. His principal work was his series of twelve lectures delivered to the Royal Academy, begun in 1801.&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt;

==Influence==
His pupils included [[John Constable]], [[Benjamin Haydon]], [[William Etty]], and [[Edwin Landseer]]. [[William Blake]], who was 16 years his junior, recognized a debt to him, and for a time many English artists copied his mannerisms.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

==Death==
After a life of uninterrupted good health&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt; he died at the house of the Countess of Guildford on [[Putney|Putney Hill]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=45294 |title=Putney &amp;#124; Old and New London: Volume 6 (pp. 489–503) |publisher=British-history.ac.uk |date=2003-06-22 |accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the age of 84, and was buried in the crypt of [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. He was comparatively wealthy at the time of his death.&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt;

'''Captain Killian "[[Captain Hook|Hook]]" Jones''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] in [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s [[Television program|television series]] ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]''. He is portrayed by Irish actor/musician [[Colin O'Donoghue]], who became a series regular in the second season after making recurring appearances and became a fan favorite since his debut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2012/10/03/colin-odonoghue-hook|title='Once Upon a Time' upgrades Colin O'Donoghue (Capt.

== Character background ==
{{Overly detailed|section|date=October 2018}}
=== Seasons 1 and 2 ===
In the Enchanted Forest, '''Killian Jones''' is the younger brother of Liam Jones. As children, their father abandoned them and sold them into servitude to [[Long John Silver|Captain Silver]]. However, with the help of the god [[Hades]], the two escape servitude and become crew members of the ''Jewel of the Realm''. In service to a corrupt king, the two were sent to [[Neverland]] to retrieve a certain plant called dreamshade. Killian is reluctant to follow orders after [[Peter Pan#Once Upon a Time|Peter Pan]] informs them it is poisonous. A stubborn Liam is ultimately killed by the plant. Devastated by his brother's death, Jones grew bitter, blaming the king for his brother's death. Rechristening the vessel the ''[[Jolly Roger]]'', Jones became a ruthless pirate. Some time after, he seduces away the wife of [[Mr. Gold|Rumplestiltskin]], Milah. When Rumplestiltskin tries to persuade Jones to have mercy, the pirate holds a sword to his throat and taunts him about his actions, which he deems cowardly. However, after becoming possessed with an entity known as the [[Nimue|Dark One]], Rumplestiltskin seeks out Jones, wishing to continue their duel. In this fight, Jones's life is saved by Milah, who opts to make a deal with her ex-husband. However, Rumplestiltskin is unable to forgive her for abandoning their son Baelfire, so he kills her. When Jones tries to exact revenge, Rumplestiltskin cuts off his hand, which he replaces with the hook he unsuccessfully used to kill the Dark One. From this point on, Jones became known as '''Captain Hook'''. Upon taking [[Mr. Smee|William Smee]] as his first mate, Hook returns to Neverland,&lt;ref name="S03E05"&gt;[http://tvrecaps.ew.com/recap/once-upon-a-time-season-3-episode-5/ 'Once Upon a Time' recap: Save the Best for Last] by Hilary Busis, from [[Entertainment Weekly]] (October 27, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; as this would provide him with time to find a way to kill Rumplestiltskin. Shortly after his arrival, Hook gives shelter to Baelfire, who has arrived in Neverland and is on the run from Peter Pan. He forms an unlikely friendship with him, until Baelfire learns that his mother ran away with Hook, abandoning him. He is further enraged when he learns that Hook had been planning to use him to kill his father, beginning to realize that Hook is not so different from the man he wishes to kill. In response, Hook hands Bae over to the Lost Boys, the beings who serve Peter Pan.

Flashbacks have revealed very little about Hook's past in Neverland. The earliest known event after his separation from Baelfire is Hook's meeting the exiled fairy [[Tinker Bell]], with whom he shares his reasons for desiring revenge: the Dark One killed the woman he loved. In doing so, Hook also shares his philosophy on how he would risk his life for just two things: love or revenge. Later, it is revealed that among his duties as Pan's servant, Hook smuggled food from the Enchanted Forest into Neverland. During one of these voyages, Hook was nearly killed by a mermaid; however, the mermaid went against her father's wishes and spared his life. In gratitude, Hook offered the mermaid in question, [[Ursula (Disney)|Ursula]], passage away from her father [[Poseidon]]. However, after Poseidon takes away Hook's chance at revenge, Hook breaks his word and steals Ursula's singing voice, so that Poseidon would be unable to use it against sailors. Likely around this same time, Hook killed knights who worked for King George in order to steal the King's treasure. Then he killed their prisoner Robert since "dead men tell no tales." At some point, around the early 1980s, Hook made a deal with Pan and escaped Neverland.

Upon returning home, he seeks out a prisoner named [[Belle (Once Upon a Time)|Belle]] (who had been the Dark One's prisoner for a time). However, after realizing that Belle had no knowledge or desire to kill Rumpelstiltskin, Hook knocks her unconscious and turns to leave. Before he can, however, he is intercepted by [[Monarch|Queen]] [[Regina Mills|Regina]], who promises that she can help Hook kill the Dark One. In exchange, Hook is to dispose of her mother [[Queen of Hearts (Once Upon a Time)|Cora]] in [[Wonderland (fictional country)|Wonderland]]. In order to test him for weakness, the Queen revealed to him that his father still lived and ordered Hook to kill him. Though the pirate was at first resistant, he eventually murdered his father in cold blood upon realizing that he had tried to replace the sons he abandoned with a new son, also named Liam. The Queen's test eventually proved pointless, as while in Wonderland, Cora used Hook's own weakness against him. Hook betrayed Regina and forged an alliance with Cora, as Regina's deal would involve amnesia. As Cora points out, it would be difficult for Hook to kill someone he cannot remember. When the Dark Curse is activated, Cora protects them both and part of the Enchanted Forest with a barrier spell, frozen in time for twenty-eight years.&lt;ref name="S02E09"&gt;[http://tvrecaps.ew.com/recap/once-upon-a-time-season-9-winter-finale/ "'Once Upon a Time' recap: There and Back Again"] from [[Entertainment Weekly]] (December 2, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

After this time period, the curse's power begins to weaken and time begins to move forward again. During this time, Hook is reached out by [[Captain Nemo]], a sailor who seeks to ease Hook's pain and help him find a new family among Nemo's crew. However, while aboard the ''Nautilus'', Hook learns that Nemo's first mate is none other than his half-brother Liam. Upon learning Hook is responsible for their father's death, Liam tries to kill the pirate, but ultimately shoots Nemo instead. Hoping to save Nemo, Liam travels to the [[Mysterious Island]], where time stands still, and Hook returns to the ''Jolly Roger'' to wait out the rest of the curse. After the curse has broken completely, Hook encounters [[Emma Swan]] and [[Mary Margaret Blanchard|Snow White]] in the Enchanted Forest. Working with [[Aurora (Disney character)|Aurora]] and [[Mulan (Disney character)|Mulan]], Emma and Snow counter Hook and Cora's attempts to follow them into Storybrooke. However, Hook had captured a magic bean from a giant he and Swan encountered previously, a bean which is used to carry him and Cora into Storybrooke. While in Storybrooke, Hook confronts Rumplestiltskin (known in this land as Mr. Gold) and robs him from his chance to return to his son. After he is thwarted by Belle and Gold, he tracks them down at the town line and shoots Belle. Belle falls across the town's border and loses her memory again. After he is betrayed by Regina and Cora (who decide to use the Dark One's dagger for themselves), Hook flees into the Land Without Magic and strikes Gold with dreamshade, the same poison which killed his brother. After realizing that Gold's life was spared in a deal made with Snow White, Hook agrees to work with Greg Mendell and Tamara, two of Pan's agents. Per their plan, he forges an alliance with Regina, then betrays her, so they can capture her. However, upon realizing that Greg and Tamara's plan would involve his death and the deaths of everyone else in Storybrooke, Hook betrays them and allies with his former enemies. Though he originally attempted to do the honorable thing and help save the town, when the plan offered by the townspeople seems to have little hope of success, he steals the magic bean to use for himself. However, upon learning of Baelfire's supposed death, he returns to honor his memory. Afterward, he journeys with Gold, Regina, and the heroes to Neverland to rescue Henry.

=== Seasons 3 and 4 ===
In Neverland, Hook becomes the group's guide. Though Hook’s original goal in rescuing Henry had been to honor Baelfire, over time he begins to develop real feelings for Emma, and after rescuing her father [[David Nolan (Once Upon a Time)|David]] from death, he realized that he had fallen in love with her. This grew more confusing when it was learned that Baelfire was still alive. As such, a love triangle which formed between Hook, Baelfire, and Emma nearly drove a wedge in their plans. However, Hook and Baelfire managed to reconcile in time rescue Henry from Pan. Once in Storybrooke, Hook agrees to step aside, so Emma and Baelfire (Henry's parents) can have a chance to get back together. After Pan tries to reenact the Dark Curse, Hook is present when his old foe is killed by his nemesis: Pan's son, Rumplestiltskin. With Pan destroyed, Regina succeeds in reversing his curse, sending Hook and the other inhabitants back to the Enchanted Forest, while Emma and Henry escape to New York City with new memories. While in the Enchanted Forest, Hook tries unsuccessfully to return to his old ways. But after betraying the mermaid [[Ariel (Disney character)|Ariel]] to get his ship back, Hook is consumed with guilt. After a new curse is cast by Snow White in order to combat [[Zelena (Once Upon a Time)|Zelena]], the Wicked Witch of the West, Hook journeys to relocate Emma, in hopes of redeeming himself. After relocating Emma, Hook restores her memories with a potion and returns to Storybrooke with Emma and Henry to save Storybrooke from [[Zelena (Once Upon a Time)|Zelena]]. While in  Storybrooke, Hook is cursed by Zelena, who wishes to rob Emma of her powers. Using a resurrected Rumplestiltskin in her thrall, Zelena orchestrates a series of events which lead to Hook's inadvertently doing just that. Regina possesses enough light magic to stop Zelena for a time. However, after she is nearly killed by Gold, she opens a time portal, which Hook and Emma fall through. While in the Enchanted Forest, Hook and Emma inadvertently interrupt the meeting of Emma's parents: Snow White and Prince "James" David. With the help of Rumplestiltskin, Hook and Emma fix their mistake, but inadvertently rescue [[Maid Marian|Marian]], who was to die. To fix this mistake, Hook and Emma plan to bring Marian to the present, though they inadvertently bring Zelena instead (as the Wicked Witch had killed Marian and took her form). While in the Dark Castle, Emma uses her magic to reopen the portal to the present and begins a relationship with Hook, after he reveals he traded his ship for her.

Upon returning to the present, Hook becomes enthralled in a deal with Gold, after he is deceived by the Dark One. Through the course of Storybrooke's battle against the former [[Monarch|Queen]] [[The Snow Queen (Once Upon a Time)|Ingrid]], Hook serves Gold in gathering more magic for himself. After Hook tries to prevent the Dark One from absorbing Emma's magic, Gold rips out Hook's heart and controls him. Through this, Gold forces Hook to suck the [[Fairy|fairies]] into the immortal sorcerer [[Merlin|Merlin's]] hat. After Ingrid sacrifices herself to stop her own curse, Hook is taken by Gold to be sacrificed in the ceremony that would sever the connection between him and his dagger. He is rescued by the timely arrival of Belle, who has taken possession of the real dagger. Later on, Hook works with Belle to find a spell to release the fairies imprisoned in the hat, inadvertently also releasing the [[Chernabog]]. The beast is eventually defeated with the help of Ursula and [[Cruella de Vil]], who have made an alliance with Gold. When it is revealed that Gold, Ursula, and Cruella have not only formed an alliance but have resurrected [[Maleficent]], Hook decides to make things right with Ursula. After her singing voice is restored, with the help of Ariel and Poseidon, Ursula fills Hook in on the rest of Gold's plan: to turn Emma dark. This plan is eventually done through Isaac Heller, the Author, who creates an alternate reality which robs heroes of their happy endings. In this reality, a cowardly Hook aids Emma and Henry on their quest to restore their old reality. In a fight against the evil [[David Nolan (Once Upon a Time)|Prince Charming]], Hook is killed. However, when the alternate universe is undone, Hook's life is restored. Upon returning to Storybrooke, Gold's life is nearly drained by his own darkness. In hopes of preventing this, Merlin's [[The Sorcerer's Apprentice|apprentice]] removes Gold's darkness, trying to store it in his master's hat. The hat is not strong enough to contain it, and the darkness escapes. Though it originally targets the Apprentice, he is spared briefly by Emma, who expels it outside. However, when the darkness chooses Regina as its host, Emma selflessly accepts her role as the new Dark One, pleading with her parents and Hook to help remove her darkness.

=== Season 5 ===
With a combination of the powers of Regina and Zelena, Hook and the others are transported to the Enchanted Forest, where they are reunited with Emma. It is Hook who prevents Emma from coldly killing the Scottish princess [[Merida (Disney)|Merida]] in a moment of desperation. In Camelot, Hook and the others search for Merlin to help save Emma from her own darkness. Though they stalled by the deranged [[King Arthur]], they eventually free Merlin. However, through Arthur's machinations, Merlin fails to revive Emma's goodness. After Emma passes her test and remains a hero, Hook and the others are betrayed by Zelena, who helps Arthur bind Merlin to the control of Excalibur, forcing him to abandon Emma in her time of need. Now under Arthur's control, Merlin holds Emma's family captive. Though Emma manages to free her family, Hook receives a fatal wound from Excalibur. In desperation to not lose another love, Emma uses her dark magic to tether Hook to Excalibur, making him another Dark One. Though Hook initially tried to fight the Darkness, he was eventually unable to resist his renewed thirst for vengeance. In determination to return to Storybrooke to kill Rumplestiltskin, Hook kills Merlin and uses his heart to enact the Dark Curse. Guilt-ridden over what she had done, Emma confronts Hook and steals his and everyone else’s memories. When Hook awoke back in Storybrooke, he remembered nothing of the last six weeks. While in Storybrooke, Hook tries to break Emma's curse through true love's kiss, as Belle tried years before with Rumplestiltskin. As before, this plan fails. A short while later, Emma tricks Hook into giving her his sword - the main ingredient she needs to reawaken Gold, who she plans to use to remove Excalibur. In this conversation, Hook takes responsibility for his past villainy, condemns his actions, and praises the man Rumplestiltskin once was as a man who was just "trying to keep his family together." In his mind, Rumplestiltskin became a monster, but Hook changed for the better. Eventually, Emma’s plan comes to fruition when she kidnaps Hook and Zelena, revealing her plan to kill the Wicked Witch after endowing her with the Darkness. The plan goes awry when Zelena restores her and Hook’s memories. Upon recalling what Emma did to him, Hook immediately renews his plot to revive every Dark One and kill Rumplestiltskin. However, after a confrontation with Emma and Regina, Hook has a crisis of conscience and turns on the Dark Ones. Subsequently, Hook sacrifices his life to destroy the Darkness once and for all. However, upon the discovery that Gold has betrayed Hook to take back his power, Emma blackmails him into helping her get into the Underworld, so that she may launch a mission to revive him.

In the Underworld, Hook is tortured by Hades. However, with the help of Milah, Emma rescues Hook from the Lord of the Underworld. Returning to the Underworld's replica of Snow and David's apartment, Hook confronts Gold about taking his sacrifice away, but lets it go for now, since he believes Gold helped save his life. When Emma tried to split her heart in order to share it with Hook, it is impossible. Returning to the cemetery, the heroes discover that Hades has chosen Emma, Regina, and Snow as the souls who will have to remain in the Underworld. Later, a guilt-ridden Hook informs Emma that he cannot return with Emma, even if they do defeat Hades, as he no longer believes himself worthy of her. However, after confronting his brother about his betraying the heroes to Hades and another betrayal centuries earlier, Hook forgives Liam and helps him move on. Afterward, Hook agrees to help defeat Hades and return to Storybrooke with Emma.

However, it turns out that she cannot give him half of her heart, as his body has decomposed too much in the absence of his soul. They attempt to find ambrosia to restore his flesh to normal, but find Hades chopped down the tree. He agrees to resolve his unfinished business, promising to not let it be Emma. When King Arthur is murdered by Hades, Hook teams up with him to find his weakness. They find the pages Hades had tried to keep from them, which tells of his weakness. Hook manages to send them to Emma through Henry's book, so that she may defeat Hades. Hook then proceeds to move on, as defeating Hades was his unfinished business and finds himself in Olympus. There, Zeus rewards him for his actions by reuniting him with Emma. However, it had not been Emma who defeated Hades, but the god's true love: Zelena, who realized Hades cared more about his own power than her. However, it was too late to prevent Hades's cold murder of [[Robin Hood (Once Upon a Time)|Robin Hood]], Regina's true love.

At Robin's funeral in the season finale, Emma tries to delicately break it to Regina that Hook has returned, but as Gold tethers part of the Olympian Crystal to the magic in Storybrooke, Hook hastily runs in to make sure everyone is alright. Regina quickly puts aside her feelings and goes with the heroes to find out what Gold's plan is. After Henry and Violet run off to destroy magic, Emma and Regina join together to rescue him. However, due to Gold's machinations, magic in Storybrooke has become unstable. As Zelena uses Merlin's wand to return the people from Camelot, Merida, and the Merry Men home, another portal traps Hook, Snow, David and Zelena on the Mysterious Island Nemo and Liam had fled to years before: the Land of Untold Stories. There, they run into Dr. Henry Jekyll and his evil alter-ego Mr. Hyde. Initially, Hyde believes the heroes to be in the employ of Gold, whom he despises, and holds them captive. With the help of Jekyll, the heroes escape and assist Jekyll in creating a serum which separates Hyde from himself. With the help of Henry and the Dragon, the heroes manage to return to the Land Without Magic with Jekyll.

=== Season 6 ===
As the heroes return to Storybrooke, they learn that Hyde has arrived with several beings from the Land of Untold Stories. Shortly upon his arrival, the heroes manage to imprison Hyde in the asylum. During this time, Hook begins to suspect that something is up with Emma, but the Savior is reluctant to tell him as she does not want to cause him concern. Instead, she voices her fears to [[Jiminy Cricket|Archie Hopper]]. In the episode "The Other Shoe," after Hook and Emma help Cinderella and her stepsister Clorinda against Lady Tremaine and the Evil Queen (newly separated from Regina), Emma puts her fears aside, and Hook moves into her house. During this time, as Gold tries to force Belle to share their child with him, Hook offers her asylum aboard his ship, out of guilt for having tried to kill her several times in the past. Ultimately, it is learned that Jekyll is not so different from Hyde. The Doctor manages to slip under the heroes' radar and get close to Belle, whom he hopes to kill, since he blames Rumplestiltskin for the death of Mary Lydgate. Hook manages to arrive in time and kill Jekyll. As Jekyll dies, so too does Hyde.

Later on, Hook learns that among the many people from the Land of Untold Stories who have returned are Nemo and his half-brother Liam. Believing Nemo dead, Liam seeks vengeance against Hook for both the deaths of Nemo and their father. On board the ''Nautilus'', Hook is nearly killed by Liam, but is rescued by Henry, who begins to look at Hook as a surrogate father. Hook knocks Liam unconscious and manages to escape. Back on land, Hook and Liam mend their differences, as the latter learns that his brother is not the same man he was when he killed Brennan Jones. They are further able to reconcile when they discover that the doctors at Storybrooke General Hospital managed to save Nemo's life. However, as time wore on, the citizens of Storybrooke become plagued by attacks from the Evil Queen, who cannot be killed so long as Regina lives. As he and Emma help combat against the Queen, they also try to prevent her visions of her own death from coming true by forming an alliance with a former Savior, [[Aladdin (Disney character)|Aladdin]]. However, Aladdin too became a problem, as after becoming a genie, it was the Queen's wish that sent Emma to an alternate reality in which she had never been the Savior. Though Regina went on a quest to rescue her friend, Hook was now separated from the woman he loved. At this same time, the man destined to kill Emma arrived in Storybrooke: Gideon, the son of Hook's nemesis Rumplestiltskin, as well as the younger brother of Emma's ex-boyfriend. After training under the Black Fairy, Gideon returned, neutralized the Evil Queen, and sought out his parents.

After Emma's return and subsequent defeating of Gideon, Hook consults with Archie about the prospect of seeking David's approval for Emma's hand in marriage. In order to do so, Hook agrees to help David learn who murdered his father. After stealing magic from Emma, they learn that David's father's last known location was in [[Pleasure Island (Pinocchio)|Pleasure Island]], a place in the Enchanted Forest Hook recalled having dealings with Neverland. This leads them to August Booth, who spent time there as a puppet before being made real. August reveals that, contrary to what David thought, Robert was sober when he died and had left to retrieve James. From this, David deduces that King George had ordered his father's death. When Hook attempts to stop David from exacting vengeance, the Prince handcuffs him to a bike rack. However, Hook manages to work his way free in time to stop David from killing George in his cell. Afterward, Hook receives David's approval. However, before he could propose to Emma, Hook receives some missing pages from Henry's book from August. From these missing pages, Hook recognizes a picture of David's father as Robert, a man he killed years before. Horrified at the realization that he killed Emma's grandfather, Hook changes his mind about proposing and pockets the ring.

After conferring with Dr. Hopper, Hook ultimately decides to tell Emma what he just found out so as to build an honest relationship with her. However, before he can muscle up the courage, Emma comes to him and reveals that she found the ring in Hook's things. Unwilling to tarnish the happy mood Emma's in with the dark truth, Hook kneels down and proposes, receiving an affirmative answer in return. Still guilty, he meets Nemo at the docks and after conferring with him about forgiveness, decides to burn his memories with a dreamcatcher. Emma catches him and is angry over him keeping secrets, ending their engagement until he can learn to change. He decides to go on an adventure with Nemo, in order to once again become the man that Emma needs, however after a talk with Snow on the docks who reminds him even the Evil Queen can get a happy ending, changes his mind and wants to go back to Emma. However, Gideon forcefully banishes him and keeps Emma's tears as a barrier to stop him from returning to Storybrooke.

Trapped on the Nautilus with Nemo's crew, he attempts to find kraken blood to get back to Storybrooke, but ends up saving Aladdin and Jasmine from it instead. They try to track down Jafar, and end up on Hangman's island, before which he exchanges goodbyes with Nemo and Liam. On Hangman's Island he meets Ariel and inadvertently sets Jafar free, however Jasmine is able to defeat him and restore Agrabah. Ariel lends him a shell phone which he uses to contact Emma and let her know that he is fighting his way back to her. He later tracks down Blackbeard and challenges him to a game of cards for a magic bean, and if suffering loss, agrees to hand over the Jolly Roger. He loses intentionally, and uses the bean to go to Storybrooke with Blackbeard, but ends up in Neverland instead due to Gideon's barrier. Blackbeard abandons him to the Lost Boys (the ones who remained behind after season 3), however Tiger Lily is able to save him before he is killed. She informs him of a great darkness on the horizon that can only be defeated by the Savior, which Hook realizes in shock is Emma. He agrees to bring back half of a magic wand that will aid Emma by using his shadow. The Lost Boys hold on to him before he can escape, but his shadow is able to escape with the wand and give it to Emma. Hook is about to be executed when Emma uses pixie dust from her mother to save Hook and return him to Storybrooke. He and Emma make amends, after which he proposes once again, receiving a "yes" in return. He is the first to drink from the goblet holding a sleeping curse that will break Snow and Charming's curse set by the Evil Queen, and also makes amends with Emma's father.

Hook and Emma enjoy a morning together before being interrupted by Snow's wedding plans. Afterward he gives the half wand to Regina so she could cast a locator spell to find the other half, and seeks out wedding venues with Emma, her parents, and Henry, per Snow's request. However, afterwards he and Emma agree that they will marry when the time is right, not when the Black Fairy is still at large. Hook helps the Charmings find the other half wand at Granny's, and later that night asks Henry to be his best man for the wedding the next day, thinking the Black Fairy has been defeated by Gold. As he prepares, he is devastated to find out the Black Fairy is still at large and Emma plans on facing her alone. He knocks out Gold with dreamshade to buy Emma some time, but the Black Fairy saves her son. He later appears frozen as the Black Fairy nearly kills Emma, but Emma is able to stop her with a song in her heart and save her family. In the past, it is shown he met Snow and Charming when they inadvertently set off a spell which made everyone burst into song in Misthaven. He sang about revenge on the Dark One, and when realizing they have him in their dungeon, agrees to give them safe passage on his ship so they could confront the Evil Queen.

He later marries Emma, realizing they both want to go through with the wedding regardless of villainous threats. He rejoices with the rest of the town with song and dance, but as the clock strikes 6 the town is engulfed with the Black Fairy's curse.

Hook is sent back to the Enchanted Forest with Snow, David, Regina and Zelena. There they realize all the realms, including Oz and Agrabah, are crumbling and fading into nonexistence because the Black Fairy has wiped Emma's belief in them. Making Emma believe again becomes his first priority and he climbs the beanstalk with David in hopes of finding a magic bean, the same one he and Emma had climbed in season 2 on their first adventure. Him and David manage to find a bean but are chased away by a dragon hiding in the giants' castle. They attempt to escape down the beanstalk, but the world is still crumbling and Hook loses his grip and falls. The beanstalk also falls, pulling David with it. However, Snow manages to find both of them from under the wreckage and pushes Hook to go back to Emma. He makes it back to Regina and Zelena, tells them of his plan, but the magic in the bean is already fading. The Enchanted Forest continues to crumble until they are trapped in the center of the castle, when all of a sudden the destruction stops, as Henry has caused Emma to believe again. Rumplestiltskin kills the Black Fairy, and the group is sent back to Storybrooke. However, her last command for Gideon to kill the Savior remains and Hook is able to reunite with Emma just before she faces Gideon in the final battle. Gideon stabs Emma who willingly sacrifices herself, as Hook watches with horror, but Henry wakes her with true love's kiss. Hook reunites with Emma once more as a happy ending montage is shown for all—David decides to move into a farmhouse with Snow and take care of Neal, leaving Hook to become the new deputy of Storybrooke and ride off into the sunset in Emma's car. At the end, everyone is shown gathered at Granny's for dinner, as the book finally ends with the words: "They lived happily ever after."

=== Season 7 ===

Years after the final battle, Hook and Henry have kept up with sword-fighting practices as a teenage Henry prepares to leave home for a new adventure. Emma is worried about him going off on his own and missing more of his life but Hook reassures her and shows her a magical bottle that allows a message to be sent across realms. The bottle is given to Henry to take with him as he leaves.

Many more years later, an adult Henry has found himself in trouble with Lady Tremaine in a new realm. Right before he's about to get captured, he uses the magic bottle to call on Hook, Emma, and Regina for help. Hook and Regina drop in through a portal and are able to free him. A little while later, Hook offers to go to the port to see if people have heard anything about Cinderella. There, he comes across the Hook from the Wish Realm, who had also been called over due to Henry's bottle message. The wish Hook explains that ever since meeting Emma in the Wish Realm years back, he had been traveling the realms in hopes of reuniting with her. He knocks out the original Hook in hopes of taking his place and getting a ride back to Storybrooke to be with Emma. The wish Hook finds Lady Tremaine, who physically transforms him into his younger form in exchange for helping getting rid of Henry.

When the Wish Hook meets up with Henry again, Henry suspects that Hook hadn't been telling him the truth about Emma. Before  he gets a real answer, Emma arrives through a portal and reveals to Henry that she's actually pregnant. As she and Henry celebrate the news, Wish Hook realizes his mistake and leaves them to find Hook and switch back. When he gets back to the port, he finds that Hook has already woken up and the two engage in a fight that ends with Wish Hook getting fatally stabbed. He tells Hook that he had intended to switch back because he has had a daughter himself, who was trapped in a prison by a vengeful witch, and did not want Hook to be separated from his child as well. Emma manages to heal Wish Hook and later tells him that he should travel with Henry to look for his daughter. After saying goodbye to Henry, Hook and Emma head through a portal back to Storybrooke.

Afterwards, Henry and the other characters manage to foil a plot by Wish Rumple to wreak havoc on all the realms, and end up bringing them all to Storybrooke. Regina is elected "The Good Queen" of all the realms, and Hook and Emma attend her coronation with their baby girl Hope.

=== Wish Hook ===
In season 6 episode "[[Wish You Were Here (Once Upon a Time)|Wish You Were Here]]", the Evil Queen used one of her genie wishes to wish that Emma Swan had never become the savior. The wish created a whole new duplicate realm, known as the Wish Realm, which consists of alternate versions of the Enchanted Forest characters that come with different backstories for the 28 years after the point in which Regina never got to cast her curse. This includes an alternate version of Hook, who has an identical backstory to the original Hook's before that point in time, however, following that moment, he has been given an entirely different life and is his own separate character.

It is revealed in “A Pirate’s Life” that the main Hook on the series was now the wish realm version, as he is the one who has traveled with Henry and ended up being taken by the curse that resulted in Hyperion Heights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2017/10/13/once-upon-a-time-recap-season-7-episode-2-emma-pregnant/|title=Once Upon a Time Creators Break Down Emma's Big Reveal and What the Hook Twist Means for Regina and Rumple|first=Matt Webb|last=Mitovich|date=October 13, 2017|accessdate=October 15, 2017|work=TVLine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Season 6====

After Emma awakens in the realm from her spell caused by the Evil Queen's wish, she and the wish realm version of August head out to find a magical tree that he can use to build her a new wardrobe to take her back home to Storybrooke. Before they reach it, the two come across a wish Hook, who is old, fat, and unkempt. He intends to kidnap Emma for a reward but Emma manages to knock him out and later completes her mission, leaving the still-existing realm behind.

====Season 7====
After meeting Emma during her brief time in the Wish Realm, Hook believes that she is his true love and spends the following years traveling the realms in search of her. One day, he finds himself in the Magical Forest, after Henry's call for help ends up bringing over both living versions of "Captain Hook." As he also heard Emma's name through the bottle, he assumes that she is also currently in the same realm and knocks out the original Hook, with plans to assume his identity and be the one who gets to go back with her. He finds Lady Tremaine, who he is revealed to have some sort of history with, and she agrees to transform him into the original Hook's physically younger form.

He meets back up with Henry, who then suspects that Hook is hiding something about Emma. As he's being confronted, Emma appears and reveals that she and the original Hook are expecting a baby. Hook feels guilty and tries to switch back, though not before the original Hook finds him and stabs him in the abdomen. As he's dying, Hook reveals that he was also a father and had a daughter who had been trapped in a prison by a vengeful witch. After initially being able to sneak in and play chess with her, his heart had been poisoned and he had lost track of her, with only a chess piece as his memory of her. He had hoped that an act of true love from Emma would be able to help him. The original Hook gets Emma to successfully heal him and when Henry decides that he wants to continue on his adventure, Emma suggests that Henry and Hook keep each other company. The original Hook and Emma say goodbye and leave the Magical Forest, and Hook begins his journey to finding his missing daughter with Henry and Regina in tow.

Soon after, Hook, Regina and Henry meet Tiana and Ella (Jacinda) at a resistance camp formed to overthrow Lady Tremaine, and discuss plans about ambushing her castle.

Some time many years later, Hook gets swept up in a curse and is given a new persona as '''Officer Rogers''' in the neighborhood of Hyperion Heights in Seattle. He gets promoted to a detective and is assigned to Weaver (a cursed Rumple) as his new partner. On his first day, he is tasked by Victoria and Weaver to frame Henry for theft, as Victoria continues to mess with Jacinda. He ultimately goes against them and  protects Henry, though Weaver oddly ends up praising him for his moral code. Later, he meets up with Henry and tells him about a missing girl that he had tried to find earlier during his time as a cop, and remembers the time Emma healed him from his stab wound, although not her name. The two, along with Roni (a cursed Regina), decide to form an alliance against Victoria.

Some time later he meets up with Henry and Roni and learns about a building commissioner that works for Victoria Belfrey, whom he later spies on and arrests. However, Weaver sets him free, assuring Rogers that the commissioner would spy on Belfrey for them now.

Weaver and Rogers later discuss Tilly's (a cursed Alice) role in Rumple's case against Belfrey. Rogers is concerned for her well-being, and questions Weaver's treatment of her. Later, Tilly, regaining some of her pre-curse memories, shoots Weaver, saying Rumpelstiltskin had told her to do so. However, Weaver survives, and Rogers is there to meet him when he wakes up in the hospital, where he tells him to file a report, saying a masked man had shot him, and lets Tilly go. Rogers meets with Tilly in the waiting room and plays chess with her.

In a flashback, it is revealed that the Wish Realm version of Regina was not able to defeat Wish Realm Snow and Charming because they had stolen her magic. She appoints Hook with the task of finding a magic flower that could help both of them, which he does by the aid of Rapunzel. When he goes back to free her from her tower, she seduces him. In the morning, she shows herself to actually be Gothel and reveals that her daughter with Hook had been born by a magical speeding process initiated by the flower, which frees her from her prison. While she invites him to escape with her, he refuses, giving the Jolly Roger to Mr. Smee and staying behind to take care of his baby, who he names Alice after his mother.

In the same episode, Rogers is haunted by the missing case of Eloise Gardner, who he reveals to Henry disappeared the same night he gave up patrolling the neighborhood in favor of a drink. He asks Tilly if she has any information on her whereabouts, and she gives him a scrap of paper matching a drawing in Eloise's notebook and informs him that she died years ago. However, Rogers finds out it is actually Weaver's doing and Belfrey is involved, and frees Gothel who was trapped in Belfrey's tower, mistaking her for Eloise.

Later, "Eloise" brings Rogers a cake to thank him, but it is hinted that she poisoned it when Roni (now awake as Regina) comes by and throws it in the trash. Rogers goes to meet Alice and brings her lunch and a chess set. In a flashback, it is shown that when Hook was with Regina and Henry at Tiana's resistance camp, he had reunited with Alice. However, he could not touch her as his heart had been poisoned, which causes Alice to run away in distress. She sends Ella and Henry back with her father's white chess knight.

== Character development and reception ==
In 2012, O'Donoghue was cast as [[Captain Hook]]/Killian Jones in the [[Once Upon a Time (season 2)|second season]] and was initially hired as a supporting character, but he was made a series regular before his first episode even aired. Hook always had an interest in the Savior, [[Emma Swan]] played by [[Jennifer Morrison]] but he then realizes this is the first time he felt love again ever since his first love, Milah died. He knew there was always something between them and then finally after many challenges, Emma and Killian become an item, and were confirmed as true love in "Firebird" when their love managed to pass the test and open the doors to the ambrosia, which as said earlier, only true love could pass this test. Many fans call their relationship "Captain Swan." [[Christina Perri]] even dedicated her song [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9tc9R_Y3FY "The Words"] to this popular fictional couple. The couple has been nominated for People's Choice Awards best on-screen chemistry and Teen Choice Award's Best TV Liplock.

'''James Nowlan''' (1862&lt;ref name="1169 blog"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://1169andcounting.blogspot.com/2003_07_06_archive.html |title=James Nowlan, GAA President and Sinn Féin activist |accessdate=1 December 2008 |work=1169 And Counting..... |publisher= |date=6–8 July 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; – June 1924) was the President of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] (GAA) from 1901 to 1921 and is the longest serving president of the organisation. He was also a [[Sinn Féin]] representative and member of the [[Gaelic League]].&lt;ref name="1169 blog"/&gt; In 2009 he was named in the [[Sunday Tribune]]'s list of the ''125 Most Influential People In GAA History''.&lt;ref name="125 tribune"/&gt;

==Early life==
Nowlan was born in [[Monasterevin]],&lt;ref name="1169 blog"/&gt; [[County Kildare]] in 1862 and is listed in the local church as being baptised at Cowpasture, Monasterevin on 25 May 1862. His father, Patrick Nowlan, was an early member of the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]] (IRB) and friend of [[James Stephens (Fenian)|James Stephens]].&lt;ref name="walsh"&gt;{{cite book|title= James Nowlan - The Alderman and the GAA in His Time | ISBN = 9781782801993 | author = Jim Walsh | publisher = Independent Publishing Network |date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patrick Nowlan was a [[Cooper (profession)|cooper]] from [[Kilkenny|Kilkenny city]] and possibly moved from there to work at Cassidy's Whiskey in Monasterevin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.kilkennypeople.ie/sport/gaelic-games/james-nowlan-who-was-he-1-5740380 | publisher= Kilkenny People | title =James Nowlan - who was he? |date=13 December 2013 |accessdate= 5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="125 tribune"&gt;{{cite news |authors=Enda McEvoy, Kieran Shannon, Dave Hannigan |title=125 Most Influential People In GAA History |work=[[Sunday Tribune]] |page= |date=4 January 2009 |accessdate=28 January 2009 |url=http://www.tribune.ie/article/2009/jan/04/125-most-influential-people-in-gaa-history-100-76/ |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090809020609/http://www.tribune.ie/article/2009/jan/04/125-most-influential-people-in-gaa-history-100-76/ |archivedate= 9 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; James Nowlan also trained as a cooper.&lt;ref name="gaa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaa.ie/about-the-gaa/gaa-history/gaa-presidents/ |publisher=Official GAA Website |accessdate=5 January 2015 |title=GAA History &gt; GAA Presidents |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503201547/http://gaa.ie/about-the-gaa/gaa-history/gaa-presidents/ |archivedate= 3 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/pages/1911/Kilkenny/Kilkenny_Urban_No__2/Troysgate__East_/527887/ | publisher= National Archives of Ireland |date= 1911 |title= Household Return (Form A) - Residents of a house 2 in Troysgate (East) (Kilkenny Urban No. 2, Kilkenny) | quote= Listed as: Nowlan James, aged 47, Male, cooper by trade, relation to head of the house hold as Brother, religion listed as Roman Catholic.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Nowlan was a member of the [[Gaelic League]], a lifelong supporter of the [[Irish language]] revival movement and a supporter of [[Sinn Féin]] from its foundation in 1905. In 1898 he was elected an [[alderman]] of [[Kilkenny]] Corporation.&lt;ref name="1169 blog"/&gt; He used his time in this position to help promote the GAA, which had been set up 14 years prior and was a relatively new organisation at the time.&lt;ref name="1169 blog"/&gt; In 1900 he became the first chairman of the [[Leinster GAA|Leinster Council]] of the GAA. He was elected President of the GAA nationally at the 1901 Congress held in September of that year.&lt;ref name="1169 blog"/&gt; He would hold that position for twenty years - making him the longest serving president.&lt;ref name="gaa"/&gt; During his time in office he attempted to steer the organisation on a more [[Irish republicanism|republican]] path.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Following the [[Easter Rising]], Nowlan was arrested by the British in May 1916 and [[internment|interned]] without trial in [[Frongoch]], [[Wales]].&lt;ref name="1169 blog"/&gt; In August of that year he was released and continued with his GAA and Sinn Féin duties.&lt;ref name="1169 blog"/&gt; He publicly voiced support for the [[Irish Republican Army]] during the [[Anglo-Irish War]] in the 1920s.&lt;ref name="1169 blog"/&gt;

At the 1921 Congress, held in March of that year, Nowlan retired as GAA President, and was appointed ''Honorary Life President'' of the association &amp;mdash; the only person to be so honoured.&lt;ref name="1169 blog"/&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Nowlan died in June 1924 in his mid-70s.&lt;ref name="1169 blog"/&gt; [[Nowlan Park]], the GAA stadium in his native [[Kilkenny]], was renamed in his honour three years later.&lt;ref name="1169 blog"/&gt; He was buried in Glasnevin cemetery. There was no headstone on his grave until 2013 when the GAA erected a Celtic cross.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.press.ie/The-Unveiling-of-the-Headstone-of-Alderman-James-Nowlan-GAA-President-1901-to-1921.htm |title=Irish Press Releases - The Unveiling of the Headstone of Alderman James Nowlan GAA President 1901 to 1921 |publisher=Press.ie |date=2013-07-18 |accessdate=2013-08-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327023106/http://www.press.ie/The-Unveiling-of-the-Headstone-of-Alderman-James-Nowlan-GAA-President-1901-to-1921.htm |archivedate=2014-03-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2016 the GAA unveiled a new trophy named The James Nowlan Cup to be presented to the All-Ireland under-21 hurling champions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New All-Ireland U21HC trophy unveiled|url=http://www.hoganstand.com/ArticleForm.aspx?ID=260627|website=www.hoganstand.com|publisher=Hogan Stand|accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leila Janah''' is the Founder and [[Chief Executive Officer|CEO]] of [[Samasource]] and [[LXMI]], two companies that share a common social mission to end global poverty by giving work to people in need. She is also the author of ''Give Work: Reversing Poverty One Job at a Time''&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and co-author of ''America's Moment: Creating Opportunity in the Connected Age'', a book by Rework America: A Markle Initiative.

==Early life==
Janah was born on October 9, 1982 in [[Lewiston, New York]], near Niagara Falls,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crunchbase.com/person/leila-chirayath-janah Leila Janah's Crunchbase Profile]&lt;/ref&gt; and grew up in [[San Pedro, Los Angeles]], California. She is the daughter of Indian immigrants, who came to the United States with nothing. Janah describes her childhood as being difficult, often due to a lack of financial security.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As a teenager, Janah worked many jobs, including babysitting and tutoring.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.realsimple.com/work-life/life-strategies/job-career/leila-janah-samasource|title=How 1 Woman Changed 30,000 Lives|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attended the [[California Academy of Mathematics and Science]]. She won a scholarship at 17 through [[AFS Intercultural Programs|American Field Services]], and convinced them to let her spend it teaching in Ghana&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twit.tv/shows/triangulation/episodes/316?autostart=false|title=Triangulation 316 Leila Janah: Give Work {{!}} TWiT.TV|website=TWiT.tv|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; where she spent 6 months during her senior year of high school.&lt;ref name="stratford"&gt;http://www.stratford.edu/tech_talk_shows/shows/2011-03-01&lt;/ref&gt; In Ghana, Janah taught English to young students in the village of Akuapem, many of whom were blind.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Making-a-difference/2014/1023/Leila-Janah-helps-people-in-the-developing-world-find-work-near-home|title=Leila Janah Helps People in the Developing World Find Work Near Home|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Janah has cited this early experience as sparking her passion for working in Africa, and she continued to visit the continent during her time in college.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Janah attended [[Harvard University]], graduating in 2005 with a degree in African Development Studies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.linkedin.com/in/leilajanah&lt;/ref&gt; While at Harvard, Janah conducted fieldwork in [[Mozambique]], [[Senegal]] and [[Rwanda]] and consulted to and authored papers for the [[World Bank]]'s Development Research Group and [[Ashoka: Innovators for the Public|Ashoka]] on social and economic rights.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Career==

Upon graduation, Janah worked as a management consultant with [[Katzenbach Partners]] , focusing on healthcare, mobile and outsourcing companies. One of Janah's first assignments with Katzenbach Partners was managing a call center in [[Mumbai]]. At the call center Janah met a young man who traveled each day by rickshaw from [[Dharavi]], one of the largest slums in South Asia, to work at the center. Janah has cited this experience as sparking the inspiration for [[Samasource]], the non-profit she founded in 2008.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
 
Janah left Katzenbach Partners in 2007 to become a visiting scholar at [[Stanford University]] with the Program on Global Justice, founded by law professor Joshua Cohen. That year, she co-founded Incentives for Global Health with [[Thomas Pogge]], Leitner Professor of Philosophy and International Affairs at [[Yale University|Yale]], and Aidan Hollis, a Professor of Economics at the [[University of Calgary]], which established a blueprint for incentivizing the development of new drugs for neglected diseases.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.samasource.org/about/team&lt;/ref&gt;

===Samasource===

In 2008, Janah launched [[Samasource]] (then called Market for Change), an idea that was inspired by her time spent in Africa and her experience managing a call center in Mumbai.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Samasource is a not-for-profit business with the mission to reduce global poverty by giving dignified online work to people living in poverty. Samasource uses an internet based model called [[microwork]] to break down large digital projects into smaller, easily trainable tasks for workers to complete at delivery centers. Samasource offers five services, including [[machine learning]], data verification and image annotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.samasource.org/services|title=Samasource {{!}} Data Project Management {{!}} Data Solution for Businesses|website=Samasource {{!}} Data Project Management {{!}} Data Solution for Businesses|access-date=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of August, 2016, Samasource reports that it has impacted 32,265 people, which includes both direct Samasource workers and their dependents.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.samasource.org/impact|title=Samasource {{!}} Data Project Management {{!}} Data Solution for Businesses|website=Samasource {{!}} Data Project Management {{!}} Data Solution for Businesses|access-date=2016-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samasource also reports that their workers increase their income by 3.7x over the course of four years.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Janah got the capital to start Samasource from winning $14,000 in a business-plan competition at Stanford.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She raised an additional $30,000 in a European business plan competition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2009, Samasource was selected to participate in fbFund, a $10m seed fund to support developers and entrepreneurs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Janah got her first contract for Samasource with a company called [[Benetech]], a non-profit social enterprise that provides technology solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sussman|first=Anna Louie|title=WOMAN OF THE WEEK: LEILA JANAH|url=http://womenintheworld.org/index.php/stories/entry/woman-of-the-week-leila-janah1|publisher=[[Women in the World Foundation]]|accessdate=25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samasource has been named one of [[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company's]] "Most Innovative Companies"&lt;sup&gt;[[Samasource#cite note-5|[5]]]&lt;/sup&gt; and counts [[Walmart]], [[Google]] and [[eBay]] among its clients.

===Samaschool===

In 2013, Janah founded [[Samaschool]] (previously SamaUSA), a program that moves people out of poverty by providing digital skills training and a connection to internet-based jobs that pay a living wage&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;. Samaschool runs in-person programs in Arkansas, California, New York and Kenya, and also provides online classes that are available internationally. Samaschool courses train students in digital literary, workforce readiness and portfolio building.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.samaschool.org/trainings|title=Samaschool|website=Samaschool|access-date=2016-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Samaschool started with a pilot program in the [[Bayview-Hunters Point, San Francisco|Bayview-Hunters Point]] neighborhood in [[San Francisco]]. The model originally focused on training students to perform digital work competitively, to prepare them for success on online work sites like [[oDesk]] and [[Elance]]. The program was first introduced in a 2011 TechCrunch article&lt;sup&gt;[[Samasource#cite note-12|[12]]]&lt;/sup&gt; which attracted controversy for its assertion that Americans could compete with African and Asian workers who can afford to take assignments that pay lower fees. Samaschool has since shifted its focus to teach students the skills necessary to gain work in the [[Temporary work|gig economy]]. Samaschool is funded in part by the [[Robin Hood Foundation|Robinhood Foundation]].

===Samahope===

Janah founded Samahope in 2012, the first crowdfunding platform that directly funded doctors who provide life-changing medical treatments for women and children in poor communities. Samahope enabled anyone anywhere to directly fund doctors' life-changing medical treatments for women and children in need. Samahope was built on the belief that transparent funding mechanisms could help close the global surgery gap and ensure that all people have access to medical treatments&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/in/leilajanah|title=Leila Janah|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samahope combined with Johnson &amp; Johnson's new global health platform, CaringCrowd, at the close of December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-we-merged-samahope-case-nonprofit-ma-leila-janah?trk=mp-reader-card|title=Why We Merged: Samahope and the Case for Nonprofit M&amp;A|date=2016-04-07|access-date=2016-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Janah spoke about the decision to merge with Caring Crowd in a [[LinkedIn]] post, citing efficiency and branding as the two biggest factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-we-merged-samahope-case-nonprofit-ma-leila-janah|title=Why We Merged: Samahope and the Case for Nonprofit M&amp;A|date=2016-04-07|access-date=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===LXMI===
In 2015, Janah co-founded LXMI, a for profit luxury skin care brand.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-does-your-skincare-regimen-have-do-ending-leila-janah|title=Can your skincare routine help end poverty?|last=Janah|first=Leila|date=October 9, 2015|website=LinkedIn|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Built on the idea of beauty in action™, LXMI employs marginalized women in the rural Nile Valley communities&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; to harvest LXMI ingredients and reports that their producers earn 3x the average local wages.&lt;ref&gt;http://lxmi.com/&lt;/ref&gt; LXMI is named after the [[Lakshmi|Hindu goddess of beauty and prosperity]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

LXMI was incubated at Samasource. Janah and Samasource are members of an LLC which owns LXMI, along with LXMI employees and investors. Currently, the jointly owned LLC owns 36% of LXMI, with Janah owning 24% and Samasource owning 12%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://media.wix.com/ugd/e4cc5f_ac87fe6674474dac825c44ede5c38170.pdf|title=Samasource Independent Auditors' Report and Consolidated Financial Statements|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LLC was set up for LXMI in order for Janah to donate the 1/3 of her shares back to Samasource in a way that would give Samasource oversight in the company. If LXMI pays a dividend or is acquired, Samasource would stand to benefit. [[Jones Day]] advised on the arrangement and referenced experience with other similar structures.

==Awards and honors==
Janah is a Young Global Leader of the World Economic Forum, a Director of CARE USA, a 2012 TechFellow, recipient of the inaugural Club de Madrid Young Leadership Award, and the youngest person to win a [[Heinz Award]] in 2014 when she received the 19th Annual [[Heinz Awards|Heinz Award]] in Technology, the Economy and Employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Heinz Awards: Leila Janah|url=http://www.heinzawards.net/recipients/leila-janah|website=The Heinz Awards|publisher=The Heinz Awards|accessdate=August 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She also received the Secretary’s Innovation Award for the Empowerment of Women and Girls from Hillary Clinton in 2012, and is a former Visiting Scholar at the [[Stanford University]] Program on Global Justice&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.samasource.org/about/team#leila Samasource website]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Australian National University]]’s Centre for Applied Philosophy and Public Ethics. She is a recipient of the Rainer Arnhold and [[TED (conference)|TEDIndia]] Fellowships, and serves on the San Francisco board of [[TechSoup Global]] and the Social Enterprise Institute.&lt;ref name="stratford"/&gt;

Janah was included as one of [[Elle (magazine)|Elle Magazine's]] "Women in Tech"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.elle.com/culture/tech/a35725/women-in-tech-2016/|title=Meet Elle's 2016 Women in Tech|last=|first=|date=2016-05-13|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2016 and The New York Times T Magazine’s Five Visionary Tech Entrepreneurs Who Are Changing the World]” in 2015.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5104">'''Luisa Battistati'''&lt;ref&gt;Her spelling in Hale's work is "Louisa", but this is a typical spelling of Anglophones when dealing with Italian names.&lt;/ref&gt; was an Italian 19th-century woman who is recorded in American writer [[Sarah Josepha Hale]]’s ''Sketches of all distinguished women'' (1853) as a heroine of the insurrection against [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] rule that had taken place in [[Lombardy]]  known as the [[Five Days of Milan]]. The revolt took place during the period 18–22 March 1848 and was successful in expelling the Austrian garrison, commanded by [[Josef Radetzky]], from the city. Radetzky would re-enter Milan on 6 August of that year, however, and Austria remained in control of the city until 1859.

Hale wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A native of [[Stradella, Lombardy|Stradella]], [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Sardinia]],&lt;ref name="stradella"/&gt; and a [[mantua-maker]] at [[Milan]], [Luisa Battistati] displayed remarkable courage during the five days of the Revolution at Milan, in 1848. On Sunday, March 10th, she disarmed a cavalry soldier, though he carried a [[carbine]]. She placed herself at the head of the Poppietti bridge, and steadily continued there, fighting against the enemy during the 20th, 21st, and 22d days [of March],&lt;ref&gt;i.e. the final three days of the rebellion.&lt;/ref&gt; heading a valiant band of young men, and killing a [[Croat]]e {{sic}} at every shot. She defended the large establishment at Vettabia,&lt;ref&gt;Probably this refers to the district of the Vettabbia canal, to the south of the city.&lt;/ref&gt; which contained 580 persons, being the edifice in which the widows and their children, and other females took refuge when [[Frederick I Barbarossa|Barbaressa]] {{sic}}&lt;ref name="barbarossa"/&gt; stormed Milan. This young woman was, in 1850, married, and doing duty in the civic guard.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Her entry in [[Henry Gardiner Adams]]’s ''A Cyclopaedia of Female Biography'' (1857) is identical down to the spelling,&lt;ref&gt;The Emperor Barbarossa again appears as ‘Barbaressa’.&lt;/ref&gt; save for the statement that ‘[t]o this woman must be given a place in history, beside the [[Agustina de Aragón|heroine of Saragossa]], and other examples of female intrepidity’, while the description of Battistati in [[Ellen Creathorne Clayton]]’s ''Female Warriors : Memorials of Female Valour and Heroism, from the Mythological Ages to the Present Era'' (1879) is a paraphrase of Hale’s text.&lt;ref&gt;Not only does it read like a paraphrase, with no additional information added, but the bibliography to ''Female Warriors'' makes specific mention of Hale’s work: see [https://archive.org/stream/femalewarriorsme01clayiala#page/xiv/ vol. 1, p. xv].&lt;/ref&gt; She also appears in [[Jessica Amanda Salmonson]]’s ''The Encyclopedia of Amazons'' (1991).

==Notes==
{{reflist|refs=
&lt;ref name="stradella"&gt;"Sardinia" is for [[Kingdom of Sardinia]], then including what are now [[Piedmont]], [[Liguria]] and [[Sardinia]]. There were a number of places in the Kingdom of Sardinia called Stradella, including Cascina Stradella (pop. 24 in 2001) near [[Refrancore]] in the [[Province of Asti]] and a village (pop. 50) near [[Gambolò]] in the [[Lomellina]] to the south of [[Vigevano]]. But the [[Stradella, Lombardy|Stradella]] (pop. c. 10,000) in the [[Oltrepò Pavese]] seems the most likely. (Population figures from the 2001 census: [http://dawinci.istat.it/daWinci/jsp/MD/dawinciMD.jsp?a1=m0GG0c0I0&amp;a2=mG0Y8048f8&amp;n=1UH90T09OG0&amp;v=1UH07B07R750000 Province of Asti] and [http://dawinci.istat.it/daWinci/jsp/MD/dawinciMD.jsp?a1=m0GG0c0I0&amp;a2=mG0Y8048f8&amp;n=1UH90T09OG0&amp;v=1UH07B07RK50000  Province of Pavia])&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Since graduating from Georgetown, Brown is now a Public Interest Law Scholar at [[Northeastern University School of Law]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northeastern.edu/law/pdfs/financial-aid/pils-bios2016.pdf "Celebrating the Public Interest Law Scholars Program: Recipient Biographies for the Classes of 2003-2018"], ''[[Northeastern University School of Law]]'', January 2016, page 19.&lt;/ref&gt; In Massachusetts, Brown first wrote and introduced legislation in 2010 on autism and developmental disabilities training for law enforcement, including corrections officers, and has continued to lobby for passage of that bill.&lt;ref&gt;General Court of Massachusetts, [http://www.mass.gov/legis/journal/hj062310.pdf "Journal of the House"], 23 June 2010, page 1498.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Segelbaum, Dani. [http://www.milforddailynews.com/article/20160209/NEWS/160205991 "Student pushes bill on autism training"], ''[[Milford Daily News]]'', 9 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown worked as a policy analyst for the [[Autistic Self Advocacy Network]], a national disability rights organization led by and for autistic people until 2015,&lt;ref&gt;Autistic Self Advocacy Network, [http://autisticadvocacy.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ASAN-2015-Annual-Report.pdf "2015 Annual Report"].&lt;/ref&gt; and co-founded the [[Washington Metro Disabled Students Collective]].&lt;ref&gt;Washington Metro Disabled Students Collective, [https://disabledstudentsdc.org/leadership/ "Leadership"].&lt;/ref&gt; Brown is also a former Patricia Morrissey Disability Policy Fellow at the [[Institute for Educational Leadership]].&lt;ref&gt;Institute for Educational Leadership, [http://ramp.iel.org/node/183 "IEL Celebrates White House Champions of Change"], 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Brown wrote a petition demanding school district-wide policy changes in [[Mercer County, Kentucky]] after viewing local news coverage of an incident in which Christopher Baker, a nine year old autistic student, was punished by being placed inside a large bag.&lt;ref&gt;Schreiner, Bruce. [http://archive.boston.com/news/education/k_12/articles/2011/12/22/school_accused_of_putting_autistic_student_in_bag/ "School accused of putting autistic student in bag"], ''[[Associated Press]]'', ''[[Boston Globe]]'', 22 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The petition gained over 200,000 signatures&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Lydia. "Petitioning Special Education, Mercer County Board of Education Emma Jean Tamme and 14 others: End abuse of Autistic students in Mercer County, Kentucky", ''[[Change.org]]'', December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and news coverage by the [[Associated Press]]&lt;ref&gt;Schreiner, Bruce.

In 2013, Brown co-organized a protest outside the [[Food and Drug Administration]] White Oak Campus in [[Maryland]] against the [[Judge Rotenberg Educational Center|Judge Rotenberg Center]], which is known for its use of painful [[aversives]] as a form of [[behavioral modification]] on people with [[developmental disabilities]], including many [[autistic]] people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media-dis-n-dat.blogspot.com/2013/01/fda-meets-on-school-electric-shock.html "FDA meets on school electric shock device used on disabled students, warns of violations"], 11 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in 2014, Brown testified against the Judge Rotenberg Center's use of electric shock aversives at a Food and Drug Administration advisory panel hearing.&lt;ref&gt;[[Food and Drug Administration]].

[http://www.autistichoya.net/judge-rotenberg-center/ "Judge Rotenberg Center Living Archive"], last updated 22 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahabir Pun is a person with phenomenal qualities, he is always ready to eradicate different problems inside the country.

== Early life and education==

Born and raised in Nangi, a remote village in the mountainous district [[Myagdi District]] of western Nepal, Pun spent his childhood grazing cattle and sheep and attending a village school without paper, pencils, textbooks or qualified teachers. Traditionally, the local people had no education, and most men joined the British [[Gurkha]] army. Pun's life changed dramatically when his father, a retired Gurkha, took the remarkable step of moving the family to the southern plain of Nepal and investing their entire savings in his son's education. After finishing high school, Pun worked as a teacher for about 12 years in four schools, while supporting his brothers' and sisters' education. In 1989, after numerous applications to UK and US universities, he succeeded in gaining a partial scholarship to the [[University of Nebraska at Kearney]], from which he graduated in 1996 with a bachelor's degree in Science Education. After graduation, he returned to his native village, twenty-four years after having left there as a child. It was in Nangi that he recognised the critical need for sustainable education, and began to formulate his goal of creating a high school to serve as a model for local educational and economic development. Pun founded the Himanchal High School with a special focus on computer education and other programmes with income-generating capacity. He then returned to the University of Nebraska for a master's degree in Educational Administration, which he completed in 2001.&lt;ref name=Ashoka&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ashoka.org/fellow/2754 |title=Mahabir Pun - Ashoka.org |accessdate=2010-11-01 |year=2002 |publisher=[[Ashoka Foundation]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Himanchal&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.himanchal.org/mahabir-pun/ |title=Mahabir Pun |accessdate=2010-11-01 |year=2008 |publisher=Himanchal Educational Foundation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational and economic development==
[[File:TeleNepal.jpg|thumb|Mahabir Pun hand-making a satellite dish in [[Nepal]]]]

While in the United States of America, Pun had recognised that information technology had the potential to transform the education system and the economy of his village, and he had taken courses to acquire the skills needed to assemble, refurbish and use computers. On his return to Nepal, he successfully campaigned for the donation of used computers from Japan, Malaysia, Australia, [[Singapore]], and the USA, and powered them with two small [[Micro hydro|hydro generators]] (donated by Singaporean climbers on their way to [[Mount Everest]]) installed in a nearby stream. Pun began teaching computer classes to students and fellow teachers, but it proved impossible to establish a telephone connection to the nearest city, [[Pokhara]], and the Internet. Pun e-mailed the [[BBC]], asking for ideas. The BBC publicised his dilemma, and soon volunteers from Europe and the USA responded. In 2001, donors and volunteers helped him to rig a wireless connection between Nangi and the neighbouring village of Ramche, using small handmade TV dish antennae mounted in trees. Small grants soon led to the construction of improvised mountaintop relay stations and a link to [[Pokhara]]. By 2003, Nangi had a wireless connection to the Internet. Later, Pun brought in more used computers donated from abroad, distributed them to other schools in other villages, and began work to develop a wireless distance-learning project supported by income-generating ventures.

Pun's work on distance learning and online educational services constitutes the first attempt in Nepal to address the scarcity of qualified teachers through technology. He took steps to ensure the success and growth of his projects, by arranging for other teachers to attend a computer training course in Pokhara, starting economic projects to fund students' expenses and teachers' salaries, and by attracting hundreds of international volunteers with wide-ranging skills. He has since built a new cultural centre, and has developed communication links for yak farmers, as well as new ventures to hc international trekking and tour groups. He has, therefore, succeeded not just in creating a self-sustaining educational system, but also a range of new economic and social enterprises to support remote communities.&lt;ref name=Ashoka /&gt;&lt;ref name=Himanchal /&gt;&lt;ref name=ghurkas&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gurkhas.com/showarticle.aspx?id=486 |title=Welcome to Dr Mahabir Pun in UK on Thursday 6 Nov 2008 |accessdate=2010-11-01 |date=2008-11-06 |publisher=Ghurkas.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Innovation Center ( राष्ट्रिय आविष्कार केन्द्र् )==
Mahabir Pun led the initiative to register a Nonprofit named "Rashtriya Abiskar Kendra" in 2012, widely termed as National Innovation Center in English. Primary objective to establish the Innovation center according to Mahabir is to foster research and developments for the economic development of the country.Mahabir worked with the government for funding of the project which did not happen and since July 2016,&lt;ref name=NIC1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nepalitimes.com/article/nation/innovating-a-new-nepal,179 |title= National Innovation Center, Innovating New Nepal |accessdate=2016-09-06 |date=2016-08-10 |publisher=My Republica }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mahabir is running a crowd funding campaign to fund National Innovation efforts. National Innovation Center crowd funding campaign plans to collect build a 10MW hydropower station, which according to the initiative would sustainably fund it's running cost.&lt;ref name=NIC2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nicnepal.org/concept-paper/ |title= NIC Nepal Concept Paper |accessdate=2016-09-06 |date=2016-08-31 |publisher=National Innovation Center }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NIC3&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.myrepublica.com/news/3546 |title= National Innovation Center to collect money from crowd-funding|accessdate=2016-09-06 |date=2016-08-31 |publisher=National Innovation Center }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mahabir has got social attraction with his donation of land for the National Innovation Center.&lt;ref name=Online1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.onlinekhabar.com/2016/07/31/382846 |title= Dr Mahabir Pun Donates 28 Ropanies of Land to National Innovation Center |accessdate=2016-09-06 |date=2016-07-31 |publisher=Online Khabar }}&lt;/ref&gt; The former prime minister of Nepal, [[Pushpa Kamal Dahal|Prachanda]] announced to hand NRS 15 millions to National Innovation Center.

==International recognition==
In 2002, Pun was elected Ashoka Fellow by the Ashoka Foundation, the global association of leading social entrepreneurs. The Foundation noted Pun's contribution to overcoming the geographical isolation of many of the communities in which he works, with a new idea which could be replicated in other geographically isolated areas with few educational or economic opportunities.&lt;ref name=Ashoka /&gt;

Mahabir Pun was inducted in Internet Hall of Fame  as an inductee in 2014 - &lt;ref name="Internet Hall of Fame"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://internethalloffame.org/inductees/mahabir-pun |title=Internet Hall of Fame Inductee |accessdate=2016-01-16 |date=2016-01-16 |publisher=[[Internet Hall of Fame by Internet Society]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Pun received the Overall Social Innovations Award from the [[Global Ideas Bank]], aka the [[Institute for Social Inventions]]. They said, "Using an inspired mix of solar power, tree-based relay systems, and wireless technology, the project is helping yak farmers stay in touch, families communicate and, with an expansion into distance learning, children to gain the education." &lt;ref name=globalideasbank&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalideasbank.org/site/news/index.php?articleId=116 |title=Social Innovations Award-Winners 2004 |accessdate=2010-11-01 |date=2004-09-20 |publisher=[[Global Ideas Bank]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Pun was awarded the [[Magsaysay Award]], considered by some to be the [[Nobel Prize]] of [[Asia]], in recognition of "his innovative application of wireless computer technology in Nepal, bringing progress to remote mountain areas by connecting his village to the global village".&lt;ref name=Magsaysay&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rmaf.org.ph/Awardees/Citation/CitationPunMah.htm |title=The 2007 Ramon Magsaysay Award for Community Leadership |accessdate=2010-11-01 |date=2007-08-31 |publisher=Ramon Magsaysay Award Foundation }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pun is one of four Nepalis to receive the Magsaysay Award, and the only one to receive the Magsaysay Award for Community Leadership.&lt;ref name=magsaysaylist&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rmaf.org.ph/Awardees/year.htm|title=The Raymond Magsaysay Awardees by Year|accessdate=2011-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 2007, the University of Nebraska awarded Pun an [[honorary degree]]  as [[Doctor of Humane Letters]] for his outstanding work for his country, Nepal.&lt;ref name=Nebraska&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unk.edu/news/index.php?id=35392 |title=Mahabir Pun's Commencement Address: Dec 2007 |accessdate=2010-11-01 |date=2007-12-21 |publisher=[[University of Nebraska]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ancient Roman religion]] and [[Roman mythology|myth]], '''Mars''' ({{lang-la|Mārs}}, {{IPA-la|maːrs|}}) was the [[god of war]] and also an [[Roman agriculture|agricultural]] guardian, a combination characteristic of early [[ancient Rome|Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]], J.A. North, and S.R.F. Price, ''Religions of Rome: A History'' (Cambridge University Press, 1998), pp. 47–48.&lt;/ref&gt; He was second in importance only to [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and he was the most prominent of the military gods in the [[Religion in the Roman military|religion of the Roman army]]. Most of his [[Roman festivals|festivals]] were held in March, the month named for him ([[Martius (month)|Latin ''Martius'']]), and in October, which began the season for military campaigning and ended the season for farming.

Under the [[Hellenization|influence of Greek culture]], Mars was [[interpretatio graeca|identified with]] the [[Greek mythology|Greek god]] [[Ares]],&lt;ref name=Lar&gt;''Larousse Desk Reference Encyclopedia'', [[The Book People]], Haydock, 1995, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; whose [[myth]]s were reinterpreted in [[Latin literature|Roman literature]] and [[Roman art|art]] under the name of Mars. But the character and dignity of Mars differed in fundamental ways from that of his Greek counterpart, who is often treated with contempt and revulsion in [[Ancient Greek literature|Greek literature]].&lt;ref&gt;Kurt A. Raaflaub, ''War and Peace in the Ancient World'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Mars was a part of the [[Capitoline Triad|Archaic Triad]] along with Jupiter and [[Quirinus]], the latter of whom, as a guardian of the Roman people, had no Greek equivalent. Mars' altar in the [[Campus Martius]], the area of Rome that took its name from him, was supposed to have been dedicated by [[Numa Pompilius|Numa]], the peace-loving semi-legendary second [[Kings of Rome|king of Rome]]. Although the center of Mars' worship was originally located outside the sacred boundary of Rome ''([[pomerium]])'', [[Augustus]] made the god a renewed focus of [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]] by establishing the Temple of Mars Ultor in [[Forum of Augustus|his new forum]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Rehak and John G. Younger, ''Imperium and Cosmos: Augustus and the Northern Campus Martius'' (University of Wisconsin Press, 2006), pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Ares was viewed primarily as a destructive and destabilizing force, Mars represented military power as a way [[Pax Romana|to secure peace]], and was a father ''(pater)'' of the Roman people.&lt;ref&gt;[[Isidore of Seville]] calls Mars ''Romanae gentis auctorem'', the originator or founder of the Roman people as a ''[[gens]]'' (''Etymologiae'' 5.33.5).&lt;/ref&gt; In the mythic [[genealogy]] and [[Founding of Rome|founding myths of Rome]], Mars was the father of [[Romulus and Remus]] with [[Rhea Silvia]]. His love affair with [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] symbolically reconciled the two different traditions of Rome's founding; Venus was the divine mother of the hero [[Aeneas]], celebrated as the [[Trojan War|Trojan refugee]] who "founded" Rome several generations before Romulus laid out the city walls.

The importance of Mars in establishing religious and cultural identity within the [[Roman Empire]] is indicated by the vast number of [[epigraphy|inscriptions]] identifying him with a local deity, particularly in the [[Roman province|Western provinces]].

Mars may ultimately be a reflex of the [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Proto-Indo-European]] god [[Perkwunos]], having originally a thunderer character.&lt;ref&gt;York, Michael. Romulus and Remus, Mars and Quirinus. Journal of Indo-European Studies 16:1 &amp; 2 (Spring/Summer, 1988), 153–172.&lt;/ref&gt; At least etymological [[Etruscan]] predecessors are present in [[Maris (mythology)|Maris]],&lt;ref&gt;Pallotino, pp. 29, 30; Hendrik Wagenvoort, "The Origin of the Ludi Saeculares," in Studies in Roman Literature, Culture and Religion (Brill, 1956), p. 219 et passim; John F. Hall III, "The Saeculum Novum of Augustus and its Etruscan Antecedents," Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt II.16.3 (1986), p. 2574.&lt;/ref&gt; though this is not universally agreed upon.&lt;ref&gt; Larissa Bonfante, Etruscan Life and Afterlife: A Handbook of Etruscan Studies (Wayne State University Press, 1986), p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birth==
{{Ancient Roman religion}}
Like Ares who was the son of [[Zeus]] and [[Hera]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''Theogony'' p. 79 in the translation of Norman O. Brown (Bobbs-Merrill, 1953); 921 in the [[Loeb Classical Library]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=lnCXI9oFeroC&amp;dq=Ares+intitle%3Atheogony+inauthor%3Ahesiod&amp;q=%22she%2C+mingling+in+love%22+Ares#v=snippet&amp;q=%22she%2C%20mingling%20in%20love%22%20Ares&amp;f=false numbering];  ''[[Iliad]]'', 5.890–896.&lt;/ref&gt; Mars is usually considered to be the son of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]]. However, in a version of his birth given by [[Ovid]], he was the son of Juno alone. Jupiter had usurped the mother's function when he gave birth to [[Minerva]] directly from his forehead (or mind); to restore the balance, Juno sought the advice of the goddess [[Flora (mythology)|Flora]] on how to do the same. Flora obtained a magic flower (Latin ''flos'', plural ''flores'', a [[grammatical gender|masculine word]]) and tested it on a [[wikt:heifer|heifer]] who became fecund at once. She then plucked a flower ritually using her thumb, touched Juno's belly, and impregnated her. Juno withdrew to [[Thrace]] and the [[Sea of Marmara|shore of Marmara]] for the birth.&lt;ref name=Mars-birth&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'' [https://archive.org/stream/ovidsfasti00oviduoft#page/276/mode/2up 5.229–260]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ovid]] tells this story in the ''[[Fasti (Ovid)|Fasti]]'', his long-form poetic work on the [[Roman calendar]].&lt;ref name=Mars-birth/&gt; It may explain why the [[Matronalia]], a festival celebrated by married women in honor of Juno as a [[Lucina (goddess)|goddess of childbirth]], occurred on the first day of Mars' month, which is also marked on a [[Chronography of 354|calendar from late antiquity]] as the birthday of Mars. In the earliest Roman calendar, March was the first month, and the god would have been born with the new year.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Warde Fowler]], ''The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic'' (London, 1908), p. 35f., discusses this interpretation in order to question it.&lt;/ref&gt; Ovid is the only source for the story. He may be presenting a literary myth of his own invention, or an otherwise unknown [[Ancient peoples of Italy|archaic Italic]] tradition; either way, in choosing to include the story, he emphasizes that Mars was connected to plant life and was not alienated from female nurture.&lt;ref&gt;Carole E. Newlands, ''Playing with Time: Ovid and the Fasti'' (Cornell University Press, 1995), pp. 105–106.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consort==
The [[wikt:consort|consort]] of Mars was [[Nerio]] or Neriene, "Valor." She represents the vital force ''(vis)'', power ''(potentia)'' and majesty ''(maiestas)'' of Mars.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aulus Gellius]], ''Attic Nights'' 13.23. Gellius says the word ''Nerio'' or ''Nerienes'' is [[Sabine language|Sabine]] and is supposed to be the origin of the [[cognomen|name]] ''Nero'' as used by the [[Claudia (gens)|Claudian family]], who were [[Sabines|Sabine]] in origin. The Sabines themselves, Gellius says, thought the word was [[ancient Greek language|Greek]] in origin, from νεῦρα ''(neura)'', Latin ''nervi'', meaning the sinews and ligaments of the limbs.&lt;/ref&gt; Her name was regarded as [[Sabine language|Sabine]] in origin and is equivalent to Latin ''[[virtus (virtue)|virtus]],'' "manly virtue" (from ''vir'', "man").&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert E.A. Palmer]], ''The Archaic Community of the Romans'' (Cambridge University Press, 1970, 2009), p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 3rd century BC, the comic playwright [[Plautus]] has a reference to Mars greeting Nerio, his wife.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plautus]], ''Truculentus'' 515.&lt;/ref&gt; A source from [[late antiquity]] says that Mars and Neriene were celebrated together at a festival held on March 23.&lt;ref&gt;[[Johannes Lydus]], ''De mensibus'' 4.60 (42).&lt;/ref&gt; In the later [[Roman Empire]], Neriene came to be identified with Minerva.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pomponius Porphyrion|Porphyrion]], ''Commentum in Horatium Flaccum'', on ''Epistula'' II.2.209.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nerio probably originates as a divine [[personification]] of Mars' power, as such [[abstraction]]s in Latin are generally [[grammatical gender|feminine]]. Her name appears with that of Mars in an archaic prayer [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#invocatio|invoking]] a series of abstract qualities, each paired with the name of a deity. The influence of [[Greek mythology]] and its [[Anthropotheism|anthropomorphic gods]] may have caused Roman writers to treat these pairs as "marriages."&lt;ref&gt;[[William Warde Fowler]], ''The Religious Experience of the Roman People'' (London, 1922), p. 150–154; Roger D. Woodard, ''Indo-European Sacred Space: Vedic and Roman Cult'' (University of Illinois Press, 2006), pp. 113–114; Gary Forsythe, ''A Critical History of Early Rome: From Prehistory to the First Punic War'' (University of California Press, 2005), p. 145. The prayer is recorded in the passage on Nerio in Aulus Gellius.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--[[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] disapprovingly gives Mars and the war goddess [[Bellona (goddess)|Bellona]] as an example of a divine couple who were also sister and brother.&lt;ref&gt;[[Augustine]], ''De civitate Dei'' 6.10, citing Seneca; Fowler doubts the authority of the passage (''Religious Experience'', p. 166, note 16).&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

===Venus and Mars===
[[File:Mars and Venus MAN Napoli Inv9248.jpg|thumb|left|Wall painting (mid-1st century AD) from which the House of Venus and Mars at [[Pompeii]] takes its name]]
The union of Venus and Mars held greater appeal for poets and philosophers, and the couple were a frequent subject of art. In Greek myth, the adultery of [[Ares]] and [[Aphrodite]] had been exposed to ridicule when her husband [[Hephaestus]] (whose Roman equivalent was [[Vulcanus|Vulcan]]) caught them in the act by means of a magical snare. Although not originally part of the Roman tradition, in 217 BC Venus and Mars were presented as a complementary pair in the ''[[lectisternium]]'', a public banquet at which images of [[Di Consentes|twelve major gods]] of the Roman state were presented on couches as if present and participating.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Schilling, "Venus," in ''Roman and European Mythologies'' (University of Chicago Press, 1992, from the French edition of 1981), p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scenes of Venus and Mars in [[Roman art]] often ignore the adulterous implications of their union, and take pleasure in the good-looking couple attended by [[Cupid]] or multiple Loves ''(amores)''. Some scenes may imply marriage,&lt;ref&gt;John R. Clarke, ''The Houses of Roman Italy, 100 B.C.–A.D. 250: Ritual, Space, and Decoration'' (University of California Press, 1991), pp. 156–157&lt;/ref&gt; and the relationship was romanticized in funerary or domestic art in which husbands and wives had themselves portrayed as the passionate divine couple.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Salah Nasrallah, ''Christian Responses to Roman Art and Architecture: The Second-Century Church amid the Spaces of Empire'' (Cambridge University Press, 2010), pp. 284–287.&lt;/ref&gt;

The uniting of deities representing Love and War lent itself to [[allegory]], especially since the lovers were the parents of [[Concordia (mythology)|Concordia]].{{fact|date=September 2017}} The Renaissance philosopher [[Marsilio Ficino]] notes that "only Venus dominates Mars, and he never dominates her".&lt;ref&gt;Ficino, ''On Love'', speech 5, chapter 8, as summarized in the entry on "Mars," ''The Classical Tradition'' (Harvard University Press, 2010), p. 564.&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient Roman and Renaissance art, Mars is often shown disarmed and relaxed, or even sleeping, but the extramarital nature of their affair can also suggest that this peace is impermanent.&lt;ref&gt;Entry on "Mars" in ''The Classical Tradition,'' p. 564.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Essential nature==
[[File:Campanian bowl with Mars and Venus.JPG|thumb|A relief depicting Mars and [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] on a [[black-slip]] bowl from [[Campania]], Italy, 250–150 BC, [[British Museum]]]]
[[Virility]] as a kind of life force ''(vis)'' or virtue ''(virtus)'' is an essential characteristic of Mars.&lt;ref&gt;R.B. Onians, ''The Origins of European Thought about the Body, the Mind, the Soul, the World, Time and Fate'' (Cambridge University Press, 1951), pp. 470–471. Onians connects the name of Mars to the Latin ''mas, maris'', "male" (p. 178), as had Isidore of Seville, saying that the month of March ''(Martius)'' was named after Mars "because at that time all living things are stirred toward virility (''mas'', gen. ''maris'') and to the pleasures of sexual intercourse" ''(eo tempore cuncta animantia agantur ad marem et ad concumbendi voluptatem)'': ''Etymologies'' 5.33.5, translation by Stephen A. Barney, ''The Etymologies of Isidore of Seville'' (Cambridge University Press, 2006), p. 128. In antiquity, ''vis'' was thought to be related etymologically to ''vita'', "life." Varro (''De lingua latina'' 5.64, quoting [[Gaius Lucilius|Lucilius]]) notes that ''vis'' is ''vita'': "''vis'' drives us to do everything."&lt;/ref&gt; As an agricultural guardian, he directs his energies toward creating conditions that allow crops to grow, which may include warding off hostile forces of nature.&lt;ref&gt;On the relation of Mars' warrior aspect to his agricultural functions with respect to Dumézil's [[Trifunctional hypothesis]], see Wouter W. Belier, ''Decayed Gods: Origin and Development of Georges Dumézil's 'idéologie tripartie' '' (Brill, 1991), pp. 88–91 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Hs3BpWur0_4C&amp;pg=PA88&amp;dq=%22Besides+the+obviously+warlike+aspects+of+Mars+there+are+also+features+which+have+an+agricultural+aspect%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=uU3wTNcEyeydB42G2OAK&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Besides%20the%20obviously%20warlike%20aspects%20of%20Mars%20there%20are%20also%20features%20which%20have%20an%20agricultural%20aspect%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; As an embodiment of masculine aggression, he is the force that drives wars&amp;nbsp;– but ideally, war that delivers a secure peace.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

The priesthood of the [[Arval Brethren|Arval Brothers]] called on Mars to drive off  "rust" ''(lues)'', with its double meaning of [[Wheat leaf rust|wheat fungus]] and the [[rust|red oxides]] that affect metal, a threat to both iron farm implements and weaponry. In the [[Carmen Arvale|surviving text of their hymn]], the Arval Brothers invoked Mars as ''ferus'', "savage" or "feral" like a wild animal.&lt;ref&gt;Schilling, "Mars," in ''Roman and European Mythologies'', p. 135; Palmer, ''Archaic Community'', pp. 113–114.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mars' potential for savagery is expressed in his obscure connections to the wild woodlands, and he may even have originated as a god of the wild, beyond the boundaries set by humans, and thus a force to be [[wikt:propitiate|propitiated]].&lt;ref&gt;Gary Forsythe, ''A Critical History of Early Rome'' (University of California Press, 2005), p. 127; Fowler, ''Religious Experience'', p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; In his [[De Agri Cultura|book on farming]], [[Cato the Elder|Cato]] invokes ''[[Mars (mythology)#Mars Silvanus|Mars Silvanus]]'' for a ritual to be carried out ''in silva'', in the woods, an uncultivated place that if not held within bounds can threaten to overtake the fields needed for crops.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cato the Elder|Cato]], ''On Agriculture'' 141. In pre-modern agricultural societies, encroaching woodland or wild growth was a real threat to the food supply, since clearing land for cultivation required intense manual labor with minimal tools and little or no large-scale machinery. Fowler says of Mars, "As he was not localised either on the farm or in the city, I prefer to think that he was originally conceived as a Power outside the boundary in each case, but for that very reason all the more to be propitiated by the settlers within it" (''Religious Experience'', p. 142).&lt;/ref&gt; Mars' character as an agricultural god may derive solely from his role as a defender and protector,&lt;ref&gt;Schilling, "Mars," p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; or may be inseparable from his warrior nature,&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al.'', ''Religions of Rome: A History'', pp. 47–48.&lt;/ref&gt; as the leaping of his armed priests the [[Salii]] was meant to quicken the growth of crops.&lt;ref&gt;Forsythe, ''A Critical History of Early Rome'', p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

It appears that Mars was originally a thunderer or storm deity, which explains some of his mixed traits in regards to fertility.&lt;ref&gt;York, Michael. Romulus and Remus, Mars and Quirinus. Journal of Indo-European Studies 16:1 &amp; 2 (Spring/Summer, 1988), 153–172.&lt;/ref&gt; This role was later taken in the Roman pantheon by several other gods, such as [[Summanus]] or [[Jupiter]].

==Sacred animals==
[[File:Altar Mars Venus Massimo lupa.jpg|thumb|[[She-wolf (Roman mythology)|She-wolf]] and twins [[Romulus and Remus]] from an altar to Venus and Mars]]
The wild animals most sacred to Mars were the woodpecker, the wolf, and the bear, which in the natural lore of the Romans were said always to inhabit the same foothills and woodlands.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Roman Questions'' 21, citing [[Nigidius Figulus]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plutarch]] notes that the woodpecker ''(picus)'' is sacred to Mars because "it is a courageous and spirited bird and has a [[beak]] so strong that it can overturn oaks by pecking them until it has reached the inmost part of the tree."&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Roman Questions'' 21; also named as sacred to Mars in his ''Life of Romulus''. Ovid (''Fasti'' 3.37) calls the woodpecker the bird of Mars.&lt;/ref&gt; As the beak of the ''picus Martius'' contained the god's power to ward off harm, it was carried as a [[amulet|magic charm]] to prevent [[bee sting]]s and [[leech]] bites.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], ''Natural History'' 29.29.&lt;/ref&gt; The bird of Mars also guarded a woodland herb ''([[paeonia (plant)|paeonia]])'' used for treatment of the [[Human gastrointestinal tract|digestive]] or [[Female reproductive system (human)|female reproductive systems]]; those who sought to harvest it were advised to do so by night, lest the woodpecker jab out their eyes.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Natural History'' 27.60. Pliny names the herb as ''glycysīdē'' in Greek, Latin ''[[paeonia (plant)|paeonia]]'' (see [[Peony#Name|Peony: Name]]), also called ''pentorobos''.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''picus Martius'' seems to have been a particular species, but authorities differ on which one: perhaps ''[[Picus viridis]]''&lt;ref&gt;A.H. Krappe, "Picus Who Is Also Zeus," ''Mnemosyne'' 9.4 (1941), p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt; or ''[[Dryocopus martius]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Geoffrey Arnott]], ''Birds in the ancient world from A to Z'' (Routledge, 2007), p. 63 [https://books.google.com/books?id=0NB4qqenLQIC&amp;pg=PA63&amp;dq=picus+Martius+Mars+%22green+woodpecker%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ifEITcboAYiWnAfq-KzaDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=picus%20Martius%20Mars%20%22green%20woodpecker%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The woodpecker was revered by the [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latin peoples]], who abstained from eating its flesh.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Roman Questions'' 21. [[Athenaeus]] lists the woodpecker among delicacies on Greek tables (''Deipnosophistae'' 9.369).&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of the most important birds in Roman and Italic [[augur]]y, the practice of reading the will of the gods through watching the sky for signs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plautus]], ''Asinaria'' 259–261; [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], ''Natural History'' 10.18. Named also in the [[Iguvine Tables]] (6a, 1–7), as [[Umbrian language|Umbrian]] ''peiqu''; Schilling, "Roman Divination," in ''Roman and European Mythologies'' (University of Chicago Press, 1992), pp. 96–97 and 105, note 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The mythological figure named [[Picus]] had powers of augury that he retained when he was transformed into a woodpecker; in one tradition, Picus was the son of Mars.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] 1.31; Peter F. Dorcey, ''The Cult of Silvanus: A Study in Roman Folk Religion'' (Brill, 1992), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Umbrian language|Umbrian]] [[cognate]] ''peiqu'' also means "woodpecker," and the Italic [[Picentes|Picenes]] were supposed to have derived their name from the ''picus'' who served as their guide animal during a ritual migration ''([[ver sacrum]])'' undertaken as a rite of Mars.&lt;ref&gt;John Greppin, entry on "woodpecker," ''Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture'' (Fitzroy Dearborn, 1997), p. 648.&lt;/ref&gt; In the territory of the [[Aequi]], another Italic people, Mars had an [[oracle]] of great antiquity where the prophecies were supposed to be spoken by a woodpecker perched on a wooden column.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dionysius Halicarnassus]], ''Roman Antiquities'' I.14.5, as noted by Mary Emma Armstrong, ''The Significance of Certain Colors in Roman Ritual'' (George Banta Publishing, 1917), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mars' association with the wolf is familiar from what may be the most famous of [[Roman mythology|Roman myths]], the story of how a [[She-wolf (Roman mythology)|she-wolf]] ''(lupa)'' suckled his infant sons when they were [[Infanticide#Greece and Rome|exposed]] by order of [[Amulius|King Amulius]], who feared them because he had [[usurper|usurped]] the throne from their grandfather, [[Numitor]].&lt;ref&gt;The myth of the she-wolf, and the birth of the twins with Mars as their father, is a long and complex tradition that weaves together multiple stories about the founding of Rome. See [[T.P. Wiseman]], ''Remus: A Roman Myth'' (Cambridge University Press, 1995), p. xiii, 73ff. ''et passim.''&lt;/ref&gt; The woodpecker also brought nourishment to the twins.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Romulus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Romulus*.html 4.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The wolf appears elsewhere in Roman art and literature in masculine form as the animal of Mars. A statue group that stood along the [[Appian Way]] showed Mars in the company of wolves.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]] 22.1.12, as cited by Wiseman, ''Remus'', p. 189, note 6, and Armstrong, ''The Significance of Certain Colors'', p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Battle of Sentinum]] in 295 BC, the appearance of the wolf of Mars ''(Martius lupus)'' was a sign that Roman victory was to come.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab Urbe Condita]]'' 10.27.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Gallo-Roman culture|Roman Gaul]], the goose was associated with the [[Mars (mythology)#Provincial epithets|Celtic forms of Mars]], and archaeologists have found geese buried alongside warriors in graves. The goose was considered a bellicose animal because it is easily provoked to aggression.&lt;ref&gt;Miranda Green, ''Animals in Celtic Life and Myth'' (Routledge, 1992), p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sacrificial animals===
[[File:Suovetaurilia.jpg|thumb|left|The procession of the ''[[suovetaurilia]]'', a sacrifice of a pig, ram, and bull, led by a priest with his head [[capite velato|ritually covered]]]]
[[Religion in ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] and Roman religion distinguished between animals that were sacred to a deity and those that were prescribed as the correct [[animal sacrifice|sacrificial offerings]] for the god. Wild animals might be viewed as already belonging to the god to whom they were sacred, or at least not owned by human beings and therefore not [[Do ut des|theirs to give]]. Since sacrificial meat was eaten at a banquet after the gods received their portion&amp;nbsp;– mainly the entrails ''([[exta]])'' – it follows that the animals sacrificed were most often, though not always, domestic animals normally part of the Roman diet.&lt;ref&gt;Nicole Belayche, "Religious Actors in Daily Life: Practices and Related Beliefs," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 283; C. Bennett Pascal, "October Horse," ''Harvard Studies in Classical Philology'' 85 (1981), pp. 268, 277.&lt;/ref&gt; Gods often received castrated male animals as sacrifices, and the goddesses female [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#victima|victims]]; Mars, however, regularly received intact males.&lt;ref&gt;As did Neptune, Janus and the [[Genius (mythology)|Genius]]; [[John Scheid]], "Sacrifices for Gods and Ancestors," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt; Mars did receive [[oxen]] under a few of his cult titles, such as [[Mars (mythology)#Mars Grabovius|Mars Grabovius]], but the usual offering was the bull, singly, in multiples, or in combination with other animals.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

The two most distinctive animal sacrifices made to Mars were the ''[[suovetaurilia]]'', a triple offering of a pig ''(sus)'', ram ''(ovis)'' and bull ''(taurus)'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]], J.A. North, and S.R.F. Price, ''Religions of Rome: A Sourcebook'' (Cambridge University Press, 1998), p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[October Horse]], the only [[horse sacrifice]] known to have been carried out in ancient Rome and a rare instance of a victim the Romans considered inedible.&lt;ref&gt;C. Bennett Pascal, "October Horse," ''Harvard Studies in Classical Philology'' 85 (1981), pp. 263, 268, 277.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temples and topography in Rome==
The earliest center in Rome for cultivating Mars as a deity was the Altar of Mars ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#ara|Ara]] Martis)'' in the [[Campus Martius]] ("Field of Mars") outside the sacred boundary of Rome ''([[pomerium]])''. The Romans thought that this altar had been established by the semi-legendary [[Numa Pompilius]], the peace-loving successor of Romulus.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Richardson, ''A New Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992), p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Roman tradition, the Campus Martius had been consecrated to Mars by their ancestors to serve as horse pasturage and an equestrian training ground for youths.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], ''Roman Antiquities'' 5.13.2&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Roman Republic]] (509–27 BC), the Campus was a largely open expanse. No temple was built at the altar, but from 193 BC a covered walkway connected it to the [[Porta Fontinalis]], near the office and archives of the [[Roman censor]]s. Newly elected censors placed their [[curule chair]]s by the altar, and when they had finished conducting the census, the citizens were collectively [[lustrum|purified]] with a suovetaurilia there.&lt;ref&gt;Livy 40.45.8, 1.44.1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[frieze]] from the so-called [[Altar of Domitius Ahenobarbus|"Altar" of Domitius Ahenobarbus]] is thought to depict the census, and may show Mars himself standing by the altar as the procession of victims advances.&lt;ref&gt;Katja Moede, "Reliefs, Public and Private," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Forum Augustus.JPG|thumb|Remains of the [[Temple of Mars Ultor]] in the Forum of Augustus, Rome]]
The main Temple of Mars ''([[Aedes (Roman)|Aedes]] Martis)'' in the Republican period also lay outside the sacred boundary{{where|date=October 2018}} and was devoted to the god's warrior aspect.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vitruvius]] 1.7.1; [[Servius]], note to ''[[Aeneid]]'' 1.292; Richardson, ''New Topographical Dictionary,'' p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; It was built to fulfill a vow ''([[votum]])'' made by a [[Quinctia (gens)|Titus Quinctius]] in 388 BC during the [[Gallic siege of Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]] 6.5.7; Richardson, ''New Topographical Dictionary,'' p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; The founding day ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#dies natalis|dies natalis]])'' was commemorated on June 1,&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Fasti'' 6.191–192 and the ''[[Fasti Antiates]]'' (Degrassi 463), as cited by Richardson, ''New Topographical Dictionary,'' p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; and the temple is attested by several inscriptions and literary sources.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' 6.473, 474 = 30774, 485; ''[[Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae|ILS]]'' 3139, 3144, as cited by Richardson, ''New Topographical Dictionary,'' p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpture group of Mars and the wolves was displayed there.&lt;ref&gt;[[H.H. Scullard]], ''Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic'' (Cornell University Press, 1981), p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; Soldiers sometimes assembled at the temple before heading off to war, and it was the point of departure for a major parade of [[Roman cavalry]] held annually on July 15.&lt;ref&gt;Scullard, ''Festivals and Ceremonies,'' pp. 127, 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

A temple to Mars in the [[Circus Flaminius]] was built around 133 BC, funded by [[Decimus Junius Brutus Callaicus]] from war booty. It housed a colossal statue of Mars and a nude Venus.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Natural History'' 36.26; Richardson, ''New Topographical Dictionary,'' p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Campus Martius continued to provide venues for equestrian events such as [[chariot racing]] during the [[Roman Empire|Imperial period]], but under the first emperor [[Augustus]] it underwent a major program of urban renewal, marked by monumental architecture. The Altar of Augustan Peace ''([[Ara Pacis Augustae]])'' was located there, as was the [[Obelisk of Montecitorio]], imported from [[Roman Egypt|Egypt]] to form the pointer ''([[gnomon]])'' of the [[Solarium Augusti]], a giant [[sundial]]. With its public gardens, the Campus became one of the most attractive places in the city to visit.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Rehak, ''Imperium and Cosmos: Augustus and the Northern Campus Martius'' (University of Wisconsin Press, 2006), pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustus chose the Campus Martius as the site of his new Temple to Mars Ultor{{clarify|date=October 2018|reason=Caption to right and pages elsewhere give location as Forum of Augustus not Campus Martius}}, a manifestation of Mars he cultivated as the avenger ''(ultor)'' of the [[assassination of Julius Caesar|murder of Julius Caesar]] and of the military disaster suffered at the [[Battle of Carrhae]]. When the legionary standards lost to the Parthians were recovered, they were housed in the new temple. The date of the temple's dedication on May 12 was aligned with the [[heliacal setting]] of the constellation [[Scorpio (constellation)|Scorpio]], the [[Astrological sign|sign]] of war.&lt;ref&gt;Rehak, ''Imperium and Cosmos,'' p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; The date continued to be marked with [[ludi circenses|circus games]] as late as the mid-4th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Michele Renee Salzman, ''On Roman Time: The Codex Calendar of 354 and the Rhythms of Urban Life in Late Antiquity'' (University of California Press, 1990), p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

A large statue of Mars was part of the short-lived [[List of Roman triumphal arches|Arch of Nero]], which was built in 62 AD but dismantled after [[Nero]]'s suicide and disgrace ''([[damnatio memoriae]])''.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, ''New Topographical Dictionary,'' p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Roman art]], Mars is depicted as either bearded and mature, or young and clean-shaven. Even [[Nude (art)|nude]] or seminude, he often wears a helmet or carries a spear as emblems of his warrior nature. Mars was among the deities to appear on the earliest Roman coinage in the late 4th and early 3rd century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Williams, "Religion and Roman Coins," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'', p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the Altar of Peace ''(Ara Pacis)'', built in the last years of the 1st century BC, Mars is a mature man with a "handsome, [[Classicism|classicizing]]" face, and a short curly beard and moustache. His helmet is a plumed [[neo-Attic]]-[[Attic helmet|type]]. He wears a military cloak ''([[paludamentum]])'' and a [[muscle cuirass|cuirass]] ornamented with a [[gorgoneion]]. Although the [[relief]] is somewhat damaged at this spot, he appears to hold a spear [[laurel wreath|garlanded in laurel]], symbolizing a peace that is won by military victory. The 1st-century statue of Mars found in the [[Forum of Nerva]] (pictured at top) is similar. In this guise, Mars is presented as the dignified ancestor of the Roman people. The panel of the ''Ara Pacis'' on which he appears would have faced the Campus Martius, reminding viewers that Mars was the god whose altar Numa established there, that is, the god of Rome's oldest civic and military institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Rehak and John G. Younger, ''Imperium and Cosmos: Augustus and the Northern Campus Martius'' (University of Wisconsin Press, 2006), p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

Particularly in works of art influenced by [[ancient Greek art|the Greek tradition]], Mars may be portrayed in a manner that resembles Ares, youthful, beardless, and often nude.&lt;ref&gt;Rehak and Younger, ''Imperium and Cosmos'', p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Renaissance, Mars' nudity was thought to represent his lack of fear in facing danger.&lt;ref&gt;Entry on "Mars", in ''The Classical Tradition'', p. 564, citing Sebastiano Erizzo, ''On Ancient Medallions'' (1559), p. 120.&lt;!--although I can't find it in that source--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===The spear of Mars===
The spear is the instrument of Mars in the same way that Jupiter wields the lightning bolt, [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] the trident, and [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]] the scythe or sickle.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martianus Capella]] 5.425, with Mars specified as Gradivus and Neptune named as [[Portunus]].&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Relics in classical antiquity|relic]] or [[fetishism|fetish]] called the spear of Mars&lt;ref&gt;[[Varro]], ''Antiquitates'' frg. 254* (Cardauns); [[Plutarch]], ''Romulus'' 29.1 (a rather muddled account); [[Arnobius]], ''Adversus nationes'' 6.11.&lt;/ref&gt; was kept in a ''[[sacellum|sacrarium]]'' at the [[Regia]], the former residence of the [[Kings of Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Lipka, ''Roman Gods: A Conceptual Approach'' (Brill, 2009), p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; The spear was said to move, tremble or vibrate at impending war or other danger to the state, as was reported to occur before the [[assassination of Julius Caesar]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Aulus Gellius]], ''Attic Nights'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Gellius/4*.html#6.1 4.6.1]; [[Cassius Dio]] [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/44*.html#17.2 44.17.2] (because Caesar was [[pontifex maximus]]); Veit Rosenberger, "Republican ''Nobiles:'' Controlling the ''Res Publica''," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion,'' p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt; When Mars is pictured as a peace-bringer, his spear is wreathed with laurel or other vegetation, as on the Ara Pacis or a coin of [[Aemilianus]].&lt;ref&gt;''Imperium and Cosmos'' p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Priesthoods==
The high priest of Mars in Roman public religion was the [[Flamen Martialis]], who was one of the three major priests in the fifteen-member [[collegium|college]] of [[flamen]]s. Mars was also served by the [[Salii]], a twelve-member priesthood of patrician youths who dressed as archaic warriors and danced in procession around the city in March. Both priesthoods extend to the earliest periods of Roman history, and [[patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician birth]] was required.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Smith, "The Religion of Archaic Rome," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'', p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Festivals and rituals==
The festivals of Mars cluster in his namesake month of March (Latin: ''[[Martius (month)|Martius]]''), with a few observances in October, the beginning and end of the season for military campaigning and agriculture. Festivals with horse racing took place in the Campus Martius. Some festivals in March retained characteristics of new year festivals, since ''Martius'' was originally the first month of the [[Roman calendar]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

[[File:Cornelia50.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|[[Denarius]], issued 88 BC, depicting the helmeted head of Mars, with [[Victoria (mythology)|Victory]] driving a two-horse chariot ''([[biga (chariot)|biga]])'' on the reverse]]
* February 27: [[Equirria]], involving [[chariot racing|chariot]] or horse races;
* March 1: Mars' ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#dies natalis|dies natalis]]'' ("birthday"), a ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#feria|feria]]'' also sacred to [[#Birth|his mother Juno]];&lt;ref&gt;Marked as such only on the [[Chronography of 354]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* March 14: a second Equirria, again with chariot races;
* March 14 or 15: [[Mamuralia]], a new year festival when a figure called [[Mamurius Veturius]] (perhaps the "old Mars" of the old year) is driven out;
* March 17: an [[Agonalia#Agonium Martiale|Agonalia or ''Agonium Martiale'']], an obscure type of observance held at other times for various deities;
* March 23: [[Tubilustrium]], a purification of the deploying army March 23;
* October 15: the ritual of the [[October Horse]], with a chariot race and Rome's only known [[horse sacrifice]];
* October 19: [[Armilustrium]] ("purification of arms").

Mars was also honored by chariot races at the [[Robigalia]] and [[Consualia]], though these festivals are not primarily dedicated to him. From 217 BC onward, Mars was among the gods honored at the [[lectisternium]], a banquet given for deities who were present as images.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Roman hymns ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#carmen|carmina]])'' are rarely preserved, but Mars is invoked in two. The [[Arval Brothers]], or "Brothers of the Fields," chanted a hymn to Mars while performing their three-step dance.&lt;ref&gt;The hymn is preserved in an inscription ''([[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' 6.2104); Frances Hickson Hahn, "Performing the Sacred," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'', p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Carmen Saliare]]'' was sung by Mars' priests the Salii while they moved twelve sacred shields ''([[ancilia]])'' throughout the city in a procession.&lt;ref&gt;Hahn, "Performing the Sacred," p. 237, citing [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] 2.70.1–5.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1st century AD, [[Quintilian]] remarks that the language of the Salian hymn was so archaic that it was no longer fully understood.&lt;ref&gt;[[Quintilian]], ''Institutiones'' 1.6.40, as cited by Frances Hickson Hahn, in "Performing the Sacred," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'', p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mars also gave his name to the third month in the [[Roman calendar]], ''[[Martius (month)|Martius]]'', from which English "March" derives. In the most ancient Roman calendar, ''Martius'' was the first month. The [[planet Mars]] was named for him, and in some allegorical and philosophical writings, the planet and the god are endowed with shared characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;"Mars," ''The Classical Tradition'', p. 565.&lt;/ref&gt; In many languages, [[Tuesday]] is [[Week-day names#Planetary|named for the planet Mars or the god of war]]: In Latin, ''martis dies'' ("Mars's Day"), survived in [[Romance languages]] as ''martes'' ([[History of Spanish|Spanish]]), ''mardi'' ([[History of French|French]]), ''martedi'' ([[History of Italian|Italian]]), ''marţi'' ([[History of Romanian|Romanian]]), and ''dimarts'' ([[History of Catalan|Catalan]]). In Irish (Gaelic), the day is ''An Mháirt'', while in [[Albanian language|Albanian]] it is ''e Marta''. The English word ''Tuesday'' derives from [[Old English]] "Tiwesdæg" and means "Tiw's Day", ''Tiw'' being the Old English form of the Proto-Germanic war god *Tîwaz, or [[Týr]] in Norse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Tuesday Online Etymology Dictionary.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Roman religion===
In [[Religion in ancient Rome|Classical Roman religion]], Mars was invoked under several titles, and the first Roman emperor Augustus thoroughly integrated Mars into [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]]. The 4th-century Latin historian [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] treats Mars as one of several classical Roman deities who remained "cultic realities" up to his own time.&lt;ref&gt;R.L. Rike, ''Apex Omnium: Religion in the ''Res Gestae'' of Ammianus'' (University of California Press, 1987), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Mars, and specifically Mars Ultor, was among the gods who received sacrifices from [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]], the only emperor to reject Christianity after the conversion of [[Constantine I]]. In 363 AD, in preparation for the [[Battle of Ctesiphon (363)|Siege of Ctesiphon]], Julian sacrificed ten "very fine" bulls to Mars Ultor. The tenth bull violated ritual protocol by attempting to break free, and when killed and [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#litatio|examined]], produced [[Exta|ill omens]], among the many that were read at the end of Julian's reign. As represented by Ammianus, Julian swore never to make sacrifice to Mars again—a vow kept with his death a month later.&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus 24.6.17; Rike, ''Apex Omnium,'' p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mars Gradivus====
Gradivus was one of the gods by whom a general or soldiers might swear an oath to be valorous in battle.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]] 2.45.&lt;/ref&gt; His temple outside the [[Porta Capena]] was where armies gathered. The archaic priesthood of Mars Gradivus was the ''[[Salii]]'', the "leaping priests" who danced ritually in armor as a prelude to war.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 1.20, {{cite book|ref=harv|author1=Livy|authorlink1=Livy|last2=Warrior|first2=Valerie M|title=The History of Rome, Books 1–5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M-ikf_c0rB0C&amp;pg=PA31|year=1884|publisher=Hackett Publishing|isbn=1-60384-381-7}}, with note by Valerie M. Warrior, ''The History of Rome Books 1–5'' (Hackett, 2006), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; His cult title is most often taken to mean "the Strider" or "the Marching God," from ''gradus'', "step, march."&lt;ref&gt;Compare ''[[Gradiva]]''. The second-century grammarian [[Sextus Pompeius Festus]] offers two other explanations in addition. The name, he says, might also mean the vibration of a spear, for which the Greeks use the word ''kradainein''; others locate the origin of Gradivus in the grass ''(gramine)'', because the [[Grass Crown]] is the highest military honor; see Carole Newlands, ''Playing with Time: Ovid and the Fasti'' (Cornell University Press, 1995), p. 106. [[Maurus Servius Honoratus]] says that grass was sacred to Mars (note to ''[[Aeneid]]'' 12.119).&lt;/ref&gt;

The poet [[Statius]] addresses him as "the most implacable of the gods,"&lt;ref&gt;Statius, ''[[Thebaid (Latin poem)|Thebaid]]'' 9.4. See also 7.695.&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Valerius Maximus]] concludes his [[Roman historiography|history]] by invoking Mars Gradivus as "author and support of the name 'Roman'":&lt;ref&gt;[[Valerius Maximus]] 2.131.1, ''auctor ac stator Romani nominis''.&lt;/ref&gt; Gradivus is asked – along with Capitoline Jupiter and [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]], as the keeper of Rome's perpetual flame – to "guard, preserve, and protect" the [[state of Rome]], the peace, and the ''[[princeps]]'' (the emperor [[Tiberius]] at the time).&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Friedrich Mueller, ''Roman Religion in Valerius Maximus'' (Routledge, 2002), p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

A source from [[Late Antiquity]] says that the wife of Gradivus was [[Mars (mythology)#Consort|Nereia]], the daughter of [[Nereus]], and that he loved her passionately.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martianus Capella]], ''The Marriage of Philology and Mercury'' 1.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mars Quirinus====
[[Image:Antoninianus Aemilianus-RIC 0015.jpg|thumb|Mars celebrated as peace-bringer on a Roman coin issued by [[Aemilianus]]]]
Mars Quirinus was the protector of the [[Quirites]] ("citizens" or "civilians") as divided into ''[[curia]]e'' (citizen assemblies), whose oaths were required to make a treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Palmer|first=R. E. A.|authorlink=R. E. A. Palmer|title=The Archaic Community of the Romans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-cgAQcJTqSMC|year=1970|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-07702-6}}, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; As a guarantor of treaties, Mars Quirinus is thus a god of peace: "When he rampages, Mars is called ''Gradivus'', but when he's at peace ''Quirinus''."&lt;ref&gt;''Mars enim cum saevit Gradivus dicitur, cum tranquillus est Quirinus'': [[Maurus Servius Honoratus]], note to ''[[Aeneid]]'' 1.292, at [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Serv.+A.+1.292&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0053 Perseus.] At ''Aeneid'' 6.860, Servius further notes: "Quirinus is the Mars who presides over peace and whose cult is maintained within the civilian realm, for the Mars of war has his [[Templum|temple]] outside that realm." See also Belier, ''Decayed Gods'', p. 92: "The identification of the two gods is a reflection of a social process. The men who till the soil as Quirites in times of peace are identical with the men who defend their country as Milites in times of war."&lt;/ref&gt;

The deified [[Romulus and Remus|Romulus]] was identified with Mars Quirinus. In the [[Capitoline Triad]] of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], Mars, and [[Quirinus]], however, Mars and Quirinus were two separate deities, though not perhaps in origin. Each of the three had his own [[flamen]] (specialized priest), but the functions of the [[Flamen Martialis]] and [[Flamen Quirinalis]] are hard to distinguish.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, ''The Archaic Community of the Romans'', pp. 165–171. On how Romulus became identified with Mars Quirinus, see the Dumézilian summary of Belier, ''Decayed Gods'', p. 93–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mars Grabovius====
Mars is invoked as ''Grabovius'' in the [[Iguvine Tablets]], bronze tablets written in [[Umbrian language|Umbrian]] that record ritual protocols for carrying out public ceremonies on behalf of the city and community of [[Gubbio|Iguvium]]. The same title is given to Jupiter and to the Umbrian deity Vofionus. This triad has been compared to the Archaic Triad, with Vofionus equivalent to Quirinus.&lt;ref&gt;Etymologically, Quirinus is ''*co-uiri-no'', "(the god) of the community of men ''(viri)''," and Vofionus is ''*leudhyo-no'', "(the god) of the people": Oliver de Cazanove, "Pre-Roman Italy, Before and Under the Romans," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 49. It has also been argued that Vofionus corresponds to [[Janus]], because an entry in [[Sextus Pompeius Festus]] (204, edition of Lindsay) indicates there was a Roman triad of Jupiter, Mars, and Janus, each having ''quirinus'' as a title; C. Scott Littleton, ''The New Comparative Mythology'' (University of California Press, 1966, 1973), p. 178, citing Vsevolod Basanoff, ''Les dieux Romains'' (1942).&lt;/ref&gt; Tables I and VI describe a complex ritual that took place at the three gates of the city. After the [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#auspicia|auspices]] were taken, two groups of three [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#victima|victims]] were sacrificed at each gate. Mars Grabovius received three oxen.&lt;ref&gt;O. de Cazanove, "Pre-Roman Italy," pp. 49–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mars Pater====

"Father Mars" or "Mars the Father" is the form in which the god is invoked in the agricultural prayer of Cato,&lt;ref&gt;The Indo-European character of this prayer is discussed by [[Calvert Watkins]], "Some Indo-European Prayers: Cato's Lustration of the Fields," in ''[[How to Kill a Dragon: Aspects of Indo-European Poetics]]'' (Oxford University Press, 1995), pp. 197–213.&lt;/ref&gt; and he appears with this title in several other literary texts and inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;Celia E. Schultz, "Juno Sospita and Roman Insecurity in the Social War," in ''Religion in Republican Italy'' (Cambridge University Press, 2006), p. 217, especially note 38.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mars Pater'' is among the several gods invoked in the ritual of ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#devotio|devotio]]'', by means of which a general sacrificed himself and the lives of the enemy to secure a Roman victory.&lt;ref&gt;For the text of this vow, see [[Novensiles#The invocation of Decius Mus|The invocation of Decius Mus]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Father Mars is the regular recipient of the ''[[suovetaurilia]]'', the sacrifice of a pig ''(sus)'', ram ''(ovis)'' and bull ''(taurus)'', or often a bull alone.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]], J.A. North, and S.R.F. Price, ''Religions of Rome: A Sourcebook'' (Cambridge University Press, 1998), pp. 71ff. for examples of a bull offering, p. 153 on the ''suovetaurilia''.&lt;/ref&gt; To ''Mars Pater'' other epithets were sometimes appended, such as ''Mars Pater Victor'' ("Father Mars the Victorious"),&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al.'', "Religions of Rome'', p. 370.&lt;/ref&gt; to whom the Roman army sacrificed a bull on March 1.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Henig, ''Religion in Roman Britain'' (London, 1984, 1995), p. 27, citing the military calendar from [[Dura-Europos]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Although ''pater'' and ''mater'' were fairly common as honorifics for a deity,&lt;ref&gt;Gary Forsythe, ''A Critical History of Early Rome: From Prehistory to the First Punic War'' (University of California Press, 2005), p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; any special claim for Mars as father of the Roman people lies in the mythic genealogy that makes him the divine father of [[Romulus and Remus]].&lt;ref&gt;Newlands, ''Playing with Time'', p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mars Silvanus====
In the section of his farming book that offers recipes and medical preparations, Cato describes a ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#votum|votum]]'' to promote the health of cattle:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Make an offering to Mars Silvanus in the forest ''(in silva)'' during the daytime for each head of cattle: 3 pounds of meal, 4½  pounds of bacon, 4½  pounds of meat, and 3 pints of wine. You may place the [[wikt:viands|viands]] in one vessel, and the wine likewise in one vessel. Either a slave or a free man may make this offering. After the ceremony is over, consume the offering on the spot at once. A woman may not take part in this offering or see how it is performed. You may vow the vow every year if you wish.&lt;ref&gt;''Votum pro bubus, uti valeant, sic facito. Marti Silvano in silva interdius in capita singula boum votum facito. Farris L. III et lardi P.39 IIII S et pulpae P. IIII S, vini S.40 III, id in unum vas liceto coicere, et vinum item in unum vas liceto coicere. Eam rem divinam vel servus vel liber licebit faciat. Ubi [[res divina]] facta erit, statim ibidem consumito. Mulier ad eam rem divinam ne adsit neve videat quo modo fiat. Hoc votum in annos singulos, si voles, licebit vovere.'' [[Cato the Elder]], ''On Farming'' 83, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cato/De_Agricultura/E*.html#83 English translation] from the [[Loeb Classical Library]], Bill Thayer's edition at [[LacusCurtius]].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That ''Mars Silvanus'' is a single entity has been doubted. [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#invocatio|Invocations of deities]] are often list-like, [[asyndeton|without connecting words]], and the phrase should perhaps be understood as "Mars and Silvanus".&lt;ref&gt;Robert Schilling, "Silvanus," in ''Roman and European Mythologies'' (University of Chicago Press, 1992, from the French edition of 1981), p. 146; Peter F. Dorcey, ''The Cult of Silvanus: A Study in Roman Folk Religion'' (Brill, 1992), pp. 8–9, 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Women were explicitly excluded from some cult practices of Silvanus, but not necessarily of Mars.&lt;ref&gt;Dorcey, ''The Cult of Silvanus'', pp. 9 and 105ff.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Warde Fowler]], however, thought that the wild [[Silvanus (mythology)|god of the wood Silvanus]] may have been "an emanation or offshoot" of Mars.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Warde Fowler]], ''The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic'' (London, 1908), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mars Ultor====
[[File:Romanfortatbalmu00mill orig 0143 Mars.png|thumb|right|upright=0.5|A statue to Mars Ultor from [[Balmuildy]] on the [[Antonine Wall]] has been scanned and a video produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statue of Mars Ultor, Balmuildy|url=https://vimeo.com/269194099|accessdate=19 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Augustus]] created the cult of "Mars the Avenger" to mark two occasions: his defeat of the [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|assassins of Caesar]] at [[Battle of Philippi|Philippi]] in 42 BC, and the negotiated return of the [[Aquila (Roman)|Roman battle standards]] that had been lost to the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]] at the [[Battle of Carrhae]] in 53 BC.&lt;ref name="Augustus Assembles His Marble City"&gt;{{cite AV media | url=https://www.coursera.org/learn/roman-architecture/lecture/6whGG/9-4-augustus-assembles-his-marble-city | title=Augustus Assembles His Marble City | publisher=Yale University | people=Diana E. E. Kleiner | medium=Multimedia presentation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The god is depicted wearing a cuirass and helmet and standing in a "martial pose," leaning on a lance he holds in his right hand. He holds a shield in his left hand.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Lipka, ''Roman Gods: A Conceptual Approach'' (Brill, 2009), p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; The goddess [[Ultio]], a divine personification of vengeance, had an altar and golden statue in his temple.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, ''Divine Qualities,'' pp. 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Temple of Mars Ultor, dedicated in 2 BC in the center of the [[Forum of Augustus]], gave the god a new place of honor.&lt;ref name="Augustus Assembles His Marble City"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Schilling, "Mars," ''Roman and European Mythologies'' (University of Chicago Press, 1992, from the French edition of 1981), p. 135; [[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]], J.A. North, and S.R.F. Price, ''Religions of Rome: A Sourcebook'' (Cambridge University Press, 1998), p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; Some rituals previously conducted within the cult of Capitoline Jupiter were transferred to the new temple,&lt;ref&gt;For instance, during the [[Roman Republic|Republic]], the ''[[Roman dictator|dictator]]'' was charged with the ritual ''[[clavum fingere|clavi figendi causa]]'', driving a nail into the wall of the Capitoline temple. According to [[Cassius Dio]] (55.10.4, as cited by Lipka, ''Roman Gods'', p. 108), this duty was transferred to a [[Roman censor|censor]] under Augustus, and the ritual moved to the Temple of Mars Ultor.&lt;/ref&gt; which became the point of departure for [[Roman magistrate|magistrates]] as they left for military campaigns abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Lipka, ''Roman Gods'', p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Augustus required the [[Roman senate|Senate]] to meet at the temple when deliberating questions of war and peace.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Sidebottom, "International Relations," in ''The Cambridge History of Greek and Roman Warfare: Rome from the Late Republic to the Late Empire'' (Cambridge University Press, 2007), vol. 2, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The temple also became the site at which sacrifice was made to conclude the [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Rites of passage|rite of passage]] of young men assuming the ''[[toga virilis]]'' ("man's toga") around age 14.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cassius Dio]] 55.10.2; Nicole Belyache, "Religious Actors in Daily Life," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt;

On various [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial holidays]], Mars Ultor was the first god to receive a sacrifice, followed by the [[Genius (mythology)|Genius]] of the emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Lipka, ''Roman Gods'', pp. 111–112.&lt;/ref&gt; An [[epigraphy|inscription]] from the 2nd century records a [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#votum|vow]] to offer Mars Ultor a bull with gilded horns.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' VI.1, no. 2086 (edition of Bormann and Henzen, 1876), as translated and cited by Charlotte R. Long, ''The Twelve Gods of Greece and Rome'' (Brill, 1987), pp. 130–131.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mars Augustus====

[[File:Église Saint-Pierre-et-Saint-Paul - Stèle Gallo-romaine 3.jpg|thumb|upright|Fragmentary dedication [[stele]] to Mars Augustus from [[Roman Gaul]]]]
''Augustus'' or ''Augusta'' was appended far and wide, "on monuments great and small,"&lt;ref&gt;Keith Hopkins, ''Conquerors and Slaves'' (Cambridge University Press, 1978), p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt; to the name of gods or goddesses, including Mars. The honorific marks the affiliation of a deity with [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]].&lt;ref&gt;A.E. Cooley, "Beyond Rome and Latium: Roman Religion in the Age of Augustus," in ''Religion in Republican Italy'' (Cambridge University Press, 2006), p. 247; Duncan Fishwick, ''The imperial cult in the Latin West'' (Brill, 2005), ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Hispania]], many of the statues and dedications to Mars Augustus were presented by members of the priesthood or [[Sodales|sodality]] called the ''[[Sodales Augustales]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Edmondson, "The Cult of ''Mars Augustus'' and Roman Imperial Power at ''Augusta Emerita (Lusitania)'' in the Third Century A.D.: A New Votive Dedication," in ''Culto imperial: politica y poder'' («L'Erma» di Bretschneider, 2007), p. 562. These include an inscription that was later built into the castle walls at [[Sines]], Portugal; dedications at Ipagrum ([[Aguilar de la Frontera]], in the modern [[Province of Córdoba (Spain)|province of Córdoba]]) and at Conobaria ([[Las Cabezas de San Juan]] in the [[province of Seville]]) in Baetica; and a statue at Isturgi ''([[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' II. 2121 = ''[[Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae|ILS]]'' II&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/7, 56). A ''magister'' of the "[[Lares]] of Augustus" made a dedication to Mars Augustus ''([[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' II. 2013 = ''[[Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae|ILS]]'' II&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/5, 773) at Singili(a) Barba (Cerro del Castillón, [[Antequera]]).&lt;/ref&gt; These vows ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#votum|vota]])'' were usually fulfilled within a sanctuary of Imperial cult, or in a temple or precinct (''[[templum]]'') consecrated specifically to Mars.&lt;ref&gt;Edmondson, "The Cult of ''Mars Augustus''," p. 563.&lt;/ref&gt; As with other deities invoked as ''Augustus'', altars to Mars Augustus might be set up to further the well-being (''[[salus]]'') of the emperor,&lt;ref&gt;Edmondson, "The Cult of ''Mars Augustus''," p. 562.&lt;/ref&gt; but some inscriptions suggest personal devotion. An inscription in the [[Alps]] records the gratitude of a [[Slavery in ancient Rome|slave]] who dedicated a statue to Mars Augustus as ''conservator corporis sui'', the preserver of his own body, said to have been vowed ''ex iussu numinis ipsius'', "by the order of the ''[[numen]]'' himself".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae|ILS]]'' 3160; Rudolf Haensch, "Inscriptions as Sources of Knowledge for Religions and Cults in the Roman World of Imperial Times," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Mars Augustus'' appears in inscriptions at sites throughout the Empire, such as [[Hispania Baetica]], [[Sagunto|Saguntum]],&lt;ref&gt;William Van Andringa, "Religions and the Integration of Cities in the Empire in the Second Century AD: The Creation of a Common Religious Language," ''A Companion to Roman Religion'', p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Emerita Augusta|Emerita]] ([[Lusitania]]) in Roman Spain;&lt;ref&gt;Edmondson, "The Cult of ''Mars Augustus''," pp. 541–575.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leptis Magna]] (with a date of 6–7 AD) in present-day [[Libya]];&lt;ref&gt;Ittai Gradel, ''Emperor Worship and Roman Religion'' (Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 238, note 11, citing Victor Ehrenberg and Arnold H.M. Jones, ''Documents Illustrating the Reigns of Augustus and Tiberius'' (Oxford University Press, 1955), no. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ulpia Traiana Sarmizegetusa|Sarmizegetusa]] in the [[Roman Dacia|province of Dacia]].&lt;ref&gt;The chief priest of the three Dacian provinces dedicated an altar ''pro salute'', for the wellbeing of [[Gordian III]], at an [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|imperial cult]] center sometime between 238 and 244 AD; Edmondson, "The Cult of ''Mars Augustus''," p. 562.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Provincial epithets===
In addition to his cult titles at Rome, Mars appears in a large number of [[epigraphy|inscriptions]] in the [[Roman province|provinces]] of the [[Roman Empire]], and more rarely in literary texts, [[interpretatio romana|identified with]] a local deity by means of an [[epithet]]. Mars appears with great frequency in [[Gaul]] among the [[Continental Celts]], as well as in [[Hispania|Roman Spain]] and [[Roman Britain|Britain]]. In Celtic settings, he is often invoked as a healer.&lt;ref&gt;Miranda Green, ''Animals in Celtic Life and Myth'' (Routledge, 1992), p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; The inscriptions indicate that Mars' ability to dispel the enemy on the battlefield was transferred to the sick person's struggle against illness; healing is expressed in terms of warding off and rescue.&lt;ref&gt;Ton Derks, ''Gods, Temples, and Ritual Practices: The Transformation of Religious Ideas and Values in Roman Gaul'' (Amsterdam University Press, 1998), p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Celtic Mars====
Mars is identified with a number of Celtic deities, some of whom are not attested independently.

*'''Mars Barrex''' is attested by a single dedicatory inscription found at [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], England.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''Dictionary of Celtic Religion and Culture'', p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Barrex'' or ''Barrecis'' probably means "Supreme One"&lt;ref name="Ross"/&gt; ([[Gaulish language|Gaulish]] ''barro-'', "head").&lt;ref&gt;Xavier Delamarre, ''Dictionnaire de la langue gauloise'' (Éditions Errance, 2003), p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Mars Loucetius'''. The Celtic god ''[[Loucetios]]'', Latinized as ''-ius'', appears in nine inscriptions in present-day Germany and France and one in Britain, and in three as ''Leucetius''. The [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]] and [[Brittonic languages|Brythonic]] [[wikt:theonym|theonyms]] likely derive from [[Proto-Celtic language|Proto-Celtic]] ''*louk(k)et-'', "bright, shining, flashing," hence also "lightning,"&lt;ref&gt;Xavier Delamarre, ''Dictionnaire de la langue gauloise'' (Éditions Errance, 2003), 2nd edition, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; alluding to either a Celtic commonplace [[metaphor]] between battles and thunderstorms (Old Irish ''torannchless'', the "thunder feat"), or the aura of a divinized hero (the ''lúan'' of [[Cú Chulainn]]). The name is given as an epithet of Mars. The consort of Mars Loucetius is [[Nemetona]], whose name may be understood as pertaining either to "sacred privilege" or to the [[sacred grove]] ''([[nemeton]])'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaulish]] ''[[nemeton]]'' was originally a [[sacred grove]] or space defined for religious purposes, and later a building: [[Bernhard Maier]], ''Dictionary of Celtic Religion and Culture'' (Boydell Press, 1997, 2000, originally published 1994 in German), p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; and who is also identified with the goddess [[Victoria (mythology)|Victoria]].

*'''Mars Neton''' or '''[[Neto (deity)|Neto]]''' was a Celtiberian god at Acci (modern [[Guadix]]). According to [[Macrobius]], he wore a [[radiant crown]] like a sun god, because the passion to act with valor was a kind of heat.

*'''Mars Nodens''' has a possible connection to the Irish mythological figure [[Nuada Airgetlám]].

*'''Mars Ocelus''' had an altar dedicated by a junior army officer at [[Caerwent]], and possibly a temple. He may be a local counterpart to Lenus.&lt;ref&gt;John Wacher, ''The Towns of Roman Britain'' (University of California Press, 1974), p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Mars Olloudius''' was depicted in a relief from Roman Britain without armor, in the guise of a ''[[Genius (mythology)|Genius]]'' carrying a double [[cornucopia]] and holding a libation bowl ''([[patera]])''.

===="Mars Balearicus"====

"Mars Balearicus" is a name used in modern scholarship for small bronze warrior figures from [[Majorca]] (one of the [[Balearic Islands]]) that are interpreted as representing the local Mars cult.&lt;ref&gt;G. Llompart, "Mars Balearicus," ''Boletín del Seminario de Estudios de Arte y Arqueología'' 26 (1960) 101–128; "Estatuillas de bronce de Mallorca: Mars Balearicus," in ''Bronces y religión romana: actas del XI Congreso Internacional de Bronces Antiguos, Madrid, mayo-junio, 1990'' (Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas, 1993), p. 57ff.&lt;/ref&gt; These statuettes have been found within [[Talaiot|talayotic]] sanctuaries with extensive evidence of burnt offerings. "Mars" is fashioned as a lean, athletic nude lifting a lance and wearing a helmet, often conical; the genitals are perhaps semi-erect in some examples.

Other bronzes at the sites represent the heads or horns of bulls, but the bones in the ash layers indicate that sheep, goats, and pigs were the sacrificial victims. Bronze horse-hooves were found in one sanctuary. Another site held an imported statue of [[Imhotep]], the legendary [[Ancient Egyptian medicine|Egyptian physician]]. These sacred precincts were still in active use when the Roman occupation began in 123 BC. They seem to have been astronomically oriented toward the rising or setting of the [[constellation]] [[Centaurus]].&lt;ref&gt;Jaume García Rosselló, Joan Fornés Bisquerra, and Michael Hoskin, "Orientations of the Talayotic Sanctuaries of Mallorca," ''Journal of History of Astronomy, Archaeoastronomy Supplement'' 31 (2000), pp. 58–64 (especially note 10) [http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?2000JHAS...31...58G&amp;defaultprint=YES&amp;filetype=.pdf pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mathieu de Montmorency - Young.jpg|thumb|right|Mathieu de Montmorency]]
[[File:Mathieu de Montmorency - Old.jpg|thumb|right|An older Montmorency]]
'''Mathieu Jean Felicité de Montmorency, duc de Montmorency-Laval''' (10 July 1767 – 24 March 1826) was a prominent French statesman during the [[French Revolution]] and [[Bourbon Restoration]]. He was elected as the youngest member of the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]] during the time of the French Revolution. He is also known for his military expertise, and ultimately this is what led to his fame. He was a well known statesman and politician who was popular for his revolutionary ideals. Throughout his life he served as a governor, a deputy of the Estates General, secretary of the assembly, and captain of the guards.

==Early years==
Mathieu de Montomorency was born in [[Paris|Paris, France]] on 10 July 1767. He was the son of [[Mathieu Paul Louis de Montmorency, vicomte de Laval]] (1748–1809) and [[Catherine Jeanne Tavernier de Boullongne]] (d. 1838).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=MONTMORENCY, MATHIEU JEAN FELICITE DE MONT-MORENCY-LAVAL|last=|first=|first2=|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica|year=2002|isbn=|location=Chicago, IL|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Montmorency's father was a scion of one of the [[Montmorency family|oldest noble families]] in France, while his wife was the daughter of an aristocratic French planter in [[Guadeloupe]]. His mother's illegitimate mulatto half-brother was the famous [[Chevalier de Saint-Georges]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He was a very tall, blonde, well-built man who had a contagious, youthful aura. Montmorency went on to seek higher education at College du Plessis, where he developed his love for the subject of philosophy and the idea of enlightenment.Montmorency was elected into the National Assembly at the very young age of 23.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At the time, he was the youngest member to serve on the [[Constituent assembly|Constituent Assembly]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Montmorency worked very diligently to make a name for himself among the other prominent members. He had great ease when it came to presenting his speeches.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although born into nobility, he did not let his arrogant reputation get the best of him.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He always regarded others with great manners. His hard work in the National Assembly ultimately led him to be appointed as the secretary of the assembly.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mathieu de Montmorency et Madame de Staël|last=Gautier|first=Paul|publisher=Plon|year=1908|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=1–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1780, his father, a colonel of the Auvergne regiment, was appointed a ''premier gentilhomme de la chambre'' to King [[Louis XVI of France]]'s younger brother, the [[Louis XVIII of France|Comte de Provence]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, when Catherine was denied the corresponding rank of ''[[lady-in-waiting|dame pour accompagner]]'' to the prince's wife, [[Marie Josephine Louise of Savoy|Marie-Joséphine]], due to her relatively low birth, Laval resigned his post in Provence's household.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Montmorency was a very intelligent man. He was a diplomatist and a great writer. He eventually went to become a tutor for Henry, duke de Bordeaux, the grandson of [[Charles X of France|Charles X]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Mathieu de Montmorency was married to his first cousin Hortense de Luynes. At the time this was seen as normal, because many noble families wanted to keep their bloodlines within each other.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, despite being married he actually paid very little attention to his wife. Due to the very relaxed nature of marriages, he often was seen without his wife.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In actuality, Montmorency was madly in love with another cousin by the name of Marquise de Laval. Laval died suddenly, and Montmorency went to a great depression.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Madame de Stael ultimately brought Montmorency out of his depression. Mathieu became Mme Stael’s friend in 1790 while he was in the constituent assembly.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She was 24 years old when they met, while he was only 23.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Mme Stael was a very educated woman. Their friendship started after writing a series of letters to each other. His attraction towards her grew more and more through each letter.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Career==
Originally known by the title of ''Comte de Montmorency-Laval'', Mathieu served as an adolescent with his father in the [[American Revolution]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; At the opening of the French Revolution, he joined the [[Estates General (France)|Third Estate]] and sat on the left side of the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]], shifting from originally being on the [[Estates of the realm|Second Estate]], the nobility.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He served in the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]] with [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; America was a new nation that had built its nation on democracy and liberty. Montmorency is credited for bringing these new governmental ideas to France. Montmorency was a member of the noble class.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The [[French nobility|nobility]] had a very negative reputation, as they were known for being greedy and discourteous.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, Montmorency’s actions began to change the way the nobility was viewed at the start of the revolution. He was extremely generous and showed great remorse to people, unlike others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; His ultimate goal was to make the French people happy, while still preserving the nobility. Years later, Montmorency went to become the Captain of the guards of the [[Count d’Artois]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He also became the governor of the city and castle of Gompiègne and was elected the deputy of the estates general for the nobility of Montfort.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These are all great accomplishments that Montmorency achieved throughout his life.

At the beginning of the [[Bourbon Restoration]], he was promoted to the rank of ''[[maréchal de camp]]'', and accompanied [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]] to [[Ghent]] during the [[Hundred Days]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; After the [[Battle of Waterloo]] and the final defeat of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] in 1815, he was made a [[Peerage of France|peer of France]] and received the title of ''Vicomte de Montmorency-Laval''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He was instrumental in convincing [[Armand-Emmanuel du Plessis, Duc de Richelieu]] to replace his former friend and former Bonapartist [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord]] as the new [[List of Prime Ministers of France|Prime Minister of France]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Known for strong reactionary, [[ultramontanism|ultramontane]], and [[Ultra-royalist]] views, Felicite became the French [[List of Foreign Ministers of France|minister of foreign affairs]] under [[Jean-Baptiste Guillaume Joseph, comte de Villèle]] in December 1821.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He recommended armed intervention in [[Spain]], to restore [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]], at the [[Congress of Verona]] in October 1822.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, he resigned his post in December, being compensated by the title of ''Duc de Montmorency-Laval'' and the cross of the [[Legion of Honour]] soon after.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Death==
He was elected to the [[Académie française]] in 1825, with few qualifications for the honour.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The following year, he was named tutor to the six-year-old heir to the throne, the [[Henri, comte de Chambord|Duc de Bordeaux]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He died two months after receiving this prestigious appointment, on 24 March 1826.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He was discovered seated lifeless at the end of the Good Friday Liturgy in St. Thomas d'Aquin church in the fashionable St. Germain des Près faubourg.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2660">'''Matonabbee''' ({{circa|1737}}&amp;ndash;1782) was a [[Chipewyan]] hunter and leader he also was a trader and was a Chipewyan representative at the prince of whales fort. He travelled with Chief [[Akaitcho]]'s older brother, Keskarrah.&lt;ref name="Crowe"&gt;{{cite book|last=Crowe|first=Keith J. |title=A history of the original peoples of northern Canada |publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|date=1991 |edition=2|pages=79|isbn=0-7735-0880-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iBISw4pPaDoC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;dq=akaitcho+chief+wives&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a#v=onepage&amp;q=akaitcho%20chief%20wives&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his father died, Matonabbee spent some time living at [[Prince of Wales Fort]] where he learned to speak [[English language|English]].

He acted as a guide for [[Samuel Hearne]] during his exploration from 1770 to 1772. On July 14, 1771, while on an [[Arctic]] overland journey, he, his followers, and a group of [[Yellowknives]], [[Dene]] known as Copper Indians, who had joined them at Clowey,&lt;ref&gt;Hearne, Samuel.

After the death of many Chipewyans during a [[smallpox]] epidemic of 1782 and the defeat of Fort Prince of Wales by the French, Matonabbee became depressed after the destruction of the Churchill Factory 1782, which had been the primary source of his fortune and fame. He had been the main middleman between the various tribes of the [[Cree]] and the [[Hudson's Bay Company]]. He then committed suicide by hanging himself, thus being the earliest record of a northern [[First Nations]] to kill himself.

'''''Ozzie's Girls''''' is an American [[sitcom]] [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''[[The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet]]'', which was broadcast in [[first-run syndication]]. The pilot episode, written by [[Ozzie Nelson]] and directed by [[David Nelson (actor)|David Nelson]], aired as a "special presentation" on [[NBC]] on September 10, 1972.&lt;ref name="The Portsmouth Times"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=B8lQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=WNAMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7341,275355|title=The Return of Ozzie and Harriet|author=Cecil Smith|date=September 4, 1972|work=The Portsmouth Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilmington N.C.

==Overview==
Like ''The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet'', the premise of ''Ozzie’s Girls'' mirrored some aspects the Nelsons’ real lives. ''Ozzie’s Girls'' picks up seven years after the cancellation of ''Ozzie and Harriet''. Ozzie and Harriet’s sons, [[David Nelson (actor)|David]] and [[Ricky Nelson|Ricky]], have grown up, moved out and have families of their own. In the pilot episode, Ozzie and Harriet discuss how empty and quiet their home is with their boys gone. They then decide to rent their sons' old bedroom to a college student and place an ad in the campus news.
The ad is answered by Jennifer McKenzie ([[Brenda Sykes]]), a sophisticated, neat and studious college student, who speaks to Harriet over the phone. After Harriet tells Jennifer (whose was renamed “Brenda” in the series) that the room is available, Jennifer sets up a time to come to the Nelsons house. While Jennifer is enroute to the Nelsons’ home, another student, a free spirited hippy “slob” named Susan “Susie” Hamilton  (Susan Sennett), answers the ad in person. After a minor misunderstanding over who answered the ad first, the girls decide to share the room. Despite their differences, the girls become fast friends and are soon considered to be part of the Nelson family by Ozzie and Harriet.

Much like ''Ozzie and Harriet'', episodes of ''Ozzie’s Girls'' center around the Nelsons being involved in lives and problems of “the kids”. Much of the humor stems from Ozzie and Harriet having to contend with girls' trials and dilemmas in more liberated era, after having raised two boys in a more conservative era.

{{Main|History of Microsoft|Microsoft#1972–1985: The founding of Microsoft}}
In 1975, in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], Allen and Gates began marketing a [[BASIC]] programming language interpreter.&lt;ref name="before microsoft"/&gt; Allen came up with the original name of "Micro-Soft" (a combination of "microcomputer" and "software"), according to a 1995 ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1995/10/02/206528/index.htm | work= CNN | first= Bill | last= Gates | title= Bill Gates &amp; Paul Allen Talk Check Out The Ultimate Buddy Act in Business History: The Multibillionaire Co-Founders Of Microsoft Sit Still For An Entire Afternoon To Tell Fortune's Brent Schlender Their Story And Speculate About The Future Of Personal Computing And Telecommunications | date= October 2, 1995 | quote = GATES: When we signed that first contract with MITS, we referred to ourselves as 'Paul Allen and Bill Gates doing business as Micro-Soft.' I don't remember why we spelled it with a hyphen and a capital 'S.' We put a credit line in the source code of our first product that said, 'Micro-Soft BASIC: Bill Gates wrote a lot of stuff; Paul Allen wrote some other stuff.' We never officially incorporated until 1981. ALLEN: We had talked about a lot of different names back in Boston, and at some point I said, 'Well, the totally obvious name would be Microsoft.'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, after Microsoft had committed to deliver IBM a disk operating system ([[DOS]]) for the original [[IBM PC]], although they had not yet developed one, Allen spearheaded a deal for Microsoft to purchase [[86-DOS|QDOS]] (Quick and Dirty Operating System), written by [[Tim Paterson]], who, at the time, was employed at [[Seattle Computer Products]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/07/30/msdos_paternity_suit_resolved/ MS-DOS paternity suit settled] The Register&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-cofounder-paul-allen-dies-at-age-65-2018-10 Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen dies at 65 after battle with cancer] Business Insider&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this transaction, Microsoft was able to secure a contract to supply the DOS that would eventually run on IBM's PC line. This contract with IBM proved the watershed in Microsoft history that led to Allen's and Gates' wealth and success.&lt;ref name="before microsoft"/&gt; Allen effectively left Microsoft in 1982 after receiving a [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]] diagnosis.&lt;ref name="before microsoft"/&gt;&lt;ref name=fortune2018&gt;[http://fortune.com/2018/10/01/paul-allen-cancer/ Microsoft Co-Founder Paul Allen Says His Cancer Has Returned, Expresses Optimism] Fortune&lt;/ref&gt;

Gates reportedly asked Allen to give him some of his shares to compensate for the higher amount of work being performed by Gates.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title= Idea Man: A Memoir by the Cofounder of Microsoft|last= Allen|first= Paul|publisher= Penguin Publishing Group|year= 2012|isbn= 978-1-101-47645-1|location= |page= 91 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=I2XUC0mp4wIC

Allen agreed to this arrangement, which Gates later renegotiated to 64–36.&lt;ref name=cnet2013&gt;{{cite web |title=Paul Allen: Gates, Ballmer tried to 'rip me off' |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/paul-allen-gates-ballmer-tried-to-rip-me-off/ |website=CNET |language=en |date=March 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, Gates tried to buy Allen out at $5 per share; however, Allen refused and left the company with his shares intact. This proved critical to Allen's becoming a billionaire after Microsoft went public.&lt;ref name=cnet2013/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title= Idea Man: A Memoir by the Cofounder of Microsoft| last= Allen|first=Paul| publisher= Penguin Publishing Group|year= 2012| isbn= 978-1-101-47645-1| location= |pages=, 164–169 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=I2XUC0mp4wIC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allen officially resigned from his position on the Microsoft board of directors on November 9, 2000. He remained as a senior strategy advisor to the company's executives.&lt;ref&gt;[https://money.cnn.com/2000/09/28/technology/microsoft/ Allen quits Microsoft board] CNN&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2000/sep/29/business/fi-28578 Microsoft Co-Founder Allen Is Stepping Down From the Board] Los Angeles Times&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.itweb.co.za/content/xnklOvzbyKRv4Ymz Microsoft co-founder Allen to step down from board] ITWeb&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2014, he still held 100 million shares of Microsoft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url = http://www.seattletimes.com/business/seahawks-beat-microsoft-as-investment-for-billionaire-paul-allen/| title= Seahawks beat Microsoft as investment for billionaire Paul Allen |author= Peter Robison and Brendan Coffey|publisher= The Seattle Times |date = January 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SpaceShipOne climbed to an altitude of {{convert|377591|ft|m|0}} over the [[Mojave Air and Space Port]] and was the first privately funded effort to successfully put a civilian in suborbital space. It won the [[Ansari X Prize]] competition and received the $10&amp;nbsp;million prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|accessdate=March 31, 2008|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/space/10/04/spaceshipone.attempt.cnn/index.html|title=SpaceShipOne captures X Prize|publisher=CNN|date=October 4, 2004|author=Ina Fried|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080321070412/http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/space/10/04/spaceshipone.attempt.cnn/index.html|archivedate=March 21, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 13, 2011, Allen announced the creation of [[Stratolaunch Systems]], based at the [[Mojave Air and Space Port]].

In 2016, Allen purchased a platform supply vessel and christened it [[RV Petrel|RV ''Petrel'']]. The project team aboard ''Petrel'' was responsible for locating [[Japanese battleship Musashi|IJN ''Musashi'']] when they were still aboard ''Octopus''.

In 2011 Philipp Nikandrov joined the leading Russian design company [http://gorproject.ru/en GORPROJECT] as its chief architect, managing the architectural design of few high-rise projects in Moscow and Saint-Petersburg.

== Work ==
[[File:Лахта-тауэр.jpg|thumb|213x213px|[[Lakhta Center|Lakhta-Center]] at [[Saint Petersburg|Saint-Petersburg]]'s seaside]]

Most notable amongst his large-scale projects from competition to realization was Okhta Centre (2006-2010) and later [[Lakhta Center|Lakhta Centre]] (from 2011) - Gazprom Headquarters in Saint-Petersburg with 465m tower component, which construction ends in 2018 and will rank as [[List of tallest buildings in Europe|Europe’s tallest skyscraper]] targeting [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] Gold certification for its achievements in sustainable design.

[[File:Poldowski (Régine (née Wieniawski), Lady Dean Paul).jpg|thumb|Poldowski (Régine (née Wieniawski), Lady Dean Paul), by Bassano Ltd, 1920]]

'''Poldowski''' was the professional pseudonym of a Belgian-born British composer and pianist born '''Régine Wieniawski'''&lt;ref name=couv&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musiwall.ulg.ac.be/IMG/pdf/MEW_poldowski_livret_070820_light.pdf|title=Manuel Couvreur, trans. Celia Skrine, Liner notes and texts for recording of Poldowski’s Verlaine songs by Élise Gabele and Phlippe Riga|website=Musiwall.ulg.ac.be|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (16 May 1879{{spaced ndash}}28 January 1932), daughter of the Polish violinist and composer [[Henryk Wieniawski]]. Some of her early works were published under the name '''Irène Wieniawska'''. She married [[Sir Aubrey Dean Paul, 5th Baronet]] (1869–1961), becoming '''Lady Dean Paul'''. Her name appears in a number of forms:
* Régine Wieniawski
* Irène Wieniawska
* Irene Regina Wieniawski or Wieniawska
* Lady Dean Paul
* Lady Irene Dean Paul
* Lady Irene Poldowski Paul
* (Madame) Poldowski, Poldowsky or Poldowska.

==Biography==
'''Régine Wieniawski''' was born on 16 May 1879 in [[Ixelles]], Brussels, where her father, the Polish virtuoso violinist and composer [[Henryk Wieniawski]], had earlier settled on his appointment as a professor of the [[Brussels Conservatory]]. Her mother was an Englishwoman, Isabelle Bessie Wieniawski (née Hampton),&lt;ref name=mwi&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2008/Mar08/Poldowski_mew0741.htm|title=POLDOWSKI Songs Musique Wallonie MEW0741 [GF]: Classical CD Reviews|first=MusicWeb|last=International|website=Musicweb-international.com|date=8 March 2008|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the niece of Irish pianist and composer [[George Alexander Osborne]] (who studied under [[Johann Peter Pixis]], [[François-Joseph Fétis]] and [[Friedrich Kalkbrenner]] and was a close friend of [[Frédéric Chopin]] and [[Hector Berlioz]]) and a member of a London family that had had associations with [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]], [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer]], [[Jenny Lind]], [[Michael William Balfe]] and [[Anton Rubinstein]].&lt;ref name=couv/&gt; She was named Régine after her paternal grandmother Regina Wolff.&lt;ref name=couv/&gt;

It is sometimes stated that Régine was born a few weeks after the death of her father. However, this seems to be an error caused by some earlier sources stating she was born in May 1880 rather than May 1879; her father died on 31 March 1880, in Moscow, while on a concert tour, when Irene was ten months old.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Her musical studies are also disputed. She initially studied piano with a Miss Ellis. She told her official biographers that she entered the Brussels Conservatoire at age 12, studying piano with Pierre Storck and composition with [[François-Auguste Gevaert]]. Later she continued her studies in London with [[Michael Hambourg]] and [[Percy Pitt]]. After her marriage she returned to Paris to study with [[André Gedalge]], and after her first child died she studied under [[Vincent d'Indy]] at the [[Schola Cantorum de Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kkccXvTYXU4C&amp;pg=PA449&amp;lpg=PA449&amp;dq=aubrey+dean+paul&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BGlkS1HGlg&amp;sig=-vm2MFjUxXafDwzJJxJkj9KiqEM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=sxnRSoPPOIiK6AOw843vAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CBoQ6AEwBjgU#v=onepage&amp;q=aubrey+dean+paul&amp;f=false|title=Dictionary of Music|date=1 November 2008|publisher=Read Books|accessdate=23 August 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s6XH8mOtfwcC&amp;pg=RA1-PA699&amp;lpg=RA1-PA699&amp;dq=aubrey+edward+henry+dean+paul&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UpY3w1HtmO&amp;sig=lHYIoyQXD6EmX67ojqFOYa0_E0A&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=DxzRSpWPCaja6gPn0KHoAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=aubrey+edward+henry+dean+paul&amp;f=false|title=Historia de Estados Unidos, 1607-1992|first=Maldwyn A.|last=Jones|date=23 August 1996|publisher=Cátedra|accessdate=23 August 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arcade-museum.com/mtr/MTR-1921-72-21/MTR-1921-72-21-39.pdf|format=PDF|title=Music Trade Review|website=Arcade-museum.com|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some of the above is contradicted by the fact that her name does not appear in any records of the Brussels Conservatory.&lt;ref name=couv/&gt;

In 1887, aged eight, she was introduced to and befriended by [[Nellie Melba]], then making her debut at [[La Monnaie]]. In 1893, aged 14, she publicly performed some of her own compositions. She was a neighbour of [[Octave Maus]] and her songs ''Cortège'' and ''Cythère'' were dedicated to Maus and his wife Madeleine.&lt;ref name=couv/&gt;

In 1896, Régine Wieniawski and her mother moved to London. There she published some early works under the name '''Irène Wieniawska'''.&lt;ref name=couv/&gt; In 1901, she married a descendant of the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|1st Duke of Marlborough]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldroots.com/brigitte/famous/j/johnchurchilldesc1650-3.htm|title=World Roots.com|website=Worldroots.com|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sir Aubrey Edward Henry Dean Paul, 5th Bt&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person.php?LinkID=mp61397|title=Profile|website=Npg.org.uk|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (19 October 1869 – 16 January 1961)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leighrayment.com/baronetage/baronetsP1.htm|title=leighrayment.com|website=Leighrayment.com|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; to whom she had been introduced by Nellie Melba. She thus became '''Lady Dean Paul''', and adopted British nationality, but continued to publish works as "Irène Wieniawska"&lt;ref name=couv/&gt; They had three children:
* Aubrey Donald Fitzwarren Severin Dean Paul (1902–04)
* [[Brian Kenneth Dean Paul, 6th Baronet Paul of Rodborough|Sir Brian Kenneth "Napper" Dean Paul, 6th Bt.]] (1904–72;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leighrayment.com/baronetage/baronetsP1.htm|title=Baronetage|website=Leighrayment.com|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; an amateur muralist and opium taker, whose portrait was painted by [[Lucian Freud]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hwlondonartandartistsguide.com/review.asp?ID=395|title=Museum and Gallery Reviews|website=Hwlondonartandartistsguide.com|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Brenda Irene Isabelle Dean Paul]] (1907–59; she became a well-known actress and "society drug addict" who was frequently arrested on charges of possession. She spent time in [[Holloway (HM Prison)|Holloway Prison]].

The early death of Lady Dean Paul's first-born son devastated her and ultimately led to the break-up of her marriage.{{cn|date=April 2018}} It inspired three works, the songs ''Soir'' and ''Berceuse d'Armorique'', and the violin-piano piece ''Berceuse pour l'enfant mourant''. She then adopted the pseudonym '''Poldowski'''.&lt;ref name=couv/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;It is stated in some sources that Régine Wieniawski had an earlier marriage to a "Theodore Presser Poldowski", from whom she derived her professional name; but this is not supported in more reliable sources.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Gervase Elwes]] introduced her [[Paul Verlaine]] songs to the English concert stage in 1912 at the Queen's Hall. These songs then had a great vogue in Paris and this performance made a deep impression. He had been impressed with her music ever since he had first encountered it almost 20 years earlier, in 1893 in Brussels. He felt they showed "great originality and for her age, great finish".&lt;ref name=couv/&gt; Elwes encountered her again in 1903, in Brussels, and she dedicated two of her songs to him.&lt;ref name=couv/&gt; A concert of her songs she was to have given in the United States with Gervase Elwes in 1921 had to be cancelled when he was killed in a rail accident in Boston.&lt;ref name=couv/&gt;

She moved to Brussels in the spring of 1912 after [[Elisabeth of Bavaria (1876–1965)|Queen Elizabeth of Belgium]] had expressed a desire to hear her. She accompanied Émile Chaumont in the premiere of her Violin Sonata in D minor, which was dedicated to Octave Maus, and was then performed in Paris by her close friend, the French pianist [[Lazare Lévy]], whom she had met in Miss Ellis's class. Lévy premiered her piano solo piece ''Caledonian Market'', in 1923. In January 1912 her friend [[Henry Wood]] conducted the premieres of her ''Suite miniature'' and ''Nocturnes'' at the Sunday Concerts. In 1913 she returned to Brussels for the last time to accompany [[Jane Bathori|Jane Bathori-Engel]] in four of her Verlaine settings.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

She and her family converted to [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] in 1916. In 1919, at the Queen's Hall, Henry Wood accompanied Poldowski at the premiere of her piano and orchestra piece, "Pat Malone's Wake". She fell seriously ill in the autumn of 1913.&lt;ref name=couv/&gt; In August 1919 Poldowski moved to the United States, where her "symphonic opera" ''Silence'' was published despite serious financial issues. She legally separated from her husband in 1921.&lt;ref name=couv/&gt;

She returned to London in 1922; her regular visitors included playwright [[Alfred Sutro]], mezzo-soprano [[Marguerite d'Alvarez]], conductor [[Eugène Goossens, fils]], harpsichordist [[Violet Gordon-Woodhouse]], violinist [[Paul Kochanski]]&lt;ref name=couv/&gt; and composer [[George Gershwin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VN8PWhVnazwC&amp;pg=PA138&amp;lpg=PA138&amp;dq=poldowski+gershwin&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=HqLJItqkqE&amp;sig=M-2UgQTDLZV8-3BJNB-FVeXHRNg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=MEfRSuSwOJrY7AO1iYXiAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=poldowski+gershwin&amp;f=false|title=George Gershwin: His Life and Work|first=Howard|last=Pollack|date=15 January 2007|publisher=University of California Press|accessdate=23 August 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her 1923 series of midday recitals at the Hyde Park Hotel, known as ''The International Concerts of [[La Libre Esthétique]]'', attracted [[Arthur Rubinstein]], [[Jacques Thibaud]] and the [[London Quartet|London String Quartet]]. She also opened a fashionable ''[[haute couture]]'' boutique where she produced several creations for the British Royal Family. On a 1925 tour of Spain, she was given a gift of a diamond bracelet by the King and Queen of Spain.&lt;ref name=couv/&gt;

==Death==
She later became seriously ill with [[pneumonia]], her right lung was removed, and died of a heart attack on 28 January 1932, in London, aged 52.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Music==
Poldowski was a gifted composer of songs, and her style shows strong influences of [[Claude Debussy]].&lt;ref name=couv/&gt; She set 22 French texts of [[Paul Verlaine]], as well as English texts by [[William Blake]], [[W. B. Yeats]], [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]] and others.&lt;ref name=mwi/&gt;

'''Sani Abacha''' ({{pronunciation|En-us-Sani Abacha from Nigeria pronunciation (Voice of America).ogg}}; 20 September 1943 – 8 June 1998) was a [[Nigerian Army]] officer and politician who served as the [[List of heads of state of Nigeria|''de facto'' President]] of [[Nigeria]] from 1993 to 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Paden, John N. (2005) ''Muslim Civic Cultures and Conflict Resolution'', [[Brookings Institution]] Press. p. 240. {{ISBN|0-8157-6817-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
A [[Kanuri people|Kanuri]] from [[Borno State|Borno]], Abacha was born and brought up in [[Kano, Nigeria]]. He attended the [[Nigerian Defence Academy|Nigerian Military Training College]] and [[Mons Officer Cadet School]] before being commissioned as a 2nd lieutenant in 1963.&lt;ref name=Bio&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography|url=http://www.saniabacha.com/index1.php?getpage=biography|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115132729/http://www.saniabacha.com/index1.php?getpage=biography|dead-url=yes|archive-date=15 November 2012|publisher=Sani Abacha|accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military career==

Abacha was [[Commissioned officer|commissioned]] in 1963 after he had attended [[Mons Officer Cadet School]] in [[Aldershot]], [[England]]. Before then, he had attended the [[Nigerian Military Training College]] in [[Kaduna]].{{cn|date=November 2018}}

===Participation in coups===

Abacha's military career is distinguished by a string of successful coups. He is by some records the most successful coup plotter in the history of Nigeria's military. Abacha, then a 2nd Lieutenant with the 3rd Battalion in Kaduna, took part in the [[1966 Nigerian counter-coup|July 1966 Nigerian counter-coup]] from the conceptual stage.&lt;ref name=Siollun&gt;{{cite book|last1=Siollun|first1=Max|title=Oil, Politics and Violence: Nigeria's Military Coup Culture (1966–1976)|publisher=Algora|isbn=9780875867090|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; He may have been a participant in the Lagos or Abeokuta phases of the [[1966 Nigerian coup d'état|coup the previous January]] as well.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

He was also a prominent figure in the [[1983 Nigerian coup d'état]] which brought General [[Muhammadu Buhari]] to power in 1983, and the August 1985 coup which removed Buhari from power.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} When General [[Ibrahim Babangida]] was named President and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of [[Nigeria]] in 1985, Abacha was named Chief of Army Staff. He was appointed [[Defence Minister of Nigeria|Minister of Defence]] in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Oyewole, A. (1987) ''Historical Dictionary of Nigeria'', Scarecrow Press. p. 385. {{ISBN|0-8108-1787-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9389478|title=Encyclopedia – Britannica Online Encyclopedia|work=eb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, Abacha became the first Nigerian soldier to attain the rank of a full General without skipping a single rank.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

==Seizure of power==

On 17 November 1993, Abacha overthrew the short-lived transitional government of Chief [[Ernest Shonekan]]. In September 1994, he issued a decree that placed his government above the jurisdiction of the courts, effectively giving him absolute power.  Another decree gave him the right to detain anyone for up to three months without trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/07/world/nigerian-military-ruler-assumes-absolute-power.html|title=Nigerian Military Ruler Assumes Absolute Power|date=7 September 1994|work=AP|via=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presidency==
The Abacha administration became the first to record unprecedented economic achievements:&lt;ref name=premiumtimes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/156004-why-we-honoured-abacha-nigerian-government.html|title=Why we honoured Abacha – Nigerian government – Premium Times Nigeria|work=Premium Times Nigeria}}&lt;/ref&gt; he oversaw an increase in the country's foreign exchange reserves from $494 million in 1993 to $9.6 billion by the middle of 1997, reduced the external debt of Nigeria from $36 billion in 1993 to $27 billion by 1997, brought all the controversial privatization programs of the Babangida administration to halt, reduced an inflation rate of 54% inherited from Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida to 8.5% between 1993 and 1998, all while the nation's primary commodity, oil was at an average of $15 per barrel.&lt;ref name="premiumtimes"/&gt;

===Human rights abuses===
Abacha's government was accused of [[human rights]] abuses, especially after the hanging of [[Ogoni]] activist [[Ken Saro-Wiwa]]&lt;ref name="Arnold789"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arnold|first1=Guy|title=Africa: A Modern History|date=2005|publisher=Atlantic Books|location=London|isbn=9781843541769|page=789}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Oputa Commission]] (only one of several executions of Ogoni activists opposed to the exploitation of Nigerian resources by the [[multinational corporation|multinational]] [[petroleum]] company, [[Royal Dutch Shell]] Group); [[Moshood Abiola]] and [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] were jailed for treason, and [[Wole Soyinka]] charged in absentia with treason.&lt;ref name="eb"/&gt; His regime suffered opposition externally by pro-democracy activists. He however supported the [[Economic Community of West African States]] and sent Nigerian troops to [[Liberia]] and [[Sierra Leone]] to help restore democracy to those countries.

Despite being repeatedly condemned by the [[US State Department]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/news/feature/1999/11/09/braun|title=Return of the ugly American|work=salon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abacha did have a few ties to American politics. In 1997, Senator [[James Inhofe]] ([[US Republican Party|R]]-[[Oklahoma]]) travelled to Nigeria to meet with Abacha as a representative of the "[[The Family (Christian political organization)|Family]]", a group of [[Christian evangelism|evangelical Christian]] politicians and civic leaders. Abacha and the Family had a business and political relationship from that point until his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://motherjones.com/politics/2010/11/doug-coe-inhofe-siljander-c-street|title=Junkets for Jesus|work=Mother Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=121755993|title=A Different Perspective On 'The Family' And Uganda|date=22 December 2009|work=NPR.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Abacha also developed ties with other American political figures such as Senator [[Carol Moseley Braun]], Rev. [[Jesse Jackson]] and Minister [[Louis Farrakhan]]. Several African American political leaders visited Nigeria during his reign and Farrakhan supported his administration.

===Corruption allegations===

During Abacha's regime, he and his family reportedly stole a total of [[£]]5 billion from the country's coffers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/19/world/late-nigerian-dictator-looted-nearly-500-million-swiss-say.html | work=The New York Times | title=Late Nigerian Dictator Looted Nearly $500 Million, Swiss Say | date=19 August 2004 | accessdate=9 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Abacha was listed as the fourth most corrupt leader in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transparency.org/content/download/4459/26786/file/Introduction_to_political_corruption.pdf|format=PDF|title=Introduction to Political Corruption|page=13|location=London|date=25 March 2004|website=transparency.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a service marking the 10th anniversary of the death of the dictator, several former Nigerian heads of state, including [[Muhammadu Buhari|Gen. Muhammadu Buhari]], refuted claims that Abacha looted the country, claiming such accusations are "baseless".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thisdayonline.com/nview.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=31 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919105217/http://www.thisdayonline.com/nview.php |archivedate=19 September 2010 |df= }}? id=113628&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guardiannewsngr.com/news/article03//indexn2_html?pdate=090608&amp;ptitle=Abacha%20served%20Nigeria%20well,%20say%20Buhari,%20Abdulsalami|title=TV and Internet Bundles - American Main Street|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.transparency.org/publications/gcr/download_gcr/download_gcr_2004 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=24 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070922043005/http://www.transparency.org/publications/gcr/download_gcr/download_gcr_2004 |archivedate=22 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Abacha's national security adviser, Alhaji [[Ismaila Gwarzo]], played a central role in the looting and transfer of money to overseas accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=24 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His son [[Mohammed Abacha]] and best friend Alh. Mohammed M. Sada were also involved.

A preliminary report published by the [[Abdulsalam Abubakar]] transitional government in November 1998 described the process. Sani Abacha told Ismaila Gwarzo to provide fake funding requests, which Abacha approved. The funds were usually sent in cash or travellers' cheques by the [[Central Bank of Nigeria]] to Gwarzo, who took them to Abacha's house. Mohammed Sada then arranged to launder the money to offshore accounts. But several calls for the prosecution of MM.Sada were turned down by the Olusegun Obasanjo presidency even after being indicted by the Justice Oputa lead Human Rights Violation Investigation Commission (popularly known as Oputa Panel).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv

In March 2014, the United States Department of Justice revealed that it had frozen more than $458 million believed to have been illegally obtained by Abacha and other corrupt officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reuters|title=US freezes $458m hidden by Nigerian ex-leader|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2014/03/us-freezes-458m-hidden-nigerian-ex-leader-20143664513203928.html|publisher=Al Jazeera|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/washingtondc/press-releases/2014/u.s.-forfeits-more-than-480-million-stolen-by-former-nigerian-dictator-in-largest-forfeiture-ever-obtained-through-a-kleptocracy-action|title=FBI — U.S. Forfeits More Than $480 Million Stolen by Former Nigerian Dictator in Largest Forfeiture Ever Obtained Through a Kleptocracy Action|work=FBI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Early in 1998, Abacha announced that elections would be held in August of the same year, with a view toward handing power to a civilian government on 1 October.  It soon became apparent, though, that Abacha had no intention of permitting an honest election; by April he had strong-armed the country's five parties into endorsing him as the sole presidential candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/10/world/new-nigeria-chief-pledges-a-return-to-civilian-rule.html|title=NEW NIGERIA CHIEF PLEDGES A RETURN TO CIVILIAN RULE|date=10 June 1998|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/109265.stm|title=BBC News – Nigeria – Abacha dies at 54|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abacha died in June 1998 while at the presidential villa in Abuja. He was buried on the same day, according to [[Muslim]] tradition, without an [[autopsy]]. This fueled speculation that he may have been executed extrajudicially by way of being poisoned by political rivals via prostitutes.&lt;ref name="Abacha Profile"&gt;{{cite web|title=General Sani Abacha Profile|url=http://www.africa-confidential.com/whos-who-profile/id/2651/|publisher=Africa Confidential|accessdate=19 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government identified the cause of death as a sudden [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/11/world/us-aides-say-nigeria-leader-might-have-been-poisoned.html?scp=8&amp;sq=abacha&amp;st=cse | work=The New York Times | title=U.S. Aides Say Nigeria Leader Might Have Been Poisoned | first=Tim | last=Weiner | date=11 July 1998 | accessdate=9 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is reported that he was in the company of two Indian prostitutes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Malhotra, Jyoti | work=The Indian Express | title=Did Indian girls see Nigerian dictator die? | url=http://expressindia.indianexpress.com/news/ie/daily/19980821/23350964.html | accessdate=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; imported from [[Dubai]]. It is thought that the prostitutes laced his drink with a poisonous substance, making Abacha feel unwell around 4:30am. He retired to his bed and was dead by 6:15am.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thenigerianvoice.com/nvnews/37233/1/general-sani-abacha-adapted-from-naiwu-osahons-boo.html | work=The Nigerian Voice | title=GENERAL SANI ABACHA (Adapted from Naiwu Osahon's book, The Viper's Den) | first=Naiwu | last=Osahon | date=28 October 2010 | accessdate=2 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Abacha's death, Maj. Gen. [[Abdulsalami Abubakar]], Nigeria's [[Chief of the Defence Staff (Nigeria)|Chief of Defence Staff]], was sworn in as the country's head of state. Abubakar had never before held public office and was quick to announce a transition to democracy, which led to the election of President [[Olusegun Obasanjo]].

Abacha was married to [[Maryam Abacha]] and had seven sons and three daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/resources/newsmakers/world/africa/abacha.html |title="Newsmaker Profiles: Sani Abacha Nigerian President" |accessdate=26 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040408102654/http://www.cnn.com/resources/newsmakers/world/africa/abacha.html |archivedate=8 April 2004 |df= }}, ''[[CNN]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; He left fifteen grandchildren: eight girls and seven boys.

==Legacy==
Abacha's legacy is mixed. His administration oversaw [[Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group|ECOMOG]] military successes in West Africa that raised Nigeria's military profile.&lt;ref name=TheIndependent&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kirk-Greene|first1=Anthony|title=Obituary: General Sani Abacha|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-general-sani-abacha-1163944.html|website=The Independent (UK)|accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2014, during Nigeria's centenary celebrations, the Nigerian government honoured Abacha for his contributions to the country's development&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Usman|first1=Talatu|title=Premium times|url=http://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/156004-why-we-honoured-abacha-nigerian-government.html|website=premiumtimesng.com|accessdate=20 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; though [[Nobel Laureate]] [[Wole Soyinka]] who was similarly honored by the administration of President [[Goodluck Jonathan]] criticized the honor bestowed on Abacha by rejecting the honor, noting it as the 'canonization of terror'.&lt;ref name=Punch-NG&gt;{{cite web|last1=Okpi|first1=Allwell|title=Sharing centenary award with Abacha, an insult|url=http://www.punchng.com/news/sharing-centenary-award-with-abacha-an-insult-soyinka/|website=The Punch (Nigeria)|accessdate=23 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302111720/http://www.punchng.com/news/sharing-centenary-award-with-abacha-an-insult-soyinka/|archivedate=2 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soyinka further noted that by honouring Abacha, the government of Goodluck Jonathan had gathered "a century’s accumulated degeneracy in one preeminent symbol, then place[d] it on a podium for the nation to admire, emulate and even – worship".&lt;ref name=Punch-NG /&gt; Abacha was largely unpopular in southern Nigeria because of his administration's human rights abuses, execution of [[Ken Saro Wiwa]], resulting in Nigeria attaining a pariah status internationally.&lt;ref name=NYT-Commonwealth&gt;{{cite web|title=Commonwealth Suspends Nigeria Over Executions|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/12/world/commonwealth-suspends-nigeria-over-executions.html|website=New York Times|accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Falola-Heaton&gt;{{cite book|last1=Falola &amp; Heaton|title=A History of Nigeria|publisher=Cambridge University Press, 2008|isbn=9781139472036|page=xix|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XygZjbNRap0C&amp;pg=PR19&amp;lpg=PR19&amp;dq=nigeria+as+a+pariah+state+abacha&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ETDHqMf0QM&amp;sig=4DJTvfSgBx78AW0lsWzeFXv0CJc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAWoVChMIiuLBhai_xwIVScyACh34Sw0f#v=onepage&amp;q=nigeria%20as%20a%20pariah%20state%20abacha&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===False representation of name===

===Recovery of stolen funds===
After Abacha's death, the Obasanjo government implicated Abacha and his family in a wholesale looting of Nigeria's coffers. The late dictator's son, [[Mohammed Abacha]], continues to maintain that all the assets in question were legitimately acquired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/21/weekinreview/ideas-trends-a-nigerian-miracle.html | work=The New York Times | title=Ideas &amp; Trends; A Nigerian Miracle | first=Floyd | last=Norris | date=21 April 2002 | accessdate=9 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Easterly, William. (2002) ''The Elusive Quest for Growth'', MIT Press. p. 245. {{ISBN|0-262-55042-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, Abacha's family purportedly agreed to return $1.2 billion that was taken from the central bank.&lt;ref&gt;The Worldwatch Institute. (2003) ''Vital Signs 2003'', The Worldwatch Institute. p. 115. {{ISBN|0-393-32440-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. forfeiture of Abacha for $480 million===
On 7 August 2014, the [[United States Department of Justice]] (DOJ) announced the largest forfeiture in the DOJ's history: the return of $480 million to the Nigerian government.&lt;ref name=DOJ&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Forfeits Over $480 Million Stolen by Former Nigerian Dictator in Largest Forfeiture Ever Obtained Through a Kleptocracy Action|url=http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-forfeits-over-480-million-stolen-former-nigerian-dictator-largest-forfeiture-ever-obtained|website=The United States Department of Justice|accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assistant Attorney General Caldwell noted that "rather than serve his country, General Abacha used his public office in Nigeria to loot millions of dollars, engaging in brazen acts of kleptocracy".&lt;ref name=DOJ /&gt; “With this judgment, we have forfeited $480 million in corruption proceeds that can be used for the benefit of the Nigerian people. Through the [[Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative]], the Department of Justice’s Criminal Division denies kleptocrats like Abacha the fruits of their crimes, and protects the U.S. financial system from money laundering. In coordination with our partners in Jersey, France and the United Kingdom, we are helping to end this chapter of corruption and flagrant abuse of office.”&lt;ref name=DOJ /&gt;

According to the DOJ forfeiture, the assets returned to the Nigerian government represented proceeds of corruption during and after the military regime of General Abacha. The complaint alleges that General Abacha, his son [[Mohammed Abacha|Mohammed Sani Abacha]], their associate [[Abubakar Atiku Bagudu]] and others embezzled, misappropriated and extorted billions of dollars from the government of Nigeria and others, then laundered their criminal proceeds through U.S. financial institutions and the purchase of bonds backed by the United States. As alleged in the complaint, General Abacha and others systematically embezzled billions of dollars in public funds from the [[Central Bank of Nigeria]] under a false national security imperative. The complaint further alleged that Abacha and his conspirators withdrew the funds in cash and then moved the money overseas through U.S. financial institutions. General Abacha and his finance minister also allegedly caused the government of Nigeria to purchase Nigerian government bonds at vastly inflated prices from a company controlled by Bagudu and Mohammed Abacha, generating an illegal windfall of more than $282 million. In addition, Abacha and his associates allegedly extorted more than $11 million from a French company and its Nigerian affiliate in connection with payments on government contracts. Funds involved in each of these schemes were allegedly laundered through the United States.&lt;ref name=DOJ /&gt;

'''Shiva Naipaul''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|aɪ|p|ɔː|l|,_|n|aɪ|ˈ|p|ɔː|l}}; 25 February 1945 – 13 August 1985), born '''Shivadhar Srinivasa Naipaul''' in [[Port of Spain]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], was a Trinidadian and British novelist and journalist.

==Biography==
Shiva Naipaul was the younger brother of novelist [[V. S. Naipaul]]. He went first to [[Queen's Royal College]] and [[Saint Mary's College, Trinidad and Tobago|St Mary's College]] in Trinidad, then emigrated to Britain, having won a scholarship to study Chinese at [[University College, Oxford]]. At Oxford, he met and later married Jenny Stuart, with whom he had a son, Tarun.&lt;ref name=Wheatcroft&gt;Geoffrey Wheatcroft, [https://www.spectator.co.uk/2005/08/sardonic-genius/ "Sardonic Genius - Geoffrey Wheatcroft recalls his friendship with the writer Shiva Naipaul, who died 20 years ago"], ''[[The Spectator]]'', 13 August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

With Jenny's support, Shiva Naipaul wrote his first novel, ''Fireflies'' (1970), which won the [[Winifred Holtby Memorial Prize]] from the Royal Society of Literature for best regional novel.  It was followed by ''[[The Chip-Chip Gatherers]]'' (1973). He then decided to concentrate on [[journalism]], and wrote two non-fiction works, ''[[North of South]]'' (1978) and ''[[Black &amp; White (book)|Black &amp; White]]'' (1980), before returning to the novel form in the 1980s with ''[[A Hot Country]]'' (1983), a departure from his two earlier comic novels set in Trinidad, as well as a collection of fiction and non-fiction, ''[[Beyond the Dragon's Mouth: Stories and Pieces]]'' (1984).&lt;ref name=Wheatcroft /&gt;

On the morning of 13 August 1985, at the age of 40, Naipaul had a fatal [[heart attack]] while working at his desk.&lt;ref name=Wheatcroft /&gt;

==Legacy and posthumous reputation==
''[[The Spectator]]'' magazine, for which his wife Jenny had worked as a secretary, and which had published many of his articles, established the Shiva Naipaul Memorial Prize.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spectator.co.uk/the-magazine/features/29375/part_8/the-visit.thtml "The visit"]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''The Spectator''.&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Paul Theroux]]'s ''Sir Vidia's Shadow'', a memoir of Shiva's elder brother, V. S. Naipaul, Theroux described Shiva as a "sot", shrunken by the towering figure of his successful brother, with a penchant for drunken partying and a need to have his meals made for him. Theroux also took issue with Naipaul's skills as a writer, particularly as a [[travel literature|travel writer]].

''Sir Vidia's Shadow'' has come under attack for what are described as inaccuracies,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2008/03/23/sv_naipaul.xml&amp;page=3 Patrick French's biography of VS Naipaul: Naipaul's friendship with Paul Theroux], ''The Daily Telegraph''.&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and the novelist [[Martin Amis]] wrote that "Shiva Naipaul was one of those people who caused your heart to lift when he entered the room ... in losing him, we have lost thirty years of untranscribed, unvarnished genius".&lt;ref&gt;Martin Amis, ''New Statesman'', April 1973, "Black and White" by Shiva Naipaul, reprinted in ''The War Against Cliché: Essays and Reviews, 1971–2000''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Craft, [http://articles.courant.com/2001-11-16/features/0111161412_1_sir-kingsley-amis-cliches-levine "A Critical Take On Cliche"], ''Hartford Courant'', 16 November 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

An ''[[Arena (UK TV series)|Arena]]'' [[Documentary film|documentary]] on his brother V. S. Naipaul reproduced footage of Shiva from an earlier documentary from the early 1980s, in which Shiva returned to Trinidad to see his mother.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b009s80n|title=''Arena: The Strange Luck of V.S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2600">'''Sir Barry Denny, 2nd Baronet''' (died 20 October 1794) was an [[Anglo-Irish]] politician.

Denny was the son of [[Sir Barry Denny, 1st Baronet]] and Jane Denny. He served as an officer in the Kerry Militia, eventually becoming a Major. Following his father's death in April 1794, he became a baronet and was elected to his late father's seat in the [[Irish House of Commons]], representing [[Kerry (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Kerry]].&lt;ref&gt;''A Genealogical and Heraldic Dictionary of the Peerage and Baronetage of the British Empire'' (Henry Colburn, 1839), 288.&lt;/ref&gt; He also served as [[High Sheriff of Kerry]] in 1794. At a by-election for the seat in October that year, Denny promised to remain neutral and not come between the Crosbie, Blennerhassett and Herbert families who were contesting the seat. One of the candidates, John Gustavus Crosbie, took offence at one of Denny's remarks which he took to be a breach of his neutrality, and challenged him to a duel. Denny was shot through the head and killed by Crosbie in the ensuing duel.&lt;ref&gt;'Parliamentary Representation of Kerry' in ''The Kerry Magazine'' (No.35 Vol.3, 1856)&lt;/ref&gt; He had married Anne Morgell, the daughter of Crosbie Morgell, on 12 January 1794, and died without issue.&lt;ref&gt;''A Genealogical and Heraldic Dictionary of the Peerage and Baronetage of the British Empire'' (Henry Colburn, 1839), 288.&lt;/ref&gt; He was about to be raised to the [[Peerage of Ireland]] as Baron Denmore when he was killed.

'''Spring-heeled Jack ''' is an entity in [[English folklore]] of the [[Victorian era]]. The first claimed sighting of Spring-heeled Jack was in 1837.&lt;ref&gt;Sharon McGovern ("The Legend of Spring Heeled Jack") claims that a letter to the editor of the ''Sheffield Times'' in 1808 talks of a ghost by that name years previously; McGovern neither specifies the day in 1808 so that the letter can be verified nor lists any secondary source (for this or anything else). In addition, the ''Sheffield Times'' did not launch until April 1846.&lt;/ref&gt; Later sightings were reported all over Great Britain and were especially prevalent in suburban London, the [[Midlands (England)|Midlands]] and [[Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;For an account of an incident from Edinburgh that was misinterpreted as a sighting of Spring-heeled Jack, see ''The Weekly Scotsman'', 16 January 1897.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many theories about the nature and identity of Spring-heeled Jack. This [[urban legend]] was very popular in its time, due to the tales of his bizarre appearance and ability to make extraordinary leaps, to the point that he became the topic of several works of fiction.

Spring-heeled Jack was described by people who claimed to have seen him as having a terrifying and frightful appearance, with diabolical [[physiognomy]], clawed hands, and eyes that "resembled red balls of fire". One report claimed that, beneath a black cloak, he wore a helmet and a tight-fitting white garment like an [[oilskin]]. Many stories also mention a "Devil-like" aspect. Others said he was tall and thin, with the appearance of a [[gentleman]]. Several reports mention that he could breathe out blue and white flames and that he wore sharp metallic claws at his fingertips. At least two people claimed that he was able to speak comprehensible English.

== History ==

===Precedents===
In the early 19th century, there were reports of [[ghost]]s that stalked the streets of London. These human-like figures were described as pale; it was believed that they stalked and preyed on lone pedestrians. The stories told of these figures formed part of a distinct ghost tradition in London which, some writers have argued, formed the foundation of the later legend of Spring-heeled Jack.&lt;ref name="History Today"&gt;Jacob Middleton, "An Aristocratic Spectre", ''History Today'' (February 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important of these early entities was the [[Hammersmith Ghost]], which in 1803 and 1804 was reported in [[Hammersmith]] on the western fringes of London; it would later reappear in 1824. Another apparition, the Southampton ghost, was also reported as assaulting individuals in the night. This particular spirit bore many of the characteristics of Spring-heeled Jack, and was reported as jumping over houses and being over {{convert|10|ft|abbr=on}} tall.&lt;ref name="History Today"/&gt;

=== Early reports ===
[[File:Springheel Jack.png|thumb|left|Illustration of Spring-heeled Jack, from the serial ''Spring-heel'd Jack: The Terror of London'']]
The first alleged sightings of Spring-heeled Jack were made in London in 1837 and the last reported sighting is said in most of the secondary literature to have been made in [[Liverpool]] in 1904.&lt;ref name=scotsman1&gt;David Cordingly, "[http://living.scotsman.com/people.cfm?id=1465132006 Lives and Times: Spring-Heeled Jack]", ''[[The Scotsman]]'' 7 October 2006. Excerpted from the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cordingly1&gt;Rupert Mann, "Spring Heeled Jack", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004; {{ISBN|0-19-861411-X}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to much later accounts, in October 1837 a girl by the name of Mary Stevens was walking to [[Lavender Hill]], where she was working as a servant, after visiting her parents in [[Battersea]]. On her way through [[Clapham Common]], a strange figure leapt at her from a dark alley. After immobilising her with a tight grip of his arms, he began to kiss her face, while ripping her clothes and touching her flesh with his claws, which were, according to her deposition, "cold and clammy as those of a corpse". In panic, the girl screamed, making the attacker quickly flee from the scene. The commotion brought several residents who immediately launched a search for the aggressor, but he could not be found.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

The next day, the leaping character is said to have chosen a very different victim near Mary Stevens' home, inaugurating a method that would reappear in later reports: he jumped in the way of a passing [[carriage]], causing the [[coachman]] to lose control, crash, and severely injure himself. Several witnesses claimed that he escaped by jumping over a {{convert|9|ft|abbr=on}} high wall while babbling with a high-pitched, ringing laughter.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Gradually, the news of the strange character spread, and soon the [[mass media|press]] and the public gave him the name "Spring-heeled Jack".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, ''Unexplained!'' mentions{{page needed|date=August 2017}} that the press referred variously to "''Spring-heeled Jack''" or "''Springheel Jack''". Haining, ''The Legend and Bizarre Crimes of Spring Heeled Jack'', asserts that the term ''"springald"'' was rather the origin of the name Spring Heeled Jack, to which it evolved later; alas, there is no proof to support this claim, according to Clark. Dash, op. cit.,&lt;!-- WHICH ONE? --&gt; reveals that there is no contemporary evidence that this term was used in the 1830s, and establishes that the first original name was "''Steel Jack''{{-"}}, a possible reference to his supposed armoured appearance.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Official recognition ===
[[File:Mansion House-Public Session.jpg|thumb|A public session at the Mansion House, London (c. 1840).]] A few months after these first sightings, on 9 January 1838, the [[Lord Mayor of London]], [[John Cowan (sheriff)|Sir John Cowan]], revealed at a public session held in the [[Mansion House, London|Mansion House]] an anonymous complaint that he had received several days earlier, which he had withheld in the hope of obtaining further information. The correspondent, who signed the letter "a resident of [[Peckham]]", wrote:

{{quote|It appears that some individuals (of, as the writer believes, the highest ranks of life) have laid a wager with a mischievous and foolhardy companion, that he durst not take upon himself the task of visiting many of the villages near London in three different disguises—a ghost, a bear, and a [[devil]]; and moreover, that he will not enter a gentleman's gardens for the purpose of alarming the inmates of the house. The wager has, however, been accepted, and the unmanly villain has succeeded in depriving seven ladies of their senses, two of whom are not likely to recover, but to become burdens to their families.

At one house the man rang the bell, and on the servant coming to open door, this worse than brute stood in no less dreadful figure than a spectre clad most perfectly. The consequence was that the poor girl immediately swooned, and has never from that moment been in her senses.

The affair has now been going on for some time, and, strange to say, the papers are still silent on the subject. The writer has reason to believe that they have the whole history at their finger-ends but, through interested motives, are induced to remain silent.&lt;ref&gt;As quoted by Jacqueline Simpson, ''Spring-Heeled Jack'' (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Though the Lord Mayor seemed fairly sceptical, a member of the audience confirmed, "servant girls about [[Kensington]], Hammersmith and [[Ealing]], tell dreadful stories of this ghost or devil". The matter was reported in ''[[The Times]]'' on 9 January, other national papers on 10 January and, on the day after that, the Lord Mayor showed a crowded gathering a pile of letters from various places in and around London complaining of similar "wicked pranks". The quantity of letters that poured into the Mansion House suggests that the stories were widespread in suburban London. One writer said several young women in Hammersmith had been frightened into "dangerous fits" and some "severely wounded by a sort of claws the miscreant wore on his hands". Another correspondent claimed that in [[Stockwell]], [[Brixton]], [[Camberwell]] and [[Vauxhall]] several people had died of fright and others had had fits; meanwhile, another reported that the trickster had been repeatedly seen in [[Lewisham]] and [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

The Lord Mayor himself was in two minds about the affair: he thought "the greatest exaggerations" had been made, and that it was quite impossible "that the ghost performs the feats of a devil upon earth", but on the other hand someone he trusted had told him of a servant girl at [[Forest Hill, London|Forest Hill]] who had been scared into fits by a figure in a bear's skin; he was confident the person or persons involved in this "[[pantomime]] display" would be caught and punished.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Haining, ''The Legend and Bizarre Crimes of Spring Heeled Jack'', based on reports from ''[[The Times]]'' of 10 and 12 January 1838.&lt;/ref&gt; The police were instructed to search for the individual responsible, and rewards were offered.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

A peculiar report from ''The Brighton Gazette'', which appeared in the 14 April 1838 edition of ''The Times'', related how a gardener in Rosehill, Sussex, had been terrified by a creature of unknown nature. ''The Times'' wrote that "Spring-heeled Jack has, it seems, found his way to the Sussex coast", even though the report bore little resemblance to other accounts of Jack. The incident occurred on 13 April, when it appeared to a gardener "in the shape of a bear or some other four-footed animal". Having attracted the gardener's attention by a growl, it then climbed the garden wall and ran along it on all fours, before jumping down and chasing the gardener for some time. After terrifying the gardener, the apparition scaled the wall and made its exit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Times]] |title=The Whitechapel murder |page=7 |date=14 April 1838 |url=http://archive.timesonline.co.uk |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006085903/http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/ |archivedate=6 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Scales and Alsop reports ===
[[File:Spring Heeled Jack-penny dreadful.png|left|thumbnail|Illustration of Spring-heeled Jack, from the 1867 serial ''Spring-heel'd Jack: The Terror of London'']]
Perhaps the best known of the alleged incidents involving Spring-heeled Jack were the attacks on two teenage girls, Lucy Scales and Jane Alsop. The Alsop report was widely covered by the newspapers, including a piece in ''[[The Times]]'',&lt;ref name=oldford&gt;{{cite news | title = The Late Outrage At Old Ford | work = [[The Times]] | date = 2 March 1838 | url = http://archive.timesonline.co.uk }}&lt;/ref&gt; while fewer reports appeared in relation to the attack on Scales. The press coverage of these two attacks helped to raise the profile of Spring-heeled Jack.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

====Alsop case====
Jane Alsop reported that on the night of 19 February 1838, she answered the door of her father's house to a man claiming to be a police officer, who told her to bring a light, claiming "we have caught Spring-heeled Jack here in the lane". She brought the person a candle, and noticed that he wore a large cloak. The moment she had handed him the candle, however, he threw off the cloak and "presented a most hideous and frightful appearance", vomiting blue and white flame from his mouth while his eyes resembled "red balls of fire". Miss Alsop reported that he wore a large helmet and that his clothing, which appeared to be very tight-fitting, resembled white oilskin. Without saying a word he caught hold of her and began tearing her gown with his claws which she was certain were "of some metallic substance". She screamed for help, and managed to get away from him and ran towards the house. He caught her on the steps and tore her neck and arms with his claws. She was rescued by one of her sisters, after which her assailant fled.&lt;ref name=scotsman1/&gt;&lt;ref name=burke&gt;{{cite book | last = Burke | first = Edmund | authorlink = Edmund Burke |author2=Ivison Stevenson  | title = The Annual Register of World Events: A Review of the Year | publisher = Longmans, Green | year = 1839 | location = London | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=sdkHAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=spring-heeled | page = 23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scales case====
Eight days after the attack on Miss Alsop, on 28 February 1838,&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Morning Post]]'' of 7 March 1838, in Mike Dash, 'Spring-heeled Jack', ''Fortean Studies'' 3, p.pp.62–3&lt;/ref&gt; 18-year-old Lucy Scales and her sister were returning home after visiting their brother, a butcher who lived in a respectable part of [[Limehouse]]. Miss Scales stated in her deposition to the police that as she and her sister were passing along Green Dragon Alley, they observed a person standing in an angle of the passage. She was walking in front of her sister at the time, and just as she came up to the person, who was wearing a large cloak, he spurted "a quantity of blue flame" in her face, which deprived her of her sight, and so alarmed her, that she instantly dropped to the ground, and was seized with violent fits which continued for several hours.&lt;ref name="Burke, pp. 26-27"&gt;Burke, [https://books.google.com/books?id=sdkHAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA26&amp;vq=spring-heeled pp. 26–27]&lt;/ref&gt;

Her brother added that on the evening in question, he had heard the loud screams of one of his sisters moments after they had left his house and on running up Green Dragon Alley he found his sister Lucy on the ground in a fit, with her sister attempting to hold and support her. She was taken home, and he then learned from his other sister what had happened. She described Lucy's assailant as being of tall, thin, and gentlemanly appearance, covered in a large cloak, and carrying a small lamp or bull's eye lantern similar to those used by the police. The individual did not speak nor did he try to lay hands on them, but instead walked quickly away. Every effort was made by the police to discover the author of these and similar outrages, and several persons were questioned, but were set free.&lt;ref name="Burke, pp. 26-27"/&gt;

=== The legend spreads ===
''The Times'' reported the alleged attack on Jane Alsop on 2 March 1838 under the heading "The Late Outrage At Old Ford".&lt;ref name=oldford/&gt; This was followed with an account of the trial of one Thomas Millbank, who, immediately after the reported attack on Jane Alsop, had boasted in the Morgan's Arms that he was Spring-heeled Jack. He was arrested and tried at Lambeth Street court. The arresting officer was James Lea, who had earlier arrested William Corder, the [[Red Barn Murder]]er. Millbank had been wearing white [[overall]]s and a [[greatcoat]], which he dropped outside the house, and the candle he dropped was also found. He escaped conviction only because Jane Alsop insisted her attacker had breathed fire, and Millbank admitted he could do no such thing. Most of the other accounts were written long after the date; contemporary newspapers do not mention them.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}
[[File:Jack4.jpg|thumb|Ad for ''Spring Heeled Jack'', a [[penny dreadful]] (1886)]]
After these incidents, Spring-heeled Jack became one of the most popular characters of the period. His alleged exploits were reported in the newspapers and became the subject of several [[penny dreadful]]s and plays performed in the cheap theatres that abounded at the time. The devil was even renamed "Spring-heeled Jack" in some [[Punch and Judy]] shows, as recounted by [[Henry Mayhew]] in his ''[[London Labour and the London Poor]]'':

{{Quote|This here is Satan,-we might say the devil, but that ain't right, and gennelfolks don't like such words. He is now commonly called 'Spring-heeled Jack;' or the 'Rossian Bear,' – that's since the war.|Henry Mayhew|''London Labour and the London Poor'', p. 52&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Mayhew | first = Henry | authorlink = Henry Mayhew | title = London labour and the London poor | publisher = Griffin, Bohn, and Company | year = 1861 | location = London | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fIoBAAAAQAAJ | page = 52 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

But, even as his fame was growing, reports of Spring-heeled Jack's appearances became less frequent if more widespread. In 1843, however, a wave of sightings swept the country again. A report from [[Northamptonshire]] described him as "the very image of the Devil himself, with horns and eyes of flame", and in [[East Anglia]] reports of attacks on drivers of [[mail coach]]es became common. In July 1847 "a Spring-heeled Jack investigation" in Teighnmouth, Devon led to a Captain Finch being convicted of two charges of assault against women during which he is said to have been "disguised in a skin coat, which had the appearance of bullock's hide, skullcap, horns and mask".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article71608928 |title=British And Foreign Gleanings. |newspaper=[[The South Australian]] |location=Adelaide |date=27 July 1847 |accessdate=21 August 2013 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legend was linked with the phenomenon of the "[[Devil's Footprints]]" which appeared in [[Devon]] in February 1855.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

=== The last reports ===
In the beginning of the 1870s, Spring-heeled Jack was reported again in several places distant from each other. In November 1872, the ''[[News of the World]]'' reported that Peckham was "in a state of commotion owing to what is known as the "[[Peckham Ghost]]", a mysterious figure, quite alarming in appearance". The editorial pointed out that it was none other than "Spring-heeled Jack, who terrified a past generation".&lt;ref&gt;News of the World, 17 November 1872, cited in "Fortean Studies volume 3" (1996), pp. 78–79, ed. Steve Moore, John Brown Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; Similar stories were published in ''[[The Illustrated Police News]]''. In April and May 1873, there were numerous sightings in [[Sheffield]] of the "[[Park Ghost]]", which locals also came to identify as Spring-heeled Jack. {{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

====Aldershot====
[[File:North Camp Aldershot 1866.jpg|thumb|left|North Camp in [[Aldershot Garrison|Aldershot]] as it looked in 1866.]]
This news was followed by more reported sightings, until in August 1877 one of the most notable reports about Spring-heeled Jack came from a group of soldiers in [[Aldershot]]'s barracks. This story went as follows: a sentry on duty at the North Camp peered into the darkness, his attention attracted by a peculiar figure "advancing towards him." The soldier issued a challenge, which went unheeded, and the figure came up beside him and delivered several slaps to his face. A guard shot at him, with no visible effect; some sources claim that the soldier may have fired [[blank (cartridge)|blanks]] at him, others that he missed or fired warning shots. The strange figure then disappeared into the surrounding darkness "with astonishing bounds."&lt;ref&gt;"The Aldershott Ghost", The Times, 28 April 1877 (cited in "Fortean Studies volume 3" (1996), pp. 95, ed. Steve Moore, John Brown Publishing)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Our Camp Letter" –  ''Surrey and Hants News &amp; Guildford Times'' –  17 March 1877, section ''Aldershot Gazette''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Elliott O'Donnell]], ''Haunted Britain'' – Consul Books (1963) pg 89&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lord Ernest Hamilton]]'s 1922 memoir ''Forty Years On'' mentions the Aldershot appearances of Spring-heeled Jack; however, he (apparently erroneously) says that they occurred in the winter of 1879 after his regiment, the [[King's Royal Rifle Corps|60th Rifles]], had moved to Aldershot, and that similar appearances had occurred when the regiment was barracked at [[Colchester]] in the winter of 1878. He adds that the panic became so great at Aldershot that sentries were issued ammunition and ordered to shoot "the night terror" on sight, following which the appearances ceased. Hamilton thought that the appearances were actually pranks, carried out by one of his fellow officers, a Lieutenant Alfrey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hamilton | first = Ernest | authorlink = Lord Ernest Hamilton | title = Forty Years On | publisher = Hodder and Stoughton | year = 1922 | pages = 163–164 | url = https://archive.org/details/fortyyearson00hami }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Our Camp Letter" – ''Surrey and Hants News &amp; Guildford Times'' – 14 December 1878, section ''Aldershot Gazette''&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no record of Alfrey ever being court-martialled for the offence.&lt;ref&gt;Judge Advocate General's Office: General Courts Martial charge sheets: 1877–1880 – the National Archives, Kew&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lincolnshire====
In the autumn of 1877, Spring-heeled Jack was reportedly seen at [[Newport Arch]], in [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]], [[Lincolnshire]], wearing a sheep skin. An angry mob supposedly chased him and cornered him, and just as in Aldershot a while before, residents fired at him to no effect. As usual, he was said to have made use of his leaping abilities to lose the crowd and disappear once again.&lt;ref&gt;Illustrated Police News, 3 November 1877, cited in "Fortean Studies volume 3" (1996), pp. 96, ed. Steve Moore, John Brown Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;

====Liverpool====
By the end of the 19th century the reported sightings of Spring-heeled Jack were moving towards the north west of England. Around 1888, in [[Everton, Liverpool|Everton]], north Liverpool, he allegedly appeared on the rooftop of [[Church of Saint Francis Xavier, Liverpool|Saint Francis Xavier's Church]] in Salisbury Street. In 1904 there were reports of appearances in nearby William Henry Street.&lt;ref&gt;News of the World, 25 September 1904, cited in "Fortean Studies volume 3" (1996), pp. 97, ed. Steve Moore, John Brown Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==
No one was ever caught and identified as Spring-heeled Jack; combined with the extraordinary abilities attributed to him and the very long period during which he was reportedly at large, this has led to numerous and varied theories of his nature and identity.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} While several researchers seek a normal explanation for the events, other authors explore the more fantastic details of the story to propose different kinds of [[paranormal]] speculation.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

===Sceptical positions===
Sceptical investigators have dismissed the stories of Spring-heeled Jack as [[mass hysteria]] which developed around various stories of a [[bogeyman]] or devil which have been around for centuries, or from exaggerated urban myths about a man who clambered over rooftops claiming that the Devil was chasing him.&lt;ref&gt;Randles, ''Strange and Unexplained Mysteries of the 20th Century''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marquess of Waterford.jpg|thumb|[[Henry Beresford, 3rd Marquess of Waterford|Henry de La Poer Beresford]], 3rd Marquess of Waterford (1840)]]
Other researchers believe that some individual(s) may have been behind its origins, being followed by imitators later on.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Dash, "Spring Heeled Jack", in ''Fortean Studies'', ed. Steve Moore.&lt;/ref&gt; Spring-heeled Jack was widely considered not to be a supernatural creature, but rather one or more persons with a macabre sense of humour.&lt;ref name=scotsman1/&gt; This idea matches the contents of the letter to the Lord Mayor, which accused a group of young aristocrats as the culprits, after an irresponsible wager.&lt;ref name=scotsman1/&gt; A popular rumour circulating as early as 1840 pointed to an [[Peerage of Ireland|Irish nobleman]], [[Henry Beresford, 3rd Marquess of Waterford|the Marquess of Waterford]], as the main suspect.&lt;ref name=scotsman1/&gt; [[Peter Haining (author)|Haining]] suggested this may have been due to him having previously had bad experiences with women and police officers.&lt;ref&gt;Haining, ''The Legend and Bizarre Crimes of Spring Heeled Jack''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Marquess was frequently in the news in the late 1830s for drunken brawling, brutal jokes and vandalism, and was said to do anything for a bet; his irregular behaviour and his contempt for women earned him the title "the Mad Marquis", and it is also known that he was in the London area by the time the first incidents took place. In 1880 he was named as the perpetrator by [[E. Cobham Brewer]], who said that the Marquess "used to amuse himself by springing on travellers unawares, to frighten them, and from time to time others have followed his silly example."&lt;ref&gt;Jacqueline Simpson, ''Spring-Heeled Jack''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brewer |first=Ebenezer Cobham|editor=Marion Harland|title=The reader's companion: Character sketches of romance, fiction and the drama|url=https://archive.org/stream/charactersketche07brewuoft#page/82/mode/1up|edition=Revised American |volume=VII: Skeggs-Trovatore|year=1896|publisher=Selmar Hess|location=New York|page=30|chapter=Spring-Heeled Jack}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1842, the Marquess married and settled in Curraghmore House, [[County Waterford]], and reportedly led an exemplary life until he died in a riding accident in 1859.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Sceptical investigators have asserted that the story of Spring-heeled Jack was exaggerated and altered through mass hysteria, a process in which many sociological issues may have contributed. These include unsupported rumours, superstition, [[oral tradition]], [[sensationalism|sensationalist]] publications, and a folklore rich in tales of [[fairy|fairies]] and strange roguish creatures. Gossip of alleged leaping and fire-spitting powers, his alleged extraordinary features and his reputed skill in evading apprehension captured the mind of the superstitious public—increasingly so with the passing of time, which gave the impression that Spring-heeled Jack had suffered no effects from ageing. As a result, a whole urban legend was built around the character, being reflected by contemporary publications, which in turn fuelled this popular perception.&lt;ref&gt;Massimo Polidoro, "[http://www.csicop.org/si/show/return_of_spring-heeled_jack/ Notes on a Strange World: Return of Spring-Heeled Jack]", ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'', July. Accessed on 24 March 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paranormal conjectures===
A variety of wildly speculative paranormal explanations have been proposed to explain the origin of Spring-heeled Jack, including that he was an [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] entity with a non-human appearance and features (e.g., [[retroreflector|retro-reflective]] red eyes, or [[phosphorus]] breath) and a [[superhuman]] agility deriving from life on a high-gravity world, with his jumping ability and strange behaviour,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Charles Berlitz]]'s World of Strange Phenomena''.&lt;/ref&gt; and that he was a [[demon]], accidentally or purposefully summoned into this world by practitioners of the [[occult]], or who made himself manifest simply to create spiritual turmoil.&lt;ref&gt;Supporters of this theory include [[John Keel]], author of ''[[The Mothman Prophecies]]'', and [[Jacques Vallée]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Fort|Fortean]] authors, particularly [[Loren Coleman]]&lt;ref&gt;Mysterious America&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jerome Clark]],&lt;ref&gt;Unexplained!&lt;/ref&gt; list "Spring-heeled Jack" in a category named "phantom attackers", with another well-known example being the "[[Mad Gasser of Mattoon]]". Typical "phantom attackers" appear to be human, and may be perceived as prosaic criminals, but may display extraordinary abilities (as in Spring-heeled Jack's jumps, which, it is widely noted, would break the ankles of a human who replicated them) and/or cannot be caught by authorities. Victims commonly experience the "attack" in their bedrooms, homes or other seemingly secure enclosures. They may report being pinned or paralysed, or on the other hand describe a "siege" in which they fought off a persistent intruder or intruders. Many reports can readily be explained psychologically, most notably as the [[sleep paralysis|"Old Hag" phenomenon]], recorded in folklore and recognised by psychologists as a form of hallucination. In the most problematic cases, an "attack" is witnessed by several people and substantiated by some physical evidence, but the attacker cannot be verified to exist.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

===Through 1950===
The vast urban legend built around Spring-heeled Jack influenced many aspects of Victorian life, especially in contemporary [[popular culture]]. For decades, especially in London, his name was equated with the [[bogeyman]], as a means of scaring children into behaving by telling them if they were not good, Spring-heeled Jack would leap up and peer in at them through their bedroom windows, by night.

However, it was in fictional entertainment where the legend of Spring-heeled Jack exerted the most extensive influence, owing to his allegedly extraordinary nature. Three pamphlet publications, purportedly based on the real events, appeared almost immediately, during January and February, 1838. They were not advertised as fiction, though they likely were at least partly so. The only known copies were reported to have perished when the [[British Library]] was hit during [[The Blitz]], but their catalog still lists the first one.

The most notable fictional Spring-heeled Jacks of the 19th and early 20th centuries were:
* [[John Thomas Haines]]' play ''Spring-Heeled Jack, the Terror of London'' (1840), which shows him as a [[Outlaw|brigand]] who attacks women because his own sweetheart betrayed him.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}
* Frederick Hazleton's play, ''Spring-Heel'd Jack: or, The Felon's Wrongs'' (1863).
* [[Colin Henry Hazlewood]]'s [[penny dreadful]], ''Spring-heel'd Jack, The Terror of London: A Romance of the Nineteenth Century'' (1867). Hazlewood's treatment of the material is significant in that while it alludes to the supernatural aspects of the legend, the main character is in fact a costumed figure wearing spring-boots. According to academic, Karl Bell, it was this non-supernatural interpretation which became the basis for all the later serials.&lt;ref&gt;[Karl Bell, ''The Legend of Spring-Heeled Jack: Victorian Urban Folklore and Popular Cultures'', p. 178 (Boydell &amp; Brewer, Boydell Press, 2012).]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Spring-heel'd Jack: The Terror of London'', a 40-part penny dreadful published by the Newsagents Publishing Company in 1863, then reprinted in 1867. The only known almost complete version of this penny dreadful is in the British Library, and even this is missing part 14.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}
* "Spring-heeled Jack: The Terror of London", a serial published in Charles Fox's paper,''The Boys' Standard'', 1st Series, vol. 5, April, 1878. Written either by veteran author of dreadfuls [[George Augustus Henry Sala]] or by Alfred Burrage (as "Charlton Lea"). Reprinted in "The Boy's Standard" in 1885.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}
* ''Spring-Heel Jack; or, The Masked Mystery of the Tower'', appearing in ''Beadle's New York Dime Library #332'', 4 March 1885, and written by Col. [[Colonel Thomas Hoyer Monstery|Thomas Monstery]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}
* "Spring-Heeled Jack, The Terror of London", ''The Boys' Monster Weekly'', 1899. A reprint of ''The Boy's Standard'' version.
* "Spring-Heeled Jack", also known as the "Spring-Heeled Jack Library." 1904. Twelve weekly issues with color covers, published by the Aldine Publishing Co.; Written by Alfred Burrage under the name, Charlton Lea.&lt;ref&gt;Jess Nevins, ''The Encyclopaedia of Fantastic Victoriana'' (2005), and Jacqueline Simpson, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; The first issue of the series is available as a facsimile edition.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Spring-Heeled-Jack-Fiend-Penny-Dreadful/dp/1546689338&lt;/ref&gt;
* Director [[Paul Leni]]'s ''[[Waxworks (film)|Das Wachsfigurenkabinett]]'' (1924) presents the character as an amalgam with [[Jack the Ripper]].
* A play based on the Aldine penny dreadfuls entitled ''Spring-Heeled Jack, or the Terror of London'' (1928), by [[surrealism|surrealist]] [[Switzerland|Swiss]] author [[Maurice Sandoz]]. It was adapted into a film, ''[[The Curse of the Wraydons]]'' (1946).{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

==In other countries==
A similar figure known as [[Pérák, the Spring Man of Prague]] was reported to have been seen in [[Czechoslovakia]] around 1939–1945. As writers such as [[Mike Dash]] have shown, the elusiveness and supernatural leaping abilities attributed to Pérák bear a close resemblance to those exhibited by Spring-heeled Jack, and distinct parallels can be drawn between the two entities.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The stories of Pérák provide a useful example of how the traits of Spring-heeled Jack have a broad cultural resonance in urban folklore. Pérák, like Spring-heeled Jack, went on to become a folklore hero, even starring in several animated superhero cartoons, fighting the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]], the earliest of which is [[Jiří Trnka]]'s 1946 film ''Pérák a SS'' or ''[[Springman and the SS]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/downloads/bfi-press-release-jiri-trnka-at-bfi-southbank-in-april-2012-03-06.pdf|title="Jiří Trnka At BFI Southbank in April 2012", (Trnka Shorts for Adults) BFI press release March 2012.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Akademi Fantasia'' ===
{{main|Akademi Fantasia, Season 6}}
Stacy competed against thirteen other contestants to win Season 6 of ''Akademi Fantasia''. The judging panel often harbours her performances with praises every week for being consistent, which implied her as the front-runner of the season. Ramli M.S., the academy principal of AF6 complimented Stacy as a loyal student who is very serious in learning something new. According to him, Stacy is always focus during each lesson and applied all the lessons that she learned during her performances on stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mstar.com.my/artikel/?file=/2008/3/31/HIBURAN/m_Aduh/AF6_Stacy_paling_menyerlah|title=AF6: Stacy paling menyerlah|author=Siti Azira Abd Aziz|language=Malay|publisher=mStar|date=31 March 2008|accessdate=18 March 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318054154/http://www.mstar.com.my/artikel/?file=%2F2008%2F3%2F31%2FHIBURAN%2Fm_Aduh%2FAF6_Stacy_paling_menyerlah|archivedate=18 March 2017|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the competition, Stacy remained at top three when the voting session was closed at the end of every concert, with four collective highest votes.

=== 2008–2010: ''Aku Stacy'' ===
Stacy's coronation song "[[Aku Stacy (song)|Aku Stacy]]" was released immediately after her win and it became a huge success. The song quickly became her first number one single in Carta [[Era FM|Era]] for two weeks, as well as topping Carta 30 Era at number one. It stayed in the chart for 22 weeks, making its own history as one of the songs that stayed in the chart for a long period of time. The single also entered Muzik FM chart at number 9. The song slowly climbed to top the chart at No. 1, making it as Stacy's first No. 1 single in the chart. In Hot FM 30, the song only managed to peak at number 14 before finally dropping out from the chart. In Muzik Muzik, it peaked at No. 3.

Following the successful release of her first single, Stacy's own show "Aku Stacy" was launched in [[Astro Ria]]. The show featured her journey in the [[entertainment industry]] after her win. In the meantime, her first compilation live album, ''The Best of Stacy'' was released in September 2008 which featured all of her ten performances in Akademi Fantasia, excluding the fifth concert. The album was well-received as it sold thousand copies in the first week.

In December 2008, the song "Aku Stacy" made it to the final round of [[Anugerah Juara Lagu]], an annual award show in Malaysia to honour the best Malay song every year, a rare accomplishment made by newcomers in the industry.Despite her busy schedules to be fully prepared for [[Anugerah Juara Lagu]], Stacy's second single, "[[Gagap]]", premiered in the season finale of [[:ms:Sehati Berdansa|Sehati Berdansa]]. The song is commercially successful as it becomes her second single to reach Top 5 in most charts. In Carta [[Era FM|Era]], the single has peaked at number 2 and was held off by [[Mohd Aizam Mat Saman|Adam]]'s "Benar-Benar". In Carta Hot Fm, the song debuted at number 17 and went to peak at number 5. The song also entered Carta Muzik FM at number 10, and eventually peaked at number 4. In Carta Muzik Muzik, the second peaked at number 2, being held of by Adam's "Benar-Benar". Along with Nubhan, fellow student of AF6, Stacy was listed fourth in Murai's list of "Most Outstanding Newcomers of 2008".

In February 2009, Stacy was short-listed as the top 5 finalist for three major categories in [[Anugerah Bintang Popular]], namely Most Popular Artiste, Most Popular Female New Artist, as well as Most Popular Female Singer,&lt;ref name="albums"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pressreader.com/malaysia/utusan-borneo-sarawak/20150902/282690455955245|title=Stacy bakal beraksi di MTV World Stage 2015|language=Malay|work=[[Utusan Borneo]]|publisher=[[PressReader]]|date=2 September 2015|accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; where she was voted as the Most Popular Female New Artist. Stacy was also given a certificate of recognition by Sabah's Ministry of Sport and Youth (KBS) for her on-going efforts to improve herself as a newcomer in entertainment industry. She was also recognised as Sabah's youth icon and idol in the entertainment industry.

Her debut album, ''[[Aku Stacy (album)|Aku Stacy]]'', was released on 9 March 2009.&lt;ref name="albums"/&gt; She worked closely with notable local composers such as Ajai, Adi Mok as well as Edry [[KRU]] and Kieran Kuek. Just like the previous winners of [[Akademi Fantasia]], she gets the opportunity to launch her album in her own town which takes place in Kota Kinabalu.

Stacy's third single, "[[Pakai Buang]]" was released on 9 May 2009. The song slowly climbs national charts and so far is peaking at No. 5 in Carta Muzik FM.

The video was released in July 2012.

=== 2014–2016: [[Number 1 (Stacy album)|#1]] ===
The success of her final single from Stay-C, "Bosan" is proven when the song managed to compete in the grand final of AJL28 in January 2014. It was her fifth time competing in the final round of the most prestigious musical event in Malaysia. Her performance was received with mixed reviews by critics.&lt;ref name="ajl28"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ww1.utusan.com.my/utusan/Hiburan/20140129/hi_06/AJL28-memuaskan|title=AJL28 memuaskan|author=Ifqdar Rahman|language=Malay|publisher=[[Utusan Malaysia]]|date=29 January 2014|accessdate=18 March 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318025626/http://ww1.utusan.com.my/utusan/Hiburan/20140129/hi_06/AJL28-memuaskan|archivedate=18 March 2017|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stacy's third album, ''[[Number 1 (Stacy album)|#1]]'' was released on 17 May 2014 at [[Zouk (club)|Zouk]] [[Kuala Lumpur|KL]].&lt;ref name="albums"/&gt; The album contains 10 songs, including the single, "Gilalah" and the collaboration with Indonesian boyband, [[SM*SH]], "Hello". The album has 2 CDs, whereby CD2 features remix version of the songs. Besides Malaysia, the album was released in Singapore, [[Indonesia]] and [[Brunei]]. The album proved Stacy's artistry as she was involved directly in the making of the album from the beginning to the end.

Stacy proved herself once again as a consistent artist when her first single "Gilalah" made it to the final of [[:ms:Anugerah Juara Lagu ke-29|AJL29]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bharian.com.my/node/20385|title=Saingan sengit 12 finalis AJL 29|author=Zaidi Mohamad|language=Malay|publisher=[[Berita Harian]]|date=29 November 2014|accessdate=18 March 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318034417/http://www.bharian.com.my/node/20385|archivedate=18 March 2017|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Gilalah" was a commercial success, having been played on the mainstream radios such as [[Era FM|ERA.fm]] and Hot.fm every so often. It was the first song where Stacy was involved in making the lyrics totally. The video of the single was directed by herself and first showed exclusively on [[:ms:MeleTOP|MeleTop]].

In September 2014, Stacy released the video of "Patah" a promotional single from the album. Despite the solid vocal performance, the song failed to crack the radio charts.

Stacy made a triumphant comeback to the music and radio charts with her third single, "Not For Sale" featuring [[Malaysians|Malaysian]] famous rapper [[:ms:Altimet|Altimet]], which charted highly on most radio charts, as well as topping the Muzik-Muzik charts. "Not For Sale" also became a soundtrack for Malay popular drama "Tuan Anas Mikael". The accompanying music video was released on 4 August 2015. The song also brought Stacy to her 7th AJL appearance in January 2016.&lt;ref name="ajl28"/&gt; Although she was sick a day before her performance, she wowed the audiences with her vocals and moves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bharian.com.my/node/117252|title=Stacy abai kesakitan demi AJL30|author=Syarrizuan Abdul Rashid|language=Malay|publisher=Berita Harian|date=23 January 2016|accessdate=18 March 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318025142/http://www.bharian.com.my/node/117252|archivedate=18 March 2017|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to her family's financial problem, she had no choice but to drop out of school at the age of 16 when she was in Secondary 4.&lt;ref name="Stacy bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://intrend.astroawani.com/detail/eksklusif-tahun-pertama-ummu-syaikhah-stacy-menyambut-ramadan-sebagai-muslimah-dan-isteri-108023|title=[EKSKLUSIF] Tahun Pertama Ummu Syaikhah Stacy Menyambut Ramadan Sebagai Muslimah dan Isteri|author=Rosie Haslinda Nasir|language=Malay|publisher=[[Astro Awani]]|date=13 June 2016|accessdate=16 March 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318052809/http://intrend.astroawani.com/detail/eksklusif-tahun-pertama-ummu-syaikhah-stacy-menyambut-ramadan-sebagai-muslimah-dan-isteri-108023|archivedate=18 March 2017|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; To support her family, she became a singer in local clubs.

Prior to her audition for AF6, Stacy tried out for other notable singing reality shows, such as [[One in a Million (Malaysian TV series)|One in a Million 1]], and also [[Gang Starz]] in which she teamed up with her brother, Camellus De'lleli Anam, to form a group named E-voke. However, she only made it to the semi-finals before they were booted out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mstar.com.my/artikel/?file=/2007/5/28/HIBURAN/m_Aduh/Gang_Starz_Colabr8_kecewa_keputusan_TV3|title=Gang Starz: Colabr8 kecewa keputusan TV3|author=Wahida Asrani|language=Malay|publisher=mStar|date=28 May 2007|accessdate=16 March 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318053252/http://www.mstar.com.my/artikel/?file=%2F2007%2F5%2F28%2FHIBURAN%2Fm_Aduh%2FGang_Starz_Colabr8_kecewa_keputusan_TV3|archivedate=18 March 2017|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her decision to audition for AF6 was derived from her mother's suggestion as soon as she turned 18.

Stacy was also given a full scholarship to continue her studies in [[Limkokwing University Of Creative Technology]]. She studied in diploma of music and art, and began her first semester in February 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.limkokwing.net/media/news/af6_winner_stacy_receives_scholarship_to_study_at_limkokwing_music_academy/|title=AF6 winner Stacy receives scholarship to study at Limkokwing music academy|work=[[Utusan Malaysia]]|publisher=[[Limkokwing University of Creative Technology]]|date=23 July 2008|accessdate=16 March 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111072437/http://www.limkokwing.net/media/news/af6_winner_stacy_receives_scholarship_to_study_at_limkokwing_music_academy/|archivedate=11 January 2010|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and career ==

=== 1948–1971: Early life and career beginnings ===
Stephanie "Stevie" Nicks was born at Good Samaritan Hospital in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], to Jess Nicks (July 2, 1925 – August 10, 2005), former president of [[Armour and Company|Greyhound's Armour-Dial]],&lt;ref&gt;Stevie Nicks, The Source, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; and Barbara Nicks (November 12, 1927 – December 29, 2011), a homemaker. Nicks's grandfather, Aaron Jess "A.J." Nicks, Sr. (May 18, 1892 – August 1, 1974), a struggling [[country music]] singer, taught Nicks to sing [[duet]]s with him by the time she was four years old. Nicks's mother was so protective that she kept her at home "more than most people" and during that time fostered in her daughter a love of fairy tales.&lt;ref name="nicksfix1980"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nicksfix.com/rs_issue310.htm |title=Five Not So Easy Pieces |work=Rolling Stone&amp;nbsp;– Issue 310 |author=Daisann McLane |year=1980 |accessdate=June 1, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080116203855/http://www.nicksfix.com/rs_issue310.htm |archivedate=January 16, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nicksfix1997"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nicksfix.com/azrepub9.htm |title=Oh, Mother!&amp;nbsp;– Fleetwood Mac's Stevie, 49, still Barbara's little girl |publisher=Arizona Republic |author=Randy Cordova |date=October 21, 1997 |accessdate=June 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The infant Stephanie could pronounce her own name only as "tee-dee", which led to her nickname of "Stevie".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inherownwords.com/family.htm |title=Stevie Nicks on her Family |publisher=inherownwords.com |accessdate=June 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Her father's frequent relocation as a food business executive had the family living in Phoenix, Albuquerque, El Paso, Salt Lake City, Los Angeles, and San Francisco during Nicks's youth. With the [[Goya guitar]] that she received for her 16th birthday, Nicks wrote her first song, "I've Loved and I've Lost, and I'm Sad But Not Blue". She spent her adolescence playing records constantly, and lived in her "own little musical world."&lt;ref name="nicksfix1980" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nicksfix1997" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mike-ragogna/emin-your-dreamsem-docume_b_1937997.html |title=In Your Dreams Documentary Premieres at Hampton's: Chatting With Stevie Nicks |work=The Huffington Post |author=Mike Ragogna |year=2012 |accessdate=July 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While attending [[Arcadia High School (California)|Arcadia High School]] in Arcadia, California,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stevie Nicks Story pg2 - Arcadia High School ROCK Legends|url=http://www.arcadiaapaches.com/memories/rock_history/stevie_nicks_story2.htm|website=Arcadiaapaches.com|accessdate=November 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; she joined her first band, the Changing Times, a [[folk rock]] group focused on vocal harmonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7qT3AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT132 |page=32 |title=Play On: Now, Then and Fleetwood Mac |last=Fleetwood |first=Mick |authorlink=Mick Fleetwood |last2=Bozza |first2=Anthony |publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton |year=2014 |isbn=9781444753264 |quote=She briefly had a band called Changing Times, but her musical journey did not really begin until the family moved, yet again, to San Francisco.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicks first met her future musical and romantic partner, Lindsey Buckingham, during her senior year at [[Menlo-Atherton High School]].&lt;ref&gt;MTV.com: Stevie Nicks.&lt;/ref&gt; When she saw Buckingham playing "[[California Dreamin']]" at Young Life club, she joined him in harmony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nicksfix.com/qmagazine_may2001.htm |title=Queen of the Stoned Age |work=Q |date=May 2001 |accessdate=June 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She later recalled, "I was a senior in high school and Lindsey was a junior. And we went to a Young Life meeting – which was a religious meeting that simply got you out of the house on Wednesday nights – and um, he was there and I was there and we sat down and played ''California Dreaming''. I thought he was a darling. I didn't see him again for two years and he called me up and asked if I wanted to be in a band... And so, I was in this band with him for three and a half years – a band called Fritz."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inherownwords.com/lindsey.htm|title=Stevie Nicks on Lindsey Buckingham 1|website=Inherownwords.com|access-date=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buckingham was in a [[psychedelic rock]] band named Fritz, but two of its musicians were leaving for college. He asked Nicks in mid 1967 to replace the lead singer, a guitarist named Jody Moreing. For the next three years, Fritz was composed of Nicks on lead vocals, Buckingham on bass and vocals, Brian Kane on lead guitar, Javier Pacheco on keyboards, and Bob Aguirre on drums. Pacheco was the main songwriter in the group, with a psychedelic bent, but Nicks's own compositions brought a [[country rock]] flair to the group. Fritz became popular as a live act when it opened for both [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[Janis Joplin]] from 1968 until 1970. Nicks credits each of those acts as having inspired her own stage intensity and performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://fleetwoodmac.net/penguin/qa/javierpacheco_qa1.htm |title=Javier Pacheco Question and Answer Session |publisher=fleetwoodmac.net |date=July 5–24, 1999 |accessdate=June 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Nicks and Buckingham attended [[San Jose State University]], where Nicks majored in [[Communication studies|speech communication]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fleetwoodmac.net/penguin/stevie.htm |title=Stevie Nicks Biography |publisher=fleetwoodmac.net |accessdate=June 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and planned to become an English teacher.&lt;ref name="ask"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rockalittle.com/askstevie.htm|work=Rock A Little|title=Stevie Nicks – Ask Stevie|accessdate= February 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicks dropped out of college the semester before graduation.&lt;ref name="ask" /&gt;

=== 1972–1974: ''Buckingham Nicks'' ===
After Fritz disbanded in 1972, Nicks and Buckingham continued to write as a duo, recording demonstration tapes at night in [[Daly City, California|Daly City]] on a one-inch, four-track [[Ampex]] tape machine Buckingham kept at the coffee-roasting plant belonging to his father, Morris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nicksfix.com/rs103097.htm |title=Back on the Chain Gang |work=Rolling Stone |author=Fred Schruers |date=October 30, 1997 |accessdate=June 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.mixonline.com/news/profiles/music-lindsey-buckingham-two-worlds/366253 |title=Music: Lindsey Buckingham in Two Worlds |last=Jackson |first=Blair |date=February 1, 2011 |work=[[Mix (magazine)|Mix]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; They then secured a deal with [[Polydor Records]], which used tracks from their demo tapes to release the album ''[[Buckingham Nicks]]'' in 1973. The album was not a commercial success, despite the live shows that Nicks and Buckingham performed together to support it, and Polydor dropped the pair from the label. To support herself and Buckingham, who wrote music while recovering from [[Infectious mononucleosis|mononucleosis]], Nicks worked a variety of jobs, which included waiting tables and a stint cleaning engineer/producer [[Keith Olsen]]'s house, where Nicks and Buckingham lived for a time before moving in with [[Richard Dashut]].&lt;ref name="nicksfix. com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nicksfix.com/behind_the_music.htm |title=Stevie Nicks&amp;nbsp;– Behind the Music |publisher=nicksfix.com |accessdate=June 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicks says that she first used cocaine during this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=132659&amp;page=1 |title=Stevie Nicks in Her Own Words |publisher=ABC News |author=Cynthia McFadden |date=September 7, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110130092902/http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=132659&amp;page=1 |archivedate=January 30, 2011 |accessdate=September 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "We were told that it was recreational and that it was not dangerous," Nicks recalled to [[Chris Isaak]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Chris Isaak, Stevie Nicks |date=March 5, 2009 |title=The Chris Isaak Hour |medium=Television |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR0--gXpJEU |access-date=July 26, 2017|time=0:37 |publisher=[[The Biography Channel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicks and Buckingham moved in with Dashut in 1972. While there, Buckingham landed a guitar-playing gig with the [[Everly Brothers]] and toured with them while Nicks stayed behind working on songs. During this time, Nicks wrote "[[Rhiannon (song)|Rhiannon]]" after seeing the name in the novel ''Triad'' by Mary Leader. She also wrote "[[Landslide (Fleetwood Mac song)|Landslide]]", inspired by the scenery of Aspen, and her inner turmoil over her decision to pursue music and her relationship with Buckingham:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inherownwords.com/landslide.htm |title=Stevie Nicks on 'Landslide' |publisher=inherownwords.com |accessdate=June 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://performingsongwriter.com/stevie-nicks-landslide/ |title=Stevie Nicks Tells the Story Behind 'Landslide' |publisher=performingsongwriter.com |accessdate=February 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"I realized then that everything could tumble, and when you're in Colorado, and you're surrounded by these incredible mountains, you think 'avalanche'. It meant the whole world could tumble around us and the landslide would bring you down."&lt;ref&gt;Stevie Nicks, In the Studio with Red Beard, May 1992&lt;/ref&gt; "Everybody seems to think that I wrote this song about them... and my dad, my dad did have something to do with it, but he absolutely thinks that he was the whole complete reason it was ever written. I guess it was about September 1974, I was home at my dad and mom's house in Phoenix, and my father said, 'You know, I think that maybe... you really put a lot of time into this [her singing career], maybe you should give this six more months, and if you want to go back to school, we'll pay for it&amp;nbsp;... Lindsey and I went up to Aspen, and we went to somebody's incredible house, and they had a piano, and I had my guitar with me, and I went into their living room, looking out over the incredible, like, Aspen sky way, and I wrote "Landslide"... three months later, Mick Fleetwood called."&lt;ref&gt;Stevie Nicks, VH1 Storytellers, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicks and Buckingham joined Fleetwood Mac in January 1975, six weeks after Keith Olsen played their track "Frozen Love" for drummer [[Mick Fleetwood]], who had come to [[Sound City Studios|Sound City]] in California in search of a studio to record Fleetwood Mac's next album.  Fleetwood remembered Buckingham's guitar work when guitarist [[Bob Welch (musician)|Bob Welch]] departed to pursue a solo career. On December 31, 1974, Fleetwood called Buckingham to ask him to replace Welch as guitarist, but Buckingham insisted that  Nicks and he were "a package deal." A few days later, Nicks and Buckingham discussed the offer over dinner with Fleetwood and the McVies, and the feeling was mutual that incorporating the Buckingham–Nicks pair would improve Fleetwood Mac, making the British band into an Anglo-American one. The first rehearsals confirmed this feeling, with the harmonies of the newcomers adding a pop accessibility to the hard rock. Despite this development, the duo of Buckingham-Nicks was called to perform three sold-out dates in [[Birmingham, Alabama]] – the one area in which their album had seen success. During these final performances as Buckingham-Nicks, Nicks and Buckingham told their fans that they had just joined Fleetwood Mac.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SW31aVVDc_AC&amp;pg=PA81 |pages=80–81 |last=Furman |first=Leah |title=Rumours Exposed: The Unauthorized Biography of Fleetwood Mac |publisher=Citadel Press |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-8065-2472-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, the band achieved worldwide success with the album ''[[Fleetwood Mac (1975 album)|Fleetwood Mac]]''. Nicks's "[[Rhiannon (song)|Rhiannon]]", which appeared on the album, was eventually voted as one of [[The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]] by ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-20110407 |title=500 Greatest Songs of All Time |work=Rolling Stone |accessdate=September 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her live performances of the song throughout the decade began to take on a theatrical intensity not present on the album's single. The song built to a climax in which Nicks's vocals were so impassioned that Mick Fleetwood declared, "her 'Rhiannon' in those days was like an exorcism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rockalittle.com/behind_the_music.htm |title=Stevie Nicks&amp;nbsp;– Behind the Music |accessdate=September 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also included on the album was "[[Landslide (Fleetwood Mac song)|Landslide]]", which achieved over three million airplays and spawned multiple cover versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/20031104_stevie_nicks_wins_in_a_landslide_at_bmi_country_awards_jeffrey |title=Stevie Nicks Wins in a 'Landslide' at BMI Country Awards; Steele Named Songwriter of the Year |date=November 3, 2002 |accessdate=September 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1975, Nicks worked with clothing designer Margi Kent to develop Nicks's unique onstage look, with costumes that featured flowing skirts, shawls, and platform boots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nicksfix.com/latimes8.htm |title=Airy Godmother |work=Los Angeles Times |author=Booth Moore |date=October 23, 1997 |accessdate=June 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the success of ''Fleetwood Mac'', increasing tension between Nicks and Buckingham began to take its toll on their creativity, and Nicks ended the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nicksfix.com/interview_chum_may6_2001.htm |title=Stevie Nicks Interview |publisher=CHUM Radio in Toronto |author=Marilyn Dennis |date=May 6, 2001 |accessdate=June 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inherownwords.com/lindsey2.htm |title=Stevie Nicks on Lindsey Buckingham |publisher=inherownwords.com |accessdate=June 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fleetwood Mac began recording their follow-up album, ''Rumours'', in early 1976 and continued until late in the year. Also, Nicks and Buckingham sang back-up on [[Warren Zevon]]'s self-titled second album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timepieces.nl/album/7540/rumours |title=Fleetwood Mac&amp;nbsp;– Rumours |publisher=timepieces.nl |accessdate=June 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rooksby |first=Rikky |url=https://books.google.com/?id=YR2oy8rhUTcC&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;dq=rikky%20rooksby%20fleetwood%20mac&amp;pg=PA59#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Fleetwood Mac: The Complete Guide to their Music |accessdate=June 2, 2010 |edition=2 |year=2004 |publisher=Omnibus Press |isbn=1-84449-427-6 |page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Nicks's contributions to ''Rumours'' was "[[Dreams (Fleetwood Mac song)|Dreams]]", which became the band's only [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number-one hit single to date. Nicks had also written and recorded the song "[[Silver Springs (song)|Silver Springs]]", but it was ultimately not included on the album because the early versions of the song ran too long, the album was getting to be longer than the producer's target of 22 minutes per side, and the band was also concerned that the album had too many slow songs. Instead, the shorter and faster Nicks-penned tune "I Don't Want to Know" was recorded in its place. Studio engineer and co-producer [[Ken Caillat]] said that Nicks was very unhappy to find that the band had decided against her song "Silver Springs", which he said was beautifully crafted, and carried some of the band's best guitar work.&lt;ref name=Caillat&gt;{{cite book |last1=Caillat |first1=Ken |last2=Stiefel |first2=Steve |title=Making Rumours the inside story of the classic Fleetwood Mac album |date=2012 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |location=Hoboken, N.J. |isbn=978-1-118-28286-1 |pages=292–294 |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/making-rumours-the-inside-story-of-the-classic-fleetwood-mac-album/oclc/775898199 |accessdate=September 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being devastated by the bad news,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nicksfix.com/offtherecord.htm |title=Stevie Nicks Interview&amp;nbsp;– Off The Record |publisher=nicksfix.com |accessdate=June 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicks quickly laid down her vocal tracks for "I Don't Want to Know".&lt;ref name=Caillat /&gt; Nicks's song "Silver Springs" was written about her relationship with Buckingham, and it was released as a B-side of the "[[Go Your Own Way]]" single—Buckingham's song about Nicks. Copies of the single eventually became collectors' items among fans of Fleetwood Mac. "Silver Springs" was included on the four-disc Fleetwood Mac retrospective ''[[25 Years&amp;nbsp;– The Chain]]'' in 1992.&lt;ref name=Furman2003&gt;Furman 2003. [https://books.google.com/books?id=SW31aVVDc_AC&amp;pg=PA203 page 203]&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1977, after a New Zealand concert for the ''Rumours'' tour, Nicks and Fleetwood, who was married to [[Jenny Boyd]], secretly began an affair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nicksfix.com/rs103097.htm |title=Back on the Chain Gang |work=Rolling Stone |author=Fred Schruers |date=October 30, 1997 |accessdate=June 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fleetwoodmac-uk.com/timeline/timeline1970s.html |title=Fleetwood Mac Timeline for the 1970s |publisher=fleetwoodmac-uk.com |accessdate=June 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair mutually decided to end the affair. "Never in a million years could you have told me that would happen," Nicks has stated. "Everybody was angry, because Mick was married to a wonderful girl and had two wonderful children. I was horrified. I loved these people. I loved his family. So it couldn't possibly work out. And it didn't. I just couldn't."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bla.fleetwoodmac.net/index_vp.php?id=208&amp;c=18 |title=UnCut Magazine&amp;nbsp;– Five Go Mad |accessdate=October 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has also stated that had the affair progressed, it "would have been the end of Fleetwood Mac".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fleetwoodmac-uk.com/articles/FMart128.html |title=Fleetwood Mac&amp;nbsp;– The Rumour Mill, Classic Rock, June 2003 |publisher=Google |date=February 15, 2004 |accessdate=January 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, in October 1978, Mick Fleetwood left his wife for Nicks's best friend Sara Recor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nicksfix.com/article_mojo_dec2003.htm |title=Take it to the Limit |work=Mojo |author=Phil Sutcliffe |date=December 2003 |accessdate=June 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1978–1982: ''Tusk'', ''Bella Donna'', and ''Mirage'' ===
[[File:Fleetwood Mac - Stevie Nicks (1980).png|thumb|upright|Nicks performing in 1980]]
After the success of the ''Rumours'' album and tour in 1977 to 1978, Fleetwood Mac began recording their third album with Buckingham and Nicks, ''[[Tusk (album)|Tusk]]'', in the spring of 1978. That year, Nicks sang back-up on virtually every track of ''Not Shy'', recorded by musician [[Walter Egan]], a friend of both Nicks and Buckingham. One track, "[[Magnet and Steel]]", inspired by Nicks, prominently featured her on back-up vocals and became a hit single on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart during the summer of 1978.&lt;ref name="FMnet_PenguinQ&amp;A_2"&gt;{{cite web

By 1978, Nicks had amassed a large backlog of songs dating back to her Buckingham Nicks days that she had been unable to record and release with Fleetwood Mac because of the constraint of having to accommodate three songwriters on each album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nicksfix.com/behind_the_music.htm |title=Stevie Nicks&amp;nbsp;– Behind the Music |accessdate=June 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicks wrote and recorded demos for a solo project during ''Tusk'' sessions in 1979 and the ''Tusk'' world tour of 1979–80.&lt;ref name="nicksfix1980"/&gt; Nicks, Danny Goldberg, and Paul Fishkin founded [[Modern Records (1980)|Modern Records]] to record and release Nicks's material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=pzAdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0p4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5482%2C3389480 |title=The Tuscaloosa News&amp;nbsp;– Google News Archive Search |publisher=Google News |accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicks recorded the hit duets "[[Whenever I Call You Friend]]" with [[Kenny Loggins]] in 1978,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rockalittle.com/hightimes3-82.htm |title=High Times Magazine |publisher=Rockalittle.com |accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[Gold (John Stewart song)|Gold]]" with [[John Stewart (musician)|John Stewart]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bigozine2.com/roio/?p=1768 |title=roio |publisher=Bigozine2.com |accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fleetwood Mac's ''Tusk'' was released on October 19, 1979. During 1981, Nicks made occasional guest appearances with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers on their ''Hard Promises'' tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/01/arts/pop-tom-petty-and-heartbreakers-in-jersey.html |title=Pop: Tom Petty and Heartbreakers in Jersey |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=October 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inherownwords.com/journal.htm |title=Stevie Nicks on her Journal, Prose &amp; Poetry |publisher=Inherownwords.com |accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicks' first solo album, ''[[Bella Donna (album)|Bella Donna]]'', was released on July 27, 1981, to critical and commercial acclaim, reaching number one on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart, with four singles making the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, and ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' deeming her "the Reigning Queen of Rock and Roll".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/bella-donna-mw0000191230/awards |title=Bella Donna |publisher=AllMusic |accessdate=February 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The day that ''Bella Donna'' reached number one  on the ''Billboard'' 200, Nicks found out that her best friend Robin Anderson was diagnosed with leukemia in 1981. Robin was told she only had three months to live, and also was told she was going to give birth. Robin gave birth to a son, appointing Nicks as the child's godmother. "I never got to enjoy ''Bella Donna'' at all because my friend was dying. Something went out that day; something left."&lt;ref name="robin"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inherownwords.com/robin.htm |title=Stevie Nicks on Robin Snyder Anderson |publisher=inherownwords.com |accessdate=September 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Robin's death in 1982, Nicks married Robin's widower Kim Anderson, believing that her friend would want her to care for the baby. "We were all in such insane grief, just completely deranged," she told ''The Telegraph'' in 2007. The couple divorced three months after the marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3667803/Stevie-Nicks-a-survivors-story.html |title=Stevie Nicks- A Survivor's Story |work=The Telegraph |accessdate=September 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/mar/25/stevie-nicks-interview|title=Stevie Nicks: The men, the music, the menopause|last=McLean|first=Craig|date=2011-03-25|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-08-17|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Bella Donna'' introduced Nicks' back-up singers, Sharon Celani and Lori Perry, who have contributed vocals to all of Nicks' solo albums since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inherownwords.com/girls.htm |title=Stevie Nicks on the Girls: Sharon Celani &amp; Lori Perry-Nicks |publisher=Inherownwords.com |accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1981, Nicks embarked on the ''White Winged Dove'' tour, which she had to cut short to record the ''[[Mirage (Fleetwood Mac album)|Mirage]]'' album with Fleetwood Mac.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rockalittle.com/behind_the_music.htm |title=Stevie Nicks&amp;nbsp;– Behind the Music |publisher=Rockalittle.com |accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicks toured with Fleetwood Mac for the ''Mirage'' tour in late 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/16/arts/rock-concert-fleetwood-mac-on-mirage-tour.html |title=Rock Concert: Fleetwood Mac on 'Mirage' Tour |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=October 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1983–1986: ''The Wild Heart'' and ''Rock a Little'' ===
Nicks released her second solo album, ''[[The Wild Heart (album)|The Wild Heart]]'', on June 10, 1983. The album went double platinum, reached number five  on the ''Billboard'' 200 albums chart, and featured three hit singles. It also introduced songwriter and performer [[Sandy Stewart (musician)|Sandy Stewart]] as co-writer and vocalist.

Nicks performed at the second [[US Festival]] at Glen Helen Regional Park in San Bernardino, California, and later [[The Wild Heart Tour|toured the US]] from June 1983 to November 1983. Nicks appeared on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in December 1983, performing "[[Stand Back]]" and "Nightbird".

Following the tour for ''The Wild Heart'', Nicks commenced work on her third solo album. Originally titled ''Mirror Mirror'', Nicks recorded songs for the album during 1984. However, Nicks was unhappy with the album, and opted to record a new batch of songs in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inherownwords.com/rockalit.htm |title=Stevie Nicks on 'Rock A Little' |publisher=inherownwords.com |accessdate=June 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Rock A Little]]'', as it was retitled, was released November 18, 1985, to commercial success, supported by three successful singles.

Nicks toured for ''Rock A Little'' in 1986. The tour ended on October 10, 1986. Nicks also performed with [[Bob Dylan]] and Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers during their tour in Australia.

The tour marked a turning point in Nicks' life. The January before the tour was to begin, a plastic surgeon warned her of severe health problems if she did not stop using cocaine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3667803/Stevie-Nicks-a-survivors-story.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |title=Stevie Nicks: a survivor's story |first=Mick |last=Brown |date=September 8, 2007 |accessdate=June 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I said, 'What do you think about my nose?'," she recalled on ''The Chris Isaak Hour'' in 2009. "And he said, 'Well, I think the next time you do a hit of cocaine, you could drop dead. As Stevie said “I used to carry a gram of cocaine in my boot at all times,” as said in a 2013 interview.'" At the end of the Australian tour, Nicks checked herself into the [[Betty Ford Center]] for 30 days to overcome her cocaine addiction.&lt;ref name="youtube1"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR0--gXpJEU |title=The Chris Isaak Hour: Stevie Nicks, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nicksfix.com/article_dailynews_sep7_2001.htm |title=Stevie Nicks in Her Own Words |publisher=ABC News |author=Cynthia McFadden |date=September 7, 2001 |accessdate=June 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recalling the strong influence of [[Janis Joplin]] and [[Jimi Hendrix]] on her music and life, she told a UK interviewer, "I saw how they went down, and a part of me wanted to go down with them&amp;nbsp;... but then another part of me thought, I would be very sad if some 25-year-old lady rock and roll singer ten years from now said, 'I wish Stevie Nicks would have thought about it a little more.' That's kind of what stopped me and made me really look at the world through clear eyes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVuEIQrVS34 |title=Stevie Nicks, The Other Side of The Mirror, UK Interview |accessdate=October 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year, on the advice of friends concerned that she might relapse, she visited a psychiatrist who prescribed the sedative [[Clonazepam|Klonopin]] to help her remain free from cocaine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nicksfix.com/interview_chum_may6_2001.htm |title=Toronto Interview |publisher=CHUM Radio |author=Marilyn Dennis |date=May 6, 2001 |accessdate=June 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1987–1990: ''Tango in the Night'', ''The Other Side of the Mirror'', and ''Behind the Mask'' ===
In late 1985, Fleetwood Mac began work on ''[[Tango in the Night]]'', but due to her promotional schedule for the ''Rock A Little'' album and subsequent tour, Nicks was mostly unavailable to work on the album with the band except for a few weeks following her stay at the Betty Ford Center in 1986 (which was the inspiration for the song "Welcome To The Room...Sara"). She sent the band demos of her songs to work on in her absence. The album was released in April 1987 and became the band's second-highest selling album ever, behind ''Rumours''.

Creative differences and unresolved personal issues within the band led Buckingham to quit the group right before their world tour. According to bassist [[John McVie]], a "physically ugly" confrontation between Nicks and Buckingham ensued when Nicks angrily challenged Buckingham's decision to leave the band.&lt;ref name=FMart60&gt;Sykes, Graham. ''Rock Family Trees Transcript''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The band embarked on the ''Shake The Cage'' tour in September 1987, with Buckingham replaced by [[Rick Vito]] and [[Billy Burnette]]. The tour was suspended during Nicks' bout with [[chronic fatigue syndrome]] and developing addiction to [[Clonazepam]], though it resumed in 1988. ''Tango in the Night'' met with commercial success and was followed in 1988 by Fleetwood Mac's ''[[Greatest Hits (1988 Fleetwood Mac album)|Greatest Hits]]'' album in November 1988.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Also in 1988, Nicks began work on a fourth solo album with English record producer [[Rupert Hine]]. ''[[The Other Side of the Mirror (album)|The Other Side of the Mirror]]'' was released on May 11, 1989, to commercial success. Nicks became romantically involved with Hine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inherownwords.com/rooms.htm |title=Stevie Nicks on 'Rooms on Fire' |publisher=inherownwords.com |accessdate=June 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicks toured the US and Europe from August to November 1989, the only time she has toured Europe as a solo act. She has famously been quoted since as stating that she has "no memory of this tour" due to her increasing dependency on Clonazepam,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://bla.fleetwoodmac.net/index.php?page=index_v2&amp;id=231&amp;c=11 |work=[[People (American magazine)|''People'']] |date=January 19, 1998 |title=High Priestess |author=Steve Dougherty, Todd Gold}}&lt;/ref&gt; prescribed in ever increasing amounts by a psychiatrist between 1987 and 1994, in an attempt to keep Nicks from regressing to her former abuse of cocaine.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

In 1989, Nicks set to work with Fleetwood Mac on a new album, ''[[Behind the Mask (album)|Behind the Mask]]'', which was released in 1990 to moderate commercial success in the US. In the UK, however, the album entered the chart at number one  and was certified platinum. The band went on a world tour to promote the album, on the last night of which Buckingham and Nicks reunited on stage to perform "Landslide".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.fleetwoodmac-uk.com/articles/FMart55.htm |title=Fleetwood Mac, Live at the Great Western Forum, Inglewood, California December&amp;nbsp;7th, 1990 |work=Rolling Stone |author=Steve Pond |date=February 7, 1991 |accessdate=June 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the tour concluded, Nicks left the group over a dispute with Mick Fleetwood, who would not allow her to release the 1977 track "Silver Springs" on her album ''[[Timespace: The Best of Stevie Nicks]]'', because of his plans to save it for release on a forthcoming Fleetwood Mac box set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fleetwoodmac-uk.com/timeline/timeline1990s.html |title=Timeline 1990s |publisher=Go Your Own Way |accessdate=June 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fleetwood knew that the song would be valuable as a selling point for the box set, since over the years, it had gained interest among the band's fans.&lt;ref name=Furman2003 /&gt;

=== 1991–1996: ''Timespace'' and ''Street Angel'' ===
On the 10th anniversary of her solo career debut, Nicks released ''Timespace: The Best of Stevie Nicks'' on September 3, 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/stevie-nicks/discography/66977/ |title=Timespace: The Best of Stevie Nicks by Stevie Nicks |work=MTV Artists |accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Fleetwood Mac also released a four-disc box set, ''[[25 Years&amp;nbsp;– The Chain]]'', which included "Silver Springs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://louderthanwar.com/fleetwood-mac-25-years-the-chain-4-cd-box-set-warner-bros-records-inc/ |title=Fleetwood Mac: 25 Years, The Chain 4 CD box set review |work=Louder Than War |accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1992 US presidential campaign, [[Bill Clinton]] used the Fleetwood Mac hit "[[Don't Stop (Fleetwood Mac song)|Don't Stop]]" as his campaign theme song, and Nicks rejoined the classic ''Rumours'' line-up of the band (including Buckingham) to perform the song at Clinton's 1993 inaugural gala. No plans for an official reunion were made at that time. Nicks was criticized for her weight gain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=LXNUWWuzscMC&amp;lpg=PA367&amp;dq=clinton%20inauguration%20%22stevie%20nicks%22%20fat&amp;pg=PA367#v=onepage&amp;q=clinton%20inauguration%20%22stevie%20nicks%22%20fat&amp;f=false |title=Milk it!: collected musings on the ...&amp;nbsp;– Google Books |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=January 9, 2011 |isbn=0-306-81271-1 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicks, who is {{convert|5|ft|1|in|m}}, had gained weight, peaking at 175&amp;nbsp;lbs (79.4&amp;nbsp;kg). "Klonopin was worse than the cocaine," she has said. "I lost those 8 years of my life. I didn't write, and I had gained so much weight."&lt;ref name="youtube1" /&gt;

In late 1993, while Nicks held a [[baby shower]] at her house, she tripped over a box, passed out, and cut her forehead near a fireplace. "I'm one of those people who doesn't injure themselves. I was horrified to see that blood. I hadn't had enough wine. I knew it was the Klonopin," she said, realizing that she needed help, and endured a painful 47-day detox in a hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nicksfix.com/article_us_weekly_june11_2001.htm |title=Stevie Nicks&amp;nbsp;– Goes her own way |work=US Weekly |publisher=Nicksfix.Com |date=June 11–18, 2001 |accessdate=October 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following her successful detox, Nicks released her fifth solo album, ''[[Street Angel (album)|Street Angel]]'', recorded during 1992 and 1993 using material written mostly in previous years. Released on May 23, 1994, ''Street Angel'' was poorly received, reaching number 45 on the ''Billboard'' Top 200. Nicks has since expressed major disappointment with the album, claiming that a lot of its production work took place during her second stint in rehab, meaning she had little or no say over the final product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nicksfix.com/article_msn_music_may_30_2001.htm |title=Stevie Nicks Talks To MSN Music |website=nicksfix.com |publisher=Nicksfix.Com |accessdate=February 28, 2014 |date=January 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite a three-month tour in support of the album, Nicks was crushed by the focus on her weight and the poor reception of the album. Disgusted by the criticism she received during the tour for being overweight, she vowed to never set foot on a stage again unless she slimmed down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stepko |first1=Barbara |title=Stevie Wonder |url=http://www.nicksfix.com/mccalls1.htm |website=nicksfix.com |publisher=nicksfix.com |accessdate=October 17, 2014 |date=May 25, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Nicks reunited with Lindsey Buckingham and contributed the duet "Twisted" to the ''[[Twister (1996 film)|Twister]]'' movie soundtrack, while in 1996, the [[Sheryl Crow]]-penned "Somebody Stand by Me" featured on the ''[[Boys on the Side]]'' soundtrack, and Nicks also remade Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'" for Fox's TV hit ''[[Party of Five]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://radio.com/2013/03/18/whenever-i-call-you-friend-stevie-nicks-greatest-collaborations/ |title=Whenever I Call You, Friend: Stevie Nicks’ Greatest Collaborations  " Radio.com |publisher=Radio.com |accessdate=October 6, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010134628/http://radio.com/2013/03/18/whenever-i-call-you-friend-stevie-nicks-greatest-collaborations/ |archive-date=October 10, 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/507970/party-of-five-soundtrack-due-in-96/ |title="Party of Five" Soundtrack Due in '96 |publisher=MTV News |accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1997–1998: ''The Dance'' ===
In 1996, Lindsey Buckingham, working on a planned solo album, enlisted the help of Mick Fleetwood and John McVie, which eventually led to a reunion of the entire band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bla.fleetwoodmac.net/index.php?page=index_v2&amp;id=5927&amp;c=9 |title=The Blue Letter Archives |publisher=Bla.fleetwoodmac.net |accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A newly invigorated and slimmed-down Nicks joined Fleetwood Mac for ''The Dance'', a highly successful 1997 tour that coincided with the 20th anniversary of the release of ''Rumours''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Fj5OAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RP0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6700%2C4141263 |title=Lakeland Ledger&amp;nbsp;– Google News Archive Search |publisher=Google News |accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the tour, Nicks started work with a voice coach, to lend her voice more control and protect it from the stress of lengthy touring schedules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/2011/09/gold-dust-woman-a-qa-with-stevie-nicks/4/ |title=Gold Dust Woman: A Q&amp;A With Stevie Nicks |work=American Songwriter |accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rockalittle.com/eonline.htm |title=Stevie Nicks interview |publisher=Rockalittle.com |accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also went on a diet and started [[jogging]] to lose weight.&lt;ref name="people.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20125232,00.html |title=Stevie Nicks: Rock Singer |work=People |accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The live CD release, ''[[The Dance (Fleetwood Mac album)|The Dance]]'', was released to commercial and critical acclaim, earning the group several [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nominations, including their live performance of Nicks' "Silver Springs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rockalittle.com/silversp.htm |title=Silver Springs |publisher=Rock a Little |accessdate=February 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, she joined the group for its induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/fleetwood-mac/ |title=Fleetwood Mac |publisher=Rockhall.com |accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, Fleetwood Mac was awarded the Outstanding Contribution at the [[BRIT Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brits.co.uk/artist/fleetwood-mac |title=Fleetwood Mac |publisher=Brit Awards |accessdate=October 6, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140507160631/http://www.brits.co.uk/artist/fleetwood-mac |archivedate=May 7, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She put work on a new solo album on hold when she was approached by [[Warner Music Group|Warner Music]] to release a solo career-spanning box set, to finish her contract with [[Atlantic Records]] in the US. After the culmination of the Fleetwood Mac reunion tour, Nicks settled down in Los Angeles and [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] with close friends and colleagues to devise a track list for this three-disc collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rockalittle.com/interv6.htm |title=Stevie Nicks Interview on KLOS |publisher=Rockalittle.com |accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bla.fleetwoodmac.net/index.php?page=index_v2&amp;id=302&amp;c=11 |title=The Blue Letter Archives |publisher=Bla.fleetwood.net |accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1998–2001: ''Enchanted'' and ''Trouble in Shangri-La'' ===
The box set ''[[Enchanted (Stevie Nicks album)|Enchanted]]'' was released to acclaim on April 28, 1998, with liner notes from Nicks, as well as exclusive rare photographs, and pages from her journals. Nicks supported the box set with a successful US tour. In 1998, Nicks contributed to the ''[[Practical Magic]]'' soundtrack and performed in Don Henley's benefit concert for the Walden Woods Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rockalittle.com/ew11.htm |title="Crystal" Mesh Sheryl Crow and Stevie Nicks invite EW to their first recording session|work=Entertainment Weekly |publisher=Rockalittle.com |accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/151513/bjork-joni-mitchell-reign-over-walden-woods-benefit/ |title=Bjork, Joni Mitchell Reign Over Walden Woods Benefit |publisher=MTV News |accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicks had begun writing actively for ''[[Trouble in Shangri-La]]'' in 1994 and 1995 as she came out of her Klonopin dependency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rockalittle.com/interview_wallofsound_may2001.htm |title=Stevie Nicks&amp;nbsp;– Wall of Sound Interview |publisher=Rockalittle.com |accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rockalittle.com/interview_time_out_ny_apr2001.htm |title=Stevie Nicks&amp;nbsp;– Time Out New York Interview |publisher=Rockalittle.com |accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to her, friend and former musical partner Tom Petty was responsible for convincing her to write music again when he rebuffed her request that he write a song with her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/78771/stevie-nicks-is-ready-for-trouble |title=Stevie Nicks |date=February 12, 2001 |work=Billboard |accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She resumed recording songs for the ''Trouble in Shangri-La'' album with Sheryl Crow, who produced and performed on several tracks. When a scheduling conflict forced Crow to drop out of the project, Nicks first approached R&amp;B producer [[Dallas Austin]], but these sessions have never surfaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1425064/dallas-austin-discusses-working-with-stevie-nicks/ |title=Dallas Austin Discusses Working With Stevie Nicks |publisher=MTV News |accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicks finally called on [[John Shanks]] to produce the remainder of the album, with additional contributions from [[David Kahne]], [[Rick Nowels]], [[Pierre Marchand]], and Jeff Trott. Artists [[Natalie Maines]], [[Sarah McLachlan]], and [[Macy Gray]] contributed to some of the tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rockalittle.com/interview_969fn_phoenix_may2001.htm |title=Stevie Nicks&amp;nbsp;– Mix 96.9 Interview |publisher=Rockalittle.com |accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Released May 1, 2001, ''Trouble in Shangri-La'' restored Nicks's solo career to critical and commercial success. "Planets of the Universe" was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/complete-list-of-grammy-nominees/ |title=Complete List of Grammy Nominees |date=January 4, 2002 |publisher=CBS News |accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Nicks was named VH1's "Artist of the Month" for May 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rockalittle.com/article_prnewswire_may14_2001.htm |title=Stevie Nicks&amp;nbsp;– PRNewswire |publisher=Rockalittle.com |accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicks was named one of ''[[People (American magazine)|People]]'' magazine's 50 Most Beautiful People,&lt;ref name="people.com" /&gt; was featured in a well-received ''Behind the Music'' episode,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vh1.com/shows/behind_the_music/episode.jhtml?episodeID=51332 |title=Ep. 043&amp;nbsp;– Stevie Nicks&amp;nbsp;– Behind The Music&amp;nbsp;– Episode Summary, Highlights, and Recaps |publisher=VH1 |accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and performed an episode of the VH1 Storytellers Concert Program. Nicks made several television appearances in support of the album and performed at the 2001 [[Radio Music Awards]].

Nicks supported the album with a successful tour, although some shows were canceled or postponed because of her bout with acute [[bronchitis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/78628/bronchitis-knocks-nicks-off-tour |title=Bronchitis Knocks Nicks Off Tour |date=August 22, 2001 |work=Billboard |accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shows were also canceled because of the [[September 11 attacks]] in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/many-concerts-cancelled-after-9-11-attacks-20010913 |title=Many Concerts Cancelled After 9/11 Attacks |work=Rolling Stone |accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2002–2006: ''Say You Will'', Two Voices Tour, and Gold Dust Tour ===
[[File:Stevie Nicks.jpg|left|thumb|Nicks during Fleetwood Mac's 2003 tour]]

In 2001, Fleetwood Mac began work on a new studio album, though this time without [[Christine McVie]], leaving Nicks as the sole woman in the band for the first time. After the end of her solo tour, Nicks convened with the other members of the band for recording during 2002.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

''[[Say You Will (album)|Say You Will]]'' was released in April 2003 and met with commercial success but mixed reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/say-you-will/fleetwood-mac |title=Reviews for Say You Will by Fleetwood Mac&amp;nbsp; |publisher=Metacritic |accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogcritics.org/music-review-fleetwood-mac-say-you/ |title=Music Review: Fleetwood Mac&amp;nbsp;– Say You Will |work=Blogcritics |accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicks joined the group to support the album with a world tour lasting until September 2004.

She has subsequently stated in several interviews that she was not happy with the album or the successful world tour that followed, citing production disputes with Buckingham as a core factor, as well as the absence of fellow female band member Christine McVie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/music/a-magical-life/2006/02/09/1139465789637.html?page=fullpage |title=A magical life&amp;nbsp;– Music&amp;nbsp;– Entertainment |work=The Age |location=Melbourne |date=February 12, 2006 |accessdate=January 9, 2011 |first=Guy |last=Blackman}}&lt;/ref&gt; A documentary of the making of the album, ''Destiny Rules'', was released on DVD in 2004 and chronicles the sometimes-turbulent relationships between band members, especially Buckingham and Nicks, during that time in the studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/sep/10/dvdreviews.shopping |title=Pop DVD: Fleetwood Mac, Destiny Rules&amp;nbsp;– Music |work=The Guardian |accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a few months' respite from the ''Say You Will'' tour, Nicks did a four-night stint in May 2005 at [[Caesars Palace]] in [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]], and then did 10 shows with Don Henley dubbed the ''Two Voices'' tour. During the summer of 2005, Nicks continued doing solo shows (''Gold Dust'' tour) with pop singer [[Vanessa Carlton]] as the opening act, playing over 20 dates nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bla.fleetwoodmac.net/index.php?page=index_v2&amp;id=1077&amp;c=11|title=The Blue Letter Archives|publisher=Bla.fleetwoodmac.net|accessdate=December 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2007–2009: ''Crystal Visions'', ''Soundstage Sessions'', and Unleashed Tour ===
[[File:Stevie Nicks 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Nicks in June 2008]]
On March 27, 2007, [[Reprise Records]] released ''[[Crystal Visions&amp;nbsp;– The Very Best of Stevie Nicks]]'' in the US. The album debuted at number 21 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1053163/mcgraw-leads-seven-top-10-debuts-onto-billboard-200 |title=McGraw Leads Seven Top 10 Debuts Onto Billboard 200 |date=April 4, 2007 |work=Billboard |accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album has sold over 505,000 copies in the U.S.

The compilation includes her hit singles, a dance remix, and one new track, a live version of [[Led Zeppelin]]'s "[[Rock and Roll (Led Zeppelin song)|Rock and Roll]]". Two versions of this album were made, one with just the audio CD and a deluxe version which includes a DVD featuring all of Nicks' music videos with audio commentary from Nicks herself, as well as rare footage from the ''Bella Donna'' recording sessions.

A tour with [[Chris Isaak]], opening in Concord, California on May 17, 2007, supported the release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://casinoconnectionac.com/issue/june_2007/article/bella_donna |title=Bella Donna -Bella Donna&amp;nbsp;– Casino Connection Atlantic City |publisher=Casinoconnectionac.com |accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2007/04/stevie-nicks-to-join-chris-isaak-on-tour.html |title=Stevie Nicks To Join Chris Isaak on Tour |work=Paste |accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reprise Records initially released two radio-only promos, the live version of "Landslide" with the [[Melbourne Symphony Orchestra]] and "Rock and Roll". Both tracks failed to garner much airplay and made no impact on the charts. Reprise Records released "[[Stand Back#Re-releases|Stand Back]]" (issued with club mixes) on May 29, 2007. "Stand Back", which peaked at number five on the pop singles chart in 1983, reached number two on the ''Billboard'' Club chart. Nicks previously reached number one  on this chart, with "Planets of the Universe" (from ''Trouble in Shangri-La'') in 2001. The remix single of "Stand Back" debuted on the ''Billboard'' Hot Singles Sales chart on September 15, 2007, at number   10, peaking at number four  the following week. It also debuted on the ''Billboard'' Hot Dance Singles Sales chart at number three, later peaking at number one .

On March 31, 2009, Nicks released the album, ''[[The Soundstage Sessions]]'', via Reprise Records. The album debuted at number 47 on the ''Billboard'' 200 albums chart. The first single from the album,  "[[Crash Into Me#Stevie Nicks version|Crash into Me]]", was released as a digital download, along with "Landslide" (orchestra version) as a [[A-side and B-side|B-side]], on March 17, 2009.

In late 2008, Fleetwood Mac announced that the band would tour in 2009, beginning in March. As per the 2003–04 tour, Christine McVie would not be featured in the line-up. The tour was branded as a 'greatest hits' show titled "Unleashed", although they played album tracks such as "Storms" and "I Know I'm Not Wrong".

=== 2010–2013: ''In Your Dreams'' and Extended Play Tour ===
[[File:Stevie Nicks Performing.jpg|thumb|Nicks performing with Dave Stewart in November 2011]]

After completing the ''Unleashed'' tour with Fleetwood Mac, Nicks began work on her first solo album in a decade with [[David A. Stewart]], a musician and record producer best known for being one half of the duo [[Eurythmics]].

Nicks performed in a series of shows in August 2010 ("it's not really a tour", she said). They did not contain any of her new music, because she did not want it to end up on YouTube. The Santa Barbara show benefited a young girl she had met through the Make-a-Wish Foundation in Los Angeles with [[rhabdomyosarcoma]], a rare cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.independent.com/news/2010/jul/26/stevie-nicks-looking-back-charging-forward-new-alb/ |title=Stevie Nicks Is Looking Back, Charging Forward on New Album |date=July 26, 2010 |work=Santa Barbara Independent |accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 13, 2011, Reprise announced Nicks' upcoming album ''[[In Your Dreams (album)|In Your Dreams]]'' would be released on May 3, and the lead single, "[[Secret Love (Stevie Nicks song)|Secret Love]]", would be released on February 8. Reprise provided a free download of the single to fans who ordered the album via certain websites. Nicks originally wrote "Secret Love" in 1976 and recorded a demo of it for Fleetwood Mac's 1977 album, ''Rumours''. It did not make the final cut for the album. The demo version had been circulating among fans for many years prior to its inclusion on ''In Your Dreams''. Nicks promoted the song with a video directed by Dave Stewart. Nicks' goddaughter Kelly appears in the video wearing a vintage dress that Nicks wore on stage in 1976. According to Nicks, Kelly portrays the young Stevie Nicks blending with the soul of Nicks' 62-year-old self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pridesource.com/article.html?article=46793 |title=PrideSource&amp;nbsp;– Stevie Nicks talks gays, 'Glee' controversy and losing weight&amp;nbsp;... with her own music? |work=Pridesource |accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the US [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]], "Secret Love" was a modest hit on the Adult Contemporary Singles chart, peaking at number  20, and at number  25 on the Triple-A Singles chart. Another song on the album, "[[For What It's Worth (Stevie Nicks song)|For What It's Worth]]", features Nicks' niece in the video. The song reached number 25 on the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|''Billboard'' Adult Contemporary]] chart in September 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/467382/chart-highlights-rodney-atkins-takes-back-road-to-no-1-on-country |title=Chart Highlights: Rodney Atkins Takes 'Back Road' To No. 1 On Country Songs |work=Billboard |accessdate=August 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A documentary film was made for the album, directed by Stewart.

''In Your Dreams'' was well received by music critics. ''Rolling Stone'' commented "It's not just her first album in 10 years, it's her finest collection of songs since the Eighties".

Standing at {{convert|5|ft|1|in}}, Nicks has stated she felt "a little ridiculous" standing next to Mick Fleetwood, who is {{convert|6|ft| 6|in}}.&lt;ref&gt;Interview by Liz Derringer, ''[[High Times]]'' magazine&amp;nbsp;– March 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, she developed a penchant for {{convert|6|in|cm|adj=on}} platform boots. "Even when platforms went completely out of style, I kept wearing them because I didn't want to go back to being {{convert|5|ft|3|in|m}} in heels", she told ''[[Allure (magazine)|Allure]]''  in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;"How I Got That Look", [[Allure (magazine)|''Allure'' magazine]], April 1995 Interview.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, Nicks has developed a style which she calls her "uniform". Her “uniform” is known as a witchy kind of look that goes with her songs and performances.&lt;ref&gt;Transcribed by Jane Fijal, "Spotlight on Stevie Nicks", Aired on 96.1 [[WSRS]] Worcester, Massachusetts on August 5, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicks has said that her vocal style and performance antics evolved from female singers like [[Grace Slick]] and [[Janis Joplin]]. She admitted inspiration when she saw Joplin perform live (and opened for with her first band Fritz) shortly before Joplin's death. Nicks owns a strand of Joplin's stage beads. She also commented that she once saw a woman in her audience dressed in dripping chiffon with a [[Gibson Girl]] hairstyle and big boots, and Nicks knew she wanted something similar. She took the look and made it her own.&lt;ref&gt;On someone who influenced her look, ''[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]'', December 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; Nicks possesses the vocal range of a [[List of contraltos in non-classical music|contralto]] and her voice has been described as a "gruff, feathery alto"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.star-telegram.com/entertainment/arts-culture/article4492091.html |title=Review: Fleetwood Mac at American Airlines Center |date= December 15, 2014 |publisher=Preston Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, she has decorated her microphone stand with roses, ribbons, chiffon, crystal beads, scarves, and small [[stuffed toy]]s.

=== Philanthropy ===
Nicks has started a charity foundation titled "Stevie Nicks' Band of Soldiers" which is used for the benefit of wounded military personnel.&lt;ref name=SNBOF&gt;Andrew Gumbel. [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/stevie-nicks-rock-follies-394224.html Stevie Nicks: Rock follies.] ''[[The Independent]]'' October 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2004, Nicks began visiting Army and Navy medical centers in [[Washington, D.C.]] While visiting wounded service men and women, Nicks became determined to find an object she could leave with the soldiers that would raise their spirits, motivate, and give them something to look forward to each day. She eventually decided to purchase hundreds of [[iPod Nano]]s, load them with music, artists, and [[playlist]]s which she would hand select, and autograph them:&lt;ref name=troops&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nicksfix.com/journal_visiting_troops.htm |title=Stevie's Journal Entries Regarding Visits to the Injured Troops |publisher=The Nicks Fix |accessdate=June 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|I call it a soldiers' iPod. It has all the crazy stuff that I listen to, and my collections I've been making since the '70s for going on the road, when I'm sick&amp;nbsp;... or the couple of times in my life that I have really been down, music is what always dances me out of bed.|source=Stevie Nicks, ''[[The Arizona Republic]].}}

She now regularly delivers these tokens of her appreciation, bringing her closest friends, such as Mick Fleetwood, along to share the experience:&lt;ref name=troops /&gt;

{{Quote|So, as Mick [Fleetwood] and I went from room to room delivering their tiny iPod, they told us their stories. Mick became his tall, loving, father figure, English self, taking in every word they said, remaining calm (at least on the outside) inspiring them. We floated from room to room down through the halls of the two hospitals over a three-day period. We gave out all our iPods. Right before I left for DC, [[Steven Tyler]] and [[Joe Perry (musician)|Joe Perry]] dug into their pockets and came up with $10,000 for me. In my eyes they went from the coolest rock stars to generous great men; as my press agent Liz Rosenberg said, every returning wounded soldier should be given an iPod. It will be an integral part of their recovery.|source=Stevie Nicks&lt;ref name=troops /&gt;}}

=== Style ===
Nicks' style has remained the same throughout her years in the spotlight and even "at 60 she is still working the gossamer tunics and shawls that have influenced two generations of Stevie acolytes, and given her performances the feel of a Wiccan ritual" writes ''New York Times'' reporter Ruth La Ferla.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/09/fashion/09STEVIE.html |title=Still Dressing for Stevie |publisher=New York Times|accessdate=July 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicks has been known for her multiple wardrobe changes during live performances, almost having a new outfit for each song she sang. The cost to keep up her overall style, of hair, makeup, and wardrobe, was not cheap. Nicks filed tax deductible expenses in 1991 costing "$12,495 for makeup and hairstyling [and] $43,291 for professional clothing and maintenance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanbar.org/newsletter/publications/gp_solo_magazine_home/gp_solo_magazine_index/may99butcher.html|title=Tax Treatment of Leisure Accoutrements|publisher=American Bar Association|accessdate=July 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stevie sings about the store where her iconic style all started in the song "Gypsy" on Fleetwood Mac's 13th studio album "Mirage", released in 1982. In the song, Stevie sings of a store called the Velvet Underground, a boutique in San Francisco, California where famous rockers like Janis Joplin and Grace Slick were known to shop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inherownwords.com/gypsy_velvet_popup.html|title=Stevie Nicks on Gypsy|publisher=In Her Own Words|accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is here at the Velvet Underground where Stevie's unique and easily recognizable style most notably began.

According to BMI, "Landslide" also earned Nicks the 35th Robert J. Burton Award as "Most Performed Country Song of the Year". This distinction is given to the song tallying the most feature US broadcast performances during the eligibility period. Included on the Dixie Chicks' platinum Monument album ''Home'', "Landslide" was a Country, Adult Top 40, Hot 100 and AC ''Billboard'' charts smash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/233884 |title=Stevie Nicks Wins in a 'Landslide' at BMI Country Awards |publisher=[[Broadcast Music Incorporated]] |date=November 3, 2003 |accessdate=June 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternative rock band [[the Smashing Pumpkins]] made an acoustic cover of the song that was featured on their 1994 B-side collection ''Pisces Iscariot''.

Other successful covers have included [[the Corrs]]' "Dreams" and [[Courtney Love]]'s band [[Hole (band)|Hole]] with "Gold Dust Woman". "[[Edge of Seventeen]]" was sampled on [[Destiny's Child]]'s 2001 number one  single "[[Bootylicious]]". Nicks appeared in the video for "Bootylicious" and in an episode of MTV's ''[[Making The Video]]'' that featured it, in which she expressed her admiration for both the song and the group. Also, American actress and singer [[Lindsay Lohan]] covered "[[Edge of Seventeen]]" on her second [[studio album]] ''[[A Little More Personal (Raw)]]'' (2005). [[Deep Dish (band)|Deep Dish]] fulfilled their "Dreams" of working with Nicks in 2005 when Nicks offered to re-record vocals on a remix of her number-one penned song, "[[Dreams (Fleetwood Mac song)|Dreams]]".

== Personal life ==
Nicks' only marriage was to Kim Anderson, the widower of her friend Robin Anderson. They married in 1983 soon after Robin Anderson died of leukemia and while the ''Bella Donna'' album was on the top of the charts. "I was determined to take care of [Robin's] baby, so I said to Kim, 'I don't know, I guess we should just get married." Nicks and Anderson divorced after only three months: "We didn't get married because we were in love, we got married because we were grieving and it was the only way that we could feel like we were doing anything."&lt;ref name="robin" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nicksfix.com/article_in_style_march2002.htm |title=Desert Rose |publisher=In Style |author=Stephanie Tuck |date=March 2002 |accessdate=June 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Years after their divorce, she reunited with her stepson when he was a teenager, putting him through college,&lt;ref name=SurvivorsStory&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3667803/Stevie-Nicks-a-survivors-story.html |title="Stevie Nicks: A Survivor's Story"|author= Brown, Mick |date=September 8, 2007 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=July 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she has maintained contact with him ever since.

[https://books.google.com/books?id=SW31aVVDc_AC&amp;pg=PA127 page 127]&lt;/ref&gt; She connected with [[Jimmy Iovine]], who produced ''Bella Donna'' during 1980–81, and with Eagles and [[James Gang]] guitarist [[Joe Walsh]] during 1983–86, whom she referred to in 2007 as one of her greatest loves, though the couple could not sustain the relationship because of mutual drug abuse.&lt;ref name=SurvivorsStory/&gt; Nicks toured with Walsh in 1984, and wrote "[[Has Anyone Ever Written Anything for You?]]" about Walsh's deceased daughter.

Nicks has said that she consciously chose not to have children of her own, due to her demanding career and desire to follow her art wherever it should take her: "My mission maybe wasn't to be a mom and a wife; maybe my particular mission was to write songs to make moms and wives feel better."&lt;ref&gt;Stevie Nicks on ABC Downtown, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Of her niece, godchildren, and extended family she says: "I have lots of kids. It's much more fun to be the crazy auntie than it is to be the mom, anyway."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/music/a-magical-life/2006/02/09/1139465789637.html?page=fullpage |title=Stevie Nicks: A Magical Life, 2006 |work=The Age |accessdate=February 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicks has maintained a journal nearly every day since Fleetwood Mac began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.more.com/stevie-nicks |title=Stevie Nicks on Loss, Love, and What She Wears |publisher=More |author=Holly-George Warren |accessdate=February 3, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221113304/http://www.more.com/stevie-nicks |archivedate=February 21, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; "I like to tell all my fairy goddaughters and my niece that when I'm gone they can sit on the floor and go through all these journals, and they can walk through my life, and they can smell the gardenia perfume on the pages. They can have it in their hands, who I was." Regarding a book based on her life, she has said, "I wouldn't write a book unless I could really tell the truth, and say all the people are in it are represented right&amp;nbsp;... If I'm gonna talk about all the people in my life, I need to be old enough and so do they, that nobody's gonna care&amp;nbsp;... I would never write a book about the bad parts. I would mostly revel in the fantastic parts, of which there were so many."&lt;ref name=drew /&gt;

In early 2007, reports surfaced concerning [[Lindsay Lohan]]'s interest in buying the rights to Nicks' life story and developing a motion picture in which she planned to play her. In March 2007, while promoting her album ''Crystal Visions'', Nicks was asked about this rumor. She told ''[[Access Hollywood]]'', "That is completely insane and crazy. There is no movie in the works on my life. Nobody can do a movie about my life without me being involved, because nobody knows what really happened in my life until I tell them. So, nobody can make a movie about my life. And if anybody ever went and made a movie about my life without my permission and my being involved, I would slam it so hard to the press that it would never do anything."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycVwQKjsU44#t=5m |title=Stevie Nicks interview&amp;nbsp;— Access Hollywood |work=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=October 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, she told ''The New York Times'' about Lohan, "Over my dead body. She needs to stop doing drugs and get a grip. Then maybe we'll talk."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://omg.yahoo.com/news/stevie-nicks-tells-lindsay-lohan-to-stand-back-about-playing-her-in-movie/21117?nc |title=Stevie Nicks Tells Lindsay Lohan To 'Stand Back' About Playing Her in Movie |publisher=omg! news on Yahoo! |date=April 10, 2009 |accessdate=June 3, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414193546/http://omg.yahoo.com/news/stevie-nicks-tells-lindsay-lohan-to-stand-back-about-playing-her-in-movie/21117?nc |archivedate=April 14, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2011-05-06/entertainment/29534183_1_stevie-nicks-fleetwood-mac-life-story |title=Stevie Nicks: Lindsay Lohan will 'never' get to play me in a movie 'unless she cleans up her life' |work=[[NY Daily News]] |location=New York |date=March 6, 2011 |accessdate=September 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until July 2007, Nicks lived in [[Paradise Valley, Arizona]], a suburb of Phoenix in a home she had built in 1981 and shared with her brother Chris, his wife Lori, and their daughter Jessica. She announced in mid-2007 that her Paradise Valley home would be put up for sale, citing her aspirations to "downsize" and focus more on her charity work, and that in the previous year she had only "spent about two weeks there". The house was put on the market for a reported $3.8 million and later sold for $3 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/stories/2008/01/14/story5.html |title=The Insider: Stevie Nicks sells home in Paradise Valley |work=Phoenix Business Journal |date=January 2008 |accessdate=September 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicks became an ordained minister with the [[Universal Life Church]] and officiated at the wedding of [[Deer Tick (band)|Deer Tick]] singer John McCauley and singer-songwriter [[Vanessa Carlton]] on December 27, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jezebel.com/queen-witch-stevie-nicks-officiated-a-wedding-this-week-1491751170 |title=Queen Witch Stevie Nicks Officiated a Wedding This Weekend |website=[[jezebel.com]] |author=Madeleine Davies |accessdate=December 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|I am religious. I wasn't raised in any religion, because we were always moving when I was a kid and didn't get involved in any church. But I believe there have been angels with me constantly through these last 20 years, or I wouldn't be alive. I pray a lot. In the last few years I've asked for things from God, and He's given them to me. And there were things I thought were gonna kill me, and He fixed them....I was destroying this gift that God gave me and asked for help.

In October 2005, Nicks attended the Melbourne Cup Week in Australia, and one of the horse-racing stakes was named after her: The Stevie Nicks Plate. She used this opportunity to launch her promotion of an Australian/New Zealand extension to her ''Gold Dust'' tour in February and March 2006. Nicks toured in Australia and New Zealand with popular Australian performer [[John Farnham]].&lt;ref&gt;By Sharon Krum, Women's Weekly, December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; She also appeared in concert with Tom Petty in June near [[Manassas, Virginia]], and at the [[Bonnaroo]] Music Festival that same month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fmlegacy.com/concertssn2006.html |title=The 2006 Stevie Shows |publisher=fmlegacy.com |accessdate=June 3, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090510061151/http://www.fmlegacy.com/concertssn2006.html |archivedate=May 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Nicks performed with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers for the first leg of their tour in the summer, and later in the year returned as a guest performer for a number of songs on the tour celebrating Petty's 30th anniversary since his debut album.

'''Aparecida Sueli Carneiro Jacoel''', best known as '''Sueli Carneiro''' (born 24 June 1950 in [[São Paulo]]) is an Afro-Brazilian philosopher, writer and [[anti-racism]] activist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.palmares.gov.br/?p=3864|title=Retratos do Brasil Negro|work=Fundação Cultural Palmares|access-date=2018-08-21|language=pt-BR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stf.jus.br/portal/cms/verNoticiaDetalhe.asp?idConteudo=121288|title=Notícias STF :: STF - Supremo Tribunal Federal|website=www.stf.jus.br|language=pt-br|access-date=2018-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp; Carneiro is the founder and current director of [[Geledés — Instituto da Mulher Negra]] (Geledés - Black Women's Institute), and considered a leading author on [[black feminism]] in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://claudia.abril.com.br/noticias/dia-das-mulheres-negras-julho-das-pretas-o-tributo-a-sueli-carneiro/|title=Dia das Mulheres Negras, Julho das Pretas: o tributo a Sueli Carneiro|work=CLAUDIA|access-date=2018-08-21|language=pt-BR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and work ==
Carneiro was born in 1950, in the São Paulo neighborhood of [[Lapa (district of São Paulo)|Lapa]], the eldest of seven children of José Horácio Carneiro, a railroad worker, and Eva Alves Carneiro, a seamstress.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mulher500.org.br/sueli-carneiro-1950/|title=Sueli Carneiro ( 1950 – ) – Mulher 500 Anos Atrás dos Panos|website=www.mulher500.org.br|language=pt-BR|access-date=2018-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; She graduated in philosophy at [[University of São Paulo]] and got her doctorate in education at the same institution. Carneiro became active in the&amp;nbsp;black feminist movement in Brazil from the late 1970s. In 1983,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;when the São Paulo state government created the Conselho Estadual da Condição Feminina (''State Council for the Feminine Condition''), Carneiro got involved in a successful campaign for a black woman, the radio broadcaster&amp;nbsp;[[Marta Arruda]], to join the council; there were no black woman among the thirty-two council members.

In 1988,&amp;nbsp;she founded&amp;nbsp; Geledés — Instituto da Mulher Negra, first independent black [[Feminism|feminist]] organization in São Paulo. Months after,&amp;nbsp;Carneiro was invited to join the&amp;nbsp;Conselho Nacional da Condição Feminina (National Council for the Feminine Condition), in [[Brasília]].

Carneiro created the only health program specific for&amp;nbsp;Afro-Brazilian women. Weekly, more than&amp;nbsp;thirty women are attended by psychologists and social workers, paticipating in lectures on sexuality, contraception, physical and mental health at&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Geledés headquarters. She also created ''SOS Racismo'', a program offering free legal assistance for victims of racial discrimination in São Paulo.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The five men, Al Haseri, [[Zaid al-Samari]], [[Saleh al-Fraidi]], [[Nayef al-Jeheishi]] and [[Mohammad al-Suwailmi]] had just been placed two weeks earlier on a list of 36 men wanted by Saudi security officials.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13788">The '''Witches of Warboys''' were Alice Samuel and her family, who were accused of, and executed for [[witchcraft]] between 1589 and 1593 in the village of [[Warboys]], in the [[fens]] of England.&lt;ref name="The Most Strange and Admirable..."&gt;{{cite book|title=The Most Strange and Admirable Discouerie of the Three Witches of Warboys Arraigned, Conuicted, and Executed at the Last Assises at Huntington, for the Bewitching of the Fiue Daughters of Robert Throckmorton Esquire, and Other Persons (1593), Reprint|year=2010|publisher=BiblioBazaar}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of many [[witch trials in the early modern period]], but scholar Barbara Rosen claims it "attracted probably more notice than any other in the sixteenth century".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosen |first=Barbara |title=Witchcraft in England 1558–1618 |location=Amherst |publisher=University  of Massachusetts |year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The trials of the witches occurred during the sixteenth century at [[Warboys]] in Huntingdonshire. The first allegations were made in November 1589 by Jane Throckmorton, the 10-year-old daughter of Robert Throckmorton the [[Squire]] of Warboys when she started suffering from fits (see Initial Allegations below). She accused the 76-year-old Alice Samuel of being the cause; this was echoed by Jane’s four sisters and some household servants who began exhibiting similar symptoms. When Alice Samuel was brought forward to the children, they became more ill and had the urge to scratch her.{{citation needed|date=October 2016|reason=For all the information in the paragraph}}

Robert Throckmorton was a close friend of [[Henry Williams (alias Cromwell)|Sir Henry Cromwell]], one of the wealthiest commoners in England and the grandfather of [[Oliver Cromwell]].  In March 1590, Lady Cromwell came to Warboys to visit. At the Throckmorton house, she interviewed Alice Samuel and what came after the interview served to confirm the suspicions the Throckmortons had. Lady Cromwell was tormented by Alice Samuel in her dreams, and after some time she became ill and died (buried 1592). This was enough proof to put Alice Samuel through a trial that would find her and the rest of her family guilty.{{citation needed|date=October 2016|reason=For all the information in the paragraph}}

==Initial allegations==

===Throckmorton family===
The first allegations declaring Alice as a practitioner of witchcraft were made in November 1589.  Following this, there were a total of twelve maid-servants of the Throckmorton household (in addition to the five daughters) who experienced fits and the torment of Alice Samuell’s witchcraft. Jane’s fits were described as such: "Sometimes she would neese [sneeze] very loud and thick for the space of half an hour together; and evidently as one in a great trance and sound lay quietly as long, soon after would begin to swell and heave up her belly so as none was able to bend her or keep her down, sometime thee would shake one leg and no other part of her, as if the palsie had been in it, sometimes the other, presently she would shake one of her arms and then the other, and soon after her head, as if she had been infected with the running palsie".&lt;ref name="Anonymous 1593"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anonymous |title=The most strange and admirable discouerie of the three Witches of Warboys |location=London |year=1593}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jane's mother and grandmother were by the child’s side while other neighbors came to see her. When Alice Samuel came in, the child proclaimed: "Grandmother look where the old witch sitteth (pointing to Samuell) did you ever see one more like a witch than she is: Take off her black thrumbed [shaggy or fringed] cap, for I cannot abide to look on her". Jane's mother  thought nothing of this at first, thinking her child was sleep deprived and sick.  However, because Jane continued to get worse, her parents sent her urine to Doctor Barrow of Cambridge, who sent medicine to Jane three separate times thinking it would heal her.  It did not.  After the third time, the Doctor inquired whether there were any signs of sorcery or witchcraft involved that the parents could see. Jane’s urine was then sent to a family acquaintance, Master Butler, for examination and he sent back the same remedies that Doctor Barrow had sent. Exactly a month later, on the same day almost to the hour, two more of Master Throckmorton’s daughters fell sick to the same illness  that was afflicting Jane.&lt;ref name="Anonymous 1593"/&gt;

These daughters, two to three years older than Jane, cried out: "Take her away, look where she standeth here before us in a black thrumbed cap it is she that hath bewitched us and she will kill us if you do not take her away".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anonymous |title=The most strange and admirable discovery of the three Witches of Warboys |location=London |year=1593}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The parents were then worried, but could not understand why any such harm would come to them, for they had only moved into the town the "Michaelmas before" (September 29, 1588).{{citation needed|date=October 2016|reason=quotation}} Their youngest daughter, nine years old, fell sick less than a month later. Soon after this, the oldest daughter, fifteen years old, fell sick. She was sickest out of the five. Both cried out against Alice Samuell. Their eldest sister, having been the strongest, strived with the spirit, and was grievously tortured not being able to overcome it. This caused her to "(neefe), screech and groan very fearfully, sometimes it would heave up her belly and bounce up her body with such violence that she was not kept upon her bed".{{citation needed|date=October 2016|reason=quotation}}   When sitting in a chair, her fits often caused her to break that chair.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The daughters could not see, hear or feel while in these fits. They accused Mother Samuell, asking for her to be taken away. These fits would sometimes last for half a day and happened up to six or seven times a day.  They believed that God freed them of this [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]] and afterwards, the sisters remembered nothing of what they had been saying.{{citation needed|date=October 2016|reason=For all the information in the paragraph}}

===Lady Cromwell===
In March 1590, Lady Cromwell and Alice had a discussion regarding the accusations made against Alice.  During this conversation, Lady Cromwell reportedly grabbed a pair of [[scissors]] and cut a lock of hair off Alice, and gave it to Mrs. Throckmorton to burn (a [[folk tradition|folk]] remedy believed to weaken a witch's power). That night, Lady Cromwell had nightmares, became ill and later died in 1592.&lt;ref name="Luke Matin"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Matin |first1=Luke |title=The Witch Trials – Witches of Warboys Witch Trials |url=http://www.witchcraftandwitches.com/trials_warboys.html|publisher=Luke Matin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial==
Following the death of Lady Cromwell, a local parson convinced Alice to admit to witchcraft, which she retracted the very next day.  However, she confessed again when she was brought before the [[Bishop of Lincoln]], and taken to [[Huntingdon]] where she was imprisoned with her daughter and husband.  The family was tried in April 1593 for the murder by witchcraft of Lady Cromwell. Alice’s words to Lady Cromwell ("Madam, why do you use me thus? I never did you any harm as yet") were used against her at the trial, and all three were found guilty and eventually hanged.&lt;ref name="The Most Strange and Admirable..." /&gt;&lt;ref name="Luke Matin" /&gt;

==Posthumous proof==
The jailer and his wife examined the corpses.
{{quote|[H]e found upon the body of the old woman Alice Samuel a little lump of flesh, in manner sticking out as if it had been a teat, to the length of half an inch; which both he and his wife perceiving, at the first sight thereof meant not to disclose because it was adjoining so secret a place which was not decent to be seen. Yet in the end, not willing to conceal so strange a matter, and decently covering that privy place a little above which it grew, they made open show thereof unto diverse that stood by.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Witch in History: Early Modern and Twentieth-Century Representations |first=Diane |last=Purkiss |publisher=Routledge |year=2013|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Historian Jim Kermode argues that the discovery of a [[witches' mark]] (also known as a "devil's mark") was important legal proof at this period in England. "[I]t gradually became accepted that the mark, with women, most commonly took the form of a teat-like growth in the pudenda".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kermode |first=J.I. |last2=Walker |first2=Garthine |title=Women, crime and the courts in early modern England |date=1994 |publisher=UCL Press |location=London |isbn=1857281403}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This tale of the jailer's postmortem examination has been widely quoted in modern scholarship, for example with reference to the animal/human divide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Creager |editor-first=Angela N.H. |last=Jordan|first=William Chester |title=The animal-human boundary: historical perspectives |date=2002 |publisher=University of Rochester Press |location=Rochester, N.Y |isbn=9781580461207 |page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; the "sado-erotic fascination of the witches' teat",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Words like daggers: violent female speech in early modern England |date=2015 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |location=[S.l.] |isbn=978-0-8032-5488-6 |page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; and particularly in [[feminist interpretations of the Early Modern witch trials]]. It is also cited by writers such as [[Lynn Picknett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Picknett |first1=Lynn |title=The secret history of Lucifer: the ancient path to knowledge and the real Da Vinci code |date=2005 |publisher=Robinson |location=London |isbn=978-1845292638 |edition=Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The scholar [[George Lyman Kittredge|George Kittredge]] (1860–1941) called the Warboys trial "the most momentous witch-trial that had ever occurred in England", partially because it had "demonstrably produced a deep and lasting impression on the class that made laws". He makes a case that the Warboys trial influenced the passage of the [[Witchcraft Acts#Witchcraft Act 1604|Witchcraft Act of 1604]].

Following the hangings, Robert Throckmorton left Warboys hastily, his wife allegedly dying shortly before his departure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=DeWindt |first=Anne |title=Witchcraft and Conflicting Visions of the Ideal Village Community |journal=Journal of British Studies |volume=34 |year=1995 |pages=427–463}} JSTOR.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6374">The '''Yeraz''' people, sometimes called '''Yer-az''' or '''Yerazi''', are an [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijani]] sub-group, also referred to as a [[clan]], consisting of [[Azerbaijanis in Armenia|Azeris originally from present-day]] [[Armenia]].  The term Yeraz in the [[Azerbaijani language|Azeri language]] derives from "Azeri from [[Yerevan]]", and used even if the person does not hail from the city of Yerevan itself.&lt;ref name=e6&gt;[http://www.c-r.org/our-work/accord/nagorny-karabakh/political-glossary.php Political glossary], Conciliation Resources, Accessed January 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to longtime historic tensions between neighboring Armenia and [[Azerbaijan]], virtually all the Yeraz have left Armenia for [[Azerbaijan]] and other countries before tensions exploded with the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]].  Because they developed with some different customs and cuisine from Azeris in Azerbaijan, the Yerazi have maintained a cohesive sub-culture within the country.  Due to tension and cultural differences between Azeris from Azerbaijan and Azeris from Armenia, the term "Yeraz" can be construed as a pejorative.&lt;ref name="e6"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ICG2010&gt;[http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/files/europe/caucasus/azerbaijan/207%20azerbaijan%20-%20vulnerable%20stability.ashx Azerbaijan: Vulnerable Stability], Europe Report N°207, [[International Crisis Group]], September 3, 2010, Accessed January 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|Azerbaijanis in Armenia}}
The Azeri community in Armenia represented a large number but has been virtually non-existent since 1988–1991, when the overwhelming majority of Azeris fled the country as a result of the Nagorno-Karabakh War and the ongoing conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR) estimates the current population of Azeris in Armenia to be somewhere between 30 and a few hundred persons,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecoi.net/file_upload/432_1163080631_pdf-2nd-sr-armenia.pdf Second Report Submitted by Armenia Pursuant to Article 25, Paragraph 1 of the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities]. Received on 24 November 2004&lt;/ref&gt; with majority of them living in rural areas and being members of mixed couples (mostly Azeri women married to [[Armenians|Armenian]] men), as well as elderly and sick, and thus unable to leave the country. Most of them are also reported to have changed their names and maintain a low profile to avoid discrimination.&lt;ref name="unhcr1"&gt;[http://www.ecoi.net/file_upload/470_1162983398_3f5f27d14.pdf International Protection Considerations Regarding Armenian Asylum-Seekers and Refugees].

Released 25 February 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political power==
In Azerbaijan, the Yeraz form a cohesive political clan that, along with the [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhchivani]] clan, has dominated Azerbaijani politics since Soviet times.&lt;ref name=e2&gt;[http://www.europeanforum.net/country/azerbaijan Azerbaijan Update], The European Forum for Democracy and Solidarity, November 24, 2006, ''Accessed Dec. 14, 2006''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=e3&gt;Ben Wetherall, [http://www.globalinsight.com/Perspective/PerspectiveDetail2399.htm Azerbaijan: President Aliyev Asserts His Authority on Eve of Parliamentary Elections], Global Insight, ''Accessed Dec. 14, 2006''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Though born in Nakhchivan, the family of [[Heydar Aliyev]], longtime President of Azerbaijan and father of its current President, originated from Armenia; as a result he essentially had a double-origin and strong political base in Azerbaijan's Western clans.&lt;ref name=e5&gt;[http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/UNTC/UNPAN016499.pdf Azerbaijan: Turning Over a New Leaf?], Europe Report N°156, International Crisis Group, May 12, 2004, ''Accessed Dec. 14, 2006''.&lt;/ref&gt;  As the distribution of power in Azeri politics is based on clan and familial ties,&lt;ref name=e1&gt;Philip Stephens, [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/5543b5aa-46ad-11da-b8e5-00000e2511c8,_i_rssPage=daa36138-ce4f-11d7-81c6-0820abe49a01.html From east to west], ''Financial Times'', October 28, 2005, ''Accessed Dec. 14, 2006''.&lt;/ref&gt; these two Western Azeri clans have pushed other clans from power&lt;ref name="e2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="e5"/&gt; and formed a pyramidal web of patronage built around Nakhichevanis and Yerazi clan groups.&lt;ref name=e4&gt;[http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/index.cfm?action=conflict_search&amp;l=1&amp;t=1&amp;c_country=7 Head of State: President Ilham Aliyev, October 2003-], International Crisis Group, September 22, 2004, ''Accessed Dec. 14, 2006''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The leader of the Yeraz clan is Jalal Aliyev, uncle of Azeri President [[Ilham Aliyev]].&lt;ref name="e1"/&gt;  Ramiz Mehtiev, the head of the President's Executive Body, is another prominent member.&lt;ref name="e5"/&gt;  Before Jalal Aliyev, the unofficial leader of the Yerazi was [[Ali Insanov]], a co-founder of the ruling [[New Azerbaijan Party]] and the former Health Minister of Azerbaijan for 12 years.  Insanov and influential bureaucrat [[Akif Muradverdiyev]] were considered among the most powerful members of the Yerazi clan until they were sacked by President Ilham Aliyev for corruption before the November 2005 parliamentary elections.&lt;ref name="e3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rovshan Ismayilov, [http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/civilsociety/articles/eav102005.shtml Azerbaijan: Two More officials Sacked], Eurasianet, October 20, 2005, ''Accessed Dec. 14, 2006''.&lt;/ref&gt;
