The ASEAN Charter&lt;ref name=Charter&gt;{{cite book|title=The ASEAN Charter |date=Dec 2007 |publisher=ASEAN Secretariat |location=Jakarta |isbn=978-979-3496-62-7 |url=http://www.asean.org/images/2012/publications/ASEAN-Charter.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923185415/http://www.asean.org/images/2012/publications/ASEAN-Charter.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2015-09-23 |accessdate=20 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a constituent instrument of the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN). It was adopted at the 13th ASEAN Summit in November 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-11/22/content_7129449.htm "Indonesian ministers asked to follow up ASEAN summit results"], ''[[Xinhua]]'', 22 Nov 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The intention to draft the Charter had been formally proposed at the 11th [[ASEAN Summit]] held in December 2005 in [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]]. Ten ASEAN leaders, one from each member state, called the [[ASEAN Eminent Persons Group]] (EPG) were assigned to produce recommendations for the drafting of the charter.

At the 12th ASEAN Summit held in January 2007 in [[Cebu]], the [[Philippines]], several basic proposals were made public. ASEAN leaders agreed during the summit to set up a "high level task force on the drafting of the ASEAN Charter" composed of ten high level government officials from the ten member countries. The task force then held 13 meetings during 2007.

==The Charter==
Principles set out in the charter include:
* Emphasis on the centrality of ASEAN in regional co-operation.
* Respect for the principles of [[territorial integrity]], [[sovereignty]], non-interference and national identities of ASEAN members.
* Promoting regional peace and identity, peaceful settlements of disputes through dialogue and consultation, and the renunciation of aggression.
* Upholding international law with respect to [[human rights]], [[social justice]] and multilateral trade.
* Encouraging regional integration of trade.
* Appointment of a [[secretary-general]] and [[permanent representative]]s of ASEAN.
* Establishment of a human rights body and an unresolved dispute mechanism, to be formalized at [[ASEAN Summit]]s.
* Development of friendly external relations and a position with the UN (like the [[European Union|EU]])
* Increasing the number of ASEAN summits to twice a year and the ability to convene for emergency situations.
* Reiterating the use of the ASEAN flag, [[ASEAN Hymn|anthem]], emblem, and national ASEAN day on 8 August.

==Enactment==
The charter came into force in December 2008, thirty days after Thailand's delivery of the final instrument of ratification. Thailand's permanent representative to the United Nations, Ambassador Don Pramudwinai deposited the document with ASEAN Secretary-General, [[Surin Pitsuwan]], at the Thai mission in New York on 14 November. He issued a statement saying, "This is certainly an occasion to celebrate for the 570 million people of ASEAN. This means that when the ASEAN leaders gather at their annual summit in mid December, the ASEAN Charter will have come into force." He was referring to the charter coming into force after the 14th Summit in Chiang Mai, Thailand, from 13–18 December. In doing so he added that celebrations would follow not only for the full ratification of the charter but also the entering into force of the new basic law of ASEAN, "It will be a rules-based and people-oriented organisation with its own legal personality".&lt;ref name="bernama"/&gt;

==Launch==
On 15 December 2008, the members of ASEAN met in the [[Indonesia]]n capital of [[Jakarta]] to launch the charter, signed in November 2007, with the aim of moving closer to "an EU-style community".&lt;ref name=AFPCharter&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gT16o2eXYrGL-35uoUD0fKcRPlDw|title='Momentous' day for ASEAN as charter comes into force|agency=[[Agence France-Presse]]|date=15 Dec 2008|accessdate=16 Dec 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090114201405/https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gT16o2eXYrGL-35uoUD0fKcRPlDw| archivedate= 14 January 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCCharter&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7783073.stm|title=South East Asia to launch charter|author=Lucy Williamson|publisher=BBC|date=15 Dec 2008|accessdate=16 Dec 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081216223650/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7783073.stm| archivedate= 16 December 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charter turned ASEAN into a legal entity and aimed to create a single free-trade area for the region encompassing 600 million people. [[President of Indonesia|Indonesian President]] [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]] stated: "This is a momentous development...ASEAN is...transforming itself into a community. It is achieved while ASEAN seeks a more vigorous role in Asian and global affairs at a time when the international system is experiencing a seismic shift", he added, referring to climate change and economic upheaval. Southeast Asia is no longer the bitterly divided, war-torn region it was in the 1960s and 1970s".

The [[Global financial crisis of 2008|ongoing global financial crisis]] was identified as a threat to the goals envisioned by the charter.&lt;ref name=ReutersCharter&gt;{{cite news|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idINIndia-37031520081215|title=ASEAN launches charter under shadow of crisis|author=Olivia Rondonuwu|author2=Suhartono, Harry|last-author-amp=yes|publisher=Reuters|date=15 Dec 2008|accessdate=16 Dec 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081220192555/http://in.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idINIndia-37031520081215| archivedate= 20 December 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most controversial part of the charter was the proposed human rights body, details of which were to be hammered out at the summit in February 2009. The body would not have the power to impose sanctions or punish countries that violate citizens' rights and would therefore be limited in effectiveness.&lt;ref name=IHTCharter&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/12/15/asia/AS-ASEAN-Charter.php|title=ASEAN charter comes into force|work=International Herald Tribune|date=15 Dec 2008|accessdate=16 Dec 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081218150438/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/12/15/asia/AS-ASEAN-Charter.php| archivedate= 18 December 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="43105">The [[Glass–Steagall Act|Glass–Steagall]] legislation was enacted by the [[United States Congress]] in 1933 as part of the [[1933 Banking Act]], amended as part of the [[1935 Banking Act]], and most of it was repealed in 1999 by the [[Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act]] (GLBA). Its protections and restrictions had also been chipped away during most of its existence by lenient regulatory interpretations and use of loopholes.
After Glass–Steagall's 1999 repeal, there was a great deal of discussion in the banking and securities industries, and among policymakers and economists, about the practical positive and negative changes to the business and consumer environment. Later, as financial crises and other issues played out in the United States and even worldwide, arguments have broken out about whether Glass–Steagall, as originally intended, would have prevented these issues.

==Commentator response to Section 20 and 32 repeal==
President [[Bill Clinton]]'s signing statement for the GLBA summarized the established argument for repealing Glass–Steagall Section's 20 and 32 in stating that this change, and the GLBA's amendments to the  Bank Holding Company Act, would "enhance the stability of our financial services system" by permitting financial firms to "diversify their product offerings and thus their sources of revenue" and make financial firms "better equipped to compete in global financial markets."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Clinton|first=William J.|title=Statement on Signing the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act|work=Public Papers of the Presidents|publisher=The American Presidency Project|date=November 12, 1999|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=56922#axzz1aV0pqgub|accessdate=February 16, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilmarth_2002"/&gt;{{rp|223}}

With Salomon Smith Barney already operating as a Section 20 affiliate of Citibank under existing law, commentators did not find much significance in the GLBA's repeal of Sections 20 and 32.  Many commentators noted those sections "were dead" before the GLBA.&lt;ref name="Lockner_2000_Citi"&gt;{{citation| last1=Lockner| first1=Robert| last2=Hansche| first2=Heather| title=Financial Services Modernization and Corporate Finance| journal=Commercial Lending Review| volume=15| issue=2| pages=36–42| url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-67265844/financial-services-modernization-and.html|accessdate=February 24, 2012| date=March 22, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|37}}&lt;ref name="Macey_2000"&gt;{{citation| last=Macey| first=Jonathan R.| year=2000| title=The Business of Banking: Before and After Gramm-Leach-Bliley| journal=The Journal of Corporation Law| volume=25| issue=4| pages=691–722|url=http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2426&amp;context=fss_papers|accessdate=February 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|691–692,716–718}}&lt;ref name="Wilmarth_2002"/&gt;{{rp|220,222}}

The GLBA's amendment to the Bank Holding Company Act to permit banks to affiliate with insurance underwriting companies was a new power.  Under a 1982 amendment to the Bank Holding Company Act bank affiliates had been prohibited from underwriting most forms of insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last1=Felsenfeld| first1=Carl | last2=Bilali| first2=Genci | title=Business Divisions From The Perspective Of The U.S. Banking System | journal=Houston Business and Tax Law Journal| volume=68| year=2003| page=87|url=http://www.hbtlj.org/v03/v03_felsenfeld.pdf| accessdate=February 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FedRes_2003_glbarptcongress"&gt;{{citation|author=Federal Reserve Board and U.S. Department of the Treasury|title=Report to the Congress on Financial Holding Companies under the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act|publisher=|date=November 2003|pages=46|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/rptcongress/glbarptcongress.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate=February 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}} Because the GLBA permitted banks to affiliate with insurance underwriters, Citigroup was able to retain ownership of the Travelers insurance underwriting business.&lt;ref name="Simpson_1998_Citi"/&gt; Overall, however, commentators viewed the GLBA "as ratifying and extending changes that had already been made, rather than as revolutionary."&lt;ref&gt;Barth et al. 2000, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; At least one commentator found the entire GLBA "unnecessary" for banks and suggested the OCC had the authority to grant national banks all the insurance underwriting powers permitted to affiliates through the GLBA.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher 2001, pp. 1337-1367.&lt;/ref&gt;

As John Boyd had earlier,&lt;ref name="Boyd" /&gt; Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank president [[Gary Stern]] and Arthur Wilmarth warned that the GLBA's permission for broader combinations of banking, securities, and insurance activities could increase the "[[too big to fail]]" problem.&lt;ref name="TBTF"&gt;Stern 2000.  Stern and Feldman 2004, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilmarth_2001"&gt;{{citation| last=Wilmarth, Jr.| first=Arthur E.| year=2001| title=How Should We Respond to the Growing Risks of Financial Conglomerates|journal=Public Law and Legal Theory Working Paper| number=034| pages= 1–89|ssrn=291859}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|22}}&lt;ref name="Wilmarth_2002"/&gt;{{rp|224–225}}

==Financial industry developments after repeal of Sections 20 and 32==

===Citigroup gives up insurance underwriting===

===Banking, insurance, and securities industries remain structurally unchanged===
In November 2003 the Federal Reserve Board and the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]] issued to Congress a report (Joint Report) on the activities of the "financial holding companies" (FHCs) authorized by the GLBA and the effect of mergers or acquisitions by FHCs on market concentration in the financial services industry.&lt;ref name="FedRes_2003_glbarptcongress"/&gt;{{rp|2}} According to the Joint Report, 12% of all bank holding companies had qualified as financial holding companies to exercise the new powers provided by the GLBA, and those companies held 78% of all bank holding company assets.&lt;ref name="FedRes_2003_glbarptcongress"/&gt;{{rp|5}} 40 of the 45 bank holding companies with Section 20 affiliates before 2000 had qualified as financial holding companies, and their securities related assets had nearly doubled.&lt;ref name="FedRes_2003_glbarptcongress"/&gt;{{rp|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The great majority of this increase was at non-U.S. based banks.  Such foreign banking companies had acquired several medium-sized securities firms (such as [[UBS]] acquiring [[Paine Webber]] and [[Credit Suisse]] acquiring [[Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette]]).&lt;ref name="FedRes_2003_glbarptcongress"/&gt;{{rp|9–10}}

Despite these increases in securities activities by bank holding companies that qualified as financial holding companies, the Joint Report found that concentration levels among securities underwriting and dealing firms had not changed significantly since 1999.&lt;ref name="FedRes_2003_glbarptcongress"/&gt;{{rp|34–37}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Rehm| first =Barbara A. | title =IN BRIEF: Fed: Concentration Stable since GLB | newspaper =[[American Banker]]| date =November 19, 2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ranked by capital levels, none of the four largest securities dealing and underwriting firms was affiliated with a financial holding company.&lt;ref name="FedRes_2003_glbarptcongress"/&gt;{{rp|35}} Although the market share of financial holding companies among the 25 largest securities firms had increased by 5.7 percentage points from that held in 1999 before the GLBA became effective, all of the increase came from foreign banks increasing their U.S. securities operations.&lt;ref name="FedRes_2003_glbarptcongress"/&gt;{{rp|35}} The combined market share of the five largest U.S. based financial holding companies declined by 1 percentage point from 1999–2003, with the largest, Citigroup, experiencing a 2.4 percentage point reduction from 1999–2003.&lt;ref name="FedRes_2003_glbarptcongress"/&gt;{{rp|35}} Of the 45 bank holding companies that had operated Section 20 affiliates before the GLBA, 40 had qualified as financial holding companies, 2 conducted securities underwriting and dealing through direct bank subsidiaries (i.e., "financial subsidiaries"), and 3 continued to operate Section 20 affiliates subject to pre-GLBA rules.&lt;ref name="FedRes_2003_glbarptcongress"/&gt;{{rp|8, fn. 15}}

In a speech delivered shortly before the Joint Report was released, Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman [[Roger Ferguson]] stated that the Federal Reserve had "not been able to uncover any evidence that the overall market structure of the [banking, insurance, and securities] segments of the financial services industry has substantially changed" since the GLBA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last=Ferguson, Jr.| first=Roger | author-link=Roger W.

At a July 13, 2004, Senate Banking Committee hearing on the effects of the GLBA five years after passage, the Legislative Director of the [[Consumer Federation]] cited Roger Ferguson's 2003 speech and stated the "extravagant promises" of universal banking had "proven to be mostly hype."  He noted that advocates of repealing Sections 20 and 32 had said "[b]anks, securities firms, and insurance companies would merge into financial services supermarkets" and, after five years, some mergers had occurred "but mostly within the banking industry, not across sectors."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|SBC|2004|p=6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Within the banking industry, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan testified to Congress in 2004 that commercial bank consolidation had "slowed sharply in the past five years."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last=Greenspan| first=Alan | title="The state of the banking industry," Testimony Before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, United States Senate| date=April 20, 2004| page=8|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/testimony/2004/20040420/default.htm|accessdate=February 17, 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the five-year anniversary of the GLBA in November 2004, the [[American Banker]] quoted then retiring Comptroller of the Currency [[John D. Hawke, Jr.]] and former FDIC Chairman [[William Seidman]] as stating the GLBA had been less significant than expected in not bringing about the combinations of banking, insurance, and investment banking.  Hawke described the GLBA provisions permitting such combinations as "pretty much a dead letter."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last1= Blackwell| first1=Rob |last2=Anason|first2=Dean |title=Much Business Unfinished as GLBA Turns Five | newspaper =[[American Banker]]| date=November 15, 2004|page=1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the article noted other commentators expected this would change in 2005, a May 24, 2005, American Banker article proclaimed 2005 the "year of divestiture" as "many observers" described Citigroup's sale of the Travelers life and annuity insurance business as "a nail in the coffin of financial services convergence."&lt;ref name="divest" /&gt;

In 2005 the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank's staff issued a study finding that after five years the GLBA's effects "have been modest" and the new law "simply made it easier for organizations to continue to engage in the activities they had already undertaken."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last1=Harshman| first1=Ellen|last2=Yeager|first2=Fred C.|last3=Yeager|first3=Timothy J.| title=The Door Is Open, but Banks Are Slow To Enter Insurance and Investment Arenas | journal=The Regional Economist|publisher=[[Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis]] | issue=October | year=2005| page=14|url=http://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/re/articles/?id=348|accessdate=February 19, 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Competition between commercial banking and investment banking firms===
Commentators pointed to the [[Enron]], [[WorldCom]], and other corporate scandals of the early 2000s as exposing the dangers of uniting commercial and investment banking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/wallstreet/interviews/cleland.html |title=Interview: Scott Cleland |accessdate=February 19, 2012 |publisher=[[PBS]] | work=[[Hedrick Smith]] interview of Scott Cleland| date=January 21, 2003}} {{harvnb|SBC|2004|pp=54–56}}.&lt;/ref&gt; More broadly, Arthur Wilmarth questioned whether those scandals and the "stock market bubble" of the late-1990s were linked to the growing role of commercial banks in the securities markets during the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Wilmarth_2008"/&gt;{{rp|559,  562–563}} As Wilmarth's article indicated, the identified bank or bank affiliate activities linked to the Enron and World Com corporate scandals began in 1996 (or earlier) and most occurred before March 11, 2000, when bank holding companies could first use the new securities powers the GLBA provided to "financial holding companies."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Subtle Hazards Revisited: The Corruption of a Financial Holding Company by a Corporate Client's Inner Circle |last=Fanto|first=James A. |journal=Brooklyn Law Review|volume=70|issue=1|pages=18–28|year=2004 |ssrn=622161 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilmarth_2008"&gt;{{citation|last=Wilmarth, Jr.|first=Arthur E.|year=2008|chapter=Did Universal Banks Play a Significant Role in the U.S. Economy's Boom-and-Bust Cycle of 1921-33?

In the 1990s investment banks complained that commercial banking firms with Section 20 affiliates had coerced customers into hiring the Section 20 affiliate to underwrite securities in order to receive loans from the affiliated bank, which would have violated the [[tying (commerce)|"anti-tying"]] provisions of the Bank Holding Company Act.  In 1997 the GAO issued a report reviewing those claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=BANK OVERSIGHT: Few Cases of Tying Have Been Detected| issue=GAO/GGD-97-58|series=Report to Congressional Committees|date=May 1997|publisher=United States General Accounting Office| url =http://www.gao.gov/archive/1997/gg97058.pdf| accessdate=February 19, 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After the GLBA became law, investment banks continued to claim such illegal "tying" was being practiced.

At the July 13, 2004, Senate Banking Committee hearing on the GLBA's effects, the [[Securities Industry Association]] representative explained securities firms had not taken advantage of the GLBA's "financial holding company" powers because that would have required them to end affiliations with commercial firms by 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|SBC|2004|pp=16 and 87}}.&lt;/ref&gt; GLBA critics had complained that the law had prevented insurance and securities firms from truly entering the banking business by making a "faulty" distinction between commercial and financial activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Wallison |first=Peter J. |title=The Failure of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act |work=Remarks to Exchequer Club Luncheon |date=December 19, 2001 |url=http://www.aei.org/article/economics/fiscal-policy/the-failure-of-the-gramm-leach-bliley-act/ |accessdate=February 19, 2012 }}. {{Citation|last=Wallison |first=Peter J. |title=Why Has the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Failed |work=Introduction to AEI Event on Banking Reform |date=November 13, 2001 |url=http://aei.org/speech/economics/financial-services/why-has-the-gramm-leach-bliley-act-failed/ |accessdate=February 19, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630172746/http://www.aei.org/speech/economics/financial-services/why-has-the-gramm-leach-bliley-act-failed/ |archivedate=June 30, 2012 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Consumer Federation of America]] and other commentators suggested securities firms had avoided becoming "financial holding companies" because they wanted to avoid Federal Reserve supervision as bank holding companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|SBC|2004|p=53}}.  Heyward 2005, pp. 4-6.&lt;/ref&gt; The SEC (through its Chairman [[Arthur Levitt]]) had supported efforts to permit securities firms to engage in non-FDIC insured banking activities without the Federal Reserve's "intrusive banking-style oversight" of the "overall holding company."&lt;ref&gt;Levitt 1998 ("Market Discipline--not Safety and Soundness Regulation--for Securities Firms).&lt;/ref&gt; After the GLBA became law, securities firms continued (and expanded) their deposit and lending activities through the "unitary thrifts" and "nonbank banks" (particularly industrial loan companies) they had used before the GLBA to avoid regulation as bank holding companies.&lt;ref name="FCIC_2011"/&gt;{{rp|55}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|SBC|2004|p=53}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Alan Greenspan later noted securities firms only took on the "embrace" of Federal Reserve Board supervision as bank holding companies (and financial holding companies) after the financial crisis climaxed in September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Greenspan 2010, p. 29, fn. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Melanie Fein has described how the consolidation of the banking and securities industries occurred in the 1990s, particularly after the Federal Reserve Board's actions in 1996 and 1997 increasing Section 20 "bank-ineligible" revenue limits and removing "firewalls."&lt;ref name="Fein_2011"/&gt;{{rp|§1.09, 1-77 to 1-78}} Fein stated that "[a]lthough the Gramm-Leach-Blily Act was expected to trigger a cascade of new consolidation proposals, no major mergers of banks and securities firms occurred in the years immediately following" and that the "consolidation trend resumed abruptly in 2008 as a result of the financial crisis" leading to all the large investment banks being acquired by, or converting into, bank holding companies.&lt;ref name="Fein_2011"/&gt;{{rp|§1.09, 1–78}} Fein noted the lack of consolidation activity after 1999 and before September 2008 was "perhaps because much of the consolidation had occurred  prior to the Act."&lt;ref name="Fein_2011"/&gt;{{rp|§1.09, 1–78}}

In 2011 the European Central Bank published a working paper that concluded commercial bank Section 20 affiliate underwriting of corporate bonds in the 1990s had been of lower quality than the underwriting of non-commercial bank affiliated securities firms.&lt;ref&gt;Focarelli, Marques-Ibanez, and Pozzolo 2011, pp. 7-8, 13-15, and  22-23.&lt;/ref&gt; The authors suggest the most likely explanation was that commercial bank affiliates "had to be initially more aggressive than investment bank houses in order to gain market share, and in pursuing this objective they might have loosened their credit standards excessively."&lt;ref&gt;Focarelli, Marques-Ibanez, and Pozzolo 2011, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; The working paper only examined corporate bonds underwritten from 1991 through 1999, a period before the GLBA permitted financial holding companies.&lt;ref&gt;Focarelli, Marques-Ibanez, and Pozzolo 2011, pp. 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Glass–Steagall "repeal" and the financial crisis==
[[Robert Kuttner]], [[Joseph Stiglitz]], [[Elizabeth Warren]], Robert Weissman, [[Richard D. Wolff]] and others have tied Glass–Steagall repeal to the [[late-2000s financial crisis]].  Kuttner acknowledged "de facto inroads" before Glass–Steagall "repeal" but argued the GLBA's "repeal" had permitted "super-banks" to "re-enact the same kinds of structural conflicts of interest that were endemic in the 1920s," which he characterized as "lending to speculators, packaging and securitizing credits and then selling them off, wholesale or retail, and extracting fees at every step along the way."&lt;ref name="Kuttner"&gt;{{citation| last=Kuttner| first=Robert | title=The Alarming Parallels Between 1929 and 2007| journal=The [[American Prospect]] | date=October 2, 2007| page=2| url=http://prospect.org/cs/articles?article=the_alarming_parallels_between_1929_and_2007 |accessdate=February 20, 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Stiglitz argued "the most important consequence of Glass–Steagall repeal" was in changing the culture of commercial banking so that the "bigger risk" culture of investment banking "came out on top."&lt;ref name="Stiglitz"&gt;{{citation| last=Stiglitz| first=Joseph E.| title=Capitalist Fools| journal=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] | date=January 2009| page=2| url=http://media.yoism.org/CapitalistFools-Stiglitz.pdf|accessdate=February 20, 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He also argued the GLBA "created ever larger banks that were too big to be allowed to fail," which "provided incentives for excessive risk taking."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Freefall: America, Free Markets, And The Sinking Of The World Economy |last=Stiglitz |first=Joseph E.|year=2010 |publisher=W.W.

[[Lawrence J.

Macey]] and [[Peter J.

[[Martin Mayer]] argued there were "three reasonable arguments" for tying Glass–Steagall repeal to the financial crisis:  (1) it invited banks to enter risks they did not understand; (2) it created "network integration" that increased contagion; and (3) it joined the incompatible businesses of commercial and investment banking.  Mayer, however, then described banking developments in the 1970s and 1980s that had already established these conditions before the GLBA repealed Sections 20 and 32.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| last=Mayer| first=Martin | title=Glass–Steagall in Our Future:  How Straight, How Narrow?|work=Policy Brief 2009-PB-07|date=November  2009| publisher=Networks Financial Institute at Indiana State University|pages=5–11|url=http://www.networksfinancialinstitute.org/Lists/Publication%20Library/Attachments/148/2009-PB-07_Mayer.pdf|accessdate=February 20, 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Mayer's 1974 book  ''The Bankers '' detailed the "revolution in banking" that followed Citibank establishing a liquid secondary market in "negotiable certificates of deposit" in 1961.  This new "liability management" permitted banks to fund their activities through the "capital markets," like nonbank lenders in the "shadow banking market," rather than through the traditional regulated bank deposit market envisioned by the 1933 Banking Act.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer 1974, pp. 192-197.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973 [[Sherman J. Maisel]] wrote of his time on the Federal Reserve Board and described how "[t]he banking system today is far different from what it was even in 1960" as "formerly little used instruments" were used in the "money markets" and "turned out to be extremely volatile."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Managing the Dollar |last=Maisel |first=Sherman J. |year=1973 |publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc. |location=New York |isbn=0-393-05494-2 |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In describing the "transformation of the U.S. financial services industry" from 1975-2000 (i.e., from after the "revolution in banking" described by Mayer in 1974 to the effective date of the GLBA), Arthur Wilmarth described how during the 1990s, despite remaining bank holding companies, [[J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.]] and [[Bankers Trust]] "built financial profiles similar to securities firms with a heavy emphasis on trading and investments."&lt;ref name="Wilmarth_2002"/&gt;{{rp|374}} In 1993, Helen Garten described the transformation of the same companies into "wholesale banks" similar to European "universal banks."&lt;ref&gt;Garten 1993, pp. 169-170 and 182-185.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jan Kregel agrees that "multifunction" banks are a source for financial crises, but he argues the "basic principles" of Glass–Steagall "were eviscerated even before" the GLBA.&lt;ref name="Kregel_2010b"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Kregel| first=Jan| author-link=Jan Kregel| year=2010| title=Can a return to  Glass–Steagall provide financial stability in the US financial system | journal=PSL Quarterly Review|volume=63|issue=252| pages=37–73|ssrn=1810803}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|67}} Kregel describes Glass–Steagall as creating a "monopoly that was doomed to fail" because after World War II nonbanks were permitted to use "capital market activities" to duplicate more cheaply the deposit and commercial loan products for which Glass–Steagall had sought to provide a bank monopoly.&lt;ref name="Kregel_2010a"&gt;{{citation| last=Kregel| first=Jan| author-link=Jan Kregel| year=2010a| title=No Going Back: Why We Can Not Restore Glass–Steagall's Segregation of Banking and Finance| work=Public Policy Brief No. 107|publisher=Levy Economics Institute of Bard College| pages=1–17 |url=http://www.levyinstitute.org/pubs/ppb_107.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate=February 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8–9}}

While accepting that under Glass–Steagall financial firms could still have "made, sold, and securitized risky mortgages, all the while fueling a massive housing bubble and building a highly leveraged, Ponzi-like pyramid of derivatives on top," the [[Institute for Local Self-Reliance|New Rules Project]] concludes that commentators who deny the GLBA played a role in the financial crisis "fail to recognize the significance of 1999 as the pivotal policy-making moment leading up to the crash."  The Project argues 1999 was Congress's opportunity to reject 25 years of "deregulation" and "confront the changing financial system by reaffirming the importance of effective structural safeguards, such as the Glass–Steagall Act's firewall and market share caps to limit the size of banks; bringing shadow banks into the regulatory framework; and developing new rules to control the dangers inherent in derivatives and other engineered financial products."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|NRP|2012|p=3}} ("The Financial Crisis").&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Raj Date]] and Michael Konczal similarly argued that the  GLBA did not create the financial crisis but that the implicit "logical premises" of the GLBA, which included a belief that "non-depository 'shadow banks' should continue to compete in the banking business," "enabled the financial crisis" and "may well have hastened it."&lt;ref name="D&amp;K"&gt;{{citation| last1=Date| first1=Raj|last2=Konczal| first2=Michael| contribution=Out of the Shadows: Creating a 21st Century Glass–Steagall | date=March 2011| title=Make Markets Be Markets| publisher=[[Roosevelt Institute]]| page=61| url=http://makemarketsbemarkets.org/report/MakeMarketsBeMarkets.pdf| accessdate = February 6, 2012}}Date and Konczal 2011, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act''' ('''AETA''') is a [[United States federal law]] ({{uspl|109|374}}; {{usc|18|43}}) that prohibits any person from engaging in certain conduct "for the purpose of damaging or interfering with the operations of an animal enterprise."&lt;ref name="law.cornell.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/43- |title=United States Code: Title 18,43. Force, violence, and threats involving animal enterprises |publisher=Cornell University Law School |work=Legal Information Institute |date= |accessdate=December 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statute covers any act that either "damages or causes the loss of any real or personal property" or "places a person in reasonable fear" of injury.

==Background==

The law amends the Animal Enterprise Protection Act of 1992 ({{uspl|102|346}}) and gives the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] greater authority to target [[animal rights activists]].  The AETA does so by broadening the definition of "animal enterprise" to include academic and commercial enterprises that use or sell animals or animal products. It also increases the existing penalties, includes penalties based on the amount of economic damage caused, and allows animal enterprises to seek restitution. 

The law was originally introduced in the [[109th United States Congress|109th Congress]] by [[Thomas Petri]] (R-WI) and Senators [[Dianne Feinstein]] (D-CA) and [[James Inhofe]] (R-OK).   The final version of the bill, S. 3880.,&lt;ref name="textofbill"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=s109-3880 |title=Text of S. 3880 [109th]: Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act |publisher=GovTrack |date= |accessdate=December 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was passed in the [[United States Senate]] on September 29, 2006, by [[unanimous consent]], a Senate procedure that is used to expedite the passage of non-controversial bills without an actual vote. On November 13, 2006, the House passed the bill under [[suspension of the rules]], a procedure generally used to quickly pass non-controversial bills. The lone dissenting statement was made by Representative [[Dennis Kucinich]], who said that the bill was "written in such a way as to have a [[Chilling effect (law)|chilling effect]] on the exercise of the constitutional rights of protest."&lt;ref name="kucinichcomments"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c-spanarchives.org/congress/?q=node/77531&amp;id=7511162 |accessdate=February 19, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140721010635/http://www.c-spanarchives.org/congress/?q=node%2F77531&amp;id=7511162 |archivedate=July 21, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither Rep. Kucinich nor any other members of the House of Representatives called for a recorded vote; the bill passed with a voice vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/109th-congress/senate-bill/3880/actions?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22PL109-374%22%5D%7D&amp;resultIndex=1|title=Actions - S.3880 - 109th Congress (2005-2006): Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act {{!}} Congress.gov {{!}} Library of Congress|last=|first=|date=|website=Actions - S.3880 - 109th Congress (2005-2006): Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act {{!}} Congress.gov {{!}} Library of Congress|publisher=Library of Congress|access-date=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was signed by President George W. Bush on November 27, 2006. Earlier versions of the bill were known as S. 1926 and H.R. 4239.&lt;ref name="earlyleg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h109-4239 |title=Text of H.R. 4239 [109th]: Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act |publisher=GovTrack |date=November 4, 2005 |accessdate=December 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill is described by the author as being intended to "provide the Department of Justice the necessary authority to apprehend, prosecute, and convict individuals committing animal enterprise terror."&lt;ref name="textofbill"/&gt;

==Savings clause==

The law contains a [[savings clause]] that indicates it should not be construed to "prohibit any expressive conduct (including peaceful picketing or other peaceful demonstration) protected from legal prohibition by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment to the Constitution]]." &lt;ref name="law.cornell.edu"/&gt; However, by its own terms, the statute criminalizes acts such as "intimidation." And prosecutions under AETA require using evidence of otherwise lawful free speech in order to demonstrate a "course of conduct" as proof of purpose or possible conspiracy.&lt;ref name="NYC Bar Association Letter"&gt;{{cite web|title=Re: The Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act, 18 U.S.C. § 43|url=http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/files/aeta_animalcivilrights_letter072109.pdf|publisher=New York City Bar|accessdate=|date=July 22, 2009|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reaction ==

The Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act was overwhelmingly embraced by the pharmaceutical industry. The [[National Association for Biomedical Research]] (NABR) lauded the passage of the bill stating, "Today, the AETA provides greater protection for the biomedical research community and their families against intimidation and harassment, and addresses for the first time in federal law, campaigns of secondary and tertiary targeting that cause economic damage to research enterprises."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nabr.org/animal-activism/animal-enterprise-terrorism-act-aeta.aspx ]{{dead link|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animal welfare and civil liberties groups, however, largely opposed the passage of the legislation. Camille Hankins, a representative of Win Animal Rights, asserted that the legislation infringed upon the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights of free speech and assembly: "It's overly broad, overly vague and restricts freedom of speech and freedom of assembly."&lt;ref name="alpa"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mitchell |first=Steve |url=http://www.upi.com/HealthBusiness/view.php?StoryID=20061114-045942-5048r |title=Analysis: Bill targets animal activists |publisher=UPI |date=November 14, 2006 |accessdate=December 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She added: "I think this legislation was bought and paid for, by the pharmaceutical industry primarily." However, [[Jerry Vlasak]], spokesman for the North American Animal Liberation Press Office, suggested the bill would have little impact on the movement because underground activists "don't really care about those laws" and law enforcement agencies had already "gone after" effective above-ground activists. The [[American Kennel Club]], a dog breeding organization, endorsed the bill, because it contains "explicit language" which protects the right of protesters to engage in "peaceful [[Picketing (protest)|picketing]] or other peaceful demonstration."&lt;ref name="akc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akc.org/news/blocks/print_article.cfm?article_id=3057 |title=The Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act Passes the House of Representatives |publisher=American Kennel Club |date=November 13, 2006 |accessdate=December 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) did not oppose the bill, but expressed concerns that "minor changes [were] necessary to make the bill less likely to chill or threaten freedom of speech."&lt;ref name="aclu"&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/safefree/general/27356leg20061030.html American Civil Liberties Union : ACLU Letter to the House of Representatives Regarding the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The ACLU requested that the bill be amended to define what was meant by "real or personal property," to narrow the definition of "animal enterprise," and to substantially reduce penalties for conspiracy convictions under the statute. The particular changes proposed by the ACLU are not present in the final version of the AETA.

On March 18, 2013, U.S. District Judge Joseph Tauro dismissed the lawsuit five animal rights activists filed to challenge the AETA for criminalizing what they called protected First Amendment speech. Judge Tauro decided that the activists did not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the AETA.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Phillips, [http://activistdefense.wordpress.com/2013/03/19/federal-judge-dismisses-lawsuit-challenging-the-animal-enterprise-terrorism-act/ "Federal Judge Dismisses Lawsuit Challenging the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act"], Activist Defense, March 19, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; On April 17, 2013, the activists’ attorneys at the [[Center for Constitutional Rights]] appealed.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Constitutional Rights, [http://ccrjustice.org/newsroom/press-releases/rights-group-appeals-dismissal-of-federal-animal-rights-%E2%80%9Cterrorism%E2%80%9D-challenge "Rights Group Appeals Dismissal of Federal Animal Rights 'Terrorism' Challenge"], April 17, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criminal prosecutions ==

The bill was passed in response to the then-ongoing prosecution of members of [[Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty]] (SHAC), an activist group that worked to close animal testing laboratories. Six members of the group were charged and put on trial for a "multi-faceted" and decentralized grassroots activist campaign against [[Huntingdon Life Sciences]]. While there was no proof that the actual defendants committed or had any knowledge of the overwhelming majority of the illegal acts at issue, they were convicted under the AETA’s conspiracy provisions. On appeal, the Third Circuit upheld the convictions because the defendants’ membership in the group, participation in political protests, as well as unrelated speeches, interviews, publications, and internet postings constituted "sufficient circumstantial evidence" for a jury to infer a conspiracy.&lt;ref name="US v. Fullmer"&gt;http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/064211p.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; One defendant was convicted for providing "technical assistance" for the group’s website because the website was then used by others to organize unlawful acts. At least one of the defendants was placed in an exceptionally restrictive [[Communication Management Unit]], reserved for inmates the government considers terrorist threats.&lt;ref name="The Balancer"&gt;{{cite web|last=Stewart |first=Christopher S. |url=http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2011/07/little_gitmo_author_speaks_to.html |title=The Balancer: Animal-Rights Activist Andrew Stepanian Talks About His Time Inside ‘Little Gitmo’ |work=Daily Intel |publisher=New York Magazine |date=July 15, 2011 |accessdate=December 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, four individuals were indicted under the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act for alleged harassment, intimidation, and violent acts at the homes of professors conducting research involving animal testing. While the charges were eventually dismissed, the defendants were placed under house arrest for almost a year.&lt;ref name="US v. Buddenberg"&gt;[http://cldc.org/PDFs/aeta4_dismissal.pdf Order Dismissing Indictment Without Prejudice and Denying as Moot Other Pending Motions.]&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI alleges that these individuals were part of groups engaged in trespassing, attempted forcible entry of a private residence, and distribution of leaflets that resulted in the firebombing of two residences. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.fbi.gov/sanfrancisco/press-releases/2009/sf022009.htm/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Arms Act, 1878''' is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of India]] to consolidate and amend the law relating to arms and ammunition in order to curb illegal weapons and violence stemming from them.

The Arms Act was passed in 1959 which made it impossible for most Indians to own weapons to ensure that if there were another Indian uprising, it would be less effective (for O level students)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unodc.org/tldb/showDocument.do?documentUid%3D6926 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105001553/https://www.unodc.org/tldb/showDocument.do?documentUid=6926 |archivedate=5 November 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current affairs==
The Act has undergone many changes since 1959, the most recent being in 2010 through an amendment for the Arms Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/newdelhi/cabinet-approves-tougher-provisions-for-arms-act/article1-572716.aspx |title=Cabinet approves tougher provisions for Arms Act |work=[[Hindustan Times]] |date=15 July 2010 |accessdate=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also controversy around air guns to be included as part of this act which was rejected by the Supreme Court of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Shreyas |last=Sharma |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/supreme-court-stays-order-classifying-air-guns-as-firearms/1/167363.html |title=Supreme Court stays order classifying air guns as firearms |location=New Delhi, India |date=5 January 2012 |work=India Today |accessdate=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Previous legislation==
The [[Indian Arms Act, 1878]] was an act regulating the manufacture, sale, possession, and carry of [[firearms]].

Prior to the Indian First War Of Independence in 1857, there were few gun control laws in India.&lt;ref&gt;https://statutory-law.knoji.com/gun-control-and-indian-arms-act-1877-during-the-days-of-the-raj/&lt;/ref&gt;

The act included the mandatory licensing to carry a weapon, but contained exclusions for some groups and persons, for instance "all persons of [[Kodava people|Kodava]] ([[Coorg]]) race".&lt;ref name="(India)Rattigan1897"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Punjab (India)|author2=Sir Henry Adolphus Byden Rattigan|author3=Alweyne Turner|author4=North-west Frontier Province (India)|title=The Bengal regulations: the acts of the governor-general in council, and the frontier regulations ... applicable to the Punjab, with notes and an index|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gQobAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1189|accessdate=22 July 2011|year=1897|publisher=Civil and Military Gazette Press|pages=1189–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1918 recruitment leaflet for [[World War I]], [[Gandhi]] voiced disapproval of the act:&lt;ref&gt;http://wagingnonviolence.org/feature/what-gandhi-really-thought-about-guns/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“Among the many misdeeds of the British rule in India, history will look upon the Act depriving a whole nation of arms as the blackest. If we want the Arms Act to be repealed, if we want to learn the use of arms, here is a golden opportunity. If the middle classes render voluntary help to Government in the hour of its trial, distrust will disappear, and the ban on possessing arms will be withdrawn.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''[[The New Cambridge History of India]]: Science, Technology and Medicine in Colonial India'', scholar David Arnold examines the effect of the [[British Raj]] on Indian weapons, mining and metallurgy:&lt;ref name=Arnold&gt;Arnold, 100-101&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|align=center|The British were aware of the part metal-working had played in supporting indigenous powers in the past through the production of arms and ammunition, and, just as they introduced an Arms Act in 1878 to restrict Indian access to firearms, so they sought to limit India’s ability to mine and work metals that might sustain it in future wars and rebellions. This was especially the case with [[Rajasthan]], a region rich in metals. In the 1820s [[James Tod]] identified the ‘mines of [[Mewar]]’ as one of the means that had enabled its masters ‘so long to struggle against superior power, and to raise those magnificent structures which would do honour to the most potent kingdoms of the west’. Indian skill in the difficult art of casting brass cannon had made Indian artillery a formidable adversary from the reign of Akbar to the [[Anglo-Maratha wars|Maratha]] and [[Anglo-Sikh wars|Sikh]] wars 300 years later. But by the early 19th century most of the mines in Rajasthan had been abandoned: the caste of miners was ‘extinct’.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14123">The '''Assize of Arms of 1181''' was a proclamation of [[Henry II of England|King Henry II of England]] concerning the obligation of all freemen of England to possess and bear arms in the service of king and realm and to swear allegiance to the king, on pain of "vengeance, not merely on their lands or chattels, but on their limbs". The assize stipulated precisely the military equipment that each man should have according to his rank and wealth. The assize effectively revived the old Anglo‐Saxon [[fyrd]] duty. The Assize established restrictions on weapon ownership by [[Jew]]s, terms of [[inheritance]], and [[Export control|prohibition of exports]] of arms, ships and timber.

==Text of the Assize of Arms==
The Act reads as follows:

{{quote|THE ASSIZE OF ARMS (1181)

# Whoever possesses one [[knight's fee]] shall have a [[Chainmail|shirt of mail]], a helmet, a shield, and a [[lance]]; and every knight shall have as many shirts of mail, helmets, shields, and lances as he possesses knight's fees in demesne.{{#tag:ref|That is to say, as many knights as remain charged against his demesne; cf. no. 36.|group="note"}}
# Moreover, every free layman who possesses chattels or rents to the value of 16m. shall have a shirt of mail, a helmet, a shield, and a lance; and every free layman possessing chattels or rents to the value of 10m. shall have a hauberk, an iron cap, and a lance.{{#tag:ref|Presumably less elaborate armour than that required of the other group.|group="note"}}
# Item, all burgesses and the whole community of freemen shall have [each] a [[gambeson]],{{#tag:ref|A padded surcoat.|group="note"}} an iron cap, and a lance.
# Besides, each of them shall swear to have these arms before the feast of [[Pope Hilarius|St. Hilary]], to be faithful to the lord [[Henry II of England|king Henry]] — namely, the son of the [[Empress Matilda]] — and to bear these arms in his service according to his command and in fealty to the lord king and [[Kingdom of England|his kingdom]]. And henceforth no one having these arms shall sell them or pledge them or lend them or alienate them in any other way; nor shall a lord in any way alienate them from his men, either through forfeiture or through gift or through pledge or in any other way.
# If any one having these arms dies, his arms shall remain to his heir. If, however, the heir is not of age to use arms in time of need, that person who has wardship over him shall also have custody of the arms and shall find a man who can use the arms in the service of the lord king until the heir is of age to bear arms, and then he shall have them.
# Any burgess who has more arms than he ought to have by this assize shall sell them, or give them away, or in some way alienate them to such a man as will keep them for the service of the lord king of England. And none of them shall keep more arms than he ought to have by this assize.
# Item, no Jew shall keep in his possession a shirt of mail or a [[hauberk]], but he shall sell it or give it away or alienate it in some other way, so that it shall remain in the king's service.
# Item, no one shall carry arms out of England except by the command of the lord king: no one is to sell arms to another to carry out of England; nor shall a merchant or any other man [[Arms industry|carry them out of England]].
# Item, the justices shall have [a report] sworn by lawful knights, or by other free and lawful men of the hundreds and neighbourhoods and boroughs — as many as they see fit to employ — as to what persons possess chattels to the amount that they should have a shirt of mail, a helmet, a lance, and a shield according to what has been provided; so that they shall separately name for those [justices] all men of their hundreds and neighbourhoods and boroughs who are worth 16m. in either chattels or rents, and likewise those who are worth 10m. And then the justices shall have written down [the names of] all those jurors and other men, [recording] how much in chattels or rents they [each] have and what arms, according to the value of the chattels or rents, they should [each] have. Then, in their presence and in a common assembly of those men, they shall have read this assize regarding the possession of arms, and they shall have those men swear to have arms according to the value of the aforesaid chattels or rents, and to keep them for the service of the lord king according to this aforesaid assize, under the command of and in fealty to the lord king Henry and his kingdom. If, moreover, it should happen that any one of them, who ought to have these arms, is not in the county during the period when the justices are in that county, the justices shall set a time for him [to appear] before them in another county. And if he does not come to them in any county through which they are to go, and is not in that land [at all], they shall set him a time at [[Westminster]] toward the [[Octave (liturgical)|octave]] of [[Michaelmas|St. Michael]]; so that, as he loves his life and all that he has, he shall be there for swearing his oath. And they shall command him, before the aforesaid feast of St. Hilary, to have arms according to the obligation resting on him.
# Item, the justices shall have proclamation made in the counties through which they are to go that, with respect to those who do not have such arms as have been specified above, the lord king will take vengeance, not merely on their lands or chattels, but on their limbs.
# Item, no one who does not possess 16m. [as specified above] or 10m. in [[Personal property|chattels]] is to swear concerning free and lawful men.
# Item, the justices shall command through all the counties that no one, as he loves his life and all that he has, shall buy or sell any ship to be taken away from England, and that no one shall carry any timber or [[Autarky|cause it to be carried out]] of England. And the lord king commands that no one shall be received for the oath concerning arms unless he is a [[Freeman (Colonial)|freeman]].}}

==Background==

Henry II came from a [[Normans|Norman]] line of kings and inherited the kingship of England which had fallen into Norman hands after the [[Battle of Hastings]] in 1066.

England had been a unified nation for only a short time prior to this. It had been successfully invaded and conquered with military power from [[Rome|Roman Empire]], with periodic incursions from [[Gaul]], over about 400 years. This was followed with periodic waves of [[Viking]] invasions. It was not until the end of the first millennium that England had become unified by the conjoining of various local kingdoms and defeat of the many kingdoms in Northern and Eastern England paying [[Danegeld]] and having some ties (which became quite loose over time) to Viking kings on the continent. It is not clear cut who was the first King of England. [[Offa]] and [[Athelstan]] are strong candidates. History would have told Henry of the earlier Viking invasions along the [[North Sea]], the [[English Channel]] (including [[Normandy]]) and the [[Irish Sea]] ([[Ireland]] and [[Wales]]). Because his immediate ancestors had themselves conquered England, he was well aware of the potential for external threats to his kingdom, as well as the more common risk of divided loyalties among those beneath him.

The Norman invasion of 1066 led to the introduction to England of a very structural form of [[feudalism]]. This was a strong social hierarchy with the king at its apex with most people owing [[fealty]] to another. The Norman and Viking armies had been very loose gatherings of fighting men, and [[looting]] and [[pillage]] was common among them, and therefore, as far as their kings were concerned, had only loose loyalties to them. Their armies did not match the power, might and discipline of the Roman army that had been formed a thousand years earlier.

The power of the Norman kings ruling at that time in England was not founded on any form of standing army.  If a king needed to raise forces this would often have to be [[mercenary]] forces paid for by the king or his followers. The Assize of Arms needs to be seen in this context. Although it did not create a [[standing army]] in the modern sense, it did lay down conditions which would enable the King to call up a fighting force at any time which would be adequately armed to preserve the social order within the country and to ward off any external threat, and did not require any formal form of taxation to achieve this.

==Connection to the English and American Bills of Rights==
Some in the United States have claimed that the Assize of Arms is an ancient ''right'' to bear arms, though this claim is disputed,&lt;ref name="lawreview"/&gt; noting that the Assize of Arms was an obligation, not a right (i.e., a choice). The Supreme Court of the United States ruling in ''[[District of Columbia v. Heller]]'' regarding the right to bear arms referred only to the English [[Bill of Rights of 1689]] as precedent.

Some have asserted that the Assize of Arms is part of the legal basis for the [[English Bill of Rights]] and the [[right to keep and bear arms]] mentioned in the United States Bill of Rights (specifically in the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution]]&lt;ref name="isbn0-208-02423-9"&gt;{{cite book |author=Weir, William |title=A well regulated militia |publisher=Archon Books |location=Hamden, Conn |year=1997 |page=5 |isbn=978-0-208-02423-7 |oclc=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-253-35159-6"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Ely, James W. |author2=Bodenhamer, David J. |title=The Bill of Rights in modern America |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Bloomington |year=2008 |page=73 |isbn=978-0-253-35159-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Hannis|year=1911|title=The origin and growth of the American Constitution|location=Boston|publisher=Houghton Mifflin |page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-8153-1666-6"&gt;{{cite book |author=Cottrol, Robert J. |title=Gun control and the Constitution: sources and explorations on the Second Amendment |publisher=Garland Pub |location=New York |year=1994 |page= xii|isbn=978-0-8153-1666-4 |oclc=}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

The Assize of Arms did not describe an ancient legal or political individual right to arms, rather the Assize of Arms represented an imposed responsibility on subjects.&lt;ref name="lawreview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawreview.kentlaw.edu/articles/76-1/Schwoerer%20macro2.pdf |title=To Hold And Bear Arm: The English Perspective |accessdate= |author=Schwoerer, Lois G. |year=2000 |publisher=Chicago-Kent Law Review |quote=There was no ancient political or legal precedent for the right to arms. The Ancient Constitution did not include it; it was neither in Magna Charta 1215 nor in the Petition of Right 1628. No early English government would have considered giving the individual such a right. Through the old militia laws —Henry II's Assize of Arms (1181) and Edward I's Statute of Winchester (1285)— early governments had imposed a responsibility on subjects, according to their income, to be prepared |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080318224258/http://lawreview.kentlaw.edu/articles/76-1/Schwoerer%20macro2.pdf |archivedate=2008-03-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in ''District of Columbia v. Heller'' was presented by the petitioners with written evidence that Assize of Arms merely marked the beginning of the militia system in England. It claimed that a lower court's citation of the English Bill of Rights of 1689 as a source of a preexisting right had "misinterpreted it to guarantee a private right to possess guns, when it rather laid down the right of a class of citizens, Protestants, to take part in the military affairs of the realm. Nowhere was an individual’s right to arm in self-defense guaranteed." The court's final judgement on the right to bear arms concluded that the writers of the second amendment had intended to create such a right, based on the early settlers experience and on the English Bill of Rights. However the court made no judgement on whether the right dated back to the Assize of Arms.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/07pdf/07-290.pdf Supreme Court finding in District of Columbia v. Heller.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout its long history, the action of assumpsit has been used to enforce what are now referred to as obligations arising in [[tort]], [[contract]], and (in some common law jurisdictions) [[unjust enrichment]]. Most significantly, it is out of the law relating to the action of assumpsit that the modern law of [[contract]] and of [[unjust enrichment]] emerged in the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries.

== History ==

=== Fragmentation of actions for breach of agreement ===
In the early days of the English common law, agreements were enforced in local courts. Where one wished to enforce an agreement in the royal courts, it was necessary to fit one's claim within a [[form of action]]. In the 13th and 14th centuries the forms of action for the enforcement of agreements were covenant, debt, detinue, and account.&lt;ref&gt;See generally, [[John Baker (legal historian)|Sir John Baker]], ''An Introduction to English Legal Histor''y (4th ed, 2004); [[David Ibbetson|Professor David Ibbetson]], ''Historical Introduction to the Law of Obligations'' (2nd ed).&lt;/ref&gt; These were all writs in the ''praecipe'' form, meaning that they commanded the defendant to perform an act: for example, to keep a promise; to yield up a sum of money or chattel unjustly withheld; or to render accounts.

These actions were subject to various limitations. For example, by the middle of the 14th century at the latest, it was necessary for a plaintiff in an action of covenant to have a deed.&lt;ref&gt;''Waltham Carrier Case'' (1321) Eyre of London&lt;/ref&gt; In an action of debt ''sur contract'', a deed was not necessary, but a defendant was able to [[Wager of law|wage his law]] and the sum claimed had to be a sum certain fixed at the date of contract. Such rules could easily work hardship. What if a promisor (A) orally agreed to supply grain to a promisee (B), but failed to do so? In such a case, B would be unable to bring a writ of trespass due to the absence of a deed. B would instead bring debt ''sur contract'', bringing a number of transaction witnesses. But what if A elected wager of law and simply hired his eleven oath-helpers?

=== Emergence of assumpsit ===
Litigants began to turn from the ''praecipe'' writs of covenant and debt to the ''ostensurus quare'' writ of [[Trespass in English law|trespass]]. By the middle of the 14th century the royal courts were recognising that a writ of trespass would lie even without an allegation that the defendant had acted ''vi et armis contra pacem regis'' (with force and arms against the King's Peace).&lt;ref&gt;[[The Humber Ferryman's case|The Humber Ferryman's Case]] (1348) B&amp;M 358&lt;/ref&gt; This action became known as [[trespass on the case]].

To bring the claim within trespass on the case, the plaintiff would characterise the defendant's breach of agreement as a wrong. During the 15th century, the received learning was that an action on the case did not lie for mere inaction ("nonfeasance").&lt;ref&gt;''Wootton v Brygeslay'' (1400); ''Watkin's Case'' (1425)&lt;/ref&gt; By the beginning of this 16th century, this was no longer the case. Provided a plaintiff could show that the defendant was guilty of misfeasance, deceit, or the plaintiff had made a pre-payment, the plaintiff could bring assumpsit for nonfeasance.

By the beginning of the 16th century lawyers recognised a distinct species of action on the case known as assumpsit, which had become the typical phrase in the pleadings.&lt;ref&gt;[[A. W. B. Simpson|AWB Simpson]], ''A History of the Common Law of Contract'' at 199; [[John Baker (legal historian)|Sir John Baker]], ''An Introduction to English Legal History'' (4th ed, 2004) 330.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Assumpsit in lieu of debt ===
The question that arose in the 16th century was whether assumpsit could be brought in lieu of debt.&lt;ref&gt;See generally, Professor David Ibbetson, ''Historical Introduction to the Law of Obligations'' (2nd ed).&lt;/ref&gt; For a plaintiff, assumpsit was the more desirable course: the defendant would not be able to elect to [[Wager of law|wage his law]] as he would in debt ''sur contract''.

In order to bring assumpsit, the plaintiff would plead that, the defendant being indebted to the plaintiff, the defendant had later promised to pay the debt. In short, the plaintiff would separate the existence of the debt (which generated an action of debt ''sur contract'') from a promise to pay the debt (which would generate an assumpsit for nonfeasance). This form of pleading gave rise to the name of the action: ''indebitatus assumpsit''.&lt;ref&gt;The Latin phrase means "being indebted, he promised," or, more literally, "he undertook" or "he assumed the duty [to pay]."&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of the [[Court of King's Bench (England)|King's Bench]] and the [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]] differed during the course of the 16th century. In the King's Bench, it was not necessary for the plaintiff to prove the subsequent promise. The Common Pleas disagreed. Matters came to a head in ''[[Slade's Case]]'' in 1602. The case effectively established that assumpsit could be used in lieu of debt: the law would imply a promise to pay the debt from the existence of the debt itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/maitland-formsofaction.html
 | title=The Forms of Action at Common Law
 | accessdate=2007-07-06
 | author=Maitland, F. W.
 | authorlink=Frederic William Maitland
 | year=1909
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Slade's Case'' effectively put an end to the use of debt ''sur contract'', and with it wager of law. Of course, it was not possible to bring assumpsit where the proper action was debt ''sur obligation'' (that is, debt on a deed or bond).

=== Common counts ===
Claims in actions of assumpsit can be divided into:
* (a) common or ''indebitatus assumpsit'', brought usually on an implied promise, and 
* (b) special or express assumpsit, founded on an express promise.&lt;ref name="EB 1911, p. 787"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also {{cite book |first=Lionel D |last=Smith |display-authors=etal |title=The Law of Restitution in Canada: Cases, Notes, and Materials |pages=72–75 |publisher=Emond Montgomery |year=2004 |isbn=1552391167 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CIvr-XmBRBwC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;dq=%22indebitatus+assumpsit%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=z7AuDbC8SR&amp;sig=rLdEe_zYyLJyEjZ0i9yoyeM1nuE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=UoSoSeD8DMiLngeu5JjeDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ct=result}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Where a plaintiff brought assumpsit in lieu of debt ''sur contract'', it was necessary for the plaintiff to specify how the antecedent debt had arisen. It was insufficient for the plaintiff to merely allege that, being indebted, the defendant promised to pay. This gave rise to the "common counts": common ways of pleading how the debt arose. It is important to note that where assumpsit was brought in lieu of debt, the plaintiff's action was for a liquidated sum. In contrast, where a plaintiff brought special assumpsit, the action was for an unliquidated sum assessed by the civil jury.

Examples of the common counts include:
* For goods sold ("[[Quantum valebant|quantum valebat]]");
* For work done ("[[quantum meruit]]");
* For money lent;
* For money due on an account stated;
* For money laid out to the use of the defendant; and
* For [[Money had and received|money had and received to the defendant's use]].
By the 18th and 19th centuries, the action of assumpsit was used to enforce both contractual and [[quasi-contract]]ual claims. The recognition in ''Slade's Case'' that the law would import or imply a promise to pay the debt paved the way for other implications. 
* In some cases, such as actions for a reasonable remuneration for services provided to the defendant at the defendant's request (a ''quantum meruit''), the implication might be a true reflection of reality. If so, in modern terms, this is simply an action in contract for breach of an implied term.
* In other cases, however, the implication of a promise to pay was wholly fictitious. For example, where A mistakenly paid money to B, A would bring an action for [[Money had and received|money had and received to the defendant's use]]. In such a case, the law would imply a promise by B to pay the debt. In modern terms, this is an action in [[English unjust enrichment law|unjust enrichment]]: B is enriched by the receipt of money at the expense of A in circumstances which are 'unjust' (viz., that A's intention to benefit B is vitiated by the mistake).

== Abolition of the forms of action ==
The ''Common Law Procedure Act 1852'' abolished the common law forms of action in [[England and Wales]]. Furthermore, assumpsit as a form of action became obsolete in the [[United Kingdom]] after the passing of the [[Judicature Acts]] of 1873 and 1875.&lt;ref name="EB 1911, p. 787"/&gt;

In the [[United States]], assumpsit, like the other forms of action, became obsolete in the [[United States federal courts|federal courts]] after the adoption of the ''[[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]]'' in 1938.  Thirty-five states have moved to rules similar to the FRCP (see [[Civil procedure in the United States]]), which have replaced the various forms of action with the [[civil action]].  However, many states continue to recognize assumpsit as a common law or [[Statute|statutory]] [[cause of action]] or allow the use of the old "common counts" as causes of action.  For example, California has a special "common counts" cause of action form (to be attached to an optional form complaint) based directly on the old common counts that were pleaded in assumpsit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/forms/documents/pldc0012.pdf Form PLD-C-001(2), Cause of Action-Common Counts, Judicial Council of California (Rev. Jan. 1, 2009).]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern significance ==
The traces of the law relating to assumpsit are still felt today, particularly in the law of [[contract]] and [[unjust enrichment]]. For example, [[Consideration in English law|consideration]] is only necessary in relation to [[simple contract]]s. Where a claimant brings an action in contract for non-performance of a promise contained in a deed, there is no need to show that the claimant supplied consideration for the promise. The reason for this is historical: where there was no deed, the correct action was assumpsit for nonfeasance; in the latter, in debt ''sur obligation''. These were two distinct forms of action with their own distinct procedural requirements.

In the [[English unjust enrichment law|law of unjust enrichment]], reference is still made to [[Money had and received|actions for money had and received]] and [[quantum meruit]]. The practice is often deprecated by English unjust enrichment scholars&lt;ref&gt;See Andrew Burrows, ''Law of Restitution'' (3rd ed, 2011); Graham Virgo, ''Principles of the Law of Restitution'' (3rd ed, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; but is frequently encountered in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{cite AustLII|NSWCA|81|2016|litigants=Fistar v Riverwood Legion and Community Club Ltd |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3560">[[Image:Hogsta domstolen Stockholm.jpg|thumb|300px|'''The Supreme Court''' ([[Högsta Domstolen]]) in Stockholm, Sweden, where the case was handled.]]

'''Bibeltemplet''' (the Bible temple) is a [[Christian]] [[website]] in [[Sweden]], whose administrator Leif Liljeström was sentenced in April 2005 to two months in prison for holding and expressing critical views on [[homosexuality]]. The case was appealed twice, and the [[Supreme Court of Sweden]] acquitted Liljeström in November 2007.

==Court of first instance==
According to the lower court in 2005, the administrator was guilty of "incitement against a group of people" for statements he himself had written, and for crime against "the law on [[Internet forum|electronic bulletin boards]]", for guest-messages which he neglected to delete. Liljeström told the court that his purpose is to preach the [[gospel]] and win people for [[Jesus]], and that the truth is needed to awake people. Among the statements that led to the verdict were the following: "The modern homophilia is the source and engine behind the [[AIDS]]-epidemic", and "AIDS is a punishment from [[God]] against [[sodomy]]". The view that there should be a "[[death penalty]] for homosexual acts" was also uttered on the website by a guest, but that was repudiated by Leif Liljeström directly in the forum. Still, he was convicted to prison also for the guest's statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2005/5/prweb239651.htm |title=Prison For {{sic|nolink=y|Critizism|expected=Criticism}} Against Homosexuality |publisher= [[PRWeb]] |date=2005-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71410.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appeals Court==
In April 2006, an appeals court in [[Gothenburg]] acquitted Liljestrom of the hate-speech and website content charges, but found him guilty of being an accomplice to hate-speech for allowing third parties to post offensive material on his website. The appeals court sentenced Liljestrom to one month's imprisonment.

==The Supreme Court==
Liljestrom then filed an appeal to the Gothenburg court decision. The Supreme Court in [[Stockholm]] decided to accept the case, and on November 7, 2007, after more than four years of struggle (counting from the day he was reported to the police in October, 2003), he was finally acquitted of all charges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelocal.se/9026/20071107/ The Local: "Christian web editor cleared of hate speech"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Ruth Gledhill]] |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article2825811.ece |title=Christian web editor in gay row wins appeal |date=2007-11-07 |work=[[The Times]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case has many similarities with the case of [[Åke Green]], and is expected to be seen as a guideline for coming justice in Sweden.

“'''Brooke Amendment'''” is the common name for section 213 (a) of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1969 (Public Law 91-152) that was sponsored by Senator [[Edward Brooke III]] (R-MA), which capped rent in [[public housing]] projects at 25% of tenant’s income.  It amended section 2(1), paragraph two, of the US [[Housing Act of 1937]], and was enacted on [[Christmas Eve]], 24 December 1969.&lt;ref name="HUD Act 69"&gt;{{cite web|title=Housing and urban development act of 1969 ;Public law 91-152 and section-by-section summary.|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.a0000107235;view=1up;seq=4|website=Hathi Trust|publisher=Washington :|accessdate=3 May 2017|date=1 January 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HUD.gov"&gt;{{cite web|title=Major Legislation on Housing and Urban Development Enacted Since 1932|url=https://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/documents/huddoc?id=Legs_Chron_June2014.pdf|website=Housing and Urban Development|accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Brooke Amendment became the first instance of the benchmark to measure housing affordability, which became known as the "30 percent rule of thumb"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rental Burdens: Rethinking Affordability Measures {{!}} HUD USER|url=https://www.huduser.gov/portal/pdredge/pdr_edge_featd_article_092214.html|website=www.huduser.gov|accessdate=7 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in 1981 when the 25 percent cap was raised to 30 percent of tenant income.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps.americanbar.org/abastore/products/books/abstracts/5530024%20chapter%201_abs.pdf|title=Affordable Housing: an intimate history|last=Edson|first=Charles L.|date=2011|website=American Bar Association|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Senator Brooke advocated for two other subsections that were enacted in the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1969.  Section 213 (b) gives the Secretary of [[Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD) authority to revoke the 25 percent cap if it results in a reduction of total welfare assistance.  Section 213 (c) amends section 14 of the [[Housing Act of 1937]] to ensure the "low-rent character of public housing projects" by fixing annual contract contributions according to the current Federal rate of interest.&lt;ref name="HUD Act 69" /&gt;  Together, the three subsections can be referred to as the "Brooke Amendments",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The legal guide to affordable housing development|date=2011|publisher=American Bar Association|isbn=9781616329839|edition=2nd|location=Chicago, Ill.|pages=chapter 1 - Affordable Housing: an intimate history|last1=Edson|first1=Charles L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the pluralized term is less common.

'''CDT''' is an Australian digital television station broadcasting in remote central and eastern Australia. It is jointly owned by [[Southern Cross Austereo]] (owner of [[QQQ|Southern Cross Central]]) and [[Imparja Television|Imparja Television Pty Ltd]] (owner of [[Imparja Television]]) and operates under the company name ''Central Digital Television''.&lt;ref name="LicenceAlloc"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[free-to-air]] on a number of digital terrestrial transmitters, in remote areas of Australia.

The station is similar to other joint venture services already available in [[TDT (TV station)|Tasmania]], [[MDV (TV station)|Mildura]], [[DTD (TV station)|Darwin]] and [[West Digital Television|Western Australia]]. Officially, the service's call sign is CDT in the Remote Central and Eastern Australia TV2 licence areas, and '''IDQ''' in the [[Mount Isa]] TV1 licence area (reflecting the status of existing [[Southern Cross Television]] station [[QQQ|ITQ]]).

== History ==
Central Digital Television began broadcasting ''10 Central'', ''[[10 Boss]]'' and ''[[10 Peach|10 Peach]]'' as digital satellite channels on 30 June 2010, the same day as the Viewer Access Satellite Television service was partially launched. [[QQQ|Southern Cross Central]] and Imparja Television also commenced broadcasting digital satellite channels on the same day. The launch of the commercial digital channels coincided with the first analog television transmitter switch off in [[Mildura, Victoria]]. This was so viewers in the area who lost adequate television coverage were able to utilise VAST as an alternative source.&lt;ref name="DBCDEAnnualReport"&gt;{{cite web

| date = October 2012
| work = Department of Communications (previously DBCDE)
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 December 2010, VAST officially launched and began granting access to viewers in the Remote Central and Eastern Australia licence areas. This brought digital television to satellite viewers in the Northern Territory, Queensland and South Australia for the first time.&lt;ref name="DBCDEAnnualReport" /&gt; Digital terrestrial transmissions began in [[Alice Springs, Northern Territory]] and Mount Isa, Queensland on 2 May 2011,&lt;ref name="TerrLaunch1"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; with other areas launching between 2012 and 2013.

== Programming ==
CDT is affiliated to Network Ten, but sources programming from two stations.

'''California Education Code 48907''' (1977), also known as the '''California Student Free Expression Law''', acts as a counter to the [[Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier]] (1988) Supreme Court ruling, which limited the [[freedom of speech]] granted to public [[School newspaper|high school newspapers]]. The Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier decision held that public school curricular student newspapers that have not been established as "forums for student expression" are subject to a lower level of [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] protection than independent student expression or newspapers established (by policy or practice) as forums for student expression. Ed Code 48907 affirms the right of high school newspapers to publish whatever they choose, so long as the content is not explicitly obscene, libelous, or slanderous. The newspaper content must also pass the minimal disruption test set forth in the Supreme Court ruling on [[Tinker v. Des Moines]] (1969). In contrast with Hazelwood, which limited [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] Protection to only those high school newspapers that had, through practice or policy, been established as forums for student expression, Ed Code 48907 affirms the right of all newspapers to the freedom of expression.

== Background ==
Many public high schools provide for a school-funded newspaper, most often the product of a journalism class taken for credit. As a recent Legal News Advisory issued by the [[California Department of Education]] noted, these newspapers exist mainly to teach students the elements of journalism and to supplement the language arts curriculum. However, the same advisory also noted that students have a legitimate interest in the full expression of their own ideas on topics of concern, even when those ideas are in conflict with or are critical of those of the school or the majority of the public. Following the landmark Supreme Court ruling in Tinker v. Des Moines, which asserted that students do not lose their free speech protections in school, students are allowed a degree of freedom of expression in school, even if these rights are justifiably less than those experienced out of the classroom.

However, the 1974 study commissioned by the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial, ''Captive Voices'', found that [[censorship]] and the systematic lack of freedom to engage in open, responsible journalism characterize high school journalism. This study, which examined censorship issues, minority participation and journalism education, and the commercial media's involvement with scholastic journalism, also found that censorship of journalism is a matter of policy in all areas of the country despite legal protections that override such censorship. Importantly, the issue of [[self-censorship]] was found to have created passivity among students and made them cynical about the guarantees of a free press under the First Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;Leaming, Jeremy. Analysis of Hazelwood's impact on the student press. January 12, 1988. &lt; http://www.freedomforum.org/templates/document.asp?documentID=4494&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

As a counter to these suppressions and as a reaction to Tinker v. Des Moines, California became the first state in the United States to enact a statutory scheme that protected the free speech rights of students. These protections were codified in Educational Code 10611.&lt;ref&gt;Corbett, Ellen M, Chair of Senate Judiciary Committee. Education: Journalism Teacher Protection Act. April 8, 2008. &lt;{{cite web |url=http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/07-08/bill/sen/sb_1351-1400/sb_1370_cfa_20080409_133510_sen_comm.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091013081251/http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/07-08/bill/sen/sb_1351-1400/sb_1370_cfa_20080409_133510_sen_comm.html |archivedate=2009-10-13 |df= }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, the California Legislature rewrote this code and replaced it with Educational Code 48907. This revision was prompted by Bright v. Los Angeles Unified School District (1976), in which the [[California Supreme Court]] found that Educational Code 10611 did not authorize [[prior restraint]], and thus that a school could only discipline a student for violation of a publications rule or prohibit further distribution. However, Educational Code 10611 was not completely clear, and thus the Legislature replaced it with the current statute, 48907, which now states that prior restraint is allowed only when student expression violates the specific prohibitions of Section 48907.&lt;ref&gt;California State Department of Education. Limitations on Student Expression in School-Sponsored Publications. March 4, 1988. &lt; http://www.splc.org/pdf/caldoeadvisory.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text==
The main text of the Code is as follows:

{{quote|Students of the public schools including charter schools, shall have the right to exercise freedom of speech and of the press including, but not limited to, the use of bulletin boards, the distribution of printed materials or petitions, the wearing of buttons, badges, and other insignia, and the right of expression in official publications, whether or not such publications or other means of expression are supported financially by the school or by use of school facilities,
except that expression shall be prohibited which is obscene,
libelous, or slanderous.  Also prohibited shall be material which so incites students as to create a clear and present danger of the commission of unlawful acts on school premises or the violation of lawful school regulations, or the substantial disruption of the orderly operation of the school.

Each governing board of a school district and each county board of education shall adopt rules and regulations in the form of a written publications code, which shall include reasonable provisions for the time, place, and manner of conducting such activities within its respective jurisdiction.

Student editors of official school publications shall be
responsible for assigning and editing the news, editorial, and
feature content of their publications subject to the limitations of this section.  However, it shall be the responsibility of a
journalism adviser or advisers of student publications within each school to supervise the production of the student staff, to maintain professional standards of English and journalism, and to maintain the provisions of this section.
 
There shall be no prior restraint of material prepared for
official school publications except insofar as it violates this
section.  School officials shall have the burden of showing
justification without undue delay prior to any limitation of student expression under this section.

"Official school publications" refers to material produced by
students in the journalism, newspaper, yearbook, or writing classes and distributed to the student body either free or for a fee.

Nothing in this section shall prohibit or prevent any governing
board of a school district from adopting otherwise valid rules and regulations relating to oral communication by students upon the premises of each school.

An employee shall not be dismissed, suspended, disciplined, reassigned, transferred, or otherwise retaliated against solely for acting to protect a pupil engaged in the conduct authorized under this section, or refusing to infringe upon conduct that is protected by this section, the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, or Section 2 of Article I of the California Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;This final paragraph of Ed. Code 48907 was a late addition to the law, signed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger in September 2008.&lt;http://www.splc.org/article/2008/09/press-release-student-press-law-center-hails-californias-new-journalism-teacher-protection-act&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Specific provisions ==
School authorities can only prohibit publication of stories in school newspapers if they are obscene, libelous, slanderous, or likely to incite others to commit illegal or disruptive acts. Additionally, school districts may not censor, even if the above conditions are met, if the district has not adopted in written form rules and regulations including reasonable provisions for the time, place, and manner in which issues of censorship may be addressed or settled. Thus, even if material falls within the realm of obscene, defamatory, illegal, or disruptive, all reasonable restrictions on school newspapers, school officials may not censor student material simply because no written school district regulations governing publications exist.

Also, a school district rule which generally prohibits such potentially sensitive topics as pregnancy and divorce is not permitted by the statute.

In issues of school liability, often stemming from libel or defamation lawsuits, the majority opinion in Leeb v. Delong 1988 stated that to impose a prior restraint requires the article to contain a "false statement ... likely to harm the reputation of another ..." and cannot be allowed "to hinge on the subjective pique" of a prospective plaintiff. This again holds the school to a high level of free speech protection before being allowed to censor.&lt;ref&gt;Crosby, P.J. "Leeb v. DeLong (1988) 198 Cal.App.3d 47 , 243, Cal.Rptr. 494." California First Amendment Coalition. 31 May 2008. &lt;http://www.cfac.org/handbook/cases/Leeb_v.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Leeb v. Delong holds that a lack of "professional standards of English and journalism" is not justification for prior restraint; post-publication responses are the only way to maintain these standards.&lt;ref&gt;Crosby, P.J. "Leeb v. DeLong (1988) 198 Cal.App.3d 47 , 243, Cal.Rptr. 494." California First Amendment Coalition. 31 May 2008. &lt;http://www.cfac.org/handbook/cases/Leeb_v.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent usage ==
This policy and Education Code 48907 was supported by the case ''Smith v. Novato Unified School District'' (2007). A California Court of Appeal found that school unlawfully disciplined by condemning a controversial editorial as a violation of school policy and stating it should not have been published. The editorial, titled "Immigration," contained extremely controversial statements about illegal immigrants. The principal, soon after the newspaper's release, ordered that all remaining copies of the newspaper no longer distributed. Smith sued the school district, and the Marin County Superior Court ruled against him; however, the First District Court of Appeal reversed the decision, stating that Code 48907 prohibits schools from censoring speech simply "because it presents controversial ideas and opponents of the speech are likely to cause disruption."&lt;ref&gt;Court of Appeal of the State of California, First Appellate District, Division Five. Brief of Amici Curiae In Support of Andrew D. Smith and Dale R. Smith. &lt; splc.org/pdf/novato_amicus.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Political science|political]] and [[social science]]s, '''communism''' (from [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|communis}}'', "common, universal")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Communism|encyclopedia=Britannica Encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/129104/communism}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''World Book'', 2008, p. 890.&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[Political philosophy|philosophical]], [[Social philosophy|social]], [[Ideology|political]], and [[economic ideology]] and [[Political movement|movement]] whose ultimate goal is the establishment of the [[communist society]], which is a [[Socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] order structured upon the [[common ownership]] of the [[means of production]] and the absence of [[social class]]es, [[money]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/11/prin-com.htm ''Principles of Communism''], Frederick Engels, 1847, Section 18. "Finally, when all capital, all production, all exchange have been brought together in the hands of the nation, private property will disappear of its own accord, money will become superfluous, and production will so expand and man so change that society will be able to slough off whatever of its old economic habits may remain".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/bukharin/works/1920/abc/03.htm ''The ABC of Communism''], Nikoli Bukharin, 1920, Section 20.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[State (polity)|state]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/bukharin/works/1920/abc/03.htm ''The ABC of Communism''], Nikoli Bukharin, 1920, Section 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Encyclopedia of Political Science|url=http://sk.sagepub.com/reference/the-encyclopedia-of-political-science|doi=10.4135/9781608712434|editor=George Thomas Kurian|publisher=CQ Press|date=2011|isbn=9781933116440|chapter=Withering Away of the State|accessdate=January 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Communism includes a variety of schools of thought, which broadly include [[Marxism]] and [[anarchism]] ([[anarcho-communism]]), as well as the political ideologies grouped around both. All of these share the analysis that the current order of society stems from its economic system, [[capitalism]]; that in this system there are two major social classes; that [[class conflict|conflict between these two classes]] is the root of all problems in society; and that this situation will ultimately be resolved through a [[social revolution]]. 
The two classes are the [[proletariat|working class]]—who must work to survive and who make up the majority within society—and the [[Bourgeoisie|capitalist class]]—a minority who derives profit from employing the working class through private ownership of the [[means of production]].
The revolution will put the working class in power and in turn establish [[social ownership]] of the means of production, which according to this analysis is the primary element in the transformation of society towards communism.
[[Communism#Criticism|Critics of communism]] can be roughly divided into those concerning themselves with the practical aspects of 20th century [[communist state]]s&lt;ref name="Bruno Bosteels 2014"&gt;Bruno Bosteels, ''The Actuality of Communism'' (Verso Books, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; and those concerning themselves with communist principles and theory.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond C. Taras, ''The Road to Disillusion: From Critical Marxism to Post-communism in Eastern Europe (Routledge, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of communism}}

===Early communism===
The term "communism" was first coined and defined in its modern definition by the [[French people|French]] philosopher and writer [[Victor d'Hupay]]. In his 1777 book ''[[Projet de communauté philosophe]]'', d'Hupay pushes the philosophy of the [[Lumières|Enlightenment]] to principles which he lived up to during most of his life in his [[bastide]] of [[Fuveau]] ([[Provence]]). This book can be seen as the cornerstone of communist philosophy as d'Hupay defines this lifestyle as a "[[commune]]" and advises to "share all economic and material products between inhabitants of the commune, so that all may benefit from everybody's work".&lt;ref name="Jean-Pierre Cassely, 2016"&gt;Cassely, 2016 : ''Aix insolite et secrète'' JonGlez {{pp.|192–193}} ([http://catalogue.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb45058387v références Bibliothèque nationale de France]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Communist thought has also been traced back to the works of the 16th-century English writer [[Thomas More]]. In his treatise ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'' (1516), More portrayed a society based on [[common ownership]] of property, whose rulers administered it through the application of reason. In the 17th century, communist thought surfaced again in England, where a [[Puritan]] [[Religious denomination|religious group]] known as the "[[Diggers]]" advocated the abolition of private ownership of land.&lt;ref name="diggers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerlovejoy.co.uk/philosophy/diggers/diggers3.htm|title=Diggers' Manifesto|accessdate=July 19, 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60XT6NLIO?url=http://www.rogerlovejoy.co.uk/philosophy/diggers/diggers3.htm|archivedate=July 29, 2011|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1895 ''Cromwell and Communism'',{{sfn|Bernstein|1895}} [[Eduard Bernstein]] argued that several groups during the [[English Civil War]] (especially the Diggers) espoused clear communistic, agrarian ideals and that [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s attitude towards these groups was at best ambivalent and often hostile.{{sfn|Bernstein|1895}} Criticism of the idea of private property continued into the [[Age of Enlightenment]] of the 18th century through such thinkers as [[Jean Jacques Rousseau]] in [[France]]. Later, following the upheaval of the [[French Revolution]] communism emerged as a political doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;"Communism" ''A Dictionary of Sociology''. John Scott and [[Gordon Marshall (sociologist)|Gordon Marshall]]. Oxford University Press 2005. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 19th century, various social reformers founded communities based on common ownership. However, unlike many previous communist communities they replaced the religious emphasis with a rational and philanthropic basis.&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;"Communism". ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. 2006. [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] Online.&lt;/ref&gt; Notable among them were [[Robert Owen]], who founded [[New Harmony, Indiana|New Harmony]] in Indiana (1825), as well as [[Charles Fourier]], whose followers organized other settlements in the United States such as [[Brook Farm]] (1841–1847).&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

In its modern form, communism grew out of the socialist movement in 19th-century Europe. As the [[Industrial Revolution]] advanced, socialist critics blamed [[capitalism]] for the misery of the [[proletariat]]—a new class of urban factory workers who labored under often-hazardous conditions. Foremost among these critics were [[Karl Marx]] and his associate [[Friedrich Engels]]. In 1848, Marx and Engels offered a new definition of communism and popularized the term in their famous pamphlet ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]''.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

===State communism in the Soviet Union===
{{main|Communist state}}
[[File:Soviet Union - Russian SFSR (1922).svg|thumb|The [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]] as a part of the [[USSR]] in 1922]]
The [[October Revolution|1917 October Revolution]] in Russia set the conditions for the rise to state power of [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s [[Bolsheviks]], which was the first time any avowedly communist party reached that position. The revolution transferred power to the [[All-Russian Congress of Soviets]], in which the Bolsheviks had a majority.&lt;ref name="or_soviets_1"&gt;''Russia in the Twentieth Century: The Quest for Stability''. David R. Marples. p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="or_soviets_2"&gt;''How the Soviet Union is Governed''. Jerry F. Hough. p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="or_soviets_3"&gt;''The Life and Times of Soviet Socialism''. Alex F. Dowlah, John E. Elliott. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The event generated a great deal of practical and theoretical debate within the Marxist movement. Marx predicted that [[socialism]] and communism would be built upon foundations laid by the most advanced capitalist development. However, [[Russia]] was one of the poorest countries in Europe with an enormous, largely illiterate peasantry and a minority of industrial workers. Marx had explicitly stated that Russia might be able to skip the stage of bourgeois rule.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Edelman, "Late Marx and the Russian road: Marx and the 'Peripheries of Capitalism'"—book reviews. ''Monthly Review'', December 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

The moderate [[Menshevik]]s (minority) opposed Lenin's Bolshevik (majority) plan for [[Communist revolution|socialist revolution]] before capitalism was more fully developed. The Bolsheviks' successful rise to power was based upon the slogans such as "Peace, bread and land" which tapped into the massive public desire for an end to Russian involvement in the [[World War I|First World War]], the peasants' demand for [[land reform]], and popular support for the [[Soviet (council)|soviets]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hol09|Holmes 2009]], p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Soviet Union]] was established in 1922.

Following Lenin's [[democratic centralism]], the Leninist parties were organized on a hierarchical basis, with active cells of members as the broad base. They were made up only of elite [[Professional revolutionaries|cadres]] approved by higher members of the party as being reliable and completely subject to [[party discipline]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Norman Davies]].

Oxford University Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Great Purge]] of 1937–1938 was [[Joseph Stalin]]'s attempt to destroy any possible opposition within the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]]. In the [[Moscow Trials]], many old Bolsheviks who had played prominent roles during the Russian Revolution of 1917 or in Lenin's Soviet government afterwards, including [[Lev Kamenev|Kamenev]], [[Grigory Zinoviev|Zinoviev]], [[Alexei Rykov|Rykov]] and [[Nikolai Bukharin|Bukharin]], were accused, pleaded guilty and executed.&lt;ref&gt;Sedov, Lev (1980).

Its leading role in the [[World War II|Second World War]] saw the emergence of the [[Soviet Union]] as a [[superpower]], with strong influence over [[Eastern Europe]] and parts of [[Asia]]. The [[Colonial empire|European]] and [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] empires were shattered and communist parties played a leading role in many independence movements. Marxist–Leninist governments modeled on the Soviet Union took power with Soviet assistance in [[Bulgaria]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[East Germany]], [[Poland]], [[Hungary]] and [[Romania]]. A Marxist–Leninist government was also created under [[Joseph Tito|Marshal Tito]] in [[Yugoslavia]], but Tito's independent policies led to the expulsion of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] from the [[Cominform]] which had replaced the [[Comintern]] and [[Titoism]] was branded "[[Deviationism|deviationist]]".

===Dissolution of the Soviet Union===
{{main|Dissolution of the Soviet Union}}
The Soviet Union was dissolved on December 26, 1991. It was a result of the declaration number 142-Н of the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Soviet of the Republics of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{ru icon}} [[:s:ru:Декларация Совета Республик ВС СССР от December 26, 1991 № 142-Н|Declaration № 142-Н]] of the [[Soviet of Nationalities|Soviet of the Republics of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]], formally establishing the dissolution of the Soviet Union as a state and subject of international law.&lt;/ref&gt; The declaration acknowledged the independence of the former [[Soviet republics]] and created the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]], although five of the signatories ratified it much later or did not do it at all. On the previous day, Soviet President [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] (the eighth and final [[leader of the Soviet Union]]) resigned, declared his office extinct and handed over its powers – including control of the [[Cheget|Soviet nuclear missile launching codes]] – to [[President of Russia|Russian President]] [[Boris Yeltsin]]. That evening at 7:32, the [[Flag of the Soviet Union|Soviet flag]] was lowered from the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]] for the last time and replaced with the pre-revolutionary [[Flag of Russia|Russian flag]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/1225.html|title=Gorbachev, Last Soviet Leader, Resigns; U.S. Recognizes Republics' Independence|work=New York Times|accessdate=April 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously, from August to December all the individual republics, including Russia itself, had seceded from the union.

The [[public sector]] is the dominant sector in these economies and the state plays a central role in coordinating economic development.

==Marxist communism==
===Marxism===
[[File:Marx et Engels à Shanghai.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|A monument dedicated to [[Karl Marx]] (left) and [[Friedrich Engels]] (right) in Shanghai, China]]
[[Marxism]], first developed by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] in the mid-1800s, has been the foremost ideology of the communist movement. Marxism considers itself to be the embodiment of [[scientific socialism]], and rather than model an "ideal society" based on intellectuals' design, it is a non-idealist attempt at the understanding of society and history through an analysis based in real life. Marxism does not see communism as a "state of affairs" to be established, but rather as the expression of a real movement, with parameters which are derived completely from real life and not based on any intelligent design.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl. The German Ideology. 1845. Part I: Feuerbach. Opposition of the Materialist and Idealist Outlook. A. Idealism and Materialism. "Communism is for us not a state of affairs which is to be established, an ideal to which reality [will] have to adjust itself. We call communism the real movement which abolishes the present state of things. The conditions of this movement result from the premises now in existence".&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Marxism does no blueprinting of a communist society and it only makes an analysis which concludes what will trigger its implementation and discovers its fundamental characteristics based on the derivation of real life conditions.

At the root of Marxism is the [[materialist conception of history]], known as historical materialism for short. It holds that the key characteristic of economic systems through history has been the [[mode of production]] and that the change between modes of production has been triggered by [[class struggle]]. According to this analysis, the Industrial Revolution ushered the world into a new mode of production: [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalism]]. Before capitalism, certain working classes had ownership of instruments utilized in production, but because machinery was much more efficient this property became worthless and the mass majority of workers could only survive by selling their labor, working through making use of someone else's machinery and therefore making someone else profit. Thus with capitalism the world was divided between two major classes: the proletariat and the bourgeoisie.&lt;ref&gt;Engels, Friedrich. Marx &amp; Engels Selected Works, Volume One, pp. 81–97, Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1969. "Principles of Communism". No. 4 – "How did the proletariat originate?".&lt;/ref&gt; These classes are directly antagonistic: the bourgeoisie has private ownership of the means of production and earns a profit off [[surplus value]], which is generated by the proletariat, which has no ownership of the means of production and therefore no option but to sell its labor to the bourgeoisie.

Historical materialism goes on and says: the rising bourgeoisie within feudalism, through the furtherance of its own material interests, captured power and abolished, of all relations of private property, only the feudal privileges and with this took out of existence the feudal ruling class. This was another of the keys behind the consolidation of capitalism as the new mode of production, which is the final expression of class and property relations and also has led into a massive expansion of production. It is therefore only in capitalism that private property in itself can be abolished.&lt;ref&gt;Engels, Friedrich. Marx &amp; Engels Selected Works, Volume One, pp. 81–97, Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1969. "Principles of Communism". No. 15 – "Was not the abolition of private property possible at an earlier time?".&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the proletariat will capture political power, abolish bourgeois property through the common ownership of the means of production, therefore abolishing the bourgeoisie and ultimately abolishing the proletariat itself and ushering the world into a new mode of production: communism. In between capitalism and communism there is the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], a democratic state where the whole of the public authority is elected and recallable under the basis of [[universal suffrage]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas M. Twiss. ''Trotsky and the Problem of Soviet Bureaucracy''. Brill. pp. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the defeat of the bourgeois state, but not yet of the capitalist mode of production and at the same time the only element which places into the realm of possibility moving on from this mode of production.

An important concept in Marxism is socialization vs. nationalization. Nationalization is merely state ownership of property, whereas socialization is actual control and management of property by society. Marxism considers socialization its goal and considers nationalization a tactical issue, with state ownership still being in the realm of the capitalist mode of production; in the words of Engels: "[The transformation [...] into State-ownership does not do away with the capitalistic nature of the productive forces. [...] State-ownership of the productive forces is not the solution of the conflict, but concealed within it are the technical conditions that form the elements of that solution".&lt;ref&gt;Engels, Friedrich. [[Socialism: Utopian and Scientific]]. Chapter 3. "But, the transformation—either into joint-stock companies and trusts, or into State-ownership—does not do away with the capitalistic nature of the productive forces. In the joint-stock companies and trusts, this is obvious. And the modern State, again, is only the organization that bourgeois society takes on in order to support the external conditions of the capitalist mode of production against the encroachments as well of the workers as of individual capitalists. The modern state, no matter what its form, is essentially a capitalist machine—the state of the capitalists, the ideal personification of the total national capital. The more it proceeds to the taking over of productive forces, the more does it actually become the national capitalist, the more citizens does it exploit. The workers remain wage-workers—proletarians. The capitalist relation is not done away with. It is, rather, brought to a head. But, brought to a head, it topples over. State-ownership of the productive forces is not the solution of the conflict, but concealed within it are the technical conditions that form the elements of that solution".&lt;/ref&gt; This has led some Marxist groups and tendencies to label states such as the Soviet Union—based on nationalization—as [[State capitalism|state capitalist]].&lt;ref name="hetsa.org.au"&gt;[http://www.hetsa.org.au/pdf/34-A-08.pdf "State capitalism" in the Soviet Union], M.C.

===Leninism===
[[File:Lenin-statue-in-Kolkata.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Vladimir Lenin]]'s statue in Kolkata, West Bengal]]
{{quotation|We want to achieve a new and better order of society: in this new and better society there must be neither rich nor poor; all will have to work. Not a handful of rich people, but all the working people must enjoy the fruits of their common labour. Machines and other improvements must serve to ease the work of all and not to enable a few to grow rich at the expense of millions and tens of millions of people.

The teachings about this society are called 'socialism'.&lt;br&gt;–Vladimir Lenin, 1903&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1903/rp/1.htm "To the Rural Poor" (1903)]. ''Collected Works''. vol. 6. p. 366.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[Leninism]] is the body of political theory, developed by and named after the Russian revolutionary and later Soviet premier [[Vladimir Lenin]] for the democratic organisation of a revolutionary vanguard party and the achievement of a dictatorship of the proletariat, as political prelude to the establishment of socialism. Leninism comprises socialist political and economic theories developed from Marxism, as well as Lenin's interpretations of Marxist theory for practical application to the socio-political conditions of the agrarian early-twentieth-century [[Russian Empire]]. In February 1917, for five years Leninism was the Russian application of Marxist economics and political philosophy, effected and realised by the Bolsheviks, the vanguard party who led the fight for the political independence of the working class.

===Marxism–Leninism, Stalinism and Trotskyism===
====Marxism–Leninism and Stalinism====
[[File:JStalin Secretary general CCCP 1942 flipped.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Joseph Stalin]], 1942]]
[[Marxism–Leninism]] is a political ideology developed by [[Joseph Stalin]],&lt;ref name="made_by_stalin"&gt;Г. Лисичкин (G. Lisichkin), Мифы и реальность, Новый мир (''[[Novy Mir]]''), 1989, № 3, p. 59 {{ru icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which according to its proponents is based in [[Marxism]] and [[Leninism]]. The term describes the specific political ideology which Stalin implemented in the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] and in a global scale in the [[Comintern]]. There is no definite agreement between historians of about whether Stalin actually followed the principles of Marx and Lenin.&lt;ref name="stalin_follow_marx_lenin"&gt;Александр Бутенко (Aleksandr Butenko), Социализм сегодня: опыт и новая теория// Журнал Альтернативы, №1, 1996, pp. 2–22 {{ru icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It also contains aspects which according to some are deviations from Marxism, such as "[[socialism in one country]]".&lt;ref name="sioc1"&gt;''Contemporary Marxism'', issues 4–5. Synthesis Publications, 1981. p. 151. "[S]ocialism in one country, a pragmatic deviation from classical Marxism".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sioc2"&gt;North Korea Under Communism: Report of an Envoy to Paradise. Cornell Erik. p. 169. "Socialism in one country, a slogan that aroused protests as not only it implied a major deviation from Marxist internationalism, but was also strictly speaking incompatible with the basic tenets of Marxism".&lt;/ref&gt; Marxism–Leninism was the ideology of the most clearly visible communist movement. As such, it is the most prominent ideology associated with communism.

Marxism–Leninism refers to the socioeconomic system and political ideology implemented by Stalin in the Soviet Union and later copied by other states based on the [[Ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet model]] (central planning, [[one-party state]] and so on), whereas [[Stalinism]] refers to Stalin's style of governance. Marxism–Leninism stayed after [[de-Stalinization]], Stalinism did not. In the last letters before his death, Lenin in fact warned against the danger of Stalin's personality and urged the Soviet government to replace him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Communism: The Great Misunderstanding|last=Ermak|first=Gennady|year=2016|isbn=978-1533082893}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maoism]] is a form of Marxism–Leninism associated with Chinese leader [[Mao Zedong]]. After de-Stalinization, Marxism–Leninism was kept in the Soviet Union, but certain [[Anti-revisionism|anti-revisionist]] tendencies such as [[Hoxhaism]] and Maoism argued that it was deviated from, therefore different policies were applied in Albania and China, which became more distanced from the Soviet Union.

Marxism–Leninism has been criticized by other communist and Marxist tendencies. They argue that Marxist–Leninist states did not establish socialism, but rather [[state capitalism]].&lt;ref name="hetsa.org.au"/&gt; According to Marxism, the dictatorship of the proletariat represents the rule of the majority (democracy) rather than of one party, to the extent that co-founder of Marxism [[Friedrich Engels]] described its "specific form" as the [[republicanism|democratic republic]].&lt;ref&gt;''A Critique of the Draft Social-Democratic Program of 1891''. "Marx &amp; Engels Collected Works", Vol 27, p. 217. "If one thing is certain it is that our party and the working class can only come to power under the form of a democratic republic. This is even the specific form for the dictatorship of the proletariat".&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, according to Engels state property by itself is private property of capitalist nature&lt;ref&gt;"Socialism: Utopian and Scientific". Friedrich Engels. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/ch03.htm Part III]. Progress Publishers. "But, the transformation—either into joint-stock companies and trusts, or into State-ownership—does not do away with the capitalistic nature of the productive forces".&lt;/ref&gt; unless the proletariat has control of political power, in which case it forms public property.&lt;ref&gt;"Socialism: Utopian and Scientific". Friedrich Engels. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/ch03.htm Part III]. Progress Publishers. "The proletariat seizes the public power, and by means of this transforms the socialized means of production, slipping from the hands of the bourgeoisie, into public property. By this act, the proletariat frees the means of production from the character of capital they have thus far borne, and gives their socialized character complete freedom to work itself out".&lt;/ref&gt; Whether the proletariat was actually in control of the Marxist–Leninist states is a matter of debate between Marxism–Leninism and other communist tendencies. To these tendencies, Marxism–Leninism is neither Marxism nor Leninism nor the union of both, but rather an artificial term created to justify Stalin's ideological distortion,&lt;ref name="stalin_distortion"&gt;History for the IB Diploma: Communism in Crisis 1976–89. Allan Todd. p. 16. "The term Marxism–Leninism, invented by Stalin, was not used until after Lenin's death in 1924. It soon came to be used in Stalin's Soviet Union to refer to what he described as 'orthodox Marxism'. This increasingly came to mean what Stalin himself had to say about political and economic issues." [...] "However, many Marxists (even members of the Communist Party itself) believed that Stalin's ideas and practices (such as socialism in one country and the purges) were almost total distortions of what Marx and Lenin had said".&lt;/ref&gt; forced into the CPSU and Comintern. In the Soviet Union, this struggle against Marxism–Leninism was represented by [[Trotskyism]], which describes itself as a Marxist and Leninist tendency.

====Trotskyism====
[[Trotskyism]] is a Marxist and Leninist tendency that was developed by [[Leon Trotsky]], opposed to Marxism–Leninism. It supports the theory of [[permanent revolution]] and [[world revolution]] instead of the [[two stage theory]] and [[socialism in one country]]. It supported [[proletarian internationalism]] and another communist revolution in the Soviet Union, which Trotsky claimed had become a "[[degenerated worker's state]]" under the leadership of Stalin, in which class relations had re-emerged in a new form, rather than the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]].

Trotsky and his supporters, struggling against Stalin for power in the Soviet Union, organized into the [[Left Opposition]] and their platform became known as Trotskyism. Stalin eventually succeeded in gaining control of the Soviet regime and Trotskyist attempts to remove Stalin from power resulted in Trotsky's exile from the Soviet Union in 1929. While in exile, Trotsky continued his campaign against Stalin, founding in 1938 the [[Fourth International]], a Trotskyist rival to the [[Comintern]] In August 1940, Trotsky was assassinated in Mexico City on Stalin's orders.

Trotsky's politics differed sharply from those of Stalin and Mao, most importantly in declaring the need for an international proletarian revolution (rather than socialism in one country) and support for a true dictatorship of the proletariat based on democratic principles.

===Libertarian Marxism===
[[Libertarian Marxism]] is a broad range of economic and political philosophies that emphasize the [[anti-authoritarian]] aspects of [[Marxism]]. Early currents of libertarian Marxism, known as left communism,&lt;ref&gt;Pierce, Wayne.[http://www.utopianmag.com/files/in/1000000034/12___WayneLibMarx.pdf Libertarian Marxism's Relation to Anarchism].

[http://libcom.org/library/trotsky-left-opposition-rise-stalinism-theory-practice-john-eric-marot "Trotsky, the Left Opposition and the Rise of Stalinism: Theory and Practice"]&lt;/ref&gt; Libertarian Marxism is also critical of [[reformist]] positions, such as those held by [[social democrats]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://libcom.org/library/social-democracy-1-aufheben-8 The Retreat of Social Democracy&amp;nbsp;... Re-imposition of Work in Britain and the 'Social Europe']. ''Aufheben''.

[https://web.archive.org/web/20130116194522/http://www.chomsky.info/audionvideo/19700216.mp3 "Government In The Future"] Poetry Center of the New York YM-YWHA. Lecture.&lt;/ref&gt;

Libertarian Marxism includes such currents as [[Luxemburgism]], [[council communism]], [[left communism]], ''[[Socialisme ou Barbarie]]'', the [[Johnson-Forest tendency]], [[world socialism]], [[Lettrism]]/[[Situationist International|Situationism]] and [[operaismo]]/[[autonomism]] and [[New Left]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libcom.org/library/libertarian-marxist-tendency-map|title=A libertarian Marxist tendency map|publisher=libcom.org|date=|accessdate=October 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Libertarian Marxism has often had a strong influence on both [[Post-left anarchism|post-left]] and [[Social anarchism|social anarchists]]. Notable theorists of libertarian Marxism have included [[Anton Pannekoek]], [[Raya Dunayevskaya]], [[CLR James]], [[Antonio Negri]], [[Cornelius Castoriadis]], [[Maurice Brinton]], [[Guy Debord]], [[Daniel Guérin]], [[Ernesto Screpanti]] and [[Raoul Vaneigem]].

===Council communism===
{{main|Council communism}}
[[Council communism]] is a movement originating in [[Germany]] and the [[Netherlands]] in the 1920s. Its primary organization was the [[Communist Workers Party of Germany]]. Council communism continues today as a theoretical and activist position within both left-wing Marxism and [[libertarian socialism]].

The central argument of council communism, in contrast to those of [[social democracy]] and Leninist communism, is that democratic [[workers' councils]] arising in the factories and municipalities are the natural form of working class organization and governmental power. This view is opposed to both the [[reformist]] and the Leninist [[ideology|ideologies]], with their stress on respectively parliaments and [[New institutionalism|institutional]] government (i.e. by applying social reforms on the one hand and [[Vanguard party|vanguard parties]] and participative [[democratic centralism]] on the other).

The core principle of council communism is that the government and the [[economic system|economy]] should be managed by [[workers' councils]] composed of delegates elected at workplaces and [[recall election|recallable]] at any moment. As such, council communists oppose [[Planned economy|state-run]] [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] "[[state socialism]]"/"[[state capitalism]]". They also oppose the idea of a "revolutionary party", since council communists believe that a revolution led by a party will necessarily produce a party dictatorship. Council communists support a worker's democracy, which they want to produce through a federation of workers' councils.

===Left communism===
[[File:Rosa Luxemburg.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Rosa Luxemburg]]]]
[[Left communism]] is the range of communist viewpoints held by the communist left, which criticizes the political ideas and practices espoused—particularly following the series of revolutions which brought the [[First World War]] to an end—by [[Bolshevik]]s and by [[Social Democracy|social democrats]]. Left communists assert positions which they regard as more authentically [[Marxism|Marxist]] and [[Proletariat|proletarian]] than the views of [[Marxism–Leninism]] espoused by the [[Comintern|Communist International]] after its [[1st Congress of the Comintern|first congress]] (March 1919) and during its [[2nd World Congress of the Comintern|second congress]] (July–August 1920).&lt;ref&gt;''Non-Leninist Marxism: Writings on the Workers Councils'' (includes texts by [[Herman Gorter|Gorter]], [[Antonie Pannekoek|Pannekoek]], [[Sylvia Pankhurst|Pankhurst]] and [[Otto Rühle|Rühle]]), Red and Black Publishers, St. Petersburg, Florida, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-9791813-6-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Left communists represent a range of political movements distinct from Marxist–Leninists (whom they largely view as merely the left-wing of capital), from [[anarcho-communist]]s (some of whom they consider internationalist socialists) as well as from various other revolutionary socialist tendencies (for example [[De Leonist]]s, whom they tend to see as being internationalist socialists only in limited instances).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.internationalism.org/book/export/html/761|title=The Legacy of De Leonism, part III: De Leon's misconceptions on class struggle|date=2000–2001|accessdate=|website=Internationalism|publisher=|last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-Marxist communism==
The dominant forms of communism are based on Marxism, but non-Marxist versions of communism (such as [[Christian communism]] and [[anarcho-communism]]) also exist.

===Anarcho-communism===
[[Anarcho-communism]] (also known as [[libertarian communism]]) is a theory of [[anarchism]] which advocates the abolition of the [[State (polity)|state]], [[private property]] and [[capitalism]] in favor of [[common ownership]] of the [[means of production]],&lt;ref name="Mayne"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6MkTz6Rq7wUC&amp;pg=PA131|title=From Politics Past to Politics Future: An Integrated Analysis of Current and Emergent Paradigms|author=Alan James Mayne|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|page=316|isbn=978-0-275-96151-0|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jeiudz5sBV4C&amp;pg=PA14|title=Anarchism for Know-It-Alls|publisher=Filiquarian Publishing|year=2008|isbn=978-1-59986-218-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[direct democracy]] and a horizontal network of [[voluntary association]]s and [[workers' council]]s with production and consumption based on the guiding principle: "[[From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs|From each according to his ability, to each according to his need]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fabbri|first=Luigi|title=Anarchism and Communism.

[[File:Kropotkin2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Peter Kropotkin]], main theorist of [[anarcho-communism]]]]
Anarcho-communism differs from Marxism rejecting its view about the need for a state socialism phase before building communism. The main theorist of anarcho-communism, [[Peter Kropotkin]], argued that a revolutionary society should "transform itself immediately into a communist society", that is should go immediately into what Marx had regarded as the "more advanced, completed, phase of communism".&lt;ref name="theanarchistlibrary.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Wayne_Price__What_is_Anarchist_Communism_.html|title="What is Anarchist Communism?" by Wayne Price|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60XT4wIPV?url=http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Wayne_Price__What_is_Anarchist_Communism_.html|archivedate=July 29, 2011|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, it tries to avoid the reappearance of "class divisions and the need for a state to oversee everything".&lt;ref name="theanarchistlibrary.org"/&gt;

To date in human history, the best-known examples of an anarcho-communist society, established around the ideas as they exist today and that received worldwide attention and knowledge in the historical canon, are the anarchist territories during the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Revolution]] and the [[Free Territory]] during the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]]. Through the efforts and influence of the [[Anarchism in Spain|Spanish anarchists]] during the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Revolution]] within the [[Spanish Civil War]], starting in 1936 anarcho-communism existed in most of [[Aragon]], parts of the [[Levante, Spain|Levante]] and [[Andalusia]] as well as in the stronghold of [[Anarchist Catalonia]] before being brutally crushed by the combined forces of the [[Francoism|authoritarian regime that won the war]], [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Benito Mussolini]], [[Communist Party of Spain]] repression (backed by the Soviet Union) as well as economic and armaments blockades from the capitalist countries and the Spanish Republic itself. During the Russian Revolution, anarchists such as [[Nestor Makhno]] worked to create and defend—through the [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]]—anarcho-communism in the [[Free Territory]] of the Ukraine from 1919 before being conquered by the Bolsheviks in 1921.

===Christian communism===
{{main|Christian communism}}
[[Christian communism]] is a form of [[religious communism]] based on [[Christianity]]. It is a theological and political theory based upon the view that the teachings of [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus Christ]] compel Christians to support communism as the ideal social system. Although there is no universal agreement on the exact date when Christian communism was founded, many Christian communists assert that evidence from the [[Bible]] suggests that the first Christians, including the [[Acts of Apostles|Apostles]], established their own small communist society in the years following Jesus' death and resurrection. As such, many advocates of Christian communism argue that it was taught by Jesus and practiced by the Apostles themselves.

Christian communism can be seen as a radical form of [[Christian socialism]]. Christian communists may or may not agree with various aspects of [[Marxism]]. They do not agree with the [[Marxism and religion|atheist and antireligious views held by secular Marxists]], but they do agree with many of the economic and existential aspects of Marxist theory, such as the idea that [[capitalism]] exploits the [[working class]] by extracting [[surplus value]] from the workers in the form of [[Profit (economics)|profits]] and the idea that [[Wage labour|wage labor]] is a tool of human [[Social alienation|alienation]] that promotes arbitrary and unjust [[authority]]. Like Marxism, Christian communism also holds the view that capitalism encourages the negative aspects of humans, supplanting values such as mercy, kindness, justice and compassion in favor of greed, selfishness and blind ambition.

==Criticism==
{{main|Criticism of communist party rule|Criticisms of Marxism}}
{{see also|Anti-communism}}
[[Criticism of communism (disambiguation)|Criticism of communism]] can be divided into two broad categories: that which concerns itself with the practical aspects of 20th century [[communist state]]s&lt;ref name="Bruno Bosteels 2014"/&gt; and that which concerns itself with communist principles and theory.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond C. Taras, ''The Road to Disillusion: From Critical Marxism to Post-communism in Eastern Europe'' (Routledge, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

Marxism is also subject to general criticisms, criticisms related to [[historical materialism]] that it is a type of [[historical determinism]], the necessary suppression of [[Liberal democracy|liberal democratic rights]], issues with the implementation of communism and economic issues such as the distortion or absence of [[price signal]]s. In addition, empirical and epistemological problems are frequently identified.&lt;ref name=howard&gt;See M. C. Howard and J. E. King, 1992, ''A History of Marxian Economics: Volume II, 1929–1990''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12601">'''Companies of the United States with untaxed profits''' deals with those U.S. companies whose offshore subsidiaries earn profits which are retained in foreign countries to defer paying [[Corporate tax in the United States|U.S. corporate tax]]. The profits of United States corporations are subject to a federal corporate tax rate of 21%. In principle, the tax is payable on all profits of corporations, whether earned domestically or abroad. However, overseas subsidiaries of U.S. corporations are entitled to a [[tax deferral]] of profits on active income until repatriated to the U.S., and are regarded as untaxed.&lt;ref name=masondrawbaugh&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/02/01/us-usa-budget-tax-idUSKBN0L51IX20150201 |title=Obama targets foreign profits with tax proposal, Republicans skeptical |author=Jeff Mason and Kevin Drawbaugh |date=February 1, 2015 |publisher=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; When repatriated, the corporations are entitled to a foreign tax credit for taxes (if any) paid in foreign countries.

Retaining such profits offshore may be regarded a [[tax strategy]]. Many corporations have accumulated substantial untaxed profits offshore, especially in countries with low corporate tax rates. In recent years it has been estimated that untaxed profits range from US$1.6 to $2.1 trillion. The ''Wall Street Journal'' noted that the "[u]ntaxed foreign earnings are part of a contentious debate over U.S. fiscal policy and tax code."&lt;ref name=thurmlinebaugh/&gt; The profits earned abroad and retained there are subject to a [[foreign exchange risk]], besides other [[financial risk]]s.

The downside of a strategy of retaining profits offshore is that corporations may want or need to pay dividends to shareholders, or to make investments in the United States, besides other reasons. The alternative may be to borrow funds in the U.S.,&lt;ref name=bloomberg2012/&gt; or access the funds retained offshore in the form of inter-company loans.

Foreign profits were up 93% from 2008 to 2013.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

==Politics and tax policy issues==
It has been suggested that companies hold profits overseas hoping for a [[Repatriation tax holiday|tax holiday]]. In 2012 Northwestern University law professor Thomas Brennan asserted that "companies are holding money outside the U.S. in part because they are waiting for Congress to repeat a 2004 tax holiday law that set a maximum tax rate for repatriation profits of 5.25%. 'Why not do it?' he said. 'It’s pure upside. In the worst-case scenario, you’re going to be taxed as you would have been in any event.'"&lt;ref name=bloomberg2012/&gt; The 2004 tax holiday, under President George W. Bush, yielded a lot of repatriation but not much economic benefit, according to one view.&lt;ref name=studyreported/&gt;  A number of the large U.S.-based companies that would benefit, including Google, Cisco Systems Inc., Qualcomm Inc. and Oracle Corp., were lobbying during 2011-2012 to obtain a repatriation holiday. At the time, however, President Obama was believed to oppose a one-time tax holiday, as it would be a giveaway to big corporations.&lt;ref name=bloomberg2012/&gt;

President Obama's February 2015 budget proposal called for a 14% tax to be applied on untaxed overseas profits, indicating that the proposal would yield $238 billion,&lt;ref name=obamabudget/&gt; implying a $1.7 trillion estimate of untaxed profits. It was proposed as a one-time tax to be imposed whether or not funds are repatriated.&lt;ref name=obamabudget/&gt; The proposal has not been heard about since.

In 2015, the topic of U.S. taxation of companies' operations abroad was addressed by announced and potential U.S. presidential candidates. For example, Republican senators [[Marco Rubio]] and [[Mike Lee (U.S. politician)|Mike Lee]] have called for elimination of U.S. taxes on companies' operations abroad, within a broader proposal for corporate and individual tax rate changes.&lt;ref name=rubio&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/senators-rubio-lee-push-u-tax-plan-cut-134558269--business.html |title=Senators Rubio, Lee push U.S. tax plan to cut corporate rates |date=March 4, 2015 |publisher=[[Reuters]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparative tax rates==
{{See also|Corporate tax#International corporate tax rates}}
Corporate tax rates vary between tax jurisdictions. The national rates of [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) countries vary from a low of 8.5% in Switzerland to a high of 35% in the United States, with an average of 22%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stats.oecd.org//Index.aspx?QueryId=58204 |title=Table II.1. Corporate income tax rate |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the federal tax rates, provincial, state and local taxes may also apply in most jurisdictions. For example, the 2015 provincial corporate tax rates in Canada range from 11.5% to 16% in addition to the federal tax rate of 15%, unless taxable profits of small corporations are low enough to qualify for a lower tax rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Corporation tax rates|url = http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/bsnss/tpcs/crprtns/rts-eng.html|website = www.cra-arc.gc.ca|access-date = 2016-02-07|first = Government of Canada, Canada Revenue Agency, Taxpayer Services and Debt Management Branch, Taxpayer Services|last = Directorate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In comparing national corporate tax rates one should also take into account the [[dividend tax|taxes on dividends]] paid to shareholders. For example, the overall U.S. tax on corporate profits of 35% is less than or similar to that of European countries such as Germany, Ireland, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, which have lower corporate tax rates but higher taxes on dividends paid to shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/docserver/download/5k3wh96w246k.pdf?expires=1448516536&amp;id=id&amp;accname=guest&amp;checksum=19E09DD7567FF1DA85E0EC999665FA0B |title=www.oecd-ilibrary.org |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many large multinational companies retain untaxed profits in [[tax haven]] jurisdictions which offer no or very low corporate taxes, as well as other tax benefits.

{{Family law}}

In modern [[society]], the role of [[marriage]] and its termination through '''[[divorce]]''' have become political issues. As people live increasingly mobile lives, the [[conflict of laws]] and its [[choice of law]] rules are highly relevant to determine:
*the circumstances in which people may obtain divorces in [[Jurisdiction (area)|states]] in which they have no permanent or [[habitual residence]]; and
*when one state will recognize and enforce a divorce granted in another state

==The problems==
When people's lives were mostly confined to a single state, local [[court]] orders for [[alimony|maintenance]] and [[child support]], and for [[contact (law)|contact]] with, and [[parental responsibility (access and custody)|parental responsibility]] for, any children of the family were administered through a relatively trouble-free system. But, as the borders between states became increasingly porous, people moved in search of employment, to build businesses or, simply, because they could. The marriage of people with different [[nationality|nationalities]] or [[domicile (law)|domiciles]] therefore became more common. This has produced serious problems for the [[party (law)|parties]] and for the court systems which are now expected to accept [[jurisdiction]] over persons sometimes only transiently within their territorial boundaries, and to enforce the [[enforcement of foreign judgments|judgment]]s and orders of ''foreign'' courts. These more technical problems can be made worse by any personal animosity between the parties which contributed to the marital breakdown. In some more extreme cases, spouses move themselves and/or their assets to other jurisdictions to [[evasion (law)|evade]] their obligations or liabilities, or they move to establish [[personal jurisdiction]] so that they can engage in [[forum shopping]]. Hence, suppose a [[Germany|German]] man marries a [[Turkey|Turkish]] woman and they live in [[Poland]] until the breakdown, at which point the wife goes to [[Nevada]] because she has heard that the courts of the U.S. allow quick divorces and give generous maintenance and [[property settlement]] awards. When he hears of this plan, the husband moves himself and all his assets to [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] because he has heard that Irish courts do not recognise and enforce U.S. divorce decrees and their ancillary orders.

==The concepts==
The majority of states recognize the family as the natural grouping upon which [[society]] and [[culture]] are based, and guarantee to protect the institution in their [[constitution]]s both as the source of social order and as indispensable to the future welfare of their [[nation]]s. Hence, marriage tends to be treated as a [[morality|moral]] institution (with or without [[religion|religious]] significance) and those who achieve the [[status (law)|status]] of spouse are vested with a number of [[rights]] which can only be varied or terminated by court order. A few states, usually because of their prevailing religion, either prohibit or discourage termination by divorce. But the majority of more secular states make [[no fault divorce]] a relatively automatic process to reflect the reality that the marriage has broken down, sometimes without the need for both parties to attend at a hearing. This has caused a major shift in social policy in many countries because, if divorce is no longer of major juridical significance in the majority of states around the world, the rules for the international recognition and enforcement of foreign divorces also no longer require cautiously framed rules.

==Relevant policies==
Three [[public policy (law)|public policies]] are relevant in the general conflict system:
#Avoiding so-called “[[limping marriage]]s”. Wherever possible, there should be international uniformity in defining a person's marital [[status (law)|status]] so that people will not be treated as married under the law of one state, but not married under the law of another. However, there may be situations in which it would be quite unjust and inappropriate for the courts of one state to be bound by another state's laws as to status (see below).
#''Favor matrimonii'' upholds the validity of all marriages entered into with a genuine commitment. But, as states become increasingly secular and allow the termination of marriage through [[no fault divorce]] and other less confrontational mechanisms, the policy for recognition and enforcement of foreign decrees may be changing from ''favor matrimonii'' to ''favor divortii'' (i.e. upholding the validity of the divorce wherever possible).
#Wherever possible, the results of any litigation should give effect to the legitimate expectations of the parties as to the validity or termination of their marriage.  Most U.S. States have codified this concept with putative spouse laws.  In other words, a minor flaw in the marriage ceremony should not invalidate a marriage. 
#That the application of all rules should, wherever possible, produce predictable and appropriate outcomes. There is a clear benefit that laws should be certain and easy to administer. Courts have the benefit of expert evidence and time in which to conduct their legal analysis. But the same issues arise far more often in everyday situations where immigration officers, social welfare and tax authorities, and businesses will have to decide whether persons claiming an eligibility or a liability based on their status as a spouse are validly married. If conflict rules are obscure and complicated, this can result in real difficulties for all involved.
But the conflict rules must be consistent with the forum's domestic policies in relation to marriage. Hence, the further policy considerations are:
#Even though policies related to community life reflect the views, opinions, and the prejudices of that community, local laws have a strong claim to specify the formal requirements for marriages celebrated within their [[jurisdiction]] (this is, after all, the reason that the ''[[lex loci celebrationis]]'' is usually accepted as the law to determine all formal requirements for the marriage). For example, the public interest requires that marriage ceremonies are performed openly and with due publicity, with all valid marriages properly recorded.
#The public policy underpinning the [[lex fori]] (the law of the forum court) will allow the court to ignore foreign limitations on the right to marry which are considered offensive, e.g. those based on differences of race or ethnic origin, or which allow persons of the same biological sex the [[capacity (law)|capacity]] to marry. However, some states go further, e.g. in the [[United States]], section 283 ''Second Restatement of Conflict of Laws'' provides:
#A marriage which satisfies the requirements of the state where the marriage was contracted will everywhere be recognized as valid unless it violates the strong public policy of another state which had the most significant relationship to the spouses and the marriage at the time of the marriage.” i.e. it introduces a form of proper law test of policy which could potentially lead to the application of a third state's policies which is a confusing possibility.  This principle emulates from the "full faith and credit" clause of Article IV of the Constitution.

==Legal termination of marriage==
A distinction must be made between forms of divorce that are based in a court system administered under a system of law, and divorces that take place in quasi- or extrajudicial setting, i.e. without any formal supervision from the local court system. In both cases, once jurisdiction has been established, the ''lex fori'' will be applied to determine whether the local ground(s) of divorce have been satisfied and, if so, the marriage will be terminated with or without ancillary orders being made.

===Judicial proceedings===
Since this is an issue affecting the status of the parties, the standard choice of law rules would be either:
*the ''[[lex patriae]]'' (the law of nationality) or habitual residence applied in the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] courts (see Article 1 ''Hague Convention on Recognition of Divorces and Legal Separations'' 1970); or
*the ''[[lex domicilii]]'' (the law of the domicile) applied in the [[common law]] courts.
Although the law of the nationality may be reasonably easy to identify since it is often merely a matter of registration in the given country, a person may have, say, a Greek nationality but have had a permanent residence in New York State for twenty years without becoming a [[naturalised]] American. Insisting on a test under Greek law may not produce a fair or relevant result.

In the common law, marriage can produce a common domicile for the spouses with the wife taking the domicile of the husband. This rule is derived from the proposition that a dependent wife will follow her husband in all aspects of her life. Although this provides a convenient law which is usually easy to identify (since the requirements for change of domicile depend on demonstrating an intention to reside indefinitely in the state of choice, the domicile of the husband is difficult to change) it may produce a result in which a person is domiciled in one state but the matrimonial home and all other features of the parties' lives may be in a second state. This problem is aggravated by the rules relating to the revival of the domicile of origin when a domicile of choice is abandoned. For example, a husband with a domicile of origin in [[Japan]] establishes a domicile of choice in [[China]] where he marries a woman with a [[France|French]] domicile. When the relationship breaks down, he abandons his home in China and goes to live in [[Singapore]]. Immediately upon his leaving China, his Japanese domicile revives and his wife's domicile also changes to that of Japan even though she might never have set foot in that country. To avoid both the [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] implications and potentially unfortunate legal consequences implicit in the domicile of dependence, many states have amended their laws to permit women to retain their domcile of origin upon marriage, or to establish a domicile of choice independently of the husband during the subsistence of the marriage. In cases where the spouses have different domiciles, the choice of law rule must refer to both ''lex domicilii''.

Habitual residence may be a more satisfactory connecting factor than domicile because a person's long-term residence would appear to offer a more practical basis for recognition, whatever his or her intentions may be.  Although intention is relevant to establishing a person's habitual residence, it is a less demanding test than for domicile. But it could lead to forum shopping with a [[Petitioner]] living in a state only long enough to establish habitual residence under that state's law and so evade obligations or gain unfair advantages.  All U.S. States have  time periods for establishing ''residency'' before divorce jurisdiction can be granted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Divorce Residency FAQ's|url=http://family.findlaw.com/divorce/divorce-residency-faq-s.html|website=FindLaw|publisher=Thomson Reuters|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Habitual residence has become the leading factor in unraveling a jurisdiction entanglement revolving custody issues raised in a divorce action.  Parents may live in separate states when filing for a divorce.  Divorce laws allow the parents to file the divorce in either state.   However, custody laws only allow jurisdiction to exist in the state where the child or children reside. In 1997 the [[Uniform_Child_Custody_Jurisdiction_And_Enforcement_Act|Uniform Child Custody Enforcement Jurisdiction Act (UCCJEA)]] was created to address the question of which state has jurisdiction over a child custody case.  The UCCJEA primarily rules jurisdiction goes with the state of habitual residence of the child.  

Within the [[European Union]], but excluding the member nation of Denmark, Regulation 2201/2003 (known as Brussels II) sets out the rules on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and in matters of [[parental responsibility (access and custody)|parental responsibility]] for children of both spouses except for orders relating to matrimonial property. Jurisdiction is allowed to the courts of the Member State in which one or both spouses had a common domicile, a common [[nationality]] or were habitually resident. Once proceedings have been initiated, other states must refuse jurisdiction. Once a court accepts jurisdiction, it is for the ''lex fori'' to apply its own choice of law rules: both [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and the [[United Kingdom]] apply the ''lex domicilii''; the other EU states apply the law of habitual residence.

===Quasi- or extra-legal proceedings===
The most common forms of quasi-legal divorce are the [[Islam]]ic forms of divorce known as the [[Talaq (Nikah)|talaq]] and its less well-regulated version of [[triple talaq]], and the form of divorce in [[Judaism]] known as the ''[[get (conflict)|get]]'' which is regulated by the [[Beth Din]] (see [http://www.jlaw.com/Articles/divorcebeit.html]). Unlike the talaq, the process to obtain a ''get'' must occur at a specific place and with specified documents.

====The talaq====
For a discussion of the relationship between the talaq and secular laws, see [[talaq (conflict)|talaq in non-Islamic states]]. Otherwise, there is a clear public policy need to consider whether, in an increasingly multi-racial and multi-ethnic society, transnational Islamic divorces can or should be recognized. For these purposes, a distinction is usually drawn between the Nikah form of talaq which is the normative form of ''procedural'' talaq, and the classical ''bare'' form of talaq which is used in [[India]] and in [[Azad Kashmir]].

If the talaq is executed in a state where it is effective to terminate the marriage, this potentially affects the [[status (law)|status]] and [[capacity (law)|capacity]] of the spouses so that they are then free to remarry. Within the conflict system, the [[enforcement of foreign judgments]] is a reasonably well-regulated area. But this form of divorce is only quasi-judicial at best, so it falls outside the normal rules. The general expectation as to choice of law depends on the [[characterization (conflict)|characterization]] of the issue. As a form of divorce, the rule might be that the ''lex loci actus'' (the law of the place where the transaction took place) should be applied and recognized universally so that the parties would avoid a limping marriage (i.e. that whether they are considered married will change depending on which states they visit or reside in). However, this may be against public policy because one of the parties is seeking to evade some mandatory provisions of law or it is not in the best interests of any children (see ''[[parens patriae]]''). If the characterization is status/capacity, this will be determined under the ''lex domicilii'' (the law of the domicile) in a [[common law]] state, and under the ''lex patriae'' (the law of the nationality) or habitual residence in a [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] state. Alternatively, the court seized of the matter might apply the ''lex fori'' (the municipal law of the forum state).

The best answer is always to produce an ''[[in rem]]'' solution, i.e. wherever possible, the result must be accepted in the majority of states around the world. Thus, if the talaq is effective under the ''lex loci actus'' and recognized under the laws relevant to determine status and capacity, it will be recognized so long as the best interests of the children are protected in any orders or agreements made by the parties. For example, in [[English law]], Part II of the Family Law Act 1986 draws the distinction between a divorce obtained by "judicial or other proceedings" and the divorce obtained "otherwise than by means of proceedings". The Nikah form is recognized in UK if:
*it is effective by the ''lex loci actus'' (the law of the place where it was obtained), and
*at the relevant date, either party was:
::habitually resident in,
::domiciled either in accordance with the local law or English law, or
::a national of that foreign country.
But a "bare" talaq will only be recognized in UK if:
*it is effective by the law of the country where it was obtained and
*at the relevant date, each party was domiciled in that country (or if only one was domiciled in that country, then the other was domiciled in another country where the bare talaq was recognized).
'''And''' no recognition will be allowed if one of the parties has been habitually resident in the UK throughout the period of one year immediately preceding the pronouncement. The intention is to prevent one spouse from evading the local judicial system by traveling to a country that does permit the talaq.

====The Get====
{{see also|Get (divorce document)}}

The discussion as to choice of law for the talaq is the same and, applying the [[Family Law Act 1986]], the ''get'' qualifies under the first limb as "judicial or other proceedings".

====Japanese divorce====
[[Japan]]ese family law is designed to encourage the private resolution of family issues. Under the "family registration" (''koseki'') system, changes in family status and relationships do not require official approval. Article 763 of the Civil Code of Japan authorizes a husband and wife to divorce by mutual agreement (''kyogi rikon'' divorces), and more than 90% of all Japanese divorces adopt this fast, simple and entirely non-judicial procedure. ''Kyogi rikon'' divorces are entirely non-judicial without the involvement of lawyers or any tribunal. The only requirements are that each spouse should sign a form, known as a ''rikon todoke'', in front of two witnesses, and that the form should be filed with the local registration office. The parties do not need to make any appearance at the registry office. International couples may obtain a consent divorce in Japan if one of them is a Japanese citizen: Horei Law on the Application of Laws, Law No. 10 of 1898 (as amended 2001), Art. 16. If the parties cannot agree, judicial divorces may be obtained through the court system.

The standard consent divorces (''kyogi rikon'') have been recognised as "proceedings" within the meaning of the Family Law Act 1986,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.familylawweek.co.uk/site.aspx?i=ed1852&lt;/ref&gt;  such divorces can be recognized if either spouse was domiciled in Japan at the time.

===Maintenance===
In the [[European Union|EU]], Regulation 44/2001 of 22 December 2000 on ''Jurisdiction and the Recognition and Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters'' (known as Brussels I) and Regulation 805/2004 of 21 April 2004 in respect of ''Uncontested Claims'' allow the almost automatic enforcement of all orders affecting maintenance when the parties are domiciled or habitually resident in the [[Member States]] with the exception of [[Denmark]]. The only exceptions are that enforcement would breach public policy in some way, the maintenance order cannot be reconciled with another judgment, or the application to enforce is "out of time".

The [[United Nations]] [[Convention on the Recovery Abroad of Maintenance]] ("New York Convention") enables the transnational recovery of maintenance by creating a Central Authority for Maintenance Recovery in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform which is responsible for transmitting and receiving maintenance claims under the Convention.

Quick Divorce in the Dominican Republic is available to foreigners or Dominican citizens residing abroad, when both spouses agree to file this divorce before Dominican Courts. This procedure is very simple and only requires the attendance of one of the spouses during the hearing which takes usually less than half an hour and you can leave Dominican Republic the same day in the afternoon. It takes ten to fifteen days to obtain a divorce decree, which is to be sent to your home or office by courier (DHL or FedEx).

The parties should sign a settlement agreement revised by an attorney in their jurisdiction in order to confirm it complies with spouses local laws. This document should include spouses complete data, a list of property, or statement of non-property, the statement regarding minor children and support agreement, your desire of divorcing before a Dominican Court and the authorization of one of the spouses to the other to attend to hearing on her/his behalf. The settlement agreement can be drafted by an attorney in your jurisdiction.

[[File:52-aspetti di vita quotidiana, amore,Taccuino Sanitatis, Cas.jpg|thumb|240px|Illustration from ''[[Tacuinum Sanitatis]]'', a medieval handbook on wellness.]]
In many traditions and statutes of civil or religious law, the '''consummation of a marriage''', often called simply ''consummation'', is the first (or first officially credited) act of [[sexual intercourse]] between two people, either following their [[marriage]] to each other or after a prolonged romantic attraction. The definition of consummation usually refers to penile-vaginal sexual penetration, but some religious doctrines hold that there is an additional requirement that there must ''not'' be any [[contraception]] used.&lt;ref name="pcd"&gt;{{cite book | last=Hardon, S.J. | first=John | authorlink=John Hardon | isbn=0-385-23238-1 | title=Pocket Catholic Dictionary | page=91 | publisher=Image Books | contribution=Consummated Marriage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The religious, cultural, or legal significance of consummation may arise from theories of marriage as having the purpose of producing legally recognized descendants of the partners, or of providing sanction to their sexual acts together, or both, and its absence may amount to treating a marriage ''ceremony'' as falling short of ''completing'' the state of being married, or as creating a marriage which may later be repudiated. Thus in some legal systems a marriage may be [[annulled]] if it has not been consummated. Consummation is also relevant in the case of a [[common law marriage]]. The importance of consummation has led to the development of various [[bedding ritual]]s.

In addition to these formal and literal usages, the term also exists in informal and less precise usage to refer to a sexual landmark in relationships of varying intensity and duration.

==Legislation==

===Civil marriage===

The relevance of consummation in a [[civil marriage]] varies by jurisdiction. For example, under section 12 of the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1973]], a refusal or inability to consummate a marriage is a ground of [[Annulment#Annulment in England and Wales|annulment in England and Wales]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1973/18?view=extent#section-12 Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 (c. 18), s. 12] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180511201916/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1973/18?view=extent |date=2018-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but this only applies to heterosexual marriage, because Paragraph 4 of schedule 4 of the [[Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013]] specifically excludes non-consummation as a ground for the annulment of a [[same-sex marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2013/30/schedule/4/paragraph/4|title=Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315132422/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2013/30/schedule/4/paragraph/4|archivedate=2016-03-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[common law]] jurisdictions, such as [[Australia]], have abolished the legal concept of consummation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.familylawcourts.gov.au/wps/wcm/connect/FLC/Home/Publications/Family+Court+of+Australia+publications/FCOA_Applying_decree_nullity |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-12-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527114938/http://familylawcourts.gov.au/wps/wcm/connect/FLC/Home/Publications/Family+Court+of+Australia+publications/FCOA_Applying_decree_nullity |archivedate=2015-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'''Note''': in Australia non-consummation as ground of annulment was abolished in 1975; see Dickey, A. (2007) ''Family Law'' (5th Ed) Also in 1975, Australia introduced no-fault divorce, so specific grounds of divorce such as adultery, cruelty, desertion, have all been abolished.{{cite web |url=http://www.familylawcourts.gov.au/wps/wcm/connect/FLC/Home/Family+Law+Principles/No+fault+divorce/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316232908/http://www.familylawcourts.gov.au/wps/wcm/connect/FLC/Home/Family+Law+Principles/No+fault+divorce/ |archivedate=2015-03-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Common law marriage===

{{Main article|Common-law marriage|Common-law marriage in the United States}}
In this case, usually, consummation, as well as cohabitation, are important, they are needed - together with the presentation of the parties to society as spouses - in order to create the marriage itself.

===Religious marriage===

A religious marriage without civil registration may or may not be legally binding. However, in some (mostly [[Muslim]]-majority) countries such as Israel, Egypt, Syria,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = UNHCR | url = http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/topic,464db4f52,465161be2,3ae6ad796b,0.html | title = Syria: Social repercussions of a marriage between a male Druze and a Muslim woman | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121019190012/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/topic,464db4f52,465161be2,3ae6ad796b,0.html | archivedate = 2012-10-19 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jordan,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://jordan.usembassy.gov/acs_marriage_in_jordan2.html |title=Marriage in Jordan |publisher=Jordan embassy |place=USA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006030656/http://jordan.usembassy.gov/acs_marriage_in_jordan2.html |archivedate=2011-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; UAE,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.dubaifaqs.com/marriage-in-dubai.php | title = Marriage and weddings | publisher = Dubai, UAE FAQs | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110903010415/http://www.dubaifaqs.com/marriage-in-dubai.php | archivedate = 2011-09-03 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Libya, Mauritania and Indonesia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://bccvisalaw.com/marriage/marriage_in_indonesia.php | title = Marriage in Indonesia | publisher = BCC Visa Law | deadurl = no | archiveurl = http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110920040604/http://bccvisalaw.com/marriage/marriage_in_indonesia.php | archivedate = 2011-09-20 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  religious marriage is the only legally binding marriage.

Consummation is in particular relevant in a [[Marriage in  the Catholic Church|Catholic marriage]]. Within the [[Catholicism|Roman Catholic Church]], if a matrimonial celebration takes place (ratification) but the spouses have not yet engaged in intercourse (consummation), then the marriage is said to be a marriage ''[[ratum sed non consummatum]]''. Such a marriage, regardless of the reason for non-consummation, can be dissolved by the [[pope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P6R.HTM|title=Code of Canon Law - IntraText|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070105060902/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P6R.HTM|archivedate=2007-01-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, an inability or an intentional refusal to consummate the marriage is probable grounds for an [[Declaration of nullity|annulment]]. [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Catholic canon law]] defines a marriage as consummated when the "spouses have performed between themselves in a human fashion a conjugal act which is suitable in itself for the procreation of offspring, to which marriage is ordered by its nature and by which the spouses become one flesh."&lt;ref&gt;canon 1061 §1&lt;/ref&gt; Thus some theologians, such as [[John Hardon|Fr. John A. Hardon, S.J.]], state that intercourse with [[contraception]] does not consummate a marriage.&lt;ref name="pcd"/&gt;

==Traditions==
Traditionally, in many cultures, for example in Middle Eastern and South Asian cultures (where Islam and Hinduism is followed and sex before marriage is not allowed), consummation was an important act because it was the act which proved the bride's [[virginity]]; the presence of blood was erroneously taken as definitive confirmation that the woman was indeed a virgin.&lt;ref&gt;''Marriage Customs of the World: From Henna to Honeymoons'', by George Monger, pp 82-84&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
In the [[family law]] defining [[civil marriage]] in some jurisdictions, particularly those where the civil [[marriage law]]s remain influenced by [[religion]] (albeit they are officially secular) non-consummation of a marriage may be a ground for [[annulment]] (an annulment is different from a [[divorce]] because it usually acts retrospectively). This stipulation has been in recent years heavily criticized on a wide variety of grounds, ranging from the mixing of religious doctrine into secular law, to being degrading to women given its negative historical connotations of ownership of the wife.&lt;ref name="Family Law pp. 96-99"&gt;''Family Law: Text, Cases, and Materials'', by Sonia Harris-Short, Joanna Miles, pp. 96-99&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that the purpose of this ground is not clear: it is neither procreation (the act need not end in pregnancy, and neither is there a need of the ''possibility'' of it, given the fact the consummation is legally valid even if one or both parties is sterile), neither is it the expectation of sexual satisfaction in marriage (one single act of sexual intercourse is sufficient, even if the spouse following the consummation says he/she will never again engage in intercourse).&lt;ref&gt;''Body Lore and Laws Essays on Law and the Human Body'', edited by: Andrew Bainham, Shelley Day Sclater, Martin Richards, pp 171- 182&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Bainham argues that this law (in [[England and Wales]]) is outdated and must be abolished "in a modern society committed to equality and human rights in personal relationships".&lt;ref&gt;''Body Lore and Laws Essays on Law and the Human Body'', edited by: Andrew Bainham, Shelley Day Sclater, Martin Richards, pp 175&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2001 report, the Law Society’s Law Reform Committee of [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] advocated abolishing the concept of a [[voidable marriage]] altogether (since divorce had been introduced in 1996) and criticized the consummation ground, writing the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lawsociety.ie/Documents/committees/lawreform/Nullity2.pdf|title=Page Not Found|author=|date=|website=www.lawsociety.ie|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304092125/https://www.lawsociety.ie/Documents/committees/lawreform/Nullity2.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:The rationale behind this ground is not immediately apparent. It is not concerned with the capacity of either or both parties to procreate, still less with the ability of the parties to satisfy each other sexually during the marriage. [...] It remains a rather curious anomaly in the law, a relic perhaps of medieval times, when the first act of intercourse was thought to 'mark' a new bride as the 'property' of her husband. Whatever its origins, it is not entirely clear what modern purpose this ground serves and it is suggested that it should be dispensed with.

Another concern is [[sexual violence]], especially since in most countries the criminalization of [[marital rape]] is recent, having occurred from the 1970s onwards; the maintaining in law of the concept of consummation is argued to foster cultural and societal attitudes and understandings of marriage that make it more difficult to acknowledge these violations; and to be a remainder of an oppressive tradition.&lt;ref name="Family Law pp. 96-99"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solicitorsjournal.com/blog/case-point-consummation-legal-oddity|title=Case in point - Is consummation a legal oddity? - Solicitors Journal|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416100405/http://www.solicitorsjournal.com/blog/case-point-consummation-legal-oddity|archivedate=2015-04-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on the case of ''R v R'', which criminalised marital rape in England and Wales, Harris-Short and Miles write:

:[A] historical view again throws useful light on the matter: until 1991, husbands were permitted to have sexual intercourse with their wives regardless of whether they were then actually consenting, the husband to sexual relations thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;''Family Law: Text, Cases, and Materials'', by Sonia Harris-Short, Joanna Miles, pp. 96&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1991/12.html|title=R. v R [1991] UKHL 12 (23 October 1991)|website=Bailii.org|accessdate=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David D. Siegel''' was an American law professor and legal commentator.

== Education ==

Siegel had a [[B.A.]] from [[Brooklyn College]], a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] from [[St. John's University School of Law]], and an [[LL.M.]] from [[New York University School of Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Siegel|first=David|title=A RETROSPECTIVE ON BABCOCK v. JACKSON: A PERSONAL VIEW|journal=Albany Law Review|year=1993|volume=56|page=693}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publications ==

Siegel was the author of numerous works of legal commentary on the laws of the [[New York State]].  He is widely acknowledged to have been among the preeminent experts in the area of New York Civil Practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Connors|first=Patrick|title=The King of New York Practice|journal=Albany Law Review|year=2009|volume=72|page=447}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He has been referred to by former New York Chief Judge [[Judith Kaye]] as the New York Court of Appeals' "favorite Master of the Art of Civil Practice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaye|first=Judith|title=Remarks of Chief Judge Kaye|journal=Albany Law Review|year=209|volume=72|issue=2|page=399|url=http://www.albanylawreview.org/articles/03%20Kaye.pdf%20|accessdate=2013-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His writings are known for providing practical commentary to practicing attorneys, an art often lost in legal academic publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shoot|first=Brian|title=The One and Only|journal=Albany Law Review|year=2009|volume=72|pages=458–59|url=http://www.albanylawreview.org/articles/13%20Shoot.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Siegel is best known for the legal treatise "New York Practice", a mainstay of legal libraries in New York.  He is also the author of ''Siegel's Practice Commentaries'', the ''New York State Law Digest'', ''Conflict of Laws in a Nutshell, 3d. Edition'', and numerous commentaries in ''McKinney's New York Laws'' and the [[United States Code Annotated#Annotated codes|''United States Code Annotated'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Siegel|first=David|title=About the Author|url=http://www.siegelspracticereview.com/05auth/|accessdate=2013-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; His commentaries have been cited in opinions issued by the [[United States Supreme Court]] and other federal appellate courts, as well as more than two hundred and fifty times by the [[New York Court of Appeals]] and over three thousand times by the trial level and intermediate appellate courts of New York State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Connors|first=Patrick|title=The King of New York Practice|journal=Albany Law Review|year=2009|volume=72|pages=450, 455}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Teaching and professional life ==

Siegel began teaching at Albany Law School in 1972 and retired from active teaching in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Siegel, David D.: Biography|url=http://www.albanylaw.edu/faculty/pages/faculty-listing.aspx?ind=Siegel,%20David%20D.|publisher=Albany Law School|accessdate=April 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="albanylawreview"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaye|first=Judith|title=Remarks of Chief Judge Kaye|journal=Albany Law Review|year=209|volume=72|issue=2|page=398|url=http://www.albanylawreview.org/articles/03%20Kaye.pdf%20|accessdate=2013-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to and concurrent with his teaching at Albany, Siegel taught at [[St. John's University School of Law]].&lt;ref name="albanylawreview" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Siegel|first=David|title=My Life in Paper|journal=New York State Bar Ass'n Journal|year=2006|volume=78|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seigel also served on several state legislative committees, drafting the New York City Civil Court Act, the Uniform Justice Court Act, the Uniform City Court Act, and the Uniform District Court Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Connors|first=Patrick|title=The King of New York Practice|journal=Albany Law Review|year=2009|volume=72|pages=450–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21415">'''Disparate impact''' in [[United States labor law]] refers to practices in employment, housing, and other areas that adversely affect one group of people of a protected characteristic more than another, even though rules applied by employers or landlords are formally neutral. Although the protected classes vary by statute, most federal civil rights laws protect based on race, color, religion, national origin, and sex as protected traits, and some laws include disability status and other traits as well.

A violation of Title VII of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|1964 Civil Rights Act]] may be proven by showing that an employment practice or policy has a disproportionately adverse effect on members of the protected class as compared with non-members of the protected class.&lt;ref name="EEOC v. Sambo pp. 86, 92"&gt;EEOC v. Sambo's of Georgia, Inc., 530 F. Supp. 86, 92 (N.D. Ga. 1981)&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the disparate impact theory under Title VII prohibits employers "from using a facially neutral employment practice that has an unjustified adverse impact on members of a protected class. A facially neutral employment practice is one that does not appear to be discriminatory on its face; rather it is one that is discriminatory in its application or effect."&lt;ref name=free&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Disparate+Impact|title=Disparate Impact|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where a disparate impact is shown, the plaintiff can prevail without the necessity of showing intentional discrimination unless the defendant employer demonstrates that the practice or policy in question has a demonstrable relationship to the requirements of the job in question.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 91 S. Ct. 849, 28 L. Ed. 2d 158 (1977)&lt;/ref&gt;  This is the "business necessity" defense.&lt;ref name="EEOC v. Sambo pp. 86, 92"/&gt;

In addition to Title VII, other federal laws also have disparate impact provisions, including the [[Age Discrimination in Employment Act|Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967]].&lt;ref&gt;''Smith v. City of Jackson, Mississippi'', 544 U.S. 228 (2005), https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/03-1160.ZS.html&lt;/ref&gt; Some civil rights laws, such as [[Civil Rights Act of 1964#Title VI|Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]], do not contain disparate impact provisions creating a private right of action,&lt;ref&gt;''Alexander v. Sandoval'', 532 U.S. 275 (2001), https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/99-1908.ZS.html&lt;/ref&gt; although the federal government may still pursue disparate impact claims under these laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/cor/coord/vimanual.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150716075010/http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/cor/coord/vimanual.php |archivedate=2015-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Supreme Court has held that the [[Civil Rights Act of 1968|Fair Housing Act of 1968]] creates a cause of action for disparate impact.&lt;ref name="supremecourt.gov"&gt;https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-1371_m64o.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
Disparate impact contrasts with [[disparate treatment]].  A disparate impact is unintentional, whereas a disparate treatment is an intentional decision to treat people differently based on their race or other protected characteristics.

==Adverse impact==
While disparate impact is a legal theory of liability under Title VII, adverse impact is one element of that doctrine, which measures the effect an employment practice has on a class protected by Title VII. In the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures, an adverse impact is defined as a "substantially different rate of selection in hiring, promotion, or other employment decision which works to the disadvantage of members of a race, sex, or ethnic group".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.uniformguidelines.com/uniformguidelines.html#129|title = Uniform guidelines on employee selection procedures|publisher = uniformguidelines.com|quote = Adverse impact. ”A substantially different rate of selection in hiring, promotion, or other employment decision which works to the disadvantage of members of a race, sex, or ethnic group. See section 4 of these guidelines.|accessdate = November 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "substantially different" rate is typically defined in government enforcement or Title VII litigation settings using the 80% Rule, statistical significance tests, and/or practical significance tests. Adverse impact is often used interchangeably with "disparate impact," which was a legal term coined in one of the most significant U.S. Supreme Court rulings on disparate or adverse impact: ''[[Griggs v. Duke Power Co.]]'', 1971. Adverse Impact does not mean that an individual in a majority group is given preference over a minority group. However, having adverse impact does mean that there is the "potential" for discrimination in the hiring process and it could warrant investigation.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Ph.D., Amie (May 31, 2011). [http://www.selectinternational.com/blog/bid/112225/The-Big-AI "The Big AI"]. ''[[Select International, Inc.]]''. Retrieved May 31st, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The 80% rule==
The 80% test was originally framed by a panel of 32 professionals (called the Technical Advisory Committee on Testing, or TACT) assembled by the State of California Fair Employment Practice Commission (FEPC) in 1971, which published the State of California Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures in October, 1972. This was the first official government document that listed the 80% test in the context of adverse impact, and was later codified in the 1978 Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures, a document used by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), Department of Labor, and Department of Justice in Title VII enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dan Biddle |title=Adverse Impact And Test Validation: A Practitioner's Guide to Valid And Defensible Employment Testing |publisher=Gower Technical Press |location=Aldershot, Hants, England |year= |pages=2–5 |isbn=0-566-08778-2 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures provided a simple "80 percent" rule for determining that a company's selection system was having an "adverse impact" on a minority group. The rule was based on the rates at which job applicants were hired. For example, if XYZ Company hired 50 percent of the men applying for work in a predominantly male occupation while hiring only 20 percent of the female applicants, one could look at the ratio of those two hiring rates to judge whether there might be a discrimination problem. The ratio of 20:50 means that the rate of hiring for female applicants is only 40 percent of the rate of hiring for male applicants. That is, 20 divided by 50 equals 0.40, which is equivalent to 40 percent. Clearly, 40 percent is well below the 80 percent that was arbitrarily set as an acceptable difference in hiring rates. Therefore, in this example, XYZ Company could have been called upon to prove that there was a legitimate reason for hiring men at a rate so much higher than the rate of hiring women. Since the 1980s, courts in the U.S. have questioned the arbitrary nature of the 80 percent rule, making the rule less important than it was when the Uniform Guidelines were first published. A recent memorandum from the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunities Commission suggests that a more defensible standard would be based on comparing a company's hiring rate of a particular group with the rate that would occur if the company simply selected people at random.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eeoc.gov/eeoc/meetings/archive/5-16-07/index.html|title=May 16, 2007 Meeting - Employment Testing and Screening|website=eeoc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, if a company's selection system made it statistically more difficult than pure chance for a member of a certain group, such as women or African-Americans, to get a job, then this could be reasonably viewed as evidence that the selection system was systematically screening out members of that social group.

==More advanced testing==
The concept of practical significance for adverse impact was first introduced by Section 4D of the Uniform Guidelines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.uniformguidelines.com/uniformguidelines.html#18|title=Adverse impact and the "four-fifths rule."|publisher = uniformguidelines.com|accessdate = November 14, 2007|quote = Smaller differences in selection rate may nevertheless constitute adverse impact, where they are significant in both statistical and practical terms}}&lt;/ref&gt; which states "Smaller differences in selection rate may nevertheless constitute adverse impact, where they are significant in both statistical and practical terms ..." Several federal court cases have applied practical significance tests to adverse impact analyses to assess the "practicality" or "stability" of the results. This is typically done by evaluating the change to the statistical significance tests after hypothetically changing focal group members selection status from "failing" to "passing" (see for example, ''Contreras v. City of Los Angeles'' (656 F.2d 1267, 9th Cir. 1981); ''U.S. v. Commonwealth of Virginia'' (569 F.2d 1300, 4th Cir. 1978); and ''Waisome v. Port Authority'' (948 F.2d 1370, 1376, 2d Cir. 1991)).

==Unintentional discrimination==
This form of discrimination occurs where an employer does not intend to discriminate; to the contrary, it occurs when identical standards or procedures are applied to everyone, despite the fact that they lead to a substantial difference in employment outcomes for the members of a particular group '''and''' they are unrelated to successful job performance. An important thing to note is that disparate impact is '''not''', in and of itself, illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Herman Aguinis |author2=Cascio, Wayne F. |title=Applied Psychology in Human Resource Management (6th Edition) |publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] |location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J |year= |pages= |isbn=0-13-148410-9 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because disparate impact only becomes illegal if the employer cannot justify the employment practice causing the adverse impact as a "job related for the position in question and consistent with business necessity" (called the "business necessity defense").&lt;ref&gt;1964/1991 Civil Rights Act, Section 2000e-2[k] [1] [A]&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a fire department requiring applicants to carry a 100 [[pound (mass)|lb]] (50&amp;nbsp;kg) pack up three flights of stairs. The upper-body strength required typically has an adverse impact on women. The fire department would have to show that this requirement is necessary and job-related. This typically requires employers to conduct validation studies that address both the Uniform Guidelines and professional standards. Accordingly, a fire department could be liable for "discriminating" against female job applicants solely because it failed to prove to a court's satisfaction that the 100-pound requirement was "necessary", even though the department never intended to hinder women's ability to become firefighters.

Disparate impact is not the same as [[disparate treatment]]. Disparate treatment refers to the "intentional" discrimination of certain people groups during the hiring, promoting or placement process.

==The Fair Housing Act==

The disparate impact theory has application also in the housing context under Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, also known as The [[Fair Housing Act]],.  The ten federal appellate courts that have addressed the issue have all determined that one may establish a Fair Housing Act violation through the disparate impact theory of liability.  The [[U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development]]'s [[Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity]], the federal government which administers the [[Fair Housing Act]], issued a proposed regulation on November 16, 2011 setting forth how HUD applies disparate impact in Fair Housing Act cases. On February 8, 2013, HUD issued its Final Rule.&lt;ref&gt; [http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/press/press_releases_media_advisories/2013/HUDNo.13-022]&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court had not yet determined whether the Fair Housing Act allowed for claims of disparate impact. This question reached the Supreme Court twice since 2012, first in ''Magner v. Gallagher'' and then in ''Township of Mount Holly v. Mount Holly Gardens Citizens''. The Supreme Court seemed likely to rule that the Act does not contain a disparate impact provision, but both cases settled before the Court could issue a decision. The federal government appeared to pressure the settlement in one or both cases in an effort to preserve the disparate impact theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-mount-holly-vote-1384358912|title=The Mount Holly Vote|date=13 November 2013|publisher=|via=www.wsj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oversight.house.gov/release/grassley-goodlatte-and-issa-release-report-how-assistant-attorney-general-thomas-perez-manipulated-justice-and-ignored-the-rule-of-law/|title=Grassley, Goodlatte and Issa Release Report: How Assistant Attorney General Thomas Perez Manipulated Justice and Ignored the Rule of Law - United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openmarket.org/2013/09/13/cei-opposes-risky-race-conscious-federal-lending-requirements-in-supreme-court-case/|title=CEI Opposes Risky, Race-Conscious Federal Lending Requirements in Supreme Court Case|date=13 September 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 25, 2015, by a 5–4 decision in ''[[Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs v. Inclusive Communities Project]],'' the Supreme Court held&lt;ref name="supremecourt.gov"/&gt; that disparate-impact claims are cognizable under the Fair Housing Act. In an opinion by Justice Kennedy, "Recognition of disparate-impact claims is also consistent with the central purpose of the FHA, which, like Title VII and the ADEA, was enacted to eradicate discriminatory practices within a sector of the Nation's economy. Suits targeting unlawful zoning laws and other housing restrictions that unfairly exclude minorities from certain neighborhoods without sufficient justification are at the heartland of disparate-impact liability...Recognition of disparate impact liability under the FHA plays an important role in uncovering discriminatory intent: it permits plaintiffs to counteract unconscious prejudices and disguised animus that escape easy classification as disparate treatment." Under the Court's ruling in Inclusive Communities, in order to prove a case of disparate impact housing discrimination, the following must occur:
* First, a plaintiff must make out a prima facie case, drawing an explicit, causal connection between a policy or practice and the disparate impact or statistical disparity. As Justice Kennedy wrote, "A disparate-impact claim relying on a statistical disparity must fail if the plaintiff cannot point to a defendant's policy or policies causing that disparity." Justice Kennedy also noted that "policies are not contrary to the disparate-impact requirement unless they are artificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary barriers."
* Second, a defendant must have the opportunity to prove that the policy is necessary to achieve a valid interest. If a defendant can't not prove that, then a plaintiff's claim of disparate impact must prevail.
* Finally, if a defendant has shown that the policy is necessary to achieve a valid interest, the plaintiff must then show that there is "an available alternative ... practice that has less disparate impact and serves the [entity's] legitimate needs." If a plaintiff cannot do so, then their disparate impact claim must fail.

==Controversy==

The disparate impact theory of liability is controversial for several reasons. First, it labels certain unintended effects as "discriminatory", although discrimination is not an intentional act. Second, the theory is in tension with disparate treatment provisions under civil rights laws as well as the U.S. Constitution's guarantee of [[equal protection]]. For example, if the hypothetical fire department discussed above used the 100-pound requirement, that policy might disproportionately exclude female job applicants from employment. Under the 80% rule mentioned above, unsuccessful female job applicants would have a prima facie case of disparate impact "discrimination" against the department if they passed the 100-pound test at a rate less than 80% of the rate at which men passed the test. In order to avoid a lawsuit by the female job applicants, the department might refuse to hire anyone from its applicant pool—in other words, the department may refuse to hire anyone because too many of the successful job applicants were male. Thus, the employer would have intentionally discriminated against the successful male job applicants because of their gender, and that likely amounts to illegal disparate treatment and a violation of the Constitution's right to equal protection. In the 2009 case ''[[Ricci v. DeStefano]]'', the U.S. Supreme Court did rule that a fire department ''committed'' illegal disparate treatment by refusing to promote white firefighters, in an effort to ''avoid'' disparate impact liability in a potential lawsuit by black and Hispanic firefighters who disproportionately failed the required tests for promotion. Although the Court in that case did not reach the constitutional issue, [[Ricci v. DeStefano#Concurrence|Justice Scalia's concurring opinion]] suggested the fire department also violated the constitutional right to equal protection. Even before ''Ricci'', lower federal courts have ruled that actions taken to avoid potential disparate impact liability violate the constitutional right to equal protection. One such case is [https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-7th-circuit/1335447.html ''Biondo v. City of Chicago, Illinois''], from the [[7th Circuit|Seventh Circuit]].

In 2013, the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC) filed a suit, ''EEOC v. FREEMAN'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mdd.uscourts.gov/Opinions/Opinions/EEOC%20v.%20Freeman%20%5b09-2573%5d%20Memorandum%20Opinion%20and%20Order%208.9.13.pd|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130903055134/http://www.mdd.uscourts.gov/Opinions/Opinions/EEOC%20v.%20Freeman%20%5b09-2573%5d%20Memorandum%20Opinion%20and%20Order%208.9.13.pdf|title=EEOC v. Freeman.09cv2573. Memo Opinion-RWT Edits of 8.5.13|archivedate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; against the use of typical criminal-background and credit checks during the hiring process.  While admitting that there are many legitimate and race-neutral reasons for employers to screen out convicted criminals and debtors, the EEOC presented the theory that this practice is discriminatory because minorities in the U.S. are more likely to be convicted criminals with bad credit histories than white Americans.  Ergo, employers should have to include criminals and debtors in their hiring.  In this instance U.S. District Judge Roger Titus ruled firmly against the disparate impact theory, stating that EEOC's action had been "a theory in search of facts to support it."  "By bringing actions of this nature, the EEOC has placed many employers in the "Hobson's choice" of ignoring criminal history and credit background, thus exposing themselves to potential liability for criminal and fraudulent acts committed by employees, on the one hand, or incurring the wrath of the EEOC for having utilized information deemed fundamental by most employers.  Something more... must be utilized to justify a disparate impact claim based upon criminal history and credit checks.  To require less, would be to condemn the use of [[common sense]], and this is simply not what the laws of this country require."

The disparate impact theory is especially controversial under the Fair Housing Act because the Act regulates many activities relating to housing, insurance, and mortgage loans—and some scholars have argued that the theory's use under the Fair Housing Act, combined with extensions of the [[Community Reinvestment Act]], contributed to rise of sub-prime lending and the crash of the U.S. housing market and ensuing [[Recession of 2008|global economic recession]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cei.org/blog/affordable-housing-diversity-mandates-caused-mortgage-crisis|title=Affordable Housing, Diversity Mandates Caused Mortgage Crisis|date=5 August 2008|publisher=|author=Hans Bader}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1998">The '''''Edictum Theodorici''''' is a set of laws that date from the 5th or 6th-century and that is one of the codes emanated by Germanic kings to settle issues between Romans and Germans in their kingdoms.

It is composed of a preface, 155 chapters and a conclusion. Its dispositions are mostly taken from Roman Law, such as the ''[[Codex Gregorianus]]'', the ''[[Codex Hermogenianus]]'' and the ''[[Codex Theodosianus]]''.

Its authenticity, differently from before, is no longer in doubt. As for its character the edict is for the most part a restatement and a reworking of Roman legislation; its chief interest stands in implying, differently from most Romano-barbaric codes, a territorial rather than a personal form of power as its provisions treat Romans and Barbarians equally. Explicit differences are made only for [[Jews]], who are to have their own judges.  

The problem of the author of the code is one of the most complicated: since when the ''[[editio princeps]]'' was printed in 1579 due to [[Pierre Pithou]] the text has been attributed to the [[Ostrogoths|Ostrogothic]] king [[Theodoric the Great]], and the Italian origin of the code seems supported by chapter 111, where specific dispositions regarding [[Rome]] are present. Notwithstanding this, the issue has become since 1953 highly controversial, and has been considered to have been emanated by the [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] king [[Theodoric II]], while other have given the paternity to [[Odoacer]], with a number defending the traditional attribution.

The '''Environmental Dispute Resolution Fund''' (EDRF) is a legal aid program based in [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]] that provides grants to individuals, community groups and environmental organizations who need to hire legal representation to assist them in resolving an environmental problem or dispute.  The grants are provided and administered by [[West Coast Environmental Law]], a non-profit environmental law and public advocacy organization, based in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]].  Unlike other public interest environmental law organizations, which use in-house lawyers to provide environmental representation, EDRF funding allows grantees to hire lawyers (at a [[legal aid]] rate) from the private bar.   Funding for the EDRF is provided by the Law Foundation of British Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;On the Ground, http://wcel.org/sites/default/files/publications/On%20The%20Ground.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== How the EDRF works ==

The EDRF provides funding and grants for approved recipients to obtain legal advice to assist with their environmental disputes.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ec.gc.ca/financement-funding/sv-gs/search_results_e.cfm?action=details&amp;id=71&amp;start_row=201&amp;all_records_details=&lt;/ref&gt; The types of legal work funded include: pursuing alternative dispute resolutions; appearing before government tribunals, participating in environmental assessments and challenging government decisions in court.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sthilda.ca/West%20Coast%20e-newsletter%20Fall%202009.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The EDRF was established in 1989, by [[West Coast Environmental Law]]. Bill Andrews, the former Executive Director of West Coast Environmental Law, recalls: 
{{quote|[West Coast Environmental Law] discussed how we could expand our delivery of legal services, get out of Vancouver and meet regional needs … [and] expand the public interest environmental bar in British Columbia … It all came together with the idea of a fund that could pay for environmental help around the province.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}}}

== Notable achievements ==

Between 1989 and 2010, over $4 million were provided to recipients, helping to support and resolve more than 500 legal cases in [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Dispute Resolution Fund, http://wcel.org/environmental-legal-aid/history-our-work&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, [[West Coast Environmental Law]] celebrated the 20-year anniversary of the EDRF. Notable EDRF wins over the past 20 years include:

* '''2008-2009 - Fish farm laws unconstitutional''': Celebrated fish farm opponent and marine biologist [[Alexandra Morton]], with EDRF funding, teamed up with long-time environmental lawyer, Greg McDade, in a successful challenge to the constitutionality of British Columbia’s laws allowing fish farms in its waters, ruling that fish farms fall under federal jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;Comox Valley Echo - Environmental Law Fund celebrates 20 years - http://www2.canada.com/comoxvalleyecho/news/community/story.html?id=5c8fa977-7cf9-477e-b0b0-8938a077f7c8&amp;p=1&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''2005 - Parks for turtles, not developers''': The West Kootenay EcoSociety successfully challenged the plans of the Minister of Parks to relocate Park roads in Grohman Narrows Provincial Park through the habitat of threatened painted turtles to accommodate a local developer.
* '''2003-2008 - Zero Waste Vancouver''': EDRF funding to the Nlaka’pamux Nation Tribal Council and the local Cornwall Watershed Coalition was instrumental in derailing plans to turn the sensitive grasslands at Ashcroft Ranch into a landfill, and convincing [[Metro Vancouver]] to work towards [[zero waste]].
* '''2001-2002 - Marbled murrelets protected''': The Sunshine Coast Conservation Association used EDRF funds to successfully challenge plans to log in the habitat of the endangered [[marbled murrelet]].
* '''1997-2000 - Protecting the Pitt Polder''': A large scale golf resort would have opened the wetland and agricultural lands known as the Pitt Polder, in [[Pitt Meadows]], to development. However, thanks to grants from the EDRF, the Pitt Polder Preservation Society was able to convince the [[British Columbia Court of Appeal]] to throw out bylaws that allowed for the development.
* '''1994 - No logging in Victoria’s Watershed''': The [[Western Canada Wilderness Committee]], with a grant from the EDRF, went to court to challenge commercial logging in the [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] watershed and won.
* '''1992-1994 - Negotiating parks for BC''': When the BC government created the [[Commission on Resources and Environment]] to develop land use plans on [[Vancouver Island]] and in the [[Kootenays]] and the [[Cariboo—Chilcotin|Cariboo-Chilcotin]], the environmental sectors were chronically underfunded. Support from the EDRF helped contribute to a process that saw 100,000 acres of land added to British Columbia’s protected areas every month for three years.
* '''1990-1995 - Blocking the Kemano Completion Project:''' Alcan’s controversial power generation project, which would have destroyed fish habitat on the [[Nechako River]], was defeated in large part due to the efforts of the Rivers Defense Coalition. Thanks to five years of EDRF grants, the Coalition was represented by Andrew Thompson, formerly a [[West Coast Environmental Law]] Honorary Board member, in a court action and BC Utilities Commission hearings, leading to the defeat of the project.

== Summary ==

[[West Coast Environmental Law]] provides approximately $200,000 in EDRF grants each year to a number of different recipients from across [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]].  Through the EDRF it helps individuals, environmental organizations and community organizations use the law to protect their environment.  The EDRF is an incredibly important program that has given a voice to people, communities and environmental organizations, resulting in a number of significant environmental victories.

The '''European Regulators Group for Audiovisual Media Regulators (ERGA)''' is the advisory body consisting of the heads and high level representatives of the EU national regulatory authorities for audiovisual media services. 

Its tasks are:
* 	To advise and assist the Commission, in its work to ensure a consistent implementation in all Member States of the regulatory framework for audiovisual media services;
* 	To assist and advise the Commission, as to any matter related to audiovisual media services within the Commission’s competence;
* 	To provide for an exchange of experience and good practice as to the application of the regulatory framework for audiovisual media services;
* 	To cooperate and provide its members with the information necessary for the application of the Audiovisual Media Services Directive.

In 2017 [https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madeleine_de_Cock_Buning Prof. Dr. Madeleine de Cock Buning], president of the Dutch [https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commissariaat_voor_de_Media Commissariaat voor de Media], is the Chair of ERGA. Damir Hajduk, acting President of the [[Serbs of Croatia|Croatian]] Council for Electronic Media, and Luboš Kukliš, Chief Executive of the Council for Broadcasting and Retransmission of the [[Slovakia|Slovak Republic]], are the Vice-Chairs of ERGA in 2017.

== History ==
ERGA was established by a decision of the [https://ec.europa.eu/commission/index_en European Commission] of 3 February 2014. The Members of ERGA met for the first time in [[Brussels]] on 4 March 2014. It elected its chair and two vice-chairs and adopted its rules of procedure.
In 2016 ERGA published four expert reports on material and territorial jurisdiction, on the independence of national regulatory authorities, and on the protection of minors. These reports consisted of concrete advice to the European Commission regarding the revision of the directive for audiovisual media services. In its proposal to revise this directive of May 2016, the European Commission referred to ERGA’s advice, stating: “ERGA has made a positive contribution towards consistent regulatory practice and has provided high level advice to the Commission on implementation mattters. This calls for the formal recognition and reinforcement of its role in this Directive. The group should therefore be re-established by virtue of this Directive.”
The legislation process to adopt a revised AVMS Directive is still ongoing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6709">{{Main|Fraud}}
'''Extrinsic fraud''' is [[fraud]] that induces one not to present a case in court or deprives one of the opportunity to be heard or is not involved in the actual issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Extrinsic Fraud|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/extrinsic_fraud|website=Wex|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; More broadly, it is defined as:
{{quote|fraudulent acts which keep a person from obtaining information about his/her rights to enforce a contract or getting evidence to defend against a lawsuit. This could include destroying evidence or misleading an ignorant person about the right to sue. Extrinsic fraud is distinguished from "intrinsic fraud," which is the fraud that is the subject of a lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Extrinsic Fraud|url=http://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected=714|website=Law.com|publisher=ALM|accessdate=2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Extrinsic fraud often involves [[fraud upon the court|fraud on the court]], but may arise in other contexts. Extrinsic fraud does not mean merely lying or [[perjury]], nor [[misrepresentation]]s, nor [[intrinsic fraud]], nor "to matters that could have been raised during the divorce proceeding."&lt;ref name=Ellett&gt;''Ellett v. Ellett'', No. 0824-00-2, [[Virginia]], (Cir. Ct. Richmond City 2001), with cases cited therein, found at [http://www.courts.state.va.us/opinions/opncavtx/0824002.txt Virginia state courts website]. Retrieved September 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  It must involve "collateral ... circumstances" such as:
# "bribery of a judge or juror,"
# "fabrication of evidence by an attorney,"
# "preventing another party's witness from appearing,"
# "intentionally failing to join a necessary party," or
# "misleading another party into thinking a continuance had been granted...."&lt;ref name=Ellett /&gt;

==Examples==
===Family law===
{{see also|Paternity fraud}}
Extrinsic fraud may be claimed in [[family law]] and [[domestic relations]] cases. For example, [[Paternity (law)|paternity]] cases are sometimes the subject of extrinsic fraud; the classic case is when a man is encouraged to sign an [[Acknowledgment (law)|acknowledgment]] that he is the father of a newborn baby, thus giving up his right to contest the matter in a [[Paternity (law)|filiation]] action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Draper|first1=Heather|title=Paternity fraud and compensation for misattributed paternity|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|date=August 2007|volume=33|issue=8|pages=475–480|doi=10.1136/jme.2005.013268|pmc=2598159|pmid=17664309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Love v. Love'', the [[Nevada Supreme Court]] ruled that extrinsic fraud had led the putative father to sign an admission against his interest, thus allowing the court to grant [[equitable relief]] to undo the fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Love v. Love, 114 Nev. 572, 959 P.2d 523, 527 (1998)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15814209693472959900|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also may occur when a man fails to appear in court when a paternity suit is filed against him, thus resulting in a [[default judgment]] due to the fraud by his "[[paramour]]".&lt;ref&gt;Denise G. Callahan, "Insufficient evidence of extrinsic fraud leads to reversal in W." Daily Record and the [[Kansas City Daily News-Press]], October 7, 2005, found at [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4181/is_20051007/ai_n15671746 Find Articles website]. "In the best interest of a child, the state of Missouri defended a mother who fooled a man into thinking he had fathered a son.  In ''State of Missouri ex rel. Misty Lowry v. Richard Carter'', the Department of Social Services, Family Support Division appealed Jackson County Judge Sandra Carol Midkiff's ruling that set aside a 1993 default paternity judgment against Carter. The Western District Court of Appeals sided with the state."  Retrieved September 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In such cases, there is a high burden of proof (typically [[moral certainty]] or [[beyond a reasonable doubt]]) of the [[petitioner]] to prove the intrinsic fraud, because of the state's interest "in the [[best interests of the child]]" to ensure that every [[youth|child]] has a [[father]].  That is called [[Estoppel|paternity by estoppel]], in which the putative father is actually prevented from proving he is ''not'' the father due to the high standard of evidence necessary as a matter of law.

===Other examples===
Extrinsic fraud may occur in [[real estate]] transactions or financing, such as when a [[lender]] forces a homeowner to lose his or her [[real property]] in a [[foreclosure]] through acts of fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Voce v. Wachovia Mortgage, FSB|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10796894224547017689|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A lawyer who [[intent (law)|intentionally]] keeps information from his or her client about an upcoming [[Hearing (law)|hearing]] or [[trial]] could be held responsible for extrinsic fraud, as well as being subject to disciplinary action and a [[legal malpractice]] lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Goldberg v. Frye, 217 Cal.App.3d 1258, 266 Cal.Rptr. 483, 489 (1990).|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13570449622292688667|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is at least theoretically possible for a court to [[Injunction|enjoin]] a criminal proceeding, but unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;"Equity Jurisdiction: Enjoining Execution of Criminal Judgment: Extrinsic and Intrinsic Fraud", California Law Review, Vol. 11, No. 4 (May, 1923), pp. 279-282, found at[https://www.jstor.org/pss/3474313 JSTOR website].  Retrieved September 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  A ''[[writ of habeas corpus]]'' or ''[[Coram nobis|writ of error coram nobis]]'' may be possible as well.

An activist in [[Berkeley, California]] sued the [[University of California]] over its long-term plan, for alleged extrinsic fraud.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Brenneman, "Activist Files Motion Calling UC Deal ‘Extrinsic Fraud’", ''[[Berkeley Daily Planet]]'', June 28, 2005, found at 
[http://www.berkeleydailyplanet.com/issue/2005-06-28/article/21705?headline=Activist-Files-Motion-Calling-UC-Deal-Extrinsic-Fraud-By-RICHARD-BRENNEMAN Berkeley Daily Planet website]. Retrieved September 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal meaning in the United States ==
Though many fundamental rights are also widely considered human rights, the classification of a right as "fundamental" invokes specific legal tests courts use to determine the constrained conditions under which the United States government and various state governments may limit these rights. In such legal contexts, courts determine whether rights are fundamental by examining the historical foundations of those rights and by determining whether their protection is part of a longstanding tradition. Individual states may guarantee other rights as fundamental. That is, States may add to fundamental rights but can never diminish or infringe upon fundamental rights by legislative processes. Any such attempt, if challenged, may involve a "strict scrutiny" review in court.

== Specific jurisdictions ==

=== Canada ===
{{Main|Charter of Rights and Freedoms}}
In [[Canada]], the [[Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] outlines four Fundamental Freedoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efc.ca/pages/law/charter/charter.text.html |title=Canadian Charter Of Rights And Freedoms |publisher=Efc.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are freedom of:
* [[Freedom of conscience|Conscience]] and [[freedom of religion|religion]]
* Thought, belief, opinion, and expression, including [[freedom of the press]] and other media of communication
* Peaceful assembly
* Association.

=== European Union ===
{{Main|Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union}}
Europe has no identical doctrine (It would be incompatible with the more restrained role of judicial review in European law.) However, EU law recognizes many of the same human rights and protects them through other means.

See also: [[Copenhagen criteria#Human rights|Copenhagen criteria]], and [[European Convention on Human Rights]], which every member state of the EU has to comply with and for which the [[European Court of Human Rights]] has final appellate jurisdiction.

=== India ===
The Indian fundamental rights, contrasted with such rights contained in the US bill of rights, present several peculiarities.The fundamental rights in India are far more elaborate than in the United States. Thus, for example, the US bill of rights (first ten amendments) only names some rights. The Supreme Court, through the process of judicial review, decides the limitations on these rights.
{{Main|Fundamental Rights in India}}

There are seven main fundamental rights of India:
* right to [[equality before the law|equality]]
* right to freedom, which includes [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of expression|expression]], right to assemble peacefully, freedom to form associations or unions, right to move freely throughout the territory of [[India]], right to reside or settle in any part of the territory of [[India]], right to practice any profession or to carry on any occupation. 
* right to [[freedom of religion]]
* right against [[exploitation of labour|exploitation]]
* cultural and [[right to education|educational rights]]
* right to constitutional remedies
* right to vote(but above 18 years)

Newly implemented 7th Fundamental right in India is
* right to education

It was added in the constitution after the 86th amendment in the year 2002 under article 21A. It is the most recently implemented fundamental right. The RTE Act enabled this right in the year 2010.

A recent addition was made to the list of fundamental rights in India in 2017.
* right to privacy.

=== United States ===
In American [[United States constitutional law|Constitutional Law]], ''fundamental rights'' have special significance under the [[U.S. Constitution]]. Those rights enumerated in the U.S. Constitution are recognized as "fundamental" by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]]. According to the Supreme Court, enumerated rights that are incorporated are so fundamental that any law restricting such a right must both serve a compelling state purpose and be [[narrowly tailored]] to that [[compelling purpose]].

The original interpretation of the [[United States Bill of Rights]] was that only the Federal Government was bound by it. In 1835, the U.S. Supreme Court in ''[[Barron v Baltimore]]'' unanimously ruled that the Bill of Rights did not apply to the states. During post-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]], the [[14th Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] was adopted in 1868 to rectify this condition, and to specifically apply the whole of the Constitution to all U.S. states. In 1873, the Supreme Court essentially nullified the key language of the 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Amendment that guaranteed all "[[Privileges and Immunities Clause|privileges and immunities]]" to all U.S. persons, in a series of cases called the [[Slaughter-House Cases|Slaughterhouse cases]]. This decision and others allowed post-emancipation racial discrimination to continue largely unabated.

Later Supreme Court justices found a way around these limitations without overturning the Slaughterhouse precedent: they created a concept called Selective Incorporation. Under this legal theory, the court used the remaining 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Amendment protections for equal protection and due process to [[Incorporation of the Bill of Rights|"incorporate" individual elements of the Bill of Rights against the states]]. "The test usually articulated for determining fundamentality under the Due Process Clause is that the putative right must be '[[Palko v. Connecticut#Court.27s Decision|implicit in the concept of ordered liberty]]', or '[[Moore v. East Cleveland|deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition.]]'" [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14074967920400304312&amp;q=lutz+york&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,48 Compare page 267 Lutz v. City of York, Pa., 899 F. 2d 255 - United States Court of Appeals, 3rd Circuit, 1990].

This set in motion a continuous process under which each individual right under the Bill of Rights was incorporated, one by one. That process has extended more than half a century, with the free speech clause of the [[First Amendment]] first incorporated in 1925 in [[Gitlow v New York]]. The most recent amendment completely incorporated as fundamental was the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] right to possess and [[bear arms]] for personal self-defense, in [[McDonald v Chicago]], handed down in 2010.

Not all clauses of all amendments have been incorporated. For example, states are not required to obey the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]]'s requirement of indictment by [[grand jury]]. Many states choose to use [[preliminary hearing]]s instead of grand juries. It is possible that future cases may incorporate additional clauses of the Bill of Rights against the states.

The Bill of Rights lists specifically enumerated rights. The Supreme Court has extended fundamental rights by recognizing several fundamental rights not specifically enumerated in the Constitution, including but not limited to:
* The right to interstate travel
* The right to parent one's children&lt;ref&gt;''[[Troxel v. Granville]]''&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[right to privacy]]&lt;ref&gt;see [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=right+to+privacy&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,10&amp;case=12998230422916570030&amp;scilh=0 ''Union Pacific R. Co. v. Botsford''], 141 U.S. 250 (1891)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The right to marriage&lt;ref&gt;''[[Loving v. Virginia]]'' &amp; ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]''&lt;/ref&gt;
* The right of self-defense  
Any restrictions a government statute or policy places on these rights are evaluated with [[strict scrutiny]].  If a right is denied to everyone, it is an issue of [[substantive due process]]. If a right is denied to some individuals but not others, it is also an issue of [[equal protection]]. However, any action that abridges a right deemed fundamental, when also violating equal protection, is still held to the more exacting standard of strict scrutiny, instead of the less demanding rational basis test.

During the [[Lochner era]], the right to [[freedom of contract]] was considered fundamental, and thus restrictions on that right were subject to [[strict scrutiny]].  Following the 1937 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision in ''[[West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish]]'', though, the right to contract became considerably less important in the context of [[substantive due process]] and restrictions on it were evaluated under the [[rational basis]] standard.

'''Guaranteed Irish''' is an Irish [[nonprofit organisation|nonprofit business membership organisation]] representing indigenous and international businesses operating in Ireland. The Guaranteed Irish symbol is awarded to companies which create "quality" jobs, contribute to local communities and are "committed to Irish provenance". 

The members of Guaranteed Irish span all sectors including pharmaceutical; healthcare; technology; construction; energy; professional services; tourism; food and drink; art and design; retail; and more.

According to research published in February 2018, member companies of Guaranteed Irish directly employed 49,873 people in Ireland and generated a turnover of €11bn in Ireland in 2017. Globally, these companies generated a turnover of €25.84bn in 2017, with 46% of members exporting, primarily to the UK, US and mainland Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.guaranteedirish.ie/news/guaranteed-irish-month-launched-at-irish-stock-exchange/|title='Guaranteed Irish Month' launched at ISE {{!}} Guaranteed Irish|date=2018-02-07|work=Guaranteed Irish|access-date=2018-05-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/guaranteed-irish-companies-generated-11bn-in-revenues-last-year-1.3383358|title=‘Guaranteed Irish’ companies generated €11bn in revenues last year|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2018-05-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over four decades, the Guaranteed Irish symbol has become one of the most recognised symbols in the country.{{cn|date=June 2018}} Member companies can use the Guaranteed Irish symbol, a stylised overlay of the letters "g" and "i", on packaging and marketing materials for products and services certified by the organisation as having Irish origin or where at least 50% added value takes place in Ireland.

Through the use of the Guaranteed Irish symbol, in addition to PR and marketing campaigns, networking events, business seminars, and lobbying activities, Guaranteed Irish assists its members to expand at home and abroad, contributing to Ireland’s reputation for quality goods and services, and showcasing Ireland as best-in-class for business.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

The original Guaranteed Irish campaign was developed from December 1974 by the [[Irish Goods Council]], originally the Working Group on the Promotion and Sale of Irish Goods within the National Development Association, which was incorporated separately in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://opac.oireachtas.ie/AWData/Library3/Library2/DL018443.pdf#page=12|title=Ninth Annual Report to December 31st 1975|last=National Development Association (Forbairt)|first=|year=1976|series=Official publications|volume=Prl.5990|location=Dublin|pages=12–13|chapter=The Working Group|format=PDF|accessdate=9 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council's first director, [[Vivian Murray]], was instrumental in the campaign.&lt;ref name="it1224242845920"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/obituaries/2009/0314/1224242845920.html|title=Goods Council chief executive who created Buy Irish scheme|last=|first=|date=14 March 2009|work=[[Irish Times]]|accessdate=5 April 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rte"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0306/murrayv-business.html|title=Businessman Vivian Murray dies at 76|last=|first=|date=6 March 2009|work=[[RTÉ]]|accessdate=4 April 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Spending on the campaign increased from £90,376 in 1976 to £361,491 in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://opac.oireachtas.ie/AWData/Library3/Library2/DL022834.pdf#page=12|title=Annual Report 1977|author=Irish Goods Council|date=15 December 1978|publisher=Department of Industry and Commerce|series=Official publications|volume=Prl.7596|chapter=Schedule to the Accounts|accessdate=9 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://opac.oireachtas.ie/AWData/Library3/Library2/DL040379.pdf#page=10|title=Annual Report 1982|author=Irish Goods Council|date=21 December 1983|publisher=Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy|series=Official publications|volume=Pl.2040.|chapter=INCOME AND EXPENDITURE ACCOUNT For year ending 31/12/1982|accessdate=9 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/DebatesWebPack.nsf/takes/seanad1978070600005#N182|title=Green Paper: Development for Full Employment: Motion (Resumed).|year=1983|work=Seanad Éireann debates|accessdate=8 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, 1,000 companies were participating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://debates.oireachtas.ie/seanad/1980/12/10/00009.asp#N27|title=Sale of Irish Goods: Motion.|date=10 December 1980|work=Seanad Éireann debates|accessdate=8 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, the [[European Court of Justice]] ruled that, since the Irish Goods Council received state funding, its Guaranteed Irish campaign contravened the [[Treaty of Rome]]'s rules against [[protectionism]].&lt;ref name="eurlex"&gt;{{cite journal|year=1982|title=Case 249/81 Commission of the European Communities v Ireland.

In 2017, led by a new CEO, Brid O’Connell, and a new Board of Directors and team, the organisation rebranded and repositioned by opening up membership to international companies operating in Ireland. Guaranteed Irish was relaunched by the [[Taoiseach]], [[Enda Kenny]], in March 2017, using the original logo from the campaign’s inception. 

In February, the inaugural Guaranteed Irish Month, to take place each March, was unveiled at the [[Irish Stock Exchange]] by [[Ciarán Cannon|Ciaran Cannon]], T.D., Minister of State at the [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Ireland)|Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]] with special responsibility for the Diaspora and International Development, and Deirdre Somers, CEO of the Irish Stock Exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2018/0207/938926-march-designated-guaranteed-irish-month/|title=March designated 'Guaranteed Irish month'|date=2018-02-07|work=RTE.ie|access-date=2018-05-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a non-profit organisation, Guaranteed Irish is entirely funded through membership fees which is used to actively promote Guaranteed Irish businesses through online and offline PR and marketing activities&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.guaranteedirish.ie/who-we-are/|title=Who We Are {{!}} Guaranteed Irish|date=2017-08-01|work=Guaranteed Irish|access-date=2018-05-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The organisation currently has 300 members with plans to increase the number of member companies to 500 by the end of 2018. In April 2018, Guaranteed Irish launched a new website.

Guaranteed Irish is the national symbol for provenance and trust.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

== History ==

===1970s===
Houlihan Lokey was founded in Los Angeles in 1972 as a provider of general business advisory services to privately held companies. The 1974 passage of the [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act]] launched the firm’s [[Valuation (finance)|valuation]] business by creating demand for independent valuations of private businesses, particularly those that had formed [[employee stock ownership program]]s.

===1980s===
In 1986, Kenneth Friedman founded and became President of Houlihan Lokey’s investment banking broker dealer to provide M&amp;A advisory services and to raise debt and equity financing. Friedman formed the investment bank to provide Wall Street level expertise to the expanding investment banking demands of Houlihan Lokey’s clients and other middle market companies. By 1987, many of the highly leveraged transactions completed earlier in the decade were starting to exhibit signs of financial distress. Accordingly, a market was developing for financial restructuring advisory services. To position itself to serve this burgeoning market, the investment banking broker-dealer purchased Cheviot Capital Corporation in 1987 and, led by Jeff Werbalowsky and Irwin Gold, began assembling what would become an active, dominant, worldwide financial restructuring group.

With the surge of mergers, acquisitions, and leveraged buyouts, Wall Street’s large investment banking firms began calling on Houlihan Lokey for independent valuation expertise in fairness, solvency, and employee stock ownership plan ([[Employee stock ownership plan|ESOP]]) opinions. The firm advised on transactions valued at more than $100&amp;nbsp;billion during this period. The firm also started to offer estate planning valuation services. In addition, the firm opened several offices in the 1980s in [[New York City]], [[San Francisco]], and [[Chicago]].

===1990s===
Houlihan Lokey opened eight offices across the U.S. in the 1980s and 1990s as it expanded. In 1995, to grow its information services division, Houlihan Lokey acquired Mergerstat, a publishing company with a 30-year history in analytical M&amp;A research, from Merrill Lynch.

===2000s===
In 2001, Houlihan Lokey launched its first non-U.S. office by expanding into [[London]]. It also expanded its industry group platform and [[private equity]] coverage program in keeping with investment banking trends.

In 2002, Houlihan Lokey advised the official creditors committees in three large bankruptcies: WorldCom, Enron, and Conseco.

In 2005, the firm opened a [[Paris]] office.

In 2006, the firm opened a Frankfurt office. Also in 2006, Houlihan Lokey agreed to merge with [[ORIX]] USA, the U.S. corporate lending operations of ORIX Corp. of Japan, to address the growing international demand for middle-market investment banking services.

In 2007, Houlihan Lokey expanded into Asia, opening offices in Hong Kong and Tokyo. Within the next three years, the firm also opened an office in [[Beijing]].

In 2008, Houlihan Lokey advised the creditors of Lehman Brothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/lehman-fees/judge-in-lehman-bankruptcy-backs-158-mln-in-professional-fees-idUSL1E8ME02A20121114|title=Judge in Lehman bankruptcy backs $158 mln in professional fees|date=November 14, 2012|publisher=|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010s===
In 2010, Houlihan Lokey bought a sizable minority stake in Avista Advisory Group, a then decade-old advisory group. This gave the firm offices in both Mumbai and Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hl.com/us/press/news/2380.aspx|title=Houlihan Unveils Indian Partnership|website=www.hl.com|accessdate=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Houlihan Lokey expanded its Financial Institutions Group through the acquisition of Milestone Advisors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hl.com/press/Milestone.aspx|title=HOULIHAN LOKEY SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDS FINANCIAL SERVICES COVERAGE WITH ACQUISITION OF MILESTONE ADVISORS, LLC|website=www.hl.com|accessdate=September 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm also launched the Illiquid Financial Assets practice to advise on the sales of assets such as stakes in loan pools, life settlements, minority positions, pharmaceutical royalties, and operating leases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-09-23/houlihan-lokey-to-double-team-focused-on-illiquid-sales|title=Houlihan Lokey to Double Team Focused on Illiquid Sales|last=Willmer|first=Sabrina|website=Bloomberg.com|accessdate=September 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hungarian Constitution of 1949''' was adopted on 20 August 1949{{ref label|A|a|none}} and heavily amended on 23 October 1989.{{ref label|B|b|none}} The document was Hungary's first permanent written constitution, and until its replacement in 2011, the country was the only former [[Eastern Bloc]] nation that did not adopt an entirely new constitution after the [[Revolutions of 1989|fall of Communism]]. The [[Constitution of Hungary]], adopted in 2011, declares the 1949 constitution to be invalid.

==History==

===Adoption and amendments===

Following the end of [[World War II]] and after the country had been occupied by the [[Soviet Union]],&lt;ref&gt;Borhi, p.77-8&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 1945|democratic elections]] were held under Statute VIII of 1945. Then, Statute I of 1946, a provisional constitutional statute (or "little constitution") passed on 31 January, formally ended the thousand-year monarchy and introduced a republican form of government.&lt;ref name="Korosenyi145"&gt;Körösényi, p.145&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 1949, after the [[Hungarian Working People's Party]] had assumed undisputed control of the country, the Communist-controlled parliament adopted a constitution as Act XX of 1949. The date of its adoption, 20 August, made a new national holiday that coincided with the traditional holiday of the feast of Saint Stephen. The document has been described as "a slavish imitation of the Soviet-type constitutions, with some variations resulting from the historical and political differences between the Soviet Union and Hungary". (Specifically, it was modelled on the "Stalin" [[1936 Soviet Constitution]].) Now, Hungary became a people's republic, which was "the state of the workers and working peasants".&lt;ref&gt;Ludwikowski, p.31&lt;/ref&gt; A Presidential Council elected by parliament was to be head of state, but real power rested with the Working People's Party, its leading role enshrined in the document. The National Assembly met for some ten days each year, with most rules taking the form of presidential and ministerial decrees. A variety of fundamental rights was guaranteed, but only for the working people (or in accordance with their interests).&lt;ref name="h7"/&gt; Moreover, no means existed of ensuring these rights' mandatory nature or of rendering them enforceable.&lt;ref&gt;Somody, p.211&lt;/ref&gt; Church and state were separated.&lt;ref name="h7"&gt;Harmathy, p.7&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1989, the charter's basic features remained in effect, although the regime added important amendments in 1950, 1953, 1954, 1972, and 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-5878.html "The Constitution of 1949"], Library of Congress Country Studies&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, Act I of 26 April 1972, comprehensively redrafted the constitution, proclaiming Hungary a socialist state. While the social, economic and political order remained the same, fundamental rights were now guaranteed for all citizens (but certain rights, like freedom of speech, press or assembly, still had to conform with the interests of socialism and the people). The preamble still paid tribute to the Soviet "liberators" but took a longer historical perspective, referring to the "millennium" of the people's struggle. The role of mass movements and trade unions (in addition to the party) in the building of socialism was acknowledged, the equal ranking of state and cooperative ownership asserted, and private producers recognised, so long as they did not "violate collective interests".&lt;ref&gt;Rakowska-Harmstone, p.100&lt;/ref&gt; As a moderate liberalisation continued to set in during the ensuing years, Act II of 1983 set up a Constitutional Council, intending to watch over the constitutionality of legal rules by giving internal review; and Act X of 1987 limited the Presidential Council's authority to issue law-decrees. Reforms were accelerated in 1989, with Act I envisaging the establishment of a [[Constitutional Court of Hungary|Constitutional Court]] and lifting political restrictions on the exercise of all fundamental rights, and Act VIII introducing the [[motion of no confidence]] vis-à-vis the Council of Ministers and its members.&lt;ref&gt;Harmathy, p.7-8&lt;/ref&gt;

===1989 reforms===

From 1988 on, as the economic situation deteriorated and opposition groups emerged, the idea of preparing a new constitution emerged. Reform Communists and the opposition took account of this development at the [[Hungarian Round Table Talks]] in mid-1989, desiring a document that would establish a multiparty system, parliamentary democracy and a social market economy. However, time constraints did not allow a completely new constitution to be written. On 18 October, the National Assembly approved a comprehensive amendment package which allowed the 1949 Constitution to prevail until a new constitution was framed. The reform (Act XXXI of 1989), changed nearly 100 provisions of the 1949 Constitution, and pruned out its Communist character. It was the first thoroughgoing constitutional transformation in the Soviet bloc. It was adopted like a normal constitutional amendment, and was passed by a margin of 333-5 (with eight abstentions)–well above the required two-thirds majority. The amended constitution went into effect on 23 October, the anniversary of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/19/world/hungary-purges-stalinism-from-its-constitution.html|title=Hungary Purges Stalinism From Its Constitution|publisher=[[Reuters]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 19, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harmathy89"&gt;Harmathy, p.8-9&lt;/ref&gt; 

The 1989 reform established Hungary as an independent, democratic, constitutional republic that was both civil democratic and democratic socialist. The economy was to be a [[Social market economy|social market]] one, with planning employed and public and private property enjoying equal protection. The people were sovereign, with parties functioning freely. Among the new features introduced were a weak [[List of heads of state of Hungary|presidency]] and strong [[National Assembly of Hungary|parliament]] with oversight powers, checks and balances, limitations on the authority of the prime minister, provisions for referendums, and an independent judiciary. Outside the preamble, all references to "[[socialism]]" were carefully deleted. The [[Constitutional Court of Hungary|Constitutional Court]], whose members are elected by two-thirds of parliament, can annul laws declared unconstitutional, and has broad jurisdiction. The parliamentary term was reduced from five to four years. Human rights were emphasized, with reference to the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] and the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]].&lt;ref name="Harmathy89"/&gt; The changes were all-encompassing: it was said, with some exaggeration, that the only provision that remained untouched named Budapest as the capital.&lt;ref name="Mullerson83"&gt;Mullerson, p.83&lt;/ref&gt; However, the form of the state was not changed; it was still described as a parliamentary democracy with parliament as "a supreme organ of state power and popular representation" that retained the power to elect the highest executive and judicial officers of the state.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwikowski, p.180-81&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andrew Arato]], an expert on constitutions in new democracies, places the 1989 text under his "post-sovereign" constitution making paradigm, so called because no single body with full powers is tasked with drafting a new constitution. Rather, the model involves a body such as a round table of major political forces drafting an interim constitution, followed by a freely elected one composing a final draft. Aside from Poland and Hungary, this method was used several years later to create the [[Constitution of South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arato | first1 = Andrew | title = Redeeming the Still Redeemable: Post Sovereign Constitution Making | journal = International Journal of Politics, Culture, and Society | year = 2009 | volume = 22 | issue = 4 | pages = 427–43 | doi = 10.1007/s10767-009-9070-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Hungary, the preamble of the 1989 modification referred to its temporary character,&lt;ref&gt;Ludwikowski, p.110&lt;/ref&gt; a fact recalled when it was finally replaced by an entirely new constitution over two decades later.&lt;ref&gt;Zoltán Csipke, [http://www.politics.hu/20110420/hungarys-punditocracy-weighs-in-on-new-constitution "Hungary's punditocracy weighs in on new constitution"], politics.hu, 20 April 2011; accessed April 28, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developments from 1990 to 2010===

After 1989, the constitution was amended multiple times. The first changes came in 1990 when, after [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 1990|free elections]] brought the opposition to power, references to democratic socialism and the planned economy were dropped. (When these had been included half a year earlier, the Communists were thought much more popular than these elections showed them to be).&lt;ref&gt;Harmathy, p.9&lt;/ref&gt; Also that year, a pact between the [[Hungarian Democratic Forum]] (MDF), who had won the elections, and the [[Alliance of Free Democrats]] (SZDSZ), who came in second, resulted in additional changes. The President was to be elected by the Parliament rather than directly; the [[constructive vote of no confidence]] was introduced; and areas in which a two-thirds majority was required to adopt a law were reduced, making governing easier. In exchange for agreeing to this set of MDF proposals, [[Árpád Göncz]] of the SZDSZ was elected President.&lt;ref&gt;{{hu icon}} [http://www.hirextra.hu/2010/04/28/nagyito-alatt-az-mdf-szdsz-paktum/ "Nagyító alatt: az MDF-SZDSZ paktum" ("In Focus: MDF-SZDSZ Pact")], HírExtra, 28 April 2011; accessed June 23, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, the list of issues to be decided by parliament with a ⅔ majority was shortened, and the Constitutional Court was shrunk from 15 to 11 judges.&lt;ref name="Mullerson83"/&gt; In 1995, when the possibility of completing the democratic transition via a new constitution arose, an amendment was adopted requiring four-fifths of Parliament to agree to the drafting rules. This enhanced supermajority provision was meant to ensure that the replacement constitution would enjoy broad acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;Miklós Bánkuti, Gábor Halmai and Kim Lane Scheppele, "From Separation of Powers to a Government without Checks: Hungary's Old and New Constitutions", in Tóth, p.249&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 an amendment streamlined the judicial system, while later modifications allowed Hungary to join the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unizar.es/euroconstitucion/Treaties/Treaty_Const_Rat_Hungary.htm The Ratification Process in Hungary]&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2010, even as a new constitution was being prepared, an amendment was passed restricting the powers of the Constitutional Court on budget-related laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politics.hu/20101111/parliament-approves-amendment-on-constitutional-changes "Parliament approves amendment on constitutional changes"], politics.hu, 11 November 2010; accessed April 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to its replacement, the document included a preamble and was divided into fifteen chapters with 79 articles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/hu00000_.html Text of the Constitution]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1990s, Prime Minister [[Gyula Horn]] unsuccessfully tried to enact a new constitution. In 2006, during [[Ferenc Gyurcsány]]'s premiership, a new charter was drafted for internal use which mentioned the [[Holy Crown of Hungary]] and placed the [[Chief Prosecutor of Hungary]] under government control; its contents were not made public until the 2011 debate on a new constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{hu icon}} [http://www.mno.hu/portal/775533 "Magyarázkodásra kényszerül Gyurcsány" ("Gyurcsány Is Forced to Explain")], ''Magyar Nemzet'', 4 April 2011; accessed April 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Constitution of Hungary|a new constitution]] was ultimately adopted that year, it included the provision that Hungarians "do not recognize the communist constitution of 1949, since it was the basis for tyrannical rule". Thus, the 1949 document, including the changes made in 1989 and afterward, was explicitly rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver W. Lembcke and Christian Boulanger, "Between Revolution and Constitution: The Roles of the Hungarian Constitutional Court", in Tóth, p.285&lt;/ref&gt;

At first, as the only Communist-era constitution retained in Eastern Europe,&lt;ref&gt;Szikinger, p.406&lt;/ref&gt; Hungary's charter and by extension its political system did not command a great deal of respect. The fact that it was preserved reflected a tradition of gradualism in Hungarian constitutional history; there was no constitutional assembly or referendum to confer additional legitimacy on the new system.&lt;ref name="Korosenyi145"/&gt; And in particular, the enthusiastic Constitutional Court seemed more intent on applying German case law than the Hungarian constitution. However, it gained stature from the early 1990s for three reasons. First, the process of gradual amendments allowed for experimentation that remedied some of its weaknesses. Second, the 1989 document became stable in 1997 when the government abandoned plans for drafting a new constitution. Finally, the Court never disregarded the constitution altogether, remaining acutely aware of its text.&lt;ref&gt;Dupré, p.173-4&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Land recycling''' is the reuse of abandoned, vacant, or underused properties for [[redevelopment]] or repurposing.

Land recycling aims to ensure the reuse of [[developed land]] as part of: new developments; [[decontamination|cleaning up]] contaminated properties; reuse and/or making use of used land surrounded by development or nearby infrastructure. End-uses from land recycling may include: mixed-use, residential, commercial, or industrial developments; and/or [[Public space|public open space]] such as [[urban open space]] use by [[urban park]]s, [[community garden]]s; or larger [[open space reserve]]s such as [[regional park]]s.

Since many abandoned and underutilized properties lie within economically distressed and disadvantaged communities, land recycling often benefits and stimulates re-investment in historically under-served areas. The real or perceived presence of [[xenobiotic]] [[hazardous substance]]s from historical previous uses or ''in situ'' [[land pollution]], causing [[soil contamination]] and [[groundwater pollution]], may complicate the redevelopment of such properties. Such environmentally distressed properties, with site cleanup and mitigation considerations, are commonly referred to as [[brownfield]]s.

==Synonyms==
Other commonly used terms can relate to or serve as synonyms of land recycling:

* '''[[Infill|Infill development]]''': development that takes place within existing communities, making maximum use of the existing [[infrastructure]] instead of building on previously undeveloped land; 
* '''[[Sustainable development]]''': Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs; and
* '''[[Brownfield land|Brownfield development]]''': development of [[real property]] for which its reuse may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a [[dangerous goods|hazardous substance]], pollutant or contaminant.

==Benefits==

The US Government [[Accountability Office]] estimates that there are over 450,000 brownfields and almost {{convert|15|e6acre|km2}} of potentially contaminated properties across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Brownfield Redevelopment: Stakeholders Report That EPA's Program Helps to Redevelop Sites, but Additional Measures Could Complement Agency Efforts
GAO-05-94; December 2, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; These sites sit idle and neglected, serving as desolate eyesores within their communities. By putting these barren infill sites to use, land recycling revitalizes communities, promotes [[sustainable development]], and preserves precious [[land resource|resources]]. The social, economic, environmental, and other benefits of land recycling include:

* Social and economic [[revitalization]]
* Sustainability
* An alternative to [[urban sprawl|sprawl]]
* Direction of [[economic development|development]] to urban cores
* Addressing [[climate change]]{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Social and economic revitalization===

Land recycling helps clean up and revitalize inner cities by returning abandoned, idle, or underused sites to productive use, bolstering [[community spirit]], creating jobs and boosting local tax-revenues.

The re-use of land revitalizes communities and renews economic activity, particularly in under-served urban areas. Abandoned, idled, and vacant properties often lie in former industrial and commercial areas, typically in urban and historically disadvantaged areas. These sites can be community eyesores, negatively impacting social and economic development, and often human and [[environmental health]]. The failure to redevelop brownfields in particular translates into potentially more exposure to toxics and the loss of economic and housing benefits that can come from appropriate redevelopment.

By putting these properties to new and productive use, land recycling encourages growth of [[business]]es and services in such areas, helping to break up concentrations of [[poverty]], creating jobs, and stimulating additional private investment and local tax-revenue. An abandoned, well-situated, factory site can be cleaned up and redeveloped into a much-needed mixed-use development with a grocery store, senior housing, and access to public transportation. The addition of neighborhood-serving retail, affordable housing, or a clean public park in a disadvantaged community can boost local spirit and improve overall quality of life.

===Sustainability===
[[Sustainability]] involves meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.

Land recycling expresses an inherently sustainable idea, based on the same common-sense as recycling an aluminum can. Like other natural resources, land represents a shared investment that should be reused and recycled, rather than [[land consumption|consumed]] and abandoned after use. [[Recycling paper]] saves trees, reusing land saves land.

By encouraging the recycling rather than the consumption of land, land recycling promotes [[smart growth]] and responsible, sustainable patterns of development. A 2001 study by George Washington University shows that for every acre of brownfield redeveloped, {{convert|4.5|acre|m2}} of undeveloped land is conserved.
[http://www.gwu.edu/~eem/Brownfields/project_report/chapters-html.htm#chapter5 Public Policies and Private Decisions Affecting the Redevelopment of Brownfields: An Analysis of Critical Factors, Relative Weights and Areal Differentials]. As most brownfields and other abandoned sites are typically situated in urban areas, they tap into existing nearby infrastructure, limiting the need to build new roads, gridlines, and amenities, thereby reducing further land consumption. Each infill development prevents sprawl into open space, forests and agricultural land, preserving acres of undeveloped land.

===An alternative to sprawl===
Land recycling increases density in urban areas, by reducing [[urban sprawl]] and unplanned, low-density, [[automobile]]-dependent developments.

Sprawl development scatters housing, public transit, jobs and other amenities farther apart, demanding more frequent use of cars for travel. The increase in vehicle-miles traveled (VMTs) produces a range of health and environmental problems, including air pollution and increased greenhouse gas emissions, and increased incidence of traffic jams and asthma. This results in a lower quality of life for residents, ever-increasing commute times, and the health implications of smog.

By moving new jobs, economic opportunities and community amenities farther from established populations, sprawl development can cripple once-thriving cities. This trend takes a toll on the socio-economic health of urban communities as growth retreats from the urban center.

Rather than take advantage of existing infrastructure such as roads, public transit, and public works, building sprawl projects abandons these resources and demands further consumption of land and resources.

Land recycling offers an intelligent alternative to sprawl development. It reuses vital infrastructure and public resources and creates compact, full-service neighborhoods that reduce [[vehicle use]] and [[carbon dependence]]. Rebuilding in urban neighborhoods generates reinvestment in vibrant economic and cultural centers, rather than drawing away much-needed resources. Compact, urban development through land recycling is essential to sustainable development and is key to managing rapid population growth across the United States and beyond. As daily commute times decrease, the general quality of life improves as residents have more time to enjoy the world around them.

===Directing development to urban cores===
Redirecting population growth and growth of businesses to already urbanized areas is integral to fostering sustainable communities.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Applying sustainable principles to land use and growth management requires that growth be redirected from scattered fringe areas back to our urban cores, where people, services and infrastructure already exist. Building up our urban areas positively increases population density, providing the critical mass to support local services from coffee shops to grocery stores, public transit to libraries and symphony halls. Land recycling provides opportunities for urban renewal and to build truly livable communities: efficient, compact, vibrant urban neighborhoods integrated with public transit systems, which offer a mix of uses as well as affordable housing.

===Addressing climate change===
Land recycling effectively curbs [[greenhouse gas|greenhouse-gas]] emissions by encouraging smart, compact growth that reduces [[vehicle dependence]]. Redevelopment within an urban core reduces commuting distances and therefore average vehicle miles traveled (VMTs) by creating residential, office, and other amenities within close proximity. Since transportation alone accounts for a third of greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted in the United States, land recycling offers a key tool in any fight against climate change.  A recent Urban Land Institute study found that compact urban developments reduce the number of vehicle miles traveled (VMTs) by 20 to 40 percent &lt;ref&gt;Urban Land Institute.  Growing Cooler: The Evidence of Urban Development and Climate Change.  Available at  {{cite web|url=http://www.smartgrowthamerica.org/gcindex.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224212241/http://smartgrowthamerica.org/gcindex.html |archivedate=2010-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; because users are closer to amenities and can more easily rely on public transportation. Smart urban planning is therefore crucial to maximizing energy savings and overall reduction of greenhouse gases.

{{As of | 2009}} the green movement has started to emphasize the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) Green Building Rating System, a certification system that rewards the design, construction and operation of high-performance green buildings. LEED certification signifies incorporation of smart building design and technology to reduce energy use and minimize waste. However, even if a building is energy-efficient, the energy required to travel to and from a LEED certified site may well exceed the energy saved through energy-efficient features. LEED certified buildings and other developments best benefit climate change when they reuse infill sites and access existing resources.

==Challenges==
While land recycling has great economic and environmental benefits, without the right tools, skills, and knowledge, reusing land can produce certain challenges.  Obstacles to redevelopment may include lack of funding and increased scrutiny. These can particularly impede projects on brownfields, which carry the stigma of contamination. Because of these concerns, the perceived ease of developing on open land, or [[greenfield land|greenfields]], remains alluring to many. Factors that hinder land recycling include:

* market factors
* environmental-liability risks
* uncertainty and cost
* complicated/confusing regulatory requirements
* difficulty in obtaining project financing
* the lure of greenfields

===Market factors===
As the saying goes, in [[real estate]] only three things matter: location, location, location. Because idled and underused infill sites are often located in distressed urban areas concerns arise about crime, safety, and access to quality education and services. These and other market factors frequently pull development to open land near traditionally desirable communities and away from urban infill sites.

====Greenfields competition====
Brownfields and infill sites must compete with attractive, undeveloped suburban and rural land, also called [[greenfield land]]. When considering the real or perceived risks and costs of land recycling, a greenfield development may seem more economically sensible as the immediate costs are typically less than developing on an infill or brownfield site. However, it is important to consider the long-term economic gain of land recycling and the added social and environmental rewards of sustainable development.

===Brownfields===
As defined by the US Environmental Protection Agency, a [[brownfield]] site is “real property, the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant”. In other words, brownfield sites comprise abandoned, idled, or underused industrial and commercial facilities where expansion or redevelopment is complicated by real or perceived environmental contamination.

====Uncertainty and costs====
Assessing whether or not a site is contaminated can be a costly process that deters land reuse. Potential purchasers are often unwilling or unable to risk an investment in a site assessment for a property that may require cleanup they cannot afford. Even if a site has been purchased, concerns over cleanup costs may further stall redevelopment. Uncertainty over time, cost or a high price for cleanup leaves many brownfield sites in development limbo.

====Project financing====
Obtaining private front-end financing for brownfield cleanup can be a difficult process{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}. Since financing is more readably available for development on greenfields, infill and brownfield sites are often passed over.

===Environmental-liability risks===
Although recent changes in some country's federal laws provide some liability relief to new purchasers of contaminated properties, the law remains very complex and many state laws still have strict liability covering real property. Thus, in many cases, any current or past property owner can potentially be legally and financially liable regardless of who is responsible for contamination. This liability web continues to throw a chill on many brownfield projects even in the presence of regulatory reforms designed to encourage redevelopment. A common belief among many brownfield owners is that it is less risky and cheaper to abandon or “mothball” a facility than to conduct a site assessment that could trigger large cleanup costs and potential liability.

====Regulatory requirements====
The potentially complex process of successfully redeveloping an infill site, particularly a brownfield, can challenge land recycling interest and proposals.  Understanding and complying with federal, state, and local legal and regulatory requirements can be daunting for some property owners and developers. Guidance from legal specialists and environmental cleanup consultants is often needed to design, develop, and guide a project through the process of regulatory requirements and permitting approvals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2124">A '''latitat''' is a legal device, namely a [[writ]], that is "based upon the presumption that the person summoned was hiding", see [[William Blackstone|Blackstone]]. The word "latitat" is [[Latin]] for "he lurks".&lt;ref&gt;"[I]t derives its name from a supposition that the defendant lurks and lies hid, and cannot be found in the county of Middlesex (in which the said court is holden) to be taken there, but is gone into some other county, and therefore requiring the sheriff to apprehend him in such other county." Fitz. N. B. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[England]], the [[writ]] is essentially a summons out of the civil, and in those days [[common law]] only court [[King's Bench]]. It is now defunct but examples still exist from 1579 and 1791. One example from the 16th Century was a writ presented to the [[Star Chamber]], a powerful court operating outside the normal system of law. In that example, the Court of [[King's Bench]] had issued a writ of latitat directing the King's [[Sheriff]] to arrest the named person and present him before the court at a specified time and place. The matter had come before the [[Star Chamber]] because the arrest had been resisted and the [[Sheriff|Under-Sheriff]] (a [[The Crown|Crown]] official) assaulted and a writ of [[subpoena]] was now requested. The writ may have arisen in 1566 because at that time there was a "Bill for Latitat for Vexation out of the King's Bench" before [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] and there was another in 1802.

The current practice would be for the issue of a [[subpoena]]. If the person concerned failed to appear, the [[High Court of England and Wales]] has the power to issue a [[Bench Warrant]], i.e. a [[Warrant (law)|warrant]] for the [[arrest]] of the person concerned, who may then be subject to arrest under that aegis of [[the Tipstaff]] and presentation before the court for [[contempt of court]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11359">'''Leaseback,''' short for '''"sale-and-leaseback,"''' is a [[financial transaction]] in which one sells an asset and [[leases]] it back for the long term; therefore, one continues to be able to use the asset but no longer owns it. The transaction is generally done for fixed assets, notably [[real estate]], as well as for durable and capital goods such as airplanes and trains. The concept can also be applied by national governments to territorial assets; prior to the [[Falklands War]], the government of the United Kingdom proposed a leaseback arrangement whereby the [[Falklands Islands]] would be transferred to [[Argentina]], with a 99-year leaseback period,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3638438/Another-campaign-for-the-Falklands.html|title=Another campaign for the Falklands|first=By Sophie|last=Arie|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a similar arrangement, also for 99 years, had been in place prior to the [[Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|handover of Hong Kong]] to mainland China. Leaseback arrangements are usually employed because they confer financing, accounting or taxation benefits.

==Leaseback arrangements==
After purchasing an asset, the owner enters a long-term agreement by which the property is leased back to the seller at an agreed rate.  One reason for a leaseback is to transfer ownership to a [[holding company]] while keeping proper track of the ongoing worth and profitability of the asset.  Another reason is for the seller to raise money by offloading a valuable asset to a buyer who is presumably interested in making a long-term secured investment. Leaseback arrangements are common in the [[REIT]] industry.

===Possible solution to toxic banking assets===
According to Robert Peston, one-time Business Editor for the BBC, one option being considered for dealing with the [[subprime mortgage crisis]] is a sale-and-leaseback of [[toxic asset]]s.  Peston says "a sale-and-leaseback between the banks and the state has two supreme advantages: there's no need to value the poisonous assets; and losses on those stinky assets would be absorbed by the banks in manageable chunks over about 10 years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/robertpeston/2009/01/first_septic_bank_revisited.html |title=Peston's Picks: First Septic Bank (revisited) |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2013-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Real estate===
Leaseback arrangements are popular in France, the United States, United Kingdom, and throughout Australia and Asia, including, more recently, in India.

====France====
Leaseback of residential property has been popular in [[France]] for more than 30 years, and there are significant tax advantages. Under the scheme, the purchaser may use the property usually between 1 and 8 weeks per year (with a maximum of 6 months per year). The [[French government]] encourages the development of leaseback schemes in touristic areas to alleviate shortages in rental accommodation. The government rebates the local [[value-added tax|VAT]] (which is 19.6%), when the property is purchased off plan.

The scheme works by purchasing a freehold property. You become the legal owner. The property is then leased back to the developer or a management company. Under the leaseback scheme the government also refunds to you the VAT normally charged on a new build properties (currently 19.6%).

The owner is then guaranteed a rental income throughout the period of the lease. The net return to the owner varies between developments but is typically between 4% to 6%. This compares very favourably with a typical 20 year fixed rate mortgage of around 3.75%, and variable rate mortgages which are lower. It can be seen how the rental income can be used in respect of the mortgage payments. Loans of between 75% and 85% are available depending upon circumstances. The rental yield is also index linked annually to construction costs, which means the rental income currently increases by approximately 2.5%.

As in the UK there are tax allowances in respect of mortgage payments which can be offset against income. The lease typically lasts for between 9 and 11 years, after which the management company has the option to either renew, or the property can be sold, or rented out and held privately by the owner.

The purchaser/owner can also enjoy periods of usage free of charge through the year, depending upon the terms of the lease. These terms normally allows for between 4 and 6 weeks free usage each year. The management company is responsible for the maintenance of the property including the maintenance of furnishings which are often included in the purchase price. The developer is also responsible for insuring the building and its contents. It also pays for some of the property taxes and all the utility costs.

==== United Kingdom ====
In the United Kingdom, a form of leaseback known as [[sale and rent back]] was the subject of a 2014 [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]] case that found many such arrangements had been perpetrated fraudulently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Jones |first= Rupert  |date= 7 November 2014 |title= Sick and elderly face pre-Christmas eviction as court backs lenders |url= https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/nov/07/sick-elderly-pre-christmas-eviction-court-backs-lenders |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate= 9 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
A "sale/leaseback" or "sale and leaseback" is a transaction in which the owner of a property sells an [[asset]], typically [[real estate]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leaseback.asp |title=Leaseback |publisher=Investopedia.com |date=2013-06-28 |accessdate=2013-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then [[leases]] it back from the [[buyer]]. In this way the transaction functions as a [[loan]], with payments taking the form of [[renting|rent]]. Due to the lack of financing available in today’s market, many American businesses are increasingly turning to sale-and-leasebacks to provide quick [[capital (economics)|capital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://netleaseinsider.blogspot.com/search?q=leaseback|title=Net Lease Insider: Search results for leaseback|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, developers of master-planned communities will often sell the [[model home]] to a buyer before the community is sold out, leasing it back from the buyer for a period of up to two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Lew | last=Sichelman | coauthors= | title=Sale-Leaseback | date=October 15, 2010 | publisher= | url =http://www.privatecommunities.com/second-home-buying/sale-leaseback.htm | pages = | accessdate = 2011-11-07 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some arrangements, the current [[lessee]] will give the option to buy the asset back at the end of the lease. Typically, if the original owner were to buy back the asset, it would take place at the end of the [[tax year]], in case any party were to be [[audited]] by the [[IRS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calkain.com/read-more-irs.php?id=44 |title=Hipp, Jonathan W. "Technical Advice Memorandum No. 2003-46007 - Calkain Companies, Inc." CALKAIN COMPANIES, INC. - Your Source for Investment Real Estate. Web. 20 July 2010 |publisher=Calkain.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other countries====
The leaseback concept has spread to other European countries, including [[Spain]] and [[Switzerland]].  Typical property available are studios, apartments, and villas. They are situated near [[ski]] areas, [[beach resort]]s, or [[golf course]]s.

==Commercial real estate==
A sale-and-leaseback is typically a commercial [[real estate]] transaction in which one party, often a corporation, sells its [[corporate real estate]] assets to another party, such as an [[institutional investor]], or a real estate investment trust ([[REIT]]), and then leases the property back at a [[rental]] rate and lease term that is acceptable to the new [[investor]]/[[landlord]]. The lease term and rental rate are based on the new investor/landlord's [[financing]] costs, the lessee's [[credit rating]], and a market [[rate of return]], based on the initial cash investment by the new investor/landlord. 

The reasons and advantages for a [[seller]]/[[lessee]] are varied, but the most common are:

* Help [[finance]] expansion of the existing business, purchase new plant equipment, or [[invest]] in new business opportunities. A sale leaseback enables a corporation to access more capital than traditional financing methods. When the real estate is sold to an outside investor, the corporation receives 100% of the value of the property. Traditional financing is limited to a loan-to-value ratio or debt-coverage-ratio.
* Help pay down [[debt]] and improve the company's [[balance sheet]].
* Help reduce the seller/lessee's business income tax [[legal liability|liability]] caused by the [[Capital appreciation|appreciation]] in value (land only) of its corporate real estate [[assets]]. In addition, the seller/lessee as a [[leasehold estate|tenant]] can deduct all [[renting|rent]] payments as a legitimate business [[expense]] on its annual tax returns.
* Helps limit risks associated with owning real estate such as cyclical market variations.&lt;ref name="Sale Leaseback"&gt;[http://www.cookcre.com/sale-leaseback-advisory Sale Leaseback], CookCRE | Sale Leaseback Advisory&lt;/ref&gt;

The advantages for an [[investor]]/[[landlord]] are:

* Fair return on the [[investment]] in the form of [[renting|rent]] during the [[lease]] term, and ownership of a depreciable [[asset]] already occupied by a reliable [[leasehold estate|tenant]].
* Long-term, fully leased [[asset]] with a guaranteed [[income]] stream.
* For [[income tax|income-tax]] purposes, the investor/landlord can take an expense deduction for an [[investment]] in a [[depreciation|depreciable]] property to allow for the recovery of the cost of the investment.
* Ability to invest in real estate with a tenant who is already familiar with the property.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

==Aviation==
Leaseback is also commonly used in [[general aviation]], with buyers using the scheme to let flight schools and other [[fixed base operator|FBO]]s use their aircraft.

Leaseback is very often used in commercial aviation to essentially take back the cash invested in assets. [[Airlines]], for example, sell [[aircraft]] and engines to lessors, banks or other financial institutions who, in turn, lease the assets back to them. Tax deductions can also be realized by the airline since the asset is no longer owned but leased. Due to the high price of aircraft and engines, especially new, the cash from such a leaseback is used by airlines to improve their financial performance.

==Industrial equipment==
The leaseback concept has also spread to [[industry]], mostly for industrial equipment. A company sells some of its equipment to a [[Lease|lessor]], such as a [[bank]] or another financial institution, which leases the equipment back to the company. Thus the company is no longer the owner of the equipment but keeps the use of it. This commercial transaction allows two companies to have at their immediate disposal the cash to make [[investments]] in new business opportunities.

{{canon law}}
'''Licentiate of Canon Law''' ({{lang-la|'''Juris Canonici Licentiatus'''}}; '''JCL''') is the title of an advanced [[graduate degree]] with canonical effects in the [[Roman Catholic Church]] offered by pontifical universities and ecclesiastical faculties of [[canon law]]. [[Licentiate (degree)|Licentiate]] is the title of a person who holds an academic degree called a license.

==Academic program==
[[Licentiate (degree)|Licentiate]] programs in canon law involve a study of the whole corpus of [[canon law (Roman Catholic Church)|canon law]] in the Roman Catholic Church, understood in terms of its theological, philosophical, and historical background, and the method and practice of scholarly scientific research.  Consequently, experts in canon law have a comprehensive understanding of the nature of law specifically in the life of the church. In order for a candidate to obtain the licentiate of canon law, he or she must complete a six-semester, that is, three year, program of canonical studies, pass a comprehensive oral examination before a jury of faculty members, and write a thesis on a particular theme that demonstrates the student's ability to function professionally in the field.

===Prerequisites for Second Cycle===
The usual prerequisites for a license in canon law are that a candidate must have the [[bachelor of sacred theology]] degree ([[Bachelor of Sacred Theology|S.T.B.]]), master of divinity degree ([[M.Div.]]), master of arts ([[Master of Arts|M.A.]]) degree in [[Roman Catholic theology]], or juris doctor ([[Juris Doctor|J.D.]]) degree and a bachelor's degree in canon law (J.C.B.) or its relative equivalent.

==Uses of the degree in the Catholic Church==
The license in canon law is required for a person to teach canon law in a [[pontifical university]] or [[Catholic seminary]]. The license is also the prerequisite to the doctorate ([[J.C.D.]]) in the same field.  Furthermore, the degree is a prerequisite for several officers of Catholic [[ecclesiastical court]]s: judges (including the [[judicial vicar]]), the [[Promoter of Justice]], and the [[Defender of the Bond]] all must at least possess this degree.

==Pontifical faculties==

Notable faculties which offer the license in canon law include:  the [[Pontifical Lateran University]] (Lateranum, also known as "The Pope's University"), the [[Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas (Angelicum)]]; the [[Pontifical Gregorian University]] (Gregorianum), the [[Pontifical University of the Holy Cross]] (Santa Croce), the [[Pontifical Urban University]] (Urbanianum), the [[University of Navarra]] in [[Pamplona]], [[The Catholic University of America]], [[Saint Paul University]] in Canada, the [[Pontifical and Royal University of Santo Tomas]] in [[Manila, Philippines]], the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]] in Belgium, the [[Institut Catholique de Paris]], the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]], the [[Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster]] in Germany and the Faculty of Canon Law "S. Pio X" in Venice of [[Studium Generale Marcianum]].

==Formation and objectives==
The '''Liikanen Group''' was molded after the UK's [[Independent Commission on Banking]]: EU Internal Markets Commissioner [[Michel Barnier]] set up the group in November 2011 in the context of the [[European sovereign-debt crisis]] and [[great recession]]. Its mandate was to determine whether structural reforms of EU banks would strengthen financial stability, improve efficiency and consumer protection in addition to the [[regulatory reform]] of the EU bank sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/bank/structural-reform/index_en.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110192304/http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/bank/structural-reform/index_en.htm |archivedate=2014-01-10 |df= }} accessdate Jan 10, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Regulatory reform had been ongoing since 2009 and culminated in the adoption of the [[European Banking Authority]] in October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;European Commission, The EU Single Market, Financial Services: Banking Union website http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/finances/banking-union/index_en.htm#srm accessdate Jan 10, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In France [[SFAF]] and [[World Pensions &amp; Investments Forum|World Pensions Council (WPC)]] banking experts have argued that, beyond fragmented national [[legislation]]s, [[statutory]] rules should be adopted and implemented within the broader context of [[separation of powers]] in [[European Union law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.canadianeuropean.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/Bank_Regulation_and_Financial_Orthodoxy__RAF__Jan_2010.784613.pdf |accessdate=14 July 2012 |first=M Nicolas |last=Firzli |date=January 2010 |title=Bank Regulation and Financial Orthodoxy: the Lessons from the Glass-Steagall Act |language=French |pages=49–52 |journal=Revue Analyse Financière |issue=34 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215105738/http://www.canadianeuropean.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/Bank_Regulation_and_Financial_Orthodoxy__RAF__Jan_2010.784613.pdf |archivedate=15 February 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Le Parisien "&gt;{{Cite news | first= Marie |last=Lepesant|title= Le Modèle des Banques Françaises en Question|url= http://www.leparisien.fr/milibris/liseuse/LeParisien/?type=le-parisien-economie&amp;date=20120611| work=[[Le Parisien]] |date= June 11, 2012  |accessdate= 12 June 2012  |language=French}} - Quoting M.

This perspective gained ground after the [[Libor scandal]] broke news in June 2012, with mainstream opinion leaders such as [[Financial Times]] editorial writers in the [[UK]] and the Centre des Jeunes Dirigeants (CJD), a Business Federation in [[France]] calling as in 2008, for adoption of an EU-wide "Glass Steagall II".&lt;ref name="FT "&gt;{{Cite news | first= Page |last= Editorial|title= Restoring trust after Diamond|url= http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/498248bc-c518-11e1-b8fd-00144feabdc0.html#axzz20iPBjEvM| work=[[Financial Times]] |date= July 3, 2012  |accessdate= 15 July 2012  }} quoting FT Editorial Page.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CJD "&gt;{{Cite news | first= CJD |title= Objectif Oïkos: 12 Propositions pour 2012|url= http://www.calameo.com/read/000947174318c527fe7e6| work= Propositions du CJD |date= November 2011 – June 2012 |accessdate= 12 June 2012 |language=French}} p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, former Citigroup Chairman and CEO [[Sandy Weill]], considered one of the driving forces behind the financial [[deregulation]] and “mega-[[merger]]s” of the 1990s, surprised [[financial analyst]]s in Europe and North American July 25, 2012, by “calling for splitting up the [[commercial bank]]s from the [[investment bank]]s. In effect, he says: "bring back the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 which led to half a century, free of financial crises.”&lt;ref name="Forbes "&gt;{{Cite news|first=Steve |last=Denning|title= Rethinking Capitalism: Sandy Weill Says Bring Back Glass-Steagall|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2012/07/25/rethinking-capitalism-sandy-weill-says-bring-back-glass-steagall| work=[[Forbes]] |date= July 25, 2012  |accessdate= 25 July 2012 }} Quoting interview on CNBC’s Squawk-Box.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final report==
The 153 page [http://www.ec.europa.eu/internal_market/bank/docs/high-level_expert_group/report_en.pdf final version of the report] was published October 2, 2012.  The recommendations combined key features of the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] and the [[UK]]’s 2011 "Vickers Report" by the [[Independent Commission on Banking]].

The report recommended actions in the following 5 areas:

# Mandatory separation of [[proprietary trading]] and other high-risk trading;
# Additional separation of activities, conditional on the recovery and resolution plan (RRP);&lt;ref&gt;Definition: sometimes known as "living wills" of an institution. Recovery plans, which come into play when a firm falls under extreme stress, outline actions to maintain the firm as a going concern. Resolution plans would be resorted to in the event of failure of a financial institution and aim to manage its resolution in a controlled manner with minimum cost and systemic disruption.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Amendments to the use of [[bail-in]] instruments as a resolution tool;
# Toughening of [[capital requirements]] on trading assets and real estate related loans (i.e. mortgages), aka [[fractional reserve banking]];
# Strengthening bank governance and control of banks, including measures to rein in or [[bail-in]] bonuses.

The report gives an overview of the structure and evolution of the EU banking sector with its tradition of [[universal bank]]ing, and assesses banking reforms in the European post-debt crisis era. It lists a range of proposals to remedy deficits in bank reforms, such as improving of already existing regulations in risk management under the [[Basel III]] rules, [[corporate governance]], bank resolution mechanisms, management and strengthening of supervision and compensation rules for bank staff. It advocates for a better alignment of [[executive pay]] with long term corporate and [[national interest]]s, by raising the [[fixed income]] or “debt” component of bankers’ bonuses, meaning the bonuses could be decreased if short-term profits yield long-term troubles, paying bonuses with bonds. The Swiss bank UBS adopted the latter so called "bail-in bonds". 2/5/13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/02/06/business/ubs-new-bonus-clawback-rule | work=CNN | title=UBS reveals new tool to claw back bonuses - CNN.com | date=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Re 1) Mandatory separation of high-risk trading activities i.e. compartmentalization, or “ring-fencing” of [[proprietary trading|proprietary]] and third-party trading activities, without breaking banks up is to include [[risk management]] and [[capital (economics)|capital]] [[allocation of resources|allocation]]: “''the trading division will have to hold its own capital, meaning that it stands or falls by its own activities and cannot, in theory at least, knock over the bread-and-butter [[retail banking]] operations.''" Universal banks with very large trading arms either in absolute terms (over €100bn-£80bn-$130bn-¥10.2tr-Y821bn) or in proportion to the rest of the bank (greater than 15%-25%) should be forced to hold separate capital for its trading operations.

Re 2)-5) Mechanisms to allow a bank to enter bankruptcy instead of the public having to rescue it: "The idea is to get taxpayers off the hook by ensuring that governments do not have to step in to safeguard deposits if traders blow a hole in their balance sheet''”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/0ff0b3a4-0c8a-11e2-a73c-00144feabdc0.html#axzz29DzRm9O6 |accessdate=13 October 2012 |first=Tom |last=Burgis |date=Oct 2, 2012 | title= The Liikanen report decoded |pages=n.a. |journal=[[Financial Times]] |issue=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a 6-week public comment period, closed on 11/13/2012, 89 responses mainly by financial organizations were received, summarized on 6 pages&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/consultations/2012/hleg-banking/replies-summary_en.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 May 2013, the Liikanen report's conclusion was its public discussion in a European Commission meeting on Bank Structural Reform. The main points are concisely summarized on 4 pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/bank/structural-reform/index_en.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110192304/http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/bank/structural-reform/index_en.htm |archivedate=2014-01-10 |df= }} accessdate January 10, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treaty ==
The treaty allows for copyright exceptions to facilitate the creation of accessible versions of books and other copyrighted works for visually impaired persons. It sets a norm for countries ratifying the treaty to have a domestic copyright exception covering these activities, and allowing for the import and export of such materials.

Sixty three (recently 28 European countries also ratified) countries signed the treaty as of the close of the diplomatic conference in Marrakesh. The ratification of 20 states was required for the treaty to enter into effect;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wipo.int/pressroom/en/articles/2013/article_0018.html |title=Stevie Wonder hails landmark WIPO treaty boosting access to books for blind and visually impaired persons |publisher=[[World Intellectual Property Organization]] |date=28 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the 20th ratification was received on 30 June 2016, and the treaty entered into force on 30 September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.wipo.int/pressroom/en/articles/2016/article_0007.html |title="Canada’s Accession to Marrakesh Treaty Brings Treaty into Force|date=June 30, 2016|publisher=WIPO Press Release}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.davidhammerstein.com/2016/09/marrakesh-treaty-day-1.html|title=Marrakesh Treaty: Day 1|author=David Hammerstein|access-date=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ratification ===
India was the first country to ratify the treaty, &lt;ref&gt;http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/notifications/marrakesh/treaty_marrakesh_1.html&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-ratifies-marrakesh-treaty-for-visually-impaired/article6171554.ece&lt;/ref&gt; on 24 July 2014. As of October 15, 2018&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/treaties/en/documents/pdf/marrakesh.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;, 80 countries have signed the Treaty and 71 states have ratified it including  EU:s 28 memberstates  who ratified as one entety (notification number 45) &lt;ref&gt;http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/notifications/marrakesh/treaty_marrakesh_45.html&lt;/ref&gt; ) &lt;ref name="WIPO-Administered Treaties"/&gt; , most recently Saudi Arabia &lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/WIPO/status/1065252208583823360&lt;/ref&gt;.

In March 2015, the [[Council of the European Union]] accused the [[European Commission]] of delaying the adoption of the treaty by EU and called upon the Commission "to submit without delay the necessary legislative proposal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tacd-ip.org/archives/1325 |title=Marrakesh in the EU: facing the excuses and delay tactics after Council statement |publisher=[[Trans Atlantic Consumer Dialogue|TransAtlantic Consumer Dialogue]] |work=IP Policy Committee blog |date=7 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statewatch.org/news/2015/apr/eu-council-marrakesh-treaty-guidance-7321-15.pdf |title=Proposal for a Council Decision on the conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of the Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons who are Blind, Visually Impaired, or Otherwise Print Disabled — Guidance for further work |publisher=[[Council of the European Union]] |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is continued opposition by some EU member states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.davidhammerstein.com/2017/01/germany-tries-to-cripple-right-to-read-eu-marrakesh-treaty-legislation-for-visually-impaired-persons-with-a-publishers-compensation|title=Germany moves against "right to read" Marrakesh Treaty for visually-impaired persons|author=David Hammerstein|access-date=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On September 20, 2017 the EU Commission published a directive and a regulation on the Marrakesh treaty that has to be transposed into national law, in all 28 member states, deadline for transposition: October 11, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/implementation-marrakesh-treaty-eu-law&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Union]] has committed to ratification and implementation of the Treaty, and member states are required to update their national laws to implement the Treaty's requirements later in 2018. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euroblind.org/campaigns-and-activities/current-campaigns/marrakesh-treaty |title=The Marrakesh Treaty|author=European Blind Union |access-date=31 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Union]] ratified the treaty for all 28 members on October 1, 2018. The provisions of the Treaty will go into effect across the EU (including in the United Kingdom) on January 1, 2019. &lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/i/status/1046805138168598536&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wipo.int/pressroom/en/articles/2018/article_0008.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3476">Conceived by [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and [[John F. Kennedy]], the 1961 '''McCloy–Zorin Accords''' between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] established a foundation or "roadmap" for all future negotiations and international treaties with regard to nuclear and general and complete disarmament under effective international control. Effectively aiming at abolishing war as an institution, it was unanimously passed by the [[UN General Assembly]] on 20 December.

The McCloy–Zorin Accords provided far-reaching measures. The Agreed Principles for General and Complete Disarmament, as they were also known, emphatically declared that war should "no longer [be] an instrument for settling international problems;" "general and complete disarmament" was to be "accompanied by the establishment of reliable procedures for the peaceful settlement of disputes." The agreement also called for the "dismantling of military establishments … cessation of the production of armaments … elimination of all stockpiles of [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear]], [[Chemical weapon|chemical]], [[Bacteriological weapon|bacteriological]] and other [[weapons of mass destruction]]s [and] … discontinuance of military expenditures." Member States were expected to make "agreed manpower" available to the United Nations, such as would be "necessary for an international peace force." In [[United Kingdom|Britain]] the trend was viewed with favor, its [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] apparently being happy "to see much in common between the Russian and the American plans," and aiming at "a master plan of our own, which would lead to the physical destruction of weapons, beginning now, and going on until the business is complete..."&lt;ref&gt;For an in-depth study see Andrew Martin, ''Legal Aspects of Disarmament,'' The British Institute of International and Comparative Law, London 1963 (An Address given under the auspices of The British Institute of International and Comparative Law on June 24, 1963, at the Royal Institute of International Affairs, Chatham House), p. 15 (International and Comparative Law Quarterly, Supplementary Publication No. 7, 1963)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963 Mr. [[Harold Wilson]], speaking for the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in an address to the [[Fabian Society]] said that he would like to "establish a separate Ministry of Disarmament."&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Martin, ''Legal Aspects of Disarmament,'' The British Institute of International and Comparative Law, London 1963 (An Address given under the auspices of The British Institute of International and Comparative Law on June 24, 1963, at the Royal Institute of International Affairs, Chatham House), p. 14 (International and Comparative Law Quarterly, Supplementary Publication No. 7, 1963)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Italic title}}

'''''Quia timet''''' ({{IPA-la|kwia timɛt}}, Latin for "because he fears") is an [[injunction]] to restrain [[wrongful act]]s which are threatened or imminent but have not yet commenced.  ''[[Fletcher v. Bealey]]'' (1884) [28 Ch.D. 688 at p.&amp;nbsp;698] stated the necessary conditions for [[equity courts]] to properly grant an injunction in such cases:
# proof of imminent danger;
# proof that the threatened [[Irreparable injury|injury will be practically irreparable]]; and
# proof that whenever the injurious circumstances ensue, it will be impossible to protect [[plaintiff]]’s interests, if relief is denied.

==''Brevia anticipantia''==
''Quia timet'' remedies were [[writ]]s at [[common law]]. According to [[Lord Coke]], "there be six writs of law that may be maintained quia timet, before any molestation, distress, or impleading; as. 1. A man may have his writ or [[mesne]], before he be distrained. 2. A [[warrantia chartae]], before he be imploded. 3. A [[monstraverunt]], before any distress or vexation. 4. An [[audita querela]], before any execution sued. 5. A [[curia claudenda]] before any default of inclosure. 6. A [[ne injustice vexes]], before any distress or molestation. And those are called brevia anticipantia, writs of prevention."&lt;ref&gt;[[Institutes of the Lawes of England|Coke on Littleton]] 100&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Quia timet'' injuctions in English law==
{{anchor|Quia timet injuctions in English law}}
''Quia timet'' injunctions refer to a type of injunction in English law obtained where a wrong is anticipated. ''Quia timet'' literally means "because he fears". 

According to the case ''[[Graigola Merthyr Co Ltd v Swansea Corpn]]'' to obtain a ''quia timet'' injunction there must be an immediate threat to do something.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Garton, Graham Moffat, Gerry Bean, Rebecca Probert (2015) ''Moffat's Trusts Law: Text and Materials'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 724&lt;/ref&gt; Moffat's Trusts Law states that a ''quia timet'' injunction can both prohibit something or mandate something to occur.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Garton, Graham Moffat, Gerry Bean, Rebecca Probert (2015) ''Moffat's Trusts Law: Text and Materials'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 724&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Revolo''' is a [[plug-in hybrid|plug-in]] [[Parallel hybrid|parallel]] [[Hybrid vehicle|hybrid]] technology that can be [[Retrofitting|retrofitted]] in both existing and new [[cars]]. This technology can also be used in buses and trucks.  The technology was developed by [[KPIT Technologies]] and the product will be manufactured through a [[joint venture]] between [[Bharat Forge]] and KPIT. As part of the joint venture, KPIT will license the hybrid technology while Bharat Forge will provide manufacturing, assembly, and integration.

Pre-compliance tests conducted at the Automotive research Association of India (ARAI), [[Pune]] have confirmed that the technology provides [[fuel efficiency]] improvements by over 40 percent and reduction in [[green house gas]] (GHG) emissions by over 30%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.nasscom.in/Nasscom/templates/NormalPage.aspx?id=59416 |title = Bharat Forge And KPIT To Form A Joint Venture - Announce ‘New Hybrid Technology Solution’ for Automobiles |publisher = [[Nasscom]] |date = 2010-06-16 |accessdate = 2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technology is to be marketed to [[OEM]]s and individual vehicle owners through a network of dealerships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.indianexpress.com/news/Bharat-Forge--KPIT-to-float-joint-venture/630376 |title = Bharat Forge, KPIT to float joint venture | publisher = [[Indian Express]] |date = 2010-06-07 |accessdate = 2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===Planning and concept===
The idea of Revolo first occurred to Tejas Kshatriya in 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.livemint.com/2010/07/29211227/Cleaner-greener-cheaper.html |title = Cleaner, greener, cheaper | publisher = [[Mint (newspaper)|Mint]] |date = 2010-07-29 |accessdate = 2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he was stuck in [[Mumbai]] traffic en route to [[Pune]].

KPIT sanctioned a team of four engineers for the project, which was kept separate from [[KPIT Cummins#Research and development|CREST]], the research and development center at KPIT. It took 2 years of research&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.thenational.ae/business/hybrid-car-makeover-to-hit-the-road |title = Hybrid car makeover to hit the road | publisher = [[The National (Abu Dhabi)]] |date = 2010-06-20 |accessdate = 2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a budget under US$2 million&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.livemint.com/2010/07/29211227/Cleaner-greener-cheaper.html |title = Cleaner, greener, cheaper | publisher = [[Mint (newspaper)|Mint]] |date = 2010-07-29 |accessdate = 2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; to evolve the idea through trial and error and several failures, including the inability of the system to withstand sudden surge in power when brakes were applied.

The research and development team studied the firing pattern of [[internal combustion engines]] and identified the weak spots that lead to fuel waste&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.thenational.ae/business/fill-the-gap-between-petrol-and-electric |title = Fill the gap between petrol and electric | publisher = [[The National (Abu Dhabi)]] |date = 2010-06-20 |accessdate = 2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and created a technology that can convert a passenger car to a hybrid that is environmentally friendly, cheap, fuel-efficient and at the same time offers good performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.thenational.ae/business/hybrid-car-makeover-to-hit-the-road |title = Hybrid car makeover to hit the road | publisher = [[The National (Abu Dhabi)]] |date = 2010-06-20 |accessdate = 2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Revolo is designed to work in typical stop-and-go city traffic and allows cars to cruise at about 30&amp;nbsp;km/h in the third gear without straining the engine.

===Latest developments===
KPIT continues the road tests of pilot vehicles as well as consumer trials with results so far having validated the pre-announced performance results. The team has further reduced the overall weight of the solution, improved on the durability and standardized many components across multiple vehicle platforms. Construction at the assembly and manufacturing plants continues. It is expected to be operational by March 2014.

The company will test various vehicles, including [[Automobiles|passenger cars]], with engines sizes between 800 cc and 2,500 cc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/2010/11/16/stories/2010111652720200.htm |title = KPIT plans road tests for hybrid tech soon | publisher = [[Business Line]] |date = 2010-11-15 |accessdate = 2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Production of limited hybrid kits is planned to start by first half of 2012.{{update inline|date=November 2017}} The commercial production would begin in 2012-13.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/2010/11/16/stories/2010111652720200.htm |title = KPIT Cummins plans road tests for hybrid tech soon | publisher = [[Business Line]] |date = 2010-11-15 |accessdate = 2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update inline|date=November 2017}}

==Technology==

===Revolo technology details===
The Revolo kit is similar to a [[retrofitting|retrofit]] [[compressed natural gas]] (CNG) kit which contains all required mechanical and electrical components in the package.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.wheelosphere.org/bharat-forge-india-unveil-retrofit-revolo-hybrid-kits-on-sale-in-india-in-six-months | title = Bharat Forge India unveil retrofit Revolo hybrid kits; on sale in India in six months | publisher = Wheelosphere | date = 2010-06-17 |accessdate = 2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The kit can be installed in both [[petrol]] and [[Diesel fuel|diesel vehicles]] within 4–6 hours by trained technicians who will be trained by a [[joint venture]] that KPIT has formed with [[Bharat Forge]].

The Revolo kit comprises a 7.5 to 10 [[horsepower]] [[electric motor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://blogs.edmunds.com/greencaradvisor/2010/09/phev-conversions-slow-to-catch-on-in-us-but-could-be-big-elsewhere.html | title = PHEV Conversions Slow to Catch On in U.S., But Could Be Big Elsewhere | publisher = [[Edmunds.com]] | date = 2010-09-13 |accessdate = 2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed and patented by KPIT, an electronic [[motor controller]], [[lead–acid battery]] pack, mechanical assembly and [[coupling]], [[proprietary software]] for control [[algorithms]] of the motor and batteries, and  [[battery management system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.thenational.ae/business/fill-the-gap-between-petrol-and-electric |title = Fill the gap between petrol and electric | publisher = [[The National (Abu Dhabi)]] |date = 2010-06-20 |accessdate = 2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a parallel hybrid the motor and engine will work simultaneously and as a plug-in, the vehicle can be charged through a standard external electricity source such as a domestic [[power outlet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.nasscom.in/Nasscom/templates/NormalPage.aspx?id=59416 |title = Bharat Forge And KPIT Cummins To Form A Joint Venture - Announce ‘New Hybrid Technology Solution’ for Automobiles |publisher = [[Nasscom]] |date = 2010-06-16 |accessdate = 2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike an electric vehicle, the vehicle will operate as a conventional fuel vehicle even if the batteries are completely drained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.nasscom.in/Nasscom/templates/NormalPage.aspx?id=59416 |title = Bharat Forge And KPIT Cummins To Form A Joint Venture - Announce ‘New Hybrid Technology Solution’ for Automobiles |publisher = [[Nasscom]] |date = 2010-06-16 |accessdate = 2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plug-in parallel hybrid conversion kit===
The conversion kit is a lot less complex and light in weight in context of the moving engine components which effectively enhances the [[fuel efficiency]] to twice as compared to existing solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.nasscom.in/Nasscom/templates/NormalPage.aspx?id=59416 |title = Bharat Forge And KPIT Cummins To Form A Joint Venture - Announce ‘New Hybrid Technology Solution’ for Automobiles |publisher = [[Nasscom]] |date = 2010-06-16 |accessdate = 2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Battery specifications: The solution is battery agnostic. It can be adopted to work with various types of batteries such as [[lead–acid batteries]] or [[Lithium-ion batteries]]. The solution typically produces 60 volts from five valve-regulated, lead–acid batteries, and can be recharged from the standard Indian household current of 230 volts in 4 to 6 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://blogs.edmunds.com/greencaradvisor/2010/09/phev-conversions-slow-to-catch-on-in-us-but-could-be-big-elsewhere.html | title = PHEV Conversions Slow to Catch On in U.S., But Could Be Big Elsewhere | publisher = [[Edmunds.com]] | date = 2010-09-13 |accessdate = 2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Revolo also consists of an in-built device that recognizes driving patterns and self-adjusts to provide optimum efficiency in stop-and-go traffic situations.

===Pricing===
Revolo is said to be 80 percent cheaper as compared to the [[retrofitting|after-market]] [[hybrid car]] kits available in the United States which cost around US$20,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://blogs.edmunds.com/greencaradvisor/2010/09/phev-conversions-slow-to-catch-on-in-us-but-could-be-big-elsewhere.html | title = PHEV Conversions Slow to Catch On in U.S., But Could Be Big Elsewhere | publisher = [[Edmunds.com]] | date = 2010-09-13 |accessdate = 2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be retrofitted into any vehicle at an average cost of [[Rupee|Rs.]] 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.livemint.com/2010/07/29211227/Cleaner-greener-cheaper.html |title = Cleaner, greener, cheaper | publisher = [[Mint (newspaper)|Mint]] |date = 2010-07-29 |accessdate = 2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of San Bernardino, California, occupies much of the [[San Bernardino Valley]], which indigenous tribespeople originally referred to as "The Valley of the Cupped Hand of God". The [[Tongva people|Tongva Indians]] also called the San Bernardino area '''Wa'aach''' in their language.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pamela Munro|Munro, Pamela]], et al., ''Yaara' Shiraaw'ax 'Eyooshiraaw'a. Now You're Speaking Our Language: Gabrielino/Tongva/Fernandeño''. Lulu.com: 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon seeing the immense geological arrowhead-shaped rock formation on the side of the [[San Bernardino Mountains]], they found the [[Hot spring|hot]] and [[Spring (hydrology)|cold springs]] to which the "arrowhead" seemed to point.&lt;!-- This needs to be combined somehow with the mention in the paragraph after next--&gt;

===19th century===
[[File:SanBernardino-1852.jpg|thumb|left|San Bernardino, 1852]]
[[Politana, California|Politana]] was the first Spanish settlement in the San Bernardino Valley, named for [[Bernardino of Siena]].  Politana was established May 20, 1810, as a mission chapel and supply station by the [[Mission San Gabriel]] in the [[ranchería]] of the Guachama Indians that lived on the bluff that is now known as [[Bunker Hill (San Bernardino, California)|Bunker Hill]], near [[Lytle Creek (California)|Lytle Creek]].  Two years later the settlement was destroyed by superstitious local tribesmen, following powerful earthquakes that shook the region. Several years later, the [[Serrano people|Serrano]] and [[Cahuilla|Mountain Cahuilla]] rebuilt the Politana rancheria, and in 1819 invited the missionaries to return to the valley. They did and established the [[San Bernardino de Sena Estancia]].  Serrano and Cahuilla people inhabited Politana until long after the 1830s decree of secularization and the 1842 inclusion into the [[Rancho San Bernardino]] land grant of the [[José del Carmen Lugo]] family.&lt;ref name=History&gt;[https://archive.org/details/historyofsanbern00caba  Caballeria y Collell, Juan, HISTORY OF SAN BERNARDINO VALLEY, from the padres to the pioneers, 1810-1851, Times-Index Press, San Bernardino, Cal., 1902.]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|37–41}}

The city of San Bernardino is one of the oldest communities in the state of California, and in its present-day location, was not largely settled until 1851, after California became a state. The first [[English-American|Anglo-American]] colony was established by pioneers associated with [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] or Mormons.  Following the Mormon colonists purchase of Rancho San Bernardino, and the establishment of the town of San Bernardino in 1851, San Bernardino County was formed in 1853 from parts of [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]]. Mormon colonists developed irrigated, commercial farming and lumbering, supplying agricultural produce and lumber throughout Southern California. The city was officially incorporated in 1857. Later that year, most of the colonists were recalled by [[Brigham Young]] in 1857 due to the [[Utah War]].  Once highly regarded in early California, news of the [[Mountain Meadows Massacre]] poisoned attitudes toward the Mormons. Some Mormons would stay in San Bernardino and some later returned from [[Utah]], but a real estate consortium from [[El Monte, California|El Monte]] and [[Los Angeles]] bought most of the lands of the old rancho and of the departing colonists. They sold these lands to new settlers who came to dominate the culture and politics in the county and San Bernardino became a typical American frontier town. Many of the new land owners disliked the sober Mormons, indulging in drinking at saloons now allowed in the town. Disorder, fighting and violence in the vicinity became common, reaching a climax in the 1859 [[Ainsworth - Gentry Affair]].

In 1860 a gold rush began in the mountains nearby with the discovery of [[gold]] by [[William F. Holcomb]] in [[Holcomb Valley]] early 1860.  Another strike followed in the upper reach of Lytle Creek. By the 1860s, San Bernardino had also became an important trading hub in [[Southern California]]. The city already on the [[Mormon Road#Los Angeles .E2.80.93 Salt Lake Road 1855.E2.80.931905|Los Angeles – Salt Lake Road]], became the starting point for the [[Mojave Road]] from 1858 and [[Bradshaw Trail]] from 1862 to the mines along the [[Colorado River]] and within the [[Arizona Territory]] in the [[Steamboats of the Colorado River#Colorado River Gold Rush|gold rush of 1862-1864]].

[[File:SanBernardino-1865.jpg|thumb|left|San Bernardino, 1865]]
&lt;!--The following should be combined somehow with the paragraph before last--&gt;
Near San Bernardino is a naturally formed arrowhead-shaped rock formation on the side of a mountain. It measures 1375 feet by 449 feet. According to the Native American legend regarding the landmark arrowhead, an arrow from Heaven burned the formation onto the mountainside in order to show tribes where they could be healed. During the mid-19th century, "Dr." David Noble Smith claimed that a saint-like being appeared before him and told of a far-off land with exceptional climate and curative waters, marked by a gigantic arrowhead. Smith's search for that unique arrowhead formation began in Texas, and eventually ended at Arrowhead Springs in California in 1857. By 1889, word of the springs, along with the hotel on the site (and a belief in the effect on general health of the water from the springs) had grown considerably. Hotel guests often raved about the crystal-clear water from the cold springs, which prompted Seth Marshall to set up a bottling operation in the hotel's basement. By 1905, water from the cold springs was being shipped to Los Angeles under the newly created [[Arrowhead Water|"Arrowhead" trademark]].

Indigenous people of the San Bernardino Valley and Mountains were collectively identified by Spanish explorers in the 19th century as [[Serrano (people)|Serrano]], a term meaning highlander. Serrano living near what is now Big Bear Lake were called Yuhaviatam, or "People of the Pines". In 1866, to clear the way for settlers and gold miners, state militia conducted a 32-day campaign slaughtering men, women, and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yuhaviatam leader Santos Manuel guided his people from their ancient homeland to a village site in the San Bernardino foothills. The United States government in 1891 established it as a tribal reservation and named it after Santos Manuel.

In 1867, the first Chinese immigrants arrived in San Bernardino.

In 1883, [[California Southern Railroad]] established a rail link through San Bernardino between Los Angeles and the rest of the country.

In 1905, the city of San Bernardino passed its first charter.

World War II brought [[Norton Air Force Base]].

In 1940, [[Richard and Maurice McDonald]]  founded [[McDonald's]], along with its innovative restaurant concept, in the city.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Modern Marvels]]'' "Fast Food Tech"; [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]; Viewed December 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, the Panorama Fire destroyed 284 homes.

San Bernardino won the [[All-America City]] award in 1977,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Past Winners|url=https://www.nationalcivicleague.org/america-city-award/past-winners/?string=san+bernadino|website=National Civic League|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the city subsequently went into a long decline and has only recently begun to recover from the three recessions of the late 20th/early 21st centuries.

In 1994, Norton Air Force Base closed to become [[San Bernardino International Airport]].

{{Expand section|City bankruptcy, 2015 shooting|date=February 2016}}
In October 2003, another wildfire, the Old Fire, destroyed over 1,000 homes.

In August 2012, San Bernardino filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy, with more than $1 billion in debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-bankrupty-san-bernardino-idUSBRE87105220120802|title=San Bernardino, California, files for bankruptcy with over $1 billion in debts|last=|first=|date=August 2, 2012|work=Reuters|access-date=June 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move froze the city's payments to creditors, including its pension payments to the California Public Employees Retirement System for nearly a year. Key changes the city made during the bankruptcy process included: outsourcing its fire department to the county and re-writing the city's charter to provide a more clear chain of command. Following a judge's approval, the city emerged from bankruptcy in February 2017, making it one of the longest municipal bankruptcies in the United States.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

==Geography==
{{See also| Downtown San Bernardino}}
[[File:Sb 2004 dt skyline 006a.jpg|thumb|right|San Bernardino with downtown in the background and the I-215 freeway in the foreground.]]
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|59.6|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|59.2|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|0.4|sqmi|km2}}, or 0.74%, is water.

The city lies in the San Bernardino foothills and the eastern portion of the [[San Bernardino Valley]], roughly {{convert|60|mi|km}} east of Los Angeles. Some major geographical features of the city include the [[San Bernardino Mountains]] and the [[San Bernardino National Forest]], in which the city's northernmost neighborhood, Arrowhead Springs, is located; the [[Cajon Pass]] adjacent to the northwest border; City Creek, [[Lytle Creek (California)|Lytle Creek]], [[San Timoteo Creek]], Twin Creek, Warm Creek (as modified through flood control channels) feed the [[Santa Ana River]], which forms part of the city's southern border south of [[San Bernardino International Airport]].

San Bernardino is unique among Southern Californian cities because of its wealth of water, which is mostly contained in underground aquifers. A large part of the city is over the Bunker Hill Groundwater Basin, including [[downtown San Bernardino|downtown]]. This fact accounts for a historically high water table in portions of the city, including at the former Urbita Springs, a lake which no longer exists and is now the site of the [[Inland Center]] Mall. Seccombe Lake, named after a former mayor, is a [[Water reservoir|manmade lake]] at Sierra Way and 5th Street. The San Bernardino Valley Municipal Water District ("Muni") has plans to build two more large, multi-acre lakes north and south of historic downtown in order to reduce groundwater, mitigate the risks of liquefaction in a future earthquake, and sell the valuable water to neighboring agencies.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

The city has several notable hills and mountains; among them are: [[Shandin Hills|Perris Hill]] (named after Fred Perris, an early engineer, and the namesake of [[Perris, California]]); [[Shandin Hills|Kendall Hill]] (which is near California State University); and Little Mountain, which rises among [[Shandin Hills]] (generally bounded by Sierra Way, 30th Street, Kendall Drive, and [[Interstate 215 (California)|Interstate 215]]).

Freeways act as significant geographical dividers for the city of San Bernardino. Interstate 215 is the major east-west divider, while [[State Route 210 (California)|State Route 210]] is the major north-south divider. [[Interstate 10 (California)|Interstate 10]] is in the southern part of the city. Other major highways include [[State Route 206 (California)|State Route 206]] (Kendall Drive and E Street); [[State Route 66 (California)|State Route 66]] (which includes the former U.S. 66); [[State Route 18 (California)|State Route 18]] (from State Route 210 north on Waterman Avenue to the northern [[City limits]] into the mountain communities), and [[California State Route 259|State Route 259]], the freeway connector between State Route 210 and I-215.

===Climate===
[[File:Sbsnow 2.jpg|thumb|January snowfall in San Bernardino with [[Shandin Hills]] in the background. near [[Verdemont, San Bernardino, California|Verdemont]] and the [[University District, San Bernardino|University District]]]]
San Bernardino features a hot-summer [[Mediterranean climate]] (''Csa'' in the [[Köppen climate classification]]) with mild winters and hot, dry summers. Relative to other areas in Southern California, winters are colder, with frost and with chilly to cold morning temperatures common. The particularly arid climate during the summer prevents tropospheric clouds from forming, meaning temperatures rise to what is considered by NOAA scientists as Class Orange. Summer is also a lot warmer with the highest recorded summer temperature at 118&amp;nbsp;°F (47.8&amp;nbsp;°C) on July 6, 2018.&lt;ref name= Weather.com &gt;{{cite web

| publisher = The Weather Channel
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the winter, snow flurries occur upon occasion. San Bernardino gets an average of {{convert|16|in|mm|0}} of rain, hail, or light snow showers each year. [[Arrowhead Springs]], San Bernardino's northernmost neighborhood gets snow, heavily at times, due to its elevation of about {{convert|3000|ft|m}} above sea level.

The seasonal [[Santa Ana wind]]s are felt particularly strongly in the San Bernardino area as warm and dry air is channeled through nearby [[Cajon Pass]] at times during the autumn months. This phenomenon markedly increases the wildfire danger in the foothills, canyon, and mountain communities that the cycle of cold, wet winters and dry summers helps create.

According to the [[LA Times]] San Bernardino County has highest levels of [[Tropospheric ozone|ozone]] in the United States, averaging 102 parts per billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-what-new-smog-rules-mean-for-california-air-pollution-20150930-story.html  New attack on California's dirty air]

===Neighborhoods and districts===
The neighborhoods of San Bernardino are not commonly named. Some reflect geographical regions that existed before annexation, and others originated with specific housing developments. [[Arrowhead Springs]] extends from the historic Arrowhead Springs Hotel and Spa in the north to I-210 in the south and from [[Shandin Hills]] in the west to east Twin Creek in the east. [[Del Rosa, San Bernardino, California|Del Rosa]] is the area generally between the foothills and Highland, Mountain and Arden Avenues. Delmann Heights is the area north of Highland Avenue, west of I-215, and east of the unincorporated area of [[Muscoy, California]] (which is within the city's sphere of influence for annexation). Some portions of Highland are within the city of San Bernardino, generally consistent with the portions of historical "West Highlands" north of Highland Avenue. The city also contains the post office for Patton, California, the area coextensive with Patton Hospital. Mountain Shadows is the development name for the area between Palm Avenue and Highland Avenue to State Route 330. The "West Side" is used generically to refer to the areas West of I-215. North Loma Linda is the area west of [[Mountain View Acres, California|Mountain View Acres]] (the border with Redlands), south of the Santa Ana River, north of the [[San Bernardino Freeway]] (I-10), and east of Tippecanoe Avenue. The area north of Northpark Boulevard from University Parkway to Electric Avenue, and the area north of 40th Street from Electric Avenue to Harrison Street is called
Arrowhead Farms. The area west of University Parkway, and north of Kendall Drive to the north city area is called [[Verdemont]]. The "Bench" or "Rialto Bench" refers to the area with Rialto mailing addresses between [[Foothill Boulevard (Southern California)|Foothill Boulevard]] and Base Line Street.

San Bernardino is divided into several districts. Many hotels, restaurants, and retail establishments have been built around Hospitality Lane&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mapquest.com/maps?address=S+E+St+%26+W+Hospitality+Ln&amp;city=San+Bernardino&amp;state=CA&amp;zipcode=92408&amp;latitude=34.06568&amp;longitude=-117.29345&amp;geocode=INTERSECTION |title=Hospitality Ln. &amp; E St |publisher=Mapquest.com |accessdate=December 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the southern part of the city, creating an informal [[business district]]. [[Downtown San Bernardino|Downtown]] is its own district with shopping and government buildings. In the foothills of the San Bernardino Mountains lies the [[University District, San Bernardino|University District]], which is a commercial area designed to support the California State University with shopping, dining, and high-density residential space. On the southern side of I-215 and the University District is the Cajon Pass light-industrial district where warehouses are situated to take advantage of this important connection between Southern California and the rest of the United States. On the opposite side of the city is the San Bernardino International Gateway, which encompasses the San Bernardino International Airport (SBD) and the Alliance California Logistics campus (air cargo hub). Nearby is the Burlington Northern Santa Fe rail hub. The combination of these assets (airport; rail hub; extensive freeway system; and, Cajon Pass) makes the city important in the movement of goods and people between Southern California and the rest of the United States.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

The city of San Bernardino is in the process of developing a historic district around the 1918 Santa Fe Depot, which recently underwent a $15.6 million restoration.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} When completed, this area will connect to the downtown district with period street lights and street furniture, historic homes and other structures, a new museum, coffee bars and, a mercado with an architectural style in keeping with the [[Mission Revival]] station.

San Bernardino has communities known for residences of millionaires and increasingly affluent sections of town: [[Del Rosa, San Bernardino, California|Del Rosa]], [[University Heights, San Bernardino, California|University Heights]] (Kendall Farms) and [[University Hills, San Bernardino, California|University Hills]], and [[Verdemont, San Bernardino, California|Verdemont]].{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

===Ethnic diversity===
{{more citations needed|date=April 2012}}
Western, central, and parts of eastern San Bernardino are home to mixed-ethnic working class populations, of which the Latino and African-American populations comprise the vast majority of the city. Historically, many Latinos, primarily [[Mexican-American]]s and [[Mexico|Mexicans]], lived on Mount Vernon Avenue on the West Side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jun/29/local/me-deadprez29 | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Murder trial exposes gang intrigue, greed | first=Sam | last=Quinones | date=June 29, 2008|accessdate=December 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1960s, the Medical Center (formerly known as [[Muscoy, California|Muscoy]]) and Base Line corridors were mostly black, in particular in the east side and west side areas centering on public housing projects Waterman Gardens and the public housing on Medical Center drive. The heart of the Mexican-American community is on the West and Southside of San Bernardino, but is slowly expanding throughout the entire city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbsun.com/elections/ci_9590759 |title=Obama inspires hope on Westside&amp;nbsp;– San Bernardino County Sun |publisher=Sbsun.com |date=March 9, 2010 |accessdate=December 10, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217091401/http://www.sbsun.com/elections/ci_9590759 |archivedate=February 17, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pe.com/localnews/sbcounty/stories/PE_News_Local_S_mobilize21.2f179b8.html |title=Inland get-out-the-vote effort tries personal contact |accessdate=2008-10-20 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090921175649/http://www.pe.com/localnews/sbcounty/stories/PE_News_Local_S_mobilize21.2f179b8.html |archivedate=September 21, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; San Bernardino's only Jewish congregation moved to Redlands in December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Some Asian Americans live in and around the city of San Bernardino, as in a late 19th-century-era (gone) [[Chinatowns in the United States#Inland Empire|Chinatown]] and formerly [[Japanese-American]] area in Seccombe Park on the east end of downtown, and a large East-Asian community in [[North Loma Linda, California|North Loma Linda]]. Others live in nearby [[Loma Linda, California|Loma Linda]] to the south across the Santa Ana River.

==Economy==
Government, retail, and [[Service industry|service industries]] dominate the economy of the city of San Bernardino. From 1998 to 2004, San Bernardino's economy grew by 26,217 jobs, a 37% increase, to 97,139. Government was both the largest and the fastest-growing employment sector, reaching close to 20,000 jobs in 2004. Other significant
sectors were retail (16,000 jobs) and education (13,200 jobs).&lt;ref name="ULI"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Advisory Services Panel | title=San Bernardino, California: Crossroads of the Southwest | url=http://www.ci.san-bernardino.ca.us/civica/filebank/blobdload.asp?BlobID=4907 | publisher=[[Urban Land Institute]] | location=Washington, D.C. | date=June 24–29, 2007 | accessdate=December 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:By Metrolink station, San Bernardino, CA.jpg|thumb|The Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway [[intermodal freight transport]] yard]]
The city's location close to the [[Cajon Pass|Cajon]] and [[San Gorgonio Pass|San Gorgonio]] passes, and at the junctions of the [[I-10]], I-215, and SR-210 freeways, positions it as an intermodal logistics hub. The city hosts the [[Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway]]'s [[intermodal freight transport]] yard, the Yellow Freight Systems' [[cross-docking]] trucking center, and Pacific Motor Trucking. Large warehouses for [[Kohl's]], [[Mattel]], [[Pep Boys]], and [[Stater Bros.]] have been developed near the [[San Bernardino International Airport]].&lt;ref name="ULI" /&gt;

Over the last few decades, the city's riverfront district along Hospitality Lane has drawn much of the regional economic development away from the historic [[downtown San Bernardino|downtown]] of the city so that the area now hosts a full complement of office buildings, big-box retailers, restaurants, and hotels situated around the Santa Ana River.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The closing of [[Norton Air Force Base]] in 1994 resulted in the loss of 10,000 military and civilian jobs and sent San Bernardino's economy into a downturn that has been somewhat offset by more recent growth in the intermodal shipping industry. The jobless rate in the region rose to more than 12 percent during the years immediately after the base closing. As of 2007 households within one mile of the city core had a median income of only $20,480, less than half that of the [[Inland Empire (California)|Inland region]] as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Brown | first=Josh | title=San Bernardino's base redevelopment efforts take circuitous path | url=http://www.pe.com/localnews/sbcounty/stories/PE_News_Local_D_nortonmain26.2037459.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520021635/http://www.pe.com/localnews/sbcounty/stories/PE_News_Local_D_nortonmain26.2037459.html | archivedate=May 20, 2011 | publisher=[[Press Enterprise (California)|Press Enterprise]] | date=July 25, 2007 | accessdate=December 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 15 percent of San Bernardino residents are unemployed as of 2012, and over 40 percent are on some form of public assistance.&lt;ref name=Willon&gt;{{cite news|last=Willon|first=Phil|title=Plenty of blame on long road to San Bernardino bankruptcy|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-san-bernardino-20120713,0,3298664.story|accessdate=July 17, 2012|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=July 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the US Census, 34.6 percent of residents live below the poverty level, making San Bernardino the poorest city for its population in California, and the second poorest in the US next to Detroit.&lt;ref name=Romero&gt;{{cite news|last=Romero|first=Dennis|title=America's Second Poorest Big City is Right Here in Southern California: San Bernardino|url=http://blogs.laweekly.com/informer/2011/10/san_bernardino_poor_poverty_so.php|accessdate=July 12, 2012|newspaper=LA Weekly|date=October 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:San Bernardino City Hall, 2009.JPG|thumb|San Bernardino City Hall building in [[downtown San Bernardino|downtown]], was designed in 1963 by [[César Pelli]]]]
The city of San Bernardino is a [[charter city]], a form of government under California that allows limited home-rule, in that it can pass its own laws not in conflict with state law, such as when state law is silent, or expressly allows municipal regulations of areas of local concern. San Bernardino became a charter city in 1905, the most current charter was passed in 2004.

The city of San Bernardino has a full-time, elected mayor, a [[city manager]], an elected City Attorney, [[City clerk|City Clerk]], and City Treasurer, and seven council positions elected in a ward system. The charter also created the [[San Bernardino City Unified School District]], a legally separate agency, and the Board of Water Commissioners, a semi-autonomous, but legally indistinct commission, and a Board of Library Trustees. The City Manager is responsible for all department heads, except for the fire and police chiefs. Previously, the San Bernardino Municipal Code recognized a City Administrator.

When the city originally adopted a ward system, there were five wards. In the 1960s, the Council was expanded to seven wards. The boundaries are adjusted with each federal census. The current council is:&lt;ref name=officials/&gt;
* Mayor: [[R. Carey Davis]]
* First Ward: Virginia Marquez
* Second Ward: Benito J. Barrios
* Third Ward: John Valdivia
* Fourth Ward: Fred Shorrett
* Fifth Ward: Henry Nickel
* Sixth Ward: Rikke Van Johnson
* Seventh Ward: James L. Mulvihill

As per California law, all city positions are [[nonpartisan]]. [[Bob Holcomb]] (1922–2010) was the longest serving Mayor of San Bernardino to date, holding the office from 1971 until 1985 and again from 1989 to 1993.&lt;ref name=sbs&gt;{{cite news|first=James Rufus|last=Koren|title=Ex-mayor of San Bernardino dies at 88|url=http://www.sbsun.com/ci_16738877?source=most_viewed|work=[[The San Bernardino Sun]]|date=November 29, 2010|accessdate=December 11, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314032949/http://www.sbsun.com/ci_16738877?source=most_viewed|archivedate=March 14, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cct&gt;{{cite news|first=Andrew |last=Edwards |title=Former SB mayor W.R.

San Bernardino's legal community has two centers: downtown and Hospitality Lane. Criminal, family, and government lawyers are centered downtown, while local civil firms and outposts of state and national firms, corporate, and insurance defense firms, are located along Hospitality Lane. The government of [[Mexico]] has a consulate in downtown San Bernardino on the southeast corner of Third Street and "D" Street. Citizens of Mexico can obtain a [[Matrícula Consular]], which many governments and businesses use in lieu of U.S. [[photo identification]].

====Bankruptcy====
On July 10, 2012, the City Council of San Bernardino decided to seek protection under [[Chapter 9, Title 11, United States Code]], making it the third California municipality to do so in less than two weeks (after [[Stockton, California|Stockton]] and the town of [[Mammoth Lakes, California|Mammoth Lakes]]), and the second-largest ever.  According to state law, the city would normally have to negotiate with creditors first, but, because they declared a fiscal emergency in June, that requirement did not apply.&lt;ref name="CBS20120711" &gt;{{cite web|title=3rd Calif. city to file for bankruptcy in 1 month|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-201_162-57469953/3rd-calif-city-to-file-for-bankruptcy-in-1-month/|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=July 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BW20120817"&gt;{{cite news|last=Church|first=Steven|title=San Bernardino Bankruptcy Judge Sets Oct. 24 Deadline|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-08-17/san-bernardino-bankruptcy-judge-sets-oct-dot-24-deadline|accessdate=August 21, 2012|newspaper=BloombergBusinessWeek|date=August 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was filed on August 1.&lt;ref name="Rtrs20120802" /&gt;

====Municipal code====
As a [[charter city]], San Bernardino may make and enforce its own laws as long as they are not in conflict with the laws of the State of California. These rules have been codified as the [http://sbcity.org/residents/municipal_code.asp San Bernardino Municipal Code]. Violations of the code, punishable as a [[misdemeanor]] or [[infraction]] (or both) are prosecuted by the City Attorney's Office in the [http://www.sb-court.org/ San Bernardino County Superior Court]. The city also has two administrative processes for violations of the code, as well as other adopted codes, like the [[California Building Standards Code#Parts|California Building Code]] and the [[California Building Standards Code#Parts|California Fire Code]]. One process is an administrative citation system, similar to a [[Parking violation|parking ticket]], with a pay or contest procedure. The other is an [[Hearing (law)|administrative hearing]] process, generally used by the Code Enforcement Department for prosecuting multiple code violations.

====City of San Bernardino Economic Development Agency====
The Redevelopment Agency of the City of San Bernardino, also known as the "Economic Development Agency of the City of San Bernardino," is a separate legal entity, though the City Council of the city of San Bernardino sits as the Agency Board, and the mayor is its executive.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

====Downtown San Bernardino revitalization efforts====

In June 2009, the city's Economic Development Agency, presented the San Bernardino City Council with the Downtown Core Vision / Action Plan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=City of San Bernardino EDA, Pirih Productions, and Brostrom Software Solutions |url=http://www.sbrda.org/corevision.htm |title=Downtown Core Vision |publisher=Sbrda.org |accessdate=December 10, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009125146/http://www.sbrda.org/corevision.htm |archive-date=October 9, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;– a guide for revitalizing Downtown San Bernardino for the next 10 years. The plan, which the city council approved to support, is the culmination of a year of research, community participation, and planning led by the city's EDA and the urban planning firm EDAW which has worked on master planning across the globe for downtown areas that include Milan, Italy; London, England; New York, New York; and Denver, Colorado, to name a few.

A driving force in the initial phase of the revitalization efforts is the development of an arts and culture district in the heart of Downtown San Bernardino.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} This effort is being anchored by the historic and iconic California Theatre,&lt;ref name="californiatheatre.net"/&gt; which has been in continuous operation since first opening its doors in 1928. California-based Maya Cinemas, which is adjacent to California Theatre, is in the process of renovating the former CinemaStar movie theatre. These two entertainment facilities are the foundation of what will become a vibrant center for the arts and culture.

===Joint-power authorities===
San Bernardino shares certain powers with other agencies to form legally separate entities known as joint-power authorities under California law. These include [[Omnitrans]], which provides transportation throughout the east and west valleys of San Bernardino County, SANBAG, which coordinates transportation projects throughout the county, and the Inland Valley Development Agency, which is responsible for redevelopment of the areas around the [[San Bernardino International Airport]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

===County seat===
[[File:San Bernardino County Court House.JPG|right|thumb|San Bernardino County Court House, built in 1926.]]
San Bernardino is the [[county seat]] of [[San Bernardino County]], the largest formal county in the contiguous United States by area, but smaller than the informally organized county equivalent [[Yukon-Koyukuk Census Area, Alaska]] and the formal county equivalent [[North Slope Borough, Alaska]], as well as 4 other formal county equivalents and 5 other informally organized county equivalents in [[Alaska]]. Various [[State court (United States)|state courts]], (for civil, criminal and juvenile trials) operate under the auspices of the [[Superior court|Superior Court]], San Bernardino District (formerly Central Division prior to the unification of the Superior and Municipal Courts in 1998). Currently, the [[Superior Court of California]] county courthouse is located at 351 North Arrowhead Avenue. It consists of a four-story building of steel and concrete construction built in 1927. A six-story addition was added in the 1950s. Currently, the 1926 structure is being retrofitted.  A new courthouse, located at 247 West Third Street, opened in 2014, which houses civil courts.

Juvenile Court and Juvenile Hall are located in a county enclave adjacent to the city on Gilbert Street, near the site of the former County Hospital.

The County's [[District attorney|District Attorney]] and the Public Defender both have their main offices on Mountain View Avenue, directly east of the Courthouse.

The [[California Court of Appeal]] Fourth District, Division Two used to be located in San Bernardino, but moved to Riverside in the 1990s. Federal cases (including Bankruptcy) are also heard in Riverside courthouses.

[[File:San Bernardino County Arrowhead Plaza.jpg|right|thumb|San Bernardino County Government Center, 385 North Arrowhead Avenue in [[downtown San Bernardino]]]]

===Public safety===
The 1905 Charter created the San Bernardino Police Department and chief of police; before 1905, there was a position of city marshal. The current charter places the chief of police under the direction of the mayor.

The San Bernardino City Fire Department was founded in 1878 and dissolved on July 1, 2016 to be taken over by the San Bernardino County Fire District.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.san-bernardino.ca.us/depts/fire/stations.asp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305184545/http://www.ci.san-bernardino.ca.us/depts/fire/stations.asp |archivedate=March 5, 2007 |title=San Bernardino City Fire Department. ''Stations'' |publisher=Ci.san-bernardino.ca.us |accessdate=December 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charter Section 186 requires that the monthly salaries of police and fire local safety members be the average of like positions at ten comparable cities in California.&lt;ref&gt;City of San Bernardino, Charter section 186, San Bernardino Municipal Code section 1.28.020&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, if the average goes up in other cities, the compensation of the local safety employees automatically rises.

Over 90 percent of local police officers do not live within the city limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackvoicenews.com/commentary/hardy-l-brown/40592-editorials-by-hardy-brown.html |title=Brinker, Derry, Kelley &amp; McCammack 'Wrapped Up, Tied Up, Tangled Up' .  . .

Recent police efforts include joint patrols with the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department and the [[California Highway Patrol]]. As of November 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.san-bernardino.ca.us/civica/filebank/blobdload.asp?BlobID=3580 |title=November 2006 Part 1 Crime in San Bernardino |accessdate=December 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part 1 Crime (Murders, Rape, Robbery, Assault, Burglary and Theft) was down 14.07 percent from 2005.

San Bernardino has long battled high crime rates. According to statistics published by [[Morgan Quitno]], San Bernardino was the 16th most dangerous US city in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.morganquitno.com/cit05pop.htm |title=Morgan Quitno. 2005 city crime statistics |publisher=Morganquitno.com |accessdate=December 10, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111225033434/http://www.morganquitno.com/cit05pop.htm |archivedate=December 25, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 18th in 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comunidadesegura.org/?q=en/node/30265 |title=Comunidad Segura.

==Media==
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2010}}
San Bernardino is part of the Los Angeles Nielsen area. As such, most its residents receive the same local television and radio stations as residents of Los Angeles. [[KVCR-DT]], a PBS affiliate operated by the San Bernardino Community College District, is the only local San Bernardino television station. [[KPXN]], the Los Angeles Ion Television network affiliate, is licensed to San Bernardino, but contains no local content. Most of the northern section of San Bernardino cannot receive over-the-air [[Broadcasting|television broadcasts]] from Los Angeles because [[Mount San Antonio|Mount Baldy]], and other San Gabriel Mountain peaks, block transmissions from [[Mount Wilson (California)|Mount Wilson]]. Since the 1960s, most North San Bernardino residents have required cable television to obtain television. Today, the city has one main cable franchise: the city has [[Charter Communications]]. Mountain Shadow Cable is a small local company that provides services to the eponymous mobile home park. DBS satellite also has a presence. Local programming is handled by the city's [[Public, educational, and government access]] (PEG) cable TV channel KCSB-TV.

Historically, San Bernardino has had a number of newspapers. Today, the ''[[San Bernardino Sun]]'', founded in 1894 (but was the continuation of an earlier paper) publishes in North San Bernardino, and has a circulation area roughly from Yucaipa to Fontana, including the mountain communities. Many older residents refer to the Sun as the Sun-Telegram, its name when it merged with the afternoon Telegram in the 1960s. The Precinct Reporter has been publishing weekly since 1965, primarily serving African American residents. Its circulation also includes Riverside County and Pomona Valley. There is also the ''Black Voice News'' that previously served Riverside has been in the area over 30 years and has more recently served African Americans that live in the community. Another local newspaper centered mostly around the African American community is the ''Westside Story Newspaper'', established in 1987. Their coverage area extends to the greater area of [[San Bernardino County]]. They currently operate locally and online.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} The ''Inland Catholic Byte'' is the newspaper of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of San Bernardino]]. The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' is also widely circulated.

The [[Inland Empire (California)|Inland Empire]] also has its own Arbitron area. Therefore, there are several radio stations that broadcast in San Bernardino or other Inland Empire cities. These include top 40 station [[KHTI]], country music station [[KFRG]], [[NPR]] member station [[KVCR (FM)|KVCR]] and news/talk/music station KCAA 1050 AM, with studios in the Carousel Mall. Other than government or media outlets, there is no major internet site made for the Inland Empire.

'''''Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference v. Federal Power Commission''''', 354 [[F.2d]] 608 ([[2d Cir.]] 1965) is a United States [[Second Circuit Court of Appeals]] case in which a public group of citizens, the [[Scenic Hudson|Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference]], organized and initiated legal action after the [[Federal Power Commission]] approved plans for [[Consolidated Edison]] to construct a power plant on [[Storm King Mountain (New York)|Storm King Mountain]], [[New York (state)|New York]].  The Federal regulatory agency had denied that the environmental group could bring action, but the court disagreed, ruling that Scenic Hudson had [[standing (law)|legal standing]] because of their "special interest in [[aesthetic]], [[conservation movement|conservational]], and [[recreational]] aspects" of the mountain.&lt;ref name="resource1"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference v.

{{quote|In order to insure that the Federal Power Commission will adequately protect the public interest in the aesthetic, conservational, and recreational aspects of power development, those who by their activities and conduct have exhibited a special interest in such areas must be held to be included in the class of 'aggrieved' parties under s. 313 (b).

Hays]]|in the court's decision for {{noitalic|Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference v. Federal Power Commission}}&lt;ref name=resource1 /&gt;&lt;!--p. 616--&gt;}}

This was the first decision of a court to grant standing on such terms, and established a precedent to allow similar public-based environmental groups to engage in legal processes. As Justice Hays stated, "the cost of a project is only one of several factors to be considered" in addition to "the preservation of natural beauty and national historic sites" as a basic concern.&lt;ref name="resource1"/&gt; This 1965 ruling helped to establish the legitimacy of environmental issues and paved the way for lawyers and the courts to play a significant role in all manner of land-use and environmental battles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrdc.org/legislation/helaw.asp |title=E-law: What Started It All? |publisher=NRDC |accessdate=2013-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lifset|first1=Robert|title=Power on the Hudson: Storm King Mountain And The Emergence of Modern American Environmentalism|date=August 5, 2014|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|location=Pittsburgh|isbn=978-0822963059|pages=328|edition=1st|url=https://www.amazon.com/Power-Hudson-Emergence-Environmentalism-Pittsburgh/dp/0822963051/ref=tmm_pap_title_0?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1416242801&amp;sr=8-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Storm King from across Hudson.jpg|thumbnail|left|Storm King from the [[Breakneck Ridge (Metro-North station)|Breakneck Ridge]] train station across the Hudson]]

This case is part of a 17-year (1963–1982) dispute. In 1963 [[Consolidated Edison]] announced plans to build a hydroelectric power plant on [[Storm King Mountain (New York)|Storm King Mountain]]. In response to the proposal, citizens formed the [[Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference]] to provide a stronger unified voice against the project.&lt;ref name="SHPC"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.scenichudson.org/about/history | title=Our History | publisher=Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference | accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite their opposition, the Federal Power Commission granted Consolidated Edison the right to proceed. The Commission's decision was immediately [[appealed]] and the matter was sent to the [[Second Circuit Court of Appeals]]. The [[#Judicial_timeline|timeline below]] provides a more thorough context of the different cases and significant decisions.

==Legal framework==

===Parties involved===
Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference was a collection of concerned citizens and local fishermen. The cities of [[Philipstown, New York|Phillipstown]], [[Putnam Valley]], [[Cortland County, New York|Cortland]], and [[Yorktown, New York|Yorktown]] are all located in the vicinity of [[Storm King Mountain (New York)|Storm King Mountain]] and wanted to halt development.

Several towns joined Scenic Hudson as [[plaintiffs]]. The towns were located along the [[Hudson River]] within the vicinity of Storm King. These surrounding local governments felt as though the development of the storage facility along with the additional transmission lines would adversely affect them.

[[Consolidated Edison]] was, and as of 2013 still is, a large investor-owned utility in New York. With populations growing in New York, Consolidated Edison was seeking a reliable source of energy to meet the needs of the population.

===Appeals court===
This case was tried in the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals, 2nd Circuit]]. It was argued on October 8, 1965 and decided on December 29, 1965. The case was remanded to lower courts. The case was presented before Chief Judge [[J. Edward Lumbard]] and Circuit Judges [[Sterry R. Waterman]] and Hays. The decision was written by Justice Hays.

===Issues===
The main issue presented in this case is whether aesthetic harm can suffice as an [[injury-in-fact]] in order to establish standing. The "injury in fact" test requires both an "injury to a cognizable interest" and that "the party seeking review be himself among the injured."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife |vol=504 |reporter=U.S. |opinion=555 |pinpoint=563 |court=[[SCOTUS|U.S.]] |date=1992 |url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10150124802357408838 |accessdate=23 October 2014 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Storm King project was to be located in an area of unique beauty and major historical significance. The highlands and gorge of the Hudson offer one of the finest pieces of river scenery in the world. The great [[Baedeker|German traveler Baedeker]] called it "finer than the Rhine." Petitioners' contention that the Commission must take these factors into consideration in evaluating the Storm King project is justified by the history of the [[Federal Power Act]]. Prior to this case, aesthetics were not considered worthy of standing in court. Environmental groups had to demonstrate a harm to a person or people (typically economic harm) before they could be allowed to challenge development in court and be heard.

The [[New York Court of Appeals]] set aside the Storm King license and [[remanded]] to the Federal Power Commission in a decision marking the birth of environmental law. The court stated that "The Commission's renewed proceedings must include as a basic concern the preservation of natural beauty and national historic sites, keeping in mind that in our affluent society, the cost of a project is only one of several factors to be considered." In addition, the court ruled that "On remand, the Commission should take the whole fisheries question into consideration before deciding whether the Storm King Project is to be licensed."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1965"&gt;Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference v. Federal Power Commission, 354 F. 2d 608 (2d Cir. 1965), cert. denied. Sub nom. Consolidated Edison v. Hudson River Preservation Conference, 384 U.S. 941 (1966).&lt;/ref&gt;

This also helped to establish some of the largest environmental organizations today. See "[[#Catalyst_for_other_action|Catalyst for other action]]," below.

== Opinion of the Court ==
Presented by Justice Hays on behalf of Chief Justice Lumbard and Justice Waterman.

=== Standing ===
{{US fed civ pro}}
In [[United States law]], the [[Supreme Court of the United States of America|Supreme Court of the United States]] has stated, "In essence the question of standing is whether the [[litigant]] is entitled to have the court decide the merits of the dispute or of particular issues."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=[[Warth v. Seldin]] |vol=422 |reporter=U.S. |opinion=490 |pinpoint=498 |court=[[SCOTUS|U.S.]] |date=1975 |url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1789581117125093979 |accessdate=23 October 2014 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This case was significant because the court decided the Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference was an "[http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/aggrieved+party aggrieved party]" under § 313(a) of the Federal Power Act and thus "has standing to challenge the Commission's order."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1965"/&gt; They were determined to be an "aggrieved party" because of their "special interest in aesthetic, conservational, and recreational aspects of power development."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1965"/&gt;

This was the first example of granting standing on the basis of aesthetic or environmental benefits.

=== Commission ===
The [[Second Circuit Court of Appeals]] held the following:

* Commission violated requirements of §10(a) and §313(b) of [[Federal Power Act]] by failing to compile record adequate to support its findings and by failing to consider alternatives to the proposed project, including no project at all. 
* Commission failed to weigh adequately the need to preserve an area of unique beauty and major historical significance for "recreational purposes" as expressly mandated by Act. 
* Commission illegally failed to consider such alternatives as a [[gas turbine]] system, an interconnection with other systems, or a combination of the two. 
* Commission illegally failed to consider the possibility that no device could adequately protect fish and fish larvae in the project area and further failed to consider the desirability of running segments of the transmission lines underground.

==Remand==
The licensing order of March 9 and the two orders of May 6 were set aside, and the case was remanded for further [[Federal Power Commission]] hearings.

== Judicial timeline ==
The Storm King Decision incorporates 15 years of legal challenges, beginning with the first case in 1965. Below is the timeline:

* '''1963''': Initial proposal for Storm King plant is developed, Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference established
* '''1964''': Federal Power Commission (FPC) holds hearings on the proposed plant. They grant Consolidated Edison the license to build plant
* '''1965''': First case: Consolidated Edison Vs. Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference, Towns of Phillipsville, Putnam Valley, Cortland. Court remands case to lower court and acknowledges the aesthetic and historical importance of Storm King Mountain and grants standing to a citizen environmental group. 
* '''1966–1967''': The remanded FPC hearings take place. There are over 19,000 pages of testimony. Many additional environmental studies are presented including studies showing the predicted number of fish kills from the plant. 
* '''1968''': Almost one year after the hearings ended, the FPC recommends that the license be granted for the Storm King Project. 
* '''1968–1970''': Alternative sites and routes are examined by FPC. They determined that the alternate site is a major hazard to the [[New York City]] aqueduct. This eliminates the possibility of the alternate location. The FPC again examines the potential of the Storm King Mountain Site. In August 1970 the FPC re-licensed Storm King. 
* '''1971''': Scenic Hudson, the Hudson River Fisherman's Association (now [[Riverkeeper]]), The City of New York, the [[Palisades Interstate Park Commission|Palisades Park Commission]] and others appealed the Federal Power Commission decision. The Court upholds the FPC licensing decision in a two-to-one vote. The court later split four-to-four on reconsideration. (453 F. 2d 463 (2d Cir. 1971), cert. denied 407 U.S. 926 (1972)).
* '''1973''': Once again, Scenic Hudson and the Hudson River Fisherman's Association petitioned the Federal Power Commission to reconsider the Storm King license. They allege that the fish studies used in the 1970 license granting were inaccurate. The study did not consider that the Hudson is a tidal river and therefore underestimated impact to certain fish. The Federal Power Commission later rejected the Scenic Hudson and Hudson River Fisherman's Association Petitions. (49 FPC 1227 (1973)).
* '''1973''': Scenic Hudson and Hudson River Fisherman's Association bring suit against the [https://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/499/499.F2d.127.74-1421.74-1311.1028.1092.html/ US Army Corps of Engineers] in federal district court to stop Consolidated Edison from dumping rock excavated from the Storm King project into the Hudson River. They argued that a  Corps of Engineers permit was required. Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference v. Callaway, 370 F. Supp. 162 (S.D.N.Y. 1973), aff'd 499 f.2d 127 (2d Cir. 1974).
* '''1976''': NY City Attorney General and some FPC staff join Scenic Hudson and Hudson River Fisherman's Association in petitioning the Federal Power Commission to restart hearings on the Storm King license. This time they include economics in the argument along with changed circumstances and environmental concerns. 
* '''1980''': Scenic Hudson and Consolidated Edison reached a settlement in the Storm King case. Consolidated Edison agreed to terminate the Storm King plans, reduce fish kills at some of its power plants on the Hudson. They also established a research fund for the Hudson River. The surrender was approved by [https://www.ferc.gov/ Federal Energy Regulatory Commission] (FERC) in 1981.

== Catalyst for other action ==
The Court's decision to grant standing to the Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference, a conservation group with local members, established an important legal precedence for similar groups to be able to take legal action to protect the public interest. This case has been attributed as the birth of [[environmental law]], which is now so firmly established, it is taught as a separate branch of legal studies at most law schools today.

=== Related cases ===
This case sets a precedent for "attainment of standing to sue than for [[justiciability]] of aesthetic issues on their merits." &lt;ref name="Smardon1979"&gt;{{cite conference | url=http://www.fs.fed.us/psw/publications/documents/psw_gtr035/psw_gtr035_16_smardon.pdf | title=The interface of legal and esthetic considerations | accessdate=22 October 2014 | author=Smardon, R.C. | booktitle=Proceedings of Our National Landscape |date=April 1979  | conference=National Conference on Applied Techniques for Analysis and Management of the Visual Resources | location=Incline Village, Nevada | pages=676–685}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within each case, it is important that aesthetic conditions be specifically mentioned within the applicable statutes.

However, the Sierra Club had failed to state in its complaint that any of its members had ever visited Mineral King, even though several members had used it for recreational purposes and even owned property in the nearby area, and so it lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Sierra Club v.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6079">The '''Servicemembers Civil Relief Act''' (formerly called the '''Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act''') (codified at [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/chapter-50 50 U.S.C. §§ 3901—4043]) is a [[United States federal law]] that protects [[soldier]]s, [[sailor]]s, [[airman|airmen]], [[Marine (armed services)|marines]], coast guardsmen, commissioned officers in the Public Health Service and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Landlord-Tenant Law and The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA)|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/military-law/landlord-tenant-law-and-servicemembers-civil-relief-act-scra|website=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=4 April 2018|date=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; from being sued while in active military service of their country and for up to a year after active duty, as well as U.S. citizens serving with allied military forces for the duration of a military conflict involving the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA)|url=https://www.justice.gov/servicemembers/servicemembers-civil-relief-act-scra|website=U.S. Department of Justice|accessdate=4 April 2018|date=23 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Despite the act's official title dating it to 1940, its origins can be traced as far back as the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] when the [[United States Congress]] passed a total moratorium on [[civil action]]s brought against [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] soldiers and sailors.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mason|first1=R. Chuck|title=The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA):  An Explanation|url=https://www.justice.gov/crt-military/file/797396/download|website=U.S. Department of Justice|publisher=Congressional Research Service|accessdate=4 April 2018|date=27 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In basic terms, this meant that any legal action involving a civil matter was put on hold until after the soldier or sailor returned from the war. Examples of civil matters included [[breach of contract]], [[bankruptcy]], [[foreclosure]] or [[divorce]] proceedings.

Congress' intent in passing the moratorium was to protect both national interests and those of servicemembers. First, Congress wanted servicemembers to be able to fight the war without having to worry about problems that might arise at home. Secondly, because most soldiers and sailors during the Civil War were not well paid, it was difficult for them to honor their pre-service debts, such as [[Mortgage loan|mortgage]] payments or other credit.

Congressional concern about protecting the rights of servicemembers was raised again during [[World War I]] when the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1918 was passed. Like the Civil War-era moratorium, the 1918 legislation was designed to protect the rights of service members while they were serving in the war. Although the 1918 Act did not include a total moratorium on civil actions, it did protect service members from such things as repossession of property, bankruptcy, foreclosure or other such actions while they were in harm's way.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; The 1918 Act stayed in effect until shortly after World War I, when it expired.

The present-day statute, essentially a reenactment of the 1918 law, was passed in 1940 to protect the rights of the millions of service members activated for [[World War II]]. The major difference between it and the 1918 version, other than minor modifications, was there was no provision for the act to expire, as it did after World War I. Thus, since 1940, service members have received uninterrupted coverage under the act. And indeed, congressional commitment and support for the act has remained so strong, the act has been amended more than 12 times since 1940 to keep pace with a changing [[military]] and a changing world, with the last amendments added, in 2003, through the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act.

==Provisions==
Courts will generally require litigants to provide proof that an individual is not on active duty before adverse action is taken, i.e. foreclosures, garnishments, attachments, evictions, and judgements. It is important to note that the benefits conferred upon servicemembers extend after active duty.  Verification of active military duty may be achieved on-line via the [[Defense Manpower Data Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coyne|first1=Kristen M.H.|last2=Myers|first2=Darren|last3=Witting|first3=Susan H.|title=The SCRA and Family Law: More Than Just Stays and Delays|journal=Family Law Quarterly|date=2009|volume=43|issue=2|pages=315–348|jstor=25740704}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burda|first=Joan M.|date=2005|title=Collecting from Personnel Called to Active Duty|jstor=23672947|journal=GPSolo|volume=22|issue=1|pages=40–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The act also specifically states that servicemembers and their spouses do not gain or lose a [[Domicile (law)|domicile]] based on their presence or lack thereof in any U.S. jurisdiction solely on the basis of military orders. Section 571 outlines this concept for purposes of taxation, and Section 596 for voting purposes.

A '''constitutional referendum''' was held in [[Seychelles]] on 18 June 1993, following the failure of a [[Seychellois constitutional referendum, 1992|referendum]] the previous year to pass the 60% threshold required. After the new constitution had been redrafted, it was put to a public vote for a second time, receiving the approval of 73.6% of voters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://africanelections.tripod.com/sc.html Elections in the Seychelles] African Elections Database&lt;/ref&gt;

It also establishes specific requirements in order to encourage shareholder engagement, in particular in the long term.&lt;ref&gt;Article 1, paragraph 1 of amended directive, as amended by http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32017L0828&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shareholder Rights Directive 2007 replaced the First Company Law Directive [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31968L0151:en:NOT 68/151/EEC]. It set out minimum requirements relating to the holding of meetings in the EU. The directive was amended and largely extended by Directive 2017/828/EU of 17 May 2017 as regards the encouragement of long-term shareholder engagement.
 
==Contents==
The directive's structure is as follows:
*Chapter Ia. Identification of shareholders, transmission of information, facilitation of exercise of shareholders rights 
*Chapter Ib. Transparency of institutional investors, asset managers and proxy advisors
*Chapter II on General meetings of shareholders including the remuneration of directors and related party transactions:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3779">The right to a '''speedy trial''' is a [[human right]] under which it is asserted that a government prosecutor may not delay the trial of a criminal suspect arbitrarily and indefinitely. Otherwise, the power to impose such delays would effectively allow prosecutors to send anyone to jail for an arbitrary length of time without trial.

Although it is important for the protection of speedy trial rights that there be a court in which a defendant may complain about the unreasonable delay of the trial, it is also important that nations implement structures that avoid the delay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title = Equa durata del processo: il risarcimento non risolve il problema |journal= Diritto&amp;Giustizia edizione online |date=2000| url=  https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89306900}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition of speedy trial rights==
In jurisdictions with strong [[rule of law]], the requirement of a "speedy trial" forces prosecutors to diligently build cases within a reasonable amount of time commensurate with the complexity and heinousness of the crimes of which suspects are accused. The right is based on the notion that long-term incarceration should normally be restricted to situations in which a judge or jury have determined a suspect has committed a crime.

The right to a speedy trial is codified in fundamental legal documents in several jurisdictions, and may be further defined by statutory law.

===Canada===
Speedy trial rights are recognized within [[Section Eleven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]].

===Europe===

Within Europe, speedy trial rights are recognized by [[Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights]].

In English law, this right was developed by the [[Assize of Clarendon]] in 1166 (a judge would be summoned if one was not immediately available) and [[Magna Carta]] in 1215 ("To no one will we sell, to no one will we refuse or delay, right or justice.").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shestokas|first1=David J.|title=Sixth Amendment’s Speedy Trial Right: Ancient, Worthy and Elusive|url=http://www.shestokas.com/constitution-educational-series/sixth-amendments-speedy-trial-right-ancient-worthy-and-elusive/|website=David Shestokas|accessdate=28 September 2017|date=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philippines===
The [[Constitution of the Philippines]] states, "All persons shall have the right to a speedy disposition of their cases before all judicial, [[quasi-judicial body|quasi-judicial]], or administrative bodies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Constitution of the Philippines, Article III|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_Philippines_(1987)#Article_III:_Bill_of_Rights|website=Wikisource|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the United States, basic speedy trial rights are protected by the [[Speedy Trial Clause]] of the United States Constitution. States may also offer additional speedy trial protections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What are Speedy Trial Rights|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/criminal-law/what-are-speedy-trial-rights|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1776, a "speedy trial" provision was explicitly included in the [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]] by [[George Mason]], its principal author.

The consequences of a speedy trial violation may require that the case be dismissed, although depending upon the circumstances it may be possible for the state to again initiate a criminal charge against a defendant despite a speedy trial violation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5016">[[File:SoSchiff Ansicht.jpg|thumb|Sun Ship in [[Freiburg]]]]

The '''Sun Ship''' is a large integrated office/retail building designed by architect [[Rolf Disch]] and located in [[Freiburg]] directly next to the [[Solar Settlement]] by the same designer. It uses 60,000 sq. ft. for retail, commercial and residential space.

As a whole this building produces more energy than it consumes per year and utilizes the most up-to-date building technology. Some aspects that make this building particular are its [[vacuum]] insulated walls, [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] with 95% heat recovery, triple paned windows and its energy [[façade]].

It is the first positive energy office building worldwide.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} The office spaces are flanked on both the East and West sides entirely with windows, which maximizes natural lighting and employee views while it minimizes the energy used for artificial lighting.

The Sun Ship includes a supermarket, convenience store and bakery-café on the first floor, offices and work spaces on the 2-4 floors and 9 penthouses on its roof. In addition to the office and retail space, there are two conference rooms.

==PlusEnergy==
[[PlusEnergy]] is a term coined by Rolf Disch that indicates a structure’s extreme [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] so that it holds a positive energy balance, actually producing more energy than it uses. With the completion of his private residence, the [[Heliotrope (building)|Heliotrope]], in 1994, Disch had created the first PlusEnergy house. His next goal in its development was thus the mass application of the concept to residential, commercial and retail space.  As the concept further developed and gained financial backing as well, Disch built several more projects with PlusEnergy certifications. “PlusEnergy is a fundamental environmental imperative,” Disch claims.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rolfdisch.de&lt;/ref&gt;  Disch believes that passive building is not enough because passive homes still emit CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into the [[atmosphere]].

===Community planning===
Believing community planning goes hand in hand with sustainable development, Disch dedicates much of his design and planning to the symbiosis of his projects' surroundings.  A solar community generates identification and an enormous public image. Disch says he attracts great tenants, innovative undertakings and creative work places through his design.
Disch always aims to create a community with combined uses for an ecological urban planning concept like traffic management – with wide, attractive walkways, bike routes and connections to public transportation.  At the Solar Settlement for example, tenants and owners incorporate bike- and carsharing and the neighborhood has an extensive car-free zone with many public transportation connections.  Disch also has incorporated community solutions for energy.  For example, a biomass co-generation unit is extremely expedient, which meets the (reduced) additional heating demands for his PlusEnergy homes.

'''''Dou E Yuan''''', commonly translated as '''''The Injustice to Dou E''''', and also known as '''''Snow in Midsummer''''', is a Chinese play written by [[Guan Hanqing]] (c. 1241–1320) during the [[Yuan dynasty]]. The full Chinese title of the play is '''''Gan Tian Dong Di Dou E Yuan''''', which roughly translates to ''The Injustice to Dou E that Touched Heaven and Earth''. The story follows a child bride turned widow, Dou E, who is wrongly convicted of crimes by a corrupt court official for actions perpetrated by a rejected suitor, Mule Zhang. After her execution, three prophesied phenomena occur to prove her innocence, including blood raining from the sky, snow in June and a three-year drought. After a visit from the ghost of Dou E, her father eventually brings the corrupt court official, a doctor and Mule Zhang to justice, thereby vindicating his daughter. Today, the phrase "snowing in June" is still widely used among Chinese speakers as a metaphor for a miscarriage of justice. The story was repeatedly used and modified by later dramatists and remains one of Guan's most popular works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Encyclopaedia of Translation: Chinese-English, English-Chinese |author=Chan, Sin-Wai and David E. Pollard |publisher=Chinese University Press |year=2001 |page=178 |isbn=9789622019973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==

===Prologue===
Dou Duanyun, a young maiden from Chuzhou (楚州; present-day [[Huai'an District]], [[Huai'an]], [[Jiangsu]]), is sold to the Cai family as a [[Tongyangxi|child bride]] because her father, Dou Tianzhang, owed people a lot of money and could not repay his debts. She is renamed 'Dou E'.

===Act 1===
Dou E's husband died two years after their marriage, leaving behind Dou E and her mother-in-law to depend on each other. Dou E and her mother-in-law are bullied by Sai Lu Yi, an unscrupulous physician. Sai Lu Yi almost kills Dou's mother-in-law by strangling her. Dou E and her mother-in-law are saved by the hooligan Zhang Lü'er and his father. Zhang pretends to offer them "protection" and moves into their house against their will, and then tries to force Dou E to marry him but she refuses.

===Act 2===
Dou E's mother-in-law has a sudden craving for soup. Zhang Lü'er plots to murder Dou E's mother-in-law so that he can seize Dou E for himself after the older woman dies. He blackmails Sai Lu Yi for poison by threatening to report the physician to the authorities for his earlier attempt to murder Dou E's mother-in-law. He puts the poison in the soup and hopes that Dou E's mother-in-law will drink it and die. However, Zhang's father drinks the soup instead and dies from poisoning. Zhang Lü'er then frames Dou E for murdering his father.

Dou E is arrested and brought before the prefecture governor, Tao Wu, who subjects her to various tortures to force her to confess to the crime. Dou E does not want her mother-in-law to be implicated so she admits to the murder. Tao Wu sentences her to death by beheading.

===Act 3===
Dou E is brought to the execution ground. Before her execution, she swears that her innocence will be proven if the following three events occur after she dies:

* Her blood will spill on her clothes but will not drip onto the ground.
* There will be heavy snowfall in the sixth [[lunar month]] (in the midst of summer) and the thick snow will cover her dead body.
* Chuzhou will experience a drought for three years.

The three events happened after Dou E's death.

===Act 4===
Three years later, Dou E's ghost appears before her father, Dou Tianzhang, who has become a ''lianfangshi'' (廉訪使; a senior government official) in the [[Anhui]] and [[Jiangsu]] region, and tells him all her grievances. Dou Tianzhang orders a reinvestigation of the case and the truth finally comes to light. Dou E is posthumously proclaimed innocent while the guilty parties receive their due punishments: Sai Lu Yi is exiled to a distant land; Tao Wu is dismissed and barred from entering office again; Zhang Lü'er is given the death penalty.

Dou E also wishes that her father can allow her mother-in-law to live with him, and that he will help to take care of her mother-in-law. Dou E's father agrees. The play ends here.

==Main characters==
* '''Dou E''' (竇娥), the main character, originally named Dou Duanyun (竇端雲).
* '''Dou Tianzhang''' (竇天章), Dou E's father.
* Dou E's mother-in-law, referred to as '''Granny Cai''' (蔡婆) in the play.
* '''Zhang Lü'er''' (張驢兒; literally "Zhang the mule" or "Zhang the donkey"), the man responsible for Dou E's plight.
* Zhang Lü'er's father, referred to as '''Zhang's father''' (張父) in the play.
* '''Sai Lu Yi''' (賽盧醫; literally "equivalent to the Physician from Lu"), the physician who provided the poison that killed Zhang Lü'er's father. "Physician from Lu" (盧醫) is the nickname of [[Bian Que]], a famous physician in ancient China. [[Guan Hanqing]] was probably adding a touch of satire or irony when he named this character.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}
* '''Tao Wu''' (桃杌), the prefecture governor who sentenced Dou E to death.

==Problems of text and translation==
The scholar [[Stephen H. West]] notes that the texts of Yuan drama were edited and "extensively altered" by [[Zang Maoxun]] (1550–1620), whose ''Yuanqu xuan'' (元曲選) became the standard anthology. Zang rationalised both the language and the format of the plays he edited, rather than the "coarser and more rugged – sometimes ragged – registers of language found in the early commercial editions of Yuan drama."{{sfnb|West|1991|p=283}}

Almost all English translations before those in the anthology by West and Idema were based on Zang's recensions. [[David Rolston]] remarks that "West and Idema are clearly very interested in the levels of language in the plays they translate (their translations do not shy from highlighting the rawer or racier elements of plays in ways generally ignored or suppressed by other translators)." Their translations, he says, will be more useful to those who are interested in the history of the theater and the plays, while the emphasis on readability in translations based on Zang's texts, such as that by George Kao in the ''Columbia Anthology'', will be more appealing to general readers.{{sfnb|Rolston|2015|p=663}}

==Adaptations==
===Chinese opera===
The play has been adapted into [[kunqu]]&lt;ref&gt;Chinese Kunqu Opera – Page 18 Xiao Li – 2005 'Dou E Yuan (the Injustice to Dou E)', performed by the Jiangsu kunqu Opera Theater.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[zaju]], as well as a 1956 [[Cantonese opera]], ''The Summer Snow'', by [[librettist]] [[Tang Ti-sheng]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/CE/CulturalService/Programme/misc/pdf/Snow_in_June.pdf pdf] Full libretto in Chinese translated to English for reference only.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern versions include the co-composition of [[Chen Zi]] and [[Du Yu (composer)|Du Yu]] in the 1960s, and Taiwanese composer [[Ma Shui-Long]]'s 1990 version.&lt;ref&gt;A Critical History of New Music in China – Page 554 C. C. Liu – 2010 His 1990 composition Dou E yuan [Snow in summer] (see Example 2) employed recitation in the singing style of Peking opera, accompanied by voices, suona and percussion, and was described by critics as “both modern and Chinese.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theatre===
A contemporary reimagining of the play was staged in 2017 by the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]]. The play was directed by Justin Audibert and specially adapted/translated by Frances Ya-Chu Cowhig.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rsc.org.uk/snow-in-midsummer/about-the-play|title=About the play {{!}} Snow in Midsummer {{!}} Royal Shakespeare Company|website=www.rsc.org.uk|access-date=2017-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It premiered in the US at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;Oregon Shakespeare Festival Playbill 2018 Volume 2&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thomas Bardolf, 5th Baron Bardolf''' (born prior to 1390-died 19 February 1408) was a baron in the [[Peerage of England]], Lord of [[Wormegay]], [[Norfolk]], of [[Shelford, Nottinghamshire|Shelford]] and [[Stoke Bardolph]] in [[Nottinghamshire]], [[Hallaton]] (Hallughton), [[Leicestershire]], and others, and was "a person of especial eminence in his time".&lt;ref&gt;Banks, T.C., ''The Dormant &amp; Extinct Baronage of England &amp;c., from the Norman Conquest to the year 1806'', London, 1808, vol II: 28&lt;/ref&gt; 

He was an [[armiger]], his [[Coat of arms|Arms]] being: ''Azure, three cinquefoils, or''. A supporter of the rebellion of [[Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland]] against King [[Henry IV of England]] after the death of Percy's son [[Henry Percy (Hotspur)|Harry Hotspur]], he died from wounds received at the [[Battle of Bramham Moor]].

==Life==
The eldest son of [[William 4th Lord Bardolf]], Knight, of Wormegay, Thomas Bardolf de Wormegay, 5th [[Baron Bardolf]], was summoned to the [[Parliament of England]] from 12 September 1390 to 25 August 1404.

He took part with [[Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland]], and others, in their insurrection against King [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]], and being pursued by the Royal army in great force, was obliged to flee to France. But about three years after returning to [[England]], he resumed his alliance with the Earl of Northumberland, [[Thomas de Mowbray, 4th Earl of Norfolk|Thomas Mowbray (Earl Marshall)]], and [[Richard le Scrope]], [[Archbishop of York]], only to be defeated again in Yorkshire by [[John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford|John of Lancaster]] and [[Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland|the Earl of Westmorland]]. The king ordered the execution of Mowbray and Scrope, who were subsequently beheaded at [[York]].

Finally, in 1408, at the [[Battle of Bramham Moor]], the rebels suffered a total defeat. Northumberland was slain, and Lord Bardolf "so much hurt" that he died of his wounds soon after.

Bardolf had married Avicia, daughter of [[Ralph de Cromwell, 2nd Baron Cromwell|Ralph de Cromwell]], 2nd [[Baron Cromwell]]. He left two daughters, Anne and Joan, his co-heirs. However, his honours and lands had already been forfeited to the Crown by [[attainder]].

==Aftermath==
[[William Dugdale]] states that "Lord Bardolf's remains were quartered, and the quarters disposed of by being placed above the gates of [[London]], [[York]], Lenne [possibly [[King's Lynn]]?], and [[Shrewsbury]], while the head was placed upon one of the gates of [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]]; his widow obtained permission, however, in a short time, to remove and bury them."

The estates were divided between [[Thomas Beaufort, 1st Duke of Exeter]] (the king's half-brother), Sir [[George de Dunbar, 10th Earl of March|George de Dunbar]], Knight, and [[Joan of Navarre, Queen of England]]; but the latter's proportion, upon the petition of Sir William Clifford, knt.,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Douglas Richardson|title=Plantagenet Ancestry|location=Baltimore, MD|date=2004|pages=215,223|ISBN= 0-8063-1750-7}} where it is assumed he is the son of [[Roger de Clifford, 5th Baron Clifford]], who was sheriff of both [[Westmorland|Westmoreland]] and [[Cumberland]] and governor of [[Carlisle Castle]].&lt;/ref&gt;  and his wife, Anne, and Sir [[William Phelip, 6th Lord Bardolf|William Phelip]] and his wife, Joan, to the king, was granted in reversion, after the Queen's decease, to those husband's of the attainted nobleman.

Also, on "27 April 1407. The King to the [[High Sheriff|sheriff]] of [[Lincolnshire|Lincoln]]. Referring to the late plea in [[Court of Chancery|Chancery]] between Amicia (sic) wife of Thomas, late lord of Bardolf, and George de Dunbarre regarding certain lands in Ruskynton forfeited by Thomas, which had been granted by the King to George, with the manor of Calthorpe, the half of Ancastre (and many others), wherein it was adjudged that Rusynton should be excepted from the grant and restored to her with the rents, etc., from 27 November 1405, drawn by George, - the King orders him to restore the same to Amicia.

'''''Universal Music Group v. Augusto''''' was a federal court case filed by [[Universal Music Group]] against Troy Augusto, a man who sold [[Promotional recording|promotional CDs]] on [[eBay]]. UMG claimed that the CDs were their property, and Augusto's sales constituted copyright infringement.  On January 4, 2011, the Ninth Circuit sided with Augusto, holding that "UMG's distribution of the promotional CDs under the circumstances effected a sale (transfer of title) of the CDs to the recipients. Further sale of those copies was therefore permissible without UMG's authorization."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2011/01/04/08-55998.pdf] on ca9.uscourts.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
UMG claimed that their promotional CDs marked "promotional use only" are their property for eternity and cannot be resold.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Augusto deceives potential eBay buyers by speciously claiming that he has the right, under [[U.S. copyright law]], to sell the "Promo CDs" under the "first sale doctrine" embodied in {{USC|17|109}}. (In fact, since "Promo CDs" are never sold, only licensed, that doctrine simply does not apply.)&lt;ref name="claim"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/files/filenode/umg_v_augusto/20070510_umg_complaint.pdf |title=UMG complaint for copyright infringement |accessdate=2008-04-11 |format=[[PDF]] |publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] stepped in on behalf of Augusto and claimed that Augusto has the right to resell the CDs under the [[first sale doctrine]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;Augusto admits that under {{USC|17|109}} he is entitled, without the authority of the copyright owner, to sell or otherwise dispose of the possession of CDs he owns, including the CDs at issue in this action. Augusto admits that the limitation on a copyright holder's distribution right set forth in {{USC|17|109}} is sometimes referred to as the "first sale doctrine." Augusto admits that he has cited {{USC|17|109}} from time to time in his auction descriptions. Augusto denies the remaining allegations in this paragraph.&lt;ref name="response"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/files/filenode/umg_v_augusto/20070806_augusto_answer.pdf |title=Troy Augusto's response |accessdate=2008-04-11 |format=[[PDF]] |publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Augusto argued that he owned title to the CD copies he sold under three theories.
# The printed licenses on the promo CDs were invalid
# The original recipients were allowed to treat the CDs as a gift according to federal law
# The CDs were abandoned by UMG according to California law
If any one of these were upheld by the court, Augusto would win. The court supported both 1 and 2 but rejected 3, and thus ruled that UMG transferred title of the CDs to the original recipients. Therefore, Augusto was the owner of the CDs when he sold them and was not violating UMG's rights.

Augusto had also counter-sued UMG for the obstruction of his business.

==Ruling==
In a court order issued June 10, 2008, the [[United States District Court for the Central District of California]] established that the [[first sale doctrine]] is indeed valid in this case. The court rejected the counter-suit claim, finding that UMG acted in good faith when claiming their copyright.

Augusto appealed this decision to the [[Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]],&lt;ref name="appeal"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/files/filenode/umg_v_augusto/Appellee%27s%20Brief.pdf |title=Augusto appeal brief |accessdate=2009-05-22 |format=[[PDF]] |publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; which affirmed the decision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2011/01/04/08-55998.pdf] on ca9.uscourts.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36937">'''United States virtual currency law''' is [[financial regulation]] as applied to transactions in [[virtual currency]] in the U.S. The [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]] has regulated and may continue to regulate virtual currencies as commodities.&lt;ref name="cftcA"&gt;{{cite news|title=Virtual currencies are commodities, US judge rules|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/07/cryptocurrencies-like-bitcoin-are-commodities-us-judge-rules.html|accessdate=March 11, 2018|agency=[[Reuters]]|publisher=CNBC|date=March 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cftcB"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clinch|first1=Matt|title=Bitcoin now classed as a commodity in the US|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2015/09/18/bitcoin-now-classed-as-a-commodity-in-the-us.html|accessdate=March 11, 2018|agency=Reuters|publisher=CNBC|date=September 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] also requires registration of any virtual currency traded in the U.S. if it is classified as a ''[[security (finance)|security]]'' and of any trading platform that meets its definition of an [[Exchange (organized market)|exchange]].&lt;ref name="secA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement on Potentially Unlawful Online Platforms for Trading Digital Assets|url=https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/enforcement-tm-statement-potentially-unlawful-online-platforms-trading|website=U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|accessdate=March 11, 2018|date=March 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The regulatory structure also includes [[Taxation in the United States|tax regulations]] and [[Financial Crimes Enforcement Network|FINCEN]] transparency regulations between [[Digital currency exchanger|financial exchanges]] and the individuals and [[corporation]]s with whom they conduct business.

==The regulatory and market environment==
The [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) describes Virtual Currencies (VCs) as "a digital representation of value that functions as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and/or a store of value [and] does not have [[legal tender]] status in any jurisdiction." &lt;ref name="irs"&gt;Internal Revenue Service, Notice 2014-21, [https://www.irs.gov/uac/Newsroom/IRS-Virtual-Currency-Guidance IRS Virtual Currency Guidance: Virtual Currency Is Treated as Property for U.S. Federal Tax Purposes; General Rules for Property Transactions Apply] (Mar. 25, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; Although, electronic payment systems have been part of American life since at least 1871 when [[Western Union]] "introduced money transfer" through the telegraph&lt;ref&gt;[http://corporate.westernunion.com/History.html "Our Rich History"], Western Union (Nov. 3, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1914 "introduced the first consumer charge-card", virtual currencies differ from these digital payment structures because unlike traditional digital transfers of value, virtual currencies do not represent a claim on value; rather the virtual currency are the value.

The [[National Automated Clearing House Association]] (NACHA), through the [[Automated Clearing House]] (ACH) moves almost $39 trillion and 22 billion electronic financial transactions each year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nacha.org/ach-network "ACH Network: How it Works"], ACHA (Nov. 30, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; These electronic transfers of money through the ACH Network represent a claim to physical legal tender.  Alternatively, "unlike electronic money, a VC, particularly in its decentralised variant, does not represent a claim on the issuer."&lt;ref name="eba"&gt;[http://www.eba.europa.eu/documents/10180/657547/EBA-Op-2014-08+Opinion+on+Virtual+Currencies.pdf "EBA Opinion on ‘virtual currencies’"], European Banking Authorit, (July 4, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

Electronic payment networks, such as the ACH, have decreased the costs and time required to transfer value and increased reliability and transparency. However, traditional electronic payment networks, even with transnational networks and satellite communications, differ from a virtual currency.  For example, the [[Bitcoin]] exchange [[Coinbase]] charges only 1% on all Bitcoin exchanges to legal tender.&lt;ref&gt;Payouts, Coinbase (Nov. 3, 2014). https://www.coinbase.com/docs/merchant_tools/payouts&lt;/ref&gt; Compare this to "2%-4% for traditional online payment systems, like PayPal and credit card companies,&lt;ref&gt;Roger Wu, [https://www.forbes.com/sites/groupthink/2014/02/13/why-we-accept-bitcoin "Why We Accept Bitcoin"], ''Forbes'' (Feb. 2, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; or a global average of 7.49% for remittance sent through major remittance corridors.&lt;ref&gt;Remittance Prices Worldwide, The World Bank (Issue n. 11, September 2014) https://remittanceprices.worldbank.org/sites/default/files/rpw_report_september_2014.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;  The lower costs of transferring value is a great incentive to both users and merchants. Faster transaction speed is also an advantage of using VC.&lt;ref name="eba"/&gt;  VC may also help to reduce identity theft because of the cryptographic nature of some of the currencies.&lt;ref&gt;Erika Morphy, [https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikamorphy/2013/12/31/with-bitcoin-in-your-pocket-is-your-identity-finally-safe "With Bitcoin In Your Pocket, Is Your Identity Finally Safe?"], ''Forbes'' (Dec. 31, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some experts predict various types of VCs will continue to increase, and the demand for the financial system to adopt methods of accepting these currencies will continue to grow.  In 2011, [[Microsoft]]'s Director of Corporate Affairs sent a letter to the [[Reserve Bank of Australia]] asking, "whether the domestic payments infrastructure could be modified or adjusted in some way to facilitate and manage the exchange of value beyond traditional currencies".&lt;ref&gt;Simon Edwards, Microsoft Letter to the Reserve Bank of Australia. (August 31, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;
The online sale of goods and services in the United States accounted for an annual total of $283billion transactions from the start of 3rd quarter 2013 to the end of 2nd quarter 2014 (adjusted for seasonal variation).&lt;ref&gt;Quarterly Retail E-commerce Sales, U.S. Census Bureau News (Nov. 9, 2014), https://www.census.gov/retail/mrts/www/data/pdf/ec_current.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  VCs are increasing as a percentage of these transactions.  The Bitcoin exchange company Coinbase offers a payment service that allows merchants to receive Bitcoin and then automatically exchange the Bitcoin into fiat currency.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.coinbase.com/legal/user_agreement Legal], Coinbase (Nov. 9, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;  The speed of this exchange helps merchants to avoid the volatility of Bitcoin. In September 2014, [[Ebay]] announced that its payment processor [[Braintree (company)|Braintree]] will be accepting Bitcoin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Ryan Mac | title=EBay Announces First Foray Into Bitcoin With Braintree Unit | publisher=Forbes | access-date=September 8, 2014 | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanmac/2014/09/08/ebay-announces-first-foray-into-bitcoin-with-braintree-unit/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of November 2014, the [[market capitalization]] of Bitcoin is just below $5 billion, but has reached historic highs close to $14 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://blockchain.info/charts/market-cap "Market Capitalization"], Blockchain (Nov. 9, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; The growth of Internet use and the virtual world is also increasing. World Internet use increased from 15.8% in 2005 to 38.1% in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Data, The World Bank (Nov. 9, 2014), http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IT.NET.USER.P2/&lt;/ref&gt;

This Internet growth is characterized by a consumer demand for a [[decentralization|decentralized]] Internet experience that is not limited or dependent on traditional institutions and governments.  This movement aims to create an Internet based on the idea of Virtual, Distributed Parallel (VDP) States, "acting as a kind of organizational counterpoint to that State's governing bodies".&lt;ref&gt;Amon Twyman, [http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/twyman20140427 "The Social Futurist policy toolkit"], Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies (April 27, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Crypto-currency]] and other virtual currencies are the VDP movements' currency alternative to traditional currency and traditional financial institutions.

==Monetary policy==
The current amount of VC use in the global market is unlikely to significantly affect the Federal Reserve's ability to conduct monetary policy; however, if the size of the VC market were to grow larger it may affect monetary policy.&lt;ref name="cfpb"&gt;[http://www.consumerfinance.gov/newsroom/cfpb-warns-consumers-about-bitcoin "CFPB Warns Consumers About Bitcoin"], Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Nov. 8, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;  Even with the impact VC could have on monetary policy, the Reserve does not have the authority to supervise or regulate VC.&lt;ref&gt;Dominic Rushe, [https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/feb/27/janet-yellen-federal-reserve-no-authority-regulate-bitcoin "Janet Yellen: Federal Reserve has no authority to regulate Bitcoin"], ''The Guardian'' (Feb. 27, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;
According to May 9, 2014 meeting of the Federal Advisory Council and Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, Bitcoin was deemed to "not present a threat to economic activity by disrupting traditional channels of commerce" but rather a potential "boon". Its global transmissibility opens new markets to merchants and service providers" and "capital flows from the developed to the developing world should increase".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/fac-20140513.pdf "Record of Meeting, Federal Advisory Council and Board of Governors"], Federal Reserve 11 (May 9, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; In its 2009 Report to Congress, the U.S. Treasury claimed that the dollar will continue to be a major [[reserve currency]] "as long as the United States maintains sound [[macroeconomic policies]] and deep, liquid, and open financial markets".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/international/exchange-rate-policies/Documents/FX%20Report%20FINAL%20October%2015%202009.pdf "Report to Congress on International Economic and Exchange Rate Policies"], U.S. Department of the Treasury Office of International Affairs 3, (Oct. 15, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to former [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] [[Chief Technology Officer|CTO]] Gus Hunt, the "Government's going to learn from Bitcoin, and all the official government currencies are going to become crypto currencies themselves".&lt;ref&gt;Mathew J. Schwartz, [http://www.darkreading.com/risk-management/bitcoin-meet-darwin-crypto-currencys-future/d/d-id/1127655 "Meet Darwin: Crypto Currency’s Future"], Dark Reading (March 12, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;  Under 12 U.S. Code § 411, the Federal Reserve has the authority to issue Federal Reserve notes,&lt;ref&gt;12 U.S. Code § 411&lt;/ref&gt; and under 12 U.S.C.A. § 418, the Treasury Department "in order to furnish suitable notes for circulation...shall cause plates and dies to be engraved" and print numbered quantities.&lt;ref&gt;12 U.S.C.A. § 418&lt;/ref&gt; The Secretary of the Treasury has the authority to "mint and issue coins".&lt;ref&gt;31 U.S.C.A. § 5111&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is uncertain if this authority includes the authority to "mint" electronic coins for a government-backed cryptocurrency protocol. According to the [[Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis]]'s Director of Research, "the most important aspect of this technology revolution is, in my view, the threat of entry into the money and payment system and what I think it will do is to force traditional institutions, including central banks, to either adapt or die".&lt;ref&gt;David Andolfatto, [http://www.stlouisfed.org/newsroom/multimedia/video/20140331-dialogue-with-the-fed-part6.cfm "Bitcoin and Beyond: The Possibilities and the Pitfalls of Virtual Currencies, Part 6"], Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (March 31, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tax regulations==
The IRS treats VC as property and requires for gains or losses upon an exchange of VC to be calculated.&lt;ref name="irs"/&gt; This means that every VC user must track the gains or losses of every one of their VC transactions to stay in compliance with IRS regulations.&lt;ref&gt;Jose Pagliery, [http://money.cnn.com/2014/03/31/technology/irs-bitcoin "New IRS rules make using Bitcoins a fiasco"], ''CNN Money'' (March 31, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tax Foundation]], a tax policy research organization, argues that the IRS got it wrong by categorizing VC as property because the required record keeping creates compliance obstacles, and by categorizing VC as property, the IRS is ignoring how VC is used and treating it as something that people hold for an investment.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Schmidt, Alexander Derrick, Joseph Henchman, [http://taxfoundation.org/blog/irs-says-bitcoin-be-taxed-gains-new-rule-retroactive "IRS Says Bitcoin to Be Taxed As Gains; New Rule is Retroactive"], Tax Foundation (March 28, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;
The pseudonymity of VC accounts allow users to hide funds and evade taxes.&lt;ref&gt;Omri Marian, [http://www.michiganlawreview.org/articles/are-cryptocurrencies-em-super-em-tax-havens "Are Cryptocurrencies Super Tax Havens?"], ''Michigan Law Review'' Vol. 112:38.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to receiving cash, merchants may not report the earnings to the IRS if the merchant believes the IRS will not be able to account for the transaction.  The IRS may be able to audit a VC exchange the merchant uses, but if the merchant is using a personal VC account or using multiple exchanges the IRS may not be able to track these transactions.

In 2013, the [[Financial Crimes Enforcement Network]] (FinCEN) released a paper stating exchanges and administrators of VC are subject to the [[Bank Secrecy Act]] (BSA) and must register as a Money Services Business (MSB).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/shared/FIN-2013-G001.pdf "Application of FinCEN's Regulations to Persons Administering, Exchanging, or Using Virtual Currencies"], FinCEN.&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of this legislation was to prevent financial exchanges from being used to launder money or finance crime, including terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fincen.gov/about_fincen/wwd/ "What We Do"], FinCEN (last retrieved Nov. 30, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[European Central Bank]] has also recommended registering exchanges to "reduce the incentive for terrorists, criminals and money launderers to make use of these virtual currency schemes for illegal purposes".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/virtualcurrencyschemes201210en.pdf "Virtual Currency Schemes"], European Central Bank 36 (Oct. 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of the BSA applying to VC exchanges and administrators, VC is still used to finance crime and launder money because not every transaction in VC networks are required to comply with the BSA and not every online exchange complies with the BSA.  In September 2014, Robert M. Faiella, a/k/a "BTCKing", pleaded guilty to operating an unlicensed exchange that exchanged over a million in cash for Bitcoin, used for criminal enterprise and known as "Silk Road".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/newyork/press-releases/2014/bitcoin-exchangers-plead-guilty-in-manhattan-federal-court-in-connection-with-the-sale-of-approximately-1-million-in-bitcoins-for-use-on-the-silk-road-website Bitcoin Exchangers Plead Guilty in Manhattan Federal Court in Connection with the Sale of Approximately $1 Million in Bitcoins for Use on the Silk Road Website], The Federal Bureau of Investigation (Sept. 4, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite BSA regulations, Faiella and the users of his exchange, were able to hide their identity through both pseudonymous Bitcoin addresses and an anonymous network that hid their [[IP address]]es.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Zetter, [https://www.wired.com/2013/11/silk-road "How the Feds Took Down the Silk Road Drug Wonderland"], ''Wired'' (Nov. 18, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Money laundering===
The culture of laundering money in the Bitcoin network is so prevalent there is even a website called bitlaunder.com. The company bitlaunder.com claims they are "experts at laundering Bitcoin" and they "use the most sophisticated methods available to completely anonymize your Bitcoins and obscure their history from forensic tracing".&lt;ref&gt;Bitlaunder, https://bitlaunder.com&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[U.S. Government Accountability Office]] reported that the pseudonymity in VCs makes it difficult for the government to detect money laundering and other financial crimes, and it may be necessary to rely on international cooperation to address these crimes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gao.gov/assets/670/663678.pdf "Virtual Currencies: Emerging Regulatory, Law Enforcement, and Consumer Protection Challenges"], U.S. Government Accountability Office (May 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[European Banking Authority]] claimed that regulations should strive for "global coordination, otherwise it will be difficult to achieve a successful regulatory regime".&lt;ref name="eba"/&gt;  In spite of the best regulations from the United States and the European Union, the inherent nature of the Bitcoin protocol allows for pseudonymous transfers of Bitcoins to or from anywhere in the world, so illegal transactions will not be completely eliminated through regulations.

Anonymity in Bitcoins and Altcoins (forks from the Bitcoin protocol) can be increased by adding software augmentations to the VC. Zerocoin, for example, uses an algorithmic process called "[[zero-knowledge proof]]" to hide the value of the coins.&lt;ref&gt;Andy Greenberg, [https://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2014/01/13/bitcoin-anonymity-upgrade-zerocoin-to-become-its-own-cryptocurrency "Bitcoin Anonymity Upgrade Zerocoin To Become An Independent Cryptocurrency"], ''Forbes'' (Jan. 13, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; Dark Wallet anonymously combines transfers of VC to obscure the origin of the transfer, and the developers intend to integrate the software into a Tor network in the future. One of the developers of Dark Wallet described it as "just money laundering software".  He said, "I want a private means for black market transactions", "whether they're for non-prescribed medical inhalers, MDMA for drug enthusiasts, or weapons."&lt;ref&gt;Andy Greenberg, 'Dark Wallet' Is About to Make Bitcoin Money Laundering Easier Than Ever (April 29, 2014), https://www.wired.com/2014/04/dark-wallet/&lt;/ref&gt; A crypto-currency known as Darkcoin offers even more anonymity than Bitcoin.  Similar to Dark Wallet, Darkcoin combines transactions to increase the difficulty of analyzing where the currency was sent. "Some users may be trading Bitcoins for Darkcoins and back again, using the Darkcoin network as a giant bitcoin-laundering service."&lt;ref&gt;Andy Greenberg, [https://www.wired.com/2014/05/darkcoin-is-booming "Darkcoin, the Shadowy Cousin of Bitcoin, Is Booming"], ''Wired'' (May 21, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

Other forms of VC have also been used for making illegal transactions.  The VC service and exchange Liberty Reserve allegedly laundered over 6 billions dollars from crimes such as "credit card fraud, identity theft, investment fraud, computer hacking, child pornography, and narcotics trafficking".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/co-founder-liberty-reserve-pleads-guilty-money-laundering-manhattan-federal-court "Co-founder of Liberty Reserve Pleads Guilty to Money Laundering in Manhattan Federal Court"], Department of Justice (Oct. 31, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;   E-gold, a company with a VC tied to the value of gold, pleaded guilty to money laundering and running an unlicensed money transmitting business, and consequently had to forfeit $45,816,817.84 to the government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov/usao/md/news/2014/Over56.6MillionForfeitedInE-GoldAccountsInvolvedInCriminalOffenses.html "Over $56.6 Million Forfeited In E-Gold Accounts Involved In Criminal Offenses"], United States Attorney's Office, District of Maryland (April 23, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transactions on Tor===  
On November 2014, the FBI, "as part of a coordinated international law enforcement action", seized dozens of "dark markets", including [[Silk Road (marketplace)|Silk Road II]] operating on the anonymous [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor network]].  These markets accepted payment in Bitcoins or similar crypto-currencies, and operated both domestically and internationally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov/usao/nys/pressreleases/November14/DarkMarketTakedown.php "Dozens Of Online “Dark Markets” Seized Pursuant To Forfeiture Complaint Filed In Manhattan Federal Court In Conjunction With The Arrest Of The Operator Of Silk Road 2.0"], United States Attorney's Office, Southern District of New York (Nov. 7, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; Although the FBI was successful in cracking through the anonymous [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor network]] and discovering the origin of the illegal Bitcoin markets Silkroad I and II and similar illegal markets, the methods the FBI used may not be legal or available, in every case, under the [[U.S. Constitution]]'s prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures.

October 2014, the court decided the fate of the defendant regarding his role in the first Silkroad, but the court refused to decide whether his [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment rights]] were violated because he never pleaded that he had a right to privacy in the server that was searched.&lt;ref name="ulbricht"&gt;''United States v. Ulbricht'', No. 14-CR-68 KBF, 2014 WL 5090039, 3 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 10, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;  The Court claimed that the defendant did not plead a violation of his Fourth Amendment rights because either "he in fact has no personal privacy interest in the [[Iceland]]ic server, or because he has made a tactical decision not to reveal that he does" thus claiming that Ulbricht "therefore has no basis to challenge".&lt;ref name="ulbricht"/&gt;  This is significant because the Court did not decide if the techniques the FBI used to locate the defendant IP address violated the Fourth Amendment.

Operating behind the anonymous Tor network might give a subjective expectation of privacy, but this may not be reasonable expectation of privacy that would survive the [[Katz v. United States|''Katz'' test]]&lt;ref&gt;''Katz v. United States'', 389 U.S. 347, 360, 88 S. Ct. 507, 516, 19 L. Ed. 2d 576 (1967)&lt;/ref&gt; because the Tor software explicitly states that it "can't solve all anonymity problems".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en "Tor: Overview, Tor"] (last retrieved Nov. 30, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Under ''[[United States v. Warshak|Warshak]]'', the defendant had a "reasonable expectation of privacy" in the content of his email; however, unlike an email, an IP address is generally visible to everyone,&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Warshak'', 631 F.3d 266, 274 (6th Cir. 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI claimed they found Silkroad's IP address by "typing in miscellaneous entries into the username, password, and CAPTCHA fields contained in the interface" to find an IP address associated with an application misconfigured to the Tor network.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/gov.uscourts.nysd.422824 ''United States v. Ulbricht''], S1 14 Cr. 68 KBF (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Securities fraud===
The [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) treats [[securities]] crimes committed with Bitcoin and VCs as money, and it is likely that anti-gambling regulations will be enforced with the same reasoning. On July 2013, [[Trendon T. Shavers]] was charged by the SEC for "defrauding investors in a [[Ponzi scheme]] involving Bitcoin" that amounted to over 700,000 Bitcoin or $4.5 million based on the average price of Bitcoin in 2011 and 2012 when the investments were offered and sold.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/News/PressRelease/Detail/PressRelease/1370539730583#.VHIOy4uJndm "SEC Charges Texas Man With Running Bitcoin-Denominated Ponzi Scheme"], U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (July 23, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Shavers implemented the scheme through Bitcoin Savings and Trust (BTCST), "an unincorporated online investment scheme" that was not registered with the SEC.&lt;ref name="sec"&gt;''Sec. &amp; Exch. Comm'n v. Shavers'', No. 4:13-CV-416, 2014 WL 4652121, at *1 (E.D. Tex. Sept. 18, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; "The collective loss to BTCST investors who suffered net losses (there were also net winners) was 265,678 bitcoins, or more than $149 million at current exchange rates" from September 2014.&lt;ref name="sec"/&gt;

Shavers attempted to argue the investments were not securities because Bitcoin is not money.  However, in a precedent determining decision, the magistrate judge determined that Bitcoin is money, and thus the investments were securities.&lt;ref name="sec"/&gt; The magistrate judge stated, "[i]t is clear that Bitcoin can be used as money. It can be used to purchase goods or services, and as Shavers stated, used to pay for individual living expenses. The only limitation of Bitcoin is that it is limited to those places that accept it as currency. However, it can also be exchanged for conventional currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, Euro, Yen, and Yuan. Therefore, Bitcoin is a currency or form of money, and investors wishing to invest in BTCST provided an investment of money."&lt;ref name="sec"/&gt; This decision paved the way for other regulators to treat Bitcoin and VCs as money, so it is likely this decision will be cited if regulators decide to prosecute VC transactions under the UIGEA, Illegal Gambling Business Act, Wire Act, or any other regulation involving financial transactions.

===Consumer warnings===
On August 2014, the [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]] (CFPB) released a consumer advisory to warn consumers of the risk of VCs.  The advisory warned consumers of hackers, scammers, loss of VCs by losing the private key, fewer regulations, and an inability to make chargebacks.&lt;ref name="cfpb"/&gt;  States have also released consumer advisories and warned users that VCs are not insured by the FDIC, highly volatile, often associated with criminal enterprises, new, and unproven technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nccob.org/Public/docs/Financial%20Institutions/Money%20Transmitters/OCOB_Virtual_Currency_Alert.pdf "Consumer Alert: Virtual Currencies"], State of North Carolina, Office of the Commissioner of Banks.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myfloridacfo.com/pressoffice/ViewConsumerAlert.asp?ID=4250 "Consumer Alert: Virtual Currencies"], Florida Department of Financial Services (March 18, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbo.ca.gov/Consumers/Advisories/Virtual_Currencies_0414.pdf "What You Should Know About Virtual Currencies"], California Department of Business Oversight (April 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;  David S. Cohen, the Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence at the Treasury Department, stated that VCs pose "clear risks to consumers and investors" because the "anonymity and transaction irrevocability [of VCs] expose[s] them to fraud and theft, [a]nd unlike FDIC insured banks and credit unions that guarantee the safety of deposits, there are no such safeguards provided to virtual wallets".&lt;ref&gt;Remarks From Under Secretary of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen on [http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl236.aspx “Addressing the Illicit Finance Risks of Virtual Currency”], U.S. Department of the Treasury Press Center (March 18, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

The result of this weak regulatory environment makes VCs prone to volatility, market manipulation, money laundering, fraud, and illegal transactions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43339.pdf "Bitcoin: Questions, Answers, and Analysis of Legal Issues"], Congressional Research Service, 7-5700 (Jul. 15, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; On August 11, 2014, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) released a consumer advisory warning on VC and began accepting complaints on VC products and services.&lt;ref name="cfpb"/&gt; Additionally, many U.S. states have released consumer warnings regarding virtual currencies.

===Online gambling===
The federal legality of online gambling with Bitcoins in the United States has not yet been decided; however, the legality of online gambling with legal tender currency has been decided. In April 2011, the FBI indicted the "founders of the three largest Internet poker companies doing business in the United States—PokerStars, Full Tilt Poker, and Absolute Poker...with bank fraud, money laundering, and illegal gambling".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fbi.gov/newyork/press-releases/2011/manhattan-u.s.-attorney-charges-principals-of-three-largest-internet-poker-companies-with-bank-fraud-illegal-gambling-offenses-and-laundering-billions-in-illegal-gambling-proceeds "Manhattan U.S. Attorney Charges Principals of Three Largest Internet Poker Companies with Bank Fraud, Illegal Gambling Offenses, and Laundering Billions in Illegal Gambling Proceeds"], Federal Bureau of Investigation (April 15, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2006, the United States enacted the [[Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act]] (UIGEA), yet the poker companies continued to operate until the 2011 indictment. Similar to the 2011 indictment, the Justice Department may be collecting evidence and building a case against the Bitcoin gambling sites before they launch an indictment. 
The UIGEA does not expressly prohibit Internet gambling, but it does make it illegal for an online gambling business to knowingly accept fund transfers.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew M. Nevill, [http://illinoisjltp.com/journal/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Nevill.pdf "Folded Industry? Black Friday's Effect on the Future of Online Poker in the United States"], ''University of Illinois Journal of Law, Technology, and Policy'', Spring 2013, at 203, 210&lt;/ref&gt;   The Bitcoin gambling sites are currently circumventing this legislation by keeping their funds in bitcoin [[cryptocurrency wallet]]s.  However, in order for these sites to exchange their Bitcoins for a [[fiat currency]] they must use a financial exchange, so even by receiving their earnings with Bitcoin, the online gambling sites may come into jurisdiction of the UIGEA if the gambling business accepts payment through "(i) automated clearing house (ACH) systems, (ii) card systems, (iii) check collection systems, (iv) money transmitting businesses, and (v) wire transfer systems."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fdic.gov/news/news/financial/2010/fil10035a.pdf "Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006"], Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Illegal Gambling Business Act may also prohibit Bitcoin gambling sites because the act broadly prohibits all gambling businesses that are in (i) "violation of the law of a State or political subdivision in which it is conducted; (ii) involves five or more persons who conduct, finance, manage, supervise, direct, or own all or part of such business; and (iii) has been or remains in substantially continuous operation for a period in excess of thirty days or has a gross revenue of $2,000 in any single day."&lt;ref&gt;18 U.S.C.A. § 1955&lt;/ref&gt;  Under IRS regulations Bitcoin and other VCs are treated as property, so losses and gains must be calculated to determine the value of the virtual currency.  If an online gambling business earned the value of at least $2,000 dollars in Bitcoin "in any single day", they may fall under this act.

The [[Federal Wire Act]] (Wire Act) prohibits "bets or wagers on any sporting event or contest".&lt;ref&gt;18 U.S.C.A. § 1084 (West)&lt;/ref&gt; Some Bitcoin gambling sites have a mixture of betting on sports and traditional casino games,&lt;ref&gt;Cloudbet (last retrieved Nov. 30, 2014), https://www.cloudbet.com/en/&lt;/ref&gt; and it is conceivable the bets on sporting events could fall within the language of the Wire Act. The Wire Act expressly mentions "money or credit as a result of bets or wagers", and VCs may fall under the intent of the Wire Act because they operate as credits that can be redeemed or exchanged at VC exchanges, and they operate like money because they facilitate transactions.&lt;ref&gt;18 U.S.C.A. § 1084&lt;/ref&gt;

Some online wagers do not fit under the typical definition of gambling or a game of chance. The  Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) refers to these as "Event Contracts". On December 2011, the CFTC ordered an online business to cease listing Political Events Contracts (i.e., betting on who will be elected) for trade, as it is contrary to the public interest.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.cftc.gov/stellent/groups/public/@rulesandproducts/documents/ifdocs/nadexorder040212.pdf In re. North American Derivatives Exchange]'', order (2012).&lt;/ref&gt; The CFTC's jurisdiction is being tested by online businesses that accept virtual currency for event contracts. A website, accepting Bitcoin and other VCs, called predictious.com lists trades such as trying to call who will be elected, whether a celebrity will have a boy or girl child, or who will be the winner of a science competition.

==Electronic Fund Transfer Act== 
Virtual currencies lack many of the regulations and consumer protections that legal tender currencies have. Under U.S. law, a cardholder of a credit card is protected from liability in excess of $50 if the card was used for an unauthorized transaction.&lt;ref&gt;15 U.S. Code Section 1643.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Electronic Fund Transfer Act]] (EFTA) was written to protect consumers in transfers through [[automated teller machines|ATMs]], point-of-sale terminals, ACH systems, remote transfers, and remittance transfers. However, the EFTA does not apply to VCs, and due to the nature of many VCs, it may not be possible for VCs to be in complete compliance with the Act. For example, the regulations require for a consumer to be allowed 30 minutes to cancel an electronic transfer.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Brito, Andrea Castillo, [http://mercatus.org/sites/default/files/Brito_BitcoinPrimer.pdf "Bitcoin A Primer for Policymakers"], Mercatus Center at George Mason University (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Many VCs, such as Bitcoin, do not allow chargebacks, so cancelling the Bitcoin transfer is not possible. Additionally, a credit card that transacts in VC is not protected by the fifty-dollar maximum liability for the holder of the credit card.&lt;ref&gt;15 U.S.C.A. § 1643&lt;/ref&gt;

==Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation==
The [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) does not insure VCs.

==Federal Election Commission==
In a May 2014 Advisory Opinion, the [[Federal Election Commission]] (FEC) decided that Bitcoin donations are permitted under FEC laws.&lt;ref&gt;FEC Record Advisory Opinions, Federal Election Commission (May 8, 2014), http://www.fec.gov/pages/fecrecord/2014/june/ao2014-02.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; This decision will permit microdonations, and it may encourage more people to donate to campaigns. The decision may also encourage more people to attempt to hide their political donations behind the pseudonymity of Bitcoin.

==The power to prohibit virtual currencies==
The [[U.S. Congress]] has the power to regulate or outright prohibit VCs, whether as currency or securities,&lt;ref name="Engle"&gt;Eric Engle, [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1544784783/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i0 "Bitcoin: Digital Finance Law"]  pp. 68-86 (2017)&lt;/ref&gt; pursuant to its power to "regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States"&lt;ref name="money"&gt;U.S. Const., art. I, §8, cl. 5&lt;/ref&gt; and under its exclusive constitutional power "to coin Money" and "regulate the Value thereof".&lt;ref name="money"/&gt; In a November 2014 decision, the Court upheld the power of regulators to prosecute a defendant who "designed, created and minted coins called 'Liberty Dollars,' coins 'in resemblance or in similitude' [or made to look like] of U.S. coins."&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. von NotHaus'', No. 5:09CR27-RLV, 2014 WL 5817559, at *1 (W.D.N.C. Nov. 10, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; Although the defendant did not pass the Liberty Dollars currency as a counterfeit, the currency were in close enough "resemblance of coins of the United States or of foreign countries" and consequently fell under the authority of 18 U.S.C.A. § 486.123 The Court has not decided if § 486 includes the power to prohibit VCs, but if a Court decides that the purpose and intent of VC resembles United States or foreign currency it may fall under § 486.

The Stamp Payment Act of 1862 prohibits anyone from "mak[ing], issu[ing], circulat[ing], or pay[ing] out any note, check, memorandum, token, or other obligation for a less sum than $1, intended to circulate as money or to be received or used in lieu of lawful money of the United States".&lt;ref&gt;18 U.S.C.A. § 336&lt;/ref&gt; The Court has not decided if Congress has the power to prohibit VCs under this Act or any other existing regulation or statute.
