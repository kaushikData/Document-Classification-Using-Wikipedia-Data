'''198 Contemporary Arts and Learning''', also known as the '''198 Gallery''' or '''198''', is an art space and gallery in [[Railton Road]], [[Brixton]], London.&lt;ref name="De Souza2002"&gt;{{cite book|last1=De Souza|first1=Pauline|editor1-last=Donnell|editor1-first=Alison|title=Companion to Contemporary Black British Culture|date=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134700257|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VfdpdZ9DwH0C&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=%22198%20Gallery%22&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22198%20Gallery%22&amp;f=false|chapter=198 Gallery}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisation, originally named Roots Community, was founded in 1988 by John 'Noel' Morgan and Zoe Lindsay-Thomas.&lt;ref name="Davis2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Lucy|last2=Bayode|first2=Folami|editor1-last=Atkinson|editor1-first=Dennis|editor2-last=Dash|editor2-first=Paul|title=Social and Critical Practice in Art Education|date=2005|publisher=Trentham Books|isbn=9781858563114|pages=81–90|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rOKmJsHYT0YC&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;dq=%22198%22%20railton%20road&amp;pg=PA81#v=onepage&amp;q=%22198%22%20railton%20road&amp;f=false|chapter=The 198 Gallery}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lindsay-Thomas was a minicab driver and Morgan was manager of the Vargus Social Club in Landor Road. The organisation eventually changed its name to 198 Gallery, after its location on [[Railton Road]].

198's initial remit was to promote the work of contemporary African, Caribbean and Asian artists whose work represented the diversity of British society. 198 later expanded their policy to include artists from outside the UK.

==Exhibitions==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5725">'''9 Evenings: Theatre and Engineering''' was a series of performances from October 13–23, 1966, where artists and engineers from [[Bell Laboratories]] in [[Murray Hill, New Jersey]] collaborated on what was to be the first event in a series of projects that would become known as [[E.A.T.]] or [[E.A.T.|Experiments in Art and Technology]]. 9 Evenings: Theatre and Engineering was conjured up by [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[Billy Klüver]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://coe.berkeley.edu/labnotes/0204/history.html]&lt;/ref&gt; and was originally intended to be presented as part of the [[Stockholm]] Festival of Art and Technology in 1966. But when the festival's negotiations fell through, [[Billy Klüver]] and the whole group moved the event to the [[69th Regiment Armory]] and called it ''9 Evenings: Theatre and Engineering.''&lt;ref name = "getty"&gt;[http://archives2.getty.edu:8082/xtf/view?docId=ead/940003/940003.xml;chunk.id=ref15;brand=default]&lt;/ref&gt; The participants consisted of 10 artists and some 30 engineers to create a blend of avant-garde theatre, dance and new technologies.

9 Evenings was the first large-scale collaboration between artists and engineers and scientists. The two groups worked together for 10 months to develop technical equipment and systems that were used as an integral part of the artists’ performances. Their collaboration produced many "firsts" in the use of new technology for the theater, both with specially-designed systems and equipment and with innovative use of existing equipment. [[Closed-circuit television]] and [[television]] projection was used on stage for the first time; a [[fiber-optics]] camera picked up objects in a performer's pocket; an [[infrared]] [[television camera]] captured action in total darkness; a [[Doppler effect|Doppler]] sonar device translated movement into sound; and portable wireless FM transmitters and amplifiers transmitted speech and body sounds to Armory loudspeakers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.9evenings.org/ 9 Evenings: Theatre and Engineering] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305133753/http://www.9evenings.org/ |date=2012-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artists involved with 9 Evenings include: [[John Cage]], [[Lucinda Childs]], [[Öyvind Fahlström]], [[Alex Hay (artist)|Alex Hay]], [[Deborah Hay]], [[Steve Paxton]], [[Yvonne Rainer]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[David Tudor]], and [[Robert Whitman]].&lt;ref name = "getty" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fondation-langlois.org/html/e/page.php?NumPage=294]&lt;/ref&gt;

Schroeder|Manfred Schroeder]], and [[Fred Waldhauer]].&lt;ref&gt;9 evenings : theatre and engineering. — Edited by Pontus Hultén and Frank Königsberg. — [New York] : Experiments in Art and Technology : The Foundation for Contemporary Performance Arts, [1966]. — [14] p.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 9 Evenings: Theatre and Engineering DVD Series (director: Barbro Schultz Lundestam) is an important documentation of the collaborations between the artists and engineers that produced innovative works using these emerging technologies.&lt;ref&gt;''9 Evenings: Theatre and Engineering'' {{cite web |url=http://www.9evenings.org/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305133753/http://www.9evenings.org/ |archivedate=2012-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Swedish journalist and movie/documentary director Barbro Schultz Lundestam visited Billy Klüver and his wife, Julie Martin, in New Jersey in 1993. The couple showed her their archives of the ''E.A.T. projects'', including manuscripts, photographs and 16mm film recordings on ''9 Evenings''. (Julie Martin and Billy Klüver had met during rehearsals for ''9 Evenings'', since she was an assistant to Robert Whitman for his performance.&lt;ref&gt;Information by Barbro Schultz Lundestam&lt;/ref&gt;) Robert Rauschenberg asked Schultz Lundestam to work on the old film material. She completed 10 documentaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sevendoc.com/GB_barbro-schultz-lundestam-.html Seven Doc: Barbro Schultz Lundestam]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalweek.paris/les-origines-du-monde-numerique/ ''9 Evenings'' as part of VARIATION ArtJaws media art fair] in Paris, November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8919">'''Art competitions''' were held as part of the '''[[1948 Summer Olympics]]''' in [[London]], [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]].  Medals were awarded in five categories ([[architecture]], [[literature]], [[music]], [[painting]], and [[sculpture]]), for works inspired by sport-related themes.

The art exhibition was held at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] from 15 July to 14 August, and displayed works of art from 27 different countries.  The literature competition attracted 44 entries, and the music competition had 36 entries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Official Report of the Organising Committee for the XIV Olympiad |author=(ed.)

The art competitions included multiple subcategories for each of the five artistic categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Olympic Art Competition 1948 London |work=Olympic Games Museum |author=Wagner, Juergen |url=http://olympic-museum.de/art/1948.htm |accessdate=2008-03-26| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080216203615/http://www.olympic-museum.de/art/1948.htm| archivedate= 16 February 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The judges declined to award any medals for dramatic works in literature, and no gold medals in another five subcategories.  [[Alex Diggelmann]] of [[Switzerland]] won both a silver medal and a bronze medal for two different entries in the applied arts and crafts subcategory, a feat unlikely to be duplicated in any event in the [[Olympic sports|current Olympic program]].

These were the last Games in which art competitions were held, after being in the official program for all Games since 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=In Search of the Lost Champions of the Olympic Art Contests |last=Kramer |first=Bernhard |journal=Journal of Olympic History |volume=12 |issue=2 |date=May 2004 |pages=29–34 |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/JOH/JOHv12n2/johv12n2m.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-03-25| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080410082301/http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/JOH/JOHv12n2/johv12n2m.pdf| archivedate= 10 April 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At a meeting of the [[International Olympic Committee]] in 1949 it was decided to hold art ''exhibitions'' instead, as it was judged illogical to permit professionals to compete in the art competitions while only amateurs were permitted to compete in sporting events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Report on Art Exhibitions |last=Bolanaki |first=A. |journal=Bulletin du Comité International Olympique |issue=27 |date=June 1951 |page=34 |publisher=International Olympic Committee |location=Lausanne |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/OlympicInformationCenter/OlympicReview/1951/BDCE27/BDCE27l.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-03-26| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080410082302/http://www.la84foundation.org/OlympicInformationCenter/OlympicReview/1951/BDCE27/BDCE27l.pdf| archivedate= 10 April 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 1952 a non-competitive art and cultural festival has been associated with each Games.

'''Automatic Vaudeville Studios''' ('''AVS''') is an underground movie collective based out of [[Montreal]]. Founded in 1998 and modeled after the golden age of [[Hollywood]]'s movie studios, AVS has churned out close to 100 shorts using local artists, musicians, actors and other unpaid talent to bring their no-budget genre inspired entertainments to life.

Some of Automatic Vaudeville's notable productions include ''[[The Recommendations]]'', a comedy about jealousy and revenge in the literary demi-monde, ''[[Spanked: The Ron Friendly Story]]'', about the tumultuous life and times of a fictional performance artist, ''[[Young Cons]]'', and the ongoing provocative art project / film series known as the ''[[Schandcycle]]'', which features improvised music performed by [[Montreal]] music collective [[Schandkollektief]].

A selection of Automatic Vaudeville's work can be found on their limited-run DVD releases, ''[[Your Hi-Class DVD, Vol. 1]]'' and ''[[Your Hi-Class DVD, Vol. 2]]''.

'''''Bathers at Asnières''''' ({{lang-fr|Une Baignade, Asnières}}) is an oil-on-canvas painting by the French artist [[Georges Seurat|Georges Pierre Seurat]], the first of his two masterpieces on the monumental scale. The canvas is of a suburban, placid Parisian riverside scene. Isolated figures, with their clothes piled sculpturally on the riverbank, together with trees, austere boundary walls and buildings, and the [[Seine|River Seine]] are presented in a formal layout. A combination of complex brushstroke techniques, and a meticulous application of contemporary colour theory bring to the composition a sense of gentle vibrancy and timelessness.

Seurat completed the painting of ''Bathers at Asnières'' in 1884, when he was twenty-four years old. He applied to the jury of the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] of the same year to have the work exhibited there, but the jury rejected it. The ''Bathers'' continued to puzzle many of Seurat’s contemporaries, and the picture was not widely acclaimed until many years after the death of the artist at the age of just thirty-one. An appreciation of the painting’s merits grew during the twentieth century, and today it hangs in the [[National Gallery|National Gallery, London]], where it is considered one of the highlights of the gallery’s collection of paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/collection/glance.htm |title=National Gallery, London. ''30 highlight paintings.'' |access-date=2009-02-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224231813/http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/collection/glance.htm |archive-date=2009-02-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==

[[File:Map courbevoie.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.4|A possible site of the sandy gully is left of the page-fold. The bridges of Asnières are at the right.]]

The spot depicted is just short of four miles from the centre of Paris. It is in fact the case that the figures on the river-bank are not in the commune of [[Asnières-sur-Seine|Asnières]], but are rather in [[Courbevoie]], the commune bordering Asnières to the west. The bathers themselves are in the River Seine. The slope forming most of the left hand side of the painting was known as the ''Côte des Ajoux'', near the end of the ''rue des Ajoux'', on the north bank of the river. Opposite is the [[Île de la Jatte|island of la Grande Jatte]], the east tip of which is shown as the slope and the trees to the right, and which Seurat has pictorially extended beyond its actual length. The Asnières railway bridge, and the industrial buildings of [[Clichy, Hauts-de-Seine|Clichy]] are in the background. Locations such as this one were sometimes shown on French nineteenth century maps as ''Baignade'' (or, ‘bathing area’).&lt;ref&gt;Seurat and The Bathers. John Leighton, Richard Thompson, ''et&amp;nbsp;al''. National Gallery Publications Limited. London, 1997. isbn&amp;nbsp;1857091698. Pages&amp;nbsp;53,&amp;nbsp;54,&amp;nbsp;115.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seurat and the Making of La Grande Jatte. Robert&amp;nbsp;L Herbert, Neil Harris, ''et&amp;nbsp;al''. The Art Institute of Chicago, 2004. isbn&amp;nbsp;0520242114. Page&amp;nbsp;40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many artists painted canvases from this stretch of the Seine during the 1880s. As well as the ''Bathers'', some of Seurat’s better known works to come from the vicinity include his ''The Seine at Courbevoie'', ''[[A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte]]'', and ''The Bridge at Courbevoie''.

== Aesthetic ==

Seurat uses a variety of means to suggest the baking heat of a summer’s day at the riverside. A hot haze softens the edges of the trees in the middle-distance and washes out colour from the bridges and factories in the background—the blue of the sky at the horizon is paled almost to whiteness. A shimmering appearance at the surface of ''Bathers at Asnières'' subtly reinforces this saturating heat and sunlight. Writing about these effects, the art historian [[Roger Fry]] reported his view that, “no one could render this enveloping with a more exquisitely tremulous sensibility, a more penetrating observation or more unfailing consistency, than Seurat”.&lt;ref&gt;Seurat. Roger Fry&amp;nbsp;&amp;amp; Anthony Blunt. Phaidon. London, 1965. Page&amp;nbsp;13.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Seurat bathers man seated.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|Man seated centre-left]]

The isolated figures are given statuesque but largely unmodeled treatment, and their skin and their clothes are clean, with a waxy finish. They appear unselfconscious, at ease in their environment, and—with the possible exception of the boy to the bottom right—are locked in a pensive and solitary reverie. Horizontal and vertical lines at the middle and far distance contrast with arched backs and the relaxed postures of the figures toward the front. These postures, angles of heads, directions of gaze, and positions of limbs are repeated among the figures, giving the group a rhythmic unity. Distinctively coloured forms in close proximity, such as the grouping of horse-chestnut colours of the clothes on the bank, and the grouping of oranges of the boys in the water, add to the stability of the work—an effect reinforced in the cluster of shadows to the left on the bank, and the un-verisimilar play of light around the bathing figures.&lt;ref&gt;Seurat, Une Baignade, Asnières (The Gallery Books, No.&amp;nbsp;9). Douglas Cooper, Percy Lund Humphries&amp;nbsp;&amp;amp; Company Ltd, 12&amp;nbsp;Bedford Square. London, c.1946. Page&amp;nbsp;14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Art of Humanism. Kenneth Clark. John Murray Ltd, 50 Albemarle Street, London, W1X&amp;nbsp;4BD. 1983. {{ISBN|0-7195-4077-1}}. Page&amp;nbsp;75.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Seurat bathers grass water.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.4|''Balayé'' and fine horizontal strokes]]

Seurat described one of the brush-stroke techniques he developed on this canvas as the ''balayé'' technique, wherein a flat brush is used to apply matte colours using strokes in a criss-crossing formation. These strokes become smaller as they approach the horizon.&lt;ref&gt;Seurat, Une Baignade, Asnières (The Gallery Books, No.&amp;nbsp;9). Douglas Cooper, Percy Lund Humphries&amp;nbsp;&amp;amp; Company Ltd, 12&amp;nbsp;Bedford Square. London, c.1946. Page&amp;nbsp;14.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''balayé'' technique is not rolled out in a consistent manner across the painting, but is adapted where Seurat thought it appropriate. The foreground—for example—consists of a ''balayé'' network of strokes atop a more solid layer of underpaint, suggesting the flickering play of sunlight over the blades of grass. This chunky, cross-hatched brushstroke pattern is in contrast with the nearly horizontal, much thinner strokes that are used to depict the water, and is in even greater contrast with the smoothly rendered skin of the figures.&lt;ref&gt;National Gallery Technical Bulletin. Jo Kirby and Ashok Roy, National Gallery Company Limited, 2003. {{ISBN|1-85709-997-4}}. Page&amp;nbsp;28.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Seurat’s suburb ==

At the time of this painting, urban development in Paris was proceeding at a very rapid pace. The population of Paris had doubled from one million in 1850 to two million in 1877, and the population of Asnières had almost doubled in just ten years to reach 14,778 in 1886. The reality of the often unpleasant or dangerous conditions in which industrial workers laboured had already been fully taken on by painters, such as in—for instance—[[Claude Monet|Monet’s]] painting of 1875, ''Men unloading coal'', which in fact shows the bridges at Asnières as they were almost a decade before Seurat painted them. 

[[File:Monet men unloading coal.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.4|Monet, ''Men Unloading Coal'', c.1875]]
Seurat however, elected not to make the real or imagined plight of the suburban workers his concern, instead portraying the labouring class and [[Petite bourgeoisie|petit-bourgeoisie]] of Asnières and Courbevoie with dignity, and in a scene of lazy leisure. It was in the late nineteenth century a break with practice to use painting on this scale in this way, but ''Bathers at Asnières'' carries this unusual message with no note of incivility or incongruity.&lt;ref&gt;Seurat and The Bathers. John Leighton, Richard Thompson, ''et&amp;nbsp;al'', National Gallery Publications Limited. London, 1997. isbn&amp;nbsp;1857091698. Pages&amp;nbsp;110,&amp;nbsp;115–118.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only did Seurat decline to make absolutely clear the social status of the major figures in ''Bathers'', but neither did he show them performing a public role of any kind. Their faces are for the most part shown in profile, and not one of them faces in the direction of the viewer. The anonymity and ambiguity with which these figures are painted was never again to feature so prominently in any major painting from Seurat.

The industrial infrastructure of bridges and factories to the rear is a notable feature of the composition. In spite of the unglamarous function and appearance of these recent additions to suburban Paris, they are painted as subtly variagated and somewhat classicised masses—veiled by the heat haze, and surrounded by trees at each side. Their appearance is punctuated by sails of sailing-boats and the strikingly coloured head of the central figure. These factories and trains were noisy and smelly, but Seurat does not permit this to dominate the painting; for all that the chimneys belch, they seem powerless to disrupt the settled scene.

== Preparatory works and influences ==

In 1878 and 1879—only a few years prior to painting the ''Bathers''—Seurat had been a student at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]]. The ''École'' instructed its students that before work began on any large scale painting, there must first be extensive efforts with preparatory paintings and drawings. It seems possible that Seurat completed his first small oil study in this preparatory phase for the painting of the ''Bathers'' as early as 1882.&lt;ref&gt;Seurat and The Bathers. John Leighton, Richard Thompson, ''et&amp;nbsp;al'', National Gallery Publications Limited. London, 1997. isbn&amp;nbsp;1857091698. Page&amp;nbsp;54.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Final Study for Bathers 1883.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Final study, 1883, now in the [[Art Institute of Chicago]]]]
César de Hauke’s ''catalogue raisonné'' of the works of Seurat lists fourteen works as oil studies for the ''Bathers'', most if not all of which were almost certainly painted outdoors, and in which the composition of the final piece may be seen gradually taking shape. The last of these studies—presently housed at the Art Institute of Chicago—was painted in 1883 and is very close to the final work, except most obviously in respect of its size; it is just 25&amp;nbsp;cm long and 16&amp;nbsp;cm high. Seurat was fond of these small studies, calling them his ''croquetons'' (a [[nonce word]] best translated as ‘sketchettes’), and hanging them on the walls of his studio.&lt;ref&gt;Seurat and The Bathers. John Leighton, Richard Thompson, ''et&amp;nbsp;al'', National Gallery Publications Limited. London, 1997. isbn&amp;nbsp;1857091698. Pages&amp;nbsp;32,&amp;nbsp;51,&amp;nbsp;52,&amp;nbsp;64.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Seurat L'Echo.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|Conté crayon study of boy to the far right]]

Whereas for the most part Seurat used these oil studies to work through his compositional problems, nine extant drawings in [[Conté|conté crayon]] show him focusing individually on each of the five main figures in the painting. The drawings show Seurat working out ways of deploying light and shade for the purpose of implying space and plasticity. Many of the details the painter worked on in these [[monochrome]] drawings were to find their final realisation when translated into the colours of the finished oil painting.

These arduous methods of preparation were in keeping with the general values espoused at the ''École''. But one professor from that institution was to have a more particular and wide ranging impact on Seurat’s imagination, which bore directly discernable effects in the ''Bathers''. [[Charles&amp;nbsp;Blanc]] had been a professor and director at the ''École'' and had arranged for copies of [[Quattrocento]] fresco paintings from [[Arezzo]] to be displayed in the ''École'' chapel. The huge, stately and dignified figures in these frescos, and the regularity of their spacing has obvious echoes in the ''Bathers''. Among these fresco painters was [[Piero&amp;nbsp;della&amp;nbsp;Francesca]], whose ''[[Resurrection (Piero della Francesca)|Resurrection]]'' depicts a sleeping guard at the bottom-left sharing a number of features with the seated man in ''Bathers at Asnières''. The curvature of slumping back and bent legs is clearly matched in both figures, and indeed the posture also appears in the ''[[Study (Flandrin)|Young Male Nude Seated beside the Sea]]'' of Jean-Hippolyte Flandrin, a painting with which any student at the ''École'' would have been familiar. The sculpted contours of Piero’s soldier’s cape find an echo in the rugged contours of the trousers in Seurat’s painting, and the flick at the back of the guard’s hat becomes a rhythmic motif showing up with hats, hair and bootstraps alike in ''Bathers''.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Boime. ''Seurat and Piero Della Francesca''. The Art Bulletin, Vol&amp;nbsp;47, No.&amp;nbsp;2, June&amp;nbsp;1965. Page&amp;nbsp;266. Published by College Art Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Piero della francesca resurrection guard.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Piero della Francesca, ''Resurrection'', c.1460.]]

Further, Blanc had written a book in 1867, which Seurat read the year he began his studies at the ''École'', and which was to strongly influence him during his formative years—the ''Grammaire des arts du dessin''. Near the beginning of this book, Blanc had claimed that [[Nicolas Poussin|Nicolas Poussin’s]] ''The Finding of Moses'' was an exemplary case of how art should idealise nature, concluding his passage, ‘This is how a scene from everyday life suddenly becomes raised to the dignity of a history painting.’ This remark seems pertinent to the Bathers, which certainly shares a number of compositional elements with Poussin’s masterpiece of 1638. Both works show to the right a lowered male figure, and to the left a reclining male figure painted from behind. The horizon in both paintings is punctured just off-centre with a head, and in both paintings the river is spanned with a distant bridge, with block-like buildings on the left bank and trees on the other. And both pictures have a flat-bottomed boat at the centre-right.&lt;ref&gt;Seurat and The Bathers. John Leighton, Richard Thompson, ''et&amp;nbsp;al'', National Gallery Publications Limited. London, 1997. isbn&amp;nbsp;1857091698. Page&amp;nbsp;15,&amp;nbsp;87.&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of Seurat’s French contemporary [[Pierre Puvis de Chavannes]]—and in particular of his ''Doux Pays'' shown at the Salon of 1882—is also evident in the ''Bathers''. Both paintings are on the monumental scale—that of Puvis’ being over four metres long—and both works have life-size figures. The theme of the architectonic group of figures to the left in ''Doux Pays'' is echoed by Seurat; where Puvis shows a half-pedimental group in one plane, Seurat uses recession, and suggests association by means of repetition. The two paintings also share the technique of dividing their large canvases into areas of predominant colours—of blue and gold in ''Doux Pays'', to rather cool effect, and of blue and green in the ''Bathers'' with a warmer result. In both paintings a prominent figure breaks into the horizon just off-centre, a curved sail appears in almost the same spot to the right, and triangular poses are observed, as are boys in varying degrees of restivity.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Puvis de Chavannes.

Although a receptive and conscientious student at the revered ''École'', Seurat had been open to ideas from some more esoteric sources too. In 1879, with his friend, fellow ''École'' student, and future portrait-subject [[Edmond Aman-Jean]], Seurat attended the fourth exhibition of paintings from the then very unrevered Impressionist painters, where they duly received an “unexpected and profound shock”.&lt;ref&gt;Seurat and The Bathers. John Leighton, Richard Thompson, ''et&amp;nbsp;al'', National Gallery Publications Limited. London, 1997. isbn&amp;nbsp;1857091698. Page&amp;nbsp;15.&lt;/ref&gt; And although Seurat had already seen modern aesthetic theories summarised in Blanc’s Grammaire, he sought out the original texts from the theoreticians themselves, such those of David Sutter, the chemist [[Michel&amp;nbsp;Eugène&amp;nbsp;Chevreul]], and the physicist [[Ogden&amp;nbsp;Rood]], whose ''Modern Chromatics'' was written while Seurat was at the ''École'', and which the artist read as soon as it was translated into French in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;Seurat and The Bathers. John Leighton, Richard Thompson, ''et&amp;nbsp;al'', National Gallery Publications Limited. London, 1997. isbn&amp;nbsp;1857091698. Page&amp;nbsp;15,&amp;nbsp;42.&lt;/ref&gt; Having immersed himself in these authors’ works, Seurat borrowed heavily from their modern theories about colours and the way humans perceive them. These influences allowed Seurat to emerge from the venerable disciplines of the ''École'' to fashion his own distinctly modern method of using tone and colour.

One of the recurrent themes of these painstakingly detailed new theories was the idea that humans may not perceive colours in isolation but rather, that one colour may be seen to interfere with another colour neighbouring it. In this way, colour perception was explained as a complex, interpretive process, rather than a static and simple record of visual data. Seurat’s response to the theories in these writings is widely evident in the Bathers, most obviously in such areas as those of the torso and legs of the man seated centre-left on the persimmon-orange cushion, and of the central figure as his back contrasts with light blue water and his arm contrasts with water of a darker hue.

== Reception and history ==
[[File:Puvis Doux Pays.png|thumb|right|upright=1.4|Puvis de Chavannes, ''Doux Pays'', 1882]]

In 1882 Seurat rented a small studio in the rue Chabrol close to his family’s home.&lt;ref&gt;Seurat and The Bathers. John Leighton, Richard Thompson, ''et&amp;nbsp;al'', National Gallery Publications Limited. London, 1997. isbn&amp;nbsp;1857091698. Page&amp;nbsp;14.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bathers at Asnières'' was painted in this studio, on a canvas identical in size to that part of ''A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte'' that excludes the painted border. Following the rejection of the ''Bathers'' by the jury of the Salon of 1884, Seurat joined forces with some like-minded artists to become a founder members of the ''Groupe des Artistes Indépendants''. This institution held its first exhibition—the ''Salon de Artistes Indépendants''—between May&amp;nbsp;15th and July&amp;nbsp;1st, 1884 at a temporary building in the place du Carrousel, adjacent to the Louvre.&lt;ref&gt;Seurat. John Rewald. Thames&amp;nbsp;and Hudson. London, 1990. Page&amp;nbsp;53.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bathers at Asnières'' is listed in the exhibition catalog as painting number 261, and it was displayed along with works from a total of 402 artists. Despite the fact that Seurat was a founder member of the ''Groupe'', his painting was displayed in the unglamorous location of the exhibition beer hall, and appears to have had no great impact on spectators at the exhibition. Later the same year, the Groupes des Artistes Indépendants went on became the [[Société des Artistes Indépendants]], and the ''Bathers'' was also hung at the first exhibition of the newly renamed ''Société''.&lt;ref&gt;Seurat and The Bathers. John Leighton, Richard Thompson, ''et&amp;nbsp;al'', National Gallery Publications Limited. London, 1997. isbn&amp;nbsp;1857091698. Page&amp;nbsp;124.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1886 [[Paul Durand-Ruel|Paul&amp;nbsp;Durand-Ruel]] took the picture, along with some three hundred other canvases, to the National Academy of Design in New York, where he held his exhibition of the “Works in Oil and Pastel by the Impressionists of Paris.”&lt;ref&gt;''The History of Impressionism''.

Pages&amp;nbsp;56–58.&lt;/ref&gt; The novelist and Biographer [[Paul Alexis|Paul&amp;nbsp;Alexis]] commented equivocally, ‘This is a false Puvis de Chavannes.

Page&amp;nbsp;56.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Art Amateur''’s anonymous reviewer of the New York exhibition—who even explicitly likened ''Bathers at Asnières'' to Italian fresco painting—, also called the picture a modern ‘Impressionist’ work. [[Paul Signac|Paul&amp;nbsp;Signac]] remarked that the ''Bathers'' was painted ‘… [I]n great flat strokes, brushed one over the other, fed by a palette composed, like Delacroix’s, of pure and earthy colours. By means of these ochres and browns the picture was deadened and appeared less brilliant than the works the impressionists painted with a palette limited to prismatic colours. But the understanding of the laws of contrast, the methodical separation of elements—light, shade, local colour, and the interaction of colours—as well as their proper balance and proportion gave this canvas its perfect harmony.’&lt;ref&gt;Paul Signac.

[[File:Seurat dots.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.4|[[Pointillism|Pointillistic]] retouches applied around 1887]]

Less flatteringly, an anonymous reviewer of Durand-Ruel’s Impressionist Exhibition in New York City wrote in the newspaper ''The Sun'' that, “The great master, from his own point of view, must surely be Seurat whose monstrous picture of ''The Bathers'' consumes so large a part of the Gallery&amp;nbsp;D. This is a picture conceived in a coarse, vulgar, and commonplace mind, the work of a man seeking distinction by the vulgar qualification and expedient of size. It is bad from every point of view, including his own.” This was by no means the only such uncomplimentary review in American and French newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;''The History of Impressionism''. John Rewald. The Museum of Modern Art, New York, 11&amp;nbsp;West&amp;nbsp;53&amp;nbsp;Street. Fourth, Revised Edition, 1973. {{ISBN|0-87070-369-2}}. Page&amp;nbsp;531.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Sun, April&amp;nbsp;11th,&amp;nbsp;1886.&lt;/ref&gt; But with the passage of decades, the ''Bathers'' slowly emerged into critical respectability. The critic and friend of Seurat, [[Félix Fénéon|Félix&amp;nbsp;Fénéon]] waited many years before commenting, ‘Though I did not commit myself in writing, I then [''in 1884''] completely realised the importance of this painting.‘&lt;ref&gt;''The History of Impressionism''.

Page&amp;nbsp;508.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Georges Seurat. John Rewald. New York, 1943. Page&amp;nbsp;76, note&amp;nbsp;53.&lt;/ref&gt; For many years, ''Bathers at Asnières'' remained in the possession of Seurat’s family, and in 1900 the work was purchased by Felix Fénéon.&lt;ref&gt;Seurat, Une Baignade, Asnières (The Gallery Books, No.&amp;nbsp;9). Douglas Cooper, Percy Lund Humphries&amp;nbsp;&amp;amp; Company Ltd, 12&amp;nbsp;Bedford Square. London, c.1946. Page&amp;nbsp;14.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924 it was purchased for the British national collections and hung in the [[Tate|Tate&amp;nbsp;Gallery]]. It was moved in 1961 to the National Gallery where it has remained since.&lt;ref&gt;Seurat and The Bathers. John Leighton, Richard Thompson, ''et&amp;nbsp;al'', National Gallery Publications Limited. London, 1997. isbn&amp;nbsp;1857091698. Page&amp;nbsp;8.&lt;/ref&gt;

X-ray imaging of the ''Bathers'' has revealed that some components of the composition were altered as Seurat’s work on the canvas progressed, while other components were probably not in the painting at all, as he first painted it. The two reclining figures—one at the front of the image, the other with the straw hat toward the rear—are revealed by the X-ray image to have been among the later concerns for Seurat. The reclining man at the front has had the position of his legs moved to a position more horizontal than that in which they were when first painted. The reclining figure toward the rear is not visible in the X-ray image at all, showing he is a late addition. His posture reflects the altered position of the man in the foreground, raising the suggestion that he was painted in as a compositional response to the alteration made to the man at the front. The skiff and the ferry boat with the tricolor, and the pointillistically applied spots at various locations in the lower mid-section of the painting, are also absent in the X-ray image. A contentious theory suggests that these elements were added by Seurat as a means of making a connection between the ''Bathers'' and ''A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte''. In spite of their remoteness in the middle distance, the motifs and the seated figures on the boat are present in the later painting, and the ferry boat indeed traverses the river between the Courbevoie river-bank and the ''île de la Grande Jatte'' itself. The late additions in ''Bathers'' bring for the first time a note of vitality to the serene picture in keeping with the more "sociable" climate of ''A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte''.&lt;ref&gt;Seurat and The Bathers. John Leighton, Richard Thompson, ''et&amp;nbsp;al'', National Gallery Publications Limited. London, 1997. isbn&amp;nbsp;1857091698. Pages&amp;nbsp;74,&amp;nbsp;75.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
[[File:A Sunday on La Grande Jatte, Georges Seurat, 1884.jpg|thumb|right|''[[A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte]]'', which faces the Bathers, is cast in shadow, and depicts bourgeois life, some who are hinted at being prostitutes.]]
Seurat's ''Bathers'' preceded ''[[A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte]]'', which shows people on the bank of the other side of the river. While the bathers at Asnieres on the left bank are working-class people, it is the bourgeoisie who are on the right bank. The bathers are cast in light, while on the ''Grande Jatte'' almost everyone is in shadows, and there are allusions to lust (a woman with a monkey on a leash) and prostitution (a woman "fishing"). Seurat's message has been interpreted as implying that the working class represented the future, while the middle classes had grown decrepit and ridden with vice. Seen in this light and context, the boy who bathes on the other side of the river bank at Asnières appears to be calling out to them, as if to say "we are the future, come and join us".&lt;ref&gt;BBC, ''[[The Private Life of a Masterpiece]]'' (2005) Series 4, Georges Seurat: A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Brain on Fire: My Month of Madness''''' is a 2012 [[New York Times Bestselling]] [[autobiography]] by ''[[New York Post]]'' writer [[Susannah Cahalan]].

==Synopsis==
The book narrates Cahalan's issues with [[anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis]] and the process by which she was diagnosed with this form of [[encephalitis]]. She wakes up in a hospital with no memory of the events of the previous month, during which time she would have violent episodes and delusions. Her eventual diagnosis is made more difficult by various physicians misdiagnosing her with several theories such as "partying too much" and [[schizoaffective disorder]].&lt;ref name=oprah&gt;{{cite web|last=Kahn |first=Jennifer |title=Under Attack: One Woman's Terrifying Battle With an Auto-Immune Disease |url=http://www.oprah.com/health/Susannah-Cahalan-Interview-Brain-on-Fire |publisher=Oprah |accessdate=January 8, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026000343/http://www.oprah.com/health/Susannah-Cahalan-Interview-Brain-on-Fire |archivedate=October 26, 2013 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually several physicians, including Dr. [[Souhel Najjar]], began to suspect that Cahalan was suffering from an [[autoimmune disease]].&lt;ref name=oprah/&gt; Najjar diagnosed Cahalan using a test that involved her drawing a clock, a test normally given to people suspected of having [[dementia]] or [[Alzheimer's disease]].&lt;ref name=pt&gt;{{cite web|last=Forman MD |first=Howard |title=Brain on Fire: An Interview With Susannah Cahalan on Anti–NMDA Receptor Autoimmune Encephalitis |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/film-and-book-reviews/brain-fire-interview-susannah-cahalan-anti%E2%80%93nmda-receptor-autoimmune-encephalitis |newspaper=[[Psychiatric Times]] |date=January 23, 2013 |accessdate=January 8, 2014 |archivedate=July 5, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130705110220/http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/film-and-book-reviews/brain-fire-interview-susannah-cahalan-anti%E2%80%93nmda-receptor-autoimmune-encephalitis |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than drawing the clock face normally, the disease caused Cahalan to draw all of the numbers 1 through 12 on the right face of the clock, because the right side of her brain, which regulates the left side of the body, was inflamed. Najjar used this to help diagnose Cahalan and start her road to recovery.&lt;ref&gt;Cahalan, ''Brain on Fire: My Month of Madness'', pp. 131-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book also covers Cahalan's life after her recovery, including her reactions to watching videotapes of her psychotic episodes while in the hospital. Cahalan also discusses her symptoms prior to her hospitalization, as she had previously been diagnosed by a psychiatrist with [[bipolar disorder]].&lt;ref name=oprah/&gt; While researching, she learned that the disease had only been discovered three years before she became ill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Edemariam |first=Aida |title=Brain on Fire by Susannah Cahalan - review |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jan/24/brain-fire-susannah-cahalan-review |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=January 24, 2013 |accessdate=July 7, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714231556/http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jan/24/brain-fire-susannah-cahalan-review |deadurl=no |archivedate=July 14, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her research indicated that in 2009 most people with the disease were either misdiagnosed or undiagnosed. Cahalan was fortunate to be correctly diagnosed because, according to Najjar's estimates, only 10 percent of people with the disease were properly diagnosed at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Cahalan, ''Brain on Fire: My Month of Madness'', pp. 221-27.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, a better understanding of the disease and its symptoms has resulted in more frequent diagnosis and treatment.

==Reception==
Critical reception for ''Brain on Fire'' has been mostly positive. [[NPR]] commented that the author was "a naturally talented prose stylist" and that "she perfectly tempers her brutal honesty with compassion and something like vulnerability."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schaub |first=Michael |title='Brain On Fire' Details An Out-Of-Mind Experience |url=https://www.npr.org/2012/11/14/164400198/brain-on-fire-details-an-out-of-mind-experience |work=[[NPR]] |date=November 14, 2012 |accessdate=January 8, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140720074459/http://www.npr.org/2012/11/14/164400198/brain-on-fire-details-an-out-of-mind-experience |deadurl=no |archivedate=July 20, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Washington Post]]'' praised Cahalan's researching abilities for the book, as they noted that she had to rely on information from others, including family members and medical documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Scarf|first=Maggie|title=‘Brain on Fire: My Month of Madness’ by Susannah Cahalan|date=January 12, 2013|accessdate=January 8, 2014|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/brain-on-fire-my-month-of-madness-by-susannah-cahalan/2013/01/12/d5e5ffcc-43c3-11e2-9648-a2c323a991d6_story.html|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Canyon Road''' is an art district in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], [[New Mexico]], United States,&lt;ref name="tripadvisor"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60958-d117221-Reviews-Canyon_Road-Santa_Fe_New_Mexico.html | title=Canyon Road | publisher=[[TripAdvisor]] | accessdate=July 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with over a hundred art galleries and studios exhibiting a wide range of art, including [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] art and antiquities, historical and contemporary [[Latino art]], regional art, international folk art, and contemporary art.

==History==
Canyon Road is a long, narrow road that leads to the [[Sangre de Cristo Mountains]]. It runs parallel to the [[Acequia]] Madre ("mother ditch"),&lt;ref name=inside/&gt; an irrigation  ditch dating back to 1680. Prior to Spanish arrival, the road was a footpath between the [[Santa Fe River Valley]] and [[Pecos Pueblo]].&lt;ref name=inside/&gt;

Canyon Road was once a primarily residential neighborhood.&lt;ref name=inside&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leach|first1=Nicky|title=Insiders' Guide to Santa Fe|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|location=Lanham, MD|isbn=978-0-7627-5346-8|page=122|edition=5th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=24teZxI_ULEC&amp;lpg=PA122&amp;dq=canyon%20road%20santa%20fe&amp;pg=PA122#v=onepage&amp;q=Canyon%20Road&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Houses built in the [[Pueblo Revival style]], in accordance with the local [[Spanish Colonial]] and [[Pueblo]] methods were constructed with [[adobe]] walls and courtyards, often as compounds for extended family.

Artists were drawn to its beauty, particularly the [[Los Cinco Pintores]] in the 1920s.&lt;ref name=inside/&gt; [[Olive Rush]] (1873–1966) was a prominent early Canyon Road artist who maintained a studio at 630 Canyon, which she donated to the [[Society of Friends]].&lt;ref name=inside/&gt; It is still a Quaker meeting hall today.

Over time, artists created a subculture of artist-run studios and galleries. Over time, as Santa Fe became more of a tourist destination, Canyon Road became known to the wider world.&lt;ref name="tripadvisor" /&gt;

'''''Coast Scene, Isles of Shoals''''' is a 1901 painting by [[Childe Hassam]] which is in the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/11032?sortBy=Relevance&amp;amp;ft=Childe+Hassam&amp;amp;offset=0&amp;amp;rpp=100&amp;amp;pos=61|title=www.metmuseum.org|website=www.metmuseum.org|access-date=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Done in oil on canvas in luminous colours, the painting depicts the remote Isles of Shoals off the rocky shoreline of [[New England]], a favourite haunt of Childe Hassam at the end of the 19th century and where he painted a series of similar coastal scenes.

The painting is accompanied at the Metropolitan Museum of Art by ''[[Surf, Isles of Shoals]]'', a similar work by Hassam.

The work is currently (2018) not on view.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5553">The '''Dance Music [[Hall of Fame]]''' was an organization established in 2003 to honor and remember significant contributors to the genre of [[dance music]].  It had its first inductions in 2004 but went inactive after the 2005 induction ceremony.

==History==
The Dance Music Hall of Fame was created in 2003 when music industry veteran John Parker ([[Robbins Entertainment]]) thought that something needed to be done to honor the creators and innovators of [[dance music]].  He enlisted the help of Eddie O'Loughlin ([[Next Plateau Records]]) initially and then they brought [[Daniel Glass]] (Glassworks), [[Tom Silverman]] ([[Tommy Boy Records]]) &amp; Brian Chin (noted dance music writer/historian) in to form the organization.  The Dance Music Hall of Fame recognizes the contributions of those who have had a significant impact on the evolution and development of dance music and celebrates the history and significance of the genre.

Artists, Producers, Record, Remixer and DJs that helped to shape the dance music industry become eligible for induction 25 years after their first contribution or record release.  Criteria include the influence and significance of the nominee's contributions to dance music.
The Dance Music Hall Of Fame Board of Advisers was composed of dance music professionals, historians and journalists.  When the nominees were selected the ballots were sent to an international voting committee of over 1,000 dance music experts.  An awards ceremony announcing the inductees in the Dance Music Hall Of Fame would take place annually at a formal dinner event in New York.

Due to financial differences among the Board members, The Dance Music Hall of Fame ceased operations after its second ceremony in 2005.

'''Dominique Deveraux''' (born '''Millie Cox''') is a [[fictional character]] on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[prime time]] [[soap opera]] ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]'' and its [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]], ''[[The Colbys]]''. Portrayed by [[Diahann Carroll]] from 1984 to 1987, the character is the surprise half-sister of millionaire [[Blake Carrington]] ([[John Forsythe]]). Dominique was written out of the series at the end its seventh season, and did not return for the 1991 [[miniseries]] ''[[Dynasty: The Reunion]]''.

==Original series==

===Development===
With ''Dynasty'' in its fourth season, Diahann Carroll saw the success of prime time soap operas, and noted that while they had covered many issues like rape and homosexuality, they had yet to tackle [[racial integration]].&lt;ref name="People 1984"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20087810,00.html|title=Diahann Carroll Dresses Up ''Dynasty''|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|first=Scot|last=Haller|date=May 14, 1984|accessdate=August 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Foundation"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNfz2xPMZgg|title=Foundation Interviews: Diahann Carroll discusses ''Dynasty''|publisher=EmmyTVLegends.org|date=January 20, 2011|via=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She said at the time, "I want to be the first black bitch on television."&lt;ref name="People 1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="1st Day"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D--Y-uXjZc|title=Diahann Carroll Interview: First Day on ''Dynasty'' Set|date=1984|accessdate=August 21, 2018|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/nov/05/women-television-film-oscar|title='I'm ambitious, dedicated and vain'|first=Chrissy|last=Iley|date= November 4, 2008|website=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=August 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carroll had her manager reach out to ''Dynasty'' producer [[Aaron Spelling]], but there had been no response before she and Spelling ran into each other soon after.&lt;ref name="People 1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Foundation"/&gt; [[Barbra Streisand]] had asked Carroll to sing a song from ''[[Yentl]]'' at the [[Golden Globes]] ceremony, and afterwards Carroll and Spelling found themselves at the same nightclub.&lt;ref name="People 1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Foundation"/&gt; He said, "When Diahann came in, [''Dynasty'' co-creator] [[Esther Shapiro]] and I looked at her, looked at each other and said, 'My God, she is ''Dynasty''.'"&lt;ref name="People 1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Foundation"/&gt; Carroll told Shapiro that night, "If it's not me let it be someone, because it's time."&lt;ref name="People 1984"/&gt; Spelling said,"We virtually closed the deal that night while having a drink at the bar."&lt;ref name="People 1984"/&gt;

Joining ''Dynasty'' made Carroll the only black actress with a continuing role on a nighttime serial at that time,&lt;ref name="People 1984"/&gt; and Dominique the first prominently-featured African-American character on a prime time soap opera.&lt;ref name="Newcomb Encyc"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JUzIAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Encyclopedia+of+Television+edited+by+Horace+Newcomb+dynasty&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjo5LKIvfreAhVjyVQKHdMCANcQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=dynasty&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of Television|first=Sharon R.|last=Mazzarella|editor-first=Horace|editor-last=Newcomb|chapter=''Dynasty''|date=February 3, 2014|publisher=[[Routledge]]|pages=771–773|via=Google Books|isbn=1-57958-394-6|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carroll said, "I certainly wasn't researching the number of blacks on TV, but how could you fail to see they're not there?"&lt;ref name="People 1984"/&gt; Appearing in the final two episodes of the fourth season, Carroll's estimated salary was $35,000 an episode, and she was contracted for at least 17 of season five's 29 shows.&lt;ref name="People 1984"/&gt; Shapiro said, "We wanted a part where a black could be on the same social and economic level as the other characters. The one thing we wouldn't do is put on a black woman as a victim."&lt;ref name="People 1984"/&gt; She added, "Our intention is to play the characters in 1984 with an emphasis on character, not color."&lt;ref name="People 1984"/&gt;

From the beginning, Dominique was intended as a foil for [[Alexis Colby]], the villainess played by [[Joan Collins]].&lt;ref name="People 1984"/&gt; Shapiro said, "Dominique is not out to outbitch Alexis per se."&lt;ref name="People 1984"/&gt; Collins said, "I think it is wonderful to have another fabulous 'over 40' in prime time. We have had a couple of bitch-to-bitch scenes which have been very good. And of course, no one knows better than I that in playing a bitch you don't have to be one."&lt;ref name="People 1984"/&gt; Carroll commented, "Joan and I are close enough in age and experience to realize that this is great for all of us. In the final analysis we will be good for each other."&lt;ref name="People 1984"/&gt; Willis Edwards, president of the Beverly Hills/Hollywood chapter of the [[NAACP]], said of Carroll's casting, "This is a major thing as far as we’re concerned. We've been fighting for something like this for years."&lt;ref name="People 1984"/&gt; [[Linda Evans]], who played [[Krystle Carrington]], said at the time, "I don't think the impact of her coming on the show will affect only blacks. I think it will be great for all the people who see her."&lt;ref name="People 1984"/&gt;

===Characterization===
While pursuing a role on one of the nighttime soaps, Carroll said "I want to be wealthy and ruthless".&lt;ref name="People 1984"/&gt; She said in 2011 that ''Dynasty'' producer Elaine Rich "liked the idea of [Dominique] being a bitch", and Carroll said to her, "I think the most important thing for us to remember is write for a white male, and you'll have it. We'll have the character Don't try to write  for what you think I am, write for a white man who wants to be wealthy and powerful. And that's the way we found Dominique Deveraux."&lt;ref name="Foundation"/&gt;

In a 1984 interview, Carroll said "I've never played a role quite this unlikeable. And I like that. I like that very much because I think very often, particularly minorities, it's almost required of them that they are nice people, and I don't want to play a nice person."&lt;ref name="1st Day"/&gt;

===Appearances===
Carroll originated the role of singer/businesswoman Dominique Deveraux in the 1984 episode "[[New Lady in Town (Dynasty)|New Lady in Town]]". She appeared in 71 episodes of ''Dynasty'', and seven episodes of ''The Colbys''. The character last appeared in the 1987 ''Dynasty'' season seven finale "[[Shadow Play (Dynasty)|Shadow Play]]".

To circumvent any chance the storyline would leak to the press, a number of scenes were filmed to introduce Dominique, including alternative lines revealing that she was the mother of [[Kirby Anders]] ([[Kathleen Beller]]) or the ex-wife of Alexis' former husband, [[Cecil Colby]] ([[Lloyd Bochner]]).{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Carroll was repeatedly featured rehearsing and/or performing songs in several episodes of both series.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

===Storylines===

====Season four====
Successful and wealthy chanteuse Dominique Deveraux arrives in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] in "[[New Lady in Town (Dynasty)|New Lady in Town]]" (1984) with a flourish, asking [[Fallon Carrington Colby]] ([[Pamela Sue Martin]]) questions about her mother, [[Alexis Colby]] ([[Joan Collins]]). In the next episode, the fourth season finale, Dominique wonders aloud to herself, ''"Won't it just knock their socks off when they find out I'm a Carrington?"''

====Season five====
Dominique's husband '''Brady Lloyd''' ([[Billy Dee Williams]]) arrives in Denver in the September 26, 1984 season premiere episode, "[[Disappearance (Dynasty)|Disappearance]]." He asks why Dominique is performing at La Mirage. Brady and Dominique fight when she will not tell him why she is choosing to remain in Denver. Dominique's hostility toward oil tycoon [[Blake Carrington]] ([[John Forsythe]]) is noticed by Blake's wife [[Krystle Carrington|Krystle]] ([[Linda Evans]]).

Following Fallon's memorial service in  "[[The Rescue (Dynasty 1984)|The Rescue]]", Dominique makes the shocking claim that she is the daughter of Blake's father [[Tom Carrington (Dynasty character)|Tom Carrington]] and his longtime mistress, Laura Matthews, and offers proof (found in a letter in an old trunk left in the care of Laura's sister Bessie), therefore making her Blake's half-sister. A financially strapped Blake makes a business deal with the very wealthy Dominique: Forty percent of Denver-Carrington in exchange for $70 million. This subsequently makes Dominique an enemy of Alexis, who has been scheming to destroy her ex-husband Blake. When Brady learns the truth, he is furious that Dominique didn't confide in him earlier.

As Blake's business partner, Dominique travels to [[Istanbul]] to meet with the shady Rashid Ahmed in order to help Blake obtain a confession from him. Despite this assistance, in episode 100, Blake tells Dominique that Tom denies that he is her father. Furious, Dominique instigates a lawsuit against Blake for misappropriation of company funds after Blake uses some of the money she invested in Denver-Carrington to prevent losing his mansion. However, episode 102, "[[The Will (Dynasty 1985)|The Will]]", Dominique and Blake visit their father Tom on his deathbed in [[Sumatra]]; Alexis, a favorite of Tom's, follows them. Tom meets his illegitimate daughter Dominique for the first time, and she convinces him to accept her. Tom dies, but not before including Dominique in his will, as well as making her the executor, which further infuriates Alexis (who is also a beneficiary). In episode 103, "[[The Treasure (Dynasty 1985)|The Treasure]]", Blake and Dominique discuss the matter between them and Blake finally acknowledges her as his half-sister. Dominique, in a show of gratitude, tells Blake that she has dropped her lawsuit against him. Later on, Blake summons Alexis to his office and tells her that if she persists in trying to break Tom's will, he will put his support firmly behind Dominique. Furthermore, he reiterates the fact that she is now family and that he will fight to the death for her. Alexis concedes to Blake's demands, but tells him she'll find a way to destroy Dominique regardless. Later that evening at the Carrington mansion, Blake holds a dinner gathering to formally welcome Dominique into the family. Adam goes out of his way to welcome her as well and Dominique is overcome with emotion. Later on, Amanda tells Alexis about the gathering and that she is proud to have Dominique as her new aunt, much to Alexis' annoyance. Alexis then places a call to one of her associates and orders him to find out everything he can about Dominique.

In episode 108, Dominique learns that Brady has filed for divorce and that Alexis is attempting to take over her company, Deveraux Group, Inc., after which she collapses. At the hospital Dominique learns that she needs heart surgery. She pulls through her illness and becomes closer to Blake and Krystle. Although the divorce goes through, Brady refuses to sell his shares in Deveraux Group, Inc. to Alexis, foiling the takeover. Noticing that famed photojournalist Lady Ashley Mitchell appears to have designs on Blake, she warns Ashley to keep away and advises Krystle to watch out.

Dominique is among the family guests invited to Moldavia to celebrate the wedding of her niece, Amanda, to Prince Michael, where a military coup takes place and insurgents take over the chapel and gun down the entire wedding party.

====Season six (''Dynasty'') / Season one (''The Colbys'')====
Dominique survives the wedding massacre, and rejects an offer by the rebel leader to remain in Moldavia to "entertain the troops and improve morale". Back in Denver, Dominique works with Blake on a pipeline deal with [[Jason Colby]] ([[Charlton Heston]]). She encounters Jonathan Lake ([[Calvin Lockhart]]), a state department employee, who reminds Dominique that they met years ago in Paris. Romance seems to be blossoming between the pair, but then a man from her past returns: Garrett Boydston ([[Ken Howard]]), Jason Colby's lawyer. Garrett tries to rekindle their romance, but Dominique is resistant. Years earlier, Dominique and Garrett had an affair. At the time, Garrett claimed that he was married and refused to leave his wife. Dominique is torn between the two men until she learns that Jonathan has aligned himself with Bart Fallmont, a politician who is fighting the pipeline project.

Dominique travels frequently to [[Los Angeles]], and hires [[Monica Colby]] ([[Tracy Scoggins]]) to help run her L.A.-based record company. While there, she continues to see Garrett. He cannot understand her reluctance to resume their relationship.

In episode 134, Dominique's daughter, [[Jackie Deveraux|Jackie]] ([[Troy Beyer]]) visits her mother and asks to remain in Denver instead of returning to finishing school in Lausanne, Switzerland. In episode 136, Garrett meets Jackie and is immediately convinced that he is her father. Garrett presses Dominique but she continues to deny that he is Jackie's father. Jackie, who would like to see her mother married and happy, also wonders about the true nature of their relationship. In episode 143, Jackie runs away when she learns that her father is listed as "unknown" on her birth certificate. Alexis encounters Jackie and manipulates the girl into telling her troubles. Dominique finally admits to Garrett that he is indeed Jackie's father. Jackie returns home in episode 145 and finally learns that Garrett is her father.

In episode 146, Dominique and Garrett decide to marry. In the season finale, at their engagement party Alexis reveals that Garrett was never married before. He lied in order to avoid a long-term relationship. Dominique slaps Alexis and orders her to leave. She confronts Garrett with the story who admits that he lied so many years ago. Stunned, Dominique breaks off the engagement. Her guests continue to celebrate, unaware that the wedding is cancelled — or that a fire is raging in other parts of the hotel.

====Season seven (''Dynasty'') / Season two (''The Colbys'')====
During the fire, Dominique panics when she cannot find Jackie. [[Dex Dexter]] manages to rescue Jackie, but she is badly burned. Jackie provides eye witness testimony to the cause of the fire, before leaving Denver for state-of-the-art burn treatment.

During this time, Dominique helps Blake to fight Alexis, who has taken over Blake's company with the assistance of their estranged brother, [[Ben Carrington|Ben]]. She also attempts to revive her singing career. When a bad review appears in Alexis's newspaper, Dominique goes to confront her in episode 160 and a cat fight ensues.

In episode 154, Dominique meets geologist Nick Kimball, who romantically pursues her. Dominique resists him at first, but by episode 158 she gives in to his advances and they share a passionate night together. In episode 163, Nick saves Dominique from two thugs who were sent by businessman Gary Tilden to "rough her up" after she rejected a business deal from Tilden. But Dominique is still restrained about their relationship – and draws closer to Alexis's ex-husband Dex. Nick returns in episode 173 to whisk Dominique off for a romantic weekend in San Francisco, where he proposes. While Dominique contemplates marrying Nick, Jackie returns to Denver to tell her mother that Garrett is still in love with her. In episode 175, Jackie asks Nick to break it off with Dominique. When Dominique states that she will not get back together with Garrett, a defeated Jackie leaves Denver again. In episode 176, the season finale, Dominique and Nick attend the wedding of her nephew, [[Adam Carrington|Adam]]. After the ceremony, Dominique accepts his proposal and the two leave Denver.

====Season nine====
Though not physically seen after season seven, Dominique (having revived her singing career touring Europe) is mentioned in season nine as Blake investigates the murder of Roger Grimes. Blake visits Dominique's uncle Charles Matthews, brother to her mother Laura and Aunt Bessie. Charles and his wife Jane later provide Blake with some of his father's belongings, left with them by Laura and then Bessie for safekeeping.

'''Enfants Riches Déprimés''' ({{IPA-fr|ɑ̃fɑ̃ ʁiʃ dɛpʁimɛ}}; also known as ERD) is a [[Los Angeles]] and [[Paris]] based luxury fashion brand founded by the [[conceptual art]]ist, [[Henri Alexander]] (also known as [[Henri Alexander Levy]]).
== History ==

ERD was founded in late 2012 by Henri Alexander as an [[Avant-garde]] fashion collective, in an effort to create a [[French punk]] [[streetwear]] line based on the movements of the late 1970s and [[Japan]]ese Avant-garde movements of the 1980s.

Alexander was educated at the prestigious [[Institut Le Rosey]] boarding school in [[Rolle]], [[Switzerland]], as well as various other [[boarding school]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/fashion-label-enfants-riches-deprimes-920289|title=Fashion Label Enfants Riches Deprimes Is Hollywood's Answer to Vetements|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Based on interviews with Alexander, his experiences at these boarding schools had a lasting impact on his psyche and artistic perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elle.com/fashion/celebrity-style/news/a36387/new-brand-kanye-west-enfants-riches-deprimes/|title=The Crazy Expensive Designer Kim Kardashian, Jared Leto, and Beyoncé All Love|date=2 June 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He subsequently attended [[UCLA|UCLA's]] art program in Los Angeles, wherein he further developed his concentration in [[conceptual art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.fashionnetwork.com/news/Enfants-Riches-Deprimes-the-elitist-punk-label-attracting-retailers-worldwide,765775.html|title=Enfants Riches Déprimés: the elitist punk label attracting retailers worldwide|first=FashionNetwork.com, Chenu|last=Alexis|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this program, he was mentored by prominent artists, including [[Rodney McMillian]], [[Barbara Kruger]], and [[Andrea Fraser]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://culturebox.francetvinfo.fr/mode/style-et-defiles/fashion-week/pret-a-porter-masculin-printemps-ete-2018/quatre-jeunes-createurs-etrangers-foulent-les-podiums-parisiens-pour-la-1re-fois-257903|title=Quatre jeunes créateurs étrangers foulent les podiums parisiens pour la 1re fois|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relying heavily on concepts of [[deconstruction]] and "[[Do it yourself|DIY]]," ERD has sought to revolt against the luxurious fashion world with garments of oversized proportions—juxtaposing tailored wear with brutally ripped garments.  With vintage-inspired T-shirts, leather jackets and tattered oversized sweaters, the line depicts a dichotomy between [[Haute couture|couture]] and street life.

One of the core precepts of the brand is high [[price point]]s, with T-shirts ranging from $300 to $1,000, and haute couture jackets priced as high as $95,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fox17.com/news/entertainment/lanvin-fuses-sartorial-and-street-to-cap-paris-menswear-week|title=Lanvin fuses sartorial and street to cap Paris menswear week|first=THOMAS ADAMSON, Associated|last=Press|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ERD consistently utilizes the [[business model]] of [[artificial scarcity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/style/2016/03/enfants-riches-deprimes-profile|title=The Elitist, Punk Fashion of Enfants Riches Déprimés Is Probably Not For You|website=Complex}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this regard, all styles are sold on an extremely exclusive basis, and thus in relatively small quantities.&lt;ref name="hollywoodreporter.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/enfants-riches-deprimes-founder-his-disgusting-pop-up-store-front-1021425|title=Enfants Riches Deprimes Founder on His "Disgusting" Pop-Up Storefront|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "The price point is not only a marker of value, but intrinsically part of the piece itself," Alexander remarked in a 2015 interview with [[The Guardian]]. He further noted that, "No pieces are alike and everything is limited.  I have no interest in making affordable pieces for the masses." &lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/jul/26/cashmere-nooses-and-nihilistic-luxury-enfant-riches-deprimes-punk-couture|title=Cashmere nooses and 'nihilistic luxury': Enfant Riches Déprimés' punk couture|first=Priya|last=Elan|date=26 July 2016|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consistent with this perspective, the artist further noted in a 2016 interview with [[Complex (magazine)|Complex Magazine]] that, "The best way for me to explain the brand is [[Elitism|elitist]], [[Nihilism|nihilist]] couture…The price point eliminates the masses, and the ideas eliminate the people who I don't want, generally, in it, due to the dark nature." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/style/2016/03/enfants-riches-deprimes-profile|title=The Elitist, Punk Fashion of Enfants Riches Déprimés Is Probably Not For You|website=Complex}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/jul/26/cashmere-nooses-and-nihilistic-luxury-enfant-riches-deprimes-punk-couture|title=Cashmere nooses and 'nihilistic luxury': Enfant Riches Déprimés' punk couture|first=Priya|last=Elan|date=26 July 2016|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The originality of ERD's designs has also resulted in other brands appropriating similar designs and styles, most notably [[Gucci]], [[Balmain (fashion house)|Balmain]] and [[Vetements]].  ERD has made a point to be extremely particular with respect to accepting new stockists.&lt;ref name="hollywoodreporter.com"/&gt;  Enfants reportedly informed stores in 2017 that if there is any evidence of carrying brands that copy ERD or feature "mid-level contemporary bullshit," the brand will categorically prohibit those stores from carrying the brand.

Enfants Riches Déprimés began with just a small handful of stockists in 2012.  From 2013 to 2014, the label quietly garnered a cult-like following amongst celebrities, including [[Jared Leto]], [[Kanye West]], [[Pusha T]], [[Beyoncé]], [[G Dragon]], [[Sky Ferreira]], [[Courtney Love]], [[Frances Bean Cobain]], [[Justin Bieber]], [[Guns N' Roses]], and [[Zayn Malik]].

From 2015 to 2017, Enfants Riches Déprimés has experienced significant business growth, notably with its garments being stocked by [[Barneys New York]], Maxfield, SSENSE, [[Selfridges]], [[10 Corso Como]], [[Luisa Via Roma]], and Trois Pommes.  The brand has also earned considerable artistic acclaim in the fashion world with Alexander's trailblazing and particularly confrontational and provocative designs.  These garments have catapulted the brand to an unprecedented level.

Enfants Riches Déprimés unveiled its SS18 pre-collection at [[Christie's]] Paris in June 2017, the first time in which a [[fashion house]] has shown at the historic auction house, founded in 1766.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christies.com/about-us/welcome-to-christies/about-us/|title=About Us: This History of Christie's - Christie's|website=www.christies.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The brand's official [[press release]] stated that, "the location serves as an adequate setting for a definitive moment of Enfants Riches Déprimés, in which Henri Alexander's concepts are displayed without compromise nor restraint."&lt;ref name="lagoblublog.blogspot.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lagoblublog.blogspot.com/2017/06/|title=Lago Blu Blog Fashion &amp; Lifestyle|website=lagoblublog.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Runway (fashion)|runway]] traveled through the various Matignons&lt;!--The quote is accurate. Christie's Paris is in avenue Matignon, but that doesn't help at all.--&gt; of Christie's, wherein each room was curated with Henri Alexander's paintings—a series of massive [[Valet parking|valet]] tickets and psychological process diagrams, which sought to emblematize, "violent and naïve gestures."&lt;ref name="thelovemagazine.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelovemagazine.co.uk/posts/8145/enfants-riches-deprimes-ss18-ain-t-no-use-in-crying-baby|title=Enfants Riches Déprimés SS18: Ain't no use in crying, baby - LOVE|website=LOVE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lagoblublog.blogspot.com"/&gt;  Attendees cogitated on Alexander's array of chaotic scribbles juxtaposed on his fine tailoring, as the paintings—which were on display at Christie's for days prior to the show—filled the pacing on the runway.&lt;ref name="thelovemagazine.co.uk"/&gt;

Textures of silver chains and reconfigured 18th century antique [[brooch]]es complimented SS18's suiting and [[ready-to-wear]]—thereby acting as a form of functional [[Assemblage (art)|assemblage]].  The structure of the show, "[lured] patrons into relapses of [[Neoclassicism]] and outbreaks of savagery." &lt;ref name="lagoblublog.blogspot.com"/&gt; The press release further noted that, "a story is told—a final dichotomy—with lonely [[silhouette]]s of a boy and chain—beautifully knit in collaboration with [[Loro Piana]]—peeking out between looks of spring pastels and shades of black, similar to a [[Willem de Kooning|de Kooning]]." &lt;ref name="lagoblublog.blogspot.com"/&gt;

Henri Alexander's paintings, garments, references, and setting created a prolific collage of [[Regression (psychology)|regression]], coupling luxury with the [[fine art]] function.  Alexander stated in an interview with [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] that his SS18 pre-collection allegorized, "the tragic only child of [[capitalist realism]], [[neo-Dada]]ism and the refined [[unconscious mind]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://made-to-measure-suits.bgfashion.net/article/14567/56/Enfants-Riches-Deprimes-unveils-its-Spring-Summer-2018-pre-collection#popup2|title=Enfants Riches Deprimes unveils its Spring/Summer 2018 pre collection|first=Be Global Fashion|last=Network|website=made-to-measure-suits.bgfashion.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influences ==

Enfants has taken inspiration from a variety of historical sources.  In an interview with [[V (American magazine)|V Magazine]], Henri Alexander commented that "As far as other painters I am really into [[Robert Motherwell]].  I'm envious of the scale of his work.  Also, [the work of ] [[Cy Twombly]], [[Antoni Tàpies]] and [[Jean Dubuffet]]…I find particularly appealing at this point in my life. I think those that are familiar with Tàpies' work, will see he has influenced ERD from the informality to the way he uses furniture and rags."  &lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://108.171.178.53/site/content/2949/the-video-enfants-riches-deprimes|title=V Magazine / THE VIDEO: ENFANTS RICHES DEPRIMES|first=Weird Science Studio|last=NYC|website=V Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artist has also noted being influenced by Japanese fashion designers [[Rei Kawakubo]] And [[Yohji Yamamoto]], artist [[Raymond Pettibon]], and [[punk rock]]ers [[Darby Crash]] and [[Johnny Thunders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefashionspot.com/runway-news/312315-designer-to-watch-enfants-riches-deprimes/|title=Designer to Watch: Enfants Riches Déprimés - theFashionSpot|date=23 August 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
With respect to socio-political stimuli, Alexander asserted that, "The line is essentially a result of my conflict between [[Punk subculture|punk]] influences and my entitled (wealthy [[bourgeoisie]]) upbringing and my views on it.  While it could be argued that there is a sort of glorification of what I know, there is also a strong correlation to [[Romanticism]] in that the revolt against [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] social and political norms is very present in the line in various ways." &lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Enfants Riches Déprimés has engaged in a number of collaborations over the years.  In 2012, the brand did a limited T-shirt release with Young &amp; Starving, a [[New York (state)|New York]] [[nonprofit organization]] that works to support budding artists and curators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youngandstarving.com/projects/|title=Projects|website=Young &amp; Starving}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2015, the brand collaborated with [[Vans]] to create a custom classic [[high-top|high-top sneaker]], featuring hand-drawings and "rebellious scribbling".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/09/10/fashion/A-Ralph-Lauren-Workout-Shirt-Punky-Vans-Sneakers-And-Other-Items-for-the-Fall-Shopping-List.html|title=A Ralph Lauren Workout Shirt, Punky Vans Sneakers And Other Items for the Fall Shopping List|date=10 September 2015|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; For their Fall Winter 2016 collection, ERD collaborated with the estate of [[Cy Twombly]] to create a capsule collection featuring interpretations of the late artist's polaroid works.

ERD has also had a continuing relationship with the [[contemporary art]]ist and [[architect]], Didier Faustino.  His sculpture was notably featured as the centerpiece of their Paris runway show in September 2016, which premiered the brand's Spring Summer 2017 main collection.

In early 2017, Enfants Riches Déprimés collaborated with [[Daft Punk]] for their exclusive pop-up store at Maxfield in Los Angeles. For this project, Enfants reimagined how [[Daft Punk|Daft Punk's]] merchandise would have looked during the band's nascent stages—both in terms of aesthetic and form.  The styles sought to pay homage to a bygone era of music, reflecting those raw motifs by juxtaposing photographs of the notoriously hermetic musicians onto the front of vintage-style band T-shirts and onto the back of leather couture jackets, emblazoned with [[Homework (Daft Punk album)|"Daftendirekt"]], the title of the first track on the duo's debut album, [[Homework (Daft Punk album)|Homework]].  Other styles sought to celebrate [[Daft Punk|Daft Punk's]] legendary production techniques, depicting the duo toying with their vintage [[synthesizer]]s and [[drum machines]], with the phrase "La Nouvelle Vague" plastered across the front.  The classic ERD label was also altered to the pseudonym, "Electronic Research Development."

In late 2016, Henri Alexander  was introduced to [[Kanye West]].  Directly following his release from the hospital after being admitted for [[psychological evaluation]], West was photographed in December 2016 visiting ERD's Los Angeles [[studio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pausemag.co.uk/2016/12/spotted-kanye-west-in-enfants-riches-deprimes/|title=SPOTTED: Kanye West In Enfants Riches Déprimés|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There have reportedly been rumors circulating that Alexander and West are working on a collaboration for 2017.

In July 2017, Enfants Riches Déprimés launched a [[pop-up retail|pop-up store]] at Maxfield, transforming the sprawling space into a [[pawn shop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hypebeast.com/2017/7/enfants-riches-deprimes-maxfield-gallery-pop-up-first-look|title=Exclusive: Maxfield Gallery Becomes a Pawn Shop for Enfants Riches Déprimés Pop-Up Event|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The shop featured a capsule collection of archival pieces, as well as a number of new limited edition styles.  Notably, the brand premiered its newest high-top sneaker collaboration with Vans, and an exclusive [[sunglasses]] collaboration with the Parisian [[eyewear]] designer, [[Thierry Lasry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lamag.com/culturefiles/pawn-shop-melrose/|title=Here's The Story Behind That Odd Pawn Shop on Melrose|date=24 July 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thierrylasry.com/projects/42|title=Thierry Lasry - Thierry Lasry|website=www.thierrylasry.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==

There have been a multitude of controversies surrounding the brand and its designs.  The brand has prided itself on extreme provocation, featuring Nazi insignia and obscene [[Pornography|pornographic]] images.  For instance, the brand created a T-shirt featuring [[Donald Duck]] emblazoned with a swastika giving a Nazi salute.  They also created another shirt depicting [[Mickey Mouse]], adorned with a swastika, engaging in aggressive [[sexual intercourse]] with a battered [[Minnie Mouse]].

In 2014, the brand experienced a controversy surrounding the actress [[Ashley Benson]].  In the days following actor [[Philip Seymour Hoffman|Philip Seymour Hoffman's]] [[drug overdose]] and death, the actress tweeted an anti-drug warning to her [[Twitter]] fans.   On the same day, she was photographed wearing ERD's DJ Heroin T-shirt.  This image sparked considerable backlash against her for the audaciously contradictory and distasteful move.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2555462/Ashley-Benson-wears-DJ-Heroin-shirt-tweeting-anti-drug-message-following-Philip-Seymour-Hoffmans-death.html|title=Ashley Benson wears a T-shirt emblazoned with 'DJ Heroin'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, Enfants has gained infamy through the creation of controversial accessories, including but not limited to [[narcotic]] spoons and [[Hangman's knot|hangman's nooses]].   Commenting on the noose, Alexander stated that, "I make pieces for myself, not for other people, not for the consumer…If you were going to kill yourself, wouldn't you want to do it with a $7,000 cashmere noose?"&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

[[File:Parepa-Rosa, Euphrosyne, 1836-1874.jpg|upright|thumb|Euphrosyne Parepa-Rosa]]
'''Euphrosyne Parepa-Rosa''' (7 May 1836 – 21 January 1874) was a British [[opera]]tic [[soprano]] who established the [[Carl Rosa Opera Company]] together with her husband [[Carl Rosa]]. Parepa's [[Boyars of Wallachia and Moldavia|aristocratic father]] died soon after her birth, and her mother turned to the stage to support them. Parepa made her operatic debut in 1855, at age 16, and soon earned enthusiastic reviews in the major London opera houses. In 1867, the widowed Parosa married the violinist and conductor Carl Rosa in New York and founded an opera company with Parepa as the leading lady; they toured successfully in America for several years. After their return to Britain with ambitious plans for their opera company, Parepa fell ill and died in 1874 at only 37 years of age.

==Early life and career==
[[File:Parepasculpture.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Bust of Parepa-Rosa at the [[Royal Academy of Music]]]]
Euphrosyne Parepa was born in [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, to the [[soprano]] Elisabeth Seguin (b. 1812, sister of [[Bass (voice type)|basso]] Arthur Edward Seguin) and the [[Boyars of Wallachia and Moldavia|Wallachian boyar]] Demetrius Parepa, Baron Georgiades de Boyescu of [[Bucharest]].&lt;ref name=Illustrated&gt;"Madame Parepa-Rosa", ''[[Illustrated London News]]'', 7 February 1874, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; Her father died when Parepa was an infant, leaving her young mother impoverished. Parepa's mother turned to the stage to support her child and herself and trained the girl in singing.&lt;ref name=NYtimesobit&gt;{{citation|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C07EFDB173BEF34BC4B51DFB766838F669FDE|title=Obituary: Euphrosyne Parepa-Rosa| publisher=[[The New York Times]]| date=23 January 1874|accessdate=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her operatic début was in 1855 at the age of 16 in [[Malta]] as Amina in ''[[La Sonnambula]]'', followed by engagements in Italy, Spain and Portugal. She gave her first London performance at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]], in the role of Elvira in ''[[I Puritani]]'', with the [[Royal Italian Opera]] company, with whom she spent the 1857 season.&lt;ref name=Grove&gt;Rosenthal, Harold and Elizabeth Forbes. [https://doi.org/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.20896 "Parepa(-Rosa), Euphrosyne (De Boyescu, Parepa)"], Grove Music Online, 20 January 2001, accessed 22 May 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The Royal Italian Opera company held their 1856–57 season at the Lyceum because the [[Royal Opera House]] was being remodeled after a fire. See Obituary: "Madame Parepa Rosa", ''[[The Times]]'', 23 January 1874, p.&amp;nbsp;10&lt;/ref&gt; The critic of ''[[The Observer]]'' wrote of this introduction: "Parepa possesses a soprano voice of excellent quality and remarkable compass. She acts and sings well. Her version of "''Son vergine vezzosa''" elicited applause terminating in a recall, and … [after the ''finale''] she was again called for. … '''"Qui la voce"''' … was correctly and brilliantly executed; and the ''artiste'' was again summoned back to the stage to receive the homage of the audience."&lt;ref&gt;"Royal Italian Opera: First Appearance of Mdlle. Parepa", ''[[The Observer]]'', 25 May 1857, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1859 to 1865, she appeared in opera at both [[Royal Opera House]] in [[Covent Garden]] and at [[Her Majesty's Theatre]], becoming known for such roles as Leonora in ''[[Il trovatore]]'', Zerlina in ''[[Fra Diavolo]]'' and Elvira in ''[[La muette de Portici]]''.&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt; During this time, she participated in two operatic premieres, creating the title role in [[Alfred Mellon]]'s ''Victorine'' in 1859 and the role of Mabel in [[George Alexander Macfarren]]'s opera ''Helvellyn'' in 1864. She also was a successful [[oratorio]] and concert soloist, in constant demand in Britain and beyond.&lt;ref name=NYtimesobit/&gt; She sang with [[Charles Santley]] at the opening of the [[Oxford Music Hall]] in 1861, appeared before the [[Royal Philharmonic Society]] in [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]]'s ''[[Paradise and the Peri]]'' and participated in the 19th-century English revival of the music of [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]], performing at the Handel festivals of 1862 and 1865, and in Germany.&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Elkin. ''Royal Philharmonic'', Ryder: London (1946), p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriages and later years==
Her first husband, Army Captain H. de Wolfe Carvelle, died in Peru in 1865, sixteen months after their wedding.&lt;ref name=NYtimesobit/&gt; She travelled to the United States in 1865 with cornetist Levy and violinist [[Carl Rosa]], the latter of whom she married in New York City in 1867.&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt; Together they quickly established the Parepa-Rosa English Opera Company there, featuring her as the leading soprano, which became popular, and which introduced opera to places in America that had never staged it before. They opened at the [[Fourteenth Street Theatre|French Theatre on Fourteenth Street]], New York City, in September 1869 with a performance of [[Michael William Balfe|Balfe]]'s opera ''The Puritan's Daughter'', with Parepa singing the title role. The subsequent tour of the eastern and midwestern states included a repertoire that ranged from ''[[The Bohemian Girl]]'' and ''[[Maritana]]'' to Weber's ''[[Der Freischütz]]'' and ''Oberon''.&lt;ref name=Carl&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.carlrosaopera.co.uk/history/uk-ushistory.asp|title=The Carl Rosa Opera Company: American and British History|publisher=Carl Rosa Company Ltd|accessdate=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1870, the Parepa-Rosa Opera Company returned to Britain and then appeared in Italian opera at [[Cairo]], Egypt, followed by a return to America for another successful tour in 1871–72.&lt;ref name=Carl/&gt; In 1872, Parepa sang at the [[Lower Rhine Festival]] in [[Düsseldorf]], and they then returned to London, where she sang Donna Anna in ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' and the title role in ''[[Norma (opera)|Norma]]'' at the Royal Opera House.&lt;ref name=Illustrated/&gt;&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt; In September 1873, the company changed its name to [[Carl Rosa Opera Company|Carl Rosa's English Opera]], since Parepa was pregnant.&lt;ref name=Carl/&gt;

Parepa died in London, after an illness, at the age of 37 while preparing to sing Elsa in an English version of [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'' as part of her husband's planned season a [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]]; after her death, Rosa cancelled the season.&lt;ref name=Illustrated/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Obituary: "Madame Parepa Rosa", ''The Times'', 23 January 1874, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; She is buried at [[Highgate cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;Legge, R. H., revised by J. Gilliland. [https://doi.org/10.1093/ref:odnb/21264 "Rosa, Euphrosyne Parepa (''née'' Euphrosyne Parepa de Boyesku or Boyescu)"], ''Oxford [[Dictionary of National Biography]]'', 23 September 2004, accessed 22 May 2018&lt;/ref&gt; After her death, Rosa endowed the Parepa-Rosa Scholarship at the [[Royal Academy of Music]] in her memory.&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt;

William Winter wrote that "Great vocal powers have seldom found such ample or such touching expression as those of Parepa-Rosa did in the first act of ''[[Norma (opera)|Norma]]''.  … [O]ne of her best successes was made as Rosina in ''[[The Barber of Seville]]'' ... to indicate the versatility of her talents and the scope and thoroughness of her culture."&lt;ref&gt;Winter, William.

'''Feather tights''' is the name usually given by art historians to a form of costume seen on [[Late Medieval]] depictions of angels, which shows them as if wearing a body suit with large scale-like overlapping downward-pointing elements representing feathers, as well as having large wings.  Other sources use '''feathered angels''' to describe the style. The style is assumed to derive from actual costumes worn by those playing angels in medieval religious drama, with the "feathered" elements presumably flaps or [[lappet]]s of cloth or leather sewn onto a body suit.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (1964), 168; Plate 10.1 [https://books.google.com/books?id=GgsSKtb9iRwC&amp;pg=PA144 here shows a modern production at York] attempting to recreate the effect, sadly with very baggy suits.&lt;/ref&gt;  The feathers on angels in art can often to be seen to stop abruptly at the neck, wrists and ankles, sometimes with a visible hemline, reflecting these originals.&lt;ref&gt;As for example on the Holy Thorn Reliquary; Tait 43&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mary Magdalene's hair suit''' is another iconographic feature, with a background in hagiographic legend, whose depiction apparently borrows from religious drama.

Historians of English churches tend to refer to the feather tights style as 15th century, and by implication essentially English,&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (1964), 167-168&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= fowler&gt;{{cite book | last = Fowler | first = Harold North | title = A History of Sculpture | year =2005 | location = | publisher = Kessinger | isbn = 978-1-4179-6041-5 |page =237 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it can be seen in several major late medieval European works from the late 14th to early 16th centuries.  These include the [[Holy Thorn Reliquary]] in the [[British Museum]], made by a court goldsmith in Paris in the 1390s,&lt;ref&gt;Tait, 43&lt;/ref&gt; and on two wooden angels from South Germany around 1530 ([[Museum Kunstpalast]] [[Düsseldorf]], right), as well as two stone ones hovering over the ''[[Lamentation of Christ]]'' by [[Tilman Riemenschneider]] at [[Maidbronn]] (1526), and others on [[Veit Stoss]]'s wooden [[altarpiece]] at [[Bamberg Cathedral]] (1520–23).&lt;ref&gt;Mellinkoff, 22; Kahrsniz and Bunz, 405&lt;/ref&gt;  There is also a figure with greenish-black feathers, in [[Matthias Grünewald]]'s [[Isenheim Altarpiece]] of 1515.&lt;ref&gt;Russell; until Mellinkoff's book largely on this figure, he was often taken to be the [[Archangel Michael]], as [https://books.google.com/books?id=gQvRh-Z1cfEC&amp;pg=PA167 here]&lt;/ref&gt;

The "devil in his feathers" featured in the [[Chester Midsummer Watch Parade]] as late as the 1590s, provided by the butcher's [[guild]]; these parades had originally used the costumes from the [[Chester Plays]],&lt;ref&gt;F.

(Norwich or Durham?)" in the "3rd quarter of the 14th century".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/record.asp?MSID=8780&amp;CollID=28&amp;NStart=1894 Egerton Genesis Picture Book] or MS Egerton 1894, British Library; see Joslin, Mary Coker and Carolyn Coker Joslin Watson.

It is believed that this practice arose from medieval [[liturgical drama]]s and [[mystery play]]s, in which the actors portraying angels wore garments covered with feathers to emphasize their power of flight,&lt;ref name = coe/&gt; often standing on "clouds" of wool.&lt;ref name= anderson&gt;{{cite book | last = Anderson | first = Mary Désirée | title = The Medieval Carver | year = 1935 | location = | publisher = Cambridge University Press | isbn = |language =  |page = 85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Costumed angels also might be introduced for one-off special occasions: at the coronation of Henry VII's queen, [[Elizabeth of York]], in 1487 an angel swinging a large [[censer]] was lowered from the roof of [[Old St Paul's]], and at the marriage of their son [[Arthur, Prince of Wales|Arthur]] to [[Catherine of Aragon]] in 1501, the [[archangel Raphael]] was part of the ceremony, with "goldyn and glyteryng wingis and ffedyrs of many and sundry colours".&lt;ref&gt;Roof angels&lt;/ref&gt;

The feathering might be used as a substitute for other clothing, or under [[vestment]]s or [[Saint Michael]]'s armour.&lt;ref name= rush&gt;{{cite book | last = Rushforth | first =Gordon McNeil  | title = Medieval Christian imagery: as illustrated by the painted windows of Great Malvern Priory Church, Worchestershire, together with a description and explanation of all the ancient glass in the church | year = 1936 | location = | publisher = The Clarendon Press | isbn = |language =  |page = 25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Feathered tights are not to be confused with the feathers of the extra pairs of wings traditionally attributed to [[cherubim]] and other higher [[Christian angelic hierarchy|orders of angels]], which are often shown pointing downwards covering the legs.

==Mary Magdalene's hair suit==
[[File:Mary Magdalene 01.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of altarpiece by [[Jan Polack]], c. 1500]]
A similar depiction of the penitent [[Mary Magdalene]] appears in some Southern German works around mostly 1500, but with body hair rather than feathers. The earliest may be in the scene of Mary's last [[Holy Communion]] in [[Lucas Moser]]'s Altar with scenes from the life of the Magdalene in [[Tiefenbronn]], from 1432.  [[Tilman Riemenschneider]]'s carved figure in the [[Münnerstadt]] Altar (1490-1492), now [[Bayerisches Nationalmuseum]], Munich is the best known.  According to medieval legend the Magdalene had spent a period of repentance as a desert hermit after leaving her life as a prostitute and her life as a follower of Jesus. Her story became conflated in the West with that of [[Saint Mary of Egypt]], a 4th-century prostitute turned hermit, whose clothes wore out and fell off in the desert.  In earlier medieval depictions Mary's long hair entirely covers her body and preserves her modesty, but in these her hair is more naturalistic and does not do so.&lt;ref&gt;Witcombe, 279, 282; Johnston, 92-93&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead she has a coat of hair somewhat like a dog's, ending rather neatly at the neck, wrists and ankles, suggesting derivation from a theatrical costume, as with the feather suits. The suits, which are mainly consistent in depiction, do not cover her breasts or knees, or sometimes elbows.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, 92-93&lt;/ref&gt;  The bare patches on the knees and elbows probably are meant to have been worn bare by Mary praying on her knees, resting her elbows on a rock ledge, as she is often shown in later paintings of the Penitent Magdalen. The lack of hair on the breasts presumably follows the pattern of body hair typical of mammals and familiar to late medieval Germans from farm animals such as sheep and cattle.

Most such images depict the "Ascension" or ''Elevation of Mary Magdalene'', showing the regular visits of angels to Mary's desert home (actually in [[Provence]] in the South of France according to the legend) to raise her into the air and feed her heavenly food.  In the words of [[William Caxton]]'s English translation of the ''[[Golden Legend]]'': 
&lt;blockquote&gt;...the blessed Mary Magdalene, desirous of sovereign contemplation, sought a right sharp desert, and took a place which was ordained by the angel of God, and abode there by the space of thirty years without knowledge of anybody. In which place she had no comfort of running water, ne solace of trees, ne of herbs. And that was because our Redeemer did do show it openly, that he had ordained for her refection celestial, and no bodily meats. And every day at every hour canonical she was lifted up in the air of angels, and heard the glorious song of the heavenly companies with her bodily ears. Of which she was fed and filled with right sweet meats, and then was brought again by the angels unto her proper place, in such wise as she had no need of corporal nourishing.&lt;ref&gt;"Life of Mary Magdalen", [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/goldenlegend/GoldenLegend-Volume4.asp#Mary%20Magdalene "Life of Mary Magdalen"], [[William Caxton]]'s ''[[Golden Legend]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Moser's altar shows the scene of her last [[Holy Communion]] after her return to the world and just before her death, as recounted in the ''Golden Legend'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;... [Saint [[Maximin of Trier|Maximinus]]] saw the blessed Mary Magdalene standing in the quire or choir yet among the angels that brought her, and was lift up from the earth the space of two or three cubits. And praying to our Lord she held up her hands, and when S. Maximin saw her, he was afraid to approach to her. And she returned to him, and said: Come hither mine own father, and flee not thy daughter. And when he approached and came to her, as it is read in the books of the said S. Maximin, for the customable vision that she had of angels every day, the cheer and visage of her shone as clear as it had been the rays of the sun. And then all the clerks and the priests aforesaid were called, and Mary Magdalene received the body and blood of our Lord of the hands of the bishop with great abundance of tears, and after, she stretched her body tofore the altar, and her right blessed soul departed from the body and went to our Lord.&lt;ref&gt;Caxton, as previous passage quoted&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[relief]] panels on the inside of the shutters of the Münnerstadt Altar show four scenes from the life of Mary Magdalene, with her covered in body hair in the last two, showing her last Communion and burial (these are still in the church).&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, 93-95; [[:File:Münnerstadt, St Maria Magdalena 008.JPG|Image, also with replica main statue]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

After watching children’s TV with her young daughter, [[Geena Davis]] noticed that the large majority of television shows lacked a large amount of female characters. This inspired her to think critically about what American media showed to young children; and to eventually investigate the role of gender in media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/geena-davis-institute-on-gender-and-media-feminism-1201610886/|title=Geena Davis Makes Women the Center of Attention With Her Institute|last=Saval|first=Malina|date=2015-10-06|work=Variety|access-date=2017-04-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; She realized the importance of the female representation in children’s shows, as these representations can impact how young girls see themselves. &lt;ref name="sarasotamagazine.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sarasotamagazine.com/articles/2017/2/13/geena-davis-gender-quality|title=Geena Davis Is On a Mission for Gender Equality in the Media|publisher=|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Davis wanted to focus on television shows, films, and other media outlets that are intended for children under 11, as these are formative years for one’s identity.&lt;ref name="seejane.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://seejane.org/about-us/|title=About Us - See Jane|publisher=|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After conducting research on this type of entertainment, Davis found that three times more men than women appear in children’s television shows and films.The research also showed that characters in the workplace were 80.5% male and only 19.5% female.&lt;ref&gt; Marechal, AJ. “Davis Institute Tracks Gender Gaps in Media.” Salem State University , 23 Sept. 2011&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref name="seejane.org"/&gt; Davis studied "[[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|122 G, PG, and PG-13 films]] theatrically-released between 2006 and 2009.” &lt;ref name="seejane.org1"&gt;https://seejane.org/wp-content/uploads/full-study-gender-disparity-in-family-films-v2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, she found that “only 29.2% of all speaking characters are female,” and these women are more sexualized than the men.&lt;ref name="seejane.org1"/&gt; As “children are engaging with media up to 7-10 hours/day,” the representation of women in children’s television shows and films has a major impact on how young girls believe they should act and how they view themselves.&lt;ref name="seejane.org"/&gt; Davis subsequently founded the eponymous Institute in 2004.
At its core, the Geena Davis Institute believes that, too often, the media “sidelines, hypersexualizes, or simply omits” women, particularly in movies and television.&lt;ref name="sarasotamagazine.com"/&gt;

Geena Davis was motivated to start her foundation because of her Academy Award Nominated role in [[Ridley Scott|Ridley Scott’]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s [[Thelma &amp; Louise|Thelma and Louise]], the 1991 film that she had said changed her life. When the film was released to overwhelming acclaim it made her realize just how few opportunities there were to see empowered female characters on screen, and it inspired her to establish her institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/mar/06/how-geena-davis-became-a-champion-for-women-on-screen|title=How Geena Davis became a champion for women on screen|last=Spring|first=Alexandra|date=2017-03-06|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davis said that throughout her career she consciously chose roles that would empower women and girls. She acknowledges that this was a luxury because she “hasn’t run out of money yet” and added that if she ever appeared as [[Sean Connery]]’s comatose wife, “about right, by Hollywood standards” - we should know she’s broke.

== Mission ==
Davis says the Institute targets the entertainment industry rather than the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21737490-furore-hollywood-will-result-different-stories-making-it-screen|title=The aftermath of the Weinstein scandal|website=The Economist|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It seeks to increase diversity in casting and advocates for equal representation of women in media.  For example, Davis cited research by the Institute that 17% of people in crowd scenes are women.  Using her connections in the industry, Davis takes these statistics to media executives to educate them about the poor representation of women in media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2016/05/geena-davis-on-fighting-for-more-roles-for-women.html|title=Geena Davis on Fighting for Female Representation in Hollywood and the Golden Age of Roles for Women|last=Hunt|first=Stacey Wilson|work=[[Vulture.com]]|date=2016-05-04|accessdate=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children's entertainment is a primary focus of the Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/women-in-leadership/2015/mar/19/geena-davis--sexism-wasnt-present-in-what-w-show-kids|title=Geena Davis: 'I just assumed sexism wasn't present in what we show kids'|last=O'Conor|first=Lottie|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=2015-03-19|accessdate=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute is the only research-based organization working within the media to exchange, educate, influence, and expound on the need for gender balance, and, it is a leading voice to create a wide variety of roles for females in the entertainment industry.  The Institute is against stereotyping of female characters, and it furthers calls for roles that empower women rather than denigrate them. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2014/9/geena-davis-study-press-release.|title=Geena Davis study press release|work=UN Women|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Davis’ thoughts about the Gender Gap ==
Davis states, “The fact is women are seriously underrepresented in nearly all sectors of society across the globe, not just on screen, but, for the most part, we are simply not aware to this reality, and media images exert a powerful influence in perpetuating our unconscious bias” &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

One of the reasons that impelled Davis to start her foundation was personal experience with Hollywood’s sexist treatment of older women. Davis says, “Film roles really did start to dry up when I got into my 40’s. If you look at [[IMDb|IMDB,]] up until that age I made roughly one film a year. In my entire 40’s, I made one movie, [[Stuart Little (film)|Stuart Little.]]” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bustle.com/articles/158839-the-geena-davis-institute-is-helping-women-in-hollywood-but-not-all-of-them.|title=Geena Davis Is Fighting For Women In Hollywood|last=Atkinson|first=S.|work=Bustle|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research impact ==
The Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media has garnered several notable accomplishments concerning their research. As an Institute, they have cultivated one of the largest repositories of research around the intersection of gender and media for the past 25 years.

The Institute has engaged in several large scale research projects concerning the current conditions for women in mass media. In addition, the Institute collaborates with several other non-profits and for-profit corporations in order to highlight their feelings on the need to reform the way that women are represented in popular culture. Contributors to the Institute include scientists, non-profit coordinators, business leaders, as well as those involved in producing and acting in media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://seejane.org/about-us/|title=About Us - See Jane|work=See Jane|access-date=2017-04-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the Institute, along with the [[Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences Foundation]], established a $5000 award for diversity in children's animation created by college students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2010/tv/news/geena-davis-institute-tv-acad-unveil-kid-s-award-1118025704/|title=Geena Davis Institute, TV Acad unveil kid’s award|last=Levine|first=Stuart|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=2010-10-14|accessdate=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current partnerships ==
The Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media has teamed-up with several multi-national corporations to achieve their goal of informing media consumers about the current state of women in popular culture. Recently, the Institute has partnered with Ford and several [[YouTube]] stars to create a video series entitled #ShesGotDrive. The partnership between [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and the Institute seeks to highlight several stories of women content creators overcoming significant challenges. Thus far, the campaign has featured [[Taryn Southern]], Yulin Kang, and [[Clara Chung|Clara C]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bustle.com/p/geena-davis-partners-with-ford-to-fight-unconscious-gender-bias-in-media-its-a-hugely-important-cause-36389|title=Geena Davis Partners With Ford For #ShesGotDrive|first=Jordana|last=Lipsitz|publisher=|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of this campaign is to highlight the power of women in media and inspire other women to follow their dreams. In addition, the campaign seeks “to fight unconscious gender bias in media.” &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
The Institute has also teamed up with the [[Girl Scouts of the USA|Girl Scouts of the United States of America]] (GSUSA) to create a program entitled Girls’ Fast Track Races. With this program, girls construct their own race cars. The program was created in order to foster learning of automobile engineering in young women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/geena-davis-institute-and-ford-teamed-up-for-this-inspiring-video-series-promoting-gender-equality/|title=Geena Davis Institute and Ford Teamed Up for This Inspiring Video Series Promoting Gender Equality|access-date=2017-04-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, in 2016, the Institute received a 1.2 million dollar grant from [[Google]]. Using this grant, the Institute developed the Geena Davis Inclusion Quotient (or GD-IQ). The GD-IQ is an algorithm that can quickly scan a feature-length film to detect gender differences in representation. The Institute believes that the GD-IQ will significantly improve the Institute’s research of on-screen gender disparities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/15/movies/geena-davis-inclusion-quotient-research.html|title=How Long Is an Actress Onscreen?

In addition to its partnerships with several for-profit corporations, the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media has also partnered with a number of non-profit organizations in order to further the institute’s goal of generating equal representation for women in media. The institute has partnered with the [[United Nations]]; and founder Geena Davis is a chair on the California Commission on the Status of Women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fccfoundation.org/press-release/academy-award-winning-actor-and-activist-geena-davis-to-speak-at-fund-for-women-and-girls-luncheon-april-9/|title=Academy Award-winning actor and activist Geena Davis to speak at Fund for Women and Girls luncheon April 9 - Fairfield County's Community Foundation|work=Fairfield County's Community Foundation|access-date=2017-04-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significant studies ==
The Institute has completed several large studies around the representation of gender in media. One larger study was conducted over gender roles in popular culture, including topics such as the disparity between speaking roles for men and women; and what type of roles men and women were shown as portraying on screen. The Institute conducted this research by analyzing several blockbuster films from [[2008 in film|2008]] and concluded that gender roles are stereotyped in popular culture. A second larger study was conducted over the impact that gender plays in both on screen media as well as behind the scenes of media production. The Geena Davis Institute investigated and discovered that in the film industry, only 8% of directors are women, coupled with 19% of producers and 13.6% of writers. Several other studies conducted by the institute concern additional issues regarding gender and media including gender disparity in media across several countries as well as the portrayal of gender in films specifically marketed to young girls and families.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://seejane.org/research-informs-empowers/|title=Research Informs &amp; Empowers - See Jane|work=See Jane|access-date=2017-04-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Each year, the institute studies female representation in entertainment and publishes their findings &lt;ref name="sarasotamagazine.com"/&gt; Through this study, the institute hopes that bringing the facts about media representation to the public’s attention will bring positive change for female representation in the media. In 2015, the institute studied the top 100 grossing films of [[2014 in film|2014]] and [[2015 in film|2015]] and found that, overall, women spoke less than men and received less screen time in films. &lt;ref name="seejane.org2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://seejane.org/research-informs-empowers/data/|title=Geena Davis Inclusion Quotient - See Jane|publisher=|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the study also found that “women had a particularly strong presence in the comedy and action genres,” and cites women like [[Tina Fey]] and [[Melissa McCarthy]] as a couple of the year’s leading ladies.&lt;ref name="seejane.org2"/&gt; Yet even with female leads like Fey and McCarthy, out of the 100 films, only “11% featured a female lead.”&lt;ref name="seejane.org2"/&gt;  Even though films featuring a female lead made up less than a quarter of the top 100 grossing films, “films led by women grossed 15.8% more on average than films led by men.” &lt;ref name="seejane.org2"/&gt;

In 2016, the organization found that there were increasingly more female leads in movies than ever before. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://screencrush.com/gender-equality-initiative-reframe/|title=Major Hollywood Execs Launch Campaign to End Gender Inequality|website=ScreenCrush|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;A separate study exemplifies the influence of female leads: after the release of films like [[The Hunger Games (film)|The Hunger Games]] and [[Brave (2012 film)|Brave]], both of which feature female archers as leads, the number of young girls participating in archery greatly increased.&lt;ref&gt;https://seejane.org/wp-content/uploads/hitting-the-bullseye-reel-girl-archers-inspire-real-girl-archers-short.pdf &lt;/ref&gt; According to Davis, “68% of the film companies they’ve worked with have changed two or more of their projects” to include more female representation. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/michelleking/2017/04/03/geena-davis-is-creating-opportunities-for-women-in-hollywood-by-tackling-gender-bias/4/#496be8474b71|title=Geena Davis Is Creating Opportunities For Women In Hollywood By Tackling Gender Bias|first=Michelle|last=King|publisher=|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bentonville Film Festival ==
In addition to many of their research contributions, the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media also created the Bentonville Film Festival. Davis founded the [[Bentonville Film Festival]] with Trevor Drinkwater. Films that are in the Bentonville film festival are guaranteed distribution, a move that Davis says will fix the disproportionate number of women creators in Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/bentonville-film-festival-to-offer-more-diversity-in-2016-says-geena-davis-1201579283/|title=Bentonville Film Festival to Offer More Diversity in 2016, Says Geena Davis|last=Saval|first=Malina|date=2015-08-27|work=Variety|access-date=2017-04-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The yearly festival is held in [[Bentonville, Arkansas|Bentonville]], Arkansas.Nearly 100 films are showcased at the growing festival.The festival also has concerts with various artists each year. In 2018 country singers Carly Pearce and Lauren Alaina performed as well as Jillian Jacqueline, [[Vintage Trouble|Vintage Troube]] and Fifth Harmony's [[Ally Brooke]]&lt;ref&gt;https://5newsonline.com/2018/05/01/bentonville-film-festival-kicks-off-drawing-celebrities-to-northwest-arkansas/&lt;/ref&gt;.

He was an [[academic painter]] and one of the founders of the [[Neo-Grec]] school, along with his close friends [[Gustave Boulanger]], [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]], and [[Jean-Louis Hamon]], also academic painters. All of them studied in the workshops of both [[Hippolyte Delaroche|Paul Delaroche]] and later [[Marc-Charles-Gabriel Gleyre|Charles Gleyre]]. Picou's style was noticeably influenced by Gleyre. While the rest of the group generally painted classical and mythological subjects, Picou also received commissions for large religious frescoes from many churches, including the [[Église Saint-Roch]].&lt;ref name="safran"&gt;{{cite web

His artistic debut was at the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] in 1847. The next year he was awarded a second-class medal for his  painting, ''Cléopâtre et Antoine sur le Cydnus''. Also known as ''Cleopatra on the Cydnus'', it is commonly regarded as Picou's masterpiece. This showing at the Salon in 1848 was written about by the critic [[Théophile Gautier]], who felt that the subject matter was too ambitious, but also said that "As it is, it gives the best hope for the future of the young artist, and ranks among the seven or eight most important paintings of the Salon."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Picou maintained a large workshop in Paris on the [[Boulevard de Magenta]], which provided him room to work on his expansive frescoes. His popularity continued to rise and he went on to win the Second [[Prix de Rome]] in 1853 for his painting, ''Jésus chassant les vendeurs du Temple'' (''The Moneylenders Chased from the Temple''), and another second-class medal for his Salon painting in 1857.

In [[art history]], the '''High Renaissance''' is a short period of the most exceptional artistic production in the Italian states, particularly [[Rome]], capital of the [[Papal States]], during the [[Italian Renaissance]].  Most art historians state that the High Renaissance started around 1495 or 1500 and ended in 1520 with the death of Raphael, although some say the High Renaissance ended about 1525, or in 1527 with the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|Sack of Rome]] by the army of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]], or about 1530 (see next section for specific art historians’ positions).  The best-known exponents of painting, sculpture and architecture of the High Renaissance include [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Raphael]] and [[Bramante]]. In recent years, the use of the term has been frequently criticized by some academic art historians for oversimplifying artistic developments, ignoring historical context, and focusing only on a few iconic works.&lt;ref&gt;Marcia Hall, “Classicism, Mannerism and the Relieflike Style” in ''The Cambridge Companion to Raphael'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of Term==
[[Image:Giorgione, The tempest.jpg|thumb|right|[[Giorgione]]'s ''[[The Tempest (Giorgione)|Tempest]]'', c. 1507-8.]]
The term "High Renaissance" was first used by [[Jacob Burckhardt]] in German (''Hochrenaissance'') in 1855&lt;!-- ARE WE SURE ABOUT THIS DATE? - very early --&gt; and has its origins in the "High Style" of painting and sculpture of the time period around the early 16th century described by [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] in 1764.&lt;ref&gt;Jill Burke, "[http://www.ashgate.com/pdf/SamplePages/Rethinking_the_High_Renaissance_Intro.pdf Inventing the High Renaissance from Winckelmann to Wikipedia: an introductory essay]", in: ''Id.'', [http://www.ashgate.com/default.aspx?page=637&amp;calcTitle=1&amp;title_id=10751&amp;edition_id=11076 ''Rethinking the High Renaissance: Culture and the Visual Arts in Early Sixteenth-century Rome''], Ashgate, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;.  Extending the general rubric of [[Renaissance]] culture, the visual arts of the High Renaissance were marked by a renewed emphasis upon the classical tradition, the expansion of networks of [[patronage]], and a gradual attenuation of figural forms into the style later termed [[Mannerism]].

==Time Period==
Alexander Raunch in "The Art of the High Renaissance and Mannerism in Rome and Central Italy", 2007&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Raunch "Painting of the High Renaissance and Mannerism in Rome and Central Italy" in ''The Italian Renaissance: Architecture, Sculpture, Painting, Drawing'', Konemann, Cologne, 1995. Pg. 308&lt;/ref&gt;, states the High Renaissance began in 1490, while [[Marilyn Stokstad]] in ''Art History'', 2008, states it began in the 1490s.&lt;ref&gt;Marilyn Stokstad ''Art History'', Third Edition, Pearson Education Inc., New Jersey, 2008, Pg 659.&lt;/ref&gt; Frederick Hartt states that da Vinci’s the ''Last Supper'', the painting of which began in 1495 and concluded in 1498, makes a complete break with the Early Renaissance and created the world in which Michelangelo and Raphael worked&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Hartt, ''A History of Art: Painting, Sculpture, Architecture''; Harry N. Abrams Incorporated, New York, 1985, pg. 601&lt;/ref&gt; while Christoph Luitpold Frommel, in his 2012 article "Bramante and the Origins of the High Renaissance," states the ''Last Supper'' is the first High Renaissance work but adds that the peak period of the High Renaissance was actually 1505 to 1513.&lt;ref&gt;Christoph Luitpold Frommel, "Bramante and the Origins of the High Renaissance" in ''Rethinking the High Renaissance:  The Culture of the Visual Arts in Early Sixteenth-Century Rome'', Jill Burke, ed. Ashgate Publishing, Oxan, UK, 2002, pg. 172.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[David Piper]] in ''The Illustrated History of Art'', 1991, also cites the ''Last Supper'' writing the work announced the High Renaissance and was one of the most influential paintings of the High Renaissance, but contradictorily states that the High Renaissance began just after 1500.&lt;ref&gt;David Piper, ''The Illustrated History of Art'', Crescent Books, New York, 1991, pg. 129&lt;/ref&gt;  Burchkardt stated the High Renaissance started at the close of the 15th century,&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Burchhardt, '' Cinerone'' 1841.&lt;/ref&gt; while Franz Kugler, who wrote the first "modern" survey text, ''Handbook of Art History'' in 1841, and [[Hugh Honour]] and [[John Fleming (art historian)|John Fleming]] in ''The Visual Arts: A History'', 2009, state the High Renaissance started at the beginning of the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Franz Kugler ''Handbook of Art History'' 1841; Franz Kugler ''Handbook of Art History'' 1841.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Honour and John Flemming,''The Visual Arts: A History'', 7th edition, Laurence King Publishing Ltd., Great Britain, 2009, pg. 466&lt;/ref&gt;  Another seminal work of art which was created in the 1495-1500 timeframe was Michelangelo's the [[Pietà (Michelangelo)|Pietà,]] housed in [[St. Peter's Basilica]], [[Vatican City]], which was executed in 1498-99. 

In contrast to most of the other art historians, Manfred Wurdram, in ''Masterpieces of Western Art'', 2007, actually states that the dawn of the High Renaissance was heralded by da Vinci’s ''Adoration of the Magi'' of 1481, for which only the underpainting was completed.&lt;ref&gt;Mandred Wundrum, "Renaissance and Mannerism" in ''Masterpieces of Western Art'', Tashen, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

As far as the end of the High Renaissance is concerned Hartt, Frommel, Piper, Wundrum and Winkelman all state that the High Renaissance ended in 1520 with the death of Raphael.  Honour and Fleming stated the High Renaissance was the first quarter of the 16th century meaning it would have ended in 1525.  By contrast, Luigi Lanzi, in his ''History of Italian Painting'', 1795-96, stated it ended with the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|Sack of Rome]] in 1527.&lt;ref&gt;Luigi Lanzi,''History of Italian Painting'', 1795-96.&lt;/ref&gt; when several artists were killed and many other dispersed from Rome, and Stokstad agrees. Raunch asserts that 1530 has been considered to be the end of the High Renaissance.  [[Frederick Hartt|Hartt]] adds that 1520 to 1530 was a transition period between the High Renaissance and Mannerism.

==Architecture==
[[Image:Tempietto05.jpg|thumb|right|Bramante's [[Tempietto]], designed 1502, San Pietro in Montorio, Rome.]]
{{Main|Renaissance architecture}}
High Renaissance style in architecture conventionally begins with [[Donato Bramante]], whose [[Tempietto]] at S. Pietro in Montorio at Rome was begun in 1510. The Tempietto,  signifies a full-scale revival of ancient [[Roman architecture|Roman commemorative architecture]]. David Watkin writes that the Tempietto, like Raphael's works in the Vatican (1509–11), "is an attempt at reconciling Christian and humanist ideals".&lt;ref&gt;D. Watkin, A History of Western Architecture, 4th ed., Watson Guptill (2005) p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting==
The High Renaissance of painting was the culmination of the varied means of expression&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Wundrum "Renaissance and Mannerism" in ''Masterpieces of Western Art'', Tashen, 2007. Page 147&lt;/ref&gt; and various advances in painting technique, such as linear perspective,&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Raunch "Painting of the High Renaissance and Mannerism in Rome and Central Italy" in ''The Italian Renaissance: Architecture, Sculpture, Painting, Drawing'', Konemann, Cologne, 1995. Pg. 308; Wundrum Pg. 147&lt;/ref&gt; the realistic depiction of both physical&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Hartt and David G. Wilkins, ''History of Italian Art: Painting, Sculpture, Architecture'', 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  and psychological features,&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 309&lt;/ref&gt; and the manipulation of light and darkness, including tone contrast, [[sfumato]] (softening the transition between colours) and [[chiaroscuro]] (contrast between light and dark),&lt;ref&gt;Wundrum pg. 148; Hartt and Wilkins&lt;/ref&gt; in a single unifying style&lt;ref&gt;Wundrum pg. 147; Hartt and Wilkins&lt;/ref&gt; which expressed total compositional order, balance and harmony.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Hartt, ''A History of Art: Painting, Sculpture, Architecture''; Harry N. Abrams Incorporated, New York, 1985, pg. 601; Wundrum pg. 147; Marilyn Stokstad ''Art History'', Third Edition, Pearson Education Inc., New Jersey, 2008. Pg 659&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the individual parts of the painting had a complex but balanced and well-knit relationship to the whole.&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad, Pg. 659&lt;/ref&gt; Painting of the High Renaissance is considered to be the absolute zenith of western painting&lt;ref&gt;Wundrum pg. 145 &lt;/ref&gt; and achieved the balancing and reconciliation, in harmony, of contradictory and seemingly mutually exclusive artistic positions, such as real versus ideal, movement versus rest, freedom versus law, space versus plane, and line versus colour.&lt;ref&gt;Wundrum pg. 147&lt;/ref&gt;  The High Renaissance was traditionally viewed as a great explosion of creative genius, following a model of art history first proposed by the Florentine [[Giorgio Vasari]]. 

The paintings in the Vatican by [[Michelangelo]] and [[Raphael]] are said by some scholars such as Stephen Freedberg to represent the culmination of High Renaissance style in painting, because of the ambitious scale of these works, coupled with the complexity of their composition, closely observed human figures, and pointed iconographic and decorative references to [[classical antiquity]], can be viewed as emblematic of the High Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Freedberg, _Painting of the High Renaissance in Rome and Florence, 2 vols., Cambridge MA; Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Even relatively minor painters of the period, such as [[Fra Bartolomeo]] and [[Mariotto Albertinelli]], produced works that are still lauded for the harmony of their design and their technique. The elongated proportions and exaggerated poses in the late works of [[Michelangelo]], [[Andrea del Sarto]] and [[Correggio]] prefigure so-called [[Mannerism]], as the style of the later Renaissance is referred to in art history.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

The serene mood and luminous colours of paintings by [[Giorgione]] and early [[Titian]] exemplify High Renaissance style as practiced in [[Venice]]. Other recognizable pieces of this period include [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' and [[Raphael]]'s ''[[The School of Athens]]''. Raphael's fresco, set beneath an arch, is a virtuoso work of perspective, composition and ''[[disegno]]''.

In more recent years, art historians have characterised the High Renaissance as a movement as opposed to a period, one amongst several different experimental attitudes towards art in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth century. This movement is variously characterised as conservative;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Nagel, "Experiments in Art and Reform in Italy in the Early Sixteenth Century", in Kenneth Gouwens and Sheryl E. Reiss eds., ''The Pontificate of Clement VII: History, Politics, Culture'', Ashgate 2005, 385–409&lt;/ref&gt; as reflecting new attitudes towards beauty;&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Cropper, "The Place of Beauty in the High Renaissance and its Displacement in the History of Art", in Alvin Vos ed., ''Place and Displacement in the Renaissance'', 1995, 159–205&lt;/ref&gt; a deliberate process of synthesising eclectic models, linked to fashions in literary culture;&lt;ref&gt;David Hemsoll, 'The conception and design of Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling: 'wishing to shed a little light upon the whole rather than mentioning the parts', in Jill Burke ed., ''Rethinking the High Renaissance'', Ashgate, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and reflecting new preoccupations with interpretation and meaning .&lt;ref&gt;Jill Burke, '[http://oaj.oxfordjournals.org/content/29/1/77.short Meaning and Crisis in the Early Sixteenth Century: Interpreting Leonardo's Lion', ''Oxford Art Journal'', 29, 2006, 77–91]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sculpture==
[[File:Michelangelo's Pieta 5450 cropncleaned edit.jpg|thumb|right|[[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[Pietà (Michelangelo)|Pietà]]'', 1498–99.]]
High Renaissance sculpture, as exemplified by [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[Pietà (Michelangelo)|Pietà]]'' and the iconic ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'', is characterized by an "ideal" balance between stillness and movement. High Renaissance sculpture was normally commissioned by the public and the state, this becoming more popular for sculpture is an expensive art form. Sculpture was often used to decorate or embellish architecture, normally within courtyards where others were able to study and admire the commissioned art work. Wealthy individuals like cardinals, rulers and bankers were the more likely private patrons along with very wealthy families; Pope Julius II also patronized many artists. During the High Renaissance there was the development of small scale statuettes for private patrons, the creation of busts and tombs also developing. The subject matter related to sculpture was mostly religious but also with a significant strand of classical individuals in the form of tomb sculpture and paintings as well as ceilings of cathedrals.

'''Jorma Juhani Panula''' (born 10 August 1930, [[Kauhajoki]]) is a Finnish conductor, composer, and teacher of conducting. He has mentored many notable Finnish conductors, such as [[Esa-Pekka Salonen]], [[Mikko Franck]], [[Sakari Oramo]], [[Jukka-Pekka Saraste]], and [[Osmo Vänskä]]. 
==Career==
Panula studied church music and conducting at the Sibelius Academy. His teachers included [[Leo Funtek]], [[Dean Dixon]], [[Albert Wolff (conductor)|Albert Wolff]] and [[Franco Ferrara]]. Apart from conducting, he has composed a wide variety of music. His operas ''[[Jaakko Ilkka]]'' and the ''River Opera'' established a new genre called "performance opera", which fused music, visual art and the art of daily life. Panula's other compositions include [[Musical theatre|musical]]s, church music, a violin concerto, jazz capriccio and numerous pieces of vocal music.

Panula was the artistic director and chief conductor of the [[Turku Philharmonic Orchestra]] from 1963 to 1965, the [[Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra]] from 1965 to 1972 and the [[Aarhus Symphony Orchestra]] from 1973 to 1976. He has also conducted his own opera ''[[Jaakko Ilkka]]'' at the [[Finnish National Opera]].

Panula has served as Professor of Conducting at the [[Sibelius Academy]] in [[Helsinki]] from 1973 to 1994 and at the [[Royal College of Music in Stockholm]] and the [[Royal Danish Academy of Music]] in [[Copenhagen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Cori Ellison|title=Making Maestros for the World|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E02E1DD143FF931A15751C0A96E958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all|work=New York Times|date=22 February 1998|accessdate=1 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

As a pedagogue, Panula has been a teacher and mentor to many Finnish conductors, including [[Esa-Pekka Salonen]], [[Mikko Franck]], [[Sakari Oramo]], [[Jukka-Pekka Saraste]], and [[Osmo Vänskä]].  &lt;ref&gt;''[[Reader's Digest]]'' (Finland), November 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; 

He has taught conducting courses all over the world, such as in Paris, London, Amsterdam, Moscow, New York, Tanglewood, Aspen, Ottawa and Sydney. He has limited his podium appearances greatly during the past ten years. Panula was listed as one of the "60 most powerful people in music" featured in the November 2000 issue of ''BBC Music Magazine''. Panula was awarded the [[Rolf Schock Prize]] in 1997.{{cn|date=November 2017}} He conducted the Helsinki City Symphony Orchestra in the première in December 1971 of the [[Symphonies (Sallinen)|first symphony]] by [[Aulis Sallinen]].&lt;ref name="Novellocat"&gt;Aulis Sallinen, Catalogue, January 1987, Novello, London, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, Panula caused controversy in a Finnish television interview with remarks that denigrated the ability of women to conduct particular composers, and that women were suited to conducting music that was "feminine enough", such as [[Debussy]], but that they were unsuited for conducting [[Bruckner]]. He stated that "women [conductors]… Of course they are trying! Some of them are making faces, sweating and fussing, but it is not getting any better – only worse!... It’s not a problem – if they choose the right pieces. If they take more feminine music... This is a purely biological question.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicaltoronto.org/2014/04/05/editorial-cbc-classical-music-gender-gap-article-poses-new-questions/|title=Editorial: CBC Classical music gender gap article poses new questions|first=Michael|last=Vincent|date=5 April 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other conductors, such as his former student Salonen, responded critically to Panula's remarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Mia Paavonen|title=Jorma Panulan rajut kommentit naiskapellimestareista saavat täystyrmäyksen|url=http://www.iltasanomat.fi/musiikki/art-1288672000192.html|work=Ilta Samonat|date=31 March 2014|accessdate=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was released on [[DVD]] by {{ill|Éditions Montparnasse|fr|Éditions Montparnasse}}, as part of a boxset, also including ''[[Misafa Lesafa]]'' ([[2004 in film|2004]]) and ''[[Traduire]]'' ([[2011 in film|2011]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|url=http://www.editionsmontparnasse.fr/p1358/Nurith-Aviv-Coffret-DVD|people=[[Nurith Aviv|Aviv, Nurith]]|title=''Nurith Aviv (Coffret 3 DVD)''|location=Paris|publisher=[[:fr:Éditions Montparnasse|Éditions Montparnasse]]|language=French|accessdate=18 June 2017|format=DVD|oclc=650587091|date=18 May 2011|id=3346030022979}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Synopsis==
The film, the second in a trilogy, containing ''[[Misafa Lesafa]]'' ([[2004 in film|2004]]) and ''[[Traduire]]'' ([[2011 in film|2011]]), deals with what became of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], the [[sacred language]] of the Jews for two millennia, that became a living language on the creation of the State of [[Israel]] in 1948. The film continues the reflection begun in the director's previous film, ''[[Misafa Lesafa]]'' ([[2004 in film|2004]]), which films writers and artists recounting the conflicting relationship that they themselves experienced between their parents' language and the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=3 February 2012|script-title=he:לדבר קולנועית: ראיון עם הבמאית והצלמת נורית אביב|trans-title=Speaking Film: An Interview with Director and Cinematographer [[Nurith Aviv]]|last=Anderman|first=Nirit|url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/gallery/cinema/1.1632553|language=Hebrew|work=[[Haaretz]]|location=Tel Aviv|publisher=[[M.

'''''Las Hilanderas''''' ("The Spinners") is a painting by the Spanish painter [[Diego Velázquez]], housed in the [[Museo del Prado]] of [[Madrid]], [[Spain]]. It is also known by the title ''The Fable of Arachne''.  It is usually regarded as a late work by the artist, dating from around 1657. 

Traditionally, it was believed that the painting depicted women workers in the tapestry workshop of Santa Isabel.  In 1948, however, Diego Angula observed that the iconography suggested Ovid's Fable of [[Arachne]], the story of the mortal Arachne who dared to challenge the goddess [[Athena]] to a weaving competition and, on winning the contest, was turned into a spider by the jealous goddess. This is now generally accepted as the correct interpretation of the painting.

[[File:Velázquez - La Fábula de Aracne o Las Hilanderas (Museo del Prado, 1657-58).jpg|thumb|The painting as previously displayed before additions not by Velásquez were masked from view]]
It was painted for Don Pedro de Arce, huntsman to [[Philip IV of Spain|King Philip IV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La légende d'Arachné|url=http://www.cineclubdecaen.com/peinture/peintres/velazquez/arachne.htm|accessdate=20 February 2013|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It entered the royal collection in the eighteenth century, and was probably damaged by the fire at the [[Royal Alcazar of Madrid]] in 1734. New sections were added at the sides (37 cm in total) and over 50 cm to the top of the canvas.  The painting remains at the extended size but is currently (in November 2013) displayed behind a screen with a frame added over a cut-away section revealing only the original dimensions.

Stylistic elements, such as the lightness, the economical use of paint, and the clear influence of the Italian [[Baroque]], have led many scholars to assert that it was painted in 1657. Others place it earlier, at some time between 1644–50, perhaps because certain aspects of its form and content recall the [[bodegon]]es Velázquez painted in his early career.

In ''Las Hilanderas'', Velázquez developed a layered composition, an approach he had often used in his earlier bodegones, such as the ''[[Kitchen Scene with Christ in the House of Martha and Mary (Velázquez)|Kitchen Scene with Christ in the House of Martha and Mary]]''. In the foreground is the contest. The goddess Athena, disguised as an old woman, is on the left and Arachne, in a white top facing away from the viewer, is on the right. Three helpers assist them. In the background, a raised platform (perhaps a stage) displays the finished tapestries. The one visible to us is Arachne's, showing [[Europa (mythology)|The Rape of Europa]] — another Greek myth. This is in fact a copy of [[Titian]]'s painting of the subject, which was in the Spanish royal collection. 

The painting has been interpreted as an allegory of the arts and even as a commentary on the range of creative endeavor, with the fine arts represented by the goddess and the crafts represented by Arachne.  Others think that Velázquez' message was simply that to create great works of art, both great creativity and hard technical work are required. Other scholars have read political allegories into the work and interpreted it through popular culture.

'''''Liberty Displaying the Arts and Sciences''''' (1792) is an [[Oil painting|oil-on-canvas painting]] by [[Visual arts of the United States|American artist]] [[Samuel Jennings (artist)|Samuel Jennings]].

The [[Library Company of Philadelphia]], a private [[lending library]] founded by [[Benjamin Franklin]] in the mid-18th century, [[Commission (art)|commissioned]] Jennings (an ex-Philadelphian relocated to [[London]]) to create a work depicting "the [[Liberty (goddess)|figure of Liberty]] (with her cap and proper Insignia) displaying the arts" as a representation of [[slavery]] and a symbol of the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] movement.

Jennings's painting shows a [[blond]], [[White people|white]] Goddess of Liberty (with a [[Phrygian cap|liberty cap]] on a [[pike (weapon)|pike]] or [[spear]]) presenting books (the catalog of the Library Company, and two others, labeled "[[philosophy]]" and "[[agriculture]]") to three grateful, supplicant blacks (freed slaves). Surrounding the four figures, in the foreground, are various symbols of [[knowledge]] and [[learning]]: a [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]], a scroll (labeled "[[geometry]]"), papers and [[column]]s ([[architecture]]); a [[globe]] ([[geography]]), a [[lyre]] and [[sheet music]] ([[music]]), and a paper with [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheons]] on it ([[history]] and [[heraldry]]). In the background, former slaves are dancing and celebrating around a [[liberty pole]]; behind them are ships on a [[body of water]].

The work is the earliest American painting extant celebrating [[Abolitionism in the United States|emancipation]].

[[eSports|Esports]] are [[video games]] which are played in professional competitions, usually fall into a few major [[video game genre|genres]]. The majority of esports titles are [[fighting game]]s, [[first-person shooter]]s (FPS), [[real-time strategy]] (RTS), or [[multiplayer online battle arena]] games (MOBA), with the MOBA genre being the most popular in terms of participation and viewership. The following is a selection of games which currently have or had a professional scene, sorted by genre and ordered roughly chronologically.

==Fighting games==
{{see also|Fighting game community}}
[[Fighting game]]s were among the earliest games to be in tournaments, with the founding of what would become the [[Evolution Championship Series]] in 1999.&lt;ref name="evoHistory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5054856/fighting-to-play-the-history-of-the-longest-lived-fighting-game-tournament-in-the-world|title=Fighting to Play: The History of the Longest Lived Fighting Game Tournament in the World|date=2008-06-10|author=Brian Crecente| publisher=Kotaku|accessdate=10 Sep 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Competitions in the genre are generally individual competitions with both players providing input to the same machine. The genre originally focused on arcade play, but has gradually moved to console play as arcades have declined. The ''[[Street Fighter]]'' series, ''[[The King of Fighters]]'' series, ''[[Mortal Kombat]]'' series, ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom (series)|Marvel vs. Capcom]]'' series, ''[[Tekken]]'' series, ''[[Killer Instinct (series)|Killer Instinct]]'' series and ''[[Super Smash Bros. (series)|Super Smash Bros.]]'' series are amongst those fighting games played at a professional level. Important tournaments for the genre include the [[Evolution Championship Series]] and [[Capcom Cup]], [[Tougeki – Super Battle Opera]] was a major tournament for several years.&lt;ref name="momentumMatters"&gt;{{cite web|last=Graham|first=David Philip|title=Guest Editorial – Momentum Matters: A Historical Perspective on the FGC and Esports|url=http://shoryuken.com/2011/12/12/guest-editorial-momentum-matters-a-historical-perspective-on-the-fgc-and-esports-communities-2/|publisher=Shoryuken.com|date=December 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fighting game enthusiasts generally prefer the moniker "competitive gaming", and often eschew the term "e-sports", citing cultural differences between the predominantly PC-gaming esports communities and the older arcade-gaming community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Where eSports Leagues Go Wrong With Fighters|url=http://shoryuken.com/2011/12/04/where-esports-leagues-go-wrong-with-fighters/|publisher=Shoryuken.com|date=December 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the fighting game community are generally especially cognizant of their cc to the old arcade-era competitions, wishing to prioritize the preservation the spirit of those competitions over simple monetization of fighting competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esfiworld.com/fgc-intro-pt/|title=An introduction to the FGC Part 1: An overview|author=Jeremy Speer|date=21 Feb 2013|publisher=ESFI World|accessdate=10 Sep 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Please do not add Shrek SuperSlam as a notable fighting game due to the lack of notability in the mainstream FGC. Only list fighting games that have been in the following US-based FGC run events (Combo Breaker, SoCal Regionals, NorCal Regionals, any Big E event, Final Round, The Fall Classic, CEO, EVO); remember to source information --&gt;

===''Street Fighter''===
The ''[[Street Fighter]]'' has one of the earliest and longest running professional gaming scenes.&lt;ref name="evoHistory" /&gt;

Professional ''Street Fighter'' players include [[Daigo Umehara]],  who had two of his matches included in a 2011 [[Kotaku]] list of "The 10 Best Moments in Pro-Gaming History". His early 1998 match against American player [[Álex Vallejo|Alex Valle]] in ''[[Street Fighter Alpha 3]]'' ranked sixth and [[Evo Moment 37|his 2004 comeback]] against American player [[Justin Wong]] in ''[[Street Fighter III: Third Strike]]'' ranked first, while his 2009 grand finals match against Wong in ''[[Street Fighter IV]]'' at [[Evolution Championship Series|Evo 2009]] was listed as having "[j]ust missed the cut."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Breslau|first=Rod|title=The 10 Best Moments in Pro-Gaming History|url=http://kotaku.com/5820907/the-10-best-moments-in-pro+gaming-history|publisher=Kotaku|accessdate=17 April 2012|date=July 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Super Smash Bros.''===
{{main|Professional Super Smash Bros. competition}}
[[Nintendo]]'s ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series has a large [[professional Super Smash Bros. competition|competitive community]]. While every title has been featured in high-profile tournaments, ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'' and ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Wii U]]'' are the most popular for high level competition as of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailydot.com/esports/smash-bros-wii-u-melee-esport/|title=Will Wii U's 'Smash Bros.' win over the 'Melee' crowd?|first=Imad|last=Khan|date=June 13, 2014|website=The Daily Dot|accessdate=January 27, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213063959/http://www.dailydot.com/esports/smash-bros-wii-u-melee-esport/|archivedate=February 13, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major League Gaming regularly sponsored ''Melee'' events from 2004 to 2007, before dropping it in favor for the 2008 sequel ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]''. According to Major League Gaming, over 400 ''Super Smash Bros. Brawl'' competitive tournaments were held in 2010 in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.majorleaguegaming.com/news/super-smash-brothers-thriving-across-the-country|title=Super Smash Bros. Thriving Across the Country|publisher=[[Major League Gaming]]|author=Lish|date=2011-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, ''Melee'' has again been periodically hosted at MLG events, with the latest being [[MLG 2015 World Finals]]. ''Smash Wii U'' had an online contest sponsored by ESL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://play.eslgaming.com/new-games/wiiu/news/258468|title=Super Smash Bros. (Wii U) on ESL Play!|publisher=[[ESL Gaming]]|author=Chexx|date=July 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable national tournaments to feature ''Smash'' games include [[Apex (tournament series)|Apex]] and [[Evolution Championship Series]] (EVO). At EVO 2016, ''Smash Wii U'' became the largest ''Smash'' tournament ever with 2,662 entrants.

===''Marvel vs. Capcom''===
''[[Marvel vs. Capcom]]'' (MvC) is a fighting game series developed by [[Capcom]] that features characters from Capcom games and [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] comic book characters. The series was played at the Evolution Championship Series from 2000 until 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usgamer.net/articles/a-fight-for-the-agesthe-history-of-evo|title=A Fight for the Ages: The History of EVO|publisher=US Gamer|access-date=2017-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Tekken''===
[[Namco]]'s ''[[Tekken]]'' series is known as the lightning chess of fighting games, having a large player base in Asian countries. Over the years Tekken has been cited as the most technical among fighting games. Praised for its balance, strong basics, depth and one of the few fighting games to feature a real 3D design, it continues to be featured in various championships. The "Master cup" series of Japan, "Final round" series of U.S.A, "Strongstyle" series of U.S.A, "UT" championship series of Europe are a few examples of events that are, or started off as exclusive Tekken events, and still hold it as a main game. The "King of Iron Fist Tournament" is a Tekken only tournament hosted by Namco themselves. Apart from this, other shows such as "Tekken Crash", "Tekken Strike" are Tekken only shows held in South Korea on the E-sports channel "Nice Game T.V". Tekken has made it periodically into the Evo Championship series, and since 2013 has become a permanent part of the event. Although it has a lesser player-base in the west, it seems to be steadily rising. In the east it dominates the arcade scene today leaving other games of its genre miles behind.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===''Killer Instinct''===
The ''[[Killer Instinct (series)|Killer Instinct]]'' series is a combo-heavy franchise created by [[Rare (company)|Rare]] and currently maintained by [[Iron Galaxy Studios]] and [[Microsoft Studios|Microsoft]]. The franchise' most-played game is the 2013 [[Killer Instinct (2013 video game)|Killer Instinct]] reboot, with the platform of choice being [[Xbox One]]. A circuit for the game has been created called the [[Killer Instinct World Cup]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alexander|first1=Brandon|title=Ultra Arcade Announces Killer Instinct World Cup for 2016, $10,000 Prize Pool Guaranteed|url=http://www.ultraarcade.com/2014/12/28/ultra-arcade-announces-killer-instinct-world-cup-for-2016-10000-prize-pool-guaranteed/|website=Ultra Arcade|accessdate=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a second iteration ending in early 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jebailey|first1=Alex|title=Killer Instinct World Cup 2017 Season Announcement|url=https://www.ultra-combo.com/killer-instinct-world-cup-2017-season-announcement/|website=Ultra Combo|accessdate=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Killer Instinct's best player is Jonathan "Rico Suave" Deleon, who currently holds the [[Evolution Championship Series#2015|EVO]] and Killer Instinct World Cup titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EVO 2015: Rico Suave Wins Killer Instinct Championship with Fulgore|url=http://www.gametribute.com/4436/evo-2015-rico-suave-wins-killer-instinct-championship-with-fulgore/|website=Game Tribute|accessdate=2016-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jurek|first1=Steven|title=Rico Suave wins Killer Instinct World Cup|url=http://www.dailydot.com/esports/rico-suave-killer-instinct-world-cup/|website=Daily Dot|accessdate=2016-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, Ultra Arcade enforced a ban on [[taunting]] and [[teabagging]] in [[Killer Instinct World Cup|major Killer Instinct tournaments]] which sparked controversy among the [[fighting game community]] with some stating that it is considered impossible to enforce due to certain players' playstyles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Orland|first1=Kyle|title="Teabagging" will get you banned from a major Killer Instinct tournament|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/01/teabagging-will-get-you-banned-from-a-major-killer-instinct-tournament/|website=[[Ars Technica]]|accessdate=2017-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yin-Poole|first1=Wesley|title=Fighting game community in a flap over Killer Instinct teabagging ban|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-01-24-fighting-game-community-in-a-flap-over-killer-instinct-teabagging-ban|website=[[Eurogamer]]|accessdate=2017-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First-person shooters==
[[First person shooters]] focus on simulating a [[shootout|firefight]] from a first person perspective, and may be either individual or team based. Classic games include the PC game ''[[Team Fortress 2]]'', which is featured in a few smaller leagues such as the [[ESEA League]], RGL&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Recharge Gaming League |url=hl.rgl.gg |website=RGL.gg |accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, United Gaming Clans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ugcleague.com/|title=UCG League|accessdate=23 Sep 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and European Team Fortress 2 League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etf2l.org/|title=European Team Fortress 2 League|accessdate=23 Sep 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Call of Duty]]''&lt;ref name="Call of Duty"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2012/11/call-of-duty-esports/|title=Why Pro Gamers Don’t Play Call of Duty|first=RYAN |last=RIGNEY|website=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=November 14, 2012|accessdate=August 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Halo'' competitions usually play their console editions.

=== ''Doom'' ===
Doom is a series of multiplayer 1v1 and free-for-all deathmatch games developed by [[id Software]]. Doom is notable for establishing the arena-style deathmatch format, and also was partially responsible for the first online FPS community through DWANGO, an online gaming service officially endorsed and partially worked on by id Software. People also played Doom deathmatch online through other BBS services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.doom2.net/history/history.html#Old_School|title=Doom2 Deathmatch History|last=BahdKo|website=www.doom2.net|access-date=2018-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Doom (1993 video game)|The Ultimate DOOM]] and [[Doom II|''Doom II,'']] alongside [[Heretic (video game)|Heretic]], were played in the Deathmatch '95 tournament, sponsored by [[id Software]], [[Microsoft]], and [[DWANGO]]. This tournament, perhaps the first PC esports tournament of its kind, was played through the online DWANGO service. Finalists from the US and the UK were flown to Microsoft headquarters to compete in a LAN party format event, named Judgement Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/DWANGO+to+Host+World's+Largest+Deathmatch+Tournament;+Final+Showdown...-a017453687|title=DWANGO to Host World's Largest Deathmatch Tournament; Final Showdown Played on id Raven Software's Latest Computer Game, HEXEN--Beyond Heretic, at Microsoft's "Judgment Day" Party. - Free Online Library|website=www.thefreelibrary.com|access-date=2018-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dennis Fong]], best known for his victory at the [[Red Annihilation]] tournament for [[Quake (video game)|''Quake'']], won Judgement Day, marking his first entry into esports. Doom II was also played in [[Cyberathlete Professional League]] and [[QuakeCon]] tournaments.

''[[Doom 3]]'' featured a 1v1 mode which was played professionally at [[QuakeCon#2004|QuakeCon 2004]], [[QuakeCon#2005|QuakeCon 2005]], and [[Cyberathlete Professional League#2004|CPL Winter 2004]], but was ultimately replaced by ''[[Quake 4]]'' and ''[[Painkiller (video game)|Painkiller]]''.

===''Quake''===
Quake is a series 1v1 PC based games developed by [[id Software]]. In 1996, id released the original [[Quake (video game)|Quake]], and launched [[QuakeCon]]. QuakeCon is an annual convention which hosts competitions for the series, and has become the largest LAN event in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/gallery/quakecon-in-pictures-north-americas-biggest-lan-party-hits-dallas/|title=QuakeCon in pictures: North America's biggest LAN party|publisher=PC Gamer|author=Ian Birnbaum|date=6 Aug 2013|accessdate=15 Oct 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first offline ''Quake'' tournament, [[Red Annihilation]] took place in May 1997. The winner, [[Dennis Fong]], going under the alias "Thresh", took home the prize of ''Quake'' co-creator [[John D.

The ''[[Counter-Strike]]'' series is a series of team based first person shooters which began as a ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' [[Game mod|mod]] which was bought by [[Valve Corporation|Valve]] and released from beta in 2000. Professional competition is centered in [[North America]] and [[Europe]] in tournaments such as the [[World Cyber Games]], CEVO, [[ESEA League]], [[Intel Extreme Masters]], [[Cyberathlete Professional League]] and the [[Electronic Sports League]]. The defunct league [[Championship Gaming Series]] franchised teams with contracted players who played ''[[Counter-Strike: Source]]''.

''Counter Strike'' is consistently at competitions such as [[DreamHack]] and [[World Cyber Games]] as the 1.6 version released in 2003, despite newer versions having been released by Valve over the years.&lt;ref name="Call of Duty" /&gt;

The most recent game in the series, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, was released in August 2012. Although ''Counter-Strike'' did not appear in the World Cyber Games 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hltv.org/news/10813-no-counter-strike-at-wcg-2013 |title=No Counter-Strike at WCG 2013 |publisher=HLTV.org | date=14 Jun 2013 | accessdate=30 Jun 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the largest prizepool in the series' history has been announced for ELEAGUE, with $1.4 million USD.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hltv.org/?pageid=357&amp;eventid=2135&lt;/ref&gt;

Tournaments usually have a large number of unknown teams competing to play with the top pro teams. A well known example is [[OpTic Gaming]], who have earned hundreds of thousands of dollars from competing in leagues and tournaments.

===''Unreal Tournament''===
Beginning with the release of the first game in 1998, the ''[[Unreal Tournament]]'' series of first person shooters supported competitions in the early 2000s, such as the series' inclusion the World Cyber Games from 2001 through 2004.&lt;ref name=WCG /&gt; There are no longer major tournaments for the series, as it has been dropped from leagues such as the [[Electronic Sports League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esl.eu/eu/ut3/news/205465/|title=Unreal Tournament 3: Sorry, we're CLOSED|publisher=Electronic Sports League|accessdate=4 Nov 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]'' series has been featured in the American [[Major League Gaming]] since the release of Halo: Combat Evolved for the original Xbox.

The decline had continued into late 2013/2014 where Halo 4 had been introduced and was an even bigger change to the series than Halo: Reach, and as a result had no major competitive events held, other than the Halo 4 World Championships, which was put on by developer 343 Industries as an early attempt to save Halo esports. 343 Industries later released Halo: The Master Chief Collection, re-releasing all 4 original titles in 60fps, but featuring a completely remastered version of Halo 2 to use as the primary game for halo esports. Although this was a good attempt by the developer to bring back the dying community, the game suffered from many bugs and glitches that made the game unplayable, which furthermore damaged that Halo esports community. At the same time around the release of Halo: the Master Chief Collection, 343 Industries introduced the Halo Championship Series as another attempt to re-establish Halo as a competitive esports title. As Halo declined, it was dropped from Major League Gaming, to be replaced by Call of Duty as the new staple game for the league.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2013/01/24/halo-out-and-cod-in-at-major-league-gaming-but-why/|title=Halo Out and COD In at Major League Gaming, but Why?|publisher=Forbes|author=Paul Tassi|date=24 Jan 2013|accessdate=30 Oct 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently Halo 5 is the newest game in the series and has entirely built around being competitive and well suited for esports, featuring vanilla competitive settings, a wide array of competitive game modes, and an in-depth spectator mode. 343 Industries is hosting the Halo World Championships, which will be a 4v4 competition, held in part with competitive leagues MLG, ESL, and Gfinity. The prize pool is currently 2 million dollars, which is crowd funded through Halo 5's in-game "REQ Pack" purchases.

''[[Painkiller (video game)|Painkiller]]'' is a 2004 game developed by Polish game studio [[People Can Fly]] and published by [[DreamCatcher Interactive]]. At the end of 2004 ''Painkiller'' was chosen by the [[Cyberathlete Professional League]] to be their official [[2005 CPL World Tour]] game.&lt;ref name="Painkiller-cpl2005"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dreamcatchergames.com/dci/press/releases/pdf/Painkiller_cpl.pdf | title = Painkiller chosen as the unique official tournament game at 2005 CPL World Tour | work = DreamCatcher Games | accessdate = June 26, 2009 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090920014746/http://www.dreamcatchergames.com/dci/press/releases/pdf/painkiller_cpl.pdf | archivedate = September 20, 2009 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was slightly controversial with many [[e-sports]] followers and competitors due to the fact that other games had proven themselves at least as popular online multiplayer games. As the tour had already been announced as a one-on-one [[deathmatch (gaming)|deathmatch]] format competition, ''[[Unreal Tournament 2004]]'' and ''[[Doom 3]]'' were also fan favourites for this tour. However, since ''[[Unreal Tournament 2004]]'' developer [[Epic Games]] was in the process of changing publishers from [[Atari]] to [[Midway Games]] and could not guarantee their full support throughout the year-long tour, it was not chosen. An agreement between the CPL and DreamCatcher stipulated that no other organization was allowed to use ''Painkiller'' in a gaming competition with prizes above {{USD}}2,000. without obtaining a license from the CPL. For the 2006 CPL World Tour, ''[[Quake III Arena]]'' was selected as the one-versus-one deathmatch game, replacing ''Painkiller''.&lt;ref name="quake3-cpl2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neowin.net/news/gamers/06/07/21/quake-3-chosen-as-cpls-2006-world-season-1vs1-game |title=Quake 3 chosen as CPL's 2006 World Season 1vs1 game |work=neowin.net |accessdate=June 26, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090915193243/http://www.neowin.net/news/gamers/06/07/21/quake-3-chosen-as-cpls-2006-world-season-1vs1-game |archivedate=September 15, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Real-time strategy==
Competitions involving traditional [[real time strategy games]] generally feature individual competitors competing on [[personal computers]] over a local area network or the internet. While not nearly as popular as other RTS games during this period, the ''[[Age of Empires]]'' series was played competitively as well, and was part of the World Cyber Games from 2000-2003, and 2007-2008.&lt;ref name=WCG&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wcg.com/6th/history/wcgchallenge/wcgchallenge.asp|title=WCG History|publisher=World Cyber Games|accessdate=16 Sep 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65dJV3ZOX?url=http://www.wcg.com/6th/history/wcgchallenge/wcgchallenge.asp|archivedate=2012-02-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''StarCraft: Brood War''===
{{main|StarCraft: Brood War professional competition}}
''[[StarCraft]]'' was used at several tournaments including the [[Professional Gamers League]]. However, its expansion pack ''StarCraft: Brood War'' was far more popular than the original.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/starcraft-champs-prepare-for-world-crown-at-professional-gamers-league-tournament-77178127.html|title=StarCraft Champs Prepare for World Crown at Professional Gamers' League Tournament|website=[[PR Newswire]]|date=October 28, 1998|accessdate=May 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[StarCraft: Brood War]]'' was foundational in the establishment of e-sports, and along with ''StarCraft II'', remains among the most popular series in competitive gaming. ''StarCraft'' competitions did especially well in [[South Korea]], which remains central to the competitive scene as a whole. Professionals in Korea achieved a status similar to professional athletes.&lt;ref name=2012Forbes &gt;{{cite web |title=2012: The Year of eSports|publisher=Forbes|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2012/12/20/2012-the-year-of-esports/|date=20 Dec 2012|author=Paul Tassi|accessdate= 15 Aug 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the west, ''StarCraft'' enjoyed significantly less competitive popularity. ''StarCraft'' was the very first game to have been accepted into the [[World Cyber Games]] tournament, and had a tournament at their events every year until it was replaced by ''StarCraft II'' in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sk-gaming.com/content/32458-StarCraft_2_finds_its_way_to_WCG_2011|title=StarCraft 2 finds its way to WCG 2011|author=Radoslav 'Tyrael' Kolev|date=7 Mar 2011|publisher=SK-gaming|accessdate=10 Sep 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Korea, prominent ''StarCraft'' competitions included the [[Ongamenet Starleague]], the MBCGame StarCraft League, and Proleague.

{{Further|Warcraft III World Championships}}
''[[Warcraft III]]'' has been played professionally all around the world, especially in South Korea, China, France, and Germany. Although the game never achieved the same competitive popularity of the original ''StarCraft'', the game supported a few dozen professional teams. The game lacks a singular world championship, as there have been numerous large tournaments. Events have been organized by Blizzard Entertainment, have also been televised Korean leagues, and large tournaments have been held in China. Chinese players generally have used their own clients for online competition, due to a poor connection to the outside world. Notable ''Warcraft III'' players include: [[Xiaofeng "Sky" Li]], Dae Hui "FoV" Cho, [[Jang "Moon" Jae Ho]], [[Fredrik "MaDFroG" Johansson]] and [[Manuel "Grubby" Schenkhuizen]]. In more recent times, Warcraft III competition has declined in popularity. Many professional ''Warcraft III'' players have since moved to ''[[Starcraft II]]'', including Grubby and Moon. Despite this, ''Warcraft III'' continues to be played competitively, still appearing in events such as [[WCG 2013]].

===''StarCraft II''===
[[File:2011 blizzard cup grand final.JPG|thumb|The 2011 [[GOMTV Global Starcraft II League|GSL]] championship at [[Blizzcon]].]]
After its release in 2010, ''[[StarCraft II]]'' competitions gradually replaced the prior ''Brood War'' competitions. For example, ''StarCraft II'' has replaced the original game in the WCG, and the initially ''Brood War''-focused Proleague mixed ''StarCraft II'' into their competitions, before finally phasing out ''Brood War'' entirely. Initially, disagreements between Blizzard and Kespa prevented many players in Korea from moving to ''StarCraft II'', but conditions improved, and were ultimately resolved by 2012.

Many leagues and e-sports organizations in Korea and across the world host ''StarCraft II'' tournaments, including the [[Team Liquid#Team Liquid Starleague|Team Liquid StarLeague]], [[Major League Gaming]], [[North American Star League]], [[DreamHack]], the [[Intel Extreme Masters]] and the [[GOMTV Global Starcraft II League]].

In 2012, Blizzard Entertainment created the ''StarCraft II'' World Championship Series.  In the tournament's [[2012 StarCraft II World Championship Series|initial 2012 season]], Korean player PartinG beat Creator to win the $100,000 grand prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://us.battle.net/bwc/en/tournaments/sc2/brackets |title=2012 Shanghai China WCS bracket |website=StarCraft II World Championship Series |publisher=Blizzard |accessdate=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2013, the WCS system divides players into three leagues: WCS Korea, WCS Europe, and WCS North America. Players earn points based on their performance in many different tournaments, including the ones mentioned above, and the 16 players with the most points advance to world championship at [[BlizzCon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wcs.battle.net/sc2/en/about |title=About StarCraft II World Championship Series |website=StarCraft II World Championship Series |publisher=Blizzard |accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2013 grand finals, sOs beat the crowd favorite [[Jaedong]] 4-1, winning the $100,000 grand prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wcs.battle.net/sc2/en/articles/long-live-the-king-sos-is-your-wcs-champion |title=Long Live the King — sOs Is Your WCS Champion |website=StarCraft II World Championship Series |publisher=Blizzard |accessdate=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2nd-place finish for Jaedong awarded him $45,000, making his total prizepool earnings $489,384.83, the highest of any esports player at that time.

[[Multiplayer online battle arena]] (MOBA) games are historically a spin-off of real-time strategy games, but are different enough that they are now generally considered a separate genre. While traditional RTS games feature many units controlled by a single player, MOBAs are typically team focused, the model being five players on a team, each controlling a single "hero" unit. MOBAs are generally played on personal computers.

===''Dota 2''===

[[File:The International 2014.jpg|250px|thumb|left|A match during the main event of [[The International 2014]] at the [[KeyArena]] in Seattle]]
The ''Dota'' franchise began as a fan-made ''[[Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos]]'' [[mod (video gaming)|mod]] named ''[[Defense of the Ancients]]'' (''DotA''), released in 2003.  The popularity of the original mod, both in casual and competitive play, encouraged [[Valve Corporation]] to create a stand-alone sequel, ''[[Dota 2]]''. Together, the two games are amongst the most popular electronic sports games played professionally.

'''''Portrait of Abraham Casteleyn and his Wife, Margaretha van Bancken''''' (1663) is an [[oil painting|oil]] on canvas painting by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] painter [[Jan de Bray]]; it is an example of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and is now in the [[Rijksmuseum]].

This painting by De Bray was acquired in 1939 from the Frans Ernst Blaauw bequest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/collection/SK-A-3280 SK-A-3280] in the [[Rijksmuseum]]&lt;/ref&gt; It had been in the family since 1834 and because of the globe on the left it was assumed to be a double portrait of [[Joan Blaeu]] (1596-1673) and his wife Geertruid Vermeulen (died 1676).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/_boe022198401_01/_boe022198401_01_0055.php Het portret van Abraham Casteleyn en zijn vrouw] by Rudi Ekkart in the [[Digital Library for Dutch Literature|DBNL]]&lt;/ref&gt; The next year it was determined the couple was clearly too old at the time to be the youthful newlyweds portrayed in the painting, and it was speculated that they were therefore the son of Blaeu, Willem Blaeu II (1635-1685) and his wife Anna van Loon (1638-1680), though their ages didn't match either. Since the bust of [[Laurens Janszoon Coster]] features quite prominently above their portraits and De Bray himself was a Haarlem painter whose brother [[Dirck de Bray|Dirck]] made engravings for the Casteleyn printing firm until he left town in 1678, it was finally correctly catalogued upon the discovery of a drawn self-portrait by Casteleyn in the North Holland Archives. The couple Abraham Casteleyn and [[Margaretha van Bancken]] owned the house known as "In de Blije Druck" where they printed publications for the city hall and the first Haarlem newspaper on the [[Grote Markt, Haarlem]].

'''ReelAbilities''' is the United States' largest [[film festival]] dedicated to showcasing films by, or about, [[people with disabilities]]. It was founded by JCC Manhattan in [[New York City]] in 2007.

==Overview==
The Festival's Co-directors are Isaac Zablocki and Ravit Turjeman. ReelAbilities strives to make the festival as fully accessible as possible. In 2012, it screened films in 23 locations in all five of New York City's boroughs. All films screened by the Festival are captioned. It is also "the only festival in New York that prints film programs in Braille and features audio descriptions for the blind".&lt;ref name="Dale-2012"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dale|first=Austin|title=NYC Disability Film Festival, Reelabilities, Continues To Expand|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/nyc-disability-film-festival-reelabilities-continues-to-expand#.UAHqx47R3zI|publisher=Indiewire|accessdate=July 14, 2012|date=February 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, the NY edition of the festival opened on the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum and was featured for 7 days in 37 venues throughout the greater NY metropolitan area. 

ReelAbilities is now a touring film festival throughout the United States. Cities on its itinerary include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ReelAbilities|url=http://www.reelabilities.org/|publisher=ReelAbilities|accessdate=July 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Boston
* Columbus
* Cincinnati
* Chicago
* Greater D.C.
* Houston
* Minneapolis/St. Paul
* New Jersey
* New York City
* Philadelphia
* Pittsburgh
* Richmond, Virginia

==Programming==
Disabilities of any kind are explored in the films in the ReelAbilities Film Festival programming. In 2012, films featured included disabilities such as autism, Down syndrome, cerebral palsy, blindness and mental health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tepper|first=Rachel|title=Video: ReelAbilities Disabilities Film Festival Opens Feb. 1 With Iraq Vet Flick 'Warrior Champions'|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/01/video-reelabilities-disab_n_1247130.html|publisher=The Huffington Post|accessdate=July 14, 2012|date=February 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ReelAbilities screens films from the United States as well as international films, including from countries such as Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Canada, China, Germany, and the United Kingdom.

According to Festival Director Isaac Zablocki, most of the films originate outside the United States: {{blockquote|...specifically in Europe, where there's traditionally a lot of smaller films and access to government funds. Lots of these films are amazing, and, best of all, we get to show premieres. Many of the films are embraced outside of the U.S., but we're often the first or only American festival to show these movies.&lt;ref name="Dale-2012"/&gt; }}

Jeff Remz, a communications and marketing manager of the [[Boston Jewish Film Festival]], helped sponsor ReelAbilities in Boston in 2012. Remz says, "Disabilities don’t know boundaries by way of country, ethnicity, religion, or community."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=West|first=Nancy Shohet|title=REELAbilities Boston examines the lives of people with disabilities|url=http://articles.boston.com/2012-02-02/west/31011818_1_disabilities-cerebral-palsy-chinese-film|publisher=The Boston Globe|accessdate=July 14, 2012|date=February 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wiktionary pipe|轆轤首|rokurokubi}}
[[File:Hokusai rokurokubi.jpg|thumb|"Rokurokubi" from the [[Hokusai Manga]] by [[Katsushika Hokusai]]]]
The '''rokurokubi''' (ろくろ首, 轆轤首) is a type of Japanese ''[[yōkai]]'' (apparition). They look almost completely like humans, with one major difference. There are two types of Rokurokubi: one whose neck stretches, and one whose head comes off and flies around freely (''nukekubi''). The Rokurokubi appear in classical ''[[kaidan]]'' (spirit tales) and in [[yōkai]] works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=村上健司 編著|title=日本妖怪大事典|year=2005|publisher=角川書店|series=Kwai books|isbn=978-4-04-883926-6|pages=356頁}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested, however, that the idea of rokurokubi may have been created purely for entertainment purposes rather than originating from any folk beliefs or legends.&lt;ref name="今野1981"&gt;{{Harvnb|今野|1981|pp=86–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The word ''rokurokubi'' may have derived from the word ''rokuro'' which refers to a [[potter's wheel]]&lt;ref name="井之口他1988"&gt;{{Harvnb|井之口他|1988|p=520}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a [[water well]]'s [[pulley]] (since it elongates).&lt;ref name="yahoo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dic.yahoo.co.jp/dsearch?enc=UTF-8&amp;p=%E3%82%8D%E3%81%8F%E3%82%8D&amp;dtype=0&amp;dname=0na&amp;stye=0&amp;pagenum=1&amp;index=21930619691100 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070124182016/http://dic.yahoo.co.jp/dsearch?enc=UTF-8 |archivedate=2007-01-24 |df= }} Yahoo Japan, ヤフー株式会社 Accessed 22 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="多田2000"&gt;{{Harvnb|多田|2000|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; or an [[umbrella]] handle (which also elongates).&lt;ref name="井之口他1988" /&gt;&lt;ref name="yahoo" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=阿部主計|title=妖怪学入門|year=2004|publisher=雄山閣|isbn=978-4-639-01866-7|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ShokokuHyaku Rokurokubi.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Wechizen no Kofuchuu Rokurokubi no Koto'' (ゑちぜんの国府中ろくろ首の事) from the ''[[Shokoku Hyaku Monogatari]]'' (諸国百物語)&lt;ref name="篠塚訳著2006" /&gt;]]
The nukekubi are rokurokubi whose heads come off and float about. These were the first rokurokubi, whereas the other kind came afterwards.&lt;ref name="篠塚訳著2006"&gt;{{Harvnb|篠塚訳著|2006|pp=76–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nukekubi sometimes perform bad deeds such as attacking at night and drinking their victims' blood. It's theorized that the nukekubi has a weakness when it is sleeping and the head is floating around: if the body moves, then the head cannot be re-united to the body.&lt;ref name="柴田2005"&gt;{{Harvnb|柴田|2005|pp=30–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Classical literature about rokurokubi describe tales of people witnessing and encountering floating heads at night time.&lt;ref name="柴田2005" /&gt;

Sometimes, the action of the head separating from the body is seen as the soul wandering away from the body i. e. somnambulism. For example, in the ''Sorori Monogatari'' (曾呂利物語, 1663 CE), in the chapter, ''A Woman's Wild Thoughts Wandering Around'' (女の妄念迷ひ歩く事, ''Onna no Mōnen Mayoiaruku Koto'') the head separating from the body interpreted to be the woman's soul wandering while asleep. In the same book, a man saw a nukekubi that changed into a chick and a woman's head, so he took his sword and chased the head. The head fled into a home, and people said that they heard a voice from inside say, "I had a scary dream. I was chased by a man with a sword. I ran away all the way back home, and then I woke up."&lt;ref name="高田編1989" /&gt; (refer to picture).

A similar story appears in Shokoku Hyaku Monogatari (諸国百物語, 1677 CE), which drew a lot of inspiration from the Sorori Monogatari. In ''About Rokurokubi in the Province of Echizen'' (ゑちぜんの国府中ろくろ首の事, ''Echizen no Kuni Fuchū Rokurokubi no Koto''), there's the story of a man who chases a nukekubi (who was a woman's soul detached from her body) all the way home. It's said that the woman had been shamed by a crime she has committed, so as a result, she left her husband, shaved her hair, and committed suicide.&lt;ref name="篠塚訳著2006" /&gt;

''Hokusō Sadan'' (北窻瑣談, 1910 CE) is an [[Edo period]] essay by Tachibana Nankei (橘春暉). Here too, it was interpreted to be an illness resulting in a detaching soul. The story goes: in the first year of [[Kansei]], in [[Echigo Province]] (now [[Fukui Prefecture]]), there was a house maidservant whose head rolled off the pillow while she was asleep, detached from the body. Later in the story, it was explained that it was not really the head, but rather the soul making the appearance of a head.{{Sfn|柴田|2008|pp=704-705}}

In ''Kokon Hyaku Monogatari Hyōban'' (古今百物語評判, 1686 CE), a book of ghost stories that explains yōkai tales by [[Yamaoka Genrin]], there is a chapter called ''How Priest Zetsugan saw Rokurokubi in Higo'' (絶岸和尚肥後にて轆轤首を見給ふ事, ''Zetsugan Oshō Higo nite Rokurokubi wo Mitamou Koto''). In [[Higo Province]] (now [[Kumamoto Prefecture]]), the head of an innkeeper's wife leaves her body and floats in the air. It returned to normal the next day, but there was a line around her neck. The author made references to examples from Chinese books, and then commented, "as these kinds of things were often seen in South-East Asia, not just limited to the creation of the heaven and earth, it is difficult to fathom them with ordinary common sense such as the idea that octopi do not have eyes, and as these things are unheard of in the capital, everything strange is in faraway lands."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=山岡元隣|editor=山岡元恕編 太刀川清校訂|title=続百物語怪談集成|year=1993|publisher=国書刊行会|series=叢書江戸文庫|isbn=978-4-336-03527-1|pages=12–13|chapter=古今百物語評判}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same book, there is a story which tells of a woman in the village of Tawa, [[Nagao, Kagawa|Nagao]], [[Ōkawa District, Kagawa|Ōkawa District]], [[Kagawa Prefecture]] (now [[Sanuki, Kagawa|Sanuki]]) who is a rokurokubi and has a ring-like bruise around her neck.&lt;ref name="多田2000" /&gt;

In the ''Churyō Manroku'' (中陵漫録) is a tale which describes a "Rokurokubi Village" in the recesses of [[Mount Yoshino]] where all the residents, even children, wore scarves to cover a line around their necks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=佐藤成裕|editor=早川純三郎編輯代表|title=日本随筆大成|year=1976|publisher=吉川弘文館|volume=第3期 3|isbn=978-4-642-08580-9|page=354|chapter=中陵漫録}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Kasshi Yawa'' (甲子夜話, ca. 1821 CE) by [[Matsura Seizan]] is a story which tells of a woman in [[Hitachi Province]] who has a terminal illness. A peddler has told her husband that the liver of a white dog will cure her. The husband kills the pet dog and gives his wife the dog's liver as a medicant. The woman is cured but her next born daughter is a rokurokobi. When the  roukorkobi's head detached and flew in the air, the white dog appeared, bit the head and killed the rokurokobi.&lt;ref name="笹間1994"&gt;{{Harvnb|笹間|1994|pp=27–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although rokurokubi and nukekubi are usually female, in ''Shousai Hikki'' (蕉斎筆記), an [[Edo period]] tale, there is a nukekubi that is male. A priest is sleeping in his temple when a head appeared and approached his chest. He grabs it and throws it away and it left. In the morning, the manservant asks to take leave, and when asked why, the manservant asks, "did a head come visit last night?" The priest answered yes, the manservant then explained that "I have the nukekubi illness, and I fear it will interfere with my work too much from now on." The manservant went away to his home in [[Shimōsa Province]] where this "illness" was thought to be common.{{Sfn|柴田|2008|p=702}}

In the essay ''Mimibukuro'' by [[Negishi Shizumori]], a woman who was rumored to be a rokurokubi is married but manages to lives well since the rumor was nothing more than a rumor. She was not actually a rokurokubi so she achieved a happy ending, which is unusual for tales about rokurokubi because bad fortune almost always results when the true identity of a rokurokubi is discovered.&lt;ref name="柴田2005" /&gt;

In the [[Edo period]] encyclopedia, ''[[Wakan Sansai Zue]]'' Rokuokubi like creatures from Chinese lore are described. They are written as 飛頭蛮 meaning ''flying head barbarians''. They use their ears like wings and they eat insects. The ones from China and Japan were believed to be foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=稲田篤信・田中直日編|editor=高田衛監修|title=鳥山石燕 画図百鬼夜行|year=1992|publisher=国書刊行会|isbn=978-4-336-03386-4|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foreigner nukekubi also appears in ''[[Rokurokubi (folktale)|Rokurokubi]]'' by [[Lafcadio Hearn]]. In his story, the spirits masquerade as a family of woodcutters from the city who kill and eat travellers.

== Rokurokubi whose necks extend ==
[[File:SekienRokurokubi.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Rokurokubi (飛頭蛮) from the ''[[Gazu Hyakki Yagyō]]'' by [[Sekiyama Torien]]. What is depicted here is not a neck, but actually a string that connects the head to the body.&lt;ref name=kotowari386/&gt;]]
[[File:Ikku Rokurokubi.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Rokuroubi from ''Rekkoku Kaidan Kikigaki Zōshi'' (列国怪談聞書帖) by [[Jippensha Ikku]]&lt;ref name="ikku"&gt;{{Cite book|author=十返舎一九|editor=棚橋正博校訂|title=十返舎一九集|year=1997|publisher=国書刊行会|series=叢書江戸文庫|isbn=978-4-336-03543-1|pages=246–248|chapter=列国怪談聞書帖}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Starting in the [[Edo period]], tales were written about people's necks stretching when they were asleep. Examples of these tales are ''Buya Zokuda'' (武野俗談), ''Kanden Kōhitsu'' (閑田耕筆) and ''Yasō Kidan'' (夜窓鬼談).

It's thought that the idea of an extending neck originated from people misinterpreting visual depictions of nukekubi, the earlier kind of rokurokubi. There was the idea that nukekubi had a string attaching the head to the body, and when this string was depicted in visual depictions, people misinterpted this string as an elongated neck.&lt;ref name=kotowari386&gt;{{cite book &lt;!--| 和書--&gt; | author=京極夏彦 | title=妖怪の理 妖怪の檻 | publisher=角川書店 | series=怪 BOOKS | year=2007 | chapter=妖怪の形について | pages=386 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Kasshi Yawa'' (甲子夜話), there is a tale which tells of a female servant with a pale face who is suspected to be a rokurokubi. One night, her master checks on her while she is sleeping and sees something like steam gradually rise from her chest. The steam becomes thick and obscures her head and then suddenly it appears as though her neck has risen up and stretched. Perhaps due to being surprised from seeing her master, the girl stirs, turns over and her neck returned to normal. This servant had a pale face, but otherwise looked completely normal, but despite this, she was fired and in fact has had trouble staying in any job, always being fired shortly after being employed.{{Sfn|柴田|2008|pp=700-701}} For the soul to leave the body and create the shape of a neck, as seen in this story and the before mentioned Hokusō Sadan, is sometimes interpreted to be "[[Ectoplasm (paranormal)|ectoplasm]]" in [[parapsychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=多田克己|title=幻想世界の住人たち|year=1990|publisher=新紀元社|series=[[Truth In Fantasy]]|volume=IV|isbn=978-4-915146-44-2|page=264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late [[Edo period]] ''[[yomihon]]'' (illustrated novel), ''Rekkoku Kaidan Kikigaki Zōshi'' (列国怪談聞書帖) by [[Jippensha Ikku]] the author suggests the elongated necks of rokurokubi originate in the spiritual principle, ''[[karma]]''. In Ikku's work, ''Kaishin'', a monk from [[Enshū]] and a woman called Oyotsu elope together. However, when Oyatsu collapsed from an illness, they ran out of money, so he killed her. When Kaishin eventually returned to secular life, he slept with a girl he met at an inn. When they sleep together, the girl's neck stretched and her face becomes that of Oyotsu, who then told him about her resentment. Kaishin felt regretful his actions and proceeded to tell Oyatsu's father everything. The girl's father then told Kaishin that he has also killed a woman before. He stole her money and with it, he opened his inn. He had a daughter was born soon after who, due to karma, became a rokurokubi. Kaishin then reentered the priesthood. He built a grave for Oyotsu, said to be the Rokurokubi no Tsuka (Rokurokubi Mound), which told the story to future generations.&lt;ref name="ikku" /&gt;

In some stories, rokurokubi are not a yōkai, but rather people who have an affliction that affects the body. For example, the [[Edo period]] author [[Ban Kōkei]] in his work "Kanden Kōhitsu" told a tale of a [[geisha]] at the [[Yoshiwara]] brothel whose neck would elongate in her sleep. It stated that her neck stretched to due her "heart becoming loose"{{Sfn|柴田|2008|pp=701-702}}

== Oral tradition ==
Rokurokobi are also appear in the [[oral tradition]] of Japanese myths. For example, there is a myth about an old highway between the villages of Iwa and [[Akechi, Gifu|Akechi]] in [[Gifu Prefecture]] where it is said that a snake shapeshifted into a rokurokubi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=鈴木孝司他編|title=旧静波村の民俗 岐阜県恵那郡明智町旧静波村|year=1971|publisher=東洋大学 民俗研究会|id=ncid: BA5494848X|page=191|chapter=口承文芸}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is a myth from the oral tradition of Koikubo area of [[Iida, Nagano|Iida]], [[Nagano Prefecture]] where it is said a rokurokubi appeared in someone's home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=巻山圭一|editor=所三男他編纂|title=長野県史|year=1989|publisher=長野県|volume=民俗編 2巻3号|id=ncid: BN00168252|page=100|chapter=家・屋敷に出る妖怪}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Bunka]] period, a [[kaidan]] story became popular, where there was a prostitute whose neck would smoothly stretch and would lick the oil of paper lanterns when she slept with guests, showing how rokurokubi were spoken of as things that women would transform into or an illness that they would be afflicted with. In this period, rokurokubi were also popular in [[freak show]]s.&lt;ref name="多田2000" /&gt; The ''Shohō Kenbunroku'' (諸方見聞録) records a freak show in 1810 (Bunka 7) in Edo, now [[Tokyo]] where a male rokurokubi with an elongated neck appeared.&lt;ref name="笹間1994" /&gt;

Tales of rokurokubi appeared even in the early [[Meiji period|Meiji]] period. There was a tale of how a merchant and his wife from Shibaya town, [[Ibaraki, Osaka|Ibaraki]], [[Osaka Prefecture]] who witnessed their daughter's neck stretch every night. Despite their supplications in [[Shinto]] and [[Buddhism]], their daughter did not get better, and eventually the whole town came to know about it. The couple couldn't bear it anymore, so they left, leaving no clues as to where they went.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=岡市二洲|date=September 1933|title=怪談茨木附近|journal=郷土研究上方|volume=3巻|issue=33号|page=34|id=NCID: AN00045163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Magic shows ==
The rokurokubi is also a kind of Japanese [[magic (illusion)|magic show tricks]] using curtains and life sized dolls without heads. It's reported that a doll without a head wearing a [[kimono]] in [[seiza]] is put in front of the curtain. There's a rope behind the curtain and a female performer connected to it who shows only her face. As she stands and squats, the fake neck would stretches and contracts, as if it were a rokurokubi.

Explanations and pictures about what's behind this trick were written in magazines of the [[Meiji period]] (1800s), giving a date for how early these shows first appeared.&lt;ref&gt;富田昭次 『絵はがきで見る日本近代』 青弓社 2005年 {{ISBN|4-7872-2016-0}} p.131 滑稽新聞 社発行の雑誌「絵葉書世界」（雑誌とは言っているが、絵葉書 の画集）の中に「見せ物の内幕」と題し、ろくろ首の仕掛けを暴く絵がある。絵師は、なべぞとあり、切手 を貼る所には、驚いている少年が描かれている&lt;/ref&gt; This was a time period when mystery phenomena were vigorously exposed by the scientifically minded, so for magic tricks to be revealed is fitting with the zeitgeist.

In the [[Taishō period|Taishō]] period, there were businesses arranging rokurokubi to appear in show tents in festivals and fairs at temples and shrines, and they were quite popular.&lt;ref name="笹間1994" /&gt;

== Similar tales from other nations ==
The type of rokurokubi whose necks separate from the rest of the body is said to have derived from stories of the Chinese yōkai, the ''[[hitōban]]'' (飛頭蛮) a yōkai whose head separates from the body and floats about.&lt;ref name="多田2000" /&gt; Like the rokurokobi, the hitoban has a line around its neck.&lt;ref name="多田2000" /&gt; Chinese stories also tell of a yōkai called a ''rakutō'' (落頭) whose head comes off and floats about while the torso remains at rest on the futon. There is a tale that in the [[Three Kingdoms]] period, an [[Eastern Wu]] general, [[Zhu Huan]] employed a female servant who was a rakutō. It's said that she used its ears like wings. Another tale relates that in the [[Qin (state)|Qin]] era, there was a clan from the south called ''rakutōmin'' (落頭民) who could fly around in only their heads.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=水木しげる|title=カラー版 続妖怪画談|year=1993|publisher=岩波書店|series=岩波新書|isbn=978-4-004-30288-9|pages=152–153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are legends of creatures including [[Palasik]], [[Kuyang]], and [[Leyak|Leak]] from Indonesia,  [[Penanggalan]] in Malaysia, and [[Krasue]] in Thailand. The heads of these creatures would separate from the body and float about with the [[entrails]] attached.&lt;ref name="多田2000" /&gt;

The [[Chonchon]] is a mythical creature of South America which takes the form of a human head flying around in the air, sucking the life out of people.

The [[Manananggal]] is a creature of Philippines mythology. This female monster is slightly different since its whole body from the waist up detaches and grows giant bat-like wings.

The yōkai researcher, Tada Katsumi states that these stories arrived in Japan in the [[Muromachi period|Muromachi]] to [[Azuchi–Momoyama period|Azuchi-Momoyama]] periods, when there was still trade with southern China and Southeast Asia. In the [[Edo period]], when Japan adopted an [[Sakoku|isolationist policy]] an original Japanese yōkai, the ''rokurokubi'' evolved.&lt;ref name="多田2000" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7891">The '''School of Posillipo''' refers to a loose group of landscape painters, based in the waterfront [[Posillipo]] neighborhood of [[Naples]], Italy. While some among them became academicians, it was not a formal school or association.

In the 18th century, landscape painting or vedute had emerged as a profitable, and respectable, style of painting. Landscapes were, in part, higher in demand than depictions of Catholic religious imagery to buyers from Protestant Europe during the [[Age of the Enlightenment]]. This included the mainly aristocratic travellers on a grand tour of Southern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://issuu.com/bnb_art_consulting/docs/important_works_on_paper_catalogue_2011/1| Important Works on Paper: Vedute from the Kingdom of Naples from the 18th and 19th Centuries], Catalogue edited by Ermanno Bellucci, with editorial assistance by Milena Naldi, BNB Art Consulting]&lt;/ref&gt; Items in demand by travellers were paintings evoking memories of the place, playing the role that photographic postcards now fill. [[Pietro Fabris]], for example, had created views of [[Pompeii]] and the Volcanic fields surrounding Vesuvius and Etna. In Venice, [[Canaletto]] and the [[Francesco Guardi|Guardi]] for example, had depicted mainly urban vistas of the waterlogged city. [[Caspar van Wittel|Vanvitelli]], [[Giovanni Paolo Panini|Panini]], and [[Bernardo Belloto|Belloto]] adapted these styles to different urbanscapes in Italy and abroad. Their styles were realistic, and Canaletto was said to use a camara obscura.

Such detailed realism, however, was rarely applied to natural scenery. There was a tradition in Italy of landscape painting dating to the Baroque 17th century with [[Claude Lorrain]] in Rome and [[Salvatore Rosa]] in Rome and Naples as two distinct trends. Lorrain's landscapes were lush and imagined, and still often anchored in classical stories using subsidiary figures. Rosa painted tempestuous short range arrangements of natural elements, a craggy hillock with perilously perched trees.

At the start of the 19th century in Naples, the premier representative of landscape painters was the Dutch emigree [[Jacob Philipp Hackert]] (1737–1807), the court painter of Ferdinand IV, who seem to be following the tradition of Lorrain. His paintings had a stock arrangement of a nearby tree in a pastoral hill or mountainside, and with distant ruins or a recognizable mountain in the background. Volcano-ridden southern Campania and Sicily had such distinctive peaks. The fortunes of Hackert suffered with the rise of the Napoleonic Neoclassicism and the deposition of the Bourbon kingdom of two Sicilies by the French.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Napier|first=Lord Francis|title= ''Notes on Modern Painting at Naples.''|publisher=John W.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In 1815, the painter [[Anton Sminck Pitloo]], (1790–1837) was coaxed to move to Naples. He opened a studio in the Chiaia neighborhood. he preferred to paint outdoors with natural lighting. Posillipo at one end of the crescent shape bay of Naples, was a natural spot that allowed the painters to paint both buildings and water. Some say he was influenced by the visits of [[Joseph Mallord William Turner|Turner]] (1819–1820) and [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot|Corot]] to Naples, but in general, Pitloo's paintings are devoid of passionate political or social imagery&lt;ref&gt;Nineteenth-Century Painters and Painting: A Dictionary By Geraldine Norman Page 169.&lt;/ref&gt; Pitloo's favorite vedute was painted out of doors, not in the studio; and was a view of the crescentic Neapolitan shore from his vantage point from the peninsula of [[Posillipo]]. In this way his canvas scene included water, the bustling shoreline and docks, and the land across the bay. The vista while somewhat idyllic romanticism; there was also the encroachment of the daily activities of sailors, fisherman, and their families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ac-support.europe.umuc.edu/~jmatthew/naples/Gigante.htm Review of School of Posillipo],&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Hackert before him, Pitloo became a professor at the Accademia di Belli Arti in Naples, and was able to influence fellow painters and pupils such as [[Carl Götzloff]], [[Giacinto Gigante]], [[Teodoro Duclere]], [[Gabriele Smargiassi]], [[Vincenzo Franceschini (painter)|Vincenzo Franceschini]], [[Achille Vianelli]], and [[Consalvo Carelli]]. Many of the works of these painter from circa 1820 to circa 1850 are known as products of the ''School of Posillipo''. Other painters influence by this school are [[Salvatore Fergola]], a pupil of Hackert. In time, the lessening of the demands for accuracy and a greater attention to the mood of the painting during the age of Romanticism, led to more impressionist styles found in post-1850s Tuscan school of [[Macchiaioli]] (who also painted out of doors), or in the [[School of Resina]] represented by painters such as [[Guglielmo Ciardi]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The most prominent of Pitloo's students was [[Giacinto Gigante]] (1806–1876), who started his career working for the Neapolitan Royal Topographic Office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sorrentoinfo.com/en/27/3/277/category/articles/the-works-of-giaginto-gigante-at-the-correale-museum-of-sorrento.html Correale Museum entry on Giacinto Gigante]&lt;/ref&gt; Gigante had observed the use of a camara lucida in the studio of Swiss-German artist, [[Jakob Wilhelm Hüber]] (1787–1871), who used camara lucida. He also worked with watercolors. He collaborated with Cuciniello and Bianchi in landscapes collected in a book titled ''Viaggio pittorico nel Regno delle Due Sicilie'' (Pictorial journey through the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies). Gigante befriended [[Sylvester Shchedrin]], and through him also obtained commissions from the Russian aristocracy. Like Pitloo before him, Gigante he was appointed chief of design at the Neapolitan Academy. Giuseppe and  [[Filippo Palizzi]] (1818–1899) were briefly pupils of Gigante, but soon fell under the influence of the [[Barbizon School]],  who in turn were to influence [[Domenico Morelli]]&lt;ref&gt;Laura Casone, [http://www.artgate-cariplo.it/collezione-online/page45d.do?link=oln82d.redirect&amp;kcond31d.att3=369 Filippo Palizzi], online catalogue [http://www.artgate-cariplo.it/Portal-museo/page38.do?sp=page38&amp;link=ln502&amp;stu24.LanguageISOCtxParam=en Artgate] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402223047/http://www.artgate-cariplo.it/Portal-museo/page38.do?sp=page38&amp;link=ln502&amp;stu24.LanguageISOCtxParam=en |date=2012-04-02 }} by [[Fondazione Cariplo]], 2010, CC BY-SA.

'''Signe Baumane''' (born August 7, 1964) is a [[Latvia]]n [[Animation|animator]], fine artist, illustrator and writer, currently living and working in [[New York City]]. She is a member of the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]], she was a 2005 Fellow in Film of the [[New York Foundation for the Arts]]. She is also a teacher, having taught animation at the [[Pratt Institute]] from 2000 to 2002.

==Early life and education==
Signe Baumane was born in [[Auce]], [[Latvia]], and grew up in [[Tukums]], Latvia and [[Sakhalin Island]].  She was married to Yuriy Gavrilenko, an artist and impresario, and [[Lasse Persson]], a Swedish animator.  She began writing for publication at the age of 14. She attended [[Moscow University]] and graduated in 1989 with a BA in Philosophy.

==Career==
She began working as an animator in 1989, taking a position as animator at Dauka Animation Studio. Over the next several years, local television aired several animated commercials that Baumane had designed and directed. In 1991 she produced her first animated film, ''The Witch and the Cow'', of which she was the scriptwriter, director, designer, and animator.

Following a two-year stint as a children's book illustrator in [[Moscow]], she returned to animation, illustration and stage design in 1993 in [[Riga]]. She relocated to [[New York City]] in September 1995, finding work with [[Bill Plympton]] as production manager, color stylist, and cel painter the following January.

In 1998 she resumed work as an independent animator, making several films.  Two of these, ''Woman'' and ''Veterinarian'' were made during visits to Latvia.  The remainder were made in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.signebaumane.com/sbbiog2.html Signe Baumane web site, biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109020008/http://signebaumane.com/sbbiog2.html |date=2010-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chris Robinson: ''Unsung Heroes of Animation'', pp. 200-206&lt;/ref&gt;

Signe has initiated and curated a number of independent animation programs and along with [[Patrick Smith (artist)|Patrick Smith]] and Bill Plympton is the organizing core of ''Square Footage Films'', a group of New York independent animators that self-publishes and distributes DVDs of their own work.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.squarefootagefilms.com/ Square Footage Films web site accessed on February 5, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides doing animation, Baumane is a fine artist, and has produced numerous paintings and sculptures,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etaoin.com/sig0.htm Signe Baumane], section of online art gallery accessed February 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and has also worked as an illustrator for children's books.

Her films have been screened at important film festivals such as [[Annecy International Animated Film Festival|Annecy]], [[Tribeca Film Festival|Tribeca]], [[Sundance Film Festival|Sundance]], [[Berlin International Film Festival|Berlin]], [[Ottawa International Animation Festival|Ottawa]], [[Venice Film Festival|Venice]] and they have received numerous awards.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} In 2017, Baumane was awarded a prestigious [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] for her exceptional creative ability in the arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gf.org/fellows/all-fellows/signe-baumane/|title=John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rocks in My Pockets ===
Baumane's animation ''Rocks in My Pockets'' is a feature-length autobiographical animation that explores the depression that has haunted three generations of women in her family. ''Rocks in My Pockets'' was selected as the Latvian entry for Best Foreign Language Film at the 87th Academy Awards but was not nominated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Holdsworth|first1=Nick|title=Oscars: Latvia Nominates 'Rocks in My Pockets' in Foreign-Language Category|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oscars-latvia-nominates-rocks-my-733119|website=The Holywood Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project received early funding from [[NYSCA]], [[The Jerome Foundation]], and [[Women Make Movies]], the project's fiscal sponsor. In 2013 after two years of working on the project Baumane and team raised another $50,000 on [[Kickstarter]].

=== My Love Affair With Marriage ===
Signe is currently directing and animating her second animated feature film, ''[[imdbtitle:6435164|My Love Affair with Marriage]]'', which will infuse music and science into a personal love story. The film will examine the biological chemistry of love and gender, as well as societal pressures on an individual to conform to the social mores of the times.

After receiving a development grant from [[NYSCA]], through [[Women Make Movies]], the project then raised over $132,000 through [[Kickstarter]] to fund production. As of summer 2017, all of the voice actors have been recorded and the film's soundtrack has been completed, and animation has begun, in a partnership with Locomotive Productions, based in Latvia.

The voice cast is scheduled to include [[Dagmara Domińczyk|Dagmara Dominczyk]], [[Matthew Modine]], [[Cameron Monaghan]], [[Stephen Lang]], [[Erica Schroeder]], [[Emma Kenney]], and [[Michele Pawk]] in key roles.

== Style and Themes ==
Baumane mainly utilizes a personal narration over a flat 2D hand-drawn cel-shaded style of animation. In her feature film, [[Rocks in My Pockets]], she combined papier-mâché and stop-motion with traditional animations.

Her work tackles difficult subjects such as sex, pregnancy and depression and makes it palatable through irony and humor. Her narrative style uses visual metaphors to communicate how living people feel inside; one example is in her animated short Birth her use of the body as a vessel in her film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://filmschoolrejects.com/features/birth-short-film.php|title=Birth - Short Film|website=Film School Rejects|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baumane's ''Teat Beat of Sex'', a series of semi fictionalized personal recollections that stem from the artist's firsthand experience and an array of viewpoints on the subject, are uncompromisingly yet refreshingly candid, oftentimes dealing with somewhat taboo areas that can serve as discussion points.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Independent Animation: Developing, Producing and Distributing Your Animated Films|last=Mitchell|first=Ben|publisher=CRC Press|year=2017|isbn=978-1-138-85572-4|location=|pages=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2834">The {{nihongo|'''Tampei Photography Club'''|丹平写真倶楽部}} was a group based in [[Osaka]] from 1930 until 1941 that promoted [[avant-garde]] and, toward the end, socially concerned photography.

The group was founded around the photographer [[Bizan Ueda]], among photographers who bought their supplies from the Tampei Pharmacy ({{nihongo2|丹平薬局}}, ''Tanpei yakkyoku'') in [[Shinsaibashi]], Osaka. The founding members included [[Terushichi Hirai]], [[Kōrō Honjō]] and [[Tōru Kōno]]; these were soon augmented by [[Kaneyoshi Tabuchi]], [[Nakaji Yasui]], and others.

The group's first exhibition was held in 1931 but it was the second exhibition, in 1932, that caused a stir, with avant-garde works. The club exhibited frequently; its first exhibition in [[Tokyo]] held in 1935.

The club's 23rd exhibition, in March 1941, featured a series titled ''Refugee Jews'' ({{nihongo2|流氓ユダヤ}}, ''Ryūbō Yudaya'')&lt;ref&gt;Also translatable as ''Displaced Jews,'' etc., often referred to as ''Wandering Jew.''&lt;/ref&gt; of 22 photographs depicted exiles from eastern Europe who were living in [[Kobe]]. Six of these were by Yasui, who had instigated two photography sessions for it earlier that month.&lt;ref&gt;''Tanjō hyakunen: Yasui Nakaji: Shashin no subete'' / ''Nakaji Yasui 1903&amp;ndash;1942: The Photography,'' p. 136; the same book shows a larger number of Yasui's own photographs in the series are shown on pp.&amp;nbsp;136&amp;ndash;42.&lt;/ref&gt; The club was forced to close later that year.

The club reemerged after the war, but did not regain its prominence.

'''''The Legend of Neil''''' is a [[comedy]] [[web series]] distributed by [[Comedy Central]]'s partner [[Atom.com]]&lt;ref name=fb&gt;{{cite web |author= |title=Atom.com Launches Second Season of Hit Web Series 'Legend Of Neil' |publisher=[[Fox Business]] |date=27 July 2009 |url=http://www.foxbusiness.com/story/markets/industries/media/atomcom-launches-second-season-hit-web-series-legend-neil/ |accessdate=27 September 2009 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a [[parody]] of the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Nintendo game]] ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]''. [[Sandeep Parikh]] of ''[[The Guild (web series)|The Guild]]'' fame directs the series. Tony Janning writes for the series, and acts as the title character Neil. [[Felicia Day]] and Mike Rose, who have worked with Parikh on the set of ''The Guild'', appear as recurring characters.

The series follows Neil, who is sucked into the world of ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' while playing the game. As he travels [[Hyrule]] he is mistaken for the hero of the game, [[Link (Legend of Zelda)|Link]]. The series is "full of self degrading, foul humor",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Woerner, Meredith |title=Flashing Fairies And Moblins: The Legend Of Neil Is Back |publisher=[[io9]] |date=16 July 2009 |url=http://io9.com/5316373/flashing-fairies-and-moblins-the-legend-of-neil-is-back |accessdate=27 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as when Neil is being sucked into the game he is [[Masturbation|masturbating]] and [[autoerotic asphyxiation|strangled]] himself with his [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] controller.

The series began as a four-minute YouTube video posted in 2007. The video went viral, receiving several million views. Its popularity led to Atom.com financing a web series based around the video.

The first season was released in 2008. According to Fox Business before the premiere of the second season, "With nearly one million plays, the hit Web series by creator Sandeep Parikh built one of the Web's most enthusiastic fan bases in 2008."&lt;ref name=fb /&gt; In the run-up to the August 2009 premiere of the second season, [[MTV2]] planned to air the complete first season.&lt;ref name=fb /&gt; The series was also nominated for multiple [[Streamys]] at the [[1st Streamy Awards]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://streamys.org/nominees.shtml 2009 Nominees – The Streamy Awards] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805055033/http://streamys.org/nominees.shtml |date=2009-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Season 3 began on July 25, 2010. Each episode of season 3 features a remix of the original theme song performed by a different musical guest.

A DVD was released on December 4, 2012.

==Characters and cast==
*'''Neil ([[Link (Legend of Zelda)|Link]])''' – after getting fired from a gas station by his brother, a drunken Neil was transported into the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Nintendo]] game ''The Legend of Zelda''. He then unwillingly plays the role of the game's main character, a forest elf named '''Link'''. Neil as Link contrasts with many of the characters' views of Link, while Link is honest and brave, Neil is lazy and will use any tricks he can find to get out of the game. He is so much the opposite of Link that he tends to befriend the monsters whose sole purpose is to kill him. Neil is portrayed by co-writer of the series, Tony Janning.
*'''[[Recurring characters in The Legend of Zelda series#Old Man|Old Man]]''' – Link's in-game mentor, loosely based on the old man in the first Zelda video game who gives the player a wooden sword before the first level. Old Man is portrayed by Mike Rose. Old Man has a twin brother O-old Man (pronounced with a change in emphasis) who is left-handed, a better potion maker, and has [[Tourette syndrome]]. Usually only one of the twins speaks to Link, but on occasion—such as in Season 2, Episode 3—they appear simultaneously. Both of the Old Men are generally helpful to Neil, often in a sarcastic or condescending manner.
*'''[[Universe of The Legend of Zelda#Fairy|Fairy]]''' – a fairy who replenishes Link's health. In the series she does so by having sex with Link, and she becomes emotionally and sexually obsessed with him. Fairy also seems to be emotionally unstable, often taking Neil's compliments as insults and vice versa. In the series, the fairies are hunted for their dust, which is used as a [[Insufflation (medicine)|drug]], a fate which befalls Fairy in Season 2, Episode 1. In the first episode of the third season it is revealed that the fairy is pregnant. Fairy is portrayed by [[Felicia Day]] of ''[[Dr. Horrible's Sing Along Blog|Dr. Horrible]]'' and ''[[The Guild (web series)|The Guild]]'' fame.
*'''[[Princess Zelda]]''' – the title character from the video game. Zelda's parents were killed by Ganon and she herself was captured and imprisoned. She appears to Neil in visions, alternately pleading and enticing him to continue to rescue her. Neil was initially surprised by her ethnic appearance, expecting a lighter-skinned princess from the video game graphics (In "The Legend of Neil" she's black). Zelda is portrayed by [[Angie Hill]]. ''Dr. Horrible'' co-creator [[Maurissa Tancharoen|Maurissa Tancharoen Whedon]] provides Zelda's singing voice in the musical episode.&lt;ref name=musical1&gt;{{cite web |author=Hustvedt, Marc |title='Legend of Neil' Season 2 Boasts Musical Romp |publisher=[[Tubefilter News]] |date=22 July 2009 |url=http://news.tubefilter.tv/2009/07/22/legend-of-neil-season-2-boasts-musical-romp/ |accessdate=27 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=musical2&gt;{{cite web |author=Hustvedt, Marc |title='Legend of Neil' Raunchy Musical Episode Debuts |publisher=[[Tubefilter News]] |date=24 August 2009 |url=http://news.tubefilter.tv/2009/08/24/legend-of-neil-raunchy-musical-episode-debuts/ |accessdate=27 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Ganon]]''' – the leading antagonist of the game and series. Ganon is played as an incompetent authority figure, impervious to the suggestions of his advisor Wizzrobe. Ganon never seems to leave his shadowed throne until the end of season two. He seems to enjoy singing and is a patron of stand-up comedy. Ganon's ineptitude extends to his attempts to woo Princess Zelda at a "romantic" dinner. In the Season 2 finale he reveals to Zelda that his parents are trapped in some "vortex". It is implied that Ganon is a Moblin. When his face is finally shown, there are similarities, and he comments that he possesses three penises, a trait previously attributed to the Moblins. Ganon is portrayed by Scott Chernoff.
*'''[[Recurring enemies in The Legend of Zelda series#Wizzrobe|Wizzrobe]]''' – Ganon's sidekick. He first appears after Neil has met Fairy and steals Neil's clothing to lure him to the Level 1 dungeon. He frequently observes logical inconsistencies within the game that are recognizable to fans, such as the maps and keys that are left in the dungeon for Link to find. Whenever he suggests changing the policy to Ganon, he is abused for his presumption, forcing him into the role of a fawning toady. Wizzrobe applies Ganon's [[Cosmetics|makeup]] before his 'big date' with the captive Princess Zelda, prompting Ganon to insinuate that Wizzrobe is infatuated with him, prompting unconvincing denial. Wizzrobe is actually gay and is seen in the finale smooching with the Male Fairy. Wizzrobe is portrayed by Eric Acosta.
*'''[[Universe of The Legend of Zelda#Creatures|Dark Nut]]''' – A powerful dark knight (nonsensically renamed by Ganon to conform to ''The Legend of Zelda'' terminology) introduced by Wizzrobe as an invincible opponent to Neil. The other Dark Nuts are seemingly unfazed by Neil's sword blasts, and the Dark Nut was able to knock him unconscious with a single blow. But in the second episode of the third season it is revealed that, due to budget cuts, the Dark Nuts' armor doesn't cover their butts. This is their only weakness and eventually they are killed by Neil. Darknut has a brother who appears in "The Gloffice" and is seen crying over his dead brothers as Wizzrobe comforts him. In the finale, this Dark Nut is (like Wizzrobe) gay and is seen making out with a Stalfos. Dark Nut is portrayed by Jeff Winkler.
*'''[[Universe of The Legend of Zelda#Creatures|Octorok]]''' – In Season 1, Neil is often plagued by the Octorok creatures. In the show they are depicted as thin men wearing loin cloths and red masks. They announce their presence with an odd ululation, and throw rocks at Neil. They occasionally speak to Neil, usually to threaten him in their scary voice, try to trick him in their squeaky voice, or to plead in their normal voice when one of them is killed by Neil, but generally stick to the ululation. In Season 2 "A Link to the Past" he kills three of them. In "Gettin' High in Hyrule", one of them is used as a dartboard and feels no pain. And in "The Gloffice", one of them works there.
*'''[[Universe of The Legend of Zelda#Creatures|Moblin]]''' – Moblins are strong creatures with three penises who seem to want nothing but to destroy and sodomize Link. The most notable Moblins are [[Dwight Schrute|Blight]] of Ganon's "[[The Office|The Gloffice]]" and the secret moblin, Pippi who helps Link even against his "primal" urges. Moblins are depicted as [[humanoid]] because of the low budget of the series. The Moblins (except Pippi) attack Neil but with some help from the bow, sex with Fairy and sword beams, he kills them all.
*'''[[Universe of The Legend of Zelda#Creatures|Stalfos]]''' – Three Stalfos made only two appearances—in "The Skeletons in Link's Closet" and "Restart of the King". They are portrayed as gay [[skeleton]]s with German accents that mock Neil into killing them. They tease Neil by insulting him and making up some stupid deals causing him to stab two of them and laser the last one. The first one has a key in its ribs and a bandana, the second one has a belt, and the third one has a mustache. One of them is seen in the finale, making out with a Dark Nut.
*'''[[Universe of The Legend of Zelda#Creatures|Keese]]''' – Keeses appear in "The Skeletons in Link's Closet", "A Date with Destiny" and "The Gloffice". They look like models on strings because of the low budget of the series. After Neil puts on the Hero's Clothes, a bat takes a dump on him and they attack him by swarming around him like [[bee]]s. After Neil escapes and kills the Stalfos, the Keeses attack him again. In Season 1 "Map Questing", the Keeses are revealed by Wizzrobe telling Ganon that Neil has killed all the Keeses. Neil kills them in Season 2 in "A Date with Destiny" and one Keese appears in "The Gloffice" talking to Ganon in the introduction.
*'''[[Universe of The Legend of Zelda#Creatures|Goriya]]''' – Three Goriyas make their one appearance in Season 1 in "Map Questing". They are portrayed as goblins with Australian accents, carrying boomerangs. They say to Neil that they're powerful and they've got boomerangs. Neil zaps the three Goriyas with his sword beams. One Goriya appears in a picture in Season 2 "Gettin' High in Hyrule" that says, "Missing. Last seen playing with boomerangs."
*'''[[Universe of The Legend of Zelda#Creatures|Gibdo]]''' – Gibdos appear in three episodes: "Les Neilérables", in which Neil sings after killing them; "A Date with Destiny", in which Neil kills them while they make out and give birth to a baby Gibdo, which Neil kicks away; and "The Gloffice", in which one of them works there.

After getting dressed and obtaining a tiny shield, he enters a cave, where he finds an old man named 'Old Man'. Old Man tells him he is Link, who is on a quest to defeat Lord Gannon and save all of [[Hyrule]], and gives him a wooden sword. Neil leaves the cave and gets stuck in a looped map.

He defeats [[Recurring enemies in The Legend of Zelda series#Goriya|goblins with Australian accents]] and collects a boomerang. Wizrobe questions why Gannon left such useful items for their opponent, and Gannon explains that the purpose is to help his minions if they get lost. Neil runs into ''Old'' Man, and is shown that there is a hidden room on the map; Neil had not noticed that the map was incompletely unfolded. He leaves as Old Man warns him of the boss of level 1, [[Aquamentus|a dragon with a unicorn horn]].
|-

After he recovers consciousness, Neil finds the one part of the room that the dragon can't get to, and the dragon complains that it's not fair. The dragon and Neil commiserate and become friends, and the boss begs for Neil to kill him. Neil collects the first [[Universe of The Legend of Zelda#Triforce|Triforce]] of nine.

|-
|colspan="6" bgcolor="FFFFFF"| The episode begins with a flashback to Neil's failing real life a week earlier. After the flashback, Neil awakes next to the sleeping fairy. He gets up and is attacked by Octoroks. After vanquishing them, he is attacked by a [[Moblin#Moblin|blue troll]], who injures him with an arrow. As he flees, Old Man appears to him with a clue about how to get a candle and a bigger shield. Link escapes into a store and the Moblin captures Fairy in a jar.

Neil quickly loses, and is about to have his eyes confiscated when the Elf Cop breaks in to raid the illegal gambling den. The Elf Cop allows Neil to take the goods he couldn't buy, assuming "Link" to be above stealing.

|-
|colspan="6" bgcolor="FFFFFF"| The episode opens with the Moblin examining his collection of fairies, including Fairy and a Male Fairy. The Male Fairy tries to cheer up Fairy with a happy song, and Fairy joins in with singing about her love of raunchy, abusive sex, nauseating the Male Fairy. Meanwhile, Neil fights an [[Recurring enemies in The Legend of Zelda series#Dodongo|orange triceratops]] and collects the second Triforce. Gannon and Wizrobe are astonished at Neil's accomplishment, but are sure that the next level will destroy him. Neil meets the Old Men, who make fun of him and give him a potion. Zelda, imprisoned, sings of her faith in Neil, while Neil, defeating [[Recurring enemies in The Legend of Zelda series#Gibdo|mummies]], tries to get drunk on potion and wishes he were home. Neil defeats a four-headed plant that is shipped to Gannon, stimulating further consternation in his council. After a grand finale, Wizrobe whispers a new plan to Gannon and Neil discovers a Pub.

|colspan="6" bgcolor="FFFFFF"| Neil, disregarding Old Man's warnings, sneaks into the Pub. He finds a bulletin board with wanted posters for Link, the mass murderer of Hyrule. Disguising himself with a Moblin helmet, he joins the Moblins in the Pub, whose main conversational topic is ways of torturing and killing Link. After a long drunken carouse, Neil's helmet falls off and he is recognized as Link.  He pleads with the Moblins, who are the only friends he has found in Hyrule, but they still want to kill him. Neil runs away and is captured by the Secret Moblin, who misdirects the pursuers.

|colspan="6" bgcolor="FFFFFF"| Neil wakes up in the cave of the Secret Moblin named Pippi, who has fully replenished Neil's heart meter. The Secret Moblin describes his elfin studies, and his need to suppress his base instincts of sodomizing and killing elves. He teaches Neil how to use his "inventory" by holding his items above his head, and he tells Neil of a magic whistle in Level 5 that can send Neil anywhere he wishes. The Secret Moblin begins to lose control of his base instincts and Neil leaves the cave as the Secret Moblin attempts to suppress three simultaneous erections. Neil travels through the desert to find the waterfall that hides the White Sword. However, upon spying the waterfall, he is shot by an arrow in the left arm by the Moblins from the pub.

Neil then dispatches the other Moblins before entering the cave behind the waterfall and attaining the White Sword (the same wooden sword that is painted white) from Old Man.

|colspan="7" bgcolor="FFFFFF"| Series Finale. Neil falls through Spectacle Rock and into Level 9. After fighting through the level and finding Ganon, Neil tries his best to use his weapons against Ganon but he just destroys them and turns invisible. After a few fireball hits, Neil is near death before Old Man returns to battle Ganon. While Old Man distracts Ganon, the Fairy reconciles with Neil and restores him to full health. Ganon kills Old Man, but a fully healed Neil reengages the battle and goads Ganon into fighting hand to hand. Neil gains the upper hand and is about to defeat Ganon when Ganon cheats and begins using fireballs. When Neil is once again almost dead and Ganon holds him from behind, the Fairy attempts to heal him once more, but Wizzrobe intervenes and grabs the Fairy. Neil convinces Wizzrobe to switch sides, and Wizzrobe throws Neil an arrow dipped in silver (also Ganon hits Wizzrobe with a fireball), with which Neil stabs himself with it and it stabs Ganon from behind. Wizzrobe survives the attack but Fairy doesn't. After promising to Fairy about not having sex with anybody (not even himself), Neil retrieves the Triforce of Power from Ganon's remains and frees Princess Zelda. They marry and Neil becomes king. It is then revealed that Wizzrobe is now working for Neil, although he often misses Ganon. Link has integrated the schools to which he sends his fairy children Oold Man's ghost gets laid and Wizrobe is thankful for the new king legalizing gay marriage.

Later, while sitting on the toilet, Neil is sucked through the pipes and comes out dressed as Mario. He encounters his brother, dressed as Luigi, and the two discuss their surroundings. Realizing where he is, Neil and his brother say "Oh, fu-" but they are cut off by a Fade to Black. In a post-credits scene, the title "Super Grimsley Bros." appears while Neil's brother, Darrel, tells him about jumping, smashing blocks, and the Super Star ("pure, uncut cocaine for 15 seconds" as he calls it). While Darrel is rapidly searching on Neil for a Super Star, Wizzrobe, back at the castle, stands on a balcony and is shown a locket with a picture of Ganon, saying "You were just too ugly for this world, my Lord." Just then, a ghostly image of Ganon's hand appears, smacks Wizzrobe in the face, says, "I know Wizzrobe. I miss me too." and Wizzrobes smiles while holding his staff.

'''''The Lincoln Conspiracy''''' is a [[book]] by David W. Balsiger and Charles E. Sellier, Jr. promoting certain [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] concerning the 1865 [[Abraham Lincoln assassination|assassination]] of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]].

==Major themes and arguments==

===Cover-up of the plan to kidnap Lincoln===
The central premise of the book is that "traditional" historians have perpetuated a [[cover-up]], originally orchestrated by Lincoln's [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Edwin M. Stanton]](D) and some [[Radical Republicans|Radical Republican]] allies in 1865, by over-reliance on false documentation produced by Stanton and his conspirators. This was done, the book argues, to disguise the fact that Stanton, Union spy [[Lafayette C. Baker]], [[United States Senator|Senator]] [[Benjamin F. Wade]], Senator [[John Conness]], other congressional Radical Republicans, and a group of Northern bankers and speculators were all involved in a plot to [[kidnap]] Lincoln.  Lincoln was then intended to be hidden for a time while bogus articles of [[impeachment]] would be drafted to remove him as President.  The primary motivations for this supposed plot would have been strong opposition to Lincoln's generous [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] plans and the loss of profits due to Lincoln's restrictions on the cotton trade during the [[U.S. Civil War]].

===Kidnapping changes to assassination===
The book then states that in 1864, Baker uncovered the plans of Lincoln's future assassin, [[John Wilkes Booth]], to kidnap Lincoln with the help of a different group of conspirators with different motives.  The Stanton group, through Baker and Conness, supposedly provided Booth with money and information on Lincoln's movements.  After several abortive attempts, Booth was ordered to halt his efforts in March 1865, and made no further attempts to kidnap Lincoln, but secretly resolved to murder him instead, the book alleges.

===Booth's "incriminating" diary===
Lincoln's assassination by Booth on April 14 is said to have thrown Stanton and his allies into a panic, fearing that their involvement in the kidnap plots would be exposed.  A frantic search soon turned up Booth's coat, which contained a highly incriminating [[diary]] documenting meetings with several members of the Stanton group.  A few days later on April 26, a Confederate double agent ([[James William Boyd]]), [[Mistaken identity|mistakenly identified]] as Booth, was shot and killed in [[Virginia]], according to the authors.  Stanton, aware of the mistaken identity, allegedly saw to it that the [[autopsy]] records were altered to remove or obscure descriptions of the body not consistent with Booth.  Booth's diary, now in Stanton's personal possession, is said to have had 13 pages of incriminating references removed.  Baker quietly pursued the hunt for Booth as far as [[Harper's Ferry, West Virginia]], where the trail went cold.

At the military trials of Booth's conspirators (theorized to not have been members of the Stanton group), held in May and June 1865, the proceedings were rushed, the government produced witnesses against the defendants who the authors suggest were paid, and even the trial records were supposedly altered.  Four of Booth's co-conspirators were hanged on July 7, 1865.  Others received long prison sentences, but Booth himself, the book concludes, eventually escaped to England, his whereabouts after that uncertain.

==Cold reception by historians==
''The Lincoln Conspiracy'' was greeted with hostility and derision from academic [[historian]]s.  Many objections were raised against the book's sensational theories and the authors' use (and misuse) of source materials.&lt;ref&gt;''Lincoln Legends: Myths, Hoaxes, and Confabulations Associated with Our Greatest President'' by Edward Steers Jr. ({{ISBN|1-60671-007-9}}). p.185ff&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Lincoln Conspiracy'' is often considered a form of [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|negationist]] or even [[alternate history]].

''The Lincoln Conspiracy'' was the basis of the [[1977 in film|1977]] [[The Lincoln Conspiracy (film)|film of the same name]] by [[Sunn Classic Pictures]], the publishing division of which also released the book.

'''''The Painter's Studio: A real allegory summing up seven years of my artistic and moral life''''' (''L'Atelier du peintre'') is an 1855 oil on canvas painting by [[Gustave Courbet]]. It is located in the [[Musée d'Orsay]] in Paris, France.

Courbet painted ''The Painter's Studio'' in [[Ornans]], France in 1855.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Riat|2008|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The world comes to be painted at my studio," said Courbet of the [[Realism (art movement)|Realist]] work. The figures in the painting are [[allegory|allegorical]] representations of various influences on Courbet's artistic life. On the left are human figures from all levels of society. In the center, Courbet works on a [[landscape]], while turned away from a nude model who is a symbol of [[Academic art]]. On the right are friends and associates of Courbet, mainly elite Parisian society figures, including [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Champfleury]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], and Courbet's most prominent [[Patronage#Arts|patron]], [[Alfred Bruyas]].&lt;ref name="harvp|Nicolson|1973|p=60"&gt;{{harvp|Nicolson|1973|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|1855 Paris World Fair]]'s jury accepted eleven of Courbet's works for the [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|Exposition Universelle]], but ''The Painter's Studio'' was not among them. In an act of [[Promotion (marketing)|self promotion]] and defiance, Courbet, with the help of [[Alfred Bruyas]], opened his own exhibition (The Pavilion of Realism) close to the official exposition; this was a forerunner of the various [[Salon des Refusés]]. Very little praise was forthcoming, and [[Eugène Delacroix]] was one of the few painters who supported the work. Of the painting, Courbet stated that ''The Painter's Studio'' "represents society at its best, its worst, and its average."&lt;ref name="harvp|Nicolson|1973|p=60"/&gt;

==Description==
The painting was produced during Courbet's involvement with [[Realism (art movement)|Realism]] in art in the mid-1800s. Due to the short amount of time Courbet had to paint it, many original plans for the work had to be discarded. The most noticeable example of this is in the background of the painting. On the back wall of the studio in the painting, Courbet planned to paint replications of other works of his. He ran out of time to paint these in their entirety, so he then covered them up with a reddish-brown preparation color, leaving the partially-finished paintings still relatively visible.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/gust/hd_gust.htm Gustave Courbet (1819–1877)]", The Metropolitan Museum of Art, accessed September 18, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Left side===
The left side of the painting depicts people of everyday life in France.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/works-in-focus/search/commentaire_id/latelier-du-peintre-7091.html?no_cache=1 Gustave Courbet, The Artist's Studio]", Musée d'Orsay, accessed September 18, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The Jewish man and the Irishwoman were seen on a trip Courbet took to London in 1848, according to a letter Courbet wrote to Champfleury detailing what the painting would look like.&lt;ref name="Nicolson_23_33"/&gt; There is also a "[[Mannequin|lay figure]]"/"crucified figure" directly to the left of Courbet's easel. This figure appears contorted and potentially mangled. Art historians Benedict Nicolson and Georges Riat both interpret this figure as a symbol of the "death" of the art of the [[Académie des Beaux-Arts|Royal Academy of Art]] in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nicolson|1973|pp=23, 36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Riat|2008|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Center===
The center of the painting depicts Courbet painting a landscape, a nude female figure, a young boy, and a white cat. On his canvas, Courbet paints the [[Loue|Loue River valley]]. This valley in the [[Franche-Comté]] region of France is a tribute to Courbet's homeland of [[Ornans]], France.&lt;ref name="harvp|Nicolson|1973|p=20"&gt;{{harvp|Nicolson|1973|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The female figure is based on an 1854 photograph by J.&amp;nbsp;V. de Villeneuve and has been interpreted as a representation of the [[Academic art|art of the Academy]] or as Courbet's Muse for Realism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nicolson|1973|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Right side===
The right side of the painting depicts a large number of Paris [[elite]]s, including friends of the artist. These are figures who played a role in the development of Courbet's career as an artist, or who inspired him in some way. Portrayals included on this side of the painting include [[Alfred Bruyas]] (a patron of Courbet), [[Champfleury]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Charles Baudelaire]], and a wealthy pair of art collectors, among other prominent society figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nicolson|1973|pp=52–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; A majority of these portraits were copied from previous portraits or from photographs, since the painting was entirely made in [[Ornans]] but the subjects on this side of the painting resided in Paris. For example, the portrait of Charles Baudelaire was directly copied from Courbet's 1847 portrait of the writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nicolson|1973|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Courbet was in written correspondence with Champfleury in regards to this painting (from which much of the interpretation of ''The Painter's Studio'' is derived) and requested a photograph of Proudhon, the philosopher and anarchist, so that he could be included in the painting. It is the photograph Courbet received from Champfleury on which Proudhon's portrait is based.

==Interpretations==
* The meaning of the oxymoron "real allegory" in the subtitle of the painting, as well as Courbet's intent in conjuring this phrase, is debated.
* Courbet chose to paint the Loué River Valley on his canvas-within-a-canvas as an act of defiant [[Parochialism|provincialism]]. He sought to bring a symbol of his home in the [[Doubs]] department of the [[Franche-Comté]] region of France straight into the heart of [[Paris]] and the eyes of Paris' [[socialite]] art viewers and collectors.&lt;ref name="harvp|Nicolson|1973|p=20"/&gt;
* The skull that rests on a copy of the ''[[Journal des débats]]'' is a symbol of the death of the [[Academic art|art of the Academy]].&lt;ref name="Nicolson_23_33"&gt;{{harvp|Nicolson|1973|pp=23–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The cluster of items at the foot of the hunter (on the left), including a guitar, a dagger, a plumed hat, and a buckled shoe, is a symbol of the death of the [[Romanticism#Romantic visual arts|Romantic art movement]]. It could be a symbol of the death of [[Romanticism#Romantic visual arts|Romanticism]] due to the rising popularity of Realism, or a symbol of the death of Romanticism in Courbet's own oeuvre.&lt;ref name="Nicolson_23_33"/&gt;

'''''Tracking the Chupacabra: The Vampire Beast in Fact, Fiction and Folklore''''' is a non-fiction book by [[Benjamin Radford]], an American writer and investigator. The book documents Radford's five-year investigation into accounts of the [[chupacabra]]. The chupacabra is said to be a vampiric predatory animal that drains the blood of animal victims while avoiding human detection.

==Overview==
The author, Benjamin Radford, attempts to solve the mystery of the [[chupacabra]], including whether it is a legend or real animal, what its physical and behavior characteristics are, its origin and connection to folklore, and what exactly is happening to the animals reported to be its victims.

''Tracking the Chupacabra'' documents Radford's five-year investigation, including his travels into the mysteries surrounding the chupacabra. It also includes his research, with interviews and documentation collected during this process.

Opening with "The Goatsucker Mystery," Radford introduced the essential portions of the [[chupacabra]] legend and its different versions, comparing the creatures' characteristics with another, [[Bigfoot]], which he writes is known for leaving large footprints. In his overview Radford summarized theories concerning the origin of the chupacabra, some paranormal or religious in nature, and interviewed several [[cryptozoology|cryptozoologists]].

In "A Brief history of Vampires," Radford wrote about common themes of vampire folklore. While exploring 18th-century accounts of European vampires, Radford notes that reports of vampire predation are used to explain otherwise unexplained misfortunes, such as disease, malnutrition, or loss of livestock. 

"Chupacabras in Popular Culture" described how, in Radford's view, the legend grew in Puerto Rico from observations by locals of apparent animal predations into rumors of a mysterious creature that was responsible. According to Radford, the news media leapt to conclusions, which, in his opinion, further drove alleged sightings and reports, to the extent that "any odd event"&lt;ref name="radford-2011"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|41}} was attributed to the chupacabra.

The chapter "Searching for Chupacabras in Nicaragua" deals with Radford's investigation in [[Nicaragua]] near the [[San Juan River (Nicaragua)|Río San Juan]], where one of the best known alleged chupacabra remains had been discovered. While performing a physical search for the animal, Radford interviewed local experts, such as guide Fernando Casanova of Nicaragua's Indio Maiz Biological Reserve, about the local understanding of the chupacabra's "character or description," as well as examining tracks found in the area and comparing them to casts reportedly taken from scenes surrounding chupacabra victims.&lt;ref name="radford-2011" /&gt;{{rp|66–72}}

In "The Dead Vampires Speak: Chupacabra Carcasses," Radford discussed the analyses of various recovered corpses put forward as candidates for identification of the chupacabra animal. "The Curious Case of the Cuero Chupacabra" covers the analysis of a carcass of the American canid version of the chupacabra, discovered by a rancher in Cuero, Texas. The chapter also discusses Radford's participation in an episode of [[MonsterQuest#Season two .282008.29|MonsterQuest]], which aired in 2008 during the series' second season. Having analyzed the various forms of chupacabra remains and reports, in "Reconsidering the Goatsucker," Radford attempted to determine the origins of the chupacabra creature.

Radford concluded his investigation with the chapter "The Zoology of Chupacabras and the Science of Vampires." Compiling reports of researchers who examined victims of animal predation in apparent chupacabra attacks, Radford noted that the reports' claims that the animals had been [[Exsanguination|exsanguinated]] were inaccurate. The apparent loss of blood could be explained by internal hemorrhaging and pooling of blood at the bottom of the corpse. The attribution of the attacks on livestock to a vampiric entity can be explained by the puncture wounds resulting from the canine teeth left by most predators, who often instinctively go for the neck, according to taxidermist Jerry Ayer.&lt;ref name="radford-2011" /&gt;{{rp|165}} Radford attributes much of the spread of chupacabra sightings to factors including the mass media (especially the Internet and television shows), eyewitness misperceptions, ignorance of forensic science, social contagion, and mass hysteria,&lt;ref name="radford-2011" /&gt;{{rp|166}} and concludes that "every supposedly mysterious detail of the bloodsucking 'monster-thing' and its victims was explained."&lt;ref name="radford-2011" /&gt;{{rp|169}}

Matt Crowley, reviewing the book for ''[[The Skeptical Inquirer]]'' in July 2011, recapped Radford's process of tracing the origins of reported chupacabra sightings, tracking the changing physical attributes of the creature based on its description as reports journeyed from Puerto Rico eventually traveling to the United States.&lt;ref name="crowley-2011"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Crowley praised what he described as the "elegance" of Radford's investigation, stating that it "lies in the process of the proof, not just the result."&lt;ref name="crowley-2011" /&gt;

Reviewing ''Tracking the Chupacabra'' for ''[[Library Journal]]'', Janet Tapper described Radford as "thorough in his investigation; interviewing witnesses, providing creepy photographs of otherworldly creatures, serving up DNA analysis, and contemplating theories of [[Folie à deux|mass psychosis]]." Tapper recommended the work, stating "this objective probe will appeal to readers interested in exploring and exploding modern mysteries."&lt;ref name="tapper-2011"&gt;

Reviewing the book for the ''[[Journal of Folklore Research]]'', [[Memorial University of Newfoundland]]'s Virginia Fugarino stated that "to date, few books have been dedicated to taking a serious look at this creature," and commented on Radford's treatment of folklore, saying "he particularly explores how the chupacabra and other Latin American vampiric creatures can be seen to represent metaphorically postcolonial concerns and resentment of intrusion from outside political forces, specifically the U.S. government."&lt;ref name="fugarino-2011"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; While criticizing Radford for what Fugarino states is an "at times [...] dismissive tone toward individuals who believe in the creature," she stated that the work was "clear and well presented."&lt;ref name="fugarino-2011" /&gt;

[[Cryptozoology|Cryptozoologist]] [[Karl Shuker]] performed a review of Radford's work in a March 2012 issue of ''[[Fortean Times]]'', stating that "the chupacabra has met its match," recommending the book's "scientific detachment and common sense" for readers looking for those traits.&lt;ref name="shuker-2012"&gt;

In a review for ''Aztlán'', an interdisciplinary journal of [[Chicano|Chicano studies]] published by the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], [[San Diego State University]]'s William A. Nericcio wrote that "the power of Radford's work is the depth of his research." Nericcio went on to discuss the impact of Radford's investigation on the dialogue regarding the cultural impact of the chupacabra in the Latin American community. According to Nericcio, "the rise of evangelical churches in Latin America and the American Southwest [...] coincides with sightings of the chupacabra and the virus-like spread of its mythology," referring to the perceived connection by some proponents between the chupacabra and satanic or occult phenomena.&lt;ref name="nericcio-2012"&gt;

A reviewer for ''The Latin Americanist'', the [[University of Oklahoma]]'s J. Justin Castro noted that chupacabra reports have "captured the imagination of people around the world," and praised Radford's "insightful and entertaining book," stating that "Radford sets the record straight, debunking many of the myths about the goatsucker." While Castro criticized some of Radford's arguments concerning feelings of U.S. exploitation of Puerto Rico as "largely unfounded," Castro stated that "His concluding arguments, on the other hand, are more viable. He makes a strong case that cinema greatly influenced the chupacabra phenomenon."&lt;ref name="castro-2012"&gt;

Tim Hull, in ''[[Tucson Weekly]]'', stated that "Radford's most interesting revelations are about the psychological and sociopolitical structures behind the folklore, especially as they relate to the monster's origins in Puerto Rico, where some people believe that the chupacabra is a secret U.S. government experiment gone wrong." Hull also went on to say that "While Radford's book—which is well-written and a fun read—should be the last word on the chupacabra's real-world existence, it won't be. As the author points out, the beast has entered the realm of conspiracy, where no amount of evidence, or logic, can sway the true believer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hull|first=Tim|title=Debunking Chupacabra: The managing editor of 'Skeptical Inquirer' says no to a mythical beast|url=http://www.tucsonweekly.com/tucson/debunking-chupacabra/Content?oid=2950786|work=Tucson Weekly|accessdate=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jay Koester, in ''[[El Paso Times]]'', called Radford's book "[...] an enjoyable ride." Koester also went on to say that "The legend doesn't hold up well under Radford's scientific microscope, but the curious will still love this tour through the tall tales."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Koester|first=Jay|title=No monsters here: Investigator locates the chupacabra in legend only|url=http://www.elpasotimes.com/living/ci_18017017|work=El Paso Times|accessdate=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosanne Boyett, in the Cibola County Beacon, stated that "Radford questions documented reports and the resulting conclusions. But the author’s criticisms leave him vulnerable to accusations of racial prejudice, particularly the references to eyewitnesses’ reports."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boyett|first=Rosanne|title=Tracking the Chupacabra|url=http://www.cibolabeacon.com/features/book-review/article_7ff87270-9303-544e-9372-ce24d5aa6416.html?mode=story|work=Cibola County Beacon|accessdate=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The staff at ''[[Fate (magazine)|Fate]]'' magazine stated that "[...] Tracking the Chupacabra is by no means another collection of witness accounts and unsubstantiated facts. The author has not only gone on an expedition to find the elusive beast (complete with all the expected disappointment) but has researched just about every reported Chupacabra encounter with the journalistic zeal of Woodward and Bernstein."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tracking the Chupacabra: A fascinating book regarding the chupacabra in America|url=http://www.fatemag.com/inside-fate/book-reviews/tracking-the-chupacabra/|work=Fate Magazine|accessdate=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review for [[The Skeptics Society]], [[Sharon A. Hill]] called the book "[...] satisfying for those willing to consider a legitimate, evidence-based explanation." Hill went on to say that "I’m hard pressed to find any stone unturned in this stunning exposé of the first Internet-age cryptid."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hill|first=Sharon | authorlink=Sharon A.

'''Typometry''' was a short-lived [[relief printing]] technique developed during the [[18th century|18th]] and [[19th century|19th]] centuries to compose [[cartography|maps]], drawings and other designs, using [[moveable type]] to reproduce words, lineworks and map symbols.&lt;ref name ="woodward"&gt;{{cite book |last=Woodward |first=David |date=2007 |title=The History of Cartography |url=http://www.press.uchicago.edu/books/HOC/HOC_V3_Pt1/HOC_VOLUME3_Part1_chapter22.pdf |volume=3 |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |page=600 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hammann"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hammann |first1= J.

==History==

=== Renaissance precursors ===

During the European Renaissance, many engravers and printers revolved to typography to solve the problem of small lettering on maps, which was very difficult to reproduce solely by using custom engraved lettering. One of the techniques they relied on was the setting of metal type, which was fitted inside a special form, surrounded by spacing material. Words set that way could then be overprinted over woodcut-printed maps as a separate plate, either in black or coloured ink.&lt;ref name ="woodward"/&gt; This technique has been considered a precursor of the typometric technique of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harris |first1=Elizabeth |last2= |first2= |date= |year=1975 |title=Five Centuries of Map Printing |trans-title= |url= |access-date=|dead-url= |format= |language= |location= |publisher=David Woodward, Ed. |chapter=Miscellaneous Map Printing Processes in the Nineteenth Century |pages=113–36 |isbn= |archive-url= |archive-date= |via= |subscription= |quote= |trans-quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 18th century inventors ===

In the 18th century, the German deacon [[August Gottlieb Preuschen]] (1734–1803), from [[Karlsruhe]], published two books on the art of printing maps using [[movable type]].&lt;ref name="mayeul"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mayeul Chaudon |first1=Louis |last2= |first2= |date=1810 |title=Dictionnaire universel, historique, critique et bibliographique. |trans-title=Universal, historical, critical and bibliographic dictionary |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4StlAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA198 |dead-url= |volume=VIII |language=French |location= |publisher= |isbn= |archive-url= |archive-date= |pages=198–199 |subscription= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The books were printed in [[Basel|Basel, Switzerland]], using type from the foundry ''[[Haas'sche Schriftgiesserei]]'', by [[Wilhelm Haas-Münch]] (1741–1800). Wilhelm Haas-Münch has been quoted as the inventor of typometry in 1776&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/f/F41191.php |title=Haas, Wilhelm |language=French |date= |website=Historische Lexikon der Schweiz |publisher= |access-date= |quote=Il inventa en 1772 une presse à bras où les jumelles de bois étaient remplacées par des pièces métalliques et en 1776 l'impression cartographique en caractères mobiles.}}&lt;/ref&gt;, in competition with Johann Gottlob Breitkopf of Leipzig.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |last2= |first2= |last3= |first3= |last4= |first4=| year=2007 |title=Typometry: a successful technique for producing up-to-date maps. |trans-title= |url= |language=English |journal=Cartographica Helvetica |volume= |issue=35-38 |pages= |doi= |access-date= |quote= |publisher=Arbeitsgruppe für Kartengeschichte der Schweizerischen Gesellschaft für Kartographie}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''typometrie'' was proposed by August Gottlieb Preuschen himself, the former name of the method being ''ingénieurie d'estampes'' (sic.)

In the early 19th century, two different issues of a French review called the ''[[Bulletin de la Société d’Encouragement pour l’Industrie Nationale]]'' contains articles about typometry. The first one, of 1808, refers to the research work of Mr. Periaux and Mr. Poterat, to produce typometric maps, in order to generate a viable alternative to engraved maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |language=French |date=1808 |title=Cartes typo-géographiques |url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=sfU9AAAAcAAJ |journal=Bulletin de la Société d’Encouragement pour l’Industrie Nationale, septième année |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |access-date=October 31, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The second article, of 1825, introduces the advancements made by [[Firmin Didot]], son, in the technique of printing maps by using typographic means.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |last2= |first2= |date=1825 |title=Typographie |url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=YMjsK3M7-z0C |journal=Bulletin de la Société d’Encouragement pour l’Industrie Nationale, vingt-quatrième année |volume= |issue= |page=62 |doi= |access-date=October 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Didot, and util 1832, printers Wegener the Young in Berlin&lt;ref name="cherbuliez"/&gt; and Georg Michael Bauerkeller (1805-1886) in Frankfurt am Main&lt;ref name="falkenstein"/&gt; did some essays with the technique for producing maps, but without attaining much success.

It was not until 1839 in Vienna that Slovak cartographer [[Franz Raffelsperger]] (1793-1861), having prefected his own printing methods without knowing the work of his predecessors, produced a typometric postal card of the Austrian Empire of unprecedented quality.&lt;ref name="cherbuliez"/&gt; This postal card was rewarded with the golden medal at the industrial exhibition that took place that year in Vienna,&lt;ref name="cherbuliez"/&gt; and the next year he opened his own typometric press in that city.&lt;ref name="hammann"/&gt; Raffelsperger produced moveable type characters that allowed him to print every possible feature in a map, including geographic and topographic features, mathematical and geometric symbols, architectural landmarks and even plants and animals. He also designed custom symbols for cities, forests and other elements, that he printed in five different text sizes and in several languages. He then combined these this typometric technique with polychromy, so he could print moveable type characters for each geographical feature of the map with their very own precise colour hue. The different available sizes of his printing components allowed him to print his maps in several sizes without losing quality, and that at a very reduced cost.&lt;ref name="cherbuliez"/&gt;

After Raffelsperger, other European printers continued to experiment with typometry, and several examples were presented at the [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|1855 International Exhibition]] in Paris.&lt;ref name="cherbuliez"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt; See, on that issue, {{cite book |last1=Madinier |first1=Henry |year=1855 |title=Notes sur les principaux produits exposés de l'imprimerie |trans-title= |url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=HelRAAAAcAAJ |access-date=|dead-url= |format= |language=French |location= |publisher=Imprimerie Administrative de P. Dupont |page= |pages= |isbn= |archive-url= |archive-date= |via= |subscription= |quote= |trans-quote=}}, where typometry is referred to as ''travail en filets typographiques'' (''work with typographic threads'' in French).&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the advent of [[lithography]], invented by [[Alois Senefelder]] in 1796, typometry was confronted with another method that was even better at reproducing detail and that allowed to print several solid colours at a low price, so it was progressively abandoned.&lt;ref name="typografie"/&gt;

'''Xuan paper''' (''xuanzhi'' {{zh|t=[[wikt:宣紙|宣紙]]|s=[[wikt:宣纸|宣纸]]|p={{linktext|xuānzhǐ}}}}), or '''Shuen paper''' or '''rice paper''', is a kind of [[paper]] originating in ancient [[China]] used for writing and painting. Xuan paper is renowned for being soft and fine textured, suitable for conveying the artistic expression of both [[Chinese calligraphy]] and painting.

== Origin ==
Xuan paper was first mentioned in ancient Chinese books ''Notes of Past Famous Paintings'' and ''[[New Book of Tang]]''. It was originally produced in the [[Tang dynasty]] in [[Jing County, Anhui|Jing County]], which was under the jurisdiction of [[Xuancheng|Xuan Prefecture]] (Xuanzhou), hence the name Xuan paper. During the Tang dynasty, the paper was often a mixture of [[hemp]] (the first fiber used for paper in China) and mulberry fiber.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Technology, treatment, and care of a chinese wood block print|author1=Fei Wen Tsai|author2=Dianne van der Reyden|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|p=4|url=https://www.si.edu/mci/downloads/RELACT/chinese_prints.pdf}} originally appeared as "Analysis of modern Chinese paper and treatment of a Chinese woodblock print" in ''The Paper Conservator'', 1997, pp. 48-62&lt;/ref&gt; By the [[Song dynasty]], the paper producing industries in Huizhou and Chizhou were gradually transferred to Jing County.

== Classification ==
Due to different producing methods, Xuan paper can be classified into ''Shengxuan'', ''Shuxuan'', and ''Banshuxuan''. Shengxuan (literally "Raw Xuan"), which is not specially processed, excels in its ability to absorb water, causing the ink on it to blur. Shuxuan (literally "Ripe Xuan"), however, has [[Potassium alum]] worked into it during production, which results in a stiffer texture, a reduced ability to absorb water, and less resistance to shear stress (meaning that it can be torn much more easily). This feature makes Shuxuan more suitable for [[Gongbi]] rather than Xieyi. Banshuxuan (literally "Half-ripe Xuan") has intermediate absorbability, between Shengxuan and Shuxuan.

== Features ==
Xuan paper features great tensile strength, smooth surface, pure and clean texture and clean stroke, great resistance to crease, corrosion, moth and mold. The majority of ancient Chinese books and paintings by famous painters that survived until today are well preserved on Xuan paper. Xuan paper won the Golden Award at the Panama International Exposition in 1915. Xuan paper was used to make scrolls.

== Material and production ==
The material Xuan paper uses is closely related to the geography of Jing County. The bark of ''[[Pteroceltis tatarinowii]]'', a common species of [[elm]] in the area, was used as the main material to produce Xuan paper. [[Rice]], along with several other materials, was subsequently added to the recipe in the Song and Yuan Dynasties. [[Bamboo]] and [[mulberry]] also began to be used to produce xuan paper around that time.

The production of Xuan paper can be loosely described as an 18-step process, and a detailed account would involve over a hundred. Some paper makers have invented steps which have been kept secret from others. The process includes steaming and bleaching the bark of ''Pteroceltis tatarinowii'', as well as the addition of a variety of juices.

The '''Teatro Zorrilla''' or '''Zorrilla Theatre''', also known as the '''''Duláang Zorrilla sa Maynila''''' ("Zorrilla Theater in Manila") in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], was a prominent theatre in the [[Philippines]]. Once located along Calle Iris (now a part of [[C.M. Recto Avenue]]), [[Manila]], the theatre was named after [[José Zorrilla]] (1817 - 1893), a [[Spanish people|Spanish]] poet and playwright. The building, which had a seating capacity of 900 people, was officially opened on 17 August 1893, and it was the venue for [[Spanish-language]] and Tagalog-language stage performances.&lt;ref name=Retrato&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.retrato.com.ph/photodtl.asp?id=AR00382 |title=Zorrilla Theater |publisher=Filipinas Heritage Library (A Division of Ayala Foundation, Inc.), Retrato.com |accessdate=19 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722141049/http://www.retrato.com.ph/photodtl.asp?id=AR00382 |archivedate=July 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Östra Hoby Church''' ({{lang-sv|Östra Hoby kyrka}}) is a medieval [[Lutheran]] church built in the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style. Located 4 km east of [[Borrby]] in [[Skåne County]] in southern [[Sweden]], it belongs to the [[Diocese of Lund]]. The church is noted for its frescos and for its sculpted [[baptismal font]].&lt;ref name=sk&gt;[http://www.svenskakyrkan.se/default.aspx?id=749101 "Östra Hoby kyrka"], Svenska kyrkan. {{sv icon}} Retrieved 10 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and architecture==
Built of [[travertine]], the [[apse]] and [[chancel]] are the earliest parts of the church, dating from the early 12th century. The [[nave]] was added in the second half of the 12th century, possibly in connection with an early tower. The two arms of the [[transept]] were added much later in 1850.&lt;ref name=nk&gt;[http://www.nordenskirker.dk/Tidligere/Oesthoby_kirke/Oesthoby_kirke.htm "Östra Hoby kirke"], ''Nordens kirker''. {{da icon}} Retrieved 10 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interior==
The [[altarpiece]] (1654) has elements in both the [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] styles. Its paintings depict scenes from the Old and New Testaments. The [[pulpit]] bears the date of 1651 but is probably older as it includes the arms of Queen [[Anne of Denmark]] who died in 1619. It is said the pulpit was intended for [[Trinity Church, Kristianstad]] but was brought here after the ship transporting it was stranded.&lt;ref name=sk/&gt;&lt;ref name=nk/&gt;

The font, sculpted with a figure of Christ enthroned, is the work of the 12th-century craftsman [[Majestatis]], also known as the Tryde Master.&lt;ref name=sk/&gt;

==Frescos==
[[File:Nordenskirker Oesthoby17.jpg|thumb|The [[Mercy seat|Mercy Seat]] fresco in the apse, altered from an earlier [[Christ in Majesty|Majestas]]]]
The church has frescos from various periods. In the apse and on the east wall of the nave there are fragments of late Romanesque decorations from the second half of the 13th century. Immediately after completion of the ceiling vaults in the 15th century, their ribs and arches were decorated with ornaments. Remains of these can be seen in various places. Around 1460, the arches were decorated with vines by the [[Fjälkinge Church|Fjälkinge Workshop]] which probably also altered a fresco of the Majestas in the apse to one of the Mercy Seat. Traces of the original Majestas rainbow can still be seen. The frescos in the apse and on the vaults were improved and extended from 1500 to 1515 by the Åle Workshop which worked around [[Aarhus]] in Denmark. The same workshop probably also painted the frescos in the vestibule under the tower.&lt;ref name=nk/&gt;

The chancel vault contains frescos of the apostles by the Åle Workshop. The ribbons of text include remnants from the [[Apostles' Creed|Creed]] and the names of the apostles. On the chancel wall there are images of Anne and Mary with Jesus on her lap. Among the frescos on the vaulting at the point where the transept crosses the nave, there are fragments of the story of Adam and Eve. The serpent in one of the scenes is shaped like the figure of a woman bearing an apple for Adam and Eve.&lt;ref name=nk/&gt;
