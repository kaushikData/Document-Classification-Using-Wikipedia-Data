      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2301">The '''1988 Oshakati bomb blast''' was a bombing in [[Oshakati]], [[Ovamboland]], [[South West Africa]] (now [[Oshana Region]], [[Namibia]]) which killed 27 people and left 70 others injured on 19 February 1988. The target of the bombing was the [[Barclays plc|Barclay]]'s Bank in the town. The perpetrators were never identified or convicted. Both the [[South Africa]]n police and [[South West Africa People's Organization]] (SWAPO), the major independence movement in Namibia, were blamed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.klausdierks.com/Chronology/130.htm THE INDEPENDENCE PROCESS LEADS TO NAMIBIA'S FREEDOM: 1988-1990] KlausDierks.com&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the blast, both SWAPO and the South African authorities blamed each other.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/20/world/bomb-kills-14-near-a-base-in-namibia.html Bomb Kills 14 Near a Base in Namibia] The New York Times, February 20, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
19 February, the day of the blast, was a Wednesday at the end of the month, which is the traditional time when state employees were paid. At approximately noon, a car bomb exploded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://google.com/search?q=cache:NJEUechmtgwJ:www.nied.edu.na/publications/journals/journal14/14art1.pdf+1988+Oshakati+bombing&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;gl=us Sharing research techniques in the new millennium: Drawing from the experience of the Oshakati bomb blast] Journal for Educational Reform in Namibia, Journal 14, May 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Oshakati in the 1980s was a major hub for both the South African military as well as the [[bantustan]] Ovamboland government.

==Commemorations==
In the years since the bombing, the day has been marked by commemorations by many Namibians, including prominent religious leaders and politicians. They called for national reconciliation in honour of the victims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.namibian.com.na/2007/February/national/07791B7A3A.html Oshakati bomb blast remembered]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} The Namibian, 20 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''61st Anti-aircraft Missiles Regiment "Pelindava"''' (''Regimentul 61 Rachete Antiaeriene'') is an [[air defense]] regiment of the [[Romanian Land Forces]]. Its headquarters are located in [[Slobozia]]. The regiment was part of the [[6th Anti-aircraft Missiles Brigade (Romania)|6th Anti-aircraft Missile Brigade]], which was disbanded in 2006, due to a reorganization process of the Romanian Land Forces. Later on, it was part of the 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missiles Regiment subordinated to the [[1st Infantry Division (Romania)|1st Infantry Division]]. This unit operated the [[S-75 Dvina|S-75 "Volhov"]] and the modern [[MIM-23 Hawk]] [[surface-to-air missile]] systems. 

The main units of the regiment were the 1st Anti-aircraft Missiles Battalion and the 2nd Anti-aircraft Missiles Battalion ''Pelendava'' [http://www.expomil.ro/upload/230.pdf]{{dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. When Romania's divisions were reorganized and the [[2nd Infantry Division (Romania)|2nd Infantry Division]] was created from units previously belonging to the 1st and 2nd divisions, the ''Pelendava'' Battalion was raised to a regiment and kept with the 1st Division, while the 1st Anti-aircraft Missiles Battalion was transferred to the 2nd Division.

'''''A Fada Oriana''''' ({{OCLC|4063855}}), [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for ''The Fairy [[Oriana]]'', is one of the most emblematic [[Children's literature|children's book]] of [[Portuguese literature]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Otto Coelho|first1=Sara|title=A Menina do Mar e a Fada Oriana chegam ao Panteão|url=http://observador.pt/2014/07/02/poetisa-que-entrou-na-literatura-infantil-para-acalmar-os-filhos-com-sarampo/|website=[[Observador]]|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=2014-07-02|quote=A Menina do Mar e A Fada Oriana são [...] os mais icónicos (''A Menina do Mar'' and ''A Fada Oriana'' are [...] the most iconic [...])|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; written in 1958 by [[Sophia de Mello Breyner Andresen]].

The main character is a [[fairy]] who was given the responsibility of ensuring the well-being of a [[forest]] and its inhabitants, the animals and plants. After a while, Oriana befriends a nefarious fish, and while contemplating her image reflected in the river, Oriana is mesmerized by the fish. Deceived by the words of this fish, Oriana ends up neglecting and abandoning the forest, with serious consequences for its denizens. Deprived of her powers as punishment for this failure, Oriana begins a journey of self-consciousness to repair the evils caused by her omission.

The book is a subject on Portuguese Language teaching curricula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Excerpt of sami drum with some typical motives.png|thumb|Excerpt of a [[sami drum]] of the southern sami type, with three typical motives emphasized: the [[bear cache|storage house]] (1), the [[Animal pound|pound]] (2) and the mother goddesses ''Sáráhkká'', ''Juoksáhkká'' and ''Uksáhkká'' (3-5).]]
'''Akka''' is a female spirit in [[Sami shamanism]], and [[Finnish mythology|Finnish]] and [[Estonian mythology]]. Its [[worship]] was common and took the forms of [[sacrifice]], [[prayer]] and various other [[ritual]]s. Some [[Sámi people|Sámi]] believed it lived under their tents. As with other gods, its name appears within some geographical names, leaving a legacy of Sami presence.

== Sami mythology ==
*Maderakka, the first akka, was mother of the tribe, goddess of women and children, she who gives humans their bodies. Women and girls belong to her, as do boys until they are declared men. Maderakka is popular among modern Sámi [[feminism|feminists]]. Her three daughters are:
**Sarakka, the goddess of [[fertility]], [[menstruation]], [[love]], [[human sexuality]], [[pregnancy]] and [[childbirth]]. After a birth, a woman would eat a special porridge dedicated to Sarakka. The modern Sámi women's organisation '''The Sarahkka''' formed in 1988 and is named in honor of her.&lt;ref name=Andrews&gt;{{cite web|last=Andrews|first=Sara|title=Women in Saami Society|url=https://www.utexas.edu/courses/sami/dieda/hist/women.htm|accessdate=11 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Olakunle web"&gt;{{cite web|last=Olakunle|first=Olusegun Olawale|title=The Sarahkka – Sámi womans organization|url=http://site.uit.no/ruhta/sarahkka/|website=Project 200501253-39|publisher=University of Trømso|accessdate=11 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Olakunle&gt;{{cite book|last=Olakunle|first=Olusegun Olawale|title=The Sarahkka and The Sami Nisson Forum : a general overview of their historical background, and a consideration on the roles of these Sámi women organisations in the quest for the right to self-determination of the Sámi indigenous peoples of Norway|year=2006|publisher=O. O. Olakunle|location=Tromsø}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**Juksakka, "akka with an arrow", the protector of children.
**Uksakka, who shapes the fetus in the mother's womb and assigns humans their sexes.
*Jabme-Akka, "the akka of the dead", is a [[goddess]] of the [[underworld]]. She soothes the [[spirit]]s of [[Infant mortality|dead babies]], but all other spirits dwell in sorrow. Her land of the dead is said to mirror of the land of the living, where everything is opposite. So, the dead are buried with the essentials of living (e.g. [[knife|knives]]) and anything that would make their [[afterlife]] better.

==Finnish and Estonian mythologies==
In [[Finnish mythology]], '''Akka''' is the wife of [[Ukko]] and is the goddess of fertility. As they make love, [[thunder]] rolls. She can be seen as the female side of nature, ''Maaemonen'' "mother earth", whom Ukko fertilizes.

In [[Estonian mythology]], she is known as '''Maan-Emo'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Larousse encyclopedia of mythology |last=Guirand |first=Félix |authorlink=  |year=1959 |publisher=Prometheus Press |page=318 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EBEPAQAAIAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A guide to the gods |last=Carlyon |first=Richard |authorlink=  |year=1981 |publisher=Heinemann/Quixote |page=257 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=57YoAAAAYAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arbeiter Zeitung''' (meaning “Workers’ Newspaper” in English)  was the daily of the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Social Democrat Party]] and published in Austria. It existed between 1889 and 1991.

==History and profile==
''Arbeiter Zeitung'' was started on 12 July 1889 by the Socialist Party&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Austria Press|url=http://www.pressreference.com/A-Be/Austria.html|work=Press Reference|accessdate=18 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Victor Adler]]. The paper was banned in 1934 after the 13 February issue, but reappeared on 4 August 1945 as the main organ of the Austrian Social Democrat Party, continuing until 1989, providing general coverage of Austrian and international news. From 1985 through 1989 it was published under the title '''''Neue AZ'''''; from 1989 to 1991 it was published as '''''AZ'''''.&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress Catalog&lt;/ref&gt; From 1989 until 1991 it was published as an independent newspaper, and ceased publication in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;"The Feuilleton of the Viennese Arbeiter-Zeitung 1918-1934: Production Parameters and Personality Problems" Deborah Holmes, ''Austrian Studies,'' '''14''' (1), 1 October 2006, pp. 99-117 [http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/mhra/aus/2006/00000014/00000001/art00005 abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Mary Kelly|editor2=Gianpietro Mazzoleni|editor3=Denis McQuail|title=The Media in Europe: The Euromedia Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HYCVxSFNNpkC&amp;pg=PA5|date=31 January 2004|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-0-7619-4131-6|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s the circulation of the daily reached 100,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Austria Press|url=http://www.pressreference.com/A-Be/Austria.html|work=Press Reference|accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper reduced its circulation by one quarter from 1960 to 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jens Lucht|author2=Linards Udris|title=Transformation of media structures and media content.

Among its noted contributors and editors in the pre-war period was its cultural editor [[David Josef Bach]].&lt;ref&gt;"David Josef Bach and Christian Glanz, (1 October 2006).

There are 228 BCUs (or equivalent units) in England and Wales.

Most forces are divided into at least three BCUs and some have many more. Most BCUs are further subdivided into smaller units. The BCU is usually commanded by a [[Chief Superintendent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Neighbourhood Statistics |url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/MetadataDownloadPDF.do?downloadId=21433 |title=Notifiable Offences Recorded by the Police 2001/2002 |publisher=Neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metropolitan Police==
The [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] use the term '''Borough Operational Command Unit''' (BOCU) for regional units (which are based on the 32 [[London boroughs]]). The term '''Operational Command Unit''' (OCU) is used for specialised units, for example the [[Aviation Security Operational Command Unit|Aviation Security OCU]].

However, since March 2018 the Metropolitan Police now has 3 BCU's "Basic Command Units". 
1) Central North - the joining of Islington and Camden Boroughs.
2) East Area - the joining of Barking and Dagenham, Havering and Redbridge Boroughs.
3) Central East - the joining of Tower Hamlets and Hackney boroughs.

==West Midlands Police==
[[West Midlands Police]] is split into 10 '''Local Policing Units''' (LPUs). Each LPU is in turn organized into four ''Core Policing Teams'' (CPTs) that manage its different core functions: [[West Midlands Police#Investigation Teams|Investigation]], [[West Midlands Police#Neighbourhood Teams|Neighbourhood]], [[West Midlands Police#Response Teams|Response]] and [[West Midlands Police#Community Action &amp; Priority Teams (CAPT)|Community Action and Priority Team (CAPT)]].

==Warwickshire Police==
[[Warwickshire Police]] has abolished BCUs, the first British territorial police force to do so. The force is now divided directly into five Districts, each headed by a [[Chief Inspector]]. These were formerly grouped into two Areas (BCUs), North and South, each headed by a [[Chief Superintendent#United Kingdom|Chief Superintendent]].

The '''Catalan Republic''' ({{lang-ca|República Catalana}}, {{IPA-ca|rəˈpubːlikə kətəˈlanə|IPA}}) was a state proclaimed in 1931 by [[Francesc Macià]] as the "Catalan Republic within the [[Iberian federalism|Iberian Federation]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spain: Macià's Catalonia|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,753330,00.html|magazine=Time |first= |last= |date=20 June 1932 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It existed between 14 and 17 April 1931.

==History==

[[File:Francesc Macia.JPG|thumb|140px|left|Francesc Macià i Llussà]]
[[File:Fitxer Proclamació de la República Plaça Sant Jaume. Fotògraf Josep Maria Sagarra, 1931.jpg|left|thumb|Proclamation of the Republic in [[Plaça de Sant Jaume]], Barcelona, 14 April 1931]]
By the [[Pact of San Sebastián]] (August 17, 1930), the Spanish republican parties agree to prepare a change of regime in case of victories in the following elections. In this project, there was a provision for the political autonomy of Catalonia, within the Republic. On 14 April 1931, after the municipal elections which gave in Catalonia the large majority to a party founded three weeks before of the elections by the union of the independentist [[Estat Català]] and the Catalan Republican Party, the [[Republican Left of Catalonia]] (ERC), its leader Francesc Macià, few hours before the proclamation of the [[Second Spanish Republic]] in Madrid, from the balcony of the [[Palau de la Generalitat de Catalunya|Palace of the Generalitat]] (then the seat of the Provincial Deputation of Barcelona), proclaimed the "Catalan Republic, expecting that the other peoples of Spain constitute themselves as republics, in order to establish the Iberian Confederation".&lt;ref&gt;Juliá, Santos (2009). ''La Constitución de 1931.'' Lustel, Madrid pp. 31-32 {{ISBN|978-84-9890-083-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macià was appointed as acting president.

Immediately, Macià began exercising power and dismissed General Despujols, chief of the Spanish Army in Barcelona, appointing [[Eduardo López Ochoa|General López Ochoa]], loyal to the new republican government in his place, while his companion of party, [[Lluís Companys]], was designated civil governor of [[Province of Barcelona|Barcelona]]. He also appointed the ministers of the Catalan government, dominated by the Republican Left of Catalonia, and included a member of the [[Radical Republican Party]] and another from the [[Unión General de Trabajadores|UGT]] trade union, but none from the conservative [[Regionalist League]] (on the streets many citizens said against the leader of the League "Long live Macià and death to [[Francesc Cambó|Cambó]]!").&lt;ref&gt;Balcells, Albert (2006). «El reto de Cataluña». La Aventura de la Historia (15). ISSN 1579-427X.&lt;/ref&gt; The government also had representatives from the [[Socialist Union of Catalonia]] and [[Acció Catalana]], and Macià even offered a ministry to the anarchist [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]], but the anarcho-syndicalist organization finally refused to participate, claiming its traditional apoliticism.

The provisional government of the Catalan Republic was formed by:


* President: [[Francesc Macià]] ([[Republican Left of Catalonia]])
* Minister of Politics: [[Ventura Gassol]] (Republican Left of Catalonia)
* Minister of Instruction: [[Rafael Campalans]] ([[Socialist Union of Catalonia]])
* Minister of Defence: [[Joan Casanovas]] (Republican Left of Catalonia)
* Minister of the Treasury: [[Casimir Giralt]] ([[Radical Republican Party]])
* Minister of Economy and Work: [[Manuel Serra i Moret]] (Socialist Union of Catalonia)
* Minister of Comunications: [[Manuel Carrasco i Formiguera]] ([[Acció Catalana]])
* Minister of Public Works: [[Salvador Vidal i Rosell]] ([[Unión General de Trabajadores]])

Three days later, the government of the new Spanish Republic, worried about this proclamation, sent three ministers ([[Fernando de los Ríos]], [[Lluis Nicolau d'Olwer|Lluís Nicolau d'Olwer]] and [[Marcel·lí Domingo]]) to Barcelona in order to negotiate with Macià and the Catalan government. Macià reached an agreement with the ministers, in which the Catalan Republic was renamed Generalitat of Catalonia (Catalan: [[Generalitat de Catalunya]]), becoming an autonomous government within the Spanish Republic, that would be granted an [[Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia of 1932|Statute of Autonomy]] after the elections to [[Cortes Generales|Spanish Cortes]]. Francesc Macià would be the [[President of the Generalitat of Catalonia]] (as acting until November 1932, when it was elected by the [[Parliament of Catalonia]]) until his death in December 1933.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4323">The '''Constitution (Amendment No. 24) Act, 1936''' ([[Act of parliament|Act]] no. 18 of 1936; previously [[bill (law)|Bill]] no. 20 of 1934) was an act of the [[Oireachtas (Irish Free State)|Oireachtas]] (parliament) of the [[Irish Free State]] which abolished [[Seanad Éireann (Irish Free State)|Seanad Éireann]], the [[upper house]] of the Oireachtas, which thenceforth was [[unicameral]], with [[Dáil Éireann (Irish Free State)|Dáil Éireann]] as the sole house. The bill was introduced in 1934 by [[Government of the 8th Dáil|the Fianna Fáil government]] of [[Éamon de Valera]], which was frustrated by the Seanad's repeated use of its power to delay (though not veto) legislation. In particular, [[Fianna Fáil]] favoured eliminating [[Monarchy in the Irish Free State|symbols of monarchy]] from the Free State, which the Seanad, with more [[Southern Irish unionism|Southern Unionist]] members, feared would [[Ireland–United Kingdom relations|antagonise the United Kingdom]].

The act deleted 16 articles of the [[Constitution of the Irish Free State|1922 Constitution]] and made consequential amendments to  numerous others. It also increased from the threshold for passing a [[Resolution (law)|resolution]] of [[impeachment]] (of [[Judiciary of the Republic of Ireland|judges]] or the [[Comptroller and Auditor General of Ireland|Comptroller and Auditor General]]) from a simple [[majority]] to a four-sevenths [[supermajority]], since only one house, rather than two, would thenceforth be voting on such a resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.lawlibrary.ie/rss/barreview/3-2013.pdf |publisher=Law Library |location=Dublin |format=PDF |journal=Bar Review |date=June 2013 |title=The Proposed Abolition of the Seanad and the Implications for Judicial Independence |first=Bláthna |last=Ruane}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

When [[Seanad Éireann|a new Seanad]] was created by the [[Constitution of Ireland|1937 Constitution]] it was in a weakened form with measures to ensure a likely government majority (such as allowing 11 senators to be [[nominated by the Taoiseach]] of the day). A [[Thirty-second Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2013|2013 attempt to abolish the Seanad]] was rejected by referendum.

The popularity of '''cycling in Malta''' as a sport, a means of commuting, and as a way of exploring the island of [[Malta]] is on the increase. In recent years, the Maltese authorities, most notably the Malta Transport Authority, have worked hard to make this activity more accessible and safer {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}. Thanks also to some pioneering enterprises in this area,&lt;ref&gt;[1] Malta By Bike – http://www.maltabybike.com - Retrieved 4 Feb 2011&lt;/ref&gt; cycling is becoming a viable alternative to private cars for travel in the island.

==History==
Cycling is firmly ingrained in Maltese cultural heritage {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}. As you would expect in an island whose official religion is [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] and where an estimated 95 percent profess to belong to this religion,&lt;ref&gt;[2] US Department of State, http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90188.htm - Retrieved 4 Feb 2011&lt;/ref&gt; cycling also features prominently in religious celebrations.

Most notably, the village feast of [[Zabbar]], which is held annually on the first Sunday after the 8 September, features a motorcycle and bicycle pilgrimage each starting from [[Mosta]] and [[Rabat]] respectively. This is because the Zabbar church is dedicated to “Our Lady of Grace” (Madonna tal-Grazzja), who is also the patron of cyclists.&lt;ref&gt;[3] Zabbar Local Council, http://www.freewebs.com/zabbar/ - Retrieved 4 Feb 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cycling conditions in Malta==
The island's small size – Malta's land area is just over {{convert|316|km2|sqmi|sp=us}} &lt;ref&gt;[4] Encyclopedia of Nations, http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/economies/Europe/Malta.html - Retrieved 4 Feb 2011&lt;/ref&gt; – makes its easily accessible by bike.

Indeed, an increasing number of areas in the capital, [[Valletta]], and elsewhere are being pedestrianized, making cycling the ideal means of visiting them. Despite its size, however, Malta’s [[topography]] is quite hilly, and cycling may be quite challenging in some areas.

==Cycle lanes and paths==
In 2006, the Malta Transport Authority introduced [[bicycle lanes]] to promote and encourage more people to use bicycles as a greener alternative to private car use.&lt;ref&gt;[5] European Cyclists Federation, {{cite web |url=http://www.ecf.com/1641_1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110413091509/http://www.ecf.com/1641_1 |archivedate=2011-04-13 |df= }} - Retrieved 4 Feb 2011&lt;/ref&gt; although cyclists do not normally use the lanes due to unsafe surfaces, mainly attributed to poor planning. Although initially motorists did not always respect these lanes, the situation has improved significantly. Cyclists are also allowed to use [[Bus lane|bus lanes]]. However, cycling is not allowed in tunnels.&lt;ref&gt;Govt Malta, Laws of Malta LN 129 of 2004, Pedal and Low Powered Cycles Regulations, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The few cycle lanes tend to end and start abruptly. They rarely follow regular commuting routes and do not seem to be maintained very regularly. [[Sliema]] local council allows slow cycling along its promenade that does not hinder pedestrians, but this does not extend into Bisazza Street, a main shopping precinct, at the end of the promenade.&lt;ref&gt;Wightman. James, (2011), Bicycle Friendly Initiative in Sliema', Times of Malta, 25/05/2011.&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite citing the support of sustainable and non-polluting modes of transport, there is no cohesive and specific national programme aimed at encouraging cycling.&lt;ref&gt;Wightman. James, (2011), 'Bicycle Highway in Memory of Cliff Micallef', Times of Malta, 28/02/2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==On the road conditions==
Conditions for cyclists on the road are improving although cyclists should remain wary as to which routes to use and which to avoid. Cycling on main roads may at times be dangerous. Due to Malta's party scene and poor [[Drink-driving|drunk driving]] record, early morning rides during weekends are particularly dangerous. Children on bikes and users of motorized bicycles are legally required to wear cycling helmets.&lt;ref&gt;Govt Malta, Laws of Malta LN 129 of 2004, Pedal and Low Powered Cycles Regulations, 2004 http://www.justiceservices.gov.mt/DownloadDocument.aspx?app=lom&amp;itemid=9209&lt;/ref&gt;

Road conditions themselves are improving although [[potholes]] and lack of proper surfacing, especially in smaller towns, remain an issue.

==Bicycle parking==
The Malta Transport Authority has installed a number of bicycle parking bays in various spots around the island, particularly, in tourist areas.

While bicycle theft in Malta is not high, the usual precautions of locking the bike should be taken.

==Cycling and Malta’s public transport==
With no trains and no underground, buses are the main means of public transport in Malta. The Maltese Government has privatized the public bus system. It is currently not possible to transport bicycles on public buses. However, it is possible to schedule the transportation of bicycles to any locations in Malta.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

The '''economic history of World War I''' covers the methods used by the [[First World War]] (1914–1918), as well as related postwar issues such as war debts and reparations.  It also covers the economic mobilization of labor, industry and agriculture.  It deals with economic warfare such as the blockade of Germany, and with some issues closely related to the economy, such as military issues of transportation.  For a broader perspective see [[Home front during World War I]].

All of the powers in 1914 expected a short war; none had made any economic preparations for a long war, such as stockpiling food or critical raw materials. The longer the war went on, the more the advantages went to the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]], with their larger, deeper, more versatile economies and better access to global supplies.  As Broadberry and Harrison conclude, once stalemate set in late in 1914:
:The greater Allied capacity for taking risks, absorbing the cost of mistakes, replacing losses, and accumulating overwhelming quantitative superiority should eventually have turned the balance against Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Broadberry and Mark Harrison, eds. ''The Economics of World War I'' (2005) ch 1 [http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/staff/academic/harrison/papers/ww1toronto2.pdf online p 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Allies had much more potential wealth they could spend on the war. One estimate (using 1913 US dollars) is that the Allies spent $147 billion on the war and the [[Central Powers]] only $61 billion. Among the Allies, Britain and its Empire spent $47 billion and the U.S. $27 billion (America joined after the war started) while among the Central Powers, Germany spent $45 billion.&lt;ref&gt;H.E. Fisk, ''The Inter-Allied Debts'' (1924) pp 13 &amp; 325 reprinted in Horst Menderhausen, ''The Economics of War'' (1943 edition), appendix table II&lt;/ref&gt;

Total war demanded total mobilization of all the nation's resources for a common goal. Manpower had to be channeled into the front lines (all the powers except the United States and Britain had large trained reserves designed just for that). Behind the lines labor power had to be redirected away from less necessary activities that were luxuries during a total war. In particular, vast munitions industries had to be built up to provide shells, guns, warships, uniforms, airplanes, and a hundred other weapons both old and new. Agriculture had to provide food for both civilians and for soldiers (some of whom had been farmers and needed to be replaced by women, children and the elderly who now did the work without animal assistance) and for horses to move supplies. Transportation in general was a challenge, especially when Britain and Germany each tried to intercept merchant ships headed for the enemy. Finance was a special challenge. Germany financed the Central Powers. Britain financed the Allies until 1916, when it ran out of money and had to borrow from the United States.  The U.S. took over the financing of the Allies in 1917 with loans that it insisted be repaid after the war. The victorious Allies looked to defeated Germany in 1919 to pay [[World War I reparations|reparations]] that would cover some of their costs. Above all, it was essential to conduct the mobilization in such a way that the short term confidence of the people was maintained, the long-term power of the political establishment was upheld, and the long-term economic health of the nation was preserved.&lt;ref&gt;Gerd Hardach, ''First World War: 1914–1918'' (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Europe==
{{see also|Home front during World War I}}
[[Gross domestic product]] (GDP) increased for three Allies (Britain, Italy, and U.S.), but decreased in France and Russia, in neutral Netherlands, and in the three main Central Powers. The shrinkage in GDP in Austria, Russia, France, and the Ottoman Empire reached 30 to 40%. In Austria, for example, most pigs were slaughtered, so at war's end there was no meat.

The [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] quickly stabilized, with almost no movement of more than a few hundred yards.  The greatest single expenditure on both sides was for artillery shells, the chief weapon in the war. Since the front was highly stable, both sides built elaborate railway networks that brought supplies within a mile or two of the front lines, with horse-drawn wagons used for the final deliveries.  In the ten-month battle at Verdun, the French and Germans fired some 10 million shells in all, weighing 1.4 million tons of steel.&lt;ref&gt;John Horn, ed. ''Companion to World War I'' (2012) pp 58, 218&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allies==
The German counter-blockade with U-Boats was defeated by the convoy system and massive American ship building. Britain paid the war costs of most of its Allies until it ran out of money, then the US took over, funding those Allies and Britain as well.&lt;ref&gt;David Stevenson, ''With Our Backs to the Wall: Victory and Defeat in 1918'' (2011)  pp 350–438&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{Main article|History of the United Kingdom during World War I}}
[[File:Women workers in the New Gun Factory Woolwich WWI IWM Q 27845.jpeg|thumb|Women workers at the Royal Gun Factory, [[Royal Arsenal|Woolwich Arsenal]], London]]
The economy (in terms of GDP) grew about 7% from 1914 to 1918 despite the absence of so many men in the services; by contrast the German economy shrank 27%. The War saw a decline of civilian consumption, with a major reallocation to munitions. The government share of GDP soared from 8% in 1913 to 38% in 1918 (compared to 50% in 1943).&lt;ref&gt;Niall Ferguson, ''The Pity of War'' (1998) p 249&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite fears in 1916 that munitions production was lagging, the output was more than adequate. The annual output of artillery grew from 91 guns in 1914 to 8039 in 1918. Warplanes soared from 200 in 1914 to 3200 in 1918, while the production of machine guns went from 300 to 121,000.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kennedy, '' The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers'' (1987) p 267&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1915, the [[Anglo-French Financial Commission]] agreed a $500 million loan from private American banks. By 1916, Britain was funding most of the Empire's war expenditures, all of Italy's and two thirds of the war costs of France and Russia, plus smaller nations as well. The gold reserves, overseas investments and private credit then ran out forcing Britain to borrow $4 billion from the U.S. Treasury in 1917–18.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Lobell, "The Political Economy of War Mobilization: From Britain's Limited Liability to a Continental Commitment," ''International Politics'' (2006) 43#3 pp 283–304&lt;/ref&gt;  Shipments of American raw materials and food allowed Britain to feed itself and its army while maintaining her productivity.  The financing was generally successful,&lt;ref&gt;M. J. Daunton, "How to Pay for the War: State, Society and Taxation in Britain, 1917–24," ''English Historical Review'' (1996) 111# 443 pp. 882–919 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/577566 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; as the City's strong financial position minimized the damaging effects of inflation, as opposed to much worse conditions in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;T. Balderston, "War finance and inflation in Britain and Germany, 1914–1918," ''Economic History Review'' (1989) 42#2 p p222-244. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2596203 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  Overall consumer consumption declined 18% from 1914 to 1919.&lt;ref&gt;B.R. Mitchell, ''Abstract of British Historical Statistics'' (1962) p 371&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Trade union]]s were encouraged as membership grew from 4.1 million in 1914 to 6.5 million in 1918, peaking at 8.3 million in 1920 before relapsing to 5.4 million in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, ''Abstract of British Historical Statistics'' (1962) p 68&lt;/ref&gt;   Women were available and many entered munitions factories and took other home front jobs vacated by men.&lt;ref&gt;Gail Braybon, ''Women Workers in the First World War: The British Experience'' (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;


====Energy====

Energy was a critical factor for the British war effort.  Most of the energy supplies came from coal mines in Britain, where the issue was labour supply.  Critical however was the flow of oil for ships, lorries and industrial use.  There were no oil wells in Britain so everything was imported. The U.S. pumped two-thirds of the world's oil. In 1917, total British consumption was 827 million barrels, of which 85 percent was supplied by the United States, and 6 percent by Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold F. Williamson]], ''The American Petroleum Industry: the Age of Energy 1899-1959 '' (1963) 2:267&lt;/ref&gt;  The great issue in 1917 was how many tankers would survive the German u-boats. Convoys and the construction of new tankers solved the German threat, while tight government controls guaranteed that all essential needs were covered. An Inter-Allied Petroleum Conference allocated American supplies to Britain, France and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Yergin, ''The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money and Power''  (1991) pp 176-77&lt;/ref&gt;

An oil crisis occurred in Britain due to the 1917 German submarine campaign. Standard Oil of NJ, for example, lost 6 tankers (including the brand new John D. Archbold) between May and September.  The only solution to the crisis lay with increased oil shipment from America. The Allies formed the Inter-Allied Petroleum Conference with USA, Britain, France, and Italy as the members. Standard and Royal Dutch/Shell ran it and made it work. The introduction of convoys as an antidote to the German U-boats and the joint management system by Standard Oil and Royal Dutch/Shell helped to solve the Allies' supply problems. The close working relationship that evolved was in marked contrast to the feud between the government and Standard Oil years earlier. In 1917 and 1918, there was increased domestic demand for oil partly due to the cold winter that created a shortage of coal. Inventories and imported oil from Mexico were used to close the gap. In January 1918, the U.S. Fuel Administrator ordered industrial plants east of Mississippi to close for a week to free up oil for Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ronald W. Ferrier|author2=J. H. Bamberg|title=The History of the British Petroleum Company: Volume 1, The Developing Years, 1901-1932|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aNBQnow_wbYC&amp;pg=PA356|year=1982|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=356|isbn=9780521246477}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuel oil for the Royal Navy was the highest priority. In 1917, the Royal Navy consumed 12,500 tons a month, but had a supply of 30,000 tons a month from the [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]], using their oil wells in Persia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ronald W. Ferrier|author2=J. H. Bamberg|title=The History of the British Petroleum Company: Volume 1, The Developing Years, 1901-1932|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aNBQnow_wbYC&amp;pg=SL1-PA13|year=1982|publisher=Cambridge UP|pages=A–13|isbn=9780521246477}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scotland====

Clydeside shipyards before 1914 had been the busiest in the world, turning out more than a third of the entire British output. They expanded by a third during the war, primarily to produce transports of the sort that German U-boats were busy sinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Adrian Gregory|title=The Last Great War: British Society and the First World War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bq-AMQAACAAJ|year= 2008|isbn=9780521728836}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Confident of postwar expansion, the companies borrowed heavily to expand their facilities. But after the war, employment tumbled as the yards proved too big, too expensive, and too inefficient; in any case world demand was down. The most skilled craftsmen were especially hard hit, because there were few alternative uses for their specialized skills.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis Johnman and Hugh Murphy, "An Overview of the Economic and Social Effects of the Interwar Depression on Clydeside Shipbuilding Communities," ''International Journal of Maritime History'', (2006), 18#1 pp 227–254&lt;/ref&gt;
====Ireland====
{{Main|Ireland and World War I}}
Ireland was on the verge of civil war in 1914 after Parliament voted a home rule law that was intensely opposed by the Protestants, especially those in Ulster. When the war broke out the law was suspended and Protestants gave very strong support for the war in terms of military service and industrial output.&lt;ref&gt;[[G. R. Searle]], ''A New England?: Peace and War 1886-1918'' (New Oxford History of England, 2005), pp 424-34, 753-54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.J. Lee, ''Ireland, 1912-1985: Politics and Society'' (1990) pp. 1-43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Occurring during [[Irish revolutionary period|Ireland's Revolutionary period]], the Irish Catholic experience of the war was complex and its memory of it divisive. At the outbreak of the war, most Irish people, regardless of political affiliation, supported the war in much the same way as their British counterparts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pennell|first=Catriona|title=A Kingdom United: Popular Responses to the Outbreak of the First World War in Britain and Ireland|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0199590582}}&lt;/ref&gt; and both [[Irish nationalism|nationalist]] and [[unionism in Ireland|unionist]] leaders initially backed the British war effort. Their followers, both Catholic and Protestant, served extensively in the British forces, many in three specially raised divisions.  Over 200,000 Irishmen fought in the war, in several theatres with 30,000 deaths.  In 1916, Catholic supporters of Irish independence from the United Kingdom took the opportunity of the ongoing war to [[Proclamation of the Irish Republic|proclaim an Irish Republic]] and to defend it in [[Easter Rising|an armed rebellion against British rule]] in Dublin. The rebellion was poorly planned and quickly suppressed. The British executed most of the prisoners which caused Catholic opinion to surge in favour of independence.  Britain's intention to [[Conscription Crisis of 1918|impose conscription in Ireland in 1918 provoked widespread resistance]] and as a result remained unimplemented.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Jeffery, ''Ireland and the Great War'' (2011). &lt;/ref&gt;

====Commonwealth and British Empire====
The Commonwealth nations and India all played major roles. The Asian and African colonies provided large numbers of civilian workers, as well as some soldiers.  The [[Indian Army during World War I]]  contributed a large number of divisions and independent brigades to the European, Mediterranean and the Middle East theatres of war. Over one million Indian troops served overseas, of whom 62,000 died and another 67,000 were wounded.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Sumner, ''The Indian Army 1914–1947'' (Osprey, 2001).  &lt;/ref&gt;

=====Canada=====
{{Further| Conscription Crisis of 1917|Canadian women in the World Wars}}
Canada was prosperous during the war but ethnic conflict escalated almost out of control. In terms of long-run economic trends, the war hardly affected the direction or the speed of change.  The trajectory of the main economic factors, the business and financial system, and the technology continued on their way.  Women temporarily took war jobs, and at the end of the war there was [[Canadian Labour Revolt|a great deal of unrest]] among union members and farmers for a few years.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas McCalla, "The Economic Impact of the Great War," in ''Canada and the First World War,'' edited by David MacKenzie (2005): 138–153, esp. p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Australia=====

[[File:Australian Honour Flag.svg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Australian Honour Flag]], awarded to subscribers of the Australian Government's 7th War Loan in 1918]]
[[Billy Hughes]], prime minister from October 1915, expanded the government's role in the economy, while dealing with intense debates over the issue of conscription.&lt;ref&gt;Kosmas Tsokhas, "The Forgotten Economy and Australia's Involvement in the Great War," ''Diplomacy &amp; Statecraft'' (1993) 4#2 331-357&lt;/ref&gt;  Historian Gerhard Fisher argues that the Hughes government aggressively promoted economic, industrial, and social modernization. However, Fischer also says it was done by means of exclusion and repression. He says the war turned a peaceful nation into "one that was violent, aggressive, angst- and conflict-ridden, torn apart by invisible front lines of sectarian division, ethnic conflict and socio-economic and political upheaval."&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Fischer, "'Negative integration' and an Australian road to modernity: Interpreting the Australian homefront experience in World War I," ''Australian Historical Studies,'' (April 1995) 26#104 pp 452-76&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914 the Australian economy was small but the population of five million was very nearly the most prosperous in the world per capita. The nation depended on the export of wool, mutton, wheat and minerals.  London provided assurances that it would underwrite the war risk insurance for shipping in order to allow trade amongst the Commonwealth to continue in the face of the German u-boat threat. London imposed controls so that no exports would wind up in German hands. The British government protected prices by buying Australian products even though the shortage of shipping meant that there was no chance that they would ever receive them. On the whole Australian commerce expanded.&lt;ref&gt;Thorough coverage is in Ernest Scott, ''Australia During the War'' (1941) pp 480-738; see pp 516-18, 539.&lt;/ref&gt;  In terms of value, Australian exports rose almost 45 per cent, while the number of Australians employed in the manufacturing industry increased over 11 per cent. Iron mining and steel manufacture grew enormously.&lt;ref&gt;Russel Ward, ''A nation for a continent: The history of Australia, 1901-1975''  (1977) p 110&lt;/ref&gt;  Inflation became a factor as consumer prices went up, while the cost of exports was deliberately kept lower than market value in an effort to prevent further inflationary pressures worldwide. As a result, the cost of living for many average Australians was increased.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, ''Australia During the War'' (1941) pp. 549, 563&lt;/ref&gt;

The trade union movement, already powerful grew rapidly, though the movement split on the political question of conscription. Despite the considerable rises in the costs of many basic items, the government sought to stabilize wages, much to the anger of unionists. the average weekly wage during the war was increased by between 8–12 per cent, it was not enough to keep up with inflation and as a result there was considerable discontent amongst workers, to the extent that industrial action followed. Not all of these disputes were due to economic factors, and indeed in some part they were the result of violent opposition to the issue of conscription, which many trade unionists were opposed to.&lt;ref name=Scott663&gt;Scott 1941, p. 663.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the result was very disruptive and it has been estimated that between 1914 and 1918 there were 1,945 industrial disputes, resulting in 8,533,061 working days lost and £4,785,607 in lost wages.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, ''Australia During the War'' (1941) pp. 663-65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Russel Ward, ''A nation for a continent: The history of Australia, 1901-1975''  (1977) p 110-11&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost of the war was £377 million, of which 70% was borrowed and the rest came from taxes.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, ''Australia During the War'' (1941) p. 495&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the war had a significantly negative impact on the Australia economy. Real aggregate [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP) declined by 9.5 percent over the period 1914 to 1920, while the mobilization of personnel resulted in a 6 percent decline in civilian employment. Meanwhile, although population growth continued during the war years, it was only half that of the prewar rate. Per capita incomes also declined sharply, failing by 16 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Ian W. McLean, ''Why Australia Prospered: The Shifting Sources of Economic Growth'' (2013), pp. 147–148.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====South Africa=====
South Africa's main economic role was in the supply of two-thirds of the gold production in the British Empire (most of the remainder came from Australia).  When the war began Bank of England officials worked with the government of South Africa to block any gold shipments to Germany, and force the mine owners to sell only to the Treasury, at prices set by the Treasury.  This facilitated purchases of munitions and food in the U.S, and other neutrals. By 1919 London lost control to the mining companies (which were now backed by the South African government). They wanted the higher prices and sales to New York that a free market would provide.&lt;ref&gt;Russell Ally, "War and gold--the Bank of England, the London gold market and South Africa's gold, 1914-19," ''Journal of Southern African Studies'' (1991) 17#2 pp 221-38 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2637235 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belgium===
[[File:Dinant-ruins-ww1.jpg|thumb|Destroyed houses in [[Dinant]], 1915. Belgium sustained significant material damage, providing a major obstacle to its economic recovery after the war.]]
{{main article|Belgium in World War I|Rape of Belgium}}
The Germans invaded [[Belgium]] at the start of the war and Belgium remained occupied for the entire war. There was both large-scale spontaneous militant and passive resistance. Over a 1.4 million refugees fled to France or to neutral Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;E.H. Kossmann. ''The Low Countries'' (1978), p 523-35&lt;/ref&gt;  Over half the German regiments in Belgium were involved in major incidents.&lt;ref&gt;John Horne and Alan Kramer, ''German Atrocities, 1914: A History of Denial'' (Yale U.P. 2001) ch 1-2, esp. p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;  After the atrocities by the German army in the first few weeks of the war, German civil servants took control and were generally correct, albeit strict and severe. Belgium was heavily industrialized; while farms operated and small shops stayed open some large establishments shut down or drastically reduced their output. The faculty closed the universities; many publishers shut down their newspapers. Most Belgians "turned the four war years into a long and extremely dull vacation," according to Kossmann.&lt;ref&gt;Kossmann, p 525&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1916 Germany deported 120,000 men to work in Germany; this led to protests from neutral countries and they were returned. Germany then stripped some factories of useful machinery, and used the rest as scrap iron for its steel mills.&lt;ref&gt;Kossmann, p 533&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of war, silver 5 franc coins were collected and melted down by the [[National Bank of Belgium|National Bank]] to augment its silver reserves.&lt;ref name=NBB1/&gt; They were exchangeable for paper banknotes, and later [[zinc]] coins, although many demonetized silver coins were hoarded.&lt;ref name=NBB1&gt;{{cite web|title=Centenary of the Great War: the National Bank in wartime|publisher=National Bank of Belgium museum|url=http://www.nbbmuseum.be/2013/11/wartime.htm|accessdate=23 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the German invasion, the National Bank's reserves were transferred to Antwerp and eventually to England where they were deposited at the [[Bank of England]].&lt;ref name=NBB1/&gt; Throughout the German occupation there was a shortage of official coins and banknotes in circulation, and so around 600 ''[[Municipality|communes]]'', local governments and companies issued their own unofficial "Necessity Money" to enable the continued functioning of the local economies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Billets de nécessité belges de la Première Guerre mondiale|url=http://www.nbbmuseum.be/fr/catalogue/necessity-money|publisher=National Bank of Belgium Museum|accessdate=23 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Belgian franc]] was fixed at an exchange rate of 1 franc to 1.25 [[German Papiermark|German mark]], which was also introduced as legal tender.&lt;ref name=NBB1/&gt;

Neutral countries led by the United States set up the Commission for Relief in Belgium, headed by American engineer [[Herbert Hoover]]. It shipped in large quantities of food and medical supplies, which it tried to reserve for civilians and keep out of the hands of the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Johan den Hertog, "The Commission for Relief in Belgium and the Political Diplomatic History of the First World War," ''Diplomacy and Statecraft,'' (Dec 2010) 21#4 pp 593-613,&lt;/ref&gt;  Many businesses collaborated with the Germans. The government set up judicial proceedings to punish the collaborators.&lt;ref&gt;Laurence van Ypersele and Xavier Rousseaux, "Leaving the War: Popular Violence and Judicial Repression of 'unpatriotic' behaviour in Belgium (1918–1921)," ''European Review of History'' (Spring 2005) 12#3 pp 3-22&lt;/ref&gt;

====Belgian Congo====
Rubber had long been the main export of the [[Belgian Congo]] and production levels held up during the war but its importance fell from 77% of exports (by value) to only 15%. New resources were opened, especially copper mining in [[Katanga Province]]. The [[Union Minière du Haut Katanga]] company dominated the copper industry, exporting its product along a direct rail line to the sea at [[Beira, Mozambique|Beira]].  The war caused a heavy demand for copper, and production soared from 997 tons in 1911 to 27,000 tons in 1917, then fell off to 19,000 tons in 1920. Smelters operate at [[Lubumbashi|Elisabethville]]. Before the war the copper was sold to Germany and, in order to prevent loss of capacity, the British purchased all the Congo's wartime output with the revenues going to the [[De Broqueville government in exile|Belgian government in exile]]. Diamond and gold mining also expanded during the war. The Anglo-Dutch firm [[Unilever|Lever Bros.]] greatly expanded the palm oil business during the war and there was an increased output of cocoa, rice and cotton. New rail and steamship lines opened to handle the expanded export traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1922 |wstitle=Belgian Congo |volume=30 |page=429 |first=Frank Richardson |last=Cana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German invasion captured 40% of France's heavy industry in 1914, especially in steel and coal. French GDP in 1918 was 24% smaller than in 1913; since a third went into the war effort, the civilian standard of living fell by half. But thousands of little factories opened up across France, hiring women, youth, elderly, disabled veterans, and behind the lines soldiers. Algerian and Vietnamese laborers were brought in. Plants produced 200,000 75mm shells a day. The US provided much food, steel, coal and machine tools, and $3.6 billion in loans to finance it all; the British loaned another $3 billion.&lt;ref&gt;* Philippe Bernard, and Henri Dubief. ''The Decline of the Third Republic, 1914–1938,'' (1985) pp 21–101&lt;/ref&gt;

Considerable relief came with the influx of American food, money and raw materials in 1917. The economy was supported after 1917 by American government loans which were used to purchase foods and manufactured goods. The arrival of over a million American soldiers in 1918 brought heavy spending for food and construction materials. 

France's diverse regions suffered in different ways. While the occupied area in 1913 contained only 14% of France's industrial workers, it produced 58% of the steel, and 40% of the coal.&lt;ref&gt;Gerd Hardach, ''The First World War: 1914–1918'' (1977) pp 87–88&lt;/ref&gt; War contracts made some firms prosperous but on the whole did not compensate for the loss of foreign markets. There was a permanent loss of population caused by battle deaths and emigration.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Koerner, "L'economie du Massif central durant la premiere guerre mondiale," ''Revue Historique'' (1987) 277#1 pp 67–81 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40954476 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

The economy of Algeria was severely disrupted. Internal lines of communication and transportation were disrupted, and shipments of the main export, cheap wine, had to be cut back. Crime soared as French forces were transferred to the Western Front, and there was rioting in the province of Batna. Shortages mounted, inflation soared, banks cut off credit, and the provincial government was ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;G. Meynier, "L'economie de l'est Algerien pendant la guerre de 1914–1918," ''Revue Historique'' (1972) 247#1 pp 81–116. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40951780 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Finance ====
The French government floated four war bond issues on the London market and raised 55 million pounds. These bonds were denominated in francs instead of pounds or gold, and were not guaranteed against exchange rate fluctuations. After the war the franc lost value and British bondholders tried, and failed, to get restitution.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Turner, "British Holdings Of French War Bonds: An Aspect of Anglo-French Relations during the 1920s", ''Financial History Review'' (1996) 3#2 pp. 153–174&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.]]  of New York was the major American financier for the Allies, and worked closely with French bankers.  However its dealings became strained because of growing misunderstandings between the Wall Street bankers and French bankers and diplomats.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Horn, "A Private Bank at War: J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. and France, 1914–1918", ''Business History Review'' (2000) 74#1 pp. 85–112&lt;/ref&gt;

====French colonies====
French colonies supplied workers for munitions factories and other jobs in France.  A famous example was [[Ho Chi Minh]] who worked in Paris, and was highly active in organizing fellow Vietnamese, and even demanding a voice for them at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. The French army enlisted hundreds of thousands of colonials. From Africa came 212,000 soldiers, of whom 160,000 fought on the Western front.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Spencer Tucker, ed.|title=World War I: Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2YqjfHLyyj8C&amp;pg=PA554|year=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|pages=435–37, 554|isbn=9781851094202}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Richard Fogarty, ''Race and War in France: Colonial Subjects in the French Army, 1914–1918'' (2008); Myron Echenberg, ''Colonial Conscripts: The Tirailleurs Sénégalais in French West Africa, 1857–1960'' (1991). &lt;/ref&gt;

The rapid unplanned buildup of French military operations in Africa disrupted normal trade relations and all the colonies, especially disrupting food supplies for the cities and distorting the local labor markets. French administrators, focused on supporting the armies on the Western Front, disregarded or suppressed protest movements.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Rich, "Hunger and Consumer Protest in Colonial Africa during the First World War," ''Food, Culture &amp; Society'' 10.2 (2007): 239-259. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
{{Further|History of Russia (1892–1917)}}
The Russian economy was far too backward to sustain a major war, and conditions deteriorated rapidly, despite financial aid from Britain.  By late 1915 there was a severe shortage of artillery shells. The very large but poorly equipped Russian army fought tenaciously and desperately despite its poor organisation and lack of munitions. Casualties were enormous. By 1915, many soldiers were sent to the front unarmed, and told to pick up whatever weapons they could from the battlefield.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gatrell, "Poor Russia, Poor Show: Mobilising a Backward Economy for War, 1913–1917" in Stephen Broadberry and Mark Harrison, eds., ''The Economics of World War I'' pp (2005) 235–275.&lt;/ref&gt;

The onset of World War I exposed the poor administrative skills of the czarist government under [[Nicholas II]]. A show of national unity had accompanied Russia's entrance into the war, with defense of the Slavic Serbs the main battle cry. In the summer of 1914, the Duma and the zemstva expressed full support for the government's war effort. The initial conscription was well organized and peaceful, and the early phase of Russia's military buildup showed that the empire had learned lessons from the Russo-Japanese War. But military reversals and the government's incompetence soon soured much of the population. Enemy control of the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea severed Russia from most of its foreign supplies and markets.  

Russia had not prepared for a major war and Reacted very slowly as problems mounted in 1914-16.  Inflation became a serious problem. Because of inadequate material support for military operations, the [[War Industry Committees]] were formed to ensure that necessary supplies reached the front. But army officers quarreled with civilian leaders, seized administrative control of front areas, and refused to cooperate with the committee. The central government distrusted the independent war support activities that were organized by zemstva and cities. The Duma quarreled with the war bureaucracy of the government, and center and center-left deputies eventually formed the Progressive Bloc to create a genuinely constitutional government.  While the central government was hampered by court intrigue, the strain of the war began to cause popular unrest. Food shortages increasingly impacted urban areas, caused by military purchases,  transportation bottlenecks, financial confusion, and administrative mismanagement.  &lt;ref&gt; Mikhail D. Karpachev, "The Provisioning Crisis during the First World War,"  ''Russian Studies in History'' 55#3-4 (2016): 209-233.&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1915  high food prices and fuel shortages caused strikes in some cities.  Food riots became more common and more violent, and ready the angry populace for withering political attacks on the czarist regime.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Alpern Engel, "Not by bread alone: subsistence riots in Russia during World War I." ''Journal of Modern History'' 69.4 (1997): 696-721. [https://libcom.org/files/Women's%20Riots%20in%20Russia%20in%20WW1.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt; Workers, who had won the right to representation in sections of the War Industries Committee, used those sections to mobilize political opposition. The countryside also was becoming restive. Soldiers were increasingly insubordinate, particularly the newly recruited peasants who faced the prospect of being used as cannon fodder in the inept conduct of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gatrell, ''Russia's First World War: A Social and Economic History'' (2005) [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=GXgABAAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=+The+Provisioning+Crisis+during+the+First+World+War.&amp;ots=p4-xQXgDN8&amp;sig=vtQnDhQp2Gk7RHTph6AejadipLI#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  excerpt]&lt;/ref&gt;

The bad situation continued to deteriorate. Increasing conflict between the tsar and the Duma destroyed popular and elite support for the old regime. In early 1917, deteriorating rail transport caused acute food and fuel shortages, which resulted in escalating riots and strikes. Authorities summoned troops to quell the disorders in Petrograd (as St. Petersburg had been called since September 1914, to Russianize the Germanic name). In 1905 troops had fired on demonstrators and saved the monarchy, but in 1917 the troops turned their guns over to the angry crowds. Public support for the tsarist regime simply evaporated in 1917, ending three centuries of Romanov rule.&lt;ref&gt;W. Bruce Lincoln, ''Passage through Armageddon: The Russians in War and Revolution 1914–1918'' (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
{{see also|History of Italy#First World War|Italy in World War I}}
Italy joined the Allies in 1915, but was poorly prepared for war.  Loans from Britain paid for nearly all its war expenses. The Italian army of 875,000 men was poorly led and lacked heavy artillery and machine guns. The industrial base was too small to provide adequate amounts of modern equipment, and the old-fashioned rural base did not produce much of a food surplus.&lt;ref&gt;Francesco Galassi and Mark Harrison, "Italy at war, 1915–1918," in Broadberry and Harrison, eds. ''The Economics of World War I'' (2005) ch. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the war the government had ignored labor issues, but now it had to intervene to mobilize war production. With the main working-class Socialist party reluctant to support the war effort, strikes were frequent and cooperation was minimal, especially in the Socialist strongholds of [[Piedmont]] and [[Lombardy]]. The government imposed high wage scales, as well as collective bargaining and insurance schemes.&lt;ref&gt;Luigi Tomassini, "Industrial Mobilization and the labour market in Italy during the First World War," ''Social History,'' (Jan 1991), 16#1 pp 59–87&lt;/ref&gt;   Many large firms expanded dramatically. The workforce at the Ansaldo munitions company grew from 6,000 to 110,000 as it manufactured 10,900 artillery pieces, 3,800 warplanes, 95 warships and 10 million artillery shells. At [[Fiat]] the workforce grew from 4,000 to 40,000.  Inflation doubled the cost of living. Industrial wages kept pace but not wages for farm workers. Discontent was high in rural areas since so many men were taken for service, industrial jobs were unavailable, wages grew slowly and inflation was just as bad.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, ''European Powers in the First World War,'' p 375-76&lt;/ref&gt;

====Economic confusion in 1917====
[[File:Liberty bound poster.jpg|thumb|Poster to promote the sale of Liberty Bonds, c. 1917–18; contributed coins will cut the ropes binding [[Columbia (name)|Columbia]] to the stake.]]
In terms of munitions production, the 15 months after April 1917 involved an amazing parade of mistakes, misguided enthusiasm, and confusion. Americans were willing enough, but they did not know their proper role.  Wilson was unable to figure out what to do when, or even to decide who was in charge.  Typical of the confusion was the coal shortage that hit in December 1917. Because coal was by far the most major source of energy and heat, a grave crisis ensued.  There was in fact plenty of coal being mined, but 44,000 loaded freight and coal cars were tied up in horrendous traffic jams in the rail yards of the East Coast. Two hundred ships were waiting in New York harbor for cargo that was delayed by the mess.  The solution included nationalizing the coal mines and the railroads for the duration, shutting down factories one day a week to save fuel, and enforcing a strict system of priorities. Only in March 1918 did Wilson finally take control of the crisis&lt;ref&gt;David Kennedy, ''Over Here'' 113-25&lt;/ref&gt;

====Women====
The war saw many women gaining access to and taking on jobs traditionally assigned to men. Many worked on the [[assembly line]]s of factories, producing trucks and munitions. The morale of the women remained high, as millions join the Red Cross as volunteers to help soldiers and their families.  With rare exceptions, the women did not protest the draft.&lt;ref&gt;Lettie Gavin, ''American Women in World War I: They Also Served'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time, department stores employed African American women as elevator operators and cafeteria waitresses.

====Labour====
[[Samuel Gompers]], head of the AFL, and nearly all labor unions were strong supporters of the war effort. They minimized strikes as wages soared and full employment was reached. The AFL unions strongly encouraged their young men to enlist in the military, and fiercely opposed efforts to reduce recruiting and slow war production by the anti-war labor union called the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW) and also left-wing Socialists. President Wilson appointed Gompers to the powerful [[Council of National Defense]], where he set up the War Committee on Labor. The AFL membership soared to 2.4 million in 1917.  In 1919, the Union tried to make their gains permanent and called a series of major strikes in meat, steel and other industries. The strikes, all of which failed, forced unions back to their position around 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Taft, ''The A.F.L. in the time of Gompers'' (1957)&lt;/ref&gt;

While Germany rapidly mobilized its soldiers, it had to improvise the mobilization of the civilian economy for the war effort. It was severely handicapped by the British blockade that cut off food supplies, machinery and raw materials.

[[Walter Rathenau]] played the key role in convincing the War Ministry to set up the War Raw Materials Department (Kriegsrohstoffabteilung—"KRA"); he was in charge of it from August 1914 to March 1915 and established the basic policies and procedures.  His senior staff were on loan from industry. KRA focused on raw materials threatened by the [[Blockade of Germany|British blockade]], as well as supplies from occupied Belgium and France. It set prices and regulated the distribution to vital war industries. It began the development of ersatz raw materials. KRA suffered many inefficiencies caused by the complexity and selfishness KRA encountered from commerce, industry, and the government.&lt;ref&gt;D. G. Williamson, "Walther Rathenau and the K.R.A. August 1914–March 1915", ''Zeitschrift für Unternehmensgeschichte'' (1978)  Issue 11, pp 118–136.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hew Strachan, ''The First World War: Volume I: To Arms'' (2001) pp. 1014–49 on Rathenau and KRA&lt;/ref&gt;  Some two dozen additional agencies were created dealing with specific products; the agencies could confiscate supplies and redirect them to the munitions factories.  Cartels were created and small firms merged into larger ones for greater efficiency and ease of central control.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald D. Feldman, "The Political and Social Foundations of Germany's Economic Mobilization, 1914–1916", ''Armed Forces &amp; Society'' (1976) 3#1 pp. 121–145. [http://afs.sagepub.com/content/3/1/121 Online].&lt;/ref&gt;

The military took an increasingly dominant role in setting economic priorities and in direct control of vital industries. It was usually inefficient, but it performed very well in aircraft.  The army set prices and wages, gave out draft exemptions, guaranteed the supply of credit and raw materials, limited patent rights, and supervised management–labor relationships. The industry expanded very rapidly with high quality products and many innovations, and paid wages well above the norm for skilled workers.&lt;ref&gt;John H. Morrow Jr., "Industrial Mobilization in World War I: The Prussian Army and the Aircraft Industry", ''Journal of Economic History'', (1977) 37#1 pp. 36–51 {{jstor|2119443}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Total spending by the national government reached 170 billion marks during the war, of which taxes covered only 8%, and the rest was borrowed from German banks and private citizens. Eight national war loans reached out to the entire population and raised 100 million marks. It proved almost impossible to borrow money from outside.  The national debt rose from only 5 billion marks in 1914 to 156 billion in 1918.  These bonds became worthless in 1923 because of hyperinflation.&lt;ref&gt;T. Balderston, "War finance and inflation in Britain and Germany, 1914–1918", ''Economic History Review'' (1989) 42#3 pp. 222–244&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fred Rogers Fairchild, ''German War Finance'' (1922)&lt;/ref&gt;

As the war went on conditions deteriorated rapidly on the home front, with severe food shortages reported in all urban areas by 1915. Causes involved the transfer of many farmers and food workers into the military, an overburdened railroad system, shortages of coal, and the British blockade that cut off imports from abroad. The winter of 1916–1917 was known as the "turnip winter", because that vegetable, usually fed to livestock, was used by people as a substitute for potatoes and meat, which were increasingly scarce. Thousands of soup kitchens were opened to feed the hungry people, who grumbled that the farmers were keeping the food for themselves. Even the army had to cut the rations for soldiers.  Morale of both civilians and soldiers continued to sink.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Chickering, ''Imperial Germany and the Great War, 1914–1918'' (2004) pp. 141–42&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ernest H. Starling, "The Food Supply of Germany During the War" (1922). ''Journal of the Royal Statistical Society'', vol. 83 no. 2. pp. 225–254.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ottoman Empire ===
In the Ottoman Empire Turkish nationalists took control before the war began.  They drove out Greeks and Armenians who had been the backbone of the business community, replacing them with ethnic Turks who were given favorable contracts but who lacked the international connections, credit sources, and entrepreneurial skills needed for business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Erik J. Zürcher|title=Turkey: A Modern History, Revised Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RInzgxRX5uEC&amp;pg=PA126|year=2004|page=126|isbn=9781860649585}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Ottoman economy was based on subsistence agriculture; there was very little industry. Turkish wheat was in high demand, but transportation was rudimentary and not much of it reached Germany. The war cut off imports except from Germany. Prices quadrupled.  The Germans provided loans and supplied the army with hardware, especially captured Belgian and Russian equipment. Other supplies were in short supply; the soldiers were often in rags.  Medical services were very bad and illness and death rates were high. Most of the Ottoman soldiers deserted when they had the opportunity, so the force level shrank from a peak strength of 800,000 in 1916 to only 100,000 in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Zurcher, ''Turkey: A Modern History'' (2004) pp 122–31&lt;/ref&gt;

===Austria-Hungary===
{{main article|Austria-Hungary#World War I}}

The Austro-Hungarian monarchical [[personal union]] of the two countries was a result of the [[Compromise of 1867]]. Kingdom of Hungary lost its former status after the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]]. However following the 1867 reforms, the Austrian and the Hungarian states became co-equal within the Empire. Austria-Hungary was geographically the second-largest country in Europe after the [[Russian Empire]], at {{convert|621538|km2|sqmi|sp=us|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name=ah1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |last=Holland |first=Arthur William |wstitle=Austria-Hungary|volume=3 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the third-most populous (after Russia and the [[German Empire]]). In comparison with Germany and Britain, the Austro-Hungarian economy lagged behind considerably, as sustained modernization had begun much later in Austria-Hungary. The Empire built up the fourth-largest machine building industry of the world, after the [[United States]], Germany, and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;Schulze, Max-Stephan. ''Engineering and Economic Growth: The Development of Austria-Hungary's Machine-Building Industry in the Late Nineteenth Century'', {{nowrap|p. 295}}. Peter Lang ([[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]]), 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Austria-Hungary was also the world's third largest manufacturer and exporter of electric home appliances, electric industrial appliances and facilities for power plants, after the United States and the German Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Publishers' Association, Booksellers Association of Great Britain and Ireland|title=The Publisher, Volume 133|page=355|year=1930}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Contributors :Austria. Österreichische konsularische Vertretungsbehörden im Ausland, Austrian Information Service, New York|title=Austrian information|page=17|year=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Empire of Austria and the Kingdom of Hungary had always maintained separate parliaments: the [[Imperial Council (Austria)]] and the [[Diet of Hungary]]. Except for the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713]], common laws never existed in the Empire of Austria and the Kingdom of Hungary.

There was no common citizenship: one was either an Austrian citizen or a Hungarian citizen, never both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EvCfTIsTOskC&amp;pg=PA401 |title=Austria-Hungary and the Successor States: A Reference Guide from the Renaissance to the Present |author=Eric Roman |page=401 |publisher=Infobase Publishing |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-8160-7469-3 |accessdate=1 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q48xAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=austria-hungary+%22common+citizenship%22 |title=The New Encyclopædia Britannica |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-85229-961-6 |accessdate=1 January 2013 |publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica, inc }}&lt;/ref&gt; Austria and Hungary were fiscally sovereign and independent entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=European Review of Economic History|journal=European Review of Economic History|date=April 2006|volume=10|issue=1|first=Marc|last=Flandreau|asin=B00440PZZC |id=1361–4916|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=431004|pages=3–33|doi=10.1017/S1361491605001607}}&lt;/ref&gt;The Kingdom of Hungary could preserve its separated and independent budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |last=Briliant |first=Oscar|wstitle=Hungary |volume=13 |page=900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, by the end of the 19th century, economic differences gradually began to even out as economic growth in the eastern parts of the Empire consistently surpassed that in the western. The strong agriculture and [[food industry]] of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] with the centre of [[Budapest]] became predominant within the empire and made up a large proportion of the export to the rest of Europe. Meanwhile, western areas, concentrated mainly around [[Prague]] and Vienna, excelled in various manufacturing industries. This [[division of labour]] between the east and west, besides the existing [[economic and monetary union]], led to an even more rapid economic growth throughout Austria-Hungary by the early 20th century. Austria could preserve its dominance within the empire in the sectors of the [[first industrial revolution]], but Hungary had a better position in the industries of the [[second industrial revolution]], in these modern industrial sectors the Austrian competition could not become overwhelming.&lt;ref&gt;[[Iván T. Berend]]: "''Case Studies on Modern European Economy: Entrepreneurship, Inventions, and Institutions''", Routledge, 2013, page 151 [https://books.google.com/books?id=L_GEE9YDgtYC&amp;pg=PA151&amp;dq=%22Hungary+had+a+better+position+in+the+new+industries+of+the+second+industrial+revolution%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NSU3UozILMqRtQbonIDwCw&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Hungary%20had%20a%20better%20position%20in%20the%20new%20industries%20of%20the%20second%20industrial%20revolution%22&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

The empire's [[heavy industry]] had mostly focused on machine building, especially for the [[electric power industry]], [[History of rail transport|locomotive industry]] and [[automotive industry]], while in [[light industry]] the [[precision mechanics]] industry was the most dominant.

During the war the national governments of Vienna and Budapest set up a highly centralized war economy, resulting in a bureaucratic dictatorship. It drafted skilled workers and engineers without realizing the damage it did to the economy.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, ''The European Powers,'' (1999) pp 85–91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clifford F. Wargelin, "The Economic Collapse of Austro-Hungarian Dualism, 1914–1918," ''East European Quarterly'' (2000) 34#3 pp 261–88, online&lt;/ref&gt;

The Czech region had a more advanced economy, but was reluctant to support the war effort. Czechs rejected any customs union with Germany, because it threatened their language and culture. Czech bankers had an eye to early independence; they purchased many securities from the Czech lands, thus insuring their strong domestic position in what became Czechoslovakia in 1918.

===Bulgaria===
{{main article|Bulgaria during World War I}}
Bulgaria, a poor rural nation of 4.5 million people, at first stayed neutral.  In 1915 it joined the Central Powers.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, ''The European powers in the First World War'' (1996).  pp 149–52&lt;/ref&gt; It mobilized a very large army of 800,000 men, using equipment supplied by Germany. Bulgaria was ill-prepared for a long war; absence of so many soldiers sharply reduced agricultural output. Much of its best food was smuggled out to feed lucrative black markets elsewhere. By 1918 the soldiers were not only short of basic equipment like boots but they were being fed mostly corn bread with a little meat.  The [[Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine|peace treaty in 1919]] stripped Bulgaria of its conquests, reduced its army to 20,000 men, and demanded reparations of £100 million.&lt;ref&gt;Richard C. Hall, "Bulgaria in the First World War," ''Historian,'' (Summer 2011) 73#2 pp 300–315&lt;/ref&gt;

Chile's international trade collapsed and state income was reduced to half of its previous value after the start of the [[World War I]] in 1914.&lt;ref name=villalobos649&gt;[[Sergio Villalobos|Villalobos, Sergio]]; Silva, Osvaldo; Silva, Fernando; Estelle, Patricio (1974).

==Postwar==
{{main article|Paris Peace Conference, 1919}}
Conditions on the Continent were bad for every belligerent.  Britain sustained the lightest damage to its civilian economy, apart from its loss of men.  The major damage was to its merchant marine and to its financial holdings.  The United States and Canada prospered during the war. The reparations levied on Germany by the [[Treaty of Versailles]] were, in theory, supposed to restore the damage to the civilian economies, but little of the reparations money went for that. Most of Germany's reparations payments were funded by loans from American banks, and the recipients used them to pay off loans they had from the U.S. Treasury.  Between 1919 and 1932, Germany paid out 19 billion goldmarks in reparations, and received 27 billion goldmarks in loans from New York bankers and others. These loans were eventually paid back by Germany after World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, ''The Pity of War'' (1998) p 417&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zara S.

Eritel doesn't provide its customers with SMS services to foreign locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/AllDocsByUNID/bfc5ed90ba2c9d6385256a5b0065a425|title=Eritrea: First mobile phone company about to be launched|accessdate=2007-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==EriTel (ISP)==
As an internet operator, EriTel was among the first companies to get a license to operate. To provide its product the firm provides internet cafes, leased lines and dial-up connections. However, connections are typically overcrowded and congestion is an acknowledged problem. EriTel controls the national gateway, which it created in partnership with USAID.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usaid.gov/leland/eriindex.htm |title=Eritrea Country Page |accessdate=2006-10-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019133955/http://www.usaid.gov/leland/eriindex.htm |archivedate=2006-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==EriTel (landline operator)==
EriTel assumed this infrastructure from the Postal and Telecommunications Authority once they were split into separate entities. The infrastructure that is used was laid during the Italian colonial period. It consists primarily of aging copper wire, though in the major urban centers, including Asmara, Massawa, and Keren, upgrades have been made to the switching systems.

The '''Federal Customs Service of Russia''' ({{lang-ru|Федеральная таможенная служба Российской Федерации}}, ''Federalnaya tamozhennaya sluzhba Rossiskoy Federatsii''; abbreviated {{lang|ru| ФТС России}}, ''FTS Rossii'') is a [[Russia]]n government service regulating [[customs]].

Since May 12, 2006, it has been led by [[Andrey Belyaninov]] and under direct authority of the [[Government of Russia]]. Until 2006, the Federal Customs Service of Russia was under the responsibility of the Ministry for Economic Development.

==History==
The [[Customs]] Services in [[Russia]] were formed in 1865, as The Customs Department of the Ministry of Finance.

In 1917 the Soviet Customs Service was operated as The Main Directorate for Customs Control as part of the MKTP - The People's Commissariat for Trade and Industry.

In 1991, The Soviet Customs was replaced with The State Customs Committee (GTK) under the Ministry for Economic Development and in 2006 the GTK was renamed to current name.

'''''Golden Horseshoes''''' ({{lang-ar|صفايح ذهب}}, [[Transliteration|translit.]]&amp;nbsp;Safa'ih min dhahab, {{lang-fr|Les Sabots en or}}) is a 1989 Tunisian [[drama film]] directed by [[Nouri Bouzid]]. It was screened in the [[Un Certain Regard]] section at the [[1989 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/260/year/1989.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Golden Horseshoes |accessdate=2 August 2009|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Youssef Soltane, a 45-year-old Tunisian intellectual, is the product of a generation that lived the era of euphoria and great ideologies in the sixties, and their subsequent failure. He was incarcerated and tortured for his political opinions. Furthermore, his relationship with Zineb, a young, beautiful bourgeois, only brings him more trouble. During one long winter night, Youssef wanders in search of an emotional haven, prey to all the questions that flood his memory.

The '''Graveyard Seamounts''' is the informal name for the Graveyard Knolls&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linz.govt.nz/regulatory/place-names/recent-place-name-decisions-and-place-names-interest/nzgb-decisions-may-2015 New Zealand Geographic Board, May 2015] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216063416/http://www.linz.govt.nz/regulatory/place-names/recent-place-name-decisions-and-place-names-interest/nzgb-decisions-may-2015 |date=2016-02-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These are a series of 28 small [[seamount]]s ([[Submarine volcano|underwater volcano]]es) and edifices located on the [[Chatham Rise]], east of [[New Zealand]]. They cover about {{convert|140|km2|mi2|0|abbr=on}} and stand out from the surrounding oceanic plateau that measures several hundred kilometers. They are named after various morose figures following the naming of the largest of the knolls as "the Graveyard" as it was a graveyard of fishing gear that became stuck on it. The most prominent among the group of knolls are Ghoul, Diabolical, Voodoo, Scroll, Hartless, Pyre, Gothic, Zombie, Mummy, Headstone, Morgue and Graveyard (ordered roughly by increasing size).&lt;ref name="ocea-spot"/&gt;

These features are often referred to as seamounts where a seamount is described as any geographic isolated topographic feature on the seafloor taller than {{convert|100|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, including ones whose summit regions may temporarily emerge above sea level, but not including features that are located on continental shelves or that are part of other major landmasses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Hubert Staudigel, Anthony A.P.

The seamounts are the site of volcanism from the late [[Cenozoic]] era. The knolls are {{convert|100|to|400|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} high, stand {{convert|1050|to|1200|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} deep at their base and {{convert|750|to|1000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} at their summit. Many of the seamounts bear marks of [[tidal scour]] from [[erosion#Water|water erosion]], the result of millions of years of wear by a current moving at {{convert|1|to|2|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} per second.&lt;ref name="ocea-spot"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Malcolm R. Clark, Ashley A. Rowden, Ian Wright, Mirelle Consalvey|title=Spotlight 7: Graveyards Seamounts|journal=[[Oceanography (journal)|Oceanography]]|url=http://www.tos.org/oceanography/issues/issue_archive/issue_pdfs/23_1/23-1_clark1.pdf|accessdate=26 July 2010|publisher=[[Oceanography Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ecology ==
The Graveyard Knolls is a home to over 50 species of fish, dominated by the [[orange roughy]] (''Hoplostethus atlanticus''), [[black oreo]] (''Allocyttus niger''), and [[cardinalfish]] ('''Apogonidae'''). Orange roughy in particular aggregate on the Graveyard Knolls for [[Spawn (biology)|spawning]] and their visits here have supported a commercial fishery since the mid-1990s. A number of the seamounts are also home to extensive [[deep water coral]] forests, made up of ''[[Caryophylliidae|Solenosmilia variabilis]]'' and ''[[Madrepora oculata]]'', both species not known to be of wide extent near New Zealand until camera surveys of Graveyard Knolls in 2001 revealed their extent. These forests offer a home to a diverse invertebrate community that includes [[squat lobster]]s, [[seastar]]s, [[brittlestar]]s, [[polychaete worm]]s, and [[crab]]s. In contrast, the knolls in the group that are affected by [[bottom trawling]] are mostly barren, with few coral and a completely different ecosystem.&lt;ref name="ocea-spot"/&gt;

In 2001, witnessing the damage of bottom trawling to seamount communities, 19 seamounts off the coast of New Zealand were closed off to bottom trawling, three of them from the Graveyard group. Timed surveys of the seamounts over the years are being used to examine how well a seamount coral community recovers from the effects of dredging over time.&lt;ref name="ocea-spot"/&gt;

The region was originally inhabited by the indigenous [[Taíno people]]. Spain landed on the island on 5 December 1492 during the [[Christopher Columbus#First voyage|first voyage]] of [[Christopher Columbus]] across the Atlantic. When Columbus initially landed in Haiti, he had thought he had found [[India]] or [[China]].&lt;ref name="NgCheong-Lum, Roseline 19"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FUSD2v4EQE8C |title=Haiti (Cultures of the World) |author=NgCheong-Lum, Roseline |location=New York |publisher=Times Editions Pte Ltd.|page=19|isbn=0-7614-1968-3|accessdate=29 September 2014|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Christmas|Christmas Day]] 1492, Columbus' flagship the ''[[Santa Maria (ship)|Santa Maria]]'' ran aground north of what is now [[Limonade]].&lt;ref name="Davies1953"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davies|first=Arthur|title=The Loss of the Santa Maria Christmas Day, 1492 |journal=The American Historical Review|year=1953|pages=854–865|doi=10.1086/ahr/58.4.854}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Maclean, Frances| title=The Lost Fort of Columbus| url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/fort-of-columbus-200801.html| work=[[Smithsonian Magazine]]| date=January 2008| accessdate=24 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nilstremmel.com/haiti/f_noframes.htm |title=Haïti histoire – 7 Bord de Mer de Limonade |publisher=Nilstremmel.com |accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/histarch/ebs_intro.htm |title=En Bas Saline|publisher=Florida Museum of Natural History}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, Columbus ordered his men to salvage what they could from the ship, and he created the first European settlement in the Americas, naming it [[La Navidad]] after the day the ship was destroyed.

The island was named ''La Española'' and claimed by [[Spanish Empire|Spain]], which ruled until the early 17th century. Competing claims and settlements by the French led to the western portion of the island being [[Treaty of Ryswick|ceded to France]], which named it ''Saint-Domingue''. [[Sugarcane]] [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|plantation]]s, worked by slaves brought from Africa, were established by colonists.

In the midst of the [[French Revolution]] (1789–99), slaves and [[Gens de couleur|free people of color]] revolted in the [[Haitian Revolution]] (1791–1804), culminating in the abolition of slavery and the defeat of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s army at the [[Battle of Vertières]]. Afterward the [[sovereign state]] of Haiti was established on 1 January 1804—the first independent [[nation-state|nation]] of [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]], the second [[republic]] in the Americas, and the only nation in the world established as a result of a successful [[slave revolt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |jstor=41715319 |title=Anacaona, Golden Flower|author=Danticat, Edwidge |authorlink=Edwidge Danticat |location=New York |publisher=Scholastic Inc. |year=2005 |page=188|isbn=0-439-49906-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=987274 |title=Jefferson and the Nonrecognition of Haiti |journal=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society |volume=140 |issue=1 |author=Matthewson, Tim |publisher=American Philosophical Society |page=22 |issn=0003-049X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rebellion that began in 1791 was led by a former slave and the first black general of the [[French Army]], [[Toussaint Louverture]], whose military genius and political acumen transformed an entire society of [[Slavery|slaves]] into an independent country.

===Pre-Columbian history===
{{Main|Chiefdoms of Hispaniola}}
[[File:Copia de Cacicazgos de la Hispaniola.png|thumb|upright=1.6|The five [[cacique]]doms of Hispaniola at the time of the arrival of Christopher Columbus]]

At the time of European conquest, the island of [[Hispaniola]], of which Haiti occupies the western three-eighths,&lt;ref name="Dardik"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Current Affairs"/&gt; was one of many Caribbean islands inhabited by the [[Taíno people|Taíno]] Native Americans, speakers of an [[Arawakan]] language called Taino, which has been preserved in the Haitian Creole language. The Taíno name for the entire island was ''Haiti''. The people had migrated over centuries into the Caribbean islands from South America. Genetic studies show they were related to the [[Yanomami]] of the [[Amazon Basin]]. They also originated in Central and South America. After migrating to Caribbean islands, in the 15th century, the Taíno were pushed into the northeast Caribbean islands by the [[Island Caribs|Caribs]].&lt;ref name="royal"/&gt;

In the Taíno societies of the Caribbean islands, the largest unit of political organization was led by a ''[[cacique]],'' or chief, as the Europeans understood them. The island of Haiti was divided among five Caciquats: the Magua in the north east, the Marien in the north west, the Xaragua in the south west, the Maguana in the center region of Cibao and the Higuey in the south east.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cassá, Roberto |title=Los Indios de Las Antillas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oJ-wJ49cNwAC&amp;pg=PA126|year=1992|publisher=Editorial Abya Yala|isbn=978-84-7100-375-1|pages=126–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Samuel M.|last=Wilson|year=1990|title=Hispaniola: Caribbean Chiefdoms in the Age of Columbus|publisher=University of Alabama Press|page=110|isbn=0-8173-0462-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The caciquedoms were tributary kingdoms, with payment consisting of harvests.

Taíno cultural artifacts include [[cave paintings]] in several locations in the country. These have become national symbols of Haiti and tourist attractions. Modern-day [[Léogane]] started as a French colonial town in the southwest, is beside the former capital of the caciquedom of ''Xaragua.''&lt;ref name="royal"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.millersville.edu/~columbus/data/ant/ROYAL-01.ANT|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216092556/http://www.millersville.edu/~columbus/data/ant/ROYAL-01.ANT|archivedate= 16 February 2009|title=1492 and Multiculturalism|author=Royal, Robert |journal=The Intercollegiate Review|date=Spring 1992|volume=27|issue=2|pages=3–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nineteen days later, his ship the ''[[Santa María (ship)|Santa María]]'' ran aground near the present site of [[Cap-Haïtien]].

As a gateway to the [[Caribbean]], [[Hispaniola]] became a haven for [[Piracy in the Caribbean|pirates]] during the early colonial period. The western part of the island was settled by French [[buccaneer]]s. Among them was Bertrand d'Ogeron, who succeeded in growing [[tobacco]]. He recruited many French colonial families from [[Martinique]] and [[Guadeloupe]]. European nations were competing for control in the [[New World]], in the [[Caribbean]] as well as in [[North America]]. [[Kingdom of France|France]] and [[Imperial Spain|Spain]] settled their hostilities on the island, by way of the [[Treaty of Ryswick]] of 1697, and divided Hispaniola between them.

===French rule (1625–1804)===
{{Further|Saint-Domingue}}

France received the western third and subsequently named it [[Saint-Domingue]], the French equivalent of ''[[Captaincy General of Santo Domingo|Santo Domingo]]'', the Spanish colony of [[Hispaniola]] and the name of its patron saint, [[Saint Dominic]].&lt;ref name=firstcolony&gt;{{cite web |url=http://countrystudies.us/dominican-republic/3.htm |title=Dominican Republic – The first colony |accessdate= 19 June 2006 |work=Country Studies |publisher=[[Library of Congress]]; [[Federal Research Division]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To develop it into sugarcane plantations, the French imported thousands of slaves from [[Africa]]. Sugar was a lucrative [[commodity crop]] throughout the 18th century. By 1789, approximately 40,000 white colonists lived in Saint-Domingue. In contrast, by 1763 the white population of [[New France|French Canada]], a vast territory, had numbered 65,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/QuebecHistory/encyclopedia/ImmigrationHistoryofCanada.htm |title=Immigration History of Canada |publisher=Faculty.marianopolis.edu |accessdate=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The whites were vastly outnumbered by the tens of thousands of black slaves they had imported to work on their plantations, which were primarily devoted to the production of sugarcane. In the north of the island, slaves were able to retain many ties to African cultures, religion and language; these ties were continually being renewed by newly imported Africans. Blacks outnumbered whites by about ten to one.

The French-enacted ''[[Code Noir]]'' ("Black Code"), prepared by [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] and ratified by [[Louis XIV]], had established rules on slave treatment and permissible freedoms. Saint-Domingue has been described as one of the most brutally efficient slave colonies; one-third of newly imported Africans died within a few years.&lt;ref name="Farmer-LROB"&gt;{{cite web |author= Farmer, Paul | title=Who removed Aristide? |accessdate=19 February 2010 |date=15 April 2004 |url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v26/n08/farm01_.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080608222428/http://www.lrb.co.uk/v26/n08/farm01_.html |archivedate=8 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many slaves died from diseases such as [[smallpox]] and [[typhoid fever]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author = Kiple, Kenneth F. | title = The Caribbean Slave: A Biological History | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=veMLoyrX0BEC| publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2002 | page = 145 | isbn = 0-521-52470-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They had low [[birth rate]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6K-DocgDY6gC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;lpg=PA119&amp;dq=haiti+slaves+low+birth+rates#v=onepage&amp;q=haiti%20slaves%20low%20birth%20rates|title=Sugar Island Slavery in the Age of Enlightenment: The Political Economy of the Caribbean World|authorlink1=Arthur Stinchcombe|last=Stinchcombe|first=Arthur L.|date=1995-12-11|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=1400822009|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is evidence that some women [[abortion|aborted]] fetuses rather than give birth to children within the bonds of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_z17AAAAMAAJ&amp;q=women+aborted+fetuses+rather+than+give+birth+to+children+in+slavery.+haiti&amp;dq=women+aborted+fetuses+rather+than+give+birth+to+children+in+slavery.+haiti|title=Journal of Haitian Studies|last=|first=|date=2001|publisher=Haitian Studies Association|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=67|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in its [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana colony]], the [[New France|French colonial]] government allowed some rights to [[free people of color]]: the [[mixed-race]] descendants of European male colonists and African female slaves (and later, mixed-race women). Over time, many were released from slavery. They established a separate [[social class]]. White French [[Creole peoples|Creole]] fathers frequently sent their mixed-race sons to [[France]] for their education. Some men of color were admitted into the military. More of the free people of color lived in the south of the island, near [[Port-au-Prince]], and many intermarried within their community. They frequently worked as artisans and tradesmen, and began to own some property. Some became slave holders. The [[free people of color]] petitioned the [[New France|colonial]] government to expand their rights.

Inspired by the [[French Revolution]] of 1789 and principles of the [[rights of man]], [[free people of color]] and slaves in [[Saint-Domingue]] and the [[French West Indies]] pressed for freedom and more [[civil rights]]. Most important was the revolution of the slaves in Saint-Domingue, starting in the northern plains in 1791, where Africans greatly outnumbered the whites.

In 1792, the [[French First Republic|French]] government sent three commissioners with troops to re-establish control. To build an alliance with the ''[[gens de couleur]]'' and slaves, the French commissioners [[Sonthonax]] and [[Polverel]] abolished slavery in the colony. Six months later, the [[National Convention]], led by [[Robespierre]] and the [[Jacobin Club|Jacobins]], endorsed [[abolition of slavery timeline|abolition]] and extended it to all the French colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/d/291/ |title=Decree of the National Convention of 4 February 1794, Abolishing Slavery in all the Colonies |publisher=Chnm.gmu.edu |accessdate=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political leaders in the [[United States]], which was a new republic itself, reacted with ambivalence, at times providing aid to enable [[Planter (plantation owner)|planters]] to put down the revolt. Later in the revolution, the US provided support to native Haitian military forces, with the goal of reducing French influence in [[North America]] and the [[Caribbean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1784-1800/HaitianRev |title=1784–1800 – The United States and the Haitian Revolution |publisher=History.state.gov |accessdate=24 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130920081517/http://history.state.gov/milestones/1784-1800/HaitianRev |archivedate=20 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Toussaint Louverture]], a former slave and leader in the slave revolt, drove out the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] (from Santo Domingo) and the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] invaders who threatened the colony.

Struggling to revive the agricultural economy to produce [[commodity crops]], Boyer passed the Code Rural, which denied peasant laborers the right to leave the land, enter the towns, or start farms or shops of their own.

The [[American Colonization Society]] (ACS) encouraged [[free negro|free blacks]] in the [[United States]] to emigrate to Haiti. Starting in September 1824, more than 6,000 [[African Americans]] migrated to Haiti, with transportation paid by the ACS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webster.edu/~corbetre/haiti-archive/msg00868.html |title=Haiti And Its Diaspora: New Historical, Cultural And Economic Frontiers, reprint from '&amp;#39;US Gazette'&amp;#39; Philadelphia, 1824 |author=Firire, Girard Alphonse |publisher=Webster.edu |date=27 August 1999 |accessdate=24 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130910113052/http://www2.webster.edu/~corbetre/haiti-archive/msg00868.html |archivedate=10 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many found the conditions too harsh and returned to the United States.

In July 1825, [[Charles X|King Charles X]] of [[France]], during a period of restoration of the [[French monarchy|monarchy]], sent a [[French Navy|fleet]] to reconquer the island. Under pressure, [[Haiti indemnity controversy|President Boyer agreed to a treaty]] by which France formally recognized the independence of the nation in exchange for a payment of 150 million [[francs]].  By an order of 17 April 1826, the King of France renounced his rights of sovereignty over Santo Domingo, and recognized the independence of Haiti.&lt;ref name="FrenchEmbassy"&gt;{{cite web|title=La première ambassade française en Haïti|url=https://ht.ambafrance.org/La-premiere-ambassade-francaise-en-Haiti|website=Menu Contenu Plan du siteAmbassade de France à Port-au-Prince|publisher=Government of France|accessdate=27 October 2017|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M.

Though the amount of the reparations was reduced to 90 million in 1838. The Haitian president would have had little choice as the country, unknowingly to him, would have been blockaded by French ships if the exchange did not go the French way. In order to repay the full debt, Haiti also borrowed from American and German banks at extremely high interest rates; Haiti did not finish repaying the debt until 1947 and it is said that by 1900, 80 percent of the country's gross domestic product was being spent on debt repayment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/14/haiti-history-earthquake-disaster|title=Haiti: a long descent to hell|last=Henley|first=Jon|date=2010-01-14|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After losing the support of Haiti's elite, Boyer was ousted in 1843.

The enforced payment to France reduced Haiti's economy for years. Western nations did not give Haiti formal [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]] recognition. Both of these problems kept the Haitian economy and society isolated.

===Loss of the Spanish portion of the island===
{{main|Dominican War of Independence}}
[[Charles Rivière-Hérard]] replaced Boyer as president of Haiti. Nationalist forces led by [[Juan Pablo Duarte]] seized control of Santo Domingo on 27 February 1844. Unprofessional and undisciplined Haitian forces in the east, unprepared for a significant uprising, capitulated to the rebels. In March Rivière-Hérard attempted to reimpose his authority, but the [[Dominican Republic|Dominicans]] put up stiff opposition and inflicted heavy losses on the Haitians.&lt;ref name=Bethell/&gt; Soon after Rivière-Hérard crossed the border, domestic turmoil exploded again. Rivière-Hérard was removed from office by the mulatto hierarchy and replaced with the aged black general [[Philippe Guerrier]], who assumed the presidency on 3 May 1844.

Philippe Guerrier died in April 1845, and was succeeded by General [[Jean-Louis Pierrot]]. Pierrot's most pressing duty as the new president was to check the incursions of the Dominicans, who were harassing the Haitian troops along the borders.&lt;ref name=leger&gt;{{cite book|last=Léger|first=Jacques Nicolas|title=Haiti: Her History and Her Detractors|year=1907|publisher=The Neale Publishing Company|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Haiti:_Her_History_and_Her_Detractors|pages=197–98}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dominican gunboats were also making depredations on Haiti's coasts.&lt;ref name=leger/&gt;  President Pierrot decided to open a campaign against the Dominicans, whom he considered merely as insurgents.&lt;ref name=leger/&gt; The Haitian offensive of 1845 was stopped on the frontier.&lt;ref name="Bethell"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bethell|first1=Leslie|title=The Cambridge History of Latin America: Volume 3|date=1984|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=267–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 January 1846 Pierrot announced a fresh campaign to put down the Dominicans, but his officers and men greeted this fresh summons with contempt.&lt;ref name=Bethell/&gt; Thus, a month later – February 1846 – when Pierrot ordered his troops to march against the Dominican Republic, the Haitian army mutinied, and its soldiers proclaimed his overthrow as president of the republic.&lt;ref name=Bethell/&gt; The war against the Dominicans had become very unpopular in Haiti. It was beyond the power of the new president, General [[Jean-Baptiste Riché]], to stage another invasion.&lt;ref name=Bethell/&gt;

===Second Empire (1849–1859)===
{{main|Second Empire of Haiti}}
[[File:Faustin I.jpg|thumb|Faustin I, from ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', 16 February 1856]]
On 27 February 1846, President Riché died after only a few days of power and was replaced by an obscure officer, General [[Faustin Soulouque]]. During the first two years of Soulouque's administration the conspiracies and opposition he faced in retaining power were so manifold that the Dominicans were given a further breathing space in which to continue the re-organization of their country.&lt;ref name=Bethell/&gt; But, when in 1848 France finally recognized the Dominican Republic as a free and independent state and provisionally signed a treaty of peace, friendship, commerce and navigation, Haiti immediately protested, claiming the treaty was an attack upon their own security.&lt;ref name=Bethell/&gt; Soulouque decided to invade the east before the French Government could ratify the treaty.&lt;ref name=Bethell/&gt;

On 21 March 1849, Haitian soldiers attacked the Dominican garrison at [[Las Matas de Farfán|Las Matas]]. The demoralized defenders offered almost no resistance before abandoning their weapons. Soulouque pressed on, capturing [[San Juan Province (Dominican Republic)|San Juan]]. This left only the town of [[Azua, Dominican Republic|Azua]] as the remaining Dominican stronghold between the Haitian army and the capital. On 6 April, Azua fell to 18,000 Haitians and a 5,000-man Dominican counterattack failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scheina|first1=Robert L.|title=Latin America's Wars: Volume 1|date=2003|publisher=Potomac Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; The way to [[Santo Domingo]] was clear. But the news of discontent existing at Port-au-Prince, which reached Soulouque, arrested his further progress and caused him to return with the army to his capital.&lt;ref name=Jacques&gt;{{cite book|last=Léger|first=Jacques Nicolas|title=Haiti: Her History and Her Detractors|year=1907|publisher=The Neale Publishing Company|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Haiti:_Her_History_and_Her_Detractors|pages=202–04}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emboldened by the sudden retreat of the Haitian army, the Dominicans had resumed their depredations. Their flotilla went as far as [[Dame-Marie, Grand'Anse|Dame-Marie]], which they plundered and set on fire.&lt;ref name=Jacques/&gt; Soulouque, now self-proclaimed as Emperor Faustin I, decided to start a new campaign against them. In 1855, he invaded the territory of the Dominican Republic. But owing to insufficient preparation, the army was soon in want of victuals and ammunition.&lt;ref name=Jacques/&gt; In spite of the bravery of the soldiers, the Emperor had once more to give up the idea of restoring unity of government in the island.&lt;ref name=Jacques/&gt; After this campaign, Great Britain and France interfered and obtained an armistice on behalf of the Dominicans.&lt;ref name=Jacques/&gt;

The sufferings endured by the soldiers during the campaign of 1855, the losses and sacrifices inflicted on the country without compensation or practical result provoked great discontent.&lt;ref name=Jacques/&gt; In 1858, a revolution began, led by General [[Fabre Geffrard]], Duke of Tabara. In December of that year, Geffrard defeated the Imperial Army and seized control of most of the country. As a result, the Emperor abdicated his throne on 15 January 1859. Refused aid by the French Legation, Faustin was taken into exile aboard a British warship on 22 January 1859. General Geffrard succeeded him as President.

In 1892, the [[German Empire|German government]] supported suppression of the reform movement of [[Anténor Firmin]], and in 1897, the Germans used [[gunboat diplomacy]] to intimidate and then humiliate the Haitian government during the [[Luders Affair]].

In the first decades of the 20th century, Haiti experienced great political instability and was heavily in debt to France, Germany and the United States. Fearing possible foreign intervention, President Woodrow Wilson sent U.S. Marines into Haiti in December 1914, just after the outbreak of World War I. They removed $500,000 from the Haitian National Bank, but rather than seize it to help pay the debt, it was removed for safe-keeping in New York, thus giving the United States control of the bank and preventing other powers from doing so. This gave a stable financial base on which to build the economy, and so enable the debt to be repaid.&lt;ref&gt;Office of the Historian, U.S. Government. [https://history.state.gov/milestones/1914-1920/haiti U.S. Invasion and Occupation of Haiti, 1915–34]&lt;/ref&gt;

In an expression of the [[Theodore Roosevelt|Theodore]] [[Roosevelt Corollary]] to the [[Monroe Doctrine]], the [[United States occupation of Haiti|United States occupied]] the island in July 1915 after the local assassination of Haiti's president, [[Vilbrun Guillaume Sam]] . The Haitian president had been dragged from the French legation and killed in the street by local insurgents after he had ordered 167 political prisoners killed. The {{USS|Washington|ACR-11|6}}, under Rear Admiral [[William Banks Caperton|Caperton]], arrived in Port-au-Prince in an attempt to restore order and protect U.S. interests. This began a nearly 20-year occupation by U.S. forces. Within days, the Marines had taken control of the capital city and its banks and customs house, which controlled all the finances of the island nation. The Marines declared martial law and severely censored the press. Within weeks, a new pro-U.S. Haitian president, [[Philippe Sudré Dartiguenave]], was installed and a new constitution written that was favorable to the interests of the United States.  The new constitution included a clause that allowed, for the first time, foreign ownership of land in Haiti, which was bitterly opposed by the Haitian legislature and citizenry.

The occupation greatly improved some of Haiti's [[infrastructure]] and centralized power in Port-au-Prince. Infrastructure improvements were particularly impressive: 1700&amp;nbsp;km of roads were made usable, 189 bridges were built, many irrigation canals were rehabilitated, hospitals, schools, and public buildings were constructed, and drinking water was brought to the main cities. Port-au-Prince became the first Caribbean city to have a phone service with automatic dialing. Agricultural education was organized, with a central school of agriculture and 69 farms in the country.{{sfn|Heinl|1996|pp=454–455}} The roads were built using the Hatian's own corvee system that allowed the government/occupying forces to take people from their homes and farms, at gunpoint if necessary, to build roads, bridges, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Danticat, Edwidge (28 July 2015), ''New Yorker Magazine''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Marines were instilled with a special brand of paternalism towards Haitians. Mary Renda writes that "paternalism was an assertion of authority, superiority, and control expressed in the metaphor of a father's relationship with his children."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Renda|first1=Mary|title=Taking Haiti: Military Occupation and the Culture of U.S. Imperialism 1915–1940|date=2001|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill and London|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Senate hearings in 1921, the commandant of the Marine Corps reported that, in the 20 months of active unrest, 2,250 Haitians had been killed. However, in a report to the Secretary of the Navy, he reported the death toll as being 3,250.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schmidt|1971|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haitian historians have claimed the true number was much higher. One went so far as to say, "the total number of battle victims and casualties of repression and consequences of the war might have reached, by the end of the pacification period, four or five times that – somewhere in the neighborhood of 15,000 persons." This is not supported by most historians outside Haiti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Paul |last=Farmer |authorlink=Paul Farmer |title=The Uses of Haiti |publisher=Common Courage Press |year=2003 |page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This chapter in the two nations' histories reflects the interventionist foreign policy of the United States toward its backwards neighbors in Central America and the Caribbean that is often characterized as "[[gunboat diplomacy]]", or one of many "[[Banana Wars]]" that plagued the region in the early 20th century. [[U.S. Marines]] were stationed in the country until 1934, a period of 19 years, and were finally ordered from the island by Franklin D. Roosevelt as a demonstration of his "Good Neighbor Policy". However, the United States controlled the economy of the island and heavily influenced elections in Haiti up through the 1980s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

===Duvalier dynasty (1957–86)===
{{main|Duvalier dynasty}}
[[File:Duvalier crop2.jpg|thumb|upright|"Papa Doc" [[François Duvalier|Duvalier]] in 1968]]
After a period of disorder, in [[Haitian presidential election, 1957|September 1957]] Dr. [[François Duvalier]] was elected President of Haiti. Known as "Papa Doc" and initially popular, Duvalier was President until his death in 1971. He advanced black interests in the public sector, where over time, people of color had predominated as the educated urban elite.&lt;ref name="bryan"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bryan, Patrick E. |title=The Haitian Revolution and Its Effects|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q9owdkOc0wgC|year=1984|publisher=Heinemann|isbn=978-0-435-98301-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stayed in power by enlisting an organization known as ''[[Tonton Macoute|Tontons Macoutes]]'' ("Bogeymen"), which maintained order by terrorizing the populace and political opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/174718/François-Duvalier|title=François Duvalier|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; 40,000 to 60,000 Haitians are estimated to have been killed during the reign of the Duvalier father and son.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/28/AR2011012803142.html 'Baby Doc' Duvalier missed Haiti.

Haiti's brief tourism boom was wiped out by the rule of Papa Doc Duvalier and his unstable government.

Papa Doc's son led the country from 1971 until his ouster in 1986, when protests led him to seek exile in France. Army leader General [[Henri Namphy]] headed a new [[National Council of Government (Haiti)|National Governing Council]].&lt;ref name = "USEH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haiti.org/ |title=US Embassy to Haiti website |publisher=Haiti.org |accessdate=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=July 2013}} [[Haitian presidential election, 1987|General elections in November]] were aborted after dozens of inhabitants were shot in the capital by soldiers and Tontons Macoutes. Fraudulent [[Haitian presidential election, 1988|elections followed]]. The elected President, [[Leslie Manigat]], was overthrown some months later in the [[June 1988 Haitian coup d'état]]. The [[September 1988 Haitian coup d'état]], which followed the [[St. Jean Bosco massacre]], revealed the increasing prominence of former Tontons Macoutes. General [[Prosper Avril]] led a military regime until March 1990.

In December 1990, a former Catholic priest, [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]], was elected President in the [[Haitian general election, 1990–91|Haitian general election]]. In September of the following year, Aristide was overthrown by the military in the [[1991 Haitian coup d'état]].

In September 1994, a U.S. team negotiated the departure of Haiti's military leaders and the peaceful entry of U.S. forces under [[Operation Uphold Democracy]]. This enabled the restoration of the democratically elected Jean-Bertrand Aristide as president.&lt;ref name="CCHaiti"&gt;{{cite web |publisher= The Carter Center |title=Activities by Country: Haiti |url=http://www.cartercenter.org/countries/haiti.html |accessdate=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1994, Aristide returned to Haiti to complete his term in office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Manegol, Catherine S. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/16/world/mission-haiti-scene-for-aristide-s-followers-every-step-dance-every-cheer-song.html |title=For Aristide's Followers, Every Step Is a Dance, Every Cheer a Song |work=The New York Times |date=16 October 1994 |accessdate=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristide vacated the presidency in February 1996.

In November 1994, [[Hurricane Gordon (1994)|Hurricane Gordon]] brushed Haiti, dumping heavy [[rain]] and creating [[flash flood]]ing that triggered mudslides.

In 2004, [[2004 Haitian coup d'état|a revolt began in northern Haiti]].  The rebellion eventually reached the capital, and Aristide was forced into exile, after which the United Nations stationed peacekeepers in Haiti. Some, including Aristide and his bodyguard, Franz Gabriel, stated that he was the victim of a "new [[coup d'état]] or modern kidnapping" by U.S. forces. Mrs. Aristide stated that the kidnappers wore U.S. Special Forces uniforms, but changed into civilian clothes upon boarding the aircraft that was used to remove Aristide from Haiti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/186/34344.html |title=Aristide Kidnapped by US Forces? |publisher=Globalpolicy.org |date=1 March 2004 |accessdate=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2004/3/16/exclusive_aristide_and_his_bodyguard_describe |title=Exclusive: Aristide and His Bodyguard Describe the U.S. Role In His Ouster |publisher=[[Democracy Now!|Democracynow.org]]  |date=16 March 2004 |accessdate=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[United Nations Stabilisation Mission in Haiti|United Nations Stabilisation Mission (MINUSTAH)]] was established after the 2004 coup d'état and remains in the country to the present day.

On 4 October 2016, [[Hurricane Matthew]] made landfall near [[Les Anglais]], making it the worst hurricane to strike the nation since [[Hurricane Cleo]] in 1964. The storm brought deadly winds and rain that left Haiti with a large amount of damage to be repaired. With all of the resources in the country destroyed, Haiti received aid from the United Nations of around US$120 million.  The death total was approximately 3,000. Thousands of people were displaced due to infrastructure damage. Also, the cholera outbreak has been growing since the storm hit Haiti. With additional flooding after the storm, cholera continued to spread beyond the control of officials. The storm also caused damage to hospitals and roads, which created a larger problem in helping victims and moving resources. The devastation and damage that Hurricane Matthew caused were sudden and left Haiti in a state of emergency.

Haiti is on the western part of [[Hispaniola]], the second largest island in the [[Greater Antilles]]. Haiti is the third largest country in the Caribbean behind [[Cuba]] and the [[Dominican Republic]] (the latter shares a {{convert|360|km|mi|0|adj=on}} border with Haiti). Haiti at its closest point is about {{convert|45|nmi|km mi|0}} away from Cuba and comprises the ''horseshoe''-shape peninsula and because of this, it has a disproportionately long coastline and is ''second'' in length ({{convert|1771|km|mi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) behind Cuba in the Greater Antilles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/today/placesinthenews/archive/2010arch/20100114_haiti.html |title=Geography: Haiti |accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/namerica/caribb/haiti/htland.htm |title=Geography: Haiti| accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haiti is the most mountainous nation in the Caribbean and its terrain consists mainly of them interspersed with small coastal plains and river valleys. The climate is tropical, with some variation depending on altitude. The highest point is [[Pic la Selle]], at {{convert|2680|m|ft|0|}}.&lt;ref name="NgCheong-Lum, Roseline 19"/&gt;

The northern region consists of the ''[[Massif du Nord]]'' (Northern Massif) and the ''[[Plaine du Nord]]'' (Northern Plain). The ''Massif du Nord'' is an extension of the ''Cordillera Central'' in the Dominican Republic. It begins at Haiti's eastern border, north of the [[Guayamouc River]], and extends to the northwest through the northern peninsula. The lowlands of the ''Plaine du Nord'' lie along the northern border with the Dominican Republic, between the ''Massif du Nord'' and the North Atlantic Ocean.

The central region consists of two plains and two sets of mountain ranges. The ''Plateau Central'' (Central Plateau) extends along both sides of the Guayamouc River, south of the ''Massif du Nord''. It runs from the southeast to the northwest. To the southwest of the ''Plateau Central'' are the ''[[Montagnes Noires, Haiti|Montagnes Noires]]'', whose most northwestern part merges with the ''Massif du Nord''. Its westernmost point is known as Cap Carcasse.

The southern region consists of the [[Plaine du Cul-de-Sac]] (the southeast) and the mountainous southern peninsula (also known as the [[Tiburon Peninsula, Haiti|Tiburon Peninsula]]). The Plaine du Cul-de-Sac is a natural depression that harbors the country's saline lakes, such as [[Trou Caïman]] and Haiti's largest lake, [[Étang Saumatre]]. The [[Chaîne de la Selle]] mountain range – an extension of the southern mountain chain of the Dominican Republic (the Sierra de Baoruco) – extends from the Massif de la Selle in the east to the [[Massif de la Hotte]] in the west. This mountain range harbors [[Pic la Selle]], the highest point in Haiti at {{convert|2680|m|ft|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elahmad.com/maps/qibla-english.htm?latitude=18.9712&amp;longitude=-72.2845&amp;t=h&amp;zoom=9 |title=Map of Haiti |publisher=Elahmad.com |accessdate=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=July 2013}}

Haiti's most important valley in terms of crops is the Plaine de l'Artibonite, which is oriented south of the Montagnes Noires. This region supports the country's (also Hispaniola's) longest river, the [[Artibonite River|Riviere l'Artibonite]], which begins in the western region of the Dominican Republic and continues most of its length through central Haiti and onward where it empties into the [[Gulf of Gonâve|Golfe de la Gonâve]]. The eastern and central region of the island is a large elevated plateau.

Haiti also includes various offshore islands. The island of [[Tortuga (Haiti)|Tortuga]] (Île de la Tortue) is located off the coast of northern Haiti. The [[Arrondissements of Haiti|arrondissement]] of [[Gonâve Island|La Gonâve]] is located on the island of the same name, in the [[Gulf of Gonâve|Golfe de la Gonâve]]. Gonâve Island is moderately populated by rural villagers. [[Île à Vache]] (Cow Island), a lush island with many beautiful sights, is located off the tip of southwestern Haiti. Also part of Haiti are the [[Cayemites]] and Île d' Anacaona.  [[Navassa Island|La Navasse]] located {{convert|40|nmi|mi km}} west of [[Jérémie]] on the south west [[peninsula]] of Haiti,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/haiti/rock.htm |title=Whose Rock Is It?

===Climate===
Haiti's climate is tropical with some variation depending on altitude. Port-au-Prince ranges in January from an average minimum of {{convert|23|°C|1}} to an average maximum of {{convert|31|°C|1}}; in July, from {{convert|25|–|35|°C|°F}}. The rainfall pattern is varied, with rain heavier in some of the lowlands and the northern and eastern slopes of the mountains. Haiti's dry season occurs from November to January.

Port-au-Prince receives an average annual rainfall of {{convert|1370|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}. There are two rainy seasons, April–June and October–November. Haiti is subject to periodic droughts and floods, made more severe by deforestation. Hurricanes are also a menace. In summary, Haiti is generally a hot and humid tropical climate.

The northern boundary of the fault is where the [[Caribbean plate|Caribbean]] [[tectonic plate]] shifts eastwards by about {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=in}} per year in relation to the [[North American plate]]. The [[strike-slip fault]] system in the region has two branches in Haiti, the [[Septentrional-Oriente fault zone|Septentrional-Oriente fault]] in the north and the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault in the south.

A 2007 earthquake hazard study, noted that the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault zone could be at the end of its seismic cycle and concluded that a worst-case forecast would involve a 7.2&amp;nbsp;M&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; earthquake, similar in size to the [[1692 Jamaica earthquake]].&lt;ref name="DeMets"&gt;{{cite journal|last=DeMets|first=C.|author2=Wiggins-Grandison W.|year=2007|title=Deformation of Jamaica and motion of the Gonâve microplate from GPS and seismic data|journal=[[Geophysical Journal International]]|volume=168|pages=362–378|url=http://www.mona.uwi.edu/earthquake/files/DeformJaGPS2007.pdf |accessdate=19 December 2009|doi=10.1111/j.1365-246X.2006.03236.x|bibcode = 2007GeoJI.168..362D }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study team presented a hazard assessment of the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault system to the 18th Caribbean Geologic Conference in March 2008, noting the large strain.

[[File:Haiti deforestation.jpg|thumb|Haiti's border with the [[Dominican Republic]] in 2002 (left) shows the amount of deforestation on the Haitian side.]]

The [[Erosion|soil erosion]] released from the upper catchments and [[deforestation]] have caused periodic and severe flooding in Haiti, as experienced, for example, on 17 September 2004. Earlier in May that year, floods had killed over 3,000 people on Haiti's southern border with the Dominican Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/weather/hurricane/2004-09-23-haiti-deforest_x.htm |title=Deforestation Exacerbates Haiti Floods |work=USA Today |date=23 September 2004 |accessdate=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haiti's forests covered 60 percent of the country as recently as fifty years ago, but today, according to more in-depth environmental analysis, the country yields approximately 30 percent tree cover, a stark difference from the often cited 2 percent which has been widely circulated in discourse concerning Haiti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.envirosociety.org/2016/05/haiti-is-covered-with-trees/ |title=Haiti Is Covered with Trees |website=EnviroSociety |author=Tarter, Andrew |accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists at the [[The Earth Institute#Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN)Earth Institute|Columbia University's Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN)]]  and the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] are working on the Haiti Regenerative Initiative an initiative aiming to reduce poverty and natural disaster vulnerability in Haiti through ecosystem restoration and sustainable resource management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://haiti.ciesin.columbia.edu/ |title=Haiti GeoPortal at CIESIN |year=2012 |publisher=Columbia University |publication-place=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government and politics==
{{Main|Politics of Haiti}}
{{Further|Foreign relations of Haiti}}

The government of Haiti is a [[semi-presidential system|semi-presidential]] republic, a multiparty system wherein the [[President of Haiti]] is head of state elected directly by popular [[elections in Haiti|elections]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1987 Constitution of the Republic of Haiti|url=http://pdba.georgetown.edu/constitutions/haiti/haiti1987.html|publisher=Georgetown University|accessdate=9 July 2011|location=ARTICLE 134|pages=ARTICLE 134}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Prime Minister acts as head of government and is appointed by the President, chosen from the majority party in the National Assembly. Executive power is exercised by the President and Prime Minister who together constitute the government. In 2013, the annual budget was US$1 billion.&lt;ref name="daniel5"&gt;{{Cite news | first=Trenton | last=Daniel | title=Haiti hopes push to woo tourists pays off | url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/haiti-hopes-160-high-end-tourism-pays-off-19600269| work= | newspaper=[[The Burlington Free Press]] | location=[[Burlington, Vermont]] | pages= 5A | date=8 July 2013 | id= | accessdate=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!---hard and soft copy sources do not match but are identical articles---&gt;

Legislative power is vested in both the government and the two chambers of the [[National Assembly of Haiti]]. The government is organized [[unitary state|unitarily]], thus the central government ''delegates'' powers to the departments without a constitutional need for consent. The current structure of Haiti's political system was set forth in the [[Constitution of Haiti]] on 29 March 1987.

Haitian politics have been contentious: since independence, Haiti has suffered 32 coups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1741707&amp;ps=rs |title=Haiti Starts Over, Once Again |author=Michele Kelemen |publisher=Npr.org |date=2 March 2004 |accessdate=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haiti is the only country in the Western Hemisphere to undergo a successful [[Haitian Revolution|slave revolution]], but a long history of oppression by dictators—including [[François Duvalier]] and his son [[Jean-Claude Duvalier]]—has markedly affected the nation. France, the United States and other Western countries have repeatedly intervened in Haitian politics since the country's founding, sometimes at the request of one party or another. Along with international financial institutions, they have imposed large quantities of debt. Haiti has so much foreign debt that payments have rivaled the available government budget for social sector spending. There have been criticisms of financial institutions for enforcing trade policies on Haiti, which are considered by some to be detrimental to local industry.&lt;ref name="Bell"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bell |first=Beverly |date=2013 |title=Fault Lines: Views across Haiti's Divide |location=Ithaca, NY |publisher=Cornell University Press|pages=30–38 |isbn=978-0-8014-7769-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2006 report by the [[Corruption Perceptions Index]], there is a strong correlation between corruption and poverty in Haiti. The nation ranked first of ''all'' countries surveyed for of levels of perceived domestic corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://transparency.ie/content/2006-corruption-perceptions-index-reinforces-link-between-poverty-and-corruption-and-shows-w |title=2006 Corruption Perceptions Index reinforces link between poverty and corruption |publisher=Transparency International |date=6 November 2006 |accessdate=15 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[International Red Cross]] reports that seven out of ten Haitians live on less than US$2 a day.

This statistic was somewhat disputed in a 2006 article about poverty in the slums of Haiti (written for the Red Cross), wherein ICRC officer Didier Revol wrote, "Such statistical estimations should be looked upon very skeptically because of the fact that the average Haitian and Haitian family has to and does spend a lot more than that daily. The disconnect likely lies in the fact that these are estimates based on surveys conducted by asking individuals what their incomes are; in the Haitian culture it is very unlikely that one will receive a truthful and accurate answer to such a personal question. For various reasons individuals will not tell the truth on such a private matter. For some it is because 'it's none of your business', for others, they will simply exaggerate their poor situation in hopes that some type of financial aide will be gained or rendered to them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.redcross.int/EN/mag/magazine2006_2/10-11.html |title=Hoping for change in Haiti's Cité-Soleil |publisher=International Red Cross |accessdate=16 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The commune of [[Cité Soleil]] in Port-au-Prince has been called "the most dangerous place on Earth" by the United Nations. It is one of the largest [[slum]]s in the Northern Hemisphere.&lt;ref name="Cité Soleil"&gt;{{cite news |last=Fry |first=Ted |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/movies/ghosts-of-cit-soleil-a-harrowing-look-at-haitis-hellish-slums/ |title="Ghosts of Cité Soleil" a harrowing look at Haiti's hellish slums |work=The Seattle Times |date=10 August 2007 |accessdate=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of its residents are supporters of former Haitian President [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Varner |first=Bill |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=az0cdhHzic3M |title=Haitian Gangs Seek Truce That Would Ease Elections |publisher=Bloomberg.com |date=25 August 2005 |accessdate=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; who, according to the BBC, "accused the US of forcing him out – an accusation the US rejected as 'absurd'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Buschschluter |first=Vanessa |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8460185.stm |title=The long history of troubled ties between Haiti and the US |publisher=BBC News |date=16 January 2010 |accessdate=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jean-Bertrand Aristide was initially denied access to Haiti by Haitian immigration authorities, despite issuing appeals for entrance to his supporters and international observers. The world's most prominent governments did not overtly oppose such appeals, nor did they support them; an unnamed analyst "close to the Haitian government" quoted in several media sources{{spaced ndash}} including ''[[The New York Times]]''{{spaced ndash}} is reported to have said: "Aristide could have 15 passports and he's still not going to come back to Haiti&amp;nbsp;[...] France and the United States are standing in the way." However, Aristide finally returned to Haiti on 18 March 2011, days before the 2011 presidential election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/20/world/americas/20haiti.html |work= [[The New York Times]] |author=Ginger Thompson |title=Aristide Says He Is Ready to Follow Duvalier Back to Haiti |date=19 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first round of the [[Haitian general election, 2010|2010 general election]] was held in December. [[Mirlande Manigat]] and [[Jude Célestin|Jude Celestin]] qualified for the second round of the presidential election, but its results were contested. Some people said that the first round was a fraud and that [[Michel Martelly]] should replace Jude Celestin, René Préval's chosen successor. There was some violence between the contending parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/episodes/december-10-2010/haiti-unrest/7663/ |title=Haiti Unrest |publisher=Educational Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=12 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 April 2011, the Provisional Electoral Council announced preliminary results indicating that Martelly had won the presidential election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flcourier.com/2012/05/10/sweet-micky-martelly-reportedly-wins-haiti-election/ |title='Sweet Micky' Martelly reportedly wins Haiti election |author=Charles, Jacqueline |publisher=Flcourier.com |date=10 May 2012 |accessdate=24 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501130703/http://flcourier.com/2012/05/10/sweet-micky-martelly-reportedly-wins-haiti-election/ |archivedate=1 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Haitians as well as observers of the Haitian society believe that this monopolized power could have given way to a corrupt police force.&lt;ref name="Haiti: Police and Law Enforcement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsdrc.org/document-library/haiti-police-and-law-enforcement/|title=Haiti: Police and Law Enforcement|date=2010|accessdate=18 June 2017|publisher=GSDRC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, according to the 2013 [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] ([[UNODC]]) report, murder rates in Haiti (10.2 per 100,000) are far ''below'' the regional average (26 per 100,000); less than {{sfrac|1|4}} that of Jamaica (39.3 per 100,000) and nearly {{sfrac|1|2}} that of the Dominican Republic (22.1 per 100,000), making it among the safer countries in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/press/releases/2014/April/some-437000-people-murdered-worldwide-in-2012-according-to-new-unodc-study.html |title=Some 437,000 people murdered worldwide in 2012, according to new UNODC study |access-date=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/documents/gsh/pdfs/2014_GLOBAL_HOMICIDE_BOOK_web.pdf |title=Global Study on Homicide |year=2013 |publisher=UNODC |access-date=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In large part, this is due to the country's ability to fulfil a pledge by increasing its national police yearly by 50%, a four-year initiative that was started in 2012. In addition to the yearly recruits, the Haitian National Police (HNP) has been using innovative technologies to crack down on crime. A notable bust in recent years{{When|date=March 2017}} led to the dismantlement of the largest kidnapping ring in the country with the use of an advanced software program developed by a [[United States Military Academy|West Point]]-trained Haitian official that proved to be so effective that it has led to its foreign advisers to make inquiries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.caribbeannewsnow.com/headline-Haiti-among-safest-destinations-in-the-Americas%252C-say-recent-studies-14006.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130111101726/http://www.caribbeannewsnow.com/headline-Haiti-among-safest-destinations-in-the-Americas%2C-say-recent-studies-14006.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=11 January 2013 |title=Haiti among safest destinations in the Americas, say recent studies |work=Caribbean News Now |date=7 January 2013 |access-date=20 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baltimorepostexaminer.com/haiti-earthquake-fails-to-deter-hotel-boom/2013/06/22 |title=Haiti earthquake fails to deter hotel boom |editor=Luxner, Larry |work=Baltimore Post-Examiner |date=22 June 2013 |access-date=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the [[New York City Police Department]] (NYPD) sent a team of veteran officers to Haiti to assist in the rebuilding of its police force with special training in investigative techniques, strategies to improve the anti-kidnapping personnel and community outreach to build stronger relationships with the public especially among the youth. It has also helped the HNP set up a police unit in the center of [[Delmas, Ouest|Delmas]], a neighborhood of Port-au-Prince.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/nation/2014/11/17/19200343/ |author=Associated Press|title=NYPD officers train Haitian police |work=USA Today |date=17 November 2014 |access-date=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2010/01/21/nypd-to-help-train-haitian-police/ |title=NYPD to help train Haitian police |editor=Weiss, Murray |work=New York Post |date=21 January 2011 |access-date=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USAID"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usaid.gov/haiti/governance-rule-law-and-security |title=Haiti: governance, Rule of Law, and Security |publisher=USAID |access-date=20 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426002122/http://www.usaid.gov/haiti/governance-rule-law-and-security |archivedate=26 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 and 2013, 150 HNP officers received specialized training funded by the US government, which also contributed to the infrastructure and communications support by upgrading radio capacity and constructing new police stations from the most violent-prone neighborhoods of [[Cité Soleil]] and [[Grande Ravine]] in Port-au-Prince to the new northern industrial park at [[Caracol, Nord-Est|Caracol]].&lt;ref name="USAID"/&gt;

=== Haitian penitentiary system ===
[[Port-au-Prince]] [[Prison|penitentiary]] is home to half of Haiti's prisoners. The prison has a capacity of 1,200 [[Detention (imprisonment)|detainees]] but {{as of|2017|November|lc=y}} the penitentiary was obliged to keep 4,359 detainees, a 454% occupancy level.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4241466/Haitian-prison-inmates-live-filthy-conditions.html|title=Haitian prison where inmates live in overcrowded and filthy conditions|work=Mail Online|access-date=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to severe consequences for the inmates.

One cell could hold up to 60 inmates which was originally designed for only 18, therefore creating tight and uncomfortable living conditions. The inmates are forced to create makeshift [[hammock]]s from the wall and ceilings. The men are on a 22/ 23 hour lock up in the cells so the risk of diseases is very high.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Unable to receive sufficient funds from the government as Haiti endures severe natural disasters which takes up their attention and resources, such as the 2010 earthquake, has caused deadly cases of [[malnutrition]], combined with the tight living conditions, increases the risk of infectious diseases such as [[tuberculosis]] which has led to 21 deaths in January 2017 alone at the Port-au-Prince penitentiary.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Haitian law states that once arrested, one must go before a judge within 48 hours; however, this is very rare. In an interview with [[Unreported World]], the prison governor stated that around 529 detainees were never sentenced, there are 3,830 detainees who are in prolonged detained trial detention. Therefore, 80% are not convicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Unreported World|title=Haiti's prison from hell {{!}} Unreported World|date=30 November 2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwE_uUgomd0|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unless families are able to provide the necessary funds for inmates to appear before a judge there is a very slim chance the inmate would have a trial, on average, within 10 years. [[Brian Concannon]], the director of the non-profit Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti, claims that without a substantial bribe to persuade judges, prosecutors and lawyers to undergo their case, there is no prospect for a getting a trial for years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/02/20/living-hell-officials-alarmed-by-upsurge-inmates-dying-in-haiti-prisons.html|title=Living hell: Officials alarmed by upsurge of inmates dying in Haiti prisons|date=20 February 2017|work=Fox News|access-date=30 March 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Families may send food to the penitentiary; however, most inmates depend on the meals served twice a day. Unfortunately, majority of the meals consist on rational supplies of rice, oats or cornmeal. This has led to deadly cases of malnutrition-related ailments such as [[Thiamine deficiency|beriberi]] and [[Anemia|anaemia]]. Prisoners too weak are crammed in the penitentiary infirmary.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-39034992|title=Haitian prison rife with malnutrition|date=21 February 2017|work=BBC News|access-date=30 March 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the confined living spaces for 22/ 23 hours a day, inmates are not provided with latrines and a forced to [[Defecation|defecate]] into plastic bags and leave them outside their cells. These conditions are considered in-humane by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in 2008.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Administrative divisions ===
{{Main|Administrative divisions of Haiti}}

Administratively, Haiti is divided into ten [[Departments of Haiti|departments]]. The departments are listed below, with the departmental capital cities in parentheses.

[[File:Haiti, administrative divisions - Nmbrs - colored.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|Departments of Haiti]]
# [[Nord-Ouest (department)|Nord-Ouest]] ([[Port-de-Paix]])
# [[Nord (Haitian department)|Nord]] ([[Cap-Haïtien]])

# [[Nippes]] ([[Miragoâne]])
# [[Sud (department)|Sud]] ([[Les Cayes]])
# [[Sud-Est (department)|Sud-Est]] ([[Jacmel]])

The departments are further divided into 42 [[Arrondissements of Haiti|arrondissement]]s, 145 [[Communes of Haiti|communes]] and 571 [[communal section]]s. These serve as, respectively, second- and third-level administrative divisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lenouvelliste.com/lenouvelliste/article/148647/Creation-de-cinq-nouvelles-communes-par-decret-presidentiel |title=Création de cinq nouvelles communes par décret présidentiel |editor=Olivier, Louis-Joseph |date=14 August 2015 |work=Le Nouvelliste |accessdate=17 March 2016}} {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haitilibre.com/en/news-14858-haiti-politic-5-new-communes-in-haiti.html |title=Haïti – Politique: 5 nouvelles communes en Haïti |date=16 August 2015 |work=Haiti Libre |accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://haiti-reference.com/pages/plan/geographie-et-tourisme/divisions-territoriales/ |title=7300.- Divisions territoriales |date=17 August 2015 |publisher=Haiti-Référence |accessdate=17 March 2016}} {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Haiti}}
[[File:Haiti Export Treemap.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|A proportional representation of Haiti's exports]]

Haiti's [[Gross domestic product#Cross-border comparison|purchasing power parity GDP]] fell  8% in 2010 (from US$12.15 billion to US$11.18 billion) and the GDP per capita remained unchanged at PPP US$1,200.&lt;ref name="CIA_20110303"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]] |work=[[The World Factbook]] |title=Haiti |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ha.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite having a viable tourist industry, Haiti is one of the world's poorest countries and the poorest in the Americas region, with poverty, corruption, poor infrastructure, lack of health care and lack of education cited as the main causes. Trade declined dramatically after the [[2010 Haiti earthquake|2010 earthquake]] and subsequent [[2010 Haiti cholera outbreak|outbreak of cholera]]. Haiti ranked 145 of 182 countries in the 2010 United Nations [[Human Development Index]], with 57.3% of the population being deprived in at least three of the HDI's poverty measures.&lt;ref name="UNDP_2010"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[United Nations Development Programme]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wu7eL0Db?url=http://hdrstats.undp.org/en/countries/profiles/HTI.html |archivedate=3 March 2011 |url=http://hdrstats.undp.org/en/countries/profiles/HTI.html |title=International Human Development Indicators: Haiti |year=2010 |others=2008 data in 2010 Report |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign aid===
{{Further|Foreign aid to Haiti}}

Haiti received more than US$4 billion in aid from 1990 to 2003, including US$1.5 billion from the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Thomson Reuters Foundation |url=http://www.trust.org/item/20090928173400-eslm0/ |title=Haiti's aid controversy |author=Anastasia Moloney |date=28 September 2009 |accessdate=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neighboring [[Dominican Republic]] has also provided extensive humanitarian aid to Haiti, including the funding and construction of a public university,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://elnuevodiario.com.do/app/article.aspx?id=272087|title=Universidad de Haití donada por RD se llamará ahora 'Roi Henry I'|author=|work=El Nuevo Diario|date=|accessdate=20 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806181826/http://elnuevodiario.com.do/app/article.aspx?id=272087|archive-date=6 August 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; human capital, free healthcare services in the border region, and logistical support after the 2010 earthquake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://es.globalvoices.org/2010/01/16/republica-dominicana-ayuda-a-su-vecino-haiti-despues-del-terremoto/ |title=República Dominicana: Ayuda a su vecino Haití después del terremoto  |author= | work = |date=|accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the UN Office of the Special Envoy for Haiti, {{as of|2012|March|lc=y}}, of humanitarian funding committed or disbursed by bilateral and multilateral donors in 2010 and 2011, only 1% has been pledged to the Haitian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.haitispecialenvoy.org/download/International_Assistance/1-overall-keyfacts.pdf |title=UN Office of the Special Envoy for Haiti Key Facts as of March 2012. }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2013 CIA ''World Factbook'', the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]] inflicted an estimated US$7.8 billion in damage and caused the country's GDP to contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ha.html |title=Haiti |accessdate=11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations states that in total US$13.34 billion has been earmarked for the crisis through 2020, though two years after the 2010 quake, less than half of that amount had actually been released, according to UN documents. {{As of|2015}}, the US government has allocated US$4 billion, US$3 billion has already been spent, and the rest is dedicated to longer-term projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/investigations/what-does-haiti-have-show-13-billion-earthquake-aid-n281661|title=What does Haiti have to show for the US$13 billion in earthquake aid?-NBC News.com |date= January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trade===
According to the 2015 CIA [[World Factbook]], Haiti's main import partners are: Dominican Republic 35%, US 26.8%, Netherlands Antilles 8.7%, China 7% (est. 2013).  Haiti's main export partner is the US 83.5% (est. 2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ha.html|title=The World Factbook|work=www.cia.gov|accessdate=24 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy===
In 1925, the city of Jacmel was the first area in the Caribbean to have electricity and was subsequently dubbed the ''City of Light''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/lighting-the-way-forward-in-haiti/article1319729/?service=mobile |title=Lighting the way forward in Haiti |author=Leeder, Jessica |work=The Globe and Mail |year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, Haiti relies heavily on an oil alliance with [[Petrocaribe]] for much of its energy requirements. In recent years, hydroelectric, solar and wind energy have been explored as possible sustainable energy sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.clintonfoundation.org/our-work/clinton-foundation-haiti/programs/powering-haiti-clean-energy |title=Powering Haiti with Clean Energy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 31, 2018, Evenson Calixte, the General Director of energy regulation (ANARSE) announced the 24 hour electricity project. To meet this objective, 236 Megawatt needs to installed in Port-au-Prince alone, with an additional 75 Megawatt needed in all other regions in the country. Presently only 27,5% of the population has access to electricity; moreover, the national energy agency l'Électricité d'Haïti (Ed'H) is only able to meet 62% of overall electricity demand said Fritz Caillot, the Minister of Public Works, Transportation and Communication (Travaux publics, transport et communication (TPTC)).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vantbefinfo.com/energie-le-projet-delectrification-24-24-presente-aux-citoyens-haitiens/|title=Vant Bèf Info Énergie : le projet d'électrification 24/24 présenté aux Citoyens haïtiens -|date=2018-10-31|work=Vant Bèf Info|access-date=2018-11-04|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal income===
[[File:CapHaitienMarche.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A market in [[Cap Haitien]] ]]

''[[The World Factbook]]'' reports a shortage of skilled labor, widespread unemployment and underemployment, saying "more than two-thirds of the labor force do not have formal jobs."   It is also often stated that three-quarters of the population lives on US$2 or less per day.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ha.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The World Factbook]]'' also states that "remittances are the primary source of foreign exchange, equaling one-fifth (20%) of GDP and representing more than five times the earnings from exports in 2012".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The World Factbook |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ha.html |work=www.cia.gov |accessdate=24 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that [[remittance]]s are the life-blood of the Haitian economy.

The World Bank estimates that over 80% of college graduates from Haiti were living abroad in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wuDIPQgH?url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/NEWS/0,,contentMDK:21109448~pagePK:64257043~piPK:437376~theSitePK:4607,00.html?cid=3001 |archivedate=3 March 2011 |url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/NEWS/0,,contentMDK:21109448~pagePK:64257043~piPK:437376~theSitePK:4607,00.html?cid=3001 |publisher=[[World Bank]] |title=Latin America Shouldn't Bet Everything On Remittances |date=31 October 2006 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haiti's economy was severely impacted by the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]] which occurred on 12 January 2010, killing over 300,000 and displacing 1.5 million residents.&lt;ref name = "CIA" &gt;[http://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ha.html CIA World Factbook], Haiti entry, accessed 1 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Real estate===
In rural areas, people often live in wooden huts with corrugated iron roofs. Outhouses are located in back of the huts. In Port-au-Prince, colorful [[shantytowns]] surround the central city and go up the mountainsides.&lt;ref name=c151222&gt;{{Cite news | first=Nathalie | last=Gagnon-Joseph | title=On sports, treasure hunting, and life | url=https://bartonchronicle.com/a-week-in-haiti-on-sports-treasure-hunting-and-life/| newspaper=The Chronicle | location=Barton, Vermont | pages= 28A, 29A | date=22 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!---the softcopy requires a subscription.

The middle and upper classes live in suburbs, or in the central part of the bigger cities in apartments, where there is urban planning. Many of the houses they live in are like miniature fortresses, located behind walls embedded with metal spikes, barbed wire, broken glass, and sometimes all three. The gates to these houses are barred at night, the house is locked; guard dogs patrol the yard. These houses are often self-sufficient as well. The houses have backup generators, because the electrical grid in Haiti is unreliable. Some even have rooftop reservoirs for water, as the water supply is also unreliable.&lt;ref name=c151222/&gt;

===Currency===
{{Main|Haitian gourde}}

The [[Haitian gourde]] (HTG) is the national currency. The "[[Haitian gourde|Haitian dollar]]" equates to 5 gourdes (''goud''), which is a fixed exchange rate that exists in concept ''only,'' but are commonly used as informal prices.

The vast majority of the business sector and individuals in Haiti will also accept US dollars, though at the outdoor markets gourdes may be preferred. Locals may refer to the USD as "dollar américain" (''dola ameriken'') or "dollar US" (pronounced ''oo-es'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haitihub.com/download/Money-Matters-in-Haiti.pdf |title=All About Money: Gourdes, Dollars and Sense for Work and Life in Haiti|publisher=haitihub.com |accessdate=16 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the country received 1,250,000 tourists (mostly from cruise ships), and the industry generated US$200 million in 2014.&lt;ref name="daniel5"/&gt;&lt;!---hard and soft copy sources do not match but are identical articles---&gt; In December 2014, the [[US State Department]] issued a travel warning about the country, noting that while thousands of American citizens safely visit Haiti each year, a few foreign tourists had been victims of burglary, predominantly in the [[Port-au-Prince]] area.&lt;ref name=bcawarn&gt;{{cite web |title=Haiti Travel Warning |url=https://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/tw/tw_5850.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028232407/http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/tw/tw_5850.html |archivedate=2013-10-28 |publisher=Bureau of Consular Affairs |accessdate=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Port-au-Prince used to be known for its docks where boats and shoppers would come and go with goods, but this is also where the 2010 earthquake struck the hardest and now the poverty struck city and people are still attempting to recover.

The [[Haitian Carnival]] has been one of the most popular carnivals in the Caribbean.

===Caracol Industrial Park===
On 21 October 2012, Haitian President [[Michel Martelly]], US Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]], Bill Clinton, [[Richard Branson]], [[Ben Stiller]] and [[Sean Penn]] inaugurated the {{convert|600|acre}} Caracol industrial park, the largest in the [[Caribbean]].&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2012/10/22/clinton-haiti-earthquake/1650763/ |title=Clintons land in Haiti to showcase industrial park | work = [[USA Today]] |date= 22 October 2012 |accessdate= 11 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Costing US$300 million, the project, which includes a 10-megawatt [[power plant]], a water-treatment plant and worker housing, is intended to transform the northern part of the country by creating 65,000 jobs.&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"/&gt;

The park is part of a "master plan" for Haiti's North and North-East departments, including the expansion of the [[Cap-Haitien International Airport]] to accommodate large international flights, the construction of an international Seaport in [[Fort-Liberté]] and the opening of the $50 million Roi Henri Christophe Campus of a new university in Limonade (near Cap-Haitien) on 12 January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/22/haiti-clinton-caracol-idUSL1E8LM3BF20121022 |title=Clintons preside at star-studded opening of Haitian industrial park |publisher=Reuters.com |date=22 October 2012 |accessdate=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[South Korea]]n clothing manufacturer [[Sae-A Trading Co. Ltd]], one of the park's main tenants, has created 5,000 permanent jobs out of the 20,000 projected and has built 8,600 houses in the surrounding area for its workers.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===
{{Main|Transport in Haiti}}
[[File:Haiti rail map 1925.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Rail map as of 1925]]

Haiti has two main highways that run from one end of the country to the other. The northern highway, Route Nationale No. 1 (National Highway One), originates in Port-au-Prince, winding through the coastal towns of [[Montrouis]] and [[Gonaïves]], before reaching its terminus at the northern port [[Cap-Haïtien]]. The southern highway, Route Nationale No. 2, links Port-au-Prince with [[Les Cayes]] via [[Léogâne]] and [[Petit-Goâve]].

According to the Washington Post, "Officials from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said Saturday [23 January 2010] that they assessed the damage from the [12 January] quake in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and found that many of the roads aren't any worse than they were before because they've always been in poor condition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/23/AR2010012302113.html |title=Haiti's Bad Roads not Damaged by Quake, Army Engineers Say |author=Hedgpeth, Dana |work=The Washington Post |date=23 January 2010 |accessdate=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The port at Port-au-Prince, [[Port international de Port-au-Prince]],  has more registered shipping than any of the other dozen ports in the country. The port's facilities include [[Crane (machine)|crane]]s, large [[Berth (moorings)|berth]]s, and [[warehouse]]s, but these facilities are not in good condition. The port is underused, possibly due to the substantially high port fees. The port of [[Saint-Marc]] is currently the preferred port of entry for consumer goods coming into Haiti. Reasons for this may include its location away from volatile and [[Traffic congestion|congested]] Port-au-Prince, as well as its central location relative to numerous Haitian cities.

During the 2010 earthquake, the Port-au-Prince port suffered widespread damage, impeding aid to the victims. The main pier caved in and fell into the water. One of the main cranes also collapsed in the water. Port access roads were severely damaged as well.

In the past, Haiti used rail transport, however the rail infrastructure was poorly maintained when in use and cost of rehabilitation is beyond the means of the Haitian economy.

===Airports===
[[File:Toussaint Louverture International Airport.jpg|thumb|Toussaint L'Ouverture International Airport]]
{{Main|List of airports in Haiti}}

[[Toussaint Louverture International Airport]], located {{convert|10|km}} North/North East of Port-au-Prince proper in the commune of [[Tabarre]], is the primary transportation hub regarding entry and exit into the country. It has Haiti's main [[jetway]], and along with [[Cap-Haïtien International Airport]] located near the northern city of Cap-Haïtien, handles the vast majority of the country's international flights. Cities such as Jacmel, Jérémie, Les Cayes, and Port-de-Paix have smaller, less accessible airports that are serviced by [[regional airlines]] and private aircraft. Such companies include: [[Caribintair]]  (defunct), [[Sunrise Airways]] and [[Tortug' Air]] (defunct).

In 2013, plans for the development of an international airport on Île-à-Vache were introduced by the Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haitilibre.com/en/news-9270-haiti-tourism-official-launch-of-project-tourist-destination-ile-a-vache.html|title=Haiti – Tourism : Official launch of project "Tourist destination Ile-à-Vache" – HaitiLibre.com : Haiti news 7/7|work=HaitiLibre.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bus service===
[[File:Tap tap public transportation Haiti.jpg|thumb|A "Tap tap" bus in [[Port-Salut]] ]]

[[Tap tap]] buses are colorfully painted buses or pick-up trucks that serve as share taxis. The "tap tap" name comes from the sound of passengers tapping on the metal bus body to indicate they want off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jansochor.com/photo-blog.aspx?id=tap-tap-haiti |title=Tap-Tap |accessdate=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These vehicles for hire are often privately owned and extensively decorated. They follow fixed routes, do not leave until filled with passengers, and riders can usually disembark at any point. The decorations are a typically Haitian form of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unv.org/en/news-resources/news/doc/un-volunteer-takes-part.html |title=UN Volunteer takes part in art exhibition in Germany |accessdate=29 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202105103/http://www.unv.org/en/news-resources/news/doc/un-volunteer-takes-part.html |archivedate=2 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2013, the first coach bus prototype was made in Haiti.&lt;ref name="http"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haitilibre.com/en/news-9284-haiti-economy-presentation-of-the-first-bus-prototype-made-in-haiti.html |title=Haiti – Economy : Presentation of the first Bus prototype Made in Haiti |accessdate=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communications===
{{Main|Telecommunications in Haiti|Television in Haiti}}

In Haiti, communications include the radio, television, fixed and mobile telephones, and the Internet. Haiti ranked last among North American countries in the World Economic Forum's Network Readiness Index (NRI){{snd}} an indicator for determining the development level of a country's information and communication technologies. Haiti ranked number 143 out of 148 overall in the 2014 NRI ranking, down from 141 in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www3.weforum.org/docs/GITR/2014/GITR_OverallRanking_2014.pdf | title=NRI Overall Ranking 2014 | publisher=World Economic Forum | accessdate=28 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Water supply and sanitation ===
{{Main|Water supply and sanitation in Haiti}}

Haiti faces key challenges in the [[water supply]] and [[sanitation]]
sector:
Notably, access to public services is very low, their quality is inadequate and public institutions remain very weak despite foreign aid and the government's declared intent to strengthen the sector's institutions. Foreign and Haitian [[NGO]]s play an important role in the sector, especially in rural and urban slum areas.

==Demographics==
{{Main|Demographics of Haiti}}
[[File:Haiti-demographie.png|thumb|upright=2.05|Haiti's population (1961–2003)]]

Haiti's population was about {{#expr:{{formatnum:{{UN_Population|Haiti}}|R}}/1e6 round 0}} million according to UN {{UN_Population|Year}} estimates,{{UN_Population|ref}} with half of the population younger than age 20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unfpa.org/public/global/pid/227 |title=New Haiti Census Shows Drastic Lack of Jobs, Education, Maternal Health Services |publisher=United Nations Population Fund |date=10 May 2006 |accessdate=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950 the first formal census gave a total population of 3.1 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://countrystudies.us/haiti/21.htm |title=Haiti – Population |publisher=[[Library of Congress Country Studies]] |accessdate=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haiti averages approximately 350 people per square kilometer (~900 per sq mi.), with its population concentrated most heavily in urban areas, coastal plains, and valleys.

Most modern Haitians are descendants of former black [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] slaves, including [[Free people of color|Mulattoes]] who are [[multiracial|mixed-race]]. The remainder are of [[White Haitian|Europe]]an or [[Arab Haitians|Arab descent]],&lt;ref name="joshuaproject.net"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.joshuaproject.net/peopctry.php |title=Aimaq, Firozkohi of Afghanistan Ethnic People Profile |publisher=Joshua Project |accessdate=14 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/haiti.html |title=The Virtual Jewish History Tour: Haiti |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |accessdate=14 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the descendants of settlers (colonial remnants and contemporary immigration during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]). Haitians of [[East Asia]]n descent or [[Marabou (ethnicity)|East Indian]] origin number approximately 400+.

===Population genetics===

====Autosomal DNA====
The [[gene pool]] of Haiti is about 95.5% [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]n, 4.3% [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]], with the rest showing some traces of [[East Asia]]n genes;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Simms, Tanya M.|author2=Rodríguez, Carol E.|author3=Rodríguez, Rosa|author4=Herrera, René J.|title=The genetic structure of populations from Haiti and Jamaica reflect divergent demographic histories|date=May 2010|page=63|doi=10.1002/ajpa.21194|pmid=19918989|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38094802_The_genetic_structure_of_populations_from_Haiti_and_Jamaica_reflect_divergent_demographic_histories|accessdate=18 May 2015|journal=Am J Phys Anthropol|volume=142|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to a 2010 [[autosomal]] [[genealogical DNA test]]ing.

====Y-chromosome and Mitochondrial DNA====
{{Expand section|with=information about [[Human mitochondrial DNA haplogroup]]s, which assesses the DNA inherited by [[matriline]]|date=June 2015|small=no}}

A 2012 genetic study on Haitian and Jamaican [[Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup|Y-chromosomal ancestry]] has revealed that both populations "exhibit a predominantly [[Y-DNA haplogroups in populations of Sub-Saharan Africa|Sub-Saharan paternal component]], with haplogroups [[Haplogroup A (Y-DNA)|A1b-V152]], [[Haplogroup A (Y-DNA)|A3-M32]], [[Haplogroup B (Y-DNA)|B2-M182]], [[Haplogroup E (Y-DNA)|E1a-M33]], [[Haplogroup E (Y-DNA)|E1b1a-M2]], [[Haplogroup E (Y-DNA)|E2b-M98]], and [[Haplogroup R1b (Y-DNA)#R1b1c (R-V88)|R1b2-V88]]" comprising (77.2%) of the Haitian and (66.7%) of Jamaican paternal gene pools.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Simms, TM|author2=Wright, MR|author3=Hernandez, M|author4=Perez, OA|author5=Ramirez, EC|author6=Martinez, E|author7=Herrera, RJ|title=Y-chromosomal diversity in Haiti and Jamaica: contrasting levels of sex-biased gene flow|date=11 May 2012|doi=10.1002/ajpa.22090|pmid=22576450|url=|journal=Am J Phys Anthropol|volume=148|issue=4|pages=618–31}}&lt;!--|accessdate=20 May 2015--&gt;&lt;/&lt;/ref&gt; Y Chromosomes indicative of [[Y-DNA haplogroups in populations of Europe|European ancestry]] "(i.e., haplogroups [[Haplogroup G-M201|G2a*-P15]], [[Haplogroup I-M170|I-M258]], [[Haplogroup R1b (Y-DNA)#R1b1a2 (R-M269)|R1b1b-M269]], and [[Haplogroup T-M184|T-M184]]) were detected at commensurate levels in Haiti (20.3%) and Jamaica (18.9%)".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Casta discrimination===
{{Main|Casta|Gens de couleur}}

Due to the [[Casta|racial caste system]] instituted in colonial Haiti, [[Mulatto|Haitian mulattoes]] became the nation's social elite and racially privileged. Numerous leaders throughout Haiti's history have been mulattoes. Comprising 5% of the nation's population, mulattoes have retained their preeminence, evident in the political, economic, social and cultural hierarchy in Haiti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smucker|first=Glenn R|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+ht0033%29|title=A Country Study: Haiti; The Upper Class|editor=Haggerty, Richard A. |publisher=Library of Congress Federal Research Division|date=December 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, the slaves and the affranchis were given limited opportunities toward education, income, and occupations, but even after gaining independence, the social structure remains a legacy today as the disparity between the upper and lower classes have not been reformed significantly since the colonial days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2574763|title=Class Structure and Class Conflict in Haitian Society|first1=Roland|last1=Wingfield|first2=Vernon J.|last2=Parenton|date=1965|journal=Social Forces|volume=43|issue=3|pages=338–347|doi=10.2307/2574763}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the elite class today consists of a small group of influential people who are generally light in color and continue to establish themselves in high, prestigious positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2769747|title=Caste and Class in Haiti|first=John|last=Lobb|date=2018|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=46|issue=1|pages=23–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexandre Pétion]], born to a Haitian mother and a wealthy French father, was the first President of the Republic of Haiti.

The 2017 CIA Factbook reported that around 54.7% of Haitians profess to being [[Roman Catholicism in Haiti|Catholics]] while [[Protestantism in Haiti|Protestants]] made up about 28.5% of the population (Baptist 15.4%, Pentecostal 7.9%, [[Seventh-day Adventist]] 3%, Methodist 1.5%, other 0.7%). Other sources put the Protestant population higher than this, suggesting that it might have formed one-third of the population in 2001.&lt;ref name="ReyStepick2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rey|first1=Terry|last2=Stepick|first2=Alex|title=Crossing the Water and Keeping the Faith: Haitian Religion in Miami|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=40SIdXeUEhUC&amp;pg=PA6|year=2013|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-1-4798-2077-1|page=6|quote=With no indications of any subsequent decline in Protestant affiliation either in Port-au-Prince or the countryside, one could reasonably estimate that today Haiti is already more than one-third Protestant}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like other countries in Latin America, Haiti has witnessed a general Protestant expansion, which is largely [[Evangelical Protestant|Evangelical]] and [[Pentecostal]] in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/gleanings/2014/november/sorry-pope-francis-protestants-catholics-latin-america-pew.html|title=Sorry, Pope Francis: Protestants Are Converting Catholics Across Latin America|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2014/11/13/religion-in-latin-america/|title=Religion in Latin America|date=13 November 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2006/10/05/overview-pentecostalism-in-latin-america/|title=Overview: Pentecostalism in Latin America|date=5 October 2006|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haitian [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Chibly Langlois]] is president of the National Bishops Conference of the Catholic Church.

[[Haitian vodou|Vodou]], a religion with African roots similar to those of [[Cuba]] and [[Brazil]], originated during colonial times in which slaves were obliged to disguise their [[loa]] or spirits as [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] saints, an element of a process called [[syncretism]] and is still practiced by some Haitians today.

===Languages===
The two official languages of Haiti are [[French language|French]] and [[Haitian Creole]]. French is the principal written and administratively authorized language (as well as the main language of the press) and is spoken by 42% of Haitians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=La langue française dans le monde 2014|date=2014|publisher=Nathan|isbn=978-2-09-882654-0|url=http://www.francophonie.org/Langue-Francaise-2014/projet/Rapport-OIF-2014.pdf|accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;À ce propos, voir l'essai ''Prétendus Créolismes : le couteau dans l'igname'', Jean-Robert Léonidas, Cidihca, Montréal 1995&lt;/ref&gt; It is spoken by all educated Haitians, is the medium of instruction in most schools, and is used in the business sector. It is also used in ceremonial events such as weddings, graduations and church Masses. Haiti is one of two independent nations in the Americas (along with Canada) to designate French as an [[official language]]; the other French-speaking areas are all [[French overseas departments and territories|overseas]] ''[[Departments of France|départements]]'', or ''[[Overseas collectivity|collectivités]],'' of France.

Haitian Creole,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~creole/creolenatllangofhaiti.html |title=Creole: The National Language of Haiti |author=Valdman, Albert |journal=Footsteps|volume= 2|issue=4|pages= 36–39 |publisher=Indiana University Creole Institute }}&lt;/ref&gt; which has recently undergone a standardization, is spoken by virtually the entire population of Haiti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiana.edu/~creole/creolenatllangofhaiti.html |title=creolenationallanguageofhaiti |publisher= [[Indiana University]] |accessdate= 11 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haitian Creole is one of the [[French-based creole languages]].

===Emigration===
{{Main|Haitian diaspora}}

Emigrants from Haiti have constituted a segment of American and Canadian society since before [[Haitian Revolution|the independence of Haiti from France]] in 1804.&lt;ref name="HammondCanadaHaiti2010"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hammond|first1=Stuart|title=Canada and Haiti: A brief history|url=http://canadahaitiaction.ca/canada-haiti-history|website=Canada Haiti Action Network|accessdate=13 August 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202034558/http://canadahaitiaction.ca/canada-haiti-history|archivedate=2 February 2016|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PBSResourceBank"&gt;{{cite web|title=People &amp; Events French West Indian refugees in Philadelphia  1792 – 1800|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part3/3p466.html|website=PBS.org|accessdate=13 August 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304063339/https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part3/3p466.html|archivedate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many influential early American settlers and black freemen, including [[Jean Baptiste Point du Sable]] and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], were of Haitian origin.&lt;ref name="Kinzie 1856 190"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kinzie|1856|p=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Meehan 1963 445"&gt;{{Harvnb|Meehan|1963|p=445}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohn2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cohn|first=Scotti|title=It Happened in Chicago|year=2009|work=Globe Pequot|isbn=0-7627-5056-1|pages=2–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewis18"&gt;Lewis, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jean Baptiste Point du Sable, an immigrant from [[Saint-Domingue]] (now the Republic of Haiti), founded the first nonindigenous settlement in what is now [[Chicago, Illinois]], the third largest city in the United States. The state of Illinois and city of Chicago declared du Sable the founder of Chicago on 26 October 1968.&lt;ref name="Kinzie 1856 190"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Meehan 1963 445"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohn2009"/&gt;

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Haiti}}
{{Culture of Haiti}}

Haiti has a rich and unique cultural identity, consisting of a large blend of traditional customs of French and African, mixed with sizeable contributions from the Spanish and indigenous Taíno cultures.&lt;ref name="Yurnet-Thomas"&gt;fdan{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=giQaoQz8N0AC&amp;pg=PA13|title=A Taste of Haiti |author=Yurnet-Thomas, Mirta |pages=13–15 |year=2002 |isbn=0781809983 |accessdate=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country's customs essentially are a blend of cultural beliefs that derived from the various ethnic groups that inhabited the island of Hispaniola. Haiti's culture is greatly reflected in its paintings, music, and literature. Galleries and museums in the United States and [[France]] have exhibited the works of the better-known artists to have come out of Haiti.&lt;ref name="Haitians"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/wc/Germany-to-Jamaica/Haitians.html |title=Haitians |accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art===
{{Main|Haitian art}}

Haitian art is [[Haitian art|distinctive]], particularly through its paintings and sculptures, known for its various artistic expressions.&lt;ref name="Yurnet-Thomas" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://globalfaithinaction.org/haiti-culture-and-sports/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427211956/http://globalfaithinaction.org/haiti-culture-and-sports/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=27 April 2012 |title=Haiti – Culture And Sports |author=Onofre, Alejandro Guevara |accessdate=2 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/art/haiti/ |title=In Haiti, Art Remains a Solid Cornerstone |author=Legro, Tom |date=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brilliant colors, [[Naïve art|naïve]] perspectives, and sly humor characterize [[Haitian art]]. Frequent subjects in Haitian art include big, delectable foods, lush landscapes, market activities, jungle animals, rituals, dances, and gods. Artists frequently paint in fables. People are disguised as animals and animals are transformed into people.

As a result of a deep history and strong African ties, symbols take on great meaning within Haitian society. For example, a rooster often represents Aristide and the red and blue colors of the Haitian flag often represent his Lavalas party. Many artists cluster in 'schools' of painting, such as the Cap-Haïtien school, which features depictions of daily life in the city, the Jacmel School, which reflects the steep mountains and bays of that coastal town, or the Saint-Soleil School, which is characterized by abstracted human forms and is heavily influenced by Vodou symbolism.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

===Music and dance===
{{Further|Music of Haiti}}

Haitian music combines a wide range of influences drawn from the many people who have settled on this Caribbean island. It reflects French, African rhythms, Spanish elements and others who have inhabited the island of [[Hispaniola]] and minor native [[Taino]] influences. Styles of music unique to the nation of Haiti include music derived from [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]] ceremonial traditions, [[Rara]] parading music, [[Twoubadou]] ''ballads'', [[mini-jazz]] rock bands, [[Rasin]] movement, [[Haitian hip hop|Hip hop]] kreyòl, [[méringue]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afropop.org/radio/radio_program/ID/692/Music%20and%20the%20Story%20of%20Haiti|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113022326/http://www.afropop.org/radio/radio_program/ID/692/Music%20and%20the%20Story%20of%20Haiti|archivedate= 13 November 2007 |title=Music and the Story of Haiti |publisher=Afropop Worldwide}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[compas]]. Youth attend parties at nightclubs called ''[[Nightlife|discos]]'', (pronounced "deece-ko"), and attend ''Bal''. This term is the French word for ball, as in a formal dance.

''[[Compas]] (konpa)'' (also known as ''compas direct'' in [[French language|French]], or ''konpa dirèk'' in [[Haitian Creole language|creole]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heritagekonpa.com/The%20Haitian%20Music%20Billboard.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210081147/http://www.heritagekonpa.com/The%20Haitian%20Music%20Billboard.htm |archivedate=10 February 2010 |title=Haitian music billboard |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=10 February 2010 |accessdate=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a complex, ever-changing music that arose from African rhythms and European ballroom dancing, mixed with Haiti's bourgeois culture. It is a refined music, with [[méringue]] as its basic rhythm. Haiti had no recorded music until 1937 when [[Jazz Guignard]] was recorded non-commercially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gwEL9mUcVA8C&amp;pg=PA23|title=A Day for the Hunter, a Day for the Prey: Popular Music and Power in Haiti |author=Averill, Gage |year=1997 |page=23 |isbn=0226032914 |accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
{{Main|Haitian literature}}

Haiti has always been a literary nation that has produced poetry, novels, and plays of international recognition. The [[Saint Domingue|French colonial experience]] established the French language as the venue of culture and prestige, and since then it has dominated the literary circles and the literary production. However, since the 18th century there has been a sustained effort to write in [[Haitian Creole]]. The recognition of Creole as an official language has led to an expansion of novels, poems, and plays in Creole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=[http://www.voicesfromhaiti.com/2012/06/meet-dr-marie-jose-nzengou-tayo/ Nzengou-Tayo] |first= Marie-José  |title=Creole and French in Haitian Literature |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4xbGzLuBvWwC&amp;pg=PA153|journal=The Haitian Creole Language: History, Structure, Use, and Education |language=English |publisher=Lexington Books |pages=153–176 |isbn=0739172212|date= 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975,  [[Franketienne]] was the first to break with the French tradition in fiction with the publication of ''Dezafi,'' the first novel written entirely in Haitian Creole.

More than 80% of primary schools are privately managed by nongovernmental organizations, churches, communities, and for-profit operators, with minimal government oversight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Education: Overview |url=http://www.usaid.gov/Haiti/education |work=United States Agency for International Development |accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2013 Millennium Development Goals (MDG) Report, Haiti has steadily boosted net enrollment rate in primary education from 47% in 1993 to 88% in 2011, achieving equal participation of boys and girls in education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Haiti boosts health and education in the past decade, says new UNDP report |url=http://www.latinamerica.undp.org/content/rblac/en/home/presscenter/pressreleases/2014/06/25/haiti-makes-progress-towards-reducing-poverty-and-boosts-health-and-education-in-the-past-decade-says-new-undp-report.html |work=United Nations Development Programme |accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charity organizations, including [[Food for the Poor]] and [[Haitian Health Foundation]], are building schools for children and providing necessary school supplies.
According to CIA 2015 [[World Factbook]], Haiti's literacy rate is now 60.7% (est. 2015).

The January 2010 earthquake, was a major setback for education reform in Haiti as it diverted limited resources to survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haitiedstories.org/background/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426021641/http://www.haitiedstories.org/background/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=26 April 2011 |title=Haiti's Lost Children |publisher=Haitiedstories.org |accessdate=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many reformers have advocated the creation of a free, public and universal education system for all primary school-age students in Haiti. The [[Inter-American Development Bank]] estimates that the government will need at least US$3 billion to create an adequately funded system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Paul Franz, for the Pulitzer Center, Port-au-Prince, Haiti |url=http://pulitzercenter.org/blog/untold-stories/improving-access-education-haiti |title=Improving Access to Education in Haiti |publisher=Pulitzercenter.org |date=25 October 2010 |accessdate=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon successful graduation of secondary school, students may continue into [[higher education]]. The higher education schools in Haiti include the [[University of Haiti]]. There are also [[List of medical schools in the Caribbean|medical schools]] and [[Legal education|law schools]] offered at both the University of Haiti and abroad. Presently, [[Brown University]] is cooperating with L'Hôpital Saint-Damien in Haiti to coordinate a [[pediatrics|pediatric health care]] curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://brown.edu/initiatives/global-health/haiti/medical-education-and-leadership-development-project-meld|title=Haiti|publisher=|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most people living in Haiti are at high risk for major infectious diseases. Food or [[Waterborne diseases|water-borne]] diseases include bacterial and protozoal [[diarrhea]], [[typhoid fever]] and [[hepatitis]] A and E; common [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]]-borne diseases are [[dengue fever]] and [[malaria]]; water-contact diseases include [[leptospirosis]]. Roughly 75% of Haitian households lack running water. Unsafe water, along with inadequate housing and unsanitary living conditions, contributes to the high incidence of infectious diseases. There is a chronic shortage of health care personnel and hospitals lack resources, a situation that became readily apparent after the January 2010 earthquake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA528274 |title=The Geology of Haiti: An Annotated Bibliography of Haiti's Geology, Geography and Earth Science |author1=Robert Lee Hadden |author2=Steven G.

'''Hong Kong people in the United Kingdom''' are [[Hong Kong people|people from Hong Kong]] who are residing in the [[United Kingdom]] or [[British nationality law|British citizens]] of Hong Kong origin or descent.

==Background==
The United Kingdom has historically been a popular destination for Hong Kong immigrants due to the colonial relationship between the two countries.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} The UK's popularity among immigrants was also helped by the fact that the [[English language]] enjoys official status in both countries.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} While many Hong Kong-born residents of the UK are ethnically [[Chinese people|Chinese]], others include the children of colonial parentage (British and/or other European heritage, and people with ancestries from other parts of the former British colonial empire) born in Hong Kong prior to the [[Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|transfer of sovereignty]] to China in 1997.&lt;ref name="Born abroad"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/uk/05/born_abroad/countries/html/hong_kong.stm|title=Born abroad: Hong Kong|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=5 April 2010 | date=7 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
The [[2001 UK Census|2001 Census]] recorded 96,445 Hong Kong-born people residing in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=OECD&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/18/23/34792376.xls |title=Country-of-birth database |publisher=[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] |accessdate=2009-08-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070425115809/http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/18/23/34792376.xls |archivedate=2007-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Office for National Statistics]] estimates suggest that the Hong Kong-born resident population was 78,000 in 2009.&lt;ref name="2009 estimates"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_population/Population-by-country-of-birth-and-nationality-Oct08-Sep09.zip |title=Estimated population resident in the United Kingdom, by foreign country of birth (Table 1.3) |publisher=[[Office for National Statistics]] |date=September 2009 |accessdate=8 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vvnKhoUi?url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_population/Population-by-country-of-birth-and-nationality-Oct08-Sep09.zip |archivedate=22 January 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These figures would have excluded people who were born elsewhere, yet raised in and emigrated to the UK from HK, and descendants of Hongkongers born within the UK.

According to census data, the number of people born in Hong Kong living in Scotland in 2001 was 7,068. The figure for 1991 was 5,910.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.scot/Resource/Doc/285746/0087034.pdf |title=Scotland's Diaspora|website=gov.scot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2009/09/24095045/3|title=Scotland's Diaspora and Overseas-Born Population|first=St Andrew's House|last=Scottish Government|date=5 October 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maud, Abbess of Montivilliers''' was a natural daughter of [[Henry I of England]] by an unknown [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]].&lt;ref name=White&gt;Geoffrey H. White, ‘ "Associates" and Illegitimate Children of King Henry (I) Beauclerc of England’, Appendix D of ''[[The Complete Peerage]]'', Volume XI, 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Thompson/&gt; She is not to be confused with Isabel, another illegitimate daughter of Henry I by his mistress Isabel de Beaumont&lt;ref name=White/&gt;&lt;ref name=Thompson/&gt; (c. 1102 – c. 1172), herself a sister of [[Robert de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Leicester]].

Maud (or Mathilda) was a half-sister of the [[Empress Matilda]], who agreed to work with her.&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;Kathleen Thompson, ‘Affairs of State: the illegitimate children of Henry I’, ''Journal of Medieval History'', 29 (2003), pp. 129–151.&lt;/ref&gt; She may have valued her company and advice.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} &lt;!-- most probably from Chibnall, Empress Mathilda, p. 186? --&gt;

Matilda became the [[abbess]] of the [[Montivilliers|Abbey Church of Notre-Dame, Montivilliers]], and for that reason is best known as Maud of Montivilliers.

The participation of '''Moldova in the Turkvision Song Contest''' was expected to begin in [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]], at the [[Turkvision Song Contest 2016]]. The national broadcaster responsible for the selection process of Moldova's participants has yet to be known. Moldova had selected Polina Stefoglo with her song "Yallah Yallah!", as their debut entry. However, the 2016 contest was subsequently cancelled due to the [[December 2016 Istanbul bombings]].

==Origins of the contest==
Turkvision is an annual song contest which was created by [[TÜRKSOY]] in cooperation with the Turkish music channel [[TMB TV]]. Based on the similar format of the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], Turkvision focuses primarily on participating [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] countries and regions. The participating countries and regions have to take part in the Semi Final. A juror from each nation awards between 1 and 10 points for every entry, except their own. An amount of 12 to 15 nations qualify for the Grand Final where the jury determines the winner. TÜRKSOY has stated that televoting is going to be introduced in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Turkvision, How is the Format of Turkvision Song Contest|url=http://www.turkvision.info/What-is-Turkvision,-How-is-the-Format-of-Turkvision-Song-Contest-1-h.htm|publisher=turkvision.info|accessdate=22 April 2017|date=15 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308012519/http://turkvision.info/what-is-turkvision%2C-how-is-the-format-of-turkvision-song-contest-1-h.htm|archivedate=8 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] in which the winning country proceeds to host the following year's event, hosting of the Turkvision Song Contest takes place in the country or region that is also hosting the [[Culture and Arts Capital of the Turkic World|Turkish Capital of Culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Where Will Turkvision Be Held, In Which Country Is Turkvision|url=http://www.turkvision.info/Where-Will-Turkvision-Be-Held,-In-Which-Country-Is-Turkvision-4-h.htm|publisher=turkvision.info|accessdate=22 April 2017|date=15 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311020026/http://turkvision.info/where-will-turkvision-be-held%2C-in-which-country-is-turkvision-4-h.htm|archivedate=11 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Turkvision Song Contest 2016===

On 25 November 2016, it was announced that Moldova would be making their Turkvision debut at the [[Turkvision Song Contest 2016|2016 edition]], and had internally selected Polina Stefoglo, while her song was revealed to be sung in Turkish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Granger|first1=Anthony|url=https://eurovoix-world.com/moldova-polina-stefoglo-turkvision-2016/|title=Moldova: Polina Stefoglo To Turkvision 2016|date=25 November 2016|accessdate=25 November 2016|website=eurovoix-world.com|publisher=Eurovoix}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 December 2016, Stefoglo's song was revealed to be called "Yallah Yallah!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Granger|first1=Anthony|url=https://eurovoix-world.com/moldova-yallah-yallah-title-first-turkvision-song-contest-entry/|title=Moldova: "Yallah Yallah!"

===Turkvision Song Contest 2017===

Following the cancellation of the [[Turkvision Song Contest 2016]], it was confirmed by the Ministry of Culture and Sports in Kazakhstan, that the 2017 edition would take place in [[Astana]], [[Kazakhstan]], and would coincide with other events taking place in the city as part of [[Expo 2017]].&lt;ref name="TSC2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Granger|first1=Anthony|title=Turkvision Song Contest 2017 to be held in Kazakhstan|url=https://eurovoix-world.com/turkvision-song-contest-2017-to-be-held-in-kazakhstan/|website=eurovoix-world.com|publisher=Eurovoix|date=15 February 2017|accessdate=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contest was originally going to be held at the [[Barys Arena]],&lt;ref name="Barys Arena"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Granger|first1=Anthony|title=Turkvision 17 Barys Arena announced as venue|url=https://eurovoix-world.com/turkvision17-barys-arena-announced-venue/|website=eurovoix-world.com|publisher=Eurovoix|date=16 February 2017|accessdate=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the two semi-finals taking place on 8 and 9 September, and the final on 10 September 2017.&lt;ref name="Turkvision 2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Granger|first1=Anthony|title=Final of Turkvision 2017 to be held September 10|url=https://eurovoix-world.com/turkvision17-final-turkvision-2017-held-september-10/|website=eurovoix-world.com|publisher=Eurovoix|date=18 February 2017|accessdate=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 27 March 2017, it was announced that the dates and venue had subsequently been changed, with the [[Saryarka Velodrome]] as the new venue, and the contest itself taking place on 29 and 31 August 2017.&lt;ref name="Velodrome"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Granger|first1=Anthony|title=Turkvision 17 venue and contest dates changed|url=https://eurovoix-world.com/turkvision17-venue-contest-dates-changed/|website=eurovoix-world.com|publisher=Eurovoix|date=27 March 2017|accessdate=27 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Palestine Liberation Army''' ('''PLA''', {{lang-ar|جيش التحرير الفلسطيني}}, Jaysh al-Tahrir al-Filastini) was ostensibly set up as the military wing of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) at the [[1964 Arab League summit (Alexandria)|1964 Arab League summit]] held in [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt]], with the mission of fighting Israel. However, it has never been under effective PLO control, but rather it has been controlled by its various host governments, usually [[Syria]].

==History==
=== Foundation ===
Immediately after its creation at the 1964 Arab League summit in Alexandria, the PLO (then headed by [[Ahmad Shukeiri]]) was effectively under the control of the [[Arab states]], especially [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]]'s [[Egypt]]. The [[Palestinians]] would not gain independent control of the organization until [[Yasser Arafat]]'s [[Fatah]] faction wrested it from Nasser-backed Palestinians in 1968–69, when the Arab states were discredited by losing the [[Six-Day War]], and militant Palestinian organizations were rapidly gaining in importance.

The PLA was originally organized into three [[brigades]], named after historic battles:
* '''[[Battle of Ain Jalut|Ayn Jalut]]''', based in [[Gaza City|Gaza]], then administered by [[Egypt]].
* '''[[Battle of al-Qādisiyyah|Qadisiyyah]]''', originally based in [[Iraq]], but transferred to [[Jordan]] in 1967.
* '''[[Battle of Hattin|Hattin]]''', based in Syria.

These brigades were staffed by Palestinian [[refugee]]s under the control of the host countries, who would perform their [[military service]] in these units instead of in their host countries' regular armed forces. Formally, the PLA was under the command of the PLO's Military Department, but in practice, none of the governments involved relinquished control of the brigades.

In 1968, the Popular Liberation Forces ([[Arabic]]: ''quwwat at-tahrir ash-sha'biyya''), better known as the "Yarmouk Brigade", were established within the framework of the PLA to perform [[commando]] actions against Israeli forces in the [[Gaza Strip]], occupied by Israeli forces the year before. Generally the PLA refrained from this kind of underground action, having been built up as something of a conventional military parade showpiece.

At its largest, the PLA comprised eight brigades with a total of some 12,000 uniformed soldiers. They were equipped with small-arms, [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]]s, [[Shoulder-launched missile weapon|rocket launchers]], wheeled [[BTR-152]] [[armored personnel carrier]]s and [[T-34|T-34/85]] tanks. However, the PLA was never deployed in the form of a single fighting unit for the PLO, but instead battalion-size elements were utilized as an [[Auxiliaries|auxiliary]] force by its controller governments.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Arab Armies of the Middle East Wars 1948–73''. John Laffin, Osprey, Men at Arms Series 128, 1982 and 2000, {{ISBN|0-85045-451-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Operations in Jordan and Lebanon ===
After its foundation, the PLA came to be used as political cover by its host governments, especially Syria. In course of the [[Black September]] of 1970, hastily repainted [[Syrian Army]] [[tank]]s under the command of the PLA were sent into Jordan to aid the Palestinian [[guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]] against the [[Jordanian Armed Forces]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; probably with the ultimate aim to overthrow the Jordanian [[monarchy]].{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=326}} Although the initial invasion was successful, with PLA forces capturing [[Irbid]] and declaring it a "liberated" city,{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=326}} the Jordanian military eventually managed to stall the attack in course of heavy fighting.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|pp=326, 333}} After international pressure, and threats of intervention from both Israel and the United States, the combined PLA-Syrian forces were forced to turn back; an embarrassment which would contribute greatly to the overthrow of the government of [[Salah Jadid]] by [[Hafez al-Assad]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The failure of the invasion has also attributed to the fact that the [[Syrian Air Force]] under al-Assad had refused to enter the fighting in the first place.&lt;ref name="Migdal_Shifting_Sands"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Migdal|first1=Joel|year=2014|origyear=|chapter=4. Finding a Place in the Middle East: A New Partnership Develops out of Black September|title=Shifting Sands: The United States in the Middle East|url=http://cup.columbia.edu/book/shifting-sands/9780231166720|publisher=Columbia University Press|publication-date=February 2014|isbn=9780231166720|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141209112810/http://cup.columbia.edu/book/shifting-sands/9780231166720|archivedate=9 December 2014|accessdate=20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Lebanese Civil War]], Syria likewise made extensive use of the PLA as a [[proxy war|proxy force]], including against the PLO (the PLA however proved unreliable when ordered to fight other Palestinians, and suffered from mass defections). The PLA was largely destroyed as a fighting force during the 1982 Israeli invasion of southern [[Lebanon]] that started the [[1982 Lebanon War]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Its fighters in Lebanon left for [[Tunis]] when the PLO evacuated [[Beirut]] that year, in a US-sponsored [[cease fire]] agreement. The Egyptian PLA was also deployed in Lebanon in 1976, after Palestinian leader [[Yassir Arafat]] had approached the Egyptian [[President of Egypt|president]] [[Anwar Sadat]], to mend relations damaged by Sadat's peacemaking attempts with Israel. Still, the Egyptian units never proved as important as the fully deployed Syrian PLA.

Many PLA soldiers in Egypt and Jordan later became the core of the [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian Authority]]'s (PNA) [[Palestinian National Security Forces|National Guard]], after the signing of the 1993 [[Oslo Accords]], when they were allowed to enter the [[Palestinian Territories]] to take up positions in the PNA security services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/pla.htm|title=Palestine Liberation Army (PLA)|author=John Pike|publisher=|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Syrian Civil War ===
The Syrian PLA remains active, closely coordinated with the Syrian-controlled [[as-Sa'iqa]] faction of the PLO, although the importance of both had diminished over the years. The PLA has been rebuilt and Palestinians in Syria are still drafted to perform their military service in its ranks. Though completely staffed by Palestinians, it remains outside of the PLO's control, and is in effect integrated into the Syrian Army. Nevertheless, it poses as an independent entity, and occasionally organizes pro-government rallies celebrating Syrian commitment to the Palestinian cause.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vortex"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/01/world/middleeast/palestinians-in-syria-drawn-into-the-violence.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=0 |title=Palestinians in Syria Are Reluctantly Drawn Into Vortex of Uprising |author1=Rod Nordland |author2=Dalal Mawad |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=30 June 2012 |accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the outbreak of the [[Syrian Civil War]], the PLA sided with the government and began to fight against the [[Syrian opposition]].&lt;ref name="vortex" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WO1207/S00485/hamas-slams-killing-of-palestinian-troops-in-syria.htm|title=Hamas slams killing of Palestinian troops in Syria|publisher=|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Led by Major General Muhammad Tariq al-Khadra,&lt;ref name="hamas slams" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pro-Assad" /&gt; the PLA has taken part in campaigns in the [[Rif Dimashq Governorate|Rif Dimashq]], [[Daraa Governorate|Daraa]], and [[Quneitra Governorate]]s.

'''Thabang Thabong''' was an educational [[children's television]] programme from [[South Africa]] broadcast weekday mornings on [[SABC2]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://thabangthabong.co.za/welcome.php?mcat=About_Us About us] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830174744/http://thabangthabong.co.za/welcome.php?mcat=About_Us |date=2011-08-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The programme featured a mixture of human and puppet characters plus some animation. It is no longer aired by SABC.

==Plot==
The programme revolves around Tumi, a woman who lives in a house in Thabang Thabong with  a four-year-old girl Tandi, and two meerkats Tiki and Toko. Tumi is the teacher, and also the parental figure of the program. The characters have adventures, sing songs, read books and do dances and exercises. If they have questions, they usually ask Blob, a clay animated blob, that makes shapes and objects to answer their questions because he can't speak. Once a week the flamboyant Thembi comes in with mail from fans. These letters are then read out and drawings sent in are shown.

'''USA-183''', also known as '''GPS IIR-14(M)''', '''GPS IIRM-1''' and '''GPS SVN-53''', is an [[United States|American]] [[navigation satellite]] which forms part of the [[Global Positioning System]]. It was the first of eight [[GPS Block IIRM|Block IIRM]] satellites to be launched, and the fourteenth of twenty one [[GPS Block IIR|Block IIR]] satellites overall. It was built by [[Lockheed Martin]], using the [[AS-4000]] [[satellite bus]].&lt;ref name="GSP"/&gt;

USA-183 was launched at 03:37:00 UTC on 26 September 2005, atop a [[Delta II]] carrier rocket, flight number D313, flying in the 7925-9.5 configuration.&lt;ref name="LL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/launchlog.txt|title=Launch Log|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch took place from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 17|Space Launch Complex 17A]] at the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]],&lt;ref name="lvdb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/lvdb/list2.html|title=Launch List|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|work=Launch Vehicle Database|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and placed USA-183 into a transfer orbit. The satellite raised itself into [[medium Earth orbit]] using a [[Star-37FM]] [[apogee motor]].&lt;ref name="GSP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/navstar-2rm.htm|title=GPS-2RM (Navstar-2RM)|first=Gunter|last=Krebs|work=Gunter's Space Page|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 25 November 2005, USA-183 was in an orbit with a [[apsis|perigee]] of {{convert|20140|km}}, an [[apsis|apogee]] of {{convert|20222|km}}, a [[orbital period|period]] of 717.92 minutes, and 55 degrees of [[inclination]] to the equator.&lt;ref name="satcat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/satcat.txt|title=Satellite Catalog|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to broadcast the PRN 17 signal, and operates in slot 4 of plane C of the GPS constellation. The satellite has a mass of {{convert|2032|kg}}, and a design life of 10 years.&lt;ref name="GSP"/&gt; As of 2012 it remains in service.

'''Äbädä''' ({{lang-tt|Әбәдә}}; {{lang-az|Əbədə}}; {{lang-tr|Ebede}}) is an innocent forest spirit in [[Tatar mythology]]. It looks like an old woman. '''Äbädä''' also is represented in mythologies of [[Siberian]] peoples.

Äbädä is a demon or spirit. He is a Turkic forest being, similar in nature to the [[İye]]s. He protects the birds, trees, and animals of the forest; he appears in the shape of a human with blue skin, two great horns, green hair, and a long green beard across his face, carrying a club or whip indicating his mastery of the forest.
He can shapeshift into many different forms. As a human, he looks like a peasant with glowing eyes, and his shoes are on backwards. Should one ever encounter an Äbädä, one must thwart him immediately by turning all one's clothes inside out and backwards, and placing one's shoes on the opposite feet.
