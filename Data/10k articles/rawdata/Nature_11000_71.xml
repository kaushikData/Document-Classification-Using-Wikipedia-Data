'''''Adam and Eve''''' is a  double painting by German Renaissance master [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], dating from 1528,&lt;ref&gt;As it can be seen in Adam's panel.&lt;/ref&gt; housed in the Uffizi, Florence, Italy.
There are other paintings by the same artist with the same title, for instance at the [[Museum der bildenden Künste]] in [[Leipzig]] and the [[Art Institute of Chicago]].

The two biblical ancestors are portrayed, in two different panels, on a dark background, standing on a barely visible ground. Both hold two small branches which cover their sexual organs. Eve holds the traditional apple, with the snake coming to her from above from the [[Tree of life (biblical)|tree of life]]. Adam is shown scratching the right crown part of his scalp.

==History==
The work was part of the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Tuscan Grand Dukes']] collections since as early as 1688, and has been included in the Uffizi since the beginning of the 18th century. [[Filippo Baldinucci]] attributed it to [[Albrecht Dürer]], until the inventory of 1784 assigned it to Cranach.

The subject continues Dürer's anatomy studies, which had culminated in his  large ''[[Adam and Eve (Dürer)|Adam and Eve]]'' panels now in the [[Museo del Prado]]. These were the first full-size nudes painted by a German artist. During his stay in [[Vienna]], Cranach had frequented some groups of humanists who were close to Dürer, and from there he was inspired to do a first, smaller version of the theme of [[Adam and Eve]] in 1510, currently housed at the [[National Museum in Warsaw]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4530">The '''Aharonov–Casher effect''' is a [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] phenomenon predicted in 1984 in which a traveling [[magnetic dipole]] is affected by an [[electric field]]. It is [[Duality (electricity and magnetism)|dual]] to the [[Aharonov–Bohm effect]], in which the quantum phase of a charged particle depends upon which side of a magnetic flux tube it comes through. In the Aharonov–Casher effect, the particle has a magnetic moment and the tubes are charged instead.  It was observed in a gravitational neutron inferometer in 1989(Cimmino et al.) and later by fluxon interference of magnetic vortices in Josephson junctions (Elion et al.).  It has also been seen with electrons and atoms.

In both effects the particle acquires a phase shift (&lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;) while traveling along some path ''P''. In the Aharonov–Bohm effect it is

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi_{AB} = \frac{q}{\hbar} \int_P \mathbf{A} \cdot d\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;

While for the Aharonov–Casher effect it is

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi_{AC} = \frac{1}{\hbar c^2} \int_P (\mathbf{E}\times \boldsymbol \mu) \cdot d\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is its charge and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol \mu&lt;/math&gt; is the magnetic moment.  The effects have been observed together(Bogachek and [[Uzi Landman|Landman]]).

The '''Alaska Volcano Observatory''' ('''AVO''') is a joint program of the [[United States Geological Survey]], the [[Geophysical Institute]] of the [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]], and the [[Government of Alaska|State of Alaska]] Division of Geological and Geophysical Surveys (ADGGS).&lt;ref&gt;[http://dggs.alaska.gov dggs.alaska.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; AVO was formed in 1988, and uses [[Government of the United States|federal]], state, and university resources to monitor and study [[Alaska]]'s [[volcanology]], hazardous [[volcano]]es, to predict and record eruptive activity, and to mitigate volcanic hazards to life and property. The Observatory website allows users to monitor active volcanoes, with [[seismographs]] and [[webcamera]]s that update regularly. AVO now monitors more than 20 volcanoes in [[Cook Inlet]], which is close to Alaskan population centers, and the [[Aleutian Arc]] due to the hazard that plumes of ash pose to aviation.&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avo.alaska.edu/about/|title=Alaska Volcano Observatory |date=October 24, 2000|work=About|publisher=Alaska Volcano Observatory |accessdate=31 January 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100208205919/http://www.avo.alaska.edu/about/| archivedate= 8 February 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ammonium perfluorononanoate''' ('''APFN''') is an anionic [[surfactant]] that in water forms liquid crystalline phases ([[Lyotropic liquid crystal]]). It is the [[ammonium]] [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] of [[perfluorononanoic acid]].

The phase diagram of APFN/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O system is delineated by the presence of a lamellar phase and a nematic phase with awide isotropic solution. The nematic phase is of the type I, and the aggregates have a positive and diamagnetic anisotropy. In the presence of a magnetic field, the aggregates align parallel to the field direction. The change of phase at the lamellar-nematic temperature has been ascribed to [[order-disorder transition]]s.

==MLV Formation==
It has recently been shown that the lamellar phase of the APFN/2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O system form multilamellar [[vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicles]] under [[shear rate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/la102887e | title = Evidence of Formation of Ammonium Perfluorononanoate/&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O Multilamellar Vesicles: Morphological Analysis by Rheology and Rheo-&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR Experiments | year = 2010 | last1 = Coppola | first1 = Luigi | last2 = Gentile | first2 = Luigi | last3 = Nicotera | first3 = Isabella | last4 = Rossi | first4 = Cesare Oliviero | last5 = Ranieri | first5 = Giuseppe Antonio | journal = Langmuir | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 19060–5 | pmid = 21073179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ann Haven Morgan''' (born "Anna" May 6, 1882 &amp;ndash; June 5, 1966) was an American zoologist and ecologist.

One of three offspring of Stanley G. Morgan and Julia A. Douglass Morgan, Anna Morgan was born in [[Waterford, Connecticut]] and attended [[Williams Memorial Institute]] in [[New London, Connecticut]]. In 1902, Anna joined [[Wellesley College]] then transferred to [[Cornell University]]. After receiving a B.A in 1906, she worked as an assistant and instructor for the [[Mount Holyoke College]] department of zoology until 1909. At Cornell University, she was awarded a Ph.D. in 1912 with a dissertation titled, ''A Contribution to the Biology of the May-fly'',&lt;ref name=aesa6_3_371/&gt; after which she became a professor at [[Mount Holyoke College]]. Morgan became an associate professor in 1914, then a full professor in 1918. From 1916&amp;ndash;1947 she was the chair of the Mount Holyoke zoology department, serving until she retired. During this period, in the summer months she also taught marine zoology at the Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratory. She died of stomach cancer in [[South Hadley, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=holyoke/&gt;&lt;ref name=ogilvie_harvey2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=sicherman_green1980/&gt;&lt;ref name=oakes2007/&gt;

Her research and instruction focused on limnology, animal hibernation, and ecological and environmental issues. She authored three books on zoology. The 1933 edition of ''American Men of Science'' listed her along with two other women among the 250 total entries.&lt;ref name=holyoke/&gt; She was awarded research fellowships from the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] and the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref name=oakes2007/&gt;

'''Atomism''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἄτομον}}, ''atomon'', i.e. "uncuttable, indivisible")&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)/tomos|ἄτομον|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= atom|url= http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=atom&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|publisher= [[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The term 'atomism' is recorded in English since 1670–80 (''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]'', 2001, "atomism").&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[natural philosophy]] that developed in several ancient traditions. 

References to the concept of atomism and its atoms appeared in both [[Ancient Greek philosophy|ancient Greek]] and [[Ancient Indian philosophy|ancient Indian]] philosophical traditions. The ancient Greek atomists theorized that nature consists of two fundamental [[Principle (philosophy)|principles]]: ''atom'' and [[Void (philosophy)|''void'']]. Unlike their modern scientific namesake in [[atomic theory]], philosophical atoms come in an infinite variety of shapes and sizes, each indestructible, immutable and surrounded by a void where they collide with the others or hook together forming a cluster. Clusters of different shapes, arrangements, and positions give rise to the various macroscopic [[Substance (philosophy)|substances]] in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]], ''Metaphysics'' I, 4, 985&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; 10&amp;ndash;15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SEP"&gt;Berryman, Sylvia, "Ancient Atomism", ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' (Fall 2008 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/atomism-ancient/ online]&lt;/ref&gt;

The particles of [[chemical matter]] for which [[chemists]] and other natural philosophers of the early 19th century found experimental evidence were thought to be indivisible, and therefore were given{{by whom?|date=August 2018}} the name "atom", long used by the atomist philosophy. Although the connection to historical atomism is at best tenuous, [[elementary particle]]s have become a modern analog of philosophical atoms.

==Reductionism==
Philosophical atomism is a [[reductionism|reductive]] argument: not only that everything is composed of atoms and void, but that nothing they compose really exists: the only things that really exist are atoms ricocheting off each other [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistically]] in an otherwise empty [[Void (philosophy)|void]]. Atomism stands in contrast to a [[substance theory]] wherein a prime material continuum remains qualitatively invariant under division (for example, the ratio of the four [[classical elements]] would be the same in any portion of a homogeneous material).

[[India]]n [[Buddhist]]s, such as [[Dharmakirti]] and others, also developed distinctive theories of atomism, for example, involving momentary (instantaneous) atoms, that flash in and out of existence ([[kalapas]]).

==Antiquity==

===Greek atomism===

In the 5th century BCE, [[Leucippus]] and his pupil [[Democritus]] proposed that all matter was composed of small indivisible particles called atoms.&lt;ref&gt;''The atomists, Leucippus and Democritus: fragments, a text and translation with a commentary'' by C.C.W.

Democritus believed that atoms are too small for human senses to detect, they are infinitely many, they come in infinitely many varieties, and that they have always existed.&lt;ref name="Kenny2004"/&gt; They float in a vacuum, which Democritus called the "[[Void (philosophy)|void]]",&lt;ref name="Kenny2004"/&gt; and they vary in form, order, and posture.&lt;ref name="Kenny2004"/&gt; Some atoms, he maintained, are convex, others concave, some shaped like hooks, and others like eyes.&lt;ref name="Kenny2004"/&gt; They are constantly moving and colliding into each other.&lt;ref name="Kenny2004"/&gt; Democritus wrote that atoms and void are the only things that exist and that all other things are merely said to exist by social convention.&lt;ref name="Kenny2004"/&gt; The objects humans see in everyday life are composed of many atoms united by random collisions and their forms and materials are determined by what kinds of atom make them up.&lt;ref name="Kenny2004"/&gt; Likewise, human perceptions are caused by atoms as well.&lt;ref name="Kenny2004"/&gt; [[Bitter (taste)|Bitterness]] is caused by small, angular, jagged atoms passing across the tongue;&lt;ref name="Kenny2004"/&gt; whereas [[sweetness]] is caused by larger, smoother, more rounded atoms passing across the tongue.&lt;ref name="Kenny2004"/&gt;

Parmenides denied the existence of motion, change and void. He believed all existence to be a single, all-encompassing and unchanging mass (a concept known as [[monism]]), and that change and motion were mere illusions. This conclusion, as well as the reasoning that led to it, may indeed seem baffling to the modern empirical mind, but Parmenides explicitly rejected sensory experience as the path to an understanding of the universe, and instead used purely abstract reasoning. Firstly, he believed there is no such thing as void, equating it with non-being (i.e. "if the void '''''is''''', then it is not nothing; therefore it is not the void"). This in turn meant that motion is impossible, because there is no void to move into.&lt;ref name="From AtomosToAtom"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew G. van Melsen|year=1952|title=From Atomos to Atom|isbn= 978-0486495842|publisher=Dover Publications|location=Mineola, N.Y.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="History of Western Philosophy"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bertrand Russel|year=1946|title=History of Western Philosophy|page=75|isbn=978-0415325059|publisher=Routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote all that ''is'' must be an indivisible unity, for if it were manifold, then there would have to be a void that could divide it (and he did not believe the void exists). Finally, he stated that the all encompassing Unity is unchanging, for the Unity already encompasses all that is and can be.&lt;ref name="FromAtomosToAtomism"&gt;Andrew G. van Melsen. (1952). ''From Atomos to Atom: The History and Concept of the Atom''. Dover Phoenix Editions. {{ISBN|0-486-49584-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Democritus accepted most of Parmenides' arguments, except for the idea that change is an illusion. He believed change was real, and if it was not then at least the illusion had to be explained. He thus supported the concept of void, and stated that the universe is made up of many Parmenidean entities that move around in the void.&lt;ref name="From AtomosToAtom"/&gt; The void is infinite and provides the space in which the atoms can pack or scatter differently. The different possible packings and scatterings within the void make up the shifting outlines and bulk of the objects that organisms feel, see, eat, hear, smell, and taste. While organisms may feel hot or cold, hot and cold actually have no real existence. They are simply sensations produced in organisms by the different packings and scatterings of the atoms in the void that compose the object that organisms sense as being "hot" or "cold".

The work of Democritus only survives in secondhand reports, some of which are unreliable or conflicting. Much of the best evidence of Democritus' theory of atomism is reported by Aristotle in his discussions of Democritus' and Plato's contrasting views on the types of indivisibles composing the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;Berryman, Sylvia, "Democritus", ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' (Fall 2008 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/democritus&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plato]] (c. 427 – c. 347 BCE), if he had been familiar with the atomism of Democritus, would have objected to its [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic]] [[materialism]]. He argued that atoms just crashing into other atoms could never produce the beauty and form of the world. In Plato's ''[[Timaeus (Plato)|Timaeus]]'' &lt;small&gt;(28b–29a)&lt;/small&gt; the character of Timeaus insisted that the [[cosmos]] was not eternal but was created, although its creator framed it after an eternal, unchanging model.

One part of that creation were the four simple bodies of fire, air, water, and earth. But Plato did not consider these [[corpuscularianism|corpuscles]] to be the most basic level of reality, for in his view they were made up of an unchanging level of reality, which was mathematical. These simple bodies were [[Platonic solid|geometric solids]], the faces of which were, in turn, made up of triangles. The square faces of the cube were each made up of four [[Triangle#Types of triangle|isosceles right-angled triangles]] and the triangular faces of the tetrahedron, octahedron, and icosahedron were each made up of six right-angled triangles.

He postulated the geometric structure of the simple bodies of the four elements as summarized in the adjacent table. The cube, with its flat base and stability, was assigned to earth; the tetrahedron was assigned to fire because its penetrating points and sharp edges made it mobile. The points and edges of the octahedron and icosahedron were blunter and so these less mobile bodies were assigned to air and water. Since the simple bodies could be decomposed into triangles, and the triangles reassembled into atoms of different elements, Plato's model offered a plausible account of changes among the primary substances.&lt;ref name="lloyd:early:74"&gt;{{cite book

====Rejection in Aristotelianism====
Sometime before 330 BCE [[Aristotle]] asserted that the elements of fire, air, earth, and water were not made of atoms, but were continuous. Aristotle considered the existence of a void, which was required by atomic theories, to violate physical principles. Change took place not by the rearrangement of atoms to make new structures, but by [[hylomorphism|transformation of matter from what it was in potential to a new actuality]]. A piece of wet clay, when acted upon by a potter, takes on its potential to be an actual drinking mug. Aristotle has often been criticized for rejecting atomism, but in ancient Greece the atomic theories of Democritus remained "pure speculations, incapable of being put to any experimental test. Granted that atomism was, in the long run, to prove far more fruitful than any qualitative theory of matter, in the short run the theory that Aristotle proposed must have seemed in some respects more promising".&lt;ref name="lloyd:aristotle"&gt;{{cite book

''[[Minima naturalia]]'' were theorized by Aristotle as the smallest parts into which a homogeneous natural substance (e.g., flesh, bone, or wood) could be divided and still retain its essential character. Unlike the atomism of Democritus, the Aristotelian "natural minimum" was not conceptualized as physically indivisible. 
Instead, the concept was rooted in Aristotle's [[Hylomorphism|hylomorphic]] worldview, which held that every physical thing is a compound of matter (Greek ''hyle'') and an immaterial [[substantial form]] (Greek ''morphe'') that imparts its essential nature and structure. For instance, a rubber ball for a hylomorphist like Aristotle would be rubber (matter) structured by spherical shape (form).
Aristotle's intuition was that there is some smallest size beyond which matter could no longer be structured as flesh, or bone, or wood, or some other such organic substance that for Aristotle, living before the microscope, could be considered homogeneous. For instance, if flesh were divided beyond its natural minimum, what would be left might be a large amount of the element water, and smaller amounts of the other elements. But whatever water or other elements were left, they would no longer have the "nature" of flesh: in hylomorphic terms, they would no longer be matter structured by the form of flesh; instead the remaining water, e.g., would be matter structured by the form of water, not the form of flesh.

====Later ancient atomism====

[[Epicurus]] (341&amp;ndash;270 BCE) studied atomism with [[Nausiphanes]] who had been a student of Democritus. Although Epicurus was certain of the existence of atoms and the void, he was less sure we could adequately explain specific natural phenomena such as earthquakes, lightning, comets, or the phases of the Moon (Lloyd 1973, 25&amp;ndash;6). Few of Epicurus' writings survive and those that do reflect his interest in applying Democritus' theories to assist people in taking responsibility for themselves and for their own happiness—since he held there are no gods around that can help them. He understood gods' role as moral ideals.

His ideas are also represented in the works of his follower [[Lucretius]], who wrote ''[[On the Nature of Things]]''. This scientific work in poetic form illustrates several segments of Epicurean theory on how the universe came into its current stage and it shows that the phenomena we perceive are actually composite forms. The atoms and the void are eternal and in constant motion. Atomic collisions create objects, which are still composed of the same eternal atoms whose motion for a while is incorporated into the created entity. Human sensations and meteorological phenomena are also explained by Lucretius in terms of atomic motion.

====Atomism and ethics====
Some later philosophers attributed the idea that man created gods and that gods did not create man to Democritus. For example, [[Sextus Empiricus]] noted:

:Some people think that we arrived at the idea of gods from the remarkable things that happen in the world. Democritus ... says that the people of ancient times were frightened by happenings in the heavens such as thunder, lightning, ..., and thought that they were caused by gods.&lt;ref name="taylor:"&gt;{{cite book

Three hundred years after Epicurus, [[Lucretius]] in his epic poem ''[[On the Nature of Things]]'' would depict him as the hero who crushed the monster [[Religion]] through educating the people in what was possible in the atoms and what was ''not'' possible in the atoms. However, Epicurus expressed a non-aggressive attitude characterized by his statement: "The man who best knows how to meet external threats makes into one family all the creatures he can; and those he can not, he at any rate does not treat as aliens; and where he finds even this impossible, he avoids all dealings, and, so far as is advantageous, excludes them from his life."

&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ajivika]] schools of atomism originated as early as the 7th century BCE.&lt;ref name=r79&gt;{{harv|Radhakrishnan|1957|pp= 227–249}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jmk&gt;John M.

The [[Nyaya]] and [[Vaisheshika]] schools later developed theories on how atoms combined into more complex objects.&lt;ref&gt;Richard King, Indian philosophy: an introduction to Hindu and Buddhist thought, Edinburgh University Press, 1999, {{ISBN|0-7486-0954-7}}, pp. 105-107.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of these doctrines of atomism are, in some respects, "suggestively similar" to that of Democritus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Will Durant]] wrote in ''Our Oriental Heritage'' (2011): "Two systems of Indian thought propound physical theories suggestively similar to those of Greece. [[Kanada (philosopher)|Kanada]], founder of the [[Vaisheshika]] philosophy, held that the world was composed of atoms as many in kind as the various elements. The [[Jainism|Jains]] more nearly approximated to [[Democritus]] by teaching that all atoms were of the same kind, producing different effects by diverse modes of combinations. The Vaisheshika]] believed [[light]] and [[heat]] to be varieties of the same substance; [[Udayana]] taught that all heat comes from the sun; and [[Vācaspati Miśra|Vachaspati]], like Newton, interpreted light as composed of minute particles emitted by substances and striking the eye."{{page needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; McEvilley (2002) assumes that such similarities are due to extensive cultural contact and diffusion, probably in either direction.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy D. Popkin (ed.), ''The Legacies of Richard Popkin'' (2008), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=gJZtBiQU6ekC&amp;pg=PA53#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 53].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nyaya]]&amp;ndash;[[Vaisesika]] school developed one of the earliest forms of atomism; scholars{{who|date=March 2018}} date the Nyaya and Vaisesika texts from the 6th to 1st centuries BC.{{cn|date=March 2018}} Vaisesika atomists posited the four elemental atom types, but in Vaisesika physics atoms had 25 different possible qualities, divided between general [[intensive and extensive properties|extensive]] properties and specific (intensive) properties. Like the Jaina school, the Nyaya&amp;ndash;Vaisesika atomists had elaborate theories of how atoms combine. In both Jaina and Vaisesika atomism, atoms first combine in pairs (dyads), and then group into trios of pairs (triads), which are the smallest visible units of matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Lost Discoveries: The Ancient Roots of Modern Science | author = Teresi, Dick | publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster |year=2003 | isbn = 978-0-7432-4379-7 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=pheL_ubbXD0C&amp;dq | pages = 213–214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] atomists had very qualitative, Aristotelian-style atomic theory. According to ancient Buddhist atomism, which probably began developing before the 4th century BCE, there are four kinds of atoms, corresponding to the standard elements. Each of these elements has a specific property, such as solidity or motion, and performs a specific function in mixtures, such as providing support or causing growth. Like the Hindu Jains, the Buddhists were able to integrate a theory of atomism with their theological presuppositions. Later Indian Buddhist philosophers, such as [[Dharmakirti]] and [[Dignāga]], considered atoms to be point-sized, durationless, and made of energy.

Some of canonical texts of [[Jainism]] make reference to matter and atoms (called ''paramāṇu'', a term already used in [[Yajnavalkya]] and [[Yoga Sutra]]), including ''[[Pancastikayasara]]'', ''[[Kalpasutra (Jainism)|Kalpasutra]]'' and ''[[Tattvarthasutra]]''.{{cn|date=March 2018}} The Jains envisioned the world as consisting wholly of atoms, except for souls. Atoms were considered as the basic building blocks of all matter. Each atom had "one kind of taste, one smell, one color, and two kinds of touch", though it is unclear what was meant by "kind of touch".{{cn|date=March 2018}}{{huh|date=March 2018}} Atoms can exist in one of two states: subtle, in which case they can fit in infinitesimally small spaces, and gross, in which case they have extension and occupy a finite space.{{cn|date=March 2018}} The texts also give "detailed theories" of how atoms could combine, react, vibrate, move, and perform other actions, all of which were thoroughly deterministic.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

==Middle Ages==
===Medieval Buddhism===
Medieval Buddhist atomism, flourishing in ca. the 7th century, was very different from the atomist doctrines taught in early [[Samkhya]] Buddhism. Medieval Buddhist philosophers [[Dharmakirti]] and [[Dignāga]] considered atoms to be point-sized, durationless, and made of energy. In discussing the two systems, [[Fyodor Shcherbatskoy]] (1930) stresses their commonality, the postulate of "absolute qualities" (''guna-dharma'') underlying all empirical phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;"The Buddhists denied the existence of substantial matter altogether. Movement consists for them of moments, it is a staccato movement, momentary flashes of a stream of energy... "Everything is evanescent," ... says the Buddhist, because there is no stuff ... Both systems [Sānkhya and later Indian Buddhism] share in common a tendency to push the analysis of Existence up to its minutest, last elements which are imagined as absolute qualities, or things possessing only one unique quality. They are called "qualities" (guna-dharma) in both systems in the sense of absolute qualities, a kind of atomic, or intra-atomic, energies of which the empirical things are composed. Both systems, therefore, agree in denying the objective reality of the categories of Substance and Quality, ... and of the relation of Inference uniting them. There is in Sānkhya philosophy no separate existence of qualities. What we call quality is but a particular manifestation of a subtle entity. To every new unit of quality corresponds a subtle quantum of matter which is called guna "quality", but represents a subtle substantive entity. The same applies to early Buddhism where all qualities are substantive ... or, more precisely, dynamic entities, although they are also called dharmas ("qualities")."
Stcherbatsky (1962 [1930]). Vol. 1. p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Still later, the [[Abhidhammattha-sangaha]], a text dated to the 11th or 12th century, postulates the existence of ''[[rupa-kalapa]]'', imagined as the smallest units of the physical world, of varying  [[Mahābhūta#Buddhism|elementary]] composition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1245/Abhidhammattha-sangaha Abhidhammattha-sangaha], Britannica Online (1998, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Invisible under normal circumstances, the ''rupa-kalapa'' are said to become visible as a result of meditative [[samadhi]].&lt;ref&gt;Shankman, Richard (2008), The Experience of Samadhi: An In-depth Exploration of Buddhist Meditation, Shambhala, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval Islam===
{{See also|Early Islamic philosophy#Atomism|l1=Early Islamic philosophy: Atomism|Alchemy and chemistry in medieval Islam}}

Atomistic philosophies are found very early in [[Islamic philosophy]] and was influenced by earlier Greek and to some extent Indian philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Saeed|first=Abdullah|title=Islamic Thought: An Introduction|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415364096|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Introduction to Islamic Civilization|year=1976|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=49|url=https://books.google.com/?id=M5dTrzVizfAC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=Islamic+atomism+indian+greek#v=onepage&amp;q=Islamic%20atomism%20indian%20greek&amp;f=false|author=Michael Marmura|editor=R. M. Savory|chapter=God and his creation:Two medieval Islamic views}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like both the Greek and Indian versions, Islamic atomism was a charged topic that had the potential for conflict with the prevalent religious orthodoxy,{{citation needed|reason=Abu Bakr Baqallani was an early Atomist and a religious scholar|date=September 2014}} but it was instead more often favoured by orthodox [[Islamic theology|Islamic theologians]]. It was such a fertile and flexible idea that, as in Greece and India, it flourished in some leading schools of Islamic thought.

The most successful form of Islamic atomism was in the [[Asharite]] school of [[Islamic theology]], most notably in the work of the theologian [[al-Ghazali]] (1058&amp;ndash;1111). In Asharite atomism, atoms are the only perpetual, material things in existence, and all else in the world is "accidental" meaning something that lasts for only an instant. Nothing accidental can be the cause of anything else, except perception, as it exists for a moment. Contingent events are not subject to natural physical causes, but are the direct result of God's constant intervention, without which nothing could happen. Thus nature is completely dependent on God, which meshes with other Asharite Islamic ideas on causation, or the lack thereof (Gardet 2001). Al-Ghazali also used the theory to support his theory of [[occasionalism]]. In a sense, the Asharite theory of atomism has far more in common with Indian atomism than it does with Greek atomism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Studies in Arabic versions of Greek texts and in mediaeval science|volume=2|author=[[Shlomo Pines]]|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1986|isbn=978-965-223-626-5|pages=355–6|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other traditions in Islam rejected the atomism of the Asharites and expounded on many Greek texts, especially those of Aristotle. An active school of philosophers in Al-Andalus, including the noted commentator [[Averroes]] (1126&amp;ndash;1198 CE) explicitly rejected the thought of al-Ghazali and turned to an extensive evaluation of the thought of Aristotle. Averroes commented in detail on most of the works of Aristotle and his commentaries became [[Averroism|very influential]] in Jewish and Christian scholastic thought.

===Medieval Christendom===
While Aristotelian philosophy eclipsed the importance of the atomists in late Roman and medieval Europe, their work was still preserved and exposited through commentaries on the works of Aristotle. In the 2nd century, [[Galen]] (AD 129&amp;ndash;216) presented extensive discussions of the Greek atomists, especially Epicurus, in his Aristotle commentaries. According to historian of atomism Joshua Gregory, there was no serious work done with atomism from the time of Galen until [[Pierre Gassendi|Gassendi]] and [[Descartes]] resurrected it in the 17th century; "the gap between these two 'modern naturalists' and the ancient Atomists marked "the exile of the atom" and "it is universally admitted that the Middle Ages had abandoned Atomism, and virtually lost it."

However, although the ancient atomists' works were unavailable, Scholastic thinkers still had Aristotle's critiques of atomism. In [[medieval universities]] there were expressions of atomism. For example, in the 14th century [[Nicholas of Autrecourt]] considered that matter, space, and time were all made up of indivisible atoms, points, and instants and that all generation and corruption took place by the rearrangement of material atoms. The similarities of his ideas with those of [[al-Ghazali]] suggest that Nicholas may have been familiar with Ghazali's work, perhaps through [[Averroes]]' refutation of it (Marmara, 1973&amp;ndash;74).

Although the atomism of Epicurus had fallen out of favor in the centuries of [[Scholasticism]], the ''[[minima naturalia]]'' of [[Aristotelianism]] received extensive consideration. Speculation on ''minima naturalia'' provided philosophical background for the mechanistic philosophy of early modern thinkers such as Descartes, and for the alchemical works of [[Pseudo-Geber|Geber]] and [[Daniel Sennert]], who in turn influenced the [[Corpuscularianism|corpuscularian]] alchemist [[Robert Boyle]], one of the founders of modern chemistry.&lt;ref name="Murdoch2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Emery Murdoch|author2=Christoph Herbert Lüthy |author3=William Royall Newman |title=Late Medieval and Early Modern Corpuscular Matter Theories|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wc97ODIpuH8C&amp;pg=PA101|date=1 January 2001|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-11516-3|pages=91–133|chapter=The Medieval and Renaissance Tradition of Minima Naturalia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chalmers2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Chalmers|title=The Scientist's Atom and the Philosopher's Stone: How Science Succeeded and Philosophy Failed to Gain Knowledge of Atoms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qMsQyBVlkl4C&amp;pg=PA76|date=4 June 2009|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-90-481-2362-9|pages=75–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A chief theme in late Roman and Scholastic commentary on this concept is reconciling ''minima naturalia'' with the general Aristotelian principle of infinite divisibility. Commentators like [[John Philoponus]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]] reconciled these aspects of Aristotle's thought by distinguishing between mathematical and "natural" divisibility. With few exceptions, much of the curriculum in the universities of Europe was based on such Aristotelianism for most of the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Kargon 1966{{page needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Atomist renaissance==
In the 17th century, a renewed interest arose in [[Epicurean]] atomism and [[corpuscularianism]] as a hybrid or an alternative to [[Aristotelian physics]]. The main figures in the rebirth of atomism were [[René Descartes]], [[Pierre Gassendi]], and [[Robert Boyle]], as well as other notable figures.

One of the first groups of atomists in England was a cadre of amateur scientists known as the Northumberland circle, led by [[Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland]] (1564&amp;ndash;1632). Although they published little of account, they helped to disseminate atomistic ideas among the burgeoning scientific culture of England, and may have been particularly influential to [[Francis Bacon]], who became an atomist around 1605, though he later rejected some of the claims of atomism. Though they revived the classical form of atomism, this group was among the scientific avant-garde: the Northumberland circle contained nearly half of the confirmed Copernicans prior to 1610 (the year of Galileo's [[Sidereus Nuncius|''The Starry Messenger'']]). Other influential atomists of late 16th and early 17th centuries include [[Giordano Bruno]], [[Thomas Hobbes]] (who also changed his stance on atomism late in his career), and [[Thomas Hariot]]. A number of different atomistic theories were blossoming in France at this time, as well (Clericuzio 2000).

[[Galileo Galilei]] (1564&amp;ndash;1642) was an advocate of atomism in his 1612, ''Discourse on Floating Bodies'' (Redondi 1969). In ''[[The Assayer]]'', Galileo offered a more complete physical system based on a [[#Corpuscularianism|corpuscular]] theory of matter, in which all phenomena—with the exception of sound—are produced by "matter in motion". Galileo identified some basic problems with Aristotelian physics through his experiments. He utilized a theory of atomism as a partial replacement, but he was never unequivocally committed to it. For example, his experiments with falling bodies and inclined planes led him to the concepts of circular inertial motion and accelerating free-fall. The current Aristotelian theories of impetus and terrestrial motion were inadequate to explain these.  While atomism did not explain the [[law of fall]] either, it was a more promising framework in which to develop an explanation because motion was conserved in ancient atomism (unlike Aristotelian physics).

[[René Descartes]]' (1596&amp;ndash;1650) [[Mechanical explanations of gravitation#Vortex|"mechanical" philosophy]] &lt;!-- Descartes ≠ [[mechanical philosophy]] per se --&gt; of corpuscularism had much in common with atomism, and is considered, in some senses, to be a different version of it. Descartes thought everything physical in the universe to be made of tiny ''vortices'' of matter. Like the ancient atomists, Descartes claimed that sensations, such as taste or temperature, are caused by the shape and size of tiny pieces of matter. The main difference between atomism and Descartes' concept was the existence of the void. For him, there could be no vacuum, and all matter was constantly swirling to prevent a void as corpuscles moved through other matter. Another key distinction between Descartes' view and classical atomism is the [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|mind/body duality]] of Descartes, which allowed for an independent realm of existence for thought, soul, and most importantly, God. Gassendi's concept was closer to classical atomism, but with no atheistic overtone.

[[Pierre Gassendi]] (1592&amp;ndash;1655) was a Catholic priest from France who was also an avid natural philosopher. He was particularly intrigued by the Greek atomists, so he set out to "purify" atomism from its heretical and atheistic philosophical conclusions (Dijksterhius 1969). Gassendi formulated his atomistic conception of [[mechanical philosophy]] partly in response to Descartes; he particularly opposed Descartes' reductionist view that only purely mechanical explanations of physics are valid, as well as the application of geometry to the whole of physics (Clericuzio 2000).

[[Johann Chrysostom Magnenus]] (c. 1590 &amp;ndash; c. 1679) published his ''Democritus reviviscens'' in 1646. Magnenus was the first to arrive at a scientific estimate of the size of an "atom" (i.e. of what would today be called a [[molecule]]).
Measuring how much [[incense]] had to be burned before it could be smelled everywhere in a large church, he calculated the number of molecules in a grain of incense to be of the order 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;, only about one order of magnitude below the actual figure.&lt;ref&gt;Three Klaus Ruedenberg, W. H. Eugen Schwarz, ''Millennia of Atoms and Molecules'' (2013), Chapter 1, pp. 1–45, DOI: 10.1021/bk-2013-1122.ch001.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corpuscularianism===
{{main article|Corpuscularianism}}

[[Corpuscularianism]] is similar to atomism, except that where atoms were supposed to be indivisible, corpuscles could in principle be divided. In this manner, for example, it was theorized that mercury could penetrate into metals and modify their inner structure, a step on the way towards transmutative production of gold. Corpuscularianism was associated by its leading proponents with the idea that some of the properties that objects appear to have are artifacts of the perceiving mind: 'secondary' qualities as distinguished from 'primary' qualities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vernonpratt.com/conceptualisations/d06bl2_1mechanical.htm The Mechanical Philosophy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611053822/http://www.vernonpratt.com/conceptualisations/d06bl2_1mechanical.htm |date=June 11, 2008 }} - Early modern 'atomism' ("corpuscularianism" as it was known)&lt;/ref&gt; Not all corpuscularianism made use of the primary-secondary quality distinction, however. An influential tradition in medieval and early modern alchemy argued that chemical analysis revealed the existence of robust corpuscles that retained their identity in chemical compounds (to use the modern term). [[William R. Newman]] has dubbed this approach to matter theory "chymical atomism," and has argued for its significance to both the mechanical philosophy and to the chemical atomism that emerged in the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;William R. Newman, “The Significance of ‘Chymical Atomism’,” in Edith Sylla and W. R. Newman, eds., ''Evidence and Interpretation: Studies on Early Science and Medicine in Honor of John E. Murdoch'' (Leiden: Brill, 2009), pp. 248-264 and Newman, ''Atoms and Alchemy: Chymistry and the Experimental Origins of the Scientific Revolution'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Corpuscularianism stayed a dominant theory over the next several hundred years and retained its links with [[alchemy]] in the work of scientists such as [[Robert Boyle]] and [[Isaac Newton]] in the 17th century.&lt;ref name="Levere" &gt;{{cite book|last = Levere | first = Trevor, H. | title= Transforming Matter – A History of Chemistry for Alchemy to the Buckyball|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|year=2001| isbn=978-0-8018-6610-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophypages.com/dy/c9.htm Corpuscularianism] - Philosophical Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; It was used by Newton, for instance, in his development of the [[corpuscular theory of light]].
The form that came to be accepted by most English scientists after [[Robert Boyle]] (1627–1692) was an amalgam of the systems of Descartes and Gassendi. In [[The Sceptical Chymist]] (1661), Boyle demonstrates problems that arise from chemistry, and offers up atomism as a possible explanation. The unifying principle that would eventually lead to the acceptance of a hybrid corpuscular–atomism was [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanical philosophy]], which became widely accepted by [[physical sciences]]. &lt;!-- ~~ With Boyle? for sure by the end of the 18th... cite? Despite the problems with atomism, it was clear by the end of the 17th century that it was a better alternative than Aristotelian physics, especially since it was compatible with the [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanical philosophy]]. --&gt;

==Modern atomic theory==
{{Main article|Atomic theory}}

By the late 18th century, the useful practices of engineering and technology began to influence philosophical explanations for the composition of matter. Those who speculated on the ultimate nature of matter began to verify their "thought experiments" with some repeatable [[Scientific demonstration|demonstrations]], when they could.

[[Roger Boscovich]] provided the first general mathematical theory of atomism, based on the ideas of Newton and Leibniz but transforming them so as to provide a programme for atomic physics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lancelot Law Whyte]] Essay on Atomism, 1961, p 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1808, [[John Dalton]] assimilated the known experimental work of many people to summarize the [[empirical evidence]] on the composition of matter. He noticed that distilled water everywhere analyzed to the same elements, [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]]. Similarly, other purified substances decomposed to the same elements in the same proportions by weight.

:Therefore we may conclude that the ultimate particles of all homogeneous bodies are perfectly alike in weight, figure, etc. In other words, every particle of water is like every other particle of water; every particle of hydrogen is like every other particle of hydrogen, etc.

Furthermore, he concluded that there was a unique atom for each element, using [[Lavoisier]]'s definition of an element as a substance that could not be [[analysis|analyzed]] into something simpler.  Thus, Dalton concluded the following.

:Chemical [[chemical analysis|analysis]] and [[Chemical synthesis|synthesis]] go no farther than to the separation of particles one from another, and to their reunion. No new creation or destruction of matter is within the reach of chemical agency. We might as well attempt to introduce a new planet into the solar system, or to annihilate one already in existence, as to create or destroy a particle of hydrogen. All the changes we can produce, consist in separating particles that are in a state of cohesion or combination, and joining those that were previously at a distance.

And then he proceeded to give a list of relative weights in the compositions of several common compounds, summarizing:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webserver.lemoyne.edu/faculty/giunta/dalton.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2003-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030802193611/http://webserver.lemoyne.edu/faculty/giunta/dalton.html |archivedate=2003-08-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:1st. That [[water]] is a binary compound of hydrogen and oxygen, and the relative weights of the two elementary atoms are as 1:7, nearly;

:2nd. That [[ammonia]] is a binary compound of hydrogen and azote [[nitrogen]], and the relative weights of the two atoms are as 1:5, nearly...

Dalton concluded that the fixed proportions of elements by weight suggested that the atoms of one element combined with only a limited number of atoms of the other elements to form the substances that he listed.

Dalton's [[atomic theory]] remained controversial throughout the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Brock(ed) | first = W.H. | title = The Atomic Debates | publisher=Leicester University Press | year = 1967 | page = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst the Law of definite proportion was accepted, the hypothesis that this was due to atoms was not so widely accepted. For example, in 1826 when [[Humphry Davy|Sir Humphry Davy]] presented Dalton the [[Royal Medal]] from the [[Royal Society]], Davy said that the theory only became useful when the atomic conjecture was ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Davy(ed)  | first = J. | title = Collected Works of Sir Humphrey Davy | publisher=Bart. |  page = 93 vol 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Sir Benjamin Collins Brodie, 2nd Baronet|Sir Benjamin Collins Brodie]] in 1866 published the first part of his Calculus of Chemical Operations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Brodie  | first = Sir Benjamin Collins | title = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society | year=1866 | pages =781–859 vol I56 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  as a non-atomic alternative to the Atomic Theory.  He described atomic theory as a 'Thoroughly materialistic bit of joiners work'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Brock(ed)  | first = W.H. | title = The Atomic Debates | publisher=Leicester University Press | year = 1967 | page = 12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander William Williamson|Alexander Williamson]] used his Presidential Address to the London Chemical Society in 1869&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Brock(ed)  | first = W.H. | title = The Atomic Debates | publisher=Leicester University Press | year = 1967 | page = 15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  to defend the Atomic Theory against its critics and doubters. This in turn led to further meetings at which the positivists again attacked the supposition that there were atoms. The matter was finally resolved in Dalton's favour in the early 20th century with the rise of [[atomic physics]].

[[Atomic theory|Atoms and molecules]] had long been theorized as the constituents of matter, and [[Albert Einstein]] published [[Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen|a paper in 1905]] that explained in precise detail how the motion that Brown had observed was a result of the pollen being moved by individual water molecules, making one of his first big contributions to science. This explanation of Brownian motion served as convincing evidence that atoms and molecules exist, and was further verified experimentally by [[Jean Baptiste Perrin|Jean Perrin]] in 1908. Perrin was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1926 "for his work on the discontinuous structure of matter". The direction of the force of atomic bombardment is constantly changing, and at different times the particle is hit more on one side than another, leading to the seemingly random nature of the motion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6034">'''Automated mineralogy''' is a generic term describing a range of [[analytical solution]]s, areas of [[commercial enterprise]], and a growing field of [[scientific research]] and engineering applications involving largely [[automated]] and [[wikt:quantitative|quantitative]] [[analysis]] of [[mineral]]s, [[rock (geology)|rock]]s and man-made materials.

==Technology==
Automated mineralogy analytical solutions are characterised by integrating largely automated measurement techniques based on [[Scanning Electron Microscopy]] (SEM) and [[Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy]] (EDS). Commercially available lab-based solutions include [[QEMSCAN]] and Mineral Liberation Analyzer ([[Mineral Liberation Analyzer|MLA]]) from [[FEI Company]], Mineralogic from [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]], INCAMineral from [[Oxford Instruments]], the TIMA  (Tescan integrated mineral analyzer) from [[TESCAN]] and AMICS from [[Bruker]]. The first oil &amp; gas wellsite solution was launched jointly by [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]] and CGG Veritas in 2011 called RoqSCAN. This was followed approximately 6 months later by the release of QEMSCAN Wellsite by [[FEI Company]].  More recently in 2016, a ruggedized mine site solution for mining and mineral processing was launched by [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]] called MinSCAN.

==Business==
The business of automated mineralogy is concerned with the [[commercialisation]] of the technology and software in terms of development and marketing of integrated solutions. This includes all aspects of: [[Customer service|service]]; [[Maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]]; [[customer support]]; [[R&amp;D]]; [[marketing]] and [[sales]]. Customers of automated mineralogy solutions include: [[laboratory|laboratory facilities]]; [[Mining|mine sites]], [[well sites]], and [[research institute|research institutions]].

==Applications==
Automated mineralogy solutions are applied in a variety of fields requiring statistically reliable, quantitative mineralogical information. These include the following sectors: [[mining]];&lt;ref&gt;Goodall, W.R., Scales, P.J., Butcher, A.R. 2005.

==History of the use of the term==
The first recorded use of the term ''automated mineralogy'' in technical journals can be traced back to seminal papers in the late eighties early nineties describing [[QEMSCAN]] technology and applications.&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, D.,  Gottlieb, P.,  Jackson, R., Wilkie, G., Stewart, P. 1988. Measurement in section of particles of known composition.

''Minerals Engineering'', '''4''', 7-11, 753-762. {{doi|10.1016/0892-6875(91)90063-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term gained significant popularity after it was used to name a new international conference in July 2006.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.min-eng.com/automatedmineralogy06/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ball-bearing Run''' was the nickname of the war-time ''Stockholmsruten'' flight between [[Stockholm Bromma Airport|Stockholm]] and  [[Leuchers]], [[Scotland]] between 1939 and 1945. After 1942 the flight was run by the [[Royal Norwegian Air Force]], but for political reasons &lt;ref&gt;Note: as Norwegian nationals, any aircrew captured by Germany would not have been entitled to the protection of the [[Geneva Conventions]] which only applies to nationals of countries that are at war, Nazi Germany refusing to recognise any of the Allied Governments-in-Exile in London.&lt;/ref&gt; operated as an ordinary [[BOAC|BOAC Flight]], the unarmed aircraft having civilian registration and the Norwegian military crew wearing BOAC uniforms and carrying British passports.&lt;ref&gt;''Speedbird, the complete history of BOAC'' by Robert Higham&lt;/ref&gt;

The  Stockholmsruten was set up by the [[Nygaardsvold's Cabinet|Norwegian Government, exiled in UK]] with the aim of transporting Norwegians having escaped from [[German occupation of Norway|Nazi-occupied Norway]]. Several types of aircraft were used, but the backbone of Stockholmsruten was the [[Lockheed Lodestar]]

Since the aircraft also carried [[ball bearing]]s, of greatest importance to the British war industry, this is how the flight got its nickname in UK.

The service also carried other passengers, one of the most notable being Danish physicist, [[Niels Bohr]], who was flown out in a [[de Havilland Mosquito]] in 1943.

Between 1939 and 1945,  6,000 passengers, and 500,000 tons of freight, were transported by BOAC between Stockholm and Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1945/1945%20-%201929.html|title=southern africa - albert hall - jack savage - 1945 - 1929 - Flight Archive|publisher=|accessdate=7 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Baptism]] has been part of Christianity [[Early Christianity|from the start]], as shown by the many mentions in the [[Acts of the Apostles]] and the [[Pauline epistles]].

==Background in Jewish ritual==
{{Main article|Ritual washing in Judaism|Mikvah}}
Although the term "baptism" is not today used to describe the Jewish rituals (in contrast to New Testament times, when the Greek word ''baptismos'' did indicate Jewish ablutions or rites of purification),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VrvAZtYi-3cC&amp;pg=PA139 | first = John | last = MacArthur | title = Hebrews: New Testament Commentary | publisher = Moody | year = 1983 | ISBN = 978-0-8024-0753-5 | page = 139}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8mklAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%2B%22baptismos%22+jewish | first1 = Tremper | last1 = Longman | first2 = David E | last2 = Garland | title = The Expositor's Bible Commentary: Hebrews-Revelation | publisher = Zondervan | year = 2006 | ISBN = 978-0-310-26894-9 | page = 61}}&lt;/ref&gt; the purification rites (or ''mikvah''—ritual immersion) in [[Halakha|Jewish law]] and tradition have some similarity to baptism, and the two have been linked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.theabrahamproject.com/resources/glossary-christian.html | last= Stoltz | first= Eric | title = A Christian Glossary: Baptism |publisher=The Abraham Project |year= 2005 |accessdate= February 25, 2009}}{{Unreliable source?|date=March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=222&amp;letter=B&amp;search=baptism | title = Jewish Encyclopedia | contribution = Baptism | quote = The only conception of Baptism at variance with Jewish ideas is displayed in the declaration of John, that the one who would come after him would not baptize with water, but with the Holy Ghost (Mark i. 8; John i. 27).}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Hebrew Bible]] and other Jewish texts, immersion in water for [[ritual purification]] was established for restoration to a condition of "ritual purity" in specific circumstances. For example, [[Jew]]s who (according to the [[Torah|Law of Moses]]) became ritually defiled by contact with a corpse had to use the mikvah before being allowed to participate in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]. Immersion was not required for [[Ger tzedek|converts to Judaism]] as part of their conversion, although many mistakenly believe otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/gill/practical.vi.i.html|title=Body of Practical Divinity - Christian Classics Ethereal Library|website=www.ccel.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immersion in the mikvah represents a change in status in regards to purification, restoration, and qualification for full religious participation in the life of the community, ensuring that the cleansed person will not impose uncleanness on property or its owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Num.|19|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Babylonian Talmud]], [[Mishnah|Tractate]] ''[[Hagigah|Chagigah]]'', p.&amp;nbsp;12&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Testament==
The [[New Testament]] includes several references to baptism as an important practice among early Christians and, while giving no actual account of its institution by Jesus, portrays him as giving instructions, after his [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]], for his followers to perform the rite (see [[Great Commission]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = Baptism | year = 2009 | title = Encyclopædia Britannica | accessdate = May 21, 2009 | edition = online | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/52311/Baptism}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also gives interpretations by the [[Apostle Paul]] and in the [[First Epistle of Peter]] of the significance of baptism.
{{Quote | Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of '''water and the Spirit''', he cannot enter the kingdom of God | John 3:5 RSV}}
{{Quote | Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her, that he might sanctify her '''by the washing of water with the word''', that he might present the church to himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and without blemish. | Ephesians 5:25–27 RSV}}
{{Quote | God's patience waited in the days of Noah, during the building of the ark, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were saved through water. '''Baptism''', which corresponds to this, '''now saves you''' | 1 Peter 3:20–21 RSV}}

===Baptism of Jesus===
{{Main article|Baptism of Jesus}}
[[File:Piero, battesimo di cristo 04.jpg|thumb|''The [[Baptism of Christ (Piero della Francesca)|Baptism of Christ]]'', 1450 ([[National Gallery, London]]).]]
The baptism of Jesus is described in the [[gospel]]s of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]]. [[Gospel of John|John's gospel]] does not directly describe [[Jesus]]' baptism.

[[John the Baptist]] was a 1st-century mission preacher on the banks of the River Jordan.{{Sfn | Cross | Livingstone | 2005 | loc = ‘John the Baptist’}}{{Page needed| date= August 2010}} He baptized Jews for repentance in the River Jordan.{{Sfn | Funk | 1998 | p = 268, ‘John the Baptist’}}

At the start of his ministry, [[Baptism of Jesus|Jesus was baptized]] by John the Baptist. Critical scholars broadly agree that the baptism of Jesus is one of the most authentic, or historically likely, events in the life of the [[historical Jesus]].{{cn|date=July 2017}} Christian baptism has its origin in the baptism of Jesus, in both a direct and historical sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first=Herman |last= Lichtenberger |chapter= Syncretistic Features in Jewish and Jewish-Christian Baptism Movements |chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=9zCh9SBb6Y8C#PPA85 |editor-link = James Dunn (theologian) | editor-first = James DG | editor-last = Dunn |title=Jews and Christians: The Parting of the Ways, AD 70 to 135 | publisher =[[William B.

===Baptism by Jesus===
The [[Gospel of John]]{{bibleref2c|Jn|3:22-30}} {{bibleref2c-nb|Jn|4:1-4}} states that Jesus at an early stage led a mission of baptism that drew crowds. {{bibleref2|John|4:2}}, considered by many scholars to be a later editorial insertion,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., the summary of such opinions by {{Citation | first = Raymond E | last = Brown | chapter = The Gospel according to John (i–xii): Introduction, translation, and notes | edition = 2nd | title = The Anchor Bible | volume = 29 | place = Garden City, NY | publisher = Doubleday | year = 1966 | pages = 164–65, 188–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; denies that Jesus himself baptized and states that he did so only through his disciples.

Some prominent scholars conclude that Jesus did not baptize. [[Gerd Theissen]] and [[Annette Merz]] assert that Jesus did not baptize, detached the notion of repentance from baptism, recognized John's baptism, and put forward a purity ethic in tension with baptism.&lt;ref name="TM1998"&gt;{{Cite book| first1 =Gerd |last1 =Theissen |author1-link= Gerd Theissen | first2= Annette | last2 = Merz| title= The Historical Jesus: A Comprehensive Guide | publisher= Fortress Press | location=Minneapolis |year=1998 |pages=209, 377|isbn=0-8006-3122-6 |oclc=38590348}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Oxford Dictionary of World Religions'' also states that Jesus did not baptize as part of his ministry.&lt;ref name="ODWR"&gt;{{Cite book |first= John |last=Bowker |authorlink= John Bowker (theologian) |title= The [[Oxford Dictionary of World Religions]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=[[Oxford]] |year= 1999 |isbn= 0-19-866242-4 |oclc = 60181672}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}

[[Robert W. Funk]] considers the account of Jesus' baptism ministry in John to have internal difficulties: that, for instance, it reports Jesus coming to Judea even though he is already in Jerusalem and thus in Judea.{{Sfn | Funk | 1998 | pp = 365–440, ‘John’}}{{Page needed | date = March 2014}}  {{Bibleref2|John|3:22|NIV}} actually speaks of Jesus and his disciples coming, not "εἰς τὴν Ἰουδαίαν" (into Judea), but "εἰς τὴν Ἰουδαίαν γῆν" (into the Judean countryside),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6JYgc2iH_skC | first = Colin G | last = Kruse | title = The Gospel according to John: an Introduction and Commentary | publisher = William B Eerdmans | year = 2004 | page = 119}}&lt;/ref&gt; which some interpret as contrasted with Jerusalem, the scene of the encounter with Nicodemus described immediately before.{{Sfn | Dapaah | 2005 | p = 98}}  According to the Jesus Seminar, the passage about Jesus "coming to Judea" (as they interpret "εἰς τὴν Ἰουδαίαν γῆν") to lead a mission of baptism probably preserves no historical information (a "black" rating).{{Sfn | Funk | 1998 | pp = 365–440}}{{Page needed |date=March 2014}}

On the other hand, the Cambridge Companion to Jesus{{Sfn | Bockmuel | 2001 | p = 27}} takes a different view. According to this source, Jesus accepted and made his own John the Baptist's message of repentance, forgiveness and baptism;{{Sfn | Tomson | 2001 | p =27}} taking over from John, when the latter was imprisoned, he called for repentance and for baptism as a first step in accepting the imminent [[Kingdom of God]];{{Sfn | Bockmuel | 2001 | p = 40}} and the central place of baptism in his message is confirmed by the passage in John about Jesus baptizing.{{Sfn | Bockmuel | 2001 | p = 30}}  After John's execution, Jesus ceased baptizing, through he may have occasionally returned to the practice; accordingly, while baptism played an important part in Jesus' ministry before John's death and again among his followers after his resurrection, it had no such prominence in between.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Bruce |last=Chilton |chapter = Friends and enemies | chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=vSehrtQpcYcC&amp;pg=PA25 | title = The Cambridge Companion to Jesus |editor-first =Markus | editor-last = Bockmuehl |location=[[Cambridge]] |publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2001 |page=75 |isbn= 0-521-79678-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Testament scholar [[Raymond E. Brown]], a specialist in the Johannine writings, considers that the parenthetic editorial remark of {{bibleref2|John|4:2}} that Jesus baptized only through his disciples was intended to clarify or correct the twice repeated statement in the preceding verses that Jesus did baptize, and that the reason for its insertion may have been that the author considered the baptism that the disciples administered to be a continuation of the Baptist's work, not baptism in the Holy Spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=JIM0Q0bjgYkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=raymond+brown+gospel+of+john | first = Raymond Edward | last = Brown | title = The Gospel and Epistles of John: a Concise Commentary | page = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other New Testament scholars also accept the historical value of this passage in John. This is the view expressed by [[Joel B. Green]], [[Scot McKnight]], [[I.

In his book on the relationship between John the Baptist and Jesus of Nazareth, [[Daniel S. Dapaah]] says that John's account "may be a snippet of historical tradition", and comments that the silence of the Synoptic Gospels does not mean that the information in John was invented, and that Mark's account also suggests that Jesus worked with John at first, before moving to Galilee.{{Sfn | Dapaah | 2005 | pp = 7, 98 | ps =: ‘We propose to defend the historicity of this piece of Johannine material. We shall argue that the Johannine evidence of Jesus' baptizing activity may be a snippet of historical tradition, as there is no discernible theological agenda behind that piece of information. Moreover, the synoptists' silence may be explained, among others, by the supposition that the Evangelists were embarrassed by the event and that reference to the rite was unnecessary in a baptizing church […] The absence of Jesus' baptizing ministry in the synoptic Gospels does not mean that the Johannine detail is not authentic, neither does it suggest that the synoptists invented the story that John was out of action when Jesus arrived on the scene.({{bibleref2|Mark|1:14}} and par) The Marcan tradition, for example, which is chronologically earlier than the Fourth Gospel, suggests that Jesus was so close to John that Jesus moved to Galilee to embark on an independent ministry when John was imprisoned. It appears that John and Jesus initially worked together, an event which the Fourth Evangelist makes explicit’}}  [[Frederick J. Cwiekowski]] agrees that the account in John "gives the impression" that Jesus baptized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first= Frederick J |last= Cwiekowski |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=qcD1RNNaKwsC | title = The Beginnings of the Church | publisher = Paulist Press | year = 1988 | page = 55 | quote = This text from the fourth gospel gives the impression that when John was no longer at Bethany (Jn 3:23; cf. 1:28) Jesus— accompanied by former disciples of John—— was himself in the Jordan area conducting a ministry of baptism.

The [[Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible]] says that "though ''he'' [Christ] himself baptized not ''so many as'' his disciples; 'For he suffered them for an example, preferring one another.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Center place | url = http://www.centerplace.org/hs/iv/iv-joh.htm | first = Joseph | last = Smith | title = Translation of the Bible | chapter = St. John Chapter 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gospel of John remarks, in {{bibleref2|John|3:32}}, that, though Jesus drew many people to his baptism, they still did not accept his testimony,{{Sfn | Dapaah | 2005 | p = 97}} and the [[Jesus Seminar]] concludes, on the basis of Josephus's accounts, that John the Baptist likely had a larger presence in the public mind than Jesus.{{Sfn | Funk | 1998 | p = 268, ‘John the Baptist’}}

===Paul's epistles===
{{Main article |Pauline epistles}}
{{See also|Ex opere operato}}
In the [[Pauline epistles]] baptism effects and represents the believer's union with Christ, a union by which the believer shares in Christ's death and resurrection;{{bibleref2c |Rom|6:3–4|KJV|Rom 6:3–4}} cleanses of sin;{{bibleref2c |1Cor|6:11|KJV|1 Cor 6:11}} incorporates into the [[Body of Christ]] and makes one "drink of the Spirit."{{bibleref2c |1Cor|12:13|KJV|1 Cor 12:13}}{{Sfn | Cross | Livingstone | 2005 | pp = 151–54, ‘Baptism’}}

The conception of a sacramental principle, widespread not only in the Greco-Roman world, but even in pre-Columbian America and in preliterate societies, took on a unique significance, and to Paul's influence is attributed an interpretation given to the Christian rite in terms of the [[Greco-Roman mysteries]]&lt;ref name = sacrament&gt;{{Citation | contribution = Sacrament | year = 2009 | title = Encyclopædia Britannica | accessdate = May 21, 2009 | edition = Online | url =  http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/515366/sacrament}}&lt;/ref&gt; but little weight can be attached to the counterparts of baptism in mystery religions as an explanation of the Christian practice.{{Sfn | Cross | Livingstone | 2005 | pp = 151–54, ‘Baptism’}}

===Gospel of Matthew===

Matthew{{Efn | '''''Matthew''''' is listed first in every complete (undamaged) [[extant literature|extant]] [[Biblical canon#Christian canons|canon]] of the New Testament scriptures of the first five centuries CE, hence the ''two-millennia-old'' tradition of presenting the Gospel of Matthew first in the order of the books in the Christian New Testament, a usage preserved today by every major Christian denomination and by every major Bible book printer and publisher world-wide. It is first here in accordance with tradition. Nevertheless, some scholars dispute the primacy of the Gospel of Matthew.}} begins with the "generation" of Jesus as Son of David, followed by the visit of the gentile [[Magi]], and the [[flight into Egypt]] to escape [[Herod the Great|Herod]], after whose death the [[holy family]] returns into the [[land of Israel]], then moves to [[Nazareth]], and then includes a detailed version of the preaching of John the Baptist, followed by the baptism of Jesus.{{Bibleref2c |Mt|3:11–15}}  John protests to Jesus that he needs to be baptized by Jesus, but Jesus tells him to let it be so now, saying that it is fitting for the two of them ("for us") to thus "fulfill all righteousness." When Jesus is baptized, he goes up immediately out of the water, the heavens open and John sees the Spirit of God descend upon him like a dove, alighting on him, and he hears a voice from heaven say, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased."

Later, at the request of the mother of James and John, who prompted her to present their request to him to declare that they are to sit one at his right hand and the other at his left, Jesus speaks of the "cup" he is to drink{{Bibleref2c-nb |Mt|20:20–23}}, and he tells them that they too will drink of his cup, but in Matthew's gospel Jesus does not ''explicitly'' state that the baptism with which he must be baptized is also the "cup" that he must drink.

The Gospel of Matthew also includes the most famous version of the Great Commission.{{Bibleref2c-nb|Mt|28:18–20}} Here, the resurrected Jesus appears to the apostles and commissions them to make disciples of all nations, to baptize, and teach.{{Sfn | Funk | 1998 | pp = 129–270, ‘Matthew’}}{{Page needed | date = March 2014}} This commission reflects the program adopted by the infant Christian movement.{{Sfn | Funk | 1998 | pp = 129–270, ‘Matthew’}}{{Page needed | date = March 2014}}

John says of Jesus that he will baptize not with water but [[Baptism with the Holy Spirit|with the Holy Spirit]]. At Jesus' baptism, he hears God's voice proclaiming him to be his Son, and he sees the spirit like a dove descend on him.

During Jesus' ministry, when James and John ask Jesus for seats of honor in the coming kingdom{{Bibleref2c-nb |Mark|10:35–39}}, Jesus likens his fate to the cup that he will drink and to the baptism with which he must be baptized, the very cup and baptism in store for John and James (that is, martyrdom).&lt;ref name="Harris John"&gt;{{Citation | author-link = Stephen L Harris| last = Harris | first = Stephen L | title = Understanding the Bible | place = Palo Alto | publisher = Mayfield | year = 1985 | chapter = John | pages = 302–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mark 16#Mark 16:9–20 in the manuscripts and patristic evidence|traditional ending of Mark]] is thought to have been compiled early in the 2nd century, and initially appended to the gospel by the middle of that century.&lt;ref name="May Metzger Mark"&gt;{{Cite book| first1 = Herbert Gordon |last1 = May | first2 = Bruce | last2 = Metzger | author2-link = Bruce Metzger | title=The New Oxford Annotated Bible with the Apocrypha|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location = [[Oxford]] |year=1977 |pages=1213–39 |isbn=0-19-528348-1|oclc=3145429}}&lt;/ref&gt; It says that those who believe '''''and''''' are baptized will be saved, "but he who does not believe will be condemned."{{Bibleref2c |Mk|16:9–20}} Mark's gospel does not ''explicitly'' state that baptized persons who believe will be saved from the "wrath to come," the wrath to which John the Baptist refers in Matthew's gospel{{Bibleref2c-nb|Mt|3:7–10}}, but readers can [[inference|infer]] that being "condemned" includes the "wrath to come".

===Gospel of Luke===
; {{Bibleref2|Luke|3:21–22}}; {{Bibleref2|Luke|24:45–47}}
This gospel begins with a statement that it contains reliable information obtained directly from the original eyewitnesses and servants of the word{{Bibleref2c-nb|Luke|1:1–4}}. It introduces the conception of John the Baptist, the annunciation of [[Gabriel]] to [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] the [[virgin]], the birth of the Baptist who will be called the [[prophet]] of the Most High, and then the birth of Jesus, in the days of Herod, [[king]] of Judea, and of [[Augustus|Caesar Augustus]], [[emperor]] of the Roman Empire. There follows the account of Jesus in the Temple among the [[Zugot|teachers]]; and then the calling and preaching of the prophet John the Baptist in the days of Tiberius Caesar, emperor, of Herod and Philip, [[Tetrarchy (Judea)|tetrarchs]], of Annas and Caiaphas, [[Kohen Gadol|high priests]]; and then by far the ''briefest account'' in the canonical Gospels of the baptism of Jesus{{Bibleref2c-nb |Luke|3:1–22}}.

The baptism of John is ''different'' from the baptism of the one who is to come after him{{Bibleref2c-nb |Luke|3:3}}{{Bibleref2c-nb |Luke|3:16}}. Jesus declares later that he has ''another'' baptism to be baptized with, and that he is under [[Law of Obligation#Definition of an obligation|constraint]] (he is straitened&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = Straitened | contribution-url = http://www.eliyah.com/cgi-bin/strongs.cgi?file=greeklexicon&amp;isindex=4912 | publisher = Eliyah | title = Greek lexicon}}&lt;/ref&gt;) until it is accomplished{{Bibleref2c-nb|Luke|12:50}}. (The petition of the mother of James and John, the personal request of James and John, and Jesus' declaration to them that they will be baptized as he will be baptized, and will drink the cup that he will drink, is not in Luke's gospel.)

In the Gospel of Luke, the risen Jesus appears to the disciples and the eleven apostles gathered together with them in Jerusalem and gives them the Great Commission{{Bibleref2c-nb |Luke|24:45–47}} without ''explicitly'' speaking of baptism, but readers can infer that "the forgiveness of sins" here includes "baptism" according to the preaching of the apostles at the time of Luke's gospel.

===Gospel of John===
The [[Gospel of John]] mentions John the Baptist's baptizing activity,{{bibleref2c-nb |John|1:24-28}}{{bibleref2c-nb |John|3:22–23}} {{bibleref2c-nb |John|10:40–41}} in particular his baptism of Jesus,{{bibleref2c-nb |John|1:15}}, and his statement that Jesus would baptize with the Holy Spirit.{{bibleref2c-nb|John|1:29-34}} It also mentions baptizing activity by Jesus,{{bibleref2c-nb|John|3:25–30}} specifying that the baptizing was not done by Jesus himself but by his disciples.{{bibleref2c-nb |John|4:1–3}}

Some references to water in John's Gospel have been interpreted as referring to baptism, in particular, the phrase "born of water and the Spirit"{{bibleref2c-nb|John|3:2–9}} and the account of blood and water coming out of the side of Jesus when pierced after crucifixion{{bibleref2c-nb |John|19:31–37}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|quote=The blood and water that flowed from the pierced side of the crucified Jesus are types of Baptism and the Eucharist, the sacraments of new life.

In Acts, the prerequisites of baptism are faith and repentance, but in certain cases (like Cornelius' household) the reception of the Spirit also precedes baptism.{{Sfn | Cross | Livingstone | 2005 | pp = 151–54, ‘Baptism’}}

Also in Acts, some twelve men who had undergone John's baptism, a "baptism of repentance" that John administered, "telling the people to believe in the one who was to come after him, that is, Jesus", were baptized "in the name of the Lord Jesus", whereupon they received the Holy Spirit.{{bibleref2c-nb|Acts|19:1–7}}

{{bibleref2 |Acts|2:38}}, {{bibleref2|Acts|10:48}} and {{bibleref2|Acts|19:5}} speak of baptism "in the name of Jesus" or "in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ", but whether this was a formula that was used has been questioned.{{Sfn | Cross | Livingstone | 2005 | pp = 151–54, ‘Baptism’}}

==Early Christianity==
{{Main article|Early Christianity}}

===Theology===
The theology of baptism attained precision in the 3rd and 4th centuries.&lt;ref name="ODWR" /&gt; While instruction was at first given after baptism, believers were given increasingly specific instructions before being baptized, especially in the face of heresies in the 4th century.&lt;ref name = "catechumen" /&gt; By the 4th and 5th centuries, a series of rites spread over several weeks led up to the actual baptism at [[Easter]]: [[catechumens]] attended several meetings of intensive [[catechetical]] instruction, often by the [[bishop]] himself, and often accompanied by special prayers, [[Exorcism in Christianity|exorcism]]s, and other rites.{{Sfn | Old | 1992 | p = 3}}  Catechumens recited the Creed on [[Holy Saturday]] to show that they had completed their catechetical instruction.{{Sfn | Old | 1992 | p = 7}}  At dawn following the [[Paschal Vigil]] starting the night of Holy Saturday, they were taken to the [[baptistry]] where the bishop [[holy water|consecrated the water]] with a long prayer recounting the types of baptisms. The catechumens disrobed, were anointed with oil, renounced the devil and his works, confessed their faith in the Trinity, and were immersed in the font. They were then anointed with [[chrism]], received the [[Christian laying on of hands|laying on of hands]], clothed in white, and led to join the congregation in the Easter celebration.{{Sfn | Old | 1992 | p = 3}}  By then, postponement of baptism had become general, and a large proportion of believers were merely [[catechumen]]s ([[Constantine I and Christianity|Constantine]] was not baptized until he was dying); but as baptisms of the children of Christians, using an adaptation of the rite intended for adults, became more common than baptisms of adult converts, the number of catechumens decreased.&lt;ref name="catechumen"&gt;{{Citation | contribution = Catechumen | year = 2009 | title = Encyclopædia Britannica | accessdate = May 20, 2009 | edition = online | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/99350/catechumen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As baptism was believed to forgive sins, the issue of sins committed after baptism arose. Some insisted that apostasy, even under threat of death, and other grievous sins cut one off forever from the Church.  As indicated in the writings of Saint [[Cyprian]], others favoured readmitting the "[[lapsi (Christian)|lapsi]]" easily. The rule that prevailed was that they were readmitted only after undergoing a period of penance that demonstrated sincere repentance.

What is now generally called the [[Nicene Creed]], longer than the text adopted by the [[First Council of Nicaea]] of 325, and known also as the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed because of its adoption in that form by the [[First Council of Constantinople]] in 381, was probably the baptismal creed then in use in Constantinople, the venue of the 381 Council.{{Sfn | Cross | Livingstone | 2005 | loc = ‘Nicene Creed’}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}

====Studies before 1950====
In ''The Archaeology of Baptism'' (1876) Wolfrid Cote, quoting [[Prudentius]], who in his ''[[Psychomachia]]'' spoke of the "bathed chests" of the baptized, and the views of two earlier Italian archaeologists, stated that "the primitive mode appears to have been this: The administrator and candidate both standing in the water the former placed his right hand on the head of the candidate, and, pronouncing the baptismal words, gently bowed him forward, till he was completely immersed in the water".{{Sfn | Cote | 1876 | p = 31}} He included in his book a woodcut of a fresco in the Catacomb of San Callisto (a photographic reproduction appears in this article), and reported that one archaeologist interpreted it as a youth being baptized by affusion, while for another the youth standing in the water was "immersed in a cloud of water". Cote described this painting as of great antiquity, probably of the 4th or 5th century, while remarking that it is impossible to ascertain the precise age of the pictures in the catacombs of Rome.{{Sfn | Cote | 1876 | pp = 34–35}}  The other paintings that Cote described are of much later periods, while the mosaic in the Baptistery of San Giovanni in Fonte, in Ravenna (erected in the 4th century), which shows John baptizing Jesus by pouring water on his head from a cup, Cote explained as the product of later restoring.{{Sfn | Cote | 1876 | pp = 177–78}} The font in this baptistery Cote described as ten feet in diameter and three and a half feet deep. Cote listed 67 still existing Italian baptisteries dating from the 4th to the 14th centuries, all of which he understood to have been used for total immersion.{{Sfn | Cote | 1876 | pp = 160–61}} He made no mention of any pre-Constantine evidence.

In 1903 Clement F Rogers published "Baptism and Christian Archaeology".  This was a study of the archaeological evidence, both the positive evidence that paintings and carvings on sarcophagi etc. provide about how baptism actually was conferred, and the negative evidence given by the structure of baptismal fonts on how it could not have been conferred. He used literary sources plentifully but merely for illustration. For the first three centuries (i.e. before the time of Constantine) direct archaeological evidence is limited to pictures of baptism in the catacombs of Rome. Rogers concluded that "the direct evidence from archaeology alone may not be conclusive to show that in pre-Constantinian times baptism by affusion only was practiced generally or indeed in any one single case; but it does show that there was nothing repugnant in it to the general mind, that no stress was laid on total immersion, that the most important moments were held to be those when water was poured over the catchumen, and when the minister laid his hand on his head. This, taken in connexion with the known customs of later ages, make it more than probable that the usual method of administration was by affusion only."{{Sfn | Rogers | 2006 | pp = 257–58}}  Taking into account the positive archaeological evidence of post-Constantinian times, Roger concludes: "All the evidence of archaeology goes to prove that the essential part of baptism was considered in the early Church to be the pouring of water over the candidate's head by the bishop, or the guiding his head under a descending stream, followed by the laying on of hands"; he adds: "There remains the question, whether this was preceded by a self-immersion".{{Sfn | Rogers | 2006 | p = 304}} To answer this question, he examines the negative evidence of ancient baptismal fonts, especially those found in archaeological sites, providing on pp.&amp;nbsp;347–49 a Synoptic Table of Fonts, with date, shape, diameter and depth, showing that some of them could not have been intended for full immersion.

In his "Churches Separated from Rome" (1907), [[Louis Duchesne]] responded to accusations by Eastern Orthodox that the Roman Catholic was corrupted because of "the Filioque, baptism by affusion, unleavened bread, &amp;c.",{{Sfn | Duchesne | 1907 | p = 49}} by pointing to the absence of any ancient representation of baptism that showed the neophyte actually being immersed totally.{{Sfn | Duchesne | 1907 | pp = 62–63 | ps =: ‘We constantly see representations of the celebration of baptism on monuments the Gospel scene of the baptism of our Lord, or even ordinary baptisms.  But do we ever see total immersion, the neophyte plunged into the water so as to disappear completely? Such a thing is never seen. This immersion, which is the Greek form, is never to be met with, either in the mosaics of ancient churches, or in the paintings of the Catacombs, nor in ordinary pictures or domestic objects, glasses, spoons, &amp;c, nor sculptured, nor engraved on marble. In all such ancient monuments the neophyte appears standing, his feet in the water, but the greater part of his body out of the water, while water is poured on his head with the hand or with a vase’}}

====Studies in the second half of the 20th century====
Alois Stenzel's 1958 study of baptism with a focus on liturgy{{Sfn | Ferguson | 2009 | p = 5 | ps =: ‘Stenzel's introduction identifies his interest as liturgy, not theology or parallels from the history of religions, and primarily the Latin development leading to the medieval Roman liturgy’}} argued that both immersion and affusion were practised by the early Church, since some baptismal pools which have been uncovered were too shallow for baptism and pictorial evidence favoured affusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | quote = Stenzel is of the opinion that both immersion and affusion were practised. He bases his opinion on archaeological findings which show a lack of depth in baptismal 'pools' ('piscinae'), making a total immersion of an adult impossible. Pictorial representations which reflect baptismal procedures of the time strengthen his opinion: 'The person being baptized stands in water which reaches only half way up his body and water is poured from above. If the flow of water is sufficient then he is wholly covered at least for an instant with water and so 'buried', 'immersed', as the Fathers say | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5ZcAJHpwA_IC&amp;pg=PA262 | first = Michael | last = Kunzler | title = The Liturgy of the Church | publisher = LIT | year = 2001 | ISBN = 3-8258-4854-X | page = 262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Baptism in the Early Church" by George Rice (1981), in "[[Bible and Spade]]", cited Cote with favour and claimed that archaeology "overwhelmingly testifies to immersion as the normal mode of baptism in the Christian church during the first ten to fourteen centuries".{{Sfn | Rice | 1981 | ps =: ‘Among the ruins of early Christian structures, and also in ancient churches still in use, the history of Christian baptism can be traced. Paintings in catacombs and churches, mosaics on floors, walls, and ceilings, sculptured reliefs, and drawings in ancient New Testament manuscripts add details to this history, as well as raising interesting questions that need further investigation. The record left by these various witnesses overwhelmingly testifies to immersion as the normal mode of baptism in the Christian church during the first ten to fourteen centuries. This is in addition to the evidence found throughout the writings of the church fathers that immersion was the early church’s common mode of baptism.’}}  Rice cites in particular imagery in the [[Catacomb of Pontian|Catacomb of San Ponziano]]{{Sfn | Rice | 1981 |p=f1 |ps =: ‘This fresco, showing the baptism of Christ, who stands waist-deep in water is attributed to the 9th or 10th century, but Rogers (pp. 289–90) thinks it more probably dates from the 6th. It is illustrated also in Cote, p. 32.’}} and a crypt in the catacomb of Santa Lucina,{{Sfn | Rice | 1981 |p=126}} as well as a 9th- or 10th-century fresco in the basilica of San Clemente{{Sfn | Rice | 1981 |p=127}} he also states that "pictures of Jesus standing in water while John ''pours'' water over His head are of a much later date than those depicting immersion and they demonstrate the change in the mode of baptism that came into the church". He mentions a 4th-century baptistery sufficiently large for immersion,{{Sfn | Rice | 1981 |p=f2 |ps=: ‘One such baptistry in the catacomb of San Ponziano is four and a half feet long, three and a half feet wide, and three and a half feet deep. A channel diverted water from a nearby stream to fill this font.  Wolfred Cote believes it was in use from the first to the fourth century.  Neophytes either stood or knelt in the water and were immersed by 'bending forward under the hand of the administrator'’}}  Rice says that archaeological evidence demonstrates some early baptismal fonts large enough for adult immersion were later made smaller or replaced, to accommodate affusion baptism of infants,{{Sfn | Rice |1981 |p=f3 |ps=: ‘The font of the Basilica of Saint John Lateran is an excellent example. The original font is below floor level, twenty-five feet in diameter and three feet deep.  Lined and paved with marble, it was once used for adult immersion. Falling into disuse, it was filled in and a bath for infant baptism was erected in its place. This, in turn, was no longer used, and a smaller font was placed above it for the pouring of children.’}} leading to mistakes in the dating of art works by 20th-century studies.{{Sfn | Rice |1981 |p=f4 |ps=: ‘Yet it is of interest to note that directly below this dome is a font for immersion that has been subsequently altered for sprinkling! This fact would tend to place a question on Brown’s date for the mosaic, especially since it appears over a baptistry that is inside a church. Baptistries were only beginning to be moved into churches in the sixth century.’}}

In his contribution to the 1986 11th International Archaeology Congress on "What do the texts teach us on the equipment and furnishings needed for baptism in southern Gaul and northern Italy?" Jean-Charles Picard concluded that the texts speak only of immersion and that the area has no archaeological images of baptism by pouring water on the head.&lt;ref name = Picard&gt;{{Citation | quote = Jean-Charles Picard, working with the literary texts but correlating them with archaeological sources for southern France and northern Italy, concludes that the authors who furnish details of the baptismal rite speak only of immersion.  ''Tinguere'', ''mergere'', and ''submergere'' seem to imply a total immersion, and he notes that there is no ancient representation where the celebrant pours water on the head of the baptized. | title = Actes du Congrès International d'Archéologie Chrétienne | origyear = Lyon, Vienne, Grenoble, Genève et Aoste, 21–28 septembre 1986 | place = Vatican | year = 1989 | volume = 2 | pages = 1451–68}}; as reported in {{Harvnb | Ferguson | 2009 | p = 852}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, on the basis of archaeology and parallels with Jewish practice, [[William Sanford La Sor|Sanford La Sor]] considered it likely that total immersion was also Christian practice.&lt;ref name="Sor, 1987"&gt;{{Citation | quote = The philological evidence is technical and inconclusive. But the archaeological and Mishnaic evidence seems to support the argument for immersion. That is clearly what occurred in the contemporaneous Jewish miqva’ot, so that is probably what happened in early Jewish Christian baptism | first = Sanford | last = La Sor | title = Discovering What Jewish Miqva’ot Can Tell Us About Christian Baptism | journal = Biblical Archaeology Review | year = 1987 | volume = 13 | number = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year, Lothar Heiser, in his study of baptism in the Orthodox Church, concluded on the basis of the literary and pictorial evidence in that field that "the water customarily reached the hips of the baptizand; after calling on the triune God, the priest bent the baptizand under so as to dip him in water over the head; in the cases of pouring in the Didache and in sickbed baptism the baptized did not stand in the font"; but acknowledges that in present Greek practice the priest places the infant being baptized as far down in the water as possible and scoops water over the head so as to cover the child fully with water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | language = German | title = Die Taufe in der orthodoxen Kirche: Geschichte, Spendung und Symbolik nach der Lehre der Väter |trans-title=The Baptism in the Orthodox Church: History, dispensation and symbolism according to the teaching of the Fathers | place = Trier | publisher = Paulinus | year = 1987 | pages = 101–2}}, as reported in {{Harvnb | Ferguson | 2009 | p = 860}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Renate Pillinger concluded from the evidence provided by images and buildings and by some literary sources that it was usual for the baptizand to stand in water no more than hip-deep and for the baptizer to pour water over him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first= Renate |last= Pillinger |title= The Significance of Early Christian Monuments for the Study of Liturgy: The Example of Baptism |journal= Studia liturgica | volume = 25 |year=1995 |pages=32–50}}, reported in {{Harvnb | Ferguson | 2009 | p=858}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to the shallow baptismal fonts that archaeologists had discovered, Malka Ben Pechat expressed in 1999 the view that full immersion was possible even in small fonts with a mere 60 centimetres (2 feet) of water, while the fonts that were even shallower were intended for the baptism of infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Ben Pechat |first= Malka |title=(needs title) |quote= Consequently I have come to the conclusion that an adult of average height should have adapted himself, helped by the priest, to the dimensions of the font and to its internal design by taking an appropriate position which would have enabled him to dip and rise [sic] his head without losing his balance. Either bending his knees, kneeling, or sitting, an adult could have been totally immersed as required in fonts from {{convert|1.30|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}} to {{convert|60|cm|ft|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}} deep ... Under {{cvt|60|cm|ft}} by depth the fonts were probably used for child baptism only}} quoted in {{Harvnb | Ferguson | 2009 | p = 852}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====21st-century studies====
In the close of his comprehensive 2009 study, ''Baptism in the Early Church'',{{Sfn | Ferguson | 2009}} Everett Ferguson devoted four pages (457–60) to summarizing his position on the mode of baptism, expressed also in his ''The Church of Christ'' of 1996,{{Sfn | Ferguson | 1996 | pp = 201–3}} that the normal early-Christian mode of baptism was by full immersion.{{Sfn | Ferguson | 2009 | pp = 857–58 | ps =: ‘The Christian literary sources, backed by secular word usage and Jewish religious immersions, give an overwhelming support for full immersion as the normal action. Exceptions in cases of lack of water and especially of sickbed baptism were made. Submersion was undoubtedly the case for the fourth and fifth centuries in the Greek East, and only slightly less certain for the Latin West. [...] The express statements in the literary sources, supported by other hints, the depictions in art, and the very presence of specially built baptismal fonts, along with their size and shape, indicate that the normal procedure was for the administrator with his head on the baptizand's head to bend the upper part of the body forward and dip the head under the water.’}}

He observed that "those who approach the study of baptism from the standpoint of archaeology tend to find greater probability that affusion, or perfusion was a normal practice; those who come from the literary evidence see a greater likelihood of immersion, or submersion, being the normal practice"; but he intended his own comprehensive survey to give coherence to the evidence (p.&amp;nbsp;857). Ferguson dismissed Rogers' 1903 study as dated with regard to both the depictions of baptism and his survey of the baptismal fonts.{{Sfn | Ferguson | 2009 | p = 858 | ps =: ‘Claiming that the literature and the church orders represent the ideal and archaeology the average, Rogers examines the artistic representations in various media and baptismal fonts. His work is now quite dated, especially in dates assigned to the items examined, is replaced by later, more complete knowledge, and includes many items later than the period of my study’}}

Like Rice, whom he did not mention, Ferguson said that the size of the baptismal fonts was progressively reduced in connection with the prevalence of infant baptism,{{Sfn | Ferguson | 2009 | pp = 836–8 | ps =: ‘The progressive reduction in size from an exterior diameter of nearly 3 meters [10 ft] and interior diameter of over 2.40 meters to an interior dimension of {{convert|1.80| meters|disp=sqbr}} may reflect increased use of affusion or the decline of adult baptism […] At Noli in Liguria beneath the Romanesque church of San Paragorio there is a fifth-century font, octagonal on the exterior and a circle on the interior with a diameter of 1.26 meters and a depth of about 1.60 meters. It shows successive reduction in size […] A late baptistery may be noted for its indication of changes prompted by the general practice of infant baptism’}} although there are a few cases where larger fonts are later than the smaller ones.{{Sfn | Ferguson | 2009 | p = 849}} Ferguson also stated: "The predominant number of baptismal fonts permitted immersion, and many were so large as to defy any reason for their existence other than immersion".{{Sfn | Ferguson | 2009 | p = 834}}

Robin Jensen writes: "Historians have sometimes assumed that baptism was usually accomplished by full immersion – or submersion – of the body (dunking). However, the archaeological and iconographic evidence is ambiguous on this point. Many – if not most – surviving baptismal fonts are too shallow to have allowed submersion. In addition, a significant number of depictions show baptismal water being poured over the candidate's head (affusion), either from a waterfall, an orb or some kind of liturgical vessel."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=7iVXYCr0gAkC&amp;pg=PA137 | first = Robin | last = Jensen | title = Living Water | publisher = Brill | year = 2010 | ISBN = 978-9-00418898-3 | page = 137}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Eerdman's Dictionary of the Bible'' also casts doubt on "the usual assumption that all NT baptisms were by immersion", stating that some early baptisteries were deep enough to stand in but not broad enough to lie down in, and mentioning that ancient representation of Christ at his baptism show him standing in waist-deep water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qRtUqxkB7wkC&amp;pg=PA148 | editor1-first = David Noel | editor1-last = Freedman | editor2-first = Allen C | editor2-last = Myers | title = Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible | publisher = Amsterdam University Press | year = 2000 | page = 148}}&lt;/ref&gt; The immersion used by early Christians in baptizing "need not have meant full submersion in the water"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=dyWqm3hCMC0C&amp;pg=PA163 | editor-first = Peter C | editor-last = Bower | title = Companion to the Book of Common Worship | publisher = Geneva Press | year = 2003 | ISBN = 978-0-66450232-4 | page = 163}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=2_jPGFpKY5EC&amp;pg=PA1397 | first = David | last = Hellholm | others = et al | title = Ablution, Initiation and Baptism | publisher = Walter de Gruyter | year = 2011 | ISBN = 978-3-11024751-0 | pages = 682, 699, 1397}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, while it may have been normal practice, it was not seen as a necessary mode of baptism,{{Sfn | Dyrness | Kärkkäinen | 2008 | p = [http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1&amp;q=Dyrness+%22baptism+any+less+valid%22  101]}} so that other modes also may have been used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Laurie | last = Guy | title = Introducing Early Christianity | publisher = InterVarsity Press | year = 2011 | ISBN = 978-0-83083942-1 | page = 225}}&lt;/ref&gt; Submersion, as opposed to partial immersion, may even have been a minority practice in early Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=15l5qaj7GqcC&amp;pg=PA99 | title = Pastoral Answers | newspaper = Our Sunday Visitor | year = 2002 | ISBN = 978-0-87973725-2 | page = 99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Darwin IV''' is a fictional [[planet]] and the subject of [[Wayne Barlowe]]'s book ''[[Expedition (book)|Expedition]]'' and the [[television]] special, ''[[Alien Planet]]'', based on ''Expedition''. Although the details of the discovery and exploration of Darwin IV differ in the two presentations, both are essentially the same in their depiction of the planetary environment and its [[Extraterrestrial life|native life-forms]], whose abundance and variety prompt the name [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]].

==Introduction==

===Television===
In ''Alien Planet'', a more basic scenario is presented where a ship called the ''[[Wernher von Braun|Von Braun]]'' is sent to explore an alien world outside the [[solar system]]. The ''Von Braun'' is sent to a binary star system about 6.5 light-years from Earth. At 20% of the speed of light (0.2c), it takes about 42.5 years to travel to this system. Upon arrival it goes into orbit around Darwin IV, the Von Braun deployed the Darwin Reconnaissance Orbiter to scan the planet from orbit. The Von Braun also dispatches three identically shaped [[Aerostat|lighter-than-air]] probes to the planet surface. These three probes are:

*''[[Leonardo da Vinci]]'' (nicknamed "Leo" and colored blue).
*''[[Sir Isaac Newton]]'' (nicknamed "Ike" and colored yellow).
*''Balboa'' (named after ''[[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]]'' and coloured red). Balboa did not survive entry into the Darwin IV atmosphere, because one wing of its lifting body transport failed to unfold. (Balboa was evidently doomed from the start &amp;mdash; the screenwriters of ''Alien Planet'' never proposed a nickname for it, and it wasn't named in full name.)

In both stories the low [[gravity]] and dense [[atmosphere]] allow for aerial organisms that would be impossible on [[Earth]].

The binary star system best fitting the described one above is [[Luhman 16]], a binary system of brown dwarfs 6.59 light-years away, though it is questionable whether a brown dwarf could actually support life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234234812_Habitability_of_Brown_Dwarf_Planets|title = Habitability of Brown Dwarf Planets|website = ResearchGate|access-date = 2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, ''Expedition'' and ''Alien Planet'' were both released several years before the discovery of Luhman 16.

==Geography and evolution==
&lt;!--  Commented out:  --&gt;
It seems likely that Darwin IV was covered with large oceans a few million years ago, just like Earth. But because of important climatic changes, the oceans evaporated and most of the ocean water became part of the atmosphere of the planet. The continents are now mountain chains and plateaus, while the ocean floor has become a large, open plain of deserts and savannah. Thus, most of the creatures who now inhabit Darwin IV are descendants of land-dwelling animals

The dense atmosphere is full of clouds and meteorologic activity and the plains sometimes resemble "weather oceans". 
Most of the water is found in the atmosphere, but there are also millions of tons of frozen water in the regions of the poles, and big lakes and rivers where the 'pocket-forests' reside.

In the deepest part of the evaporated ocean basins, there is a "lake", the Amoebic Sea, composed of tons of microscopic creatures who have evolved to conserve the last of the remaining sea water inside their bodies in order to survive.

The continental plates are still moving, and the areas where they collide are full of earthquakes and volcanic activity, phenomena that remain mostly unseen on Earth since there they occur under the surface of the oceans.

==Senses==
The species on Darwin have all evolved [[sonar]], [[acoustic location|echo-location]] using a variety of sounds as their primary sense, rather than perceiving light, as most animals on Earth do. Many have complicated [[Cephalon (arthropod head)|cephalon]]s to aid in this sense. The majority have also evolved [[Bioluminescence|biolights]]; but rather than communicating information in the [[visible light]] spectrum, biolights on Darwin IV function in the infrared range, as all Darwinian animals are quite sensitive to that spectrum. Their sensory organs to detect light in the infrared spectrum are more comparable to [[thermoreceptors]] found in [[Crotalinae|pit vipers]] or [[rattlesnake]]s. The '''Rimerunner''' still has one bizarre, retractable, [[atrophy]]ing eye, a remnant from a time when sight-based organisms still had a place on Darwin IV. Also, most species are hermaphrodites.

==List of species==
Below is a list of the species found on Darwin IV.

All species in ''Alien Planet'' were mentioned or depicted in ''Expedition''; however, it should be noted that the Electrophyte was only briefly depicted in the book and was only fully explained in ''Alien Planet''.

===Animals===
* '''Amoebic Sea''' - The Amoebic Sea is a gelatinous sea of single-celled organisms. All the water in the Amoebic Sea is absorbed and sealed within the gelatinous mass to prevent further evaporation, as the planet is slowly losing water over the eons. It is home to '''Emperor Sea Striders''' and '''Sac-backs'''. Littoralopes often visit the Amoebic Sea, eating the organisms. Tentacles come out of the surface of the Amoebic Sea and trap Emperor Sea Strider Nymphs, then consume them alive.
* '''Arctic Sedge Slider''' - A ten-meter-tall biped, the Arctic Sedge Slider is adapted for life in the cold. The Arctic Sedge Slider's name comes from the furrows it leaves in its wake. This creature has an adaptation for the cold. When temperatures drop, or when a fierce Arctic storm approaches, the Arctic Sedge Slider has the ability to retract its head deep into its warm body cavity. When conditions are favorable again, its head reemerges again and it resumes its activities. The Arctic Sedge Slider has what may be the biggest sonar bulge of any animal on Darwin IV. This massive organ produces sonar pings in, not one, but multiple frequencies. Since the bulge is located on the Arctic Sedge Slider's back, it gives the animal the ability to "see" in 360 degrees. This makes it much more difficult for a predator to catch an Arctic Sedge Slider by surprise.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070311114202/http://mupinc.net/surrealism/waynedouglasbarlowe/images/am_wayne_barlowe_arctic_sledge_slider.jpg A pair of Arctic Sedge Sliders with Ice Darts]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Arctic-Strider''' - An Arctic bipedal alien that stores fat in its legs.
* '''Arctic Tripedalien'''
* '''Arrowtongue''' - A bipedal alien with black coloration and red spotted biolights. Averaging about eight meters (26 feet) tall, an Arrowtongue impales its prey with a {{convert|3|m|ft}}-long, serrated, arrow-tipped [[proboscis]]. Like many spiders on Earth (and like most predators on Darwin IV), Arrowtongues are [[liquivore]]s, [[:wikt:injecting|injecting]] [[digestive juices]] into their prey and then sucking up the liquefied organs. They are fierce, solitary hunters found on the grasslands of Darwin IV. Like most of Darwin IV's animals, their pointed, spade-like heads contain no true jaws. They use sonar in order to find other species and food.
* '''Beach Loper''' - The Beach Loper is a bipedalien with a trunk like an elephant's. It probably feeds on microflyers. It is a distant peripheral cousin of the immense '''Emperor Sea Strider'''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070311114202/http://mupinc.net/surrealism/waynedouglasbarlowe/images/am_wayne_barlowe_beachquills___beach_loper.jpg A Beach Loper being attacked by a swarm of Beach Quills]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Beach Quill''' - Beach Quills are short-range attack hunters and are some of the smallest creatures on Darwin IV. They attack in colonies and kill their prey with a neurotoxin. In ''Alien Planet'' a large colony kills a Groveback. They can propel themselves by means of a folded muscular "foot". The beach quills in Expedition were one meter in length as opposed to the {{convert|3|in|mm|sing=on}} long beach quills in Alien Planet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsc.discovery.com/convergence/alienplanet/slideshows/animals/slide_02.html An image of a Beach Quill] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904095655/http://dsc.discovery.com/convergence/alienplanet/slideshows/animals/slide_02.html |date=2006-09-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Beach-Runner''' - A bipedalien with long legs that sprints along the shore of the Amoebic Sea.
* '''Beach-Dweller''' - A tripedalien with long legs that lives along the littoral zone of the Amoebic sea.
* '''Belly-Thrower''' - A monopedal animal which has an eating habit similar to that of a [[starfish]] on Earth; it inverts its stomach outside the body and catches prey in it.
* '''Bladderhorn''' - This creature is a bright blue, rather comical-looking bipedal animal, with two "antlers" extending out of the sides of its head and have red biolight markings on them. The antlers are actually sacs designed to inflate and make it look much larger than it truly is. Bladderhorns make bellowing sounds by deflating the air sacs. The Bladderhorn uses its "[[antlers]]" for communication, which, in ''Alien Planet'', causes Leo to conclude it is a good candidate for communication. Leo shows the Bladderhorn a symbol puzzle, but the Bladderhorn becomes apparently agitated, bellowing at him, and then runs away. Actually, the Bladderhorn ran away because of a sonic ping. Ike sees the same Bladderhorn near the conclusion of the exploration. Bladderhorns fight with their bladders like antlers, using bioluminescent light shows and their bladders to scare away predators and rivals.
* '''Bolt-Tongue''' - A polar cousin of the Arrowtongue, the Bolt-tongue is a Darwinian predator which uses a large arrow-tipped appendage to kill its prey. The bolt-tongue possesses a sonar bulge in the form of an arc running down its head. Like all predators on Darwin IV, it has no eyes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070311114202/http://mupinc.net/surrealism/waynedouglasbarlowe/images/am_wayne_barlowe_bolt_tongue.jpg The head of a Bolt-tongue]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Bush Jumpstar''' 
* '''Butchertree''' - Many species prey on the numerous, fast breeding Prismalope, but the Butchertree is the only species that actually lures the Prismalope instead of chasing it. Dotting the plains of the northern hemisphere, the Butchertree kills anything that comes within range of its four branch-daggers. They have a bizarre relationship with an unnamed flying organism, which is the primary food source of Prismalopes. The Butchertree grows underground roots that resemble these fliers, allowing the "tree" to lure Prismalopes close enough to try to kill and eat them. It is unknown just how this species reproduces. One possibility is that the small flier it associates with transfers eggs and sperm between individuals. Another possibility is that the flier itself is the second gender of the species, an extreme form of [[sexual dimorphism]]. Either way, young Butchertrees are found close to their "parent", and are connected to them through an umbilical cord similar to that of the "growths" that mimic the fliers. The cord disappears once the young are capable of nourishing themselves. In ''Alien Planet'' the Butchertree is one of only two species shown to prey on Skewers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070311114202/http://mupinc.net/surrealism/waynedouglasbarlowe/images/am_wayne_barlowe_butchertree.jpg A sketch of a butchertree]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Brain Ball''' - Brain-like creatures in the background of the waterhole. They are small animals. Described by Barlowe as "huge, colonial earthbound floaters".
* '''Candy Slider'''
* '''Carver Wing''' - An incredibly aggressive ectoparasitoid flyer that lays its eggs on the dorsal survases of large animals. Once the eggs hatch, the Carver wings will devour their host.
* '''Cragspringer''' - A wingless cousin of the Springwing that is also a mountain-dweller but is more of a leaper than a glider, as it lacks the gliding wings of a Springwing.
* '''Daggerwrist''' - The Daggerwrist is a human-sized tree-dwelling four-legged carnivore. It glides from tree to tree with the assistance of thin membranes, or [[Patagium|patagia]], similar to those of a [[flying squirrel]]. Its forelimbs are large daggers designed for clinging to plaque-bark trees and killing prey, mainly Trunk-suckers. Unlike most of Darwin IV's predators, the Daggerwrist has what could be a jaw, but it is actually part of the skull that detaches to stab its prey and inject the needed digestive enzymes. This organ is connected to the chest of the Daggerwrist by a chord and is often tucked under the head, giving the jaw illusion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070311114202/http://mupinc.net/surrealism/waynedouglasbarlowe/images/am_wayne_barlowe_daggerwrist_03.jpg A sketch of a Daggerwrist gliding]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070311114202/http://mupinc.net/surrealism/waynedouglasbarlowe/images/am_wayne_barlowe_daggerwrist_04.jpg a sketch of a Daggerwrist's head]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Diskflyer''' - Diskflyers live around the Amoebic Sea and operate within very distinct four square kilometer territories. It is not known whether young Diskflyers stay within the territories in which they were born or if they leave to establish new territories of their own. Diskflyers are [[hermaphroditic]], like most of Darwin IV's fauna, and mating impregnates both partners. It is not known whether diskflyers give birth to live young or eggs.possibly related to skewers.
* '''Ebony Blister-wing''' - An immense flier, the Ebony Blister-wing can sometimes attain wingspans in excess of {{convert|1000|ft|m}}.
* '''Emperor Sea Strider''' - The Emperor Sea Strider is the largest known creature on Darwin IV. In ''[[Alien Planet]]'', the Emperor Sea-strider is {{convert|70|ft|m}} tall, but it is much more massive in the book Expedition. Though their exact size is unknown, if Mr. Barlowe's account is correct, they would be {{convert|620.1|ft|m}} tall. Emperor Sea-striders walk on the surface of the Amoebic Sea with their two massive feet. Emperor Sea-striders are found only on the Amoebic Sea because the sea is the only source of food in numbers large enough to support such creatures, much like krill is for baleen whales on Earth. When Emperor Sea-striders are born they are capable of flight, but as adults they are bipedal. Hatched from eggs, the tiny Sea Strider Nymphs are attracted to an energy source located beneath the adult's mouthless head. Hollow, light-weight creatures, they cannot yet walk, but they fly about Darwin IV on their short wings, like Earth's hummingbirds. They have an unusual method of feeding; their mouths are located on their feet, so it eats the organisms by stepping on them. The identifying traits they have are a mouthless crested head, two very large orange biolights (which are cavities in the book), two large tails (which is actually a tail and a [[phallus]] according to the book), and smaller blue biolights accenting their crests and tails.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsc.discovery.com/convergence/alienplanet/slideshows/animals/slide_06.html A sketch of Sea Strider Nymph] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903213740/http://dsc.discovery.com/convergence/alienplanet/slideshows/animals/slide_06.html |date=2006-09-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Eosapien'''- Eosapiens are the sentient natives of Darwin IV in both Expedition and [[Alien Planet]]. The Eosapiens appear to be highly mobile, airborne, and semi-sentient. They possess limbs with tentacle-like fingers as well as claws, navigate with organic rudders, and use large sacs of methane to provide lift. Eosapiens have rudimentary intelligence roughly equivalent to that of our own early ancestors like ''[[Homo erectus]]''. They carry spears and spikes for hunting. In the book, they dropped these weapons to make a cage around prey and then lift them away. They also seem to harvest the floating balls of gel the Amoebic Sea produces. The Eosapiens seemed to have gathered stones and arranged them in a circular pattern around Leo, like prehistoric monuments such as Stonehenge. Their name means "dawn thinker" in Latin because of the time when Barlowe first encountered them. In ''Alien Planet'' they were one of only two species able to prey on Skewers, but they most often feed on Gill-heads. Leo was assaulted by an Eosapien shortly after trying to communicate with a Bladderhorn. A group of Eosapiens apparently interpreted a camera disk launched by Ike as a threat; the last image from the camera disk showed the Eosapiens flying away, carrying a limp Ike. The floating balloon probe resembles the floating Eosapiens, and the launch of the video disc was probably interpreted as throwing a weapon. This species differs in appearance in the book compared to Alien Planet. In ''Alien Planet'', the Eosapiens fingers were made more tentacle-like and longer, and they increased the size of its bladders, had spears instead of spikes, their skin color (reddish-pink instead of blue-green, both had yellow biolights) and hunting strategies also differ from what is found in the book.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070311114202/http://mupinc.net/surrealism/waynedouglasbarlowe/images/am_wayne_barlowe_eosapien.jpg Barlowe's version of an Eosapien with a spike]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Finleg''' - Small, silver, barrel-shaped herbivores with two fin-like limbs, hence the name. Even though it only has two fins, it walks on four points, two on each fin. They feed on the semi-liquid membrane of the jelly-bladder plants.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070311114202/http://mupinc.net/surrealism/waynedouglasbarlowe/images/am_wayne_barlowe_flipsticks.jpg Small colony of Fin Legs (bottom-left corner)]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Finned Snapper''' - A carnivore with 2 front legs and an airfoil like hind quarters that lifts it when it runs. They feed on Jetdarters by flicking their agile and dexterous hunting arm located on the head. They are very light weight and have very delicate bones. The individual encountered by Barlowe was injured when the hovercone's engine tossed the animal, where it was later assaulted by jetdarters.
* '''Flipstick''' - Flipsticks are tremendously tall, cylindrical animals. The Flipstick's signature form of locomotion involves leaping into the air and flipping 180° to land on its opposite end. These {{convert|60|m|ft|abbr=on}}&lt;!--long or tall?--&gt; creatures feed on microflyers by jamming their sonar with an oscillating tone, then scoop them up in feeding scoops.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070311114202/http://mupinc.net/surrealism/waynedouglasbarlowe/images/am_wayne_barlowe_flipsticks.jpg Four Flipsticks in an area showing Fin-legs, Jelly-bladder plants, and Gelsuckers]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Follow-wing''' - Small blue flyers that usually follow Skewers to scavenge from their kills. They are related to the Skewer, but they are only {{convert|2|m|ft}} long.
* '''Forest Gulper''' - A large animal that lures animals into its mouth by scent, then slowly digests them alive. They resemble a giant green barrel with a thick snake-like tail, and a pair of atrophied beating wings. These wings are used for flight in the Gulper's larval stage, but become vestigial as the animal matures. This creature is one of the last animals with true jaws ever on Darwin IV, one of them being the Groveback.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070311114202/http://mupinc.net/surrealism/waynedouglasbarlowe/images/am_wayne_barlowe_gulper_devouring_spade_nose.jpg A Forest Gulper prepares to devour an unsuspecting Spade-nose]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Forest Slider''' - Forest Sliders are bipedal animals that are born with four limbs, but as their rear skid hardens and matures, their hind limbs shrivel and eventually fall off.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070311114202/http://mupinc.net/surrealism/waynedouglasbarlowe/images/am_wayne_barlowe_forest_slider.jpg A Forest Slider drinking from a stream in a forest with Hooked-tailed Flyers]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070311114202/http://mupinc.net/surrealism/waynedouglasbarlowe/images/am_wayne_barlowe_forest_slider2.jpg a young Forest Slider with one of its hind limbs shriveling away]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Gel-sucker''' - The Gel-sucker is a quadruped, [[Centaur]]-like animals. but also has a pair of clawed arms, giving it a total of six limbs. Gelsuckers are so called because they feast on the flesh of the Jelly Bladder plant, which grows in small groves on the outskirts of pocket forests. They use their clawed arms to rip the Jelly Bladders open, and then use their extendible proboscis to suck out the semi-solid flesh.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070311114202/http://mupinc.net/surrealism/waynedouglasbarlowe/images/am_wayne_barlowe_flipsticks.jpg Two Gelsuckers in an area with Flipsticks, Fin legs, and jelly-bladder plants]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Gill-Head''' - A biped with a spike on its chest to support it, almost like a third leg. They are one of the last remaining terrestrial air-sifters, such as the Rime-Runner. The Eosapiens prey upon it.
* '''Ghost Brackenhopper'''
* '''Groveback''' - The Groveback is perhaps the second largest [[tortoise]]-like creature native to Darwin IV. When fully mature, they are large enough to have entire stands of trees grow on their backs during the long periods of dormancy spent buried in the ground. Once mobile, they travel on two large front legs and a rear appendage shaped much like a boat rudder. The feeding habits of the Groveback differ between the book and the film. In ''[[Alien Planet]]'', the Groveback feeds by absorbing nutrients from the soil through the skin of its underbody. In the ''Expedition'', the Groveback is a filter feeder, feeding on the microscopic plants and animals that number in the millions in Darwin IV's air currents. Considering the Groveback's size and speed, the first mentioned lifestyle may sound more realistic, but when considering the multitude of slow filter feeders and many nostril-like orifices covering the Groveback's head, the latter lifestyle is just as possible. The Groveback is one of the many creatures on Darwin IV with true jaws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsc.discovery.com/convergence/alienplanet/slideshows/animals/slide_07.html A sketch of Groveback] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904132805/http://dsc.discovery.com/convergence/alienplanet/slideshows/animals/slide_07.html |date=2006-09-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Gyrosprinter''' - The "[[antelope]]" of Darwin IV. However, unlike the antelopes of Earth, the Gyrosprinter has just two legs arranged in a rather unconventional manner - one right behind the other. The legs appear to have evolved to become fused from two forelegs and two hind legs over millions of years; the Gyrosprinter's ancestors were probably once quadrupeds like Earth's quadrupeds. Unfortunately, such a placement of legs can be a problem for balance. The Gyrosprinter has solved this by having two balance organs (similar to the [[inner ear]] of a human) located in two thick prongs protruding from either side of its body. It has two hearts, a two meter long tongue, and its nostrils are located on its shoulders. The Gyrosprinter is able to run at speeds of up to {{convert|80|km/h|mi/h}} and has a running stride of up to {{convert|15|ft}}.
* '''Hammer-headed Veldt Wing''' - A hooded grassland flyer that has crescent-shaped head on the end of a skinny neck. It is on the Rayback menu.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070311114202/http://mupinc.net/surrealism/waynedouglasbarlowe/images/am_wayne_barlowe_rayback2.jpg Hammer-Head Veldt Wing being chased by a hungry Rayback]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Hook-tailed Flyer''' - A yellow, medium-sized flyer with a hooked tail and a single float bladder.
* '''Hopper-Cone''' - Small animals that steal scraps of Jelly-bladder plants ripped open by Gel-suckers.
* '''Ice-Crawler''' - Quadrupeds that resemble [[pillbug]]s, nearly immobile, which make comically flatulent noises when emerging from their "sleep sack".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070311114202/http://mupinc.net/surrealism/waynedouglasbarlowe/images/am_wayne_barlowe_icecrawler.jpg Ice Crawlers on a beach with Rime-runner]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Icedart''' - A small flying animal that has three pointed tubes for feeding and drinking, one on its face, another on its bottom sides, and a third one on its rear. It also pokes itself on ice during snow storms. They are floater.
* '''Jetdarter''' - One of Darwin IV's more bizarre aerial life forms. The Jetdarter is a scavenger whose compact body assumes a [[dart (missile)|dart]]-like shape. It has no wings to aid in flight. Instead, it has a biological version of a jet engine, complete with a turbine of bone and gristle. It has two legs which fold up during flight, although on ''Alien Planet'', they do not appear to have legs at all. The Jetdarter forms nests in the pocket-forests and fears many predators, such as Electrophyte plants and Finned Snappers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070311114202/http://mupinc.net/surrealism/waynedouglasbarlowe/images/am_wayne_barlowe_jetdarter.jpg Anatomical sketch of a Jetdarter]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsc.discovery.com/convergence/alienplanet/slideshows/animals/slide_09.html Image of a Jetdarter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924113508/http://dsc.discovery.com/convergence/alienplanet/slideshows/animals/slide_09.html |date=2006-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Keeled Slider''' - The Keeled Slider is a large brown animal with kneeled arms. It builds special egg chambers to keep eggs and young. It slides down muddy mountains. It is not [[hermaphroditic]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070311114202/http://mupinc.net/surrealism/waynedouglasbarlowe/images/am_wayne_barlowe_keeled_slider.jpg Two Keeled Sliders]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Leopard Slider'''
* '''Lesser Sea Strider'''
* '''Littoralope''' - The Littoralope are the creatures that use huge Sea-Strider [[skull]]s for shelter in ''Expedition''. In Alien Planet, the Littoralopes are described as placid, slow-moving quadrupeds with little evidence of intelligence. They also have tails resembling their heads, similar to Symets, which did not appear in ''Alien Planet''. This feature probably evolved to confuse predators.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070311114202/http://mupinc.net/surrealism/waynedouglasbarlowe/images/am_wayne_barlowe_emperor_sea_strider_s_skull.jpg Photo with Littoralopes living inside of a Sea Strider's skull]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsc.discovery.com/convergence/alienplanet/slideshows/animals/part2/slide.html Alien Planet version] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924113941/http://dsc.discovery.com/convergence/alienplanet/slideshows/animals/part2/slide.html |date=2006-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Microflyer''' - Micro flyers do the function like zooplankton on earth.
* '''Mummy-nest Flyer''' - They are black flyers, with a tail that bends back to meet the front of the body (like scorpions, except the tail is curled under the body, not above). Unlike some flyers, they are not jet propelled, so they have to flap their wings to fly. They probably look like miniature versions of the gargantuan Ebony Blister-Wing Barlowe hypothesizes that the flyer was once part of the Mummy-nest and, as it matured, broke off from it and used its former body as a home.
* '''Mummy-nest''' - This two-legged animal has [[sphincter]]-like orifices on its body. It is later invaded by Mummy-nest Flyers (though they may have once been one and the same).
* '''Peat-Bladder'''
* '''Planolope'''
* '''Prairie-Ram''' - Prairie-rams are ubiquitous liquivores that impale their prey's chest to suck out bodily juices. They are two-legged.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070311114202/http://mupinc.net/surrealism/waynedouglasbarlowe/images/am_wayne_barlowe_prairie_ram.jpg Picture of a Prairie-ram]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Prismalope''' - A tripedalien of Darwin's [[plain]]s, Prismalopes often travel in herds. The first thing one notices about this creature is its massive prism-shaped head. Though it appears ungainly, it houses the Prismalope's grasping tentacles, which it uses to capture small prey. This fast-breeding creature is preyed upon by a multitude of predators, both terrestrial and airborne. The Prismalope hunts a flyer that is "protected" by the Butchertree.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070311114202/http://mupinc.net/surrealism/waynedouglasbarlowe/images/am_wayne_barlowe_prismalope_and_butchertree.jpg Prismalopes with Butchertrees in the  background]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Pronghead''' - Prongheads are bipedal plains predators that feed on Gyrosprinters, Symets and Littoralopes. They are named for the three hollow prongs protruding from their faces that act as tubes to siphon liquids from their prey, since they use their feet to inject their digestive fluids into prey. They hunt in pack in a similar manner to wolves on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070311114202/http://mupinc.net/surrealism/waynedouglasbarlowe/images/am_wayne_barlowe_pronghead.jpg A Pronghead surveying the plains in search of prey]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsc.discovery.com/convergence/alienplanet/slideshows/animals/part2/slide_02.html Image of Pronghead in ''Alien Planet''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924105236/http://dsc.discovery.com/convergence/alienplanet/slideshows/animals/part2/slide_02.html |date=2006-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Rayback''' - An agile and aggressive predator of Darwin IV's grasslands. This creature gets its name for the four tall ridges that project from its back. Apart from its ridges, the Rayback does not appear to have any specialized features. Its only weapons are its lightning-fast speed and a dagger-like tongue. It is fierce and attacks anything that moves. It was the first animal encountered by Barlowe, and apparently, his sudden appearance caused it to start attacking him and his vehicle. A biped, it bears a general resemblance to the Bolt-Tongue and Arrowtongue.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070311114202/http://mupinc.net/surrealism/waynedouglasbarlowe/images/am_wayne_barlowe_rayback1.jpg Picture of Rayback]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Ricochetal Saltator'''                                     
* '''Rimerunner''' - The Rimerunner is a one-legged animal from the polar regions of Darwin IV. Supported by only one leg, the Rimerunner hops across its Arctic home like a [[kangaroo]]. It eats only aerophytes and other microscopic airborne organisms. At the front of its head, the Rimerunner sports an [[umbrella]]-like organ. This organ, suspended by thin neural cables, is a sophisticated sonar system along with a simple and atrophying eye.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070311114202/http://mupinc.net/surrealism/waynedouglasbarlowe/images/am_wayne_barlowe_icecrawler.jpg Picture of a Rimerunner]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''River Prove'''
* '''Rugose Floater''' - Rugose Floaters are heavily wrinkled, [[Ocean Sunfish]]-like aliens about the size of a [[blue whale]] that float in the air. During spawning season, they have eggs trailing behind their "fins" and reduce to their crescent shape when spawning is complete. This is the creature seen on the front cover of ''Expedition'' and at the top of this web page.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070311114202/http://mupinc.net/surrealism/waynedouglasbarlowe/images/am_wayne_barlowe_rugose_floater.jpg Picture of a Rugose Floater]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Sac-back''' - The Sac-back lives at the edge of the Amoebic Sea. They are resembles a [[apatosaurus]]. The Sac-back gets its name from the sac on the male's back. The sac is used to store pre-digested food from the "sea", which is later fed to the females. Male and female Sac-backs live completely different lives. Males live on the surface, walking around on their three legs. Female Sac-backs dig "tombs" in which they bury themselves. Once buried, the only part of the female that sees the light of day is her mouth and tentacle.
* '''Scavengewing''' - Scavengewings are flying animals that have a special digestive system suitable for eating carcasses. The animal completely separates it from its body, dropping it on carrion, then swallows the feeding module. They are floater.
* '''Siphon Floater''' - The large floating creature around the waterhole.
* '''Siphonsnout''' - The small purple creature around the water hole. They's snout are resembles a siphon.
* '''Skewer''' - The largest aerial predator of Darwin IV. It is a humungous flying animal, with a wingspan of {{convert|50|ft|m}}. Not even the largest known pterosaurs (like ''[[Quetzalcoatlus]]'', with its {{convert|40|ft|m|sing=on}} wingspan) from Earth have a wingspan even approaching that size. Its wings do not flap but squeeze, shifting shape to shift flight. It is actually propelled by [[flatulence|combusting methane gas]] in four jet-pods on its wings. This allows the Skewer to travel at speeds of {{convert|200|miles/h|km/h}}. Its killing tool is a hollow lance that impales its prey, injects digestive enzymes, and sucks the corpse dry. The Skewer also hunts in groups, each Skewer dropping the spoils and another swoops in to feast. No large animal on Darwin IV is safe from the skewer. Barlowe mentions an eyewittness attack on a sea strider by skewers, but the way this was done is never mentioned.
* '''Spade-Nose''' - A quadruped that lives in forests and has a blue [[spade]]-like nose, hence the name. It is a common prey of the Gulper.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070311114202/http://mupinc.net/surrealism/waynedouglasbarlowe/images/am_wayne_barlowe_gulper_devouring_spade_nose.jpg Image of a Gulper about to devour a Spade-nose]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Springwing''' - The Springwing is a winged animal with hooved front legs. The appearance of a Springwing is reminiscent to that of a [[hippogriff]]. It springs itself off cliffs, gliding with the alpine updrafts to reach its destination.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070311114202/http://mupinc.net/surrealism/waynedouglasbarlowe/images/am_wayne_barlowe_springwing.jpg Photo of a Springwing]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Stonemime''' - An oval-shaped animal with eight legs. It can mimic a rock.
* '''Stripewing''' - The Stripewing is an odd two-meter-tall [[wyvern]]-like flying creature with stripes on its wings that breaks into a hopping frenzy each night. Stripewings will fold themselves into compact shapes. They can often be seen, in massive colonies, sleeping on the surface of the Amoebic Sea. They are flightless.
* '''Symet''' - Symets are bipedal herbivores named for their protective [[symmetry]]. In ''Expedition'', Barlowe observes a herd of Symets in a desert in bordering the Vallis Przewalski. The symmetry may have evolved to confuse predators.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070311114202/http://mupinc.net/surrealism/waynedouglasbarlowe/images/am_wayne_barlowe_symet.jpg Image of a Symet]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Thornback''' - The Thornback is an herbivore that walks on its three-legged gait. It has a large "thorn" on its back shaped like a [[shark]] fin.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070311114202/http://mupinc.net/surrealism/waynedouglasbarlowe/thumbnails/am_wayne_barlowe_thornback.jpg Image of a Thornback]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070311114202/http://mupinc.net/surrealism/waynedouglasbarlowe/thumbnails/am_wayne_barlowe_thornbacks_and_arrowtongue.jpg Thornbacks pursued by an Arrowtongue]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Tiger-bull''' - One of the creatures around the water hole. An orangish-brown striped animal. They are resembles a [[bull]].
* '''Transalpine Floater''' - A [[whale]]-like gray floater that resides in the mountains.
* '''Trap-Cone'''
* '''Trunk-sucker''' - The Trunksucker is a small animal that glides through Darwin IV's forests and clings to Plaque Bark Trees, sucking their sap. The first dead creature that the probes find on Darwin IV is in fact a Trunksucker, most likely killed by a Daggerwrist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsc.discovery.com/convergence/alienplanet/slideshows/animals/part2/slide_04.html Image of a Trunksucker from ''Alien Planet''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924114208/http://dsc.discovery.com/convergence/alienplanet/slideshows/animals/part2/slide_04.html |date=2006-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Tubeworm'''
* '''Tundra-Plow''' - An animal that digs part of its body in the ground. It gets food from its underground proboscis, pulling plants from underneath as well as filtering soil for food.
* '''Tundra-Roamer''' - four-legged Animals that have a male and female variants. Males have a crest on the back of their heads.
* '''Tundra Slider''' - An animal that resembles the Arctic Sedge Slider with a few different variants.
* '''Unth''' - The Unth is a [[tundra]] creature with [[asymmetrical]] tusks. Unths are named for the sound they make when they take a step. Unths live in herds. The Unths of ''Alien Planet'' are first encountered by Leo, but Ike meets up with this peaceful herbivore near the end of his journey. The Unth herd was apparently spooked by either the Bladderhorn duel nearby, or the mystery creature (which turned out to be an Eosapien), which deactivated Leo.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070311114202/http://mupinc.net/surrealism/waynedouglasbarlowe/images/am_wayne_barlowe_ritual_combat.jpg Two Unths fighting in a snowstorm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070311114202/http://mupinc.net/surrealism/waynedouglasbarlowe/images/am_wayne_barlowe_unth.jpg a sketch of an Unth]&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Expedition,'' Unths had only one gender but still fought for mating rights. In ''Alien Planet,'' the genders of the unths were unknown.
* '''Unnamed Flyer''' - This species has no common name yet. This flying creature is the main food source of the Prismalope in the northern plains. This species has developed an intriguing relationship with the Butchertree. Within a {{convert|15|ft|m|abbr=on}} or so radius of a Butchertree are a dozen or so small growths. The growths are actually part of the Butchertree, connected to it by underground tentacles. These growths are physically identical in appearance to the small unnamed flyers and are used to lure the Prismalopes and other prey. This camouflage is also able to deceive prey into coming inside the Butchertree's attack range, where they then find themselves skewered and drained of fluids.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070311114202/http://mupinc.net/surrealism/waynedouglasbarlowe/images/am_wayne_barlowe_prismalope_and_butchertree.jpg Two Prismalopes unwittingly getting too close to a large Butchertree while investigating unnamed flyers (or the Butchertree's decoys)]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Unnamed Green Flyer'''
* '''Wedgehead''' - One of the creatures around the water hole, the blue one which may have the same kind of symmetry of the littoralope.
* '''Yellow Stinger'''

===Animals (morphology)===
In his Expedition, Barlowe clearly states that he wanted to represent the most impressive, most appealing animals of the planet. There are millions of species who are not represented in detail, even though they have to be an essential part of Darwin IV's ecosystem. Barlowe refers to them as the 'microflyers', tiny animals and plants living in the atmosphere of the planet like plankton lives in the oceans of Earth.
Most animals represented in both the book and the movie belong to one of two essential groups: the floaters and the ground-dwelling species.
However, there is a great variety inside the landdweller family. While on Earth animals are classified by characteristics such as mode of reproduction and metabolism, the large Darwinian animals are classified by their number of limbs. There are four classes: quadrupedalians, tripedalians, bipedalians and monopedalians. However, sometimes it is difficult to say to which group an animal belongs. In fact many animals lose some of their limbs when they grow up, and thus "change" their classification. The forest slider, for instance, has four legs as a juvenile, but only two legs in its adult form.
Most Floaters appear to have no limbs, but eosapiens seem to have evolved from bipedal ancestors for they still have two arms. However, these could as well be highly evolved appendages. 
Many unnamed creatures appear only in sketches.

===Plants===
* '''Aerophyte''' - Microscopic vegetative organisms that float on Darwin IV's air currents and constitute a major source of food for several species on the planet.
* '''Arctic Cactus''' 
* '''Arctic Polar-vane''' - A red plant that lives in the tundra. It rotates, feeding of the energy generated by the two suns.
* '''Beachfinger''' - These are grass-like plants that thrive near the Amoebic Sea.
* '''Bladder Reed'''
* '''Blue whipweed''' - a plant that lives in the polar regions of Darwin IV.
* '''Cliff-polyp''' - These are red grass like plants that are only eaten by Springwings and Bladderhorns.
* '''Darwin Moss''' - These are the plants that are usually seen in grasslands. They resemble green moss on Earth.
* '''Darwin Tomato''' - Darwin Tomatoes are giant molds that grow in the pocket forests. They can grow to be three feet tall.
* '''Electrophyte''' - These red, [[mushroom]]-like plants electrocute animals that stray into their fields, and then consume them alive.

* '''Float Ball''' - These are bushes with stems so small they look like they're floating.
* '''Fodderball Weed''' - The Fodderball Weeds are succulents that have a lightweight construction that puts them at the mercy of every wind.
* '''Gourd Tree''' -15-story tall plants that are supported by root-like stilts. Gourd Trees are either hollow or spongy inside. They have to be for the stilts to support them. In ''Alien Planet'' they are encountered by Leo and Ike, comprising the trees surround the landing site of the probes. In ''Expedition'', the Gourd Trees are called '''Steeple Gourd'''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071007173853/http://mupinc.net/surrealism/waynedouglasbarlowe/thumbnails/am_wayne_barlowe_04.jpg A couple of Gourd Trees (see left in image)]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Grenade Vine''' - a plant with explosive pollen sacks.
* '''Hillvine''' - Hillvines are long plants that grow in the hills.
* '''Jelly-bladder Plant''' - These are plants with jelly-like forms on their stems. The Gelsuckers eat these.

* '''Polardot''' - A plant with small blue flowers that lives in the polar regions of Darwin IV.
* '''Red Mountain-spike''' - These are spiked plants that are eaten by Bladderhorns. They grow in mountain streams.
* '''Screeweed'''

'''Ecological assessment''' (EA) implies the monitoring of [[Natural resource|ecological resources]], to discover the current and changing conditions. EAs are required components of most [[hazardous waste]] site investigations. Such assessments, in conjunction with contamination and human health risk assessments, help to evaluate the [[List of environmental health hazards|environmental hazards]] posed by contaminated sites and to determine remediation requirements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eionet.europa.eu/gemet/concept?cp=2440 ecological assessment&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In ecological assessment many abiotic and biotic indicators, reflecting the pluralistic components of [[ecosystem]]s, are used. Reporting on the state of the [[Natural environment|environment]] requires that information on separate indicators are integrated into comprehensive yardsticks or indices. EA is extremely complex because of regional and temporal variation in vulnerability of ecosystems and because of limited understanding of ecosystem functioning and health.&lt;ref name=Latour1994&gt;{{Citation |last=Latour |first=J. |first2=C. |last2=Groen |title=Ecological assessment of natural resources in agroecosystems of Dutch Lowland Peat area |journal=Environmental Management |year=1994 |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=141–145 |doi=10.1007/BF02393873|bibcode = 1994EnMan..18..455L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indicators==
[[File:Indicator 3.0.JPG|thumb|Indicators of ecological assessment]]
Ecological indicators are able to
* assess the condition of the environment
* provide an early warning signal of changes in the environment, or
* diagnose the cause of an environmental problem.
Ideally the suite of indicators should represent key information about structure, function, and composition of the ecological system.&lt;ref name="Dale"&gt;{{Citation |last=Dale |first=V. H. |last2=Beyeler|first2=S. C. |title= Challenges in the development and use of ecological indicators |journal= Ecological Indicators |year=2001 |volume=1|issue=1 |pages=3–10 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X01000036 |doi=10.1016/S1470-160X(01)00003-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general EA indicators can be divided into abiotic and biotic indicators. Due to the complexity of ecosystems and environmental processes, a set of indicators reflecting the many facets of ecosystems is needed. Chemical, physical, and biological indicators each have specific advantages and disadvantages for monitoring and assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Zonneveld |first=I.S. |title=Principles of bio-indication |journal=Environmental Monitoring and Assessment |publisher= Springer Netherlands |year=1983 |volume=3|issue=3 |pages=207–217 |doi=10.1007/BF00396213
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Abiotic component|Abiotic]]''' indicators, which may give information on the risks or threats from stressors to ecosystems &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Rapport | first=D. J. | year=1989 | title=What constitutes ecosystem health? | journal=Perspectives in Medicine and Biology | volume=30 | pages=120–133}}&lt;/ref&gt; are comparatively well correlated with sources of [[Pollution|pollutants]] and disturbances but may not reflect ecological end points in themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Suter |first=G. |title=Endpoints for regional ecological risk assessments |journal= Environmental Management |publisher= Springer New York |year=1990|volume=14|issue=1 |pages=9–23 |doi=10.1007/BF02394015
|bibcode = 1990EnMan..14....9S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Biotic component|Biotic]]''' indicators may reflect end points &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Kelly |first=J. |last2=Harwell |first2=M. |title=Indicators of ecosystem recovery |journal=Environmental Management |year=1990 |volume=14|issue=5 |pages=527–545 |doi=10.1007/BF02394708|bibcode = 1990EnMan..14..527K }}&lt;/ref&gt; and may be used to differentiate "healthy" from "sick" ecosystems. Correlation of biotic indicators with sources of pollutants and other disturbances is relatively difficult due to the complexity of environmental processes and the multitude of potential stressors.&lt;ref name=latour&gt;{{Citation |last=Latour |first=J. |last2=Groen |first2=C. |title= Ecological assessment of natural resources in agroecosystems of Dutch Lowland Peat area |journal=Environmental Management |year=1994 |volume=18|issue=3 |pages=455–464 |doi=10.1007/BF02393873|bibcode = 1994EnMan..18..455L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical appraisal:
* small number of indicators lead to fail considering the full complexity of the ecological system
* choice of ecological indicators depends on management programs that have vague long-term goals and objectives
* monitoring programs miss predominantly the scientific demand (lack of defined protocol for identifying ecological indicators)&lt;ref name="Dale"/&gt;

==Types of ecological assessment==
'''Strategic ecological assessment (SEcA)''' is required to ensure that proposed new developments are compatible with international obligations to conserve protected habitats and their associated species. In common with all forms of Environmental Impact Assessment, the effectiveness of SEcA depends on the ability to define the proposed action or set of actions and to characterize the receiving environment (baseline conditions). The ability to quantify potential impacts and to estimate their risk of occurrence is strongly dependent on the
* availability
* accuracy
* reliability and
* resolution
of national data on the distributions of habitats, species and development proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Muchoney |first=D.M. |last2=Grossman |first2=D. H. |first3=R. |last3=Solomon |title=Rapid Ecological Assessment for conservation planning |journal=Technical papers ACSM-ASPRS annual convention |year=1991 |volume=4 |pages=141–145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. [[The Nature Conservancy|Nature Conservancy]] has developed '''Rapid Ecological Assessment (REA)''', an integrated methodology to provide the multiple scale, up-to-date information required to guide conservation actions. REA relies on analysis of aerial photography, videography, and satellite image data to identify conservation sites and to direct field sampling and research for cost-effective biological and ecological data acquisitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Krotscheck |first=C. |last2=König |first2=F. H. |first3=I. |last3=Obernberger |title=Ecological assessment of integrated bioenergy systems using the Sustainable Process Index |journal=Biomass and Bioenergy |year=2000 |volume=18 |pages=341–368 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0961953499000963 |doi=10.1016/S0961-9534(99)00096-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals==
The goal of EA is to understand the structure and function of ecosystems in order to develop improved management options. Furthermore, developing models to predict the response of ecosystems to changes contributes to finding a particular management strategy.
The results of the EA will be used to suggest possible improvements of the pollutant´s properties to reduce the potential environmental impacts.&lt;ref name=geldermann&gt;{{Citation |last=Geldermann |first=J. |last2=Gabriel |first2=R. |first3=O. |last3=Rentz |title=Ecological assessment of the environmental impacts of the kerosene burning in jet turbines and its improvement assessment |journal=Environmental Science and Pollution Research |year=1999 |volume=6 |pages=115–121 |doi=10.1007/BF02987564}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Agriculture&lt;ref name=latour /&gt;

==Ecological assessment in the U.S.==
The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] has set a definition for EA. Ecological assessment is a “qualitative or quantitative assessment of the actual or potential effects of a hazardous waste site on plants and animals other than people and domesticated species”. The methodologies used for EA noted down in the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA)are only vaguely defined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency |title=Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act |year=1980 |url=http://epw.senate.gov/cercla.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, assessment methods applied by both consultants and regulatory agencies range from qualitative approaches, such as listings of potential biotic receptors at a contaminated site, to fully quantitative approaches that include detailed exposure estimations, quantitative toxicity comparisons, and supplementary biota sampling to evaluate uptake estimates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Lemont |first=S. |last2=Eaton |first2=W. D. |first3=R. L. |last3=Wiley |title=The role of ecological assessments in the evaluation of contaminated sites |journal=Journal of Hazardous Materials |year=1993 |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=295–312 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0304389493800136 |doi=10.1016/0304-3894(93)80013-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eleanor Francis "Glo" Helin''' (née Francis,&lt;ref name=AngeloJosephEncyclopediaOfSoaceAndAstronomy /&gt; 19 November 1932 – 25 January 2009) was an American [[astronomer]]. She was principal investigator of the [[Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking]] (NEAT) program of NASA's [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]].&lt;ref name="Witimuseum" /&gt;&lt;ref name="post-gazette" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Palomar" /&gt; (Some sources give her name as '''Eleanor Kay Helin'''.) She retired in 2002.

Helin is a prolific [[discoverer of minor planets]] ''(see [[#List of discovered minor planets|list]])'' and several [[comet]]s, including periodic comets [[111P/Helin–Roman–Crockett]], [[117P/Helin–Roman–Alu]] and [[132P/Helin–Roman–Alu]]. She is credited as the discoverer of the object now known as both asteroid [[4015 Wilson–Harrington]] and comet [[107P/Wilson–Harrington]]. Although Wilson and [[Robert George Harrington|Harrington]] preceded her by some decades, their observations did not establish an [[orbit]] for the object, while her rediscovery did.

== Professional life ==

Helin was active in planetary science and astronomy at the [[California Institute of Technology]] and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for over three decades. In the early 1970s, she initiated the [[Palomar Planet-Crossing Asteroid Survey]] (PCAS) from [[Palomar Observatory]]. This program is responsible for the discovery of thousands of asteroids of all types including more than 200 in high [[inclination]] orbits, other asteroids in rare and unique types of orbits, 20 comets, and approximately 30 percent of the [[near-Earth asteroid]]s discovered worldwide.

Helin organized and coordinated the [[International Near-Earth Asteroid Survey]] (INAS) during the 1980s, encouraging and stimulating worldwide interest in asteroids. In recognition of her accomplishments, she received NASA's Exceptional Service Medal.

After conducting the PCAS photographic search program from Palomar for nearly 25 years, Helin concentrated on the new, upgraded [[Near Earth Asteroid Tracking]] (NEAT) search program using electronic sensors on a large aperture telescope. She was the principal investigator for this program operating from JPL, for which she received the 1997 JPL Award for Excellence. She also received NASA's Group Achievement Award for the NEAT Team.

In operation since December 1995, NEAT is the first autonomous observing program; no JPL personnel are on-site, only the JPL Sunspark computer which runs the observing system through the night and transmits the data back to JPL each morning for team member review and confirmation. NEAT has detected over 26,000 objects, including 31 near-Earth asteroids, two long period comets and the unique object, [[1996 PW]], the most [[eccentricity (orbit)|eccentric]] asteroid known (e = 0.99012940), which moves in a long-period (4110.50 [[julian year (astronomy)|a]]), comet-like orbit ([[semi-major axis]] 256.601 [[astronomical unit|AU]]).

Caltech Optical Observatories hosted a Helin Commemorative Workshop on 28 September 2010 to honour the contributions of Eleanor and Ronald Helin.&lt;ref name="Commemorative-Workshop" /&gt; Palomar Observatory opened an exhibit dedicated to her and her work with the 18-inch Schmidt telescope in September 2013.&lt;ref name="Palomar" /&gt;

== Awards and honors ==

The Mars-crossing asteroid [[3267 Glo]],  discovered by [[Edward Bowell]] in 191, was named after her nickname.&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt; The official naming citation was published by the [[Minor Planet Center]] on 13 February 1987 ({{small|[[Minor Planet Circulars|M.P.C.]] 11641}}).&lt;ref name="MPC-Circulars-Archive" /&gt;

== Discoveries ==

Helin is credited by the [[Minor Planet Center]] with the discovery or co-discovered of more than 900 numbered minor planets, including the first two [[Aten asteroid]]s: [[2062 Aten]] and [[2100 Ra-Shalom]], which gave rise to this new orbital group of [[near-Earth objects]].&lt;ref name="MPC-Discoverers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt;

The reduction of expected energy use is a potential revenue source that may be manipulated to improve business performance and reduce waste and environmental impacts. 
In 2011, the World Economic Forum reported that personal, digital data is a new asset class, generating a new wave of opportunity for economic and societal value creation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_ITTC_PersonalDataNewAsset_Report_2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Due to dramatic advances in web-based monitoring, real-time data analytics and utilities using peak pricing, energy reduction is now becoming a tangible asset that companies can measure, manage, procure and sell. 
For energy reduction, capturing data is the means to tap into energy savings, which, over time, become an asset. In order to implement efficiency measures and generate revenue streams, it is important to determine areas of least efficiency. This will provide the platform for accurately focusing efforts to achieve the greatest returns on investment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hwm-water.com/blog/post/intelligent-efficiency-turning-data-and-energy-efficiency-into-valuable-assets/&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Energy Reduction Assets''' (ERAs) are revenue streams that are created by tracking the unspent portion of traditional energy usage.{{clarify|date=December 2015}}

==Generating an Energy Reduction Asset==

There are two ways to generate an energy reduction asset: through an energy efficiency project or by participating in a demand response program. Energy efficiency results in long-term savings, while Demand Response programs produce immediate earnings/revenue streams. 

Energy efficiency projects have proven to be valuable to organizations in cost savings, as well as in reducing the carbon footprint, conservation and other positive environmental impacts. Energy efficiency measures include building control upgrades, updating HVAC, lighting and mechanical systems that use less energy per unit of service they provide. Essentially, these measures aim to reduce the amount of energy needed to supply a particular service, which means less energy is used and [http://energy.gov/articles/resolve-save-energy-year less money is spent]. Companies/consumers can use the money saved over time through energy efficiency, as assets to sell and invest in the market. 

[[Demand response|Demand Response]] programs are similar to energy efficiency projects; however, they result in immediate short-term energy reduction, along with immediate earnings from the energy saved. Demand Response is the process of curtailing an energy load ([[load shedding]]) during peak energy demand hours. Historically, Demand Response has played a vital role in emergency situations that create an imbalance on the energy grid, resulting in power outages and extreme costs. In recent years however, the market for Demand Response has been transforming into a demand management system whereby automated energy management systems (known as Automated Demand Response) and market developments make it possible for companies to earn money for modifying their electricity usage year-round.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/joule-assets-marries-demand-response-energy-efficiency-and-financing&lt;/ref&gt;

These “earnings” are the ERAs generated through reduced energy usage during peak demand hours. In essence, the market for demand response stems from the end users ability to “sell” the energy not used when they curtail usage—at the same prices as real megawatts of generated electricity. This process of selling a theoretical unit of power—the [[negawatt]]—that represents the amount of energy saved during a demand response program. When the electricity provider does not have to provide x amount of megawatts to their customer, then that customer essentially gets paid for that as if they sold it to someone else in the market. Thus, revenue streams are generated through this process of curtailing an energy load at peak demand hours.

== Growing success of energy efficiency industry ==
Utilizing new technologies to gather data and implement energy efficiency measures is key to generating ERAs. The environmental and economic benefits of reducing energy usage are becoming increasingly apparent throughout the country. [[Energy Service Companies]] (ESCOs) have grown the market for energy efficiency from $500 million in 1990 to over $5 billion in 2011. According to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, revenues will continue to increase—doubling or even tripling to $15.3 billion by the end of the decade.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/How-the-ESCO-Market-for-Efficiency-Can-Continue-Expanding&lt;/ref&gt; These growing revenues are a significant representation of the improving energy efficiency market. However, energy efficiency remains critically underutilized in the nation’s energy portfolio. It is time to take advantage of the data and programs available to capture the savings that energy efficiency offers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/cleanenergy/documents/suca/cost-effectiveness.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Energy in Belarus''' describes [[World energy resources and consumption|energy]] and [[Electricity generation|electricity]] production, consumption and import in [[Belarus]]. Belarus is a net energy importer. According to [[International Energy Agency|IEA]], the energy import exceeded the [[energy consumption|energy use]] in 2008. Primary energy use in Belarus was 327 TWh or 34 TWh per million persons in 2008.&lt;ref name=IEA2010&gt;[http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2010/key_stats_2010.pdf IEA Key energy statistics 2010] Page: Country specific indicator numbers from page 48&lt;/ref&gt;

Primary energy use per capita in Belarus in 2009 (34 MWh) was slightly more than in [[Energy in Portugal|Portugal]] (26 MWh) and about half of the use in [[Energy in Belgium|Belgium]] (64 MWh) or [[Energy in Sweden|Sweden]] (62 MWh).&lt;ref name="IEA2010"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4995">Energy use in [[Rwanda]] is undergoing rapid change at the beginning of the 21st century. 

==Electricity==
===Network===
The extent of grid electricity is limited and mainly concentrated near Kigali. Most of the country uses [[firewood]] as its main energy source. 
Rwanda is planning to expand from 218 MW of grid power in 2018 to 586 MW in 2024 and may import as much some additional from neighboring countries. In addition, it is installing small solar units throughout the country to ensure electricity to buildings not connected to the national grid, or to help deal with power outages. Currently, the government plans to bring electricity access to 100% of the population by 2024, as opposed to 48.6% in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reg.rw/what-we-do/access|title=Electricity Access|first=Jun|last=Feng|publisher=|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Generation===
With its limited electrical infrastructure, Rwanda has a very high degree of [[renewable energy]] usage. Most of the country's electricity comes from [[hydropower]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.panapress.com/Solar-power-stations-to-supply-Rwandan-schools-with-electricity--13-798739-17-lang2-index.html Solar power stations to supply Rwandan schools with electricity], PANA, 6 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; 
Electrical production accounted for 4% of energy use in the country in 2014, 

====Hydroelectricity====
53% of electricity generated by hydropower. At the end of 2016, Rwanda's grid-connected power plants supplied 208MW.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newtimes.co.rw/section/read/216019/|title=Renewed drive to increase power generation capacity|last=Kuteesa|first=Hudson|work=The New Times Rwanda|access-date=2017-08-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gas fired generation====
[[KivuWatt Power Station|KivuWatt project]] is an energy project to extract natural gas dissolved in Lake Kivu and use the extracted gas to generate electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wartsila.com/twentyfour7/gas/killer-lake-renewable-potential|title=Killer lake's renewable potential|last=|first=|date=|website=www.wartsila.com/twentyfour7|publisher=Twentyfour7|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the operational 25MW power plant is able to provide enough energy for 45,000 people in Rwanda. The ongoing expansion project is expected to add 26MW of generating capacity in its first phase, and eventually scale up to 100MW in the coming years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wartsila.com/twentyfour7/gas/killer-lake-renewable-potential|title=Killer lake's renewable potential|last=|first=|date=|website=www.wartsila.com/twentyfour7|publisher=Twentyfour7|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
====Utility scale solar====
The first utility-scale solar farm in Sub-Saharan Africa outside of South Africa is the 8.5MW plant at Agahozo-Shalom Youth Village, in the [[Rwamagana District]], Eastern Province of [[Rwanda]]. It leased {{convert|20|hectare|acre}} of land from the village which is a charity to house and educate [[Rwandan genocide]] victims. The plant uses  28,360 [[photovoltaic panel]]s and produces 6% of total electrical supply of the country. The project was built with U.S., Israeli, Dutch, Norwegian, Finnish and UK funding and expertise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/New-Tech/In-Rwanda-Israelis-and-Americans-launch-East-Africas-first-commercial-solar-field-390197 In Rwanda, Israelis and Americans launch East Africa’s first commercial solar field], ''Jeruslaem Post'', February 6, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
====Micro scale solar====
The use of off-grid [[solar power]] has increased as solar panel prices have fallen and many areas do not expect grid connections in the near future. 
[[Solar power]] produces over 2% of electricity in the country. The country is in the midst of a rapid expansion of its electrical grid and many new plants are proposed or under construction.
====Biomass==== 
[[Biomass]] is the most important energy source utilized through firewood and agricultural waste for cooking. In 2014, this represented 85% of Rwanda's energy use.&lt;ref name="Peat"&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/rwanda-prepares-to-switch-on-africas-first-peat-fired-power-plant-reports-kt-press-350348778.html Rwanda Prepares to Switch on Africa's First Peat Fired Power Plant, Reports KT Press], ''PRNewswire'', October 24, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peat]] from peat marshes in southwestern Rwanda will power two electrical plants. The first 15MW plant is expected online in 2015 with the second, a 80MW plant, expected in 2017.
==Other Energy ==
[[Petroleum]], mainly for transportation, represented 11% of Rwanda's power in 2014. Although Rwanda is thought to have [[crude oil]] and [[natural gas]] reserves near [[Lake Kivu]], as of 2014, there was no production of these resources and demand was met by imports.  The [[Kenya–Uganda–Rwanda Petroleum Products Pipeline]] would transport oil between these countries if it is built.

'''''Hatchet''''' is a 1987 [[Newbery Medal|Newbery]] Honor-winning [[Young adult novel|young-adult]] wilderness [[Survivalism|survival]] novel written by American writer [[Gary Paulsen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Greasley|first=Philip A.|title=Dictionary of Midwestern Literature, Volume 1: The Authors|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZnuYKJSoHCMC&amp;pg=PA403|date=30 May 2001|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-10841-1|page=403}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the first novel of five in the ''Hatchet'' series.

==Plot==
Brian Robeson is a thirteen-year-old son of divorced parents. As he travels from Hampton, New York on a [[Cessna 406]] bush plane to visit his father in the [[oil field]]s in [[Northern Canada]] for the summer, the pilot suffers a massive [[heart attack]] and dies. Brian tries to land the plane, but ends up crash-landing into a lake in the forest. He must learn to survive on his own with nothing but his hatchet—a gift his mother gave him shortly before his plane departed.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Paulsen|first1=Gary|title=Hatchet|date=1999|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=978-1-4169-3647-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the summer, Brian learns how to survive in the vast wilderness with only his hatchet. He discovers how to make fire with the hatchet and eats whatever food he can find, such as rabbits, birds, turtle eggs, fish, berries, and fruit. He deals with various threats of nature, including mosquitos, a [[North American porcupine|porcupine]], bear, skunk, [[western moose|moose]], [[Arctic wolf|wolves]], and even a tornado. Over time, Brian develops his survival skills and becomes a fine woodsman. He crafts a bow, arrows, and a fishing spear to aid in his hunting. He also fashions a shelter out of the underside of a rock overhang. During his time alone, Brian struggles with memories of home and the bittersweet memory of his mother, whom Brian had caught cheating on his father prior to their divorce.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;

When a sudden tornado hits the area, it draws the tail of the plane toward the shore of the lake. This triggers his thoughts that there may be a survival pack of some sorts on the plane. Brian makes a raft from a few broken off tree tops to get to the plane. When Brian is cutting his way into the tail of the plane, he drops his hatchet in the lake and dives in to get it. Once inside the plane, Brian finds a survival pack that includes additional food, an emergency transmitter, and a [[.22 caliber|.22 ]] [[AR-7| AR-7 rifle]]. Back on shore, Brian activates the transmitter, but not knowing how to use it, he thinks it is broken and throws it aside. However, his distress call is heard by a passing airplane, and he is rescued. Brian spends the remainder of the summer with his father but does not disclose his mother's affair.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;

==Legacy==
A film adaptation titled ''[[A Cry in the Wild]]'' was released in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dGYzZLrBrS4C&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;pg=PA282#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Animal Movies Guide | publisher=Running Free Press | author=Wilson, Staci Layne | year=2007 | pages=282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paulsen continued the story of Brian Robeson with four more novels, beginning with ''[[The River (Paulsen novel)|The River]]'' in 1991.

==Awards and nominations==
''Hatchet'' was a recipient of the 1988 Newbery Honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Newbery Medal and Honor Books, 1922-Present|url=http://www.ala.org/alsc/awardsgrants/bookmedia/newberymedal/newberyhonors/newberymedal#80s|website=Association for Library Service to Children|publisher=The American Library Association|accessdate=May 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Head cut''', in [[stream]] [[geomorphology]], is an [[erosion|erosional]] feature of some [[intermittent stream|intermittent]] and [[perennial stream|perennial]] [[stream]]s with an abrupt vertical drop, also known as a [[knickpoint]], in the stream bed. The knickpoint, where a head cut begins, can be as small as an overly-steep [[riffle]] zone or as a large as a [[waterfall]]. When it is not flowing, the head cut will resemble a very short [[cliff]] or [[feeder bluff|bluff]]. A small [[plunge pool]] may be present at the base of the head cut due to the high energy of falling water. As erosion of the knickpoint and the streambed continues, the head cut will migrate upstream.&lt;ref&gt;Wilcox, J. et al., Feather River Resource Management Group.  December 2001.  
Evaluation of geomorphic restoration techniques applied to fluvial systems.  
Available from: http://www.feather-rivercrm.org/publications/preports/georest/cover.html.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Groundwater [[seep (hydrology)|seeps]] and [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]] are sometimes found along the face, sides, or base of a head cut.&lt;ref&gt;North Carolina Division of Water Quality, "Identification Methods for the Origins of Intermittent and Perennial Streams, Version 3.1", February 28, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stream channel|Channel]] incision is very common when head cuts are involved in stream morphology. In terms of stream restoration, head cuts are one of the most difficult challenges. Installing [[check dam]]s or elevating the stream by filling the gully are common ways to mitigate up stream migration of the knickpoint. Another common way to control the knickpoint is by sloping the bank face by laying down fabric and rock.

'''Instituto Butantan''' (in modern [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], '''Instituto Butantã'''&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Butantan ou Butantã? Instituto Butantã ou Butantan?|url = http://dicionarioegramatica.com.br/2015/12/12/butantan-ou-butanta-instituto-butanta-ou-butantan/|website = DicionarioeGramatica.com|accessdate = 2015-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;, {{IPA-pt|ĩʃtʃiˈtutu butɐ̃ˈtɐ̃|pron}}) is a [[Brazil]]ian [[biologic medical product|biologic]] research center located in Butantã, in the western part of the city of São Paulo, Brazil. '''Instituto Butantan''' is a public institution affiliated with the [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] State Secretariat of [[Health]] and considered one of the major scientific centers in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Butantan Institute: History and Future Perspectives|journal = PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases|date = 2014-07-03|issn = 1935-2727|pmc = 4080994|pmid = 24992341|volume = 8|issue = 7|doi = 10.1371/journal.pntd.0002862|first = Marcelo|last = De Franco|first2 = Jorge|last2 = Kalil}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Butantan''' is the largest immunobiologicals and biopharmaceuticals producer in Latin America (and one of the largest in the world). It is world-renowned for its collection of venomous snakes, as well as those of venomous lizards, [[spider]]s, [[insect]]s and [[scorpion]]s. By extracting the reptiles' and insects' venoms, the Institute develops antivenoms and medicines against many diseases, which include tuberculosis, rabies, tetanus and diphtheria.

== History ==
The Institute was founded by the Brazilian [[physician]] and biomedical scientist [[Vital Brazil]] in 1901, according to [[Pasteur Institute]] paradigm, i.e., by combining in the same institution [[medical research]], the transfer of the results to society as health products, and self-financing through this later activity. Its foundation was a reaction to the outbreak of [[bubonic plague]] in the city of [[Santos, São Paulo|Santos]].&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;  It is internationally renowned for its research on [[venom (poison)|venomous]] animals; it was visited by [[Theodore Roosevelt]] in 1912. It is also a state-supported producer of [[vaccine]]s against many [[infectious diseases]], such as [[rabies]], [[hepatitis]], [[botulism]], [[tetanus]], [[diphtheria]], [[pertussis]] and [[tuberculosis]], as well as polyvalent and monovalent [[antivenom]]s against the bites of [[snakes]], [[lizards]], [[bees]], [[scorpion]]s and [[spider]]s (which, historically were first developed in the beginning of the 20th century by Dr. Vital Brazil and his coworkers).  Among the distinguished scientists at the institute were biochemists [[Karl Slotta]] and [[Heinz Fraenkel-Conrat]], pioneers in the study of progesterone, estriol, and medical use of venom, from 1935 to 1948.

A fire in 2010 destroyed the collection facility, which maintained one of the largest collections of venomous animals in the world, comprising around 80,000 snake specimens, and an estimated 450,000 spiders and scorpions.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

The name of the institute comes from "''Butantã''",&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; a district in the west zone of São Paulo. "''Butantã''" itself is a [[Tupian languages|Tupi]] word&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; meaning "''crushed soil''".

== Education and research ==

The Institute develops basic and applied biomedical research in many areas, including [[molecular biology]], [[immunology]] and [[epidemiology]] and has a graduate research training program in collaboration with other institutions, in the areas of biotechnology and [[infectology]]. Besides its research laboratories, production units and specialized library, it operates an animal breeding center for providing subjects for research and production of sera.  The Instituto Butantan also operate the "Hospital Vital Brazil", a specialist hospital that offers free treatment for poisonous animal stings and bites. The institute also accepts donations of serpents, arthropods and other animals captured by the public and by a network of collaborating centers and individuals.

The following research laboratories are part of the Butantan Institute:
* [[Arthropod]]s
* [[Herpetology]]
* [[Cellular biology]]
* [[Immunogenetics]]
* [[Immunopathology]]
* [[Virus|Viral]] [[Immunology]]
* [[Immunochemistry]]
* [[Genetics]]
* [[Dermatology]]
* [[Pathophysiology]]
* [[Biochemistry]] and [[Biophysics]]
* [[Pharmacology]]
* [[Microbiology]]
* [[Parasitology]]
* [[Biopharmaceutical]]s
* Applied [[Toxinology]]
* [[Biotechnology]] Center

Important Brazilian scientists who have worked in the Butantan Institute are: [[Vital Brazil]], [[Afrânio Pompílio Gastos do Amaral]], [[Isaias Raw]], [[Samuel Pessoa]], [[Willy Beçak]]. The Institute has strong collaborative ties with the [[Pasteur Institute]], [[Paris]], France, and with the [[Oswaldo Cruz Foundation]], [[Rio de Janeiro]].

== Production ==
The Butantan Institute is the largest producer in [[Latin America]] (and one of the largest in the world) of immunobiologicals and biopharmaceuticals. In 2001 it produced ca. {{Nowrap|110 million}} doses of vaccines and {{Nowrap|300 thousand}} vials of hyperimmune sera. The institute is responsible for the production of 90% of the vaccines used in Brazil.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;  The institute contains a venom farm where researchers milk around a thousand snakes for their [[venom]] which is used to make [[antivenom]]s and for medical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Eveleigh|1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The production units manufacture the following bioproducts:

=== Hyperimmune sera and antivenoms ===
* Anti-[[Bothrops|Bothropic]]
* Anti-[[Rattlesnake|Crotalic]]
* Anti-Bothropic-Crotalic
* Anti-[[Elapidae|Elapidic]]
* Anti-Bothropic-[[Bushmaster (snake)|Lachetic]]
* Anti-[[Scorpion|Escorpionic]]
* Anti-[[Spiders|Arachnidic]]
* Anti-[[Lonomia]]
* Anti-Africanized [[Bee]]
* Anti-[[Diphtheria|Diphtheric]]
* Anti-[[Tetanus|Tetanic]]
* Anti-[[Botulism|Botulinic]] A, B, E

== Public activities ==
The Butantan Institute is one of the major touristic and educational attractions in a vast park area in the city section of [[Butantã (district of São Paulo)|Butantã]] in São Paulo. It has a [[serpentarium]], a historical museum, a biological museum, and a museum of microbiology. The venom farm is a major attraction and visitors can see the snakes housed in representations of their natural environments. The park also contains rare tree types.

== Butantan Foundation ==
The '''Fundação Butantan''' is a non-profit corporation established in 1984 to use more efficiently public funds and capital investments made by the Ministry of Health for the production of immunobiologicals. The Foundation reinvests part of the proceeds to build new facilities for new products. Part of the funds are used in the Institute for research and cultural activities, as well as to provide its workers with meals and basic food supplies.

== 2010 fire ==
On May 15, 2010, a fire almost burned down the laboratory and destroyed the Institute's entire collection of snake specimens (approximately 85,000 specimens preserved with [[formaldehyde]] and stored in 70% [[ethanol]]) and ca. 450,000–500,000 specimens of scorpions and spiders (also stored in ethanol).&lt;ref name="number specimens destroyed"/&gt; It was one of the largest collections of snakes in the world.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; Over 90 years of research were lost.

The fire started at {{Nowrap|7:08 am}} and was brought under control by a crew of 50 firemen an hour and a half later.&lt;ref name="fire put out"/&gt;  News reports have claimed that the facility was not prepared for a fire, not having a [[fire alarm]] or [[fire sprinkler system|sprinkler system]].&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;  Police are investigating the fire which has been described by curator Francisco Franco as "a loss for humanity".&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;  None of the live animals or people at the institute was harmed by the fire.&lt;ref name="live animals unharmed"/&gt;

'''Lourdes water''' is water which flows from a spring in the Grotto of Massabielle in the [[Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes]], [[France]]. The location of the spring was described to [[Bernadette Soubirous]] by an apparition of [[Our Lady of Lourdes]] on 25 February 1858. Since that time many thousands of pilgrims to Lourdes have followed the instruction of Our Lady of Lourdes to "drink at the spring and bathe in it". Lourdes water is considered non-liturgical [[holy water]].

Although never formally encouraged by the Church, Lourdes water has become a focus of devotion to the Virgin Mary at Lourdes. Since the supposed apparitions, many people have claimed to have been cured by drinking or bathing in it,&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Harris, ''Lourdes: Body and Spirit in the Secular Age'', [[Penguin Books]], 1999, p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Lourdes authorities provide it free of charge to any who ask for it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lourdes-france.org/index.php?goto_centre=ru&amp;id=467&amp;contexte=en&amp;mot=water Shipping of Water from the Spring ]. Lourdes-France.org (2003-10-21). Retrieved on 2011-09-19.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Chemical analysis==
An analysis of the water was commissioned by Anselme Lacadé in 1858. It was conducted by a professor in [[Toulouse]], who determined that the water was [[potable]] and that it contained the following: [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], [[carbonic acid]], [[carbonates]] of lime and magnesia, a trace of carbonate of [[iron]], an alkaline carbonate or silicate, [[chloride]]s of [[potassium]] and [[sodium]], traces of [[sulphates]] of potassium and soda, traces of [[ammonia]], and traces of [[iodine]].&lt;ref name="civil"&gt;[http://www.nd.edu/~wcawley/corson/lourdes4.htm Lourdes 4]. Nd.edu. Retrieved on 2011-09-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, the water is quite pure and inert. Lacadé had hoped that Lourdes water might have special mineral properties which would allow him to develop Lourdes into a spa town, to compete with neighbouring [[Cauterets]] and [[Bagnères-de-Bigorre]].&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Harris, ''Lourdes: Body and Spirit in the Secular Age'', Penguin Books, 1999, p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bathing==
Primitive makeshift bathing installations were constructed in the 1850s by local builders. Until 1880 there were only two pools, filled by a manual pump. In 1880, a wooden bathing-house containing fourteen pools ("''piscines''") was constructed.&lt;ref name="autogenerated313"&gt;Ruth Harris, ''Lourdes: Body and Spirit in the Secular Age'', Penguin Books, 1999, p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt;

The French author [[Émile Zola]] visited the Sanctuary in 1891 and again in 1892. He wrote:
:And the water was not exactly inviting. The Grotto Fathers were afraid that the output of the spring would be insufficient, so in those days they had the water in the pools changed just twice a day. As some hundred patients passed through the same water, you can imagine what a horrible slop it was at the end. There was everything in it: threads of blood, sloughed-off skin, scabs, bits of cloth and bandage, an abominable soup of ills... the miracle was that anyone emerged alive from this human slime.&lt;ref&gt;Émile Zola, ''Lourdes'', 1894, quoted in Ruth Harris, ''Lourdes: Body and Spirit in the Secular Age'', Penguin Books, 1999, p. 337.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1897 Jubilee Pilgrimage to Lourdes, priest François Picard was thirsty after a long day. Rather than drinking fresh water, he asked an assistant to fill his glass from a bathing pool, heavily contaminated from the sick pilgrims who had been immersed in it. "When the father had received [the water], he made the sign of the cross and drank slowly, right to the end. Then, he gave back the glass and concluded with a smile: "The water of the good Mother of Heaven is always delicious."&lt;ref&gt;A. Pépin, "Le Père François Picard: directeur de l'association de Notre-Dame de Salut at des pèlerinages nationaux", ''Pages d'archives'' no.3 (November 1963) p. 225, quoted in Ruth Harris, ''Lourdes: Body and Spirit in the Secular Age'', Penguin Books, 1999, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next set of ''piscines'' was completed in 1891, and tiled in the Virgin's blue.&lt;ref name="autogenerated313"/&gt; This building was located near to where the water taps are now and can be seen on old photographs of the Domain.

The current baths were constructed in 1955, and upgraded in 1972 and 1980. There are seventeen separate bath cubicles, eleven for women and six for men. Each year about 350,000 people use the baths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lourdes-france.org/index.php?goto_centre=ru&amp;contexte=en&amp;id=434 In the Baths]. Lourdes-France.org (2003-10-21). Retrieved on 2011-09-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The water is not heated and is usually cold; the temperature is around 12&amp;nbsp;°C (54&amp;nbsp;°F). The immersion lasts around a minute, during which time prayers are recited and veneration of a statue of the Virgin is encouraged. Able-bodied pilgrims are aided by one or two volunteer attendants, but immobile pilgrims sometimes require much more physical help.  The water in each bath is constantly being topped up and refreshed via a pump. It is now constantly circulated and purified by irradiation.&lt;ref&gt;According to one of the chaplains interviewed in the 2008 EWTN documentary ''The Lourdes Experience''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern times==
[[File:Lourdes-Center-Boston.jpg|right|thumb|Operated by the [[Marist Fathers]], The Lourdes Center in [[Kenmore Square]] ([[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]) was established in 1950 by [[Cardinal Richard J. Cushing]] and [[Bishop]] [[Pierre-Marie Theas]] to distribute Lourdes water in the [[United States]].]]

Lourdes water flows from a spring in the Grotto at the same spot where it was discovered by [[Bernadette Soubirous|Bernadette]]. At maximum, the water flows at 40 litres per minute.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Todd, ''The Lourdes Pilgrim'', Matthew James Publishing, 2003, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; The water is collected in a cistern, and dispensed via a system of taps near the shrine, where pilgrims may drink it or collect it in bottles or other containers to take with them. The original spring can be seen within the Grotto, lit from below, and protected by a glass screen.

Over the last few years the system of taps has been progressively altered. As of 2008, water is dispensed from a series of taps set into stone in a circle around the base of one of the smaller towers of the Upper Basilica.

In 2002 the Water Walk was introduced, across the Gave and slightly downstream from the Grotto. It consists of a series of nine stations at which there is a small Lourdes water font. The stations form a walkway along the Gave which can be followed in either direction. As they walk, pilgrims are invited to wash or drink, and meditate on passages from the Bible. Each station carries one of the titles of the Virgin Mary, such as "Queen of the Apostles", "Mother of Good Counsel", and "Our Lady of Light".&lt;ref&gt;''Lourdes: A People from Every Nation'', Service Promotion des Sanctuaires Notre-Dame de Lourdes, 2002, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, pilgrims collect gallons of water at the taps to be given to family and friends unable to make the trip to Lourdes. As of summer 2007, [[Mistral Air]] passengers on pilgrimage to Lourdes were forbidden to bring containers of water on the plane. Officials at [[Tarbes]] Airport said this was in keeping with new anti-[[terrorism]] regulations about liquids following the [[2006 transatlantic aircraft plot]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6969748.stm Air pilgrims face holy water ban]. BBC News, 2007-08-29, retrieved 2008-07-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alleged medical properties==
Many believers experience Lourdes water as helping to improve their health, but there is a risk that sick people may stop taking scientifically based treatments if they have too much confidence in [[Placebo effect|placebos]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2004/sep/30/scienceinterviews.health Miracle worker | Society]. The Guardian. 30 September 2004. Retrieved on 2011-09-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Saint Bernadette herself said that people were healed by their faith and prayers. {{cn|date=January 2018}}

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7804">'''Machlett Laboratories''' was a Northeastern United States-based company that manufactured X-ray and high-power vacuum tubes.  Machlett was a large producer of the tubes and developed accessories to be used with them as well.

For its contributions to World War II efforts, the US government gave it an "E" award in 1945. The company was bought by Varian in 1989.

==History==
The company began as E. Machlett and Son, which was founded in 1897 in [[New York City]], [[United States]] as scientific glass makers.

===Early days===
Machlett Laboratories was created from E. Machlett &amp; Sons in order to exploit the then new technology of [[X-rays]]. They made X-ray tubes from the beginning to 1989 when they were bought by [[Varian Associates|Varian]]. In addition to making X-ray tubes, they manufactured high-power [[vacuum tubes]] for use in [[radio]] and [[TV]] [[broadcasting]] (857B mercury-vapor half-wave rectifier tube) and for industrial [[induction heating]]. Those two sides of the business were about equivalent for most of the life of the company.

Machlett Laboratories, Inc. was established on Hope Street and Camp Avenue in 1934. This manufacturing operation began making X-ray tubes and became the largest producer of its kind in the world. Raymond was president of the company, founded by his father Robert, a scientist who made the first practical X-ray tube in America and devoted his life to making it safe and successful in the field of medicine. Robert Machlett associated with Madame Curie and other leading roentgenologists to make this happen.

They moved to 1063 Hope St. in [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Connecticut]], in the early 20th century, and remained there. Among their achievements was a counter made by them for [[Irène Joliot-Curie|Irene]] and [[Frédéric Joliot-Curie|Frederic Joliot-Curie]] for use in their experiments on artificial [[radioactivity]] in 1934 which is currently contained in the [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]] in Great Britain. They were given an “E” award by the US government in 1945 for their contribution to the war effort.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stamfordhistory.org/ww2_machlett.htm] no longer at 1063 Hope St.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products==
===Transmitting tubes===
[[File:Machlett 298A radio transmission tube.JPG|thumb|Machlett Labs 298A radio transmission tube, ca. 1958.  This was the largest transmission tube made.  This one is on display at the Georgia Museum of Radio History in St. Marys, GA, USA.]]
Machlett was well known for its rather complete line of transmitting tubes, most particularly [[triode]]s.

For quite a while, Machlett's 6697s&lt;ref&gt;http://www.datasheetarchive.com/ML-6697A-datasheet.html&lt;/ref&gt; were the most-used Class B modulator tubes (as a push-pull pair) and Class C final tubes (as a single-ended pair) in 50,000-watt plate-modulated AM transmitters.

In a classical [[Doherty amplifier]] (a Class B "carrier" tube and a Class C "peak" tube), 50,000 watts could be achieved using only two 6697s, but the drive requirement was about 5,000 watts, so the driver was often a complete 5,000-watt transmitter. The driver power could be "passed through" (i.e., was not dissipated as heat) if the carrier tube was operated with a grounded grid and, as before, the peak tube was operated with a grounded cathode.&lt;ref&gt;Continental Electronics 317B&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, chief competitor [[Eimac]] released [[tetrode]]s which rather quickly eclipsed Machlett's triodes, as tetrodes have higher gain (thereby requiring much lower driver power, usually about 1,000 watts for 50,000 watts out), and do not require "neutralization". And tetrodes can be screen-grid modulated, especially in a Sainton-modified Doherty amplifier,&lt;ref&gt;{{Ref patent

}}&lt;/ref&gt; where both the "carrier" and "peak" tubes may be operated in Class C.&lt;ref&gt;Continental Electronics 317C&lt;/ref&gt;

6697s were also employed in RCA's upgraded [[Ampliphase]] transmitter, the BTA-50H.

[[CPI International|CPI]]'s Econo division remanufactures Eimac and Machlett power tubes.

===X-ray tubes===
They were the first company to utilize the concept of the rotating anode, something which is just about universal in medical X-ray systems at this date. Towards the end of the time of manufacture, they were producing oil-circulating X-ray tubes with a [[heat exchanger]]  attached (for use with [[computed tomography]] (CT) scanners), with 5-inch diameter rotating anodes formed from tungsten-rhenium alloy and [[molybdenum]], with a large mass of [[graphite]] attached to act as a [[heat sink]]. Smaller tubes without graphite heat sinks had highly radiative coatings to disperse the generated heat into the oil surrounding the tube itself.

The manufacture of X-ray tubes was licensed to two other companies, [[GEC Medical]] and Comet SA of [[Bern]] in [[Switzerland]].

====Machlett X-ray tube====
The Machlett X-ray tube was produced to ‘provide electrostatic protection for the filament (cathode) so as to permit long life to be achieved at operating voltages in the range 100-300 kV’ i .
The X-ray tube was designed and manufactured by E. Machlett &amp; Son who were specialists in scientific glass instruments. The American company, which was established in New York 1897, began as a single shop and soon grew into an internationally recognized firm. The Machlett X-ray tube was patented in April 1934; one of its tubes, at the University of Melbourne's School of Physics, is from 1937. These X-ray tubes may have been used by Professor T.H Laby’s X-ray group, which was a priority research topic there. This interest was sparked by the appointment in 1889 of Professor T. R. Lyle. Lyle, who was head of the school until 1915, is thought to have been the first person in Australia to have taken an X-ray photograph iii. A photocopy of this photograph can be found in the School of Physics Archive. For this particular experiment, Lyle actually made his own x-ray tube. His successor, Laby, continued to work with X-rays. During the 1920s he worked on the X-ray spectra of atoms and in 1930 he, along with Dr C. E. Eddy, published ''Quantitative Analysis by X-Ray Spectroscopy'' iv . Also with Eddy Laby produced the paper "Sensitivity of Atomic Analysis by X-rays". Laby went on to have an X-ray spectrograph of his own design manufactured by Adam Hilger Ltd.

===Accessories===
As well as X-ray tubes, they manufactured collimators – to define the beam size – and three marks of “Dynalyser” – an invasive instrument for measuring all the important parameters in an X-ray tube. This consisted of an HV unit insulated with [[Sulfur hexafluoride|SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]], and an indicating unit. A separate radiation monitor could be used with this, and an oscilloscope could also be attached to this device if desired. Some 2,500 of the most recent version were sold, and this device survived the sale of the company to Varian and later buyers, being in production from the early 1980s to around 1995.

There were three generations of the Dynalyzer produced. Maintenance on the Dynalyzer is available by its inventor, Dr. Jon Shapiro, at http://giciman.com

'''Map matching''' is the problem of how to match recorded geographic coordinates to a logical model of the real world, typically using some form of [[Geographic Information System]]. The most common approach is to take recorded, serial location points (e.g. from [[GPS]]) and relate them to edges in an existing street [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] (network), usually in a sorted list representing the travel of a user or vehicle. Matching observations to a logical model in this way has applications in [[Automotive navigation system|satellite navigation]], [[GPS tracking unit|GPS tracking of freight]], and [[transportation engineering]].

Map matching algorithms can be divided in [[Real-time computing|real-time]] and offline algorithms. Real-time algorithms associate the position during the recording process to the road network. Offline algorithms are used after the data is recorded and are then matched to the road network.&lt;ref name="Pereira2009"&gt;{{cite journal |title=An off-line map-matching algorithm for incompletemap databases |journal=Springer |date=2009-09-11 |last=Pereira |first=Francisco Câmara |last2=Costa |first2=Hugo |last3= Pereira |first3=Nuno Martinho |url=https://www.academia.edu/1869728/An_off-line_map-matching_algorithm_for_incomplete_map_databases |accessdate=2014-11-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Real-time applications can only calculate based upon the points prior to a given time (as opposed to those of a whole journey), but are intended to be used in 'live' environments. This brings a compromise of performance over accuracy. Offline applications can consider all points and so can tolerate slower performance in favour of accuracy.

== Examples and use cases ==
Uses for map-matching algorithms range from the immediate and practical, such as applications designed for guiding travellers, to the analytical, such as generating detailed inputs for traffic analysis models and the like.

Probably the most common use of map-matching is where a traveller has some mobile computer giving him or her directions across a street network. In order to give accurate directions, the device must know exactly where in the street network the user is. A GPS location has positional error though, so picking the nearest street segment and routing from there will likely not work. Instead, the history of locations reported by the GPS can be used to guess a plausible route and infer the current location more accurately.

Other uses, more analytical in nature, include:
* extracting traffic flow information from vehicle GPS tracks
* associating user-reported attributes with a street
* automatically infer turn restrictions based on an analysis of multiple GPS tracks

== Implementation ==

'''Mark Diesendorf''' is an [[Australia]]n academic and environmentalist, known for his work in sustainable development and renewable energy.  He currently teaches environmental studies at the [[University of New South Wales]] (UNSW), Australia. He was formerly professor of environmental science and founding director of the Institute for Sustainable Futures at the [[University of Technology, Sydney]] and before that a principal research scientist with [[CSIRO]], where he was involved in early research on integrating [[Wind power in Australia|wind power]] into electricity grids. His most recent book is ''[[Sustainable Energy Solutions for Climate Change]]''.

== Biography ==

Diesendorf is the son of the engineer [[Walter Diesendorf]] and the poet [[Margaret Diesendorf]].  His PhD research was focused on applied mathematics and theoretical physics applied to the solar interior. His early postdoctoral research was diverse, including the analysis of ground and satellite data on VLF emissions, mechanisms of insect smell and vision, and biological catalysts. From 1975 to 1985 he worked in the [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation|CSIRO]] Division of Mathematics, the Australian national research organisation, on topics such as the integration of wind power into electricity grids.&lt;ref name=Silence&gt;Diesendorf M. (1996). [http://www.bmartin.cc/pubs/96ce/3_Diesendorf.pdf Fluoridation: breaking the silence barrier]. In: Martin B (ed.). ''Confronting the experts''. New York: State University of New York Press, pp.45–75.&lt;/ref&gt; He became a principal research scientist and leader of the Applied Mathematics group in CSIRO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vic.greens.org.au/get-involved/events/2007-events/may-2007-events/greenhouse-solutions-with-sustainable-energy Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy – Free symposium]&lt;/ref&gt; He left CSIRO in 1985 after the organisation had terminated all research on renewable energy. From 1996 to 2001 he was Professor of Environmental Science and Founding Director of the Institute for Sustainable Futures at UTS and then director of a company Sustainability Centre Pty Ltd.

From 2004 to 2016, Diesendorf has been a Senior Lecturer and then Associate Professor and Deputy Director of the [http://www.ies.unsw.edu.au Institute of Environmental Studies] at the [[University of NSW]], now called UNSW Australia. In 2015 IES was abolished by the university and Diesendorf retired (nominally) in mid-2016 to become Honorary Associate Professor at UNSW. He continues to teach (as a guest lecturer), research and consult in the interdisciplinary fields of [[sustainable energy]], [[sustainable transport|sustainable urban transport]], theory of [[sustainability]], [[ecological economics]], and practical processes by which government, business and other organisations can achieve ecologically sustainable and socially just development.&lt;ref name="ies"&gt;[http://www.ies.unsw.edu.au/about/staff/mark.htm UNSW Institute of Environmental Studies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070303125150/http://www.ies.unsw.edu.au/about/staff/mark.htm |date=3 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on his belief that science, technology and economics should serve the community at large, Dr Diesendorf has been at various times the Secretary of the Society for Social Responsibility in Science (Australian Capital Territory), President of the Australia New Zealand Society for Ecological Economics, co-founder and Vice-President of the Sustainable Energy Industries Council of Australia, and co-founder and President of the original Australasian Wind Energy Association.&lt;ref name="ies" /&gt;

Much of his recent and current research is on climate mitigation, especially transitioning electricity supply systems to 100% renewable energy. To this end he is involved with colleagues in the Centre for Energy &amp; Environmental Markets at UNSW in scenario development, computer simulation modelling and energy policy. Previously Dr Diesendorf was one of the leading proponents calling for the ethical, scientific debate over public [[water fluoridation]].&lt;ref&gt;Diesendorf, Mark. How science can illuminate ethical debates: A case study on water fluoridation. Fluoride. Vol 28, No. 2 87-104. 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;  On this issue Diesendorf has authored several papers, including a major 1986 article entitled "The mystery of declining tooth decay" in the journal ''Nature,'' examining the need for a scientific re-evaluation of fluoridation, and has highlighted some of the contrary evidence.&lt;ref name=Silence/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Allen Freeze and Jay H. Lehr. ''The Fluoride Wars'', John Wiley, 2009, p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nanogeoscience'''  is the study of nanoscale phenomena related to geological systems.  Predominantly, this is interrogated by studying environmental [[nanoparticles]] between 1-100 nanometers in size.  Other applicable fields of study include studying materials with at least one dimension restricted to the nanoscale (e.g. thin films, confined fluids) and the transfer of energy, electrons, protons, and matter across environmental interfaces.

== The atmosphere ==

As more dust enters the atmosphere due to the consequences of human activity (from direct effects, such as clearing of land and desertification, versus indirect effects, such as global warming), it becomes more important to understand the effects of mineral dust on the gaseous composition of the atmosphere, [[cloud formation]] conditions, and global-mean [[radiative forcing]] (i.e., heating or cooling effects).

== The ocean ==

Oceanographers generally study particles that measure 0.2 micrometres and larger, which means a lot of nanoscale particles are not examined, particularly with respect to formation mechanisms.

== The soils ==

*Water–rock–bacteria nanoscience

Although by no means developed, nearly all aspects (both geo- and bioprocesses) of [[weathering]], soil, and water–rock interaction science are inexorably linked to nanoscience. Within the Earth's near-surface, materials that are broken down, as well as materials that are produced, are often in the nanoscale regime. Further, as organic molecules, simple and complex, as well as bacteria and all flora and fauna in soils and rocks interact with the mineral components present, nanodimensions and nanoscale processes are the order of the day.

*Metal transport nanoscience

On land, researchers study how nanosized minerals capture toxins such as arsenic, copper, and lead from the soil. Facilitating this process, called [[soil remediation]], is a tricky business.

Nanogeoscience is in a relatively early stage of development. The future directions of nanoscience in the geosciences will include a determination of the identity, distribution, and unusual chemical properties of nanosized particles and/or films in the oceans, on the continents, and in the atmosphere, and how they drive Earth processes in unexpected ways. Further, nanotechnology will be the key to developing the next generation of Earth and environmental sensing systems.

== Size-dependent stability and reactivity of nanoparticles ==

Nanogeoscience deals with structures, properties and behaviors of nanoparticles in soils, aquatic systems and atmospheres. One of the key features of nanoparticles is the size-dependence of the nanoparticle stability and reactivity.&lt;ref&gt;Banfield, J. F.; Zhang, H. [http://www.minsocam.org/MSA/RIM/Rim44.html Nanoparticles in the environment].   Rev. Mineral. &amp; Geochem. 2001, 44, 1.&lt;/ref&gt; This arises from the large specific surface area and differences in surface atomic structure of nanoparticles at small particle sizes. In general, the [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] of nanoparticles is inversely proportional to their particle size. For materials that can adopt two or more structures, size-dependent free energy may result in phase stability crossover at certain sizes.&lt;ref&gt;Ranade, M. R.; Navrotsky, A.; Zhang, H.; Banfield, J. F.; Elder, S. H.; Zaban, A.; Borse, P. H.; Kulkarni, S. K.; Doran, G. S.; Whitfield, H. J. [http://www.pnas.org/content/99/suppl.2/6476.full Energetics of nanocrystalline TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;].    PNAS 2002,  99 (Suppl 2), 6476.&lt;/ref&gt; Free energy reduction drives crystal growth (atom-by-atom or by oriented attachment &lt;ref&gt;Penn, R. L.; Banfield, J. F. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.281.5379.969 Imperfect oriented attachment: dislocation generation in defect-free nanocrystals]. Science 1998, 281, 969.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Banfield, J. F.; Welch, S. A.; Zhang, H.; Ebert, T. T.; Penn, R. L. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.289.5480.751 Aggregation-based crystal growth and microstructure development in natural iron oxyhydroxide biomineralization products]. Science 2000, 289, 751.&lt;/ref&gt;), which may again drive the phase transformation due to the change of the relative phase stability at increasing sizes. These processes impact the surface reactivity and mobility of nanoparticles in natural systems.

Well-identified size-dependent phenomena of nanoparticles include

*Phase stability reversal of bulk (macroscopic) particles at small sizes. Usually, a less stable bulk-phase at low temperature (and/or low pressure) becomes more stable than the bulk-stable phase as the particle size decreases below a certain critical size. For instance, bulk [[anatase]] (TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is metastable with respect to bulk [[rutile]] (TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). However, in air, anatase becomes more stable than rutile at particle sizes below 14&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, H.; Banfield, J. F. [http://www.rsc.org/Publishing/Journals/JM/article.asp?doi=a802619j Thermodynamic analysis of phase stability of nanocrystalline titania]. J. Mater. Chem. 1998, 8, 2073.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, below 1293 K, [[wurtzite]] (ZnS) is less stable than [[sphalerite]] (ZnS). In vacuum, wurtzite becomes more stable than sphalerite when the particle size is less than 7&amp;nbsp;nm at 300 K.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, H.; Huang, F.; Gilbert, B.; Banfield, J. F. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp036108t Molecular dynamics simulations, thermodynamics analysis and experimental study of phase stability of zinc sulfide nanoparticles]. J. Phys. Chem. B 2003, 107, 13051.&lt;/ref&gt; At very small particle sizes, the addition of water to the surface of ZnS nanoparticles can induce a change in nanoparticle structure &lt;ref&gt;Zhang, H; Gilbert, B.; Huang, F.; Banfield, J. F. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature01845 Water-driven structure transformation in nanoparticles at room temperature]. Nature 2003, 424, 1025.&lt;/ref&gt; and surface-surface interactions can drive a reversible structural transformation upon aggregation/disaggregation.&lt;ref&gt;Huang, F.; Gilbert, B.; Zhang, H.; Banfield, J. F. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.92.155501 Reversible, surface-controlled structure transformation in nanoparticles induced by an aggregation state]. Phys. Rev. Lett. 2004, 92, 155501.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other examples of size-dependent phase stability include systems of Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;McHale, J. M.; Auroux, A.; Perrotta, A. J.; Navrotsky, A. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.277.5327.788  Surface energies and thermodynamic phase stability in nanocrystalline aluminas].

*Phase transformation kinetics is size-dependent and transformations usually occur at low temperatures (less than several hundred degrees). Under such conditions, rates of surface nucleation and bulk nucleation are low due to their high activation energies. Thus, phase transformation occurs predominantly via interface nucleation &lt;ref&gt;Zhang, H.; Banfield, J. F. [http://www.minsocam.org/MSA/AmMin/TOC/1999/Apr99.html New kinetic model for the nanocrystalline anatase-to-rutile transformation revealing rate dependence on number of particles]. Am. Mineral. 1999, 84, 528.&lt;/ref&gt; that depends on contact between nanoparticles. As a consequence, the transformation rate is particle number (size)-dependent and it proceeds faster in densely packed (or highly aggregated) than in loosely packed nanoparticles.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, H.; Banfield, J. F. [http://www.mrs.org/s_mrs/sec_subscribe.asp?CID=2282&amp;DID=80278&amp;action=detail Phase transformation of nanocrystalline anatase-to-rutile via combined interface and surface nucleation]. J. Mater. Res. 2000, 15, 437&lt;/ref&gt; Complex concurrent phase transformation and particle coarsening often occur in nanoparticles.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, H.; Banfield, J. F.

*Size-dependent adsorption on nanoparticles &lt;ref&gt;Zhang, H.; Penn, R. L.; Hamers, R. J.; Banfield, J. F. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp984574q Enhanced adsorption of molecules on surfaces of nanocrystalline particles]. J. Phys. Chem. B 1999, 103, 4656.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Madden, A. S.; Hochella, M. F.; Luxton, T. P. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2006.06.1366 Insights for size -dependent reactivity of hematite nanomineral surfaces through Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sorption]. Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 2006, 70, 4095.&lt;/ref&gt; and oxidation of nanominerals.&lt;ref&gt;Madden, A. S.; Hochella, M.

Acta 2005, 69, 389.&lt;/ref&gt;

These size-dependent properties highlight the importance of the particle size in nanoparticle stability and reactivity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1321">'''Nature Detectives''' is an online [[phenology]] research and education project for 4–18-year-olds in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. It is run by the [[Woodland Trust]], as part of the UK Phenology Network.

Participants record the dates they see seasonal events, such as leafing, flowering, bird migration, nesting or fruit ripening in their own recording form on the website. The data they collect is fed into the UKPN national database, which has over 11,000 contributors and now contains over one million records.

The project monitors the activity of birds, insects, amphibians, grasses, fungi, flowers and trees, all of which are being affected by [[climate change]]. There is also information on phenology, climate change and "doing your bit for the environment".

Schools, youth groups, families and individuals all take part, and it is proving a great way to involve children in the natural world and teach them about plants and wildlife and environmental issues.

In [[Germanic paganism]], '''Nerthus''' is a [[goddess]] associated with [[fertility goddess|fertility]]. Nerthus is attested by first century AD Roman historian [[Tacitus]] in his ethnographic work ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]''.

In ''Germania'', Tacitus records that the remote [[Suebi]] tribes were united by their veneration of the goddess at his time of writing and maintained a [[sacred grove]] on an (unspecified) island and that a holy cart rests there draped with cloth, which only a [[gothi|priest]] may touch. The priests feel her presence by the cart, and, with deep reverence, attend her cart, which is drawn by [[:wikt:heifer|heifer]]s. Everywhere the goddess then deigns to visit, she is met with celebration, hospitality, and peace. All iron objects are locked away, and no one will leave for war. When the goddess has had her fill she is returned to her temple by the priests. Tacitus adds that the goddess, the cart, and the cloth are then washed by slaves in a secluded lake. The slaves are then drowned.

The name ''Nerthus'' is generally held to be a [[Latinisation of names|Latinized]] form of [[Proto-Germanic]] '''*Nerþuz''', a direct precursor to the [[Old Norse]] deity name ''[[Njörðr]]''. While scholars have noted numerous parallels between the descriptions of the two figures, Njörðr is attested as a male deity. Various scholarly theories exist regarding the goddess and her potential later traces amongst the [[Germanic peoples]], including that the figure may be identical to the unnamed [[sister-wife of Njörðr]] mentioned in two Old Norse sources.

==Name==
Nerthus is often identified with the [[Vanir|van]] [[Njörðr]] who is attested in various 13th century [[Old Norse]] works and in numerous [[Scandinavia]]n [[toponymy|place names]]. The connection between the two is due to the linguistic relationship between ''Njörðr'' and the [[Linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] [[Proto-Germanic]] ''*Nerþuz'',&lt;ref name="SIMEK234"&gt;Simek (2007:234)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nerthus'' being the feminine, [[Latin]]ized form of what ''[[Njörðr]]'' would have looked like around the first century.&lt;ref name="LINDOW237—238"&gt;Lindow (2001:237—238)&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to theories about the relation of the two, including that Njörðr may have once been a hermaphroditic deity&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Nerthus|title=Nerthus {{!}} Germanic deity|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-08-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; or that the name may indicate the otherwise forgotten [[Sister-wife of Njörðr|sister-wife]] in a divine brother-sister pair like the Vanir deities [[Freyja]] and [[Freyr]].&lt;ref name="SIMEK234-W-NOTE"&gt;Simek (2007:234). Note that Simek supports the notion of an unattested divine brother and sister pair.&lt;/ref&gt;

While developments in [[historical linguistics]] ultimately allowed for the identification of ''Nerthus'' with ''Njörðr'',  various other readings of the name were in currency prior to the acceptance of this identification, most commonly the form ''Hertha''. This form was proposed as an attempt to mirror the Old Norse goddess name ''[[Jörð]]'' 'earth'.&lt;ref name="SIMEK-145"&gt;Simek (2007:145).&lt;/ref&gt;  Writing on this topic in 1912, [[Raymond Wilson Chambers]] says "strange has been the history of this goddess Nerthus in modern times. Sixteenth century scholars found irresistible the temptation to emend the name of 'Mother Earth' into ''Herthum'', which nineteenth century scholars further improved into ''Hertham'', ''Ertham''. For many years this false goddess drove out the rightful deity from the fortieth chapter of the ''Germania''".&lt;ref name="CHAMBERS-70"&gt;Chambers (2001 [1912]:70).&lt;/ref&gt;
Up until its superseding, the name ''Hertha'' had some influence. For example, ''Hertha'' and ''[[Herthasee (Rügen)|Herthasee]]'' (see "location" section below) play major roles in German novelist [[Theodor Fontane]]'s 1896 novel ''[[Effi Briest]]''.&lt;ref name="HARDY-125"&gt;Hardy (2001:125).&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Germania''==
In chapter 40 of his ''Germania'', Roman historian Tacitus, discussing the Suebian tribes of Germania, writes that beside the populous [[Semnones]] and warlike [[Langobardi]] there are seven remoter Suebian tribes; the [[Reudigni]], [[Aviones]], [[Anglii]], [[Varini]], [[Eudoses]], [[Suarines]], and [[Nuitones]]. The seven tribes are surrounded by rivers and forests and, according to Tacitus, there is nothing particularly worthy of comment about them as individuals, yet they are particularly distinguished in that they all worship the goddess Nerthus, and provides an account of veneration of the goddess among the groups. The chapter reads as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
{|
|
&lt;small&gt;Latin:&lt;/small&gt;
:''Contra Langobardos paucitas nobilitat: plurimis ac valentissimis nationibus cincti non per obsequium, sed proeliis ac periclitando tuti sunt. Reudigni deinde et Aviones et Anglii et Varini et Eudoses et Suardones et Nuithones fluminibus aut silvis muniuntur. Nec quicquam notabile in singulis, nisi quod in commune Nerthum, id est Terram matrem, colunt eamque intervenire rebus hominum, invehi populis arbitrantur. Est in insula Oceani castum nemus, dicatumque in eo vehiculum, veste contectum; attingere uni sacerdoti concessum. Is adesse penetrali deam intellegit vectamque bubus feminis multa cum veneratione prosequitur. Laeti tunc dies, festa loca, quaecumque adventu hospitioque dignatur. Non bella ineunt, non arma sumunt; clausum omne ferrum; pax et quies tunc tantum nota, tunc tantum amata, donec idem sacerdos satiatam conversatione mortalium deam templo reddat. Mox vehiculum et vestes et, si credere velis, numen ipsum secreto lacu abluitur. Servi ministrant, quos statim idem lacus haurit. Arcanus hinc terror sanctaque ignorantia, quid sit illud, quod tantum perituri vident.''&lt;ref name="STUART20"&gt;Stuart (1916:20).&lt;/ref&gt;
|
&lt;small&gt;A. R. Birley translation:&lt;/small&gt;
:By contrast, the Langobardi are distinguished by being few in number. Surrounded by many mighty peoples they have protected themselves not by submissiveness but by battle and boldness. Next to them come the Ruedigni, Aviones, Anglii, Varini, Eudoses, Suarines, and Huitones, protected by river and forests. There is nothing especially noteworthy about these states individually, but they are distinguished by a common worship of Nerthus, that is, Mother Earth, and believes that she intervenes in human affairs and rides through their peoples. There is a [[sacred grove]] on an island in the Ocean, in which there is a consecrated chariot, draped with cloth, where the priest alone may touch. He perceives the presence of the goddess in the innermost shrine and with great reverence escorts her in her chariot, which is drawn by female cattle. There are days of rejoicing then and the countryside celebrates the festival, wherever she designs to visit and to accept hospitality. No one goes to war, no one takes up arms, all objects of iron are locked away, then and only then do they experience peace and quiet, only then do they prize them, until the goddess has had her fill of human society and the priest brings her back to her temple. Afterwards the chariot, the cloth, and, if one may believe it, the deity herself are washed in a hidden lake. The slaves who perform this office are immediately swallowed up in the same lake. Hence arises dread of the mysterious, and piety, which keeps them ignorant of what only those about to perish may see.&lt;ref name="BIRLEY58"&gt;Birley (1999:58).&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;small&gt;J. B. Rives translation:&lt;/small&gt;
:The Langobardi, by contrast, are distinguished by the fewness of their numbers. Ringed round as they are by many mighty peoples, they find safety not in obsequiousness but in battle and its perils. After them come the Reudingi, Aviones, Anglii, Varini, Eudoses, Suarini and Nuitones, behind their ramparts of rivers and woods. There is nothing noteworthy about these peoples individually, but they are distinguished by a common worship of Nerthus, or Mother Earth. They believe that she interests herself in human affairs and rides among their peoples. In an island of the Ocean stands a sacred grove, and in the grove a consecrated cart, draped with cloth, which none but the priest may touch. The priest perceives the presence of the goddess in this holy of holies and attends her, in deepest reverence, as her cart is drawn by heifers. Then follow days of rejoicing and merry-making in every place that she designs to visit and be entertained. No one goes to war, no one takes up arms; every object of iron is locked away; then, and only then, are peace and quiet known and loved, until the priest again restores the goddess to her temple, when she has had her fill of human company. After that the cart, the cloth and, if you care to believe it, the goddess herself are washed in clean in a secluded lake. This service is performed by slaves who are immediately afterwards drowned in the lake. Thus mystery begets terror and pious reluctance to ask what the sight can be that only those doomed to die may see.&lt;ref name="RIVES"&gt;Rives (2010). Pages unnumbered; chapter 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories and interpretations==
A number of theories have been proposed regarding the figure of Nerthus, including the location of the events described, relations to other known deities and her role amongst the Germanic tribes.

===Location===
A number of scholars have proposed a potential location of Tacitus's account of Nerthus as on the island of [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]] in [[Denmark]]. The reasoning behind this notion is the linking of the name Nerthus with the medieval place name ''Niartharum'' (modern [[Nærum]]) located on Zealand. Further justification is given in that [[Lejre]], the seat of the ancient kings of Denmark, is also located on Zealand. Nerthus is then commonly compared to the goddess [[Gefjon]], who is said to have plowed the island of Zealand from Sweden in the ''[[Prose Edda]]'' book ''[[Gylfaginning]]'' and in Lejre wed the legendary Danish king [[Skjöldr]].&lt;ref name="GEFJON-PLOWS"&gt;Chadwick (1907:267—268, 289) and Davidson (1964:113).&lt;/ref&gt;

Chambers notes that the mistaken name ''Hertha'' (see ''Interpretations of name'' above) led to the [[hydronym]] ''[[Herthasee (Rügen)|Herthasee]]'', a lake on the German island of [[Rügen]], which antiquarians proposed as a potential location of the Nerthus site described in Tacitus. However, along with the rejection of the reading ''Hertha'', the location is now no longer considered as a potential site.&lt;ref name="CHAMBERS-69-71"&gt;Chambers (2001: 69-71).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Similar customs among the Vanir===
Nerthus typically is identified as a Vanir goddess. Her wagon tour has been likened to several archeological wagon finds and legends of deities parading in wagons. Terry Gunnell and many others have noted various archaeological finds of ritual wagons in Denmark dating from 200 AD and the [[Bronze Age]]. Such a ceremonial wagon, incapable of making turns, was discovered in the [[Oseberg ship]] find. Two of the most famous literary examples occur in the Icelandic [[family saga]]s. The [[Vanir]] god [[Freyr]] is said to ride in a wagon annually through the country accompanied by a priestess to bless the fields, according to a late story titled ''[[Hauks þáttr hábrókar]]'' in the 14th century ''[[Flateyjarbók]]'' manuscript. In the same source, King Eric of Sweden is said to consult a god named [[Lýtir]], whose wagon was brought to his hall in order to perform a divination ceremony.&lt;ref name="DAVIDSON94-95"&gt;Davidson (1964:92—95).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hilda Ellis Davidson|Hilda Davidson]] draws a parallel between these incidents and Tacitus's account of Nerthus, suggesting that in addition a neck-ring-wearing female figure "kneeling as if to drive a chariot" also dates from the Bronze Age. Davidson says that the evidence suggests that similar customs as detailed in Tacitus's account continued to exist during the close of the pagan period through worship of the Vanir.&lt;ref name="DAVIDSON96"&gt;Davidson (1964:96).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern influence==
The [[minor planet]] [[601 Nerthus]] is named after Nerthus.

'''Oil discharge monitoring equipment''' (ODME) is based on a measurement of oil content in the ballast and slop water, to measure conformance with regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = VAFInstruments {{!}} Home of VAF Instruments {{!}} Products {{!}} Oil Discharge Monitoring  Equipment|url = https://www.vaf.nl/products/overview/oil-discharge-monitoring-equipment/|website = www.vaf.nl|accessdate = 2015-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The apparatus is equipped with a GPS, data recording functionality, an [[oil content meter]] and a flow meter.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = ODME Oil Discharge Monitoring Systems and Equipment|url = http://www.insatechmarine.com/solutions/emissions/odme|website = www.insatechmarine.com|accessdate = 2015-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By use of data interpretation, a computing unit will be able to allow the discharge to continue or it will stop it using a valve outside the deck.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Operating principle==

A sample point on the discharge line allows for the analyzer to determine the oil content of the ballast now and slop water in PPM.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The analyzer is self-maintaining by periodical cleansings with [[fresh water]], and therefore requires a minimum of active maintenance from the crew.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The results of the analyzer are sent to a computer, which determines whether the oil content values are to result in overboard discharge or not.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The valves that direct the ballast water either over board or to slop tank are controlled by the integrated computer, and a GPS signal further automates the process by including special areas and completes the required input for the [[Oil record book|Oil Record Book]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

All oil tankers with a gross tonnage of larger than 150 must have efficient Oil Discharge Monitoring Equipment on board.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is Oil Discharge Monitoring and Control System (ODMCS) on Ship?|url = http://www.marineinsight.com/misc/maritime-law/what-is-oil-discharge-monitoring-and-control-system-odmcs-on-ship/|accessdate = 2015-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Regulation 31 - Oil discharge monitoring and control system|url = http://www.marpoltraining.com/MMSKOREAN/MARPOL/Annex_I/r31.htm|website = www.marpoltraining.com|accessdate = 2015-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oily discharge is sent out to sea through a pump.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Oil in water, oil water analyzer, oil/water monitors by Arjay Engineering|url = http://www.arjayeng.com/arjayeng_oil_and_water.htm|website = www.arjayeng.com|accessdate = 2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The oily mixture has to pass through a series of sensors to determine whether it is acceptable to be sent to the discharge pipe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ODME S-3000|url = http://www.ksb.com/ksb-kr-en/Products_and_Services/Marine/Marine_System_ch/Oil_Discharge_Monitoring_Equipment/1042132/ODME_art.html|accessdate = 2015-07-23|first = KSB AG, Frankenthal|last = Germany}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on regulations, the following values must be recorded by the system:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* Date and time of the discharge
* Location of the ship
* Oil content of the discharge in ppm
* Total quantity discharged
* Discharge rate
All records of Oil Detection Monitoring Equipment  must be stored on board ships for no less than 3 years.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Oil Discharge Monitoring systems today consist of a computing unit that is installed in the cargo control room.  The computer unit control and receives data from other ODME components.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = ODME 2005 - Oil Discharge Monitor {{!}} Monitoring and control systems {{!}} Products {{!}} JOWA AB|url = http://www.jowa.se/page/products/monitoring-and-control-systems/odme-2005---oil-discharge-monitor|website = www.jowa.se|accessdate = 2015-07-23|first = Merreklam,|last = www.merreklam.se}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ODME systems also have an analyzing unit that contains the [[Oil content meter]], a fresh water valve for cleaning purposes, and a pressure transmitter that monitors the sample flow through the measuring cell.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A '''paddy field''' is a flooded parcel of [[arable land]] used for growing [[Aquatic plant|semiaquatic]] [[rice]]. Paddy cultivation should not be confused with cultivation of [[deepwater rice]], which is grown in flooded conditions with water more than 50&amp;nbsp;cm (20&amp;nbsp;in) deep for at least a month. Genetic evidence shows that all forms of paddy rice, both ''indica'' and ''japonica'', spring from a domestication of the wild rice ''[[Oryza rufipogon]]'' that first occurred 8,200–13,500 years ago South of the Yangtze River in present-day China.&lt;ref name="pnas1"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Molina | first1 = J. | last2 = Sikora | first2 = M. | last3 = Garud | first3 = N. | last4 = Flowers | first4 = J.

Fields can be built into steep hillsides as [[Terrace (agriculture)|terraces]] and adjacent to depressed or steeply sloped features such as rivers or [[marsh]]es. They can require a great deal of labor and materials to create, and need large quantities of water for irrigation. [[Ox]]en and [[water buffalo]], adapted for life in [[wetland]]s, are important working animals used extensively in paddy field farming.

=== Korea ===
[[File:North Korean POWs marching across rice paddy HD-SN-99-03148.JPEG|thumb|right|North Korean prisoners march single file across a rice paddy in Korea, 1950]]
There are ten archaeologically excavated rice paddy fields in Korea. The two oldest are the Okhyun and Yaumdong sites, found in [[Ulsan]], dating to the early [[Mumun pottery period]].&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, Gary W. and Gyoung-Ah Lee. Agricultural Origins in the Korean Peninsula. ''Antiquity'' 77(295):87–95, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paddy field farming goes back thousands of years in Korea. A pit-house at the Daecheon-ni site yielded carbonized rice grains and radiocarbon dates, indicating that rice cultivation in dry-fields may have begun as early as the Middle [[Jeulmun pottery period]] (c. 3500–2000 BC) in the [[Korean Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;Crawford and Lee 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient paddy fields have been carefully unearthed in Korea by institutes such as [[Kyungnam University]] Museum (KUM) of [[Masan]]. They excavated paddy field features at the Geumcheon-ni Site near [[Miryang]], [[South Gyeongsang Province]]. The paddy field feature was found next to a [[pit-house]] that is dated to the latter part of the Early Mumun pottery period (c. 1100–850 BC). KUM has conducted excavations, that have revealed similarly dated paddy field features, at Yaeum-dong and Okhyeon, in modern-day [[Ulsan]].&lt;ref&gt;Bale, Martin T. Archaeology of Early Agriculture in Korea: An Update on Recent Developments. ''Bulletin of the Indo-Pacific Prehistory Association'' 21(5):77–84, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest Mumun features were usually located in low-lying narrow gullies, that were naturally swampy and fed by the local stream system. Some Mumun paddy fields in flat areas were made of a series of squares and rectangles, separated by bunds approximately 10&amp;nbsp;cm in height, while terraced paddy fields consisted of long irregular shapes that followed natural contours of the land at various levels.&lt;ref&gt;Bale 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kwak, Jong-chul. Urinara-eui Seonsa – Godae Non Bat Yugu [Dry- and Wet-field Agricultural Features of the Korean Prehistoric].In ''Hanguk Nonggyeong Munhwa-eui Hyeongseong'' [The Formation of Agrarian Societies in Korea]: 21–73. Papers of the 25th National Meetings of the [[Korean Archaeological Society]], Busan, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Mumun Period rice farmers used all of the elements that are present in today's paddy fields, such as terracing, bunds, canals, and small reservoirs. We can grasp some paddy-field farming techniques of the Middle Mumun (c. 850–550 BC), from the well-preserved wooden tools excavated from archaeological rice fields at the Majeon-ni Site. However, iron tools for paddy-field farming were not introduced until sometime after 200 BC. The spatial scale of paddy-fields increased, with the regular use of iron tools, in the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] Period (c. AD 300/400-668).

=== Japan ===
The first paddy fields in Japan date to the Early [[Yayoi period]] (300 BC – 250 AD).&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Gina L. Paddy Soils Now and Then. ''World Archaeology'' 22(1):1–17, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; The Early Yayoi has been re-dated, and it appears that wet-field agriculture developed at about the same time as in the Korean peninsula.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Evidence of wild rice on the island of [[Sulawesi]] dates from 3000 BCE. Historic evidence for the earliest cultivation, however, comes from eighth century stone inscriptions from the central island of [[Java]], which show kings levied taxes in rice. In ancient Java, during the [[Medang Kingdom|Medang Mataram]] period, many inscriptions are related to the establishment of the ''sima'' lands. This signify the formation and expansion of Javanese agricultural villages in the region during this period. Either by opening a forest or converting a ''ladang'' (dry rice cultivation) to ''sawah'' (wet rice cultivation). A ''sima'' is an arable [[wet rice]] agricultural land with rice surpluses available for taxation, and officially recognised through royal edict. Most of these ''sima'' lands are ruled by regional ''rakai'' or ''samget'' (landed gentry) in their realm. The Rakais that rule the land are granted a royal permission to collect tax, yet some parts of these tax should be regularly paid to the king's court. In some instance, some of these ''sima'' inscription stated that this ''sima'' land has become a tax-free land, in exchange that the rice harvest surpluses collected from this land are used to construct or maintain a [[Candi of Indonesia|religious building]].

The images of rice cultivation, rice barn, and mouse pest investing a rice field is evident in Karmawibhangga bas-reliefs of [[Borobudur]]. Divisions of labour between men, women, and animals that are still in place in Indonesian rice cultivation, were carved into relief friezes on the ninth century [[Prambanan|Prambanan temples]] in [[Central Java]]: a [[Domestic Asian Water buffalo|water buffalo]] attached to a plough; women planting seedlings and pounding grain; and a man carrying sheaves of rice on each end of a pole across his shoulders (''pikulan''). In the sixteenth century, Europeans visiting the Indonesian islands saw rice as a new prestige food served to the aristocracy during ceremonies and feasts.&lt;ref name="TAYLOR_8"&gt;{{cite book |last=Taylor|first=Jean Gelman|title=Indonesia: Peoples and Histories|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2003 |location= New Haven and London|url= |doi= |pages=8–9|isbn= 0-300-10518-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rice production in Indonesian history is linked to the development of iron tools and the domestication of [[Wild Asian Water Buffalo]] as [[Domestic buffalo|water buffalo]] for cultivation of fields and [[manure]] for fertiliser. Rice production requires exposure to the sun. Once covered in dense forest, much of the Indonesian landscape has been gradually cleared for permanent fields and settlements as rice cultivation developed over the last fifteen hundred years.&lt;ref name="TAYLOR_8"/&gt;

=== Philippines ===
In the Philippines, the use of rice paddies can be traced to prehistoric times, as evidenced in the names of towns such as [[Pila, Laguna]], whose name can be traced to the straight mounds of dirt that form the boundaries of the rice paddy, or "Pilapil."&lt;ref name=Valdes&gt;Ongpin Valdes, Cynthia, "Pila in Ancient Times", Treasures of Pila, Pila Historical Society Foundation Inc..&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vietnam ===
Wet rice cultivation in Vietnam dates back to the [[Neolithic]] Hoa Binh culture and Bac Son culture.&lt;ref&gt;Vietnam Embassy in USA information page [http://www.vietnamembassy-usa.org/learn_about_vietnam/history/ vietnamembassy-usa.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070806131604/http://www.vietnamembassy-usa.org/learn_about_vietnam/history/ |date=6 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Terrace field yunnan china edit.jpg|thumb|left|Rice terraces in [[Yuanyang County, Yunnan]], China]]
Although China's agricultural output is the largest in the world, only about 15% of its total land area can be cultivated. About 75% of the cultivated area is used for food crops. Rice is China's most important crop, raised on about 25% of the cultivated area. Most rice is grown south of the [[Huai River]], in the [[Yangtze River|Yangtze valley]], the [[Zhu Jiang]] delta, and in [[Yunnan]], [[Guizhou]], and [[Sichuan]] provinces.

Rice appears to have been used by the Early [[Neolithic]] populations of Lijiacun and Yunchanyan in China.&lt;ref name="Crawford and Shen 1998"&gt;Crawford and Shen 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of possible rice cultivation from ca. 11,500 BP has been found, however it is still questioned whether the rice was indeed being cultivated, or instead being [[Hunter-gatherer|gathered]] as wild rice.&lt;ref name="Harrington"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harrington |first=Spencer P.M. |date=11 June 1997 |title=Earliest Rice |journal=Archaeology |publisher=Archaeological Institute of America | url =http://www.archaeology.org/online/news/rice.html |quote=Rice cultivation began in China ca. 11,500 years ago, some 3,500 years earlier than previously believed}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce Smith, an archaeologist at the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in Washington, D.C., who has written on the origins of agriculture, says that evidence has been mounting that the Yangtze was probably the site of the earliest rice cultivation.&lt;ref name="Normile"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.275.5298.309|last=Normile|first=Dennis|year=1997|title=Yangtze seen as earliest rice site|journal=Science|volume=275|pages=309–310|issue=5298}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, Crawford &amp; Shen reported that the earliest of 14 AMS or radiocarbon dates on rice from at least nine Early to Middle Neolithic sites is no older than 7000 BC, that rice from the [[Hemudu]] and Luojiajiao sites indicates that rice domestication likely began before 5000 BC, but that most sites in China from which rice remains have been recovered are younger than 5000 BC.&lt;ref name="Crawford and Shen 1998" /&gt;

During the [[Spring and Autumn period]] (722–481 BC), two revolutionary improvements in [[Agricultural science|farming technology]] took place. One was the use of [[History of ferrous metallurgy#Cast iron in China|cast iron tools]] and [[Working animal|beasts of burden]] to pull plows, and the other was the large-scale harnessing of rivers and development of [[water conservation]] projects. [[Sunshu Ao]] of the 6th century BC and [[Ximen Bao]] of the 5th century BC are two of the earliest hydraulic engineers from China, and their works were focused upon improving [[irrigation]] systems.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 271"&gt;[[Joseph Needham|Needham, Joseph]] (1986). ''Science and Civilization in China: Volume 4, Physics and Physical Technology, Part 3, Civil Engineering and Nautics''. Taipei: Caves Books Ltd. Page 271.&lt;/ref&gt; These developments were widely spread during the ensuing [[Warring States period]] (403–221 BC), culminating in the enormous [[Du Jiang Yan Irrigation System]] engineered by [[Li Bing (administrator)|Li Bing]] by 256 BC for the [[Qin (state)|State of Qin]] in ancient [[Sichuan]]. During the [[Eastern Jin]] (317–420) and the [[Northern and Southern Dynasties]] (420–589), land-use became more intensive and efficient, rice was grown twice a year and cattle began to be used for [[plowing]] and [[Fertilizer|fertilization]].

In circa 750, 75% of China's population lived north of the river [[Yangtze]], but by 1250, 75% of China's population lived south of the river Yangtze. Such large-scale internal migration was possible due to introduction of quick-ripening strains of rice from Vietnam suitable for multi-cropping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=DF-N_lXjlL8C&amp;pg=PA20&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=saudi+arabia+economy |title=The World Economy, Angus Maddison, p.20, ISBN 92-64-02261-9 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= 21 September 2006|accessdate=25 April 2013|isbn=9789264022614 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paddy is cultivated at least twice a year in most parts of India, the two seasons being known as [[Rabi crop|Rabi]] and [[Kharif crop|Kharif]] respectively. The former cultivation is dependent on irrigation, while the latter depends on Monsoon. The paddy cultivation plays a major role in socio-cultural life of rural India. Many festivals such as Onam in [[Kerala]], Bihu in [[Assam]], Makara Sankranthi in [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Telangana]], [[Thai Pongal]] In [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Makar Sankranti]] in [[Karnataka]], Nabanna in [[West Bengal]] celebrates harvest of Paddy.

[[File:KerbauJawa.jpg|thumb|[[domestic buffalo|Water buffalos]] were formerly used to plough muddy paddy fields in Indonesia although the use of mechanised methods, such as small powered ploughs, has become much more common in recent years.]]
{{main|Rice production in Indonesia}}
Prime [[Java]]nese paddy yields roughly 6 metric tons of unmilled rice (2.5 metric tons of milled rice) per [[hectare]].  When irrigation is available, rice farmers typically plant [[Green Revolution]] rice varieties allowing three growing seasons per year.  Since fertilizer and pesticide are relatively expensive inputs, farmers typically plant seeds in a very small plot.  Three weeks following germination, the 15-20 centimetre (6–8&amp;nbsp;in) stalks are picked and replanted at greater separation, in a backbreaking manual procedure.

Rice harvesting in [[Central Java]] is often performed not by owners or [[sharecropper]]s of paddy, but rather by itinerant middlemen, whose small firms specialize in harvesting, transport, milling, and distribution to markets.

The fertile volcanic soil of much of the Indonesian [[archipelago]]—and particularly the islands of Java and [[Bali]]—has made rice a central dietary staple.  Steep terrain on Bali resulted in an intricate cooperation systems, locally called ''[[Subak (irrigation)|subak]]'', to manage water storage and drainage for rice terraces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.santafe.edu/research/publications/workingpapers/03-05-030.pdf |title=Lansing and Miller |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=25 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327005944/http://www.santafe.edu/research/publications/workingpapers/03-05-030.pdf |archivedate=27 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The acidic soil conditions common in Japan due to volcanic eruptions have made the paddy field the most productive farming method. Paddy fields are represented by the [[kanji]] {{lang|ja|田}} (commonly read as ''ta'') that has had a strong influence on Japanese culture.  In fact, the character {{lang|ja|田}}, which originally meant 'field' in general, is used in Japan exclusively to convey the meaning 'rice paddy field'. One of the oldest samples of writing in Japan is widely credited to the kanji {{lang|ja|田}} found on pottery at the archaeological site of [[Matsusaka, Mie|Matsutaka]] in [[Mie Prefecture]] that dates to the late 2nd century.

''Ta'' ({{lang|ja|田}}) is used as a part of many [[Japanese place names|place names]] as well as in many family names. Most of these places are somehow related to the paddy field and, in many cases, are based on the history of a particular location. For example, where a river runs through a village, the place east of river may be called ''Higashida'' ({{lang|ja|東田}}), literally "east paddy field." A place with a newly irrigated paddy field, especially those during or later than [[Edo period]], may be called ''Nitta'' or ''Shinden'' (both {{lang|ja|新田}}), "new paddy field." In some places, lakes and marshes were likened to a paddy field and were named with ''ta'', like ''Hakkōda'' ({{lang|ja|八甲田}}).

Today, many family names have ''ta'' as a component, a practice which can be largely attributed to a government edict in the early [[Meiji Period]] which required all citizens to have a family name. Many chose a name based on some geographical feature associated with their residence or occupation, and as nearly three fourths of the population were farmers, many made family names using ''ta''. Some common examples are ''[[Tanaka (disambiguation)|Tanaka]]'' ({{lang|ja|田中}}), literally meaning "in the paddy field;" ''[[Nakata (disambiguation)|Nakata]]'' ({{lang|ja|中田}}), "middle paddy field;" ''[[Kawada (disambiguation)|Kawada]]'' (川田), "river paddy field;" and ''Furuta'' ({{lang|ja|古田}}), "old paddy field."

In recent years, rice consumption in Japan has fallen and many rice farmers are increasingly elderly. The government has subsidized rice production since the 1970s, and favors [[protectionist]] policies regarding cheaper imported rice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/research/articlesBySubject/displaystory.cfm?subjectid=348969&amp;story_id=15108648 |title=Economist.com |publisher=Economist.com |date=17 December 2009 |accessdate=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Korea ===
[[File:Rice fields in Namwon.jpg|thumb|Paddy field near [[Namwon]], South Korea, early June]]
Arable land in small alluvial flats of most rural river valleys in South Korea are dedicated to paddy-field farming. Farmers assess paddy fields for any necessary repairs in February. Fields may be rebuilt, and [[bunding|bund]] breaches are repaired. This work is carried out until mid-March, when warmer spring weather allows the farmer to buy or grow rice seedlings. They are transplanted (usually by [[rice transplanter]]) from the indoors into freshly flooded paddy fields in May. Farmers tend and weed their paddy fields through the summer until around the time of [[Chuseok]], a traditional holiday held on 15 August of the [[Lunar Calendar]] (circa mid-September by Solar Calendar). The harvest begins in October. Coordinating the harvest can be challenging because many Korean farmers have small paddy fields in a number of locations around their villages, and modern harvesting machines are sometimes shared between extended family members. Farmers usually dry the harvested grains in the sun before bringing them to market.

The Chinese (or [[Sino-Korean vocabulary|Sino-Korean]]) character for 'field', ''jeon'' ({{korean|hangul=전|hanja=田}}), is found in some place names, especially small farming townships and villages. However, the specific Korean term for 'paddy' is a purely Korean word, "non" ({{korean|hangul=논}}).

=== Madagascar ===
[[File:Baobab and rice field.jpg|thumb|[[Adansonia|Baobab]] and rice field near [[Morondava]], Madagascar]]
In [[Madagascar]], the average annual consumption of rice is 130&amp;nbsp;kg per person, one of the largest in the world.

According to a 1999 study of UPDRS / FAO:

The majority of rice is related to irrigation (1,054,381 ha). The choice of methods conditioning performance is determined by the variety and quality control of water ..

The "[[Slash and burn|Tavy]]", is traditionally the culture of flooded upland rice on burning of cleared natural rain forest (135,966&amp;nbsp;ha). Criticized as being the cause of deforestation, "Tavy" is still widely practiced by farmers in Madagascar, who find a good compromise between climate risks, availability of labour and food security.

"Tanety" means hill. By extension, the "tanety" is also growing upland rice, carried out on the grassy slopes have been deforested for the operation of charcoal. (139,337&amp;nbsp;ha)

Among the many varieties, rice of Madagascar include:
"Vary lava" is a translucent long and large grain rice. It is a luxury ricer.
"Vary Makalioka, is translucent long and thin grain rice.
"Vary Rojofotsy" is a -half long.grain rice
"Vary mena" or red rice, is exclusive to Madagascar.

=== Malaysia ===
[[File:YosriSawahPadi1.jpg|thumb|Paddy field in the state of [[Terengganu]], Malaysia]]
Paddy field are typically found on [[Peninsular Malaysia]], in most of its regions. The most scenic paddy fields are located in northern Malaysia, in [[Kedah]], [[Perlis]] and [[Penang]]; almost covering these states. Paddy fields also can be found on Malaysia's eastern coast region, mainly in [[Kelantan]] and [[Terengganu]], and also in [[Selangor]], especially in the districts of Kuala Selangor and Sabak Bernam.

Before Malaysia became heavily reliant on its industrial output, people were mainly involved in agriculture, especially in the production of rice. It was for that reason, that people usually built their houses next to paddy fields. The very spicy [[chili pepper]] that is often eaten in Malaysia, the [[bird's eye chili]], is locally called ''cili padi'', literally "paddy chili".

=== Myanmar ===
[[File:Burmarice.JPG|thumb|Paddy fields in Myanmar]]
Rice is grown primarily in three areas – the [[Irrawaddy Delta]], the area along and the delta of the [[Kaladan River]], and the Central plains around [[Mandalay]], though there has been an increase in rice farming in Shan State and Kachin State in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Increasing rice production in Myanmar|url=https://www.unops.org/english/News/UNOPS-in-action/Pages/Increasing-rice-production-in-Myanmar.aspx|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up until the later 1960s, Myanmar was the main exporter of rice. Termed the rice basket of South East Asia, much of the rice grown in Myanmar does not rely on fertilizers and pesticides, thus, although "organic" in a sense, it has been unable to cope with population growth and other rice economies which utilized fertilizers.

Rice is now grown in all the three seasons of Myanmar, though primarily in the [[Monsoon]] season – from June to October. Rice grown in the delta areas rely heavily on the river water and sedimented minerals from the northern mountains, whilst the rice grown in the central regions require irrigation from the [[Irrawaddy River]].

The fields are tilled when the first rains arrive – traditionally measured at 40 days after [[Thingyan]], the [[Burmese New Year]] – around the beginning of June. In modern times, tractors are used, but traditionally, buffalos were employed. The rice plants are planted in nurseries and then transplanted by hand into the prepared fields. The rice is then harvested in late November – "when the rice bends with age". Most of the rice planting and harvesting are done by hand. The rice is then threshed and stored, ready for the mills.

=== Nepal ===
[[File:Paddy Planting.JPG|thumb|Women planting rice in Nepal]]
In Nepal, rice (Nepali: धान, Dhaan) is grown in the [[Terai#Terai in Nepal|Terai]] and hilly regions. It is mainly grown during the [[Geography of Nepal#Climate|summer monsoon in Nepal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.new-ag.info/en/country/profile.php?a=935|title=New Agriculturist: Country profile - Nepal|website=www.new-ag.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Philippines ===
[[File:Pana Banaue Rice Terraces.jpg|thumb|right|[[Banaue Rice Terraces]] in [[Ifugao]], Philippines]]
Paddy fields are a common sight in the Philippines. Several vast paddy fields exist in the [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]] of [[Ifugao]], [[Nueva Ecija]], [[Isabela (province)|Isabela]], [[Cagayan]], [[Bulacan]], [[Quezon]], and other provinces. [[Nueva Ecija]] is considered the main rice growing province of the [[Philippines]] and the leading producer of onions in the Municipality of Bongabon in [[Southeast Asia]]. It is currently the 9th richest [[Provinces of the Philippines|province]] in the country.

The [[Banaue Rice Terraces]] is an example of paddy fields in the country, it is located in Northern [[Luzon]], Philippines and were built by the [[Ifugao]]s 2,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/722 |title=Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras – UNESCO World Heritage Centre |publisher=Whc.unesco.org |date= |accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Streams and springs found in the mountains were tapped and channeled into [[Irrigation]] canals that run downhill through the rice terraces.  Other notable [[Philippine]] paddy fields are the Batad Rice Terraces, the Bangaan Rice Terraces, the [[Mayoyao]] Rice Terraces and the Hapao Rice Terraces.&lt;ref name="Wow"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tourism.gov.ph/explore_phil/place_details.asp?content=famousefor&amp;province=74 |title=Error |accessdate=1 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Located at Barangay Batad in Banaue, the Batad Rice Terraces are shaped like an [[amphitheatre]], and can be reached by a 12-kilometer ride from Banaue Hotel and a 2-hour hike uphill through mountain trails. The Bangaan Rice Terraces portray the typical Ifugao community, where the livelihood activities are within the village and its surroundings. The Bangaan Rice Terraces is accessible in a one-hour ride from Poblacion, Banaue, then a 20-minute trek down to the village. It can be viewed best from the road to Mayoyao.  The Mayoyao Rice Terraces is located at Mayoyao, 44 kilometers away from Poblacion, Banaue. The town of Mayoyao lies in the midst of these rice terraces.  All dikes are tiered with flat stones.  The Hapao Rice Terraces can be reached within 55 kilometers from the capital town of Lagawe. Other [[Ifugao]] stone-walled rice terraces are located in the municipality of Hungduan.&lt;ref name=Wow /&gt;

=== Sri Lanka ===
[[Agriculture in Sri Lanka]] mainly depends on rice production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knowledgebank.irri.org/country-specific/asia/rice-knowledge-for-sri-lanka|title=Rice Knowledge for Sri Lanka - IRRI Rice Knowledge Bank|website=www.knowledgebank.irri.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sri Lanka sometimes exports rice to its neighboring countries. Around 1.5 million hectares of land is cultivated in Sri Lanka for paddy in 2008/2009 maha: 64% of which is cultivated during the dry season and 35% cultivated during the wet season. Around 879,000 farmer families are engaged in paddy cultivation in Sri Lanka. They make up 20% of the country's population and 32% of the employment.

=== Vietnam ===
[[File:Canh-dong-Viet.JPG|thumb|A rice field in Vietnam]]

Rice fields in Vietnam (''ruộng'' or ''cánh đồng'' in Vietnamese) are the predominant land use in the valley of the [[Red River (Vietnam)|Red River]] and the [[Mekong Delta]]. In the [[Red River Delta]] of northern Vietnam, control of seasonal riverine floodings is achieved by an extensive network of [[Levee|dykes]] which over the centuries total some 3000&amp;nbsp;km. In the [[Mekong Delta]] of southern Vietnam, there is an interlacing drainage and irrigation canal system that has become the symbol of this area. It jointly serves as transportation routes, allowing farmers to bring their produce to market. In Northwestern Vietnam, [[Thai people]] built their ''"[[valley culture]]"'' based on the cultivation of [[glutinous rice]] planted in upland fields, requiring terracing of the slopes.

The primary festival related to the agrarian cycle is ''"lễ hạ điền"'' (literally "descent into the fields") held as the start of the planting season in hope of a bountiful harvest. Traditionally, the event was officiated with much pomp. The monarch carried out the ritual plowing the first furrow while local dignitaries and farmers followed suit. ''Thổ địa'' (deities of the earth), ''thành hoàng làng'' (the village patron spirit), [[Than Nong|Thần Nông]] (god of agriculture), and ''thần lúa'' (god of rice plants) were all venerated with prayers and offerings.

In colloquial Vietnamese, wealth is frequently associated with the vastness of the individual's land holdings. Paddy fields so large as for "storks to fly with their wings out-stretched" ("''đồng lúa thẳng cánh cò bay''") can be heard as a common metaphor. Wind-blown undulating rice plants across a paddy field in literary Vietnamese is termed figuratively "waves of rice plants" ("''sóng lúa''").{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

[[File:Surface analysis.gif|thumb|Map of pressure systems across North America]] A '''pressure system''' is a relative peak or lull in the [[Atmospheric pressure#Mean sea level pressure|sea level pressure]] distribution.  The surface pressure at sea level varies minimally, with the lowest value measured {{convert|87|kPa|inHg}} and the highest recorded  {{convert|108.57|kPa|inHg}}.  High- and low-pressure systems evolve due to interactions of temperature differentials in the atmosphere, temperature differences between the atmosphere and water within oceans and lakes, the influence of upper-level disturbances,{{technical statement|date=October 2013}} as well as the amount of solar heating or radiationized cooling an area receives.  Pressure systems  cause [[weather]] to be experienced locally.  Low-pressure systems are associated with [[cloud]]s and [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] that minimize temperature changes throughout the day, whereas high-pressure systems normally associate with dry weather and mostly clear skies with larger diurnal temperature changes due to greater radiation at night and greater sunshine during the day.  Pressure systems are analyzed by those in the field of [[meteorology]] within [[surface weather analysis|surface weather map]]s.

* Ahead of [[Shortwave (meteorology)|embedded shortwave troughs]], which have smaller wavelengths.

Diverging winds aloft ahead of these troughs cause [[atmospheric]] lift within the troposphere below, which lowers surface pressures as upward motion partially counteracts the force of gravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Atmosphere, Weather &amp; Climate|author=Roger G.

At night, the absence of clouds means that [[outgoing longwave radiation]] (i.e. heat energy from the surface) is not absorbed, giving cooler [[Diurnal temperature variation|diurnal]] low temperatures in all seasons.  When surface winds become light, the subsidence produced directly under a high-pressure system can lead to a buildup of particulates in urban areas under the ridge, leading to widespread [[haze]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Myanmar government|year=2007|url=http://www.kjc.gov.my/english/education/weather/haze01.html |title=Haze|publisher=Internet Wayback Machine|accessdate=2007-02-11 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080224035453/http://www.kjc.gov.my/english/education/weather/haze01.html |archivedate = 2008-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the low-level [[relative humidity]] rises towards 100 percent overnight, [[fog]] can form.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Tardif (2002).

The type of weather brought about by an anticyclone depends on its origin. For example, extensions of the Azores high bubble pressure may bring about anticyclonic gloom during the winter, as they are warmed at the base and will trap moisture as they move over the warmer oceans. High pressures that build to the north and extend southwards will often bring clear weather. This is due to being cooled at the base (as opposed to warmed), which helps prevent clouds from forming.  The highest barometric pressure ever recorded on Earth was {{convert|1085.7|hPa|inHg}} measured in [[Tosontsengel, Zavkhan|Tonsontsengel, Mongolia]] on 19 December 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=234|title=Extreme Weather|author=Christopher C.

A surface weather analysis is a type of [[weather map]] that depicts positions for [[high-pressure area|high]]- and [[low-pressure area]]s, as well as various types of [[synoptic scale]] systems such as [[weather fronts|frontal zones]].  Isotherms can be drawn on these maps, which are lines of equal temperature.  Isotherms are drawn normally as solid lines at a preferred temperature interval.&lt;ref name="DataAir"&gt;{{cite web|author=DataStreme Atmosphere|publisher=American Meteorological Society|url=http://www.ametsoc.org/amsedu/dstreme/learn/sample.act.html |title=Air Temperature Patterns|date=2008-04-28|accessdate=2010-02-07 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080511124504/http://www.ametsoc.org/amsedu/dstreme/learn/sample.act.html |archivedate = 2008-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They show temperature gradients, which can be useful in finding fronts, which are on the warm side of large temperature gradients.  By plotting the freezing line, isotherms can be useful in determination of precipitation type.  [[Mesoscale convective system]]s such as [[tropical cyclone]]s, outflow boundaries and [[squall line]]s also are analyzed on surface weather analyses.

Isobaric analysis is performed on these maps, which involves the construction of lines of equal mean [[sea level pressure]].  The innermost closed lines indicate the positions of relative maxima and minima in the pressure field.  The minima are called low-pressure areas, and the maxima are called [[high-pressure area]]s.  A ''High'' is often shown as '''H''', and a ''[[low-pressure area|low]]'' is shown as '''L'''.  Elongated areas of low pressure, or troughs, are sometimes plotted as thick, brown dashed lines down the trough axis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=University of Wisconsin|author=Edward J.

The '''RLIF World Rankings''' are the ranking system for men's national teams in the sport of [[rugby league football]]. The teams of the [[List of international Rugby League teams|member nations]] of the [[Rugby League International Federation]], rugby league football's world governing body, are ranked based on their game results with the most successful teams being ranked highest. A point system is used, with points being awarded based on the results of RLIF-recognized international matches. Under the existing system, rankings are based on a team's performance over the last three years, with more recent results and more significant matches being more heavily weighted to help reflect the current competitive state of a team.

==Ranking system==
The RLIF World Rankings are calculated based on an average of points accumulated by each nation over a three-year cycle. Under the structure, matches deemed of higher importance such as [[Rugby League World Cup|World Cup]] games, [[Rugby League Four Nations|Four Nations]] and other major tournament finals draw more points than mid-season Tests and other ‘Internationals’. For each match that a nation participates they are given a base level of points. This base level is affected upon the type of match (World Cup, Major Tournament, Test Match and International) and the status of the opponent.

Bonus points are given for teams that reach certain milestones deemed of significant international importance including reaching a tournament final or qualifying for an event such as a World Cup.

From the total number of points that a nation will receive these points are then averaged to help give a more accurate view of the performance of a nation over the three-year cycle.

Nations which have played fewer than 5 matches over a three-year cycle will be penalised under the current point structure.

==Use of the rankings==
The rankings are used by Rugby League International Federation to view the progression and ability of the [[List of international rugby league teams|national rugby league teams]].

The data is currently used in things as seeding for tournaments such as the [[Rugby League European Cup|European Cup]], [[Mediterranean Cup]] and [[Pacific Cup]].

== Current calculation method==

===Match status===
A weighting system has been implemented by the RLIF to give more points to teams if they gain a victory over a major team in a major tournament, with friendlies ranked with considerably fewer points than any World Cup finals match or the final of Cups such as the European, Mediterranean and Pacific Cups.

===Opponent strength===
The RLIF has organized the ranking so that a win against a very highly ranked opponent is a considerably greater achievement than a win against a low-rated opponent, so the strength of the opposing team is a factor.

===Assessment period===
All matches played over the last thirty-six months or three years are included in the calculation of the rankings, but there is a weighting system implemented to put more emphasis on recent results.

'''Solar power in Switzerland''' has been growing rapidly in recent years due to declining system costs and a [[feed-in tariff]] instituted by the Swiss government. In 2013, cumulative [[Nameplate capacity|capacity]] increased by 69% to 730 [[megawatt]]s (MW) and contributed 544&amp;nbsp;[[GWh]] or 0.8% of the countries net-electricity production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://origin.swissinfo.ch/eng/solar-power-output-almost-doubled-in-2013/37728302|title=Solar power output almost doubled in 2013|author=|publisher=[[swissinfo]]|accessdate=2014-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, another 320 megawatts were added bringing total installations to 1,076&amp;nbsp;MW and giving rise to Switzerland entering the group of currently twenty countries with a solar gigawatt market. As per the [[IEA-PVPS]]' calculations, the installed capacity by the end of 2014 should be enough to generate close to 2% of the domestic electricity demand—a significant increase compared to the 0.8% contributed by solar in 2013 ''(see charts below)''.&lt;ref&gt;

Historically, Switzerland had been a pioneer in solar [[photovoltaics]] in the 1980s and early 1990s but has since lost touch with the rapid-paced roll-out of solar by its world-leading southern and northern neighbors, [[Solar power in Italy|Italy]] and [[Solar power in Germany|Germany]]. However, the capped capacities that were put into place to avoid unregulated growth, were raised in recent years as the surcharge on consumed electricity to pay for the feed-in tariff had been increased by the parliament. As the country is [[phasing-out nuclear power]] and the [[Electricity sector in Switzerland|Swiss electricity sector]] is about to become completely [[Electricity liberalization|liberalized]], the electricity market is currently undergoing its largest change in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Liberalisation of the electricity market – at the customer's service |url=http://www.alpiq.com/the-energy-challenge/general-energy-policy/market-liberalization/market-liberalization.jsp |publisher=[[Alpiq]] |access-date=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swisselectric.ch/en/strommarkt.html |title=Electricity Market |publisher=SwissElectric |access-date=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Switzerland's largest solar photovoltaic plant has an output of 8.3 MW, built by Soleol SA and located in Onnens, Canton Waadt.

The federal government adopted [[feed-in tariffs]] to offer a cost-based compensation to renewable energy producers. The feed-in remuneration at cost (''KEV'', {{lang-de|Kostendeckende Einspeisevergütung}}, {{lang-fr|Rétribution à prix coûtant du courant injecté}}, {{lang-it|Rimunerazione a copertura dei costi per l'immissione in rete di energia elettrica}}) is the primary instrument for promoting the deployment of power systems using [[renewable energy sources]].

It covers the difference between the production and the market price, and guarantees producers of electricity from renewable sources  a price that corresponds to their production costs. The following renewable energy sources are supported by the KEV remuneration: distributed [[small hydro]] (with [[Nameplate capacity|capacities]] up to 10 [[megawatts|MW]]), [[solar photovoltaics]], [[wind power]], [[geothermal energy]], [[biomass]] and [[biogas]] (from agriculture, waste and water treatment).

The KEV remuneration is financed by collecting a surcharge on the consumed [[kilowatt-hour]] (kWh) of electricity. As in other countries, industries with a large electricity consumption are exempt from the surcharge, which has gradually been increased and stands at 1.5 cents per kWh as of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Die Neue Zürcher Zeitung, [http://www.nzz.ch/schweiz/opposition-gegen-energiepaket-erfolglos-1.18366424 (in German)], 20 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The remuneration tariffs for renewables have been specified based on reference power plants for each individual technology. Feed-in tariffs are applicable for 20 to 25 years, depending on the technology. For solar PV, the time-span was reduced from 25 to 20 years in 2014. In view of the anticipated technological progress and the increasing degree of market maturity of renewables energy technologies (especially for solar PV), the feed-in tariffs are subjected to a gradual reduction twice a year. These reductions only apply to new production facilities that are put into operation.

Planned installations of renewable power facilities have to be registered with [[Swissgrid]], the national network operator. As of the end of 2014, a growing waiting list for [[solar photovoltaic system]]s has accumulated as demand excess the capped capacities given by the currently available funds of the KEV remuneration.

'''''Suntory Mermaid II''''' is a 9.5-metre, 3-tonne [[catamaran]] driven by [[wave power]]. It features two fin tails which absorb wave energy and generate thrust by moving up and down with the motion of the boat. The ship was designed by [[Hiroshi Terao]] of [[Tokai University]].

==World record==
At approximately 1100 ([[Honolulu]] time) on March 16, 2008, then 69-year-old Japanese sailor and [[environmentalist]] [[Kenichi Horie]] left the Hawaii Yacht Club, [[Honolulu]], in ''Suntory Mermaid II'', bound for Japan. He arrived at 2349 (1449 UTC) on July 4, 2008 in the Kii Channel offshore of Hinomisaki cape, [[Wakayama Prefecture|Wakayama]], [[Japan]], without incident. Horie had made the world's longest solo voyage in a wave-powered boat, using green technology.&lt;ref name="afp.google.com"&gt;[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5g0joaEAMTHqfOtl2MAFNrhmW646A afp.google, Japanese sailor first to cross Pacific in wave-powered boat] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100909112258/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5g0joaEAMTHqfOtl2MAFNrhmW646A |date=September 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The non-stop voyage across the Western [[Pacific Ocean]] had taken 110 days and covered 7,000 kilometres (3,780 [[nautical miles]]. During the voyage, Horie ate mostly rice and curry, and squid and [[flying fish]] he caught.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ukpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5gh__u8TRDagqCjQyHrDdhhoaQICw ukpress.google.com, Wave-powered boat finishes crossing]{{dead link|date=November 2012|bot=Legobot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 9.5 metre (31-foot), three-ton [[yacht]] used [[wave energy]] to move two fins at its bow and propel it forward, sailing at an average speed of 1.5 [[knots]]. After arriving in [[Wakayama, Wakayama|Wakayama]], Horie sailed on to his home [[harbour]] in [[Nishinomiya]], where a homecoming ceremony was held.

''Suntory Mermaid II'' was powered by single [[solar cell|solar]] [[battery (electricity)|battery]] and made from recycled materials. Horie said: "Throughout history, mankind has used wind for power, but no one has appeared to be serious about wave power. I think I'm a lucky boy as this wave power system has remained virtually untouched."&lt;ref name="afp.google.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20080705/sc_afp/environmentclimatewarmingjapanwavesailingpeoplehorie_080705074552  yahoo.com, Japanese sailor first to cross Pacific in wave-powered boat] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080713110052/http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20080705/sc_afp/environmentclimatewarmingjapanwavesailingpeoplehorie_080705074552 |date=July 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{sustainable energy}}
'''Sustainable energy''' is [[energy]] that is consumed at insignificant rates compared to its supply and with manageable collateral effects, especially environmental effects. Another common definition of sustainable energy is an energy system that serves the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their energy needs.&lt;ref name=REEEP /&gt; Not all renewable energy is sustainable. While renewable energy is defined as energy sources that are naturally replenished on a human timescale, sustainable (often referred to as 'clean') energy must not compromise the system in which it is adopted to the point of being unable to provide for future need. The [[organizing principle]] for sustainability is [[sustainable development]], which includes the four interconnected domains: ecology, economics, politics and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= Magee | first2= Liam | last3= Scerri | first3= Andy | last4= Steger | first4= Manfred B. | title= Urban Sustainability in Theory and Practice:| url= https://www.academia.edu/9294719/Urban_Sustainability_in_Theory_and_Practice_Circles_of_Sustainability_2015_

Kahle, Eda Gurel-Atay, Eds|title=Communicating Sustainability for the Green Economy|year=2014|location=New York|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|isbn=978-0-7656-3680-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technologies promote [[sustainability|sustainable]] energy including [[renewable energy]] sources, such as [[hydroelectricity]], [[solar energy]], [[wind energy]], [[wave power]],{{cn|date=October 2017}} [[geothermal energy]], [[bioenergy]], [[tidal power]] and also technologies designed to improve [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]]. Costs have decreased immensely throughout the years, and continue to fall. Increasingly, effective government policies support investor confidence and these markets are expanding. Considerable progress is being made in the [[energy transition]] from fossil fuels to ecologically sustainable systems, to the point where many studies support [[100% renewable energy]].

==History==
{{expand section|date=November 2018}}

==Definitions==
Energy efficiency and renewable energy are said to be the ''twin pillars'' of sustainable energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Obrecht|first1=Matevz|last2=Denac|first2=Matjaz|title=A sustainable energy policy for Slovenia: Considering the potential of renewables and investment costs|journal=Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy|date=2013|volume=5|issue=7|url=http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/jrse/5/3/10.1063/1.4811283|doi=10.1063/1.4811283|page=032301}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paenergyfuture.psu.edu/pubs/aceee_reports/aceee2007sustainable.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150111000420/http://www.paenergyfuture.psu.edu/pubs/aceee_reports/aceee2007sustainable.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=11 January 2015 |title=The Twin Pillars of Sustainable Energy: Synergies between Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Technology and Policy |publisher=Aceee.org |accessdate= 17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the broader context of sustainable development, there are three pillars, ecology, economy and society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrpub.org/download/20140525/EEE1-14502234.pdf |title=Data |website=www.hrpub.org |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some ways in which ''sustainable energy'' has been defined are:
* "Effectively, the provision of energy such that it meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. ...Sustainable Energy has two key components: renewable energy and energy efficiency."&amp;nbsp;– ''Renewable Energy and Efficiency Partnership'' (British)&lt;ref name=REEEP&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reeep.org/sites/default/files/Glossary%20of%20Terms%20in%20Sustainable%20Energy%20Regulation.pdf |title=Glossary of terms in sustainable energy regulation |author1=Renewable Energy |author2=Efficiency Partnership |lastauthoramp=yes |date=August 2004 |accessdate=2008-12-19 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Dynamic harmony between equitable availability of energy-intensive goods and services to all people and the preservation of the earth for future generations." And, "The solution will lie in finding sustainable energy sources and more efficient means of converting and utilizing energy."&amp;nbsp;– ''Sustainable Energy'' by J. W. Tester, ''et al.'', from MIT Press.
* "Any energy generation, efficiency and conservation source where: Resources are available to enable massive scaling to become a significant portion of energy generation, long term, preferably 100 years.."&amp;nbsp;– ''Invest,'' a green technology non-profit organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.invvest.org/blog/invVEST-Definition-of-Sustainable-Energy/ |title=The Sustainable Energy Community :: invVest &amp;#124; invVEST Definition of Sustainable Energy |publisher=invVest |accessdate=2010-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Energy which is replenishable within a human lifetime and causes no long-term damage to the environment."&amp;nbsp;– ''Jamaica Sustainable Development Network''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jsdnp.org.jm/glossary.html |title=Glossary of terms |author=Jamaica Sustainable Development Network |accessdate=2008-04-19 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071130092351/http://www.jsdnp.org.jm/glossary.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This sets ''sustainable energy'' apart from other [[renewable energy]] terminology such as ''[[alternative energy]]'' by focusing on the ability of an energy source to continue providing energy. Sustainable energy can produce some pollution of the environment, as long as it is not sufficient to prohibit heavy use of the source for an indefinite amount of time. Sustainable energy is also distinct from [[Low-carbon economy|low-carbon energy]], which is sustainable only in the sense that it does not add to the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the atmosphere.

Green Energy is energy that can be extracted, generated, and/or consumed without any significant negative impact to the environment. The planet has a natural capability to recover which means pollution that does not go beyond that capability can still be termed green.

Green power is a subset of renewable energy and represents those renewable energy resources and technologies that provide the highest environmental benefit. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] defines green power as electricity produced from [[solar energy|solar]], [[wind energy|wind]], [[geothermal energy|geothermal]], [[biogas]], [[biomass]] and low-impact small [[hydroelectric]] sources. Customers often buy green power for avoided environmental impacts and its [[greenhouse gas]] reduction benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/greenpower/gpmarket/index.htm |title=Green Power Defined &amp;#124; Green Power Partnership &amp;#124; US EPA |publisher=Epa.gov |date=2006-06-28 |accessdate=2010-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renewable energy technologies==
{{Main article|Renewable energy |Renewable energy commercialization}}

Renewable energy technologies are essential contributors to sustainable energy as they generally contribute to world [[energy security]], reducing dependence on [[fossil fuel]] resources,&lt;ref name="IEA"&gt;International Energy Agency (2007).
[http://www.iea.org/textbase/papers/2006/renewable_factsheet.pdf ''Renewables in global energy supply: An IEA facts sheet''], OECD, 34 pages. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091012052513/http://www.iea.org/textbase/papers/2006/renewable_factsheet.pdf |date=12 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and providing opportunities for mitigating greenhouse gases.&lt;ref name="IEA" /&gt; The [[International Energy Agency]] states that:

{{quote|Conceptually, one can define three generations of renewables technologies, reaching back more than 100 years .

First-generation technologies emerged from the [[industrial revolution]] at the end of the 19th century and include [[hydropower]], [[biomass]] combustion and [[geothermal power]] and heat. Some of these technologies are still in widespread use.

Second-generation technologies include [[solar heating]] and cooling, [[wind power]], modern forms of [[bioenergy]] and [[solar photovoltaics]]. These are now entering markets as a result of research, development and demonstration (RD&amp;D) investments since the 1980s. The initial investment was prompted by [[energy security]] concerns linked to the oil crises ([[1973 oil crisis|1973]] and [[1979 energy crisis|1979]]) of the 1970s but the continuing appeal of these renewables is due, at least in part, to environmental benefits. Many of the technologies reflect significant advancements in materials.

Third-generation technologies are still under development and include advanced [[biomass gasification]], [[biorefinery]] technologies, concentrating [[solar thermal]] power, [[hot dry rock geothermal energy]] and [[ocean energy]]. Advances in [[nanotechnology]] may also play a major role.|International Energy Agency|''RENEWABLES IN GLOBAL ENERGY SUPPLY, An IEA Fact Sheet''&lt;ref name="IEA"/&gt;}}
First- and second-generation technologies have entered the markets, and third-generation technologies heavily depend on long term research and development commitments, where the public sector has a role to play.&lt;ref name="IEA"/&gt;

Various [[Cost–benefit analysis]] work by a disparate array of specialists and agencies have been conducted to determine the cheapest and quickest paths to decarbonizing the energy supply of the world.

{{quote|First-generation technologies are most competitive in locations with abundant resources. Their future use depends on the exploration of the available resource potential, particularly in developing countries, and on overcoming challenges related to the environment and social acceptance.|International Energy Agency|''RENEWABLES IN GLOBAL ENERGY SUPPLY, An IEA Fact Sheet''&lt;ref name="IEA"/&gt;}} Among sources of renewable energy, hydroelectric plants have the advantages of being long-lived—many existing plants have operated for more than 100 years. Also, hydroelectric plants are clean and have few emissions. Criticisms directed at large-scale hydroelectric plants include: dislocation of people living where the reservoirs are planned, and release of [[Greenhouse gas#Life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources|significant amounts of carbon dioxide]] during construction and flooding of the reservoir.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7046 Hydroelectric power's dirty secret revealed] ''New Scientist'', 24 February 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nishidaira Dam.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hydroelectricity|Hydroelectric dams]] are one of the most widely deployed sources of sustainable energy.]]

However, it has been found that high emissions are associated only with shallow reservoirs in warm (tropical) locales, and recent innovations in hydropower turbine technology are enabling efficient development of low-impact [[run-of-the-river hydroelectricity]] projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ferris|first=David|title=The Power of the Dammed: How Small Hydro Could Rescue America's Dumb Dams|url=http://www.ecomagination.com/the-power-of-the-dammed-how-small-hydro-could-rescue-america-dumb-dams|accessdate=4 January 2012|date=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally speaking, hydroelectric plants produce much lower life-cycle emissions than other types of generation. Hydroelectric power, which underwent extensive development during growth of electrification in the 19th and 20th centuries, is experiencing resurgence of development in the 21st century. The areas of greatest hydroelectric growth are the booming economies of Asia. China is the development leader; however, other Asian nations are installing hydropower at a rapid pace. This growth is driven by much increased energy costs—especially for imported energy—and widespread desires for more domestically produced, clean, renewable, and economical generation.

[[Geothermal power]] plants can operate 24 hours per day, providing base-load capacity, and the world potential capacity for geothermal power generation is estimated at 85 GW over the next 30 years. However, geothermal power is accessible only in limited areas of the world, including the [[Geothermal energy in the United States|United States]], Central America, East Africa, [[Geothermal power in Iceland|Iceland]], [[Geothermal power in Indonesia|Indonesia]], and the [[Geothermal power in the Philippines|Philippines]]. The costs of geothermal energy have dropped substantially from the systems built in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="IEA" /&gt; [[Geothermal heat]] generation can be competitive in many countries producing geothermal power, or in other regions where the resource is of a lower temperature. [[Enhanced geothermal system]] (EGS) technology does not require natural convective hydrothermal resources, so it can be used in areas that were previously unsuitable for geothermal power, if the resource is very large. EGS is currently under research at the U.S. Department of Energy.

[[Biomass briquettes]] are increasingly being used in the developing world as an alternative to charcoal. The technique involves the conversion of almost any plant matter into compressed briquettes that typically have about 70% the calorific value of charcoal. There are relatively few examples of large-scale briquette production. One exception is in [[North Kivu]], in eastern [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], where forest clearance for charcoal production is considered to be the biggest threat to mountain gorilla habitat. The staff of [[Virunga National Park]] have successfully trained and equipped over 3500 people to produce biomass briquettes, thereby replacing charcoal produced illegally inside the national park, and creating significant employment for people living in extreme poverty in conflict-affected areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In Europe in the 19th century, there were about 200,000 windmills, slightly more than the modern wind turbines of the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2009/10/history-of-industrial-windmills.html|title=Wind powered factories: history (and future) of industrial windmills|website=LOW-TECH MAGAZINE}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were mainly used to grind grain and to pump water. The age of coal powered steam engines replaced this early use of wind power.

{{quote|Markets for second-generation technologies are strong and growing, but only in a few countries. The challenge is to broaden the market base for continued growth worldwide.

[[Solar heating]] systems are a well known second-generation technology and generally consist of solar thermal collectors, a fluid system to move the heat from the collector to its point of usage, and a reservoir or tank for heat storage and subsequent use. The systems may be used to heat domestic hot water, swimming pool water, or for space heating.&lt;ref&gt;

Energy received from the sun by the earth is that of electromagnetic radiation. Light ranges of visible, infrared, ultraviolet, x-rays, and radio waves received by the earth through solar energy. The highest power of radiation comes from visible light. Solar power is complicated due to changes in seasons and from day to night. Cloud cover can also add to complications of solar energy, and not all radiation from the sun reaches earth because it is absorbed and dispersed due to clouds and gases within the earth's atmospheres.&lt;ref&gt;''Energy and the Environment'', Jack J Kraushaar and Robert A Ristinen, section 4.2 ''Energy from the Sun'' pg.92&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s and early 1990s, most photovoltaic modules provided [[remote-area power supply]], but from around 1995, industry efforts have focused increasingly on developing [[building integrated photovoltaics]] and power plants for grid connected applications (see [[photovoltaic power stations]] article for details).

Some of the second-generation renewables, such as wind power, have high potential and have already realised relatively low production costs.

Solar and wind are [[Intermittent energy source]]s that supply electricity 10-40% of the time. To compensate for this characteristic, it is common to pair their production with already existing hydroelectricity or [[Natural gas#Power generation|natural gas generation]]. In regions where this isn't available, wind and solar can be paired with significantly more expensive [[pumped-storage hydroelectricity]].

===Enabling technologies for renewable energy===
[[Heat pumps]] and [[Thermal energy storage]] are classes of technologies that can enable the utilization of renewable energy sources that would otherwise be inaccessible due to a temperature that is too low for utilization or a time lag between when the energy is available and when it is needed. While enhancing the temperature of available renewable thermal energy, heat pumps have the additional property of leveraging electrical power (or in some cases mechanical or thermal power) by using it to extract additional energy from a low quality source (such as seawater, lake water, the ground, the air, or waste heat from a process).

Thermal storage technologies allow heat or cold to be stored for periods of time ranging from hours or overnight to [[Seasonal thermal energy storage|interseasonal]], and can involve storage of [[Sensible heat|sensible energy]] (i.e. by changing the temperature of a medium) or [[latent energy]] (i.e. through phase changes of a medium, such between water and slush or ice). Short-term thermal storages can be used for peak-shaving in district heating or electrical distribution systems. Kinds of renewable or alternative energy sources that can be enabled include natural energy (e.g. collected via solar-thermal collectors, or dry cooling towers used to collect winter's cold), waste energy (e.g. from HVAC equipment, industrial processes or power plants), or surplus energy (e.g. as seasonally from hydropower projects or intermittently from wind farms). The [[Drake Landing Solar Community]] (Alberta, Canada) is illustrative. [[Seasonal thermal energy storage|borehole thermal energy storage]] allows the community to get 97% of its year-round heat from solar collectors on the garage roofs, which most of the heat collected in summer.&lt;ref&gt;Wong, Bill (28 June 2011), [http://www.districtenergy.org/assets/pdfs/2011Annual_Conf/Proceedings/A24WONG-v03.pdf "Drake Landing Solar Community"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030520/http://www.districtenergy.org/assets/pdfs/2011Annual_Conf/Proceedings/A24WONG-v03.pdf |date=4 March 2016 }}, IDEA/CDEA District Energy/CHP 2011 Conference, Toronto, pp. 1–30, retrieved 21 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wong B., Thornton J.

Some types of storage are capable of storing heat or cold between opposing seasons (particularly if very large), and some storage applications require inclusion of a [[Heat pumps|heat pump]]. Latent heat is typically stored in ice tanks or what are called [[phase-change material]]s (PCMs).

==Energy efficiency==
Moving towards energy sustainability will require changes not only in the way energy is supplied, but in the way it is used, and reducing the amount of energy required to deliver various goods or services is essential. Opportunities for improvement on the demand side of the energy equation are as rich and diverse as those on the supply side, and often offer significant economic benefits.&lt;ref&gt;InterAcademy Council (2007). [http://www.interacademycouncil.net/File.aspx?id=24548 ''Lighting the way: Toward a sustainable energy future'' p. xvii.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Renewable energy and [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] are sometimes said to be the "twin pillars" of sustainable energy policy. Both resources must be developed in order to stabilize and reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Efficiency slows down energy demand growth so that rising clean energy supplies can make deep cuts in fossil fuel use. If energy use grows too fast, renewable energy development will chase a receding target. A recent historical analysis has demonstrated that the rate of [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] improvements has generally been outpaced by the rate of growth in energy demand, which is due to continuing economic and [[population growth]]. As a result, despite energy efficiency gains, total energy use and related carbon emissions have continued to increase. Thus, given the thermodynamic and practical limits of energy efficiency improvements, slowing the growth in energy demand is essential.&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011). [http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org ''Technofix: Why Technology Won’t Save Us or the Environment''], Chapter 5, "In Search of Solutions: Efficiency Improvements", New Society Publishers, {{ISBN|978-0-86571-704-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, unless clean energy supplies come online rapidly, slowing demand growth will only begin to reduce total emissions; reducing the carbon content of energy sources is also needed. Any serious vision of a sustainable energy economy thus requires commitments to both renewables and efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (2007).

Renewable energy (and energy efficiency) are no longer niche sectors that are promoted only by governments and environmentalists. The increased levels of investment and the fact that much of the capital is coming from more conventional financial actors suggest that sustainable energy options are now becoming mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Environment Programme and New Energy Finance Ltd. (2007), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this would be The [[Alliance to Save Energy]]'s Project with Stahl Consolidated Manufacturing, (Huntsville, Alabama, USA) (StahlCon 7), a patented generator shaft designed to reduce emissions within existing power generating systems, granted publishing rights to the Alliance in 2007.

[[Climate change]] concerns coupled with [[Oil price increases since 2003|high oil prices]] and increasing government support are driving increasing rates of investment in the sustainable energy industries, according to a trend analysis from the [[United Nations Environment Programme]]. According to [[UNEP]], global investment in sustainable energy in 2007 was higher than previous levels, with $148 billion of new money raised in 2007, an increase of 60% over 2006. Total financial transactions in sustainable energy, including acquisition activity, was $204 billion.&lt;ref name=invest&gt;[http://sefi.unep.org/fileadmin/media/sefi/docs/publications/Global_Trends_2008.pdf Global Trends in Sustainable Energy Investment 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908124238/http://sefi.unep.org/fileadmin/media/sefi/docs/publications/Global_Trends_2008.pdf |date=8 September 2008 }} p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Investment flows in 2007 broadened and diversified, making the overall picture one of greater breadth and depth of sustainable energy use. The mainstream capital markets are "now fully receptive to sustainable energy companies, supported by a surge in funds destined for clean energy investment".&lt;ref name=invest/&gt;

===Smart-grid technology===
{{Main article|Smart grid}}

Smart grid refers to a class of technology people are using to bring utility electricity delivery systems into the 21st century, using computer-based remote control and automation.&lt;ref name="Smart grid"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energy.gov/oe/technology-development/smart-grid |title=Smart Grid &amp;#124; Department of Energy |publisher=Energy.gov |accessdate=2013-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; These systems are made possible by two-way communication technology and computer processing that has been used for decades in other industries. They are beginning to be used on electricity networks, from the power plants and wind farms all the way to the consumers of electricity in homes and businesses. They offer many benefits to utilities and consumers—mostly seen in big improvements in energy efficiency on the electricity grid and in the energy users’ homes and offices.&lt;ref name="Smart grid"/&gt;

=={{anchor|Green energy}}Green energy and green power==

[[File:Solar panel for charging phone.jpg|thumb|Public seat with integrated solar panel in [[Singapore]]-anyone can sit and plug in their mobile phone for free charging]]

Green energy includes natural energetic processes that can be harnessed with little pollution. Green power is electricity generated from [[renewable energy]] sources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/greenpower.shtml Green power], fueleconomy.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anaerobic digestion]], [[geothermal power]], [[wind power]], small-scale [[hydropower]], [[solar energy]], [[biomass power]], [[tidal power]], [[wave power]], and some forms of [[nuclear power]] (ones which are able to "burn" nuclear waste through a process known as [[nuclear transmutation]], such as an [[Integral Fast Reactor]], and therefore belong in the "Green Energy" category). Some definitions may also include power derived from the [[incineration]] of waste.

''The Revenge of Gaia''. Reprinted Penguin, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-14-102990-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; have specifically classified [[nuclear power]] as green energy. Others, including [[Greenpeace]]'s [[Phil Radford]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/campaigns/nuclear |title=End the nuclear age &amp;#124; Greenpeace International |publisher=Greenpeace.org |accessdate=2010-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/files/pdfs/nuclear/nuclear-power-briefing.pdf|title=The Case Against Nuclear Power - Greenpeace International|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924024422/http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/files/pdfs/nuclear/nuclear-power-briefing.pdf|archivedate=24 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; disagree, claiming that the problems associated with [[radioactive waste]] and the risk of nuclear accidents (such as the [[Chernobyl disaster]]) pose an unacceptable risk to the environment and to humanity. However, newer nuclear reactor designs are capable of utilizing what is now deemed "nuclear waste" until it is no longer (or dramatically less) dangerous, and have design features that greatly minimize the possibility of a nuclear accident. These designs have yet to be commercialized. (See: [[Molten salt reactor]])

Some have argued that although green energy is a commendable effort in solving the world's increasing energy consumption, it must be accompanied by a cultural change that encourages the decrease of the world's appetite for energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erb.umich.edu/Research/Faculty-Research/AJHclimateChangeCulturalBehavior.pdf|title=Climate Change as a Cultural and Behavioral Issue: Addressing Barriers and Implementing Solutions|publisher=ScienceDirect|year=2010|accessdate=2013-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In several [[nation|countries]] with [[common carrier]] arrangements, [[electricity retailing]] arrangements make it possible for consumers to purchase green electricity ([[renewable electricity]]) from either their utility or a green power provider.

When energy is purchased from the electricity network, the power reaching the consumer will not necessarily be generated from green energy sources. The local [[public utility|utility company]], [[electrical power industry|electric company]], or state power pool buys their electricity from [[electricity generation|electricity producers]] who may be generating from [[fossil fuel]], [[Nuclear power|nuclear]] or renewable energy sources. In many countries green energy currently provides a very small amount of electricity, generally contributing less than 2 to 5% to the overall pool. In some U.S. states, local governments have formed regional power purchasing pools using [[Community Choice Aggregation]] and [[Solar Bonds]] to achieve a 51% renewable mix or higher, such as in the City of San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;San Francisco Community Choice Program Design, Draft Implementation Plan and H Bond Action Plan, Ordinance 447-07, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

By participating in a green energy program a consumer may be having an effect on the energy sources used and ultimately might be helping to promote and expand the use of green energy. They are also making a statement to policy makers that they are willing to pay a price premium to support renewable energy. Green energy consumers either obligate the utility companies to increase the amount of green energy that they purchase from the pool (so decreasing the amount of non-green energy they purchase), or directly fund the green energy through a green power provider. If insufficient green energy sources are available, the utility must develop new ones or [[contract]] with a third party energy supplier to provide green energy, causing more to be built. However, there is no way the consumer can check whether or not the electricity bought is "green" or otherwise.

In some countries such as the Netherlands, electricity companies guarantee to buy an equal amount of 'green power' as is being used by their green power customers. The [[Netherlands|Dutch]] government exempts green power from pollution taxes, which means green power is hardly any more expensive than other power.

A more recent concept for improving our electrical grid is to beam microwaves from Earth-orbiting satellites or the moon to directly when and where there is demand. The power would be generated from solar energy captured on the lunar surface In this system, the receivers would be "broad, translucent tent-like structures that would receive microwaves and convert them to electricity". NASA said in 2000 that the technology was worth pursuing but it is still too soon to say if the technology will be cost-effective.&lt;ref&gt;[Britt, Robert Roy. "Could Space-Based Power Plants Prevent Blackouts?". Science. (15 August 2003)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] and several green electricity labelling organizations created the (now defunct) [[Eugene Green Energy Standard]] under which the national green electricity certification schemes could be accredited to ensure that the purchase of green energy leads to the provision of additional new green energy resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eugenestandard.org/ Eugene Green Energy Standard], Eugene Network. Retrieved 2007-06-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

Innovative green energy trends and solutions were at the center of discussion at [[Expo 2017|EXPO 2017]] in Astana, Kazakhstan. Specialized Expo 2017 was themed "Future Energy" and brought together representatives of 115 countries and 22 international organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bie-paris.org/site/en/2017-astana|title=Expo Astana 2017|website=www.bie-paris.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those not satisfied with the third-party grid approach to green energy via the power grid can install their own locally based renewable energy system. Renewable energy electrical systems from solar to wind to even local hydro-power in some cases, are some of the many types of renewable energy systems available locally. Additionally, for those interested in heating and cooling their dwelling via renewable energy, [[geothermal exchange heat pump|geothermal heat pump]] systems that tap the constant [[temperature]] of the earth, which is around 7 to 15 degrees [[Celsius]] a few feet underground and increases dramatically at greater depths, are an option over conventional [[natural gas]] and [[petroleum]]-fueled heat approaches. Also, in geographic locations where the [[Crust (geology)|Earth's Crust]] is especially thin, or near [[volcanoes]] (as is the case in [[Iceland]]) there exists the potential to generate even more electricity than would be possible at other sites, thanks to a more significant [[temperature gradient]] at these locales.

The advantage of this approach in the United States is that many states offer incentives to offset the cost of installation of a renewable energy system. In California, Massachusetts and several other U.S. states, a new approach to community energy supply called [[Community Choice Aggregation]] has provided communities with the means to solicit a competitive electricity supplier and use municipal revenue bonds to finance development of local green energy resources. Individuals are usually assured that the electricity they are using is actually produced from a green energy source that they control. Once the system is paid for, the owner of a renewable energy system will be producing their own renewable electricity for essentially no cost and can sell the excess to the local utility at a profit.

===Using green energy===
{{Main article|Energy storage|Grid energy storage|Bio-energy with carbon capture and storage}}
[[File:Micro WindMill.jpg|thumb|A 01 KiloWatt Micro Windmill for Domestic Usage]]
Renewable energy, after its generation, needs to be stored in a medium for use with autonomous devices as well as vehicles&lt;!-- what does "autonomous devices mean! Please don't use such puzzling words!--&gt;. Also, to provide household electricity in remote areas (that is areas which are not connected to the [[Mains electricity|mains electricity grid]]), energy storage is required for use with renewable energy. Energy generation and consumption systems used in the latter case are usually [[stand-alone power system]]s.

Some examples are:
* energy carriers as [[hydrogen]], [[liquid nitrogen]], [[compressed air]], [[oxyhydrogen]], [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]], to power vehicles.
* [[flywheel energy storage]], [[pumped-storage hydroelectricity]] is more usable in stationary applications (e.g. to power homes and offices). In household power systems, conversion of energy can also be done to reduce smell. For example, organic matter such as cow dung and spoilable organic matter can be converted to [[biochar]]. To eliminate emissions, [[carbon capture and storage]] is then used.

Usually however, renewable energy is derived from the mains electricity grid. This means that energy storage is mostly not used, as the mains electricity grid is organised to produce the exact amount of energy being consumed at that particular moment. Energy production on the mains electricity grid is always set up as a combination of (large-scale) renewable energy plants, as well as other power plants as [[fossil-fuel power plant]]s and [[nuclear power]]. This combination however, which is essential for this type of energy supply (as e.g. wind turbines, solar power plants etc.) can only produce when the wind blows and the sun shines. This is also one of the main drawbacks of the system as fossil fuel powerplants are polluting and are a main cause of [[global warming]] (nuclear power being an exception). Although fossil fuel power plants too can be made emissionless (through carbon capture and storage), as well as renewable (if the plants are converted to e.g. biomass) the best solution is still to phase out the latter power plants over time. Nuclear power plants too can be more or less eliminated from their problem of nuclear waste through the use of [[nuclear reprocessing]] and newer plants as [[Fast breeder reactor|fast breeder]] and [[nuclear fusion]] plants.

Renewable energy power plants do provide a steady flow of energy. For example, hydropower plants, ocean thermal plants, osmotic power plants all provide power at a regulated pace, and are thus available power sources at any given moment (even at night, windstill moments etc.). At present however, the number of steady-flow renewable energy plants alone is still too small to meet energy demands at the times of the day when the irregular producing renewable energy plants cannot produce power.

Besides the greening of fossil fuel and nuclear power plants, another option is the distribution and immediate use of power from solely renewable sources. In this set-up energy storage is again not necessary. For example, [[Trans-Mediterranean Renewable Energy Cooperation|TREC]] has proposed to distribute solar power from the Sahara to Europe. Europe can distribute wind and ocean power to the Sahara and other countries. In this way, power is produced at any given time as at any point of the planet as the sun or the wind is up or ocean waves and currents are stirring. This option however is probably not possible in the short-term, as fossil fuel and nuclear power are still the main sources of energy on the mains electricity net and replacing them will not be possible overnight.

Several [[Grid energy storage|large-scale energy storage suggestions for the grid]] have been done. Worldwide there is over 100&amp;nbsp;GW of [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity]]. This improves efficiency and decreases energy losses but a conversion to an energy storing mains electricity grid is a very costly solution. Some costs could potentially be reduced by making use of energy storage equipment the consumer buys and not the state. An example is [[Grid energy storage|batteries]] in electric cars that would double as an energy buffer for the electricity grid. However besides the cost, setting-up such a system would still be a very complicated and difficult procedure. Also, energy storage apparatus' as car batteries are also built with materials that pose a threat to the environment (e.g. Lithium). The combined production of batteries for such a large part of the population would still have environmental concerns. Besides car batteries however, other [[Grid energy storage]] projects make use of less polluting energy carriers (e.g. compressed air tanks and flywheel energy storage).

===Green energy and labeling by region===

====European Union====

European environmental NGOs have launched an ecolabel for green power. The ecolabel is called [[EKOenergy]]. It sets criteria for sustainability, additionality, consumer information and tracking. Only part of electricity produced by renewables fulfills the EKOenergy criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekoenergy.org |title=The European ecolabel for electricity |publisher=EKOenergy |accessdate=2013-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Green electricity in the United Kingdom#The Green Energy Supply Certification Scheme|Green Energy Supply Certification Scheme]] was launched in the United Kingdom in February 2010. This implements guidelines from the Energy Regulator, [[Ofgem]], and sets requirements on transparency, the matching of sales by renewable energy supplies, and additionality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenenergyscheme.org/ Green Energy Supply Certification Scheme website], accessed 16 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The most popular way to purchase renewable energy as revealed by [[NREL]] data is through purchasing [[Renewable Energy Certificate]]s (RECs). According to a [[Natural Marketing Institute]] (NMI)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmisolutions.com |title=Health &amp; Wellness Consumer Market Research. Strategic Consulting |publisher=Nmisolutions.com |accessdate=2010-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; survey 55 percent of American consumers want companies to increase their use of renewable energy.&lt;ref name="renewableenergyworld.com"/&gt;

DOE selected six companies for its 2007 Green Power Supplier Awards, including [[Constellation NewEnergy]]; [[3Degrees]]; [[Sterling Planet]]; [[SunEdison]]; [[PacifiCorp|Pacific Power]] and [[Rocky Mountain Power]]; and [[Silicon Valley Power]]. The combined green power provided by those six winners equals more than 5 billion [[kilowatt-hour]]s per year, which is enough to power nearly 465,000 average U.S. households. In 2014, Arcadia Power made RECS available to homes and businesses in all 50 states, allowing consumers to use "100% green power" as defined by the EPA's Green Power Partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Green Power Partnership|url=http://www.epa.gov/greenpower/index.htm|website=EPA.gov|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422075645/http://www.epa.gov/greenpower/index.htm|archivedate=22 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How It Works|url=http://arcadiapower.com/how-it-works/|website=ArcadiaPower.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (USEPA) Green Power Partnership is a voluntary program that supports the organizational procurement of [[renewable electricity]] by offering expert advice, technical support, tools and resources. This can help organizations lower the transaction costs of buying renewable power, reduce [[carbon footprint]], and communicate its leadership to key stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/grnpower/ |title=Green Power Partnership &amp;#124; US EPA |publisher=Epa.gov |date=2006-06-28 |accessdate=2010-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the country, more than half of all U.S. electricity customers now have an option to purchase some type of green power product from a retail [[electricity market|electricity provider]]. Roughly one-quarter of the nation's utilities offer green power programs to customers, and voluntary retail sales of renewable energy in the United States totaled more than 12 billion kilowatt-hours in 2006, a 40% increase over the previous year.

In the United States, one of the main problems with purchasing green energy through the electrical grid is the current centralized infrastructure that supplies the consumer’s electricity. This infrastructure has led to increasingly frequent brown outs and black outs, high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions, higher energy costs, and power quality issues.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Energy Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability.[http://energy.gov/oe/office-electricity-delivery-and-energy-reliability]&lt;/ref&gt; An additional $450 billion will be invested to expand this fledgling system over the next 20 years to meet increasing demand.&lt;ref&gt;"Energy Distribution" U.S. Department of Energy Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability.[http://www.electricdistribution.ctc.com/pdfs/GridWise%20Fact%20Sheet%20Jan05]{{dead link|date=April 2018|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, this centralized system is now being further overtaxed with the incorporation of renewable energies such as wind, solar, and geothermal energies. Renewable resources, due to the amount of space they require, are often located in remote areas where there is a lower energy demand. The current infrastructure would make transporting this energy to high demand areas, such as urban centers, highly inefficient and in some cases impossible. In addition, despite the amount of renewable energy produced or the economic viability of such technologies only about 20 percent will be able to be incorporated into the grid. To have a more sustainable energy profile, the United States must move towards implementing changes to the electrical grid that will accommodate a mixed-fuel economy.&lt;ref&gt;[Whittington, H.W.

Several initiatives are being proposed to mitigate distribution problems. First and foremost, the most effective way to reduce USA’s CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions and slow global warming is through conservation efforts. Opponents of the current US electrical grid have also advocated for decentralizing the grid. This system would increase efficiency by reducing the amount of energy lost in transmission. It would also be economically viable as it would reduce the amount of power lines that will need to be constructed in the future to keep up with demand. Merging heat and power in this system would create added benefits and help to increase its efficiency by up to 80-90%. This is a significant increase from the current fossil fuel plants which only have an efficiency of 34%.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Romm|Romm, Joseph]]; Levine, Mark; Brown, Marilyn; Peterson, Eric.

==Sustainable energy research==
{{Main|Renewable energy}}
There are numerous organizations within the academic, federal, and commercial sectors conducting large scale advanced research in the field of sustainable energy. This research spans several areas of focus across the sustainable energy spectrum. Most of the research is targeted at improving efficiency and increasing overall energy yields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Increasing the energy yield of generation from new and sustainable energy sources | journal = Sustainable energy | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | year = 2007 | pages = 37–62 |author1=S.C.E. Jupe |author2=A. Michiorri |author3=P.C. Taylor }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Multiple federally supported research organizations have focused on sustainable energy in recent years. Two of the most prominent of these labs are [[Sandia National Laboratories]] and the [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] (NREL), both of which are funded by the [[United States Department of Energy]] and supported by various corporate partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://share.sandia.gov/news/resources/news_releases/redmesa/|title=Defense-scale supercomputing comes to sustainable energy research|accessdate=2012-04-16|publisher=[[Sandia National Laboratories]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sandia has a total budget of $2.4 billion &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nnsa.energy.gov/sites/default/files/nnsa/inlinefiles/SNL%20Factsheet.pdf |title=Sandia National Laboratories |accessdate=2012-04-16 |publisher=[[Sandia National Laboratories]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020170422/http://nnsa.energy.gov/sites/default/files/nnsa/inlinefiles/SNL%20Factsheet.pdf |archivedate=20 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; while NREL has a budget of $375 million.&lt;ref&gt;*Chakrabarty, Gargi, 16 April 2009.

Biomass is [[Biomaterial|biological material]] derived from living, or recently living organisms. It most often refers to plants or plant-derived materials which are specifically called [[lignocellulosic biomass]].&lt;ref name="Biomass Energy Center"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061008081905/http://www.biomassenergycentre.org.uk/portal/page?_pageid=76,15049&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL Biomass Energy Center]. Biomassenergycentre.org.uk. Retrieved on 28 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; As an energy source, biomass can either be used directly via combustion to produce heat, or indirectly after converting it to various forms of [[biofuel]]. Conversion of biomass to biofuel can be achieved by different methods which are broadly classified into: ''thermal'', ''chemical'', and ''biochemical'' methods. Wood remains the largest biomass energy source today;&lt;ref name="online.wsj.com"&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303740704577524822063133842] Retrieved on 12 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; examples include forest residues – such as dead trees, branches and [[tree stump]]s –, yard clippings, wood chips and even [[municipal solid waste]]. In the second sense, biomass includes plant or animal matter that can be converted into fibers or other industrial [[Chemical industry|chemicals]], including [[biofuel]]s. Industrial biomass can be grown from numerous types of plants, including [[miscanthus]], [[switchgrass]], [[hemp]], [[maize|corn]], [[Populus|poplar]], [[willow]], [[sorghum]], [[sugarcane]], [[bamboo]],&lt;ref&gt;

Biomass, biogas and biofuels are burned to produce heat/power and in doing so harm the environment. Pollutants such as sulphurous oxides (SO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;), nitrous oxides (NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;), and particulate matter (PM) are produced from this combustion; the World Health Organisation estimates that 7 million premature deaths are caused each year by air pollution.&lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2014/air-pollution/en/|title=WHO - 7 million premature deaths annually linked to air pollution|website=www.who.int}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biomass combustion is a major contributor.&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs313/en/|title=Ambient (outdoor) air quality and health|website=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs292/en/|title=Household air pollution and health|website=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethanol biofuels===
{{Main article|Ethanol fuel}}
As the primary source of biofuel in North America, many organizations are conducting research in the area of [[ethanol]] production. On the Federal level, the [[USDA]] conducts a large amount of research regarding ethanol production in the United States. Much of this research is targeted towards the effect of ethanol production on domestic food markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=American Coalition for Ethanol |url=http://www.ethanol.org/pdf/contentmgmt/USDA_DOE_biofuels_letter_61208.pdf |title=Responses to Questions from Senator Bingaman |publisher=American Coalition for Ethanol |date=2008-06-02 |accessdate=2012-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004113944/http://ethanol.org/pdf/contentmgmt/USDA_DOE_biofuels_letter_61208.pdf |archivedate=4 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] has conducted various ethanol research projects, mainly in the area of [[cellulosic ethanol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=National Renewable Energy Laboratory |url=http://www.nrel.gov/biomass/pdfs/40742.pdf |title=Research Advantages: Cellulosic Ethanol |publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory |date=2007-03-02 |accessdate=2012-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125101249/http://www.nrel.gov/biomass/pdfs/40742.pdf |archivedate=25 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cellulosic ethanol]] has many benefits over traditional corn based-ethanol.

The production of algae to harvest oil for biofuels has not yet been undertaken on a commercial scale, but feasibility studies have been conducted to arrive at the above yield estimate. During the biofuel production process algae actually consumes the carbon dioxide in the air
and turns it into oxygen through photosynthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/green-science/algae-biodiesel1.htm|title=How Algae Biodiesel Works|date=18 June 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to its projected high yield, algaculture— unlike food crop-based biofuels — does not entail a decrease in food production, since it requires neither farmland nor fresh water.

===Thorium===
{{main article|Thorium fuel cycle}}
There are potentially two sources of nuclear power. [[Nuclear power|Fission]] is used in all current nuclear power plants. [[Fusion power|Fusion]] is the reaction that exists in stars, including the sun, and remains impractical for use on Earth, as fusion reactors are not yet available. However nuclear power is controversial politically and scientifically due to concerns about [[High-level radioactive waste management|radioactive waste disposal]], safety, the risks of a severe accident, and technical and economical problems in dismantling of old power plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Armaroli | first1 = Nicola | authorlink = Nicola Armaroli | authorlink2 = Vincenzo Balzani | last2 = Balzani | first2 = Vincenzo | year = 2011 | title = ''Towards an electricity-powered world''.

===Solar===
{{Main article|Solar power|Artificial photosynthesis}}
The primary obstacle that is preventing the large scale implementation of solar powered energy generation is the inefficiency of current solar technology. Currently, photovoltaic (PV) panels only have the ability to convert around 24% of the sunlight that hits them into electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrel.gov/pv/assets/images/efficiency-chart.png|title=NREL Photovoltaic Efficiency Chart|accessdate=2017-04-19|publisher=NREL}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this rate, solar energy still holds many challenges for widespread implementation, but steady progress has been made in reducing manufacturing cost and increasing photovoltaic efficiency.
Both [[Sandia National Laboratories]] and the [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] (NREL), have heavily funded solar research programs. The NREL solar program has a budget of around $75 million &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_12151611|title= Stimulus leaves NREL in cold|accessdate=2012-04-16|publisher=Denver Post|first=Gargi|last=Chakrabarty|date=16 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and develops research projects in the areas of [[photovoltaic]] (PV) technology, solar thermal energy, and solar radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrel.gov/solar/|title=Solar Research|accessdate=2012-04-16|publisher=NREL}}&lt;/ref&gt; The budget for Sandia’s solar division is unknown, however it accounts for a significant percentage of the laboratory’s $2.4 billion budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energy.sandia.gov/?page_id=2727 |title=Photovoltaics|accessdate=2012-04-16|publisher=Sandia}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Several academic programs have focused on solar research in recent years. The Solar Energy Research Center (SERC) at [[University of North Carolina]] (UNC) has the sole purpose of developing cost effective solar technology. In 2008, researchers at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) developed a method to store solar energy by using it to produce hydrogen fuel from water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2008/oxygen-0731.html |title='Major discovery' from MIT primed to unleash solar revolution |accessdate=2012-04-17|publisher=MIT News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such research is targeted at addressing the obstacle that solar development faces of storing energy for use during nighttime hours when the sun is not shining.
In February 2012, North Carolina-based Semprius Inc., a solar development company backed by German corporation [[Siemens]], announced that they had developed the world’s most efficient solar panel. The company claims that the prototype converts 33.9% of the sunlight that hits it to electricity, more than double the previous high-end conversion rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smartplanet.com/blog/intelligent-energy/breakthrough-worlds-most-efficient-solar-panel/12800 |title=Breakthrough: World’s most efficient solar panel|accessdate=2012-04-17|publisher=SmartPlanet}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major projects on [[artificial photosynthesis]] or solar fuels are also under way in many developed nations.&lt;ref&gt;Artificial photosynthesis as a frontier technology for energy sustainability.

A '''wind farm''' is a group of [[wind turbine]]s in the same location used to produce electric power. A large wind farm may consist of several hundred individual wind turbines, and cover an extended area of hundreds of square miles, but the land between the turbines may be used for agricultural or other purposes. A wind farm may also be located offshore.

Many of the largest operational onshore wind farms are located in the USA and China. The [[Gansu Wind Farm]] in China has over 5,000 MW installed with a goal of 20,000 MW by 2020. China has several other "wind power bases" of similar size. The [[Alta Wind Energy Center]] in California is the largest onshore wind farm outside of China, with a capacity of 1020 [[Megawatt|MW]] of power.&lt;ref name=terragen&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.terra-genpower.com/News/Terra-Gen-Power-Announces-Closing-of-$650-Million-.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150902091230/http://www.terra-genpower.com/News/Terra-Gen-Power-Announces-Closing-of-%24650-Million-.aspx |archivedate=2 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Europe leads in the use of wind power with almost 66 GW, about 66 percent of the total globally, with Denmark in the lead according to the countries installed per-capita capacity.&lt;ref&gt;Smil, Vaclav. "Electricity from Wind." Energy Myths and Realities: Bringing Science to the Energy Policy Debate. Washington, D.C.: AEI, 2010. 115-30. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; As of February 2012, the [[Walney Wind Farm]] in United Kingdom is the largest offshore wind farm in the world at 367 MW, followed by [[Thanet Wind Farm]] (300 MW), also in the UK.

There are many large wind farms under construction and these include [[BARD Offshore 1]] (400 MW), [[Clyde Wind Farm]] (350 MW), [[Greater Gabbard wind farm]] (500 MW), [[Lincs Wind Farm]] (270 MW), [[London Array]] (1000 MW), [[Lower Snake River Wind Project]] (343 MW), [[Macarthur Wind Farm]] (420 MW), [[Shepherds Flat Wind Farm]] (845 MW), and [[Sheringham Shoal Offshore Wind Farm|Sheringham Shoal]] (317 MW).

Wind power has expanded quickly, its share of worldwide electricity usage at the end of 2014 was 3.1%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/REN12-GSR2015_Onlinebook_low1.pdf pg31]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geothermal===

{{Main article|Geothermal electricity}}
[[Geothermal energy]] is produced by tapping into the thermal energy created and stored within the earth. It arises from the radioactive decay of an isotope of potassium and other elements found in the Earth's crust.&lt;ref name="László 1981 248–249"&gt;{{cite journal|last=László|first=Erika|title=Geothermal Energy: An Old Ally|journal=Ambio|year=1981|volume=10|issue=5|pages=248–249|jstor=4312703}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geothermal energy can be obtained by drilling into the ground, very similar to oil exploration, and then it is carried by a heat-transfer fluid (e.g. water, brine or steam).&lt;ref name="László 1981 248–249"/&gt; Geothermal systems that are mainly dominated by water have the potential to provide greater benefits to the system and will generate more power.&lt;ref name="Dorfman 1976 370–375"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dorfman|first=Myron H.|title=Water Required to Develop Geothermal Energy|journal=Journal (American Water Works Association)|date=July 1976|volume=68|issue=7|pages=370–375|jstor=41268497}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within these liquid-dominated systems, there are possible concerns of subsidence and contamination of ground-water resources. Therefore, protection of ground-water resources is necessary in these systems. This means that careful reservoir production and engineering is necessary in liquid-dominated geothermal reservoir systems.&lt;ref name="Dorfman 1976 370–375"/&gt; Geothermal energy is considered sustainable because that thermal energy is constantly replenished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Geothermal Sustainability| journal = GHC Bulletin | year = 2007| pages = 2–6 | author = L. Ryback}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the science of geothermal energy generation is still young and developing economic viability. Several entities, such as the [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=NREL |url=http://www.nrel.gov/geothermal/ |title=Geothermal Technologies|publisher=NREL | accessdate=2012-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sandia National Laboratories]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sandia|url=http://energy.sandia.gov/index.php?page_id=381|title=Geothermal |publisher=Sandia | accessdate=2012-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; are conducting research toward the goal of establishing a proven science around geothermal energy. The International Centre for Geothermal Research (IGC), a German geosciences research organization, is largely focused on geothermal energy development research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Deutsches GeoForschungsZentrum (GFZ) Helmholtz Center Potsdam |url=http://www.gfz-potsdam.de/portal/gfz/Struktur/GeoEngineering-Zentren/Internationales+Geothermiezentrum;jsessionid=8F6BF49D51E1BAA8273B58EAEEA40F41|title= International Centre for Geothermal Research |publisher=GFZ Helmholtz Center Potsdam | accessdate=2012-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydrogen===
{{Main article|Hydrogen fuel}}
Over $1 billion of federal money has been spent on the research and development of hydrogen and a medium for energy storage in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Jeff Wise |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/energy/next-generation/4199381 |title=The Truth about hydrogen what is hydrogen |publisher=Popular Mechanics | accessdate=2012-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= NREL |url=http://www.nrel.gov/hydrogen/ |title=Hydrogen |publisher=NREL| accessdate=2012-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sandia National Laboratories]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Sandia |url= http://www.sandia.gov/hydrogen|title=Hydrogen |publisher=Sandia| accessdate=2012-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; have departments dedicated to hydrogen research. Hydrogen is useful for energy storage, and for use in airplanes and ships, but is not practical for automobile use, as it is not very efficient, compared to using a battery — for the same cost a person can travel three times as far using a battery [[electric vehicle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Puma |first=Steve |url=http://www.triplepundit.com/2010/02/hydrogen-is-not-the-fuel-of-the-future/ |title=Hydrogen is Not The Miracle Fuel of the Future |publisher=Triplepundit.com |date=2010-02-08 |accessdate=2013-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clean energy investments==
[[File:Bp world energy consumption 2016.gif|thumb|Comparing trends in worldwide energy use, the growth of clean energy to 2015 is shown by the green line&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bp.com/statisticalreview Statistical Review of World Energy], Workbook (xlsx), London, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;]]
2010 was a record year for green energy [[investment]]s. According to a report from [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg New Energy Finance]], nearly US $243 billion was invested in wind farms, solar power, electric cars, and other alternative technologies worldwide, representing a 30 percent increase from 2009 and nearly five times the money invested in 2004. China had $51.1 billion investment in clean energy projects in 2010, by far the largest figure for any country.&lt;ref name=Chalons-Browne&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.environmentalleader.com/2011/03/30/epicenter-of-renewable-energy-investments-shifts-to-developing-economies/ |title=Epicenter of Renewable Energy Investments Shifts to Developing Economies |author=Roland W. Chalons-Browne |date=30 March 2011 |work=Environmental Leader }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within [[emerging economies]], [[Brazil]] comes second to [[China]] in terms of clean energy investments. Supported by strong energy policies, Brazil has one of the world’s highest biomass and small-hydro power capacities and is poised for significant growth in wind energy investment. The cumulative investment potential in Brazil from 2010 to 2020 is projected as $67 billion.&lt;ref name=Chalons-Browne/&gt;

India is another rising clean energy leader. While India ranked the 10th in private clean energy investments among G-20 members in 2009, over the next 10 years it is expected to rise to the third position, with annual clean energy investment under current policies forecast to grow by 369 percent between 2010 and 2020.&lt;ref name=Chalons-Browne/&gt;

It is clear that the center of growth has started to shift to the developing economies and they may lead the world in the new wave of clean energy investments.&lt;ref name=Chalons-Browne/&gt;

Around the world many sub-national governments - regions, states and provinces - have aggressively pursued sustainable energy investments. In the United States, California's leadership in renewable energy was recognised by The Climate Group when it awarded former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger its inaugural award for international climate leadership in Copenhagen in 2009.&lt;ref name="theclimategroup.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theclimategroup.org|title=The Climate Group|website=The Climate Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, the state of South Australia - under the leadership of former Premier Mike Rann - has led the way with wind power comprising 26% of its electricity generation by the end of 2011, edging out coal fired generation for the first time.&lt;ref name="theclimategroup.org"/&gt; South Australia also has had the highest take-up per capita of household [[solar panel]]s in Australia following the Rann Government's introduction of solar feed-in laws and educative campaign involving the installation of solar photovoltaic installations on the roofs of prominent public buildings, including the parliament, museum, airport and Adelaide Showgrounds pavilion and schools.&lt;ref&gt;Centre for National Policy, Washington DC, 2 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Rann, Australia's first climate change minister, passed legislation in 2006 setting targets for renewable energy and emissions cuts, the first legislation in Australia to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Conservation Council of SA, 2 March 2006. "Rann's climate laws a first for Australia"&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, in the European Union there is a clear trend of promoting policies encouraging investments and financing for sustainable energy in terms of energy efficiency, innovation in energy exploitation and development of renewable resources, with increased consideration of environmental aspects and sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farah|first1=Paolo Davide|title=Sustainable Energy Investments and National Security: Arbitration and Negotiation Issues|journal=Journal of World Energy Law and Business|date=2015|volume=8|issue=6|ssrn=2695579|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018, the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) released its annual "State Energy Efficiency Scorecard." The scorecard concluded that states and electric utility companies are continuing to expand energy efficiency measures in order to meet clean energy goals. In 2017, the U.S. spent $6.6 billion in electricity efficiency programs. $1.3 billion was spent on natural gas efficiency. These programs resulted in 27.3 million megawatt hours (MWh) of electricity saved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dailyenergyinsider.com/featured/15292-states-utilities-see-investments-in-energy-efficiency-programs-grow/|title=States, utilities see investments in energy efficiency programs grow - Daily Energy Insider|date=2018-10-10|work=Daily Energy Insider|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Teak]] wood is used for making boats, [[furniture]], and other things which require resistance to the elements. Teak is used for outdoor furniture  but is not recommended for full exposure to sunlight. Being more expensive than most other woods, '''teak furniture''' has become something of a [[status symbol]]. Not only is it common for a teak bench, chair, or table to last 70 years with the correct care plan, it is also common to pass down such furniture to future generations as an heirloom.

==Types of teak furniture==
Teak is originally from the teak tree with the Latin name ''[[Tectona grandis]]''. The teak tree is common in Southeast Asia. Teak is a hardwood that is particularly resistant to different types of climate, making it suitable for shipbuilding and for furniture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Corne van|first1=Berkel|title=Informatie - De Teakhoeve|url=http://www.teakhoeve.nl/Informatie/Informatie/1364/Wat-is-teak.html|accessdate=3 November 2016|work=www.teakhoeve.nl|date=4 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Teak furniture can remain outdoors in any climate year round, and can be left unfinished or protected. Plantation teak wood can be considered eco-friendly due to its long life expectancies. To ensure the reduction of impact teak furniture has to the environment, many forestry companies produce sustainably managed plantation teak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=International Business Pubns USA|title=Brunei Business Intelligence Report: Strategic Information and Opportunities|date=1 May 2000|publisher=Int'l Business Publications|isbn=9780739725245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tables and dining sets===
In places and seasons where eating outdoors is common and pleasant, it is common to find wooden dining tables and chairs in gardens, backyards, [[Deck (building)|deck]] areas, [[patio]]s, pool yards and [[sun room]]s. Teak is an excellent material for this application, because it will not be broken down in the sun like plastics, it is less prone to the elements like other woods, it is lighter and cooler than iron, and will not easily bend or break like tubular metals.

===Benches===
[[Bench (furniture)|Bench]]es are perhaps the most common use of teak other than [[ocean|marine]] applications. Teak benches are ideal for commercial use due to their strong nature and natural resistance to decay and termites, and are available in an endless variety of designs.

===Chaise loungers===
Teak is popular for chaise loungers and other recumbent seating because it is more durable and better crafted than most plastic loungers and will not get hot in the sun like metal loungers. Since these chairs are heavy, they often have 2 or more wheels for easy transport from place to place.

===Adirondacks armchairs===
[[Adirondack chair]]s (also known as Muskoka chairs) are comfortable with their high backs, their contoured seats and their wide arm-rests. The arm-rests provide ample room for food and beverages for comfortable meals while reclining with no table required, making them popular with outdoor [[café]]s and [[bistro]]s as they offer seating and a small place for food without the need for a table.

===Umbrellas===
Teak is a popular and traditional wood for the frames of large [[umbrella]]s such as shade umbrellas and market umbrellas. While teak provides the durability, weather resistance and lightness needed for such an application, metals like aluminum are more popular and generally a cheaper choice.

===Deep seating===
Complemented with weather resistant and outdoor [[cushion]]s and similar to living room furniture, deep seating [[Garden furniture|patio furniture]] is becoming more and more popular in places with warmer climates. With landscaping and outdoor décor being such a popular trend, furniture to sit in and enjoy the space has followed suit. The teak wood construction allows patio furniture sets to last years longer than other wood furniture.

==Teak oil==
"Teak oil" is the name used by manufactures of various oil-based wood treatments intended for use on teak and other hardwoods. Teak oil most often contains [[linseed]] oil, but does not contain oil from the [[teak]] tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Should You Treat Teak Patio Furniture With Teak Oil?|url=http://teakpatiofurnitureworld.com/should-you-treat-teak-patio-furniture-with-teak-oil/|accessdate=13 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''whiting event''' is a phenomenon that occurs when a calcium carbonate precipitate cloud forms in [[Body of water|water bodies]] during the [[summer]] every year. It is caused as a result of change in the [[water]] [[temperature]] or by increased [[Photosynthetic reactions|photosynthetic]] activity by certain microscopic marine life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.4319/lo.1997.42.1.0133 |title=Whiting events: Biogenic origin due to the photosynthetic activity of cyanobacterial picoplankton |date=1997 |last1=Thompson |first1=Joel B. |last2=Schultze-Lam |first2=Susanne |last3=Beveridge |first3=Terrance J. |last4=Des Marais |first4=David J. |journal=Limnology and Oceanography |volume=42 |pages=133–41 |pmid=11541205 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1127/1864-1318/2003/0109-0171 |id={{INIST|15194875}} |title=Spatial distribution and temporal dynamics of picocyanobacteria in a meromictic karstic lake |date=2003 |last1=Camacho |first1=Antonio |last2=Picazo |first2=Antonio |last3=Miracle |first3=Maria R. |last4=Vicente |first4=Eduardo |journal=Algological Studies |volume=109 |pages=171–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=1768|title=Whiting in Lake Michigan|publisher=NASA Earth Observatory}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=81952|title=Whiting Event, Lake Ontario|publisher=NASA Earth Observatory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:She-wolf suckles Romulus and Remus.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The [[Capitoline Wolf]] with Romulus and Remus]]

The [[wolf]] is  a common motif in the foundational mythologies and cosmologies of peoples throughout [[Eurasia]] and [[North America]] (corresponding to the historical extent of the habitat of the gray wolf). The obvious attribute of the wolf is its nature of a [[predator]], and correspondingly it is strongly associated with danger and destruction, making it the symbol of the [[warrior]] on one hand, and that of the [[devil]] on the other. The modern  trope of the [[Big Bad Wolf]] is a development of this. The wolf holds great importance in the cultures and religions of the nomadic peoples, both of the [[Eurasian steppe]] and [[North American Plains]].  
In many cultures, the identification of the warrior with the wolf ([[totemism]]) gave rise to the notion of [[lycanthropy]], the mythical or ritual identification of man and wolf.

Wolves were sometimes associated with [[witchcraft]] in both northern European and some Native American cultures: in Norse folklore, the [[völva]] (witch) Hyndla and the giantess [[Hyrrokin]] are both portrayed as using wolves as mounts, while in [[Navajo people|Navajo]] culture, wolves were feared as [[Witch (Navajo)|witches]] in wolf's clothing.&lt;ref name="l123"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lopez|1978|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[Tsilhqot'in]] believed that contact with wolves could cause mental illness and death.&lt;ref name="m292" /&gt;

==Akkadian==
One of the earliest written references to black wolves occurs in the [[Babylon]]ian epic ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh|Gilgamesh]]'', in which the titular character rejects the sexual advances of the goddess [[Ishtar]], reminding her that she had transformed a previous lover,

==Indo-European==
[[File:Romolo e remo.jpg|thumb|''[[Romulus and Remus]] nursed by the [[She-wolf (Roman mythology)|She-wolf]]'' (c. 1616), [[Peter Paul Rubens]]]]

In  [[Proto-Indo-European mythology]], the wolf was presumably associated with the warrior class, who would "transform into wolves" (or dogs) upon their initiation. This is reflected in Iron Age Europe in the ''[[Tierkrieger]]'' depictions from the Germanic sphere, among others.  The standard comparative overview of this aspect of Indo-European mythology is  McCone (1987)&lt;ref&gt;Kim R. McCone, "Hund, Wolf, und Krieger bei den Indogermanen" in W. Meid (ed.), Studien zum indogermanischen Wortschatz, Innsbruck, 1987, 101-154&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baltic===

According to legend, the establishment of the [[Lithuania]]n capital [[Vilnius]] began when the grand duke [[Gediminas]] dreamt of an iron wolf howling near the [[Gediminas Tower|hill]]. Lithuanian goddess [[Medeina]] was described as a single, unwilling to get married, though voluptuous and beautiful huntress. She was depicted as a she-wolf with an escort of wolves.

 [[File:The binding of Fenris by D Hardy.jpg|upright|thumb|right|Fenrir, bound by the gods]]

[[Norse mythology]] prominently includes three malevolent wolves, in particular: the giant [[Fenrisulfr]] or Fenrir, eldest child of [[Loki]] and [[Angrboda]] who was feared and hated by the [[Æsir]], and Fenrisulfr's children, [[Sköll]] and [[Hati Hróðvitnisson|Hati]]. Fenrir is bound by the gods, but is ultimately destined to grow too large for his bonds and devour [[Odin]] during the course of [[Ragnarök]]. At that time, he will have grown so large that his upper jaw touches the sky while his lower touches the earth when he gapes. He will be slain by Odin's son, [[Viðarr]], who will either stab him in the heart or rip his jaws asunder, according to different accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Pliny_the_Elder/8*.html#81| title=Historia Naturalis| author=Pliny the Elder| chapter=viii| page=81}} 22/34&lt;/ref&gt; Fenrir's two offspring will, according to legend, devour the sun and moon at Ragnarök. On the other hand, however, the wolves [[Geri and Freki]] were the Norse god [[Odin]]'s faithful pets who were reputed to be "of good omen."&lt;ref name="Myths of the Norsemen"&gt;{{cite book|last=Guerber|first=Hélène Adeline|title=Myths of the Norsemen: from the eddas and the sagas|origyear=1909|edition=Dover|year=1992|publisher=Dover Publications|location=Mineola, N.Y.|isbn=0-486-27348-2|pages=17, 347|chapter=Odin's Personal Appearance, Greek and Northern Mythologies|quote=At his feet crouched two wolves or hunting hounds, Geri and Freki, animals therefore sacred to him, and of good omen if met by the way.

In the [[Hervarar saga]], king [[Heidrek]] is asked by [[Gestumblindi]] ([[Odin]]), "What is that lamp which lights up men, but flame engulfs it, and [[wargs]] grasp after it always." Heidrek knows the answer is the [[Sun]], explaining: "She lights up every land and shines over all men, and Skoll and Hatti are called wargs. Those are wolves, one going before the sun, the other after the moon."

But wolves also served as mounts for more or less dangerous humanoid creatures. For instance, ''[[Gunnr]]'s horse'' was a [[kenning]] for "wolf" on the [[Rök Runestone]], in the [[Lay of Hyndla]], the [[völva]] (witch) Hyndla rides a wolf, and to [[Baldr]]'s funeral, the giantess [[Hyrrokin]] arrived on a wolf.

[[Wolf]] or  [[Wulf]] is used as a surname, given name, and a name among Germanic-speaking peoples. "Wolf" is also a component in other Germanic names:
*[[Wolfgang]] ([[wikt:wolf#Old High German|wolf]] + [[wikt:gang#Old High German|gang]] ("path, journey"))
*[[Adolf]], derived from the [[Old High German]] ''Athalwolf'', a composition of ''athal'', or ''adal'', meaning ''noble'', and  ''[[wolf]]''; its  [[Anglo-Saxon]] [[cognate]] is [[Æthelwulf]]. 
*[[Rudolph (name)|Rudolf]]'', deriving from two stems: ''Rod'' or ''Hrōð'', meaning "fame", and ''olf'' meaning "wolf" (''see also [[Hroðulf]]'').

The [[Ancient Greeks]] associated wolves with the sun god [[Apollo]].&lt;ref name="m292" /&gt;

[[Mount Lykaion]] ({{lang|grc|Λύκαιον ὄρος}}) is a mountain in [[Arcadia]]  where an altar of [[Zeus]] was located.  ''Zeus Lykaios'' was said to have been born and brought up on it, and was the home of [[Pelasgus]] and his son [[Lycaon (mythology)|Lycaon]], who is said to have founded the ritual of Zeus practiced on its summit. This seems to have involved a [[human sacrifice]], and a feast in which the man who received the portion of a human victim was changed to a wolf, as Lycaon had been after sacrificing a child. The sanctuary of Zeus played host to athletic games held every four years, the ''[[Lykaia]]''.

===Iranic===
According to the [[Avesta]], the [[sacred text]] of the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]]s, wolves are a creation from the 'darkness' of the evil spirit [[Ahriman]], and are ranked among the most cruel of animals.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Yasna]]'', ix. 18–21&lt;/ref&gt; and belong to the ''[[daevas]]''. The ''[[Bundahishn]]'', which is a [[Middle Persian]] text on the Zoroastrian creation myth, has a chapter dedicated to the 'nature of wolves' as seen in Zoroastrian mythology and belief.

=== Roman ===
In [[Roman mythology]] wolves are mainly associated to [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], god of war and agriculture. The [[Capitoline Wolf]] nurses [[Romulus and Remus]], sons of Mars and future founders of [[Rome]]. The twin babies were ordered to be killed by their great uncle [[Amulius]]. The servant ordered to kill them, however, relented and placed the two on the banks of the [[Tiber river]]. The river, which was in flood, rose and gently carried the cradle and the twins downstream, where under the protection of the river deity [[Tiberinus (god)|Tiberinus]], they would be adopted by a she-wolf known as ''Lupa'' in [[Latin]], an animal sacred to [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]. As a consequence, the [[Italian wolf]] is the [[list of national animals|national animal]] of the modern [[Italy|Italian Republic]].

In Antiquity, the she-wolf was identified as a symbol of Rome by both the Romans themselves and nations under the Roman rule. The ''Lupa Romana ''was an iconic scene that represented in the first place the idea of ''romanitas'', being Roman. When it was used in the [[Roman Province]]s, it can be seen as an expression of loyalty to Rome and the emperor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.academia.edu/9280920/The_Lupa_Romana_in_the_Roman_Provinces|title= The Lupa Romana in the Roman Provinces|work= Acta Archaeologica Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae|publisher= Akadémiai Kiadó|accessdate= 2016-04-01|author= Mika Rissanen }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The treatment given to wolves diﬀered from the treatment meted out to other large predators. The Romans generally seem to have refrained from intentionally harming wolves. For instance, they were not hunted for pleasure (but only in order to protect herds that were out at pasture), and not displayed in the [[venatio]]nes, either. The special status of the wolf was not based on national ideology, but rather was connected to the religious importance of the wolf to the Romans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.academia.edu/23717733/Was_There_a_Taboo_on_Killing_Wolves_in_Rome|title= Was There a Taboo on Killing Wolves in Rome?|work= Quaderni Urbinati di Cultura Classica|publisher= Fabrizio Serra Editore|accessdate= 2016-03-28|author= Mika Rissanen }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The comedian [[Plautus]] used the image of wolves to ponder the cruelty of [[homo homini lupus|man as a wolf unto man]].

"[[Lupus (name)|Lupus]]" (Wolf) was used as a Latin first name and as a [[List of Roman cognomina#L|Roman cognomen]].

An old she-wolf with a sky-blue mane named Asena found the baby and nursed him, then the she-wolf gave birth to half-wolf, half-human cubs, from whom the Turkic people were born. Also in Turkic mythology it is believed that a gray wolf showed the Turks the way out of their legendary homeland ''[[Ergenekon (legendary place)|Ergenekon]]'', which allowed them to spread and conquer their neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.byegm.gov.tr/yayinlarimiz/kitaplar/turkiye2003/content/english/434-435.htm Cultural Life – Literature] Turkey Interactive CD-ROM.

While bear has been the sacred animal of Finns, wolves have always been hunted and killed mercilessly. The wolf has been represented as implacable and malicious predator, killing more than it manages to eat. {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Wolves were generally revered by [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal Canadian]]s that survived by hunting, but were thought little of by those that survived through agriculture. Some [[Alaska Natives]] including the [[Nunamiut]] of both northern and northwestern [[Alaska]] respected the wolf's hunting skill and tried to emulate the wolf in order to hunt successfully.

===United States===
In the [[cardinal direction]]s of [[Plains Indians|Midwestern Native Americans]], the wolf represented the [[Western United States|west]], but it represented the [[Southeastern United States|southeast]] for the [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]] tribe. According to the Pawnee creation myth, the wolf was the first creature to experience death.&lt;ref name="l133"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lopez|1978|p=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wolf Star, enraged at not having been invited to attend a council on how the Earth should be made, sent a wolf to steal the whirlwind bag of The Storm that Comes out of the West, which contained the first humans. Upon being freed from the bag, the humans killed the wolf, thus bringing death into the world. Native Americans have long seen the wolf as an animal of power. Many tribes credit the actual creator of the earth to be a wolf. The Arikara and Ojibwe believed a wolfman spirit made the Great Plains for them and for other animals. Many tribes consider wolves to be closely related to humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.native-languages.org/legends-wolf.htm|website=Native American Wolf Mythology|accessdate=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this belief is because of the wolf’s dedication to its pack,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wollert|first1=Edward|title=Wolves in Native American Religion|url=http://www.wolfsongalaska.org/chorus/node/179|website=Wolf Song Alaska|accessdate=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a trait the tribes attributed with themselves. The Navajo tribe was known for performing healing ceremonies where they would call upon wolves to restore health to their ill. Wolves were admired for their superb hunting skills. Prayers were offered in honor of wolves before they went out of hunting excursions. The Pawnee’s connection with wolves was so great that their hand signal for Pawnee was actually the same one that they had for wolf. Before battles, Apache warriors would pray, sing, and dance to gain the teamwork, strength, and bravery of wolves.
The Pawnee, being both an agricultural and hunting people, associated the wolf with both corn and the bison; the "birth" and "death" of the Wolf Star ([[Sirius]]) was to them a reflection of the wolf's coming and going down the path of the [[Milky Way]] known as Wolf Road. The [[Navajo people|Navajo]] tribe feared taboo-breaking witches (nearly always male) in wolves' clothing called ''yee naaldlooshii'', literally "with it, he goes on all fours". Wolf in Navajo is ''mąʼiitsoh''- literally "large coyote".&lt;ref name="SAM" /&gt;

The [[Bible]] contains 13 references to wolves, usually as metaphors for greed and destructiveness. In the [[New Testament]], [[Jesus]] is quoted to have used wolves as illustrations to the dangers His followers would have faced should they follow him (Matthew 10:16, Acts 20:29, Matthew 7:15)&lt;ref name="BOTF"&gt;{{cite book | author= Bright, Michael | title=Beasts of the Field: The Revealing Natural History of Animals in the Bible | year=2006 | isbn=1-86105-831-4 | page= 346 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Book of Genesis]] was interpreted in Medieval Europe as stating that nature exists solely to support man (Genesis 1:29), who must cultivate it (Genesis 2:15), and that animals are made for his own purposes (Genesis 2:18-20). By this perspective, nature was only acceptable if controlled by man.{{editorializing|date=May 2017}}
The wolf is repeatedly mentioned in the scriptures as an enemy of flocks: a metaphor for evil men with a lust for power and dishonest gain, as well as a metaphor for Satan preying on innocent God-fearing Christians, contrasted with the shepherd Jesus who keeps his flock safe.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} The [[Roman Catholic Church]] often used the negative imagery of wolves to create a sense of real devils prowling the real world.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} Quoting from [[Leviticus]] and [[Deuteronomy]], the ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'' states that wolves are either agents of [[God]] sent to punish sinners, or agents of the [[Satan|Devil]] sent with God's blessing to harass true believers to test their faith.&lt;ref name="SAM" /&gt;

However, legends surrounding [[Saint Francis of Assisi]] show him befriending a wolf.&lt;ref name="SAM"/&gt; According to the ''[[Fioretti]]'', the city of [[Gubbio]] was besieged by the [[Wolf of Gubbio]], which devoured both livestock and men. [[Francis of Assisi]], who was living in Gubbio at the time took pity on the townsfolk, and went up into the hills to find the wolf. Soon fear of the animal had caused all his companions to flee, but the saint pressed on and when he found the wolf he made the sign of the cross and commanded the wolf to come to him and hurt no one. Miraculously the wolf closed his jaws and lay down at the feet of St. Francis. "Brother Wolf, you do much harm in these parts and you have done great evil ..." said Francis. "All these people accuse you and curse you… But brother wolf, I would like to make peace between you and the people." Then Francis led the wolf into the town, and surrounded by startled citizens he made a pact between them and the wolf. Because the wolf had "done evil out of hunger" the townsfolk were to feed the wolf regularly, and in return, the wolf would no longer prey upon them or their flocks. In this manner Gubbio was freed from the menace of the predator. Francis, ever the lover of animals, even made a pact on behalf of the town dogs, that they would not bother the wolf again.

In Canto I of [[Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy|Inferno]]'', the pilgrim encounters a she-wolf blocking the path to a hill bathed in light. The she-wolf represents the sins of [[concupiscence]] and [[incontinence (philosophy)|incontinence]]. She is prophecised by the shade of [[Virgil]] to one day be sent to [[Hell]] by a greyhound.

Much of the symbolism [[Jesus]] used in the [[New Testament]] revolved around the pastoral culture of Israel, and explained his relationship with his followers as analogous to that of a [[good shepherd]] protecting his flock from wolves. An innovation in the popular image of wolves started by Jesus includes the concept of the [[The Wolf in Sheep's Clothing|wolf in sheep's clothing]], which warns people against [[false prophet]]s.&lt;ref name="marvin43"&gt;{{Harvnb|Marvin|2012|pp=43–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several authors have proposed that Jesus's portrayal of wolves, comparing them to dangerous and treacherous people, was an important development in perceptions on the species, which legitimized centuries of subsequent wolf persecution in the [[western world]].&lt;ref name="marvin43" /&gt;&lt;ref name="l208"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lopez|1978|p=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="m293"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=293}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent medieval [[Christian literature]] followed and expanded upon Biblical teachings on the wolf. It appeared in the seventh century edition of the ''[[Physiologus]]'', which infused pagan tales with the spirit of Christian moral and mystical teaching. The ''Physiologus'' portrays wolves as being able to strike men dumb on sight, and of having only one [[cervical vertebra]]. [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] included a she-wolf, representing greed and [[fraud]], in the first [[canto]] of the ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]''. The ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'', first published in 1487, states that wolves are either agents of [[God]] sent to punish the wicked, or agents of [[Satan]], sent with God's blessing to test the faith of believers.&lt;ref name="l219"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lopez|1978|pp=205, 219 &amp; 240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
Wolves are mentioned three times in the [[Qur'an]], specifically in the [[Yusuf (sura)|Sura Yusuf]].

12.13: "He said: Surely it grieves me that you should take him off, and I fear lest the wolf devour him while you are heedless of him."

12.14: "They said: Surely if the wolf should devour him notwithstanding that we are a (strong) company, we should then certainly be losers."

12.17: "They said: O our father! Surely we went off racing and left Yusuf by our goods, so the wolf devoured him, and you will not believe us though we are truthful."

== Modern folklore, literature and pop culture ==
{{further|Wolves in fiction}}
The popular image of the wolf is significantly influenced by the [[Big Bad Wolf]] stereotype from [[Aesop's Fables]] and [[Grimm's Fairy Tales]].
The Christian symbolism where the wolf represents the devil, or evil, being after the "sheep" who are the [[ecclesia militans|living faithful]], is found frequently in western literature. 
In Milton's ''[[Lycidas]]'' the theological metaphor is made explicit: 
:"The hungry Sheep look up, and are not fed / But swoln with wind, and the rank mist they draw / Rot inwardly and foul contagian spread: Besides what the grim Woolf with privy paw / Daily devours apace"

The wolf in the Scandinavian tradition as either representing the [[warrior]] or as a symbol of [[Odin]], sometimes combined with the Christian symbolism as the wolf representing evil or the  devil, came to be a popular attribute in the  [[heavy metal music]] subculture, used by bands such as [[Sonata Arctica]], [[Marduk (band)|Marduk]], [[Watain]], [[Wintersun]], and [[Wolf (band)|Wolf]].
