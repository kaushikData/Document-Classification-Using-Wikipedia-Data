[[File:262212888 805b4a1711 o.jpg|thumb|250px|A Catalan-language sign in Valencia city calling for a boycott of Catalan products]]
'''Anti-Catalanism'''  ({{lang-ca|anticatalanisme}}, {{IPA-ca|ˌantikətələˈnizmə|IPA}}) is the collective name given to various alleged historical trends in [[Spain]] that have been hostile to [[:Category:Catalan culture|Catalan culture]] and [[Catalan traditions|traditions]].

In more recent times it is a term used to criticize political stances contrary to [[Catalan nationalism]] or [[Catalan independentism]], both inside and outside Catalonia.

==Description==
In a historical context, anti-Catalanism expresses itself as a hostile attitude towards the [[Catalan language]], [[Catalan people|people]], [[Catalan traditions|traditions]] or anything identified with Catalonia. In a political context it may express itself as the reaction to a perceived intrusion of Catalan political nationalism into the area. In its most extreme circumstances, this may also be referred as '''Catalanophobia'''. Several political movements, known for organising [[boycott]]s of products from Catalonia, are also actively identified with anti-Catalanism. It is a controversial term in Spain since Catalan political parties which support political independence are often accused of conflating criticism of their stances and actions with an attack on all Catalans. 

Anti-Catalanism in its most virulent form is mostly associated with [[far-right]] Spanish political parties. Fringe groups such as [[España 2000]] (none of which obtained more than 0.5% of the votes in the last general elections) object strongly to the autonomy enjoyed by Catalonia, claiming that the granting of autonomy to Catalonia and other regions will lead to the breakup of Spain{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source.|date=November 2017}}.

Criticism of Catalan nationalism, is to be found throughout the Spanish political spectrum{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source.|date=November 2017}}. However, such criticism does not usually imply hostility towards Catalonia itself, nor does it necessarily imply being against [[autonomous communities of Spain|regional autonomy in Spain]], or even the use of regional languages in the public domain. In fact, ''[[Ciutadans]]'' – which is possibly the most vocal of the Spanish political parties against the perceived excesses of regional nationalisms such as the Catalan – was created in Catalonia and has its national headquarters in [[Barcelona]]; this Catalan party – currently the largest party in the [[Parliament of Catalonia|Catalan regional parliament]] – is equally referred to by Catalan nationalists as "anti-Catalan",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naciodigital.cat/noticia/77161/terricabras/ciutadans/upyd/actuen/europa/militarment/anticatalans|title=NacióDigital: Terricabras: «Ciutadans i UpyD actuen a Europa militarment com anticatalans»|first=|last=NacióDigital|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; illustrating a certain tendency among pro-independence Catalan parties to interpret attacks on their political stance as xenophobic, populist or selfish attacks on all Catalans, nationalist or not.

In this regard, [[black list]]s of so-called "bad Catalans" (Catalan public figures who oppose Catalan separatism) have been published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elperiodico.com/es/noticias/ocio-y-cultura/lista-negra-malos-catalanes-5001061|title=Una lista negra de malos catalanes|first=Ernest|last=Alós|date=2 April 2016|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should be added that Ciutadans has had links in the past to extremist groups.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rtve.es/noticias/20090423/ciutadans-se-divide-tras-aprobar-acudir-europeas-coalicion-derechista-libertas/268846.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; And more recently tried to pass a motion through parliament against the alleged indoctrination in Catalan, Balearic and Valencian schools.&lt;ref&gt;https://politica.elpais.com/politica/2017/10/17/actualidad/1508254151_637017.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Additionally such a distinction between "good Catalans" and "bad Catalans" is found in both sides of the issue, most recently by [[People's Party (Spain)|PP]] Catalan Leader Xavier Albiol who talked about mobilizing the majority of "good Catalans" when referring to those against independence.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.europapress.es/catalunya/noticia-albiol-dice-no-habra-independencia-llama-catalanes-bien-movilizarse-masivamente-20171004135404.html&lt;/ref&gt; The prevalence of it is up for debate.

Adding to the confusion, Catalan nationalists have often labelled as 'anti-Catalan' previous policies of the Spanish or French state which, per se, were not directed specifically to the Catalan culture, but were a part of a general [[centralisation|centralist]] vision of politics.

Besides politics, anti-Catalanism is often also based on widespread perceived prejudices among regions of Spain. The stereotype of Catalans common throughout Spain involve a sense of them being industrious and excelling in entrepreneurship on the one side but also excessively individualistic, unfriendly, disloyal, snobbish or mean on the other side{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source.|date=November 2017}}. This perception plays with alleged political realities, Catalonia often being accused of lack of solidarity with the poorer regions of Spain, marginalisation of the Spanish language and culture (e.g., ban on bullfighting, absence of Spanish-language public education), and historical discrimination or xenophobia against economic migrants from Andalusia, Extremadura or other Spanish regions. The degree to which these accusations are justified is debatable, particularly since the children and grandchildren of immigrants have successfully integrated into a multicultural Catalan society. It should also be added that these are usually based on politically motivated misinterpretations, Spanish-language education is possible under request&lt;ref&gt;https://elpais.com/ccaa/2016/09/01/catalunya/1472726417_392529.html&lt;/ref&gt; and is in practice the language most used in education as shown by speaker rates.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.idescat.cat/pub/?id=ed&amp;n=2568&lt;/ref&gt; This also applies to the prohibition of Spanish language signs: though the law states that the main language of street signs should be Catalan, it does not forbid the use of Spanish along with it.&lt;ref&gt;http://consum.gencat.cat/qui_som/communicacio/codi-consum-catalunya/empreses-codi/index_es.html#2.1&lt;/ref&gt;

However, arguments forwarded include that whereas the 20 most common surnames names in Catalonia proper are typical of the Spanish language,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/vida/20150219/54427403857/grafico-los-apellidos-mas-frecuentes-en-catalunya.html|title=Los apellidos más frecuentes en Catalunya|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the majority of political seats and posts are held by people with typically Catalan language surnames, and some of those who do not have them 'Catalanise' them upon embarking on a political career. In particular it has been noted that a pool of Catalan language surnames held by 13% of the total Catalan population holds 40% of the politically designated jobs, which has been called an 'overrepresentation' or even 'hyperrepresentation' in the political elite of these Catalan families vs. the Catalan society as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vozpopuli.com/actualidad/53736-la-endogamia-de-las-elites-nacionalistas-400-apellidos-copan-el-40-de-la-politica-catalana|title=La endogamia de las élites nacionalistas: 400 apellidos copan el 40% de la política catalana|first=|last=Vozpopuli|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-Catalanism has a local and distinctive manifestation in the [[Valencian Community]] called [[Blaverism]], a movement rejecting [[Joan Fuster]]'s concept of ''[[Països Catalans]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Xavier Coller]] [www.cairn.info/revue-pole-sud-2006-2-page-107.htm ''Collective identities and failed nationalism''], in ''Pôle Sud'' 2/2006 (n° 25), p. 107-136.&lt;/ref&gt; Blaverism is best reflected in debates concerning the status of [[Valencian]] versus Catalan, even though this phenomenon has diminished greatly over the last 25 years.
Also in [[Aragon]] there is an anti-Catalan movement that seeks to downplay the Catalan identity of [[La Franja]], thus the Aragonese regional parliament passed a law to avoid referring to the Catalan language as the language spoken in some parts of Aragon, forcing a neologism in its place,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtve.es/noticias/20130509/aragon-excluye-catalan-lenguas-oficiales-ahora-se-llama-lapao/660440.shtml|title=Aragón excluye al catalán de sus lenguas oficiales, ahora se llama Lapao - RTVE.es|date=9 May 2013|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2013/05/09/actualidad/1368082767_046979.html|title=Las Cortes de Aragón aprueban llamar ‘lapao’ al catalán y ‘lapapyp’ al aragonés|first=Ediciones El|last=País|date=9 May 2013|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though this was later abrogated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20160131/301787470825/gobierno-aragones-liquida-lapao.html|title=El Gobierno aragonés liquida el Lapao|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nepali architecture''' or '''Nepalese architecture''' is a unique strain of art and practicality.It is famous all over the world. Situated in between the trade routes of India and Tibet and China, Nepali architecture reflects influences from both these cultural strongholds. The [[pagoda]] architectural tradition figures prominently among [[Hindu temple]]s in the country. The pagoda architectural tradition as well, along with the [[Tibetan Buddhist architecture|Tibetan tradition]] of [[Buddhist architecture]] and the [[stupa]] in contrast is widely used among [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] temples throughout the country.Mugal style ,summit style,dome style also have great scope in Nepal.

'''''Babysan''''' was a comic created by American artist [[Bill Hume (cartoonist)|Bill Hume]] while he was stationed in Japan in the 1950s.  The comic depicts American sailors interacting with a pin-up style Japanese woman named Babysan.  The title comes from the word "baby" an affectionate term Americans use and "san" which is an honorary term used by the Japanese.  It translates literally to Miss Baby.  The comic became incredibly popular with United States service members in Japan by mixing good humor with culture, language, and sex.  Babysan attempted to show some of the give and take between American and Japanese cultures during the occupational era.  Anything but political, the comic plays on misunderstanding and sexuality.  "I didn't invent Babysan, I just reported life as it was."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clark |first1=Bill |title='Art talent' has taken Hume on a fascinating journey |url=http://archive.columbiatribune.com/2006/mar/20060317Life002.asp |website=columbiatribune.com |accessdate=16 July 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304052718/http://archive.columbiatribune.com/2006/mar/20060317Life002.asp |archivedate=4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Bill Hume was a member of the U.S Navy during World War II (1942–1945).  He left the Navy in 1945 and married.  In 1951, he was recalled to be part of the occupying force in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=|title=Bill Hume, 1916-2009|url=http://www.columbiatribune.com/obituaries/bill-hume/article_f5713060-22bf-517c-93f3-81a16aa8c84c.html|website=Columbiatribune.com|accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hume served as a petty officer in charge of maintaining good order and discipline and was also the editor of the station newspaper, ''The Oppaman''.  Through his observations of life in Japan, the effects American sailors were having on the culture, and the effects the Japanese culture was having on the sailors Hume created Babysan, originally a pinup poster, to help boost morale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hume|first1=Bill|title=Babysan: A Private Look at the Japanese Occupation|date=1953|publisher=Charles E. Tuttle Co.|location=Rutland, Vt|OCLC=9529575|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Babysan became a hit with the sailors of Fleet Airforce Service Squadron 120 and this popularity spread to the [[Navy Times]] and finally to the United States when servicemen began returning home.  Hume returned to the United States in 1952, teamed up with John Annarino, and four books based on Babysan were published shortly after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harvey|first= Robert C.|title=Insider Histories of Cartooning: Rediscovering Forgotten Famous Comics and Their Creators|publisher=University of Mississippi|date=2014|ISBN=9781628461435|pages=151–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
Babysan gave a view of post-war Japan from the eyes of an American servicemember.  Their love of American movies, American dance, and western clothing comes in stark contrast to the society of the recent past.  Bill Hume rarely, if ever, depicts Japanese men in his comics and these cultural changes may or may not have impacted them at the time but when the Japanese women began adopting them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shibusawa|first1=Naoko|title=America's Geisha Ally: Reimagining the Japanese Enemy|date=2010|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674057470}}&lt;/ref&gt; the American servicemen felt more relaxed and accepting.  Although naive and innocent the character of Babysan was able to teach Americans a little bit about customary practices such as taking off shoes before entering a house, the [[hibatchi]], the [[kimono]], food, and money.  It also included common Japanese words and a rudimentary explanation of writing even though some arrogant American sailors already seemed to know it all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hume|first1=Bill|title=Babysan A Private Look at the Japanese Occupation|date=1953|publisher=Charles E. Tuttle Co|location=Rutland, VT|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to entertaining the troops, Babysan also provided a glimpse of what to expect and how they might be perceived in their new home.

This semi-pornographic comic often featured Babysan partially nude and flirting.  In one comic, she reminded creator Bill Hume that "Japanese girls like to wear clothes, too."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hume|first1=Bill|title=Babysan's World: The Hume'n Slant on Japan|date=1954|publisher=Charles E. Tuttle Co.|location=Rutland, VT|OCLC=46486948|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Servicemen may have imagined ''Cio-Cio San'' in Puccini's [[Madame Butterfly]] as the typical Japanese girl but what they got was instead was Babysan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shibusawa|first1=Naoko|title=America's Geisha Ally: Reimagining the Japanese Enemy|date=2010|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674057470|pages=34–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Japanese woman was self-motivated with her own problems and desires. Tight fitting clothing, blunt talk, and comfort with nudity made Babysan irresistible to servicemen of every rank and when they got jealous they accused her of "butterflying".  This term meant being unfaithful but Babysan never accepted this description, she would disagree in her broken English and say that she had not butterflied, she had changed her mind.         
Babysan also desired money.  She goes from one serviceman to another flirting asking questions like "Why you all time bring candy- why never bring okane(money)?"(33) or "Why never have liberty on payday?". (83) This was not prostitution however.  It was payment for services to be sure but "Babysan never forgot the acts of kindness on the part of the American.  She decided...to devote herself to the part of the American...There wasn't much sense in restricting her charms to one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hume|first1=Bill|title=Babysan A Private Look at the Japanese Occupation|date=1953|publisher=Charles E. Tuttle Co|location=Rutland, VT|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; She entertained them with her beauty, her femininity, her charm, and her energy.  And unlike Cio-Cio San, Babysan was not upset when Americans left for home, as she was waving goodbye to them she was already looking towards the future and another serviceman.

==Impact==
Babysan made light of the tumultuous situation in Japan during the 1940s and 50s.   Although not intended to be a textbook on Japanese custom and tradition Hume's works certainly contained elements of both.  These were combined with some of charming things in Japan including the most charming thing to the United States servicemen according to Hume, the Japanese girl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hume|first1=Bill|title=Babysan's World: The Hume'n Slant on Japan|date=1954|publisher=Charles E. Tuttle Co.|location=Rutland, VT|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Babysan disarmed the sailors and soldiers with her beauty and ability to adopt new things and through her they were able to enjoy the food, the language, and the culture during their short tours in Japan. It is not a widely known work but among many in the field, it is highly respected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harvey|first= Robert C.|title=Insider Histories of Cartooning: Rediscovering Forgotten Famous Comics and Their Creators|publisher=University of Mississippi|date=2014|ISBN=9781628461435|pages=151–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bi-metallic coins''' are [[coin]]s consisting of two (''[[bi-]]'') [[metal]]s or [[alloy]]s, generally arranged with an outer ring around a contrasting center.  Common circulating examples include the [[Indian 10-rupee coin|₹10]], [[1 euro coins|€1]], [[2 euro coins|€2]], [[Polish zloty|2 and 5 PLN]], [[Czech koruna|50 CZK]], [[Hungarian forint|100 and 200 HUF]], [[Bulgarian Lev|1 and 2 BGN]], [[United Kingdom|British]] [[One pound (British coin)|£1]] and [[Two pounds (British coin)|£2]], [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Two Dollar Coin (Canada)|$2]], [[South Africa]]n [[South African rand|R5]], [[Turkey|Turkish]] [[Turkish lira|1 lira]], [[Rupiah|IDR 1K]], [[Hong Kong]] [[Hong Kong ten-dollar coin|$10]], [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[Argentine peso|$1]], [[Brazilian real#Second series (1998–present)|Brazilian R$1]] [[Philippine]] [[Philippine ten peso coin|₱10]], and all [[Mexico|Mexican]] coins of [[Mexican peso|$1]] or higher denomination.
[[File:20franctrimetalrev.jpg|thumbnail|1992 French 20-francs tri-metallic coin, composed of three components: the outer ring, the second ring and the center plug.]]
[[File:Kingtutcoinobv without background.png|thumbnail|2008 "[[King Tutankhamun]]" bi-metallic 1 [[Egyptian pound]] coin.]]

Bi-metallic coins have been issued for a long time, with known examples dating from the 17th century, while the Roman Empire issued special-occasion, large medallions with a center of bronze or copper and an outer ring of [[orichalcum]], starting with the reign of [[Hadrian]].  The [[silver-center cent]] [[pattern coin|pattern]] produced by the [[United States]] in 1792 is another example. In the 1830s and 1840s, British medalist Joseph Moore produced large numbers of bi-metallic "penny model" and less common "halfpenny model" tokens, as a proposal to replace the relatively large [[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|penny]] and [[Halfpenny (British pre-decimal coin)|halfpenny]] coins. Though not [[legal tender]], Moore's tokens were circulated widely and accepted at face value by many merchants. Despite their popularity, the [[Royal Mint]] rejected the proposal, and did not reduce the size of the penny and halfpenny until [[Decimal Day|decimalization]].

In recent times, the first circulating bi-metallic coin was the [[Italy|Italian]] 500 [[Italian lira|lire]], first issued in 1982. [[Morocco]], with its 5-[[Moroccan dirham|dirham]]s coin in 1987; [[France]], with a 10-[[French franc|franc]]s coin in 1992; [[Monaco]], with a 10 [[Monegasque franc|franc]]s; [[Thailand]], with a 10 [[Thai baht|baht]], in 1988; and [[Hong Kong]], with a $10 coin, in 1993, [[Hungary]], with a 100-[[Hungarian forint|forint]] coin in 1996, and [[Brazil]] with the 1 [[Brazilian real|real]] coin issued bi-metallic coins for circulation all based on the minting process of the Italian 500 lire coin. [[India]] introduced 10-[[Indian rupee|rupee]] bi-metallic coins in 2009 that are dated 2006 (minted at [[Noida]]). Since 1996, [[Canada]] has also produced bi-metallic [[Canadian dollar|$2 coins]] (nicknamed "[[Toonie|toonies]]"). [[Great Britain]] has issued a bi-metallic 2-[[British pound|pound]] coin since 1997; and [[Singapore]] has issued a bi-metallic 1-[[Singapore dollar|dollar]] coin since 2013.

The first ever tri-metallic circulating coins were 20-francs coins introduced in France and Monaco in 1992. These were similar to the corresponding bi-metallic 10-francs coins, but had two rings instead of one. 

As well as circulating coins, where they are generally restricted to high-denomination coins, bi-metallic coins are often used in [[Commemorative coin|commemorative issues]], often made of [[precious metals]]. For example, the only bi-metallic coin of the [[United States]] is the [[2000 Library of Congress bimetallic ten dollar coin|$10 Library of Congress commemorative]], made of a [[gold]] ring around a [[platinum]] center. They are used primarily as a way of securing against [[coin counterfeiting]].

The manufacturing process is similar to that of ordinary coins, except that two blanks (the inner and the outer) are struck at the same time, deforming the separate blanks sufficiently to hold them together.

'''Big Kahuna Burger''' is a fictional chain of [[Hawaii]]an-themed [[fast food]] restaurants that has appeared in films by [[Quentin Tarantino]] and [[Robert Rodriguez]], including ''[[Death Proof]]'', ''[[Four Rooms]]'', ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]'', ''[[From Dusk till Dawn|From Dusk Till Dawn]]'' and ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Intertextuality and Intersemiosis |quote=13–15 February 2003|page=135|author=Marina Grishakova, Markku Lehtimäki|year=2004|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K9tkAAAAMAAJ|isbn=978-9985-56-911-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The packaging was created by Tarantino's old friend Jerry Martinez.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Product Placement Takes a Little Twist|publisher=Greensboro News and Record|date=Jul 12, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The restaurant features most prominently in Tarantino's [[Pulp Fiction|''Pulp Fiction'',]] in which [[Samuel L.

There are three schools for the deaf in [[Burma]], the [[Mary Chapman School for the Deaf]] in [[Yangon]] (est. 1904), the [[School for the Deaf, Mandalay]] (est. 1964), and the [[Immanuel School for the Deaf]] in [[Kalay]] (est. 2005). However, oral Burmese is the language of instruction, at least in Yangon, with sign used to support it. The sign language used in Yangon and Mandalay is different, but it's not clear if they are one language or two.&lt;ref&gt;Nobutaka Kamei, 2004. "Sign language in Myanmar: On e language or two?"

When annotating [[chess]] games, commentators frequently use widely recognized annotation symbols. [[Question mark]]s and [[exclamation point]]s that denote a move as bad or good are ubiquitous in chess literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shatranj.us/files/AnalysisSymbols.pdf |title=Chess Analysis Symbols |publisher=C&amp;O Family Chess Center |website=chesscenter.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some publications intended for an international audience, such as the ''[[Chess Informant]]'', have a wide range of additional symbols that transcend language barriers.

The common symbols for evaluating the merits of a move are "??", "?", "?!", "!?", "!", and "!!". In these cases, the corresponding symbol is juxtaposed in the text immediately after the move (e.g. Re7? or Kh1!?, see [[algebraic chess notation]]).

Use of these annotation symbols is subjective, as different annotators use the same symbols differently. Moreover, an annotator's use of symbols is often influenced by the player's strength: a positional misjudgment that an annotator might give a "??" if played by a strong [[Grandmaster (chess)|grandmaster]] might pass unremarked if played by a beginner.

Annotators' use of punctuation also may possibly be influenced by the result of the game regardless of the actual quality of the move; this tendency is sometimes referred to as "annotation by result".

== Evaluation symbols ==

=== Moves {{anchor|Move}} ===
Move evaluation symbols, by increasing effectiveness of the move:

==== ?? (Blunder) {{anchor|??|Blunder}} ====
{{Main|Blunder (chess)}}
The double question mark "??" indicates a [[blunder (chess)|blunder]], a very bad mistake. Typical moves which receive double question marks are those that overlook a [[Tactics (chess)|tactic]] that wins substantial material or overlook a [[checkmate]]. A "??"-worthy move usually results in an immediately lost position. Occasionally, the sign is used for a move which transforms a won position into a draw, perhaps because the annotator feels that the mistake is unworthy of the player's skill level. They occur at all levels of play to all human competitors.

==== ? (Mistake) {{anchor|?|Mistake}} ====
A single question mark "?" after a move indicates that the annotator thinks that the move is a poor one that should not be played. These often lead to loss of tempo or material. The nature of the mistake may be more strategic than tactical; in some cases, the move receiving a question mark may be one for which it is difficult to find a refutation. A move that overlooks a forthcoming brilliant [[Combination (chess)|combination]] from the opponent would rarely receive more than one question mark, for example.

Whether a single or double question mark is used is subjective and may depend on the player's strength. For instance, if a beginner makes a serious strategic error (for instance, accepting gratuitous pawn weaknesses or [[Exchange (chess)|exchanging]] into a lost [[Chess endgame|endgame]]) or overlooks a tactical sequence, this might be explained by the beginner's lack of skill, and be given only one question mark. If a master were to make the same move, some annotators might use the double question mark to indicate that one would never expect a player of the master's strength to make such a weak move.

==== ?! (Dubious move) {{anchor|?!|Dubious move|Dubious}} ====
This symbol is similar to the "!?" (below) but usually indicates that the annotator believes the move to be objectively bad, albeit hard to refute. The "?!" may also indicate that the annotator believes the move is deserving of criticism but not bad enough to warrant a "?". A sacrifice leading to a dangerous attack which the opponent should be able to defend against if he plays well may receive a "?!". Alternatively, this may denote a move that is objectively bad, but sets up an attractive trap.

==== !? (Interesting move) {{anchor|!?|Interesting move|Interesting}} ====
The "!?" is one of the more controversial symbols. Different books have slightly varying definitions. Among the definitions are "interesting, but perhaps not the best move", "move deserving attention", "enterprising move" and "risky move". Usually it indicates that the move leads to exciting or wild play but that the objective evaluation of the move is unclear. It is also often used when a player sets a cunning trap in a lost position. Typical moves receiving a "!?" are those involving speculative sacrifices or dangerous attacks which might turn out to be strategically deficient.

[[Andrew Soltis]] jokingly called "!?" the symbol of the lazy annotator who finds a move interesting but cannot be bothered to work out whether it is good or bad.&lt;ref&gt;''Chess to Enjoy-Eternal Questions'', published in ''Chess Life'', March 2000, pp. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ! (Good move) {{anchor|!|Good move|Good}} ====
While question marks indicate bad moves, exclamation points ("!") indicate good moves—especially ones which are surprising or involve particular skill. Hence annotators are usually somewhat conservative with the use of this symbol.

Once the players start making good choices when faced with difficult decisions, however, a few moves may receive exclamation points from annotators. Typical moves receiving exclamation points are strong {{chessgloss|theoretical novelty|opening novelties}}, well-timed breakthroughs, sound [[Sacrifice (chess)|sacrifices]], and moves that avoid falling into [[Swindle (chess)|traps]].

==== ‼ (Brilliant move) {{anchor|‼|!!|Brilliant move|Brilliant}} ====
The double exclamation point ("‼") is used for very strong moves such as sound sacrifices of large amounts of material and counter-intuitive moves that prove very powerful. For example, in what is known as the [[The Game of the Century (chess)|Game of the Century]], 13-year-old [[Bobby Fischer]]'s decision to sacrifice his queen for a strategic attack was awarded by annotators a double exclamation point. &lt;ref name="move 17, Game of the Century"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Game_of_the_Century_(chess)#cite_note-12 |website=wikipedia |accessdate=7 September 2018|title=The Game of the Century (chess) |date=2018-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Others ====
A few writers have used three or more exclamation points ("!!!") for an exceptionally brilliant move. For example, in [http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1119679 Rotlewi-Rubinstein 1907], [[Hans Kmoch]] awarded Rubinstein's 22...Rxc3 three exclamation points. Likewise, an exceptionally bad blunder may be awarded three or more question marks ("???"). The general consensus among chess writers is that these symbols are unnecessary.

A few writers have used unusual combinations of question marks and exclamation points (e.g. "!!?", "?!?", "??!") for particularly unusual or controversial moves, but these have no generally accepted meaning, and are typically used for humorous or entertainment purposes.

Occasionally an annotation symbol may be put in parentheses, e.g. "(?)", "(!)". Different writers have used these in different ways; for example [[Simon Webb (chess player)|Simon Webb]] used "(?)" to indicate a move which is objectively sound, but was in his opinion a poor psychological choice, while [[Robert Hübner]] (see below) used it to indicate a move which is inaccurate and makes the player's task more difficult.

=== Alternative uses ===
There are some systems which use these symbols in different ways.

==== Nunn's convention ====
In his 1992 book ''Secrets of Rook Endings'' and other books in the series  (''Secrets of Minor-Piece Endings'' and ''Secrets of Pawnless Endings''), [[John Nunn]] uses these symbols in a more specific way in the context of [[Chess endgame|endgames]] where the optimal line of play can be determined with certainty:

* ! {{pad|0.5em}}The only move which maintains the current evaluation of the position: if the position is theoretically [[draw (chess)|drawn]], this is the only move which does not lose; if the position is theoretically won, this is the only move which secures the win. An "!" is used no matter how trivial the move in question; the only exception is if it is the only legal move.
* !! {{pad|0.5em}}A particularly difficult-to-find "!" move.
* ? {{pad|0.5em}}A move which negatively affects the evaluation of the position: if the position had been drawn before the move, it is now lost; if won before the move, it is now drawn or lost.
* ?? {{pad|0.5em}}An obviously bad "?" move.
* !? {{pad|0.5em}}A move which makes the opponent's task harder or one's own task easier; for example, in a theoretically lost position, a move which forces the opponent to find several "!" moves in order to win.
* ?! {{pad|0.5em}}A move which makes the opponent's task easier or one's own task harder; for example, in a theoretically won position, a move which requires several subsequent "!" moves in order to win {{Harvcol|Nunn|1999}}.

This convention has been used in some later works, such as ''Fundamental Chess Endings'' and ''Secrets of Pawn Endings'' by [[Karsten Müller]] and [[Frank Lamprecht]], but it can be safely assumed the convention is not being used unless there is a specific note otherwise. The Nunn convention cannot be used to annotate full games because the exact evaluation of a position is generally impractical to compute.

In 1959, Euwe and Hooper made the same use of the question mark,  "... a decisive error...".&lt;ref&gt;Euwe &amp; Hooper, p. viii&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hübner's approach ====
[[Germany|German]] [[Grandmaster (chess)|grandmaster]] [[Robert Hübner]] prefers an even more specific and restrained use of move evaluation symbols:
"I have attached question marks to the moves which change a winning position into a drawn game, or a drawn position into a losing one, according to my judgment; a move which changes a winning game into a losing one deserves two question marks ... I have distributed question marks in brackets to moves which are obviously inaccurate and significantly increase the difficulty of the player's task ... There are no exclamation marks, as they serve no useful purpose. The best move should be mentioned in the analysis in any case; an exclamation mark can only serve to indicate the personal excitement of the commentator."&lt;ref&gt;''Twenty-five Annotated Games'', published by Edition Marco, Verlag Arno Nickel, Berlin, 1996, pp. 7-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Chess composition ====
When the solution to a certain [[chess problem]] is given, there are also some conventions that have become a common practice:
* {{chessprobgloss|key|Key}} move is marked with at least one "!"
* {{chessprobgloss|try|Try}} move is marked with "?"
* Refutation to a try move is marked with "!"
* When {{chessprobgloss|dual|dual avoidance}} is a part of the thematic content of a problem, avoided duals (if listed) are marked with "?"

=== Positions {{anchor|Position|Pos eval|Pos}} === 
These symbols indicate the strategic balance of the game position:

==== = (Equal) {{anchor|&amp;#61;|Equal|Equality}} ====
Even position: White and Black have more or less equal chances.

==== +/= or ⩲ (Slight plus for White) {{anchor|+/&amp;#61;|Slight plus for White}} ====
Slight advantage: White has slightly better chances.

==== =/+ or ⩱ (Slight plus for Black) {{anchor|&amp;#61;/+|Slight plus for Black}} ====
Slight advantage: Black has slightly better chances.

==== +/− or ± (Clear plus for White) {{anchor|+/−|±|Clear plus for White}} ====  
Clear advantage: White has much better chances. It is also written as ±; the other similar symbols can be written in this style as well.

==== −/+ or ∓ (Clear plus for Black) {{anchor|−/+|∓|Clear plus for Black}} ==== 
Clear advantage: Black has much better chances. It is also written as ∓; the other similar symbols can be written in this style as well.

==== + − (Decisive advantage for White) {{anchor|+−|Decisive advantage for White}} ====  
Decisive advantage: White has a winning advantage.

==== − + (Decisive advantage for Black) {{anchor|−+|Decisive advantage for Black}} ====  
Decisive advantage: Black has a winning advantage.

==== ∞ (Unclear) {{anchor|∞|Unclear}} ====  
Unclear position: It is unclear who (if anyone) has an advantage. Often used when a position is highly asymmetrical, e.g. Black has a ruined pawn structure but dangerous active piece-play.

==== =/∞ (Compensation) {{anchor|&amp;#61;/∞|Compensation}} ====  
With compensation: Whoever is down in {{chessgloss|material}} has compensation for it. Can also denote a position that is unclear, but appears to the annotator to be approximately equal.

== Other symbols {{anchor|Others}} ==
There are other symbols used by various chess engines and publications, such as ''[[Chess Informant]]'' and ''[[Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings]]'', when annotating moves or describing positions. 

=== Move-related ===
* &lt;big&gt;⌓&lt;/big&gt; {{pad|0.5em}}Better: Indicates a better move than the one played.
* &lt;big&gt;□&lt;/big&gt; {{pad|0.5em}}Only: The only reasonable move, or the only move available.
* Δ {{pad|0.5em}}Idea: Indicates the future plan this move supports.
* ∇ {{pad|0.5em}}Countering: Indicates the opponent's plan this move defends against.
* TN or N {{pad|0.5em}}Novelty: A move that is a {{chessgloss|theoretical novelty}}.

=== Positions or conditions ===
* ↑ {{pad|0.5em}}Initiative: Indicates an advantage in [[initiative (chess)|initiative]].   
* → {{pad|0.5em}}Attack: With an {{chessgloss|attack}}.
* &lt;big&gt;⇄&lt;/big&gt; {{pad|0.5em}}Counterplay: Indicates that the player has {{chessgloss|counterplay}}.
* &lt;big&gt;↻&lt;/big&gt; or ↑↑{{pad|0.5em}}Development: Indicates a lead in {{chessgloss|development}}.
* &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;○&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; {{pad|0.5em}}Space: Indicates more {{chessgloss|space}} owned by one player.
* &lt;big&gt;⊕&lt;/big&gt; {{pad|0.5em}}[[Time trouble]], a.k.a. Zeitnot: Indicates the player had little time remaining on their clock.
* &lt;big&gt;⊙&lt;/big&gt; {{pad|0.5em}}[[Zugzwang]]

[[File:Arsen 5104 f14 detail2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Poulaines worn in Burgundy ca. 1470]]

'''Crakows''' or '''crackowes''' were a style of shoes with extremely long toes very popular [[1400–1500 in fashion|in the 15th century]]. They were so named because the style was thought to have originated in [[Kraków]], then the capital of [[Poland]]. They are also sometimes known as poulaines or pikes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pratt|first1=Lucy|last2=Woolley|first2=Linda|title=Shoes|date=2008|publisher=V&amp;A Publications|location=London|isbn=978-1-851-77537-8|pages=12–13|edition=Pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the term ''poulaine'', as in ''souliers a la poulaine'', "shoes in the Polish fashion", referred to the long pointed beak of the shoe, not the shoe itself.&lt;ref name="Carlson"&gt;Carlson, I. Marc. 2001, [http://www.personal.utulsa.edu/~marc-carlson/shoe/APP5.HTM "Medieval European Long Toed Shoes"], "Footwear of The Middle Ages", 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Long toed shoes had been popular in Europe at different times, first appearing in the archaeological record in the 12th century and falling in and out of fashion periodically before reaching their most exaggerated form in the third quarter of the 15th century and falling out of fashion in the 1480s.&lt;ref name="stt"&gt;Goubitz, Olaf; van Driel-Murray, Carol; Groenman-Van Waateringe, Willy. 2001 "Stepping through time : archaeological footwear from prehistoric times until 1800": Zwolle [Netherlands] : Stichting Promotie Archeologie&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="s+p"&gt;Grew, F. and de Neergaard, M. 1988. ''Shoes and Pattens. Medieval Finds from Excavations in London'': 2. London: HMSO, pp. 88–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The arrival of this fashion in England is traditionally associated with the marriage of [[Richard II]] and [[Anne of Bohemia]] in 1382. An anonymous 'monk of Evesham' recorded in 1394: "With this queen there came from Bohemia into England those accursed vices (English ''Cracowys'' or ''Pykys'') half a yard in length, thus it was necessary for them to be tied to the shin with chains of silver before they could walk with them."

However, there are indications they were worn as early as the 1360s. The author of the ''Eulogium Historiarum'' describes men of this period as wearing "points on their shoes as long as your finger that are called crakowes; more suitable as claws... for demons than as ornaments for men."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chambers|first1=Mark|last2=Sylvester|first2=Louise|editor1-last=Hamling|editor1-first=Tara|editor2-last=Richardson|editor2-first=Catherine|title=Everyday Objects: Medieval and Early Modern Material Culture and its Meanings|chapter=Lexicological Confusion and Medieval Clothing Culture: Redressing Medieval Dress with the Lexis of Cloth and Clothing in Britain Project|date=2010|publisher=Ashgate Pub.|location=Farnham, Surrey, England|isbn=0754666379|pages=71–84|edition=Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

14th century poulaine-toed shoes found in London were found only in men's sizes,&lt;ref name="s+p" /&gt; but 15th century art shows them being worn by both men and women, with the toes of men's shoes being the most extravagantly long. They were a controversial fashion and faced criticism from several quarters. In 1368, [[Charles V of France]] issued an edict banning their construction and use in Paris. An English poem from 1388 complained that men were unable to kneel in prayer because their toes were too long.&lt;ref name="scott"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scott|first1=Margaret|title=Medieval Clothing and Costumes: Displaying Wealth and Class in Medieval Times|date=2004|publisher=Rosen Central|location=New York|isbn=082393991X|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1463, [[Edward IV]] passed a [[sumptuary law]] restricting anyone "under the state of a Lord, Esquire, [or] Gentleman" from wearing poulaines over the length of two inches. In 1465, they were banned in England altogether, so that all cordwainers and cobblers within the City of London were prohibited from making shoes with pikes more than two inches long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grew|first1=Francis|last2=de Neergaard|first2=Margrethe|title=Shoes and Pattens|date=2002|publisher=Boydell Press|location=Rochester, NY|isbn=0851158382|page=117|edition=New}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The poulaine inspired later footwear fashions, such as the 1950s [[Winklepicker]] boots.

==Features==
===Stuffing===
Poulaine toes were packed with stuffing to provide rigidity and help them hold their shape. Surviving examples from medieval London have the points stuffed with [[moss]].&lt;ref name="stt" /&gt; An Italian chronicler noted in 1388 that they were also sometimes stuffed with horsehair.&lt;ref name="scott"/&gt;

===Tying up the toes===
Although there is no archaeological or medieval iconographic evidence to support the idea that the toes were ever tied up to the leg,&lt;ref name="Carlson" /&gt; as noted earlier, there is direct literary evidence dating from 1394 which states that this was the practice at the time these shoes were introduced into England.  Additionally, the practice is mentioned by the antiquarian [[John Stow]] in his 1698 publication ''A Survey of London'', where he wrote:
{{cquote | "In Distar Lane, on the north side thereof, is the [[shoemaking|Cordwainer's]] Hall, which company were made a brotherhood or fraternity in the eleventh of Henry IV. Of these cordwainers, I read, that since the fifth of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] (when he took to wife [[Anne of Bohemia|Anne]], daughter to [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Wenceslaus]] [sic], King of [[Bohemia]]), by her example the English people had used piked shoes, tied to their knees with silken laces, or chains of silver or gilt, wherefore in the fourth of Edward IV it was ordained and proclaimed that beaks of [[shoe|shoon]] and boots should not pass the length of two inches, upon pain of cursing by the clergy, and by Parliament to pay twenty shillings for every pair. And every cordwainer that shod any man or woman on the Sunday, to pay thirty shillings".&lt;ref&gt;John Stow, 'Bredstreete warde', in A Survey of London. Reprinted From the Text of 1603, ed. C L Kingsford (Oxford, 1908), pp. 344-352 http://www.british-history.ac.uk/no-series/survey-of-london-stow/1603/pp344-352 [accessed 22 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, given that John Stow was writing over 100 years after the shoes fell out of fashion, and the lack of rigorous historical research in the writings of the time, he cannot be considered a reliable source. His record of Act 4 of Edward IV is exaggerated - the actual act does mention restrictions in length, but not monetary penalties, parliament or clergy:
{{cquote | Nulle persone Cordewaner ou Cobeler .. face.. ascuns soler galoges ou husend oveqe ascun pike ou poleine qe passera la longuer ou mesure de deux poutz.&lt;ref name="Carlson" /&gt;}}

[[File:2008-08 archeon schnabelschuh.JPG|thumb|Poulaine at the shoemaker of [[Archeon, Netherlands|Archeon]]]]

===Poulaines as overshoes===
Overshoes made from leather or cork, called [[pattens]], were frequently worn with late medieval shoes both indoors and outdoors. The shape of pattens reflected the style of shoes in different periods, and pattens during the period where poulaine toes were fashionable have matching long toes. These pattens would have supported the toe of the shoes if required.

===Toe length===
Archaeological evidence in the form of surviving shoe soles shows that the length of the point beyond the toes of the foot was rarely, if ever, more than 50% of the length of the foot.&lt;ref name="stt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="s+p" /&gt; This is consistent with depictions of highly fashionable European men from the third quarter of the 15th century when poulaine toes were at the height of their popularity.

[[File:Sempach Schilling.jpg|thumb|300px|Depiction of the [[Battle of Sempach]] in the [[Luzerner Schilling]], showing a large pile of shoe-tips on a hill in the upper-left of the illustration (1513)]]
As with many items of high fashion the most extreme examples were worn by the upper classes. In periods when poulaine toes were popular most shoes were somewhat pointed, even those used during warfare.  There is clear evidence from the [[Battle of Sempach]] that in certain periods soldiers on campaign wore shoes with toes so long as to interfere with the wearer's ability to run.  In that battle, it became necessary for the knights of [[Leopold III, Duke of Austria]] to dismount and fight on foot, and because they did not have time to prepare for the engagement, they were forced to cut off the tips of their poulaines. The Swiss chroniclers report how a huge pile of these shoe-tips was found in a heap after the battle, and they are also depicted in the background of the battle scene in the [[Lucerne Chronicle]] of 1513.

[[File:HJRK A 62 - Armoured shoes of Maximilian I, 1485.jpg|thumb|left|Sabatons of [[Emperor Maximilian I]], c. 1485]]
A surviving pair of [[sabatons]] belonging to Emperor Maximilian have extremely long poulaines, but they were used only on horseback and in this case the long points were detachable from the sabatons for foot combat. The catches can be seen over the area of the big toe.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1365">'''Culturgen''' is a term coined in 1980 by two [[United States|American]] scientists, the [[mathematical biology|biomathematician]] Charles J. Lumsden and the 
[[Sociobiology|sociobiologist]] [[E. O. Wilson]],&lt;ref&gt;C. J. Lumsden &amp; E. O. Wilson ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA'' '''77''' 4382 (1980)&lt;/ref&gt; to denote a hypothetical 'unit' of culture, in their controversial attempt to analyse [[sociocultural evolution|cultural evolution]] by using techniques borrowed from [[population genetics]], and to infer a theory of evolution of the human mind. It effectively means much the same as the older term "cultural trait" used by anthropologists, and offers similar difficulties of identification and definition. The fullest exposition of their theory appeared in their book ''Genes, Mind, and Culture: the coevolutionary process'' (1981), which received many reviews in the scientific press, many of them highly negative; it was re-issued in 2005 with a review of subsequent developments. The term has declined in popularity, and the older term [[meme]] (coined by [[Richard Dawkins]] in his book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' (1976)) is now used in its stead almost universally (even by Wilson in his later writings).

For a discussion of the concept, see [[Meme]].

The '''''Dictionary of American Regional English''''' ('''''DARE''''') is a record of [[American English]] as spoken in the [[United States]], from its beginnings to the present. It differs from other dictionaries in that it does not document the standard language used throughout the country. Instead, it contains regional and folk speech, those words, phrases, and pronunciations that vary from one part of the country to another, or that we learn from our families and friends rather than from our teachers and books. For ''DARE'', a "region" may be as small as a city or part of a city, or as large as most (but not all) of the country.&lt;ref&gt;Ed. Frederic G. Cassidy.''Dictionary of American Regional English'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press. Volume I, 1985. p.xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; [[National Endowment for the Humanities#Humanities magazine|''Humanities'' magazine]] has described it as "a bold synthesis of [[linguistic atlas]] and [[historical dictionary]]",&lt;ref name="wordsofam" /&gt; and [[William Safire]] called it "the most exciting new linguistic project in the twentieth century".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Safire's Political Dictionary | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Safire, William | authorlink=William Safire | year=2008 | page=xxii | isbn=9780195343342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Dictionary'' is based both on face-to-face interviews with 2,777 people carried out in 1,002 communities across the country between 1965 and 1970, and on a large collection of print and (recently) electronic materials, including diaries, letters, novels, histories, biographies, government documents, and newspapers.&lt;ref name="Frederic G. Cassidy 1985"&gt;Ed. Frederic G. Cassidy. ''Dictionary of American Regional English'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press. Volume I, 1985. p.xx.&lt;/ref&gt; These sources are cited in individual entries to illustrate how the words have been used from the 17th century through the beginning of the 21st century. Entries may include pronunciations, variant forms, etymologies, and statements about regional and social distributions of words and forms.

Five volumes of text were published by Harvard University Press between 1985 and 2012: Volume I (A–C), with [[Frederic G. Cassidy]] serving as Chief Editor, appeared in 1985; Volume II (D–H), edited by Cassidy and Associate Editor Joan Houston Hall, was published in 1991; Volume III (I–O), by Cassidy and Hall, came out in 1996; Volume IV (P–Sk), by Hall, who succeeded Cassidy as Chief Editor upon his death, appeared in 2002; and Volume V (Sl–Z), with Hall as editor, finished the set in 2012. A sixth volume, subtitled "Contrastive Maps, Index to Entry Labels, Questionnaire, and Fieldwork Data," edited by Hall with Luanne von Schneidemesser serving as Senior Editor, was published early in 2013. Late that same year, the digital version was launched.

''DARE'' chronicles the language of the American people.  It is used by teachers, librarians, researchers, physicians, forensic linguists, journalists, historians, and playwrights.

==History==
In 1889, when [[Joseph Wright (linguist)|Joseph Wright]] began editing the ''[[English Dialect Dictionary]]'', a group of American philologists founded the [[American Dialect Society]] with the ultimate purpose of producing a similar work for the United States. Members of the Society began to collect material, much of which was published in the Society's journal ''Dialect Notes'', but little was done toward compiling a dictionary recording nationwide usage until [[Frederic G. Cassidy]] was appointed Chief Editor in 1962.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Ed. Frederic G. Cassidy.''Dictionary of American Regional English'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press. Volume I, 1985. p.xii.&lt;/ref&gt; Cassidy had done fieldwork in Wisconsin for the Linguistic Atlas of the North Central States project and in Jamaica for his ''Dictionary of Jamaican English''. With the assistance of Audrey Duckert, he had also designed and administered an intensive mail-questionnaire survey of Wisconsin (the ''Wisconsin English Language Survey'').&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Drawing on this experience, he and Duckert made plans for a nationwide, fieldworker-administered questionnaire that would provide a comprehensive foundation for the projected ''Dictionary''.

The fieldwork, supported by a grant from the [[Office of Education]], was conducted during 1965–70. About eighty fieldworkers (mostly graduate students, but also some professors) were trained in [[phonetic transcription]] and fieldwork techniques; they were then sent to 1,002 carefully selected communities across the country, chosen to reflect population density and to account for settlement history and immigration patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Ed. Frederic G. Cassidy.''Dictionary of American Regional English'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press. Volume I, 1985. p.xii-xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;  Each fieldworker was required to find "informants," people willing to provide information about words, who were natives of their communities and who had lived there all, or almost all, their lives. The informants were then asked to answer the questions in the ''DARE'' questionnaire. In many communities more than one person contributed answers, so the total number of informants, 2,777, is much larger than the number of communities.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Joan Houston. "The Dictionary of American Regional English." ''Language in the USA: Perspectives for the 21st Century''. Eds. Edward Finegan, John Rickford. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004. p.95.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the fieldworkers were interviewing people across the country, Cassidy and others in Madison organized an extensive volunteer reading program.  Printed materials of all kinds were selected and sent to volunteers, who read them and identified regional words in context. These resources included historical and contemporary newspapers, diaries, letters, histories, biographies, novels, and government documents. A number of important unpublished collections of dialect materials were also donated to ''DARE'' for use in documenting the ''Dictionary'' entries.&lt;ref&gt;Ed. Frederic G. Cassidy.''Dictionary of American Regional English'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press. Volume I, 1985. p.xv.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the fieldworkers sent their questionnaires back to Madison, the approximately 2.3 million answers were keypunched, and software was written to create a question-by-question tabulation of responses as well as an index.&lt;ref&gt;Ed. Frederic G. Cassidy.''Dictionary of American Regional English'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press. Volume I, 1985. p.xiv-xv.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, programs were written that allowed the interactive creation of maps showing where the responses were found and the production of statistical tables itemizing the age, sex, race, education level, and community type for each person who gave a particular response. These tools allow ''DARE'' editors to apply regional labels to entries based on where words were collected in the fieldwork project and to use social labels describing individuals who use those words.&lt;ref name="Ed. Frederic G 1985"&gt;Ed. Frederic G. Cassidy.''Dictionary of American Regional English'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press. Volume I, 1985. p.xx.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, Cassidy contracted with [[Harvard University Press]] to publish the Dictionary, and editing began in earnest in 1975. By 1980 it was clear that the idea of writing and publishing ''DARE'' as a single unit was impossible. Early estimates of the time it would take to write and revise entries had been overly optimistic. Following the tradition of other historical dictionaries such as the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', ''DARE'' decided to publish each volume as it was ready. Because Cassidy had contracted to supply the text of the ''Dictionary'' on magnetic tape fully coded for typesetting, with camera-ready maps, a production department had to be set up. A system was devised for coding the many specifications for format, type size and style, and special characters. Procedures were worked out for the meticulous checking and correcting of text that would be required.

==Features==

===Contents of volumes, maps, and labels===

Six print volumes of the ''DARE'' have been published by Harvard University’s Belknap Press. Volume I (1985) contains detailed introductory material, plus the letters A-C; Volume II (1991) covers the letters D-H; Volume III (1996) contains I-O; Volume IV (2002) includes P-Sk; and Volume V (2012) covers Sl-Z as well as a bibliography of nearly 13,000 sources cited in the five volumes. (Starting with Volume IV, digital libraries provided many valuable resources for expanding the historical coverage of the entries.) Volume VI (2013) includes more than 1,700 maps showing contrastive distributions of regional synonyms (such as ''hero, hoagie, grinder, sub, torpedo, poor boy,'' and ''Cuban'', all of which describe a sandwich in a long bun), as well as social distributions of regional terms (by age, sex, race, education, and community type). It also includes an index to the regional, usage, and etymological labels used in the five text volumes; the text of the ''DARE'' Questionnaire; the responses by all ''DARE'' informants to 430 of the questions asked in the original fieldwork. The digital version was launched in December 2013.

The five text volumes contain approximately 60,000 headwords and senses in 5,544 pages. There are nearly 3,000 computer-generated distribution maps included in the text, showing where the words were found during the fieldwork. The first volume also includes 156 pages of introductory matter, with an extensive introduction, an explanation of ''DARE''’s regions and maps, an essay on how language changes, a guide to pronunciation, text of the questionnaire, and a list of informants (showing where and when they were interviewed, the community type, the person's age, sex, race, occupation, education, and whether the person made an audiotape).

An unusual feature of ''DARE'' is its inclusion of maps showing where words were found during the nationwide fieldwork. The maps are adjusted to reflect population density rather than geographic area, so they look a bit strange at first, but one learns to "read" them quickly. Whenever possible, the editors apply regional labels to the entries, based both on the maps from the field survey and on the written citations. (There are nearly forty regional labels listed in the front matter to Volume I, but the most frequently used in the text of the Dictionary tend to be from the "South," "South Midland," "North," "New England," "Northeast," "West," "Gulf States," and "southern Appalachians.") Since language is not restricted by state or regional boundaries, the labels often include qualifying language, such as "chiefly N[ew] Eng[land]," or "scattered, but most freq[uent] S[ou]th, S[outh] Midl[and]." If the evidence from the fieldwork shows that a term is used disproportionately frequently by a particular social group (based on age, sex, race, education, or community type), a "social" label such as "old-fash[ioned]," "chiefly among women," or "esp[ecially] freq[uent] among Black speakers" will also be applied.&lt;ref name="Frederic G. Cassidy 1985"/&gt;

The digital version is available by subscription (for libraries or individuals) and perpetual access (libraries).  In addition to the Basic Search, which yields both headwords and variant forms, an Advanced Search function allows Boolean searches of full text, headwords, parts of speech, variant forms, definitions, etymologies, quotations, and regional or social labels. Quotations link directly to specific entries in the bibliography, where users can link to every other quotation from that particular source.

The digital ''DARE'' also offers features based on the original fieldwork survey:

*Users can click on a state on the ''DARE'' map, or select from any of 41 regions in a pull-down menu (e.g., Appalachians, Desert Southwest, Gulf States, North Central, South Atlantic), to get to a link to "View all entries for [that state or region]." Because language does not adhere to state or regional boundaries, the user is also guided to a list of larger regions of which the state or region is a part, with links to searches for additional words characteristic of that area.
*All entries that include quotations based on the ''DARE'' survey have links to the questions cited in the entry. Clicking a link allows the user to go to the ''DARE'' map and call up any response (or group of responses) to that question.&lt;ref&gt;Metcalf, Allan. "A Bite of ''DARE''. Chronicle of Higher Education 16 Dec., 2013. http://chronicle.com/blogs/linguafranca/2013/12/16/a-bite-of-dare/.&lt;/ref&gt; By mapping selected synonyms, the user can see regional distributions instantaneously. Users can also see the social distributions (by age, sex, race, education, and community type) of the people who offered a given response. Scholars who want to see the raw demographic data can download it as an Excel spreadsheet.
*More than 5,000 audio clips from the original ''DARE'' interviews are included in entries. Users can click on audio icons to hear bits of conversation recorded between 1965 and 1970 with people from all corners of the US.
*From the Results List of a search, users can filter the entries based on their inclusion of an audio clip, a ''DARE'' map, or a quotation from the ''DARE'' survey. Within the ''DARE'' Survey tab, searches can be refined by specific variables within the categories of age, sex, race, education, and community type.

Users who visit the digital website (http://daredictionary.com) without a subscription can browse the headwords through a "Word Wheel," designed to replicate the serendipity of flipping through the pages of a print dictionary. (Within the Word Wheel are 100 entries highlighted in gold, which can be viewed without cost.) They can do a search for headwords from a state or region and see the results list, but they cannot click on the results and go to the full entries. They can also search the bibliography.&lt;ref&gt;Agüera, Helen. "The ''Dictionary of American Regional English'': Recent Developments." http://www.neh.gov/divisions/preservation/featured-project/the-dictionary-american-regional-english-recent-developments.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to a history of the ''DARE'' project and its fieldwork, it includes introductory matter from the first print volume, an Index of virtually all the regional, social, usage, and etymological labels in the five volumes of text, a pronunciation guide and abbreviation list, the Questionnaire and List of Informants, and all the contrastive maps that are included in Volume VI of the print version of ''DARE''. There is an "Introduction to Contrastive Maps," followed by about 1,400 geographic maps showing regional synonyms for various concepts, and more than 300 maps showing differences in usage by people according to their age, sex, race, education, and community type. An index follows, with all the words that are mapped, making it easy to start with a question about a specific term and go directly to a regional or social map.

===Informants===
Some 2,777 people in 1,002 American communities served as ''DARE'' informants by answering all or part of the ''DARE'' questionnaire. Each person was a native of the selected community and had lived there all (or almost all) his or her life. The "List of Informants" in the front matter to Volume I of ''DARE'' includes the following details for each participant: informant code (a state abbreviation and a number, e.g., AL001 for the first informant interviewed in Alabama); community name; community type (urban, large city, small city, village, rural); age group (60 or older=old, 40–59=middle-aged, 18–39=young); year of birth; year of interview; education level (unknown; less than grade five; at least grade five; at least two years of high school; at least two years of college or vocational school); occupation; sex; race; and whether the informant made an audiotape recording. At the end of the "List of Informants" is a supplementary list of people who made audiotape recordings but who did not answer any parts of the questionnaire.

Fieldworkers were asked to weight their selection of informants toward older people in an effort to collect words for objects and practices that were going out of use. As a result, 66% of the ''DARE'' informants were over 60 when interviewed between 1965 and 1970; 24% were middle-aged; and 10% were young. Knowing the proportion of informants from each age group who gave a particular response and contrasting that to the proportion of informants from each age group who answered that particular question allows ''DARE'' editors to detect which words appear to be old-fashioned and which are coming into greater use.&lt;ref&gt;Ed. Frederic G. Cassidy.''Dictionary of American Regional English'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press. Volume I, 1985. p.xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Questionnaire===
The ''DARE'' questionnaire included a total of 1,847 questions; some that proved not to be fruitful in the early interviews were dropped, with others being added in their place. The questionnaire aimed to [[elicitation technique|elicit]] responses about the everyday activities in Americans' lives. It includes 41 sections, starting with the neutral subjects of time and weather and moving to more personal subjects such as religion and health. Also included are the questions used in the early questionnaire only. The text of each question is included in the front matter to Volume I, and the quotations in the text of the ''Dictionary'' usually include full or abbreviated versions of each question; in cases where only the question number is cited, a reader can refer to the front matter. The categories are listed below:&lt;ref&gt;Ed. Frederic G. Cassidy.''Dictionary of American Regional English'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press.

===Audiotape recordings===
In addition to responding to the ''DARE'' questionnaire, informants were invited to make audiotape recordings in which they both read a set passage and conversed informally about any topic of their choice. The use of the reading passage, a contrived story called "Arthur the Rat" that was designed to elicit all significant pronunciation variants in American English, allows comparison of sounds in the same context from places all across the country. The use of free conversation elicited the introduction of topics not covered in the questionnaire, resulting in a corpus of informal speech that can be contrasted to the formal style of the reading passage. It also provides an extremely valuable oral history of mid-20th-century America.

In all, 1,843 ''DARE'' informants agreed to make audiotape recordings. They are noted in the "List of Informants" in the front matter to Volume I of ''DARE'', in the last column, marked "Audiotape."

In a project with the [[Max Kade Institute]] for German-American Studies, the Center for the Study of Upper Midwestern Cultures, and the [[University of Wisconsin]] Digital Collection Center, ''DARE'' has made its collection of readings of "Arthur the Rat" available for listeners. (This collaborative project was funded by the Institute for Museum and Library Services.) These recordings have been posted at "American Languages: Our Nation's Many Voices" (http://uwdc.library.wisc.edu/collections/AmerLangs). (Use the "Guided Search" option, enter "Arthur the Rat" as a phrase in "Any Field," and enter a state name in the "Place/Time" field to hear examples from a particular state.) In addition, samples of informal conversation from the ''DARE'' audiotapes may be heard at "American Languages: Our Nation’s Many Voices Online" (http://csumc.wisc.edu/AmericanLanguages/). Additional excerpts will be added as time permits.

==New research==
In order to determine how vocabulary use has changed since the original fieldwork was done, ''DARE'' staff in 2013 undertook a pilot survey in Wisconsin ("2013–14 survey"),&lt;ref&gt;Funded by NEH grant P-W-51472, July 1, 2013 – June 30, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; preliminary to an anticipated new nationwide survey. The updated survey did not use face-to-face interviews with fieldworkers, but instead invited people to answer questions on a website developed by ''DARE'' and the University of Wisconsin Survey Center. The new questionnaire, modeled closely on the original, omitted questions for items that are obsolete, updated some terminology, and added questions for items that did not exist in the late 1960s. The survey targeted the original 22 Wisconsin communities, asking residents who had lived there all their lives to participate by answering as many of the 41 sections of the questionnaire as they chose. In addition, new communities, selected as representative of the state on the basis of the 2010 Census, were also targeted. In those communities, residents had to have lived there only fifteen years. Other Wisconsin residents were invited to participate, but their responses have been kept separate from those from "official" respondents.&lt;ref&gt;Cheung, Ariel. "''Dictionary of American Regional English'' reboots for new generation." Post-Crescent (Appleton, WI), 16 Apr., 2014. http://www.postcrescent.com/article/20140415/APC0101/304150377/Dictionary-American-Regional-English-reboots-new-generation.&lt;/ref&gt; Results of the online survey may be seen at http://dare.wisc.edu/survey-results.

==Quarterly updates==
Beginning in summer 2015, ''DARE'' staff members began publishing quarterly updates on the project website: http://dare.wisc.edu/words/quarterly-updates. These include both new and significantly revised entries. Harvard University Press will incorporate them in annual updates to the digital version.

==Funding==
''DARE'' has been supported financially by the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] (NEH), the [[National Science Foundation]], the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]], other private foundations, and many individuals. The ''DARE'' offices are located in the English Department at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], and the university has provided generous support, particularly in the form of funding for graduate assistants. (See http://dare.wisc.edu/about/funding.)

On 5 November 2017, Douglas Belkin, in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', reported that the Dictionary of American Regional English “has rung the knell, sugared off, finished out the row,” meaning it is shutting down, closing shop.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-do-fuzzywogs-toad-stranglers-and-devilstrips-have-in-common-a-dying-dictionary-1510000395&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aristotle and Phyllis.jpg|thumb|[[Aristotle]] and his lover Phyllis. Work from 1515.]]
A '''dominatrix''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|d|ɒ|m|ᵻ|'|n|eɪ|t|r|ɪ|k|s}}), plural ''dominatrixes'' or ''dominatrices'' ({{IPAc-en|-|'|n|eɪ|t|r|ɪ|s|iː|z|,_|-|n|ə|'|t|r|aɪ|-}}), is a woman who takes the dominant role in [[BDSM]] activities. A dominatrix might be of any sexual orientation, but her orientation does not necessarily limit the genders of her submissive partners. The role of a dominatrix may not even involve physical pain toward the submissive; her domination can be verbal, involving humiliating tasks, or servitude. A dominatrix is typically a paid professional (''pro-domme'') as the term ''dominatrix'' is little-used within the non-professional BDSM scene.

The term ''domme'' is a coined pseudo-French female variation of the slang ''dom'' (short for ''dominant''). The use of ''domme'', ''dominatrix'', ''dom'', or ''dominant'' by any woman in a dominant role is chosen mostly by personal preference and the conventions of the local BDSM scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Easton|Hardy|2002|p=iii}}: "Semantics vary widely throughout the kinky world, from one region to the next, one sexual orientation to the next, one playstyle to the next."&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''mistress''  or ''dominant mistress'' is sometimes also used. ''Female dominance'', ''female domination'' or '''''femdom''''' refer to BDSM activities in which the dominant partner is female.

As fetish culture is increasingly becoming more prevalent in Western media, [[List of dominatrices in popular culture|depictions of dominatrices in film and television]] have become more common.

== Etymology ==
''Dominatrix'' is the feminine form of the [[Latin]] ''dominator'', a ruler or lord, and was originally used in a non-sexual sense. Its use in English dates back to at least 1561. Its earliest recorded use in the prevalent modern sense, as a female dominant in S&amp;M, dates to 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Oxford English Dictionary|title=Dominatrix|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/56699|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially coined to describe a woman who provides punishment-for-pay as one of the case studies within Bruce Roger's pulp paperback ''The Bizarre Lovemakers''.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Bruce (1967) "The Bizarre Lovemakers" cited in {{harvp|Nomis|2013|p=131}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was taken up shortly after by the Myron Kosloff title ''Dominatrix'' (with art by [[Eric Stanton]]) in 1968, and entered more popular mainstream knowledge following the 1976 film ''Dominatrix Without Mercy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nomis|2013|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the term ''dominatrix'' was not used, the classic example in literature of the female dominant-male submissive relationship is portrayed in the 1870 novella ''[[Venus in Furs]]'' by Austrian writer [[Leopold von Sacher-Masoch]]. The term ''[[Sadomasochism|masochism]]'' was later derived from the author's name by [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]] in the latter's 1886 forensic study ''[[Psychopathia Sexualis (book)|Psychopathia Sexualis]]''.

== History ==
[[File:Ostra Studio violin student.jpg|thumb|upright|A scene where both dominant and submissive are female, circa 1930s. A music teacher is caning the buttocks of a student with a [[violin bow]].]]

The history of the dominatrix is argued to date back to rituals of the Goddess [[Inanna]] (or [[Ishtar]] as she was known in Akkadian), in ancient Mesopotamia. Ancient cuneiform texts consisting of "Hymns to Inanna" have been cited as examples of the archetype of powerful, sexual female displaying dominating behaviors and forcing Gods and men into submission to her.&lt;ref&gt;"Inana and Ebih" ETCSL, Faculty of Oriental Studies, University of Oxford http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section1/tr132.htm cited in {{harvp|Nomis|2013|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologist and historian Anne O. Nomis notes that Inanna's rituals included cross-dressing of cult personnel, and rituals "imbued with pain and ecstasy, bringing about initiation and journeys of altered consciousness; punishment, moaning, ecstasy, lament and song, participants exhausting themselves with weeping and grief."&lt;ref&gt;See "A Hymn to Inana C" ETCSL, Faculty of Oriental Studies, University of Oxford see lines 70–80 viewable at http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section4/tr4073.htm cited in {{harvp|Nomis|2013|pp=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The profession appears to have originated as a specialization within [[brothel]]s, before becoming its own unique craft. As far back as the 1590s, flagellation within an erotic setting is recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nomis|2013|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; The profession features in erotic prints of the era, such as the British Museum mezzotint "The Cully Flaug'd" (c. 1674–1702), and in accounts of forbidden books which record the flogging schools and the activities practised.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nomis|2013|pp=80–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the 18th century, female "Birch Disciplinarians" advertised their services in a book masked as a collection of lectures or theatrical plays, entitled "[[Fashionable Lectures]]" (c. 1761).&lt;ref name="fashionable"&gt;"Fashionable Lectures" (c1761) British Library Rare Books collection, cited in {{harvp|Nomis|2013|pp=92–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; This included the names of 57 women, some actresses and courtesans, who catered to birch discipline fantasies, keeping a room with rods and cat o' nine tails, and charging their clients a Guinea for a "lecture".&lt;ref name="fashionable"/&gt;

The 19th century is characterised by what historian Anne O. Nomis characterises as the "Golden Age of the Governess". No fewer than twenty establishments were documented as having existed by the 1840s, supported entirely by flagellation practices and known as "Houses of Discipline" distinct from brothels.&lt;ref name="Nomis_101"&gt;{{harvp|Nomis|2013|p=101}}, citing original historical books and accounts from British Library "Rare Books", including Fraxi, Pisanus (pseudonym of Henry Spencer Ashbee) (1877) "Index Librorum Prohibitorum" (Index of Forbidden Books) and Mary Wilson "Preface" to "The Venus School-mistress" (edition dating to between 1836–1877; reprinted by Birchopolis in 1917)&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst the well-known "dominatrix governesses" were Mrs Chalmers, Mrs Noyeau, the late Mrs Jones of Hertford Street and London Street, the late Mrs [[Theresa Berkley]], Bessy Burgess of York Square and Mrs Pyree of Burton Cres.&lt;ref name="Nomis_101"/&gt; The most famous of these Governess "female flagellants" was [[Theresa Berkley]], who operated her establishment on [[Charlotte Street]] in the central [[London]] district of [[Marylebone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nomis|2013|pp=101–115}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is recorded to have used implements such as [[whip]]s, [[caning|canes]] and birches, to chastise and punish her male clients, as well as the [[Berkley Horse]], a specially designed flogging machine, and a pulley suspension system for lifting them off the floor.&lt;ref&gt;Fraxi, Pisanus (pseudonym of Henry Spencer Ashbee) "Index Librorum Prohibitorum" (Index of Forbidden Books) (1877)&lt;/ref&gt;  Such historical use of [[corporal punishment]] and [[Suspension bondage|suspension]], in a setting of [[Domination and submission (BDSM)|domination]] roleplay, connects very closely to the practices of modern-day professional dominatrices.

The "bizarre style" (as it came to be called) of leather catsuits, claws, tail whips, and latex rubber only came about in the 20th century, initially within commercial fetish photography, and taken up by dominatrices.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nomis|2013|pp=119–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the mid-20th century, dominatrices operated in a very discreet and underground manner, which has made them difficult to trace within the historical record. A few photographs still exist of the women who ran their domination businesses in London, New York, The Hague and Hamburg's [[Herbertstraße]], predominantly in sepia and black-and-white photographs, and scans from magazine articles, copied and re-copied. Amongst these were Miss Doreen of London who was acquainted with [[John Sutcliffe (designer)|John Sutcliffe]] of [[AtomAge]] fame, whose clients reportedly included Britain's top politicians and businessmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nomis|2013|pp=133–135}}&lt;/ref&gt; In New York, the dominatrix Anne Laurence was known within the underground circle of acquaintances during the 1950s, with Monique Von Cleef arriving in the early 1960s, and hitting national headlines when her home was raided by police detectives on 22 December 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nomis|2013|pp=140–151}}&lt;/ref&gt; Von Cleef went on to set up her "House of Pain" in The Hague in the 1970s, which became one of the world capitals for dominatrices, reportedly with visiting lawyers, ambassadors, diplomats and politicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nomis|2013|pp=151–157}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Domenica Niehoff]] worked as a dominatrix in Hamburg and appeared on talk shows on German television from the 1970s onwards, campaigning for [[sex workers' rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Childs|first=David|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/domenica-niehoff-prostitute-and-social-activist-who-campaigned-for-the-legalisation-of-her-1639293.html|title=Domenica Niehoff: Prostitute and social activist who campaigned for the legalisation of her profession|work=The Independent|date=7 March 2009|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mistress Raven, founder and manager of [[Pandora's Box (BDSM)|Pandora's Box]], one of New York's best known BDSM studios,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/09/movies/humiliation-business-and-its-customers.html|title=Humiliation Business And Its Customers|author=Stephen Holden|date= 9 May 1997|newspaper=The News York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; was featured in [[Nick Broomfield]]'s 1996 documentary film ''[[Fetishes (film)|Fetishes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041021033430/http://nyrock.com/movies/1997/fetishes.asp|url=http://nyrock.com/movies/1997/fetishes.asp|title=Fetishes: Whips, Chains and Other Family Entertainment|website=NY Rock|author=Otto Luck|date=May 1997|archive-date=21 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''dominatrix'' is mostly used to describe a female professional dominant (or "pro-domme") who is paid to engage in [[play (BDSM)|BDSM play]] with a submissive. An appointment or roleplay is referred to as a "session", and is often conducted in a dedicated professional play space which has been set up with specialist equipment, known as a "dungeon". Sessions may also be conducted remotely by letter or telephone, or in the contemporary era of technological connectivity by email or online chat. Most, but not all, clients of female professional dominants are men. Male professional dominants also exist, catering predominantly to the gay male market.

Women who engage in female domination typically promote and title themselves under the terms "dominatrix", "mistress", "lady", "madame", "herrin" or "goddess". In a study of German dominatrices, Andrew Wilson said that the trend for dominatrices choosing names aimed at creating and maintaining an atmosphere in which class, femininity and mystery are key elements of their self-constructed identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wilson|2005|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some professional dominatrices set minimum age limits for their clients. Popular requests from clients are for dungeon play including [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]], [[spanking]] and [[cock and ball torture]], or for [[medical fetishism|medical play]] using hoods, gas masks and [[urethral sounding]].&lt;ref name=Dublin&gt;{{cite news|title=Making men's fantasies a reality: The life of a professional dominatrix in Dublin|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/dublin-dominatrix-2878270-Dec2016/|work=The Journal|location=Ireland|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Verbal [[erotic humiliation]] is also popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What You Learn About Masculinity from Making Fun of Men's Small Dicks for a Living|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/9b8aw3/small-penis-humiliation-masculinity-trump|author=Margaret Corvid|date=28 August 2016|work=Vice}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not unusual for a dominatrix to consider her profession different from that of an [[Call girl|escort]] and not perform [[tie and tease]] or "[[Erotic massage#Commercial erotic and sexual massage|happy endings]]". Typically professional dominatrices do not have sexual intercourse with their clients, do not become naked with their clients&lt;ref name=Dublin/&gt; and do not allow their clients to touch them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|title='My wish is to serve you': A dominatrix reveals her clients' most intimate fantasies|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/my-wish-is-to-serve-you-a-dominatrix-reveals-her-clients-most-intimate-fantasies-9083506.html|newspaper=Independent|date=26 January 2014|access-date=22 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian dominatrix [[Terri-Jean Bedford]], who was one of three women who initiated an application in the [[Ontario Superior Court]] seeking invalidation of Canada's laws regarding [[brothel]]s, sought to differentiate for clarity her occupation as a dominatrix rather than a [[prostitute]] to the media, due to frequent misunderstanding and conflation by the public of the two terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canadian prostitution law|work=The World|publisher=PRI|url=http://www.theworld.org/2010/09/29/canadian-prostitution-law/||archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101004182757/http://www.theworld.org/2010/09/29/canadian-prostitution-law/|date=29 September 2010|archivedate=4 October 2010|postscript=.

While dominatrices come from many different backgrounds, it has been shown that a considerable number are well-educated. Research into US dominatrices published in 2012 indicated that 39% of the sample studied had received some sort of graduate training.{{sfn|Lindemann|2012|p=187}}

A 1985 study suggested that about 30 percent of participants in BDSM subculture were female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01550846 |title=On the prevalence and roles of females in the sadomasochistic subculture: Report of an empirical study |year=1985 |last1=Breslow |first1=Norman |last2=Evans |first2=Linda |last3=Langley |first3=Jill |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=303–17 |pmid=4051718}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1994 report indicated that around a quarter of the women who took part in BDSM subculture did so professionally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01541410 |title=The prevalence and some attributes of females in the sadomasochistic subculture: A second report |year=1994 |last1=Levitt |first1=Eugene E. |last2=Moser |first2=Charles |last3=Jamison |first3=Karen V. |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=465–73 |pmid=7993186}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1995 study of Internet [[discussion group]] messages, the preference for the dominant-initiator role was expressed by 11% of messages by heterosexual women, compared to 71% of messages by heterosexual men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01542185 |title=Sexual bondage: A review and unobtrusive investigation |year=1995 |last1=Ernulf |first1=Kurt E. |last2=Innala |first2=Sune M. |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |volume=24 |issue=6 |pages=631–54 |pmid=8572912}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional dominatrices can be seen advertising their services online and in print publications which carry erotic services advertising, such as [[contact magazine]]s and [[fetish magazine]]s that specialise in female domination.{{sfn|Lindemann|2012|p=42}} The precise number of women actively offering professional domination services is unknown. Most professional dominatrices practice in large metropolitan cities such as New York, Los Angeles, and London, with as many as 200 women working as dominatrices in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Black |first=Tony |title=Dominatrix Directory: Los Angeles – Star Pro-Dommes |url=http://fetpro.com/dominatrix-directory-los-angeles-stars/ |accessdate=12 March 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312224343/http://fetpro.com/dominatrix-directory-los-angeles-stars/ |archivedate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional dominatrices may take pride or differentiation in their psychological insight into their clients' [[sexual fetishism|fetishes]] and desires, as well as their technical ability to perform complex BDSM practices, such as [[Japanese bondage|Japanese shibari]] and other forms of [[Bondage (sexual)|bondage]], [[Suspension bondage|suspension]], [[Cock and ball torture (sexual practice)|torture]] roleplay, and [[corporal punishment]], and other such practices which require a high degree of knowledge and competency to safely oversee. From a sociological point of view, Danielle Lindemann has stated the "embattled purity regime" in which many Pro-Dommes emphasise their specialist knowledge and professional skills, while distancing themselves from economic criteria for success, in a way which is comparable to avant-garde artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lindemann|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some dominatrices practice [[financial domination]], or findom, a fetish in which a submissive is aroused by sending money or gifts to a dominatrix at her instruction. In some cases the dominatrix is given control of the submissive's finances or a "blackmail" scenario is acted out. In the majority of cases the dominatrix and the submissive do not physically meet. The interactions are typically performed using the Internet, which is also where  such services are advertised. Findom was originally a niche service that a traditional dominatrix would offer, but it has become popular with less-experienced online practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|title=What is Findom? A Submissive Man Explains the Fetish|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/love-sex/findom-what-is-it-financial-domination-definition-explained-a7646931.html|newspaper=The Independent|location=UK|author=Rachel Hosie|date=24 March 2017|access-date=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To differentiate women who identify as a dominatrix but do not offer paid services, non-professional dominants are occasionally referred to as a "lifestyle" dominatrix or Mistress. The term "lifestyle" to signify BDSM is occasionally a contention topic in the BDSM community and that some dominatrices may dislike the term. Some professional dominatrices are also "lifestyle" dominatrices - i.e., in addition to paid sessions with submissive clients they engage in unpaid recreational sessions or may incorporate power exchange within their own private lives and relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Holly (2011)  "Unleashed: The secret world of Britain's Dominatrixes" in [https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/love-sex/fantasies-fetishes/unleashed-the-secret-world-of-britains-dominatrixes-6263209.html The Independent, 20 November 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term has fallen out of general usage with respect to women who are dominant in their private relationships, and has taken on more and more, the connotation of "professional."

==Imagery==
[[File:Vivian LaVey at AVN Adult Entertainment Expo 2011 1.jpg|thumb|upright|A dominatrix wearing typical [[fetish fashion]] themed [[Latex clothing|latex]] dress, [[fishnet stockings]] and [[stiletto heels]]. She is holding a [[Paddle (spanking)|spanking paddle]].]]

The dominatrix is a female [[archetype]] which operates on a symbolic mode of representation, associated with particular attire and props that are drawn on within popular culture to signify her role—as a strong, dominant, sexualised woman—linked to but distinct from images of [[sexual fetish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Reichert|Lambiase|2003|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the twentieth century, the imagery associated with dominatrices was developed by the work of a number of artists including the costume designer and photographer [[Charles Guyette]], the publisher and film director [[Irving Klaw]], and the illustrators [[Eric Stanton]] and [[Gene Bilbrew]] who drew for the fetish magazine [[Exotique]].

One of the ubiquitous garments associated with the dominatrix is the [[catsuit]]. Historically, the black leather female catsuit entered dominant fetish culture in the 1950s with the ''[[AtomAge]]'' magazine and its connections to fetish fashion designer [[John Sutcliffe (designer)|John Sutcliffe]]. The spill-over into mainstream culture, occurred with catsuits being worn by strong female protagonists in popular 1960s TV programs like ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'', and in the comic super-heroines such as [[Catwoman]], in which the catsuit represented the independent woman capable of "kick-ass" moves and antics, enabling complete freedom of movement. On another level, the one-piece [[catsuit]] accentuated and exaggerated the sexualized female form, providing visual access to a woman's body, while simultaneously obstructing physical penetrative access. "You can look but you can't touch" is the mechanism of this operation, which plays upon the BDSM practice known as "[[tease and denial]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Tseëlon|2004|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other common signifying footwear of the dominatrix are [[thigh-high boots]] in leather or shiny PVC, which have long held a fetishistic status and are sometimes called [[kinky boots]], along with the very high [[stiletto heel]]. [[Fishnet]] stockings, [[Seamed stockings|seamed hosiery]], and [[stocking]]s and [[Garter (stockings)#Garter belts|garter belts]] (suspenders) are also popular accents in the representation and attire of dominatrices, to emphasize the form and length of their legs, with erotic connotation.

Tight, leather [[corset]]s are another staple garment of the dominatrix signification. Gloves, whether long [[opera gloves]] or fingerless gloves, are often a further accessory to emphasize the feminine role. [[Neck corset]]s may also be worn. 

Dominatrices often wear clothing made from [[fetish fashion]] materials. Examples include  [[PVC clothing]], [[latex clothing]] and garments drawn from the [[leather subculture]]. In some cases elements of dominatrix attire, such as leather boots and peaked cap, are drawn from [[Nazi chic]], particularly the black [[SS officer]]'s uniform which has been widely adopted and fetishized by underground gay and BDSM lifestyle groups to satisfy a [[uniform fetish]].

The body language of the dominatrix is frequently represented by the use of strong, dominant body-language which is comparable to the [[animal communication|dominant posturing in the animal world]]. The props she may brandish will strongly signify her role as dominatrix, such as bearing a flogger, whip or riding crop as illustrated in the artwork of [[Bruno Zach]] in the early 20th century,&lt;ref name=Bonhams&gt;{{cite web|title=Bruno Zach's 'Riding Crop Girl' hits World Record $150,602 at Bonhams art auction|url=https://www.justcollecting.com/miscellania/bruno-zachs-riding-crop-girl-hits-world-record-150-602-at-bonhams-art-auction|website=justcollecting.com|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bonhams Lot 116"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lot 116 - Bruno Zach 'The Riding Crop' an Impressive Green and Gilt Patinated Bronze|url=https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/20122/lot/116/|website=Bonhams.com|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in conventional representation. 

Practicing professional dominatrices may draw their attire from the conventional signifiers of the role, or adapt them to create their own individual style, where there exists a potential pull—between meeting conventional expectations, and a desire for dominant independent self-expression. Some contemporary dominatrices draw upon an eclectic range of strong female archetypes, including the goddess, the female superheroine, the femme fatale, the priestess, the empress, the queen, the governess, the [[KGB]] secret agent, to their own ends.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wilson|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Egusi''' (also known by variations including '''agusi''', '''agushi''') is the name for the [[fat]]- and [[protein]]-rich seeds of certain [[cucurbitaceous]] plants ([[Squash (plant)|squash]], [[melon]], [[gourd]]), which after being dried and ground are used as a major ingredient in [[West African cuisine]].&lt;ref&gt;Rachel C. J. Massaquoi, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bKwN7Absx6AC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;dq=egusi+west+africa&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6BvAMFWjYL&amp;sig=O8Pu-7BpW5znWdVdEHV9b66mgNU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwikwMKs28fQAhVsBsAKHYk6AXwQ6AEItwEwHQ#v=onepage&amp;q=egusi%20west%20africa&amp;f=false "Groundnut, Egusi, Palm Oil, and Other Soups"], in ''Foods of Sierra Leone and Other West African Countries: A Cookbook'', AuthorHouse, 2011, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Authorities disagree whether the word is used more properly for the seeds of the [[colocynth]], those of a particular large-seeded variety of the [[watermelon]], or generically for those of ''any'' cucurbitaceous plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=National Research Council|title=Lost Crops of Africa: Volume II: Vegetables|date=2006|publisher=National Academies Press (155–171) |chapter=Egusi |page=158|url=https://www.nap.edu/read/11763/chapter/10#155}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The characteristics and uses of all these seeds are broadly similar. Major egusi-growing nations include [[Mali]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Togo]], [[Ghana]], [[Côte d'Ivoire]], [[Benin]], [[Nigeria]], and [[Cameroon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=National Research Council|title=Lost Crops of Africa: Volume II: Vegetables|date=2006|publisher=|chapter=Egusi |page=169|url=https://www.nap.edu/read/11763/chapter/10#155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
'''Egusi soup''' is a kind of [[soup]] thickened with the ground seeds and popular in [[West Africa]], with considerable local variation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Badiru, I. |author2= Badiru, D. |last-author-amp=yes|title=Isi Cookbook: Collection of Easy Nigerian Recipes|page=36|date=2013|publisher=iUniverse|location=Bloomington|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pDj5SB3KF8UC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=egusi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QfZQVZr5GJCNyATyloHYDw&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=egusi&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Besides the seeds, water, and oil, egusi soup typically contains [[leaf vegetable]]s, other [[vegetable]]s, [[seasoning]]s, and [[meat]]. Leaf vegetables typically used for egusi soup include [[bitterleaf]], [[Telfairia occidentalis|pumpkin leaf]], [[celosia]] and [[spinach]].  Typical other vegetables include [[tomato]]es and [[okra]].  Typical seasonings include [[chili pepper]]s, [[onion]]s, and [[Parkia biglobosa|locust beans]].  Also commonly used are [[beef]], [[goat]], [[fish]], [[shrimps]], or [[crayfish]].

In [[Nigeria]], egusi is very popular among the  [[Igbo people]] of southeastern Nigeria, the [[Ibibio people]] and the [[Efik people]] ([[Calabar]] people) of southern Nigeria, the [[Hausa people|Hausa]] of northern Nigeria and the [[Edo people]], [[Esan people]], and [[Etsakọ people]] of the south-west of Nigeria. [[Yoruba people]] in general and quite notably the people of [[Osun State, Nigeria|Ọṣun State]] – especially the [[Ijesha]] people – eat "Iyan and Egusi", a pounded yam and egusi soup.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vegannigerian.com/2013/05/iyan-egusi-soup.html "Iyan &amp; Egusi Soup"], The Vegan Nigerian, 19 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ghana]], egusi is also called akatoa of agushi, and as in Nigeria is used for soup and stew,&lt;ref&gt;[http://omgvoice.com/lifestyle/nigerian-foods-eaten-ghanaians-different-names/ "13 Nigerian Foods That Are Eaten By Ghanaians But Have Different Names"], OMGVoice.&lt;/ref&gt; and most popularly in [[palaver sauce]].&lt;ref&gt;Freda Muyambo, [http://africancuisine.about.com/od/West-African-Cuisine/r/Palaver-Sauce-Recipe.htm "Palaver Sauce Recipe"], About food.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A Plate of Pounded Yam (Iyan) served in Birmingham UK.JPG|thumb|A plate of pounded yam (Iyan) and egusi soup]]

In the late 1980s, the [[Canada|Canadian]] government funded a project intended to develop a machine to help [[Cameroon]]ians shell egusi seeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.idrc.ca/en/ev-83035-201_850336-1-IDRC_ADM_INFO.html |title=Projects in Cameroon |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141127190745/http://web.idrc.ca/en/ev-83035-201_850336-1-IDRC_ADM_INFO.html |archivedate=2014-11-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A machine has been developed in Nigeria to shell egusi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Shittu, S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13265">''Fadenya'' or “father-childness” is a word used by [[Mande peoples]], originally to describe the tensions between half-brothers with the same father and different mothers.&lt;ref name="Jansen"/&gt; The concept of ''fadenya'' has been stretched and is often used to describe the political and social dynamism of the Mande world. ''Fadenya'' is often discussed in contrast to ''badenya'', or mother-childness.&lt;ref name="Bird1980"/&gt;

== Definition ==

''Fadenya'' originally described the conflicts between half-siblings with the same father, but different mothers. In the traditionally [[polygamous]] Mande world, half-brothers would often compete for control of their father’s lineage and claim to his wealth and land. In order to do so, these brothers would have to set out on their own, leaving the safety of their community, in order to achieve recognition independently and claim the lineage of their father or to “[overcome] paternal and ancestral reputations”.&lt;ref name="Bulman"&gt;Bulman, Stephen (1995). "The Image of the Young Hero in the Printed Corpus of the Sunjata Epic.  ''Younger Brother in Mande: Kinship and Politics in West Africa'' (76-93)&lt;/ref&gt;

This setting out to make a name for oneself was particularly common among younger brothers, who were less likely to receive anything from their father and therefore more motivated to overhaul the system through their own actions. These younger brothers have more to gain and much less to lose if they leave the family to seek their own fortunes.

Although the term originally refers specifically to the conflict between brothers, the concept of ''fadenya'' is much larger than intra-familial conflict. In addition to its meaning of “father-childness", ''fadenya'' is also used as a word for conflict in general.&lt;ref name="Jansen"&gt;Jansen, Jan (1995). "Kinship as Political Discourse: The Representation of Harmony and Change in Mande". ''Younger Brother in Mande: Kinship and Politics in West Africa'' (1-7)&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Fadenya'' can also extend beyond immediate family and affect an entire clan.&lt;ref&gt;Bagayogo, Shaka (1989). Places and Power Theory in the Mande World: Today and in the Past (445-459)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Fadenya'' is seen as the source of political and social change in the Mande world, for upheaval of the existing social order occurs due to the tension of ''fadenya''. ''Fadenya'' is associated with “centrifugal forces of social disequilibrium: envy, jealousy, competition, self-promotion”.&lt;ref name="Bird1980"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bird |first1=Charles S. |author2=Martha B. Kendell |editors=Ivan Karp, Charles S. Bird |title=Explorations in African Systems of Thought |date=1980 |publisher=Indiana University Press |pages=13–26 |chapter=The Mande Hero: Text and Context}} Reprinted as {{cite book |editors=Ivan Karp, Charles S. Bird |title=Explorations in African Systems of Thought |date=1987 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press |isbn=978-0-87474-591-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Fadenya'' is the catalyst and root of all sociopolitical changes in the Mande world, “the conceptual vehicle of dymanism in Mande society”, and thus carries with it all of those connotations.&lt;ref name="Skinner"&gt;Skinner, Ryan (2010). "Civil Taxis and Wild Trucks: the Dialectics of Social Space and Subjectivity in Dimanche a Bamako" ''Popular Music'' (17-39)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Fadenya'' itself requires a departure from society, whether literal or not.&lt;ref name="Skinner"/&gt;  In many traditional tales, one leaves one’s family and the safety it provides in order to make one's own name and fortune.&lt;ref name="Bamba"&gt;Bamba Suso (1999). Sunjata&lt;/ref&gt; ''Fadenya'' does not always imply a physical journey, however. One may also figuratively leave one's family and village by deviating in opinion or values.

Because ''fadenya'' describes paternal ties, and almost always describes tensions between men, ''fadenya'' is often considered a decidedly masculine force. This creates an interesting cultural phenomenon, in which men are seen as the forces of change and advancement or decline.  The masculinization of change creates interesting gender roles within the Mande world.

== Positive and Negative ''Fadenya'' ==

=== Positive ''Fadenya'' Leading to Innovation ===

Because it is defined as rivalry and tension between half-siblings, ''fadenya'' may seem like an intrinsically destructive force.  However, in reality, it is often tremendously positive. ''Fadenya'' is the means through which “the innovative actions of the young hero can lead to a modification of norms within the tradition of a community.” &lt;ref name="Jansen"/&gt; Through a positive form of ''fadenya'', one can improve society through the evolution and growth of customs. It is only through innovation that a society can survive and thrive, and positive ''fadenya'' provides the impetus for such change.&lt;ref name="Bird1980"/&gt;

This positive ''fadenya'' is “predicated on commitment to society’s traditions and social mores and describes how such traditions and mores are reproduced or ‘’reinvented’’ to meet the demands of, and even develop and improve, modern social life”.&lt;ref name="Skinner"/&gt; The emphasis in positive ''fadenya'' is a respect for the existing elements of society and a recognition that traditions should be “reinvented” as opposed to essentially changed. For ''fadenya'' to be positive, it must place value in the current society and ''badenya'', and change elements only to innovate, not to destroy or severely alter.&lt;ref name="Skinner"/&gt;

As seen in the figure, positive ''fadenya'' necessitates reintegration.&lt;ref name="Skinner"/&gt; One must return from one's experience of the outside world or of other views, and bring this new knowledge to the community, using it to innovate and adapt existing customs.

=== Negative ''Fadenya'' Leading to Destruction and Shame ===

In contrast to positive ''fadenya'', negative ''fadenya'' harms society. In instances of negative ''fadenya'', one does not return with positive methods of integrating and innovating. A “dissociate breakdown into wildness” occurs, leaving family members shamed and society worse off.&lt;ref name="Skinner"/&gt;

One may use cruel force to impose different and self-serving values, rejecting years of societal progress and disrespecting the innovations and work of those who came before.&lt;ref name="Bird1980"/&gt; That is, of course, if one returns at all. Negative ''fadenya'' can also signal an individual's complete break from society, in which one leaves and never returns with anything to benefit one's own family and people.&lt;ref name="Skinner"/&gt; This also brings about great shame.

== Relationship with ''Badenya'' ==

=== ''Badenya'' ===

''Badenya'' refers to “mother-childness” or the relationship between siblings of the same mother within the polygamous structure.&lt;ref name="Bird1980"/&gt; Because these siblings often share a closer bond, and do not compete among themselves as half siblings with the same father, ''badenya'' is a source of safety and security.&lt;ref name= "Jansen"/&gt; ''Badenya'' is often what saves one from the tensions and competitiveness of ''fadenya''. One can always rely on a full sibling because of ''badenya''.

When expanded, ''badenya'' is a uniting, community-oriented force; it promotes stasis and security.  Just as ''badenya'' is used to mean mother-childness or sibling-hood, it is also used to mean harmony.&lt;ref name="Jansen"/&gt; It “connotes devotion to home, family and tradition” and “conveys a sense of community, social solidarity, and shared intimacy”.&lt;ref name="Skinner"/&gt;  Within the community, ''badenya'' represents the “centripetal forces of society: submission to authority, stability, cooperation”.&lt;ref name="Bird1980"/&gt; The “strong forces in Mande society [which] emphasize group norms, decisions and success over those of the individual…are reflected in the term ''badenya''.&lt;ref name="Bulman"/&gt;

=== Interactions between ''Fadenya'' and ''Badenya'' ===

''Badenya'' is the reason which communities stay together despite ''fadenya''; it is the strong link that acts against the weaker ones of ''fadenya''. ''Badenya'' acts as the status quo to the change represented by ''fadenya'' and “carries with it a strong moral valence; there is a sense of an essential ‘goodness’ and ‘rightness’ to the familial collectivity badenya implies".&lt;ref name="Skinner"/&gt;

''Fadenya'' is the “ ‘paternal’ corollary to the ‘maternal’ mores of ''badenya''”.&lt;ref name="Skinner"/&gt;  Just as ''fadenya'' is masculinized, ''badenya'' is feminized, as it represents maternal connection. It is also worth noting that it is through ''badenya'' that women often display their influence in society, for they have the power to protect their children from the forces of ''fadenya''. By placing security and stability into the realm of women, ''badenya'' emphasizes their important role in society.

It is important to note that in the Mande world, both ''badenya'' and ''fadenya'' are integral to the survival of a community. While “Mande peoples focus much socialization activity on the fostering of fadenya behavior, recognizing that it is only through this force of change that their community will be able to survive trials and a changing world; they also recognize that without the stability badenya provides, their societies would be plunged into constant chaos." &lt;ref name="Bird1980"/&gt; The tension between ''badenya'' and ''fadenya'' represents the tensions between the group and the individual. This tension is not dichotomous, but rather an “intersection of two axes”.&lt;ref name="Bird1980"/&gt;

==Cultural Examples of ''Fadenya'' ==

=== Sunjata ===
The story of [[Sunjata]], the founder of the [[Mali Empire]], is a tremendously important aspect of Mande culture and provides not only historical information, but cultural information as well. Traditionally told through [[Griots]], Sunjata contains many examples of ''fadenya'', ''badenya'', and their interactions.

==== Summary ====

The story, as told by Bamba Suso, begins with the birth of Sunjata to the King, Fata Kung Makhang, and his mother, Sukulung. Sunjata is the first son born to his father, and thus should inherit his kingdom, but when messengers bring the news of Sunjata’s birth to the King, he had already received notice of the birth of a second son, and wrongfully does not acknowledge Sunjata as his first born.

Nonetheless, it has been foretold that Sunjata will one day inherit his father’s kingdom and become a great leader. When his father eventually dies, his half-brothers seek to destroy him to eliminate any threat of competition. At this point, Sunjata decides to leave his people, and sojourns to find his destiny. Through a series of events in which his mother and sister provide tremendous help, Sunjata is able to become King and rule.

==== Examples of ''Fadenya'' and ''Badenya'' ====

Examples of ''fadenya'' are numerous in the story of Sunjata: from the way he is exiled and later comes to rule the Mande kingdom to his relationship with his mother. From the beginning of the tale, strong ''fadenya'' is established between Sunjata and his half-brothers, one of whom has stolen his place as the first born. This ''fadenya'' returns later, after the death of his father, when “his brothers got together,/ and then they went to a sorcerer/ and told him, ‘Attack [Sunjata] with a korte till he dies”. ***  In response to this ''fadenya'', Sunjata leaves his home to set out to make a destiny of his own, a classic element of ''fadenya''.&lt;ref name= "Bird1980"/&gt;

Through Sunjata’s journey, we see many examples of ''badenya''. Even as a child, when he could not walk, it is his mother who comes to his aid when Sunjata proclaims “Call my mother:/ when a child has fallen down, it is his mother who picks him up” reflecting the deeply maternal and supportive essence of ''badenya'' ***. Later, when Sunjata is plotting to overthrow the rival who has stolen his homelands, it is Sunjata's sister who stands by his side and charms the tyrant into revealing his secrets. The fact that it is Sunjata's sister who plays such a significant role in his rise to power is reflective of the strong relationship between full siblings as described by ''badenya''.

=== The Kouta Trilogy ===

Twentieth-century [[Mali]]an author [[Massa Makan Diabaté]]'s "Kouta trilogy" is often interpreted as demonstrating the conflict between ''fadenya'' and ''badenya''. In [[Le lieutenant de Kouta]], for example, the titular lieutenant struggles against the tyranny of his traditional [[animist]] elder brother, while seeking to preserve other traditions in the face of a youth-driven independence movement.&lt;ref&gt;Keïta, Cheick M. Chérif. ''Un Griot mandingue à la rencontre de l’écriture''. Paris: Editions L'Harmattan, 1995. p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Le coiffeur de Kouta]] ("The Barber of Kouta"), the trilogy's second novel, the elders of the village similarly cite tradition in plotting against the village's young people, only to later realize that they must step aside so that the village can evolve and grow.&lt;ref&gt;Keïta, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Flying Spaghetti Monster''' ('''FSM''') is the deity of the '''Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster''', or '''Pastafarianism'''. Pastafarianism (a [[portmanteau]] of ''[[pasta]]'' and ''[[Rastafari|Rastafarianism]]'') is a [[social movement]] that promotes a light-hearted view of religion and opposes the teaching of [[intelligent design]] and [[creationism]] in public schools. According to adherents, Pastafarianism is a "real, legitimate religion, [[definition of religion|as much as any other]]".&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.venganza.org/?page_id=2|title=About|last=Henderson|first=Bobby|work=The Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster|accessdate=August 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In New Zealand, Pastafarian representatives are authorized to officiate weddings.&lt;ref name="NZcelebrant" &gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11595894 |title= First Pastafarian celebrant can help couples get noodley knotted |first=Nicholas |last=Jones |authorlink= |website=[[New Zealand Herald]]|date= Feb 26, 2016|accessdate=June 24, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NZPirateWedding" &gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-35112484|title=NZ approves Pastafarian marriages|date=December 16, 2015|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-36062126 |title=New Zealand stages first Pastafarian wedding on pirate boat |publisher=BBC |date=April 16, 2016 |accessdate=April 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the United States, a federal judge has ruled that the "Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster" is not a real religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reisman|first1=Sam|title=Federal judge rules the Flying Spaghetti Monster is not a God|url=https://www.rt.com/usa/339519-judge-flying-spaghetti-god/|website=RT.com|publisher=RT Question More|accessdate=April 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2018 the [[Council of State (Netherlands)|Dutch Council of State]] also ruled that Pastafarianism is not a religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/16/pastafarianism-is-not-a-religion-dutch-court-rules |title=Spaghetti injunction: Pastafarianism is not a religion, Dutch court rules |first=Jon |last=Henley |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=August 16, 2018 |accessdate=August 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Flying Spaghetti Monster" was first described in a satirical open letter written by [[Bobby Henderson (activist)|Bobby Henderson]] in 2005 to protest the [[Kansas evolution hearings|Kansas State Board of Education decision]] to permit teaching [[intelligent design]] as an [[Creation and evolution in public education|alternative to evolution in public school science classes]].&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt; In the letter, Henderson demanded equal time in science classrooms for "Flying Spaghetti Monsterism", alongside intelligent design and evolution.&lt;ref name="openletter"&gt;{{cite web |author=Henderson, Bobby |year=2005 |title=Open Letter To Kansas School Board |url=http://www.venganza.org/about/open-letter/ |publisher=Venganza.org |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407182624/http://www.venganza.org/about/open-letter/ |archivedate=April 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After Henderson published the letter on his website, the Flying Spaghetti Monster rapidly became an [[Internet meme|Internet phenomenon]] and a symbol of opposition to the teaching of intelligent design in public schools.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/29/arts/design/29mons.html?ex=1178251200 |title=But Is There Intelligent Spaghetti Out There?|accessdate=February 5, 2007|work=[[The New York Times]] Arts article|first=Sarah |last=Boxer |date=August 29, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pastafarian tenets (generally satires of creationism) are presented both on Henderson's ''Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster'' website, where he is described as "prophet", and in ''[[The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster]]'', written by Henderson in 2006. The central belief is that an invisible and undetectable Flying Spaghetti Monster created the universe. [[Pirates]] are revered as the original Pastafarians.&lt;ref name="alarabiya"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/07/13/157427.html |title=Austrian Pastafarian dons colander as religious headgear for drivers license |first= |last= |work=english.alarabiya.net |year=2011 |accessdate=July 22, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718004250/http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/07/13/157427.html |archive-date=July 18, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Henderson asserts that a decline in the number of pirates over the years is the cause of [[global warming]].&lt;ref name="openletter" /&gt; The FSM community congregates at Henderson's website to share ideas about the Flying Spaghetti Monster and crafts representing images of it.&lt;ref name="About"/&gt;

Because of its popularity and exposure, the Flying Spaghetti Monster is often used as a contemporary version of [[Russell's teapot]]—an argument that the philosophic burden of proof lies upon those who make [[unfalsifiable]] claims, not on those who reject them. Pastafarianism has received praise from the scientific community and criticism from proponents of intelligent design. Pastafarians have engaged in disputes with creationists, including in [[Polk County, Florida]], where they played a role in dissuading the local school board from adopting new rules on teaching evolution.&lt;ref name="Polk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tbo.com/news/education/polk-needled-noodled-in-evolution-flap-176172|title=Polk Needled, Noodled In Evolution Flap|author=Billy Townsend |date=March 27, 2013|publisher=The Tampa Tribune|accessdate=September 7, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henderson argued that his beliefs were just as valid as intelligent design, and called for equal time in science classrooms alongside intelligent design and evolution.&lt;ref name="openletter"/&gt; The letter was sent prior to the [[Kansas evolution hearings]] as an argument against the teaching of intelligent design in biology classes.&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt; Henderson, describing himself as a "concerned citizen" representing more than ten million others, argued that intelligent design and his belief that "the universe was created by a Flying Spaghetti Monster" were equally valid.&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt; In his letter, he noted,
{{quote|I think we can all look forward to the time when these three theories are given equal time in our science classrooms across the country, and eventually the world; one third time for Intelligent Design, one third time for Flying Spaghetti Monsterism, and one third time for logical conjecture based on overwhelming observable evidence.|Bobby Henderson&lt;ref name="openletter"/&gt;}}
According to Henderson, since the intelligent design movement uses ambiguous references to a designer, any conceivable entity may fulfill that role, including a Flying Spaghetti Monster.&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/2006-03-26-spaghetti-monster_x.htm |title="Spaghetti Monster" is noodling around with faith |accessdate=February 5, 2007 |work=[[USA Today]] Science &amp; Space article |first1=Dan |last1=Vergano |date=March 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henderson explained, "I don't have a problem with religion. What I have a problem with is religion posing as science. If there is a god&lt;!-- note: Original source does use non-capitalized "god."

In May 2005, having received no reply from the Kansas State Board of Education, Henderson posted the letter on his website, gaining significant public interest.&lt;ref name="About" /&gt;&lt;ref name="openletterabout"&gt;{{cite web |title=Discussion of the Open Letter |publisher=Henderson, Bobby |url=http://www.venganza.org/about/open-letter/discussion/ |accessdate=April 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, Pastafarianism became an Internet phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt;&lt;ref name="usatoday" /&gt; Henderson published the responses he then received from board members.&lt;ref name="openletterrespond"&gt;{{cite web |title=Kansas School Board Responses to the Open Letter |publisher=Henderson, Bobby |url=http://www.venganza.org/about/open-letter/responses/ |date = June 25, 2005 |accessdate=January 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three board members, all of whom opposed the curriculum amendments, responded positively; a fourth board member responded with the comment "It is a serious offense to mock God".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A18740559#back3|title=The Flying Spaghetti Monster|date=February 1, 2007|work=h2g2|publisher=BBC|accessdate=November 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henderson has also published the significant amount of hate mail, including death threats, that he has received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boingboing.net/2006/07/31/fsm-hate-mail.html|title=FSM hate mail|last=Frauenfelder|first=Mark|date=July 31, 2006|work=BoingBoing|accessdate=December 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/sciencetech/article/168629|title=In praise of an alternate creation theory: The Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster gains infamy and faith|date=January 7, 2007|work=[[Toronto Star]]|accessdate=December 31, 2009 |first=Leslie |last=Scrivener}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within one year of sending the open letter, Henderson received thousands of emails on the Flying Spaghetti Monster, eventually totaling over 60,000,&lt;ref name="Comment" /&gt; of which he has said that "about 95 percent have been supportive, while the other five percent have said I am going to hell".&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt; During that time, his site garnered tens of millions of hits.&lt;ref name="Comment"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.venganza.org/about/open-letter-discussion/|title=Comment on the Open Letter|last=Henderson|first=Bobby|date=August 2006|work=Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster|accessdate=December 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet phenomenon===

As word of Henderson's challenge to the board spread, his website and cause received more attention and support. The satirical nature of Henderson's argument made the Flying Spaghetti Monster popular with bloggers as well as humor and Internet culture websites.&lt;ref name="spiegel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,371205,00.html |publisher=[[Der Spiegel]] |date=August 24, 2005 |accessdate=September 8, 2007 |quote=[FSM] has certainly caught the imagination of the online community [...] Henderson receives over 150 emails from supporters every day. |title=A Tangled Tale of a Pasta-based Prophet }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Flying Spaghetti Monster was featured on websites such as [[Boing Boing]], [[Something Awful]], [[Uncyclopedia]], and [[Fark.com]]. Moreover, an International Society for Flying Spaghetti Monster Awareness and other fan sites emerged.&lt;ref name="Ha Ha, Only Serious" /&gt; As public awareness grew, the mainstream media picked up on the phenomenon. The Flying Spaghetti Monster became a symbol for the case against intelligent design in public education.&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Flying Spaghetti Monster |date=August 6, 2005 |publisher=[[New Scientist]] |url=https://www.newscientist.com/backpage.ns?id=mg18725112.800 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005083851/http://www.newscientist.com/backpage.ns?id=mg18725112.800 |archivedate=October 5, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Scott |last=Rothschild |title=Evolution debate creates monster |date=August 24, 2005 |work=[[Lawrence Journal-World]] |url=http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2005/aug/24/evolution_debate_creates_monster/?education }}&lt;/ref&gt; The open letter was printed in several major newspapers, including ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', and ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'',&lt;ref name="Comment" /&gt; and received worldwide press attention.&lt;ref name="Telegraph2" /&gt; Henderson himself was surprised by its success, stating that he "wrote the letter for [his] own amusement as much as anything".&lt;ref name="usatoday" /&gt;

In August 2005, in response to a challenge from a reader, Boing Boing announced a $250,000 prize—later raised to $1,000,000—of "Intelligently Designed currency" payable to any individual who could produce empirical evidence proving that Jesus is not the son of the Flying Spaghetti Monster.&lt;ref name="prize"&gt;{{cite web |title=Boing Boing's $250,000 Intelligent Design challenge |publisher = BoingBoing.net |url=http://boingboing.net/2005/08/19/boing-boings-250000.html |date = August 19, 2005 |accessdate=June 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was modeled as a parody of a [[Kent Hovind#$250,000 offer|similar]] challenge issued by [[Young Earth creationism|young-earth]] creationist [[Kent Hovind]].&lt;ref name="usatoday" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/hovind.html#appendix1 |title=Dr. Hovind's $250,000 Offer |author=Kent Hovind |accessdate=March 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Henderson, newspaper articles on the Flying Spaghetti Monster attracted the attention of book publishers; he said that at one point, there were six publishers interested in the Flying Spaghetti Monster.&lt;ref name="Comment" /&gt; In November 2005, Henderson received an advance from Villard to write ''[[The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster]]''.&lt;ref name="newyorkmag"&gt;{{cite news |first=Eric |last=Wolff |title=The Case For Intelligent Design: Spaghetti as the Creator |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date=November 16, 2005 |url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/people/columns/intelligencer/15011/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2005, the Kansas State Board of Education voted to allow criticisms of evolution, including language about intelligent design, as part of testing standards.&lt;ref name="washpost"&gt;{{cite news |title=Kansas Education Board First to Back "Intelligent Design" |date=November 9, 2005 |work=[[The Washington Post]]|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/08/AR2005110801211.html |first=Peter |last=Slevin |accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 13, 2007, the board voted 6–4 to reject the amended science standards enacted in 2005.

Although Henderson has stated that "the only dogma allowed in the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster is the rejection of dogma", some general beliefs are held by Pastafarians.&lt;ref name="About" /&gt; Henderson proposed many Pastafarian tenets in reaction to common arguments by proponents of intelligent design.&lt;ref name="gelf"&gt;{{cite news |first=Jessica |last=Thierman |title=Touched by his Noodly Appendage |date=September 18, 2005 |publisher=Gelf Magazine |url=http://www.gelfmagazine.com/mt/archives/touched_by_his_noodly_appendage.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; These "[[canon (basic principle)|canonical]] beliefs" are presented by Henderson in his letter to the Kansas State Board of Education,&lt;ref name="openletter" /&gt; ''The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster'', and on Henderson's web site, where he is described as a "prophet".&lt;ref name="flashguide" /&gt; They tend to satirize creationism.&lt;ref name="usatoday" /&gt;

===Creation===
{{see also|Omphalos hypothesis}}
The central creation myth is that an invisible and undetectable Flying Spaghetti Monster created the universe "after drinking heavily". According to these beliefs, the Monster's intoxication was the cause for a flawed Earth. Furthermore, according to Pastafarianism, all evidence for evolution was planted by the Flying Spaghetti Monster in an effort to test the faith of Pastafarians—parodying certain [[Biblical literalism|biblical literalists]].&lt;ref name="GOLEM" /&gt; When scientific measurements such as radiocarbon dating are taken, the Flying Spaghetti Monster "is there changing the results with His Noodly Appendage".&lt;ref name="openletter" /&gt;

===Afterlife===
The Pastafarian conception of [[Heaven]] includes a [[beer]] volcano and a [[stripper]] (or sometimes [[prostitute]]) factory.&lt;ref name="flashguide"&gt;{{cite web |author=DuBay, Tim |year=2005|title=Guide to Pastafarianism |format=Shockwave Flash|url=http://www.venganza.org/flash/guidetopastafarianismpreloaded.swf |accessdate=August 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pastafarian [[Hell]] is similar, except that the beer is stale and the strippers have [[sexually transmitted disease]]s.&lt;ref name="hell"&gt;''The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster'', p.83.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pirates and global warming===
[[File:PiratesVsTemp(en).svg|thumb|left|A [[misleading graph]] that is claimed to correlate the number of pirates with global temperature|alt=chart showing that in 1820 there were 25,000 pirates and the global average temperature was 14.2 degrees C, while in 2000 there were 17 pirates and the global average temperature was 15.9 degrees C.]]
According to Pastafarian beliefs, pirates are "absolute divine beings" and the original Pastafarians.&lt;ref name="openletter" /&gt; Furthermore, Pastafarians believe that the concept of pirates as "thieves and outcasts" is misinformation spread by Christian theologians in the Middle Ages and by [[Hare Krishnas]]. Instead, Pastafarians believe that they were "peace-loving explorers and spreaders of good will" who distributed candy to small children, adding that modern pirates are in no way similar to "the fun-loving buccaneers from history". In addition, Pastafarians believe that ghost pirates are responsible for all of the mysteriously lost ships and planes of the [[Bermuda Triangle]]. Pastafarians are among those who celebrate [[International Talk Like a Pirate Day]] on September 19.&lt;ref&gt;''The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster'', p.124.&lt;/ref&gt;

The inclusion of pirates in Pastafarianism was part of Henderson's original letter to the Kansas State Board of Education, in an effort to illustrate that [[correlation does not imply causation]].&lt;ref name="Volcano"&gt;{{cite book|last=Savino|first=John |author2=Marie D. Jones|title=Supervolcano: The Catastrophic Event That Changed the Course of Human History: Could Yellowstone Be Next|publisher=Career Press|year=2007|page=56|chapter=Wrath of the Gods|isbn=978-1-56414-953-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tSIa0VQn1NQC&amp;pg=PT55&amp;dq=Flying+Spaghetti+Monster#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|accessdate=November 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henderson presented the argument that "global warming, earthquakes, hurricanes, and other natural disasters are a direct effect of the shrinking numbers of pirates since the 1800s".&lt;ref name="openletter" /&gt; A deliberately [[misleading graph]] accompanying the letter (with numbers humorously disordered on the ''x''-axis) shows that as the number of pirates decreased, global temperatures increased. This parodies the suggestion from some religious groups that the high numbers of disasters, famines, and wars in the world is due to the lack of respect and worship toward their deity. In 2008, Henderson interpreted the growing pirate activities at the [[Gulf of Aden]] as additional support, pointing out that [[Somalia]] has "the highest number of pirates ''and'' the lowest [[carbon emissions]] of any country".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.venganza.org/2008/04/14/somalia/ |title=Somalia&amp;nbsp;— Lots of pirates, low carbon emissions |accessdate=December 10, 2008 |work= |publisher=www.venganza.org |date=April 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flying Spaghetti Monster Tree Topper.jpg|thumb|An alternative [[tree-topper]] for Pastafarians, handmade from pipe cleaners and pom poms.]]
===Holidays===
Pastafarian beliefs extend into lighthearted religious ceremony. Pastafarians celebrate every Friday as a holy day.&lt;ref name="usatoday" /&gt; Prayers are concluded with a final declaration of affirmation, "R'amen" (or "rAmen"); the term is a parodic [[portmanteau]] of the terms "Amen" and "[[Ramen]]", referring to instant noodles and to the "noodly appendages" of their deity.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news |title = In the beginning there was the Flying Spaghetti Monster |date=September 11, 2005 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=December 19, 2009|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1498162/In-the-beginning-there-was-the-Flying-Spaghetti-Monster.html |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the time of [[Christmas]], [[Hanukkah]], and [[Kwanzaa]], Pastafarians celebrate a vaguely defined holiday named "Holiday". Holiday does not take place on "a specific date so much as it is the Holiday season, itself". According to Henderson, as Pastafarians "reject dogma and formalism", there are no specific requirements for Holiday.

Pastafarians interpret the increasing usage of "Happy Holidays", rather than more traditional [[greetings]] (such as "Merry Christmas"), as support for Pastafarianism.&lt;ref name="holiday" /&gt; In December 2005, [[George W.

[[File:The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster]]''|alt=image of the cover of a book, red cover, gold lettering, title, small crudely drawn logo, author. No picture.]]
In December 2005 Bobby Henderson received a reported US$80,000 advance from [[Villard (imprint)|Villard]] to write ''The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster''. Henderson said he planned to use proceeds from the book to build a pirate ship, with which he would spread the Pastafarian religion.&lt;ref name="newyorkmag" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Katleen |last=Craig |title=Passion of the Spaghetti Monster |date=December 22, 2005 |publisher=Wired News |url=https://www.wired.com/politics/law/news/2005/12/69905 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was released on March 28, 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.ca/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780812976564|title=The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster|year=2009|publisher=[[Random House]]|accessdate=October 18, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723054624/http://www.randomhouse.ca/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780812976564|archive-date=July 23, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and elaborates on Pastafarian beliefs established in the open letter.&lt;ref name="Austin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/review?oid=oid%3A356663|title=The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster|last=Brenner|first=Wayne|date=April 14, 2006|work=[[The Austin Chronicle]] |accessdate=October 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henderson employs satire to present perceived flaws with [[evolutionary biology]] and discusses history and lifestyle from a Pastafarian perspective. The gospel urges readers to try Pastafarianism for thirty days, saying, "If you don't like us, your old religion will most likely take you back".&lt;ref name="Telegraph2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster'', p.xiv.&lt;/ref&gt; Henderson states on his website that more than 100,000 copies of the book have been sold.&lt;ref name="Book" /&gt;

''[[Scientific American]]'' described the gospel as "an elaborate spoof on Intelligent Design" and "very funny". In 2006, it was nominated for the [[Quill Award]] in Humor, but was not selected as the winner.&lt;ref name="Book"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.venganza.org/worship/fsm-book/|title=The FSM Book |last=Henderson|first=Bobby|year=2006|work=Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster|publisher=Venganza.org|accessdate=October 18, 2009|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100427153020/http://www.venganza.org/about/fsm-book/ |archivedate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wayne Allen Brenner of ''[[The Austin Chronicle]]'' characterized the book as "a necessary bit of comic relief in the overly serious battle between science and superstition".&lt;ref name="Austin" /&gt; [[Simon Singh]] of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' wrote that the gospel "might be slightly repetitive...but overall it is a brilliant, provocative, witty and important gem of a book".&lt;ref name="Telegraph2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3655035/Was-the-world-created-by-god-evolution-or-pasta.html|title=Was the world created by god, evolution or pasta?|last=Singh|first=Simon|date=September 3, 2006|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=November 28, 2009 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Casey Luskin of the [[Discovery Institute]], which advocates intelligent design, labeled the gospel "a mockery of the Christian [[New Testament]]".&lt;ref name="Luskin FSM and Christmas"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.evolutionnews.org/2006/12/celebrating_christmas_at_the_c.html|title="Celebrating" Christmas at the "Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster"|last=Luskin|first=Casey|date=December 25, 2006|work=Evolution News &amp; Views|publisher=[[Discovery Institute]]|accessdate=November 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Loose Canon''===
In September 2005, before Henderson had received an advance to write the ''Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster'', a Pastafarian member of the Venganza forums known as Solipsy, announced the beginning of a project to collect texts from fellow Pastafarians to compile into the ''Loose Canon, the Holy Book of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster'', essentially analogous to the Bible.&lt;ref name="The Big Announcement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.venganza.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=1899|title=The Big Announcement|year=2005|publisher=Venganza.org|accessdate=April 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was completed in 2010 and was made available for download.&lt;ref name="The Loose Canon"&gt;{{cite web

Some excerpts from ''The Loose Canon'' include:

{{Quote|"Since you have done a half-ass job, you will receive half an ass!" The Great Pirate Solomon grabbed his ceremonial scimitar and struck his remaining donkey, cleaving it in two.|''Slackers'' 1:51–52}}

===As a cultural phenomenon===
The Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster now consists of thousands of followers,&lt;ref name="Volcano" /&gt; primarily concentrated on college campuses in North America and Europe.&lt;ref name="Academics" /&gt; According to the Associated Press, Henderson's website has become "a kind of cyber-watercooler for opponents of intelligent design". On it, visitors track meetings of pirate-clad Pastafarians, sell trinkets and bumper stickers, and sample photographs that show "visions" of the Flying Spaghetti Monster.&lt;ref name="Fox"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,311925,00.html|title=Religious Scholars to Discuss 'Flying Spaghetti Monster'|date=November 16, 2007|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=November 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2005, the Swedish concept designer Niklas Jansson created an adaptation of Michelangelo's ''[[The Creation of Adam]]'', superimposing the Flying Spaghetti Monster over God. This became and remains the Flying Spaghetti Monster's de facto brand image.&lt;ref name="Ha Ha, Only Serious"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholarsbank.uoregon.edu/xmlui/handle/1794/9336|title=Ha Ha, Only Serious: A Preliminary Study of Joke Religions |last=Narizny|first=Laurel|date=October 2009|work=Department of Religious Studies And the Honors College of the University of Oregon|publisher=University of Oregon|pages=42–49|accessdate=November 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hunger Artists Theatre Company]] produced a comedy called ''The Flying Spaghetti Monster Holiday Pageant'' in December 2006, detailing the history of Pastafarianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Flying Spaghetti Monster Holiday Pageant |publisher = Hunger Artists Theatre Company |url=http://www.hungerartists.com/fsm.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070927220906/http://www.hungerartists.com/fsm.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-09-27 |date=December 2006 |accessdate=September 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The production has spawned a sequel called ''Flying Spaghetti Monster Holy Mug of Grog'', performed in December 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hunger Artists Theatre Company's 2008 Season |publisher = Hunger Artists Theatre Company |url=http://www.hungerartists.com/season08.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20080528150840/http://www.hungerartists.com/season08.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-05-28 |date=November 2007 |accessdate=September 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This communal activity attracted the attention of three [[University of Florida]] religious scholars, who assembled a panel at the 2007 [[American Academy of Religion]] meeting to discuss the Flying Spaghetti Monster.&lt;ref name="Academics"/&gt;

In November 2007, four talks about the Flying Spaghetti Monster were delivered at the American Academy of Religion's annual meeting in San Diego.&lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archive.wired.com/culture/education/news/2007/11/flying_spaghetti_monster|title=Flying Spaghetti Monster Inspires Wonky Religious Debate|date=November 20, 2007|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Wired|accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The talks, with titles such as ''Holy Pasta and Authentic Sauce: The Flying Spaghetti Monster's Messy Implications for Theorizing Religion'', examined the elements necessary for a group to constitute a religion. Speakers inquired whether "an anti-religion like Flying Spaghetti Monsterism &lt;nowiki&gt;[is]&lt;/nowiki&gt; actually a religion".&lt;ref name="Academics"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21837499//|title=Pasta monster gets academic attention|last=Pope|first=Justin|date=November 16, 2007|agency=Associated Press|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|accessdate=October 25, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080103192933/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21837499//|archive-date=September 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The talks were based on the paper, ''Evolutionary Controversy and a Side of Pasta: The Flying Spaghetti Monster and the Subversive Function of Religious Parody'',&lt;ref name="Escapist" /&gt; published in the GOLEM Journal of Religion and Monsters.&lt;ref name="GOLEM"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van Horn|first=Gavin|author2=Lucas Johnston|year=2007|title=Evolutionary Controversy and a Side of Pasta: The Flying Spaghetti Monster and the Subversive Function of Religious Parody|journal=GOLEM: Journal of Religion and Monsters|volume=2|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The panel garnered an audience of one hundred of the more than 9,000 conference attendees, and conference organizers received critical e-mails from Christians offended by it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/culture/education/news/2007/11/flying_spaghetti_monster |title=Flying Spaghetti Monster Inspires Wonky Religious Debate |last=Dotinga |first=Randy |date=November 20, 2007 |work=Wired Magazine |accessdate=December 20, 2009 |location=San Diego |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091202222303/http://www.wired.com/culture/education/news/2007/11/flying_spaghetti_monster |archivedate=December 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since October 2008, the local chapter of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster has sponsored an annual convention called [[Skepticon]] on the campus of [[Missouri State University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://broadcast44.com/FSM/about.htm |title=About the Event |year=2009 |work=Skepticon Productions |publisher=Missouri State Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster |accessdate=December 21, 2009 |location=Springfield, MO |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318015817/http://broadcast44.com/FSM/about.htm |archivedate=March 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Atheists and skeptics give speeches on various topics, and a debate with Christian experts is held.

===Use in religious disputes===
Owing to its popularity and media exposure, the Flying Spaghetti Monster is often used as a modern version of [[Russell's teapot]].&lt;ref name="Teapot"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Church of the Non-Believers |first=Gary |last=Wolf |date=November 14, 2006 |publisher=[[Wired News]] |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.11/atheism.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Is Faith the Enemy of Science?|last=MacKenzie|first=Richard|year=2007|volume=64|issue=103|journal=Physics in Canada|arxiv=0807.3670|bibcode=2008arXiv0807.3670M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents argue that, since the existence of the invisible and undetectable Flying Spaghetti Monster—similar to other proposed supernatural beings—cannot be [[falsified]], it demonstrates that the burden of proof rests on those who affirm the existence of such beings. [[Richard Dawkins]] explains, "The onus is on somebody who says, I want to believe in God, Flying Spaghetti Monster, fairies, or whatever it is. It is not up to us to disprove it."&lt;ref name="Teapot" /&gt; Furthermore, according to Lance Gharavi, an editor of ''The Journal of Religion and Theater'', the Flying Spaghetti Monster is "ultimately...an argument about the arbitrariness of holding any one view of creation", since any one view is equally as plausible as the Flying Spaghetti Monster.&lt;ref name="usatoday" /&gt; A similar argument was discussed in the books ''[[The God Delusion]]'' and ''The Atheist Delusion''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|title=The God delusion|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year=2006|page=53|chapter=The God Hypothesis|isbn=978-0-618-68000-9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yq1xDpicghkC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|accessdate=November 24, 2009|quote=I have found it an amusing strategy, when asked whether I am an atheist, to point out that the questioner is also an atheist when considering Zeus, Apollo, Amon Ra, Mithras, Baal, Thor, Wotan, the Golden Calf and the Flying Spaghetti Monster.

In December 2007 the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster was credited with spearheading successful efforts in [[Polk County, Florida]], to dissuade the [[Polk County School Board]] from adopting new science standards on evolution. The issue was raised after five of the seven board members declared a personal belief in intelligent design. Opponents describing themselves as Pastafarians e-mailed members of the Polk County School Board demanding equal instruction time for the Flying Spaghetti Monster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=John Chambliss |title= Satirical Monsters More Competition for Darwin|url=http://www.theledger.com/article/20071211/NEWS/712110392/0/FRONTPAGE |publisher=The Ledger |date=December 11, 2007 |accessdate=December 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Board member Margaret Lofton, who supported intelligent design, dismissed the e-mail as ridiculous and insulting, stating, "they've made us the laughing stock of the world". Lofton later stated that she had no interest in engaging with the Pastafarians or anyone else seeking to discredit intelligent design. As the controversy developed, scientists expressed opposition to intelligent design. In response to hopes for a new "applied science" campus at the [[University of South Florida]] in [[Lakeland, Florida|Lakeland]], university vice president Marshall Goodman expressed surprise, stating, "&lt;nowiki&gt;[intelligent design is]&lt;/nowiki&gt; not science. You can't even call it pseudo-science." While unhappy with the outcome, Lofton chose not to resign over the issue. She and the other board members expressed a desire to return to the day-to-day work of running the school district.&lt;ref name="Polk" /&gt;

==Legal status==
National branches of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster have been striving in many countries to have FSMism become an officially (legally) recognized religion, with varying degrees of success. In [[New Zealand]], Pastafarian representatives have been authorized as marriage celebrants, however members of other movements considered to be "alternative philosophies" rather than religions are also recognized as celebrants under New Zealand law.&lt;ref name="NZcelebrant" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NZPirateWedding" /&gt;

A federal court in the US state of Nebraska ruled that Flying Spaghetti Monster is a satirical [[parody religion]], rather than an actual religion, and as a result, Pastafarians are not entitled to religious accommodation under the [[Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"This is not a question of theology", the ruling reads in part. "The FSM Gospel is plainly a work of satire, meant to entertain while making a pointed political statement. To read it as religious doctrine would be little different from grounding a 'religious exercise' on any other work of fiction."&lt;ref name=Cavanaugh &gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/308299698/Cavanaugh-v-Bartelt|title=Cavanaugh v Bartelt|date=April 12, 2016|website=United States District Court for the District of Nebraska|access-date=April 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Pastafarians have used their claimed faith as a [[Test case (law)|test case]] to argue for [[freedom of religion]], and to oppose government discrimination against people who do not follow a recognized religion.

===Marriage===
The Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster operates an [[ordination mill]] on their website which enables officiates in jurisdictions where credentials are needed to officiate weddings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wright |first=Kimberly |url=http://www.kptv.com/story/23633416/online-ministerial-ordnation-available |title=You, too, can become a minister - online - KPTV - FOX 12 |publisher=KPTV |date=January 8, 2014 |accessdate=August 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pastafarians say that [[separation of church and state in the United States|separation of church and state]] precludes the government from arbitrarily labelling one denomination religiously valid but another an ordination mill. In November 2014, Rodney Michael Rogers and [[Minneapolis]]-based Atheists for Human Rights sued [[Washington County, Minnesota]] under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] equal protection clause and the [[First Amendment]] free speech clause, with their attorney claiming [[discrimination against atheists]]: "When the statute clearly permits recognition of a marriage celebrant whose religious credentials consist of nothing more than a $20 'ordination' obtained from the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster... the requirement is absolutely meaningless in terms of ensuring the qualifications of a marriage celebrant."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/local/east/280267352.html|title=Atheists sue Washington County over denial to perform marriages|publisher=Star-Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days prior to a hearing on the matter, Washington County changed its policy to allow Rogers his ability to officiate weddings. This action was done in an effort to deny the court jurisdiction on the underlying claim. On May 13, 2015 the Federal Court held that the issue had become [[Mootness|moot]] and dismissed the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Atheists for Human Rights v.

Another commissioner stated that this petition garnered more attention than any he had seen before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pennsylvanian Pastafarians fight for Holiday Display|url=http://www.venganza.org/2012/11/pennsylvanianholida|accessdate=December 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pasta-loving 'church' tests Pa. holiday display |url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Pasta-loving-church-tests-Pa-holiday-display-4073601.php |publisher=SF Gate |accessdate=December 2, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202011544/http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Pasta-loving-church-tests-Pa-holiday-display-4073601.php |archivedate=December 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
With regard to Bobby Henderson's 2005 open letter, according to Justin Pope of the ''[[Associated Press]]'': {{quote|Between the lines, the point of the letter was this: there's no more scientific basis for intelligent design than there is for the idea an omniscient creature made of pasta created the universe. If intelligent design supporters could demand equal time in a science class, why not anyone else? The only reasonable solution is to put nothing into sciences classes but the best available science.|Justin Pope&lt;ref name="Academics" /&gt;|}}
[[File:Dog Tag Atheist FSM.jpg|thumb|U.S. Army ID tag ([[dog tag]]) listing "Atheist/FSM" as the religious/belief system preference|alt=two metal US Army dog tags with Atheist/FSM stamped on them.]]
Justin Pope praised the Flying Spaghetti Monster as "a clever and effective argument".&lt;ref name="Fox" /&gt; [[Simon Singh]] of the ''Daily Telegraph'' described the Flying Spaghetti Monster as "a masterstroke, which underlined the absurdity of Intelligent Design", and applauded Henderson for "galvanis[ing] a defence of science and rationality".&lt;ref name="Telegraph2" /&gt; Sarah Boxer of the ''New York Times'' said that Henderson "has wit on his side".&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt; In addition, the Flying Spaghetti Monster was mentioned in an article footnote of the ''[[Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review]]'' as an example of evolution "enter[ing] the fray in popular culture", which the author deemed necessary for evolution to prevail over intelligent design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Brendan|year=2006|title=Kitzmiller v.

Casey Luskin of the [[Discovery Institute]], which promotes intelligent design, contested this, saying, "the problem for their logic is that ID is not an arbitrary explanation, because we have much experience with intelligent agents producing the type of informational complexity we see in nature."&lt;ref name="Luskin South Park"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evolutionnews.org/2008/08/the_proper_rebuttal_to_the_fly.html|title=The Proper Rebuttal to the Flying Spaghetti Monster: Cartoon Satire on South Park|last=Luskin|first=Casey|date=August 13, 2008|work=Evolution News &amp; Views|publisher=Discovery Institute|accessdate=November 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Columnist [[Jeff Jacoby (columnist)|Jeff Jacoby]] wrote in ''The Boston Globe'' that intelligent design "isn't primitivism or Bible-thumping or flying spaghetti.

==Background==
[[File:Framework for 21st Century Learning.jpg|thumbnail|P21's Framework for 21st Century Learning illustrates how the Four Cs skills are incorporated into a larger context]]

In 2002 the Partnership for 21st Century Skills (now the Partnership for 21st Century Learning, or '''P21''') was founded as a [[non-profit]] organization by a coalition that included members of the national business community, education leaders, and policymakers:  the [[National Education Association]] (NEA), [[United States Department of Education]], [[AOL Time-Warner|AOL Time Warner Foundation]], [[Apple Computer, Inc.]], [[Cable in the Classroom]], [[Cisco Systems, Inc.]], [[Dell Computer Corporation]], [[Microsoft Corporation]], [[SAP SE|SAP]], Ken Kay (President and Co-Founder), and Dins Golder-Dardis.&lt;ref name="P21history" /&gt; The [[American Management Association]]'s  "AMA 2010 Critical Skills Survey" found "that an overwhelming number of respondents believe that these 21st century skills are important to their organizations today and will become even more important in the future."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amanet.org/news/AMA-2010-critical-skills-survey.aspx#sthash.b3DH1pvT.dpuf ''AMA 2010 Critical Skills Survey''].  Retrieved 12016-03-03&lt;/ref&gt;

P21's goal is to foster a national conversation on "the importance of 21st century skills for all students" and "position 21st century readiness at the center of US K-12 education".&lt;ref name="P21history" /&gt; The organization has released reports exploring how to integrate the Four Cs approach into learning environments.

'''''Galatea 2.2''''' is a 1995 pseudo-autobiographical novel by American writer [[Richard Powers]] and a contemporary reworking of the [[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion]] myth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Harper|first=John|title=PYGMALION' FOR THE COMPUTER AGE|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/orlandosentinel/access/77874386.html?dids=77874386:77874386&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jul+09%2C+1995&amp;author=Reviewed+by+John+Harper+Special+To+The+Sentinel&amp;pub=Orlando+Sentinel&amp;desc=PYGMALION'+FOR+THE+COMPUTER+AGE&amp;pqatl=google|accessdate=6 September 2012|newspaper=Orlando Sentinel|date=Jul 9, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book's narrator shares the same name as Powers, with the book referencing events and books in the author's life while mentioning other events that may or may not be based upon Powers' life.

==Plot summary==

The main narrative tells the story of Powers' return to his ''[[alma mater]]''&amp;nbsp;– referred to in the novel as simply "U.", but clearly based on the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], the school Powers attended and teaches at as a professor&amp;nbsp;– after he has ended a long and torrid relationship with a loving but volatile woman, referred to as "C." Powers is an in-house author for the university, and lives for free for one year. He finds himself unable to write any more books, and spends the first portion of the novel attempting to write, but never getting past the first line.

Powers then meets a computer scientist named Philip Lentz. Intrigued by Lentz's overbearing personality and unorthodox theories, Powers eventually agrees to participate in an experiment involving [[artificial intelligence]]. Lentz bets his fellow scientists that he can build a computer that can produce an analysis of a literary text that is indistinguishable from one produced by a human. It is Powers' task to "teach" the machine. After going through several unsuccessful versions, Powers and Lentz produce a computer model (dubbed "Helen") that is able to communicate like a human. It is not clear to the reader or to Powers whether she is simulating human thought, or whether she is actually experiencing it. Powers tutors the computer, first by reading it [[Western canon|canonical]] works of literature, then current events, and eventually telling it the story of his own life, in the process developing a complicated relationship with the machine.

The novel also consists of extensive flashbacks to Powers' relationship with C., from their first meeting at U., to their [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] life in [[Boston]], to their move to C.'s family's town in the [[Netherlands]].

The novel culminates with Helen being unable to bear the realities of the world, and "leaving" Powers. She asks Powers to "see everything" for her, and subsequently shuts herself down. Her exit from the world forces Powers to experience a rebirth. In addition, Powers realizes that ''he'' was Lentz's experiment: would he or wouldn't he be able to teach a computer? Through the transformation he experiences, he is suddenly able to interact with the world, and he can write again.

==Characters ==
*Richard Powers: The central character of the novel, Powers shares certain traits and experiences with the novelist without being a complete copy of the author. 
*Lentz: Lentz is a sarcastic and brilliant researcher and scientist. He creates Helen in an effort to explore the workings of the human brain, to somehow discover how a mere biological accident could so destroy the woman he loved.
*Helen: Helen is the creation of Lentz and Richard; Lentz builds her, and Richard educates her. She is a net, spread out over innumerable computers, and she is taught using the [[literary canon]]. Only when she is exposed to reality—the murder, rage, etc. that characterize daily news and the human world—does she realize fully that she does not belong nor does she wish to belong in this world. One of the central arguments of the book comes from Helen and whether she has human emotions, or is simply simulating human emotion.

==Reviews and critiques==

[[Image:Gheorghe Sincai - Foto01.jpg|thumb|Gheorghe Șincai]]
'''Gheorghe Șincai''' ({{IPA-ro|ˈɡe̯orɡe ˈʃiŋkaj}}; February 28, 1754 – November 2, 1816) was an [[Romanians|ethnic Romanian]] [[Transylvania]]n historian, [[philologist]], translator, poet, and representative of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]-influenced [[Transylvanian School]].

As the director of [[Romanian Church United with Rome, Greek-Catholic|Greek Catholic]] education in Transylvania he brought a fundamental contribution to the process of promoting culture in rural environments. With [[Samuil Micu]] he composed the first written [[Romanian grammar|grammar]] of the [[Romanian language]]: ''Elementa linguae daco-romanae sive valachicae'' (''The elements of the [[Daco-Romanian|Daco-Roman]] or [[Vlachs|Wallachian]] language'') ([[Vienna]], 1780), in which he demonstrated the [[Origin of the Romanians|Latin origins]] of the Romanian language.

== Biography ==
Born in [[Râciu|Râciu de Câmpie]], now [[Mureș County]], he studied at [[Târgu-Mureș]], [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]], [[Bistrița]], [[Blaj]], Vienna and [[Rome]] (in the last two cities together with Samuil Micu, nephew of [[Bishop]] [[Inocențiu Micu-Klein]]).

He turned out to be a [[Polyglot (person)|polyglot]], thoroughly mastering [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Latin]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[French language|French]]. His knowledge and culture allowed him to occupy the function of librarian of the [[Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples]] in Rome, having permission to research any type of document. In the [[Papal States]], and later in [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] and in Vienna (the capital of the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg domains]]), he carried out research work in various libraries, copying and transcribing exactly any reference to the history of the Romanians.

Șincai assiduously worked to educate commoners, dedicating himself to a career in teaching, and contributing to the establishment of an impressive number of Greek-Catholic [[parochial school]]s (in all, over 300). In 1784 he was named general director of Romanian Uniate schools in all of Transylvania.

He translated and expanded the following basic textbooks for educational purposes: ''Abecedarul'' (''The Book of ABCs''), ''Gramatica'' (''Grammar''), ''Aritmetica'' (''Arithmetic'') and ''Catehismul'' (''The Catechism''), adapting or creating the terminology necessary for pupils to understand these. He proved himself to be a remarkable translator, rendering the [[Bible]] into Romanian (in 1789, under the name of ''The Blaj Bible'').

In 1794 Șincai came into direct conflict with Bishop [[Ioan Bob]]; he was thrown into the harsh prison of [[Aiud]], being followed and persecuted by the Habsburg authorities after his release in 1796.

In 1811 Șincai published a work of history, written in the form of annals and amply titled: ''Hronica românilor și a mai multor neamuri în cât au fost ele amestecate cu românii, cât lucrurile, întâmplările și faptele unora față de ale altora nu se pot scrie pre înțeles, din mai multe mii de autori, în cursul a treizeci și patru de ani culese'' (''The chronicle of the Romanians and of other peoples insofar as they were mixed with the Romanians, as the things, events and facts of the one regarding the other cannot be written as if everyone understands them, from several thousand authors, gathered over the course of thirty-four years'').

Șincai died at [[Svinica, Košice-okolie District|Szinye]], near [[Košice]] in present-day [[Slovakia]].

'''Globalism''' refers to various systems with scope beyond the merely international. The term is used by detractors of [[globalization]] such as [[right-wing populist]] movements. While primarily associated with [[world-system]]s, other things with global reach have also been so described.

Historically, it has been associated with international endeavours begun after [[World War II]], such as the [[United Nations]] and the [[European Union]], and also sometimes the later neo-liberal and neoconservative policies of "[[nation building]]" and military interventionism between the end of the [[Cold War]] in 1992 and the beginning of the [[War on Terror]] in 2001.

== Definitions and interpretations ==
[[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] defines ''globalism'', "at least in its more specific use, ... as the dominant ideology and [[subjectivity]] associated with different historically-dominant formations of global extension. The definition thus implies that there were pre-modern or traditional forms of globalism and globalization long before the driving force of capitalism sought to colonize every corner of the globe, for example, going back to the [[Roman Empire]] in the second century AD, and perhaps to the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] of the fifth-century BC."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|James|2006|p=22}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Manfred Steger distinguishes between different globalisms such as justice globalism, jihad globalism, and market globalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Steger|2008|p={{Page needed|date=October 2014}}}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Market globalism includes the ideology of [[neoliberalism]]. In some hands, the reduction of globalism to the single ideology of market globalism and neoliberalism has led to confusion. For example, in his 2005 book ''[[John Ralston Saul#The Collapse of Globalism|The Collapse of Globalism and the Reinvention of the World]]'', Canadian philosopher [[John Ralston Saul]] treated globalism as coterminous with neoliberalism and neoliberal globalization. He argued that, far from being an inevitable force, globalization is already breaking up into contradictory pieces and that citizens are reasserting their [[national interest]]s in both positive and destructive ways.

Alternatively, American political scientist [[Joseph Nye]], co-founder of the [[international relations theory]] of [[Neoliberalism in international relations|neoliberalism]], generalized the term to argue that ''globalism'' refers to any description and explanation of a world which is characterized by [[Network theory|networks of connections]] that span multi-continental distances; while [[globalization]] refers to the increase or decline in the degree of globalism.&lt;ref name="Nye 2002"&gt;{{Harvnb|Nye|2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This use of the term originated in, and continues to be used, in academic debates about the economic, social, and cultural developments that is described as globalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2486.2007.00670.x | volume=9 | title=The Third Wave in Globalization Theory | journal=International Studies Review | pages=173–196 | last1 = Martell | first1 = Luke}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used in a specific and narrow way to describe a position in the debate about the historical character of globalization (i.e. whether globalization is unprecedented or not).

During the election and presidency of United States president [[Donald Trump]], Trump and members of his administration used the term ''globalist'' on multiple occasions. Critics claimed that the administration used the term as an [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] [[Dog-whistle politics|"dog whistle"]] term referring to members of a [[New antisemitism#Anti-globalization movement|Jewish conspiracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/15/us/politics/globalism-right-trump.html|title=Globalism: A Far-Right Conspiracy Theory Buoyed by Trump|last=Stack|first=Liam|date=14 November 2016|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-11-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jta.org/2017/04/06/news-opinion/politics/stephen-bannon-called-jared-kushner-a-globalist-heres-why-the-term-makes-some-jews-uneasy|title=Stephen Bannon reportedly called Jared Kushner a ‘globalist.’ Here’s why the term makes some Jews uneasy.|last=Sales|first=Ben|date=6 April 2017|website=www.jta.org|publisher=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theweek.com/speedreads/759476/mick-mulvaney-throws-antisemitic-dog-whistle-into-fond-farewell-message-gary-cohn|title=Mick Mulvaney throws an 'anti-Semitic dog whistle' into his fond farewell message to Gary Cohn|last=Weber|first=Peter|date=7 March 2018|work=The Week|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/bannon-s-revenge-how-globalism-went-mainstream-ideology-far-right-ncna860221|title=Opinion {{!}} Brian Levin: How globalism became a dirty word in the Trump White House (and America)|last=Levin|first=Brian|date=1 April 2018|work=NBC News|access-date=2018-11-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-anti-semitic-globalist-koch-1052375|title=Donald Trump keeps calling adversaries "globalists," despite warnings it's anti-Semitic|last=Goodkind|first=Nicole|date=1 August 2018|work=Newsweek|access-date=2018-11-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the concept ==
The word itself came into widespread usage, first and foremost in the United States, from the early 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = ''globalism'' in American-English corpus, 1800–2000 | url = https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=globalism&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=17&amp;smoothing=0 | website = [[Google Ngram Viewer]] | accessdate = 24 October 2014 }}&lt;p&gt;Compare this with ''globalism'' in the [https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=globalism&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=18&amp;smoothing=0 British-English corpus], where its appearance is later and much more muted.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the period when US global power was at its peak: the country was the greatest economic power the world had ever known, with the greatest military machine in human history.&lt;ref name="Leffler 67"&gt;{{Harvnb|Leffler|2010|p=67}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[George F. Kennan|George Kennan]]'s [[Policy Planning Staff (United States)|Policy Planning Staff]] put it in February 1948: "[W]e have about 50% of the world's wealth but only 6.3% of its population. […] Our real task in the coming period is to devise a pattern of relationships which will permit us to maintain this position of disparity".&lt;ref name="DoS 524"&gt;{{Harvnb|DoS|1948|p=[http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1948v01p2&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1948v01p2.p0034 524]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; America's allies and foes in [[Eurasia]] were suffering the dreadful effects of World War II at this time.

In their position of unprecedented power, US planners formulated policies to shape the kind of postwar world they wanted, which, in economic terms, meant a globe-spanning capitalist order centered exclusively upon the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kolko|Kolko|1972|p=}}.&lt;p&gt;One American historian has gone as far as to describe this particular American version of globalism as ''visionary'', in order to highlight its potently ideological nature—indeed, "Washington's most impressive Cold War ideological achievement". Visionary globalism was a far-reaching conception of "American-centric state globalism using capitalism as a key to its global reach, integrating everything that it can into such an undertaking". And "integrating everything" crucially meant global ''economic'' integration, which had collapsed under the blows of World War I and the Great Depression. ({{Harvnb|Peck|2006|p=[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AA-jbmyfl54C&amp;pg=PA19 19], [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AA-jbmyfl54C&amp;pg=PA21 21]}})&lt;/ref&gt;

The first person in the United States to use the term ''[[economic integration]]'' in its modern sense (i.e. combining separate economies into larger economic regions) did so at this time: one John S. de Beers, an economist in the US Treasury Department, towards the end of 1941.&lt;ref name="Machlup 8"&gt;{{Harvnb|Machlup|1977|p=8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1948, ''economic integration'' was appearing in an increasing number of American documents and speeches.&lt;ref name="Machlup 11"&gt;{{Harvnb|Machlup|1977|p=11}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul G. Hoffman|Paul Hoffman]], then head of the [[Economic Cooperation Administration]], made the most marked use of the term in a 1949 speech to the [[Organisation for European Economic Co-operation]].&lt;ref name="Machlup 11" /&gt; As ''[[The New York Times]]'' put it,

{{Quote| Mr Hoffmann used the word 'integration' fifteen times or almost once to every hundred words of his speech. It is a word that rarely if ever has been used by European statesmen having to do with the Marshall Plan to describe what should happen to Europe's economies. It was remarked that no such term or goal was included in the commitments the European nations gave in agreeing to the Marshall Plan. Consequently it appeared to the Europeans that "integration" was an American doctrine that had been superimposed upon the mutual engagements made when the Marshall Plan began&amp;nbsp;…&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Machlup|1977|p=11}}; {{Harvnb|Veseth|2002|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8u99zWdAElUC&amp;pg=PA170 170–1]}}, where the ''Times'' article is reprinted.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

While ideologies of the global have a long history, globalism emerged as a dominant set of associated ideologies across the course of the late twentieth century. As these ideologies settled, and as various processes of [[globalization]] intensified, they contributed to the consolidation of a connecting global imaginary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Steger|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In their recent writings, [[Manfred Steger]] and [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] have theorized this process in terms of four levels of change: changing ideas, ideologies, imaginaries and ontologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|James|Steger|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
The '''Hasbro Comic Book Universe''' ('''HCBU''') is an [[American comic book]] franchise and [[shared universe]] created and published by [[IDW Publishing]], based on various properties of the [[toy]] company [[Hasbro]].

==Publication history==
Following the bankruptcy of [[Dreamwave Productions]] in 2005, IDW picked up the ''[[Transformers]]'' comic book license and hired veteran writer [[Simon Furman]] to craft a rebooted continuity based on the [[Transformers: Generation 1|Generation 1]] toy line, similar to what [[Marvel Comics]] did through [[Ultimate Marvel]].&lt;ref name="Transformers"/&gt;

In May 2008, IDW obtained the ''[[G.I. Joe]]'' comic book license from [[Devil's Due Publishing]].&lt;ref name="G.I. Joe"/&gt;

In 2016, IDW gained the rights of ''[[Rom (comics)|Rom]]'', ''[[Micronauts]]'', ''[[Action Man]]'' and ''[[M.A.S.K.]]'' That same year, IDW announced the [[Hasbro Reconstruction]] campaign, in order to converge those brands in the same continuity, starting with the crossover event ''[[Revolution (IDW Publishing)|Revolution]]''.&lt;ref name="Revolution"/&gt;

In 2017, IDW gained the rights of ''[[Visionaries: Knights of the Magical Light|Visionaries]]'', with most of its characters debuting after the crossover event ''[[First Strike (IDW Publishing)|First Strike]]''.&lt;ref name="Visionaries"/&gt;

In April 2018, IDW announced the Hasbro Comic Book Universe would conclude with the limited series ''[[Transformers: Unicron]]'' in November 2018.&lt;ref name="2018 ending"/&gt; In August 2018, IDW President Greg Goldstein announced a new reboot for various Hasbro-based comics for an unspecified date in 2019.&lt;ref name="2019 reboot"/&gt;

==Setting==

===Continuity===
IDW has never established a shared continuity between its own ''Transformers'' and ''G.I. Joe'' comics, even during the crossover event ''[[Infestation (comics)|Infestation]]'', when they both exist in separate universes, with other licensed franchises. While ''The Transformers'' has only participated in ''Infestation'', the miniseries ''[[The Transformers: Hearts of Steel]]'', also set in its own alternate timeline, has participated in ''[[Infestation 2]]''. On the other side,{{Clarify|what other side|date=October 2018}} ''G.I. Joe'' participated in both events.

Other brands exist within the HCBU too, e.g. ''[[Jem (TV series)|Jem and the Holograms]]'', ''[[Cluedo|Clue]]'' and ''[[Army Ants (toy line)|Army Ants]]'', but they didn't crossover during ''Revolution'' and ''First Strike'' due to reasons of tone. IDW's versions of ''[[My Little Pony (IDW Publishing)|My Little Pony]]'', ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons (IDW Publishing)|Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'', ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'' and ''[[Stretch Armstrong]]'' exist "outside" this universe entirely.

===Planets===
*'''[[Earth]]''': the planet where [[Humans|humans]] live, and various events happened.
*'''[[Cybertron]]''': the homeworld of the Transformers, whose habitants are considered as "Cybertronians". Various factions, including the [[Autobot|Autobots]] and the [[Decepticon|Decepticons]], have been in war for millions of years.
*'''Caminus''': a lost colony of the Transformer species. Its habitants are considered as "Camiens".
*'''Elonia''': the homeworld of [[Rom (comics)|Rom]] and the capitol of the Solstar Order, where most of its people are recruited to become [[Spaceknights|Space Knights]].
*'''Prysmos''': the former homeworld of the Visionaries, whose factions include the Spectral Knights and the Darkling Lords.

===Dimensions===
*The '''Dead Universe''': a universe where the D-Void exists. 
*'''Microspace''': a subatomic dimension where the [[Micronauts]] live.
*The '''Afterspark''': an [[astral plane]] that the Transformers denominate as its "[[afterlife]]".

===Timelines===
*The '''''Hearts of Steel'' timeline''': a timeline where the Transformers fought on Earth during the [[Industrial Revolution]].
*The '''Funcionist Universe''': a timeline where [[Megatron]] never existed, and a fascist council defined a sole function for each Transformer.

[[File:Port Moresby parliament building front, by Steve Shattuck.jpg|thumb|150px|left|The main entrance of the National Parliament building]]
'''Haus Tambaran''' is a [[Tok Pisin]] phrase which describes a type of traditional ancestral worship house in the [[East Sepik]] region of [[Papua New Guinea]]. The most visually recognizable forms are from the Maprik area, with a tall and elaborately decorated front entrance wall where the ridge pole slopes down low toward the back of the building and the roof follows this decline and often continues all the way to the ground. The Sepik people are renowned for their superb artistic ability in painting and carving, which is often exhibited in these religious structures.
[[File:High Commission of Papua New Guinea to Australia June 2016.jpg|thumb|right|High Commission of Papua New Guinea in Canberra]]
The front entrance of the modern [[National Parliament of Papua New Guinea|National Parliament]] building in [[Port Moresby]] is modelled on traditional ''haus tambaran'' architecture.  It can be viewed on [[Google Earth]] at Latitude: 9°25'41.69"S, Longitude: 147°11'33.45"E, and is depicted on the Papua New Guinea 50 [[Papua New Guinean kina|Kina note]]. The [[List of diplomatic missions of Papua New Guinea|High Commission of Papua New Guinea]] in [[Canberra]], [[Australia]], is also influenced by ''haus tambaran''. 
==The Tambaran Culture==
The male-dominated ''tambaran'' or ''tambaram'' culture uses the '''haus tambaran''' as a meeting-house and site for rituals and initiations.  It is also used in worship for the [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]] cult, the yam being the staple food for the [[Sepik]] people.  The women serve primarily as preparers of feasts, outsiders, and spectators.  The giant spirit, called [[Nggwal]] or Ngwalndu among the Abelam and Southern Arapesh peoples, is personified as noises that can be heard coming from the '''haus tambaran'''.  Nggwal is the primary ancestor deity, though other cultural heroes are also often
depicted in cultural and sacred arts.  Ngwalndu are large, flat painted faces that line the inside of the structure.  Though they are said to be representations of ancestral spirits, they can also be seen as stylized women's bodies.  However, it is important to note that [[painting]] is a sacred activity for the [[Sepik]] people, and the paintings of the Sepik people are taken very seriously.

==Reception==
The radio program Powertalk hosted by [[Lorraine Jacques-White]] called ''Hidden Colors'' "eye-opening and necessary."&lt;ref name="CBS Atlanta"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jacques-White |first1=Lorraine |title=America’s Got ‘Hidden Colors’|url=http://atlanta.cbslocal.com/2011/11/30/americas-got-hidden-colors/|publisher=[[CBS Atlanta]]|date=30 November 2011|accessdate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A review of ''[[Hidden Colors 2]]'' published in ''[[The Village Voice]]'' dismissed much of movie as conspiracy, complaining that Nasheed demonstrates "a seeming total inability to separate gibble-gabble from revealed truth, vital social concern from talk about Chemtrails and digressive subchapters with titles like 'The Hidden Truth About Santa Claus.'" The reviewer praised one contributor, [[Michelle Alexander]], who the ''Voice'' noted was the only woman in the film, saying that "Her well-reasoned discussion of the American penal system is compelling, but it's an embarrassment that she should be placed alongside the likes of Dr. Phil Valentine, a metaphysician whose malarkey about AIDS ("the so-called immunity system of the homosexual") is a low point, as is Umar Johnson's lionization of the late, unlamented Gaddafi and the odd nostalgia for segregation that runs throughout."&lt;ref name="Village Voice"&gt;{{cite web|last=Pinkerton|first=Nick|date=5 December 2012|title=Hidden Colors 2: The Triumph of Melanin|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2012-12-05/film/hidden-colors-2-film-review/|publisher=[[Village Voice]]|accessdate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[BET]]'' described the series as "one of the most successful Black independent documentaries".&lt;ref name="BET 1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zonyeé|first1=Dominique|title=Inside Tariq Nasheed's Hidden Colors 3|url=http://www.bet.com/news/national/2014/07/01/inside-tariq-nasheed-s-hidden-colors-3.html|accessdate=14 April 2015|publisher=[[BET]]|date=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Inez De Florio-Hansen 2016 2.jpg|thumb|Inez De Florio (2016)|300x300px]]
'''Inez De Florio''' (born 1943) is a German applied [[Linguistics|linguist]] and educational psychologist whose work focuses on science-oriented teaching and learning with particular reference to [[multilingualism]] and intercultural competence. Inez De Florio is a proponent of (qualitative and quantitative) empirical research. Her critical view of evidence-based education leads her to a particular focus on individual aspects of teachers, learners and the learning context.

In her introduction to ''Teaching and Learning English in the Digital Age'' (2018), she exemplifies how to implement digital media in foreign language classrooms. Furthermore, she shows that the rapidly increasing influences of digitization lead to more internationalized and globalized research-orientated teaching and learning approaches.

==Career==
After graduating from university, De Florio-Hansen taught foreign languages at the secondary school level as well as in adult education. She then worked at the education ministry in the German state of [[Hesse]] as adviser and teacher trainer for teachers of migrant students. She received her Ph.D in Literature from the [[RWTH Aachen University|University of Aachen]] in Germany in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;I. Hansen: Zwischen Epos und höfischem Roman. Die Frauengestalten im Trojaroman des Benoit de Sainte-Maure. Fink, München 1971. (Diss. Aachen 1970)&lt;/ref&gt; Her post-doctoral thesis (Habilitation) at [[Goethe University Frankfurt|Goethe University]] in [[Frankfurt]] was an empirical study of vocabulary acquisition by adult learners.&lt;ref&gt;I. De Florio-Hansen: Vom Reden über Wörter. Vokabelerklärungen im Italienischunterricht mit Erwachsenen. Narr, Tübingen 1994. (Habilitationsschrift)&lt;/ref&gt; After teaching at various German universities, she held a chair as Professor of [[Applied linguistics|Applied Linguistics]] at the [[University of Erfurt]], Germany, between 1994 and 1996. In 1996, she became a Professor in the department of Humanities at the [[University of Kassel]], Germany, retiring in 2008.

'''Infrastructure''' refers to the fundamental facilities and systems serving a country, city, or other area,&lt;ref&gt;. [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/infrastructure Infrastructure | Define Infrastructure at Dictionary.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; including the services and facilities necessary for its [[economy]] to function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = O'Sullivan | first = Arthur | authorlink = Arthur O'Sullivan (economist) | first2=Steven M. | last2=Sheffrin | authorlink2 = Steven M.

In general, it has also been defined as "the physical components of interrelated systems providing [[Commodity|commodities]] and services essential to enable, sustain, or enhance societal [[quality of life|living conditions]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fulmer|first=Jeffrey|title=What in the world is infrastructure?|journal=PEI Infrastructure Investor|year=2009|issue=July/August|pages=30–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ferry Building at night.jpg|thumb|upright=1.85|[[San Francisco Ferry Building]] at night]]
There are two general types of ways to view infrastructure, hard or soft. [[Hard infrastructure]] refers to the physical networks necessary for the functioning of a modern industry.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.laohamutuk.org/econ/14TLDPM/InfraCSOen.pdf|title=Civil Society Comments on Infrastructure Strategic Sector|last=Hamutak|first=Luta|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes roads, bridges, railways, etc. [[Soft infrastructure]] refers to all the institutions that maintain the [[Economy|economic]], health, social, and cultural standards of a country.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This includes educational programs, parks and recreational facilities, law enforcement agencies, and emergency services.

The word infrastructure has been used in English since 1887 and in French since 1875, originally meaning "The installations that form the basis for any operation or system".&lt;ref&gt;Online Etymology Dictionary. Douglas Harper, Historian. http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/infrastructure (accessed: April 24, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="opendb.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opendb.net/element/19099.php|title=Soft Infrastructure – Definition|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723233028/http://www.opendb.net/element/19099.php|archivedate=2011-07-23|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2015-03-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word was imported from [[French language|French]], where it means ''[[subgrade]]'', the native material underneath a constructed pavement or railway. The word is a combination of the [[Latin]] prefix "infra", meaning "below" and many of these constructions are underground, for example, tunnels, water and gas systems, and [[railways]]. The army use of the term achieved currency in the United States after the formation of [[NATO]] in the 1940s, and by 1970 was adopted by [[Urban planning|urban planners]] in its modern civilian sense.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Lewis [http://hakpaksak.wordpress.com/2008/09/22/the-etymology-of-infrastructure-and-the-infrastructure-of-the-internet/ The Ecology of Infrastructure and the Infrastructure of the Internet], blog ''Hag Pak Sak'', posted September 22, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classifications==
A 1987 [[United States National Research|US National Research Council]] panel adopted the term "public works infrastructure", referring to:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"...&amp;nbsp;both specific functional modes – highways, streets, roads, and bridges; mass transit; airports and airways; water supply and water resources; wastewater management; solid-waste treatment and disposal; electric power generation and transmission; telecommunications; and hazardous waste management – and the combined system these modal elements comprise.  A comprehension of infrastructure spans not only these public works facilities, but also the operating procedures, management practices, and development policies that interact together with societal demand and the physical world to facilitate the transport of people and goods, provision of water for drinking and a variety of other uses, safe disposal of society's waste products, provision of energy where it is needed, and transmission of information within and between communities."&lt;ref&gt;''Infrastructure for the 21st Century'', [[Washington, D.C.]]: National Academy Press, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The OECD also classifies communications as a part of infrastructure.&lt;ref name=OECD&gt;OECD [http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/12/25/43860714.pdf Economic Infrastructure. Common Reporting Standard (CRS) Codes] 2 pages, n.d.&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Society of Civil Engineers publish a "Infrastructure Report Card" which represents the organizations opinion on the condition of various infrastructure every 2–4 years.&lt;ref name=asce17&gt;[http://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/2017-Infrastructure-Report-Card.pdf 2017 Infrastructure Report], 112pp, American Society of Civil Engineers, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of |2017}} they grade 16 categories, namely Aviation, Bridges, Dams, Drinking Water, Energy, Hazardous Waste, Inland Waterways, Levees, Parks &amp; Recreation, Ports, Rail, Roads, Schools, Solid Waste, Transit and Wastewater.&lt;ref name=asce17/&gt;{{rp|4}}

=== Personal ===
A way to embody personal infrastructure is to think of it in term of human capital.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/12990/1/Survey_infra_def.pdf|title=Public infrastructure: definition, classification and measurement issues|last=Torrisi|first=Gianpiero|date=January 2009|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human capital]] is defined by the Encyclopedia Britannica as “intangible collective resources possessed by individuals and groups within a given population".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/human-capital|title=Human capital {{!}} economics|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of personal infrastructure is to determine the quality of the economic agents’ values. This results in three major tasks: the task of economic proxies’ in the economic process (teachers, unskilled and qualified labor, etc.); the importance of personal infrastructure for an individual (short and long-term consumption of education); and the social relevance of personal infrastructure.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Institutional ===
Institutional infrastructure branches from the term "economic constitution". According to Gianpiero Torrisi, Institutional infrastructure is the object of economic and legal policy. It compromises the grown and sets norms.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It refers to the degree of actual equal treatment of equal economic data and determines the framework within which economic agents may formulate their own economic plans and carry them out in co-operation with others.

=== Material ===
Material infrastructure is defined as “those immobile, non-circulating capital goods that essentially contribute to the production of infrastructure goods and services needed to satisfy basic physical and social requirements of economic agents".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; There are two distinct qualities of material infrastructures: 1) Fulfillment of social needs and 2) Mass production. The first characteristic deals with the basic needs of human life. The second characteristic is the non-availability of infrastructure goods and services.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Economic ===
According to the business dictionary, economic infrastructure can be defined as "internal facilities of a country that make business activity possible, such as communication, transportation and distribution networks, financial institutions and markets, and energy supply systems".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/economic-infrastructure.html|title=What is economic infrastructure? definition and meaning|website=BusinessDictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic infrastructure support productive activities and events. This includes roads, highways, bridges, airports, water distribution networks, sewer systems, irrigation plants, etc.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Social ===
Social infrastructure can be broadly defined as the construction and maintenance of facilities that support social services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aberdeen-asset.fr/en/thinkingaloud/investment-clarity/what-is-social-infrastructure|title=What is social infrastructure? {{!}} ThinkingAloudUK {{!}} Thinking Aloud|website=www.aberdeen-asset.fr|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social infrastructures are created to increase social comfort and act on economic activity. These being schools, parks and playgrounds, structures for public safety, waste disposal plants, hospitals, sports area, etc.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Core ===
Core assets provide essential services and have monopolistic characteristics.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncpers.org/files/Conference%20Docs/Public%20Safety/2014%20Handouts/Robert%20Pease_Tuesday.pdf|title=Infrastructure Investment Opportunities for Public Safety Plans|last=Pease|first=Bob|date=October 28, 2014|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investors seeking core infrastructure look for five different characteristics: Income, Low volatility of returns, Diversification, Inflation Protection, and Long-term liability matching.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Core Infrastructure incorporates all the main types of infrastructure. For instance; roads, highways, railways, public transportation, water and gas supply, etc.

=== Basic ===
Basic infrastructure refers to main railways, roads, canals, harbors and docks, the electromagnetic telegraph, drainage, dikes, and land reclamation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It consist of the more well-known features of infrastructure. The things in the world we come across everyday (buildings, roads, docks, etc).

=== Complementary ===
Complementary infrastructure refers to things like light railways, tramways, gas/electricity/water supply, etc.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; To complement something, means to bring to perfection or complete it. So, complementary infrastructure deals with the little parts of the engineering world the brings more life. The lights on the sidewalks, the landscaping around buildings, the benches for pedestrians to rest, etc.

==Related concepts==
The term ''infrastructure'' may be confused with the following overlapping or related concepts.

[[Land improvement]] and [[land development]] are general terms that in some contexts may include infrastructure, but in the context of a discussion of infrastructure would refer only to smaller scale systems or works that are not included in infrastructure, because they are typically limited to a single [[Real property|parcel of land]], and are owned and operated by the land owner. For example, an irrigation canal that serves a region or district would be included with infrastructure, but the private irrigation systems on individual land parcels would be considered land improvements, not infrastructure. Service connections to municipal service and public utility networks would also be considered land improvements, not infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;''Land improvement'', Online BusinessDictionary.com, http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/land-development.html (accessed January 31, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Land development'', Online BusinessDictionary.com, http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/land-development.html (accessed January 31, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

The term [[public works]] includes government-owned and operated infrastructure as well as public buildings, such as schools and court houses. Public works generally refers to physical assets needed to deliver [[public services]]. Public services include both infrastructure and services generally provided by government.

==Ownership and financing==
{{Main|Infrastructure and economics}}
Infrastructure may be owned and managed by [[government]]s or by private companies, such as sole [[public utility]] or [[rail transport|railway]] companies. Generally, most roads, major airports and other ports, water distribution systems, and sewage networks are publicly owned, whereas most energy and telecommunications networks are privately owned.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Publicly owned infrastructure may be paid for from taxes, tolls, or metered user fees, whereas private infrastructure is generally paid for by metered user fees.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Major investment projects are generally financed by the issuance of long-term [[Bond (finance)|bonds]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Government-owned and operated infrastructure may be developed and operated in the [[private sector]] or in [[public-private partnership]]s, in addition to in the [[public sector]]. {{as of|2008}} in the United States for example, public spending on infrastructure has varied between 2.3% and 3.6% of GDP since 1950.&lt;ref&gt;The New York Times, [https://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2008/11/19/business/economy/19leonhardt_graphic.ready.html "Money for Public Projects"], November 19, 2008 (accessed January 26, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[List of financial institutions that invest in infrastructure|financial institutions invest in infrastructure]].

==Types==

===Engineering and construction===
[[Engineers]] generally limit the term "infrastructure" to describe [[fixed assets]] that are in the form of a large network; in other words, [[hard infrastructure]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Efforts to devise more generic definitions of infrastructures have typically referred to the network aspects of most of the structures, and to the accumulated value of investments in the networks as assets.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} One such definition from 1998 defined infrastructure as the network of assets "where the system as a whole is intended to be maintained indefinitely at a specified standard of service by the continuing replacement and refurbishment of its components".&lt;ref&gt;Association of Local Government Engineers New Zealand: "Infrastructure Asset Management Manual", June 1998. Edition 1.1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil defense and economic development===
{{see also|Civil defense by country}}
[[Civil defense]] planners and [[Development economics|developmental economists]] generally refer to both hard and soft infrastructure, including [[public services]] such as [[schools]] and [[hospitals]], [[emergency services]] such as police and fire fighting, and basic [[financial services]]. The notion of [[infrastructure-based development]] combining long-term infrastructure investments by government agencies at central and regional levels with [[public private partnership]]s has proven popular among economists in Asia (notably [[Singapore]] and [[China]]), mainland Europe, and Latin America.

===Military===
[[Military]] infrastructure is the buildings and permanent installations necessary for the support of military forces, whether they are stationed in bases, being deployed or engaged in operations. For example, barracks, headquarters, airfields, communications facilities, stores of military equipment, port installations, and maintenance stations.&lt;ref&gt;D.O.D. Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms, 2001 (rev. 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Green===
{{main|Green infrastructure}}
Green infrastructure (or blue-green infrastructure) highlights the importance of the natural environment in decisions about [[land use planning]].&lt;ref&gt;The Conservation Fund, Arlington, VA. [http://www.greeninfrastructure.net/ "Green Infrastructure".] Accessed 2009-10-06.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maryland Department of Natural Resources, Annapolis, MD. [http://www.dnr.state.md.us/greenways/gi/gidoc/gidoc.html ''Maryland's Green Infrastructure Assessment: A Comprehensive Strategy for Land Conservation and Restoration.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309184735/http://www.dnr.state.md.us/greenways/gi/gidoc/gidoc.html |date=2008-03-09 }} May 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular there is an emphasis on the "life support" functions provided by a network of natural [[ecosystem]]s, with an emphasis on [[interconnectivity]] to support long-term [[sustainability]]. Examples include clean [[water]] and healthy soils, as well as the more [[Anthropocentrism|anthropocentric]] functions such as [[recreation]] and providing shade and shelter in and around towns and cities. The concept can be extended to apply to the management of [[stormwater]] runoff at the local level through the use of natural systems, or engineered systems that mimic natural systems, to treat polluted [[urban runoff|runoff]].&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Washington, D.C., et al., [http://www.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/gi_intentstatement.pdf ''Green Infrastructure Statement of Intent.''] 2007-04-19. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512021555/http://www.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/gi_intentstatement.pdf |date=May 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EPA et al. [http://www.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/gi_action_strategy.pdf "Managing Wet Weather with Green Infrastructure: Action Strategy 2008."] January 2008. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512021449/http://www.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/gi_action_strategy.pdf |date=May 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marxism===
In [[Marxism]], the term "infrastructure" is sometimes used as a synonym for "base" in the [[dialectic]] synthetic pair ''[[base and superstructure]]''. However, the Marxist notion of "base" is broader than the non-Marxist use of the term "infrastructure", and some soft infrastructure, such as laws, governance, regulations, and standards, would be considered by Marxists to be part of the superstructure, not the base.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anthrobase.com/Dic/eng/pers/marx_karl.htm Marx, Karl Heinrich (1818–1883)], accessed January 9, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communications===
Communications infrastructure is the informal and formal channels of communication, [[political]] and [[social network]]s, or beliefs held by members of particular groups, as well as [[information technology]], software development tools. Still underlying these more conceptual uses is the idea that infrastructure provides organizing structure and support for the system or organization it serves, whether it is a city, a nation, a corporation, or a collection of people with common interests. Examples include [[IT infrastructure]], research infrastructure, terrorist infrastructure, employment infrastructure and tourism infrastructure.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==In the developing world==
According to researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]], the lack of infrastructure in many [[developing countries]] represents one of the most significant limitations to [[economic growth]] and achievement of the [[Millennium Development Goals|Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)]]. Infrastructure investments and maintenance can be very expensive, especially in such areas as landlocked, rural and sparsely populated countries in [[Africa]]. It has been argued that infrastructure investments contributed to more than half of Africa's improved growth performance between 1990 and 2005, and increased investment is necessary to maintain growth and tackle [[poverty]]. The returns to investment in infrastructure are very significant, with on average thirty to forty percent returns for [[telecommunications]] (ICT) investments, over forty percent for [[electricity]] generation, and eighty percent for [[roads]].&lt;ref name=ODI1&gt;Christian K.M. Kingombe 2011. [https://www.odi.org/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/publications-opinion-files/6311.pdf Mapping the new infrastructure financing landscape]. London: [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regional differences===
The demand for infrastructure, both by consumers and by companies is much higher than the amount invested.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; There are severe constraints on the supply side of the provision of infrastructure in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Peter McCawley (2010), '[http://apel.anu.edu.au/pdf/24-1/Articles/mccawley.pdf Infrastructure Policy in Developing countries'], ''Asian-Pacific Economic Literature'', 24(1), May. See also Asian-Pacific Economic Literature Policy Brief No 19, May 2010, on '[http://apel.anu.edu.au/pdf/24-1/Policy/mccawley.pdf Infrastructure policy in developing countries in Asia'].&lt;/ref&gt; The infrastructure financing gap between what is invested in [[Asia-Pacific]] (around US$48 billion) and what is needed (US$228 billion) is around US$180 billion every year.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

In [[Latin America]], three percent of [[GDP]] (around US$71 billion) would need to be invested in infrastructure in order to satisfy demand, yet in 2005, for example, only around two percent was invested leaving a financing gap of approximately US$24 billion.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

In Africa, in order to reach the seven percent annual growth calculated to be required to meet the MDGs by 2015 would require infrastructure investments of about fifteen percent of GDP, or around US$93 billion a year. In [[fragile state]]s, over thirty-seven percent of GDP would be required.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

===Sources of funding===
The source of financing varies significantly across sectors. Some sectors are dominated by government spending, others by [[development aid|overseas development aid (ODA)]], and yet others by private investors.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;  In California, infrastructure financing districts are established by local governments to pay for physical facilities and services within a specified area by using property tax increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=California Land Use and Planning Law|last=Barclay|first=Cecily|last2=Gray|first2=Matthew|publisher=Solano Press|year=2016|isbn=978-1938166112|edition=35|location=California|pages=585}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to facilitate investment of the private sector in developing countries' infrastructure markets, it is necessary to design risk-allocation mechanisms more carefully, given the higher risks of their markets.&lt;ref&gt;Koh, Jae Myong (2018) ''Green Infrastructure Financing: Institutional Investors, PPPs and Bankable Projects'', Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;

The spending money that comes from the government is less than it used to be. Compared to the global GDP percentages, The United States is tied for second-to-last place, with an average percentage of 2.4%. This means that the government spends less money on repairing old infrastructure and or on infrastructure as a whole. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/10/20/large-economic-gains-can-come-from-mundane-improvements-in-policy|title=Large economic gains can come from mundane improvements in policy|work=The Economist|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], governments spend around US$9.4 billion out of a total of US$24.9 billion. In [[irrigation]], governments represent almost all spending. In [[transport]] and [[energy]] a majority of investment is government spending. In [[Information and communication technologies|ICT]] and [[water supply]] and [[sanitation]], the private sector represents the majority of capital expenditure. Overall, between them aid, the private sector, and non-[[OECD]] financiers exceed government spending. The private sector spending alone equals state capital expenditure, though the majority is focused on ICT infrastructure investments. External financing increased in the 2000s (decade) and in Africa alone external infrastructure investments increased from US$7 billion in 2002 to US$27 billion in 2009. [[China]], in particular, has emerged as an important investor.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

'''Jacques Le Goff''' (1 January 1924 – 1 April 2014) was a French historian and prolific author specializing in the [[Middle Ages]], particularly the 12th and 13th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Agence France-Presse in Paris |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/01/influential-french-historian-jacques-le-goff-dies |title=Influential medieval historian Jacques Le Goff dies aged 90 &amp;#124; World news |publisher=theguardian.com |date=2014-04-01 |accessdate=2014-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Le Goff championed the [[Annales School]] movement, which emphasizes long-term trends over the topics of politics, diplomacy, and war that dominated 19th century historical research. From 1972 to 1977, he was the head of the [[École des hautes études en sciences sociales]] (EHESS). He was a leading figure of [[Nouvelle histoire|New History]], related to [[cultural history]]. Le Goff argued that the Middle Ages formed a [[civilization]] of its own, distinct from both [[Classical Antiquity]] and the [[modern world]].

==Life and writings==
A prolific medievalist of international renown, Le Goff was sometimes considered the principal heir and continuator of the movement known as [[Annales School]] (''École des Annales''), founded by his intellectual mentor [[Marc Bloch]]. Le Goff succeeded [[Fernand Braudel]] in 1972 at the head of the [[École des hautes études en sciences sociales]] (EHESS) and was succeeded by [[François Furet]] in 1977. Along with [[Pierre Nora]], he was one of the leading figures of [[Nouvelle histoire|New History]] (''Nouvelle histoire'') in the 1970s.

Subsequently, he dedicated himself to studies on the [[historical anthropology]] of [[Western Europe]] during medieval times. He was well known for contesting the very name of "Middle Ages" and its chronology, highlighting achievements of this period and variations inside it, in particular by attracting attention to the [[Renaissance of the 12th century]].

In his 1984 book ''The Birth of Purgatory'', he argued that the conception of [[purgatory]] as a physical place, rather than merely as a state, dates to the 12th century, the heyday of medieval otherworld-journey narratives such as the Irish [[Visio Tnugdali]], and of pilgrims' tales about [[St Patrick's Purgatory]], a cavelike entrance to purgatory on a remote island in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-260349/purgatory purgatory], page 4 of 6&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[agnostic]], Le Goff presented an [[equidistant]] position between the detractors and the apologists of the Middle Ages.

Among his numerous works were two widely accepted biographies, a [[genre]] that his school did not usually favor: the life of [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]], the only [[List of French monarchs|King of France]] to be [[canonization|canonized]], and the life of [[Francis of Assisi|Saint Francis of Assisi]], the [[Italy|Italian]] mendicant friar.

In October 2000 he received an Honorary Doctor of Philosophy degree from the [[University of Pavia]]. He was also nominated Academician of [[Studium, Accademia di Casale e del Monferrato per l’Arte, la Letteratura, la Storia, le Scienze e le Varie Umanità|Studium, Accademia di Casale e del Monferrato]], Italy.

In 2004, he received the [[Heineken Prizes|Dr. A.H. Heineken Prize]] for History from the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knaw.nl/cfdata/news/pressrelease_detail.cfm?nieuws__id=245 Press release at KNAW website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060618192750/http://www.knaw.nl/cfdata/news/pressrelease_detail.cfm?nieuws__id=245 |date=2006-06-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Józef Rufin Wybicki''' ({{IPA-pl|juˈzɛf vɨˈbʲit͡skʲi}}; 29 September 1747 – 19 March 1822) was a [[Poland|Polish]] jurist, [[Polish poet|poet]], political and military activist. He is best remembered as the author of "[[Mazurek Dabrowskiego|Mazurek Dąbrowskiego]]" ({{Lang-en|"Dąbrowski's [[Mazurka]]"}}), which in 1927 was adopted as the Polish [[national anthem]].

==Life==
Wybicki was born in [[Będomin]], in the region of [[Pomerania]] in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]].&lt;ref name="unigd"/&gt; His family was Pomeranian [[szlachta|nobility]].&lt;ref name="Bartov2007"/&gt;

He finished a [[Jesuit]] school, and in his youth was a junior court official.&lt;ref name="Bartov2007"/&gt; Wybicki was elected a deputy to the [[Repnin Sejm]], the session of Polish parliament in 1767, on the eve of the [[First Partition of Poland]].&lt;ref name=unigd/&gt; Subsequently he joined the insurgency known as the [[Confederation of Bar]] (1768–1772), aimed at opposing the Russian influence and king [[Stanisław August Poniatowski]].&lt;ref name=unigd/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bartov2007"/&gt; He was one of the advisors (''konsyliarz'') of the Confederacy, acting as a diplomat.&lt;ref name="Michalika1994"/&gt; After the failure of the uprising, he spent some time in the Netherlands, studying law at [[Leiden University]].&lt;ref name="Bartov2007"/&gt;

[[Image:DabrowskiWybickiNapoleon.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Gen. Jan Henryk Dąbrowski and Józef Wybicki meet Emperor Napoleon in Berlin in 1806]]
Returning to Poland, in the 1770s and 1780s he was associated with the [[Commission of National Education]].&lt;ref name=unigd/&gt; He supported King [[Stanisław August Poniatowski]] and his proposed reforms.&lt;ref name=unigd/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bartov2007"/&gt; He helped draft the liberal [[Zamoyski Codex]] of laws of the late 1770s.&lt;ref name="Butterwick2011"/&gt; He was a [[Patriotic Party]] activist during the [[Great Sejm]] (1788–92) – though he was not one of its first deputies, during much of that time staying at his estate, writing and staging operas.&lt;ref name=unigd/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bartov2007"/&gt; He did, however, participate in the Great Sejm's deliberations, beginning in 1791.&lt;ref name="Butterwick2011"/&gt; In 1792, in the aftermath of the [[Polish–Russian War of 1792]], like many of Poniatowski's supporters, he joined the [[Targowica Confederation]].&lt;ref name="Zajewski1989"/&gt;

He participated in the [[Kościuszko Uprising]] (1794)&lt;ref name=unigd/&gt; and was a member of the Military Section of the [[Provisional Council of the Duchy of Masovia]].&lt;ref name="Kociszewski1982"/&gt; After the failure of this insurrection he moved to France.&lt;ref name="Bartov2007"/&gt;

[[Image:Wybicki.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Józef Wybicki]]
He was a close friend of both [[Tadeusz Kościuszko]] and [[Jan Henryk Dąbrowski]].&lt;ref name="Nance2008"/&gt; With Dąbrowski he organized the [[Polish Legions in Italy]], serving under [[Napoleon Bonaparte]].&lt;ref name=unigd/&gt; In 1797, while in [[Reggio Emilia]], Italy, he wrote ''[[Mazurek Dabrowskiego|Mazurek Dąbrowskiego]]'' (Dąbrowski's [[Mazurka|Mazurek]]).&lt;ref name=unigd/&gt; In 1806 he helped Dąbrowski organize the [[Greater Poland Uprising (1806)|Greater Poland Uprising]].&lt;ref name="Bartov2007"/&gt;

After the creation of the [[Duchy of Warsaw]] in 1807, he held a number of positions in its Department of Justice, and continued working for it after the Duchy's transformation into [[Congress Poland]].&lt;ref name="Bartov2007"/&gt; In 1817 he became president of the Supreme Court of Congress Poland.&lt;ref name="Lechicka1962"/&gt;

He died on 10 March 1822 in [[Manieczki]], in [[Śrem|Schrimm]], then part of the [[Grand Duchy of Posen]], Prussia.&lt;ref name=unigd/&gt;

==Works==
Wybicki was a writer, journalist and a poet.&lt;ref name=unigd/&gt; He wrote political-themed poems, plays and political treaties advocating reforms in Poland in the 1770s and 1780s.&lt;ref name=unigd/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bartov2007"/&gt; His works of that time analyzed the Polish political system, the concepts of liberty, and advocated for more rights for the peasantry.&lt;ref name="Grzeskowiak-Krwawicz2012"/&gt; He would also publish more political brochures in the 1800s, advocating for liberal reforms in the Duchy of Warsaw.&lt;ref name="Bartov2007"/&gt;

''[[Mazurek Dabrowskiego|Mazurek Dąbrowskiego]]'' (Dąbrowski's [[Mazurka]]) remains Wybicki's most famous creation.&lt;ref name="Bartov2007"/&gt; It has been regarded as an unofficial [[national anthem]] since the [[November Uprising]] of 1831.&lt;ref name=unigd/&gt; In 1927 the Mazurka was officially adopted as the [[Poland|Polish]] [[national anthem]] by the Polish parliament ([[Sejm]]).&lt;ref name="Bartov2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ministerstwa"/&gt;

The '''kukri''' or '''khukuri''' ({{lang-ne|खुकुरी}} ''khukuri'') is a knife, originating from the [[Indian subcontinent]], associated with the [[Nepali language|Nepali speaking]] [[Gurkha]]s of [[India]] and [[Nepal]]. The knife has an inwardly curved blade, similar to a [[machete]], used as both a tool and as a weapon in Nepal and India. Traditionally, it was, and in many cases still is, the basic utility knife of the [[Gurkha]]. It is a characteristic weapon of the [[Nepalese Army]], the [[Royal Gurkha Rifles]] of the [[British Army]], the [[Assam Rifles]], the [[Assam Regiment]], the [[The Garhwal Rifles|Garhwal Rifles]], the [[Gorkha regiments (India)|Gorkha regiments]] of the [[Indian Army]], and of all [[Gurkha]] regiments throughout the world, so much so that some English-speakers refer to the weapon as a "Gurkha blade" or "Gurkha knife". The kukri often appears in [[Nepalese people|Nepalese]] and [[Indian Gorkha]] heraldry and is used in many traditional rituals such as wedding ceremonies.

The ''kukri'', ''khukri'', and ''kukkri'' spellings are of Indian origin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Illustrated Oxford Dictionary |publisher=Dorling Kindersley |year=1998 |location=Great Britain |isbn=140532029-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; the original [[Nepali language|Nepali]] form being ''khukuri''.

==History==
[[File:Gambhir Singh Rayamajhi.jpg|thumb|230px|left|Colonel Gambhir Singh Rayamajhi Kshetri, a [[Gorkhali]] Commander armed with a Khukuri in his left hand and [[Talwar]] on his right]]
[[File:Kalu Pande.jpg|thumb|Gorkhali Chief Minister ([[Kaji (Nepal)|Kaji]]) &amp; Army head [[Kalu Pande]] wearing a Khukuri on his chest]]

Researchers trace the origins of the blade back to the domestic [[sickle]] and the prehistoric bent stick used for hunting and later in hand-to-hand combat.&lt;ref name=Burton&gt;{{cite book |title=The Book of the Sword |author=[[Richard Francis Burton]] |publisher=Dover |year=1987 |location=London |isbn=0-486-25434-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar implements have existed in several forms throughout [[South Asia]] and were used both as weapons and as tools, such as for sacrificial rituals.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} Burton (1884) writes that the [[British Museum]] housed a large kukri-like falchion inscribed with writing in [[Pali]]. Among the oldest existing kukri are those belonging to Drabya Shah (c. 1559), housed in the National Museum of Nepal in [[Kathmandu]].

The kukri came to be known to the Western world when the [[East India Company]] came into conflict with the growing [[Gorkha Kingdom]], culminating in the [[Gurkha War]] of 1814–1816.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} It gained literary attention in the 1897 novel ''[[Dracula]]'' by Irish author [[Bram Stoker]]. Despite the popular image of Dracula having a stake driven through his heart at the conclusion of a climactic battle between Dracula's bodyguards and the heroes, Mina's narrative describes his throat being sliced through by Jonathan Harker's kukri and his heart pierced by Quincey Morris's [[Bowie knife]].&lt;ref&gt;Stoker, Dacre and Ian Holt (2009). ''Dracula the Un-Dead''. Penguin Group. p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt;

All Gurkha troops are issued with two kukri, a Service No.1 (ceremonial) and a Service No.2 (exercise); in modern times members of the [[Brigade of Gurkhas]] receive training in its use. The weapon gained fame in the Gurkha War and its continued use through both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] enhanced its reputation among both Allied troops and enemy forces. Its acclaim was demonstrated in North Africa by one unit's situation report. It reads: "Enemy losses: ten killed, ours nil. Ammunition expenditure nil."&lt;ref&gt;Reagan, Geoffrey (1992). ''Military Anecdotes''. Guinness Publishing. {{ISBN|0-85112-519-0}}. p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere during the Second World War, the kukri was purchased and used by other British, Commonwealth and US troops training in India, including the [[Chindits]] and [[Merrill's Marauders]].{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} The notion of the Gurkha with his kukri carried on through to the [[Falklands War]].

On 2 September 2010, [[Bishnu Shrestha]], a retired Indian Army Gurkha soldier, alone and armed only with a khukri, defeated thirty bandits who attacked a passenger train he was on in India. He was reported to have killed three of the bandits, wounded eight more and forced the rest of the band to flee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.myrepublica.com/portal/index.php?action=news_details&amp;news_id=27100 "Lone Nepali Gorkha who subdued 40 train robbers"], ''[[República (Nepalese newspaper)|República]]'', 13 Jan 2011. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131222133313/http://archives.myrepublica.com/portal/index.php?action=news_details&amp;news_id=27100 |date=22 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A contemporaneous report in the ''[[Times of India]]'', that includes an interview with Shrestha, indicates he was less successful.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata-/Soldier-takes-on-dacoits-on-trainGang-Of-30/articleshow/6488820.cms "Soldier takes on dacoits on train; Gang Of 30"], ''[[Times of India]]'', Times News Network, 4 Sep 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
[[File:Kukri, karda &amp; chakmak.jpg|thumb|left| A Kukri (Top) with the traditional Karda (middle) and Chakmak (bottom). The Karda and Chakmak are used as a utility knife and a sharpening tool respectively ]]
The kukri is designed primarily for chopping. The shape varies a great deal from being quite straight to highly curved with angled or smooth spines. There are substantial variations in dimensions and blade thickness depending on intended tasks as well as the region of origin and the smith that produced it. As a general guide the spines vary from 5–10&amp;nbsp;mm at the handle, and can taper to 2&amp;nbsp;mm by the point while the blade lengths can vary from 26–38&amp;nbsp;cm for general use.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

A kukri designed for general purpose is commonly 40–45&amp;nbsp;cm (16–18&amp;nbsp;in) in overall length and weighs approximately 450–900&amp;nbsp;[[gram]]s (1–2&amp;nbsp;lbs). Larger examples are impractical for everyday use and are rarely found except in collections or as ceremonial weapons. Smaller ones are of more limited utility, but very easy to carry.

Another factor that affects its weight and balance is the construction of the blade. To reduce weight while keeping strength the blade might be hollow forged, or a [[Fuller (weapon)|fuller]] is created. Kukris are made with several different types of fuller including: ''tin chira'' (triple fuller), ''dui chira'' (double fuller), ''angkhola'' (single fuller), or basic non-tapered spines with a large beveled edge.

Kukri blades usually have a notch (''karda'', ''kauda'', ''kaudi'', ''kaura'', or ''cho'') at the base of the blade. Various reasons are given for this, both practical and ceremonial: that it makes blood and sap drop off the blade rather than running onto the handle and thereby prevent the handle from becoming slippery;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Episode 3 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/i/p00jvf2t/ |accessdate=8 August 2013 |series=In the Highest Tradition |last=Wooldridge |first=Ian |authorlink=Ian Wooldridge |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC Two]] |airdate=20 November 1989 |time=13 minutes 25 seconds |quote=Here if I may describe, you see a little pattern there, which some people say that it has got some religious significance, but I doubt very much. In fact, that is just so that when you have blood on the kukri, it just sort of naturally drips there, it doesn't get onto your hand and starts clogging up and that is what it is for, that little nick there.}}&lt;/ref&gt; that it delineates the end of the blade whilst sharpening; that it is a symbol representing a cows' foot, or [[Shiva]]; that it can catch another blade, or kukri in combat. The notch may also represent the teats of a cow, a reminder that the kukri should not be used to kill a cow, an animal revered and worshipped by Hindus. {{citation needed|reason=Relief cut for differential tempered edge|date=July 2016}} The notch may also be used as a catch, to hold tight against a belt, or to bite onto twine to be suspended.{{original research inline|date=August 2016}}

The handles are most often made of [[hardwood]] or [[water buffalo]] horn, but [[ivory]], bone, and metal handles have also been produced. The handle quite often has a flared butt that allows better retention in draw cuts and chopping. Most handles have metal bolsters and butt plates which are generally made of [[brass]] or steel.

The traditional handle attachment in Nepal is the partial [[Tang (tools)|tang]], although the more modern versions have the stick tang which has become popular.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The full tang is mainly used on some military models, but has not caught-on in Nepal itself.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

The kukri typically comes in either a decorated wooden scabbard or one which is wrapped in leather. Traditionally, the scabbard also holds two smaller blades: an unsharpened ''chakmak'' to burnish the blade, and another accessory blade called a ''karda''. Some older style scabbards include a pouch for carrying flint or dry tinder.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

==Manufacture==
[[File:Gurkha IOC 3.jpg|thumb|200px|A Gurkha officer of the [[Gurkha Contingent]], [[Singapore Police Force]] patrols around [[Raffles City]] during the [[117th IOC Session]]. He wears the distinctively tilted [[Hat Terrai Gurkha]], the kukri can be seen attached to the back of his belt]]
The Biswakarma [[Kami (caste)]] are the traditional inheritors of the art of kukri-making.&lt;ref name="kami"&gt;[http://www.himalayan-imports.com/kami.html "Welcome to the world of the Nepalese Kami"]&lt;/ref&gt; Modern kukri blades are often forged from [[spring steel]], sometimes collected from recycled [[Suspension (vehicle)|truck suspension units]].&lt;ref name="kami"/&gt; The [[tang (tools)|tang]] of the blade usually extends all the way through to the end of the handle;{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} the small portion of the tang that projects through the end of the handle is hammered flat to secure the blade. Kukri blades have a hard, tempered edge and a softer spine. This enables them to maintain a sharp edge, yet tolerate impacts.

Kukri handles, usually made from hardwood or buffalo horn, are often fastened with a kind of tree sap called ''laha'' (also known as "Himalayan epoxy"). With a wood or horn handle, the tang may be heated and burned into the handle to ensure a tight fit, since only the section of handle which touches the blade is burned away. In more modern kukri, handles of cast [[aluminium]] or [[brass]] are press-fitted to the tang; as the hot metal cools it shrinks, locking onto the blade. Some kukri (such as the ones made by contractors for the modern Indian Army), have a very wide tang with handle slabs fastened on by two or more rivets, commonly called a [[full tang]] (''panawal'') configuration.

Traditional profiling of the blade edge is performed by a two-man team; one spins a grinding wheel forwards and backwards by means of a rope wound several times around an axle while the sharpener applies the blade. The wheel is made by hand from fine river sand bound by ''laha'', the same adhesive used to affix the handle to the blade. Routine sharpening is traditionally accomplished by passing a ''chakmak'' over the edge in a manner similar to that used by chefs to [[sharpening steel|steel]] their knives.

Kukri scabbards are usually made of wood or metal with an animal skin or metal or wood covering. The leather work is often done by a ''[[Sirki|Sarki]]''.

==Uses==
[[File:1-4th Gurkhas at kit inspection showing kukris (Photo 24-98).jpg|thumb|Gurkhas at kit inspection showing kukri in France during World War I]]

===Weaponry===
The kukri is effective as a chopping weapon, due to its weight, and slashing weapon, because the curved shape creates a "wedge" effect which causes the blade to cut effectively and deeper. Because the blade bends towards the opponent, the user need not angle the wrist while executing a chopping motion.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Unlike a straight-edged sword, the center of mass combined with the angle of the blade allow the kukri to slice as it chops.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} The edge slides across the target's surface while the center of mass maintains momentum as the blade moves through the target's cross-section. This gives the kukri a penetrative force disproportional to its length. The design enables the user to inflict deep wounds and to penetrate bone.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Utility===
While most famed from use in the military, the kukri is the most commonly used multipurpose tool in the fields and homes in Nepal. Its use has varied from building, clearing, chopping firewood, digging, slaughtering animals for food, cutting meat and vegetables, skinning animals, and opening cans. Its use as a general farm and household tool disproves the often stated "taboo" that the weapon cannot be sheathed "until it has drawn blood".{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

The kukri is versatile. It can function as a smaller knife by using the narrower part of the blade, closest to the handle. The heavier and wider end of the blade, towards the tip, functions as an axe or a small shovel.

==Classification==
Kukris can be broadly classified into two types: Eastern and Western. The Eastern blades are originate and named according to the towns and villages of [[Eastern Nepal]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.everestblade.com/categories.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Eastern Khukuris are Angkhola Khukuri, Bhojpure Khukuri, Chainpure Khukuri, Cheetlange (Chitlange) Khukuri, Chirwa (Chiruwa) Khukuri, Dhankute Khukuri, Ganjawla Khukuri, Panawala Khukuri, Sirupate Khukuri translates as ''Siru'' grass leaf like.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nepalkhukurihouse.com/default/18-inch-sirupate-kukri.html|title= A 18 inch Sirupate Khukuri|website=nepalkhukurihouse.com|accessdate=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sirupate is also known as one of Chainpure Khukuri. &lt;ref&gt;https://nepalkhukurihouse.com/default/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kukrimart.com&lt;/ref&gt; Khukuris made in locations like [[Chainpur, Kosi|Chainpur]], [[Bhojpur, Nepal|Bhojpur]], and [[Dhankuta]] in Eastern Nepal are excellent and ornate knives.&lt;ref&gt;Visit Nepal '98: By The Official Travel Manual of Visit Nepal '98 VNY'98 Secretariat, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;
Western blades are generally more broad. Occasionally the Western style is called ''Budhuna'', (referring to a fish with a large head), or ''baspate'' (bamboo leaf) which refers to blades just outside the proportions of the normal ''Sirupate'' blade. Despite the classification of Eastern and Western, both styles of kukri appear to be used in all areas of Nepal.

There is Khukuri named after Gorkhali General [[Amar Singh Thapa]] called '''Amar Singh Thapa Khukuri'''. This Khukuri is modeled on the real Khukuri used by the Gorkhali General.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bladeforums.com/threads/wednesday-evening-with-amar-singh-thapa-khukuri.674412/|title= Wednesday evening with Amar Singh Thapa Khukuri|website=bladeforums.com|accessdate=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The real Khukuri used by Amar Singh Thapa is archived at [[National Museum of Nepal]] and is more curvy in nature than other traditionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pinterest.com/pin/7881368076018402/|title= Weapons (Kukri, Katar, Kora) of Amar Singh Thapa in National Museum of Nepal, Kathmandu |website=pinterest.com|accessdate=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edith Cooper.jpg|thumb|Edith Cooper]]
'''Michael Field''' was a [[pseudonym]] used for the [[poetry]] and [[verse drama]] of '''Katharine Harris Bradley''' (27 October 1846 – 26 September 1914)  and her niece and ward '''Edith Emma Cooper''' (12 January 1862 – 13 December 1913). As Field they wrote around 40 works together, and a long journal ''Works and Days''. Their intention was to keep the pen-name secret, but it became public knowledge, not long after they had confided in their friend [[Robert Browning]].

==Biographies==

Katharine Bradley was born on 27 October 1846 in [[Birmingham]], [[England]], the daughter of Charles Bradley, a tobacco manufacturer, and of Emma (née Harris). Her grandfather, also Charles Bradley (1785–1845), was a prominent follower and financial backer of prophetess [[Joanna Southcott]] and her self-styled successor [[John Ward (prophet)|John "Zion" Ward]].&lt;ref&gt;Latham, Jackie E. M. ''[https://www.jstor.org/pss/4289834 The Bradleys of Birmingham: The Unorthodox family of Michael Field] (History workshop journal, issue 55).&lt;/ref&gt; She was educated at the [[Collège de France]] and [[Newnham College, Cambridge]].

Bradley's elder sister, Emma, married James Robert Cooper in 1860, and went to live in [[Kenilworth]], where their daughter, Edith Emma Cooper was born on 12 January 1862. Emma Cooper became an invalid for life after the birth of her second daughter, Amy, and Katharine Bradley, being her sister, stepped in to become the legal guardian of her niece Edith Cooper.&lt;ref&gt;Sturgeon, 1922, pp. 14-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradley was for a time involved with [[John Ruskin|Ruskin]]'s utopian project. She published first under the pseudonym '''Arran Leigh''', a nod to [[Elizabeth Barrett]]. Edith adopted the name '''Isla Leigh''' for their first joint publication, ''Bellerophôn''.

From the late 1870s, when Edith was at [[University College, Bristol]], they agreed to live together and were, over the next 40 years, [[lesbian]] lovers,&lt;ref name="bristow"&gt;{{citation |title=Sexual Sameness: Textual Differences in Lesbian and Gay Writing |editor-first=Joseph |editor-last=Bristow |year=1992 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-06937-8 |chapter='Poets and Lovers Evermore': The poetry and journals of Michael Field |first=Chris |last=White}}&lt;/ref&gt; and co-authors. Their first joint publication as Michael Field was "Callirhöe and Fair Rosamund" in 1884. They had financial independence: Bradley's father Charles Bradley had been in the [[tobacco industry]] in [[Birmingham]].

They were Aestheticists, strongly influenced by the thoughts of Walter Pater. They developed a large circle of literary friends and contacts;  in particular painters and life partners [[Charles Ricketts]] and [[Charles Haslewood Shannon|Charles Shannon]], near whom they settled in [[London Borough of Richmond upon Thames|Richmond]], London. Robert Browning was also a close friend of theirs, and they knew and admired Oscar Wilde, whose death they bitterly mourned. While they were always well connected, the early critical success was not sustained (this is often attributed to the joint identity of Field becoming known). They knew many of the aesthetic movement of the 1890s, including [[Walter Pater]], [[Vernon Lee]], [[J. A. Symonds]] and also [[Bernard Berenson]]. [[William Rothenstein]] was a friend. In 1899 the death of Edith's father enabled them to buy their own house as evidence of their "close marriage", although Edith saw her father's death as retribution for their lifestyle. Edith led the way in establishing the couple as active Catholics.&lt;ref name=blain/&gt;

[[File:Katherine Harris Bradley &amp; Edith Emma Cooper (2).jpg|thumb|Katherine Harris Bradley &amp; Edith Emma Cooper]]

They wrote a number of passionate love poems to each other, and their name Michael Field was their way of declaring their inseparable oneness. Friends referred to them as the Fields, the Michaels or the Michael Fields. They had a range of pet names for each other. They also were passionately devoted to their pets, in particular a dog named Whym Chow, for whom they wrote a book of poems named after him.

Their joint journal starts with an account of Bradley's passion for [[Alfred Gérente]], an artist in [[stained glass]] and brother of [[Henri Gérente]], who was of an English background but worked mostly in France. It goes on to document Michael Field as a figure, amongst 'his' literary counterparts, and their lives together. When Whym Chow died in 1906, the emotional pattern of the relationship was disturbed; both women became [[Roman Catholic]] converts in 1907. Their religious inclinations are reflected in their later works, where their earlier writing is influenced by classical and Renaissance culture, in its pagan aspects particularly, [[Sappho]] as understood by the late Victorians, and perhaps [[Walter Savage Landor]].

Edith died of [[cancer]] in 1913, as did Katherine less than a year later. They were buried together at [[St Mary Magdalen Roman Catholic Church Mortlake]]. A now-lost marble tomb was erected in 1926. Their extensive diaries are stored in the British Library,&lt;ref name=blain&gt;Virginia H. Blain, ‘Bradley, Katharine Harris (1846–1914)’, [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]], Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Sept 2011 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/38348, accessed 26 Dec 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; and have been digitised and made available by the Victorian Lives and Letters Consortium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tundra.csd.sc.edu/vllc/field_diaries|title=The Online Diaries of "Michael Field" - The Victorian Lives and Letters Consortium|website=tundra.csd.sc.edu|access-date=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A much-edited selection from the journals, which were two dozen annual volumes in [[ledger]]s with aspects of [[scrapbooking|scrapbooks]] combined with a self-conscious literary style of composition, was prepared by [[T. Sturge Moore]], a friend through his mother Marie.

The '''National Liaison Committee for International Students in Australia''' ('''NLC''') was first formed in 1986 in an attempt to combat the Australian Government's introduction of the full-fee paying international students program.  Formerly a member of the [[National Union of Students (Australia)]], it has been ejected and its practices are considered controversial by a number of education industry associations. As of 2013, NLC, along with their sub group Overseas Student Association (OSA), have been banned from NSW after warning issued by NSW Premier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Warning against two student groups  |author=Julie Hare |date=13 November 2013 |journal= The Australian |url= http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/warning-against-two-student-groups/story-e6frgcjx-1226758505586 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisational history==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2009}}
NLC was formed in 1986, in response to the need for a unified body to voice international student's concerns especially over the introduction of the user-pay system for international students tuition fee by the Australian government. NLC was the peak representative body in Australia for all international students.  It stood for quality education, equitable welfare and multicultural understanding. Until 2009, it was recognised as the national representative body for international students by the Australia Federal Government. In 2009 the leadership of the NLC was expelled from the NUS.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} This in turn caused the NLC to lose recognition from peak education bodies (Universities Australia, ACPET, TAFE Directors Australia, and English Australia), Federal and State Governments and education providers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

NLC was officially incorporated in 1998 and its official legal name is National Liaison Committee for International Students in Australia Inc. Until 2009 the NLC worked in conjunction with [[National Union of Students of Australia]] and fulfilled its role as a peak representative organisation by taking the role of the International Students Committee of the [[National Union of Students of Australia]] (NUS).

The NLC had developed strong relationships with many stakeholders in the international education industry. These included, Australian Education International (AEI), [[IDP Education Australia]], State Government Education Departments, International Student Adviser Network Australia (ISANA), all four OSHC providers, [[National Tertiary Education Union]], [[Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee]], [[IELTS]], [[English Australia]], and most international education departments throughout Australian Universities.  Since 2009 many of these relationships have been fundamentally compromised.

The NLC had helped to achieve changes in the international education industry over between 1986 and 2009. These included the deregulation of the overseas student health cover industry, contributions to the ESOS Act reviews in 2006, 2000, 2004 and in 1996, changes to immigration regulations, such as extensions of sunset clauses on permanent residency changes. In 2008 the NLC was currently working on re introducing public transport concession for international students in NSW and Victoria and ensuring quality education.

The NLC had 42 affiliated university campus international student organisations, from 31 public and 2 private universities, and drew its membership primarily from university students, claiming a representation of 303,000 international students in Australia.  It contributed to Federal and State Government inquiries and processes into changing and improving international education in Australia.

However, as of 2013, New South Wales Premier along with New South Wales Police Department, 11 universities and NSW Museum issues a warning regards NLC and it's OSA activities. They have been accused of collecting personal data from student which is consider illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Premier and unis issue warning over overseas students group |author=Josephine Tovey |date=7 November 2013 |journal= The Sydney Morning Herald |url= http://www.smh.com.au/national/education/premier-and-unis-issue-warning-over-overseas-students-group-20131107-2x4i4.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their current website have been taken down as a result.

== Stance ==

The NLC has been critical of increasing exploitation of full fee paying international students, describing the current international student issues as having begun in 1986 with the introduction of full fees, and claiming that students are exploited in abusive visa schemes which do not result in real educational benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Minister plans ban on shaky visa deals|author=Yuko Narushima|date=22 October 2008|journal=The Sydney Morning Herald|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/minister-plans-ban-on-shaky-visa-deals/2008/10/21/1224351253384.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The NLC has also criticised the formation of student ghettos due to the poor integration of international and domestic students in Universities and the lack of welfare support for international students causing the development of in-group peer reliance structures.  According to Eric Pang in 2008, then the president of the NLC, many international students had claimed "There's not much international students can learn from Australia in terms of culture, or in terms of English. After all, the standard of English of Australian students is not high anyway."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |journal=The Sydney Morning Herald |url= http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/welcome-to-nation-of-university-ghettos/2008/07/22/1216492448152.html |title= Welcome to nation of university ghettos |authors=Sushi Das and Erik Jensen |date= 23 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009===

In 2009 the NLC was accused of bullying, was forcibly disaffiliated from the NUS, and recognition has been refused by the University of New South Wales and the University of Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Overseas student group at centre of bullying claims |author=Heath Gilmore |date=9 May 2009 |url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/overseas-student-group-at-centre-of-bullying-claims-20090508-axzz.html | journal=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later in 2009 other international student groups, the Australian Federation of International Students and the Federation of Indian Students of Australia claimed that the NLC had made legal threats regarding their operation in Victoria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Victorian names dispute for international student bodies |author=Andrew Trounson |date=17 June 2009 |journal= The Australian |url= http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/victorian-names-dispute-for-international-student-bodies/story-e6frg6n6-1225736507036 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2013===

In 2013, NSW Premier issued warning regards NLC and its sub group OSA, stating that they have been involved taking private data from student illegally. NSW Office of Fair Trading has also launched an investigation about the bogus "SafetyCard" issued by NLC, about the non-existent discount in public services and extra protection from police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Master Shang’s bogus student group blackballed after Crikey probe |author=Andrew Crook |date=8 November 2013 |journal= Crikey |url= http://www.crikey.com.au/2013/11/08/master-shangs-bogus-student-group-blackballed-after-crikey-probe/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, their website, which contain the infringed NSW government logo and NSW Police logo have been taken down.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7537">In [[film theory]], the term '''oneiric''' ({{IPAc-en|oʊ|ˈ|n|aɪ|r|ɪ|k}}; "pertaining to [[dream]]s") refers to the depiction of dream-like states or to the use of the metaphor of a dream or the dream-state in the analysis of a film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bacher|first1=Hans P|title=Film Analysis|journal=Dream Worlds|date=1 January 2008|pages=12–27|doi=10.1016/b978-0-240-52093-3.50005-7|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-240-52093-3.50005-7|publisher=Focal Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sparshott|first1=F.E.|title=Vision and Dream in the Cinema|journal=Philosophic Exchange: Annual Proceedings|date=1971|volume=1|page=116|url=http://digitalcommons.brockport.edu/phil_ex/vol2/iss1/13/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eber/&gt;{{rp|3-4}}

==History==
Early film theorists such as [[Ricciotto Canudo]] (1879–1923) and [[Jean Epstein]] (1897–1953) argued that films had a dreamlike quality. [[Raymond Bellour]] and [[Guy Rosolato]] have made psychoanalytical analogies between films and the dream state, claiming films as having a "latent" content that can be [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalyzed]] as if it were a dream. {{ill|Lydia Marinelli|de}} states that before the 1930s, psychoanalysts "primarily attempted to apply the interpretative schemata found in [[Sigmund Freud]]'s ''[[Interpretation of Dreams]]'' to films."{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Author Douglas Fowler surmises that "images arising from dreams are the well spring of all our efforts to give enduring form and meaning to the urgencies within," seeing this as the reason why "the deep structure of human narrative is conceived in dreams and the genesis of all myth is dreams."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fowler|first1=Douglas|title=The Kingdom of Dreams in Literature and Film: Selected Papers from the Tenth Annual Florida State University Conference on Literature and Film|date=1986|publisher=University Presses of Florida|location=Tallahassee|isbn=0813008638|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author Robert Eberwein describes the filmic experience as the merging of a viewer's consciousness with the projected consciousness of the screen's subject, a process whereby the viewer's prior experiences with dreaming "help to create a sense of oneness" with cinema, causing the gap between viewer and what is being viewed to narrow.&lt;ref name=eber&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eberwein|first1=Robert T.|title=Film &amp; the Dream Screen: A Sleep and a Forgetting|date=1984|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, N.J.|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/33536|isbn=0691066191}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|53}} Under this theory, no matter what is being shown on the screen — whether the literal representation of a character dreaming, or the fictional characters of a story going on about their fictional lives — the very process of viewing film itself "replicates activities associated with the oneiric experience."&lt;ref name=eber/&gt;{{rp|81-82}}

Films and dreams are also connected in psychological analysis by examining the relationship between the cinema screening process and the spectator (who is perceived as passive). [[Roland Barthes]], a French literary critic and [[Semiotics|semiotician]], described film spectators as being in a "para-oneiric" state, feeling "sleepy and drowsy as if they had just woken up" when a film ends. Similarly, the French [[Surrealism|surrealist]] [[André Breton]] argues that film viewers enter a state between being "awake and falling asleep", what French filmmaker [[René Clair]] called a "dreamlike state". [[Edgar Morin]]'s ''Le cinéma ou l'homme imaginaire'' (1956) and [[Jean Mitry]]'s first volume of ''Esthétique et psychologie du cinéma'' (1963) also discuss the connection between films and the dream state.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

==Filmmakers==
Filmmakers described as using oneiric or dreamlike elements in their films include [[Sergei Parajanov]] (e.g., ''[[Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors]]''), [[David Lynch]] (e.g., ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lentzner|first1=Jay R.|last2=Ross|first2=Donald R.|title=The Dreams That Blister Sleep: Latent Content and Cinematic Form in Mulholland Drive|journal=American Imago|date=26 April 2005|volume=62|issue=1|pages=120|doi=10.1353/aim.2005.0016|url=https://doi.org/10.1353/aim.2005.0016|issn=1085-7931}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrei Tarkovsky]] (e.g. ''[[Andrei Rublev (film)|Andrei Rublev]]'' and ''[[Solaris (1972 film)|Solaris]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Petric|first1=Vlada|title=Tarkovsky's Dream Imagery|journal=Film Quarterly|date=December 1989|volume=43|issue=2|pages=28–34|doi=10.1525/fq.1989.43.2.04a00040|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1525/fq.1989.43.2.04a00040}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stan Brakhage]] (e.g., ''[[Dog Star Man]]''), [[Michelangelo Antonioni]] (e.g. ''[[The Passenger (1975 film)|The Passenger]]''), [[Jaromil Jireš]] (e.g., ''[[Valerie and Her Week of Wonders (film)|Valerie and Her Week of Wonders]]''), [[Krzysztof Kieslowski]] (e.g. ''[[The Double Life of Veronique]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Santilli|first1=Paul C.|title=Cinema and Subjectivity in Krzysztof Kieslowski|journal=Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism|date=December 2006|volume=64|issue=1|pages=147–156|doi=10.1111/j.0021-8529.2006.00236.x|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0021-8529.2006.00236.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Federico Fellini]] (e.g., ''[[Amarcord]]''), [[Ingmar Bergman]] (e.g., ''[[Wild Strawberries (film)|Wild Strawberries]]''), [[Jean Cocteau]] (e.g., ''[[Orphic Trilogy]]''), [[Raúl Ruiz (director)|Raúl Ruiz]] (e.g., ''[[City of Pirates]]''), [[Edgar G.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11737">'''Pragmatic language impairment''' ('''PLI'''), or '''social''' ('''pragmatic''') '''communication disorder''' ('''SCD'''), is an impairment in understanding [[Pragmatics|pragmatic]] aspects of language. This type of impairment was previously called '''semantic-pragmatic disorder''' ('''SPD'''). People with these impairments have special challenges with the semantic aspect of language (the meaning of what is being said) and the pragmatics of language (using language appropriately in social situations). It is assumed that those with autism have difficulty with "the meaning of what is being said" due to different ways of responding to social situations.

PLI is now a diagnosis in [[DSM-5]], and is called social (pragmatic) communication disorder. Communication problems are also part of the [[autism spectrum disorders]] (ASD); however, the latter [[Autism spectrum#Characteristics|also show]] a restricted pattern of behavior, according to behavioral psychology. The diagnosis SCD can only be given if ASD has been ruled out.&lt;ref name=DSM5&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/Social%20Communication%20Disorder%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf||title=Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder|accessdate=September 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
Individuals with PLI have particular trouble understanding the meaning of what others are saying, and they are challenged in using language appropriately to get their needs met and interact with others. Children with the disorder often exhibit:

* delayed language development
* aphasic speech (such as word search pauses, [[jargoning]], word order errors, word category errors, [[verb tense]] errors)     
* Stuttering or cluttering speech
* Repeating words or phrases
* difficulty with pronouns or pronoun reversal  
* difficulty understanding questions 
* difficulty understanding choices and making decisions.  
* difficulty following conversations or stories. Conversations are "off-topic" or "one-sided".
* difficulty extracting the key points from a conversation or story; they tend to get lost in the details
* difficulty with verb tenses
* difficulty explaining or describing an event
* tendency to be concrete or prefer facts to stories
* difficulty understanding satire or jokes 
* difficulty understanding contextual cues 
* difficulty in reading comprehension
* difficulty with reading [[body language]]
* difficulty in making and maintaining friendships and relationships because of delayed language development.
* difficulty in distinguishing offensive remarks
* difficulty with organizational skills

According to Bishop and Norbury (2002), children with semantic pragmatic disorder have fluent, complex and clearly articulated expressive language but exhibit problems with the way their language is used. These children typically are verbose. However, they usually have problems understanding and producing connected discourse, instead giving conversational responses that are socially inappropriate, tangential and/or stereotyped. They often develop obsessional interests but not as strong or eccentric as people with [[autism spectrum disorder]]s.

The current view, therefore, is that the disorder has more to do with communication and information processing than language. For example, children with semantic pragmatic disorder will often fail to grasp the central meaning or saliency of events. This then leads to an excessive preference for routine and "sameness" (seen in autism spectrum disorders), as PLI children struggle to generalize and grasp the meaning of situations that are new; it also means that more difficulties occur in a stimulating environment than in a one-to-one setting.

A further problem caused by PLI is the assumption of literal communication. This would mean that obvious, concrete instructions are clearly understood and carried out, whereas simple but non-literal expressions such as jokes, sarcasm and general social chatting are difficult and can lead to misinterpretation. Lies are also a confusing concept to children with PLI as it involves knowing what the speaker is thinking, intending and truly meaning beyond a literal interpretation.
===Relationship to autism===
Prior to the DSM-5, SCD was not differentiated from a diagnosis of autism. However, there was a large number of cases of children experiencing difficulties with pragmatics that did not meet the criteria for ASD. The differential diagnosis of SCD allows practitioners to account for social and communication difficulties that occur at a lesser degree than in children with ASD.&lt;ref&gt;Mash, Eric. (2016). ''Abnormal Child Psychology, 6e, 6th Edition''. [VitalSource Bookshelf Online]. Retrieved fromhttps://cengagebrain.vitalsource.com/#/books/9781305445765/&lt;/ref&gt;

There is debate over the relationship between semantic pragmatic disorder and autistic disorder as the clinical profile of semantic pragmatic disorder is often  seen in children with [[high-functioning autism]].&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, D. V.M. and Norbury, C. F. (2002). "Exploring the borderlands of autistic disorder and specific language impairment: a study using standardised diagnostic instruments" ''Journal of Child Psychiatry, 43: 917–929. doi: 10.1111/1469-7610.00114''. [Wiley Online Library]. Retrieved from http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1469-7610.00114/full&lt;/ref&gt;

Pragmatic language impairment is distinguished from autism by the absence of any history (current or past) of restricted/repetitive patterns of interest or behavior in PLI.&lt;ref name="DSM 5"&gt;{{cite book | title = Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition | chapter = Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder, 315.39 (F80.89) | editor = American Psychiatric Association | year = 2013 | publisher = American Psychiatric Publishing | pages = 47–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnostic ==

The [[DSM-5]] categorizes SCD as a [[communication disorder]] within the domain of [[neurodevelopmental disorders]], listed alongside other disorders of speech and language which typically manifest in early childhood. The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for social (pragmatic) communication disorder is as follows:
&lt;blockquote style="background-color:none;margin-right:0em;margin-left:0em;border-left:solid 8px #ccc;padding:0.5em"&gt;
*A. Persistent difficulties in the social use of verbal and nonverbal communication as manifested by all of the following:
# Deficits in using communication for social purposes, such as greeting and sharing information, in a manner that is appropriate for the social context.
# Impairment of the ability to change communication to match context or the needs of the listener, such as speaking differently in a classroom than on a playground, talking differently to a child than to an adult, and avoiding use of overly formal language.
# Difficulties following rules for conversation and storytelling, such as taking turns in conversation, rephrasing when misunderstood, and knowing how to use verbal and nonverbal signals to regulate interaction.
# Difficulties understanding what is not explicitly stated (e.g., making inferences) and nonliteral or ambiguous meanings of language (e.g., idioms, humor, metaphors, multiple meanings that depend on the context for interpretation).
*B. The deficits result in functional limitations in effective communication, social participation, social relationships, academic achievement, or occupational performance, individually or in combination.
*C. The onset of symptoms is in the early developmental period (but deficits may not become fully manifest until social communication demands exceed limited capacities).
*D. The symptoms are not attributable to another medical or neurological condition or to low abilities in the domains of word structure and grammar, and are not better explained by autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder), global developmental delay, or another mental disorder.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Related disorders==
[[Hyperlexia]] is a similar but different disorder where main characteristics are an above-average ability to read with a below-average ability to understand spoken and/or written language. Joanne Volden wrote an article in 2002 comparing the linguistic weaknesses of children with [[nonverbal learning disability]] to PLI.&lt;ref name="volden"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asha.org/Publications/leader/2002/021022/f021022.htm |title=Nonverbal learning disability: What the SLP needs to know |last=Volden |first=Joanne |date=October 22, 2002 |work=The ASHA Leader |publisher=American Speech-Language-Hearing Association |accessdate=February 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== History ==
In 1983, [[Isabelle Rapin|Rapin]] and Allen suggested the term "semantic pragmatic disorder" to describe the communicative behavior of children who presented traits such as pathological talkativeness, deficient access to vocabulary and discourse comprehension, atypical choice of terms and inappropriate conversational skills.&lt;ref name=Rapin&gt;Rapin I., and D. Allen (1983). "Developmental language disorders: Nosologic considerations", in U. Kirk (ed.), ''Neuropsychology of language, reading, and, spelling'' (pp. 155–184). Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; They referred to a group of children who presented with mild [[autism|autistic]] features and specific semantic pragmatic language problems. More recently, the term "pragmatic language impairment" (PLI) has been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Conti-Ramsden G. |author2=N. Botting |title=Classification of children with specific language impairment: longitudinal considerations |journal=J. Speech Lang. Hear. Res. |volume=42 |issue=5 |pages=1195–204 |year=1999 |pmid=10515515 |doi=10.1044/jslhr.4205.1195}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, D. V. M. (2000), "Pragmatic language impairment: A correlate of SLI, a distinct subgroup, or part of the autistic continuum?" In D. V. M. Bishop and L. B. Leonard (eds.), ''Speech and Language Impairments in Children: Causes, characteristics, intervention and outcome'' (pp. 99–113). Hove, UK: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rapin and Allen's definition has been expanded and refined by therapists who include communication disorders that involve difficulty in understanding the meaning of words, grammar, syntax, prosody, eye gaze, body language, gestures, or social context. While autistic children exhibit pragmatic language impairment, this type of communication disorder can also be found in individuals with other types of disorders including [[auditory processing disorder]]s, [[neuropathies]], [[encephalopathies]] and certain genetic disorders.&lt;ref name=Bishop2002&gt;{{Cite journal

'''Reality tunnel''' is a theory that, with a subconscious set of mental filters formed from [[belief]]s and [[experience]]s, every individual interprets the same world differently, hence "[[Truth]] is in the eye of the beholder".  It is similar to the idea of [[representative realism]], and was coined by [[Timothy Leary]] (1920–1996). It was further expanded on by [[Robert Anton Wilson]] (1932-2007), who wrote about the idea extensively in his 1983 book ''Prometheus Rising''.

Wilson and Leary co-wrote a chapter in Leary's 1988 book ''Neuropolitique'' (a revised edition of the 1977 book ''Neuropolitics''), in which they explained further: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The gene-pool politics which monitor power struggles among terrestrial humanity are transcended in this info-world, i.e. seen as static, artificial charades. One is neither coercively manipulated into another's territorial reality nor forced to struggle against it with reciprocal game-playing (the usual soap opera dramatics). One simply elects, consciously, whether or not to share the other's reality tunnel.&lt;ref&gt;Neuropolitique, New Falcon Publications, 2006, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

==Considerations==
&lt;blockquote&gt;Every kind of ignorance in the world all results from not realizing that our perceptions are gambles. We believe what we see and then we believe our interpretation of it, we don't even know we are making an interpretation most of the time. We think this is reality. – Robert Anton Wilson&lt;ref name="youtube video"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=Robert|title=Real Reality|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZBDUJ0yiVg|accessdate=23 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ambud-raw&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=Robert Anton|title=Maybe Logic: The Lives And Ideas Of Robert Anton Wilson -- Illustrated Interview|url=http://www.american-buddha.com/maybelogictranscript.htm|publisher=American Buddha|year=2003|accessdate=23 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The idea does not necessarily imply that there is no [[objective truth]]; rather that our access to it is mediated through our senses, experience, [[Classical conditioning|conditioning]], prior beliefs, and other non-objective factors. The implied individual world each person occupies is said to be their reality tunnel. The term can also apply to groups of people united by beliefs: we can speak of the [[fundamentalist Christian]] reality tunnel or the [[metaphysical naturalism|ontological naturalist]] reality tunnel.

A parallel can be seen in the psychological concept of [[confirmation bias]]—the human tendency to notice and assign significance to observations that confirm existing beliefs, while filtering out or rationalizing away observations that do not fit with prior beliefs and expectations. This helps to explain why reality tunnels are usually transparent to their inhabitants. While it seems most people take their beliefs to correspond to the "one true objective reality", Robert Anton Wilson emphasizes that each person's reality tunnel is their own artistic creation, whether they realize it or not.

Wilson—like [[John C. Lilly]] and many others—relates that through various techniques one can break down old reality tunnels and impose new reality tunnels by removing old filters and replacing them with new ones, with new perspectives on reality—at will. This is attempted through various processes of deprogramming using [[neuro-linguistic programming]], [[cybernetics]], [[hypnosis]], [[biofeedback]] devices, [[meditation]], controlled use of [[hallucinogens]], and forcibly acting out other reality tunnels. Thus, it is believed one's reality tunnel can be widened to take full advantage of human potential and experience reality on more positive levels. Robert Anton Wilson's ''[[Prometheus Rising]]''&lt;ref&gt;Robert Anton Wilson, ''Prometheus Rising''. New Falcon Publications, 1983, 262pp. {{ISBN|1-56184-056-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; is (among other things) a guidebook to the exploration of various reality tunnels.

Harvard sociologist [[Talcott Parsons]] used the word ''gloss'' to describe how the mind perceives reality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nagualism.com/carlos-castaneda-interview-psychology-today.html Sam Keen, Castaneda interview, Psychology Today, Dec. 1972]&lt;/ref&gt; We are taught, he theorised, how to "put the world together" by others who subscribe to a [[consensus reality]]. "The curious world of Talcott Parsons was where society was a system, {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} interactive subsystems adhering to a certain set of unwritten rules."&lt;ref&gt;Roger A. Salerno, ''Beyond the enlightenment: lives and thoughts of social theorists''. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2004, p.179.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, The Social System. New York: The Free Press, 1951&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[meme]] is another source of ''gloss''; it is "transmitted from one mind to another through speech, gestures, rituals, or other imitable phenomena." Because we're social creatures, there are reasons for us to adopt some [[social currency|social currencies]].

In line with [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] thought,&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Alper, ''The "God" Part of the Brain: A Scientific Interpretation of Human Spirituality and God''. Sourcebooks, Inc., 2008, p.50f.&lt;br/&gt;
"The human mind, Kant contended, must be born, not as a clean slate, but with built-in 'modes of perception' that work to organize the multitude of information our sense organs are constantly imparting to us. Without such built-in processing mechanisms, we would experience reality as an unintelligible jumble of [[empirical evidence|sense experience]]s."
&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the work of [[Norwood Russell Hanson]], studies have indeed shown&lt;ref&gt;[http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/how_do_brains_filter_data/ Seed, ''How do brains filter data?'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "nspc"&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn14096-party-chat-brain-filter-discovered.html?DCMP=ILC-hmts&amp;nsref=news7_head_dn14096 New Scientist: ''{{'}}Party chat' brain filter discovered'']

This "filtering" is largely unconscious and may be influenced—more-or-less in many ways, in societies and in individuals—by biology,&lt;ref&gt;Example, [[autism]]. Autistics are unable "to understand the social communication of neurotypicals", and "Three- to five-year-old autistic children are less likely to exhibit social understanding, approach others spontaneously, imitate and respond to emotions...."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/exchange/node/1792 Bryn Mawr: Serendip, ''Through Different Eyes: How People with Autism Experience the World'']

An everyday example of such filtering is our ability to follow a conversation, or read, without being distracted by surrounding conversations, once called the [[cocktail party effect]].&lt;ref name= "nspc"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cherry, E.

In his 1986 book ''Waking Up'',&lt;ref&gt;Charles Tart, ''Waking Up: Overcoming the Obstacles to Human Potential''. iUniverse, Inc., 2001, 344pp. {{ISBN|0-595-19664-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rheingold.com/texts/reviews/waking.html] Review by [[Howard Rheingold]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Tart]]—an [[United States|American]] [[psychologist]] and [[parapsychologist]] known for his psychological work on the nature of consciousness—introduced the phrase "consensus trance" to the lexicon. Tart likened normal waking consciousness to hypnotic trance. He discussed how each of us is from birth inducted to the trance of the society around us.&lt;ref&gt;J. Jeffrey Means, Mary Ann Nelson, ''Trauma &amp; evil: healing the wounded soul''. Fortress Press, 2000, p.30-32. {{ISBN|0-8006-3270-2}}.&lt;br/&gt;
"Awakening from the consensus trances in which we are stuck as a result of living in a violent society is rare."&lt;/ref&gt; Tart noted both similarities and differences between hypnotic trance induction and consensus trance induction. (See [[G. I. Gurdjieff]]).

Some disciplines—[[Zen]] for example, and monastic schools such as [[Sufism]]—seek to overcome such conditioned realities by returning to less thoughtful and channeled states of mind.

[[Constructivism (psychological school)|Constructivism]] is a modern psychological response to reality-tunneling.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Eriksen, Garrett McAuliffe, ''Teaching counselors and therapists: constructivist and developmental course design''. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2001. pp. 366. {{ISBN|0-89789-795-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;For Wilson, a fully functioning human ought to be aware of their reality tunnel, and be able to keep it flexible enough to accommodate, and to some degree empathize with, different reality tunnels, different "game rules", different cultures.... Constructivist thinking is the exercise of metacognition to become aware of our reality tunnels or labyrinths and the elements that "program" them. Constructivist thinking should, ideally, decrease the chance that we will confuse our map of the world with the actual world.... [This philosophy] is currently expressed in many Eastern consciousness-exploration techniques.&lt;ref&gt;R. Elliott Ingersoll and Cecile Brennan, in Eriksen, McAuliffe 2001, p.336.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another example is Lacan's distinction between "[[The Real]]" and the "Symbolic". Lacan argued that the Real is the imminent unified reality which is mediated through symbols that allow it to be parsed into intelligible and differentiated segments. The symbolic, which is primarily subconscious, is further abstracted into the Imaginary (our actual beliefs and understandings of reality). These two orders ultimately shape the way we come to perceive reality.

'''Suburbia bashing''' refers to a negative discourse about [[suburbia]] that is relatively prominent in [[Australia]], particularly in the mainstream media. Sprawling cities define the urban Australian landscape. The iconic "quarter -acre" block is often cited as fundamental to the [[Australian Dream]].&lt;ref name="Horin"&gt;[[Adele Horin]], [http://www.smh.com.au/news/Adele-Horin/The-end-of-the-mythical-quarteracre-block/2005/04/08/1112815717.html ''The end of the mythical quarter-acre block''], The Age, 4 August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; It has both cultural and political currency.&lt;ref name="Horin"/&gt; There is a profound cynicism that exists in much commentary on suburbia that is promoted by "intellectuals and others seeking to delineate the suburb".&lt;ref name="Healy_xv"&gt;Chris Healy (1994). Beasts of Suburbia: Reinterpreting Cultures in Australian Suburbs. Sarah Ferber, Chris Healy and Chris McAuliffe (eds). Melbourne: Melbourne University Press, xv.&lt;/ref&gt; This discourse dates back to the boom of suburban development in the 1950s and criticises a culture of aspirational homeownership.&lt;ref name="Boyd"&gt;Robin Boyd (1960). ''The Australian Ugliness'', Melbourne: Penguin Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dame Edna Everage]] typifies this tradition as she demonstrates both "nostalgia and disdain for the Australian suburb and suburban life".&lt;ref name="Healy_xv"/&gt; In 1901, the year of Australian Federation, "almost 70 per cent of Sydney’s population were living in the suburbs"&lt;ref name="Turnball"&gt;Sue Turnball (2008). "Mapping the Vast Suburban Tundra: Australian comedy from Dame Edna to Kath and Kim". ''[[International Journal of Cultural Studies]]'' 11.1.  15-32.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the fact the majority of Australians still live in the suburbs, or maybe because of it, this practice of "suburbia bashing" perseveres in the mainstream media.&lt;ref name="Devine"&gt;Miranda Devine, [http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/10/23/1098474925523.html ''Copping the bile in Kellyville''], The Sun-Herald, 24 October 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Suburbia bashing is entrenched in questions of national identity. Disparaging commentary about the suburbs often appears in contrast to the national mythology of the Australian bush. The landscape that is portrayed in the tourism advertisements, by poets and painters, does not represent the experience of the majority of Australians. The suburb and the bush are counterposed, "the bush (cast as the authentic Australian landscape) with the city (regarded as blighted foreign import)" &lt;ref&gt;Brendan Gleeson (2006). ''The Australian Heartlands: Making Space for Hope in the Suburbs''. Sydney: Allen and Unwin.&lt;/ref&gt; The bush landscape is a masculine construction of a more “authentic notion of Australian national identity” exemplified by the poetry of [[Henry Lawson]] &lt;ref name="Turnball"/&gt; Conversely, the suburb is feminised, epitomised by Dame Edna for more than fifty years, and more recently, by comedic team Jane Turner and Gina Riley in ''[[Kath &amp; Kim (Australian TV series)|Kath &amp; Kim]]''.&lt;ref name="Turnball"/&gt;

In 1966 prominent journalist [[Allan Ashbolt]] described Australian reality as distinctly suburban:

''Behold the man – the Australian of today – on Sunday morning in the suburbs when the high decibel drone of the motor-mower is calling the faithful to worship. A block of land, a brick veneer, and the motor-mower beside him in the wilderness – what more does he want to sustain him''.&lt;ref name="Ashbolt"&gt;Allan Ashbolt. '"Godzone 3: Myth and Reality," ''Meanjin Quarterly'', 25.4 (December 1966): 353.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ashbolt satirised the suburb that represented [[Australian nationalism]], rooted in the post-World War II era, as passive and uninspired, inscribed strongly in spatial terms.&lt;ref name="Ashbolt"/&gt; Architect and cultural critic, [[Robin Boyd (architect)|Robin Boyd]], also criticised [[suburbia]], referring to it as the ''Australian Ugliness''.&lt;ref name="Boyd"/&gt; Boyd observed a “pursuit of respectability” in suburban spaces&lt;ref name="Boyd"/&gt; Ashbolt and Boyd represent this intellectual “tradition of abuse of the suburbs and of the majority of Australians”.&lt;ref name="Simons"&gt;Margaret Simons (2005). “Ties that Bind.” Julianne Schultz (ed). ''Griffith Review: People Like Us'' , 8 (Winter 2005): 11-36&lt;/ref&gt; Suburban space has been characterised by “conformity, control and some sense of false consciousness”.&lt;ref name="Simons"/&gt;{{rp|28}} Boyd writes of a contrived and superficial sense of place, centred on a “fear of reality”.&lt;ref name="Boyd"/&gt;{{rp|225}}

"The Australian ugliness begins with fear of reality, denial of the need for the everyday environment to reflect the heart of the human problem, satisfaction with veneer and cosmetic effects. It ends in betrayal of the element of love and a chill near the root of national self-respect."&lt;ref name="Boyd"/&gt;{{rp|225}}

The ugliness that Boyd describes is qualified as "skin deep".&lt;ref name="Boyd"/&gt;{{rp|1}} However, in the tradition of suburbia bashing, he proposes that there is an emptiness of spirit that can be read through an uniformed appreciation for aesthetics.

More recently there has been suggestion of a "new Australian ugliness".&lt;ref name="Peel"&gt;Mark Peel. [http://www.theage.com.au/news/in-depth/the-inside-story-of-life-on-the-outer/2007/09/15/1189277037851.html?page=fullpage "McMansions: The inside story of life on the outer"], The Age, 16 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; New suburban developments have seen the proliferation of what have become known as "[[McMansions]]". McMansions epitomise the suburbia that is attacked by Boyd for both its monotony and "featurism" &lt;ref name="Boyd"/&gt; Journalist Miranda Devine refers to an elitist perception that those who live in such suburban assemblages display a "poverty of spirit and a barrenness of mind" that is derived from a politics of aesthetics and taste, as expressed by Boyd fifty years ago.&lt;ref name="Devine"/&gt; In this "new Australian ugliness" some commentators attribute a rise in consumer culture: "There’s a concern about over-consumption. But there’s little thought of why – beyond advertising-driven gullibility".&lt;ref name="Peel"/&gt; Academic Mark Peel has rejected notions of gullible "consuming" residents of new suburbs by explaining his own "choice" to move to Melbourne’s outer suburbs.&lt;ref name="Peel"/&gt;

Peel alludes to a discourse of suburbia that is elitist, and is based on matters of taste. Taste has translated into a socio-cultural divide. When [[Miranda Devine]] refers to the elites, she refers to an inner-city population. The divide is between the urbanites and the suburbanites, and the conflict is over national identity.

{{Nihongo|'''''The Last Story'''''|ラストストーリー|Rasuto Sutōrī|lead=yes}} is a Japanese [[action role-playing game]], developed by [[Mistwalker]] and [[AQ Interactive]] for the [[Wii]] video game console. [[Nintendo]] published the title in all regions except for North America, where it was published by [[Xseed Games]]. Initially released in Japan in 2011, the game was released in western territories through 2012. ''The Last Story'' takes place upon the island fortress of Lazulis, in a world that is slowly being drained of life by an unknown force. The story focuses on a group of mercenaries looking for work on Lazulis; one of their number, Zael, dreams of becoming a knight. After receiving the mystical "Mark of the Outsider", Zael becomes involved with a noblewoman named Calista in an ongoing war between humans and the beast-like Gorak. During gameplay, the player controls Zael as he and the mercenary group to which he belongs undertake missions on Lazulis. Zael can command the rest of the mercenary squad during missions, and fights in battles that involve action, tactical and stealth elements. Multiple online multiplayer modes are also present.

The game was directed and co-written by [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]], the original creator of ''[[Final Fantasy]]'', who had the initial idea for the title after seeing the mixed responses to ''[[Blue Dragon (video game)|Blue Dragon]]'' and ''[[Lost Odyssey]]''. Together with designer Takuya Matsumoto, Sakaguchi decided to make a game that would be different from his previous work and most other role-playing games. Development took between three and four years according to different sources. Its story was originally based in science fiction, but at Nintendo's insistence it was changed to be primarily based around fantasy. Among the staff were regular ''Final Fantasy'' composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]], and illustrator Kimihiko Fujisaka. It was originally going to be exclusive to Japan, and later its North American release was in doubt after being announced for release in Europe and Australia. During this time, a fan campaign called [[Operation Rainfall]] drew considerable attention to the title. The title was a commercial success, and received generally positive reviews worldwide: while the gameplay generally met with praise, opinions varied on the story and graphics.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:The Last Story gameplay.jpg|thumb|left|Player character Zael and his party facing one of the game's bosses.]]
''The Last Story'' is an [[action role-playing game]] (ARPG) incorporating elements of [[Tactical role-playing game|tactical]] and [[Stealth game|stealth]] gameplay. The player controls main protagonist Zael for the majority of the game.&lt;ref name="NWRpreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGNreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RPGreview"/&gt; Zael is primarily controlled using the [[Wii Remote]] from a fixed third-person view. The game can be controlled using the [[Wii Remote]] and [[Wii Nunchuk|Nunchuk]], or the [[Classic Controller]].&lt;ref name="NWRpreview"/&gt; The game's main hub is a public house on Lazulis Island, which also houses a save point for players. Lazulis City is the main setting for most of the game, which provides the player with access to side quests, shops, and areas to collect items when not engaged in the main story. In addition to environments within missions such as ruins and forests where enemies are encountered and fought, there is an arena where the player can improve the party and their combat abilities. If the party is victorious, the party can pick up money and items from [[non-playable character]]s betting on the fight.&lt;ref name="NWRpreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GSreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LastTension"/&gt;

In battle, the player controls Zael alone, with the rest of the party being controlled by the game's [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]] (AI) and directed by player commands.&lt;ref name="NWRpreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GSreview"/&gt; Parties are composed of up to six characters, each with five "lives", with them automatically reviving after a certain time if Zael cannot revive them manually.&lt;ref name="RPGreview"/&gt; The attack directions of both party characters and enemies are represented by lines connecting the different characters.&lt;ref name="AndriaTwitter"/&gt; Combat plays out in real-time, with attacks either happening automatically when a character is within range or manually. Actions such as dodging and movement are done manually. Blocking and actions such as vaulting over low obstacles are performed by holding the B button. Zael can also move to take cover behind objects, which allows them to break an enemy's line of sight on them or creep along walls.&lt;ref name="NWRpreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GSreview"/&gt; During combat, a character's Tension gauge will fill, enabling the performance of special moves: these can vary from dealing damage to enemies across a wide area to reviving unconscious allies.&lt;ref name="LastTension"/&gt;

A skill unique to Zael is Gathering: when activated, all enemies within an area will focus their attention on him, allowing other team members to act without interruption. As the game progresses, Zael can issue commands to the other team members, with the perspective switching to a top-down view for this action.&lt;ref name="IGNreview"/&gt; In addition to standard combat, players can switch to a behind-the-shoulder perspective for manually firing Zael's crossbow, which can launch a variety of ammunition at enemies and objects. Enemies in Zael's sights will have their weaknesses and abilities revealed.&lt;ref name="GSreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LastFocus"/&gt; In battle, destructible objects in the environment can be used by the party to defeat enemies; these objects regenerate after a time rather than remaining destroyed.&lt;ref name="AndriaTwitter"/&gt; Magic cast by certain characters with that ability leave the casting area temporarily imbued with a spell's elemental properties creating a magic circle. These circles can cause elemental damage or effects to enemies within the area, or they can imbue the weapons of characters who walk into the circle with said element. Eventually, Zael will learn the ability to "diffuse" magic circles which will spread the spell's effect which varies depending on the element. .&lt;ref name="AndriaTwitter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LastMagic"/&gt;

In addition to the single-player campaign, players have access to online multiplayer through the game's main menu. The multiplayer features two modes: a competitive mode where players face each other in various stages, and a co-op mode where a team of players face bosses from the single-player campaign. For the competitive match, the player can choose from multiple allied and enemy characters, and all boons granted by equipment or experience levels are removed to level the playing field. Teams of up to six players can be formed for team matches. Players gain or lose points when they defeat or are defeated by an opponent, and defeated enemies respawn in the battlefield. When all opponents have been defeated, all players are awarded with items and equipment that can carry over into the single-player campaign: those who performed the best receive higher-quality equipment and "titles" ti distinguish them from other players. The co-op battles allow players to carry over their equipment and character levels from single-player, with the available characters being restricted to Zael's mercenary group. Defeating a boss earns players items themed around it. In both modes, players communicate using a stock of scripted responses both taken from the single-player campaign and specially created for multiplayer.&lt;ref name="LastMultiplayer"/&gt;

== Synopsis ==
''The Last Story'' is set on Lazulis Island, a vast seaborne fortress ruled by Count Arganan and allied to an unnamed human empire in the midst of crisis as the land decays and dies. Dagran, a mercenary, travels to Lazulis in search of employment with the mercenary band he leads: Zael, Syrenne, Yurick, Lowell and Mirania. During the journey, Zael, who dreams of becoming a knight, encounters a mysterious force and is branded on the hand, granting him magical power. While on an errand in town, Zael runs into a woman named Lisa and helps her escape from city guards. Employed as guards to Count Arganan for the wedding of his niece, Lady Calista, to Lord Jirall, Zael encounters Calista and recognizes her as "Lisa". The group also meet General Asthar and his protegee Therius when Syrenne picks a fight with Therius. After Calista explains to Zael in private that hers is an arranged marriage, Lazulis is attacked by the Gurak, a race once banished from Lazulis by humans and now united under their ruler Zangurak. To avoid being killed by the ensuing cannon fire, Zael, Dagran, and Calista stow away on a Gurak ship and eventually take it over. The group are returned to Lazulis by the island's knights. On Lazulis, the mercenaries are accused of aiding the Gurak by Jirall, who is trying to cover up his cowardly behavior during the Gurak attack by having anyone who witnessed it imprisoned. Dagran persuades Arganan to release them after showing him Zael's mark, which is revealed to be a mystical "Mark of the Outsider" destined to save Lazulis from disaster.

Arganan attempts to get Zael onto his side, offering him knighthood and Calista's hand in marriage. Zael swears allegiance to Arganan, who orders Zael to direct Lazulis towards the Gurak lands. During this time, Asthar accepts Zael as a new pupil and gives him a medal following a successful sparring. Shortly after this, Gurak assassins attack. Asthar is killed, telling Zael the medal is a key before dying. Zael is accused of Asthar's murder by Jirall and imprisoned. Calista frees him. Dagran suggests Jirall is likely the real killer, and prompts Zael to search Jirall's room, where he finds the murder weapon and a letter revealing dealings with the Gurak. Jirall is imprisoned, freeing Calista to be betrothed to Zael. When Zael's suspicions are later aroused, Dagran admits to him that he framed Jirall in order to ensure Zael's liberty. Lazulis arrives in Gurak lands and takes their keep with minimal resistance. Zael learns there that the Gurak are suffering the same degradation of the land as humans are, which motivated their invasion. Zael's brand reacts with Calista's blood and Asthar's medal to reveal a secret location on Lazulis. Joined by Therius, they enter and meet a Sorceress, who reveals that the "Outsider" is an extraterrestrial being that absorbs energy. At the bidding of her lover, Arganan's ancestor, she summoned the Outsider to the planet in an attempt to end conflict. After realizing that it was destroying the land in order to collect its energy, they split it into two halves in order to slow the land's death. If the two halves, now respectively controlled by humans and the Gurak, are reunited and released, the land's decay will halt and the motive for the war will no longer exist.

Realizing Arganan must have known of this, Zael refuses his knighthood and sets out with Calista to destroy Lazulis' cannon, which is powered by Lazulis' half of the Outsider. However, when the Gurak attack Lazulis they decide to instead help Arganan use the cannon to drive off the attack. The cannon's fire proves insufficient, and Arganan is mysteriously killed by its power. The Gurak overrun Lazulis. Calista and the mercenaries head out to retrieve Zangurak's half of the Outsider, only to find its power has already been taken. Once they remove it, the Gurak fortress starts to crumble, knocking Zael and Calista into the ocean. They are rescued by Gurak ships. On board is Jirall, who has been given a cursed sword by Zangurak for him to kill Zael. Realizing the sword is affecting Jirall's mind, Zael tries to save Jirall by disarming him, but the cursed sword moves unaided and kills Jirall. Meanwhile, the Gurak take Calista to Zangurak.

The mercenaries pursue Zangurak to Lazulis Island. Lowell is fatally injured by a Gurak warrior. Zael finds Calista with Zangurak, who has used her Arganan blood and the Gurak half of the Outsider to anoint his right arm. After the group defeats Zangurak, he rips off his right arm and sends it to use the full power of the Outsider to revive him. However, Dagran kills Zangurak's arm so he can use the Arganan blood and Outsider half on it for himself. He reveals that he murdered Asthar because he learned that Asthar had commanded the Lazulis knights who killed his family. He has been collaborating with Zangurak with the ultimate goal of using the Outsider to remake the world so the mercenaries have a better life. Finding he is still not powerful enough to defeat the group, Dagran tries to absorb the Lazulis half of the Outsider into the center of his body, giving Zael an opening to kill him. Dagran reconciles with the group before dying, then his spirit uses the Outsider's energy to resurrect Lowell. Zael and Calista reunite the two halves of the Outsider, which leaves the planet after explaining that its true purpose is to collect scattered energy in outer space and use it to create life on new worlds. Humans and Gurak begin coexisting, sharing their technology and using Lazulis as a neutral land where the two races freely interact. Therius decides to train new knights in the empire while leaving Lazulis in Zael's care, Zael and Calista are married in her ancient family home, the mercenaries hold a funeral for Dagran, and Zael is finally made a knight by Calista.

==Development==
[[File:Hironobu Sakaguchi - Tokyo Game Show 2006.jpg|thumb|left|Director, scenario co-designer and co-writer [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]] at the 2006 [[Tokyo Game Show]].]]
The initial concepts for ''The Last Story'' came to [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]] after his departure from [[Square (company)|Square]] (now [[Square Enix]]) in 2003. After a period working on games at his new studio [[Mistwalker]], Sakaguchi realized that his style of game were not in tune with current gaming trends.&lt;ref name="IwataAsks1"/&gt; Later, he elaborated that ''The Last Story'' was primarily born from reflecting on the design mistakes he made during the development of ''[[Blue Dragon (video game)|Blue Dragon]]'' (2006) and ''[[Lost Odyssey]]'' (2007): while they tried to innovate with the story, they kept the gameplay very traditional.&lt;ref name="1UPfamitsu"/&gt; Sakaguchi drew up a design document for the game, and around that time met up with Takuya Matsumoto, a designer from [[AQ Interactive]] who had worked with Sakaguchi on ''Blue Dragon''. They both realized that they held the same views on what was holding their games back in the current market, and decided to collaborate on the game with the goal of creating something new.&lt;ref name="IwataAsks3"/&gt; In an interview with [[IGN]], Sakaguchi said that development took three years: the first year was devoted to a trial-and-error development process devoted to the battle system.&lt;ref name="IGNinterview"/&gt; A longer development time of four years was reported by Matsumoto in a different interview with [[Gamasutra]]. According to Matsumoto, the team leads went to the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] (E3) each year and were assured that their game was in-step with current gameplay trends.&lt;ref name="GamaInterview"/&gt; Production of ''The Last Story'' was a collaboration between Mistwalker, AQ Interactive and [[Nintendo]], and was Sakaguchi's first work as a director since ''[[Final Fantasy V]]'' (1992).&lt;ref name="IwataAsks1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CGV2"/&gt; The game was going through its final development stages by April 2010, and according to Sakaguchi was "complete" by December that year.&lt;ref name="LastFinal1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LastFinal2"/&gt;

Although Sakaguchi's previous RPGs from Mistwalker had been released for the [[Xbox 360]], ''The Last Story'' was created for the [[Wii]]. According to Sakaguchi, this was because Nintendo's Shinji Hatano shared their vision of a role-playing game that did not follow genre conversions, and so Sakaguchi accepted his offer of collaboration.&lt;ref name="CGV1"/&gt; After being contacted regarding both ''The Last Story'' and fellow Wii ARPG ''[[Xenoblade Chronicles]]'', Hatano said that the games should be made for a wide audience and using a "romanticist approach".&lt;ref name="LastStoryRomantic"/&gt; When explaining why ''The Last Story'' was exclusive to the Wii, Sakaguchi said that it was because a large proportion of the late development staff, including the testers, came from Nintendo.&lt;ref name="AndriaTwitter"/&gt; In a later interview, he said that working with the Wii, which did not use high-definition graphics, presented challenges as some of his ideas could not be implemented due to technical restrictions. Despite this, the team aimed to create a game that would look good when compared to games on high-definition consoles.&lt;ref name="IGNinterview"/&gt; Matsumoto stated that Nintendo had a strong influence on the game, which did not always sit well with him despite their suggestions ultimately improving the game. He also stated that Nintendo's creative and development aid in fine-tuning the game was the reason for its extended development.&lt;ref name="GamaInterview"/&gt;

The basic story was conceived by Sakaguchi and Matsumoto, while the script was written by Sakaguchi, Masaru Hatano and Takatoshi Aoki.&lt;ref name="GamaInterview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LastWriters"/&gt; The story was contributed to by multiple staff members, which sometimes annoyed Sakaguchi when they suggested something that would be out of character for one of the cast.&lt;ref name="IwataAsks3"/&gt; According to Sakaguchi, the initial version featuring a science fiction storyline was "shot down" by Nintendo, forcing the team to begin all over again with a new setting and characters.&lt;ref name="IGNinterview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LastLocal"/&gt; Despite the story still using science fiction elements, the team worked to distance the setting from those elements by focusing on bright, natural colors for the environments.&lt;ref name="IGNsetting"/&gt; The biographies of the main cast were put together during the story's creation.&lt;ref name="IGNinterview"/&gt; Originally, according to Hatano, the game's theme was to have been the "all-important drama that takes place between a man and a woman", but as development progressed it was changed to a theme of general companionship, although the original story remained the same.&lt;ref name="LastStoryRomantic"/&gt; Hatano suggested incorporating dialogue into the gameplay rather than restricting it to cutscenes. This approach was inspired by both ''[[Uncharted]]'' and television series ''[[The West Wing]]''.&lt;ref name="GamaInterview"/&gt; The concept was initially put forward as a joke about Zael's habit of kicking doors open, and how his companions would comment on how he always did this. After receiving positive feedback, they implemented it and kept in Zael's behavior.&lt;ref name="IwataAsks3"/&gt; Sakaguchi used this in-game dialogue to help convey the characters' personalities: as part of this, adlibs from the actors were included, and continual adjustments were made to the script. The characters' artwork also prompted Sakaguchi to make changes so the characters better fitted their presentation.&lt;ref name="IGNinterview"/&gt; The game's voiced dialogue was estimated at 12,000 lines.&lt;ref name="LastExclusive1"/&gt; The option for players to skip through dialogue was a feature that Sakaguchi did not like, but he knew that some players would not like necessary long cutscenes, so gave them the option of going through them while still following the story. This meant that all the cutscenes needed to be done using the in-game engine rather than pre-rendered graphics.&lt;ref name="1UPfamitsu"/&gt;

The characters were designed by Kimihiko Fujisaka. Fujisaka, who was acquainted with Sakaguchi, was brought on board the project at the beginning. At that point, only a simple plot outline had been created, and Sakaguchi showed this to Fujisaka and asked what he visualized from it. Due to this, Fujisaka had a lot of leeway in his designs. Due to Sakaguchi living in Hawaii while the game was being developed, Fujisaka was initially nervous about working with him on the project, but ultimately he found their working relationship to be a positive one. An aspect that worried Fujisaka during the early stages was the decision to have the characters able to change their clothing: their original appearances had been designed in relation to their lines, and while designing extra outfits proved difficult, he ultimately enjoyed the experience. Fujisaka also worked as a world designer, initially feeling restricted by the console's limited graphics. According to Fujisaka, the city hub began taking shape in 2009, relatively early in development. The world design he initially created was fairly bleak, but after Nintendo insisted on the scenario being changed, he redesigned it around a brighter fantasy aesthetic.&lt;ref name="IwataAsks1"/&gt;

Developing the gameplay began at the start of development, with a test environment being built to develop and refine the basics of the battle system. Work within the test build spanned approximately one and a half years. While creating the battle system, the staff decided that the key words should be "order" and "chaos": whoever gained order on the battlefield would be the victor. One of the concepts that emerged from this was Gathering, Zael's ability to direct all enemies' attention towards him. At first, Gathering ended up generating an unwanted amount of chaos on the battlefield, and this resulted in the trial-and-error period for it running on for a long time. The biggest challenge, once the concept had been finalized, was adjusting its effectiveness on the battlefield depending on the situation and enemy types.&lt;ref name="IwataAsks3"/&gt; A concept that did not make it into the final game was "Replay": after an enemy successfully cast a spell, players could rewatch the last few seconds of battle from an overhead view to see what type it was and take that into their strategy. This slowed the pace of combat down too much, so the concept was entirely removed. Hangovers of it include the ability to freeze time during certain actions, and the overhead perspective when commanding party members&lt;ref name="IwataAsks3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGNinterview"/&gt; The cover system was designed around the limitations of the camera control born from the Wii Remote's control scheme.&lt;ref name="VentureInterview"/&gt;

Matsumoto was responsible for the level design. While preparing destructible elements within the environment, the staff took care that they could be easily recognized by the player. So as to create a more direct experience than other Japanese RPGs, the camera view was deliberately restricted around Zael, so the player would be kept within his point of view. A difficult part of development was balancing story and gameplay, which sometimes caused clashes between Sakaguchi and Matsumoto, as Matsumoto would upset the balance and necessitate Sakaguchi re-balancing it. The battle system and AI was refined by what Matsumoto described as "chaotic battles royal between over 20 people wielding swords, magic and guns or ally command systems". The ability to fire projectiles had a big impact on the battle system's design.&lt;ref name="SilInterview"/&gt; This concept was a hangover from the game's origins as a science fiction story.&lt;ref name="LastLocal"/&gt; For the multiplayer, Sakaguchi avoided the potential for players to be rude to one-another by restricting their dialogue to segments from the single-player campaign. This was possible given the large amount of ambient dialogue in the game.&lt;ref name="CGV1"/&gt;

The game's music was composed by [[Nobuo Uematsu]], a long-time collaborator with Sakaguchi who had worked on the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series, ''Blue Dragon'' and ''Lost Odyssey''. Uematsu initially had a rough time: the first three pieces of music he sent were rejected, and then Uematsu did not respond for some time. Sakaguchi worried that Uematsu might quit the project altogether. In fact, Uematsu realized Sakaguchi's wishes for the title and had to rethink his approach entirely. With the second submission, Uematsu stated that he might leave if his music still did not fit, but it did and he remained as composer. In contrast to the majority of his earlier works, which made heavy use of purely melodic pieces and "jogging music", Uematsu concentrated on a mixture between video game and film music to emphasize emotion and ambient sounds. He also worked to avoid creating signature jingles and fanfares. The most difficult pieces for him were battle tracks: the main battle theme was seven minutes long, but broken into small pieces that varied depending on situations and could be cued in depending on what was happening on the battlefield.&lt;ref name="CGV1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IwataAsks2"/&gt; The game's theme song, {{nihongo|"Toberu Mono"|翔べるもの||lit. "The Flying One"}}, was composed by Uematsu with lyrics by Sakaguchi. Its lyrics are about the world someone is in not being where they are meant to be, with the phrase "going home" being used progressively through the song. According to Sakaguchi, the theme was quite personal for him, and also displays the "foreignness" of the game.&lt;ref name="IGNinterview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IwataAsks2"/&gt;

==Release==
{{see also|Operation Rainfall}}
Sakaguchi revealed that he was working on a new game in July 2009.&lt;ref name="MistNewgame"/&gt; Initially targeted for a reveal that year, this was delayed for unknown reasons into 2010.&lt;ref name="MistNewgameDelay"/&gt; The game was announced by Nintendo in January 2010, alongside its platform and logo.&lt;ref name="LastRevealed"/&gt; It was released on January 27, 2011.&lt;ref name="1UPfamitsu"/&gt; Despite prompting interest from genre fans in the west since its official announcement, shortly before its Japanese release, Nintendo announced that ''The Last Story'' would remain exclusive to Japan.&lt;ref name="LastExclusive1"/&gt; Nintendo explained that the effort involved in bringing ''The Last Story'' overseas would be too much work on top of other important releases such as ''[[Kirby's Epic Yarn]]'' and titles for the [[Nintendo 3DS]]. Despite this, Nintendo stated that there was a strong possibility of it releasing in the United Kingdom due to its growing RPG market.&lt;ref name="LastExclusive2"/&gt; It was officially announced for Europe in June 2011.&lt;ref name="NinAnnounce"/&gt; The European localization was handled by Nintendo of Europe, using the same team that had done ''Xenoblade Chronicles''. British voice actors were used for the dubbing, making use of various accents for the different characters. Some of the original programmers helped with the implementation of the localization, and it underwent unspecified adjustments.&lt;ref name="CGV2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LastVoicework"/&gt; The game released in Europe on February 24, 2012.&lt;ref name="SilEurope"/&gt; It received a limited edition, featuring a CD with seven music tracks and an artbook.&lt;ref name="LastLimited"/&gt; It was also released in Australia on February 23.&lt;ref name="LastAus"/&gt;

After a continued lack of confirmation of a North American release, including it not being included in Nintendo's 2011 release schedule, a fan-based movement called [[Operation Rainfall]] started a campaign to raise awareness for ''The Last Story'', ''Xenoblade Chronicles'', and another Wii RPG titled ''[[Pandora's Tower]]''. This campaign included letter writing to Nintendo and petitions for its overseas release.&lt;ref name="LastMissing"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LastOperation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DesRainfall"/&gt; Despite acknowledging the effort, Nintendo stated that there were no plans for a North American release.&lt;ref name="Last1UP"/&gt; Matsumoto was severely disappointed by this decision and thought ''The Last Story'' would never make it to North America.&lt;ref name="VentureInterview"/&gt; At this point, [[Xseed Games]], who had developed a reputation for publishing niche Japanese games, took an interest in publishing the title. Initially approaching Nintendo in 2011, Nintendo confirmed that they had no plans to publish the title themselves. After playing through a Japanese copy of the game, and the staff were favorably impressed and decided to pitch to Nintendo for the game's North American publishing rights. They were helped by the connections between parent company AQ Interactive and Mistwalker. Xseed Games were the first publisher to ask Nintendo about ''The Last Story'', and after being favorably impressed by their proposal, Nintendo granted Xseed Games publishing rights.&lt;ref name="VentureInterview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KotakuXseed"/&gt; While a new localization for North America was considered, it was decided to use Nintendo of Europe's localization as it better fitted the game's atmosphere and aesthetic.&lt;ref name="LastLocal"/&gt; It officially released in North America on August 14, but problems with stock caused Amazon and GameStop to put orders on hold and push their release dates forward.&lt;ref name="LastNAShipping"/&gt;

The game’s story received generally positive reactions from critics, although some criticized it for a lack of originality in the RPG genre. While they did not comment much on the story, ''[[Famitsu]]'' called ''The Last Story'' "very classical RPG".&lt;ref name="FamReview"/&gt; Eurogamer's Martin Robinson found the characters the most appealing part of the game, an opinion shared by Francesco Dagostino of [[1UP.com]], who particularly cited Syrenne's portrayal.&lt;ref name="1UPreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EuroReview"/&gt; [[GameSpot]]'s Mark Walton shared this opinion while also praising the story's epic scale.&lt;ref name="GSreview"/&gt; IGN's Keza MacDonald said that it presented a good story and characters within familiar themes and settings.&lt;ref name="IGNreview"/&gt; ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge Magazine]]'' found the story fairly traditional despite a strong cast and emotional power, while Matthew Castle of ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' praised the effort made to flesh out the party members in side-missions despite referring to the main narrative as "tedious".&lt;ref name="CGVreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EdgeReview"/&gt; [[GameTrailers]], while noting the familiar plotlines the game explored, said that ''The Last Story'' handled its plot better than others of its kind, praising its character development.&lt;ref name="GTreview"/&gt; ''[[Game Informer]]'''s Joe Juba was fairly critical, finding the story overly predictable and the characters shallow. Jason Wishnov of [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]] was also critical of the characters and plot, calling the former "one-note" despite convincing camaraderie and well-written in-game dialogue, and the latter impeded by problems with formulaic writing despite some late-game twists.&lt;ref name="G4review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GIreview"/&gt; Simon Parkin, writing for ''[[Official Nintendo Magazine]]'', found the characters likable despite a predictable story; ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' shared points of praise with other reviewers, in addition to praising Zael and Calista's romance, saying that it held the game together during some mid-game stumbles.&lt;ref name="ONMreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NGreview"/&gt; RPGamer's Alex Fuller said that the story was great despite it using well-worn cliches.&lt;ref name="RPGreview"/&gt; Multiple critics gave high praise to the British-voiced localization.&lt;ref name="IGNreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RPGreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GSreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EGMreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EuroReview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="G4review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ONMreview"/&gt;

The gameplay was generally well received. ''Famitsu'' praised the battle system, saying that it was friendly towards casual gamers.&lt;ref name="FamReview"/&gt; MacDonald likewise praised the battle system as "one of the best combat systems I've played with in any RPG, Japanese or otherwise".&lt;ref name="IGNreview"/&gt; Walton found the battle system fun and enjoyed the amount of side quests, while Dagostino was highly positive about the game's successful efforts in moving away from genre tradition.&lt;ref name="GSreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="1UPreview"/&gt; Juba enjoyed the multiplayer and praised the game for moving away from the genre's traditional battle systems despite faults with their overall implementation, while Robinson found the gameplay suffered from the design goals that had fueled its creation.&lt;ref name="EuroReview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GIreview"/&gt; Castle was positive about the variety of gameplay and tactical elements despite some stiff combat mechanics, but noted the inability to alter difficulty being a point against the game.&lt;ref name="CGVreview"/&gt; Wishnov praised the fast pace and variety of the combat, but found that more cumbersome RPG elements and a lack of overall control negatively impacted the experience.&lt;ref name="G4review"/&gt; GameTrailers generally praised about the way gameplay and combat was handled despite some "clunky" moments, but was less positive the multiplayer option's balance and variety.&lt;ref name="GTreview"/&gt; ''Edge'', while noting multiple core similarities with other games within the genre, found that other elements came together to make it a more fast-paced cinematic experience than other traditional RPGs; Fuller enjoyed the battle system, but thought that it lacked challenge and had difficulties with the camera.&lt;ref name="RPGreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EdgeReview"/&gt; Parkin was generally positive about combat, particularly about the blending and gradual growth of character abilities, while ''Nintendo Power'' called the battle system "satisfying" and the multiplayer "surprisingly worthwhile".&lt;ref name="ONMreview"/&gt; Multiple reviewers commented on the game's linear structure, with opinions ranging from indifferent to negative.&lt;ref name="EGMreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="G4review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GTreview"/&gt;

Opinions on the game's visual style varied. Walton called the game's visuals "some of the best ever seen on the Wii", which was echoed to a degree by MacDonald.&lt;ref name="IGNreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GSreview"/&gt; Castle was generally positive about the game's aesthetics, citing the water effects as particularly good.&lt;ref name="CGVreview"/&gt; ''Edge'' was fairly mixed, saying that well-done environmental effects or the world-building through character banter were spoiled by low-quality textures and stilted character animations.&lt;ref name="EdgeReview"/&gt; Juba praised the character models, but found environments to be "ugly and muddy in comparison"; Fuller, while not actively criticizing them, said that players used to high-definition consoles would be disappointed.&lt;ref name="RPGreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GIreview"/&gt; GameTrailers found the amount of detail put into environments "remarkable" for the Wii hardware despite a lack of scale, while Parkin found the visuals generally unimpressive despite a few stand-out moments.&lt;ref name="GTreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ONMreview"/&gt; ''Nintendo Power'' said that the graphics gave the game's setting an "authentic" appearance despite some low-resolution textures, while Eurogamer praised them for their "sepia tone".&lt;ref name="EuroReview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NGreview"/&gt; Frame rate drops during moments of high activity were generally noted by reviewers.&lt;ref name="RPGreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GSreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CGVreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GTreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NGreview"/&gt; Uematsu's incidental scoring also received praise from multiple critics.&lt;ref name="RPGreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GSreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CGVreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GTreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ONMreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NGreview"/&gt;

Upon release, ''The Last Story'' topped Japanese gaming charts, selling 114,722 units.&lt;ref name="LastDebut"/&gt; Assessments by [[Media Create]] stated that while the game had achieved higher sales than ''Xenoblade Chronicles'' due to higher interest in the title, Wii hardware sales remained low, indicating that the title was mostly bought by gamers who already owned a Wii console.&lt;ref name="LastCreate"/&gt; By the end of 2011, the game sold just over 157,000 units.&lt;ref name="LastTotalSales"/&gt; Upon its release in the UK, it debuted at #15.&lt;ref name="LastEUsales"/&gt; After the release of ''The Last Story'' in North America, Xseed Games released a statement saying that ''The Last Story'' was their most successful title to date, with its Premium Edition selling out quickly and needing to be replaced with a different special edition.&lt;ref name="LastNAsales"/&gt;

A literary '''trope''' is the use of [[figurative language]], via word, phrase or an image, for artistic effect such as using a [[figure of speech]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller|year=1990|title=Tropes, Parables, and Performatives|publisher=Duke University Press|page=9|isbn= 0822311119}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''trope'' has also come to be used for describing commonly recurring [[Literary technique|literary]] and [[rhetorical device]]s,&lt;ref name=cuddon&gt;{{cite book|last=Cuddon|first=J. A.|first2=C. E.|last2=Preston|title=The Penguin Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory|edition=4|year=1998|publisher=Penguin|location=London|isbn=9780140513639|page=948|chapter=Trope}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[motif (narrative)|motifs]] or [[cliché]]s in creative works.&lt;ref name="trope_mw" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|chapter=trope (revised entry)|year=2014|location=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The term ''trope'' derives from the Greek {{lang|el|[[wikt:τρόπος|τρόπος]]}} (''tropos''), "turn, direction, way", derived from the verb τρέπειν (''trepein''), "to turn, to direct, to alter, to change".&lt;ref name="trope_mw"&gt;{{citation|title=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary|chapter=trope|year=2009|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/trope|accessdate=2009-10-16|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]|location=[[Springfield, Massachusetts]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tropes and their classification were an important field in [[Rhetoric|classical rhetoric]]. The study of tropes has been taken up again in modern criticism, especially in [[deconstruction]].&lt;ref name="childers"/&gt; Tropological criticism (not to be confused with [[tropological reading]], a type of biblical [[exegesis]]) is the historical study of tropes, which aims to "define the dominant tropes of an epoch" and to "find those tropes in literary and non-literary texts", an interdisciplinary investigation of which [[Michel Foucault]] was an "important exemplar".&lt;ref name="childers"/&gt;

==In medieval writing==
A specialized use is the medieval [[Amplification (rhetoric)|amplification]] of texts from the liturgy, such as in the ''[[Kyrie|Kyrie Eleison]]'' (''Kyrie, / magnae Deus potentia, / liberator hominis, / transgressoris mandati, / eleison''). The most important example of such a trope is the ''[[Quem quaeritis?]]'', an amplification before the ''[[Introit]]'' of the [[Easter Sunday]] service and the source for [[liturgical drama]].&lt;ref name=cuddon/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cuddon|first=J. A.|first2=C. E.|last2=Preston|title=The Penguin Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory|edition=4|year=1998|publisher=Penguin|location=London|isbn=9780140513639|page=721|chapter=Quem quaeritis trope}}&lt;/ref&gt; This particular practice came to an end with the [[Tridentine Mass]], the unification of the liturgy in 1570 promulgated by [[Pope Pius V]].&lt;ref name="childers"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Childers|first1=Joseph|last2=Hentzi|first2=Gary|title=The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism|year=1995|publisher=Columbia UP|location=New York|isbn=9780231072434|page=309|chapter=Trope}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types and examples==
[[Rhetoric]]ians have closely analyzed the great variety of "twists and turns" used in [[poetry]] and [[literature]] and have provided an extensive list of precise labels for these poetic devices. These include:

* [[Allegory]] – A sustained metaphor continued through whole sentences or even through a whole discourse. For example: "The ship of state has sailed through rougher storms than the tempest of these lobbyists."
* [[Antanaclasis]] – The stylistic trope of repeating a single word, but with a different meaning each time; antanaclasis is a common type of [[pun]], and like other kinds of pun, it is often found in slogans.
*[[Hyperbole]]
*[[Irony]] – Creating a trope through implying the opposite of the standard meaning, such as describing a bad situation as "good times".
*[[Litotes]]
* [[Metaphor]] – An explanation of an object or idea through juxtaposition of disparate things with a similar characteristic, such as describing a courageous person as having a "heart of a lion".
* [[Metonymy]] – A trope through proximity or correspondence. For example, referring to actions of the U.S. President as "actions of the White House".
*[[Oxymoron]]
*[[Synecdoche]] – Related to metonymy and metaphor, creates a play on words by referring to something with a related concept: for example, referring to the whole with the name of a part, such as "hired hands" for workers; a part with the name of the whole, such as "the law" for police officers; the general with the specific, such as "bread" for food; the specific with the general, such as "cat" for a lion; or an object with its substance, such as "bricks and mortar" for a building.

For a longer list, see [[Figure of speech#Tropes|Figure of speech: Tropes]].

[[Kenneth Burke]] has called metaphor, metonymy, synecdoche and irony the "four master tropes".&lt;ref name="Burke"&gt;

:'''Casey Newton''': "There are two [[wolves]]" … You told me this story my entire life, and now I'm telling you: There are two [[wolves]] and they are always [[fighting]]. One is [[darkness]] and [[despair]], the other is [[light]] and [[hope]]. Which wolf wins?

* In the [[Luke Cage (TV Series)]] Season 2, Episode 2, at time-index 48:06, a pastor tells the story of a "Cherokee Legend", with the metaphor of two wolves fighting, where the boy in the story asks "Which wolf is stronger?" and his grandfather responds: "It's the one you feed."

=== Likely references ===

'''''V for Vendetta''''' is a British [[graphic novel]] written by [[Alan Moore]] and illustrated by [[David Lloyd (comics)|David Lloyd]] (with additional art by [[Tony Weare]]). Initially published in black and white as an ongoing serial in the short-lived UK anthology ''Warrior'', it morphed into a ten-issue limited series published by [[DC Comics]]. Subsequent collected editions have been typically published under DC's more specialized imprint [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]]. The story depicts a [[dystopia]]n and [[apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] near-[[future history]] version of the United Kingdom in the 1990s, preceded by a [[nuclear war]] in the 1980s which had devastated most of the rest of the world.

The comics follow its title character and protagonist, [[V (comics)|V]], an [[Anarchism|anarchist]] revolutionary dressed in a [[Guy Fawkes mask]], as he begins an elaborate and theatrical revolutionist campaign to kill his former captors, bring down the fascist state and convince the people to abandon democracy in favour of anarchy, while inspiring a young woman, [[Evey Hammond]], to be his protégé.

The first episodes of ''V for Vendetta'' appeared in black-and-white between 1982 and 1985, in ''[[Warrior (comics)|Warrior]]'', a British anthology comic published by [[Quality Communications]]. The strip was one of the least popular in that title; editor/publisher [[Dez Skinn]] remarked, "If I’d have given each character their own title, the failures would have certainly outweighed the successes, with the uncompromising 'V for Vendetta' probably being an early casualty. But with five or six strips an issue, regular [readers] only needed two or three favorites to justify their buying the title."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harvey|first=Allan|date=June 2009|title=Blood and Sapphires: The Rise and Demise of Marvelman|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=34|page=71|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the publishers cancelled ''Warrior'' in 1985 (with two completed issues unpublished due to the cancellation), several companies attempted to convince Moore and Lloyd to let them publish and complete the story. In 1988, DC Comics published a ten-issue series that reprinted the ''Warrior'' stories in colour, then continued the series to completion. The first new material appeared in issue No. 7, which included the unpublished episodes that would have appeared in ''Warrior'' No. 27 and No. 28. [[Tony Weare]] drew one chapter ("Vincent") and contributed additional art to two others ("Valerie" and "The Vacation"); [[Steve Whitaker]] and Siobhan Dodds worked as [[Colorist|colourists]] on the entire series.

===Collected editions===
The entire series has appeared [[trade paperback (comics)|collected]] in paperback ({{ISBN|0-446-39190-5}}) and hardback ({{ISBN|1-4012-0792-8}}) form, including Moore's "Behind the Painted Smile" essay and two "interludes" outside the central continuity. Later collections include reissued paperbacks, published in the US by DC's [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]] imprint ({{ISBN|0-930289-52-8}}) and in the UK by [[Titan Books]] ({{ISBN|1-85286-291-2}}). A new hardback edition was published in 2005 featuring improved printing and coloring.&lt;ref name=AbsoluteV /&gt; In August 2009 DC published a [[slipcase]]d [[DC Comics Absolute Edition|Absolute Edition]] ({{ISBN|1-4012-2361-3}}); this includes newly coloured "silent art" pages (full-page panels containing no dialogue) from the series' original run, which have not previously appeared in any previous collected edition.&lt;ref name=AbsoluteV&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=19834 |title='Absolute V For Vendetta' to feature 100 additional pages at no extra cost |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525104512/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=19834 |archivedate=25 May 2010 |deadurl= |publisher=Comic Book Resources |date=February 3, 2009 |accessdate=5 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Background===

David Lloyd's paintings for ''V for Vendetta'' in ''Warrior'' first appeared in black and white.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/dec/27/v-for-vendetta-is-a-manual-for-rebellion-against-injustice|title=V for Vendetta is a manual for rebellion against injustice|first=David|last=Barnett|date=27 December 2016|website=the Guardian|accessdate=1 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180324135037/https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/dec/27/v-for-vendetta-is-a-manual-for-rebellion-against-injustice|archivedate=24 March 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Warrior19.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''Warrior'' #19, highlighting the comic's conflict between [[anarchism|anarchist]] and fascist philosophies.]]
In writing ''V for Vendetta'', Moore drew upon an idea for a strip titled ''The Doll'', which he had submitted in 1975 at the age of 22 to [[DC Thomson]]. In the essay "Behind the Painted Smile",&lt;ref name="Smile"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Moore, Alan|title=Behind the Painted Smile|journal=Warrior|year=1983|issue=17|authorlink=Alan Moore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Years later, Skinn reportedly invited Moore to create a dark mystery strip with artist David Lloyd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Brown, Adrian|year=2004|title=Headspace: Inside The Mindscape of Alan Moore|format=http|work=Ninth Art|url=http://www.ninthart.com/display.php?article=867|access-date=2006-04-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020110517/http://www.ninthart.com/display.php?article=867|archivedate=20 October 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''V for Vendetta'' was intended to recreate something similar to their popular [[Marvel UK]] [[Night Raven]] strip in a 1930s [[noir fiction|noir]].&lt;ref name=HeatherMacDonald-1&gt;{{cite interview |url=http://www.comicon.com/thebeat/2006/03/a_for_alan_pt_1_the_alan_moore.html |title=A for Alan, Part 1 |subject=Alan Moore |interviewer=Heather MacDonald |date=March 2006 |website=The Beat |publisher=Mile High Comics |accessdate=29 October 2018 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060404210249/http://www.comicon.com/thebeat/2006/03/a_for_alan_pt_1_the_alan_moore.html |archivedate=4 April 2006 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; They chose against doing historical research and instead set the story in the near future rather than the recent past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AEnVgVDd8m0C&amp;pg=PA74 |title=The Extraordinary Works of Alan Moore |author=Khoury, George |page=74 |accessdate=2018-06-02 |publisher=TwoMorrows |location=Raleigh, North Carolina |date=July 2003 |isbn=1-893905-24-1 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180602212643/https://books.google.com/books?id=AEnVgVDd8m0C&amp;pg=PA74 |archivedate=2 June 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then ''V for Vendetta'' emerged, putting the emphasis on "V" rather than "Vendetta". David Lloyd developed the idea of dressing V as [[Guy Fawkes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-16968689|title=Alan Moore on Anonymous' rise|first=Alan|last=Moore|date=8 March 2012|publisher=|accessdate=1 May 2018|via=www.bbc.co.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725005719/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-16968689|archivedate=25 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; after previous designs followed the conventional [[superhero]] look. During the preparation of the story, Moore made a list of what he wanted to bring into the plot, which he reproduced in "Behind the Painted Smile":&lt;blockquote&gt;[[George Orwell|Orwell]]. [[Aldous Huxley|Huxley]]. [[Thomas Disch]]. ''[[Judge Dredd]]''. [[Harlan Ellison]]'s ''[["Repent, Harlequin!" Said the Ticktockman]]'', ''Catman'' and ''[[The Prowler in the City at the Edge of the World]]'' by the same author. [[Vincent Price]]'s ''[[The Abominable Dr. Phibes|Dr. Phibes]]'' and ''[[Theatre of Blood]]''. [[David Bowie]]. ''[[The Shadow]]''. ''[[Night Raven]]''. ''[[Batman]]''. ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]''. The writings of the [[New Worlds (magazine)|New Worlds]] school of science fiction. [[Max Ernst]]'s painting "[[Europe After the Rain]]". [[Thomas Pynchon]]. The atmosphere of [[British cinema#World War II|British Second World War films]]. ''[[The Prisoner]]''. [[Robin Hood]]. [[Dick Turpin]]...&lt;ref name="Smile" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The influence of such a wide number of references has been thoroughly demonstrated in academic studies,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=V for vendetta as cultural pastiche|last=Keller|first=James R.|publisher=McFarland|year=2008|isbn=978-0-7864-3467-1|location=Jefferson}}&lt;/ref&gt; above which dystopian elements stand out, especially the similarity with George Orwell's ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' in several stages of the plot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four as an Influence on Popular Culture Works: V for Vendetta and 2024|last=Galdon Rodriguez|first=Angel|publisher=Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha|year=2011|location=Albacete}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The political climate of Britain in the early 1980s also influenced the work,&lt;ref name="Annotation"&gt;
{{cite web|author=Boudreaux, Madelyn|year=1994|title=Introduction|work=An Annotation of Literary, Historic and Artistic References in Alan Moore's Graphic Novel, "V for Vendetta"|url=http://madelyn.utahunderground.net/vendetta/vendetta1.html|access-date=6 April 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060308001244/http://madelyn.utahunderground.net/vendetta/vendetta1.html|archivedate=8 March 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Moore positing that [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government would "obviously lose the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983 elections]]", and that an incoming [[Michael Foot]]-led [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government, committed to [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament|complete nuclear disarmament]], would allow the United Kingdom to escape relatively unscathed after a limited [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]]. However, Moore felt that fascists would quickly subvert a post-holocaust Britain.&lt;ref name="Smile" /&gt; V, an anarchist, initially murders members of the fascist government, but as the story develops, Moore deliberately made V's actions "very, very morally ambiguous" with the aim that "I didn't want to tell people what to think, I just wanted to tell people to think."&lt;ref name=HeatherMacDonald-1 /&gt;

Moore's scenario remains untested. Addressing historical developments when DC reissued the work, he noted:&lt;blockquote&gt;Naïveté can also be detected in my supposition that it would take something as melodramatic as a near-miss nuclear conflict to nudge Britain towards fascism... The simple fact that much of the historical background of the story proceeds from a predicted Conservative defeat in the 1983 General Election should tell you how reliable we were in our roles as [[Cassandra]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Alan, Introduction. ''V for Vendetta''. New York: [[DC Comics]], 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reception==
The February 1999 issue of ''The Comics Journal'' ran a poll on "The Top 100 (English-Language) Comics of the Century": ''V for Vendetta'' reached 83rd place.&lt;ref&gt;The Comics Journal No. 210, February 1999, page 44&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed, if any --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
===Book 1: Europe After the Reign===
On [[Guy Fawkes Night]] in London in 1997, a financially desperate 16-year-old, [[Evey Hammond]], [[prostitutes|sexually solicits]] men who are actually members of the [[secret police|state secret police]], called "The Finger". Preparing to rape and kill her, the Fingermen are dispatched by [[V (comics)|V]], a cloaked anarchist wearing a mask, who later remotely detonates explosives at the [[Palace of Westminster|Houses]] of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] before bringing Evey to his [[contraband]]-filled underground lair, the "Shadow Gallery". Evey tells V her life story, which reveals that a global [[nuclear war]] in the late 1980s has since triggered the rise of England's fascist government, [[Norsefire]].

Meanwhile, Eric Finch, a veteran detective in charge of the regular police force—"the Nose"—begins investigating V's terrorist activities. Finch often communicates with Norsefire's other intelligence departments, including "the Finger," led by Derek Almond, and "the Head," embodied by &lt;!-- NOT Sutler:: --&gt;[[Adam Susan]]:&lt;!-- ::NOT Sutler --&gt; the reclusive government Leader, who obsessively oversees the government's ''Fate'' computer system. Finch's case thickens when V mentally deranges Lewis Prothero, a propaganda-broadcasting radio personality; [[forced suicide|forces the suicide]] of Bishop Anthony Lilliman, a &lt;!-- preserve Commonwealth English spelling: Paedophile, not Paedophile: START --&gt;[[paedophile]]&lt;!-- END preserve Commonwealth English spelling: paedophile, not paedophile: --&gt; priest; and prepares to murder Dr. Delia Surridge, a medical researcher who once had a romance with Finch. Finch suddenly discovers the connection among V's three targets: they all used to work at a former Norsefire "[[death camp|resettlement camp]]" near [[Larkhill]]. That night, V kills both Almond and Surridge, but Surridge has left a diary revealing that V—a former inmate and victim of Surridge's cruel medical experiments—was able to destroy and flee the camp, and is now eliminating the camp's former officers for what they did. Finch reports these findings to Susan, and suspects that this vendetta may actually be a cover for V, who, he worries, may be plotting an even bigger terrorist attack.

===Book 2: This Vicious Cabaret===
Four months later, V breaks into Jordan Tower, the home of Norsefire's propaganda department, "the Mouth"—led by Roger Dascombe—to broadcast a speech that calls on the people to resist the government. V escapes using an elaborate diversion that results in Dascombe's death. Finch is soon introduced to Peter Creedy, the new head of the Finger, who provokes Finch to strike him and thus get sent on a forced vacation. All this time, Evey has moved on with her life, becoming romantically involved with a much older man named Gordon. Evey and Gordon unknowingly cross paths with Rose Almond, the widow of the recently killed Derek. After Derek's death, Rose reluctantly began a relationship with Dascombe, but now, with both of her lovers murdered, she is forced to perform demoralizing burlesque work, increasing her hatred of the unsupportive government.

When a Scottish gangster named Ally Harper murders Gordon, a vengeful Evey interrupts a meeting between Harper and Creedy, the latter of whom is buying the support of Harper's thugs in preparation for a [[coup d'état]]. Evey attempts to shoot Harper, but is suddenly abducted and then imprisoned. Amidst interrogation and [[torture]], Evey finds an old letter hidden in her cell by an inmate named [[Valerie Page]], a film actress who was imprisoned and executed for being a lesbian.

Evey's interrogator finally gives her a choice of collaboration or death; inspired by Valerie, Evey refuses to collaborate, and, expecting to be executed, is instead told that she is free. Stunned, Evey learns that her supposed imprisonment is in fact a hoax constructed by V so that she could experience an ordeal similar to the one that shaped him at Larkhill. He reveals that Valerie was a real Larkhill prisoner who died in the cell next to his and that the letter is not a fake. Evey forgives V, who has hacked into the government's ''Fate'' computer system and started emotionally manipulating Adam Susan with [[mind games]]. Consequently, Susan, who has formed a bizarre romantic attachment to the computer, is beginning to descend into madness.

===Book 3: The Land of Do-As-You-Please===
The following 5 November (1998), V blows up the [[BT Tower|Post Office Tower]] and Jordan Tower, killing "the Ear" leader Brian Etheridge; in addition to effectively shutting down three government agencies: the Eye, the Ear, and the Mouth. Creedy's men and Harper's associated street gangs violently suppress the subsequent wave of revolutionary fervor from the public. V notes to Evey that he has not yet achieved what he calls the "[[The Magic Faraway Tree (novel)#Lands In the Book|Land of Do-as-You-Please]]", meaning a functional [[anarchy|anarchistic]] society, and considers the current [[chaos theory|chaotic]] situation an interim period of "[[The Enchanted Wood (novel)#Lands in the book|Land of Take-What-You-Want]]". Finch has been mysteriously absent and his young assistant, Dominic Stone, one day realises that V has been influencing the ''Fate'' computer all along, which would explain V's consistent foresight. All the while, Finch has been travelling to the abandoned site of Larkhill, where he takes [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] to conjure up memories of his own devastated past and to put his mind in the role of a prisoner of Larkhill, like V, to help give him an intuitive understanding of V's experiences. Returning to London, Finch suddenly deduces that V's lair is inside the abandoned [[London Victoria station|Victoria Station]], which he enters.

V takes Finch by surprise, resulting in a scuffle which sees Finch shoot V and V wound Finch with a knife. V claims that he cannot be killed since he is only an idea and that "ideas are bulletproof"; regardless, V is indeed mortally wounded and returns to the Shadow Gallery deeper within, dying in Evey's arms. Evey considers unmasking V, but decides not to, realising that V is not an identity but a symbol. She then assumes V's identity, donning one of his spare costumes. Finch sees the large amount of blood that V has left in his wake and deduces that he has mortally wounded V. Occurring concurrently to this, Creedy has been pressuring Susan to appear in public, hoping to leave him exposed. Sure enough, as Susan stops to shake hands with Rose during a parade, she shoots him in the head in vengeance for the death of her husband and the life she has had to lead since then. Following Rose's arrest, Creedy assumes emergency leadership of the country, and Finch emerges from the subway proclaiming V's death.

Due to his LSD-induced epiphany, Finch leaves his position within "the Nose". The power struggle between the remaining leaders results in all of their deaths: Harper betrays and kills Creedy at the behest of Helen Heyer (wife of "the Eye" leader Conrad Heyer, who had outbid Creedy for Harper's loyalty), and Harper and Conrad Heyer kill each other during a fight precipitated by Heyer's discovery that his wife Helen had had an affair with Harper.

With the fate of the top government officials unknown to the public, Stone acts as leader of the police forces deployed to ensure that the riots are contained should V still be alive and make his promised public announcement. Evey appears to a crowd, dressed as V, announcing the destruction of [[10 Downing Street]] the following day and telling the crowd they must ''"...choose what comes next. Lives of your own, or a return to chains"'', whereupon a general [[Insurgency|insurrection]] begins. Evey destroys 10 Downing Street&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=[[Alan Moore|Moore, Alan]]|penciller=[[David Lloyd (comics)|Lloyd, David]]|story=V for Vendetta|title=V for Vendetta|volume=10|date=May 1989|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|page=28|panel=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; by blowing up an [[London Underground|Underground]] train containing V's body, in the style of an explosive [[Viking funeral]]. She abducts Stone, apparently to train him as her successor. The book ends with Finch quietly observing the chaos raging in the city and walking down an abandoned motorway whose lights have all gone out.

==Themes and motifs==
The two conflicting political viewpoints of [[anarchism]] and [[fascism]] dominate the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.infoshop.org/article.php?story=2007alan-moore-interview|title=Authors on Anarchism&amp;nbsp;— an Interview with Alan Moore|work=Strangers in a Tangled Wilderness|publisher=Infoshop.org|access-date=2 May 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912195057/http://news.infoshop.org/article.php?story=2007alan-moore-interview|archivedate=12 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore stated in an interview that V is designed as an enigma, as Moore "didn't want to tell people what to think" but wanted them to consider some extreme events that have recurred throughout history.&lt;ref name=HeatherMacDonald-1 /&gt;

==Adaptations==
===Film===
{{Main|V for Vendetta (film)}}

In December 2005 Warner Bros. released a feature-film adaptation of ''V for Vendetta'', directed by [[James McTeigue]] from a screenplay by the [[Wachowskis]]. [[Natalie Portman]] stars as Evey Hammond and [[Hugo Weaving]] as V.&lt;ref name="boxofficemojo"&gt;{{cite web | publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] | title=V for Vendetta (2006) | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=main&amp;id=vforvendetta.htm | accessdate=October 2, 2005 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606215126/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=main&amp;id=vforvendetta.htm | archivedate=6 June 2011 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alan Moore distanced himself from the film, as he has with other [[Alan Moore#Film adaptations|screen adaptation]] of his works. He ended co-operation with his publisher, DC Comics, after its corporate parent, [[Warner Bros.]], failed to retract statements about Moore's supposed endorsement of the movie.&lt;ref name="slam"&gt;{{cite web|title=Moore Slams V for Vendetta Movie, Pulls LoEG from DC Comics|date=22 April 2006|work=[[Comic Book Resources]]|url=http://comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=14937|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DbYMbh7B?url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article|archivedate=12 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After reading the script, Moore remarked:
{{bquote|[The movie] has been "turned into a [[George W. Bush|Bush]]-era parable by people too timid to set a [[political satire]] in their own country. ... It's a thwarted and frustrated and largely impotent American liberal fantasy of someone with American liberal values standing up against a state run by [[neoconservative]]s – which is not what the comic ''V for Vendetta'' was about. It was about fascism, it was about anarchy, it was about England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=MTV|year=2006|title=Alan Moore: The last angry man|work=MTV.com|url=http://www.mtv.com/shared/movies/interviews/m/moore_alan_060315|access-date=August 30, 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901005535/http://www.mtv.com/shared/movies/interviews/m/moore_alan_060315/|archivedate=1 September 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He later adds that if the Wachowskis had wanted to protest about what was going on in the United States, then they should have used a political narrative that directly addressed the issues of the USA, similar to what Moore had done before with Britain. The film arguably changes the original message by having removed any reference to actual [[anarchism]] in the revolutionary actions of V. An interview with producer [[Joel Silver]] reveals that he identifies the V of the comics as a clear-cut "superhero... a masked avenger who pretty much saves the world," a simplification that goes against Moore's own statements about V's role in the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Douglas, Edward|year=2006|title=V for Vendetta's Silver Lining|work=Comingsoon.net|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=13588|access-date=6 April 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DbYQHCWm?url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=13588|archivedate=12 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Co-author and illustrator David Lloyd, by contrast, embraced the adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=V at Comic Con|url=http://pdl.warnerbros.com/wbmovies/vforvendetta/comiccon_text.html|access-date=2006-04-06|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507074202/http://pdl.warnerbros.com/wbmovies/vforvendetta/comiccon_text.html|archivedate=7 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''[[Newsarama]]'' he states:{{bquote|It's a terrific film. The most extraordinary thing about it for me was seeing scenes that I'd worked on and crafted for maximum effect in the book translated to film with the same degree of care and effect. The "transformation" scene between Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving is just great. If you happen to be one of those people who admires the original so much that changes to it will automatically turn you off, then you may dislike the film—but if you enjoyed the original and can accept an adaptation that is different to its source material but equally as powerful, then you'll be as impressed as I was with it.&lt;ref&gt;

===Television series===
In October 2017, it was announced that [[Channel 4]] was developing a television series based on the comic book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Rich|title=SCOOP: Channel 4 Developing A ‘V For Vendetta’ TV Series|url=https://www.bleedingcool.com/2017/10/04/scoop-channel-4-v-for-vendetta-tv-series/|website=BleedingCool.com|date=4 October 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005051453/https://www.bleedingcool.com/2017/10/04/scoop-channel-4-v-for-vendetta-tv-series/|archivedate=5 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the release of the film adaptation, hundreds of thousands of [[Guy Fawkes mask]]s from the books and film have been sold every year since the film's release,  as of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Story and Symbol: V for Vendetta and OWS |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/how-fantasy-becomes-reality/201111/story-and-symbol-v-vendetta-and-ows |work=[[Psychology Today]] |date=November 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Time Warner]] owns the rights to the image and is paid a fee with the sale of each official mask.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2011/08/29/how-time-warner-profits-from-the-anonymous-hackers/| title=How Time Warner Profits from the 'Anonymous' Hackers| last=Carbone| first=Nick| work=Time| date=29 August 2011| accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nickbilton"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bilton|first=Nick|title=Masked Protesters Aid Time Warner's Bottom Line|work=The New York Times|date=28 August 2011|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/29/technology/masked-anonymous-protesters-aid-time-warners-profits.html|accessdate=20 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]], an Internet-based group, has adopted the [[Guy Fawkes mask]] as their symbol (in reference to an [[Internet meme]]). Members wore such masks, for example, during [[Project Chanology]]'s protests against the [[Church of Scientology]] in 2008. [[Alan Moore]] had this to say about the use of the Guy Fawkes motif adopted from his comic ''V for Vendetta'', in an interview with ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'':
{{bquote|I was also quite heartened the other day when watching the news to see that there were demonstrations outside the Scientology headquarters over here, and that they suddenly flashed to a clip showing all these demonstrators wearing ''V for Vendetta'' Guy Fawkes masks. That pleased me. That gave me a warm little glow.&lt;ref&gt;

According to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', the protesters' adoption of the mask has led to it becoming the top-selling mask on [[Amazon.com]], selling hundreds of thousands a year.&lt;ref&gt;

On 23 May 2009, protesters dressed up as V and set off a fake barrel of gunpowder outside Parliament while protesting over the [[United Kingdom Parliamentary expenses scandal|issue of British MPs' expenses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8065335.stm|title=News report|publisher=BBC News|date=23 May 2009|access-date=23 August 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090529080515/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8065335.stm|archivedate=29 May 2009|df=dmy-all}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7312">The '''Venetic theory''' ({{lang-sl|venetska teorija}}) is an [[autochthonist]] theory of the origin of the [[Slovenes]] that denies the [[Slavic settlement of the Eastern Alps]] in the 6th century, claiming that proto-Slovenes (also regarded as the [[Adriatic Veneti|Veneti]] people by the proponents of this theory) have inhabited the region since ancient times. Although it has been rejected by scholars,&lt;ref name=Lencek&gt;Rado Lencek. 1990. "The Linguistic Premises of Matej Bor's Slovene-Venetic Theory." ''Slovene Studies'' 12(1): 75-86;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Priestly&gt;Tom Priestly. 1997. "Vandals, Veneti, Windischer: The Pitfalls of Amateur Historical Linguistics." ''Slovene Studies'' 12(1/2): 3-41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tom Priestly. 2001. "Vandali, Veneti, Vindišarji: pasti amaterske historične lingvistike." ''Slavistična revija'' 49:275-303.&lt;/ref&gt; it has been an influential alternative explanation of the Slovenian [[ethnogenesis]]. During the 1980s and 1990s, it gained wide attention in [[Slovenia]] and the [[former Yugoslavia]].  

A version of this theory states that most of Central Europe and portions of today's northern Turkey were originally inhabited by a single people - the Veneti - a people that were subsequently dispersed by several invasion from the North in the form of Celtic and Germanic migrations and by the push northwards of the Roman Empire.  According to this variant, the Armorican Veneti, the Adriatic Veneti, the Vistula Veneti as well as portion of the Illyrians and the Veneti of northern Turkey were all related people who spoke the same or similar language.  The theory also counts among the Veneti several peoples of North Spain, Northern coastal France as well as portions of Denmark, Wales and of Ireland.  In this version, most of the northern Slavs as well as the Slovenes and some Croats are the last remnant the original European Veneti.     

== Background ==
The theory was advanced in the mid 1980s by a group of [[Slovenia]]n authors, notably [[Jožko Šavli]], [[Matej Bor]] and [[Ivan Tomažič]]. In a book published in 1984, the three authors proposed an alternative view on the ethnogenesis of the Slovene people: they rejected the notion that the Slovenes were descended from [[Slavs]] that settled the area in the 6th century, claiming that the ancestors of the modern Slovenes were in fact a pre-Roman people they call Veneti (which would include the [[Adriatic Veneti]], the [[Baltic Veneti]], the [[Pannonians]], the [[Noricum|Noricans]] and some other peoples that traditional historiography identified either as [[Celts]] or [[Illyrians]]). According to the Venetic theory, the ancient Veneti spoke a [[proto-Slavic]] language from which modern Slovene and [[West Slavic languages]] emerged.

There were several similar antecedents to the Venetic theory. The priest [[Davorin Trstenjak]] (1817–1890) claimed that the Slovenes were ancient indigenous inhabitants of Slovenia and that Slavs had ruled Europe, Africa, and Asia in antiquity; however, he gave up these claims after he found they were scientifically untenable. The lawyer [[Henrik Tuma]] (1858–1935) declared that the Slovenes had been the first humans to settle Europe. The writer and journalist [[Franc Jeza]] (1916–1984) asserted that the Slovenes had Swedish origins.&lt;ref name="Skrbis"&gt;Skrbiš, Zlatko. 2008. "'The First Europeans' Fantasy of Slovenian Venetologists." In: Maruška Svašek (ed.), ''Postsocialism: Politics and Emotion in Central and Eastern Europe,'' pp. 138–158. New York: Berghahn Books.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|142}}

==Premises==
The Venetic theory is based on several different arguments. One is the traditional [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] denomination of several [[Slavic people]]s as [[Wends]] ([[Proto-Germanic]] *Wénethōz &gt; {{lang-de|Wenden, Winden}}); this tradition has remained in the archaic German name for the [[Sorbs]] (''Wenden'') and Slovenes (''Windischen'' or ''Winden''). Some medieval chroniclers also equated ancient Veneti with Slavs. The second argument on which the theory is based are supposed Slavic (proto-Slovene) [[toponyms]] found throughout [[Central Europe]] and [[Northern Italy]]; these toponyms have been studied by Šavli. The third argument is based on the ancient Venetic inscriptions found in [[Triveneto|North-Eastern Italy]] and in the [[Slovenian Littoral]], which Bor interpreted as being Slavic.

==Reception==
The Venetic theory created a great controversy in the Slovenian and Yugoslav public in the late 1980s. Several of the most prominent Slovenian historians, such as [[Bogo Grafenauer]] and [[Peter Štih]], entered into open polemics with the creators of the theory. On the other hand, many prominent public figures publicly supported the claims advanced by the Venetic theory, among them the designer [[Oskar Kogoj]], authors [[Zorko Simčič]] and [[Lucijan Vuga]], and politician [[Zmago Jelinčič Plemeniti]]. In the 1990s, the theory gained institutional support of the [[World Slovenian Congress]], publishing much of the literature advocating the theory and organizing international symposiums. The theory has also gained support in some nationalist circles. However, the theory has been challenged by certain writers,&lt;ref name="Skrbis"/&gt;{{rp|145}} and it has been rejected by both mainstream linguists&lt;ref name=Lencek/&gt;&lt;ref name=Priestly/&gt; and historians.&lt;ref&gt;Plut-Pregelj, Leopoldina, &amp; Carole Rogel. 2010.

'''William Tell''' (in the four languages of Switzerland: {{lang-de|Wilhelm Tell}}; {{lang-fr|Guillaume Tell}}; {{lang-it|Guglielmo Tell}}; {{lang-rm|Guglielm Tell}}) is a [[folk hero]] of [[Switzerland]]. 
According to the legend, Tell was an expert marksman with the [[crossbow]] who assassinated [[Albrecht Gessler]], a tyrannical [[Vogt (Switzerland)|reeve]] of the [[Duchy_of_Austria#House_of_Habsburg|Habsburg dukes]] positioned in [[Altdorf, Uri|Altdorf]], in the [[canton of Uri]]. Tell's defiance and [[tyrannicide]] encouraged the population to  [[Burgenbruch|open rebellion]] and a [[Rütlischwur|pact]] against the foreign rulers with neighbouring [[Schwyz]] and [[Unterwalden]], marking the [[foundation of the Old Swiss Confederacy|foundation of the Swiss Confederacy]].
 
Set in the early 14th century (traditional date 1307, during the rule of [[Albert I of Germany|Albert of Habsburg]]), the first written records of the legend date to the latter part of the 15th century, when the [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss Confederacy]] was gaining military and political influence.
Tell is a central figure in [[Historiography of Switzerland#Building a national history|Swiss national historiography]], along with [[Arnold von Winkelried]] the hero of [[Battle of Sempach|Sempach]] (1386). He was important as a symbol during the formative stage of [[Switzerland as a federal state|modern Switzerland]] in the 19th century, known as the period of [[Restoration and Regeneration in Switzerland#Restoration|Restoration and Regeneration]], as well as in the wider history of 18th- to 19th-century Europe as a symbol of resistance against aristocratic rule, especially in the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire|Revolutions of 1848]] against a [[House of Habsburg]] which still [[Austrian Empire|ruled Austria]] five hundred years later.

== Legend ==
[[File:Stückelberg Tellensprung 1879.jpg|thumb|Tell's leap (''Tellensprung'') from the boat of his captors at the Axen cliffs; study by [[Ernst Stückelberg (painter)|Ernst Stückelberg]] (1879) for his fresco at the [[Tellskapelle]].]]
[[File:Weisses Buch von Sarnen 447.jpg|thumb|upright|Page of the ''White Book of Sarnen'' (p. 447, first page of the Tell legend, pp. 447&amp;ndash;449).]]
The first reference to Tell, as yet without a specified given name,  appears in the ''[[White Book of Sarnen]]'' (German: ''Weisses Buch von Sarnen''). This volume was written in c. 1474 by Hans Schriber,  state secretary (''Landschreiber'') [[Obwalden]]. 
It mentions the [[Rütlischwur|Rütli oath]] (German: ''Rütlischwur'') and names Tell as one of the [[Eidgenossen|conspirators]] of the Rütli, whose heroic [[tyrannicide]] triggered the [[Burgenbruch]] rebellion.&lt;ref name="bergier_63"&gt;Bergier, p&amp;nbsp;63.&lt;/ref&gt;

An equally early account of Tell is found in the ''[[Tellenlied]]'', a song composed in the 1470s, with its oldest extant manuscript copy dating to 1501. The song begins with the Tell legend, which it presents as the origin of the Confederacy, calling Tell the "first [[Eidgenossenschaft|confederate]]". The narrative includes Tell's [[Shooting an apple off one's child's head|apple shot]], his preparation of a second arrow to shoot Gessler, and his escape, but it does not mention any assassination of Gessler.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[[Rochus von Liliencron]], ''Historische Volkslieder der Deutschen'', vol. 2 (1866), no. 147, cited by Rochholz (1877), p. 187; c.f. Bergier, p.&amp;nbsp;70–71.&lt;/ref&gt;
The text then enumerates the cantons of the Confederacy, and says was expanded with "current events" during the course of the [[Burgundian Wars|Burgundy Wars]], ending with the death of [[Charles the Bold]] in 1477.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

[[Aegidius Tschudi]], writing c. 1570, presents an extended version of the legend. Still essentially based on  the account in the ''White Book'', Tschudi adds further detail.
Tschudi is known to habitually have "fleshed out" his sources, so that all detail from Tschudi not found in the earlier accounts may be suspected of being Tschudi's invention.&lt;ref name="eb11th"&gt;Chrisholm, Hugh (Ed.): ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]]'', 1911. Article "[https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri27chisrich#page/348/mode/2up Tschudi]". URL last accessed 2011-08-26.&lt;/ref&gt;
Such additional detail includes Tell's given name Wilhelm, and his being a native of [[Bürglen, Uri]] in the [[Schächental]],   the precise date of the apple-shot, given as  18 November 1307 as well as the account of Tell's death in 1354.
 
It is Tschudi's version that became influential in [[early modern Switzerland]] and entered public consciousness as the "William Tell" legend. According to Tschudi's account, William Tell was known as a strong man, a mountain climber, and an expert shot with the [[crossbow]]. In his time, the [[House of Habsburg]] emperors of Austria were seeking to dominate Uri, and Tell became one of the [[Rütlischwur|conspirators]] of [[Werner Stauffacher]] who vowed to resist Habsburg rule. [[Albrecht Gessler]] was the newly appointed Austrian ''[[Vogt]]'' of [[Altdorf, Switzerland]]. He raised a pole under the village [[Gerichtslinde|lindentree]], hung his hat on top of it, and demanded that all the townsfolk bow before it.

In Tschudi's account, on 18 November 1307, Tell visited Altdorf with his young son. He passed by the hat, but publicly refused to bow to it, and was consequently arrested. Gessler was intrigued by Tell's famed marksmanship, but resentful of his defiance, so he devised a cruel punishment. Tell and his son were both to be executed; however, he could redeem his life by shooting an apple off the head of his son Walter in a single attempt. Tell split the apple with a [[Crossbow#Projectiles|bolt]] from his crossbow. Gessler then noticed that Tell had removed two crossbow bolts from his quiver, so he asked why. Tell was reluctant to answer, but Gessler promised that he would not kill him; he replied that, had he killed his son, he would have killed Gessler with the second bolt. Gessler was furious and ordered Tell to be bound, saying that he had promised to spare his life, but would imprison him for the remainder of his life.

Tschudi's continues that Tell was being carried in Gessler's boat to the dungeon in the castle at [[Küssnacht]] when a storm broke on [[Lake Lucerne]], and the guards were afraid that their boat would sink. They begged Gessler to remove Tell's shackles so that he could take the helm and save them. Gessler gave in, but Tell steered the boat to a rocky place and leaped out. The site is known in the "White Book" as the "Tellsplatte" ("Tell's slab"); it has been marked by a [[Tellskapelle|memorial chapel]] since the 16th century. Tell ran cross-country to Küssnacht with Gessler in pursuit. Tell assassinated him using the second crossbow bolt, along a stretch of the road cut through the rock between Immensee and Küssnacht, which is known as the ''Hohle Gasse.''&lt;ref&gt;{{HDS|8792|Hohle Gasse}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tell's act sparked a [[Burgenbruch|rebellion]], which led to the [[Growth of the Old Swiss Confederacy#Nucleus|formation of the Old Swiss Confederacy]].&lt;ref name="meyers"&gt;[[Meyers Konversations-Lexikon]], Verlag des Bibliographischen Instituts, Leipzig und Wien, Fourth edition, 1885–1892, entry on "[http://www.retrobibliothek.de/retrobib/seite.html?id=115594#Tell Tell], [http://www.retrobibliothek.de/retrobib/seite.html?id=115595 Wilhelm]," pp. 576–77 in volume 15. In German.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tschudi, Tell fought again against Austria in the 1315 [[Battle of Morgarten]]. Tschudi also has an account of Tell's death in 1354, according to which he was killed trying to save a child from drowning in the [[Schächental]] River in Uri.&lt;ref name="meyers" /&gt;

==Early modern reception==
=== Chronicles ===
[[File:Tell Deutsch Münster 1554.jpg|thumb|A depiction of the [[apple-shot]] scene in [[Cosmographia (Sebastian Münster)|Sebastian Münster's ''Cosmographia'']] (1554 edition).]]
There are a number of sources for the Tell legend later than the earliest account in the ''White Book of Sarnen'' but earlier than Tschud's version of ca. 1570.

These include the account in the chronicle of [[Melchior Russ]] from [[Lucerne]]. Dated to 1482, this is an incoherent compilation of older writings, including the ''Song of the Founding of the Confederation'', [[Conrad Justinger]]'s ''[[Bernese Chronicle]],'' and the ''Chronicle of the State of Bern'' (in German, ''Chronik der Stadt Bern'').&lt;ref name="bergier_76"&gt;Bergier, p.&amp;nbsp;76.&lt;/ref&gt;
Another early account is in [[Petermann Etterlin]]'s ''[[Chronicle of the Swiss Confederation]]'' (German: ''Kronika von der loblichen Eydtgenossenschaft'') of 1507, the earliest printed version of the Tell story.&lt;ref name="bergier_77"&gt;Bergier, p.&amp;nbsp;77.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Chronicon Helveticum]]'' was compiled by [[Aegidius Tschudi]] of [[Glarus]] in the years leading up to his death in early 1572. 
For more than 150 years, it existed only in manuscript form, before finally being edited in  1734–1736. Therefore there is no clear "date of publication" of the chronicle, and its date of composition can only be given approximately, as "ca. 1570", or "before 1572". It is Tschudi's account of the legend, however, which became the major model for later writers, even prior to its edition in print in the 1730s,&lt;ref name="bergier_16"&gt;Bergier, p.&amp;nbsp;16.&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Popular veneration ===
[[File:Hohle Gasse.jpeg|thumb|upright|The ''Hohle Gasse'' between [[Immensee (village)|Immensee]] and [[Küssnacht]], with a second ''Tellskapelle'' (built in 1638).]]
A widespread veneration of Tell, including sight-seeing excursions to the scenes of his deeds, can be ascertained for the early 16th century.
Heinrich Brennwald in the early 16th century mentions the chapel (''Tellskapelle'') on the site of Tell's leap from his captors' boat. Tschudi mentions a "holy cottage" (''heilig hüslin'') built on the site of Gessler's assassination. [[Peter Hagendorf]], a soldier in the [[Thirty Years' War]], mentions a visit to 'the chapel where William Tell escaped' in his diary.&lt;ref&gt;Helfferich, Tryntje, The Thirty Years War: A Documentary History (Cambridge, 2009), p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recorded [[Tellspiel|Tell play]] (''Tellspiel''), known as the ''[[Urner Tellspiel]]'' ("Tell Play of Uri"),&lt;ref name="head_528"&gt;Head, p.&amp;nbsp;528.&lt;/ref&gt; was probably performed in the winter of either 1512 or 1513 in [[Altdorf, Uri|Altdorf]].&lt;ref name="bergier_76" /&gt;

The church of Bürglen had a bell dedicated to Tell from 1581, and a nearby chapel has a fresco dated to 1582 showing Tell's death in the Schächenbach.&lt;ref name="befreiungstradition"&gt;{{HDS|17474|Liberation myths|author=Kaiser, P.|date=2002-05-20}} URL last accessed 6 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Three Tells ===
The Three Tells (''die Drei Tellen'', also ''die Drei Telle'') were symbolic figures of the [[Swiss Peasant War]] of 1653. They expressed the hope of the subject population to repeat the success story of the rebellion against Habsburg in the early 14th century.

By the 18th century, the Drei Tellen had become associated with a [[sleeping hero]] legend. They were said to be asleep in a cave at the [[Rigi]]. The return of Tell in times of need was already foretold in the Tellenlied of 1653 and symbolically fulfilled in the impersonation of the Three Tells by costumed individuals, in one instance culminating in an actual assassination executed by these impersonators in historical costume.

Tell during the 16th century had become closely associated and eventually merged with the [[Rütlischwur]] legend, and the "Three Tells" represented the three conspirators or ''[[Eidgenossen]]'' Walter Fürst, Arnold von Melchtal and [[Werner Stauffacher]].

In 1653, three men dressed in historical costume representing the Three Tells appeared in [[Schüpfheim]]. Other impersonations of the Three Tells also appeared in the [[Freie Ämter]] and in the [[Emmental]].

The first impersonators of the Three Tells were Hans Zemp, Kaspar Unternährer of Schüpfheim and Ueli Dahinden of [[Hasle, Lucerne|Hasle]]. They appeared at a number of important peasant conferences during the war, symbolizing the continuity of the present rebellion with the resistance movement against the Habsburg overlords at the origin of the [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss Confederacy]]. Unternährer and Dahinden fled to the [[Entlebuch]] alps before the arrival of the troops of general Sebastian Peregrin Zwyers; Zemp escaped to the [[Alsace]]. After the suppression of the rebellion, the peasants voted for a [[tyrannicide]], directly inspired by the Tell legend, attempting to kill the Lucerne [[Schultheiss]] Ulrich Dulliker.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{HDS|14515|Drei Tellen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dahinden and Unternährer returned in their roles of Tells, joined by Hans Stadelmann replacing Zemp. In an ambush, they managed to injure Dulliker and killed a member of the Lucerne parliament, Caspar Studer. The assassination attempt — an exceptional act in the culture of the Old Swiss Confederacy — was widely recognized and welcomed among the peasant population, but its impact was not sufficient to rekindle the rebellion.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

Even though it did not have any direct political effect, its symbolic value was considerable, placing the Lucerne authorities in the role of the tyrant (Habsburg and Gessler) and the peasant population in that of the freedom fighters (Tell). The Three Tells after the deed went to mass, still wearing their costumes, without being molested. Dahinden and Unternährer were eventually killed in October 1653 by Lucerne troops under Colonel Alphons von Sonnenberg. In July 1654, Zemp betrayed his successor Stadelmann in exchange for pardon and Stadelmann was executed on 15 July 1654.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

The Three Tells appear in a 1672 comedy by Johann Caspar Weissenbach.
The "sleeping hero" version of the Three Tells legend was published in ''[[Deutsche Sagen]]'' by the [[Brothers Grimm]] in 1816 (no. 298).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gutenberg.spiegel.de/?id=5&amp;xid=970&amp;kapitel=300#gb_found|title=von - Text im Projekt Gutenberg|first=SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg,|last=Germany|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wilhelm Tell Denkmal Altdorf um 1900 Detail.jpg|thumb|Detail from the [[Tell Monument|Statue of William Tell]] and his son in [[Altdorf, Uri|Altdorf]] ([[Richard Kissling]], 1895).]]

Throughout the [[long nineteenth century]], and into the [[World War II]] period, Tell was perceived as a symbol of rebellion against tyranny both in Switzerland and in Europe.

[[Antoine-Marin Lemierre]] wrote a play inspired by Tell in 1766 and revived it in 1786. The success of this work established the association of Tell as a fighter against tyranny with the history of the [[French Revolution]].
The French revolutionary fascination with Tell was reflected in Switzerland with the establishment of the [[Helvetic Republic]]. Tell became, as it were, the mascot of the short-lived republic, his figure being featured on its official seal. The French Navy also had a [[Tonnant class ship of the line|''Tonnant'' class]] [[ship of the line]] named ''[[French ship Guillaume Tell (1795)|Guillaume Tell]]'', which was captured by the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Royal Navy]] in 1800.

Tschudi's ''[[Chronicon Helveticum]]'' continued to be taken at face value  as a historiographical source well into the 19th century, 
so that Tschudi's version of the legend is not only used as a model in [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s play ''[[William Tell (play)|William Tell]]'' (1804)
but is also reported in historiographical works of the time, including [[Johannes von Müller]]'s ''History of the Swiss Confederation'' (German: ''Geschichte Schweizerischer Eidgenossenschaft'', 1780).&lt;ref name="bergier_16" /&gt; 

[[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] learned of the Tell saga during his travels through Switzerland between 1775 and 1795. He obtained a copy of Tschudi's chronicles and considered writing a play about Tell, but ultimately gave the idea to his friend [[Friedrich von Schiller]], who in 1803–04 wrote the play ''[[William Tell (play)|Wilhelm Tell]],'' first performed on 17 March 1804, in [[Weimar]]. 
Schiller's Tell is heavily inspired by the political events of the late 18th century, the [[French Revolution|French]] and [[American Revolution|American revolution]]s, in particular. Schiller's play was performed at [[Interlaken]] (the ''[[Tellspiele]]'') in the summers of 1912 to 1914, 1931 to 1939 and every year since 1947. In 2004 it was first performed in [[Altdorf, Uri|Altdorf]] itself.

[[Gioachino Rossini]] used Schiller's play as the basis for his 1829 [[opera]] ''[[William Tell (opera)|William Tell]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-06-21/features/9102250080_1_swiss-gessler-altdorf|title=William Tell: Fact Or Legend?|work=tribunedigital-chicagotribune|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[William Tell Overture]]'' is one of his best-known and most frequently imitated pieces of music; in the 20th century, the "coda" of the ''Overture'' became the theme for the radio, television, and motion picture incarnations of [[The Lone Ranger (TV series)|The Lone Ranger]], a fictional [[American frontier]] hero.

In 1836 the first [[German playing cards#William Tell|William Tell patterned playing cards]] were produced in Pest, Hungary. They were inspired by Schiller's play and made during tense relations with the ruling Habsburgs. The cards became popular throughout the [[Austrian Empire]] during the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire|Revolution of 1848]].

In 1858, the Swiss Colonization Society, a group of Swiss and German immigrants to the United States, founded its first (and only) planned city on the banks of the Ohio River in [[Perry County, Indiana]]. The town was originally dubbed Helvetia, but was quickly changed to [[Tell City, Indiana|Tell City]] to honor the legendary Swiss hero. The city became known for its manufacturing, especially of fine wood furniture. William Tell and symbols of an apple with an arrow through it are prominent in the town, which includes a bronze statue of Tell and his son, based on the one in Altdorf, Switzerland. The statue was erected on a fountain in front of city hall in 1974. [[Tell City High School]] uses these symbols in its crest or logo, and the sports teams are called "The Marksmen." The William Tell Overture is often played by the school's pep band at high school games. Each August since 1958, Tell City's centennial year, the town has held "Schweizer Fest," a community festival of entertainment, stage productions, historical presentations, carnival rides, beer garden, sporting events and class reunions, to honor its Swiss-German heritage. Many of the activities occur on the grounds of City Hall and Main Street, at the feet of the Tell statue.

[[John Wilkes Booth]], the assassin of [[Abraham Lincoln]], was inspired by Tell. Lamenting the negative reaction to his action, Booth wrote in his journal on 21 April 1865 "with every man's hand against me, I am here in despair. And why; For doing what [[Marcus Junius Brutus|Brutus]] was honored for and what made Tell a Hero. And yet I for striking down a greater tyrant than they ever knew am looked upon as a common cutthroat."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=9Jbg7Xbrb8EC&amp;pg=PA216&amp;lpg=PA216&amp;dq=John+Wilkes+Booth+was+inspired+by+william+Tell+and+Brutus&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SuZzii7Q1W&amp;sig=Hz7sw85G8vSZ6yb7oqfxIrm4AE0&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=John%20Wilkes%20Booth%20was%20inspired%20by%20william%20Tell%20and%20Brutus&amp;f=false|title=Perspectives on Politics in Shakespeare|last=Murley|first=John Albert|last2=Sutton|first2=Sean D.|date=2006|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=9780739116845|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;(He himself was shot to death, without standing trial, days later.)

Following a national competition, won by [[Richard Kissling]], Altdorf in 1895 erected a monument to its hero. Kissling casts Tell as a peasant and man of the mountains, with strong features and muscular limbs. His powerful hand rests lovingly on the shoulder of little Walter, but the apple is not shown. The depiction is in marked contrast with that used by the Helvetic Republic, where Tell is shown as a [[landsknecht]] rather than a peasant, with a sword at his belt and a feathered hat, bending down to pick up his son who is still holding the apple.

The first film about Tell was made by French director [[Charles Pathé]] in 1900; only a short fragment survives.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}&lt;br /&gt;
A version of the legend was retold in [[P.G. Wodehouse]]'s ''[[William Tell Told Again]]'' (1904), written in prose and verse with characteristic Wodehousian flair.
The design of the Federal [[Swiss Franc|5 francs coin]] issued from 1922 features the bust of a generic "mountain shepherd" designed by [[Paul Burkard]], but due to a similarity of the bust with Kissling's statue, in spite of the missing beard, it was immediately widely identified as Tell.

[[Adolf Hitler]] was enthusiastic about Schiller's play, quoting it in his ''[[Mein Kampf]],'' and approving of a German/Swiss co-production of the play in which [[Hermann Göring]]'s mistress [[Emmy Sonnemann]] appeared as Tell's wife. However, on 3 June 1941, Hitler had the play banned. The reason for the ban is not known, but may have been related to the failed assassination attempt on Hitler in 1938 by young Swiss [[Maurice Bavaud]]&lt;ref name="dpa_2004_05_11"&gt;[[Deutsche Presse-Agentur|dpa]]: ''[http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2004/05/11/293445.html Hitler verbot Schillers "Tell"],'' news agency announcement of a speech by [[Rolf Hochhuth]], May 11, 2004.

[[File:Wilhelm Tell na igraćim kartama.jpg|thumb|William Tell depicted on playing cards]]
In Switzerland, the importance of Tell had declined somewhat by the end of the 19th century, outside of [[Altdorf, Uri|Altdorf]] and [[Interlaken]] which established their tradition of performing Schiller's play in regular intervals in 1899 and 1912, respectively. 
During the [[Switzerland during the World Wars|World Wars]], Tell was again revived, somewhat artificially, as a national symbol. 
For example, in 1923 the [[Swiss Post]] introduced horns for their [[PostBus Switzerland|coach service]] based on the overture of  Rossini's ''Tell'' opera, 
and in 1931, the image of a crossbow was introduced as a logo indicating [[Swiss made|Swiss products]]. The ''Tell-Museum'' in [[Bürglen, Uri]], opened in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;de Capitani (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Protests of 1968|1968]], with ideological shift of academic mainstream from a [[classical liberal|liberal]]-[[Radicalism (historical)|radical]] to a [[deconstructivist]] [[leftist]] 
outlook, [[Historiography of Switzerland|Swiss historians]] were looking to dismantle the foundational legends of Swiss statehood as unhistorical [[national myth]].
[[Max Frisch]]'s "William Tell for Schools" (1971) deconstructs the legend by reversing the characters of the protagonists: Gessler is a well-meaning and patient administrator who is faced with the barbarism of a back-corner of the empire, while Tell is an irascible simpleton.&lt;ref&gt;[[Adolf Muschg]], [http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-43144412.html Apfelschuß war nicht verlangt], ''Spiegel'' 9 August 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;
Tell still remains a popular figure in Swiss culture.  According to a 2004 survey, a majority of Swiss believed that he actually existed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120713092707/http://news.search.ch/wirtschaft/2004-04-27/hat-tell-tatsaechlich-gelebt According to a 2004 survey of 620 participants performed by the ''LINK-Institut'' of Lucerne for ''Coopzeitung.'' 58% of those asked held that Tell was historical, compared to 29% who held that Tell was unhistorical.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historicity debate ==
[[File:Schranktür 1782 Tell.jpg|thumb|A 1782 depiction of Tell in the [[Schweizerisches Landesmuseum]], Zürich.]]

The [[historicity]] of William Tell has been subject to debate. François Guillimann, a statesman of [[Fribourg]] and later historian and advisor of the Habsburg Emperor [[Rudolph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolph II]], wrote to [[Melchior Goldast]] in 1607: "I followed popular belief by reporting certain details in my ''Swiss antiquities'' [published in 1598], but when I examine them closely the whole story seems to me to be pure fable."

In 1760, Simeon Uriel Freudenberger from [[Luzern]] anonymously published a tract arguing that the legend of Tell in all likelihood was based on the Danish saga of [[Palnatoki]]. A French edition of his book, written by [[Gottlieb Emanuel von Haller]] (''Guillaume Tell, Fable danoise''), was burnt in [[Altdorf, Uri|Altdorf]].&lt;ref name="troxler"&gt;Troxler, J. ''et al.'': ''Guillaume Tell'', pp.&amp;nbsp;43–46; Ketty &amp; Alexandre, Chapelle-sur-Moudon, 1985, {{ISBN|2-88114-001-7}}. See also "[http://www3.dfj.vd.ch/~latin/Textes-recreations/guillaume-tell2.htm#pamphlet Le pamphlet de von Haller]" (in French).&lt;/ref&gt;

The skeptical view of Tell's existence remained very unpopular. [[Friedrich von Schiller]] used Tschudi's version as the basis for his play ''[[Wilhelm Tell (play)|Wilhelm Tell]]'' in 1804, interpreting Tell as a glorified patriot assassin. This interpretation became very popular, especially in Switzerland, where the Tell figure was used in the early 19th century as a "national hero" and identification figure in the [[Helvetic Republic]], and later in the beginnings of the ''[[Switzerland as a federal state|Schweizerische Eidgenossenschaft]]'', the modern democratic federal state that developed. When historian Joseph Eutych Kopp dared to question the legend in the 1830s, his [[effigy]] was burnt on the ''[[Rütli]]'', a meadow above [[Lake Lucerne]] where—according to the legend—the oath was sworn that concluded the alliance between the founding cantons of the Swiss confederacy.

It has been mostly undisputed among  historians since the second half of the 19th century that there is no evidence for Tell as a historical individual, let alone for the apple-shot story. &lt;ref&gt;de Capitani (2013) cites the publications by Joseph Eutych Kopp in the 1840s as the turning point after which the historicity of the Tell legend could no longer be reasonably defended.&lt;/ref&gt;
Debate in the late 19th to 20th centuries mostly surrounded the extent of the "historical nucleus" in the chronistic traditions surrounding the early Confederacy.
The desire to defend the historicity of the ''Befreiungstradition'' ("liberation tradition") of Swiss history had a political component, as since the 17th century its celebration had become mostly confined to the Catholic cantons, so that the declaration of parts of the tradition as ahistorical was seen as an attack by the urban Protestant cantons on the rural Catholic cantons. 
The decision, taken in 1891,  to make [[1 August]] the [[Swiss National Day ]] is to be seen in this context, an ostentative move away from the traditional ''Befreiungstradition'' and the celebration of the deed of Tell to the purely documentary evidence of the [[ Federal Charter of 1291]]. In this context, Wilhelm Öchsli was commissioned by the federal government with publishing a "scientific account" of the foundational period of the Confederacy in order to defend the choice of 1291 over 1307  (the traditional date of Tell's deed and the [[Rütlischwur]]) as the foundational date of the Swiss state.&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Öchsli, ''Die Anfänge der Schweizerischen Eidgenossenschaft''. Zürich, 1891.&lt;/ref&gt;
The canton of Uri, in defiant reaction this decision taken at the federal level, erected the [[Tell Monument]] in Altdorf in 1895, with the date 1307 inscribed prominently on the base of the statue.

Later proposals for the identification of Tell as a historical individual, such as a 1986 publication deriving the name ''Tell'' from the placename ''Tellikon'' (modern   [[Dällikon]] in the [[Canton of Zürich]]), are outside of the historiographical mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Claudio Schärer , ''Und es gab Tell doch'' (1986). Schärer cites the historical record of one ''Wilhelm Gorkeit'' of ''Tellikon'' and argues that ''Gorkeit'' is equivalent to ''Armbruster'' ("crossbow maker"). Historians were not convinced, but the theory was welcomed in part of the natioanlistic right in Switzerland, being referenced by Rudolf Keller, at the time president of the  [Swiss Democrats]], on 1 August 2004 in a speech in Basel. 
Keller, R.: [http://www.schweizer-demokraten.ch/1.AugustRedeR.Keller.pdf Speech held on August 1, 2004].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparative mythology ==
{{Main|Shooting an apple off one's child's head}}
The Tell legend has been compared to a number of other myths or legends, specifically in [[Norse mythology]], involving a magical marksman coming to the aid of a suppressed people under the sway of a tyrant.
The story of a great outlaw successfully shooting an apple from his child's head is an [[archetype]] present in the story of [[Agilaz|Egil]] in the [[Thidreks saga]] (associated with the god [[Ullr]] in Eddaic tradition) as well as in the stories of [[Adam Bell]] from [[England]], [[Palnatoki]] from [[Denmark]] and a story from [[Holstein]].

Such parallels were pointed out as early as 1760 by Gottlieb Emanuel von Haller and the pastor Simeon Uriel Freudenberger in a book titled "''William Tell, a Danish Fable"'' (German: ''Der Wilhelm Tell, ein dänisches Mährgen'').&lt;ref name="bergier_80f"&gt;Bergier, p.&amp;nbsp;80f.&lt;/ref&gt; This book offended Swiss citizens, and a copy of it was burnt publicly at the Altdorf square. Von Haller underwent a trial, but the authorities spared his life, as he made abject apologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/in-search-of-william-tell-2198511/|title=In Search of William Tell|last=Wernick|first=Robert|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rochholz (1877) connects the similarity of the Tell legend to the stories of Egil and Palnatoki with the legends of a migration from Sweden to Switzerland during the Middle Ages. He also adduces parallels in folktales among the Finns and the Lapps (Sami). From pre-Christian Norse mythology, Rochholz compares [[Ullr]], who bears the epithet of ''Boga-As'' ("bow-god"), [[Heimdall]] and also [[Odin]] himself, who according to the ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'' (Book 1, chapter 8.16) assisted [[Haddingus]] by shooting ten bolts from a crossbow in one shot, killing as many foes. Rochholz further compares Indo-European and oriental traditions and concludes (pp.&amp;nbsp;35–41) that the legend of the master marksman shooting an apple (or similar small target) was known outside the Germanic sphere (Germany, Scandinavia, England) and the adjacent regions (Finland and the Baltic) in India, Arabia, Persia and the Balkans (Serbia).

The [[Denmark|Danish]] legend of [[Palnatoki]], first attested in the twelfth-century ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'' by [[Saxo Grammaticus]],&lt;ref name="bergier_82"&gt;Bergier, p.&amp;nbsp;82.&lt;/ref&gt; is the earliest known parallel to the Tell legend. As with William Tell, Palnatoki is forced by the ruler (in this case King [[Harald Bluetooth]]) to shoot an apple off his son's head as proof of his marksmanship.&lt;ref name="keightley_293"&gt;see e.g. Keightley, Thomas. ''Tales and Popular Fictions: Their Resemblance and Transmission from Country to Country''. London: Whittaker, 1834, p.&amp;nbsp;293.&lt;/ref&gt; 
A striking similarity between William Tell and Palnatoki is that both heroes take more than one arrow out of their quiver. When asked why he pulled several arrows out of his quiver, Palnatoki, too, replies that if he had struck his son with the first arrow, he would have shot King Harald with the remaining two arrows.&lt;ref name="bergier_82" /&gt; 
According to Saxo, Palnatoki later joins Harald's son [[Swein Forkbeard]] in a rebellion and kills Harald with an arrow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zeeberg|first1=Peter|title=Saxos Danmarkshistorie|date=2000|publisher=Gads Forlag|location=Denmark|isbn=978-87-12-04745-2|page=909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zellige''' ({{IPA-ar|zˈliʑ|lang}}; {{lang-ar|الزليج}}; also '''zelige''' or '''zellij''') is mosaic [[tile]]work made from individually chiseled geometric tiles set into a [[plaster]] base.&lt;ref&gt;[[L'Opinion]] (May 6, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; This form of [[Islamic art]] is one of the main characteristics of [[Moroccan architecture]]. It consists of [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometrically patterned]] [[mosaic]]s, used to [[Ornament (architecture)|ornament]] walls, ceilings, fountains, floors, pools and tables.

==History==
{{further|Islamic geometric patterns}}

The [[Moors|Moorish]] art of zellige flourished during the [[Hispano-Moresque]] period ([[Azulejo]]) of the [[Maghreb]] and the area known as [[Al-Andalus]] (modern day [[Spain]]) between 711-1492. The technique was highly developed during the [[Nasrid dynasty]] and [[Merinid dynasty]] who gave it more importance around the 14th century and introduced blue, green and yellow colours. Red was added in the 17th century. The old enamels with the natural colours were used until the beginning of the 20th century and the colours had probably not evolved much since the period of Merinids. The cities of [[Fes]] and [[Meknes]] in [[Morocco]], remain the centers of this art.

Patrons of the art used zellige historically to decorate their homes as a statement of luxury and the sophistication of the inhabitants. Zellige is typically a series of patterns utilizing colourful [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric patterns]]. This framework of expression arose from the need of [[Islamic art]]ists to create spatial decorations that [[Aniconism in Islam|avoided depictions of living things]], consistent with the teachings of [[Sharia|Islamic law]].

== Clays for Zellige ==
[[Fez, Morocco|Fez]] and Meknes in Morocco are still the production centers for zellige tiles due to the [[Miocene]] grey clay of [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]]. The clay from this region is primarily composed of [[Kaolinite]]. For [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]] and Meknes, the clay composition is 2-56% clay minerals, calcite 3-29%. Meriam El Ouahabi states that:

{{quote|From the other sites (Meknes, Fes, Salé and Safi), the clay mineral composition shows besides kaolinite the presence of [[illite]], [[chlorite]], [[smectite]] and traces of mixed layer illite/chlorite (Fig. 3). Meknes clays belong to illitic clays, characterized by illite (54 – 61%), kaolinite (11 – 43%), smectite (8 – 12%) and chlorite (6 – 19%) (Fig. 3). Fes clays have a homogeneous composition (Fig. 3) with illite (40 – 48%). and kaolinite (18 – 28%) as the most abundant clay minerals. Chlorite (12 – 15%) and smectite (9 – 12%) are generally present as small quantities. Mixed layer illite/chlorite is present in trace amounts in all the examined Fes clay materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=El Ouahabi |first=Meriam |year=2014 |title=Mineralogical and geotechnical characterization of clays from northern Morocco for their potential use in the ceramic industry |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261479494_Preliminary_mineralogical_and_geotechnical_characterization_of_clays_from_Morocco_application_to_ceramic_industry |journal=Clay Minerals |volume=49 |pages=35–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Forms and trends==

As the colour palette of the zellige tiles increased over the centuries, it became possible to multiply the compositions ''ad infinitum''. The most current form of the zellige is a square. Other forms are  possible: the [[octagon]] combined with a [[cabochon]], a [[star]], a [[cross]], etc. It is then [[Molding (process)|moulded]] with a thickness of approximately 2 centimetres. There are simple squares of 10 by 10 centimeters or with the corners cut to be combined with a coloured cabochon. To pave an area, [[bejmat]], a [[Pavement (architecture)|paving stone]] of 15 by 5 centimetres approximately and 2 centimetres thick, can also be used.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"An encyclopedia could not contain the full array of complex, often individually varied patterns and the individually shaped, hand-cut [[tesserae]], or [[furmah]], found in zillij work. Star-based patterns are identified by their number of points—'itnashari for 12, 'ishrini for 20, arba' wa 'ishrini for 24 and so on, but they are not necessarily named with exactitude. The so-called [[khamsini]], for 50 points, and mi'ini, for 100, actually consist of 48 and 96 points respectively, because geometry requires that the number of points of any star in this sequence be divisible by six. (There are also sequences based on five and on eight.) Within a single star pattern, variations abound—by the mix of colors, the size of the furmah, and the complexity and size of interspacing elements such as strapping, braids, or "lanterns." And then there are all the non-star patterns— [[honeycomb]]s, webs, steps and shoulders, and [[checkerboard]]s. The [[Alhambra]]'s interlocking zillij patterns were reportedly a source of inspiration for the tessellations of modern Dutch artist [[M.C. Escher]]."&lt;ref&gt;Werner, Louis. 2001. [http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200103/zillij.in.fez.htm "Zillij in Fez."] Saudi Aramco World. May–June 2001. Volume 52 (3). Pages 18–31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Themes often employ [[Kufic]] script, as it fits well with the geometry of the mosaic tiles, and patterns often culminate centrally in the [[Rub El Hizb]]. The [[tessellation]]s in the mosaics are currently of interest in academic research in the [[mathematics and art|mathematics of art]].

==Zellige craftsmanship==

Zellige making is considered an [[art]] in itself. The art is transmitted from generation to generation by ''maâlems'' (master craftsmen). A long training starts at childhood to implant the required skills.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beton-decoratif.com/infos.htm beton-decoratif.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Assiduous attention to detail is needed when creating zellige. The small shapes (cut according to a precise [[radius gauge]]), painted and enamel covered pieces are then assembled in a geometrical structure as in a [[puzzle]] to form the completed mosaic. The process has not varied for a millennium, though conception and design has started using new technologies such as [[data processing]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;gallery&gt;
